Schizophrenia,\ndepression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, and mania\nare examples. The concept of mental disorder or illness plays a role\nin many domains, including medicine, social sciences such as\npsychology and anthropology, and the humanities, including literature\nand philosophy. Philosophical discussions are the primary focus of the\npresent entry, which differs from the entry on Philosophy of\nPsychiatry in noting several different approaches—not only those\nof the philosophy of science and mind, but also those arising from\nphenomenological and social theory traditions.\n\n\nAs a category, mental disorder is not well fitted to the part it plays\nin contemporary psychiatry. Although now widely judged to be forms of\ndisorder (or illness), some conditions, such as those above, have not\nalways been so understood (Porter 2002). Even when deemed to be\ndisorder or illness, moreover, that status has frequently indicated as\nmuch ethical, as organic, deficiency (Irwin 2013). Such reminders\ndirect our attention to contemporary medical psychiatry’s\nuncompromisingly biological, and avowedly value-free “medical\nmodel”, with its incumbent analogies and assumptions, and to the\ngeneral question of how the taxa of psychiatric classifications are to\nbe viewed as objects of natural science. This model has received\nintensive and continuing philosophical analysis and critique,\nincluding by those denying these conditions are deficiencies at all.\nAnd along with issues arising from more recent advances in cognitive\npsychology and the neurosciences, such foundational issues make up\nmuch of the following entry. Because of their focus on ideas central\nto the philosophy of mind and ethics (the relation of mind to body,\nand issues of responsibility and identity, for example) analyses of\nmental disorder have extensive implications for those fields. But as\nclinical phenomena, these conditions also reflect an inescapable,\neveryday, societal reality, giving theoretical inquiries additionally\nurgent practical, moral, and legal, implications.\n\nThe language here is highly contentious. There are exceptions, but in\na long history mental illnesses have been referred to as\n“evil”, as “willful error”, as “grave\nmisfortune” or, at the very least, regarded as\nunwelcome.[1]\nAnd with some regularity, conditions like those listed in the current\ndiagnostic and classificatory manual of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation (DSM-5 [APA 2013]) and or the International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11 [WHO\n2018]) have been provided new classificatory titles and terminology,\nsuch revisions often solely aimed at reducing negative and\nstigmatizing associations.  Authors cited in what follows use\n“mental disorder”, “psychiatric disability”,\n“psychiatric disorder”, “mental illness”,\n“madness”, “psychopathology”. Controversy\nattaches to these terms, as it does to particular diagnostic labels\n(such as “schizophrenia”), because some question whether\nthese mental differences are forms of illness or disorder at\nall. Although it is not widely employed, the more neutral\n“mental difference” better accommodates each side of this\ncontroversy, and the choice of terminology employed in what follows is\nnot intended to promote a disorder or illness view. \nThree changes of language require special attention. Frequently, the\nterm “illness” in “mental illness”\nhas been replaced by “disorder”, apparently\nwithout a consistent rationale beyond avoiding explicitly medical\nlanguage. The rise of cognitive psychology has brought a parallel\ntrend where “the cognitive” and “cognition”\nare sometimes introduced as equivalents or replacements for “the\nmental”. This new language around “cognition”\ncombines the earlier faculty psychology divisions of affection and\ncognition: as much as doxastic states, emotions are\n “cognitive”.[2]\n Then finally, increasing use of “mental and\nbehavioral”, sometimes shortened to\n“behavioral” (as in “behavioral health”),\nreflects substantive decisions also, such as the inclusion of\naddictions and compulsions in the class of disorders, and a preference\nfor precisely measurable symptoms. \nBecause it is now more common in philosophical writing, the expression\n“mental disorder”, replaces “mental illness”\nin what follows. And unless otherwise indicated, “mental\ndisorder” is taken to refer not only to more\n“mental” conditions like psychoses and affective\ndisorders, but also to “behavioral” conditions such as\naddictions and character disorders. Frequently, the shift from\n’mental’ to “cognitive” also indicates\nallegiance to substantive theoretical tenets. Here, however,\n“cognitive” and “cognition” are used only as\nterms of art within particular theoretical analyses. \nBoth common sense folk psychology and medical psychiatry employ\nconcepts of mental disorder or illness. (“Depression”\nrefers to the same mood states and attitudes, for example, whether\nused by a professionals or non-professionals.) This can foster\nconfusion, and inconsistencies arise at the boundaries where mental\ndisorders meet other kinds of disorder. Rather than traditionally\nmental symptoms, for example, “hysterical”\n(“psychosomatic”, “somatoform”, or\n“conversion”) syndromes exhibit bodily paralyses, minor\nskin conditions, and intestinal maladies (Shorter 2006; Micale 1995;\nScull 2009). Yet they remain mental disorders in common understanding,\nand long found a place in standard psychiatric\n classifications.[3]\n Also anomalous, some conditions with apparently mental symptoms are\nthe causal product of what are, indisputably, diseases of and damage\nsuffered by the brain. (Delusions following cerebral hemorrhage are an\nexample.) They are judged to be neurological rather than psychiatric\ncomplaints however, and excluded from the class of mental disorders\naccording to both everyday conceptions, and diagnostic taxonomies.\nSimilarly, although perception is widely judged a mental capacity,\nsome conditions affecting sight, such as blindness, are absent from\ndiagnostic classifications. \nThere are different views about the conceptual relationship between\nthe informal and more clinical language, and philosophers and others\nhave approached this problem in several ways depending on varying\nfoundational assumptions. Some insist that the confusions and\ninconsistencies that occur result from the fact that the concept of\nmental disorder employed in psychiatry’s conception and\nclassification of disorders is too closely allied to the parallel\nconcepts in folk psychology. Confusion and inconsistency at the\nboundaries between mental, neurological, and organic disorders arise,\naccording to Dominic Murphy, from acceptance of inconsistent folk\npsychological categorizing, ill-suited to the properly scientific\ntaxonomic task which, because it is tied to the hope for a theory of\nthe “hidden structure” of the taxonomic domain, seeks\ncausal explanation. Relinquishing intuitively grounded, inherently\nnormative folk psychological categories, and accepting the divisions\nthat ensue from scientific research through a combination of\npsychiatry and cognitive neuroscience, is the first step towards\nachieving a scientific psychiatric classification (Murphy 2007).\nWithout a principled and systematic way to identify the class of\nmental disorders, Murphy’s concerns suggest, any disorder\ntaxonomy that is presently employed will likely prove inaccurate. The\nold adage that once their organic causes are known, all mental\ndisorders are transformed into neurological conditions, bespeaks an\nexpectation that the out-moded, folk psychological category of mental\ndisorder is itself temporary and will eventually be rendered\notiose—an outcome anticipated without regret by adherents of\nstrong mind-body reductionism (see Guze 1992; Churchland 1989). \nAdopting more conservative approaches, others have urged the\nimportance of maintaining the category of mental disorder (Brülde\n& Radovic 2006). Everyday language and the traditional\nclassifications built around it have provided a common framework for\nresearch and clinical practice; and with any further blurring of the\nboundaries between mental disorders and the brain damage and disease\ntreated by neurologists, demarcations of professional competence would\nbe lost. Fear of over-diagnosis, of according too much power to\nmedical psychiatry and the psychopharmacology industry, and of\nrelinquishing to experts decisions about mental health and conceptions\nof eudaimonia more appropriately resolved by non-scientists,\nhave all challenged the societal place occupied by medical psychiatry\n(see\n §10). \nIt is not only for such social and political reasons, and\nconsiderations of practicality and custom, that common sense concepts\nhave been supported. Also at stake here is the nature of the epistemic\nrole accorded to conceptual analysis. Whether cast in terms of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions, or more loosely, there is\ndisagreement over how much analyses of mental disorder must be guided\nby everyday language and categories. Some analyses acknowledge more\nthan the most immediate observations derived from the empirical and\ncognitive sciences, and may adhere to an account of mind and mental\nprocessing employing mentalist terms and normative presuppositions\ninapplicable within an exclusively physical framework (see\n §4,\n §5, and\n §8).\n In addition, some regard mental disorders as socially constructed\nentities, the existence and classification of which necessarily rely\non societal features of the world (see\n §10). \nA meta-taxonomy of these varying foundational assumptions includes\nthree intersecting issues: what mental disorders are; how much we can\npresently know about them; and different approaches to their analysis.\nThus, objectivist (or naturalist) accounts, hold that mental disorders\nare empirically discoverable items that can be provided value-free\ndescription, while evaluativist (or normative) analyses deny the\npossibility of such value-free description (these are discussed in\n §8.1).\n Prepared to relinquish our current concepts, revisionists are also\nloosely distinguishable from conservatives favoring the retention of\n(at least some) traditional categorizations. And finally, the nature\nof mental disorder will be sought either through a posteriori\nscientific research based in cognitive science, or through conceptual\nanalysis derived in part or whole from social and cultural norms. \nIn a once-common practice, mental or “functional”\ndisorders were diagnosed just when no somatic traits were evident.\nSuch language is now explicitly disavowed, eclipsed by a growing\nconfidence that all disorders involve bodily states (Sykes 2010; APA\n2013: 309). Still, the “mental” in mental disorder is\nvariously construed. In this section we'll first consider different\nviews on \"where\" in disorder that mentality lies and, then, different\nviews on what it consists in. \nOn traditional, two-part models from pathology, dysfunctional organic\nprocesses internal to the individual are manifested in, and causally\nresponsible for, more readily observable signs and symptoms;\ncollectively, these two parts make up the disease concept. Employed\nfor mental disease (illness, disorder), certain of those underlying\nprocesses have been delimited as mental by appeal to the traditional\ncategories of faculty psychology (perception, affection, cognition,\nmemory, and so on). For example, hallucinations represent\ndysfunctional perceptual capabilities, mania and depression disturbed\naffect regulation, and delusions defective cognitive processing. A\ndisorder is thus determined to be mental as distinct from physical if\nits internal causes involve psychological faculties (Wakefield 1997).\nBy contrast, although also governed by traditional facultative\ndivisions, other accounts ascribe disabled mentality not to underlying\nfeatures but to effects on the subject’s social and personal\nfunctioning (Rashed & Bingham 2014; Wakefield 1992, 1997.). For\nexample, it is because her states of sadness and self-doubt result in\nabsenteeism, that the person with depression seeks medical help (see\n §4.2). \nOn two-stage accounts both internal and outwardly-observed features\nform a part. (At least this is true of mental disorders that are\nprototypical, according to George Graham [2010].) Internal and more readily\nobservable features are each included in the DSM definition of mental\ndisorder:  \na syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an\nindividual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior, that\nreflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or\ndevelopmental processes underlying mental functioning. (APA 2013: 20,\nemphasis added) \nThe different positions on mental disorder just\nsketched—emphasizing internal conditions, observable\nmanifestations, and both—are discussed in\n Section 4.\n Each position exhibits vulnerabilities. Accounts stressing inherent\nfeatures regularly rely on hypothetical entities or processes,\nexpecting that out of future discoveries will emerge knowledge of\ncausal mechanisms presently hidden from view. (This position has a\nlong history; for a recent version, see Murphy 2007.) Perhaps\nexplained by its status as a new science, this faith has been sorely\ntested, thus far, by confused classifications, apparently ill grounded\nresearch, and other liabilities, as well as incomplete models of\nmental dysfunction (see\n §4\n and\n §6).\n If these impediments can be overcome, emphasis on internal causes may\nbe expected to yield powerful explanatory models, laying the ground\nfor the incalculably valuable targeted interventions and effective\nprevention and treatment sought by all. (See entry on Philosophy of\nPsychiatry). Placing emphasis on disabling or dysfunctional symptoms\nhas comparable vulnerabilities associated with relativism. One\nsetting’s dysfunctional mental symptom may be another’s\nnormal, admired, or useful trait; and mental disorder must be\ndistinguished conceptually from deviance, as well as from normal\nresponses to the losses and setbacks that are our common human\nexperience (these issues are discussed in\n §4,\n §8, and\n §10). \nViews on the nature of the mental in mental disorder come from both\nphilosophical accounts and, implicitly, from cognitive psychology. In\nsome philosophical accounts including those stemming from\nphenomenological traditions, the mental is distinguished by particular\nfeatures: it bears a special relationship to conscious awareness, and\nto persons, for example, or may be taken to exhibit the distinctive\n“aboutness” or intentionality exclusive to mental\nattitudes (see\n §5).\n Some theorizing about meaning and language similarly emphasizes the\nreasons-responsiveness of all human thought and action, by which\ndisorder can alone be explained and understood (Campbell 1999, 2001,\n2013; Thornton 2007).  \nExplanatory accounts of cognitive capacities in cognitive psychology\nhave taken several different forms over the years: information\nprocessing models, which themselves were made up of computational\nprocesses and representations; connectionist networks; and, more\nrecently, directly neural accounts. Moreover, philosophical\nreconstructions of cognitive psychology and cognitive science must be\ndistinguished from the cognitive psychology practiced by\npsychologists—although little discussion of \"the mental\" occurs\nin either. Instead, focus is on the cognitive when, as was pointed out\nearlier, the \"cognitive\" subsumes capacities, states, and processes\nthat used to be considered non-cognitive, such as sensations and\nemotions. Widespread acceptance of these shifts in much theoretical\nand research writing on mental disorder has gone some way toward\neclipsing more philosophical concepts of mind and the mental, even\nthough commonsense cognitive capacities, which are understood to\ninvolve intentionality, remain the starting point of the research\nprogram of cognitive science, and branches of cognitive psychology and\ncognitive neuroscience address traditionally “mental”\nprocesses such as reasoning and consciousness. \nThe focus of cognitive psychology usually lies with computation and\nrepresentation. Mental/cognitive states (representations) depict\nfeatures of the outside world (as well as other mental states and\nabstract entities), and mental/cognitive processes operate on those\ninner symbols, transforming and manipulating them (see Von Eckardt\n1993; Friedenberg & Silverman 2011; Cratsley & Samuels 2013,\nand the\n entry on cognitive science).\n Although demarcated by the faculties known as “mental”,\nthe realm of the cognitive is typically construed as properties or\nprocesses with a causal role in determining behavior, or behavioral\ncapacities, that offer no resistance to naturalistic characterization\n(Chalmers 1996). Candidates for a distinctive “mark of the\ncognitive” are debated—but so is the need for one (for\ndiscussion of this question, see Varga 2018). \nContrary to what has sometimes been feared, the broad grouping of\nmental disorders does not require an embrace of unwanted metaphysical\ndualism. Mental disorders are conditions or states attributed to\npersons, but this need entail neither that they are entirely\nnon-physical in nature, nor that they must be explained in solely\nneuro-scientific terms. Maintaining the separation between mental and\nphysical disorders is compatible with some form of weak physicalism,\nfor example, allowing that mental or psychological processing involved\nin functions such as perception, reasoning and memory, depends on the\nworkings of the brain (see Schaffner 2013 and the\n entry on health). \nHow might mental disorders be distinguished from non-disordered mental\nstates and conditions? Depression and anxiety, the schizophrenias,\nobsessions, compulsions and the like are core instances of mental\ndisorder, but psychiatric classification acknowledges many other\nconditions as well. From such a large and apparently heterogeneous\ncollection, the broad category may best be judged a family resemblance\none. Indeed, through a different historical or cultural lens, the\nassembled variations known today as mental disorders would likely\nappear incoherently arbitrary and diverse. Yet, spurred by\nessentialist expectations (and out of concern about the unwarranted\n“medicalization” of normal states and behavior), the quest\nfor a unifying conception of mental illness or disorder has persisted\nwithin philosophical research. Characteristic features have been\nidentified, including disunity, irrationality, the presence of\nsuffering and disability, and several forms of dysfunction. Formal\nanalytic definitions have also been proposed, and are illustrated in\n Section 4.4. \nWorks of ancient philosophy are focused more on the psyche’s\nhealth (or eudaimonia) than its illness. Nonetheless, there\nare hints that just as a unified soul is one that is healthy (as well\nas rational and virtuous), a soul lacking unity will be disturbed, or\nmad. Offering an account of the harmonious soul, whose rational and\nnon-rational elements achieve a unified whole, Aristotle leaves us a\npicture of the warring and fractured state of an unhealthy soul, for\n example.[4]\n The emphasis on disunity is here tied to the vices and irrationality:\na fully unified soul is virtuous and rational, a dis-unified one\nvicious and irrational in its unhealthy divisions. And, while they\nadhere to a different account of the passions and a more\nknowledge-based and Platonic analysis of vice, this link with the\nvices and virtues is also characteristic of the subsequent Stoic\nanalyses (Irwin 2013). A conception of mental illness as psychic\ndisunity (as well as an association between health, rationality and\nvirtue) reoccurs in later philosophy (Spinoza, for example), and in\npsychoanalytic traditions. Within present-day disorder descriptions,\nsome symptom clusters readily fit the classical emphasis on disunity\n(addictions, and bipolarity, for example); others, including most\npersonality disorders, are less persuasively depicted in such terms\n(see Worrell & Denham 2016). \nAs a characteristic attributed to mental disorder irrationality or\n“unreason” has been linked to emphasis on order and logic\nduring the “Age of Reason”, which (together with the\nemergence of empirical science), is seen to have laid the foundation\nfor our contemporary psychiatric categories and\n theories.[5]\n In the present day, cultural norms and intuitive folk psychology\nassign the boundaries of mental disorder, and these intuitions\nconflict about some particular conditions (addictions, and disorders\nof “character” or personality, for example). Yet disturbed\nor disabled doxastic states and capabilities remain core exemplars of\ndisorder, over which intuitive agreement is consistent. Characterized\nby incomprehensibly disordered thought, failure to adjust beliefs in\nresponse to new evidence, inconsistencies between thought and action,\nand delusional convictions, psychosis and psychotic thought patterns\nare regularly judged prototypical features of mental disorder. So the\nrationalistic analysis of disorder may yet correspond—but to a\nreduced version of the presently sprawling overall category. \nForms of doxastic irrationality are still the mainstay of much policy\nand legal analysis about mental disorder. Assessments of criminal\nresponsibility, of fitness to stand trial, and of the capacity to\nundertake binding contracts, for example, are cast in terms of the\ndefendant’s ability to know and understand (Reznek 1987;\nRobinson 1996, 2013; Adshead 2008). Ostensibly, construing mental disorder as a want of\nrationality has been weakened in the face of evidence from behavioral\neconomics showing that holding and acting on well-grounded and\nreasons-responsive beliefs occurs rarely in the general population,\nand common prejudices and superstitions seem to be indistinguishable\nfrom clinical delusions with respect not only to their prevalence but\nto the way they are adopted and maintained (Bortolotti 2009,\n2013). \nConfidence that irrationality defines mental disorder is similarly\neroded if, understood as effective social function and personal\nflourishing, mental health lies in traits such as unwarranted\noptimism, and the distorting tendency to emphasize, and remember,\nsuccess over failure experiences in “positive\nillusions”(Taylor & Brown 1988; McKay & Dennett 2009;\nJefferson et al. 2017). Along these lines, some illusions, delusions,\nand hallucinations have recently been acknowledged  \nperfectly acceptable, sometimes praiseworthy ways of being hopeful,\ncommitted to imagining and enacting a better world for oneself and\nothers…making moral and meaningful lives. (Flanagan &\nGraham 2017: 309)  \nBut as this indicates, whether disorder is usefully characterized as a\nwant of reason depends, finally, on guiding, normative conceptions of\nmental health or eudaimonia, and of the role of reason in\nthose conceptions—not on facts of the matter, or\nconsequentialist reasoning.  \nOther depictions of disorder rely on one or both of the groups of\ntraits around suffering, distress and psychic pain,\non the one hand, and, on the other hand, disability,\nincapacity and personal or behavioral dysfunction. These\nare the features noted in a series of influential prefatory remarks in\nthe diagnostic and statistical manuals (the DSMs and ICDs). The\nwording of the fifth edition of the DSM introduces a disjunction:  \nMental disorders are usually associated with significant distress\nor disability in social, occupational, or other important\nactivities. (APA 2013: 20, emphasis added)  \nA very similar passage from the ICD-10 is comparably qualified:  \n“Disorder”…is used here to imply the existence of a\nclinically recognizable set of symptoms or behavior associated in\nmost cases with distress and with interference with\npersonal functions. (WHO 1992: 5, emphasis added)  \nBecause distress, psychic pain, and suffering form a part of normal\nhuman experience, and the presence of distress is also used to\nseparate disorder from social deviance, further qualifications follow\neach of these statements (WHO 1992: 5)). In addition, as the\ndisjunction in the DSM formulation apparently recognizes, many\ndisorders fail to exhibit evidence of distress or suffering. \nPsychodynamic or psychoanalytic presuppositions may posit underlying\ndistresses that are masked, or submerged, within the psyche; and the\nelusive phenomenology of some conditions suggests the presence of\nnameless existential anxieties hidden from awareness (Ratcliffe 2008,\n2017). But such explanations aside, distress has been widely regarded\nas a ubiquitous, if not unfailing, feature of disorder. In\nsymptom-focused accounts laying stress on the consequences of\nthe syndrome, distress becomes prominent as a form of disabling\ndysfunction (Stein et. al. 2010). Instead of separate criteria (and\neither singly or jointly sufficient for disorder, as in the respective\nDSM and ICD definitions above), suffering and dysfunction are\nconjoined on a “distress-impairment” analysis, where\ndisorder status is assigned with (and defined as) distress that is\n“unmanageable or disabling” (Bolton 2013). Whether this\nanalysis applies to the whole class of mental disorders as presently\nunderstood is doubtful: its plausibility increases with what has been\ncalled “distress related conditions”, such as depression\nand anxiety, that are “more constitutive of the illness”\n(Bolton 2012: 10; see also\n §4). \nTo accommodate exceptions that seem neither distressing nor disabling\n(such as manic states), mental disorder is sometimes characterized not\nby distress and dysfunction but by raised risk of such outcomes (Gert\n& Culver 2004). But risk of disorder is not disorder, and risk\nlanguage invites troubling issues around over-diagnosis and false\npositives ((Schwartz 2008; Stein et al. 2010; Bolton 2013; Broome,\nFugar-Poli, & Wuyts 2013).  \nLoosely understood, moreover, distresses such as these are an\ninescapable part of the human condition and a normal response to\nlife’s vicissitudes. When and whether normal (and even\nappropriate) suffering reflects pathology has long been the source of\nphilosophical—and societal—disagreement (Wilkinson 2000;\nHorwitz & Wakefield 2007). In the discussions of “normal\nsadness” that accompanied the revision of a fifth edition of the\nDSM, the grief exclusion that had (temporarily) exempted from\ndiagnosis the suffering around mourning and grief, was challenged, its\nproposed elimination charged with “medicalizing” or\n“pathologizing” normal and appropriate human feelings\n(Zachar 2014; Wakefield 2012). We might expect the separation of\nnormal from pathological distress and, more broadly, the\ncharacterization of mental disorder in terms of distress, to be\nindicated by distress emanating from the disorder itself, rather than\nfrom other contingencies. But equally outcomes of the disorder itself\nare the distresses resulting from the stigma and discrimination that\nfollow diagnosis and treatment, as well as a host of other, frequently\nnegative, consequences in jarring and alarming disruptions to personal\nlives, selves, and relationships (Tekin 2011). \nPathological distress must thus be further specified, as the result of\ncauses inherent to the individual and/or her disorder. Research\nidentifying and explaining the physical elements of affect regulation\npredicts that biological markers will eventually allow us to\ndistinguish distress that is a symptom of depression, for example,\nfrom that which is a more normal response (Horwitz & Wakefield\n2007). (In serving to shrink the margins of disorder, such biomarkers\nmay be welcomed by those decrying over-diagnosis, even if an\nevaluative interpretation as to whether, and when, such biomarkers\noccur in healthy and unhealthy form is still required.) \nRather than illness attributions being made on the basis of any\nantecedent facts about the body, Mohammed Rashed and Rachel Bingham\nargue that the subjective experience of distress and the extent of\nimpairment of the person’s day-to-day functioning is an\nintrinsic property of depression: conceptually such\nattributions are made on the basis of “consequences of the\nsyndrome as they manifest for the subject” (Rashed & Bingham\n2014: 245). Similarly stressing intrinsic properties, others have\nemphasized that psychological symptoms may constitute a\nmental disorder, even as it is caused by biological or social factors.\nThus, in the case of depression without evidence of known biomarkers,\nour intuitions suggest disorder would be attributed on the basis of\npsychological symptoms alone. Were known biomarkers present\nwithout evidence of any psychological symptoms, on the other hand, no\nattribution would be made. These intuitions may shift with time, it is\nrecognized, so the assertion is limited to how most people and most\npsychiatrists now understand, define, diagnose, and treat,\ndepression (Sinnott-Armstrong & Summers forthcoming). But today at\nleast, disorder would be attributed on the basis of the symptoms of\ndepression with or without known biomarkers. \nAnalyses characterizing felt distress as a property constitutive of\nsome given psychiatric condition (such as depression), are also\ncompatible with recent models focused on the causally interconnected\nstatistical networks making up symptom clusters. These clusters are\ndepicted as reinforced through feedback loops that serve to rope\ntogether assorted symptoms independent of any underlying, antecedent,\ncommon, cause. In the case of depression, a range of symptoms arise\nfrom diverse sources and, through their looping interactions, form,\nworsen, and maintain the disorder as a relatively stable entity and\nconceptual whole (Kendler, Zachar, & Craver 2011; Borsboom &\nCramer 2013). \nSymptom-focused accounts sometimes combine suffering with disability,\nas was noted. But standing alone, something the affected person is\nprevented from doing, or unable to do as well as others, captured in\nthe ideas of disability, impairment, incapacity and personal or\nbehavioral dysfunction, offers an alternative characterization that\ncan acknowledge disorders without apparent personal suffering (notably\nmania, some personality disorders, and some addictions). \nDysfunction and disability have been allied, or treated as rough\nequivalents, but disability is also placed in opposition to\ndysfunction. Instead of construed as internal to the person,\ndisabilities are often represented as conditional\nimpairments, dependent on context (including physical and social\narrangements). They impose limitations on the person’s ability\nto perform everyday activities and participate as more typically-abled\npeople do and, on this view, call for appropriate accommodation\nanalogous to ramps for those using wheelchairs (Oliver 1996; Polvora\n2011). The analogies linking psychiatric with other disabilities may\nnot be complete, however, nor can accommodations be achieved as easily\nas installing ramps (see Amundson & Tresky 2007; Rashed\n2019). \nDysfunction forms a central element of the most widely discussed\nanalytic definition of mental disorder, introduced in\n Section 3.\n The notion of dysfunction applies in two distinct ways in\nWakefield’s harmful dysfunction analysis, one way avowedly\nobjective, and the other not (see\n §4.4).\n In the first, dysfunction occurs in some part or parts of a bodily or\nneural system. That dysfunction in turn causes dysfunction in some\npart or parts of the individual’s social and personal system\n(grounding the normative judgment of harmfulness). Only the first kind\nof dysfunction is claimed to permit non-evaluative description. \nThe characteristic dysfunction of mental disorder is here part of a\nstandard, idiopathic model, as we saw, with these disabling\ntraits understood as the symptomatic, causal manifestations of an\nunderlying, pathological process. The appropriateness of that model\nfor psychiatric conditions has received persistent critique during the\ntwentieth century (see\n §10.1).\n Recent challenges include the alternative network models (introduced\nin\n §4.2),\n where symptomatic dysfunction emanates not from some disabled inner\nmechanism, but instead emerges piecemeal from interacting experiences\nthat cumulatively build clusters of disabling symptoms out of feedback\nloops (Kendler, Zachar, & Craver 2011; Borsboom & Cramer\n2013). In support of this alternative model is accumulating evidence\nfrom the social sciences that a range of factors combine to bring\nabout disorder: individualistic risk factors, but also aspects of the\nbroader context in which the individual finds herself (Bolton 2010;\nKirmayer, Lemelson, & Cummings 2015). \nEschewing a more formal analysis, some definitions (including the\n“distress-impairment” analyses introduced earlier), rely\non prototypical cases (see Graham 2010, for example).\nOthers are more ambitious, proposing analytic definitions in terms of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. Some are intended to cover other\nmedical conditions as well as mental disorders. (For those stressing\nthe inseparability and interdependence of mental and bodily disorder,\nno important distinction is acknowledged between mental and physical\ndisorders [Pârvan 2015].) (i)–(iv) below are a sample of\nthese efforts. \nThe symptoms of mental disorder are primarily, if not exclusively,\nstates about which their subject can claim a sort of authority. (Since\nin describing these states subjects can intentionally or\nunintentionally mislead, such loosely phenomenological [or\n“experience-near”] reports may nonetheless present\nepistemic limitations as data (Kontos 2016).) Psychology can provide\nreliable behavioral assessments of disorder, and indicate its presence\nthrough laboratory performance tests. But no mental disorder is thus\nfar independently verifiable (though blood tests or scans, for\nexample). So first person reports play a special part in understanding\nsuch disorder for the clinician, and those establishing philosophical\nanalyses are similarly beholden (Flanagan 2011; Varga 2015). Carl\nJaspers’ 1913 General Psychopathology, which combines\nclose, clinical description with the method and presuppositions of\nexistential and phenomenological thinkers such as Husserl and\nHeidegger, has been widely discussed (Jaspers 1913 [1963]).\n(Jaspers’ pairing of clinical and philosophical knowledge makes\nhim one of the undisputed originators of the research field known as\nthe philosophy of psychiatry and psychopathology.) Confusingly, not\nevery loosely “phenomenological” clinical approach focused\non the patient’s experience and report adheres to all of the\ntenets of the philosophical discipline of phenomenology derived from\nthese traditions, however (see Parnas & Sass 2008). \nThe phenomenological strand of philosophical analysis influenced by\nthinkers like Husserl and Heidegger remains focused on immediate,\nfirst person report (for example, self-experience in psychosis (Parnas\n& Sass 2008), disordered temporal experience (Fuchs 2005, 2013),\ndelusional states (Parnas & Sass 2008; Gallagher 2005, 2011,\n2013), and affective disturbances (Ratcliffe 2008; Ratcliffe &\nStephan 2014; Jacobs et. al. 2014)). In these traditions neither\npsychology nor psychopathology are empirical sciences in the usual\nsense because they involve distinctive forms of explanation. Arising\nwithin nineteenth century social science, the hermeneutical approach\ninvolving meanings calls for Verstehen (understanding), a\ndistinctive, interpretive way of apprehending human action. (See\nJaspers 1913 [1963]; Phillips 2013,Wiggins & Schwartz 2011;\nSpitzer & Uehlein 1992.) These differences of approach bring\ndiffering orientations towards fundamentals, and writing following\nGerman and French traditions has been placed in contrast to the\n“Anglo-empiricist” approach judged more influenced by\nempirical science, and showing greater emphasis on objectivity and\nmeasurement (Mullen 2011). \nThese differences bring contrasting theories about psychology as\nscience. Whether, bypassing diagnostic categories and medical disease\nmodels entirely, symptoms and the subjective life of the patient\nshould be the main or even sole locus of attention, is one\n(Stanghellini 2004); another is whether the experiences associated\nwith psychosis, particularly, must be categorically divorced from more\ntypical psychological processes (Sass 2001; Parnas & Sass 2008).\nEmphasizing the unique challenges imposed by interpretation in\npsychiatry, Somogy Varga has argued for a hermeneutics distinctive to\npsychiatry that is grounded in ideas about the self-interpreting\naspect of human beings, “mental disorder” thus standing in\nan asymmetrical relation that is supervenes on our self identities\n(Varga 2015).  \nThere is disagreement over the correct application of phenomenological\nmethod (Mishara 2007; Sass, Parnas, & Zahavi 2011). But\npsychopathology likely offers a challenge so great as to call for a\nrange of approaches (Ratcliffe 2011; Wiggins and Schwartz 2011;\nGallagher 2013). Attempts have also been made to combine\nphenomenological with empirical approaches: Matthew Ratcliffe’s\nwork on affective states employs social research methods, for example\n(Ratcliffe 2008; Ratcliffe & Stephan 2014). And efforts to tie in\nphenomenological theorizing with findings in neuroscience have yielded\nthe hybrid methodology of phenomenological clinical neuroscience\nadvocating an initial study of subjective experience to only\nthen be probed for its underlying neurobiology (Mishara 2007:\n34). \nThe merging of empirical and phenomenological methodologies is also\nreadily supported by the tenets of some accounts of embodied and\nenactive cognition. Conceptions of the embodied, embedded, and\nsense-making enactive mind bring emphasis on the way, shaped by\nperceptual experience, consciousness and the first person perspective\nform the basis of all mental processing (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch\n1991; Durt, Fuchs, & Tewes 2017; Di Paolo & De Jaegher 2017).\nApplied to mental disorder, this departure from classical cognitivist\nassumptions and analogies suggests that in at least some, and perhaps\nall cases, disorder grows out of disturbances in embodied interaction\nwith the environment, and not from dysfunctions occurring in\nhigh-level cognitive mechanisms (Drayson 2009; Stanghellini 2004;\nMaiese\n 2016).[6] \nWhile\n Section 3\n focused on what might separate mental from non-mental disorders, and\n Section 4\n was concerned with how to separate disordered from non-disordered\nstates, Section 6 addresses another aspect of classification:\ncontroversies over how different types of putative mental disorders\nshould be distinguished from one another. These controversies, like so\nmany about psychiatry, span the disciplines of medicine, science\n(including neuroscience and psychology) and philosophy. \nThe diagnostic and statistical classificatory manuals and\ninternational disease classifications (DSMs and ICDs) share broad\nfeatures in providing a categorical scheme of separate mental\ndisorders: each disorder is idiopathic in arising at least in part\nfrom morbid factors within the person, and each is identified on the\nbasis not of causal explanation but “descriptively”, using\npolythetic (disjunctive) criteria to be employed with clinical\nobservation of individual patients (including their self-report).\nAside from serving the institutions providing services, their\nuniformity is aimed to enhance inter-diagnostician reliability; and\nresearch based on these reliable classifications, it has been hoped,\nshould eventually allow validation of the categories (APA 1980).\n(Failure of this hope to achieve its promised yield in research\nfindings partly motivated the revised research domain criteria (RDoC),\ndescribed later in this section.)  \nPhilosophical discussions of psychiatric classification can be\narranged according to their allegiance to the DSMs and ICDs, and their\naccompanying presuppositions. Following early work by Carl Hempel\n(1961) that depicted psychiatry’s claim to scientific status as\ndepending on the value neutrality of its classifications, much\ndiscussion of classification has been entirely critical, conceding\nlittle usefulness to the approach, skeptical of the promise of\nvalidity, doubtful of its methodology and claims to scientific\nauthority, un-persuaded by the categorical system employed, as well as\nits individualistic and idiopathic emphasis, and dubious over its\nclaim to being, or being able to be, value-free. Philosophical\nanalysis has often been focused on particular symptom descriptions,\ndisregarding or disavowing the diagnostic categories of which they are\npresumed to be clinical manifestations, in some cases introducing and\nemploying revised categories such as “distress related\nconditions” (Bolton 2012), “body image\ndisorders”(Morris 2013), and “real hallucinations”\n(Ratcliffe 2017). Others have accepted the entities so classified\n(Sass, Zahavi, Frith and colleagues, for example). \nCriticisms of DSM and ICD classifications have addressed their\nresearch purposes and usefulness, categorical approaches and supposed\nvalue-neutrality. (The claim to value neutrality is discussed in\n Section 8.\n These classifications recognize the presence of many overarching\nvalues, including the methodological ones implicit in their goals of\nachieving validity and reliability. But further, unsupportable values\n(such as homophobia and misogyny) have been identified as well.) \nEven by those within psychiatry, it has been widely concluded that as\ntools for research, the prevailing classifications are flawed,\nproducing findings tending to be inconsistent, non-replicable,\nnon-specific, or ambiguous, with the categories involved exhibiting\nproblems of construct and predictive validity, as well as imprecise\nphenotypic definitions, widespread heterogeneity, and extensive\ncomorbidity (Cuthbert & Insel 2013; Poland 2014). Reviewing these\nflaws in the classification scheme and the research dependent on it,\nJeffrey Poland and Barbara Von Eckardt conclude that it provides a\nvery poor map of the domain of mental illness, leading to a crisis in\nmental health research practice (Poland & Von Eckardt 2013). \nResearch-related concerns such as these have led to upheavals within\npsychiatry, issuing in new, dimensional criteria by which the research\ndomain is to be approached (Revised Domain Criteria, or RDoC).\nSeparate units of analysis (genes, cells, circuits, self reports,\netc.) are each employed in specific research domains (such as positive\nand negative valence systems, cognitive systems, systems for social\nprocesses, and arousal/regulatory systems), and the intersections of\nunits of analysis with research domains produce segments of a spectrum\nlinking normal and atypical features. Although whether the following\ngoals are entirely compatible has been questioned, the aim here is to\npromote both more accurate research and more effective treatments\n(Cuthbert & Insel 2013; Perring 2016). And while answering some of\nthe concerns about the earlier classificatory model, RDoC has in its\nturn been criticized for, among other features, its conception of\nvalidity; its assumptions about the uniformity of normal\ndistributions; its continuing acceptance of clinical and medical\npresuppositions assigning disorder to the individual rather than the\nbroader social context; and its finding little place for personal\nagency, and assuming a traditional, individualistic and autonomous\nmodel of self challenged by today’s philosophical analyses. (See\nessays in Poland & Tekin 2017.) \nIn partial defense against objections to DSM-type classifications,\nElizabeth Lalumera employs the contrast between conceptions\n(procedures of identifications) and concepts (reference fixing\nrepresentations). Mental disorders may still correspond to\ntheoretically informed concepts, thus far incompletely\nunderstood, and presently known only through descriptive\nconceptions enabling identification practices in diagnosis\nand care (Lalumera 2016). \nDSM-type classification adheres to a classical nineteenth century\ndisease model, whereby each disease is a discretely bounded entity,\nmade up of a symptom cluster emanating from underlying organic states\nor processes within the individual patient. The applicability of each\naspect of this model to mental disorder has been challenged. Some\nwould replace its idea of validity (involving a relation between\nclassificatory name and underlying disease) with the statistical\nconcept of predictive or prognostic validity, which proceeds without\nreference to underlying causes. Rather than discretely bounded, many\ndisorders appear to be continuous with normal states. In an\ninterpretive and definitional choice, over which the data remains\nambiguous, mental disorders arguably represent no more than tails of\nnormal distributions of particular traits in the general population\n(Machery 2017). But the uniformity of these normal distributions has\nalso been questioned (Poland & Tekin 2017). \nSome diagnostic conditions (post-traumatic stress disorder, most\nunarguably) apparently arise from elements of their subject’s\nsurrounding social, economic, and cultural context. Even those with\nmore claim to idiopathic genetic, neurological, or biological causes\nor predisposing factors are recognized to exhibit a course more\nstrongly influenced by environmental than (hypothesized) inherent\nfactors, thus putting pressure on the “common cause”\nhypothesis, whereby a syndrome is explained by a single inherent\nfeature (Borsboom & Cramer 2013). Solely internal, organic states\nand processes, and genes, cannot alone explain all, and probably any,\ndiagnostic disorders. \nExpanding with each new addition, the collection of disorders\nenumerated and described in these classifications has prompted alarm\nover the boundaries of mental disorder, the erosion of normal,\nmentally healthy states and variations, and the inappropriate role\nplayed by medical psychiatry and, finally, science, in dictating norms\nof healthy psychic functioning. Added to narratives critical of\nmodernist science and psychiatry, other philosophical criticisms of\nsuch “medicalization”, emphasize the increasing influence\nof neuroscience in transforming cultural expectations and diminishing\nindividual agency, and the power over psychological norms exhibited by\nthe psychopharmacological industry (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose &\nAbi-Rached 2013; Moncrieff 2008; Sadler 2005 , 2013, Whitaker & Cosgrove 2015;\nValenstein 2002). \nIn contrast to these commonly-voiced apprehensions about\nover-medicalization, there remains the persistent charge of\nunder-diagnosis and under-treatment of those with\ndiagnosable mental disorder, often attributed to stigma, and to the\nsocioeconomic status of under-served communities. Epidemiological\nfindings about the incidence of disorder, as distinct from its\ndiagnosis, are notoriously insufficient (due to self-stigma and fear\nof discrimination, for example, but also to distorting placebo\neffects, and to research methods misleadingly susceptible to false\npositives (Jopling 2009; Horwitz & Wakefield 2007; Poland &\nVon Eckardt 2013)). The actual epidemiological data remains opaque and\nequivocal, leaving these contrary speculations unresolved and likely\nunresolvable.  \nThe DSM and ICD diagnostic classifications have been remarkably\ninfluential worldwide: today, they appear almost immovably permanent.\nBut viewed within their broader moral, political, and social context,\nwhich includes psychiatry’s apparently uneven provision of\neffective treatment, the appropriate stance to adopt towards them, as\nChristian Perring has pointed out, remains critical and skeptical\n(Perring 2016: 87). \nPhilosophers of science have explored whether mental illnesses might\nbe classified as natural kinds, the claim made about particular\ndiagnostic categories or symptom clusters (depression, schizophrenic\ndisorder, and autism, for example), as well as about separate symptoms\n(Cooper 2007; Samuels 2009). Bolstered by recognition that even the\ncategory of biological species would not meet an essentialist\ncriterion for classification as natural kinds, a “homeostatic\nproperty cluster” account of natural kinds has been proposed\n(Ellis 2001; Cooper 2007; Murphy 2007; Samuels 2009). (See entry on\nSpecies.) The expectation here is merely that a natural kind must be\nable to ground explanations and inductive inferences, and enable\neffective human intervention. Linked by shared causal properties such\nas genes, on this view, their homeostatic aspect ensures that property\nclusters making up separate disorders (or symptoms) will remain stable\nenough to behave the same way in response to the same conditions, due\nto a similarity-generating mechanism explaining their co-occurrence.\n(That comparable stability and consequent predictive properties could\narise not from shared causal properties such as genes, but as the\nresult of feedback loops binding symptoms together in stable clusters\nhas also been proposed. See essays in Kincaid and Sullivan 2014.) \nGranted, psychological categories seem to be more like biological\nspecies than like gold, magnesium or atomic particles, for instance,\nin possessing fuzzy boundaries and seeming to rest on continua, rather\nthan forming discrete categorical entities. But the differences have\noften been seen as profound, as three examples will demonstrate. (i)\nSome have taken psychological categories to represent a different\norder of being, as we saw in\n Section 5,\n with its own distinctive forms of causal explanations (Jaspers 1913\n[1963]; Bolton 2008; Wiggins & Schwartz 2011; Kusters 2016). (ii)\nOthers point out that psychological categories can alter, and\neventually even be altered by, the persons they classify, forming\n“interactive” kinds through such looping effects. Indeed,\nmental disorders have been denied the status of natural kinds on\nprecisely the grounds that instability in their properties results\nwhen they have been classified and labeled (Hacking 1995). And in a\nfinal example (iii), some have tried to show that the relation between\nmental illnesses and biological kinds differs according to the role\nplayed by values in establishing the taxa of mental illness (Wakefield\n1992; this claim is discussed in\n §8).\n None of these differences has gone un-criticized. A thoroughgoing\nmind to brain reductionism would reject (i). About (ii), it has been\npointed out that the classification of biological species is also\nsubject to the instability wrought by looping effects. And similarly,\nit has been argued in response to (iii) both that values also enter\ninto the classification of biological species, and that once we reach\nthe categories of interest in this analysis, non-evaluative traits\nform the observable taxa of such species (Cooper 2007). \nBy adopting a thoroughgoing biological reductionism it will be\npossible (although not necessary), to accept as dispositive the\nparallel between psychiatric categories and other categories\nrecognized as natural kinds on non-essentialist definitions. But,\nalthough the diverse ends to which disease taxonomies can be put argue\nagainst finding a single answer about the kind status of mental\ndisorders, focus on the purposes served by disorder language and\ncategories has proven fruitful, here. (i) Mental illnesses have been\nassigned to a category of “practical kinds”, where\nmembership in this class depends on some external criterion that is\npragmatically relevant in the clinical context, such as a certain\ndegree of functional impairment, and remains unrelated to the\nunderlying structure of the kind (Zachar 2014). Along with practical\nkinds, moreover, mental disorders may be further classified according\nto their status as dimensional, discrete, and fuzzy kinds, and there\nis little reason to suppose mental disorders are all of one kind\n(Haslam 2002, 2014). (ii) Whether or not they exhibit the stability\nrequired of classifications into true natural kinds, mental illnesses\ndo possess the properties relevant, and sufficiently stable, to guide\nclinical treatment, as Şerife Tekin illustrates using the lack of\nillness awareness (“insight”) common in patients with some\ndiagnoses. A settled self-conception that involves being mistakenly\nseen as ill can be effectively treated using trust-building strategies\nthat avoid medical language forcing the subject to explicitly\nacknowledge illness (Reimer 2010; Tekin 2016). \nValues have unfailingly played a part in the way mental disorders are\nclassified, conceptualized, experienced as personal diagnosis, and\ntreated. Philosophical accounts fall into evaluativist and objectivist\ncamps, however, according to their allegiance to the possibility of a\nvalue-free science of psychiatry (these are considered in\n §8.1).\n Values also affect societal and personal attitudes towards disorder\nand diagnosis, in ways that are more immediate, considerably more\nurgent, and morally consequential (see\n §8.2).\n Some of these issues are dealt with in bioethical research directed\nspecifically to psychiatry\n (§8.3). \nPresent day conceptions, classifications, and attributions of mental\ndisorder contain many values, some explicit, others implicit, some\nmoral, others non-moral (Sadler 2005, 2013)>. Unacceptable bias has\nbeen repeatedly identified, exemplified in categories such as\nhomosexuality (with its homophobia), pre-menstrual syndrome\n(unwarrantedly assigning disorder status to normal function),\nmasochistic personality disorder (pathologizing misogynist gender\nroles), and oppositional defiant conduct disorders (exhibiting racial\nbias) (Sadler 2005, 2013; Potter 2014; Poland 2014). \nThere is no question that values have played a role in discourse on\nmental disorder. The question remaining is whether moral values are\ninescapably attached to the conceptualization and classification of\nmental disorders at the level of theorizing, forming an inherent part\nof their definition. Such “evaluativism”\n(“normativism”, or “constructivism”) is placed\nin contrast to “objectivism” (“naturalism”),\nwhich seeks a value-free, naturalist account of mental disorder.\nDebates over these questions have dominated philosophical research in\npsychiatry and psychopathology for decades, many played out around\nattempts to define mental disorder in ways that are value-free (see\n §4).\n (Objectivist or naturalist conceptions have implications well beyond\nthese academic debates, it should be added. For example, a related\nsocietal issue with practical consequences concerns the expectations\naround a value-free medicine in those assigning, and subject to,\ndiagnoses, regardless of the facts of the matter.) \nEtymology indicates that “illness” and\n“disorder” contain values (such as the preference for\nhealth over ill-health). The contrast between evaluativism and\nobjectivism reveals nothing distinctive about mental disorder in this\nrespect. But the theory of values based medicine (VBM) emphasizes\nthat, because they are shared, values in the rest of medicine are not\nusually contentious. When VBM is adopted as a treatment approach,\nthese contested values can be acknowledged, and the different\nperspectives supported, and subjected to negotiation (Fulford 2004,\n2014). \nAs was shown earlier\n (§4.4),\n philosophical definitions aiming to avoid all values have been\nproposed, relying on appeal to allegedly value-neutral statistical\nnorms, and adaptive function, respectively. The vulnerability in\nBoorse’s (1997) statistical definition, where normal function is\ndetermined according to the person’s reference class, identified\nby such criteria as age, and sex, lies both with assigning the\nappropriate reference class, a process that inevitably re-introduces\nvalues, and at the point on a continuous distribution curve where\ndeviance from the mean is granted the status of dysfunctional, an\nassessment also involving normative judgments (Bolton 2008).\nRecognizing that a trait may be dysfunctional in evolutionary terms\nwithout being disvalued, and disvalued without being evidence of\ndysfunction, Wakefield’s two-part definition explicitly\naccommodates the evaluative element marking the category. This attempt\nto provide a naturalistic and value free evolution-based account of\n“function” and “dysfunction” has been subject\nto a range of damaging objections, including the claim that biological\ndysfunction is not, as promised, value neutral, carrying as it does a\npreference for evolutionary fitness. Discerning what would be the\nmaximal response in terms of perpetuating the species represents\nanother of these objections, since no agreed-upon conclusion about\nthis can be drawn in a value-neutral, or perhaps any, way. (See Murphy\n& Stich 2000.) \nEvaluativism and objectivism are customarily depicted as incompatible\ncontraries, although the different domains where claims about disorder\noccur (including ordinary usage; conceptually clean versions of\n“health” and “disease”; the operationalization\nof dysfunction, and the justification for that operationalization),\nindicate need for a more nuanced analysis of the role of values in\nhealth and disease (Kingma 2014). The broad contrast between\nevaluativism and objectivism has also been resisted for other reasons.\nJudgments about mental disorder need not be entirely arbitrary and\nsubjective as long as those values are taken to be real features of\nthe world along the lines of McDowell’s secondary property value\nrealism, for example. In this relaxed naturalism, objectivism merely\nmeans requiring no special subject for the disciplining, conception,\nand framing of judgments, and providing a contrast between correct and\nincorrect, or truth and falsity, for the relevant judgments (Thornton\n2007). \nThe present discussion concerns evaluations that are primarily\nnegative, although as we saw earlier, positive evaluations arise in\ntraditions valorizing madness, and many in the neuro-diversity\nmovement insist that autism spectrum and other mental disorders are\nhuman variations analogous to differences of gender, which ought to be\ngranted respectful accommodation, not clinical treatment.(See Chapman 2019, Hoffman 2019.) Negative\nsocial attitudes towards observable disorder have led to stigma,\nself-stigma, and discrimination (Hinshaw 2007). The madman and\nmadwoman have been the subject of fear, misunderstanding,\ndisparagement and condemnation, their failings exaggerated and\nhumanity denied (Gilman 1985). With modernity, care and protection\napparently replaced earlier, moralistic and neglectful arrangements.\n(The reforms’ real effects and costs remain an unsettled matter\nof historical\n debate.[7]\n ) At the same time formal exceptions and protections, such as the\ninsanity defense, recognized mental disorder as an exculpating excuse\nfor wrongdoing and negligence. Despite such attitudinal change,\nhowever, these issues around responsibility remain contentious and\nunresolved (C. Edwards 2009). \nThe effect of diagnoses on those so distinguished has been\ndemonstrated to be extensive, often personally transformative, and\nrarely consistently benign. The extent of these effects has drawn\nresearch attention to first-person report, and to the eloquent madness\nmemoirs increasingly available for study. It has led to theorizing\nwithin formal philosophical writing, and also within the rhetoric of\nsocial movements and identity-focused political interest groups (see\n §10).\n The Recovery movement, for example, stresses the way the self and\nidentity are diminished by diagnosis, eroding and occluding other,\nmore positive, attributes making up the whole person. (See Jacobson\n& Greenley 2001; Pouncey & Lukens 2010; Davidson 2013.)\nCritiques of diagnosis place emphasis on its dehumanizing and\n“objectifying” effects that, multiplied by stigmatizing\nsocietal attitudes about psychiatric labels, engender self-stigma\n(Sadler 2005; Hoffman & Hansen 2017; \nWeiss, Ramakrishna, & Somma 2006; Hinshaw 2009; Thornicroft\n2006; Kendler & Zachar 2015). \nNot only the social and personal effects of diagnosis in individual\nlives and within mental health care, but also the societal face of\npsychiatric care, are achieving belated recognition. Recent data on\nthe effects of the biogenetic explanations regularly accompanying\ndiagnosis of mental disorder advocates for greater attention to these\nattitudes: research findings cannot be read as evidence of embodied\ndefectiveness, with patients reduced to broken mechanisms; instead,\npatients must be brought to be aware that “their agency and\noptimism are not dissolved if their problems have a biological\ndimension” (Haslam & Kvaale 2015: 402–403). \nThe social attitudes and values adopted towards mental disorders,\nadded to features associated with such disorders themselves, have\ngiven rise to a bioethics differing in emphasis from that which\naddresses ethical issues in most of general medicine. Widespread\nstigma about such disorder raises extra privacy and confidentiality\nissues, for example. Because of the powerful and disruptive effects of\nthe experience of disorder, conceptions of disorder, and of its\ntreatment, are often linked to the self and identity of the subject in\ndistinctive ways (Tekin 2011, forthcoming). The perceptual, affective,\nand reasoning disabilities that at least temporarily mark severe\ndisorder are seen to jeopardize the widely-valued traits of rational\nautonomy, responsibility, and coherent and unified personhood, leading\nto challenges over autonomy and decisional capacity (R.B. Edwards\n1997; Radoilska 2012; Sadler, Fulford, & van Staden 2015). And\nmost significant, treatment raises fundamental ethical issues because\nit regularly employs coercive methods. \nThese coercive practices are judged of serious moral concern in recent\npolicy documents. For example, coercive treatment apparently violates\nrights proclaimed by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of\nPersons with Disabilities (2006). Important philosophical issues here\ninclude whether there are person-centered and more paternalist\nprinciples that would respectively obviate, and justify, coercive\ntreatment; how to define coercion; what constitutes valid consent; and\nlinks between coercion and stigmatizing consequences (Kallert,\nMezzich, & Monahan 2011; Cratsley 2019; Pouncey & Mertz\n2019). Recent theorizing addresses “mental disorder\nexceptionalism” (different treatment for mental and physical\nconditions), proposing capacity tests that would apply to everyone\nwith reduced capacity, regardless of cause (Szmukler & Dawson\n2011; Szmukler 2016). \nLooking toward the future, the related, and broader field of neuroethics explores\ndevelopments and prospects in neuroscience possessing increased\nurgency, or distinctive relevance, for psychopathology. (See Bluhm,\nJacobson, & Maibom 2012; Roskies 2007; Glannon 2015; Caruso &\nFlanagan 2018.) For example, encroachment on “mental\nprivacy” can be expected to disproportionately affect those with\nstigmatized disorders and symptoms; and a future can be envisioned in\nwhich the semantic authority of first person symptom descriptions is\nundermined by diagnoses independently verified through imaging or\nother technologies; also, traditionally gendered traits such as\nempathy likely perpetuate bias within neuro-scientific methods and\nfindings (Maibom 2012). More generally, this new knowledge seems\nlikely to foster a trend from the treatment of disorder to its\nprediction based on observed risk factors, which in turn spawns\ninitiatives such as the identification and treatment of early onset,\n“prodromal” conditions in younger subjects (children and\nyouth), likely affecting identity development and self-management\n(Broome, Fusar-Poli, & Wuyts 2013; Whitaker & Cosgrove 2015).\n(See entries on Philosophy of Neuroscience, and Neuroethics.) \nResponsibility concepts, together with those around personhood,\nautonomy, diminished capacity, treatment responses, and individual\nrights, make up an inescapable aspect of the broad field of\npsychiatric ethics that includes part of the more general neuroethics. Two areas of recent\nresearch will serve to illustrate, the first concerning responsibility\nand blame. Attitudes of blame are customarily treated as an\nappropriate sequel to assigning responsibility (Watson 2004). By\nemphasizing the tie between responsibility and (morally-neutral)\nagency, Hanna Pickard uncouples responsibility from blame. At least\nfor the apparently willful behavior of those diagnosed with disorders\naffecting agency, she argues, the proper stance for the care-giver is\ngrounded in an empathic attitude that assigns responsibility without\nblaming, because it is one most conducive to improvement and recovery\n(Pickard 2011). \nClosely related to these philosophical concerns about responsibility\nare issues involving the personality disorders, which, due to their\nlong-recognized relationship to more normal character weaknesses, and\ntheir evidently dimensional nature, sit uneasily within psychiatric\nclassifications (Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Radden 2011; Pickard 2011).\nAmong one DSM grouping (cluster B personality disorders, including\nborderline, narcissistic and antisocial), additional distinguishing\nfeatures have been observed: their symptoms are described using\nmoralistic language. Rather than medical entities, susceptible to\nmedical treatments, they are better approached using persuasion, and\nmethods reminiscent of the “moral treatment” of earlier\ntimes, Louis Charland argues (Charland 2004). \nPhilosophical challenges to customary moral, ethical, and medical\npresuppositions introduced in this section have been influenced by,\nand are difficult to separate from, critiques of medical psychiatry\nduring the second half of the twentieth century that have taken place\nnot only within academe, but also beyond it. These are discussed in\n Section 10. \nThe category of psychosis, employed for extreme states of disorder\naffecting perceptual capabilities (in hallucinations) and reasoning\n(in delusions), are introduced here, followed by a sample of\nparticular disorders among the many that have received philosophical\nattention: addiction, anorexia, psychopathy (anti-social personality\ndisorder), and depression. Philosophical analyses of other diagnostic\ncategories include defiant disorder (Potter 2014), borderline\npersonality (Potter 2009); obsessive compulsive disorder (Glas 2013;\nSzalai 2016); dissociative identity disorder (Braude 1991; Radden\n1996; Worrell & Denham 2016; Maiese 2016); anxiety (Horwitz &\nWakefield 2012), and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism\nspectrum disorder (Baron-Cohen, Lombardo, & Tager-Flusberg\n2013). \nThe severity of hallucinations and delusions, with almost unfailing\nconsequences for their subject in clinical, legal, social,\nand personal settings, serves to distinguish them from many of the\ngeneral controversies about disorder noted thus far. The incidence of\nand pathology associated with hallucinations has been questioned, as\nhas their origins, and phenomenology (Leudar & Thomas 2000;\nRatcliffe 2017; Henriksen, Raballo, & Parnas 2015). And delusions\nhave attracted the particular attention of philosophers for\ntheir incomprehensibility, which challenges standard epistemology and\ntheories about meaning, language, belief, and intention (Coltheart\n& Davies 2000; Bortolotti 2009). They have also been the impetus\nfor important collaborative work between several sciences: in addition\nto being psychiatric disorders delusions occur as symptoms of\nneurological diseases of and injury to the brain, and as such have\nbeen subject to considerable empirical study. Philosophical research\non delusions primarily addresses issues about their intelligibility;\nabout their status in relation to more normal doxastic states; and\nabout explanatory models. \nThe intelligibility of delusions remains contested. Delusions are\nexpressed using unexceptional syntax, and some involve content that,\nwhile inaccurate or implausible, is entirely comprehensible. These,\nJaspers insisted, are secondary delusions; primary delusions, in\ncontrast, are distinguished by their meaninglessness: attributing\nmeaning to them is a misapplication of the hermeneutic approach\n(Jaspers 1913 [1963]; Gorski 2012). Influenced by Wittgenstein, others\nhave adopted the position that all delusions are meaningless\nutterances (Berrios 1991). Findings in brain science have been\nemployed to confirm the latter view. Delusions are hypothesized to\nreflect thought and narrative fragments trapped in the off-line,\ndefault cognitive mode, due to brain activity that prevents processes\nof critical evaluation (Gerrans 2014). In contrast, and following\nFreud, others have stressed that delusions are always comprehensible,\nbut able to be understood only within a context that includes the\nperson’s whole life, ideas and values (Bentall 2004; Wickham\n& Bentall 2016, Mullen & Gillett 2014) \nDelusions are belief-like, but disagreements arise over whether they\nare beliefs, imaginings, some formes frustes of one of these\ntwo, or a distinct hybrid form. The doxastic position (delusions are\nbeliefs) must somehow accommodate that compared to typical beliefs,\ndelusions are not responsive to countervailing evidence, and are only\nweakly behavior guiding. (See entry for Delusions.) Associated more\nwith imagining than with believing, these same features have led to\nthe assertion that delusions are imaginings mistakenly identified as\nbeliefs (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002; Broome & Bortolotti 2009).\nApparently part belief and part imagining, they have also been\nproposed as a new hybrid form on the basis of these contradictory\nelements: “bimagining” (Egan 2009). \nIncreasingly, explanations of delusions are multi-factorial.\nInfluential early models that grew out of research on single-themed\ndelusions resulting from brain damage, such as Capgras, hypothesized\ntwo deficiencies: an initiating aberrant experience or perception due\nto brain dysfunction, combined with some failure of the system of\n“belief fixation” by which initial beliefs are critically\nreviewed in light of other information (Davies et al. 2001; Davies\n& Davies 2009; Young 2011). The second factor in such “two\nfactor” theories is faulty inference, and is on some accounts\ndistinguished by degree alone from common forms of reasoning error such as\nattribution bias (Bentall 2004). On an alternative, “prediction\nerror” model, perceptual aberrations conflict with prior\n(Bayesian) expectations when accompanied by reasoning bias, giving\nrise to delusions (Stone & Young 2007; Mishara & Corlett\n2009). The “polythematic” and complex delusions more often\nseen in the psychiatry clinic, that are partially driven by social and\nenvironmental effects, present significant challenges for cognitive\nscience, since they involve the higher cognitive systems that\napparently resist modular analysis and decomposition. \nPolarized societal attitudes towards responsibility for addictive\nbehavior and towards its disorder status, are mirrored in\nphilosophical analyses and theoretical positions (West 2006; Poland\n& Graham 2011; Flanagan 2017). Accounts that construe addiction as\na disorder reducing responsibility invoke the idea of irresistible\ncompulsion and periodic failures of self-control (Vohs &\nHeatherton 2000). Objections to this “willpower” view\ninclude its being unable to distinguish those who won’t\nfrom those who cannot abstain from using, deficiency from\ndeviance (Foddy & Savulescu 2010; Levy 2013). Added to these\ndifficulties, the phenomenology of addiction is not uniform (Kennett\n2013). \nOthers see addiction as motivated on a standard structure of beliefs\nand desires, with addictive behavior simply reflecting the\nperson’s highest priority (Foddy & Savulescu 2010). Efforts\nto combine these contrary positions propose an interaction between\nsystems that regulate desires and systems that control which of those\ndesires are acted upon (Holton & Berridge 2013). Similarly,\naddicts have been characterized as engaging in a\nmisevaluation that, serving to explain their resistance to\ncontrary evidence, is further reinforced by unthinking and impulsive\nbehavior (Summers 2015; Lewis 2015). Reduced reasons-responsiveness\nand diminished responsibility have also been analyzed in terms of a\ndeficiency of “extended agency”—the ability to\nextend one’s will over time to shape one’s future (Levy\n2006). On another account, addiction can also be understood as disease\nor deficit in terms of an inability to realize vital goals, with\naddicts’ reduced health at least partially caused by mental\ndisposition (Nordenfelt 1995). \nAmong eating disorders, the apparently voluntary self-starvation known\nas anorexia nervosa has been a subject of intense speculation\nand theorizing. Because of its strong gender link, this behavior has\nbeen interpreted as an attempt to exert power by a group (adolescent\ngirls and young women) marked by powerlessness, in a form of extreme,\nperfectionistic self control, creating an alienated,\nunheimlich body (Svenaeus 2013). The role of individual\nagency in these activities, particularly, has been linked to self\nidentity and identity formation (Tan, Hope, & Stewart 2003; Tan,\nStewart, Fitzpatrick, & Hope 2010; Gillett 2009; Morris 2013). The\ndisorder apparently occurs more frequently in settings of Western or\nWesternized, influence and affluence. Implicated as triggers have been\naesthetics around women’s appearance, as well as more general\nWestern moral priorities around self-control, and ethereal, non-bodily\nqualities associated with weightless lightness (Bordo 1993; Giordano\n2005). \nLike other self-harming practices, self starvation has not received\nmedical diagnosis in many historical and cross-cultural contexts,\nwhere explanations instead appeal to the subject’s religious,\nideological, or political motivations. So the motivation of the\nanorexic individual deserves attention, especially her beliefs,\nattitudes and feelings (Giordano 2005; Svenaeus 2013; Morris 2013).\nEfforts to isolate underlying perceptual dysfunction once supposed to\nexplain the anorexic’s attitudes have been unsuccessful (Morris\n2013). A more complex hypothesis, involving interaction between\ndefective “body schemas” (non-linguistic, preconscious,\nbodily representations) that are distorted by, and also generate, the\nanorexic’s attitudes, await the attention of neuroscience. (See\nMorris 2013; Gadsby 2017.) \nIn their apparent failure to recognize the difference between moral\nand merely conventional transgressions, it has been questioned whether\nso-called psychopaths (those diagnosed with antisocial personality\ndisorder) are appropriately held responsible for their attitudes and\nactions (Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Adshead 2013); whether, in seeming to\nhold normal moral beliefs without being motivated by them, they\nprovide a counterexample to motivational internalism; and whether\ntheir observed amygdala dysfunction serves to excuse (Levy 2007).\nPatients with damage to the ventromedial frontal lobe exhibit symptoms\nsimilar to those of the psychopath (Roskies 2003): how similar, is\nquestioned, as is what these patients with “acquired\nsociopathy” show about whether natural psychopaths should be\nexempt from responsibility (Kennett & Fine 2008; Sinnott-Armstrong\n2008). The deficits apparently exhibited by psychopaths (in empathy,\nrationality, and volition, for example) have also been explored for\nthe light they throw on the ingredients of the “moral point of\nview” (Schramme 2014). Treatment approaches critically rest on\nhow these traits are understood (Maibom 2014). For further discussion\nof psychopathy, see entry on Philosophy of Psychiatry. \nSince the humoral theories of earlier eras, mood disorders have been\nstrongly associated with bodily\n states.[8]\n Chief among the several hypotheses about depression challenged by\nphilosophers are appeals to hormonal changes and biology (particularly\nas they would explain depression’s persistent gender link), and\naccounts derived from evolutionary psychology (Varga 2012, 2016; Bluhm\n2011). Related work also emphasizes that explanations of depression\nmust appeal to broader societal structures, rather than individual\nvulnerabilities (Bluhm 2011; Bluhm, Jacobson, & Maibom 2012)). The\nuncertain line between disorders of mood and normal states of distress\nwas discussed earlier\n (§4.2).\n It has prompted contrasting hypotheses about “true”\ndepression, as we saw, including inferences to brain dysfunction\n(Horwitz & Wakefield 2007), and criteria that appeal to a\ndisabling degree of suffering (Bolton 2013). \nFirst person symptom descriptions from memoirs, in-depth case studies,\nand analysis of large data sets, have illuminated the disorder in\nseveral ways: its classification and conceptualization (Hoffman &\nHansen 2017); the relation of affective states to the self (Ratcliffe\n& Stephan 2014; Browne 2018); the disorder status of its\nmood-based phenomenology (Radden 2013); the relation of depression to\nautonomy, and to narrative theories of emotion in treatment contexts\n(Radoilska 2012; Biegler 2011); temporal experience (Fuchs 2001, 2013;\nRatcliffe 2008), and many more. \n“Anti-psychiatry” has come to stand for ideas from\nmid-twentieth century thinkers such as Thomas Szasz, R.D. Laing, and\nMichel Foucault. Many of these involved social and political critiques\nand calls to action, with real-world consequences that have been\nlinked to deinstitutionalization, human rights movements, and a shift\ntowards more autonomy-focused mental health care. In English language\ntheorizing Szasz and Laing rejected the appropriateness of analogizing\nparticular “problems in living” (Szasz) with medical\ndisorders, insisting that misapplication of the medical model to\nmental health was emblematic of the overreach of the medical\nestablishment. The practices and discourses within society and its\ninstitutions making up the era’s episteme are depicted\nhistorically by Foucault, the focus on the exercise of psychiatric\npower that, arising with modern science, is increasingly exerted\nthrough mechanisms of protection, surveillance, and control. With\nmodernity, on this account, power is no longer brute force, instead\ntaking a more diffused and subtle form that imperceptibly disciplines\nand controls not only bodies, but selves (Foucault 1965, Bracken &\nThomas 2010, 2013; Rose 2010; Iliopoulos 2012). Foucault’s\nsweeping ideas remain central to the “post psychiatry” and\n“critical psychiatry” that have emerged during the\nbeginning of the twenty-first century. \nInterwoven with these ideas from the start have been relentless\ncritiques from feminist theory. These include acknowledgment of the\nwomen’s actual, unwarranted, institutionalization, as well as\nemphasis on harms of disempowerment and silencing (Kristeva 1987\n[1989]), and of epistemic injustices (Dotson 2011; Sanati &\nKyratsous 2015; entry on Feminist Social Epistemology). In a legacy\naffecting mental disorder even today, binary conceptualizations have\nassigned women and the feminine to illogicality, emotionality,\nsubjectivity, the bodily, and madness (in contrast to men’s more\nvalued traits) (G. Lloyd 1984; Potter 2009). Earlier feminist thinkers\nfocused on the medicalization of women’s normal traits, as well\nas research neglect and distortion of gender-linked disorders;\nseparate and unequal treatments; the mental health vulnerabilities\nassociated with traditional women’s roles and identities; and\ndiagnosis and treatment understood as tools of patriarchal social\ncontrol (Russell 1995; Ussher 2011).  \nFeminism has consistently rejected traditional causal explanations of\nwomen’s disorder derived from allegedly natural biological\npredispositions, pointing instead to the effects of women’s\noppressive socialization and to the consequences of devaluing\nwomen’s characteristics and abilities (Bluhm 2011). Similarly,\nit has emphasized the embodiment, and relationality, of the self\n(Bluhm, Jacobson, & Maibom 2012). And more recent work, much of it\ninfluenced by social theory and phenomenological approaches, focuses\non the intersection of gender with marginality, invisibility,\nnon-normativity and oppression in lived experience (Nissim-Sabat 2013;\nZeiler & Folkmarson Käll 2014). \nObjections to the modernist presuppositions of psychiatry also take\nissue with the model by which disorder reflects flawed brain\nmechanisms or processes, serving to enhance the status of psychiatry\nand disempower those diagnosed with disorder (Bracken & Thomas\n2005, Iliopoulos 2012). The new brain sciences will magnify this\ndisempowerment, it is argued, with the agency and authority previously\nattributed to persons replaced by a bio-scientific “management\nof the mind” (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose and Abi-Rached 2013). A\nmore recent descendant of mid-twentieth century writing is the\ncollection of concerns known as critical psychiatry: critiques of the\ninfluence of the pharmacological industry (Phillips 1996, 2013; Moncrieff 2008;\nWhitaker & Cosgrove 2015; Valenstein 2002; Karp 2017); a discourse\naround mental disorder that, influenced by hermeneutics, aims to be\nmore sensitive to the meaning of symptoms (Bracken & Thomas 2010);\nand the promotion of a more equal and collaborative relationship\nbetween carers and those they treat (Double 2006; Cohen & Timimi\n2008).  \nAssociated with these ideas, some research appeals to the unique\nexpertise of “service users” or “survivors” in\nanalyses of mental disorder (Faulkner & Leyzell 2000; Gergel\n2012; Cooper 2017). And\nthese innovations have been analyzed appealing to critical theory,\nnarrative research methods, the impediments to representational\nauthority, and the co-production of knowledge (Voronka 2016; Russo\n& Sweeney 2016). \nClaims arising from political movements made up of recipients of\npsychiatric care include the call for a seat at the\npolicy-makers’ table; representational authority based on first\nperson experience of psychiatric symptoms; the complaints of unjust\ntreatment by the “survivors” of diagnosis and care;\nrequests for equality of mental with other disabilities, and or mental\nwith other medical conditions; recognition of neuro-atypicality from\nproponents of a neurodiversity model of disorder (Ortega 2009); and\nfrom “mad pride”, the claim that madness is an attribution\nfrom which to draw strength and cultural identity. Largely neglected\nuntil now within psychiatry or philosophical writing, the claims of\nmad pride have recently been critically evaluated and related to the\nsocial theory of philosophers like Honneth and Taylor (Rashed\n2019). \nWhere might we expect philosophical work on mental disorder to go from\nhere? Certainly, one issue must be what role or roles remain for\ncommonsense psychology. An aspect of this is the tug of war over who\ndecides mental health—society, or science? Ought we be guided by\nthe values around utility sought by modern science? Or should\nricher eudaimonic visions be pursued? Even granted the\nauthority to override science in determining ideals of mental health,\nsociety—and philosophy— still contend with \nissues such as how generously to attribute normalcy, and what might\nlimit thinking in terms of neuro-diversity rather than deficiency, in\nlight of the implications such alternatives hold for traditional\nliberal values around responsibility and the self. We can anticipate\nthat with the ways to verify, understand, and ameliorate mental\ndisorder it promises, neuroscience will not resolve, but instead\naugment and extend questions such as these, perhaps in directions\nbarely dreamed of.","contact.mail":"jennifer.radden@umb.edu","contact.domain":"umb.edu"}]
