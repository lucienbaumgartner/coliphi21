They are what make life\nworth living and sometimes worth ending. So it is not surprising that\nmost of the great classical philosophers had recognizable theories of\nemotions.  These theories typically conceived of emotions as a\nsubject’s phenomenologically salient responses to significant\nevents and as capable of triggering distinctive bodily changes and\nbehaviors. But it is surprising that throughout much of the\ntwentieth-century, scientists and philosophers of mind tended to\nneglect the emotions—in part because of behaviorism’s\nallergy to inner mental states and in part because the variety of\nphenomena covered by the word “emotion” discourages tidy\ntheorizing. In recent decades, however, emotions have once again\nbecome the focus of vigorous interest in philosophy and affective\nscience. Our objective in this entry is to account for these\ndevelopments, focusing primarily on the descriptive question of what\nthe emotions are, but tackling also the normative question of whether\nemotions are rational. In view of the proliferation of exchanges\nbetween researchers of different stripes, it is no longer useful to\nspeak of the philosophy of emotion in isolation from the approaches of\nother disciplines, particularly psychology, neuroscience, and\nevolutionary biology. This is why we have made an effort to pay\nsignificant attention to scientific developments, as we are convinced\nthat cross-disciplinary fertilization is our best chance for making\nprogress in emotion theory.\n\n\nAfter some brief methodological remarks intended to clarify what\ndifferentiates a philosophical approach from a more general cognitive\nscience perspective on the emotions, we begin by outlining some of the\nways researchers have conceived of the place of emotions in the\ntopography of the mind. We will note that emotions have historically\nbeen conceptualized in one of three main ways: as experiences, as\nevaluations, and as motivations. Each of these research traditions\ncaptures something true and significant about the emotions, but no\ntheory within any tradition appears immune from counterexamples and\nproblem cases. Concerning the rationality of emotions, we will\ndistinguish two main varieties of it—cognitive rationality and\nstrategic rationality—and explore a number of ways in which the\nemotions can succeed or fail with respect to different standards of\nrationality.\n\nTwo broad desiderata have governed the project of defining emotions in\nboth philosophy and affective science: (a) Achieving compatibility\nwith ordinary linguistic usage, and (b) Achieving theoretical\nfruitfulness. A definition that aims exclusively at (a) is a\ndescriptive definition. A definition that aims at (b) at the\ncost of possibly violating some ordinary intuitions is\nprescriptive. To secure ordinary language compatibility,\ntraditional philosophers have relied on introspection, thought\nexperiments, casual observation, gleaning of insights from literary\ntexts and other artistic sources, and more recently, experimental\ntests of ordinary intuitions and of the psychological processes\nunderlying them performed within “experimental\nphilosophy”. \nScientists have also been interested in the study of folk emotion\nconcepts, and they have applied to them experimental techniques common\nin the psychology of concepts. These techniques have revealed that\nemotion concepts, like most ordinary concepts, are prototypically\norganized (Fehr & Russell 1984). There are better and worse\nexamples of emotions as ordinarily understood (e.g., fear is a better\nexample of emotion than awe) and there are borderline cases, such as\nboredom: on those, ordinary language users are split as to whether\nthey qualify as emotions. A variety of psychological structures have\nbeen proposed by concept theorists to account for membership in folk\nemotion categories, including similarity to prototypes, exemplars,\nperceptual symbols and others (Fehr & Russell 1984; Wilson-Mendenhall et al.\n2011). \nWhat philosophers and affective scientists aim to offer are\nprescriptive definitions of emotions that preserve as much ordinary\nlanguage compatibility as it is compatible with serving\ninterest-dependent theoretical objectives. One reason why\ntheoreticians are not merely interested in outlining the contours of\nfolk emotion concepts through descriptive definitions is that they\nsuspect that such concepts may include widely diverse items that are\nnot amenable to any robust theoretical generalizations. \nAt first blush, the things we ordinarily call emotions differ from one\nanother along several dimensions. For example, some emotions are\noccurrences (e.g., panic), and others are dispositions (e.g.,\nhostility); some are short-lived (e.g., anger) and others are\nlong-lived (e.g., grief); some involve primitive cognitive processing\n(e.g., fear of a suddenly looming object), and others involve\nsophisticated cognitive processing (e.g., fear of losing a chess\nmatch); some are conscious (e.g., disgust about an insect in the\nmouth) and others are unconscious (e.g., unconscious fear of failing\nin life); some have prototypical facial expressions (e.g., surprise)\nand others lack them (e.g., regret). Some involve strong motivations\nto act (e.g., rage) and others do not (e.g., sadness). Some are\npresent across species (e.g., fear) and others are exclusively human\n(e.g., schadenfreude). And so on. \nThis multi-dimensional heterogeneity has led some to conclude that\nfolk emotion categories do not designate natural kinds, either with\nrespect to the generic category of emotion (Rorty 1980b, 2003; Griffiths 1997;\nRussell 2003; Zachar 2006; Kagan 2007, 2010) or with respect to\nspecific emotion categories such as anger, fear, happiness, disgust,\nand so on (Scarantino 2012; Barrett 2006, 2017). Others have\nargued that there is, nevertheless, enough homogeneity among instances\nof folk emotion categories to allow them to qualify as natural kinds\n(e.g., Charland 2002; Prinz 2004; Zinck & Newen 2008). \nThe concept of a natural kind is itself contentious and\nprobably more suitable for discussing the categories affective\nscientists are interested in, so we will speak of theoretical\nkinds instead, understood as groupings of entities that\nparticipate in a body of philosophically or scientifically interesting\ngeneralizations due to some set of properties they have in common.\n \nWhether folk emotion categories are homogeneous enough to qualify as\ntheoretical kinds has important methodological implications. To the\nextent that they are, the prescriptive definitions of emotions the\ntheorist offers can achieve both theoretical fruitfulness and maximal\ncompatibility with ordinary linguistic usage (in such case,\nprescriptive definitions will also be descriptively adequate). To the\nextent that they are not homogeneous enough, prescriptive definitions\nwill have to explicate folk emotion categories, transforming\nthem so as to increase theoretical fruitfulness while giving up on\nsome degree of ordinary language compatibility (Carnap 1950).  \nTheoretical fruitfulness, however, is conceived differently by\nphilosophers and affective scientists. The former often have as their\nprimary target making sense of the human experience of emotions and\nsometimes to contribute to other projects in philosophy, such as\nexplaining the origins of rational action or moral judgment, or\nshedding light on what makes life worth living, or investigating the\nnature of self-knowledge. Affective scientists, by contrast, are more\nlikely to favor a third-person approach that may be highly revisionary\nwith respect to our first-person self-understanding. And their\nprescriptive definitions are often designed to promote measurement and\nexperimentation for the purposes of prediction and explanation in a\nspecific scientific discipline.  \nIn this entry, we will assess philosophical and scientific definitions\nof emotions in terms of both ordinary language compatibility and\ntheoretical fruitfulness, but acknowledge that the field currently\nlacks clear guidelines for how to strike a proper balance between\nthese two desiderata. \n“Emotion” is a term that came into use in the English\nlanguage in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a translation\nof the French term “émotion” but did not\ndesignate “a category of mental states that might be\nsystematically studied” until the mid-nineteenth century (Dixon\n2012: 338; see also Dixon 2003; Solomon 2008). At the same time, many\nof the things we call emotions today have been the object of\ntheoretical analysis since Ancient Greece, under a variety of\nlanguage-specific labels such as passion, sentiment,\naffection, affect, disturbance, movement, perturbation, upheaval,\nor appetite. This makes for a long and complicated history,\nwhich has progressively led to the development of a variety of shared\ninsights about the nature and function of emotions, but no consensual\ndefinition of what emotions are, either in philosophy or in affective\nscience.  \nA widely shared insight is that emotions have components, and that\nsuch components are jointly instantiated in prototypical episodes of\nemotions. Consider an episode of intense fear due to the sudden\nappearance of a grizzly bear on your path while hiking. At first\nblush, we can distinguish in the complex event that is fear an\nevaluative component (e.g., appraising the bear as\ndangerous), a physiological component (e.g., increased heart\nrate and blood pressure), a phenomenological component (e.g.,\nan unpleasant feeling), an expressive component (e.g., upper\neyelids raised, jaw dropped open, lips stretched horizontally), a\nbehavioral component (e.g., a tendency to flee), and a\nmental component (e.g., focusing attention). \nOne question that has divided emotion theorists is: Which subset of\nthe evaluative, physiological, phenomenological, expressive,\nbehavioral, and mental components is essential to emotion?\nThe answer to this “problem of parts” (Prinz 2004) has\nchanged at various times in the history of the subject, leading to a\nvast collection of theories of emotions both in philosophy and in\naffective science. Although such theories differ on multiple\ndimensions, they can be usefully sorted into three broad traditions,\nwhich we call the Feeling Tradition, the Evaluative\nTradition and the Motivational Tradition (Scarantino\n2016). \nThe Feeling Tradition takes the way emotions feel to be their most\nessential characteristic, and defines emotions as distinctive\nconscious experiences. The Evaluative Tradition regards the way\nemotions construe the world as primary, and defines emotions as being\n(or involving) distinctive evaluations of the eliciting circumstances.\nThe Motivational Tradition defines emotions as distinctive\nmotivational states. \nEach tradition faces the task of articulating a prescriptive\ndefinition of emotions that is theoretically fruitful and compatible\nat least to some degree with ordinary linguistic usage. And although\nthere are discipline-specific theoretical objectives, there also is a\ncore set of explanatory challenges that tends to be shared across\ndisciplines: \nFor example, a viable account of anger should tell us how anger\ndiffers from fear and from non-emotional states (differentiation),\nwhether and how anger motivates aggressive behaviors (motivation),\nwhether and how anger can be about a given state of affairs and be\nconsidered appropriate with respect to such state of affairs\n(intentionality), and whether and how anger involves a distinctive\nsubjective experience (phenomenology). \nWe now consider some of the most prominent theories within each\ntradition, and assess how they fare with respect to these four theoretical challenges and\nothers. As we shall see, each tradition seems to capture something\nimportant about what the emotions are, but none is immune from\ncounterexamples and problem cases. As a result, the most recent trend\nin emotion theory is represented by theories that straddle traditions,\nin an attempt to combine their distinctive insights. Although we begin\nour investigation with William James and will occasionally mention\nearlier accounts, our primary focus will be on theories developed in\nthe last 50 years. \nThe simplest theory of emotions, and perhaps the theory most\nrepresentative of common sense, is that emotions are simply a class of\nfeelings, differentiated by their experienced quality from other\nsensory experiences like tasting chocolate or proprioceptions like\nsensing a pain in one’s lower back. The idea that emotions are a\nspecific kind of subjective experiences has dominated emotion theory\nroughly from Ancient Greece to the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury. \nThis idea can be interpreted in either of two ways. The great\nclassical philosophers—Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Descartes,\nHobbes, Hume, Locke—all understood emotions to involve feelings\nunderstood as primitives without component parts. An alternative idea\nwas first introduced by William James, who argued that scientific\npsychology should stop treating feelings as “eternal and sacred\npsychic entities, like the old immutable species in natural\nhistory” (James 1890: 449). \nJames’ proposal, often labeled as the James-Lange theory because\nit is rather similar to the one offered around the same time by Lange\n(1885), stated that emotions are feelings constituted by perceptions\nof changes in physiological conditions relating to the autonomic and\nmotor functions. When we perceive that we are in danger, for example,\nthis perception directly sets off a collection of bodily responses,\nand our awareness of these responses is what constitutes fear. James\nthus maintained that “our feeling of [bodily] changes as\nthey occur IS the emotion” (James 1884:\n189–190, emphasis in original). \nThe James-Lange theory fared well with respect to the problem of\nphenomenology, in the sense that it replaced the brute phenomenology\nfavored by earlier accounts with a constructivist account of the\n“processes that generate and construct…conscious\nexperiences” (Mandler 1990: 180). This approach has acquired new\nprominence in recent times with the affirmation of the\npsychological constructionist movement in affective science\n (section 8.2). \nBut the James-Lange theory seemed less successful with respect to the\nchallenges of motivation, differentiation and intentionality. First,\nJames stated that common sense is wrong about the direction of\ncausation concerning emotions and bodily changes: a more appropriate\nstatement is that  \nwe feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because\nwe tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are\nsorry, angry, or fearful. (James 1884: 190)  \nThe counterintuitive implication that emotions do not cause their\nmanifestations but rather emerge from them struck many as problematic,\nbecause it seemed to undermine the idea that emotions are important to\nus. How could they be so important, critics like Dewey (1894, 1895)\nasked, if they have no causal import with respect to actions? And why,\none might add, does science not first seek to explain the cause and\nfunction of those original “bodily changes”, namely\nwhy the emotion is elicited in the first place? (Arnold\n1960).  \nFurthermore, the theory lacked an adequate account of the differences\nbetween emotions. This objection was influentially voiced by Walter\nCannon (1929). According to a common interpretation of the James-Lange\ntheory, what distinguishes emotions from one another is the fact that\neach involves the perception of a distinctive set of bodily changes.\nCannon countered that the visceral reactions characteristic of\ndistinct emotions such as fear and anger are indistinguishable, and so\nthese reactions cannot be what allows us to tell emotions apart. \nSubsequent research has not fully settled whether emotions do, in\nfact, have significantly different bodily profiles, either at the\nautonomic, expressive or neural level (for the latest on bodily\nsignatures, see Clark-Polner et al. 2016; Duran et al. 2017; Kragel\n& LaBar 2016; Nummenmaa & Saarimäki forthcoming; Keltner\net al. 2016). Independently of how the empirical debate on bodily\nsignatures is settled, brain or bodily changes and the feelings\naccompanying these changes can get us only part way towards an\nadequate taxonomy. \nAnother major stumbling block for the James-Lange theory is that it\ndoes not yield any insight into emotions’ role in our life as\nrational agents and thinkers. Emotions, however, are capable of being\nnot only explained, but also justified. If someone angers me, I can\ncite my antagonist’s deprecatory tone; if someone makes me\njealous, I can point to his poaching on my emotional property (Taylor\n1975). If emotions were merely feelings, as James suggested,\nit would be difficult to explain why they can be justified in light of\nreasons, just as we would be hard pressed to justify the sensory\nexperience of tasting chocolate or feeling pain in one’s lower\nback. \nTo shed light on the sense in which emotions can be justified requires\na brief detour on the topic of their “object-directedness”\nor “aboutness” or “intentionality”. The first\ndistinction we need to draw is the one between particular\nobjects and formal objects of emotions. As Kenny (1963) first\nemphasized, any X that I can have emotion E\nabout is a particular object of E, whereas the formal\nobject of E is the property which I implicitly ascribe to\nX by virtue of having E about X. \nFor example, the particular object of fear is anything a person can be\nafraid of, whereas the formal object of fear is “that which\nconstitutes danger”, on the assumption that only what is\nevaluated as dangerous can intelligibly be feared. Particular and\nformal objects constitute the two principal aspects of emotional\nintentionality: emotions are object-directed insofar as they\nhave particular objects, and they are fitting insofar as\ntheir particular objects instantiate the formal objects represented by\nthe emotion (see\n section 10.1). \nThe second distinction we wish to draw is that between two types of\nparticular objects of emotions: target objects and propositional\nobjects (de Sousa 1987). The target object of an emotion is the\nspecific entity the emotion is about. For example, love can be about\nMary, or about Bangkok, or about Homer Simpson and so on. These are\nall possible targets of love, and they may be real or imaginary. \nNot every emotion has a target. I may be angry that my life has turned\nout a certain way, without there being any particular\nentity—myself or anyone else—at which my anger is\ndirected. Propositional objects capture facts or states of affairs,\nreal or imagined, towards which my emotion is directed. Conversely,\nnot all emotions have a propositional object. For example, if Mary is\nthe target of my love, there may be no proposition, however complex,\nthat captures what it is that I love about Mary (Kraut 1986; Rorty\n1987 [1988]).  \nFinally, there also appear to be affective states that lack both types\nof particular objects: they are neither directed at a particular\nentity nor are they about a state of affairs captured by a\nproposition. For example, I can be depressed or elated but not\ndepressed or elated about any specific target or fact. These seemingly\nobjectless affective states share many properties with object-directed\nemotions, especially with respect to their physiological and\nmotivational aspects, so we may consider them to be emotions without\nobjects. \nOn the other hand, some have suggested that such objectless states are\nbetter regarded as moods (Frijda 1994; Stephan 2017a). Whether we think\nof seemingly objectless affective states as emotions or moods, we must\ndecide what kinds of objects they lack. Here two main options are\navailable. The first is to assert that some affective states have\nneither particular objects nor formal objects. If we think of moods\nand objectless emotions that way, it becomes hard to explain how such\naffective states may have conditions of correctness—formal\nobjects being among other things descriptions of what the world must\nbe like for the affective state to be fitting (Teroni\n2007). \nIf instead we think of such affective states as having formal objects\nand conditions of correctness, then their objectlessness is only\napparent, because they need to have targets or propositional objects\nof some kind to which they implicitly ascribe the property defined by\nthe formal object. This is the view of moods defended among others by\nGoldie (2000), who thinks moods take the whole world as their object,\nand by Price (2006), who thinks that moods have generic objects but\n“watch out” for particular ones.  \nWhat are the formal objects of specific emotions? This is a\ncontroversial topic, because the ascription of formal objects commits\none to the claim that each emotion, on conceptual grounds, ascribes a\nspecific property to its particular object. This is often identified\nwith one of a number of “core relational themes”\noriginally offered by Richard Lazarus (1991a,b) to explain what sorts\nof evaluations cause emotions, one of the primary concerns of\nappraisal theories in psychology\n (section 6). \nWithin that framework, anger represents slights, fear represents\ndangers, shame represents failures to live up to an ego ideal, sadness\nrepresents losses, happiness represents progress towards goal\nachievement, pride represents enhancement of one’s ego identity\n(Prinz 2004; Lazarus 1991b). Once the formal object of an emotion has\nbeen clarified, we can use it to justify emotions by citing their\nconditions of elicitation. For example, if anger represents slights,\nthen my antagonist’s deprecatory tone can be cited as a\njustification of my anger, because a deprecatory tone instantiates the\nvery property that anger represents. \nEvaluative theories of emotions, a.k.a. cognitive theories of\nemotions, became popular in both philosophy and affective science\nroughly in the 1960s and come in many flavors. A key distinction is\nthat between constitutive and causal evaluative\ntheories. Constitutive theories state that emotions are\ncognitions or evaluations of particular kinds, whereas causal theories\nstate that emotions are caused by cognitions or evaluations\nof particular kinds. The constitutive approach tends to be dominant in\nphilosophy, while the causal approach enjoys significant support in\npsychology. Let us consider these two strands of cognitivism in\nturn. \nThe emergence of the constitutive approach in philosophy in the middle\nof the twentieth century can be traced to a pair of articles by C.D.\nBroad (1954) and Errol Bedford (1957), and a book by Anthony Kenny\n(1963) (see also Pitcher 1965; Thalberg 1964). These authors were not\nthe first to emphasize that emotions are object-directed or endowed\nwith intentionality—Brentano (1874 [1995]) had already done so\nwith inspiration from various medieval authors (King 2010). But these\nmid-twentieth century philosophers were the first to articulate an\ninfluential argument to the effect that, in order to account for their\nintentionality, emotions must be cognitive evaluations of some kind\nrather than feelings (see also Meinong 1894). \nThe argument goes roughly like this. If emotions have intentionality,\nit follows that there are internal standards of appropriateness\naccording to which an emotion is appropriate just in case its formal\nobject is instantiated (Kenny 1963). But feelings are not the kinds of\nthings that can enter into conceptual relations with formal objects.\nSo, to be properly embedded in conceptual relations of this sort,\nemotions need to be or involve “cognitive evaluations” of\nsome kind.  \nWhat kinds of cognitive evaluations? The most parsimonious type of\ncognitivist theory follows the Stoics in identifying emotions with\njudgments. Robert Solomon (1980), Jerome Neu (2000) and Martha\nNussbaum (2001) take this approach. On a common interpretation of\ntheir view, my anger at someone is the judgment that I have been\nwronged by that person. To generalize, the proposal is that an emotion\nE is a judgment that the formal object of E is\ninstantiated (by some particular object X). \nThis theory is often referred to as judgmentalism, but the\nlabel is potentially misleading, because it suggests that for the\ntheory’s proponents an emotion is nothing but a judgment,\nunderstood as an assent to a proposition. This interpretation is\nindeed presupposed by some of the standard critiques of\njudgmentalism. \nFirst, it is argued that judgmentalism does not explain how emotions\ncan motivate, because one can hold a judgment—say the judgment\nthat I have been wronged—without being motivated to act on it.\nSecond, it does not explain the phenomenology of emotions, because\nholding a judgment lacks the bodily, valence and arousal dimensions\nthat typically characterize the experience of emotion. Third, it fails\nto account for the emotions of animals and infants, who arguably lack\nthe capacity of assenting to propositions (Deigh 1994). Fourth, it\ndoes not explain the “recalcitrance to reason” some\nemotions display when they are not extinguished by judgments that\ncontradict them, as when someone judges that flying is not dangerous\nbut continues to be afraid of it (D’Arms & Jacobson\n2003). \nJudgmentalists have tried to address these critiques by clarifying\nwhat sorts of judgments emotions are (and some, like Nussbaum and Neu,\nhave explicitly rejected the label of judgmentalism). It has been\nargued for instance that we should think of judgments as\n“enclosing a core desire” (Solomon 2003: 105–106),\nwhich makes them motivational (e.g., fear encloses the core desire to\nflee). Such judgments are also “dynamic” and able to\n“house…the disorderly motions of emotion” (Nussbaum\n2001: 45), and thus phenomenologically salient; since they involve\npre-linguistic and non-linguistic acceptance of how the world seems,\nthey are available to infants and animals; finally, as they are\ncapable of being held jointly with contradictory judgments, they can\nexplain recalcitrance to reason (Nussbaum 2001). \nSeveral objections have been launched against this strategy. Just to\npick a prominent example among many, it has been argued is that\nexplaining recalcitrance to reason in terms of contradictory\njudgments—judging that p and that\nnot-p—ascribes to agents the wrong kind of irrationality\n(Helm 2001, 2015; see also Döring 2008; Benbaji 2012; Brady 2009;\nTappolet 2000, Faucher & Tappolet 2008a, b). There may be a broader\nproblem at work here, namely that judgmentalists stretch the meaning\nof the concept of “judgment” in an unprincipled way to\naccount for all counterexamples, instead of distinguishing between\nimportantly different types of cognitive states all subsumed under the\nsame heading. \nThe trouble with this elastic strategy is not only that it is\nad hoc, but also that it creates cross-purpose talk and ultimately\namounts to a pyrrhic victory for the evaluative theory, because, on a\nsufficiently expanded notion of judgment, the identification of\nemotions with judgments becomes at best trivially true and fails to\nshed light on what emotions are (Scarantino 2010). \nTwo more promising strategies have been put in place to defend\ncognitivism from counterexamples. The first, which we call the\njudgmentalist add-on strategy (Goldie 2000), consists of\nexplicitly adding on to judgments other components of emotions, rather\nthan embedding them into judgments through the elastic strategy. For\ninstance, the motivational dimension of emotions has been accounted\nfor by suggesting that emotions are not just judgments, but rather\ncombinations of judgments (or beliefs) and desires (Marks 1982; Green\n1992; Gordon 1987). Other authors have added further elements,\nproposing that emotions are combinations of judgments, desires and\nfeelings, a move intended to account for both motivational and\nphenomenological dimensions of emotions (Lyons 1980). \nAnother strategy, which may be called the alternate cognitions\nstrategy, consists of replacing the broad notion of judgment with\na variety of other types of cognitive evaluations that can account for\nthe intentionality of emotions while avoiding some of the critiques\nthat have been raised against judgmentalism. Since most of the action\nin contemporary philosophy of emotions focuses on which alternate\ncognitions are to be preferred, we will devote a whole section to the\ntopic. First, we discuss how the Evaluative Tradition has been\ndeveloped in affective science. \nRoughly around the time when the Evaluative Tradition became popular\nin philosophy, a parallel tradition emerged in affective science\nthrough the pioneering work of Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus. What\npowered this development was in part the cognitivist revolution, the\nintellectual movement that replaced behaviorism in the 1960s and put\nthe cognitive processing of mental representations at the heart of the\nscience of psychology. \nArnold argued that emotion research had neglected to explain how\nemotions are elicited. To shed light on the matter, she introduced the\nnotion of appraisal, the process through which the\nsignificance of a situation for an individual is determined. Appraisal\ngives rise to attraction or aversion, and emotion is equated for\nArnold with this  \nfelt tendency toward anything intuitively appraised as good\n(beneficial), or away from anything intuitively appraised as bad\n(harmful). (Arnold 1960: 171) \nSeveral authors prior to Arnold had acknowledged that emotions must be\nproduced by some sort of cognitive evaluation of the eliciting\ncircumstances, either in the form of a judgment, a thought, a\nperception, or an act of imagination. After all, it is quite clear\nthat the same stimulus can generate different emotions in different\npeople, or in the same person at different times, which suggests that\nit is not stimuli as such that elicit emotions, but stimuli as\nappraised. \nArnold (1960) was the first to subject the internal structure of the\nappraisal process to scientific investigation. Appraisals, she\nsuggested, are made along three primary dimensions: eliciting\ncircumstances can be evaluated as good or bad, present or absent, and\neasy to attain or avoid. For example, the cognitive evaluation that\ncauses fear can be described as the appraisal of an event as bad,\nabsent but possible in the future, and hard to avoid; whereas the\ncause of joy can be described as the appraisal of an event as good,\npresent and easy to maintain. \nBroadly speaking, appraisal theories of emotions are accounts of the\nstructure of the processes that extract significance from stimuli and\ndifferentiate emotions from one another. It is also frequently assumed\nthat appraisal is a dynamic process: appraisals are followed by\nre-appraisals, which follow changes in the environment and in internal\nvariables, and incrementally shape emotions over time. \nIt should be noted that appraisal theories do not properly qualify as\ntheories of what emotions are, even though individual appraisal\ntheorists often articulate such theories as a complement to their\ntheories of the structure of appraisal. More specifically, appraisal\ntheories are in principle compatible with theories of emotions that\nidentify them as evaluations, feelings, or motivations, as long as\nsuch theories acknowledge that appraisals play an essential role in\ndifferentiating emotions from one another. This being said, a great\nmany influential appraisal theorists—including Arnold, Lazarus\nand Scherer—offer theories of emotions that would best fit into\nthe Motivational Tradition. \nScientific theories have significantly developed our understanding of\nthe nature of appraisal, endowing it with even more structure than\nArnold originally envisioned (e.g., C. Smith & Ellsworth 1985;\nFrijda 1986; Lazarus 1991a,b; Roseman 1996; Scherer 2001; Ellsworth\n& Scherer 2003; Roseman & Smith 2001; Oatley &\nJohnson-Laird 1987). \nLazarus (1991b), for instance, introduced six structural dimensions of\nassessment, including (1) goal-relevance, (2) goal-congruence or\nincongruence, (3) type of ego-involvement, (4) blame or credit, (5)\ncoping potential, and (6) future expectancy. For example, guilt is\nassumed to be caused by the appraisal of an event as goal relevant,\ngoal-incongruent, involving a moral transgression, and one for which\nthe self is to blame (coping potential and future expectancy\nappraisals are left open). Lazarus’ own theory of emotions is\nlabeled as cognitive-relational-motivational, because it holds that\n \nemotion is a complex state, an AB, with [appraisal] A as cause and B\nas a combination of an action tendency, physiological change, and\nsubjective affect, (Lazarus 1991a: 819)  \nwhereby the appraisal is not just a cause of emotion but also a part\nof it (see Moors 2013 for a critique of this assumption). \nScherer et al. (2001) distinguished between sixteen dimensions of\nappraisal, labeled Stimulus Evaluation Checks (SECs), which can be\ngrouped into four classes: appraisals of relevance, appraisals of\nconsequences, appraisals of coping potential, and appraisals of\nnormative significance. On Scherer’s component process model,\n \n[e]motion is defined as an episode of interrelated, synchronized\nchanges in the states of all or most of the five organismic subsystems\nin response to the evaluation of an external or internal stimulus\nevent as relevant to major concerns of the organism. (Scherer 2005:\n697)  \nThe five organismic subsystems underlie five emotion components which,\nwhen engaged in coordinated changes, instantiate emotions: an\nappraisal, autonomic physiological changes, an action tendency, a\nmotor expression, and a subjective feeling. In his more recent\ncollaborative work (Moors & Scherer 2013), Scherer has suggested that\nthe point of each stimulus evaluation check is actually to determine\naction tendencies, which would give pride of place to the motivational\ncomponent and make his theory an evaluative-motivational hybrid (see\nalso Scherer & Moors forthcoming). \nA variant of appraisal theories has recently attracted some interest in\naffective computing, an interdisciplinary approach that combines\ninsights from affective science and computer science (see Picard\n1997). This is the Belief and Desire Theory of Emotions (BDTE)\ndeveloped by Reisenzein (2009a,b; see also Miceli & Castelfranchi\n2015). The BDTE holds that emotions are caused by a combination of\ncognitive evaluations (beliefs) and conative motivations (desires),\nwhereas standard appraisal theories postulate cognitive evaluations of\nmotive-congruence, which in effect assesses the degree to which the\nstimulus is congruent with the goals/desires of the agent. \nBDTE’s core thesis is that emotions are elicited by hardwired\nmechanisms whose evolutionary function is to compare newly acquired\nbeliefs with existing desires and existing beliefs, thereby monitoring\nand updating the central representational system of humans (the\nbelief–desire system). For example, suppose you have a belief\nthat your favorite candidate will lose the election and a desire that\nshe win the election (Reisenzein 2009a). Once new information that she\nhas in fact won the election is acquired, a belief-belief-comparator\nsystem produces a belief disconfirmation signal subjectively\nexperienced as surprise, and a belief-desire-comparator system\nproduces a desire fulfillment signal subjectively experienced as\npleasure. This in turn leads to adaptive responses which include a\nrefocusing of attention to the new content that one’s favorite\ncandidate won, the deletion of the belief that one’s favorite\ncandidate was going to lose, and the subjective experience of\nhappiness. \nTo generalize, emotions are for the BDTE combinations of belief\ndisconfirmation/confirmation signals and desire\nfulfillment/frustration signals experienced as, respectively,\nsurprise/expectancy confirmation and pleasure/displeasure, which blend\ninto an emergent experience of a specific emotion (e.g., happiness,\nfear, hope, etc.). These signals are non-conceptual, in the sense that\nthey do not presuppose concept use, and they bring about redirection\nof attention, updates of the belief and desire store, and, when above\nthreshold, distinctive subjective experiences. \nA challenge faced by appraisal theories concerns whether appraisals\nare causes of emotions, entailments of emotions, parts of emotions, or\nsome combination of the above. These questions raise complex conceptual issues we\ncannot address here (see Moors 2013), but they are essential for\nassessing the evidentiary support for appraisal theory. A long-running\ncritique of the research program (Oatley 1992; Parkinson &\nManstead 1992; Parkinson 1997; Russell 1987; Frijda 1993) has been\nthat the self-report evidence commonly taken to support a causal\ninterpretation of the relation between appraisals and emotions only\nsupports a relation of conceptual entailment between them because it\nunveils people’s beliefs about what makes emotions\nappropriate rather than what causes emotions (see\nScherer 2009 for a response).  \nWe mentioned earlier that a popular response to the critiques received\nby philosophical judgmentalism has been the alternate cognitions\nstrategy, intended to better account for their intentionality,\ndifferentiation, motivational power, and phenomenology, as well as\ntheir potential recalcitrance. \nThis has led to a gradual convergence of the Evaluative and Feeling\nTraditions, with the former now identifying emotions as evaluative\nperceptions with a distinctive phenomenology and the latter\nidentifying emotions as evaluative feelings with a distinctive\nintentionality. As a result, the distinction between evaluative (or\ncognitivist) theories and feeling theories is increasingly blurred,\nwith most of the dominant accounts in the philosophy of emotions now\nqualifying as hybrids. \nPerceptual theories come in literal/strong and non-literal/weak\nvarieties (Brady 2013; Salmela 2011). Strong versions generally assume\nthat emotions are genuine forms of perception along the lines of\nsensory perception; weak versions stress key properties emotions share\nwith sensory perception, while also acknowledging important\ndifferences.  \nPrinz’s Neo-Jamesian theory is a good example of a strong\nperceptual theory. For Prinz (2004), we can speak of a bona\nfide perceptual system when we are in the presence of a dedicated\ninput system with specialized transducers and mental representations.\nSensory perception clearly has input systems dedicated to vision,\nolfaction, touch, hearing, and taste. Following in the footsteps of\nDamasio’s (1994, 2003) neuroscientific work, Prinz suggests that\nemotions can also rely on a dedicated system within the somatosensory\nsystem. Thus, emotions literally are perceptions of bodily changes,\neither at the visceral, hormonal, or musculoskeletal levels, or in the\nform of changes in the somatosensory brain areas. \nPrinz adds that emotions are not just perceptions of bodily\nchanges, from which it follows that two emotions can differ from one\nanother despite involving indistinguishable perceptions of bodily\nchanges. For example, fear is not just the perception of “a\nracing heart and…other physiological changes” (Prinz\n2004: 69): it also has a distinctive function—being elicited by\ndanger—and a specific negative valence marker—less of\nthis!—which motivates avoidant action. Since on a teleosemantic\ntheory of representation mental states represent what they have the\nfunction of indicating (Prinz 2004; Dretske 1988), Prinz concludes\nthat perceiving a racing heart can also represents danger insofar as\nit has the function of indicating it (but see Shargel & Prinz\n2018; Robinson 2005). To sum up, subjects literally perceive bodily\nchanges (the nominal content) and indirectly perceive the formal\nobject (the real content) by virtue of the fact that bodily changes\nrepresent formal objects. \nWeak perceptual theories take emotions to be relevantly analogous to\nsensory perception or proprioception. In addition, most take emotions\nto be direct perceptions of formal objects rather than perceptions of\nbodily changes with the function of tracking formal objects. \nAn influential proposal in this vein is offered by Roberts (2003), who\nholds that “emotions are a kind of perception” (2003: 87) in the\nform of concern-based construals. Roberts clarifies that construals\nare “impressions, ways things appear to the subject” (2003: 75)\nand that they are concern-based by virtue of being based on the\nsubject’s desires and aversions. For example, a father’s\nfear that a fire will hurt his daughter is a construal of the fire as\ndangerous based on the father’s desire that nothing bad happen\nto his daughter. \nAlong similar lines, Tappolet (2016) suggests that emotions are\nperceptual experiences of evaluative properties (a.k.a. values) like\ndangerousness (fear) or slights (anger). Some authors add that such\nevaluative properties are not available through any others means, just\nlike color properties are not available except by courtesy of visual\nperception (see, e.g., Johnston 2001). \nTappolet emphasizes that evaluative perception, just like sensory\nperception, is non-conceptual in nature and cognitively impenetrable\n(see also Döring 2007; Döring & Lutz 2015; Goldie 2000;\nTappolet 2000; Goldie 2002; Wollheim 1999; Charland 1995; Zajonc\n2000). This would explain why creatures who do not possess concepts,\nlike animals and pre-linguistic infants, can have emotions, and it\nwould account for emotional recalcitrance, which can be understood\nalong the lines of a visual illusion. As we visually perceive a pencil\nas bent while judging it to be straight, so we emotionally perceive a\ntransparent platform over the Grand Canyon as dangerous while judging\nit to be non-dangerous. \nTappolet (2016) lists additional features that help explain why so\nmany authors have come to think of emotions as perceptions: (a) both\nemotions and perceptions have salient phenomenal properties, (b) both\nare elicited automatically by real or imagined objects, (c) both have\ncorrectness conditions because they represent the world as being a\ncertain way, and (d) both play the epistemic role of providing\ndefeasible reasons for belief (e.g., visual perception for the belief\nthat something is blue, and fear for the belief that something is\ndangerous).  \nThese analogies notwithstanding, several critics have rejected\nperceptual theories of emotions (e.g., Salmela 2011; Dokic &\nLemaire 2013). A prominent critique concerns their inability to\naccount for emotional recalcitrance. For example, Helm (2001) has\nargued that perceptualists have ended up removing the irrationality\nthat is distinctive of recalcitrance. If perceiving a transparent\nplatform over the Grand Canyon as dangerous while judging it to be\nnon-dangerous were just like a visual illusion, then there would be\nnothing irrational about it, as there is nothing irrational in seeing\na pencil as bent while judging it to be straight. But there clearly is\nsome measure of irrationality involved in recalcitrant emotions:\nunlike perceptual illusions, they motivate us to act. In other words,\nthey involve a passive assent which contradicts the active assent\ncaptured by the contradicting judgment. \nSeveral authors have proposed theories that endow feelings with\nintentionality. A notable example is that of Goldie (2000), who\nidentifies the intentionality of emotions with that of feelings\ntowards, which are not just bodily feelings that borrow their\nintentionality from somewhere else, as in Prinz’s account, but\nare instead supposed to have their own, intrinsic intentionality (see\nalso Döring 2007; Pugmire 1998). For example, when I feel fear\nabout slipping on ice, my feeling is towards the ice as being\ndangerous. This sort of feeling is a matter of thinking of the ice\nwith feeling, and cannot be reduced to a combination of a\nnon-intentional bodily feeling and a non-emotional evaluative thought.\nAs Goldie puts it,  \nemotional feelings are inextricably intertwined with the\nworld-directed aspect of emotion, so that an adequate account of an\nemotion’s intentionality…will at the same time capture an\nimportant aspect of its phenomenology. (Goldie 2002: 242; see also\nRatcliffe 2005, 2017)  \nIn a similar vein, Helm (2009: 8) proposes that “emotions are\nintentional feelings of import” which are either pleasurable or\nunpleasant. On Helm’s view,  \n[f]or something to have import to you—for you to care\nabout it—is (roughly) for it to be worthy of attention and\naction. (Helm 2009: 252)  \nThis explains why emotions motivate action: feeling that something is\nworthy of attention and action is being motivated. It also explains\nwhat makes a recalcitrant emotion irrational. By judging a transparent\nplatform over the Grand Canyon as not dangerous and yet fearing it,\nthe subject is judging that what he or she feels is worthy of\nattention and action actually isn’t, thereby undertaking\nevaluative commitments at odds with one another (Helm 2015:\n430–431). \nSome of the views that ascribe intentionality to feelings are inspired\nby the broader research program of representationalism in the\nphilosophy of mind, which is the view that phenomenal properties are\nidentifiable with, or at least reducible to, intentional properties\n(Dretske 1995; Horgan & Tienson 2002). In some variants of\nrepresentationalism, the emotional phenomenology that gets to be\nreduced is merely somatic, in the sense that the feeling is directed\nat bodily events (e.g., Tye 1995). In other variants, the\nphenomenology is much richer, as it comprises somatic, cognitive,\nconative and irreducibly affective components directed at\nparticular and formal objects in the world (e.g., Kriegel 2012). \nAn alternative embraced by some contemporary feeling theorists is to\nargue that emotions are feelings devoid of any intentional objects.\nThe contrary impression is an illusion, deriving from the fact that\nthe feelings we call emotions are typically caused by thoughts with an\nintentional structure with which they are associated in a\n“composite” experience (Whiting 2011; Goldstein 2002). On\nthis view, fear of the ice is a composite mental state consisting of\nan emotion—the objectless feeling of fear—plus a thought\nwith the ice as its intentional object. In themselves, emotions are\nmerely hedonic feelings without intentionality. The grounds claimed\nfor this view are explicitly phenomenological, however, and since most\nresearchers’ introspection appears to deliver the contrary\nverdict that emotions are themselves object-directed, the composite\nview fails to persuade (for a different argument for objectlessness\nbased on social psychology data, see Shargel 2015). \nAnother influential approach in recent philosophy of emotions takes\nthem to be  \nmechanisms that control the crucial factor of salience among what\nwould otherwise be an unmanageable plethora of objects of attention,\ninterpretations, and strategies of inference and conduct. (de Sousa\n1987: xv; see also Elgin 2006; Evans 2001; Ben-Ze’ev 2000)  \nFor example, there are innumerable things I could in principle be\nfocusing on as I find myself face to face with a grizzly bear on a\nhike, but my fear focuses my attention squarely on the bear, on how\nto interpret its movements, and on how to infer and execute an escape\nstrategy. This approach may be taken to have a “perceptual\nflavor” (Prinz 2004: 223) because it describes emotions as\nmechanisms for changing salience, and perceptions can certainly affect\nsalience. But de Sousa aims to draw attention to the broader role\nemotions play in providing the framework for cognitions of both\nperceptual varieties (e.g., what we see and hear) and non-perceptual\nvarieties (e.g., what we believe and remember).  \nSome philosophers suggest that the directive power that emotions exert\nover cognitions is partly a function of their essentially dramatic or\nnarrative structure (Rorty 1987 [1988]). Goldie (2012) offers a\nparticularly subtle examination of the role of narrative in\nconstituting our emotions over the long term. It seems conceptually\nincoherent to suppose that one could have an emotion—say, an\nintense jealousy or a consuming rage—for only a fraction of a\nsecond (Wollheim 1999). One explanation of this feature of emotions is\nthat a story plays itself out during the course of each emotional\nepisode, and stories take place over stretches of time. Interestingly,\nGoldie argues that the narrative structure of emotions is the same\nwhether emotions are experienced towards real or fictional objects,\nwhich explains why we can respond to fictional characters with\nfull-fledged, although motivationally muted, emotional responses (for\na review of other solutions to the so-called paradox of\nfiction, see Cova & Friend forthcoming). \nDe Sousa (1987) has suggested that the stories characteristic of\ndifferent emotions are learned by association with “paradigm\nscenarios”. Paradigm scenarios involve two aspects: first, a\nsituation type providing the characteristic objects of the specific\nemotion-type (where objects can be particular and formal), and second,\na set of characteristic or “normal” responses to the\nsituation, where normality is determined by a complex and\ncontroversial mix of biological and cultural factors. These scenarios\nare drawn first from our daily life as small children and later\nreinforced by the stories, art, and culture to which we are exposed.\nLater still, they are supplemented and refined by literature and other\nart forms capable of expanding the range of one’s imagination of\nways to live (de Sousa 1990; Faucher and Tappolet 2008b). \nOnce our emotional repertoire is established, we interpret new\nsituations through the lens of different paradigm scenarios. When a\nparticular scenario suggests itself as an interpretation, it arranges\nor rearranges our perceptual, cognitive, and inferential dispositions.\nWhen a paradigm scenario is evoked by a novel situation, the resulting\nemotion may or may not be appropriate to the situation that triggers\nit. Thus, a childhood fear of clowns may be reappraised and overcome\nin adult life as a result of a more realistic appraisal. In that sense\nat least, emotions can be assessed for rationality (see\n section 10\n for further discussion). \nThe third tradition in the study of emotions identifies them\nessentially with special kinds of motivational states, where a\nmotivational state broadly understood is an internal cause of\nbehaviors aimed at satisfying a goal. Members of this research\ntradition think that the central problem a theory of emotions needs to\nsolve is explaining how emotions and actions are related, because it\nis ultimately what we do when we emote that produces significant\npersonal and social consequences. \nThe Motivational Tradition was anticipated by many theorists of\nemotions in Ancient Greece and throughout the Middle Ages who\nemphasized the constitutive relation between emotions and behavioral\nimpulses (King 2010), but it finds its first modern precursor in Dewey\n(1894, 1895). Dewey was unhappy with the reversal of common sense\nentailed by the Jamesian idea that emotions are feelings that emerge\nin response to proprioceptions. If we truly were angry\nbecause we strike, Dewey countered, anger could not cause the\nstriking, and this would deprive anger, as well as other emotions, of\ntheir explanatory importance. \nDewey’s main suggestion was that there is a difference between\nthe feeling of anger and anger itself: an emotion “in its\nentirety” is “a mode of behavior which is purposive”\nand “which also reflects itself into feeling” (Dewey 1895:\n15). When we say that someone is angry, Dewey concluded, “we do\nnot simply, or even chiefly, mean that [such person] has a certain\n‘feel’ occupying his consciousness”. Rather,\n“[w]e mean He…has assumed a readiness to act in certain\nways” (Dewey 1895: 16–17). The view that emotions are\nessentially either mechanisms that change one’s readiness to act\nor states of action readiness themselves has since been developed in a\nvariety of ways in affective science and in the philosophy of\nemotions. Let us begin from an influential evolutionary variant of the\nMotivational Tradition in affective science. \nBasic emotion theory emerged in the 1970s from the pioneering work of\nSilvan Tomkins, whose orienting insight was that “the primary\nmotivational system is the affective system” (Tomkins 2008: 4).\nTomkins proposed that there are nine basic or innate affects\ncontrolled by inherited programs: interest, enjoyment, surprise, fear,\nanger, distress, shame, contempt and disgust. Their motivational power\ncomes from their feeling pleasurable or painful, with such hedonic\nfeelings emerging from the perception of facial changes providing\n“motivating feed-back” (Tomkins 2008: 623). \nTomkins’ theory of basic affects was followed by two related\ndevelopments. The first was the birth of modern-day basic emotion\ntheory, with its consuming attention for the universality of facial\nexpressions, present especially in the work of Paul Ekman (Ekman et\nal. 1972; Ekman 1980, 1999a, 2003; Ekman & Friesen 1969) and\nCarrol Izard (1971, 1977, 1992, 2007). The second was the emergence of\nthe evolutionary psychology approach to emotions understood as\nsolutions to recurrent evolutionary problems, with prominent\ncontributions by Plutchick (1980) and Tooby and Cosmides (2008) (see\nalso Shand 1920 and McDougall 1908 [2001] for earlier examples of\nevolutionary theories of emotions). \nStarting in the 1990s, the two approaches have progressively merged,\nalthough evolutionary psychologists are more inclined than basic\nemotion theorists to conclude that a given emotion solves an\nevolutionary problem merely on the basis of plausibility arguments.\nAccording to Ekman (1999a: 46), “emotions evolved for their\nadaptive value in dealing with fundamental life tasks” such as\n \n[f]ighting, falling in love, escaping predators, confronting sexual\ninfidelity, experiencing a failure-driven loss in status, responding\nto the death of a family member. (Tooby & Cosmides 2008: 117; see\nalso Keltner & Haidt 2001) \nThey have adaptive value because they quickly mobilize and coordinate\nresources needed to successfully deal with life tasks, and because\nthey communicate socially relevant information via bodily expressions.\nAs soon as a basic emotion program is activated, a  \ncascade of changes (without our choice or immediate awareness) occurs\nin split seconds in: the emotional signals in the face and voice;\npreset actions; learned actions; the autonomic nervous system activity\nthat regulates our body; the regulatory patterns that continuously\nmodify our behavior; the retrieval of relevant memories and\nexpectations; and how we interpret what is happening within us and in\nthe world. (Ekman & Cordaro 2011: 366) \nFrom this follows the central empirical hypothesis of traditional BET:\nthere should be bodily signatures for each basic emotion consisting of\nhighly correlated and emotion-specific changes at the level of facial\nexpressions, autonomic changes and preset and learned actions. More\nspecifically, Ekman defined basic emotions in terms of (a) distinctive\nuniversal signals, (b) distinctive physiology, (c) distinctive\nthoughts, memories and images, (d) distinctive subjective experiences,\n(e) predictable developmental appearance, (f) homologous presence in\nother primates, (g) automatic appraisals tuned to distinctive\nuniversals in antecedent events, (h) quick onset, brief duration, and\nunbidden occurrence (Ekman 1999a: 5). Some basic emotion theorists\nhave also suggested that basic emotions are associated with\ndistinctive hardwired neural circuits (e.g., Izard 2011; Levenson\n2011; Panksepp 1998, 2000). \nArmed with this definition, Ekman proceeded to argue that we have\nempirical evidence for six basic affect programs (happiness, sadness,\nanger, fear, disgust, and surprise), later on expanding the list to\ninclude states whose basic status is likely to be proven in the future\nsuch as amusement, contempt, embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride\nin achievement, relief, satisfaction, wonder, ecstasy, sensory\npleasure, and shame (Ekman & Cordaro 2011). Scientifically-minded\nphilosophers often restrict their discussions of emotions to the basic\naffect programs, since these are argued to be the only natural kinds\nso far discovered in the affective domain (Griffiths 1997; DeLancey\n2002). \nThe main source of evidence for basic affect programs arguably comes\nfrom cross-cultural studies on facial expressions that use a\nrecognition technique first described by Darwin (1872). It consists of\nshowing pictures of emotional expressions and asking observers what\nemotions they express from a list of six to ten emotion terms in the\nobserver’s language. As reported by Ekman (1999b), experiments\nof this sort have so far been performed with observers from dozens of\ncountries, revealing significant agreement on which emotion is\nportrayed (the recognition rates are strongest for happiness, sadness\nand disgust). This being said, membership to a given culture increases\nrecognition of expressions from that culture, which has led some to\nargue that emotional expressions are a universal language with\ndifferent dialects (Elfenbein et al. 2007). \nIn combination with complementary data on the production of facial\nexpressions (Matsumoto et al. 2008), the recognitional data have been\ntaken to speak in favor of the hypothesis that affect programs are\nevolutionary adaptations producing the same mandatory facial changes\nin all cultures, although culturally specific display rules can\npartially mask such cross-cultural universality. \nThe evidence for universality has been criticized on methodological\nand conceptual grounds. Methodologically, it has been argued that the\nexperiments are defective because they rely on a forced choice\nparadigm which inflates consensus and because they rely on\necologically unrealistic stimuli such as actors’ posed faces\n(Russell 1994). Conceptually, it has been argued that the evolutionary\nhypothesis that selection would favor the production of mandatory\nfacial expressions is implausible, because in conflict situations it\nmay not be in the evolutionary interest of the emoter to let observers\nknow about what emotions they are experiencing (e.g., communicating\nfear during a confrontation). And even if there were universality of\nrecognition and production of emotional expressions, alternative\nexplanations like species constant learning would be able to account\nfor the data (Fridlund 1994). \nAn influential alternative to the Basic Emotions view of facial\nexpressions is the Behavioral Ecology view (Fridlund 1994), which\nreplaces the notion of expressions of emotion with that of\ndisplays produced in an audience-dependent fashion when\nsignalers expect benefits from them. Audience-dependence entails that\nsignalers tailor their context-sensitive facial displays to their\naudience and do not produce them mandatorily upon experiencing a given\nemotion. Displays are rather  \ndeclarations that signify our trajectory in a given social\ninteraction, that is, what we will do in the current situation, or\nwhat we would like the other to do. (Fridlund 1994: 130) \nFor example, what Ekman would describe as an anger face, a sad face or\na happy face is described by behavioral ecologists as, respectively, a\ndisplay of readiness to attack, a display of intent to affiliate and a\ndisplay of recruitment of succor (Fridlund 1994). A number of\ntheorists have argued that Ekman’s and Fridlund’s\napproaches can be reconciled: emotions can at the same time express\nemotions and make declarations that are credible precisely because\nthey are associated with emotions (M. Green 2007; Scarantino 2017;\nHess, Banse, & Kappas 1995; see also Bar-On 2013). \nThe broader problem with traditional BET is that the distinctive\nresponse profiles allegedly produced in cascade-like fashion have not\nbeen convincingly demonstrated either at the level of expressive\nresponses or at the level of autonomic changes, neural changes, preset\nactions or learned actions (Ortony & Turner 1990; Mauss et al.\n2005; Barrett 2006; Lindquist et al. 2012). This lack of clear and\ndistinctive bodily signatures has led to a variety of attempts to save\nBET from empirical refutation. Some basic emotion theorists have\nsuggested, for instance, that basic emotions can be regulated, which\nwould mask their mandatory effects, or that they cannot be elicited at\nthe right level of intensity by laboratory stimuli, or that they often\nmix with other affective and cognitive states in ways that blur their\ndistinctive responses (Ekman & Cordaro 2011). \nOthers have offered new meta-analyses that are more favorable to the\nexistence of emotion-specific biological signatures, especially at the\nlevel of autonomic and neural changes (Kreibig 2010; Stephens et al.\n2010; Nummenmaa & Saarimäki forthcoming). A third option is\nto transition to a New Basic Emotion Theory which replaces the\nassumption of cascade-like responses with that of action tendencies\nwith control precedence, which would account for some of the\nvariability of responses while preserving the core idea that basic\nemotions are geared towards solving evolutionary problems (Levenson\n2011; Scarantino & Griffiths 2011; Scarantino 2015). \nA more radical proposal has been offered by psychological\nconstructionists, who have suggested that we should abandon entirely\nthe “latent variable” model distinctive of basic emotion\ntheory, replacing it with an “emergent variable” model\naccording to which emotions do not cause facial expressions, autonomic\nchanges and preset and learned actions but rather emerge from them\n(Barrett & Russell 2015). Specifically, psychological\nconstructionists have argued that there is no one-to-one\ncorrespondence between anger, fear, happiness, sadness, etc. and any\nneurobiological, physiological, expressive, behavioral, or\nphenomenological responses, and that the different responses allegedly\ndiagnostic of basic emotions are not even strongly correlated with one\nanother. \nPsychological constructionists have concluded that this variability\ncalls into question the very idea that  \nemotions have ontological status as causal entities [and that they]\nexist in the brain or body and cause changes in sensory, perceptual,\nmotor, and physiological outputs. (Barrett 2005: 257)  \nThis view is at the polar opposite of the Motivational Tradition,\nwhich takes emotions to be motives—causal determinants of the\nchanges in outputs we observe. \nIt has also been suggested that the folk psychological categories\ncommonly invoked by basic emotion theorists—e.g., anger, fear,\ndisgust, etc.—are not suitable objects of scientific\ninvestigation, and should be replaced by categories that describe\nemotion components rather than discrete emotions themselves (Russell\n2003; Barrett 2006, 2017). \nConstructionists are convinced that emotions are put together on the\nfly and in flexible ways using building blocks that are not specific\nto emotions, roughly in the way cooked foods are constructed from\ningredients that are not specific to them and could be used according\nto alternative recipes. One of the ingredients out of which emotions\nare built is said to be core affect, which is a  \nneurophysiological state that is consciously accessible as a simple,\nnonreflective feeling that is an integral blend of hedonic\n(pleasure–displeasure) and arousal (sleepy–activated)\nvalues. (Russell 2003: 147) \nPsychological constructionists emphasize that we are always in some\nstate of core affect, which is a sort of barometer that informs us of\nour “relationship” to the flow of events. The readings of\nthe barometer are feelings, understood as blends of\npleasure-displeasure and activation-deactivation. These readings can\nbe represented as points along a “circumplex structure”, with the vertical axis representing the degree of activation-deactivation and the horizontal axis representing the degree of pleasure-displeasure\n(Russell 1980): \nDifferent constructionists describe the way in which emotions are\nbuilt out of core affect and other ingredients in different ways. For\nexample, in Barrett’s influential Conceptual Act View,\nconceptualization plays a key role (Barrett 2006, 2013, 2017; Barrett\n& Satpute 2013). Being afraid amounts to categorizing a core\naffective state of high arousal and high displeasure under the\n“fear” concept. Being happy amounts to categorizing a core\naffective state of high arousal and high pleasure under the\n“happiness” concept. More generally, Barrett (2017) takes\nemotions to be experiences that emerge from the categorization of\nsensations from one’s own body and the world. This view, which\nresembles Schachter and Singer’s (1962) cognition-arousal theory\nand merges themes from the Feeling Tradition and the Evaluative\nTradition, has been criticized for conflating emotions with verbal\nlabeling, for making it impossible for adult humans to mislabel their\nown emotions, and for preventing infants and animals from having\nemotions in the first place (e.g., Scherer 2009, see Barrett 2015 for\na reply). \nRussell (2003) considers conceptualization to affect only the\nmeta-experience of emotion, i.e., the realization that one is\nafraid, and allows emotion episodes to be constructed without the\ninvolvement of categorization. On his view, there are a variety of\nindependent causal mechanisms, rather than any emotion-specific\nmechanism, that explain why there is some degree of correlation\nbetween expressive, autonomic and behavioral changes in emotional\nepisodes, even though it is emphasized that the correlations are much\nweaker than what Ekman’s (1999a) model would predict (Russell\n2012). \nIn recent times, some proposals have been made to integrate\npsychological constructionism with other research programs. Some have\nsuggested that progress lies in merging appraisal theory with\nRussell’s version of psychological constructionism and have\noffered a general theory of how emotional action tendencies are caused\nby the weighing of the expected utilities of action options (Moors\n2017). Others have proposed that we sharply distinguish between the\nphenomenological and the motivational side of affective phenomena,\nhanding out the motivational side of (some) basic emotions to a new\ntheory of survival circuits and reserving folk psychological emotion\nterms to designate feelings exclusively, with the latter understood as\ncognitively constructed (LeDoux 2015, 2017; note the contrast with\nLeDoux 1996).  \nAnother option with some elements of overlap with psychological\nconstructionism is social constructionism. The social constructionist\napproach found its first advocates in the 1920’s when a number\nof anthropologists and social scientists started questioning\nDarwin’s (1872) evidence for the universality of emotional\nexpressions (e.g., Allport 1924; Landis 1924; Klineberg 1940). \nThese researchers initiated what we may call the “cultural\nvariability” strand of social constructionism, related to the\nthesis that emotions are different in several essential respects in\ndifferent cultures. These differences have since been shown with\nrespect to both the emotion lexicon (e.g., Russell 1991; Wierzbicka\n1999) and the diagnostic characteristics of emotions (e.g., Mesquita\n& Frijda 1992; Mesquita & Parkinson forthcoming). \nThe strand of social constructionism that is more germane to the\nMotivational Tradition is the “social role” strand,\nrelated to the thesis that emotions fulfill social functions by virtue\nof which they should be considered actions or roles rather than\npassions (see, e.g., Solomon 1976 and Averill 1990 on the “myth\nof passions”). Jean Paul Sartre (1939 [1948]) can be considered\nthe first to offer a general, although idiosyncratic, theory of\nemotions as social roles, a view developed in the early 1980s by\nphilosophers (e.g., Harré 1986, Armon-Jones 1986),\npsychologists (e.g., Averill 1980), and anthropologists (e.g., Lutz\n1988). In recent times, Parkinson (1995, 2008, 2009), Parkinson,\nFischer, and Manstead (2005), Griffiths (2004), Mesquita and Boiger\n(2014) and Van Kleef (2016) have articulated sophisticated social\nconstructionist accounts that add to the social constructionist\ntradition themes from evolutionary accounts.  \nThere are two main flavors of the Motivational Tradition in\ncontemporary philosophy of emotions. The phenomenological\nversion, articulated by Deonna and Teroni (2012, 2015), assumes\nthat emotions are feelings of action readiness. The\nnon-phenomenological version, articulated by Scarantino\n(2014, 2015) identifies emotions as causes of states of action\nreadiness which may or may not be felt. Both versions agree that the\nfundamental aspect of an emotion is the way it motivates the emoter to\nact. \nDeonna and Teroni argue that both judgmentalist and perceptual\ntheories of emotion make the mistake of identifying emotions in terms\nof content rather than in terms of attitude or\nmode. As Searle (1979: 48) points out, “[a]ll\nintentional states consist of a representative content in a\npsychological mode”. For example, believing and desiring are\ndifferent psychological modes or attitudes, and they each have a\ncontent—respectively, what is believed or desired as captured by\na proposition. \nIf emotions were special kinds of judgments or perceptions, they would\ndiffer from other kinds of judgments or perceptions not in terms of\nattitude but merely in terms of content—what is judged\nor perceived when we emote. Furthermore, the emotions themselves would\ndiffer from one another only in terms of content rather than attitude,\nbecause there would be no attitude specific to, say, anger, shame,\nguilt and so on, but rather a common attitude—the judging\nattitude or the perceiving attitude—towards different contents.\nDeonna and Teroni (2015) think that this approach fails to capture not\nonly what differentiates emotions from one another, but also what\nmakes them special as motivational states. \nAs an alternative, they propose an attitudinal theory of\nemotions. On this view, fear of a tiger is neither the judgment\nnor the perception that there is something dangerous at hand, but\nrather the attitude of taking-as-dangerous directed towards the\ncontent that there is a tiger. What gives emotional attitudes their\ncontent, Deonna and Teroni continue, are their cognitive\nbases, which are the ways in which the content that there is a\ntiger is cognized—e.g., through perception, imagination,\ninference and so on (e.g., the perception that there is a tiger). \nBut what sort of attitude is the one that constitutes an emotion\nrather than, say, a judgment or a perception? Deonna and Teroni\nconsider emotional attitudes to be essentially experiences of feeling\none’s body ready for action. For example, fear of a dog amounts\nto “an experience of the dog as dangerous” insofar as it\nis “an experience of one’s body being prepared” for\navoidance (Deonna & Teroni 2015: 303). Similarly, anger at a\nperson “is an experience of offensiveness insofar as it consists\nin an experience of one’s body being prepared to\nretaliate” (2015: 303). Thus, emotions are felt attitudes of\naction readiness irreducible to non-emotional attitudes and specific\nto each emotion (for a critique of the attitudinal theory, see Rossi\n& Tappolet forthcoming). \nThe starting point of Scarantino’s (2014) Motivational\nTheory of Emotions is the conviction that emotions are\nirreducible not just to judgments and perceptions, but also to\nfeelings, and should be understood instead as special kinds of\n“central motive states” or “behavioral\nprograms”. Central motive states or behavioral programs are\ndefined by what they do rather than by how they feel. And what they do\nis to provide a “general direction for behavior by selectively\npotentiating coherent sets of behavioral options” (Gallistel\n1980: 322). \nThis selective potentiation can result in feelings, but the phenomenal\nchanges are not necessary to the potentiation itself, which consists\nof changes in the probabilities of behavioral options. To exemplify,\nfear involves the selective potentiation of options that share the\ngoal of avoiding a certain target appraised as dangerous, anger\ninvolves the selective potentiation of options that share the goal of\nattacking a certain target appraised as offensive, guilt involves the\nselective potentiation of options that share the goal of repairing a\nrelationship appraised as damaged by actions that fell short of\none’s moral standards, and so on.  \nThe Motivational Theory of Emotions is inspired by Frijda’s\n(1986) theory of emotions as action tendencies, but there are some\ndifferences. Scarantino (2014, 2015) draws a distinction between an\nemotion and an episode of emotion, with the emotion\ncorresponding to what causes a change in action readiness and the\nepisode of emotion corresponding to the actual change of action\nreadiness. But Scarantino borrows a key ingredient from Frijda’s\n(1986) theory, namely the assumption that action tendencies must have\ncontrol precedence to become emotional. Control precedence\ninvolves interrupting competing processes, preempting access—in\nmemory, inference, perception, etc.—to information not related\nto the avoidance goal and preparing the body for action.  \nThe idea that emotions are behavioral programs that bring about\nprioritized impulses to act can be combined with an origin\nstory about how some of such programs evolved to deal with\nfundamental life tasks, leading to what Scarantino (2015) has labeled\nthe New Basic Emotion Theory. According to it, learning can affect\nboth what activates the evolved program (input) and what responses the\nprogram brings about (output) through the interplay of the prioritized\naction tendency and regulation. This will result in massive\nvariability of the actual responses observed upon the activation of\nany basic emotion, shielding the New BET from the lack of\n“bodily signatures” problem. \nFinally, Scarantino (2014) endorses a teleosemantic theory of content\nfor emotions to deal with the problem of intentionality, and proposes\nthat different emotions differ from one another and from non-emotional\nstates both in terms of the state of prioritized action\ntendency they cause (the attitude) and in terms of what they represent\n(the content). On this view, fear is a prioritizing action control\nprogram which represents dangers because it has the function of\ncausing avoidant behaviors in the presence of danger, anger is a\nprioritizing action control program which represents slights because\nit has the function of causing aggressive behaviors in the presence of\nslights, and so on. \nA central challenge for motivational theories of emotions of both\nphenomenological and non-phenomenological varieties is to account for\nthe states of action readiness distinctive of different emotions.\nFirst, many emotions do not appear to motivate action at all. Grief\nand depression, for example, seem to involve a general depotentiation\nof the readiness to act. Second, it is unclear which action tendencies\n“backward-looking” emotions like regret could elicit,\nbecause they focus on what happened in the past, which cannot be\nchanged. Third, emotions like joy involve the selective potentiation\nof a fairly open range of behavioral options, so it is unclear what\naction tendency may be associated with them. Fourth, it seems to be\npossible for the same action tendency to be associated with different\nemotions, and for different emotions to be associated with the same\naction tendency, provided that these tendencies are described at a\nsufficiently abstract level of analysis (for critiques of motivational\napproaches, see, e.g., Reisenzein 1996; Prinz 2004; Tappolet 2010,\n2016; Eder & Rothermund 2013). \nEnactivism is an interdisciplinary research program which begins with\ndissatisfaction with the way cognitive processes have long been\nstudied in cognitive science (Di Paolo & Thompson\n2014; Gallagher 2017). Two enactivist themes in particular are relevant for emotion\ntheory. The first is the focus on the active role played by the\ncognizer in his or her relation with the external world, which is for\nenactivists not given and passively detected but rather\nenacted and actively shaped by the “sense making”\npowers of the cognizer. This “sense making” activity is at\nthe heart of cognition as enactivists understand it, and it is\navailable to all living beings, no matter how simple they may be,\ninsofar as they are autonomous and adaptive systems (Thompson 2007).\n \nThe second theme is the focus on the embodied,\nembedded and extended character of cognitive\nprocesses (the theme of embodiment looms large in affective\nscience as well; see, e.g., Niedenthal 2007; Wilson-Mendenhall et al. 2011; Carr et al. forthcoming).\nWhereas traditional cognitive science and neuroscience have focused on\nthe brain in isolation from the rest of the body and from the\nenvironment, enactivists argue that we will fail to understand\ncognition if we neglect the reciprocal causal interactions between\nbrain, body and environment as they dynamically unfold over time. \nThe idea that complex cognitive abilities can rely on the scaffolding\nprovided by the external environment has proven especially popular\namong emotion theorists. It has led on the one hand to a renewed\nattention to the role played by interpersonal communication in social\nenvironments (Griffiths & Scarantino 2009), and on the other hand\nto the suggestion that emotions are ontologically extended beyond the\nnarrow confines of the cranium (Stephan et al. 2014; Krueger 2014;\nColombetti & Roberts 2015; Colombetti 2017). \nTo which tradition of research do enactivist theories of emotions\nbelong? The focus on experience might appear to nudge enactivism\ntowards the Feeling Tradition (see, e.g., Ratcliffe 2008). Enactivism\nis indeed influenced by the notion, central to the phenomenological\nphilosophical tradition, that the body is an experienced\nstructure (Husserl 1952 [1989]; Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962]) rather than\nsimply a physical structure. And what we can experience\nlimits the world we inhabit, our “Umwelt” (Uexküll\n(1934 [2010]). \nColombetti (2014) has made the case that the phenomenological\ntradition can enrich the affective neuroscience of emotions. Relying\non Varela’s (1996) method of neurophenomenology,\nColombetti has developed a framework for integrating third-person\nmethods like brain imaging with first-person methods like\nself-reports. It is also quite clear that enactivists, in opposition\nto the “disembodied stance” (Colombetti & Thompson\n2008) of many cognitivist theories, view emotions as bodily and\nexperiential processes rather than intellectual ones. \nNevertheless, it is more appropriate to slot the enactivist movement\ninto the phenomenological side of the Motivational Tradition. This is\nbecause enactivists also greatly emphasize the role of action\nin cognition. A number of them have recently offered accounts of\nemotions that emphasize their action-oriented nature (Hufendiek 2016;\nSlaby & Wüschner 2014; Shargel & Prinz 2018). Cognition\nis said to be enacted by inherently teleological living systems for\nthe purposes of action. More radically, some cognitive processes like\nperception are described as constitutively dependent on motoric\nprocesses, as in the sensorimotor theory of visual consciousness\n(Hurley 1998; O’Regan & Noë 2001). \nThere is no unified understanding of the relation between emotions and\naction among enactivists, but rather a number of distinct proposals.\nIn Colombetti’s work, for instance, the notion of\nself-organization plays an orienting role. Her view is that\nemotional episodes are “self-organizing patterns of the\norganism, best described with the conceptual tools of dynamical\nsystems theory”, a branch of mathematics designed to account for\nthe temporal evolution of systems that change over time (Colombetti\n2014: 53; see also Lewis 2005). \nSelf-organization is the capacity of a complex system to reach and\npreserve a state of order through reciprocal causal influences among\nsimpler component parts. When applied to the emotions, the idea is\nthat emotion components self-organize, which helps explain the\nvariability of emotional episodes, because self-organizing systems can\nend up in multiple end states depending on how their components\ninteract (see A. Clark 2001: 113–114). \nAlthough there are analogies between this view and psychological\nconstructionism, especially with respect to the emphasis on emotions\nas emergent and flexible phenomena, Colombetti denies that conceptual\nacts bring about emotions, assuming that “sense making” is\na much more primitive phenomenon available from bacteria to humans.\nCreatures engage in “sense making” when they assess the\nenvironment in terms of whether it promotes their self-maintenance,\nand act so as to improve their viability within the environment, as a\nbacterium does when swimming away from a noxious substance. \nAt the same time, Colombetti uses the assumption of self-organization\nof emotional phenomena to oppose the notion that emotional episodes\nare caused either by affect programs (contra the basic emotion\ntradition) or by appraisals (contra the appraisal tradition).\nIncidentally, Colombetti (2014) thinks that the very notion of basic\nemotion is arbitrary and not worth keeping because it discourages\nresearch on the neural, behavioral, and bodily features of allegedly\nnon-basic emotions. Hufendiek (2016) makes the complementary case that\nallegedly non-basic emotions manifest a great many of the\ncharacteristics distinctive of basic emotions (see also J. Clark\n2010). \nAnother distinctive feature of enactivism is its\nanti-representational stance (Varela et al., 1991; Hutto\n& Myin 2013; Gallagher 2017). For example, Hutto (2012) has proposed that\n“we let go of the idea that emotions represent situations in\ntruth-evaluable ways” (2012: 4), suggesting that emotions do not\nrepresent core relational themes. For instance, fear does not\nrepresent that there is danger at hand, and anger does not represent\nthat there has been a slight against me or mine. Hutto’s (2012)\nmain concern with respect to ascribing representational powers to\nemotions is that such powers are posited despite not having\nexplanatory value (see Hufendiek 2018 for discussion). Specifically,\nHutto (2012) follows Ramsey (2007) in assuming that a mental state\ncounts as a representation only if it is consumed by other systems in\nlight of what it says or indicates, and concludes that emotions fail\nto play this larger explanatory role in the cognitive economy of the\norganism and should therefore not be considered representations. \nPrinz (2004) used to think that emotions represent core relational\nthemes because they have the function of correlating with them, but in\nhis recent work he has changed his mind. Schargel and Prinz (2018)\nhave argued that a teleosemantic approach is a threat to the truly\nembodied character of a theory of emotions in the James-Lange mold,\nthe approach they favor. This is because any non-embodied\nvehicle—e.g., a disembodied judgment—that has the function\nof correlating with a core relational theme would just as well\nrepresent such theme as an embodied vehicle does (Shargel 2014). \nAs an alternative, Shargel and Prinz (2018) embrace a\nnon-representational, enactivist theory of content for emotions,\naccording to which emotions create, by virtue of the bodily\npreparation they involve, action possibilities (see also Griffiths\n& Scarantino 2009; Hufendiek 2016). These action possibilities,\nunlike standard affordances in the Gibsonian tradition, which\npre-exist emotions and are motivationally inert, are\n“state-dependent (they typically arise only once the emotion has\nbeen initiated), and imperatival (they motivate action)”\n(Shargel & Prinz 2018: 119). On this view, fear generates\npossibilities for escape which would not be there in the absence of\nfear, and which work as dynamic attractors, pulling the agent towards\nescape. The enactive content of fear, then, is not danger, but the\npresentation of a certain situation as something to be escaped,\njointly with an impulse to move away from it, a content that is\nessentially embodied since it involves bodily preparation for\nescape. \nA central challenge for enactivist theories of emotions of the\nnon-representational variety is to account for our normative practices\nwith respect to emotions. Once we realize that someone’s fear\nmoved him or her to avoid a certain state of affairs, or that\nsomeone’s anger motivated him or her to attack someone, we still\nask whether or not what motivated avoidance is a danger and whether or\nnot what motivated retribution is a slight. In other words, we still\ntreat emotions as appropriate and inappropriate with respect to their\ncircumstances of elicitation, and it is an open question if and how\nthese forms of appropriateness can be made sense of if emotions do not\nrepresent core relational themes (see Hufendiek 2016, 2017, 2018 for\nfurther discussion). \nWe distinguish between the cognitive rationality of emotions,\nconsisting of their ability to represent the world as it is and\nproperly relate to other evidence-sensitive evaluative processes, and\nthe strategic rationality of emotions, consisting of their\nability to lead to actions that promote the agent’s interests\nand properly relate to other action-influencing processes (De Sousa\n1987, 2011; see also Greenspan 2000; Mulligan 1998; Solomon 1980; Thagard\n2006; Stephan 2017b).  \nEmotions have long been thought to score poorly in terms of both\ncognitive and strategic rationality. The Stoics famously argued that\nemotions are false judgments. For example, fearing a tiger would\ninvolve the false judgment that one’s endangered life is\nimportant, whereas the sage should be indifferent to everything except\nvirtue. Failures of the emotions at the strategic level are also\ndeeply ingrained in both theoretical approaches and common sense.\nIra brevis furor, said the Romans: anger is a brief bout of\nmadness. In recent times, the pendulum has swung back, and researchers\nin both philosophy and affective science have started rehabilitating\nthe emotions in terms of both cognitive and strategic rationality. A\nproper appreciation of the role of emotions with respect to\nrationality requires a number of distinctions. \nOur first distinctions pertain to three varieties of cognitive\nrationality for emotions: rationality as fittingness,\nrationality as warrant and rationality as coherence.\nThe dominant view on emotions is that they are representations of core\nrelational themes or formal objects. Therefore, a first dimension of\nassessment for rationality concerns whether or not such core\nrelational themes/formal objects are instantiated. We may for instance\nsay that fear is rational in terms of fittingness just in\ncase it is directed towards things that are truly dangerous, because\nthis is what fear represents. Being afraid of a shark swimming\nalongside you is fitting, because the shark is dangerous. As\nD’Arms and Jacobson (2000) have emphasized, fittingness is importantly different\nfrom forms of appropriateness that are moral or strategic. For\nexample, amusement at a funny joke may be fitting even if being amused\nby it is both morally inappropriate due to the sexist content of the\njoke, and costly in terms of self-interest, because those who witness\nthe amusement may form a bad opinion of the amused agent. \nSuppose now that fear is elicited by something that is not dangerous.\nFear could still manifest rationality as warrant if its\nparticular object manifests relevant evidential cues of dangerousness.\nFor example, being afraid of a realistic replica of a shark moving\nalongside you in the water would be rational in the warrant sense, even though,\nunbeknownst to you, the shark replica is being remote-controlled by\na group of innocuous marine biologists. \nA third dimension of cognitive rationality concerns the\nconsistency of emotions with other representations of what\nthe world is like. If someone experiences fear of flying and believes\nthat flying is dangerous, there is rationality as coherence between\nwhat they fear and what they believe (even though fear is unfitting\ngiven the extremely low likelihood of plane accidents). \nAs noted in\n section 7.1,\n emotions are often recalcitrant to reason: many people do\nnot believe that flying is dangerous, and yet continue to\nfear it. But emotions manifest rationality as coherence in a great\nmany cases. This is due in part to the fact that emotions have\ncognitive bases, which consist of cognitions whose function\nis to provide emotions with their particular objects—I must\nbelieve, perceive or imagine being on an airplane prior to fearing\nit. \nWhen such cognitions are beliefs, their modification tends to be\ncoherently reflected in changes of the emotions. For example, if I am\nangry at Tom based on my belief that he has bad mouthed me with a\ncolleague, my anger is unlikely to survive the realization that he has\nnot, in fact, bad mouthed me with a colleague. On occasion, however,\nmy anger toward Tom will persist despite my belief that no slight\nwhatsoever has taken place, thereby revealing irrationality as\nincoherence. \nA special case of rationality as coherence regards the coherence of\nsets of emotions. Helm (2009) has argued that emotions come in\nrational patterns centered around the things that have import for the\nagent. For instance, if avoiding death is a concern of mine, then I\nshould not only feel fear when my life is threatened by a deadly disease, but I should\nalso feel, on pain of irrationality, relief once the threat\ndissipates and sadness or disappointment if the disease progresses instead. \nThe strategic (or prudential) rationality of emotions\nconcerns their ability to lead to actions that promote the\nagent’s interests and properly relate to other processes that\naffect actions, notably decision-making. Although emotions that are\nstrategically rational will also generally be cognitively rational in\nthe fittingness and in the warrant sense, exceptions are possible. For\nexample, some instances of anger which are not produced in the\npresence of either actual slights (fittingness) or evidential cues of\nslights (warrant) end up promoting the agent’s interests. A case\nin point may be the anger of a customer whose interests would be best\nserved by returning used merchandise but who has lost the receipt, and\nangrily dresses down a blameless clerk, which gets him the\nsought-after concession because the clerk gets intimidated. \nWe can distinguish two components of strategic rationality: an emotion\nis strategically rational insofar as it leads an agent (i) to select\nmeans conducive to the agent’s ends (instrumental strategic\nrationality) and (ii) to pursue ends that align with the agent’s\ninterests all things considered (substantive strategic irrationality).\nAn example of instrumental irrationality would be that of an agent who\ngets into a panic while trying to exit a house on fire, fails to\nlisten to the fireman’s directions, goes for the closest door\nforgetting that it leads into the only area of the house without an\nexit, and perishes in the process. There is nothing wrong here with\nthe end towards which panic predisposes the agent—seeking\nsafety—but the means chosen are clearly suboptimal. \nSubstantive irrationality can be argued for with respect to both\nemotion types and emotion tokens. For instance, some have proposed that\ngrief is a substantively irrational emotion type, because it\nalways involves the belief that a person dear to the grieving agent is\ndead and the desire that such person is not dead, which is an\nunsatisfiable desire given what one believes (Gustafson 1989; see\nCholbi 2017 for a response).  \nMore commonly, theorists have argued that specific tokens of\ncertain emotion types can be substantively irrational. For example, it\nwould be contrary to an agent’s interests to get angry at a\npotential employer during a job interview, since it will likely result\nin not getting the job offer and thus frustrate self-interest. \nBy contrast, anger at someone cutting the line at the airport can be\nsubstantively rational, since the end of stopping the offensive\nbehavior is conducive to one’s interests. Nussbaum (2016) has\nrecently argued that this can only be the case if the angry\nagent’s focus is not at all on payback for the offensive\nbehavior but entirely on preventing the offensive behavior from\nhappening again, because the desire for payback is either\nstraightforwardly irrational or problematic in other ways (Nussbaum refers to the unproblematic forms of anger as transition-anger). \nA common reason for doubting the strategic rationality of emotions is\nthat they often appear to lead to impulsive physical and\nmental actions. Impulsivity involves acting quickly prior to having\nconsidered all relevant information (Frijda 2010; Elster 1999, 2010).\nSome have argued that this is precisely what helps emotions provide an\noptimal compromise between speed and flexibility, allowing emotions to\nfunction as “decoupled reflexes” (Scherer 1984). \nOthers have noted that emotions often lead to “arational”\nactions, namely emotional actions not performed “for a\nreason” (Hursthouse 1991). Paradigmatic examples include actions\nlike jumping up and down out of joy or rolling around in one’s\ndead wife’s clothes out of grief. In such cases, Hursthouse\nargued, there is no belief and desire pair that can be posited to\nprovide a Humean reason for such actions, which are to be explained\nsimply by saying that the agent is in the grip of an emotion. The\ndebate on arational actions has taken off in recent philosophy of\nemotions, and a number of proposals, both in favor and against\nHumeanism, are available (see M. Smith 1998; Goldie 2000, Döring\n2007; Kovach & De Lancey 2005; Scarantino & Nielsen 2015).\n \nEmotions are notoriously apt to make us act in ways we regret.\nNotably, they can be a source of weakness of the will, the failure to\nact on one’s best reasons (Davidson 1970 [1980]). But they just\nas often help agents stick to their long-term goals (Tappolet 2016:\n227). For example, a gut feeling of guilt may help an agent resist a\ncheating temptation and is in this sense a means to the end of\nsuccessfully exercising self-control. On occasion, emotions can even\nground the phenomenon of inverse akrasia (McIntyre 1990; Arpaly &\nSchroder 2000), which consists in failing to do what you judged best\nonly to discover that you in fact did what was best for you, contrary\nto your former judgment. For example, one may judge best to become a\nprofessional musician, but be crippled by stage fright and end up in\nlaw school, only to later realize that this course of action best\nserves one’s long-term interests. \nA further threat to the strategic rationality of emotions comes from\ntheir relation to self-deception (Fingarette 1969; Mele 1987; van\nLeeuwen 2007), which is commonly regarded as irrational. Roughly,\nself-deception involves forming beliefs that are contrary to what the\navailable evidence supports but conformant to what the self-deceived\nagent desires. Emotions can cause self-deception because they can lead\nto powerful desires that something be or not be the case, which\ncausally impact the subject’s ability to process evidence. \nThis feature is principally related to the fact that emotions\ndetermine salience among potential objects of attention. Poets have\nalways known that the main effect of love is to redirect attention:\nwhen I love, I notice nothing but my beloved, and nothing of his or\nher faults. But this carries a risk, because I may fail to notice that\nthere is massive evidence that I am being deceived in some harmful\nway. My desire that I not be deceived, motivated by my love, is what\ndrives the faulty processing of evidence, resulting in\nself-deception. \nThis potential of emotions for “skewing the epistemic\nlandscape” (Goldie 2004: 259) in negative ways is compensated by\nemotion’s important role in promoting rational epistemic\nthinking. Epistemic emotions are those that are particularly\nrelevant to our quest for knowledge and understanding. Curiosity\nmotivates inquiry; interest keeps us at it, and, as both Plato and\nDescartes noted, doubt is crucial to our ability avoid prejudice.\nThese “epistemic” emotions can guide us specifically in\nthe context of our attempts to gain knowledge (Silvia 2006; Brun,\nDoğuoğlu, & Kuenzle 2008; Morton 2010). \nBut even garden-variety, non-epistemic emotions can promote\nunderstanding of the world and of the self within it (see also the\nfeeling-as-information hypothesis in affective science; Schwarz 2012).\nAccording to Brady (2013), the principal way in which emotions can do\nso is by motivating us to search for information that has a bearing on\nthe fittingness of our emotions, and on the adequacy of their\nunderlying concerns. Once again, the mechanism is that of changing\nsalience among potential objects of attention. Suppose for instance\nyou feel afraid when about to give a toast at a wedding. Your fear\npromotes understanding because it prompts you to determine whether the\nsituation is truly dangerous, and whether you should care that much\nabout giving a brilliant toast. \nMore broadly, it has been argued that the ability of emotions to shift\nattention on some features rather than others provides an essential\nsolution to the so-called frame problem, which is the problem\nof sorting relevant from irrelevant information in decision-making. De\nSousa has made the case in philosophy, suggesting that  \nemotions spare us the paralysis potentially induced by [the frame\nproblem] by controlling the salience of features of perception and\nreasoning…[thereby] circumscribing our practical and cognitive\noptions. (de Sousa 1987: 172)  \nFor example, being afraid of a bear focuses attention exclusively on\nthe features of the situation that are relevant to escaping it,\nwithout wasting time on deciding what irrelevant factors to\nignore. \nDamasio (1994, 2003) has given neurobiological foundations to this\nproposal, suggesting that emotions simplify the decision process by\nquickly marking deliberative options in the prefrontal cortex as\npositive or negative in light of their expected emotional\nconsequences. Patients with ventromedial prefrontal damage, Damasio\nargued, become irrationally Hamlet-like when faced with trivial\ndecisions such as choosing a date for their next doctor’s\nappointment, irrationally risk-prone when faced with gambling\ndecisions, and irrationally impatient when faced with decisions\ndemanding deferred gratification. The debate on whether the empirical\nevidence supports Damasio’s “somatic marker\nhypothesis” is still ongoing (see, e.g., Dunn, Dalgleish, &\nLawrence, 2006; Reimann & Bechara, 2010; Beer 2017). \nAnother influential view on the rationality of emotions is that they\nhelp solve the commitment problem (Schelling 1960;\nHirshleifer 1987; Frank 1988), which is the problem of convincing\npotential cooperative partners that one will fulfill promises and\nthreats even when narrowly self-interested considerations would demand\notherwise. For example, Frank (1988) has described the expression of\nsympathy as a mechanism to convince potential cooperators that one\nwill behave honestly in future interactions even in the presence of\ntemptation, and the expression of anger as a mechanism to convince\npotential cooperators that one will behave aggressively if messed with\neven when aggression is costly. These emotional signals are said to be\ncredible because hard to fake, and they end up benefitting both\npartners, because they help secure the parties’ willingness to\ncooperate honestly in mutually beneficial projects (see also Ross\n& Dumouchel 2004; O’Connor 2016). \nOne may be tempted to conclude from this overview of emotion theories\nacross disciplines that the field is deeply divided on just about\neverything. This would be hasty. Despite the great diversity of views\non the nature and function of emotions we have documented, a broad\nconsensus has emerged on a number of topics. Here is a tentative list\nof what a plurality of emotion theorists agree about, with brief\nmention of where the disagreements begin: \nThe exploration of these insights and the resolution of the\ndisagreements around them is a thriving interdisciplinary project in\ncontemporary emotion theory. Philosophers and affective scientists\nwill continue to engage in it for years to come, putting their\ndistinctive theoretical skills at the service of projects of common\ninterest.

They are what make life\nworth living and sometimes worth ending. So it is not surprising that\nmost of the great classical philosophers had recognizable theories of\nemotions.  These theories typically conceived of emotions as a\nsubject’s phenomenologically salient responses to significant\nevents and as capable of triggering distinctive bodily changes and\nbehaviors. But it is surprising that throughout much of the\ntwentieth-century, scientists and philosophers of mind tended to\nneglect the emotions—in part because of behaviorism’s\nallergy to inner mental states and in part because the variety of\nphenomena covered by the word “emotion” discourages tidy\ntheorizing. In recent decades, however, emotions have once again\nbecome the focus of vigorous interest in philosophy and affective\nscience. Our objective in this entry is to account for these\ndevelopments, focusing primarily on the descriptive question of what\nthe emotions are, but tackling also the normative question of whether\nemotions are rational. In view of the proliferation of exchanges\nbetween researchers of different stripes, it is no longer useful to\nspeak of the philosophy of emotion in isolation from the approaches of\nother disciplines, particularly psychology, neuroscience, and\nevolutionary biology. This is why we have made an effort to pay\nsignificant attention to scientific developments, as we are convinced\nthat cross-disciplinary fertilization is our best chance for making\nprogress in emotion theory.\n\n\nAfter some brief methodological remarks intended to clarify what\ndifferentiates a philosophical approach from a more general cognitive\nscience perspective on the emotions, we begin by outlining some of the\nways researchers have conceived of the place of emotions in the\ntopography of the mind. We will note that emotions have historically\nbeen conceptualized in one of three main ways: as experiences, as\nevaluations, and as motivations. Each of these research traditions\ncaptures something true and significant about the emotions, but no\ntheory within any tradition appears immune from counterexamples and\nproblem cases. Concerning the rationality of emotions, we will\ndistinguish two main varieties of it—cognitive rationality and\nstrategic rationality—and explore a number of ways in which the\nemotions can succeed or fail with respect to different standards of\nrationality.\n\nTwo broad desiderata have governed the project of defining emotions in\nboth philosophy and affective science: (a) Achieving compatibility\nwith ordinary linguistic usage, and (b) Achieving theoretical\nfruitfulness. A definition that aims exclusively at (a) is a\ndescriptive definition. A definition that aims at (b) at the\ncost of possibly violating some ordinary intuitions is\nprescriptive. To secure ordinary language compatibility,\ntraditional philosophers have relied on introspection, thought\nexperiments, casual observation, gleaning of insights from literary\ntexts and other artistic sources, and more recently, experimental\ntests of ordinary intuitions and of the psychological processes\nunderlying them performed within “experimental\nphilosophy”. \nScientists have also been interested in the study of folk emotion\nconcepts, and they have applied to them experimental techniques common\nin the psychology of concepts. These techniques have revealed that\nemotion concepts, like most ordinary concepts, are prototypically\norganized (Fehr & Russell 1984). There are better and worse\nexamples of emotions as ordinarily understood (e.g., fear is a better\nexample of emotion than awe) and there are borderline cases, such as\nboredom: on those, ordinary language users are split as to whether\nthey qualify as emotions. A variety of psychological structures have\nbeen proposed by concept theorists to account for membership in folk\nemotion categories, including similarity to prototypes, exemplars,\nperceptual symbols and others (Fehr & Russell 1984; Wilson-Mendenhall et al.\n2011). \nWhat philosophers and affective scientists aim to offer are\nprescriptive definitions of emotions that preserve as much ordinary\nlanguage compatibility as it is compatible with serving\ninterest-dependent theoretical objectives. One reason why\ntheoreticians are not merely interested in outlining the contours of\nfolk emotion concepts through descriptive definitions is that they\nsuspect that such concepts may include widely diverse items that are\nnot amenable to any robust theoretical generalizations. \nAt first blush, the things we ordinarily call emotions differ from one\nanother along several dimensions. For example, some emotions are\noccurrences (e.g., panic), and others are dispositions (e.g.,\nhostility); some are short-lived (e.g., anger) and others are\nlong-lived (e.g., grief); some involve primitive cognitive processing\n(e.g., fear of a suddenly looming object), and others involve\nsophisticated cognitive processing (e.g., fear of losing a chess\nmatch); some are conscious (e.g., disgust about an insect in the\nmouth) and others are unconscious (e.g., unconscious fear of failing\nin life); some have prototypical facial expressions (e.g., surprise)\nand others lack them (e.g., regret). Some involve strong motivations\nto act (e.g., rage) and others do not (e.g., sadness). Some are\npresent across species (e.g., fear) and others are exclusively human\n(e.g., schadenfreude). And so on. \nThis multi-dimensional heterogeneity has led some to conclude that\nfolk emotion categories do not designate natural kinds, either with\nrespect to the generic category of emotion (Rorty 1980b, 2003; Griffiths 1997;\nRussell 2003; Zachar 2006; Kagan 2007, 2010) or with respect to\nspecific emotion categories such as anger, fear, happiness, disgust,\nand so on (Scarantino 2012; Barrett 2006, 2017). Others have\nargued that there is, nevertheless, enough homogeneity among instances\nof folk emotion categories to allow them to qualify as natural kinds\n(e.g., Charland 2002; Prinz 2004; Zinck & Newen 2008). \nThe concept of a natural kind is itself contentious and\nprobably more suitable for discussing the categories affective\nscientists are interested in, so we will speak of theoretical\nkinds instead, understood as groupings of entities that\nparticipate in a body of philosophically or scientifically interesting\ngeneralizations due to some set of properties they have in common.\n \nWhether folk emotion categories are homogeneous enough to qualify as\ntheoretical kinds has important methodological implications. To the\nextent that they are, the prescriptive definitions of emotions the\ntheorist offers can achieve both theoretical fruitfulness and maximal\ncompatibility with ordinary linguistic usage (in such case,\nprescriptive definitions will also be descriptively adequate). To the\nextent that they are not homogeneous enough, prescriptive definitions\nwill have to explicate folk emotion categories, transforming\nthem so as to increase theoretical fruitfulness while giving up on\nsome degree of ordinary language compatibility (Carnap 1950).  \nTheoretical fruitfulness, however, is conceived differently by\nphilosophers and affective scientists. The former often have as their\nprimary target making sense of the human experience of emotions and\nsometimes to contribute to other projects in philosophy, such as\nexplaining the origins of rational action or moral judgment, or\nshedding light on what makes life worth living, or investigating the\nnature of self-knowledge. Affective scientists, by contrast, are more\nlikely to favor a third-person approach that may be highly revisionary\nwith respect to our first-person self-understanding. And their\nprescriptive definitions are often designed to promote measurement and\nexperimentation for the purposes of prediction and explanation in a\nspecific scientific discipline.  \nIn this entry, we will assess philosophical and scientific definitions\nof emotions in terms of both ordinary language compatibility and\ntheoretical fruitfulness, but acknowledge that the field currently\nlacks clear guidelines for how to strike a proper balance between\nthese two desiderata. \n“Emotion” is a term that came into use in the English\nlanguage in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a translation\nof the French term “émotion” but did not\ndesignate “a category of mental states that might be\nsystematically studied” until the mid-nineteenth century (Dixon\n2012: 338; see also Dixon 2003; Solomon 2008). At the same time, many\nof the things we call emotions today have been the object of\ntheoretical analysis since Ancient Greece, under a variety of\nlanguage-specific labels such as passion, sentiment,\naffection, affect, disturbance, movement, perturbation, upheaval,\nor appetite. This makes for a long and complicated history,\nwhich has progressively led to the development of a variety of shared\ninsights about the nature and function of emotions, but no consensual\ndefinition of what emotions are, either in philosophy or in affective\nscience.  \nA widely shared insight is that emotions have components, and that\nsuch components are jointly instantiated in prototypical episodes of\nemotions. Consider an episode of intense fear due to the sudden\nappearance of a grizzly bear on your path while hiking. At first\nblush, we can distinguish in the complex event that is fear an\nevaluative component (e.g., appraising the bear as\ndangerous), a physiological component (e.g., increased heart\nrate and blood pressure), a phenomenological component (e.g.,\nan unpleasant feeling), an expressive component (e.g., upper\neyelids raised, jaw dropped open, lips stretched horizontally), a\nbehavioral component (e.g., a tendency to flee), and a\nmental component (e.g., focusing attention). \nOne question that has divided emotion theorists is: Which subset of\nthe evaluative, physiological, phenomenological, expressive,\nbehavioral, and mental components is essential to emotion?\nThe answer to this “problem of parts” (Prinz 2004) has\nchanged at various times in the history of the subject, leading to a\nvast collection of theories of emotions both in philosophy and in\naffective science. Although such theories differ on multiple\ndimensions, they can be usefully sorted into three broad traditions,\nwhich we call the Feeling Tradition, the Evaluative\nTradition and the Motivational Tradition (Scarantino\n2016). \nThe Feeling Tradition takes the way emotions feel to be their most\nessential characteristic, and defines emotions as distinctive\nconscious experiences. The Evaluative Tradition regards the way\nemotions construe the world as primary, and defines emotions as being\n(or involving) distinctive evaluations of the eliciting circumstances.\nThe Motivational Tradition defines emotions as distinctive\nmotivational states. \nEach tradition faces the task of articulating a prescriptive\ndefinition of emotions that is theoretically fruitful and compatible\nat least to some degree with ordinary linguistic usage. And although\nthere are discipline-specific theoretical objectives, there also is a\ncore set of explanatory challenges that tends to be shared across\ndisciplines: \nFor example, a viable account of anger should tell us how anger\ndiffers from fear and from non-emotional states (differentiation),\nwhether and how anger motivates aggressive behaviors (motivation),\nwhether and how anger can be about a given state of affairs and be\nconsidered appropriate with respect to such state of affairs\n(intentionality), and whether and how anger involves a distinctive\nsubjective experience (phenomenology). \nWe now consider some of the most prominent theories within each\ntradition, and assess how they fare with respect to these four theoretical challenges and\nothers. As we shall see, each tradition seems to capture something\nimportant about what the emotions are, but none is immune from\ncounterexamples and problem cases. As a result, the most recent trend\nin emotion theory is represented by theories that straddle traditions,\nin an attempt to combine their distinctive insights. Although we begin\nour investigation with William James and will occasionally mention\nearlier accounts, our primary focus will be on theories developed in\nthe last 50 years. \nThe simplest theory of emotions, and perhaps the theory most\nrepresentative of common sense, is that emotions are simply a class of\nfeelings, differentiated by their experienced quality from other\nsensory experiences like tasting chocolate or proprioceptions like\nsensing a pain in one’s lower back. The idea that emotions are a\nspecific kind of subjective experiences has dominated emotion theory\nroughly from Ancient Greece to the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury. \nThis idea can be interpreted in either of two ways. The great\nclassical philosophers—Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Descartes,\nHobbes, Hume, Locke—all understood emotions to involve feelings\nunderstood as primitives without component parts. An alternative idea\nwas first introduced by William James, who argued that scientific\npsychology should stop treating feelings as “eternal and sacred\npsychic entities, like the old immutable species in natural\nhistory” (James 1890: 449). \nJames’ proposal, often labeled as the James-Lange theory because\nit is rather similar to the one offered around the same time by Lange\n(1885), stated that emotions are feelings constituted by perceptions\nof changes in physiological conditions relating to the autonomic and\nmotor functions. When we perceive that we are in danger, for example,\nthis perception directly sets off a collection of bodily responses,\nand our awareness of these responses is what constitutes fear. James\nthus maintained that “our feeling of [bodily] changes as\nthey occur IS the emotion” (James 1884:\n189–190, emphasis in original). \nThe James-Lange theory fared well with respect to the problem of\nphenomenology, in the sense that it replaced the brute phenomenology\nfavored by earlier accounts with a constructivist account of the\n“processes that generate and construct…conscious\nexperiences” (Mandler 1990: 180). This approach has acquired new\nprominence in recent times with the affirmation of the\npsychological constructionist movement in affective science\n (section 8.2). \nBut the James-Lange theory seemed less successful with respect to the\nchallenges of motivation, differentiation and intentionality. First,\nJames stated that common sense is wrong about the direction of\ncausation concerning emotions and bodily changes: a more appropriate\nstatement is that  \nwe feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because\nwe tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are\nsorry, angry, or fearful. (James 1884: 190)  \nThe counterintuitive implication that emotions do not cause their\nmanifestations but rather emerge from them struck many as problematic,\nbecause it seemed to undermine the idea that emotions are important to\nus. How could they be so important, critics like Dewey (1894, 1895)\nasked, if they have no causal import with respect to actions? And why,\none might add, does science not first seek to explain the cause and\nfunction of those original “bodily changes”, namely\nwhy the emotion is elicited in the first place? (Arnold\n1960).  \nFurthermore, the theory lacked an adequate account of the differences\nbetween emotions. This objection was influentially voiced by Walter\nCannon (1929). According to a common interpretation of the James-Lange\ntheory, what distinguishes emotions from one another is the fact that\neach involves the perception of a distinctive set of bodily changes.\nCannon countered that the visceral reactions characteristic of\ndistinct emotions such as fear and anger are indistinguishable, and so\nthese reactions cannot be what allows us to tell emotions apart. \nSubsequent research has not fully settled whether emotions do, in\nfact, have significantly different bodily profiles, either at the\nautonomic, expressive or neural level (for the latest on bodily\nsignatures, see Clark-Polner et al. 2016; Duran et al. 2017; Kragel\n& LaBar 2016; Nummenmaa & Saarimäki forthcoming; Keltner\net al. 2016). Independently of how the empirical debate on bodily\nsignatures is settled, brain or bodily changes and the feelings\naccompanying these changes can get us only part way towards an\nadequate taxonomy. \nAnother major stumbling block for the James-Lange theory is that it\ndoes not yield any insight into emotions’ role in our life as\nrational agents and thinkers. Emotions, however, are capable of being\nnot only explained, but also justified. If someone angers me, I can\ncite my antagonist’s deprecatory tone; if someone makes me\njealous, I can point to his poaching on my emotional property (Taylor\n1975). If emotions were merely feelings, as James suggested,\nit would be difficult to explain why they can be justified in light of\nreasons, just as we would be hard pressed to justify the sensory\nexperience of tasting chocolate or feeling pain in one’s lower\nback. \nTo shed light on the sense in which emotions can be justified requires\na brief detour on the topic of their “object-directedness”\nor “aboutness” or “intentionality”. The first\ndistinction we need to draw is the one between particular\nobjects and formal objects of emotions. As Kenny (1963) first\nemphasized, any X that I can have emotion E\nabout is a particular object of E, whereas the formal\nobject of E is the property which I implicitly ascribe to\nX by virtue of having E about X. \nFor example, the particular object of fear is anything a person can be\nafraid of, whereas the formal object of fear is “that which\nconstitutes danger”, on the assumption that only what is\nevaluated as dangerous can intelligibly be feared. Particular and\nformal objects constitute the two principal aspects of emotional\nintentionality: emotions are object-directed insofar as they\nhave particular objects, and they are fitting insofar as\ntheir particular objects instantiate the formal objects represented by\nthe emotion (see\n section 10.1). \nThe second distinction we wish to draw is that between two types of\nparticular objects of emotions: target objects and propositional\nobjects (de Sousa 1987). The target object of an emotion is the\nspecific entity the emotion is about. For example, love can be about\nMary, or about Bangkok, or about Homer Simpson and so on. These are\nall possible targets of love, and they may be real or imaginary. \nNot every emotion has a target. I may be angry that my life has turned\nout a certain way, without there being any particular\nentity—myself or anyone else—at which my anger is\ndirected. Propositional objects capture facts or states of affairs,\nreal or imagined, towards which my emotion is directed. Conversely,\nnot all emotions have a propositional object. For example, if Mary is\nthe target of my love, there may be no proposition, however complex,\nthat captures what it is that I love about Mary (Kraut 1986; Rorty\n1987 [1988]).  \nFinally, there also appear to be affective states that lack both types\nof particular objects: they are neither directed at a particular\nentity nor are they about a state of affairs captured by a\nproposition. For example, I can be depressed or elated but not\ndepressed or elated about any specific target or fact. These seemingly\nobjectless affective states share many properties with object-directed\nemotions, especially with respect to their physiological and\nmotivational aspects, so we may consider them to be emotions without\nobjects. \nOn the other hand, some have suggested that such objectless states are\nbetter regarded as moods (Frijda 1994; Stephan 2017a). Whether we think\nof seemingly objectless affective states as emotions or moods, we must\ndecide what kinds of objects they lack. Here two main options are\navailable. The first is to assert that some affective states have\nneither particular objects nor formal objects. If we think of moods\nand objectless emotions that way, it becomes hard to explain how such\naffective states may have conditions of correctness—formal\nobjects being among other things descriptions of what the world must\nbe like for the affective state to be fitting (Teroni\n2007). \nIf instead we think of such affective states as having formal objects\nand conditions of correctness, then their objectlessness is only\napparent, because they need to have targets or propositional objects\nof some kind to which they implicitly ascribe the property defined by\nthe formal object. This is the view of moods defended among others by\nGoldie (2000), who thinks moods take the whole world as their object,\nand by Price (2006), who thinks that moods have generic objects but\n“watch out” for particular ones.  \nWhat are the formal objects of specific emotions? This is a\ncontroversial topic, because the ascription of formal objects commits\none to the claim that each emotion, on conceptual grounds, ascribes a\nspecific property to its particular object. This is often identified\nwith one of a number of “core relational themes”\noriginally offered by Richard Lazarus (1991a,b) to explain what sorts\nof evaluations cause emotions, one of the primary concerns of\nappraisal theories in psychology\n (section 6). \nWithin that framework, anger represents slights, fear represents\ndangers, shame represents failures to live up to an ego ideal, sadness\nrepresents losses, happiness represents progress towards goal\nachievement, pride represents enhancement of one’s ego identity\n(Prinz 2004; Lazarus 1991b). Once the formal object of an emotion has\nbeen clarified, we can use it to justify emotions by citing their\nconditions of elicitation. For example, if anger represents slights,\nthen my antagonist’s deprecatory tone can be cited as a\njustification of my anger, because a deprecatory tone instantiates the\nvery property that anger represents. \nEvaluative theories of emotions, a.k.a. cognitive theories of\nemotions, became popular in both philosophy and affective science\nroughly in the 1960s and come in many flavors. A key distinction is\nthat between constitutive and causal evaluative\ntheories. Constitutive theories state that emotions are\ncognitions or evaluations of particular kinds, whereas causal theories\nstate that emotions are caused by cognitions or evaluations\nof particular kinds. The constitutive approach tends to be dominant in\nphilosophy, while the causal approach enjoys significant support in\npsychology. Let us consider these two strands of cognitivism in\nturn. \nThe emergence of the constitutive approach in philosophy in the middle\nof the twentieth century can be traced to a pair of articles by C.D.\nBroad (1954) and Errol Bedford (1957), and a book by Anthony Kenny\n(1963) (see also Pitcher 1965; Thalberg 1964). These authors were not\nthe first to emphasize that emotions are object-directed or endowed\nwith intentionality—Brentano (1874 [1995]) had already done so\nwith inspiration from various medieval authors (King 2010). But these\nmid-twentieth century philosophers were the first to articulate an\ninfluential argument to the effect that, in order to account for their\nintentionality, emotions must be cognitive evaluations of some kind\nrather than feelings (see also Meinong 1894). \nThe argument goes roughly like this. If emotions have intentionality,\nit follows that there are internal standards of appropriateness\naccording to which an emotion is appropriate just in case its formal\nobject is instantiated (Kenny 1963). But feelings are not the kinds of\nthings that can enter into conceptual relations with formal objects.\nSo, to be properly embedded in conceptual relations of this sort,\nemotions need to be or involve “cognitive evaluations” of\nsome kind.  \nWhat kinds of cognitive evaluations? The most parsimonious type of\ncognitivist theory follows the Stoics in identifying emotions with\njudgments. Robert Solomon (1980), Jerome Neu (2000) and Martha\nNussbaum (2001) take this approach. On a common interpretation of\ntheir view, my anger at someone is the judgment that I have been\nwronged by that person. To generalize, the proposal is that an emotion\nE is a judgment that the formal object of E is\ninstantiated (by some particular object X). \nThis theory is often referred to as judgmentalism, but the\nlabel is potentially misleading, because it suggests that for the\ntheory’s proponents an emotion is nothing but a judgment,\nunderstood as an assent to a proposition. This interpretation is\nindeed presupposed by some of the standard critiques of\njudgmentalism. \nFirst, it is argued that judgmentalism does not explain how emotions\ncan motivate, because one can hold a judgment—say the judgment\nthat I have been wronged—without being motivated to act on it.\nSecond, it does not explain the phenomenology of emotions, because\nholding a judgment lacks the bodily, valence and arousal dimensions\nthat typically characterize the experience of emotion. Third, it fails\nto account for the emotions of animals and infants, who arguably lack\nthe capacity of assenting to propositions (Deigh 1994). Fourth, it\ndoes not explain the “recalcitrance to reason” some\nemotions display when they are not extinguished by judgments that\ncontradict them, as when someone judges that flying is not dangerous\nbut continues to be afraid of it (D’Arms & Jacobson\n2003). \nJudgmentalists have tried to address these critiques by clarifying\nwhat sorts of judgments emotions are (and some, like Nussbaum and Neu,\nhave explicitly rejected the label of judgmentalism). It has been\nargued for instance that we should think of judgments as\n“enclosing a core desire” (Solomon 2003: 105–106),\nwhich makes them motivational (e.g., fear encloses the core desire to\nflee). Such judgments are also “dynamic” and able to\n“house…the disorderly motions of emotion” (Nussbaum\n2001: 45), and thus phenomenologically salient; since they involve\npre-linguistic and non-linguistic acceptance of how the world seems,\nthey are available to infants and animals; finally, as they are\ncapable of being held jointly with contradictory judgments, they can\nexplain recalcitrance to reason (Nussbaum 2001). \nSeveral objections have been launched against this strategy. Just to\npick a prominent example among many, it has been argued is that\nexplaining recalcitrance to reason in terms of contradictory\njudgments—judging that p and that\nnot-p—ascribes to agents the wrong kind of irrationality\n(Helm 2001, 2015; see also Döring 2008; Benbaji 2012; Brady 2009;\nTappolet 2000, Faucher & Tappolet 2008a, b). There may be a broader\nproblem at work here, namely that judgmentalists stretch the meaning\nof the concept of “judgment” in an unprincipled way to\naccount for all counterexamples, instead of distinguishing between\nimportantly different types of cognitive states all subsumed under the\nsame heading. \nThe trouble with this elastic strategy is not only that it is\nad hoc, but also that it creates cross-purpose talk and ultimately\namounts to a pyrrhic victory for the evaluative theory, because, on a\nsufficiently expanded notion of judgment, the identification of\nemotions with judgments becomes at best trivially true and fails to\nshed light on what emotions are (Scarantino 2010). \nTwo more promising strategies have been put in place to defend\ncognitivism from counterexamples. The first, which we call the\njudgmentalist add-on strategy (Goldie 2000), consists of\nexplicitly adding on to judgments other components of emotions, rather\nthan embedding them into judgments through the elastic strategy. For\ninstance, the motivational dimension of emotions has been accounted\nfor by suggesting that emotions are not just judgments, but rather\ncombinations of judgments (or beliefs) and desires (Marks 1982; Green\n1992; Gordon 1987). Other authors have added further elements,\nproposing that emotions are combinations of judgments, desires and\nfeelings, a move intended to account for both motivational and\nphenomenological dimensions of emotions (Lyons 1980). \nAnother strategy, which may be called the alternate cognitions\nstrategy, consists of replacing the broad notion of judgment with\na variety of other types of cognitive evaluations that can account for\nthe intentionality of emotions while avoiding some of the critiques\nthat have been raised against judgmentalism. Since most of the action\nin contemporary philosophy of emotions focuses on which alternate\ncognitions are to be preferred, we will devote a whole section to the\ntopic. First, we discuss how the Evaluative Tradition has been\ndeveloped in affective science. \nRoughly around the time when the Evaluative Tradition became popular\nin philosophy, a parallel tradition emerged in affective science\nthrough the pioneering work of Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus. What\npowered this development was in part the cognitivist revolution, the\nintellectual movement that replaced behaviorism in the 1960s and put\nthe cognitive processing of mental representations at the heart of the\nscience of psychology. \nArnold argued that emotion research had neglected to explain how\nemotions are elicited. To shed light on the matter, she introduced the\nnotion of appraisal, the process through which the\nsignificance of a situation for an individual is determined. Appraisal\ngives rise to attraction or aversion, and emotion is equated for\nArnold with this  \nfelt tendency toward anything intuitively appraised as good\n(beneficial), or away from anything intuitively appraised as bad\n(harmful). (Arnold 1960: 171) \nSeveral authors prior to Arnold had acknowledged that emotions must be\nproduced by some sort of cognitive evaluation of the eliciting\ncircumstances, either in the form of a judgment, a thought, a\nperception, or an act of imagination. After all, it is quite clear\nthat the same stimulus can generate different emotions in different\npeople, or in the same person at different times, which suggests that\nit is not stimuli as such that elicit emotions, but stimuli as\nappraised. \nArnold (1960) was the first to subject the internal structure of the\nappraisal process to scientific investigation. Appraisals, she\nsuggested, are made along three primary dimensions: eliciting\ncircumstances can be evaluated as good or bad, present or absent, and\neasy to attain or avoid. For example, the cognitive evaluation that\ncauses fear can be described as the appraisal of an event as bad,\nabsent but possible in the future, and hard to avoid; whereas the\ncause of joy can be described as the appraisal of an event as good,\npresent and easy to maintain. \nBroadly speaking, appraisal theories of emotions are accounts of the\nstructure of the processes that extract significance from stimuli and\ndifferentiate emotions from one another. It is also frequently assumed\nthat appraisal is a dynamic process: appraisals are followed by\nre-appraisals, which follow changes in the environment and in internal\nvariables, and incrementally shape emotions over time. \nIt should be noted that appraisal theories do not properly qualify as\ntheories of what emotions are, even though individual appraisal\ntheorists often articulate such theories as a complement to their\ntheories of the structure of appraisal. More specifically, appraisal\ntheories are in principle compatible with theories of emotions that\nidentify them as evaluations, feelings, or motivations, as long as\nsuch theories acknowledge that appraisals play an essential role in\ndifferentiating emotions from one another. This being said, a great\nmany influential appraisal theorists—including Arnold, Lazarus\nand Scherer—offer theories of emotions that would best fit into\nthe Motivational Tradition. \nScientific theories have significantly developed our understanding of\nthe nature of appraisal, endowing it with even more structure than\nArnold originally envisioned (e.g., C. Smith & Ellsworth 1985;\nFrijda 1986; Lazarus 1991a,b; Roseman 1996; Scherer 2001; Ellsworth\n& Scherer 2003; Roseman & Smith 2001; Oatley &\nJohnson-Laird 1987). \nLazarus (1991b), for instance, introduced six structural dimensions of\nassessment, including (1) goal-relevance, (2) goal-congruence or\nincongruence, (3) type of ego-involvement, (4) blame or credit, (5)\ncoping potential, and (6) future expectancy. For example, guilt is\nassumed to be caused by the appraisal of an event as goal relevant,\ngoal-incongruent, involving a moral transgression, and one for which\nthe self is to blame (coping potential and future expectancy\nappraisals are left open). Lazarus’ own theory of emotions is\nlabeled as cognitive-relational-motivational, because it holds that\n \nemotion is a complex state, an AB, with [appraisal] A as cause and B\nas a combination of an action tendency, physiological change, and\nsubjective affect, (Lazarus 1991a: 819)  \nwhereby the appraisal is not just a cause of emotion but also a part\nof it (see Moors 2013 for a critique of this assumption). \nScherer et al. (2001) distinguished between sixteen dimensions of\nappraisal, labeled Stimulus Evaluation Checks (SECs), which can be\ngrouped into four classes: appraisals of relevance, appraisals of\nconsequences, appraisals of coping potential, and appraisals of\nnormative significance. On Scherer’s component process model,\n \n[e]motion is defined as an episode of interrelated, synchronized\nchanges in the states of all or most of the five organismic subsystems\nin response to the evaluation of an external or internal stimulus\nevent as relevant to major concerns of the organism. (Scherer 2005:\n697)  \nThe five organismic subsystems underlie five emotion components which,\nwhen engaged in coordinated changes, instantiate emotions: an\nappraisal, autonomic physiological changes, an action tendency, a\nmotor expression, and a subjective feeling. In his more recent\ncollaborative work (Moors & Scherer 2013), Scherer has suggested that\nthe point of each stimulus evaluation check is actually to determine\naction tendencies, which would give pride of place to the motivational\ncomponent and make his theory an evaluative-motivational hybrid (see\nalso Scherer & Moors forthcoming). \nA variant of appraisal theories has recently attracted some interest in\naffective computing, an interdisciplinary approach that combines\ninsights from affective science and computer science (see Picard\n1997). This is the Belief and Desire Theory of Emotions (BDTE)\ndeveloped by Reisenzein (2009a,b; see also Miceli & Castelfranchi\n2015). The BDTE holds that emotions are caused by a combination of\ncognitive evaluations (beliefs) and conative motivations (desires),\nwhereas standard appraisal theories postulate cognitive evaluations of\nmotive-congruence, which in effect assesses the degree to which the\nstimulus is congruent with the goals/desires of the agent. \nBDTE’s core thesis is that emotions are elicited by hardwired\nmechanisms whose evolutionary function is to compare newly acquired\nbeliefs with existing desires and existing beliefs, thereby monitoring\nand updating the central representational system of humans (the\nbelief–desire system). For example, suppose you have a belief\nthat your favorite candidate will lose the election and a desire that\nshe win the election (Reisenzein 2009a). Once new information that she\nhas in fact won the election is acquired, a belief-belief-comparator\nsystem produces a belief disconfirmation signal subjectively\nexperienced as surprise, and a belief-desire-comparator system\nproduces a desire fulfillment signal subjectively experienced as\npleasure. This in turn leads to adaptive responses which include a\nrefocusing of attention to the new content that one’s favorite\ncandidate won, the deletion of the belief that one’s favorite\ncandidate was going to lose, and the subjective experience of\nhappiness. \nTo generalize, emotions are for the BDTE combinations of belief\ndisconfirmation/confirmation signals and desire\nfulfillment/frustration signals experienced as, respectively,\nsurprise/expectancy confirmation and pleasure/displeasure, which blend\ninto an emergent experience of a specific emotion (e.g., happiness,\nfear, hope, etc.). These signals are non-conceptual, in the sense that\nthey do not presuppose concept use, and they bring about redirection\nof attention, updates of the belief and desire store, and, when above\nthreshold, distinctive subjective experiences. \nA challenge faced by appraisal theories concerns whether appraisals\nare causes of emotions, entailments of emotions, parts of emotions, or\nsome combination of the above. These questions raise complex conceptual issues we\ncannot address here (see Moors 2013), but they are essential for\nassessing the evidentiary support for appraisal theory. A long-running\ncritique of the research program (Oatley 1992; Parkinson &\nManstead 1992; Parkinson 1997; Russell 1987; Frijda 1993) has been\nthat the self-report evidence commonly taken to support a causal\ninterpretation of the relation between appraisals and emotions only\nsupports a relation of conceptual entailment between them because it\nunveils people’s beliefs about what makes emotions\nappropriate rather than what causes emotions (see\nScherer 2009 for a response).  \nWe mentioned earlier that a popular response to the critiques received\nby philosophical judgmentalism has been the alternate cognitions\nstrategy, intended to better account for their intentionality,\ndifferentiation, motivational power, and phenomenology, as well as\ntheir potential recalcitrance. \nThis has led to a gradual convergence of the Evaluative and Feeling\nTraditions, with the former now identifying emotions as evaluative\nperceptions with a distinctive phenomenology and the latter\nidentifying emotions as evaluative feelings with a distinctive\nintentionality. As a result, the distinction between evaluative (or\ncognitivist) theories and feeling theories is increasingly blurred,\nwith most of the dominant accounts in the philosophy of emotions now\nqualifying as hybrids. \nPerceptual theories come in literal/strong and non-literal/weak\nvarieties (Brady 2013; Salmela 2011). Strong versions generally assume\nthat emotions are genuine forms of perception along the lines of\nsensory perception; weak versions stress key properties emotions share\nwith sensory perception, while also acknowledging important\ndifferences.  \nPrinz’s Neo-Jamesian theory is a good example of a strong\nperceptual theory. For Prinz (2004), we can speak of a bona\nfide perceptual system when we are in the presence of a dedicated\ninput system with specialized transducers and mental representations.\nSensory perception clearly has input systems dedicated to vision,\nolfaction, touch, hearing, and taste. Following in the footsteps of\nDamasio’s (1994, 2003) neuroscientific work, Prinz suggests that\nemotions can also rely on a dedicated system within the somatosensory\nsystem. Thus, emotions literally are perceptions of bodily changes,\neither at the visceral, hormonal, or musculoskeletal levels, or in the\nform of changes in the somatosensory brain areas. \nPrinz adds that emotions are not just perceptions of bodily\nchanges, from which it follows that two emotions can differ from one\nanother despite involving indistinguishable perceptions of bodily\nchanges. For example, fear is not just the perception of “a\nracing heart and…other physiological changes” (Prinz\n2004: 69): it also has a distinctive function—being elicited by\ndanger—and a specific negative valence marker—less of\nthis!—which motivates avoidant action. Since on a teleosemantic\ntheory of representation mental states represent what they have the\nfunction of indicating (Prinz 2004; Dretske 1988), Prinz concludes\nthat perceiving a racing heart can also represents danger insofar as\nit has the function of indicating it (but see Shargel & Prinz\n2018; Robinson 2005). To sum up, subjects literally perceive bodily\nchanges (the nominal content) and indirectly perceive the formal\nobject (the real content) by virtue of the fact that bodily changes\nrepresent formal objects. \nWeak perceptual theories take emotions to be relevantly analogous to\nsensory perception or proprioception. In addition, most take emotions\nto be direct perceptions of formal objects rather than perceptions of\nbodily changes with the function of tracking formal objects. \nAn influential proposal in this vein is offered by Roberts (2003), who\nholds that “emotions are a kind of perception” (2003: 87) in the\nform of concern-based construals. Roberts clarifies that construals\nare “impressions, ways things appear to the subject” (2003: 75)\nand that they are concern-based by virtue of being based on the\nsubject’s desires and aversions. For example, a father’s\nfear that a fire will hurt his daughter is a construal of the fire as\ndangerous based on the father’s desire that nothing bad happen\nto his daughter. \nAlong similar lines, Tappolet (2016) suggests that emotions are\nperceptual experiences of evaluative properties (a.k.a. values) like\ndangerousness (fear) or slights (anger). Some authors add that such\nevaluative properties are not available through any others means, just\nlike color properties are not available except by courtesy of visual\nperception (see, e.g., Johnston 2001). \nTappolet emphasizes that evaluative perception, just like sensory\nperception, is non-conceptual in nature and cognitively impenetrable\n(see also Döring 2007; Döring & Lutz 2015; Goldie 2000;\nTappolet 2000; Goldie 2002; Wollheim 1999; Charland 1995; Zajonc\n2000). This would explain why creatures who do not possess concepts,\nlike animals and pre-linguistic infants, can have emotions, and it\nwould account for emotional recalcitrance, which can be understood\nalong the lines of a visual illusion. As we visually perceive a pencil\nas bent while judging it to be straight, so we emotionally perceive a\ntransparent platform over the Grand Canyon as dangerous while judging\nit to be non-dangerous. \nTappolet (2016) lists additional features that help explain why so\nmany authors have come to think of emotions as perceptions: (a) both\nemotions and perceptions have salient phenomenal properties, (b) both\nare elicited automatically by real or imagined objects, (c) both have\ncorrectness conditions because they represent the world as being a\ncertain way, and (d) both play the epistemic role of providing\ndefeasible reasons for belief (e.g., visual perception for the belief\nthat something is blue, and fear for the belief that something is\ndangerous).  \nThese analogies notwithstanding, several critics have rejected\nperceptual theories of emotions (e.g., Salmela 2011; Dokic &\nLemaire 2013). A prominent critique concerns their inability to\naccount for emotional recalcitrance. For example, Helm (2001) has\nargued that perceptualists have ended up removing the irrationality\nthat is distinctive of recalcitrance. If perceiving a transparent\nplatform over the Grand Canyon as dangerous while judging it to be\nnon-dangerous were just like a visual illusion, then there would be\nnothing irrational about it, as there is nothing irrational in seeing\na pencil as bent while judging it to be straight. But there clearly is\nsome measure of irrationality involved in recalcitrant emotions:\nunlike perceptual illusions, they motivate us to act. In other words,\nthey involve a passive assent which contradicts the active assent\ncaptured by the contradicting judgment. \nSeveral authors have proposed theories that endow feelings with\nintentionality. A notable example is that of Goldie (2000), who\nidentifies the intentionality of emotions with that of feelings\ntowards, which are not just bodily feelings that borrow their\nintentionality from somewhere else, as in Prinz’s account, but\nare instead supposed to have their own, intrinsic intentionality (see\nalso Döring 2007; Pugmire 1998). For example, when I feel fear\nabout slipping on ice, my feeling is towards the ice as being\ndangerous. This sort of feeling is a matter of thinking of the ice\nwith feeling, and cannot be reduced to a combination of a\nnon-intentional bodily feeling and a non-emotional evaluative thought.\nAs Goldie puts it,  \nemotional feelings are inextricably intertwined with the\nworld-directed aspect of emotion, so that an adequate account of an\nemotion’s intentionality…will at the same time capture an\nimportant aspect of its phenomenology. (Goldie 2002: 242; see also\nRatcliffe 2005, 2017)  \nIn a similar vein, Helm (2009: 8) proposes that “emotions are\nintentional feelings of import” which are either pleasurable or\nunpleasant. On Helm’s view,  \n[f]or something to have import to you—for you to care\nabout it—is (roughly) for it to be worthy of attention and\naction. (Helm 2009: 252)  \nThis explains why emotions motivate action: feeling that something is\nworthy of attention and action is being motivated. It also explains\nwhat makes a recalcitrant emotion irrational. By judging a transparent\nplatform over the Grand Canyon as not dangerous and yet fearing it,\nthe subject is judging that what he or she feels is worthy of\nattention and action actually isn’t, thereby undertaking\nevaluative commitments at odds with one another (Helm 2015:\n430–431). \nSome of the views that ascribe intentionality to feelings are inspired\nby the broader research program of representationalism in the\nphilosophy of mind, which is the view that phenomenal properties are\nidentifiable with, or at least reducible to, intentional properties\n(Dretske 1995; Horgan & Tienson 2002). In some variants of\nrepresentationalism, the emotional phenomenology that gets to be\nreduced is merely somatic, in the sense that the feeling is directed\nat bodily events (e.g., Tye 1995). In other variants, the\nphenomenology is much richer, as it comprises somatic, cognitive,\nconative and irreducibly affective components directed at\nparticular and formal objects in the world (e.g., Kriegel 2012). \nAn alternative embraced by some contemporary feeling theorists is to\nargue that emotions are feelings devoid of any intentional objects.\nThe contrary impression is an illusion, deriving from the fact that\nthe feelings we call emotions are typically caused by thoughts with an\nintentional structure with which they are associated in a\n“composite” experience (Whiting 2011; Goldstein 2002). On\nthis view, fear of the ice is a composite mental state consisting of\nan emotion—the objectless feeling of fear—plus a thought\nwith the ice as its intentional object. In themselves, emotions are\nmerely hedonic feelings without intentionality. The grounds claimed\nfor this view are explicitly phenomenological, however, and since most\nresearchers’ introspection appears to deliver the contrary\nverdict that emotions are themselves object-directed, the composite\nview fails to persuade (for a different argument for objectlessness\nbased on social psychology data, see Shargel 2015). \nAnother influential approach in recent philosophy of emotions takes\nthem to be  \nmechanisms that control the crucial factor of salience among what\nwould otherwise be an unmanageable plethora of objects of attention,\ninterpretations, and strategies of inference and conduct. (de Sousa\n1987: xv; see also Elgin 2006; Evans 2001; Ben-Ze’ev 2000)  \nFor example, there are innumerable things I could in principle be\nfocusing on as I find myself face to face with a grizzly bear on a\nhike, but my fear focuses my attention squarely on the bear, on how\nto interpret its movements, and on how to infer and execute an escape\nstrategy. This approach may be taken to have a “perceptual\nflavor” (Prinz 2004: 223) because it describes emotions as\nmechanisms for changing salience, and perceptions can certainly affect\nsalience. But de Sousa aims to draw attention to the broader role\nemotions play in providing the framework for cognitions of both\nperceptual varieties (e.g., what we see and hear) and non-perceptual\nvarieties (e.g., what we believe and remember).  \nSome philosophers suggest that the directive power that emotions exert\nover cognitions is partly a function of their essentially dramatic or\nnarrative structure (Rorty 1987 [1988]). Goldie (2012) offers a\nparticularly subtle examination of the role of narrative in\nconstituting our emotions over the long term. It seems conceptually\nincoherent to suppose that one could have an emotion—say, an\nintense jealousy or a consuming rage—for only a fraction of a\nsecond (Wollheim 1999). One explanation of this feature of emotions is\nthat a story plays itself out during the course of each emotional\nepisode, and stories take place over stretches of time. Interestingly,\nGoldie argues that the narrative structure of emotions is the same\nwhether emotions are experienced towards real or fictional objects,\nwhich explains why we can respond to fictional characters with\nfull-fledged, although motivationally muted, emotional responses (for\na review of other solutions to the so-called paradox of\nfiction, see Cova & Friend forthcoming). \nDe Sousa (1987) has suggested that the stories characteristic of\ndifferent emotions are learned by association with “paradigm\nscenarios”. Paradigm scenarios involve two aspects: first, a\nsituation type providing the characteristic objects of the specific\nemotion-type (where objects can be particular and formal), and second,\na set of characteristic or “normal” responses to the\nsituation, where normality is determined by a complex and\ncontroversial mix of biological and cultural factors. These scenarios\nare drawn first from our daily life as small children and later\nreinforced by the stories, art, and culture to which we are exposed.\nLater still, they are supplemented and refined by literature and other\nart forms capable of expanding the range of one’s imagination of\nways to live (de Sousa 1990; Faucher and Tappolet 2008b). \nOnce our emotional repertoire is established, we interpret new\nsituations through the lens of different paradigm scenarios. When a\nparticular scenario suggests itself as an interpretation, it arranges\nor rearranges our perceptual, cognitive, and inferential dispositions.\nWhen a paradigm scenario is evoked by a novel situation, the resulting\nemotion may or may not be appropriate to the situation that triggers\nit. Thus, a childhood fear of clowns may be reappraised and overcome\nin adult life as a result of a more realistic appraisal. In that sense\nat least, emotions can be assessed for rationality (see\n section 10\n for further discussion). \nThe third tradition in the study of emotions identifies them\nessentially with special kinds of motivational states, where a\nmotivational state broadly understood is an internal cause of\nbehaviors aimed at satisfying a goal. Members of this research\ntradition think that the central problem a theory of emotions needs to\nsolve is explaining how emotions and actions are related, because it\nis ultimately what we do when we emote that produces significant\npersonal and social consequences. \nThe Motivational Tradition was anticipated by many theorists of\nemotions in Ancient Greece and throughout the Middle Ages who\nemphasized the constitutive relation between emotions and behavioral\nimpulses (King 2010), but it finds its first modern precursor in Dewey\n(1894, 1895). Dewey was unhappy with the reversal of common sense\nentailed by the Jamesian idea that emotions are feelings that emerge\nin response to proprioceptions. If we truly were angry\nbecause we strike, Dewey countered, anger could not cause the\nstriking, and this would deprive anger, as well as other emotions, of\ntheir explanatory importance. \nDewey’s main suggestion was that there is a difference between\nthe feeling of anger and anger itself: an emotion “in its\nentirety” is “a mode of behavior which is purposive”\nand “which also reflects itself into feeling” (Dewey 1895:\n15). When we say that someone is angry, Dewey concluded, “we do\nnot simply, or even chiefly, mean that [such person] has a certain\n‘feel’ occupying his consciousness”. Rather,\n“[w]e mean He…has assumed a readiness to act in certain\nways” (Dewey 1895: 16–17). The view that emotions are\nessentially either mechanisms that change one’s readiness to act\nor states of action readiness themselves has since been developed in a\nvariety of ways in affective science and in the philosophy of\nemotions. Let us begin from an influential evolutionary variant of the\nMotivational Tradition in affective science. \nBasic emotion theory emerged in the 1970s from the pioneering work of\nSilvan Tomkins, whose orienting insight was that “the primary\nmotivational system is the affective system” (Tomkins 2008: 4).\nTomkins proposed that there are nine basic or innate affects\ncontrolled by inherited programs: interest, enjoyment, surprise, fear,\nanger, distress, shame, contempt and disgust. Their motivational power\ncomes from their feeling pleasurable or painful, with such hedonic\nfeelings emerging from the perception of facial changes providing\n“motivating feed-back” (Tomkins 2008: 623). \nTomkins’ theory of basic affects was followed by two related\ndevelopments. The first was the birth of modern-day basic emotion\ntheory, with its consuming attention for the universality of facial\nexpressions, present especially in the work of Paul Ekman (Ekman et\nal. 1972; Ekman 1980, 1999a, 2003; Ekman & Friesen 1969) and\nCarrol Izard (1971, 1977, 1992, 2007). The second was the emergence of\nthe evolutionary psychology approach to emotions understood as\nsolutions to recurrent evolutionary problems, with prominent\ncontributions by Plutchick (1980) and Tooby and Cosmides (2008) (see\nalso Shand 1920 and McDougall 1908 [2001] for earlier examples of\nevolutionary theories of emotions). \nStarting in the 1990s, the two approaches have progressively merged,\nalthough evolutionary psychologists are more inclined than basic\nemotion theorists to conclude that a given emotion solves an\nevolutionary problem merely on the basis of plausibility arguments.\nAccording to Ekman (1999a: 46), “emotions evolved for their\nadaptive value in dealing with fundamental life tasks” such as\n \n[f]ighting, falling in love, escaping predators, confronting sexual\ninfidelity, experiencing a failure-driven loss in status, responding\nto the death of a family member. (Tooby & Cosmides 2008: 117; see\nalso Keltner & Haidt 2001) \nThey have adaptive value because they quickly mobilize and coordinate\nresources needed to successfully deal with life tasks, and because\nthey communicate socially relevant information via bodily expressions.\nAs soon as a basic emotion program is activated, a  \ncascade of changes (without our choice or immediate awareness) occurs\nin split seconds in: the emotional signals in the face and voice;\npreset actions; learned actions; the autonomic nervous system activity\nthat regulates our body; the regulatory patterns that continuously\nmodify our behavior; the retrieval of relevant memories and\nexpectations; and how we interpret what is happening within us and in\nthe world. (Ekman & Cordaro 2011: 366) \nFrom this follows the central empirical hypothesis of traditional BET:\nthere should be bodily signatures for each basic emotion consisting of\nhighly correlated and emotion-specific changes at the level of facial\nexpressions, autonomic changes and preset and learned actions. More\nspecifically, Ekman defined basic emotions in terms of (a) distinctive\nuniversal signals, (b) distinctive physiology, (c) distinctive\nthoughts, memories and images, (d) distinctive subjective experiences,\n(e) predictable developmental appearance, (f) homologous presence in\nother primates, (g) automatic appraisals tuned to distinctive\nuniversals in antecedent events, (h) quick onset, brief duration, and\nunbidden occurrence (Ekman 1999a: 5). Some basic emotion theorists\nhave also suggested that basic emotions are associated with\ndistinctive hardwired neural circuits (e.g., Izard 2011; Levenson\n2011; Panksepp 1998, 2000). \nArmed with this definition, Ekman proceeded to argue that we have\nempirical evidence for six basic affect programs (happiness, sadness,\nanger, fear, disgust, and surprise), later on expanding the list to\ninclude states whose basic status is likely to be proven in the future\nsuch as amusement, contempt, embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride\nin achievement, relief, satisfaction, wonder, ecstasy, sensory\npleasure, and shame (Ekman & Cordaro 2011). Scientifically-minded\nphilosophers often restrict their discussions of emotions to the basic\naffect programs, since these are argued to be the only natural kinds\nso far discovered in the affective domain (Griffiths 1997; DeLancey\n2002). \nThe main source of evidence for basic affect programs arguably comes\nfrom cross-cultural studies on facial expressions that use a\nrecognition technique first described by Darwin (1872). It consists of\nshowing pictures of emotional expressions and asking observers what\nemotions they express from a list of six to ten emotion terms in the\nobserver’s language. As reported by Ekman (1999b), experiments\nof this sort have so far been performed with observers from dozens of\ncountries, revealing significant agreement on which emotion is\nportrayed (the recognition rates are strongest for happiness, sadness\nand disgust). This being said, membership to a given culture increases\nrecognition of expressions from that culture, which has led some to\nargue that emotional expressions are a universal language with\ndifferent dialects (Elfenbein et al. 2007). \nIn combination with complementary data on the production of facial\nexpressions (Matsumoto et al. 2008), the recognitional data have been\ntaken to speak in favor of the hypothesis that affect programs are\nevolutionary adaptations producing the same mandatory facial changes\nin all cultures, although culturally specific display rules can\npartially mask such cross-cultural universality. \nThe evidence for universality has been criticized on methodological\nand conceptual grounds. Methodologically, it has been argued that the\nexperiments are defective because they rely on a forced choice\nparadigm which inflates consensus and because they rely on\necologically unrealistic stimuli such as actors’ posed faces\n(Russell 1994). Conceptually, it has been argued that the evolutionary\nhypothesis that selection would favor the production of mandatory\nfacial expressions is implausible, because in conflict situations it\nmay not be in the evolutionary interest of the emoter to let observers\nknow about what emotions they are experiencing (e.g., communicating\nfear during a confrontation). And even if there were universality of\nrecognition and production of emotional expressions, alternative\nexplanations like species constant learning would be able to account\nfor the data (Fridlund 1994). \nAn influential alternative to the Basic Emotions view of facial\nexpressions is the Behavioral Ecology view (Fridlund 1994), which\nreplaces the notion of expressions of emotion with that of\ndisplays produced in an audience-dependent fashion when\nsignalers expect benefits from them. Audience-dependence entails that\nsignalers tailor their context-sensitive facial displays to their\naudience and do not produce them mandatorily upon experiencing a given\nemotion. Displays are rather  \ndeclarations that signify our trajectory in a given social\ninteraction, that is, what we will do in the current situation, or\nwhat we would like the other to do. (Fridlund 1994: 130) \nFor example, what Ekman would describe as an anger face, a sad face or\na happy face is described by behavioral ecologists as, respectively, a\ndisplay of readiness to attack, a display of intent to affiliate and a\ndisplay of recruitment of succor (Fridlund 1994). A number of\ntheorists have argued that Ekman’s and Fridlund’s\napproaches can be reconciled: emotions can at the same time express\nemotions and make declarations that are credible precisely because\nthey are associated with emotions (M. Green 2007; Scarantino 2017;\nHess, Banse, & Kappas 1995; see also Bar-On 2013). \nThe broader problem with traditional BET is that the distinctive\nresponse profiles allegedly produced in cascade-like fashion have not\nbeen convincingly demonstrated either at the level of expressive\nresponses or at the level of autonomic changes, neural changes, preset\nactions or learned actions (Ortony & Turner 1990; Mauss et al.\n2005; Barrett 2006; Lindquist et al. 2012). This lack of clear and\ndistinctive bodily signatures has led to a variety of attempts to save\nBET from empirical refutation. Some basic emotion theorists have\nsuggested, for instance, that basic emotions can be regulated, which\nwould mask their mandatory effects, or that they cannot be elicited at\nthe right level of intensity by laboratory stimuli, or that they often\nmix with other affective and cognitive states in ways that blur their\ndistinctive responses (Ekman & Cordaro 2011). \nOthers have offered new meta-analyses that are more favorable to the\nexistence of emotion-specific biological signatures, especially at the\nlevel of autonomic and neural changes (Kreibig 2010; Stephens et al.\n2010; Nummenmaa & Saarimäki forthcoming). A third option is\nto transition to a New Basic Emotion Theory which replaces the\nassumption of cascade-like responses with that of action tendencies\nwith control precedence, which would account for some of the\nvariability of responses while preserving the core idea that basic\nemotions are geared towards solving evolutionary problems (Levenson\n2011; Scarantino & Griffiths 2011; Scarantino 2015). \nA more radical proposal has been offered by psychological\nconstructionists, who have suggested that we should abandon entirely\nthe “latent variable” model distinctive of basic emotion\ntheory, replacing it with an “emergent variable” model\naccording to which emotions do not cause facial expressions, autonomic\nchanges and preset and learned actions but rather emerge from them\n(Barrett & Russell 2015). Specifically, psychological\nconstructionists have argued that there is no one-to-one\ncorrespondence between anger, fear, happiness, sadness, etc. and any\nneurobiological, physiological, expressive, behavioral, or\nphenomenological responses, and that the different responses allegedly\ndiagnostic of basic emotions are not even strongly correlated with one\nanother. \nPsychological constructionists have concluded that this variability\ncalls into question the very idea that  \nemotions have ontological status as causal entities [and that they]\nexist in the brain or body and cause changes in sensory, perceptual,\nmotor, and physiological outputs. (Barrett 2005: 257)  \nThis view is at the polar opposite of the Motivational Tradition,\nwhich takes emotions to be motives—causal determinants of the\nchanges in outputs we observe. \nIt has also been suggested that the folk psychological categories\ncommonly invoked by basic emotion theorists—e.g., anger, fear,\ndisgust, etc.—are not suitable objects of scientific\ninvestigation, and should be replaced by categories that describe\nemotion components rather than discrete emotions themselves (Russell\n2003; Barrett 2006, 2017). \nConstructionists are convinced that emotions are put together on the\nfly and in flexible ways using building blocks that are not specific\nto emotions, roughly in the way cooked foods are constructed from\ningredients that are not specific to them and could be used according\nto alternative recipes. One of the ingredients out of which emotions\nare built is said to be core affect, which is a  \nneurophysiological state that is consciously accessible as a simple,\nnonreflective feeling that is an integral blend of hedonic\n(pleasure–displeasure) and arousal (sleepy–activated)\nvalues. (Russell 2003: 147) \nPsychological constructionists emphasize that we are always in some\nstate of core affect, which is a sort of barometer that informs us of\nour “relationship” to the flow of events. The readings of\nthe barometer are feelings, understood as blends of\npleasure-displeasure and activation-deactivation. These readings can\nbe represented as points along a “circumplex structure”, with the vertical axis representing the degree of activation-deactivation and the horizontal axis representing the degree of pleasure-displeasure\n(Russell 1980): \nDifferent constructionists describe the way in which emotions are\nbuilt out of core affect and other ingredients in different ways. For\nexample, in Barrett’s influential Conceptual Act View,\nconceptualization plays a key role (Barrett 2006, 2013, 2017; Barrett\n& Satpute 2013). Being afraid amounts to categorizing a core\naffective state of high arousal and high displeasure under the\n“fear” concept. Being happy amounts to categorizing a core\naffective state of high arousal and high pleasure under the\n“happiness” concept. More generally, Barrett (2017) takes\nemotions to be experiences that emerge from the categorization of\nsensations from one’s own body and the world. This view, which\nresembles Schachter and Singer’s (1962) cognition-arousal theory\nand merges themes from the Feeling Tradition and the Evaluative\nTradition, has been criticized for conflating emotions with verbal\nlabeling, for making it impossible for adult humans to mislabel their\nown emotions, and for preventing infants and animals from having\nemotions in the first place (e.g., Scherer 2009, see Barrett 2015 for\na reply). \nRussell (2003) considers conceptualization to affect only the\nmeta-experience of emotion, i.e., the realization that one is\nafraid, and allows emotion episodes to be constructed without the\ninvolvement of categorization. On his view, there are a variety of\nindependent causal mechanisms, rather than any emotion-specific\nmechanism, that explain why there is some degree of correlation\nbetween expressive, autonomic and behavioral changes in emotional\nepisodes, even though it is emphasized that the correlations are much\nweaker than what Ekman’s (1999a) model would predict (Russell\n2012). \nIn recent times, some proposals have been made to integrate\npsychological constructionism with other research programs. Some have\nsuggested that progress lies in merging appraisal theory with\nRussell’s version of psychological constructionism and have\noffered a general theory of how emotional action tendencies are caused\nby the weighing of the expected utilities of action options (Moors\n2017). Others have proposed that we sharply distinguish between the\nphenomenological and the motivational side of affective phenomena,\nhanding out the motivational side of (some) basic emotions to a new\ntheory of survival circuits and reserving folk psychological emotion\nterms to designate feelings exclusively, with the latter understood as\ncognitively constructed (LeDoux 2015, 2017; note the contrast with\nLeDoux 1996).  \nAnother option with some elements of overlap with psychological\nconstructionism is social constructionism. The social constructionist\napproach found its first advocates in the 1920’s when a number\nof anthropologists and social scientists started questioning\nDarwin’s (1872) evidence for the universality of emotional\nexpressions (e.g., Allport 1924; Landis 1924; Klineberg 1940). \nThese researchers initiated what we may call the “cultural\nvariability” strand of social constructionism, related to the\nthesis that emotions are different in several essential respects in\ndifferent cultures. These differences have since been shown with\nrespect to both the emotion lexicon (e.g., Russell 1991; Wierzbicka\n1999) and the diagnostic characteristics of emotions (e.g., Mesquita\n& Frijda 1992; Mesquita & Parkinson forthcoming). \nThe strand of social constructionism that is more germane to the\nMotivational Tradition is the “social role” strand,\nrelated to the thesis that emotions fulfill social functions by virtue\nof which they should be considered actions or roles rather than\npassions (see, e.g., Solomon 1976 and Averill 1990 on the “myth\nof passions”). Jean Paul Sartre (1939 [1948]) can be considered\nthe first to offer a general, although idiosyncratic, theory of\nemotions as social roles, a view developed in the early 1980s by\nphilosophers (e.g., Harré 1986, Armon-Jones 1986),\npsychologists (e.g., Averill 1980), and anthropologists (e.g., Lutz\n1988). In recent times, Parkinson (1995, 2008, 2009), Parkinson,\nFischer, and Manstead (2005), Griffiths (2004), Mesquita and Boiger\n(2014) and Van Kleef (2016) have articulated sophisticated social\nconstructionist accounts that add to the social constructionist\ntradition themes from evolutionary accounts.  \nThere are two main flavors of the Motivational Tradition in\ncontemporary philosophy of emotions. The phenomenological\nversion, articulated by Deonna and Teroni (2012, 2015), assumes\nthat emotions are feelings of action readiness. The\nnon-phenomenological version, articulated by Scarantino\n(2014, 2015) identifies emotions as causes of states of action\nreadiness which may or may not be felt. Both versions agree that the\nfundamental aspect of an emotion is the way it motivates the emoter to\nact. \nDeonna and Teroni argue that both judgmentalist and perceptual\ntheories of emotion make the mistake of identifying emotions in terms\nof content rather than in terms of attitude or\nmode. As Searle (1979: 48) points out, “[a]ll\nintentional states consist of a representative content in a\npsychological mode”. For example, believing and desiring are\ndifferent psychological modes or attitudes, and they each have a\ncontent—respectively, what is believed or desired as captured by\na proposition. \nIf emotions were special kinds of judgments or perceptions, they would\ndiffer from other kinds of judgments or perceptions not in terms of\nattitude but merely in terms of content—what is judged\nor perceived when we emote. Furthermore, the emotions themselves would\ndiffer from one another only in terms of content rather than attitude,\nbecause there would be no attitude specific to, say, anger, shame,\nguilt and so on, but rather a common attitude—the judging\nattitude or the perceiving attitude—towards different contents.\nDeonna and Teroni (2015) think that this approach fails to capture not\nonly what differentiates emotions from one another, but also what\nmakes them special as motivational states. \nAs an alternative, they propose an attitudinal theory of\nemotions. On this view, fear of a tiger is neither the judgment\nnor the perception that there is something dangerous at hand, but\nrather the attitude of taking-as-dangerous directed towards the\ncontent that there is a tiger. What gives emotional attitudes their\ncontent, Deonna and Teroni continue, are their cognitive\nbases, which are the ways in which the content that there is a\ntiger is cognized—e.g., through perception, imagination,\ninference and so on (e.g., the perception that there is a tiger). \nBut what sort of attitude is the one that constitutes an emotion\nrather than, say, a judgment or a perception? Deonna and Teroni\nconsider emotional attitudes to be essentially experiences of feeling\none’s body ready for action. For example, fear of a dog amounts\nto “an experience of the dog as dangerous” insofar as it\nis “an experience of one’s body being prepared” for\navoidance (Deonna & Teroni 2015: 303). Similarly, anger at a\nperson “is an experience of offensiveness insofar as it consists\nin an experience of one’s body being prepared to\nretaliate” (2015: 303). Thus, emotions are felt attitudes of\naction readiness irreducible to non-emotional attitudes and specific\nto each emotion (for a critique of the attitudinal theory, see Rossi\n& Tappolet forthcoming). \nThe starting point of Scarantino’s (2014) Motivational\nTheory of Emotions is the conviction that emotions are\nirreducible not just to judgments and perceptions, but also to\nfeelings, and should be understood instead as special kinds of\n“central motive states” or “behavioral\nprograms”. Central motive states or behavioral programs are\ndefined by what they do rather than by how they feel. And what they do\nis to provide a “general direction for behavior by selectively\npotentiating coherent sets of behavioral options” (Gallistel\n1980: 322). \nThis selective potentiation can result in feelings, but the phenomenal\nchanges are not necessary to the potentiation itself, which consists\nof changes in the probabilities of behavioral options. To exemplify,\nfear involves the selective potentiation of options that share the\ngoal of avoiding a certain target appraised as dangerous, anger\ninvolves the selective potentiation of options that share the goal of\nattacking a certain target appraised as offensive, guilt involves the\nselective potentiation of options that share the goal of repairing a\nrelationship appraised as damaged by actions that fell short of\none’s moral standards, and so on.  \nThe Motivational Theory of Emotions is inspired by Frijda’s\n(1986) theory of emotions as action tendencies, but there are some\ndifferences. Scarantino (2014, 2015) draws a distinction between an\nemotion and an episode of emotion, with the emotion\ncorresponding to what causes a change in action readiness and the\nepisode of emotion corresponding to the actual change of action\nreadiness. But Scarantino borrows a key ingredient from Frijda’s\n(1986) theory, namely the assumption that action tendencies must have\ncontrol precedence to become emotional. Control precedence\ninvolves interrupting competing processes, preempting access—in\nmemory, inference, perception, etc.—to information not related\nto the avoidance goal and preparing the body for action.  \nThe idea that emotions are behavioral programs that bring about\nprioritized impulses to act can be combined with an origin\nstory about how some of such programs evolved to deal with\nfundamental life tasks, leading to what Scarantino (2015) has labeled\nthe New Basic Emotion Theory. According to it, learning can affect\nboth what activates the evolved program (input) and what responses the\nprogram brings about (output) through the interplay of the prioritized\naction tendency and regulation. This will result in massive\nvariability of the actual responses observed upon the activation of\nany basic emotion, shielding the New BET from the lack of\n“bodily signatures” problem. \nFinally, Scarantino (2014) endorses a teleosemantic theory of content\nfor emotions to deal with the problem of intentionality, and proposes\nthat different emotions differ from one another and from non-emotional\nstates both in terms of the state of prioritized action\ntendency they cause (the attitude) and in terms of what they represent\n(the content). On this view, fear is a prioritizing action control\nprogram which represents dangers because it has the function of\ncausing avoidant behaviors in the presence of danger, anger is a\nprioritizing action control program which represents slights because\nit has the function of causing aggressive behaviors in the presence of\nslights, and so on. \nA central challenge for motivational theories of emotions of both\nphenomenological and non-phenomenological varieties is to account for\nthe states of action readiness distinctive of different emotions.\nFirst, many emotions do not appear to motivate action at all. Grief\nand depression, for example, seem to involve a general depotentiation\nof the readiness to act. Second, it is unclear which action tendencies\n“backward-looking” emotions like regret could elicit,\nbecause they focus on what happened in the past, which cannot be\nchanged. Third, emotions like joy involve the selective potentiation\nof a fairly open range of behavioral options, so it is unclear what\naction tendency may be associated with them. Fourth, it seems to be\npossible for the same action tendency to be associated with different\nemotions, and for different emotions to be associated with the same\naction tendency, provided that these tendencies are described at a\nsufficiently abstract level of analysis (for critiques of motivational\napproaches, see, e.g., Reisenzein 1996; Prinz 2004; Tappolet 2010,\n2016; Eder & Rothermund 2013). \nEnactivism is an interdisciplinary research program which begins with\ndissatisfaction with the way cognitive processes have long been\nstudied in cognitive science (Di Paolo & Thompson\n2014; Gallagher 2017). Two enactivist themes in particular are relevant for emotion\ntheory. The first is the focus on the active role played by the\ncognizer in his or her relation with the external world, which is for\nenactivists not given and passively detected but rather\nenacted and actively shaped by the “sense making”\npowers of the cognizer. This “sense making” activity is at\nthe heart of cognition as enactivists understand it, and it is\navailable to all living beings, no matter how simple they may be,\ninsofar as they are autonomous and adaptive systems (Thompson 2007).\n \nThe second theme is the focus on the embodied,\nembedded and extended character of cognitive\nprocesses (the theme of embodiment looms large in affective\nscience as well; see, e.g., Niedenthal 2007; Wilson-Mendenhall et al. 2011; Carr et al. forthcoming).\nWhereas traditional cognitive science and neuroscience have focused on\nthe brain in isolation from the rest of the body and from the\nenvironment, enactivists argue that we will fail to understand\ncognition if we neglect the reciprocal causal interactions between\nbrain, body and environment as they dynamically unfold over time. \nThe idea that complex cognitive abilities can rely on the scaffolding\nprovided by the external environment has proven especially popular\namong emotion theorists. It has led on the one hand to a renewed\nattention to the role played by interpersonal communication in social\nenvironments (Griffiths & Scarantino 2009), and on the other hand\nto the suggestion that emotions are ontologically extended beyond the\nnarrow confines of the cranium (Stephan et al. 2014; Krueger 2014;\nColombetti & Roberts 2015; Colombetti 2017). \nTo which tradition of research do enactivist theories of emotions\nbelong? The focus on experience might appear to nudge enactivism\ntowards the Feeling Tradition (see, e.g., Ratcliffe 2008). Enactivism\nis indeed influenced by the notion, central to the phenomenological\nphilosophical tradition, that the body is an experienced\nstructure (Husserl 1952 [1989]; Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962]) rather than\nsimply a physical structure. And what we can experience\nlimits the world we inhabit, our “Umwelt” (Uexküll\n(1934 [2010]). \nColombetti (2014) has made the case that the phenomenological\ntradition can enrich the affective neuroscience of emotions. Relying\non Varela’s (1996) method of neurophenomenology,\nColombetti has developed a framework for integrating third-person\nmethods like brain imaging with first-person methods like\nself-reports. It is also quite clear that enactivists, in opposition\nto the “disembodied stance” (Colombetti & Thompson\n2008) of many cognitivist theories, view emotions as bodily and\nexperiential processes rather than intellectual ones. \nNevertheless, it is more appropriate to slot the enactivist movement\ninto the phenomenological side of the Motivational Tradition. This is\nbecause enactivists also greatly emphasize the role of action\nin cognition. A number of them have recently offered accounts of\nemotions that emphasize their action-oriented nature (Hufendiek 2016;\nSlaby & Wüschner 2014; Shargel & Prinz 2018). Cognition\nis said to be enacted by inherently teleological living systems for\nthe purposes of action. More radically, some cognitive processes like\nperception are described as constitutively dependent on motoric\nprocesses, as in the sensorimotor theory of visual consciousness\n(Hurley 1998; O’Regan & Noë 2001). \nThere is no unified understanding of the relation between emotions and\naction among enactivists, but rather a number of distinct proposals.\nIn Colombetti’s work, for instance, the notion of\nself-organization plays an orienting role. Her view is that\nemotional episodes are “self-organizing patterns of the\norganism, best described with the conceptual tools of dynamical\nsystems theory”, a branch of mathematics designed to account for\nthe temporal evolution of systems that change over time (Colombetti\n2014: 53; see also Lewis 2005). \nSelf-organization is the capacity of a complex system to reach and\npreserve a state of order through reciprocal causal influences among\nsimpler component parts. When applied to the emotions, the idea is\nthat emotion components self-organize, which helps explain the\nvariability of emotional episodes, because self-organizing systems can\nend up in multiple end states depending on how their components\ninteract (see A. Clark 2001: 113–114). \nAlthough there are analogies between this view and psychological\nconstructionism, especially with respect to the emphasis on emotions\nas emergent and flexible phenomena, Colombetti denies that conceptual\nacts bring about emotions, assuming that “sense making” is\na much more primitive phenomenon available from bacteria to humans.\nCreatures engage in “sense making” when they assess the\nenvironment in terms of whether it promotes their self-maintenance,\nand act so as to improve their viability within the environment, as a\nbacterium does when swimming away from a noxious substance. \nAt the same time, Colombetti uses the assumption of self-organization\nof emotional phenomena to oppose the notion that emotional episodes\nare caused either by affect programs (contra the basic emotion\ntradition) or by appraisals (contra the appraisal tradition).\nIncidentally, Colombetti (2014) thinks that the very notion of basic\nemotion is arbitrary and not worth keeping because it discourages\nresearch on the neural, behavioral, and bodily features of allegedly\nnon-basic emotions. Hufendiek (2016) makes the complementary case that\nallegedly non-basic emotions manifest a great many of the\ncharacteristics distinctive of basic emotions (see also J. Clark\n2010). \nAnother distinctive feature of enactivism is its\nanti-representational stance (Varela et al., 1991; Hutto\n& Myin 2013; Gallagher 2017). For example, Hutto (2012) has proposed that\n“we let go of the idea that emotions represent situations in\ntruth-evaluable ways” (2012: 4), suggesting that emotions do not\nrepresent core relational themes. For instance, fear does not\nrepresent that there is danger at hand, and anger does not represent\nthat there has been a slight against me or mine. Hutto’s (2012)\nmain concern with respect to ascribing representational powers to\nemotions is that such powers are posited despite not having\nexplanatory value (see Hufendiek 2018 for discussion). Specifically,\nHutto (2012) follows Ramsey (2007) in assuming that a mental state\ncounts as a representation only if it is consumed by other systems in\nlight of what it says or indicates, and concludes that emotions fail\nto play this larger explanatory role in the cognitive economy of the\norganism and should therefore not be considered representations. \nPrinz (2004) used to think that emotions represent core relational\nthemes because they have the function of correlating with them, but in\nhis recent work he has changed his mind. Schargel and Prinz (2018)\nhave argued that a teleosemantic approach is a threat to the truly\nembodied character of a theory of emotions in the James-Lange mold,\nthe approach they favor. This is because any non-embodied\nvehicle—e.g., a disembodied judgment—that has the function\nof correlating with a core relational theme would just as well\nrepresent such theme as an embodied vehicle does (Shargel 2014). \nAs an alternative, Shargel and Prinz (2018) embrace a\nnon-representational, enactivist theory of content for emotions,\naccording to which emotions create, by virtue of the bodily\npreparation they involve, action possibilities (see also Griffiths\n& Scarantino 2009; Hufendiek 2016). These action possibilities,\nunlike standard affordances in the Gibsonian tradition, which\npre-exist emotions and are motivationally inert, are\n“state-dependent (they typically arise only once the emotion has\nbeen initiated), and imperatival (they motivate action)”\n(Shargel & Prinz 2018: 119). On this view, fear generates\npossibilities for escape which would not be there in the absence of\nfear, and which work as dynamic attractors, pulling the agent towards\nescape. The enactive content of fear, then, is not danger, but the\npresentation of a certain situation as something to be escaped,\njointly with an impulse to move away from it, a content that is\nessentially embodied since it involves bodily preparation for\nescape. \nA central challenge for enactivist theories of emotions of the\nnon-representational variety is to account for our normative practices\nwith respect to emotions. Once we realize that someone’s fear\nmoved him or her to avoid a certain state of affairs, or that\nsomeone’s anger motivated him or her to attack someone, we still\nask whether or not what motivated avoidance is a danger and whether or\nnot what motivated retribution is a slight. In other words, we still\ntreat emotions as appropriate and inappropriate with respect to their\ncircumstances of elicitation, and it is an open question if and how\nthese forms of appropriateness can be made sense of if emotions do not\nrepresent core relational themes (see Hufendiek 2016, 2017, 2018 for\nfurther discussion). \nWe distinguish between the cognitive rationality of emotions,\nconsisting of their ability to represent the world as it is and\nproperly relate to other evidence-sensitive evaluative processes, and\nthe strategic rationality of emotions, consisting of their\nability to lead to actions that promote the agent’s interests\nand properly relate to other action-influencing processes (De Sousa\n1987, 2011; see also Greenspan 2000; Mulligan 1998; Solomon 1980; Thagard\n2006; Stephan 2017b).  \nEmotions have long been thought to score poorly in terms of both\ncognitive and strategic rationality. The Stoics famously argued that\nemotions are false judgments. For example, fearing a tiger would\ninvolve the false judgment that one’s endangered life is\nimportant, whereas the sage should be indifferent to everything except\nvirtue. Failures of the emotions at the strategic level are also\ndeeply ingrained in both theoretical approaches and common sense.\nIra brevis furor, said the Romans: anger is a brief bout of\nmadness. In recent times, the pendulum has swung back, and researchers\nin both philosophy and affective science have started rehabilitating\nthe emotions in terms of both cognitive and strategic rationality. A\nproper appreciation of the role of emotions with respect to\nrationality requires a number of distinctions. \nOur first distinctions pertain to three varieties of cognitive\nrationality for emotions: rationality as fittingness,\nrationality as warrant and rationality as coherence.\nThe dominant view on emotions is that they are representations of core\nrelational themes or formal objects. Therefore, a first dimension of\nassessment for rationality concerns whether or not such core\nrelational themes/formal objects are instantiated. We may for instance\nsay that fear is rational in terms of fittingness just in\ncase it is directed towards things that are truly dangerous, because\nthis is what fear represents. Being afraid of a shark swimming\nalongside you is fitting, because the shark is dangerous. As\nD’Arms and Jacobson (2000) have emphasized, fittingness is importantly different\nfrom forms of appropriateness that are moral or strategic. For\nexample, amusement at a funny joke may be fitting even if being amused\nby it is both morally inappropriate due to the sexist content of the\njoke, and costly in terms of self-interest, because those who witness\nthe amusement may form a bad opinion of the amused agent. \nSuppose now that fear is elicited by something that is not dangerous.\nFear could still manifest rationality as warrant if its\nparticular object manifests relevant evidential cues of dangerousness.\nFor example, being afraid of a realistic replica of a shark moving\nalongside you in the water would be rational in the warrant sense, even though,\nunbeknownst to you, the shark replica is being remote-controlled by\na group of innocuous marine biologists. \nA third dimension of cognitive rationality concerns the\nconsistency of emotions with other representations of what\nthe world is like. If someone experiences fear of flying and believes\nthat flying is dangerous, there is rationality as coherence between\nwhat they fear and what they believe (even though fear is unfitting\ngiven the extremely low likelihood of plane accidents). \nAs noted in\n section 7.1,\n emotions are often recalcitrant to reason: many people do\nnot believe that flying is dangerous, and yet continue to\nfear it. But emotions manifest rationality as coherence in a great\nmany cases. This is due in part to the fact that emotions have\ncognitive bases, which consist of cognitions whose function\nis to provide emotions with their particular objects—I must\nbelieve, perceive or imagine being on an airplane prior to fearing\nit. \nWhen such cognitions are beliefs, their modification tends to be\ncoherently reflected in changes of the emotions. For example, if I am\nangry at Tom based on my belief that he has bad mouthed me with a\ncolleague, my anger is unlikely to survive the realization that he has\nnot, in fact, bad mouthed me with a colleague. On occasion, however,\nmy anger toward Tom will persist despite my belief that no slight\nwhatsoever has taken place, thereby revealing irrationality as\nincoherence. \nA special case of rationality as coherence regards the coherence of\nsets of emotions. Helm (2009) has argued that emotions come in\nrational patterns centered around the things that have import for the\nagent. For instance, if avoiding death is a concern of mine, then I\nshould not only feel fear when my life is threatened by a deadly disease, but I should\nalso feel, on pain of irrationality, relief once the threat\ndissipates and sadness or disappointment if the disease progresses instead. \nThe strategic (or prudential) rationality of emotions\nconcerns their ability to lead to actions that promote the\nagent’s interests and properly relate to other processes that\naffect actions, notably decision-making. Although emotions that are\nstrategically rational will also generally be cognitively rational in\nthe fittingness and in the warrant sense, exceptions are possible. For\nexample, some instances of anger which are not produced in the\npresence of either actual slights (fittingness) or evidential cues of\nslights (warrant) end up promoting the agent’s interests. A case\nin point may be the anger of a customer whose interests would be best\nserved by returning used merchandise but who has lost the receipt, and\nangrily dresses down a blameless clerk, which gets him the\nsought-after concession because the clerk gets intimidated. \nWe can distinguish two components of strategic rationality: an emotion\nis strategically rational insofar as it leads an agent (i) to select\nmeans conducive to the agent’s ends (instrumental strategic\nrationality) and (ii) to pursue ends that align with the agent’s\ninterests all things considered (substantive strategic irrationality).\nAn example of instrumental irrationality would be that of an agent who\ngets into a panic while trying to exit a house on fire, fails to\nlisten to the fireman’s directions, goes for the closest door\nforgetting that it leads into the only area of the house without an\nexit, and perishes in the process. There is nothing wrong here with\nthe end towards which panic predisposes the agent—seeking\nsafety—but the means chosen are clearly suboptimal. \nSubstantive irrationality can be argued for with respect to both\nemotion types and emotion tokens. For instance, some have proposed that\ngrief is a substantively irrational emotion type, because it\nalways involves the belief that a person dear to the grieving agent is\ndead and the desire that such person is not dead, which is an\nunsatisfiable desire given what one believes (Gustafson 1989; see\nCholbi 2017 for a response).  \nMore commonly, theorists have argued that specific tokens of\ncertain emotion types can be substantively irrational. For example, it\nwould be contrary to an agent’s interests to get angry at a\npotential employer during a job interview, since it will likely result\nin not getting the job offer and thus frustrate self-interest. \nBy contrast, anger at someone cutting the line at the airport can be\nsubstantively rational, since the end of stopping the offensive\nbehavior is conducive to one’s interests. Nussbaum (2016) has\nrecently argued that this can only be the case if the angry\nagent’s focus is not at all on payback for the offensive\nbehavior but entirely on preventing the offensive behavior from\nhappening again, because the desire for payback is either\nstraightforwardly irrational or problematic in other ways (Nussbaum refers to the unproblematic forms of anger as transition-anger). \nA common reason for doubting the strategic rationality of emotions is\nthat they often appear to lead to impulsive physical and\nmental actions. Impulsivity involves acting quickly prior to having\nconsidered all relevant information (Frijda 2010; Elster 1999, 2010).\nSome have argued that this is precisely what helps emotions provide an\noptimal compromise between speed and flexibility, allowing emotions to\nfunction as “decoupled reflexes” (Scherer 1984). \nOthers have noted that emotions often lead to “arational”\nactions, namely emotional actions not performed “for a\nreason” (Hursthouse 1991). Paradigmatic examples include actions\nlike jumping up and down out of joy or rolling around in one’s\ndead wife’s clothes out of grief. In such cases, Hursthouse\nargued, there is no belief and desire pair that can be posited to\nprovide a Humean reason for such actions, which are to be explained\nsimply by saying that the agent is in the grip of an emotion. The\ndebate on arational actions has taken off in recent philosophy of\nemotions, and a number of proposals, both in favor and against\nHumeanism, are available (see M. Smith 1998; Goldie 2000, Döring\n2007; Kovach & De Lancey 2005; Scarantino & Nielsen 2015).\n \nEmotions are notoriously apt to make us act in ways we regret.\nNotably, they can be a source of weakness of the will, the failure to\nact on one’s best reasons (Davidson 1970 [1980]). But they just\nas often help agents stick to their long-term goals (Tappolet 2016:\n227). For example, a gut feeling of guilt may help an agent resist a\ncheating temptation and is in this sense a means to the end of\nsuccessfully exercising self-control. On occasion, emotions can even\nground the phenomenon of inverse akrasia (McIntyre 1990; Arpaly &\nSchroder 2000), which consists in failing to do what you judged best\nonly to discover that you in fact did what was best for you, contrary\nto your former judgment. For example, one may judge best to become a\nprofessional musician, but be crippled by stage fright and end up in\nlaw school, only to later realize that this course of action best\nserves one’s long-term interests. \nA further threat to the strategic rationality of emotions comes from\ntheir relation to self-deception (Fingarette 1969; Mele 1987; van\nLeeuwen 2007), which is commonly regarded as irrational. Roughly,\nself-deception involves forming beliefs that are contrary to what the\navailable evidence supports but conformant to what the self-deceived\nagent desires. Emotions can cause self-deception because they can lead\nto powerful desires that something be or not be the case, which\ncausally impact the subject’s ability to process evidence. \nThis feature is principally related to the fact that emotions\ndetermine salience among potential objects of attention. Poets have\nalways known that the main effect of love is to redirect attention:\nwhen I love, I notice nothing but my beloved, and nothing of his or\nher faults. But this carries a risk, because I may fail to notice that\nthere is massive evidence that I am being deceived in some harmful\nway. My desire that I not be deceived, motivated by my love, is what\ndrives the faulty processing of evidence, resulting in\nself-deception. \nThis potential of emotions for “skewing the epistemic\nlandscape” (Goldie 2004: 259) in negative ways is compensated by\nemotion’s important role in promoting rational epistemic\nthinking. Epistemic emotions are those that are particularly\nrelevant to our quest for knowledge and understanding. Curiosity\nmotivates inquiry; interest keeps us at it, and, as both Plato and\nDescartes noted, doubt is crucial to our ability avoid prejudice.\nThese “epistemic” emotions can guide us specifically in\nthe context of our attempts to gain knowledge (Silvia 2006; Brun,\nDoğuoğlu, & Kuenzle 2008; Morton 2010). \nBut even garden-variety, non-epistemic emotions can promote\nunderstanding of the world and of the self within it (see also the\nfeeling-as-information hypothesis in affective science; Schwarz 2012).\nAccording to Brady (2013), the principal way in which emotions can do\nso is by motivating us to search for information that has a bearing on\nthe fittingness of our emotions, and on the adequacy of their\nunderlying concerns. Once again, the mechanism is that of changing\nsalience among potential objects of attention. Suppose for instance\nyou feel afraid when about to give a toast at a wedding. Your fear\npromotes understanding because it prompts you to determine whether the\nsituation is truly dangerous, and whether you should care that much\nabout giving a brilliant toast. \nMore broadly, it has been argued that the ability of emotions to shift\nattention on some features rather than others provides an essential\nsolution to the so-called frame problem, which is the problem\nof sorting relevant from irrelevant information in decision-making. De\nSousa has made the case in philosophy, suggesting that  \nemotions spare us the paralysis potentially induced by [the frame\nproblem] by controlling the salience of features of perception and\nreasoning…[thereby] circumscribing our practical and cognitive\noptions. (de Sousa 1987: 172)  \nFor example, being afraid of a bear focuses attention exclusively on\nthe features of the situation that are relevant to escaping it,\nwithout wasting time on deciding what irrelevant factors to\nignore. \nDamasio (1994, 2003) has given neurobiological foundations to this\nproposal, suggesting that emotions simplify the decision process by\nquickly marking deliberative options in the prefrontal cortex as\npositive or negative in light of their expected emotional\nconsequences. Patients with ventromedial prefrontal damage, Damasio\nargued, become irrationally Hamlet-like when faced with trivial\ndecisions such as choosing a date for their next doctor’s\nappointment, irrationally risk-prone when faced with gambling\ndecisions, and irrationally impatient when faced with decisions\ndemanding deferred gratification. The debate on whether the empirical\nevidence supports Damasio’s “somatic marker\nhypothesis” is still ongoing (see, e.g., Dunn, Dalgleish, &\nLawrence, 2006; Reimann & Bechara, 2010; Beer 2017). \nAnother influential view on the rationality of emotions is that they\nhelp solve the commitment problem (Schelling 1960;\nHirshleifer 1987; Frank 1988), which is the problem of convincing\npotential cooperative partners that one will fulfill promises and\nthreats even when narrowly self-interested considerations would demand\notherwise. For example, Frank (1988) has described the expression of\nsympathy as a mechanism to convince potential cooperators that one\nwill behave honestly in future interactions even in the presence of\ntemptation, and the expression of anger as a mechanism to convince\npotential cooperators that one will behave aggressively if messed with\neven when aggression is costly. These emotional signals are said to be\ncredible because hard to fake, and they end up benefitting both\npartners, because they help secure the parties’ willingness to\ncooperate honestly in mutually beneficial projects (see also Ross\n& Dumouchel 2004; O’Connor 2016). \nOne may be tempted to conclude from this overview of emotion theories\nacross disciplines that the field is deeply divided on just about\neverything. This would be hasty. Despite the great diversity of views\non the nature and function of emotions we have documented, a broad\nconsensus has emerged on a number of topics. Here is a tentative list\nof what a plurality of emotion theorists agree about, with brief\nmention of where the disagreements begin: \nThe exploration of these insights and the resolution of the\ndisagreements around them is a thriving interdisciplinary project in\ncontemporary emotion theory. Philosophers and affective scientists\nwill continue to engage in it for years to come, putting their\ndistinctive theoretical skills at the service of projects of common\ninterest.
