But it\nis only relatively recently that it has gone by just that name and\nreceived so much focused attention. As in other areas of philosophy,\nquestions concerning naturalism’s merits are central to recent\nepistemological debate. While many epistemological theories and\npositions are agreed by all to exemplify, or to run counter to,\nnaturalistic epistemology (NE), it is difficult to characterize\nprecisely, since “naturalism” is used to refer to a range\nof positions, commitments, and so on. NE, then, is more a movement or\ngeneral approach to epistemological theorizing than it is some\nsubstantive thesis (/theses). Broadly speaking, however, proponents of\nNE take the attitude that there should be a close connection between\nphilosophical investigation—here, of such things as knowledge,\njustification, rationality, etc.—and empirical\n(“natural”) science. Beyond that, and as detailed below,\nproponents of NE diverge in how they conceive of that close\nconnection, exactly—whether and to what extent they advocate use\nof empirical methods, or insist upon the relevance of the\nresults of certain areas of empirical study, or invoke\ncertain recognized “natural” properties,\nrelations, and so on, in their accounts of certain central\nepistemic phenomena. So too, proponents of NE differ in which\nscience(s) they take to be relevant to epistemological\ntheory—whether it is psychology and/or cognitive science,\nethology, cultural studies, evolutionary theory, social theory, or\nsome other area of empirical investigation.\n\n\nNE can also be understood as an attempt to redress the perceived\nshortcomings of what’s typically termed “traditional\nepistemology”\n (TE).[1]\n Here too, different naturalists are motivated by different concerns.\nTE is variously seen as unduly and unprofitably concerned with\nskeptical worries; as too much the product of “armchair”\n(perhaps a priori, and maybe ultimately idiosyncratic)\ntheorizing; as too geared towards the study of “our\nconcepts” of various states and properties and not concerned\nenough with the epistemological phenomena themselves; as operating\nwithout attention to the conditions in which knowledge (for example)\nis actually produced and/or shared, the limits, contours and history\nof actual human cognition, and so on. \n\n\nGiven that the differences amongst naturalistic theories make it\ndifficult to give a precise characterization of NE, it is not\nsurprising that the division between NE and TE is itself something of\nan idealization. Of course, just as there are clear instances where a\ntheory belongs on one or the other side of this divide, there\nare some real differences between NE and TE broadly\nunderstood. Nonetheless, many specific epistemological theories\nincorporate elements of each, and so any neat bifurcation of extant\nepistemologies into NE and TE is bound to sacrifice accuracy for\nprecision.\n\n\nThe discussion to follow describes some of the dominant claims,\ncommitments, and forms that naturalistic epistemology, so understood,\nhas taken, and specific examples of such naturalistic views. As well,\nboth the principal motivations for and the major objections to NE will\nbe discussed. Finally (and, in some cases, along the way), we will\nbriefly consider the relation between NE and some other recent and\nimportant subjects, positions, and developments—some of them\njust as controversial as NE itself. These include externalism,\nexperimental philosophy, social epistemology, feminist epistemology,\nevolutionary epistemology, and debates about the nature of (epistemic)\nrationality.\n\nContemporary discussions of NE tend to take as their starting point\nQuine’s seminal 1969 paper, “Epistemology\nNaturalized”. Before considering that work, some background will\nhelp to give a sense of the general character of the traditional\napproach to epistemological theorizing, the various themes running\nthrough NE, and the pre-Quinean history of NE. Here, the natural\nstarting point is Descartes, who is widely regarded as “the\nfounder of modern epistemology” (Sosa 2003: 554; cf. BonJour\n2002: 6). \nDescartes’ avowed goal was to “start again right from the\nfoundations” (First Meditation, 1988 [1641]: 17) of\nscience—i.e., to legitimate the foundations of inquiry per\nse, and to show how we ought to conduct ourselves intellectually\nin order to achieve knowledge and avoid error. The realization of the\npossibility of massive error—made vivid through the device of\ncertain skeptical possibilities—of course had a significant\ninfluence over Descartes’ theorizing. His specific\nrecommendation, arrived at through careful reflection on his own\nideas, was a particularly strong foundationalism designed to rule out\nthe possibility of error: one should “hold back [one’s]\nassent from opinions which are not completely certain and\nindubitable” (ibid.), and in fact treat as false\nanything that could possibly be false. On the other hand, Descartes\nsays, “I…seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule\nthat whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true”\n(ibid.: 87). So long as one carefully apportions one’s\njudgment to the degree of “clarity and distinctness” of\none’s ideas, given God’s providence, one can proceed in\nconfidence that one is not theorizing in error. \nVery few current practitioners of TE endorse Descartes’\narguments and positive views. Very few, for example, accept his\ninfallibilism about what knowledge requires, and many regard\nDescartes’ arguments as manifesting an unfortunate circularity.\nNonetheless, Descartes’ work exemplifies certain assumptions\nabout the epistemological enterprise that many epistemologists have\nretained, even if only implicitly, and that have come to be closely\nassociated with TE. Taking our cue from Crumley (2009: 185; Goldman\n1986: 1–2, and Pacherie 2002: 300–301, make similar\nsuggestions), we can identify the most salient such assumptions as\nfollows: \nTo Crumley’s list, we might, given its historical importance,\nadd the following: \n(a)–(d), again, are some of the central features of TE, as it is\nusually understood. Obviously, there are natural connections among\nthem. For instance, to the extent that the autonomy of epistemology\n (b)\n is thought to amount to its priority—insofar as it\napproaches the status of “first philosophy”, in the manner\nDescartes supposed—a concern with\n (d)\n will be natural, even obligatory. So too, one might think that the\nautonomy of epistemology\n (b)\n is owing to its (partly) normative subject matter\n (c),\n and/or its distinctive methodology\n (a),\n as compared with the (purportedly) purely descriptive concerns and a\nposteriori methods of science. And so on. However, the theories\nfalling within TE are, once again, a varied lot; and those sympathetic\nto TE at times pull these features apart, emphasizing commitment to\nthem to varying degrees and in different ways. \nAnd so too for those who favor NE: Naturalists join in rejecting one\nor more of the above features of traditional (non-naturalistic)\nepistemology. But different theories and theorists within NE\nreject—to varying extents, in different ways, and for different\nreasons—different combinations of these features, and so differ\nin how much distance is put between their specific view and\ntraditional\n epistemologies.[2]\n The resulting variety among naturalistic theories is reflected in the\nvarious taxonomies that other commentators have offered. Thus, for\nexample, Alvin Goldman (1994: 301–304) has distinguished between\nmeta-epistemic, substantive and\nmethodological versions of\n NE:[3] \nMeta-epistemic NE: The meta-epistemological position\nthat epistemic properties—in particular, those usually counted\nas “normative” or evaluative (see above)—are, or\nmust be, appropriately related to “natural” properties.\nThe major forms of such appropriate relations are commonly thought to\nbe reduction and supervenience. (As Goldman notes (1994:\n301–302), and we’ll see below, meta-epistemic NE may not\nas it stands be sufficient to distinguish between certain naturalistic\nand non-naturalistic views; and arguably, the motivation for it is as\nmuch methodological as it is metaphysical—see\n Section 3.2.) \nIn terms of\n (a)–(d)\n above, meta-epistemic NE would constitute a denial of the autonomy of\nepistemology\n (b),\n at least as regards its fundamental ontology. If the relevant\nevaluative property cannot be appropriately related to natural ones,\non this view, it is rejected as unreal—yielding\neliminativism or error\ntheory—which would constitute a rejection of\n (c). \nSubstantive NE: Some object-level thesis in the vein\nrecommended by meta-epistemic NE—that is, an account of some\nepistemic phenomenon in terms of certain natural (non-normative)\nproperties or relations. Examples here would include accounts of\nknowledge or justification in terms of causation (Goldman 1967),\nreliability (Armstrong 1968, Goldman 1979, Papineau 1993, Kornblith\n2002), natural functions (Graham 2012, Millikan 1984), information\ntheoretic notions (Dretske 1981), or some kind of nomic or counterfactual\ndependence (Nozick 1983). Such accounts tend to be\n“externalist” in\n character[4]—i.e.,\n they do not require, for a subject to know or be justified in\nbelieving, that s/he be aware of that in virtue of which s/he knows or\nis\n justified.[5] \nSubstantive NE too is a rejection of any very strong version of the\nautonomy of epistemology\n (b),\n understood as a claim about its subject matter. Further, some critics\nhave contended that externalism is, as such, ill-equipped to provide\nuseful guidance to epistemic agents, at least of the first-personal\nreason-guiding variety. In this way, it has been thought, substantive\nnaturalistic views might run afoul of\n (c),\n understood as a claim about a specific type of normative guidance or\nimprovement (see, e.g., Kaplan 1994, BonJour 1994). An important\nsub-theme within substantive NE, as Goldman notes, is\n“descriptive realism as opposed [to] idealization” (1994,\np. 305), not merely for accuracy’s sake, but so as to ensure\nresponsiveness to the principle that “ought implies can”\n(ibid.). For some, this is the primary motive for adopting a\nnaturalistic approach: \nThe main reason that I believe that epistemology would have much to\nlearn from psychology if psychologists knew more about belief\nformation is that I believe that in epistemology as in ethics ought\nimplies can. Epistemic agents cannot and ought not be faulted on the\ngrounds that they did not follow epistemic strategies which are not\ncognitively possible for them. (Grandy 1994: 343; cf., e.g., Cherniak\n1986; Harman 1986, 1999; Bach 1984, 1985; Kornblith 2001) \nAnother manifestation of the aversion to overly-demanding or otherwise\n“unrealistic” epistemic theory is a tendency to treat \nthe question “How is knowledge possible?”…as an\nabbreviation for the question “How is knowledge possible for\nbeings like us in the world as it is?” (Pacherie 2002: 306; cf.\nPapineau 1993, “Introduction”, and Kornblith 1994b) \nThe same “realistic” outlook is evident as well as in\nnaturalists’ well-known and often-criticized disinclination to\nseriously engage with the traditional problem of philosophical\nskepticism (on which, more below). \nLast within Goldman’s typology is methodological\nNE, according to which epistemology \nshould either consist in empirical science, or should at least be\ninformed and beholden to the results of scientific disciplines. (1994:\n305)  \nIf the former, we have what Feldman (2012) and others, following\nKornblith (1994a: 3–4), refer to as replacement\nnaturalism. On the latter, weaker reading, on which\nepistemology retains some of its essential (traditional) features and\nmerely “needs help” from other disciplines (Goldman 1986:\n9), we have what Feldman (2012) calls cooperative\nnaturalism and what Goldman elsewhere (1999a) dubs\nmoderate naturalism (see\n Section 5.1\n below). \nIn his own work, Goldman (1999a; 1986; 2005: 403) has emphasized the\nmethodological form or dimension of NE; and it is foremost in the work\nof others as well, including Quine (1969b) and Kornblith (e.g., 2002,\n2007). In terms of the features of TE described above, a commitment to\nmethodological NE would see us rejecting or qualifying both the a priori\ncharacter of epistemology\n (a), understood as a prescriptive claim, and its methodological autonomy (b): on this view, empirical methods and the\nresults obtained thereby have a crucial role to play in epistemological theorizing. \nHaving reviewed some general features of TE, and some of the major\nforms and themes of NE, we will next consider some important and\ninfluential recent versions of NE, using the above features and\ncategories to clarify and facilitate discussion. This survey will\ncenter on recent epistemological developments. However, it bears\nemphasizing once again that NE per se is not itself a recent\nphenomenon: as briefly explained in the next (sub)section, various\nthemes within NE are as much a part of our epistemological inheritance\nas are the usual features of TE. \nWhile Cartesian epistemology offers an especially vivid instance of\nall of the features of TE discussed above, some of those same\ntendencies and concerns are, of course, present in varying degrees in\nthe work of other figures in the epistemological canon. The assumption\nthat epistemology trades in normative matters, and not just\ndescription\n (c),\n and an abiding concern with skepticism\n (d),\n for example, can be seen in much epistemology from Descartes through\nto the present. \nAt the same time, however, many of the same figures’ works\ncomfortably assume features of the naturalistic outlook. So naturalism\nis far from a recent invention; as Kornblith puts it, it has “a\nlong and distinguished heritage” (1999: 158). As the subtitle of\nHume’s most famous work, for example, makes\nclear—“An attempt to introduce the experimental method of\nreasoning into moral [i.e., human] subjects”—his intention\nwas to apply the Newtonian “experimental method” to the\nhuman mind, avoiding “hypotheses” and trying to uncover\nthe most general underlying principles. Only then, he thought, would\nwe be in a position to get our epistemic position into proper\nperspective. Further, the inspiration Hume draws from sciences beyond\n“the science of man” (1739, “Introduction”) to\nwhich he intends his own work to be a contribution, is not merely\nmethodological. He compares his principles of association to gravity,\nfor example, “ideas and impressions” being the relevant\ndomain of “objects” on which those “forces”\noperate (ibid., 1.1.4 para 6). Lastly, according to Barry\nStroud, Hume’s “revolution in philosophy” was his\nuse of this empirical orientation to rein in and replace an overly\nrationalistic conception of cognitive agents: \nThere had traditionally been a largely inherited or a priori framework\nof thinking about human nature—in particular about man’s\nrationality—that Hume seeks both to discredit and to supplant.\n(Stroud 1977: 9) \nOn the face of it, the “skeptical” upshot of Hume’s\nstudy stands in stark contrast to the strong sense of enlightenment\noptimism with which the Treatise begins (compare the\n“Introduction” of the Treatise to Book I’s\n“Conclusion”). But Locke, for example, is more\nconsistently optimistic. His discussion of the nature and extent of\nhuman knowledge is, like Hume’s, preceded and informed by\npsychological theorizing based—to the best of his\nability—on good observational reasoning. Further, Locke insists\nthat it is “[f]olly to expect demonstration in everything”\n(Locke 1690: IV.XI.10), and he defends the information of the senses\nas giving us “an assurance that deserves the name\nknowledge” (ibid., IV.XI.3), notwithstanding the\ntheoretical possibility of our being deceived. This runs counter to\nDescartes’ infallibilism, of course. But it also illustrates the\nabove-mentioned shift, characteristic of NE, away from perfectly\ngeneral questions about the nature and possibility of knowledge to\nunderstanding human knowledge, given the facts of our powers and\nsituation: \n…our faculties being suited not to the full extent of Being,\nnor to a perfect, clear, comprehensive Knowledge of things free from\nall doubt and scruple; but to the preservation of us, in whom they\nare; and accommodated to the use of Life: they serve to our purpose\nwell enough, if they will but give us certain notice of those Things,\nwhich are convenient or inconvenient to us…. (1690:\nIV.XI.8) \nSimilar themes, both methodological and epistemic, are at the\nforefront in Thomas Reid, who begins his first major work as\nfollows: \nWise men now agree, or ought to agree, in this, that there is but one\nway to the knowledge of nature’s works—the way of\nobservation and experiment….All that we know of the body, is\nowing to anatomical dissection and observation, and it must be by an\nanatomy of the mind that we can discover its powers and\nprinciples…. (1764: Chapter 1, Section 1) \nAs to his epistemology, Norman Daniels claims that Reid’s views\ncan be seen as “a precursor to recent work in cognitive\npsychology and ‘naturalized epistemology’” (1989:\n133). And Rysiew (2002) argues that Reid does not entirely separate\npsychological facts from epistemic norms. \nIn general, then, if by “psychologism” we mean simply the\nview that psychology is of direct relevance to certain areas of\nphilosophy—as opposed to its (usually pejorative) usage in\ndenoting the identification of psychological and normative or\nlogical matters—there is ample backing for Goldman’s claim\nthat “[p]sychologistic epistemology…is in the mainstream\nof historical epistemology” (1986:\n 6).[6]\n It was Frege (in The Foundations of Arithmetic, 1884), and\nHusserl (in his “Prolegomena to Pure Logic”, in the\nLogical Investigations, 1900), with their trenchant critiques\nof psychologism in logic and mathematics, who were largely responsible\nfor initiating the sharp turn away from this broadly naturalistic\nstatus quo (see Kusch 2014; see too Kitcher 1992, Goldman\n1986, Kelly 2014, Anderson 2005, and Engel 1998). A key part of\nFrege’s and Husserl’s thinking here was that tying logic\nto psychology was incompatible with preserving its necessary\ncharacter, and with its being knowable a priori. Following\ntheir lead, the logical positivists approached epistemology, as other\nareas, as a matter of a priori “rational\nreconstruction”, in Carnap’s (1928 [1967]) famous phrase.\nSuch reconstruction “replace[d] rationally opaque processes with\ntransparently rational definitions and inferences” (Richardson\n2006: 682). Claims about ordinary objects were given “logical\ndefinitions” in a language that made reference only to\nexperience (sense data); more complex such statements were defined in\nterms of simpler ones, and logical relations between them were made\nexplicit. In none of this was the goal to be faithful to actual\npsychology. \nThe clean separation of psychology from epistemology was enshrined as\nwell in Reichenbach’s famous distinction between the context of\ndiscovery and the context of justification, which he described as\n“a more convenient determination” of rational\nreconstruction (Reichenbach 1938: 6; cf. Richardson 2006: 683).\nReichenbach writes: \nEpistemology does not regard the processes of thinking in their actual\noccurrence; this task is entirely left to psychology. What\nepistemology intends is to construct thinking processes in a way in\nwhich they ought to occur if they are to be ranged in a consistent\nsystem; or to construct justifiable sets of operations which can be\nintercalated between the starting-point and the issue of\nthought-processes, replacing the real intermediate links. Epistemology\nthus considers a logical substitute rather than real processes.\n(Reichenbach 1938: 5) \nWhile enthusiasm for the project of rational reconstruction faded,\nelements of the program—a disinterest in psychology, a\npreference for a formal-logical approach, and a concern with precise\ndefinition of key terms—were retained. It was in this period\nthat “conceptual analysis”, for example, came to\nprominence. \nThe paradigms of epistemology became the logic of confirmation, the\nanalysis of “S knows that p”, and the theory\nof justification or warrant, (Goldman 1986: 7)  \nto none of which was psychology, much less any other empirical\nscience, thought to be relevant. \nJust as very few proponents of TE endorse Descartes’ own\nepistemological views, very few advocates of NE endorse the position\npresented—or seemingly presented—in the paper that is\nthe starting point of contemporary discussions of NE, Quine’s\n“Epistemology Naturalized” (1969b). However, because of\nits undeniable historical importance, and because it will serve to\nintroduce some of the principal objections to NE, it can hardly be\nignored. \nLike Descartes, Quine takes epistemology to be “concerned with\nthe foundations of science” (1969b: 69). Addressing the logical\nempiricist project of rational reconstruction, he says that  \n[t]he Cartesian quest for certainty [is] the remote motivation of\nepistemology, both on its conceptual side and its doctrinal side.\n(1969b: 74)  \nAbout the epistemological project, so understood, Quine’s chief\nobservation is hardly news: the Cartesian quest is “a lost\ncause” (ibid.). Whether in the form Descartes himself\npracticed, or in any subsequent form up to and including the logical\nempiricists’, work on both the conceptual and the doctrinal side\nis bound to fail: no strict translation of the notion of\n“body” in sensory terms is possible, and “the\ninferential steps between sensory evidence and scientific doctrine\nmust fall short of certainty” (1969b: 74–75). \nWhat is new in “Epistemology Naturalized” is what\nQuine recommends in the face of this result: \nWhy all this creative reconstruction, all this make-believe? The\nstimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anybody has\nhad to go on, ultimately, in arriving at his picture of the world. Why\nnot just see how this construction really proceeds? Why not settle for\npsychology? (1969b: 75) \nIf all we hope for is a reconstruction that links science to\nexperience in explicit ways short of translation, then it would seem\nmore sensible to settle for psychology. Better to discover how science\nis in fact developed and learned than to fabricate a fictitious\nstructure to a similar effect. (1969b: 78) \nEpistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a\nchapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a\nnatural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject\nis accorded a certain experimentally controlled input—certain\npatterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for\ninstance—and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as\noutput a description of the three-dimensional external world and its\nhistory. The relation between the meager input and the torrential\noutput is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the\nsame reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to\nsee how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one’s\ntheory of nature transcends any available evidence….But a\nconspicuous difference between old epistemology and the\nepistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that\nwe can now make free use of empirical psychology. (1969b: 82–83)\n \nEven if it would offend strong anti-psychologists, it is not the\nsuggestion that epistemologists make “free use” of\nempirical psychology that is so radical; it is the suggestion that\npsychology can and should replace epistemology. (As\nwe’ll see in\n Section 3.2\n below, in later writings Quine cites other sciences as being relevant\nto epistemology naturalized as well. But that does not affect the\npresent discussion.) In terms of the features of TE laid out above\n (Section 1.1),\n Quine appears here to be rejecting\n (a)–(c)\n altogether: epistemology—“or something like\nit”—is recast as wholly a posteriori,\ndescriptive, and anything but autonomous. As to\n (d),\n the traditional concern with finding an adequate response to the\nskeptic, Quine, in later writings, responds with the claim that\n“skeptical doubts are scientific doubts” (1975: 68): \nScepticism is an offshoot of science. The basis for scepticism is the\naware­ness of illusion, the discovery that we must not always\nbelieve our eyes.…But in what sense are they illusions? In the\nsense that they seem to be material objects which they in fact are\nnot. Illusions are illusions only relative to prior acceptance of\ngenuine bodies with which to contrast them….The positing of\nbodies is already rudimentary physical science; and it is only after\nthat stage that the sceptic’s invidious distinctions make\nsense.…Rudimentary physical science, that is, common sense\nabout bodies, is thus needed as a springboard for scepticism….\n(1975: 67) \nBut if skepticism itself is born of science, we can appeal to science\nin answering its doubts. For instance, we can look to natural\nselection, and find “some encouragement in Darwin” in\nquelling doubts about the reliability of induction: \ncreatures inveterately wrong in their inductions have a pathetic but\npraiseworthy tendency to die out before reproducing more of their\nkind. (1969c: 126) \n(For similar ideas, see Kornblith 1994a and Dretske 1989. For a\ndiscussion of “evolutionary epistemology”, a specific\navenue of study that treats both aspects of human cognition and theory\nchange in science in terms of selectional processes, see Bradie and\nHarms 2015.) \nIn thus deflating the skeptical problem, Quine turns his back on\n (d),\n the final characteristic feature of TE. In terms of the forms of NE\ndiscussed above\n (Section 1.2),\n Quine appears to be recommending replacement naturalism and,\nconsequently, the elimination of terms of epistemic appraisal in favor\nof descriptions of psychological goings-on (eliminative NE). \nUnsurprisingly, given the radical character of the view defended,\nQuine’s “Epistemology Naturalized” has been\nsubjected to heavy\n criticism.[7]\n In this Section, we briefly consider a number of specific objections\nto it that have been presented. As we will see, some of these are more\neasily met, at least prima facie, than others. Others, geared\nas they are towards Quine’s arguments and position in particular, are of\nless general interest. Others still raise issues facing all versions\nof NE—they remain front and center in current discussions of NE\nand its prospects. \n(1) One natural response to Quine’s “Epistemology\nNaturalized” is to see it as involving, in one or another way, a\ngross non sequitur. On one version, this is\nbecause Quine equates TE with Cartesian epistemology; whereas, by the\ntime of his writing, infallibilism had largely fallen out of fashion\n(e.g., Kim 1988: 386–388; Van Fraassen 1995: 82). So too for the\nproject of “rational reconstruction”, “an\nepistemological program”, as Kelly puts it, “that had\nalready been abandoned by the time [Quine] wrote” (2014: 24).\nInstead, by 1969 TE had largely turned to the now-familiar analytic\nprogram of suggesting definitions, or criteria for the application, of\nepistemic terms and concepts, revising these in light of\noften-imaginary counter-examples, and so on (Almeder 1990: 267). (A\nfair snapshot of the then-state of the art would be Knowing:\nEssays on the Analysis of Knowledge, edited by Roth & Galis\n1970.) So, whatever the merits of Quine’s attack on the sort of\nstrong foundationalist program practiced by Descartes and the logical\nempiricists, they fail to motivate any rejection of TE as such. \n(2) A second objection is that Quinean naturalism is viciously\ncircular. Among the central tasks of epistemology, it’s\nsaid, is to establish that empirical knowledge is possible—that\nwe may, for example, legitimately rely upon empirical science as a\nsource of knowledge. However, Quine would have epistemologists make\n“free use” of the results of science from the start. \n(3) A third, related objection is that Quine’s response\nto skepticism is unsatisfactory. Insofar as the challenge\nposed by skepticism is to establish the possibility of knowledge,\nmaking use of certain methods of belief-formation, common-sensical or\notherwise, is hardly going to strike the skeptic as legitimate:\n“Such attempts to respond to the skeptic’s concerns\ninvolve blatant, indeed pathetic, circularity” (Fumerton 1994:\n338). Granted, Quine claims that skeptical arguments inevitably trade\non the fact of illusions, which would seem to make (other) appeals to\ncommon sense fair game. According to BonJour, however, \n[t]he fundamental skeptical move is to challenge the adequacy of our\nreasons for accepting our beliefs, and such a challenge can be mounted\nwithout any appeal to illusion. (1994: 288) \nAnd even in the case of illusions, skepticism requires only their\npossibility, not their reality (Stroud 1981, 1984: Ch. VI; compare\nFeldman 2012: Section 3). \n(4) Fourth, and perhaps best known, is the objection that, in\nrecasting epistemology as “a chapter of psychology”, Quine\nis stripping away any concern with epistemic\nnormativity. (Hence, that his endorsement of\nreplacement naturalism has eliminativism as a consequence.) The\ncomplaint here is not merely that normativity is a feature of\nTE\n (Section 1.1);\n it is that a concern with normative epistemic matters is\nessential to epistemology per se. Jaegwon Kim, the\nforemost author of this complaint, takes the abandonment of\nnormativity to be what’s really distinctive about Quine’s\nproposal: \nHe is asking us to set aside the entire framework of\njustification-centered epistemology. That is what is new in Quine’s\nproposals. Quine is asking us to put in its place a purely\ndescriptive, causal-nomological science of human cognition. (Kim 1988:\n388) \nQuine does, of course, speak of NE as investigating “how\nevidence relates to theory”, but this claim is misleading. Since\n“evidence” here is proxy for certain causal-nomological\nrelations, the claim “suggests a conflation of causal and\nevidential relations” (Grandy 1994: 345; cf. Sellars 1956: Sec\n32; Siegel 1980: 318–319; Lehrer 1990: 168–172). Evidence as it relates to justification is what concerns the\nepistemologist. Justification is the central epistemic notion—it\nmakes up the difference between mere true belief and knowledge\n(modulo Gettier), and is the locus of specifically epistemic\nnormativity. Thus, to jettison justification is to abandon any concern\nwith normativity; and without such a concern, whatever we’re\ndoing, it’s not deserving of the title\n“epistemology”: \n…it is difficult to see how an “epistemology” that\nhas been purged of normativity, one that lacks an appropriate\nnormative concept of justification or evidence, can have anything to\ndo with the concerns of traditional epistemology. And unless\nnaturalized epistemology and classical epistemology share some of\ntheir central concerns, it’s difficult to see how one could replace\nthe other, or be a way (a better way) of doing the other…. For\nepistemology to go out of the business of justification is for it to\ngo out of business. (Kim 1988:\n 391)[8] \n(5) A final objection that has been presented in various forms (e.g.,\nBealer 1992, Kaplan 1994, BonJour 1994, Siegel 1984, Brandom 1998) is\nthat Quine’s position is self-defeating. For\nexample, part of Quine’s argument for the idea that “the\nold epistemology” is doomed is his rejection of the a\npriori—feature\n (a)\n of TE\n (Section 1.1).\n However, as Mark Kaplan puts it, to convince of us this, and of the\ndisreputability of “[t]he a priorism involved in the traditional\nsort of armchair methodological research”, “what the\nproponents of naturalism have offered us is a series of\narguments” (1994: 359). But it seems that nothing in\nepistemology as Quine conceives of it affords us the resources for\nevaluating such arguments: \n…are [naturalists’] arguments cogent? So long as\nthe naturalists mean to be showing their audience in spoken word and\nin print that their doctrines are correct, this question will be an\nurgent one. But how are we supposed to go about trying to answer it?\nWhat are we to do—what can we do—to decide whether the\nnaturalists’ arguments are cogent? \nIt is hard to see what we can do except evaluate these arguments by\nthe light of the very sorts of epistemic intuitions which the\nnaturalists are so eager to disparage. (Kaplan 1994: 360; cf. Almeder\n1990: 266–267) \nIn this way, NE itself requires or presumes the legitimacy of appeals\nto a priori or “armchair” intuition, such appeals\nbeing a key element within what George Bealer has called “the\nstandard justificatory procedure” in philosophy (Bealer 1992).\nSo the position of the proponent of NE is\nself-defeating—“it seeks to justify naturalized\nepistemology in precisely the way in which, according to it,\njustification cannot be had” (Siegel 1984: 675). \nVarious responses to the preceding objections have been suggested.\nAddressing the first will give us occasion to clarify typical current\nnaturalists’ motivations, as well as—and\nrelatedly—to get a better sense of what is, and is not, central\nto NE. Addressing the fourth and fifth will carry us beyond Quine and\ninto the heart of current disagreements with, and within, NE. \n(1) Recall, first, the non sequitur\nobjection, according to which Quine falsely equates TE with Cartesian\nepistemology. One response is that Quine’s arguments\nsurvive—at least in spirit—the recognition that many\nepistemologists had/have already moved away from infallibilistic\nrequirements on foundational beliefs, and that even in its more\nlenient forms, “[f]oundationalism has simply failed to deliver\nthe goods” (Kornblith 1995: 238). For the looser we make the\nrequirements on justified beliefs in answer to our pretheoretic\nintuitions, the less we’re learning about knowledge, the less\nwe’re seriously engaged with answering the skeptic, and the less\nwe stand to gain any substantial epistemic advice (beyond, “keep\nbelieving more or less what you already believed”) (1995: 239).\nSo foundationalism, in whatever form, “is an idea which [has]\nsimply failed to work out” (1995:\n 239).[9] \nA different line of response to the non sequitur objection is\nsimply to grant the point, but observe that, Quine’s arguments\nnotwithstanding, more recent naturalists have not been motivated by\nthe failure of Cartesian epistemology. Rather, they have\nsought to find an alternative to what was seen as a stagnating or\notherwise unsatisfactory traditional approach. For instance, failed\nattempts to solve the Gettier problem by requiring more, and more\nsubtle, logical relations among propositions, seemed to ignore the\nfact that, unless the subject’s psychology aligns with the\nsuggested requirements, the proposed analysis will fail (Kitcher 1992:\n59–60). Thus, Goldman’s early causal theory of\nknowing—an early appearance of NE in the aforementioned Roth\n& Galis volume—was expressly presented as an alternative\nto \na well-established tradition in epistemology, the view that\nepistemological questions are questions of logic or justification, not\ncausal or genetic questions. (Goldman 1967: 82) \nAlong the same lines, when, at the end of his “Discrimination\nand Perceptual Knowledge”, Goldman contrasts his approach with\nthat of Descartes, it’s not the latter’s infallibilism\nthat gets special attention, but rather issues of a broadly\nexplanatory-methodological nature: \nThe trouble with many philosophical treatments of knowledge is that\nthey are inspired by Cartesian-like conceptions of justification or\nvindication. There is a consequent tendency to overintellectualize or\noverrationalize the notion of knowledge. In the spirit of naturalistic\nepistemology, I am trying to fashion an account of knowing that\nfocuses on more primitive and pervasive aspects of cognitive life, in\nconnection with which, I believe, the term “know” gets its\napplication. A fundamental facet of animate life, both human and\ninfra-human, is telling things apart, distinguishing predator from\nprey, for example, or a protective habitat from a threatening one. The\nconcept of knowledge has its roots in this kind of cognitive activity.\n(Goldman 1976: 102) \nOther naturalistic treatments of knowledge were similarly motivated.\nFor instance, Dretske’s (1981) information-theoretic account was\nan attempt to move beyond justification-centered accounts of\nknowledge—accounts which took it for granted that knowledge\nrequired justification, the task then being to find what special\ncombination of other ingredients must be added to yield knowledge.\nAccording to Dretske, such an approach faces “a variety of\ncrippling objections” (1981: 85). In addition, “[t]he\nconcept of justification (or some related epistemic notion)\nis often taken to be primitive”, with theorists using \nfirmer intuitions about when, and whether, someone knows something to\ndetermine when, and whether, someone has a satisfactory level of\njustification. (1981: 249) \nFinally, like Goldman, Dretske associates justificationist accounts of\nknowledge with a tendency to over-intellectualize epistemic phenomena,\nto focus on “fancier” cases of knowing, cases which bring\nin (what he sees as) extraneous factors. The result is that the\ntheorist is left having to reject some very clear cases of\nknowledge—in children, non-human animals, and unreflective\nadults—as not genuine knowledge at all (Dretske 1991). His own\naccount of knowledge, \nis an attempt to get away from the philosopher’s usual bag of tricks\n(justification, reasons, evidence, etc.) in order to give a more\nrealistic picture of what perceptual knowledge is. (1983: 58) \nThe same kind of broad methodological concerns are evident as well in\nnaturalistic accounts of justification (warrant, etc.), rather than\nknowledge. Goldman’s reliabilism about justification (1979), for\nexample, has among its starting points a critique of\n“ahistorical”, apsychological accounts of\njustification—i.e., accounts which state conditions on a\nbelief’s being justified \nwithout restriction on why the belief is held, i.e., on what\ncausally initiates the belief or causally sustains\nit. (1979:\n 112)[10] \nAlso worth noting here are a pair of more strictly\nmeta-epistemological desiderata Goldman announces at the\nstart of the same paper. The first is that an account of justification\nshould be “substantive”—i.e., that it should specify\nin non-epistemic terms when a belief is justified (p. 105). This\nrecalls, of course, meta-epistemic NE\n (Section 1.2)—i.e.,\n the thought that evaluative epistemic properties are, or must be,\nreducible or otherwise appropriately related to (e.g., supervene on)\n“natural” properties. And it is sometimes suggested that\nthis—the demand, as Maffie puts it, that\n“epistemic value [be] anchored to descriptive fact, no longer\nentering the world autonomously as brute, fundamental fact”\n(1990a: 284)—is central to the debate over NE (ibid.;\nSteup 1996: 185–6). According to Kim, that epistemic properties\ndo plausibly supervene on “natural facts” is what\nmakes normative epistemology possible, and naturalistically\nrespectable, even if no\n reduction[11]\n is forthcoming: \n…is there a positive reason for thinking that normative\nepistemology is a viable program?…. The short answer is this:\nwe believe in the supervenience of epistemic properties on\nnaturalistic ones, and more generally, in the supervenience of all\nvaluational and normative properties on naturalistic\nconditions…. That [a given belief] is a justified belief cannot\nbe a brute fundamental fact unrelated to the kind of belief it is.\nThere must be a reason for it, and this reason must be\ngrounded in the factual descriptive properties of that particular\nbelief. Something like this, I think, is what we believe. (Kim 1988:\n399) \nAs others have observed, however, it is doubtful that the question of\nwhether epistemic properties at least supervene upon natural\nproperties—hence, meta-epistemic NE, as written—sheds much\nlight on the NE-vs-TE controversy (see Foley 1994: 243–244;\nFeldman 2012: Section 4; Maffie 1990a: 289; Kappel 2011: 839). For\nvirtually everyone on both sides of that debate can be seen as\nagreeing that epistemic properties supervene. (The notable exception\nhere is Lehrer 1997.) For example, Chisholm, who is hardly thought to\nbe an advocate of NE, is explicit in holding that epistemic facts\nsupervene on non-epistemic ones (1989: 42–43; cf. 1957:\n31–39; 1982: 12)—for instance, that being appeared to in\ncertain ways makes it evident to S that he is appeared to by\nan F, or makes S justified in believing that there\nis an F before him. And Feldman (2012) argues that\nevidentialism—which is usually regarded as an instance of TE,\nnot NE—respects supervenience as well. (Evidentialism has it\nthat what determines whether one is justified is a function of the\nevidence possessed, where one’s evidence, on the view Feldman\nhimself favors, is some combination of one’s experiences,\nmemories and other beliefs.) \nSo we do not yet have a plausible candidate, in the vicinity of\nmeta-epistemic NE, of something on which proponents of TE and NE might\nclearly divide. Taking Goldman as our representative of NE, we find a\nsuggestion in his second desideratum—namely, that an\naccount of justification be genuinely explanatory, or\n“appropriately deep and revelatory” (1979: 106). He\nwrites: \nSuppose, for example, that the following sufficient condition of\njustified belief is offered: “If S senses redly at\nt and S believes at t that he is sensing\nredly, then S’s belief at t that he is sensing\nredly is justified”. This is not the kind of principle I seek;\nfor, even if it is correct, it leaves unexplained why a\nperson who senses redly and believes that he does, believes this\njustifiably. (1979: 106) \nSo, while the stated Chisholmian principle itself respects\nsupervenience—what’s mentioned in its antecedent is,\nplausibly, wholly psychological—it fails to be genuinely\nilluminating. As Feldman says, Chisholm holds that, underlying\nparticular epistemic facts such as the one Goldman mentions are\n“principles of evidence other than the formal principles of\ndeductive logic and inductive logic” (Chisholm 1977: 67) which\nare themselves fundamental. Further, Feldman continues,\nsomething similar is true of traditionalists more generally: \nIn addition to facts about particular people being justified in\nbelieving particular propositions, [traditionalists] are committed to\nthe existence of epistemic facts about what beliefs are supported by a\nparticular body of evidence. It remains unclear whether these are\nnatural facts. Traditionalists often regard these facts as necessary\ntruths, and it is their necessity that enables evidentialists to\nendorse the supervenience thesis. [On standard definitions of\nsupervenience, necessary truths supervene on any facts—so,\ntrivially, they supervene on natural facts.]….[But it] is\nlegitimate to ask whether they count as natural facts. (Feldman 2012:\nSection 4) \nHowever, regardless of the answer to the latter question, construed as\na metaphysical query, it is clear that the relevant\nmeta-epistemological concern of Goldman’s, at least, is\nmethodological: he wants to explain justification,\nand thinks that an appeal to the reliability of the processes which\ngenerate and sustain a belief, for example, does just that, whereas an\nappeal to Chisholmian—or, presumably,\nevidentialist—principles does not. Similar concerns would apply\nto Chisholm’s (1977) taking reasonableness as\n primitive[12]\n and casting other central epistemic notions in terms of it (as Lehrer\nwould later do; see his 1990: 127): while this is compatible with\nthere in fact being some naturalistic basis for\n reasonableness[13]—i.e.,\n with reasonableness being part of the real, natural world—the\nresulting account would not be “appropriately deep and\nrevelatory”. \nOf course, opponents of NE may contest this claim and hold that there\njust are brute epistemic principles and sui generis epistemic\nproperties—as Chisholm, Lehrer, and perhaps many other\ntraditionalists believe (Fumerton, e.g., is quite explicit about this;\n1988: 454–455). And, as Feldman (2012: Section 4) notes, the\ndisagreement here appears to be over what is natural, as opposed to\nover whether extra-natural facts exist. Nevertheless, the present\npoint is that the attempt to avoid any such fundamental epistemic\nproperties or principles in one’s theorizing appears to be a\nreal difference between NE and TE, and seems to be of more central\nimportance than a concern for reduction-or-supervenience per\nse. In any case, it should now be clear that current naturalists\nare not directly inspired by the failure of specifically Cartesian\nepistemology. So even if it’s a mistake on Quine’s part to\nrepresent NE as having such a source, that point does not seem\ndirectly relevant here. \n(2) Turning now to the circularity objection, Quine\nhimself addresses it when he says: \nIf the epistemologist’s goal is validation of the grounds of\nempirical science, he defeats his purpose by using psychology or other\nempirical science in the validation. However, such scruples against\ncircularity have little point once we have stopped dreaming of\ndeducing science from observations. (1969b: 75–76) \nMoreover, this rejoinder aside, it may be that “we should expect\nquestion begging when the issue concerns our most fundamental methods\nof inquiry” (Foley 1994: 256). Further, there is no guarantee\nanyway that a given method will vindicate itself—a method may\ngenerate evidence that undermines its own reliability\n(ibid.). Finally, just when (if ever) circularity is\nepistemically bad, and why, is a matter of some controversy. (For\ngeneral discussion and references, see Lammenranta n.d. in Other\nInternet Resources; see too Kappel 2011: 843.) \n(3) Broadly similar remarks have been suggested in reply to the\nobjection that Quine’s response to skepticism is\nunsatisfactory. While that response may involve blatant\ncircularity, for the reasons just given it’s an open question\nwhether that circularity is vicious. Further, Quine claims, in pointing out that\nskeptical doubts are scientific doubts, he did not take himself to be\nrefuting the skeptic or subjecting skepticism to a reductio\n(1975: 68). More generally, questions might be raised about the\nunderlying assumption that responding to the skeptic in such a way as\nto not beg any questions is an achievable end to begin with, and so\nwhether it is something that deserves as much attention as it has traditionally been\nafforded. Here, proponents of NE diverge somewhat. Kornblith states\nthat the project of responding to the skeptic is “a dead\nend” (1999: 166). In a similar vein, Kitcher says that\n“[s]keptics who insist that we begin from no\nassumptions are inviting us to play a mug’s game” (1993:\n35). Dretske (1970, 1981) is more conciliatory, offering an\nexplanation that grants certain skeptical claims their power, even\ncorrectness, while defending our knowledge nonetheless. And both\nGoldman (1986: 39–41, 55–57; 1976: 101) and Pollock (1986:\n1–7) take it to be a task of epistemology to address\nskepticism—even if our goal therein is to understand and learn\nfrom skepticism rather than to refute it, and even if the topic deserves less\nattention than it has historically received. \n(4) Kornblith sums up the normativity objection as\nfollows: “Epistemology without normativity…is just\nHamlet without the prince of Denmark” (1995: 250). As\nwe saw above, it looks as though handing epistemology off to\npsychology (replacement NE) makes epistemology a purely descriptive\nenterprise (hence, yields eliminative NE). Certainly, Quine\nis hardly friendly to epistemology as standardly practiced.\nFor example, he thinks that, as it’s usually understood, the\nnotion of knowledge is so beset by imprecision that, for theoretical\npurposes, we should “give [it] up… as a bad job”\n(1989: 109; see too Johnsen 2005: 92–93). And no doubt\n“Epistemology Naturalized” encourages the standard\ninterpretation of Quine as jettisoning a concern for normative\nepistemic matters. Nonetheless, as recent commentators have pointed\nout (see, e.g., Foley 1994 and Johnsen 2005; both cite numerous\nexamples of the standard interpretation), in his later work, Quine\ninsists that “[t]he normative is naturalized, not dropped”\n(1990: 229). He writes: \nNaturalization of epistemology does not jettison the normative and\nsettle for the indiscriminate description of ongoing procedures. For\nme normative epistemology is a branch of engineering. It is the\ntechnology of truth-seeking, or, in a more cautiously epistemological\nterm, prediction. Like any technology, it makes free use of whatever\nscientific findings may suit its purpose. It draws upon mathematics in\ncomputing standard deviation and probable error and in scouting the\ngambler’s fallacy. It draws upon experimental psychology in\nexposing perceptual illusions, and upon cognitive psychology in\nscouting wishful thinking. It draws upon neurology and physics, in a\ngeneral way, in discounting testimony from occult or parapsychological\nsources. There is no question here of ultimate value, as in morals; it\nis a matter of efficacy for an ulterior end, truth or prediction. The\nnormative here, as elsewhere in engineering, becomes descriptive when\nthe terminal parameter is expressed. (Quine 1986: 664–665) \nFor Quine, then, epistemic normativity is simply a matter of\ninstrumental efficacy towards the relevant end—viz., truth or\nprediction. Thus, normative epistemology “gets naturalized into\na chapter of engineering: the technology of anticipating sensory\nstimulation” (1992: 19). He continues: \nThe most notable norm of naturalized epistemology actually coincides\nwith that of traditional epistemology. It is simply the watchword of\nempiricism: nihil in mente quod non prius in sensu. This is a\nprime specimen of naturalized epistemology, for it is a finding of\nnatural science itself, however fallible, that our information about\nthe world comes only through the impact of our sensory receptors. And\nstill the point is normative, warning us against telepaths and\nsoothsayers. (Quine 1992: 19) \n(5) So Quine does have an account of epistemic normativity after all,\nand thus a response to the normativity objection to (his version of)\nNE. And yet, one might see that response as inviting once again the\ncharge of self-defeat. For example, one might wonder\nwhy it is truth, or prediction—rather than\npleasure, say, or monetary gain—that is the epistemic end. Is\nthat a result of science, discovered a posteriori\n(compare Foley 1994: 249)? A friend of TE is likely to see it, rather,\nas a conceptual truth that is knowable, intuitively, a priori. Similarly, one can wonder whether natural science per\nse really does underwrite the putative empiricist\n“watchword”. Much recent developmental psychology, for\ninstance, seems to suggest that at least some empirical\n“knowledge” (or empirical “theories” or\n“assumptions”) is native, rather than sensorily acquired\n(see Samet and Zaitchik 2014 for an overview).—Not that such a\ncontrary finding, or theoretical disagreement on the matter within the\nrelevant sciences, would itself pose a problem for Quine’s\ngeneral approach to NE. The relevant point, rather, is that the matter\nand disagreement in question are theoretical, and that it is\nnot immediately clear whether it is something that can be settled\nwithout the help of “old-fashioned” methods such as\narmchair reflection, some of it perhaps a priori, on the\nrelevant data and issues. (The present worry could be developed along\nother lines—e.g., that natural science presupposes that\ntruth or prediction is the end, that the senses are what give us\ninformation about the world, etc. This would take us back to worries\nabout circularity. As we’ve already seen, there is inter-play\nbetween the concerns to which NE gives rise.) \nNonetheless, while he is best-known for taking psychology—and,\nwhat’s more, behavioristic psychology (“neural receptors\nand their stimulation rather than sense of\n sensibilia”[14]\n (Quine 1992: 19))—to be the successor to TE, Quine has a\nvery broad conception of science. Science for Quine includes\nhumble, everyday common sense thinking, after all. Further, while he\nsometimes speaks of one discipline replacing another, Quine also\nexpresses his idea in terms of the “rubbing out” (1969b:\n90) or “blurring” (1995: 257) of disciplinary boundaries\nsuch as that between epistemology and science. Finally, given his\nrejection of analyticity, his consequent rejection of the a\n priori,[15]\n and his holism about both meaning and confirmation, it is quite\nunclear how Quine could maintain any hard and fast\ndistinction between philosophy and science (Gregory 2006: 660). For\nthese reasons, it is unclear whether the entirety of traditional\nphilosophical methods per se would—or could—be\nexcluded from a respectable Quinean\n epistemology.[16]\n Unfortunately, Quine himself does not provide a clear and direct\naccount of what, notwithstanding the rejection of the a\npriori, might indeed remain of TE and its method within\n“epistemology naturalized”. \nWhere we are left, then, is needing a way of understanding how, within\nthe constraints of NE, truth (or prediction) comes to be fixed as the\nepistemic end, such that the normativity objection can be fully met.\nMore generally, we need some respectable naturalistic version of traditional\nphilosophical methods (reflecting on cases, consulting our intuitions,\nand so on), or of alternative methods closely approximating them. For\nit seems that it is only if we have something playing those\nmethods’ usual role—constructing and arbitrating between\ntheories, directing our more obviously empirical inquiries, and so\non—that the charge of self-defeat can be avoided. \nBoth of these matters—the ability of NE to account for epistemic\nnormativity, and to accommodate or find a suitable replacement for the\ntraditional philosophical methodology that some see as indispensible\nto epistemological theorizing—are at the center of current\ndebate both about, and within, NE. Over the next two sections we\nconsider two prominent means of addressing these matters—those\noffered by Hilary Kornblith and by Alvin Goldman—and the\nchallenges that each faces. \nUnlike Quine, Kornblith retains knowledge as a central epistemological\nnotion. However, his position departs dramatically from TE in how it understands the\nnature of epistemological investigation. Here, in both\nits proper target and its methods, epistemology is held not to be as\nTE and its practitioners portray them. As to the first, recall\n (Section 1.3)\n that a, if not the, central task of analytic epistemology following\nthe demise of logical empiricism was “the analysis of\nknowledge”, by which was meant the attempt to provide an\nanalysis, typically in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions,\nof the concept of knowledge. (See, for instance, the various\npapers in the aforementioned Roth and Galis volume.) Against this, it\nis suggested that the concept of knowledge is of little if any\ntheoretical interest; it is no more the proper target of\nepistemological theory than the concept of aluminum is a\nworthy target of inquiry for one trying to understand various metals.\nLikely, Kornblith says, our concept of knowledge is defective in\nvarious ways anyway. (For example, in spite of its now near-universal\nrejection among epistemologists, the idea that knowledge required\ncertainty enjoyed the favor of many, and is arguably still attractive\namong many non-philosophers.) What epistemologists should\nseek is “to provide an account of a certain natural phenomenon,\nnamely, knowledge itself” (1999: 161). “It is the\ninvestigation of knowledge as a phenomenon in the world”, he\nwrites, “which distinguishes naturalism from other approaches to\nknowledge” (1995: 245). \nAs to method, the epistemologist should proceed as would our imagined\nmetallurgist: we begin by examining apparently clear cases of\nknowledge, and look to find what they have in common. Part of what\nhappens here, very likely, is that we will reclassify some of these\nexamples along the way. What emerges, however, is a picture of the\ntrue nature of knowledge. Specifically, and as is evident in the work\nof cognitive ethologists in particular—that is, those whose job\nit is to study intelligent animal behavior—what emerges is an\nessentially reliabilist picture, in which knowledge consists in \ntrue beliefs that are reliably produced, that are instrumental\nin the production of behavior successful in meeting biological needs\nand thereby implicated in the Darwinian explanation of the selective\nretention of traits. (Kornblith 2002: 62) \nKnowledge, on this view, is a natural kind, one that’s realized\nin both human and non-human animals. It has a particular nature, and a\nparticular causal-explanatory role in our general understanding of the\nlife and success of certain types of biological organisms. In better\nunderstanding that place, and through an empirical investigation of\n \nthe various mechanisms of belief production and retention, we may\ndetermine where we are most in need of guidance, and what steps can be\ntaken, given our capabilities, to overcome our shortcomings.\n(Kornblith 1999: 163; on NE and epistemic improvement, see too\nKornblith’s 1994b) \nSo, both at the stage of understanding the worldly epistemological\ntarget, and in recommending possible improvements to our epistemic\nstrategies, “a proper naturalistic epistemology is empirical all\nthe way down” (Kornblith 1995: 243). While epistemology thus has\nno distinctive method, there is a sense, Kornblith thinks, in\nwhich it retains its autonomy: \nQuestions about knowledge and justification, questions about theory\nand evidence, are...legitimate questions, and they are ones in which\nphilosophy has a special stake….If the autonomy of a discipline\nconsists in dealing with a distinctive set of questions, or in\napproaching certain phenomena with a distinctive set of concerns, then\nphilosophy is surely an autonomous discipline. There is no danger that\nthese questions and concerns will be somehow co-opted by other\ndisciplines. (Kornblith 2002: 26) \nWhile Kornblith thus denies that epistemology is to be replaced by\nsome other discipline(s) (replacement NE), it is perhaps less clear\nwhat becomes of the normativity of epistemology on\nhis view. Unlike Quine as he is standardly\ninterpreted—but as appears to be Quine’s view in\nlater writings—Kornblith is “quite sympathetic with the\nsuggestion that the normative dimension of epistemological inquiry is\nessential to it” (Kornblith 1995: 250). And Kornblith, like\nreliabilists generally, portrays truth (true belief) as the epistemic\ngoal—much as Quine, in describing his view of the normative\ndimension of epistemology\n (Section 3),\n presumes that truth (or prediction) is “the terminal\nparameter”. But how is that fact established, such that a\n“thoroughly empirical” (1995: 250) epistemology can, after\nall, retain the normative dimension of TE? \nOne response to this question is that epistemic norms have a\n“practical grounding” (Kornblith 1993b, 2002). While it is\ncompatible with the possible intrinsic value of true belief (Kornblith\n2002: 161, 373), such an account features its instrumental value.\nImportantly, however, the argument is not cast (just) in terms of the\ninstrumental value of individual true beliefs; the central claim,\nrather, is that everyone “has pragmatic reasons to favor a\ncognitive system which is effective in generating truths” (2002:\n156). This point can perhaps be best illustrated by considering an\nalternative naturalistic account of the source of epistemic\nnormativity—the “pragmatist” account favored by\nStephen Stich (1990, 1993). \nAccording to Stich, there is nothing special about truth, and no\nreason to take it to be the epistemic goal. In fact, for pragmatists,\nthere are no special cognitive or epistemological values at\nall—“[t]here are just values” (1993: 9). Good\nreasoning is a matter of effectively promoting your goals (what\nyou value), whatever they are. Stich says that, “the\npragmatist project for assessing reasoning” proceeds by\ndetermining one’s goals—what one wants to\nachieve—and then identifying the reasoning strategies that\nothers have successfully employed in achieving those same goals\n(ibid: 9–10). However, it is hard to see how this is to\nbe done unless one has some reliable cognitive systems or strategies\nin place. That is, even if happiness, say, rather than true belief, is\nwhat one really values, in order to effectively pursue that goal one\nwill need some way of determining how best to achieve it. One will\nneed, that is, a (reasonably) reliable cognitive system—or, to\nput it in more traditional terms, one will need some reliable\nfaculties. Further, \n[p]recisely because our cognitive systems are required to perform\nevaluations relative to our many concerns, and to perform these\nevaluations accurately, the standards by which we evaluate these\ncognitive systems themselves must remain insulated from most of what\nwe intrinsically value, whatever we may value. (Kornblith 2002:\n158) \nSo, whatever else one cares about, one has an interest in—one\nshould care about—having a cognitive system (or systems) that\nproduces true beliefs reliably; and one has an interest in—a reason\nto care about—evaluating, not just individual beliefs, but our\nvarious systems and methods for producing them, in terms of their\nreliability. “And this”, as Kornblith says, “is\nprecisely what epistemic evaluation is all about. Truth plays a\npre-eminent role here” (2002: 158). \nWhether one finds the preceding account of the grounding of epistemic\nnormativity satisfactory will depend largely upon how one conceives of\nepistemic normativity, even normativity generally, to begin with. For\nexample, the above argument seems to rely upon the instrumental or\nmeans-end norm. Speaking of his own view, which is in this respect\nsimilar to Kornblith’s, Maffie says:  \nepistemology is normative only within the framework of instrumental\nreason and…its normativity is parasitic upon that of the\nlatter. (1990b: 333)  \nThere is debate, however, about the nature and status of instrumental\nreason, as well as about whether a reliance upon it should be acceptable\nto a naturalist. (See, e.g., Hampton 1992, Dreier 2001, Siegel\n 1990;[17]\n for general discussion, see Wallace 2014.) So too, some philosophers\nregard epistemic norms as categorical—as binding on any rational\nagent, regardless of the goals or desires which s/he happens to have\n(Kelly 2003: 616, 621). Now, there are no specific goals or\ndesires that one must have in order to be so bound, according to\nKornblith: his argument requires only that one have some\ngoals. Since this condition is fulfilled in all normal humans the\nhypothetical norm—“If you have some desire or goal you\nwish to satisfy or attain, seek the truth”—is in\neffect a categorical one (it is “universal”, as\nKornblith puts it; 2002: 161). However, some may find even this still\ntoo contingent a ground upon which to base epistemic norms. (Compare\nHusserl’s and Frege’s concerns about the intrusion of\npsychology into logic and mathematics;\n Section 1.3.)\n Others, on the other hand, may doubt whether TE itself has ever been\nable to provide any entirely unconditional recommendations (e.g.,\nGrandy 1994: 345). And Kornblith, like other naturalists, is bound to\nquestion whether attempting to understand epistemic normativity while\nsetting aside such obvious and inescapable facts as that we do have\ngoals and desires is likely to yield any useful insight into our\nactual epistemic situation (see, e.g., Kornblith 1995: 251, and Wrenn\n2006: 73, commenting on Goldman 1986).[18] \nAs we saw previously, one prevalent form of the\nself-defeat objection to NE is that it inevitably\nitself relies upon “[t]he a priorism involved in the traditional\nsort of armchair methodological research” (Kaplan 1994: 359) and\nthat it makes use of “the very sorts of epistemic intuitions which the\nnaturalists are so eager to disparage” (ibid.: 360; cf.\nAlmeder 1990: 266–267). In this way, EN itself requires or\npresumes the legitimacy of appeals to a priori or\n“armchair” intuition, such appeals being a key element of “the standard\njustificatory procedure” in philosophy (Bealer 1992). So the\nposition of the proponent of NE is self-defeating—“it\nseeks to justify naturalized epistemology in precisely the way in\nwhich, according to it, justification cannot be had” (Siegel\n1984: 675). \nAccording to the form of NE currently being considered, a reliance on\nintuitions, particularly in the early stages of inquiry, may be\npractically necessary. However, it may be argued that “the\nmethod of appeals to intuitions is…easily accommodated within a\nnaturalistic framework” (Kornblith 2002: 12). Thus, were you to\ndescribe to me a certain animal you observed in your back yard, I\nmight naturally and correctly judge it to have been a squirrel.\nClearly, this does not involve or require any a priori\ninsight on my part; it simply reflects some easily gotten knowledge\nabout the relevant local fauna. In the same way, Kornblith\nthinks, our seemingly spontaneous judgments about whether this or that\nactual or hypothetical case constitutes an instance of knowledge is an\na posteriori judgment, backed by our already-acquired\nknowledge of the relevant worldly epistemic phenomenon. So\n“appeals to intuition do not require some non-natural faculty or\na priori judgment of any sort….The practice of appealing to\nintuition has no non-natural ingredients” (2002:\n 21).[19] \nWhat of the charge that, in presenting various philosophical\narguments, the naturalist is tacitly relying upon various principles\nof good reasoning, themselves known only a priori (e.g.,\nBonJour 1994)? One obvious response is that this begs the question. On\na reliabilist view, the legitimacy of the relevant principles of\nreasoning—what makes them good principles—is a function of\nwhether they are, in fact, reliable. They needn’t be known to be\nsuch, much less must they be known to be such a priori\n(Kornblith 2002: 21–23; 1995: 252). So the objector “is\nsimply taking for granted certain constraints on good reasoning which\nthe naturalist rejects” (1995: 253). Moreover, there is the\nconcern that such constraints, if consistently applied, would\nrarely if ever be satisfied. Insofar as they have such skeptical\nconsequences, such constraints cannot be reasonable (1995: 253; 2006:\n347–348). \nAs with his response to the normativity problem, there are questions\nas to whether Kornblith’s attempt to diffuse the self-defeat\nobjection is successful. For example, both BonJour (2006) and Siegel\n(2006) have replied to Kornblith’s arguments, claiming that the\nthreat of self-defeat is as strong as ever. For instance, Siegel\nclaims that “it is unclear how [Kornblith’s] appeal to\nreliabilism can be justified without either contravening naturalism or\npresupposing it” (2006: 246–248; cf. Kappel 2010: 845).\nOr, to take another example, Kornblith at one point says in passing that “knowledge is, surely, more than just true belief” (2002:\n54), and a proponent of TE might wonder what justifies that\nclaim. Of course, it is not difficult to imagine how Kornblith is apt\nto respond to such worries—that knowledge involves reliably\nproduced true belief is an empirical discovery, arrived at by\nstudying apparently clear cases of the phenomenon. There may be some\ncircularity here, but no more than is involved in Siegel’s or\nBonJour’s pointing to some cases and saying, with the presumed\nbacking of rational insight, that they reveal what knowledge\n(justification, rationality, etc.) really is. \nObviously, there is to be no fast and easy resolution of this\ndebate—not least because the nature of status of the a\npriori, as well as what is required for knowledge, for example,\nare themselves hotly contested. (For general discussion of the a\npriori, see Russell 2014; for a representative sampling of\ncurrent work on the topic, see Casullo and Thurow 2013. Ichikawa and\nSteup 2014 provide an overview of issues surrounding knowledge.) For\nour purposes, however, what is especially noteworthy is that some of\nthe very same worries as Siegel and BonJour register about\nKornblith’s attempt to cast epistemology as “empirical all\nthe way down” have been voiced by Alvin Goldman, himself an\nextremely prominent advocate of NE: \nWhere does the assertion that knowledge is “more than just true\nbelief” come from? What licenses it? Surely it doesn’t\ncome from cognitive ethology. It would have to come, one supposes,\nfrom a semantico-conceptual account of the term\n“knowledge”. But many would say that this is precisely\nwhat philosophy, in its analytic phase, aims to provide. So that job\nis not taken over by biological science, as Kornblith often suggests\nthat it is. (2005: 407) \nAs the passage just quoted suggests, Goldman sees conceptual analysis\nand appeals to intuition as playing an ineliminable role within\nepistemological\n practice.[20]\n While, as noted above, within TE such an analysis has standardly\ntaken the form of a search for necessary and sufficient conditions,\nGoldman is dubious of that specific approach (e.g., 1986: 38–39,\n2015, 2007: 23 and papers there cited). Nonetheless, he insists that\n“armchair” conceptual investigation must be the starting\npoint of epistemological theorizing. For this reason he is dubious\nthat a satisfactory epistemology can be entirely concerned with\n“extra-mental phenomena”. In his most recent writing on\nthe subject, Goldman frames the problem (as he sees it) for\nKornblith’s view as follows: \n…for a given analysandum, there will often be multiple\ncandidates for being the relevant extra-mental phenomenon. If we set\nout to study knowledge empirically, as Kornblith instructs us, we will\nhave an excess of candidate extra-mental phenomena. Starting with\nKornblith’s preferred candidate, there is the set of states that\nconsist in a creature believing a true proposition as a result of\nusing a reliable process. Second, there is the set of states that\nconsist in a creature believing something true (period). Third, there\nis the set of states consisting in a creature believing a proposition\njustifiedly (without its being true). Finally, there is a host of\nadditional candidates, each corresponding to a different theory that\nwas floated in response to the Gettier problem. Which of these many\ncandidate extra-mental phenomena should philosophers of knowledge seek\nto investigate empirically? And how should they choose the one that is\nreally knowledge? \nWhat emerges here is that the epistemologist would need some prior\nmethod for choosing the right extra-mental phenomenon. And it seems\ninevitable that the method for making this choice will have to be\nsomething like the traditional one of consulting speakers’ judgments\nabout which states qualify—“intuitively”—as\nstates of knowing. In short, a prior method is needed to pick out\nwhich set of extra-mental events in the world should be the target of\na Kornblithian empirical investigation. Without such a prior method,\nthe epistemologist would be like a blind man sent on a mission without\na guide, or guide dog, to help him. Without a guide, how can one\nselect the relevant extra-mental phenomenon? But Kornblith seems\nintent on denying the epistemologist any such guide. (Goldman\n 2015)[21] \nGiven that it is anchored in precisely the sort of intuitional\nmethodology and conceptual investigation that is characteristic of TE,\nGoldman’s approach does not of course face any immediate threat\nof (apparent) self-defeat. In what respect, though, is the view\nnaturalistic? In one place, Goldman characterizes his\npreferred form of naturalism—he calls it “moderate\nnaturalism”—as the combination of two\n theses.[22]\n The first thesis states his commitment, which we encountered above\n (Section 3.2),\n to a psycho-etiological approach to understanding justification\n(warrant, etc.). The second embodies his own view as to how, or how\nfar, the methodology of TE needs to be altered and its autonomy\nmodulated (see the discussion of methodological NE in\n Section 1.2\n above): \nModerate Naturalism \nWhat sort of help from science might philosophy need? In\nEpistemology and Cognition (1986) Goldman presents a\n“two-stage” model of epistemological inquiry: the first\ninvolves traditional armchair, conceptual analysis to determine the\nkey contours of the relevant concepts (according to Goldman, it\nreveals the centrality of considerations of reliability thereto);\nthereafter it is (or should be) epistemology’s task to determine\n“which cognitive processes are available and reliable”;\nand it is here, at this second stage, that “collaboration with the empirical science of psychology, or cognitive science”\nis needed (2005: 408). \nNote:\n (A)\n here states that justification is a function of the psychological\nprocesses that produce or preserve belief. It represents a commitment\nto a certain form or degree of psychologism\n (Section 1.3).\n It does not state that all such justification is a\nposteriori: Goldman rejects the sort of strongly empiricist brand\nof NE that Kornblith and Quine embrace,\n [23]\n and he takes pains to argue that his own reliabilist way of\nunderwriting\n (A)\n is perfectly compatible with the existence of a priori\njustification (see his 1999a). (Kitcher too has suggested “that\nthe concept of a priori knowledge can be embedded in a naturalistic\nepistemology”; 1980: 4.) And in his Epistemology and\nCognition (1986), for example, Goldman appears to regard the\nconceptual analysis and consulting of intuitions that he sees as\nessential to epistemology as itself a priori (see 1989:\n143). \nIn more recent work (Goldman 1999a, 2005, 2007; Goldman & Pust\n1998), however, Goldman has suggested that the conceptual work\ncharacteristic of epistemological theorizing is a form of a\nposteriori, empirical investigation. For example, conceptual\nanalysis typically involves the eliciting (or “testing”)\nof intuitions—a sample case is presented, and the epistemologist\nasks himself (or others) whether s/he thinks that the subject therein\npossesses knowledge. Rather than seeing this as\nindividuals’ employing some special faculty geared towards\nanswering non-empirical questions, it can be seen as the\nemployment of an essentially experimental, “proto-scientific\nmethod” (2005: 408), geared towards the discovery of facts about\nthe “experimenter’s”, or others’, epistemic\nconcepts. On this view, even the consultation of one’s own\nintuitions is thoroughly empirical: \nClassificational intuitions should not be assimilated to mathematical\nor logical intuitions. They are somewhat more like introspections or\nreadouts of one’s own internal states, in this instance, the\nclassificational implications of one’s own concepts. Although\nthey are not perceptual, they share some features with\nobservations….even intuition-based evidence of the first-person\nkind is not a priori evidence. Moreover, optimal use of one’s\nintuitions to arrive at theories of the contents of concepts, or the\nmeanings of predicates, should take account of semantical and\npsychological theory, both empirical rather than a priori disciplines.\n(Goldman 2005: 409) \nIn thus (re)casting conceptual analysis and the consulting of\nintuitions as an empirical endeavor, Goldman is moving away from\nBealer (1992) and BonJour (1994), for example, who take it as obvious\nthat the conceptual orientation characteristic of traditional\nepistemological practice marks it as a priori. Just as\nimportantly, Goldman is here moving closer to Kornblith. According to\nGoldman, while a reliance on intuitions, especially in connection with\nthe project of analysis, constitutes an obvious difference between\nphilosophical methodology and the methodology of empirical science,\nthat methodology is still empirical. In this respect,\nphilosophical methodology is not distinctive after all. It can appear\nto be such only because philosophical investigation, at least in its\ninitial stage, has as its target the empirical examination of our\nconcepts. It is his insistence upon the latter—that the\ntarget of armchair empirical investigations are concepts, rather than\nany extra-mental epistemic phenomena themselves—that remains the\ncrucial point on which Goldman and Kornblith\n disagree.[24] \nGiven that his moderate naturalism has him (agreeing and) disagreeing\nwith certain elements of both TE and more “radical”\nnaturalisms, it is not surprising that Goldman’s position has come in for\ncriticism from both sides. Thus, for example, Feldman (1999, 2012) and\nBonJour (1994) voice doubts about whether more modest forms of NE are\nboth interesting and correct—whether, that is, plausible\ninstances of the relevance of (e.g.) psychology to epistemology\naren’t already accommodated by TE, and whether any genuinely\nnewsworthy bearing of (e.g.) psychology on epistemology really is\nlikely. (Goldman offers a direct response to BonJour at 1999:\n26–27; and many of Kornblith’s arguments on behalf of\nnaturalism—e.g., his 1995 and 2001—can be read as a\nresponse to such objections.) Once again, however, perhaps more\ninteresting for our purposes is the internecine objection: according\nto Kornblith, the importance Goldman places upon conceptual analysis\nstands in the way of his offering a plausible account of epistemic\nnormativity. \nIn his review of Kornblith’s 2002 book, Goldman writes that\n“[o]n the question of the basis of epistemic norms, he\n[Kornblith] has a very insightful and probing discussion” (2005:\n409)—see the brief discussion thereof in\n Section 4.2\n above. And, of course, Goldman is hardly averse to seeing true belief\nas having the sort of instrumental value that Kornblith’s\naccount of epistemic normativity features. However, as Kornblith\nwrites, “in Epistemology and Cognition, empirical\nconcerns play no role at all in explaining the source of epistemic\nnormativity” (2002: 140–141). On that account, rather, it\nis at the foundational conceptual stage of epistemology that\nnormativity gets a foothold: our epistemic assessments are evaluative\n(Goldman 1986: 20), and give pride of place to reliability\nconsiderations, owing to the contents of the concepts which are\ndeployed therein. In short, Kornblith says, on Goldman’s (1986)\naccount “[n]ormative force seems to derive from semantic\nconsiderations alone” (Kornblith 2002: 142). According to\nKornblith, however, such a semantic grounding for epistemic\nnormativity is unsatisfactory. In effect, it simply pushes the problem\nback: why should we care about the concepts—hence, the epistemic\nstandards—that we actually have (2002: 142–145)? \nAs Kornblith acknowledges, he is not the first to raise such concerns\nabout the normative standings of results obtaining via the conceptual\nanalysis that is characteristic of TE. Stich (1990: 92–93), for\nexample, has raised them previously. As Stich’s discussion makes\nclear, what would make the envisaged problem pressing is if there\nwere, in fact, genuine diversity in our cognitive processes, epistemic\nstandards, and/or our intuitions about cases. After all, so long as\nour actual epistemic concepts and evaluations are broadly\nreliabilist—so long as  \n[e]xamining folk epistemic concepts…reveal[s] how truth (true\nbelief) is a primary basis for epistemic evaluation and epistemic\nachievement (Goldman 2007: 22)  \n—there is at the very least an important consilience\nbetween the results yielded by our conceptual investigation and the\naccount of epistemic normativity that Kornblith favors. \nHence the significance of certain results claimed to have been\nobtained within “experimental philosophy” (x-phi), itself\na recent movement within naturalistic\n philosophy.[25]\n For, according to some theorists, there is in fact widespread\ndiversity in epistemic intuitions—both within individuals\n(Swain, Alexander, and Weinberg 2008) and between groups, even (as\nJennifer Nagel puts it) “along such epistemically scary fault\nlines” (Nagel 2012: 495) as ethnicity (Weinberg, Nichols, and\nStich 2001) and gender (Buckwalter and Stich 2011). According to those\nworking within x-phi’s “negative”\n program,[26]\n (putative) results such as this reveal that there is something deeply\nflawed about the method of using intuitions to inform one’s\nphilosophical theory. This is the lesson that Bishop and Trout take\naway from such reported results as well. As they see it, while\npractitioners of “Standard Analytic Epistemology” (SAE)\ntypically regard NE as unable to accommodate epistemic normativity, it\nis in fact they who are engaged in a purely descriptive\nproject—namely, the project of giving information  \nabout the reflective epistemic judgments of a group of idiosyncratic,\nnon-representative people who have been trained to use highly\nspecialized epistemic concepts and patterns of thought. (Bishop and\nTrout 2005a: 704) \nIf we want a genuinely normative epistemology, Bishop and Trout\nsuggest (2005a,b), we should abandon SAE altogether and look directly\nto the empirical findings of “ameliorative psychology”,\nwhich promises to give us insight into how we can reason\n better.[27]\n The feasibility of this project has been challenged, and on much the\nsame grounds as Goldman (e.g.) objects to Kornblith’s\nview—namely, because of the apparent indispensability to even an\nempirically-minded epistemology of a reliance upon intuitions, for\ninstance concerning what the relevant standard of epistemic goodness\nis (e.g., Stich 2006). And yet, if the studies mentioned\nabove are correct, it’s not clear what kind of authority we\nshould grant such intuitions – or, more generally, the results\nof armchair philosophical methods such as are found within both TE and\nGoldman’s brand of “moderate naturalism”. \nHowever, those studies have been challenged. For instance, Sosa 2005,\nGoldman 2010, and Williamson 2013 raise concerns about the\ninterpretation and significance of the reported data (and, to some\nextent, about the merits of x-phi itself). Just as importantly, others\nworking within an experimental framework have raised questions about\nthose data themselves. Thus, while Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich\n(2001), for example, claimed to find significant cross-cultural\nvariation in people’s epistemic intuitions, several recent studies\n(Nagel et al. 2013, Seyedsayamdost 2015, Kim and Yuan 2015)\nhave failed to replicate those results. (See too Nagel 2012, 2013;\nNagel and Boyd 2014.) In fact, in his most recent work on the subject,\nStich – along with his coauthors (see Machery et al.\n2015) – has argued for the cross-cultural robustness of\ncertain epistemic intuitions, suggesting that these “may be a\nreflection of an underlying innate and universal core folk\nepistemology.” Like NE itself, x-phi raises pressing issues\nabout philosophical methodology and remains the focus of lively\ndebate. The most recent findings just mentioned, however, illustrate\nhow x-phi per se is not at odds with the more traditional\nconcerns and methods that Goldman’s moderate naturalism, for example,\nincorporates: an epistemological theory’s being informed by conceptual\ninvestigation, or by intuitive judgments, does not automatically fate\nit to being parochial and therefore of only limited interest. \nThe discussion of the past few sections has focused on the views and\narguments of select figures within NE. The rationale for this focus\nhas been twofold: first, because the positions and figures in\nquestion have been at the forefront of recent discussions of NE; and\nsecond, because the general epistemological affinity between Kornblith\nand Goldman in particular (i.e., their common adherence to\nreliabilism) has allowed us to isolate and appreciate both the central\nchallenges to NE and some of the major points of difference among its\nadvocates. Once again, however, the selective focus above should not\nobscure the fact that many other naturalistic epistemological theories have\nbeen offered\n (Section 1.2).\n Thus, for example, in addition to reliabilist (Goldman, Kornblith),\npragmatic (Stich), and information-theoretic (Dretske) views,\nteleo-functional thinking has been used in proffered accounts of both\nknowledge (Millikan 1984) and epistemic entitlement (Graham 2012).\nPollock (1986, 1987), and Pollock and Cruz (1999), seek to understand\nepistemic justification in terms of conformity to procedural norms of\nbelief-formation, the correctness of which is ensured by the contents\nof the relevant concepts. And\nothers—“nonfactualists” such as Field (1998), and\n“expressivists” such as Chrisman (2007)—regard the\nuse of epistemic terms, and the explicit endorsement of specific\nepistemic norms and evaluations, as essentially a matter of expressing\none’s attitudes, pro and con. These and other specific views\nrepresent other ongoing attempts to understand various epistemic\nconcepts and/or phenomena in a naturalistic manner. While each faces\ndistinct challenges, qua naturalistic views, the most\npressing issues facing them are those discussed above. \nIn addition to such positions with regard to specific epistemic\nmatters, there are other regions of epistemology in which NE figures\nprominently. This final section briefly describes three further such areas—social epistemology,\nfeminist epistemology, and the debate over (epistemic)\nrationality. \nAs we have seen, NE is motivated by a variety of concerns about the\nmethods and ideals of TE—for instance, a reliance upon the a\npriori, an apsychological, “current time slice”\n(Goldman 2011) approach to understanding knowledge or justification, a\ntendency to overlook or idealize the resources and abilities that\nactual epistemic subjects possess, and so on. Another aspect of TE\nthat has recently come under much scrutiny is its tendency to treat\nsubjects in rather individualistic terms—i.e., as\ndivorced from their social environment. This too is seen as a serious\ndistortion, given that people’s lives, epistemic and otherwise,\nare importantly shaped by social forces. (Indeed, according to some,\neven this way of putting it is misleading, since it paints individuals\nas explanatorily prior to the social in epistemic matters.) Worth\nnoting here is that even paradigm instances of NE might be charged\nwith being unduly focused on the individual—e.g., with looking to\nindividual psychology as being especially relevant to epistemology, at\nthe expense of areas of empirical study with a more social orientation\n(cf. Grandy 1994: 346–348). \nSocial epistemology (SE) is a large and diverse area of\nresearch aimed at countering the individualism of TE by studying\nepistemic phenomena from a properly social perspective. (Sample\noverviews of SE are Schmitt 1994 and Goldman and Blanchard 2015.\nGoldman and Whitcomb 2011 is an up-to-date collection of papers on SE;\nand Lackey 2014 is a volume of new papers on collective epistemology\nspecifically.) Just as with NE, different specific theories and\ntheorists within SE maintain closer or more distant relations to TE.\nSome social epistemologists maintain a view of the individual as the\nprimary locus of epistemic achievement, for example, while others\ntreat entities other than individuals, such as groups or corporations,\nas having epistemic properties. Some theorists evaluate various social\nprocesses and institutions in terms of some more general, non-social\nfeature (e.g., reliability), while others think that the relevant\ngood-making features are not so reducible. Some retain truth as the\nprimary epistemic goal; others propose some non-traditional goal. And\nso on. Across these various approaches, however, many practitioners\nwithin SE are motivated by concerns similar to those that animate NE,\nand many of the forms and themes within NE\n (Section 1.2)\n appear here as well. (In terms of the theoretical choice points\nmentioned just above, Goldman 1999b, for example—as he does with\nrespect to NE per se—tends to occupy the more\n“conservative” positions; the SE of Martin Kusch 2002, for\ninstance, rejects many of the core assumptions of TE; and Helen\nLongino’s 2002 views are, arguably, intermediate between the\ntwo.) \nAs the reference to Longino in the previous (sub)section suggests,\nthere is a continuity between the issues and concerns addressed within\nSE and those addressed within feminist epistemology (FE).\n(For overviews of the latter, see Anderson 2012; Grasswick 2013, esp.\nSection 1; and Janack n.d. in Other Internet Resources). Like SE (and\nNE), of course, FE is a broad category, within which many diverse\nprojects and positions are assayed. As Longino puts it, \nThere is no single feminist epistemology. Instead there are a plethora\nof ideas, approaches, and arguments that have in common only their\nauthors’ commitment to exposing and reversing the derogation of women\nand the gender bias of traditional formulations. (1999: 331)  \nNonetheless, like SE and NE, historically FE has been motivated by\nconcerns about the ideals and assumptions built into TE—albeit,\nof course, from a distinctly feminist perspective. Thus, for example,\ntraditional notions of reason and objectivity have been subjected to\ncritical scrutiny, on the grounds that they embody (usually tacitly)\ncertain characteristically masculine ideals, such as a separation from\nother people, from the object of knowledge, and from one’s own\nbody and the socio-cultural milieu. (Not surprisingly, here,\nonce again, Cartesian assumptions and aspirations come in for special\ncritical attention.) \nAgainst this general background, many theorists adopt a more or less\nnaturalistic approach to the subject matter—focusing on\nparticular features of the actual epistemic situation and drawing from\na diverse range of areas of empirical study (psychology, gender\nstudies, sociological and historical studies, and others). Among such\nNE-minded philosophers, however, different theorists once again stake\nout different positions. Thus, for example, a number of feminist\nepistemologists (e.g., Antony 1993, Campbell 1998, Nelson 1990) draw\nupon Quine’s work. Just as in NE, however, others (e.g., Clough\n2004, Code 1996) argue that a different sort of naturalistic approach\nis to be preferred—sometimes, on grounds familiar from those\ndiscussed earlier; sometimes, because of specifically feminist\nconcerns. So too, just as in both NE and SE, there is disagreement\nabout how much of the original framework of TE—which of its\nconcepts, concerns, and assumptions—should be retained, and how\ncertain of its elements might need to be recast so as to render them acceptable. \nIn addition to being of central interest within TE,\nrationality is central to our self-conception: Aristotle held\nthat we are “rational animals”, a presumption built into\nthe very name of our species (“homo sapiens”);\nand the thought that humans are rational, perhaps distinctively so,\nappears to be part of the popular fabric of thought about ourselves.\nThere is long-standing disagreement among epistemologists as to the\nnature of epistemic rationality\n(“rationality”)—which, on one understanding, is\ndistinguished from other forms of rationality by being concerned with\nthe effective pursuit of the distinctively cognitive-epistemic end of\ntrue belief. There has also recently arisen heated debate—often\ntermed “the Rationality Wars”—among psychologists\nand philosophers of psychology concerning what we should say in the\nface of empirical findings about humans’ apparently\ndisappointing performance on certain “reasoning tasks”.\nAccording to some, those results force us to confront the possibility\nthat humans may in fact be quite irrational. According to others, such\nresults, together with a psychologically realistic view of how human\nreasoning actually proceeds, point up the need to revise standard\nviews of what rationality involves. (Much of the resulting debate\nrecapitulates, in broad terms, the debate within TE as to the nature\nof justified, or rational,\n belief.[28]) \nFor example, well-known experimental findings—e.g., those of\nTversky and Kahneman (1982) concerning probabilistic reasoning, and\nthose of Wason (1968) concerning deductive reasoning—cannot be\ntaken to illustrate failures in rationality unless we assume what\nStein (1996) calls “the Standard Picture” (SP): \nAccording to this picture, to be rational is to reason in accordance\nwith principles of reasoning that are based on rules of logic,\nprobability theory and so forth. If the standard picture of reasoning\n[rationality] is right, principles of reasoning that are based on such\nrules are normative principles of reasoning, namely they are the\nprinciples we ought to reason in accordance with. (Stein 1996: 4) \nAccording to some, rather than suggesting that humans are irrational,\nthe relevant findings (among many other considerations) give us good\noccasion to ask whether it is reasonable to see “the Standard\nPicture” as providing the relevant normative standard.\nDiscussion of the ensuing debate would take us too far afield here\n(but see note 27). For present purposes, it suffices to note that it\nshares many features with the debate within and about NE. Empirical\nresults and considerations of psychological feasibility play a large\nrole within the rationality debate, and many of the facts and factors\nappealed to by friends of NE in their critique of TE (see\n Sections 1.2\n and\n 3.2\n above, e.g.) reappear here either as criticisms of SP, or as\nproffered constraints upon an adequate conception of rationality.\nFinally, as with debates within and about NE generally, discussions of\nrationality involve appeals to both normative and psychological\nconsiderations, with many of the most contested issues having to do\nwith how best to balance their sometimes-competing claims.","contact.mail":"rysiew@uvic.ca","contact.domain":"uvic.ca"}]
