Non-cognitivists agree with error theorists\nthat there are no moral properties or moral facts. But rather than\nthinking that this makes moral statements false, non-cognitivists claim\nthat moral statements are not in the business of predicating properties\nor making statements which could be true or false in any substantial\nsense. Roughly put, non-cognitivists think that moral statements have no\nsubstantial truth conditions. Furthermore, according to non-cognitivists, when\npeople utter moral sentences they are not typically expressing states\nof mind which are beliefs or which are cognitive in the way that\nbeliefs are. Rather they are expressing non-cognitive attitudes more\nsimilar to desires, approval or disapproval.\n\n\n\nCognitivism is the denial of non-cognitivism. Thus it holds that\nmoral statements do express beliefs and that they are apt for truth and\nfalsity. But cognitivism need not be a species of realism since a\ncognitivist can be an error theorist and think all moral statements\nfalse. Still, moral realists are cognitivists insofar as they think\nmoral statements are apt for robust truth and falsity and that many of them\nare in fact true.\n\n\nTwo negative theses comprise the central common non-cognitivist\nclaims, although current theories often endorse them only in qualified\nform.  One thesis might be called semantic\nnonfactualism. Simply put this thesis denies that predicative\nmoral sentences express propositions or have substantial truth\nconditions. Thus semantic nonfactualism suggests that their contents\nare not apt for robust truth or falsity. (The terms\n‘substantial’ and ‘robust’ are inserted here\nto make room for minimalist theories which offer deflationary accounts\nof truth, truth-aptness and propositions. Such theories will be\ndiscussed in more detail in section 4.1 below.) Moral predicates do\nnot denote or express properties and predicative moral sentences do\nnot therefore predicate properties of their subjects. The second\nnegative thesis can be called psychological\nnon-cognitivism. This thesis denies that the states of mind\nconventionally expressed by moral utterances are beliefs or mental\nstates which fall on the cognitive side of the cognitive/non-cognitive\ndivide. Typically non-cognitivists accept both negative theses, though\nthere are views which accept one and not the other. \n\nSome non-cognitivists have accepted these theses in their strongest\nform – moral sentences in no way predicate properties, are apt\nfor truth or falsity, or express beliefs. But most current\nnon-cognitivists accept these negative claims only in a somewhat\nweakened form. For example many non-cognitivists hold that moral\njudgments’ primary function is not to express beliefs, though\nthey may express them in a secondary way. Others deny that\ntheir contents are true or false in any robust sense but not\nthat they can be true or false in a deflationary sense\naccording to which there is no substantial property separating true and\nfalse sentences. \n\nNon-cognitivists deny neither that moral sentences are meaningful\nnor that they are generally used by speakers in meaningful ways. Thus\ndifferent sorts of non-cognitivist couple their negative theses with\nvarious positive claims about the meanings of moral sentences and about\nthe states of mind that they express. It is the diversity of positive\nproposals that generates the different varieties of non-cognitivism.\nEmotivists suggest that moral sentences express or evoke non-cognitive\nattitudes towards various objects without asserting that the speaker\nhas those attitudes. Norm-expressivists suggest (roughly) that the\nstates of mind expressed by moral sentences are attitudes of acceptance\nof various norms or rules governing conduct and emotion, perhaps\ncoupled with a judgment that the objects or action under discussion\ncomports with those norms. Prescriptivists suggest that these sentences\nare a species of prescription or command, and may or may not offer an\naccount of the state of mind such judgments express. \n\nWhile non-cognitivism was first developed as a theory about moral\njudgments (Ogden & Richards 1923, 125. Barnes 1933) many of the\narguments for the position apply equally well to other sorts of\nevaluative language. Thus most non-cognitivists today extend the\ntreatment to normative or evaluative judgments generally, and the\ndiscussion below will often speak of normative or evaluative judgments\nand terms – a category which includes as paradigms moral\njudgments, judgments of rationality, and judgments of value. \n Cognitivism is perhaps best defined as the denial of non-cognitivism.\nCognitivists think that moral sentences are apt for truth or falsity,\nand that the state of mind of accepting a moral judgment is typically\none of belief. They think that typical utterances of indicative\nsentences containing moral predicates express beliefs in the same way\nthat other sentences with ordinary descriptive predicates typically\ndo. (There is some reason to be careful here since cognitivists may not\nneed to employ the sense of ‘express’ that expressivists\nneed to get their theory off the ground. See Schroeder 2008a.)\nDifferent species of cognitivist disagree about the contents of moral\nsentences and beliefs, about their truth conditions, and about their\ntruth. To discuss all the varieties would require a complete taxonomy\nof possible metaethical positions. What they have in common, however,\nis that they all deny that an adequate account of moral judgments can\nbe given consistent with the two negative non-cognitivist theses.  \n\nIt is useful to contrast non-cognitivism with one particular variety of\ncognitivism in order to more clearly present what the non-cognitivist\nis claiming. Various versions of cognitivist subjectivism equate moral\nproperties such as rightness with the property of being approved of by\nsome person or group. To be right is to be approved of by the speaker,\nor the speaker and her friends, or the members of the speaker’s\nsociety, or everybody. On many such views, when a speaker says\nsomething is right she is in fact saying that she approves, or that she\nand those like her approve. In one very good sense she would then have\nexpressed her approval – she said that she approved or that she\nand her friends did. And, if approval is a conative rather than a\ncognitive attitude, we might say that she expressed a non-cognitive\nattitude. But this by itself is not sufficient to make the position\nnon-cognitivist. This variety of subjectivism agrees with one of the\npositive non-cognitivist theses (that moral utterances conventionally\nexpress non-cognitive attitudes), but it does not agree with either of\nthe essential negative non-cognitivist claims (that the judgments\ndon’t express beliefs and/or that they are not truth-apt). According to\nthis subjectivist theory, the moral utterance expresses the speaker’s\nbelief that she approves of the action and this has truth conditions\nwhich are also the truth conditions of the sentence uttered. When a\nnon-cognitivist says that a sentence conventionally expresses an\nattitude, she means to contrast the mode of expression with saying that\none has the attitude. A simple example gets the idea across. One can\nexpress dislike of something by saying that one dislikes it. This is\nthe way that a cognitivist subjectivist thinks we express moral\nattitudes. But one can also express dislike of something by booing or\nhissing. This is much like the way some non-cognitivists think we\nexpress moral attitudes. The latter way of expressing an attitude is\ndifferent from the way cognitivist subjectivists think we express moral\nattitudes because it expresses the attitude without saying that we have\nthe attitude (Barnes 1933; Carnap 1937, 28–29.)  \nThe principal varieties of non-cognitivism can be distinguished by\nfocusing on the positive claims they make in explicating the semantic\nfunction of moral expressions and the nature of the mental states\ntypically expressed by those who utter them in simple predicative\nstatements.  \n\nEmotivists think moral terms in grammatically assertive utterances\nfunction primarily to express emotion and perhaps also to elicit\nsimilar emotions in others (Barnes 1933; Stevenson 1946; Ayer 1952,\nChapter 6). They can be read as suggesting that the right way to\nexplain the meanings of such terms is to point out that they are\nconventional devices for performing a certain sort of speech act, one\nwhich if sincere requires that the speaker have a certain attitude.\nSentences employing general predicates of positive moral evaluation\nsuch as ‘right’, ‘good’,\n‘virtuous’, and so on signal a non-cognitive pro-attitude\nsuch as approval or preference. Sentences employing general predicates\nof negative evaluation such as ‘wrong’, ‘bad’,\nand ‘vicious’ signal negative non-cognitive\nattitudes. Thus to call a person virtuous is to express an attitude of\napproval and the speech act of doing so is analogous to the speech act\nperformed when we cheer for that person. The account can be extended\nbeyond general moral terms. Simple predicative utterances employing\nthe so-called thick moral terms such as ‘brave’ and\n‘honest’ can then be thought of as performing this same\nspeech act while at the same time predicating the natural property\n(say fearlessness in the case of bravery) which common usage of the\nterm seems to track. Thus thick moral terms can be thought of as\nhaving both descriptive and emotive meaning.  \n\nSome theorists who view themselves as emotivists suggest that even the\nmost general terms of moral evaluation have a descriptive meaning\nrather than just an emotive or non-cognitive meaning (Stevenson 1944,\n22; Hare 1952, suggests the same sort of idea within a prescriptivist\ntheory at 118). One such approach analyzes judgments applying a moral\npredicate to a particular object or action as expressing approval or\ndisapproval of some property while at the same time predicating that\nproperty of the object or item in question. This idea has been taken\nover by contemporary hybrid expressivists (Jackson 1999; Barker 2000;\nRidge 2006, Ridge 2014). According to these theorists, a sentence such as\n‘Lying is wrong’ both predicates a property of the act\ntype lying and expresses the speaker’s disapproval of that\nproperty. Theories of this sort will be discussed in more detail in\nthe section on hybrid theories below.  They are mentioned here only to\nnote two points: (1) The hybrid idea was already present in the\nwritings of early noncognitivists. And (2) these more complicated\nviews are often adopted by theorists who begin from simpler theories\nwhich are paradigm cases of non-cognitivism. \n\nPrescriptivists suggest that moral judgments are a species of\nprescriptive judgement and that moral sentences in the indicative mood\nare semantically more akin to imperatives than indicatives. One way to\nthink of the idea is that moral terms function as force indicators on\nanalogy with mood.  Early prescriptivists thought that this had\nradical implications for moral reasoning and argument. Carnap\nsuggested that moral judgments are equivalent to relatively simple\nimperatives. The statement ‘Killing is evil’ means the\nsame thing as ‘Do not kill.’ On that basis he claimed that\nthere could be no moral knowledge or error (Carnap 1937; 23–24\n& 29).  \n\nBy contrast current versions of prescriptivism, most developed in the\nworks of R. M. Hare, have attempted to vindicate moral thinking as a\nrational enterprise. The main idea here is that while moral sentences\ndo in fact express a species of prescription much as ordinary\nimperatives do, they express prescriptions of a special universal\nsort. And it is largely because they are prescriptions of this sort\nthat they are subject to various consistency constraints, so that\naccepting one moral judgment carries with it a requirement that one\naccept other judgments in some respects like it. While Hare denies\nthat moral judgments are exactly equivalent to prescriptions\nexpressible in any other form of words, he does tell us a lot about\nwhat they mean. Moral imperatives are universal in a number of\nways. They are to apply not just to the agent about whom they are made\n(if they are made with respect to a particular agent) but also to any\nagent who is similarly situated. And they apply to any action or\nobject which is relevantly similar to the actions or objects about\nwhich the judgment is made. They apply to all relevantly similar cases\nat any time and any place. Thus, very roughly, when one calls an\naction right one is not only prescribing the action in question, but\nalso any relevantly similar action wherever and whenever it\noccurs. And the prescription is addressed not only to the agent whose\naction is up for assessment but also to every other person, including\nthe speaker and listeners. In this way, Hare believes, calling an\naction wrong commits the speaker to judging wrong any relevantly\nsimilar action done at any time and any place by any person. \n\nWith ordinary prescriptions, it isn’t obvious that there is a state of\nmind that someone must be in if they utter or obey a command and which\nwe ought to characterize as accepting an imperative. Hare, himself at\none point argues that there is no substantive way of characterizing\nthe attitude a person must have if she expresses or accepts a\nprescription or moral judgment (Hare 1952, 9–11). Even so,\nprescriptivists have some reason for wanting to offer an account of\naccepting a moral judgment if they want to explain moral practice.\nOrdinarily we attribute moral judgments to people, even people who are\nsilent. So the prescriptivist will want to say something about our\nbasis for these attributions. An account of the attitude that\nconstitutes accepting a moral judgment will allow them to ground such\nattributions. One suggestion is that the attitude of accepting a moral\njudgment involves an intention to do what the judgments recommend.\nSincerely accepting a command directed at oneself involves doing it if\none is in circumstances where it applies and one is able and otherwise\nintending to do it should one find oneself in those circumstances\n(Hare 1952, 20). Since moral commands are universal according to the\ntheory, they will be directed at everyone. Thus anyone who sincerely\naccepts a moral judgment will be disposed to do what they believe\nright in circumstances where they can. Less sincere judgments may lack\nthis connection (Hare 1952, 169). The issue of which attitude, if any,\nare involved in accepting a prescription is relevant to some of the\narguments over internalism that we will consider below. \n\nSince non-cognitivism is a species of irrealism about ethics, it should\nbe unsurprising that many of its main motivations overlap with those\nfor other versions of ethical irrealism, especially with those for\nerror theories. Early non-cognitivists seem most concerned to defend\nmetaphysical and epistemic commitments incompatible with a realist\ninterpretation of moral claims. For example, moral judgments seem to\nbe empirically under-determined (Ayer 1952, 106; Mackie 1977, 39).\nHence they fail tests for meaningful discourse proposed by logical\npositivists. If moral language is meaningful, it would be a\ncounter-example to the view. Thus early versions of non-cognitivism\nwere proposed by these theorists, not so much because they were\ninterested in moral philosophy but rather to render innocuous a seeming\ncounter-example to their own theories (Carnap 1937, 24–27; Ayer 1952,\n107–109).  \n\nMore contemporary non-cognitivists have also been motivated by\nsimilar underlying metaphysical and epistemic commitments. But they\nhave been as concerned with vindicating the legitimacy of moral\npractice and argument as with anything else. As a result, they have put\nmore time and energy into explaining, and in a certain sense\njustifying, the realist-seeming features of moral discourse in the\nabsence of a commitment to realism (Hare 1952; Blackburn 1984, 1998;\nGibbard 1990). \n\n‘Quasi-Realism’ is Simon Blackburn’s name for this sort of\nnon-cognitivism, and especially his own version of expressivism. Yet\nother sophisticated non-cognitivists, notably Allan Gibbard, have\nbeen happy to work under the quasi-realist banner (Gibbard 2003,\n18–19).  What especially distinguishes the quasi-realist project is an\nemphasis on explaining why we are entitled to act as if moral\njudgments are genuinely truth-apt even while strictly speaking they\nare neither true nor false in any robust sense. Thus it is a commitment of a\nquasi-realist that normative judgments are in an important way\ndifferent from most (other) paradigm descriptive judgments – enough \nso to render problematic their status as either true or \nfalse – and yet that a justification is nonetheless available for our\npractices of treating them as if they were in fact so. What\nexactly this comes to is hard to say without discussing some of the\nspecial problems for non-cognitivism in general, since it is precisely\nin offering solutions to those problems that the quasi-realist carries\nout his program. Thus we will revisit the position later on in the\ncontext of these problems. Expressivists of all sorts think that moral sentences are\nconventional devices for expressing pro and con attitudes towards\ntheir objects. In this broad sense emotivists are expressivists; they\nagree that moral language functions to express non-cognitive attitudes\nof various sorts.  The claim that moral terms function much like ‘boo’\nand ‘hurrah’ qualifies as expressivist in a broad sense.  In recent\nyears, however, the term ‘expressivist’ has come to be used in a\nnarrower way, to refer to views which attempt to construct a\nsystematic semantics for moral sentences by pairing them with the\nstates of mind that the sentences are said to express.  Such\nexpressivists hold that the meanings of all sentences containing moral\nterms are determined by the mental states that they serve to\nexpress. For this to work, the sense in which moral sentences express the\nattitudes which determine their semantic values must be fairly strict\nand particular.  For in one sense perfectly ordinary indicative\nsentences can express non-cognitive attitudes as when, ‘It is\nten o’clock already,’ can express impatience.  And, ‘Lying\nsucks!’ and ‘I disapprove of lying,’ can each express\ndisapproval of lying.  Even so, we should not want to assimilate the\nsemantics of these sentences to one another.  Thus expressivists of\nthe narrower sort must identify a kind of expression which allows them\nto distinguish the way in which “Lying is wrong,”\nexpresses the attitude that generates its semantic value, from the way\nin which “I disapprove of lying,” or even “I think\nthat lying is wrong” might express the very same\nattitude (Schroeder 2008a, 2008c). Those who have taken up this expressivist program have provided a\nnumber of candidates for the attitudes expressed by sentences\ncontaining normative terminology.  Simon Blackburn, whose\nquasi-realist project was briefly described above, has contributed\nvarious ideas not only for the states expressed by indicative\nsentences but also for complex embeddings of moral claims.  Hybrid\ntheories that put the expressive function of normative language into\nthe semantics (discussed below) also involve work of this sort. But\nthe proponent who has developed the program in the most systematic way\nis Allan Gibbard. In two influential books Gibbard has proposed two\nstructurally similar accounts each of which employs a different base\nnoncognitive attitude.  In Gibbard (1990) the attitude was\nnorm-acceptance, whereas in Gibbard (2003) it was a planning attitude\nakin to intending.  In each case he develops a strategy for combining\nthe relevant noncognitive attitude with belief to generate complex attitudes \nthat can serve as the\nsemantic values of more complex sentences.  Mark Schroeder’s (2008c)\nbifurcated attitude semantics is a self-conscious attempt to develop\nthese strategies yet further and to assess prospects for the general\nstrategy. \n\nGibbard’s Wise Choices, Apt Feelings (1990) proposes an\nanalysis of judgments regarding rationality according to which they\nexpress a non-cognitive attitude of acceptance towards rules or\nnorms. From there he proceeds to reduce other normative judgments into\nvarious more particular kinds of judgments of rationality, so that all\nmoral judgments are covered by the proposed analysis. Gibbard suggests\nthat normative judgments express the acceptance of systems of \nnorms – rules dividing actions under naturalistic descriptions into\nthose which are forbidden, permitted and required. To call an action\nrational is, to a first approximation, to express one’s acceptance of\na system of norms which allows it. To call an action irrational is to\nexpress one’s acceptance of a system of norms which forbids it. And so\non (Gibbard 1990, 46). This is only Gibbard’s idea to a first\napproximation, since a speaker may not have a determinate system of\nnorms in mind when he or she makes such a judgment. So Gibbard\nsuggests we would do better to think of judgments to the effect that\nan action would be irrational as expressing rejection of any set of\nnorms which does not forbid it. More precisely, a normative judgment\npredicating a normative term of a particular action rules out\ncombinations of descriptive judgments concerning the action with norms\nthat either permit, forbid, or require (as appropriate) actions\nfalling under those descriptions. More complex judgments are captured\nusing the sets of norm-world pairs which those judgments “rule\nout” to represent the states of mind inconsistent with the\njudgments in question. The basic idea can be illustrated with an\nexample. A judgment that action A is permissible is\nincompatible with a pair the first member of which\nrepresents A as a lie, and the second member of which is a\nnorm that rules out lying.  And it is inconsistent with many more such\ncombinations besides.  Given this, we can capture the content of the\njudgment that action A is permissible by specifying the set\nof world-norm pairs with which it is incompatible. (A more detailed\nexposition of Gibbard’s technical apparatus can be found within the\ndiscussion of the Embedding Problem below and in the supplementary document\n  Embedding Problem Response Strategies.)\n \n\nGibbard develops his analysis to cover moral judgments by analyzing\nsuch judgments in terms of judgments of rationality. An action is\nwrong if and only if it fails to meet standards of action the\nintentional or negligent violation of which in a normal state of mind\nwould be sufficient for finding the agent prima facie blameworthy. And\nan action is blameworthy if it would be rational for the agent to feel\nguilty and for others to resent the agent for doing the action (Gibbard\n1990, 45). Since the rationality of guilt or resentment receives a\nnon-cognitive analysis, the approach generates a non-cognitive analysis\nof moral judgments themselves. \n Gibbard’s more recent work (Gibbard 2003) retains many of the main\nfeatures of his norm-expressivist theory but it revises to some extent\nthe account of the non-cognitive attitudes involved in accepting a\nnormative judgment.  On the current view, such judgments express the\nacceptance of plans, or perhaps better they express a state of mind\nthat we might think of as planning to act in this way or that\ndepending on the naturalistic circumstances one finds oneself in. More\ncomplex judgments embedding normative terms express combinations of\nsuch attitudes with further attitudes, including ordinary\nbeliefs. Whereas in the earlier work Gibbard used sets of world-norm\npairs to formally capture the contents of judgments, in the later work\nhe relies on what he calls “fact-prac worlds”.  Formally\nthey function in much the same way as the world-norm pairs did in the\nearlier theory.  But with the fact-prac worlds apparatus contingency\nplans take the place of norms as members of the pairs. Once again,\njudgements will rule out other judgements represented by a set of\npairs.  The judgment that action A is permissible will be\ninconsistent with various combinations of factual beliefs with plans.\nEach of these combinations can be captured by a world representing a\nway the world might be together with a second component consisting of\na plan, representing a commitment to act that the thinker might\nhave. For example the judgment that action A is permissible\nwill be incompatible with any pair the fact-representing member of\nwhich represents action A as a lie, paired with a plan that\nrules out lying.  And just as a similar idea allowed Gibbard to use\nsets of norm-world pairs to capture the content of normative\njudgments, he now can capture the content of a normative judgment by\nspecifying the set of fact-prac worlds with which it is incompatible.\nWhen the apparatus is fully developed, the fact representing members\nof the pairs can once again be thought of as possible worlds insofar\nas they specify every detail of the world, and the plans are\nhyper-plans insofar as they have an answer for what to do in every\ncircumstance.  Gibbard often calls these fully determinate fact-prac\nworlds “fact-plan worlds”, just as you might expect given\nwhat they are composed of. The resulting theory might now be called\n‘plan-expressivism’ rather than\n‘norm-expressivism’ though most of its important\nstructural features are very similar to those of his earlier norm\nexpressivist view.  \nFurther developments come in the form of Gibbard’s arguments for the\nresulting theory: Gibbard suggests that people need to plan and need\nways to think about and represent their plans. He argues that they\nwould also need to think about what to do from the perspectives of\nvarious other people and to formulate plans for arbitrary situations\nthey might find themselves in. If these claims are right, a language\nmight naturally develop in order to make such thinking easier. A\nplanning language modeled by the sets of world-plan pairs would serve\nvery well.  And in actual use it would operate much as our actual\nnormative language does. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that\nour actual normative language is of this sort.  Furthermore conceiving\nof these attitudes as involving contingency plans for descriptively\nspecifiable circumstances would allow us to explain the supervenience\nof the moral on the descriptive.  The thoughts represented by the\nfact-prac world apparatus represent such contingency plans. So the\nsupervenience of the normative on the descriptive falls naturally out\nof the resulting story (Gibbard 2003). \n\nOften philosophical positions are introduced in rather pure and stark\nversions, only to be modified in light of arguments and objections so\nas to become more like competing theories over time. It should not be\ntoo surprising that this is the case in metaethics and that present\nday non-cognitivist theories are less distinguishable from cognitivist\nalternatives than earlier versions. It can even be a controversial\nmatter whether theories developed within the non-cognitivist tradition\nbut modified to handle objections still deserve the label. The\nvarieties of emotivism which postulate both descriptive meaning and\nemotive meaning have sometimes aroused such suspicions and the more\ndeveloped hybrids discussed at the end of this section are in that\ntradition. Furthermore, while paradigm non-cognitivists accept each of\nthe two negative theses outlined above, there are views which accept\nonly one of the two without the other. These positions constitute two\nmetaethical theories which we might think of as borderline cases lying\njust outside the non-cognitivist region of logical space.  \n\nHermeneutic moral fictionalists are not semantic\nnon-factualists. Moral sentences are regarded as genuinely\ntruth-apt. Such sentences do have truth conditions and an assertive\nsentence using a moral predicate does predicate a property. Yet, in\nnormal use these sentences are not strictly speaking true. Thus far\nthe hermeneutic fictionalist agrees with error theorists. But while\nerror theorists think that the falsity of moral sentences implies that\nordinary moral talk is massively in error, fictionalists\ndisagree. According to the hermeneutic fictionalist a speaker uttering\na false moral sentence is typically not expressing a belief in the\ncontent expressed by the sentence. Rather such speakers are using it\nfictively, and this use involves no error. Thus, fictionalists are\npsychological non-cognitivists. Use of a moral sentence does not\ncommunicate that the speaker believes the proposition expressed by\nthat sentence.  Rather speakers use such sentences to express other,\nnon-cognitive states of mind. Just as with standard versions of\nnon-cognitivism, fictionalists will generally offer a story about the\nnature of the non-cognitive attitude expressed. For example, they may\nsuggest that the state of mind is an intention to act as if the moral\njudgment expressing the intention is true (Kalderon 2005b). At the\nsame time, because they are not pursuing the expressivist semantic\nprogram the expression relation need not be exactly what ordinary\nexpressivists take it to be.  Since they need not require a one–to–one\nmapping of moral sentences onto states of mind that express them to\nsupport their semantic theory, fictionalists can allow for more\nvariation in the states of mind such sentences (loosely)\nexpress. Hermeneutic fictionalism is often contrasted with\nrevolutionary fictionalism. Revolutionary moral fictionalists think we\nshould reform our current cognitively committed use of normative\nlanguage to work roughly as the hermeneutic fictionalist thinks we\nalready do (Joyce 2001, 2005). They are thus not committed to\nnon-cognitivism about actual current use of moral terms in the way that\nhermeneutic fictionalists seem to be. Revolutionary fictionalists\ncould be read as proposing that we convert to using moral language to\nexpress something other than belief with our indicative moral\nsentences, but revolutionary fictionalists have not usually presented\ntheir reforms in that way. That should not be too\nsurprising. Fictionalist rejection of semantic nonfactualism leads\nmost taxonomists to omit fictionalism from the non-cognitivist\ngenus. Still at least one prominent hermeneutic fictionalist has\npresented his view as a version of non-cognitivism (Kalderon 2005b)\ndrawing on some comments in MacIntyre (1981, 15–18). \n\nFor more detail on fictionalism see the entry on\n fictionalism. \n\nIn contrast, Terry Horgan and Mark Timmons have propounded a view\nwhich they call Nondescriptivist Cognitivism. As the label suggests,\nthey do not regard their view as a species of non-cognitivism, but\nlike fictionalism the view does accept one of non-cognitivism’s two\nconstitutive negative theses while rejecting the other. However, with\nrespect to each thesis Horgan and Timmons’s choices contrast with\nthose made by fictionalism. Nondescriptivist cognitivism spurns\npsychological non-cognitivism, but embraces semantic nonfactualism, at\nleast insofar as it rejects the claim that moral sentences describe\nthe world or predicate genuine properties (Horgan & Timmons 2000;\nTimmons 1999). The precise content of the view can be difficult to pin\ndown.  Horgan and Timmons challenge a standard Humean division of the\nmind into a domain of cognitive states which represent the world as\nbeing some way and a separate domain of noncognitive states that do\nnot represent the world.  Rather they think there is an important\ndivision within the cognitive domain between beliefs that\nrepresent the world and beliefs that do not do this but which have\nnon-descriptive but cognitive content. Nondescriptive Cognitivism then\nholds that moral judgments express such nondescriptive but cognitive\nstates. Indicative sentences apt for expressing these mental states\n(in one sense of ‘express’) also semantically\nexpress the contents of these nondescriptive states just as on a\nmore standard picture indicative sentences semantically express the\npropositions that are the contents of sentences that (in a different\nsense of ‘express’) express beliefs. Whether this is in fact a\ndistinctive cognitivist position will depend on the best way of\ndividing up different sorts of mental states.  Some will think that\nHorgan and Timmons have stipulated a new use for old terms, but they\nrespond by defending phenomenological criteria for dividing cognitive\nfrom non-cognitive mental states that justify counting\nnonrepresentational states among the cognitive.\n \nHowever that debate comes out, it is nevertheless worth noting the\nview as one which makes trouble for the standard division between\ncognitivist and non-cognitivist views.  Together with fictionalism it\nillustrates a position which accepts only one of the two negative\ntheses constitutive of standard non-cognitivism. If such views are\ncoherent this would suggest the two negative theses are logically\nindependent.  Hybrid-expressivist theories can be thought of as another sort of\nborderline case but for a different reason. These theorists combine\nthe positive claims of expressivism – that moral sentences are\nconventional devices for the expression of pro-attitudes and that\nmoral attitudes are (partly) non-cognitive with features of\ncognitivism – that moral sentences predicate properties and that moral\nattitudes are (partly) cognitive.  There are a variety of ways of\ncombining these ideas and various extant theories adopt many of the\noptions. We’ve already noted a tendency for emotivists and prescriptivists\nto allow a kind of secondary descriptive meaning for moral terms over\nand above their expressive meaning in order to capture the way that\nmoral statements can be used to convey descriptive information.  If I\nknow that you are a utilitarian you might convey the information that\nan action maximizes utility by telling me that it is right. In such\ncases, what the speaker successfully conveys depends on the audience’s\nknowledge of the speaker’s moral views. One sort of hybrid theorist\nincorporates this idea into the semantics of moral expressions. Such\ntheorists suggest that moral utterances as a matter of their semantics\npredicate a property, one which is determined by the speaker’s moral\nattitudes, while at the same time expressing a non-cognitive attitude\ntowards that property. Proponents hope that the view will have\nadvantage in explaining the communication of factual information with\nmoral terms and with handling the embedding problem (explained below),\nwhile also explaining the motivational efficacy of moral\njudgements. One implementation of this view equates the main semantic\ncontent of a moral predicate with the property it picks out (via a\nfunction from the speaker’s attitudes to the relevant properties),\nwhile use of the predicate conventionally implicates the presence of a\npro or con attitude (Barker 2000). A different implementation of the\nstrategy incorporates both components into the semantic values of\nmoral terms, even while the descriptive content is a function of the\nnon-cognitive attitude expressed.  More specifically on this way of\ndeveloping the idea, moral sentences to the effect that something is\nright semantically both express a proposition – that the action has a\nparticular property – and a particular positive attitude toward that\nparticular property. The particular property picked out itself depends\non the non-cognitive attitudes of the speaker, insofar as the property\npredicated is the most general property towards which the speaker\nholds the non-cognitive attitudes expressed by the very same\njudgement(Ridge, 2006a, 2006b, 2014).  One upshot is that the descriptive\ncontent of a speaker’s judgements can vary over time as the object of\nher attitudes change. John Eriksson(2009) suggests that R. M. Hare was\nan early adopter of this kind of hybrid theory.\n A contrasting sort of hybrid theory holds the descriptive content\nof moral predicates constant.  Such views are often modeled on slurs\nor epithets, as explicated in a certain way. It is plausible and\nperhaps even standard to think of slurs as semantically expressing a\ncertain descriptive property (being a member of such and such a group,\nsay) while also conventionally expressing a negative attitude towards\nthose with the property. Copp (2001, 2009) and Boisvert (2008) suggest\nthat moral terms could function in the same way.  Here again there are\nvarious ways to work out the details.  Advocates of the approach can\nnote that it has advantages over the previous kind of hybrid theory in\nexplaining communication insofar as the descriptive content remains\nfixed from speaker to speaker (Schroeder 2009). And they claim that\nthe view does so without undermining the standard hybrid explanation of the\nmotivational efficacy of moral judgements. Other theorists suggest\nthat pejoratives like ‘idiot’ present a better model than slurs (Hay\nforthcoming). As the literature develops hybrid views get more complicated and\nsubtle. Close relatives of these theories claim to elude objections\ndirected at each of the above variants and yet the resulting theories\nare probably best understood as developments of these simpler variants\n(Schroeder 2013;Toppinen 2013).\n Perhaps hardest to characterize as a species of non-cognitivism are the claims of several recent theorists who suggest that non-cognitivism is best understood as a metasemantic theory. The claim seems to be that non-cognitivism is a theory not about the meaning of moral sentences or about the contents of moral thoughts, but rather a story at a different level about how sentences and thoughts come to have these meanings or contents (Charlow 2015; Chrisman 2012; Pérez Carballo 2014; Ridge 2014; Silk 2015). One motivation for the view seems to be that it allows noncognitivists to take advantage of ordinary semantic theories and hence avoid the embedding problem. There isn’t yet a lot of literature disputing the idea, but Alwood (2016) expresses some skepticism about the advantages of the approach. It is at least worth thinking about which of the standard motivations for non-cognitivism in ethics support the view when it is construed as a metasemantic theory. Chances are the literature will take up such questions in the near future and subsequent versions of this entry will say more about the developments to come.  \n \n\nNon-cognitivism is motivated by a number of considerations, most rooted\nin metaphysics, the philosophy of mind or epistemology.  \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th Century, G. E. Moore’s open question\nargument convinced many philosophers that moral statements were not\nequivalent to statements made using non-moral or descriptive terms. For\nany non-moral description of an action or object it seemed that\ncompetent speakers could without confusion doubt that the action or\nobject was appropriately characterized using a moral term such as\n‘good’ or ‘right’. The question of whether the\naction or object so described was good or right was always open, even\nto competent speakers. Furthermore, in the absence of any systematic\ntheory to explain the possibility of synthetic as opposed to analytic\nidentity claims, many were convinced that this showed that moral\nproperties could not be identified with any natural (or supernatural)\nproperties. Thus Moore and others concluded that moral properties such\nas goodness were irreducible sui generis properties, not identical to\nnatural properties (Moore 1903, 15).  \n\nThe non-naturalists, however, had neglected another option consistent\nwith the thought underlying the open question argument. Perhaps moral\npredicates did not refer to properties at all, and perhaps their\nmeaning was not analyzable in non-moral descriptive terms not because\nthey referred to irreducibly moral properties but because, despite\nappearances, they were not referring expressions at all. In other\nwords, semantic nonfactualism about moral terms entails that questions\nof the sort highlighted by Moore could not be closed by any amount of\ncompetence with the expressions used to ask them because the\nexpressions in question are not in fact equivalent. Thus\nnon-cognitivists could argue that moral expressions used in such open\nquestions did not function to represent anything or to predicate any\nproperty and as such were not equivalent to any descriptive or\nreferring expressions. Rather they merely served to convey emotion\n(Ogden and Richards 1923, 125). Speakers to whom such questions seemed\nopen were tacitly aware of this difference in function and hence not\nin a position to equate moral expressions with descriptive\nexpressions. \n\nContemporary philosophers recognize the possibility that sentences\nthat express identities might be synthetic as opposed to analytic or\ntrue by definition. We can discover that water is the same stuff as\nH2O without being able to infer it from the meanings of the\nterms involved (Kripke 1972; Putnam 1975a). And descriptive naturalists\nabout morality have pointed out that the openness of Moore’s question\nto competent speakers does not rule out the possibility of securing the\nidentity of a moral property with a naturalistic property through\nempirical discoveries that do not rely on the expressions in question\nhaving the same meaning (Boyd 1988). Yet many contemporary defenders of\nnon-cognitivism suggest that the open question argument still provides\nammunition for their claims. Even if we cannot infer from the openness\nof a question that the referents of two terms used to ask that question\nare distinct, we might still have reason to think that the two\nexpressions do not mean the same thing. Thus non-cognitivists have used\nthe open question argument to suggest that moral terms contain a\nnormative element completely lacking in descriptive terms and which\nshould be cashed out along the lines that the non-cognitivists\nfavor. \n\nThe open question argument can be seen as providing independent\nsupport for what is sometimes called Hume’s Law – the claim that\none can never validly deduce an ‘ought’ from an\n‘is’ (Hume 1888, 469). According to Hume’s Law, no set of\npremises consisting entirely of non-moral descriptive statements is\nsufficient to entail a moral or normative conclusion. The\nnon-cognitivist is in a position to explain this, insofar as her\npositive proposal for the functioning of moral terms will suggest they\ndo more than merely describe the world. She will say that moral terms\nessentially express a positive attitude, or function to commend. Purely\ndescriptive terms do not. Nothing can be the conclusion of a valid\nargument which is not already implicit in the premises. Thus\ndescriptive claims cannot entail the extra expressive or imperatival\ncomponent that according to the non-cognitivist is part of the meaning\nof moral terms (Hare 1952, 32–49). \n\nThere are of course many ways to resist these arguments. Perhaps moral\nexpressions are analytically equivalent to naturalistic expressions,\nbut these analyticities are themselves not obvious even to competent\nspeakers (Lewis 1989, 129). This may be because no analyticities are\nobvious, or it may be because moral analyses in particular are\nespecially complex. One moral that could be drawn from the history of\nTwentieth Century analytic philosophy is that if there are any\nanalyticities, competent speakers can question them. This is the\nparadox of analysis. If any definition can be questioned by a\ncompetent speaker, and we think there are at least some definitions\nsufficient to underwrite analytic truths, then the mere fact that a\nspeaker can doubt a candidate analysis may not tell against that\nanalysis. An equivalence could be analytic because competent speakers\ntacitly respect it, for the most part acting as if the equivalence is\ntrue (Lewis 1989, 130). It has been suggested that moral concepts are\nrole concepts analogous to the concepts of various mental states as\nconceived by functionalists. The idea is that commonsense morality\nembodies a theory of morality which specifies the ways in which\nvarious moral properties (rightness, wrongness, goodness, badness,\nfairness, etc.) are related to each other and to other\nproperties. When we put all of the claims of the commonsense theory\ntogether it specifies a role that each property must play in terms of\nthe other properties it relates to.  The role concept so-specified for\neach term might then be the concept of the referent of that term\n(Jackson and Pettit 1995). If so we should expect such concepts to be\nquite complex. And their complexity might make it hard to recognize\nthe adequacy of any analysis, even for speakers who tacitly respect\nthe equivalence so defined. \n\nRelatedly, some theorists have wanted to resist Hume’s Law, arguing\nthat one can in fact validly draw normative or moral conclusions from\npurely descriptive premises (Foot 1958–9; Searle 1964). It is actually\nquite difficult to find an adequate formulation that is immune to\ncounter-example, although many theorists suspect there is nonetheless\nsomething right about Hume’s claim (Humberstone 1996). \n\nThere may be a problem for those more sophisticated forms of\nnon-cognitivism according to which moral terms have both descriptive\nand prescriptive or expressive meaning when these are coupled with\nreliance on the Open Question Argument. Suppose that the postulated\nextra expressive or prescriptive component in moral terms explains why\ncompetent speakers would not equate moral terms with descriptive\nanalyses of them and that it also explains why we cannot validly infer\na moral conclusion from non-moral premises. If moral terms have\ndescriptive meaning in addition to their non-cognitive element one\nshould be able to validly argue in the other direction. The problem is\nthat competent speakers are just as likely to wonder about the validity\nof such inferences as they are to wonder about those going from\ndescriptive premises to normative conclusions. If the openness of such\nquestions to competent speakers is sufficient to refute claims of\nmeaning equivalence, it should here refute theories which include\ndescriptive meanings in an otherwise non-cognitive analysis. If the\narguments that lead non-cognitivists to postulate descriptive meaning\nare sufficiently compelling it seems they should not rely on the open\nquestion argument to support their views. Woods (2015) presses a related worry against even non-hybrid non-cognitivist theories. If the conventional function of moral terms is to express attitudes, it should seem Moore-paradoxical (that is pragmatically incoherent) to deny that one approves of the things one believes good or right. But many such claims don’t seem pragmatically incoherent.  \n\nNaturalism in metaphysics has been on the ascendancy for some time,\nthough it is often somewhat difficult to ascertain exactly what the\nposition amounts to. Metaphysical naturalists claim that there are\nonly natural properties, in some good sense of the term\n‘natural’. Usually naturalism is taken to rule out at\nleast the existence of supernatural entities or properties. And one\nstandard way that naturalists have defended their position has been to\nreduce seemingly mysterious properties or objects which might appear\nto be non-natural to more familiar purportedly natural\nproperties. That is, they have tried to show that these objects or\nentities are nothing over and above some set of natural properties or\nobjects appropriately arranged. One strategy is to identify seemingly\nsuspect properties with natural properties, either via connecting\ndefinitions or through synthetic identities. In this way the seemingly\nsuspect properties can be allowed into the naturalist’s ontology\nwithout undermining the commitment to naturalism. Many naturalists\nhave taken this approach to moral properties (Firth 1952; Railton\n1986; Boyd 1988). \n\nNon-cognitivism is not a form of reductive\nnaturalism about the contents of moral judgments, beliefs and\nsentences. It does not equate the property seemingly predicated in\nsuch judgments with any natural property, precisely because it denies\nthat the (primary) function of such expressions is to predicate\nproperties.  But in another good sense non-cognitivists are\nnaturalists. They offer a reduction of the attitude of accepting a\nmoral judgment to a perfectly naturalistic sort of attitude such as\nthe attitude of approval or disapproval. And they do not postulate any\nproperties which cannot be reduced to natural properties. Thus another\nmotivation for accepting non-cognitivism has been naturalism. If\nsomeone doubts the prospects for reducing moral properties to natural\nproperties (perhaps under the influence of the open question\nargument), they need not concede that there are any extra-natural or\nsupernatural properties.  One can simply reinterpret even the moral\njudgments one accepts as predicating no properties at all. Or, as\nwith the more sophisticated versions of non-cognitivism, one can allow\nthem to predicate natural properties and argue that the appearance\nthat they do something other than this is due to the additional\nexpressive component in their meaning. One’s naturalism will then not\ncommit one to giving up moral judgments or reducing moral properties\nto natural properties (Ayer 1952, 106–7). \n\nMany non-cognitivists have argued for their theories based on\nmotivational internalist premises. Motivational internalists believe\nthat there is some sort of conceptual or necessary connection between\nmoral judgments on the one hand and motivations to act on the other.\n The nature of the connection is a matter of some dispute and theorists have\nsuggested and refuted a variety of candidates (Hare 1952, 20; Brink 1989, 37ff.; Smith 1994, 60ff; Darwall 1997). Non-cognitivists have often supported their theory by arguing\nfrom versions of judgment internalism, which postulate a necessary\nconnection between accepting a moral judgment on the one hand and\nbeing motivated to act on it on the other (Stevenson 1937; Hare 1952; Blackburn 1998; Gibbard 1990). This sort of internalism is\ncontroversial, so that leading non-cognitivists have had both to\ndefend judgment internalism and to argue that their favored theory\nshould be accepted as the best explanation of the sort of internalism\nthey attempt to vindicate. \n\nYou can find defenses of various versions of judgment internalism\nwhich support somewhat different but still necessary connections\nbetween accepting or uttering a moral judgment on the one hand and\nbeing motivated on the other. One version makes the connection very\ntight – if one accepts a judgment one is motivated to do what it\nsays we ought to do. Others are looser, requiring motivation only in\nrational persons (Korsgaard 1986; Smith 1994, 61) or perhaps in normal\nmembers of a community (Dreier 1990; Horgan & Timmons 1992; 164–5).\nDepending on which version a theorist defends, different versions of\nnon-cognitivism can explain the necessity of the connection, although\nnot all versions can be easily explained using non-cognitivist\nresources. The tightest connection which requires motivation in anyone\nwho accepts the judgment that some action is right is rather well\nexplained by a very simple version of emotivism on which a judgment\nthat some action is right conventionally expresses one’s approval of\nthat action. One can only sincerely use that expression when one has\nthe attitude just as one can only sincerely cheer for some team or\nperson if one has a positive attitude towards them. Sincere utterance\nrequires motivation, that’s part and parcel of this sort of emotivist\ntheory. \n\nOn the other hand, this easy explanation of the strong internalist\nthesis has liabilities. Such strong internalism may be too strong to be\ncredible insofar as it rules out amoralists – those who accept moral\njudgments without being at all motivated to do what they recommend.\nSuch people may be possible and even actual (Brink 1989, 46; Svavarsdóttir 1999). If so,\nsimple emotivism of the sort described is refuted because the sincerity\nconditions for making the judgment require the motivation not present\nin the amoralist. Examples such as the amoralist have led internalists\nto posit more moderate, defeasible, but still necessary connections\nbetween moral judgments and motivation (Korsgaard 1986; Dreier 1990;\nSmith 1994). More complex versions of non-cognitivism can make the\nconnection with actual motivation looser and thereby withstand the\namoralist challenge. But not every more moderate internalist principle\nwill be easily explained by a corresponding non-cognitivist theory.\nSome versions of moderate internalism require that rational people will\nbe motivated in accordance with their own moral judgments (Smith 1994,\n61). It isn’t clear what version of non-cognitivism can take\nadvantage of this sort of defeasible connection. On any theory where\nthe acceptance of a moral judgment is constituted by the acceptance of\na non-cognitive attitude, it should be the case that those who\ngenuinely hold the judgment have the attitude. This should apply to\nthe irrational as well as the rational. \n\nOther responses to the amoralist are available consistent with\nnon-cognitivism. One such response is not to accept a defeasible\nversion of internalism, but rather to claim that amoralists do not have\ngenuine moral beliefs. What an amoralist expresses when she makes a\nmoral claim that she is disinclined to honor involves using the moral\npredicate in an “inverted commas sense” – a sense\nwhich alludes to the value judgments of others without itself\nexpressing such a judgment (Hare 1952, 145–6). Many cognitivists have\nnot found this a persuasive characterization of all amoralists (Brink\n1989, 46–7). Alternatively, non-cognitivists can point out that a\nsentence can conventionally express an attitude even when uttered by\npeople who don’t have the requisite attitude. For example, one can\napologize without feeling sorry or actually caring about what is at\nissue (Joyce 2002). But it is not so easy to see how to carry this over\nto the treatment of accepting a moral judgment in the absence of\nuttering a moral sentence. We would like there to be grounds to\nattribute the belief or acceptance of a moral judgment to those who\nare silent on some grounds, and it isn’t clear exactly what resources\nare available to a non-cognitivist if it doesn’t involve being in some\nattitudinal state. Even if one can sincerely apologize without having\nany special feeling or attitude as one does so, it seems we would not\nsay of a person that they were sorry unless they had such an attitude.\nThus the analogy with apology only takes us so far. \n\nHare’s most famous argument for the action-guiding character of\nmoral judgments is the Missionaries and the Cannibals Argument. He\nsuggests an example in which our translation practices seem to indicate\nthat when we use moral words from our home language to translate words\nand concepts from another language, what is most important to us is\nthat native users of the language or concepts generally use them to\nguide choice and action (Hare 1952, 148–9). If this is right, it\nestablishes a connection of the following form: Necessarily the\nacceptance of a moral judgment will normally incline society members\nto do what is recommended by that judgment. This version will require\nan intention to act or something similar in most people much of the\ntime, but it will not require such an intention from everybody all of\nthe time. The argument thus supports a version of moderate internalism.\nAnd, according to Hare, people who utter general commands that are\ndirected at themselves will normally but not invariably act in\naccordance with those commands (Hare 1952, 169). So this much of\nprescriptivism fits with the sort of internalism that Hare’s arguments\nsupport. But, insofar as Hare also suggests that accepting a command\ndirected at oneself requires an intention to act accordingly (Hare\n1952, 20), he seems committed to a closer connection between moral\njudgment and motivating states than the Missionaries and Cannibals\nArgument vindicates. \n\nThus far we have been considering internalism as a reason to accept\nnon-cognitivism based on a sort of inference to the best explanation.\nInsofar as non-cognitivism can explain the connection between normative\nor moral judgments and motivation we have some reason to accept it.\nBut the explanations so far have relied on the positive part of\nnon-cognitivism – the part that connects the meanings of moral\nterms to commendation or the expression of attitudes. The denial of\ncognitivism so far has played no role. Since the expressivist or\nprescriptivist component of non-cognitivist theories does not by itself\nentail the denial of cognitivism, a cognitivist could take them on\nboard and explain a species of internalism just as non-cognitivists do\n(Copp 2001). \n\nThere is, however, a popular non-cognitivist strategy for arguing\nthat they are uniquely placed to explain judgment internalism. This\nstrategy proceeds from the Humean idea that belief alone is incapable\nof motivating action. The Humean Theory of Motivation, as it has come\nto be known, postulates that motives must always be composed of desires\nfor some end, possibly along with some relevant means-ends belief (Hume\n1888, 413; Smith 1987). The theory is supposed to rule out any state of\nmind which both qualifies as a cognitive state and which would be\nsufficient to motivate action by itself without supplementation from\nsome independent desire. If moral judgments necessarily motivate, even\nin the absence of further desires, the theory seems to entail that they\ncannot be genuine beliefs. They must be conative rather than cognitive\nstates, or at the very least be composites to which the non-cognitive\ncomponent is essential. Even if beliefs are also constituents of the\njudgment, those beliefs will not be identical to it, since they can\npersist in the absence of motivation while the moral judgments\nnecessitate motives (Blackburn 1998, 97–100). \n\nThis argument too can be resisted by cognitivists. It presupposes a\nparticularly strong version of internalism. If the nature of the\nnecessary connection between moral judgments and motives is of a\ndefeasible kind, it will be possible for someone to accept the\njudgment while remaining unmotivated (Korsgaard 1986; Dreier 1990;\nSmith 1994). And even a stronger version of judgment internalism might\nbe consistent with various subjectivist cognitivist theories,\nespecially those which relativize the truth of moral judgments to\nindividual agents. Such theories can make the truth conditions for the\njudgments include the presence of certain attitudes in the speaker and\nclaim that speakers are highly accurate in tracking that part of their\ntruth conditions (Harman 1978; Dreier 1990.). Furthermore, despite its\nlofty pedigree, the Humean Theory of Motivation is itself subject to\ndispute (Bromwich 2010; Dancy 1996; Darwall 1983; Nagel 1970; McDowell\n1981; Swartzer 2013, 2018; van Roojen 1995, 2002). \n\nIt is relatively common ground among moral theorists that moral properties\nsupervene on non-moral properties. Two items cannot differ in their\nmoral properties without differing in some non-moral property as well.\nOr to put the point in terms more suited to the non-cognitivist, virtually all\nagree that it is inappropriate to treat two items as morally\ndistinguishable without believing that they are also distinguishable in\nsome other way. If two actions are otherwise indistinguishable, labeling one as\ngood thereby commits one to labeling the other as good.  \n\nSome non-cognitivists have argued that this uncontroversial datum\nsupports their theories against rival alternatives. Hare seems to have\nintroduced the term ‘supervenience’ to the philosophical\nliterature (Hare 1952, 145) and he suggested that his own theory,\nuniversal prescriptivism, was uniquely placed to explain it. Insofar as\nmoral prescriptions were by their nature universal they would prescribe\nor proscribe any action which was sufficiently similar to the action up\nfor evaluation. Thus Hare included supervenience as one of the\nphenomena that any adequate metaethical theory should explain and he\ncounted it as a point in favor of his theory that it did so. But the\nfeature of his theory that did the explanatory work was not its\nnon-cognitivism – rather it was that it required the judgments\nto be universal in the ways he specified. In fact, Hare himself\nsuggested that the supervenience of moral judgments on descriptive\nfeatures was part and parcel of these judgments having a secondary\ndescriptive meaning (Hare 1963, 7–22). \n\nOther contemporary expressivist theories can use a similar approach to\nexplaining supervenience. Take a version of expressivism which says\nthat a moral judgment that such and such an action is wrong predicates\na nonmoral property of that action and at the same time expresses\ndisapproval of that property. This too will explain supervenience,\ninsofar as the speaker will be committed by that moral judgment to\ndisapproving of anything else with that property. Gibbard’s (1990)\nworld-norm pair apparatus in which the judgments express attitudes\ntowards norms that pick out actions by their natural features will\ngenerate the same sort of result. (His 2003 update inherits this\nfeature as will be explained below.) Thus each of these theorists is\nable to explain supervenience. Many cognitivist theories can also\nexplain supervenience. Reductive naturalists theories will also be\nable to do the necessary explanatory work. If moral properties just\nare natural properties, there should be no surprise if two items\ncannot differ in their moral properties without also differing in\ntheir natural properties(Dreier 1993). We might thus conclude that\nsupervenience does not favor either cognitivism or\nnon-cognitivism. \n\nSimon Blackburn, however, argues that the phenomenon of\nsupervenience especially favors non-cognitivism. According to\nBlackburn, it is not just the simple fact that moral properties\nsupervene on nonmoral properties that needs to be explained. Nor is it\njust that appropriate moral predication must supervene on nonmoral\npredication, to put the point in a way that does not beg the question\nagainst non-cognitivism. It is rather to explain how honoring the\nsupervenience constraint can be a requirement of linguistic competence,\neven while there is no analytic entailment from nonmoral claims to\nmoral claims. In other words, what needs explaining is how\nsupervenience can be a conceptual requirement even while there is no\nanalytic equivalence between moral properties and any non-moral\nproperty. Blackburn thinks that we require such an explanation even if\nthere are metaphysically or nomically necessary connections between\nmoral and nonmoral terms or properties. For, he thinks, it is hard to\nsee how such nomic or metaphysical connections could justify the\nanalytic status of the supervenience thesis. People can be ignorant of\nnomic necessities for it is an empirical matter what natural laws\ngovern our world. And they might be ignorant of certain metaphysical\nnecessities while knowing all the truths about the meanings of their\nterms. So these necessities cannot justify the apriori and analytic\nstatus that the supervenience requirement has. Or to put the same point\ndifferently, a requirement to recognize some constraint that one should\nrecognize merely in virtue of having competence with the appropriate\nterms cannot be explained by citing a fact which mere linguistic\ncompetence does not put one in a position to recognize. \n\nBlackburn’s favored explanation of the difference in status between\nthe two claims is roughly as follows: Moral judgments must supervene\non judgments regarding natural properties because it is the point of\nmoral judgments “to guide desires and choices among the natural\nfeatures of the world” (Blackburn 1993, 137). Since this sort of\nexplanation makes reference to our purposes in using moral terms rather\nthan to an independent realm of moral fact, Blackburn thinks it\nsupports a quasi-realist account rather than a straightforward realist\ntheory. He goes on to suggest that because the explanation relies on\nfacts about what beliefs can coexist with linguistic competence, there\nis “no further inference to a metaphysical conclusion”\n(Blackburn 1993, 143). \n\nIt should be obvious that Blackburn’s argument is not entirely\nindependent of the arguments for non-cognitivism that we have already\nsurveyed. The claim that there is no analytic entailment from any\nnatural property to any moral property is simply Hume’s Law – a\ndatum often supported through use of the open question argument. Thus\nany reductive naturalist about moral properties will deny that premise\nof the argument along with the validity of the open question argument.\n(Dreier 1993) The thought that an explanation which involves the\npractical purposes to which moral judgments are put must favor\nnon-cognitivism over cognitivism might well depend on accepting a\nHumean division between inert beliefs and motivating\ndesires. Anti-Humeans just think that action-guiding purposes can be\nserved by beliefs concerning genuine properties (McDowell 1981;\nBromwich 2010; Swartzer 2013, 2018; van Roojen 1995). And cognitivists who agree that\nthe analytic status of supervenience needs explanation will not need\nto deny that such explanations require claims about what the competent\ncan believe; on many understandings of analyticity, analytic claims\njust are claims the linguistically competent must accept (Dreier\n1993). \n  Allan Gibbard (2003) has recently proposed a new argument for\nthe supervenience of normative judgements grounded in his fact-prac world apparatus as a\nrepresentational device for capturing normative judgments. Given that\naccount of the content of normative judgments it will turn out to be\nnecessary that those with moral attitudes are committed to normative\njudgments which treat descriptively identical items the same for\npurposes of planning.  This is because the plans themselves must be\nformulated so as to individuate circumstances of action using\n“recognitional” concepts.  Thus any two recognitionally identical\ncircumstances will yield the same plan of action. If Gibbard’s reasons\nfor thinking that plans must be formulated in recognitional terms are\ncogent, this result would allow the theory to explain the relevant\nphenomenon of supervenience. It does not, however, show that a\ncognitivist theory might not do just as well on its own terms. \n\nTheorists sometimes present the motivations for noncognitivism as rooted in the distinctive nature of moral disagreement.  For example, Gibbard (1990) begins with a puzzle about how (for instance) two people who both fully understand the prisoner’s dilemma scenario can still disagree over what it is rational for someone in such a situation to do.  It doesn’t seem that they are asking after the meaning of the word ‘rational’ yet there also doesn’t seem to be any descriptive fact over which they disagree.  And Stevenson (1944) begins his book by distinguishing the kind of disagreement in play when two people disagree in their ordinary beliefs from “disagreements in attitude” which involve conative clash.  Having made the distinction he suggests that moral disagreements involve both, and then uses that diagnosis to motivate his own noncognitivism as developed in the rest of the book. \n \n\nWhile each of these theorists highlights disagreement, it seems that\ndisagreement is only part of what generates the argument for\nnoncognitivism.  On one reading, Gibbard’s argument seems to tacitly\ninvolve one of the assumptions that makes the Open Question Argument\nseem compelling – that property identities are fully\ntransparent to competent thinkers.  Our confidence that the dispute\nover what is rational in the prisoner’s dilemma dispute is not over a\ndescriptive fact seems rooted in the stipulation that all the\ndescriptive facts are clear to both thinkers.  But that stipulation\nonly settles the matter if we further assume that the identity of\nrationality and the property picked out the the relevant description (if indeed there is such and identity) will\nbe transparent to the parties to the dispute.  So this reading of\nGibbard’s argument will have it stand or fall with the Open Question\nArgument.\n \nOn a second reading of Gibbard’s argument it emphasizes the\ndistinctive practical or action-guiding nature of moral concepts.\nWhat any purely descriptive account of the dispute leaves out is that\nthe parties disagree about what to do when in a prisoner’s dilemma.\nThis version of Gibbard’s point aligns with Stevenson’s –\nthere is a kind of practical disagreement that purely cognitive\nanalyses of moral arguments leave out.  If that is the point of\nadverting to disagreement we are back with the motivating concerns\ndiscussed in section 3.3.  So it may be best to just think of\ndisagreement as highlighting these prior ideas. \n\nOne strategy of objection to non-cognitivism is to find fault with the\nmain motivating ideas. We have already surveyed many of these in the\ncourse of discussing the arguments for non-cognitivism. We now turn to\nobjections resting on the content of the theory rather than its\nmotivations.  \n\nNon-cognitivism as it is often presented is incomplete. It gives us\nan account of the meanings of moral expressions in free standing\npredicative uses, and of the states of mind expressed when they are so\nused. But the identical expressions can be used in more complex\nsentences, sentences which embed such predications. Thus far we have\nnot considered what the expressions might mean when so used. We say\nthings such as the following: It is true that lying is wrong.\n\n Lying is not wrong.\n\n I wonder whether lying is wrong.\n\n I believe that lying is wrong.\n\n Fred believes that lying is wrong.\n\n Is lying wrong?\n\n If lying is wrong he will be sure to do it.\n\n If lying is wrong then so is misleading truth-telling. \n\nSo, in addition to their analyses of unembedded predication,\nnon-cognitivists owe us an account of the meanings of more complex\nsentences or judgments such as these. Of course there are some\ndesiderata we would like an adequate account to fulfill.  (1) One is\ncompositionality; the meaning of a complex sentence embedding a moral\nclaim should be a function of the meaning of its parts so as to\nexplain the ease with which speakers can understand novel normative\nsentences. (2) Another is that it should preserve and explain the\nlogical relations between moral judgements and other judgements which\nembed them, at least for central cases. And (3), we want the account\nnot to require implausible verdicts in attributing attitudes to people\nwho use the sentences. For example, if a non-cognitivist says the\nmeaning of ‘Lying is wrong’ is to express disfavor towards\nlying, that does not yet provide a good explanation of the attitude\nexpressed by the very same words used in many embedded contexts. When\nthose words occur in the antecedent of a conditional, or when a person\nsays, ‘I wonder if lying is wrong’ they they are typically\nnot being used to express such disapproval. The point here is not that\nthese desiderata cannot be satisfied. Leading contemporary\nnon-cognitivists have all tried to provide accounts. As it turns out,\nthe task is difficult and generates much controversy. \n\nGeach thought that the second and third desiderata would be especially\nhard to accomplish simultaneously. Normally we believe that the status\nof an argument as valid depends, at least in part, on the words not\nshifting in meaning as we move from premise to premise. But the\nsimplest story of the meaning of moral terms, that they are devices\nfor expressing pro and con attitudes, seems then to require that they\nmean something else when embedded in the antecedents of\nconditionals. Consider the following example from Geach (1965,\n463): (P1) If tormenting the cat is bad, getting your little\nbrother to do it is bad\n\n (P2) Tormenting the cat is bad.\nErgo, getting your little brother to torment the cat is\nbad. \n\nThe argument is valid. But if the entire meaning of ‘tormenting\nthe cat is bad’ in the second premise is well explained by\nsaying that it is suited for use in expressing disapproval of\ntormenting the cat, then that meaning cannot be the same as the\nmeaning it has in the first premise (which one might accept even if\none approves of tormenting cats). This doesn’t show that the\nexpression is not being used emotively in the second premise; a\ndescriptivist can agree to that. But it does indicate that more will\nneed to be said to explain what is going on. For straightforwardly\ndescriptive arguments of the same form, the explanation of why the\nargument is valid relies on the idea that the phrase in the antecedent\nhas a constant meaning that it represents both unembedded and\nembedded. This is what Geach has called The Frege Point: “A\nthought may have just the same content whether you assent to its truth\nor not; a proposition may occur in discourse now asserted, now\nunasserted, and yet be recognizably the same proposition” (Geach\n1965, 449). As Geach saw it, we need to think of predication as\nconstant across embedded and unembedded occurrences of predicative\nmoral sentences so as not to commit a fallacy of equivocation in\nmaking arguments. (It is due to Geach’s invocation of Frege in this\ncontext that the embedding problem is often called the Frege-Geach\nproblem.  Searle 1962 independently raises a version of the same\nobjection and some credit W. D. Ross (1939, 34–38) with an earlier yet\nstatement of the objection.) \nSemantic nonfactualism, the non-cognitivist commitment to the view\nthat moral judgments do not express propositions or predicate\nproperties, rules out one simple way of explaining matters. (But see\nthe discussion of hybrid theories below and in the supplementary\ndocument\n  Embedding Problem Response Strategies.)\nIf there is no proposition expressed in normal predicative uses of\nmoral expressions we eliminate one candidate for a constant element\nthat generates relations of implication with other expressions\nembedding the same form of words. Arguably we need some other\ncandidate to provide the commonality. As Geach noted, it isn’t\nplausibly the attitude expressed by the a free-standing sentence since\nthis feature doesn’t always survive embedding as we saw. Perhaps it\nmight be some predictable function of this attitude. That would serve\nthe goal of providing a compositional semantics for the terms in\nquestion.\n \nIt isn’t just that semantic nonfactualism eliminates a candidate for\nthe constant element uniting embedded and unembedded uses of the same\nnormative expression. Such nonfactualism also serves to complicate the semantics,\nbecause it eliminates a straightforward and easy way of explaining\nhow different beliefs can be inconsistent and how one belief can\ncommit one to another.  On a standard model for belief in general,\nbelief content is propositional and two beliefs are inconsistent when\ntheir contents – the propositions they are directed at – are\ninconsistent. And one belief logically commits one to another when the\ncontent of the first entails the second. Those two ideas, plus an\naccount of what it is for contents – that is propositions – to be\ninconsistent is all you need to explain the logical relations among\nbeliefs. It isn’t even really important to this general point that the\ncontents be propositions.  The point is that if you treat all beliefs\nas inheriting their logical properties from the logical properties of\ntheir contents in this way, you get a relatively simple story about\nattitudinal inconsistency and commitment.\n Once you say that ordinary beliefs and moral beliefs represent\ndifferent types of attitude towards their contents (if they have\ncontents at all) you can’t any longer tell the simple story.  This\nremains so even if the theory can allow moral attitudes to have\ncontents in some sense and even if these contents are the same kind of\nthing as the contents of ordinary beliefs. That’s because the\ndifferent relations to those contents (taking different attitudes\ntowards them) will need to be taken into account. The resulting theory\nwill need more complicated inconsistency and inference-licensing\nrules.  I’ll use R. M. Hare’s (1952) logic of phrastics and neustics\nto illustrate. Because it furthers my purpose in providing this\nexample I’m going to assume that sincere speech acts using moral terms\nexpress attitudes and that these attitudes are what we attribute when\nsay they believe something about morality.  This may be more than Hare\nwas committed to himself.\n \nHare thought we could model the logic of speech acts by employing one\nelement that represented a possible way things might be (the phrastic)\nand a second element that in effect gave instruction for how to\ninterpret the point of the representation (the neustic). For our\npurposes here we can think of the first element as the contents of the\nattitude expressed by the speech act and it would not distort the\ntheory too much to say they are propositions. On this way of\npresenting things, several different speech acts expressing a number\nof different attitudes will all involve the same phrastic.  The\ndifferences between them will be represented by differences in the\nneustic. The belief that P will be expressed by a speech act\nwhich is represented by a neustic that reflects the status of\nassertion and a phrastic that represents P. A question about\nwhether P is the case will be represented by the same phrastic,\nbut a different neustic – the one that represents the speech act\nas a question rather than an assertion. The sentence which expresses\nthe thought that P is good (say) will also employ this same\nphrastic. What distinguishes it from the first two is once again the\nneustic which will reflect that this judgement is a universal\nprescription to bring about P.  This means that we cannot\ncompute the logical compatibility or incompatibility of two judgements\nby noting the compatibility or incompatibility of their phrastics\nwhich we are treating as their contents. The assertion of P and\nthe attitude it expresses is different from the assertion\nthat P is good and the attitude it expresses.  Standard\nsemantic theory captures this by assigning these judgements different\ncontents.  Within the theory which treats the phrastic as the content,\nthe difference must be captured by assigning them different neustics\nas a reflection that they’re supposed to be different kinds of speech\nacts and to express different kinds of attitudes.  There isn’t yet a\nproblem with that.  But insofar as the judgements clearly have\ndifferent consistency conditions and involve different logical\ncommitments the resulting logic must now include principles that allow\ndifferences in attitude type to matter to consistency and\ninconsistency.\n Hare was aware of the point. And if we were dealing with only a few\ndifferent types of attitude and corresponding expressive speech act it\nshould be no difficulty at all.  But once we introduce new sentences\njoining the terms we have so far with logical connectives we are\nlikely to need to postulate yet further attitude types and to need\nfurther principles to capture their logical properties. Such complex\nsentences express attitudes that don’t reduce to the attitudes which\nwould be expressed by either conjunct (Schroeder 2008c, 49).  It would\nthus be wrong to equate the attitude expressed with either\naccepting the one attitude or accepting the other.  Relatedly, a\nspeech act “asserting” a disjunction with one normative\ndisjunct and one non-normative disjunct should be a new kind of speech\nact.  It doesn’t universally prescribe anything, nor (on the theory\nwe’re working with) does it assert anything. And similarly for the\nattitude expressed by that speech act. It will be a new type of state\nof mind. So we’ll need a new sort of neustic to capture the kind of\nspeech act this is. And we’ll need additional rules to tell us about\nthe logic of speech act types represented by those neustics.\n Schroeder (2008b, 2008c) dubs the distinction between\ninconsistencies that involve one attitude-type directed towards\ninconsistent contents, A-type inconsistencies and contrasts them with\nB-type inconsistencies which postulate inconsistencies that stem from\nincoherences between the attitude types in conjuction with their\ncontents. For example approving of a proposition and disapproving of\nthe same proposition is inconsistent (if it is) not in virtue of\ndirecting one and the same attitude at inconsistent propositions, but\nrather because two allegedly incompatible attitude-types are directed\nat the same proposition.  And he notes that the clearest examples of\ngenuine inconsistency – beliefs in contradictories and intentions\nto pursue inconsistent courses of action – seem to be A-type. He\nfurther suggests that this would be a reason to prefer an A-type model\nif non-cognitivists could construct one.\n \nNon-cognitivists have developed various ingenious strategies for\nconstructing a theory that preserves the intuitive logical relations\nbetween normative attitudes, non-normative attitudes and various mixed\nattitudes, along with the sentences that express them. We will briefly\nsurvey some main variants below.  For a more thorough survey see the\nsupplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies,\nwhich can be read in place of the remainder of section 4.1. Much of the recent innovation in developing non-cognitivist theories is\nmotivated by a desire to address the embedding problem.  In what\nremains of this section we will briefly survey three differing approaches to\nthe task, which may also be combined. These are (1) developing a logic\nof the sentences by explaining how that logic falls out of logical\nrelations among the attitudes they express, (2) exploiting minimalism\nwith regard to truth and related notions to provide an account of certain\nlocutions, and (3) allowing the descriptive semantic component\npostulated by hybrid expressivist theories to explain the logical\nrelations among normative sentences and attitudes.\n \nThe idea behind a logic of attitudes is to change the normal order of\nexplanation to explain why normative sentences and attitudes bear the\nlogical relations that they do to other sentences and attitudes.  As\nnoted above, standard cognitivist accounts of a domain of discourse\nwill explain the consistency or inconsistency of states of mind by\nciting the consistency or inconsistency of that state’s content, that\nis what it represents. The belief that dogs howl is inconsistent with\nthe belief that dogs don’t howl because their contents (that dogs do\nor don’t howl) are inconsistent with one another.  And similarly for\nthe sentences expressing those beliefs. Since noncognitivists don’t\npostulate such representational contents they can’t deploy that\nexplanation.  But they might still be able to do justice to the fact\nthat normative judgments and sentences stand in logical relations to\none another if they can explain how the judgments themselves stand in\ncertain logical relations to to one another and then go on to explain\nthat the sentences are inconsistent just because they express\njudgments that are inconsistent.\n \nOne such approach has been to suggest that the complex moral or\nnormative judgments are higher order attitudes aimed at the\njudgements that would be expressed by the sentences which they\nembed. These higher order attitudes might either be complex beliefs\n(Blackburn 1971) or further non-cognitive judgments (Blackburn 1984)\nexpressed by the corresponding complex sentences. The hope is that\nthese judgments will have rational connections to the other judgments\nthat are likely to play a role in valid arguments. If all goes well, a\nkind of pragmatic incoherence or irrationality will be involved when\nsomeone accepts the judgments of a valid argument so analyzed while at\nthe same time rejecting the conclusion. Such a speaker would be in a\nstate similar to those uttering sentences of the sort that feature in\nMoore’s paradox, such as ‘It is raining but I don’t believe that\nit is.’\n \nA simple example of this sort of approach comes from\nBlackburn. Conditionals express higher order attitudes towards\naccepting certain conjunctions of attitudes. “If lying is wrong,\ntelling your little brother to lie is wrong,” (when sincerely\nuttered) expresses approval of making disapproval of getting one’s\nbrother to lie “follow upon” disapproval of lying.\n \nLogical entailments involving moral judgments are explained as\nfollows: A constellation of attitudes which includes the attitudes\nexpressed by the conditional and by the seemingly assertive premises\nbut not those expressed by the conclusion is irrational, because it\ngoes against the purposes of moral discourse. Somewhat more\nsophisticated ways of developing this strategy can be worked out but\nthe basic idea is well exemplified in this proposal. The logic of\nattitudes strategy has met with much resistance on the part of\ncognitivists. One line of thought is that these proposals conflate\ngenuine inconsistency with mere pragmatic incoherence (Hale 1986;\nSchueler 1988; Brighouse 1990; Zangwill 1992; van Roojen 1996). And\nnon-cognitivists have responded with increasingly more sophisticated\nproposals about the logic of attitudes, including several proposals\nthat do not employ higher order attitudes (Baker & Woods 2015; Blackburn 1988b; Gibbard 1990, 2003; Horgan and Timmons 2006b; Schroeder 2008a, 2008b,\n2008c). These are discussed in more detail in the supplementary\ndocument Embedding Problem\nResponse Strategies. \nSome have suggested that minimalism or deflationism about truth or\ntruth aptness can allow non-cognitivists to bypass some of the above\ndebates. A very rough characterization of minimalism about truth will\nhopefully suffice to explain. Minimalist theories are often presented\nby contrast with theories of truth according to which truth is some\nsort of “substantial” relation or property. For example\ncorrespondence theories which claim that truth involves a real\nrelation between truth-bearers and reality are often cited as paradigm\ncases of a substantial theory of truth. Most minimalists about truth\nsuggest that truth is not such a substantial property. Different\nminimalists formulate their positive claims in somewhat different\nways. One version suggests that all you need to know to understand the\n‘is true’ locution is that it is appropriate to use it in\nconjunction with any indicative sentence which is itself appropriate\nin the context of use. To call a sentence true is just to assert or\naffirm the sentence (Ramsey 1927). There are other variants besides\nthis one. What we need to note is just that the suggestion helps\nexplain the meaning of normative sentences in one embedded context,\nnamely the one in which it is embedded along in an ‘is true’\nconstruction.  Extensions of this minimalist strategy have attempted\nto deploy minimal conceptions of other notions such as truth-aptness,\nproposition (Horwich 1990, 18–22) and more besides to extend the\naccount to normative sentences seeming to employ these notions. Some\nminimalists have even claimed that these ideas will help with\nconstructions that don’t obviously involve terms that get minimal\ntreatments. Discussion of those proposals is found in the\nsupplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies. \nWe noted earlier that non-cognitivists have long granted to evaluative\nutterances and thoughts some secondary “descriptive\nmeaning” and that hybrid theorists have gone on to give that\ndescriptive content nearly co-equal status. One motivation for such\nviews is rooted in a strategy for solving the embedding problem:\nHybrid theorists hope to explain logical relations among moral\njudgements by using the descriptive component of meaning to do much of\nthe work. Hybrid theorists have differed over whether the\nnon-cognitive component is expressed semantically by some component of\nthe sentence or pragmatically. Still hybrid theorists tend to agree\nthat the belief contents are part of the semantic values of the\nsentences that express them (Jackson 1999, Barker 2000; Copp 2001;\nRidge 2006a, 2006b, 2014; Boisvert 2008; Copp 2009).  This would seem\nto entail that these sentences are inconsistent with any judgement\nthat a sentence expressing only the belief component would be\ninconsistent with. Hybrid theorists can thus use the alleged\ndescriptive component of the meanings of moral judgments to generate\nmost of the required logical relations that moral judgements bear to\nother judgements, supplementing the basic account just enough to\naccount for complications introduced by the non-cognitive component of\nrelevant judgements. \nCognitivists have raised doubts about the adequacy of several of these\nproposals due to the manner in which the descriptive meaning is\ndetermined by many of these theories(van Roojen 2005; Schroeder 2009)\nand how they can be used to communicate the content they allegedly\nhave (Schroeder 2009). Hybrid theorists have, of course, resisted\nthese complaints (Alm 2007, Ridge 2007; Eriksson 2010). and hybrid\ntheories that take epithets and slurs as their model aren’t subject to\nthe same objections (Copp 2001, 2009; Boisvert 2008). A more thorough\ndiscussion of these issues can be found in the supplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies. \n\nA well-known objection to non-cognitivism pays close attention to the\ndistinction between explaining logical relations on the one hand, and\nexplaining the use of moral judgments in reasoning on the other. Even\nif the embedding problem is solved, so that we know what moral\nutterances mean and what complex sentences embedding them also mean,\nwe might still think it irrational to reason in accordance with\nordinary logical principles applied to such judgments. The basic idea\nhere is that conditionals with moral antecedents and nonmoral\nconsequents should, together with the moral judgment in the\nantecedent, license acceptance of the consequent. Thus someone who\naccepts such conditionals would be rational to infer the consequent\nupon coming to accept the antecedent. But if expressivism is correct,\naccepting the antecedent just is holding a non-cognitive\nattitude. Thus the licensed inference is really a form of wishful\nthinking, for a non-cognitive change of attitude has licensed a change\nof belief. For example, suppose someone accepts a judgment expressible\nby saying, “If doing an action is wrong, George will do\nit.” Normally we think that it would be rational for that person\nto infer the belief that George will hit Sam upon coming to accept\nthat hitting Sam is wrong. But according to non-cognitivism, coming to\naccept that hitting Sam is wrong is just a change of non-cognitive\nattitude, and it can seem wrong to think that a change in such\nattitudes can rationalize a change in belief. It looks like the\nnon-cognitivist is committed to approving of something analogous to\nwishful thinking. That is they believe something, not because of a\nchange in their evidence but because of a change in attitude alone\n(Dorr 2002). Some non-cognitivists will resist by suggesting that the\nconditionals themselves are only rational to accept when one thinks\nthat changes of mind about the antecedent will depend on beliefs about\nfacts that are evidentially relevant to the conclusion (Budolfson 2011; Lenman 2003; Mabrito 2013;).\nEnoch (2003) presents an alternative response which is criticized in (Schroeder 2011,\nchapter 9). Another issue to do with moral reasoning has to do with\nuncertainty, insofar as we can be uncertain of our moral judgements\nand this will affect how we reason with them. Michael Smith (2002)\nargues that non-cognitivists have insufficient resources to distinguish\nvariations in moral certainty from differences in both the perceived\nimportance of what is being judged right or wrong and in the stability of\nsuch judgements under the influence of new information. The gradable\ndimensions of desire seem to be strength and stability. If strength is\nused to represent importance and stability to capture stability of\njudgements in the face of new information desires will lack a\ndimension to represent the certainty with which the moral\njudgement is held. Cognitivists, by contrast, can allow perceived importance to be captured\nby a further belief – the belief that the matter is of a certain\nimportance. So they can let certainty just be a matter of credence and robustness in the face of new evidence be just what it seems. Non-cognitivists, as usual, won’t just concede the point.  Rather they will explain how their theories have the resources to make the needed distinctions. Lenman (2003c) is an early response in this vein. And Sepielli (2012) argues that any view with enough structure to solve Frege-Geach can also make the relevant distinctions. Still, there has not yet been a lot of work by non-cognitivists on credence as applied to moral judgements. Staffel (forthcoming) is thus an important development, offering an account of credence for non-cognitivists and responding to Smith’s argument along the way.\n \n\nIt has seemed obvious to many that non-cognitivism has much in common\nwith various relativist metaethical views. Though non-cognitivists may\ndeny that the truth values of moral judgments are relative to\nspeakers or agents because such judgments have no truth values,\nnon-cognitivists have often accepted something similar to relativism.\nFor non-cognitivists hold that it is semantically appropriate for a\nperson to utter a moral judgment whenever she wishes to express the\nrelevant non-cognitive attitude. And many noncognitivists also believe that\nthere are few rational constraints\non holding the relevant attitudes.  But then it is hard to see how\nconsistent moral judgments can be mistaken (Carnap 1937, 30; Hare\n1963, 110). If relativism is problematic, it isn’t obvious that\nnon-cognitivism avoids the problems. \n\nStill many non-cognitivists have argued that the view does not entail\nor justify relativism. They claim that whether or not a moral judgment\nis mistaken is itself a matter for moral theorizing. A speaker should\nonly call a moral judgment true if he or she accepts that judgment. A\nspeaker who expresses his or her acceptance of relativism in the\nnormal way might say something such as “They’re both saying\nsomething true”. This might seem to be expressing commitment to\na very deferential moral theory – one according to which each\nagent should just do what she believes is right. The non-cognitivists\nwho adopt this response argue that this natural interpretation of such\nclaims is correct.  What may seem to be a higher level metaethical\nclaim – that no consistent set of moral judgments is\nmistaken – , is really just another moral judgment and hence one\nwhich would be rejected by any moral judge with substantive moral\ncommitments (Blackburn 1998, 296 & 304; Timmons 1999; Horgan and\nTimmons 2006c).\n\nIf this line of argument works it will allow\nnon-cognitivism to gain the allegiance of those who wish to deny\nrelativism while giving the motivations that lead to both it and\nnon-cognitivism their due. \n\nMany think it a desideratum in metaethical theorizing that a candidate\ntheory be consistent with all or most normative theories actually\ndefended by serious normative ethical proponents. This idea has played\nsome role in the debate over the embedding problem insofar as some of\nthe proposals have been inconsistent with substantive positions taken\nin the debate about the possibility of moral dilemmas (Gibbard 1990, 88; van Roojen\n1996, 324). But even aside from that particular\nissue, the desideratum can make a good deal of work for the\nnon-cognitivist because of the variety of kinds of moral theory and\nthe variety of differing but allegedly consistent judgments proposed\nby theorists. \n\nA simple example non-cognitivists need to be able to distinguish is\nthat judgements of rightness from judgements of goodness. According to\nstandard non-consequentialist theories, rightness and goodness can\ncome apart. In other words, a right action can be such as not to\nproduce the most goodness. Of course consequentialists deny this, and\nnon-consequentialists who use agent-relative values to specify the\nrightness of actions can also deny that rightness and goodness come\napart in this way (Broome 1991, chapter 1). But even if they are\nincorrect as a matter of substantive moral philosophy, it would seem\nthat competent moral judges can hold views of the sort described\nwithout contradiction. Non-cognitivists would like to be able to give\nan explanation of this consistent with their analyses.  Hence they\nneed a way of distinguishing the psychological states involved in\nmaking the two sorts of judgement. \n\nA salient strategy might be to claim that they attach to different\nthings – rightness to actions and goodness to states of affairs.\nStill it seems that competent speakers can and do consistently judge\ncertain actions right but not good. A different strategy would be to distinguish\nvarieties of positive attitudes such that one sort involves a kind of\napproval distinctive of rightness, whereas another involves a kind\ndistinctive of goodness. Yet another method would be to use something\nlike the two step approach Gibbard uses when he analyzes judgments of\nrightness in terms of judging it rationally appropriate to feel guilt\nand anger at certain actions. The approval could be all of the same\nsort, but the objects of approval might be feelings of guilt in one\ncase and feelings of sorrow in the other, even when these feelings are\ndirected at one and the same object such as an action. No doubt there\nare other available strategies so the problem does not by itself\nconstitute an objection. It can however complicate the task of\nconstructing an adequate non-cognitivist theory, especially since it\ncan impact the force of other objections as with the embedding problem\nand moral dilemmas noted above. \n\nA discussion of an additional issue raised in trying to account for\nthe variety of moral judgments with in a non-cognitivist framework is\nfound in the following supplementary document. Supplement on\n Agent-Centered Teleology \n\nNon-cognitivist success in handling the embedding problem and related\nworries about reasoning would put non-cognitivists in a stronger\nargumentative position. But  some commentators have suggested\nthat success at this endeavor might be a mixed blessing. Success may\nindicate not that non-cognitivism is the right account of moral\njudgments, but instead that the contrast with cognitivism is not stark\nenough to make out a real distinction. Perhaps the distinction between\ncognitivism and non-cognitivism collapses as non-cognitivist theories\nare modified to capture all of the phenomena that cognitivists\nchallenge them to explain. While both its advocates and those who\nargued strenuously against it would likely find themselves somewhat\ndisoriented if this were correct, it does seem that non-cognitivists\nwould be most upset by this result. For their position was defined by\ndenying key components of standard realist positions. If the\ncognitivist/non-cognitivist dichotomy does not hold up, it would seem to\nshow either that the standard positions were not after all committed to\nthose components, or that those commitments could not be avoided by\nplausible theories.  \n\nEarly versions of non-cognitivism did not seem subject to this sort\nof objection, precisely because they did not worry much about\nvindicating overall moral practice. Carnap (1937, 30–31) was happy to\nconvict ordinary moral thinking of error. But as non-cognitivists have\nattempted to make sense of and explain most of the seemingly realist\nfeatures of moral practice, it might seem hard to sustain the claim of\na sharp contrast between factual language on the one hand and normative\nlanguage on the other. Several challenges based on roughly this idea\nfind a home in the recent literature. \n\nOne way to push the point is to challenge the non-cognitivist to\ndistinguish non-cognitivism from cognitivist relativism. A speaker\nrelativist is in a particularly good position to highlight the\nsuggestion that there is little difference between sophisticated\nnon-cognitivism and cognitivism. Both speaker relativists and\nnon-cognitivists can say that the appropriateness of a moral judgment\ndepends on a speaker’s attitudes. If the non-cognitivist suggests that\nmoral judgments predicate properties in a secondary way (perhaps to\nhandle embedding), the cognitivist relativist can agree. And the\ntheories can agree that the property predicated is determined as a\nfunction of the speaker’s moral attitudes. Thus it becomes increasingly\ndifficult to say precisely what the difference between the views is\n(Dreier 1999).  \n\nAnother line of argument with a similar upshot proceeds from\nminimalism of the sort we have already canvassed. Deflationism about\ntruth or truth-aptness can be used to argue that there is no room for\nnon-cognitivism of the sort that succeeds in vindicating much of moral\npractice. If there is no more robust understanding of truth conditions\nthan can be secured by minimalism about truth conditions, it will be\ndifficult for the quasi-realist non-cognitivist to make the\ndistinctive negative semantic claim – that\nmoral judgements are never true and not the kind of thing that can be\ntrue or false. Simple moral sentences may be truth apt if all there is\nto having truth conditions is to meet minimal requirements of having a\nmeaningful use, being in the right mood, and combining grammatically\nwith other sentences to yield more complex embeddings.  Furthermore,\nif the minimalist strategy extends to beliefs, so that all there is to\nbeing a belief is to be a state of mind expressible by such minimally\ntruth–apt sentences, moral judgements will be beliefs. The\nquasi-realist program to vindicate as much of ordinary moral practice\nmight thus endanger non-cognitivism when carried to this\nextreme. Success would leave us with no way to distinguish plausible\nnon-cognitivism from cognitivism. \nMore concretely, some semantic theorists have proposed that all that\nis needed to have minimal truth conditions is for a set of judgments\nto satisfy two constraints: (1) Sentences composed of the relevant\nexpressions must exhibit the syntactic surface features of\nparadigmatic truth-apt sentences such as those used to express ordinary assertions, and they must\nembed grammatically in more complex sentences such as conditionals,\npropositional attitude ascriptions, and so on. (2) Use of these\nexpressions must exhibit a certain amount of discipline so that there\nare clearly appropriate and inappropriate conditions for using them in\nsentences of the form noted in the first condition (Boghossian 1990,\nWright 1993; Divers and Miller 1994). Normative discourse seems to\nmeet both of these constraints relatively straightforwardly, and this\nmay mean that moral sentences are truth-apt and that some of them are\ntrue (Divers and Miller 1994). \nEarly critics of the collapse argument resisted on the basis of an\nalleged constitutive connection between truth-aptness and genuinely\ncognitive states. Such theorists regard it as a platitude about\nindicative sentences that they are conventionally apt for making\nassertions and that assertions express beliefs. If belief-expression\nis one of the criteria for truth-aptness, non-cognitivists will be in\na position to use psychological non-cognitivism as a reason to deny\nthat moral judgments are genuinely representational even when they\nmeet minimalist requirements (Jackson, Oppy, Smith 1994). So-called\nminimal truth conditions can remain part of the quasi-realist program\nso long as this is compatible with denying that moral judgements\nexpress beliefs. \nPartly in  response to this move, minimalist defenders of the collapse argument have\nresponded by moving to the notion of minimal belief.  They can say that\na state of mind is a belief and hence cognitive if and only if it is\none expressed by a sentence with truth conditions.  Since minimalism\nsecures minimal truth conditions, indicative moral sentences have\ntruth conditions and the states they express are beliefs. If the\nargument works, quasi-realist non-cognitivism would undermine its own\nright to employ both of the negative constitutive claims distinctive\nof non-cognitivism. \nMinimalist non-cognitivists have regrouped in various ways.  One way\nis to resist the extension of the minimalist strategy to\nbelief (Sinclair 2007). Another is to distinguish minimal and robust\nnotions of belief and representation. Minimal beliefs would need only\nto be states of mind expressed in assertions by indicative sentences,\nwhile robust beliefs would meet some stronger requirement of\nrepresentationality (Blackburn 2006).  Non-cognitivism would then be committed to the\nview that moral judgements did not express robust belief (Sinclair\n2006; McDonald 2012). The hope would be to contrast the entire\nminimalist package with robust truth, robust truth-conditionality, and\nrobust belief. Such quasi-realist minimalists would be trying to find\ntruth conditions which are (1) sufficient to make sense of using\nsentences having such truth-conditions in all of the ways that we use\nparadigmatically truth-apt sentences, and (2) which still fall short\nof robust representational truth conditions.  One might be a bit worried about the dialectic.  If there are\nminimal and non-minimal readings of all the distinctive claims that can\nbe used to distinguish cognitivism from non-cognitivism, we may lose\nare grip on the distinction between the positions (Dreier, 2004b).\n \nIt is in any case controversial whether the minimalist proposal is\nviable, either for truth conditionality or for belief, let alone for\nfurther extensions beyond these (Dreier 2006; Dunaway 2010). \n\n \n\nOne final sort of worry about the distinctiveness of non-cognitivism\nis worthy of mention. This worry is that if too many domains of\ndiscourse are such that they require non-cognitive analysis, the\ncontrast between cognitive and non-cognitive domains on which the view\ndepends will be hard to sustain. Blackburn, for example, suggests\nquasi-realist approaches not just to moral discourse, but also to\nmodality, causation and probability. One may wonder what he means to\ndeny about these domains that is not also applicable to the rest of\nour seemingly contentful judgments (Rosen 1998).  This kind of\ncollapse is in danger of assimilating the putatively cognitive and the\nputatively non-cognitive from the other \ndirection – by making the former look more like the\nlatter, rather than the other way around as with the worries about\nminimalism. Even Blackburn himself on occasion expresses worries about\nthis problem (Blackburn 1993, 34), but more commonly he and other\nnon-cognitivists resist the worry by pointing to other domains of\ndiscourse which are not amenable to non-cognitivist analysis.  \n\nA short discussion of a still different collapse argument employed\nagainst noncognitivism by Frank Jackson and Philip Pettit, one which\nhas generated quite a bit of literature, can be found in the following\nsupplementary document. Supplement on\n Assertion Conditions and Truth-Conditionality \n\nNon-cognitivism first came on the scene as a rather starkly drawn\nalternative to prevailing cognitivist and realist construals of moral\ndiscourse. As it developed to enable it to explain features of moral\ndiscourse relied on by its critics, the view became more subtle and\npresented a less stark contrast with realist positions. The main\nnegative claims were often somewhat moderated. For example, the claim\nthat moral judgments had no descriptive meaning evolved into a claim\nthat any such meanings were secondary. The claim that moral judgments\ncould not be true or false became the claim that they could be true or\nfalse only in a minimal or deflationary sense. Not all of the shifts\nhave been embraced by all non-cognitivists, but it is fair to say that\ncurrent versions are more complex and subtle than the theories from\nwhich they descend. As a result the arguments for and against the views\nhave gotten rather intricate and even technical. That trend is likely\nto continue for at least a while longer as ideas from other areas of\nphilosophy are employed to further hone the objections and fill out the\nresponses to them.
