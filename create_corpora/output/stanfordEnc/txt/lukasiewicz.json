His most famous\nachievement was to give the first rigorous formulation of many-valued\nlogic. He introduced many improvements in propositional logic, and\nbecame the first historian of logic to treat the subject’s\nhistory from the standpoint of modern formal logic.\n\n\n\nJan Łukasiewicz's life was that of a career academic and\nscholar, seriously disrupted by the upheavals of war in the twentieth\ncentury. Born and educated in Polish Austria, he flourished in\nPoland's Second Republic, endured the hardships of war, fled\nahead of the Red Army to Germany, and found a final haven in the\nRepublic of Ireland. \n\n Jan Leopold Łukasiewicz was born on 21 December 1878 in\n Lwów[1], \n historically a Polish city, at that time the capital of\nAustrian Galicia. Łukasiewicz's father Paweł was a\ncaptain in the Austrian military, his mother Leopoldine, née\nHoltzer, was daughter of an Austrian civil servant. Jan was their only\nchild. The family spoke Polish. Łukasiewicz attended school\n(classical Gimnazjum or grammar school, emphasizing classical\nlanguages) from 1890, completing in 1897 and beginning the study of law\nat the University of Lwów. Under Austrian rule the university\npermitted instruction in Polish. In 1898 he switched to mathematics,\nstudying under Józef Puzyna, and philosophy, studying under Kazimierz\nTwardowski, who had been appointed Extraordinary (Associate) Professor\nthere in 1895, and also Wojciech Dzieduszycki. In 1902\nŁukasiewicz was awarded his doctorate in philosophy under\nTwardowski with a dissertation “On induction as the inverse of\ndeduction”. Having achieved only top marks in all examinations\nbetween his school leaving examinations and his dissertation, he was\nawarded the doctorate sub auspiciis Imperatoris, a rare\ndistinction, and he received a diamond ring from Emperor Franz\nJosef. \n\nFrom 1902 he was employed as a private teacher and as a clerk in the\nuniversity library. In 1904 he obtained a scholarship from the\nGalician autonomous government and went to study in Berlin then in\nLouvain. In 1906 he obtained his Habilitation with a piece on\n“Analysis and construction of the concept of cause”. As a\nPrivatdozent in Philosophy, he was able to give lectures at\nthe university, becoming the first of Twardowski's students to join\nhim in doing so. His first course of lectures, delivered in Autumn\n1906, was on the algebra of logic, as formulated by Couturat. In 1908\nand 1909 he obtained a stipendium which enabled him to visit Graz,\nwhere he made acquaintance with Alexius Meinong and his school. In\n1911 he was appointed Extraordinary Professor, and continued to teach\nin Lwów until the outbreak of war in 1914. During this time his\nstudents included Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Tadeusz Kotarbiński,\nwho would later become famous philosophers in their own right. He also\nin 1912 got to know Stanisław Leśniewski, who had however\ncome to Lwów after studying abroad and cannot be counted as his\npupil. \n\nIn 1915 the fortunes of war put Germany in control of Warsaw, and they\ndecided to re-open the university, which had not been allowed to\nfunction as a Polish-speaking university under Russian rule.\nŁukasiewicz became professor of philosophy there. In 1916 he was\ndean of the Faculty of Arts, and in 1917 prorector of the university.\nIn 1918 he left the university, being appointed Head of the Department\nof Higher Schools in the new Polish Ministry of Education, and after\nPoland obtained full independence he became Minister of Education\nin Paderewski's Cabinet, serving from January to December 1919.\nFrom 1920 until 1939 he was, as was Leśniewski, a Professor in the\nFaculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Warsaw. In 1922/23 and\nagain in 1931/32 he served as rector of the university. In 1929 he\nmarried Regina Barwińska. \n\nThe interwar period was most fruitful for Łukasiewicz. He was a\nleading figure, with Leśniewski and Tarski, in what became known\nas the Warsaw School of Logic. He made a friend of the only German\nprofessor of mathematical logic, Heinrich Scholz, and was awarded an\nhonorary doctorate by the latter's University of Münster in\n1938. Other honors awarded him in this period were Grand Commander of\nthe Order of Polonia Restituta (1923), Grand Commander of the Hungarian\nOrder of Merit, a monetary award from the City of Warsaw (1935) and\nmemberships of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences in\nKraków, and the Polish Scientific Societies in Lwów and\nWarsaw. \n\nStudents whom he supervised through their doctoral dissertations were:\nMordechaj Wajsberg, Zygmunt Kobrzyński, Stanisław\nJaśkowski, Bolesław Sobociński, and Jerzy\nSłupecki. \n\nAt the outbreak of war in September 1939 the Łukasiewiczes'\nhome was bombed by the Luftwaffe: all his books, papers and\ncorrespondence were destroyed, except for one volume of his bound\noffprints. The Łukasiewiczes lived in provisional accommodation\nfor academics. The German occupiers closed the university and\nŁukasiewicz found employment for a meagre salary in the Warsaw\ncity archives. Additional financial support came from Scholz.\nŁukasiewicz taught in the underground university. From late 1943,\nfearing the imminent arrival and occupation of Poland by the Red Army,\nand under suspicion by some colleagues of being pro-German and\nanti-Jewish, Łukasiewicz expressed the wish to Scholz that he and\nhis wife should leave Poland. As a first step to their going to\nSwitzerland, Scholz managed to obtain permission for the\nŁukasiewiczes to travel to Münster. They left Warsaw on 17\nJuly 1944, just two weeks before the outbreak of the Warsaw Rising.\nFollowing the 20 July 1944 bomb plot against Hitler there was no hope\nof them obtaining permission to leave for Switzerland. They stayed in\nMünster, enduring allied bombing, until January 1945, when they\nwere offered accommodation by Jürgen von Kempski at his farm in\nHembsen (Kreis Höxter, Westphalia), where they were liberated by\nAmerican troops on 4 April. \n\nFrom the summer of 1945 Łukasiewicz taught logic at a Polish\nsecondary school set up at a former Polish POW camp in Dössel. In\nOctober 1945 they were allowed to travel to Brussels. There\nŁukasiewicz again taught logic at a provisional Polish Scientific\nInstitute. Being unwilling to return to a Poland under communist\ncontrol, Łukasiewicz looked for a post elsewhere. In February 1946\nhe received an offer to go to Ireland. On 4 March 1946 the\nŁukasiewiczes arrived in Dublin, where they were received by the\nForeign Secretary and the Taoiseach Eamon de Valera. In autumn 1946\nŁukasiewicz was appointed Professor of Mathematical Logic at the\nRoyal Irish Academy (RIA), where he gave lectures at first once and\nthen twice a week. \n\nIn his final years in Ireland Łukasiewicz resumed contacts with\ncolleagues abroad, particularly Scholz, with whom he was in constant\ncorrespondence. He attended conferences in Britain, France and Belgium,\nsent papers to Poland before being expelled (with 15 other exiled\nPoles) from the Polish Academy in Kraków, lectured on\nmathematical logic at Queen's University Belfast and on\nAristotle's syllogistic at University College Dublin. His health\ndeteriorated and he had several heart attacks: by 1953 he was no longer\nable to lecture at the Academy. In 1955 he received an honorary\ndoctorate from Trinity College Dublin. On 13 February 1956 after an\noperation to remove gallstones he suffered a third major coronary\nthrombosis and died in hospital. He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in\nDublin, “far from dear Lwów and Poland”, as his\ngravestone reads. Regina deposited most of his scientific papers and\ncorrespondence with the RIA. In 1963 the Academy transferred their\nholdings to the library of the University of Manchester, where they\nremain, uncatalogued. The choice of Manchester was due to the presence\nthere as a lecturer of Czesław Lejewski, who had studied with\nŁukasiewicz in Warsaw and twice been examined by the latter for\ndoctoral theses, once in 1939, when war intervened, a second time in\nLondon in 1954. Lejewski had seen the second edition of\nŁukasiewicz's book on Aristotle's syllogistic\nthrough the press: it appeared posthumously in 1957. \n\nŁukasiewicz was one of Twardowski's first students in\nLwów, and was influenced in his attitudes and methods by his\nteacher. Twardowski was born and studied in Vienna, where he became a\ndisciple of Franz Brentano, and was imbued with the latter's\npassionate advocacy of philosophy as a rigorous discipline, to be\ninvestigated with the same care and attention to detail as any\nempirical science, and to be communicated with utmost transparency. In\n1895 Twardowski was appointed Professor Extraordinary in Lwów.\nHe found Polish philosophical life dormant and third-rate, and set\nabout vitalising the subject and building its Polish institutions, at\nthe cost of his own academic output. Like Brentano, he believed that a\nsound descriptive psychology was methodologically basic for philosophy,\nand like Brentano he advocated modest reforms in formal logic.\nŁukasiewicz, under the influence of Husserl, Russell and Frege,\nrejected any foundational role for psychology, and inspired in\nparticular by the latter two, he carried the reform of logic far beyond\nanything Twardowski envisaged. He read Russell's The\nPrinciples of Mathematics in 1904 and it influenced him\nconsiderably. The general attitude that philosophy could and should\naspire to be scientifically exact was one that stayed with\nŁukasiewicz, though his estimation of the state of the subject\ntended to become more pessimistic than optimistic, and he advocated\nfundamentally reforming philosophy along logical lines. \n\nAnother respect in which Łukasiewicz continued the tradition of\nthe Brentano School was in his respect for the history of philosophy,\nparticularly that of Aristotle and the British empiricists. (He and\nTwardowski translated Hume's first Enquiry into Polish.)\nTwardowski, who knew Bolzano's work well, pointed out\nsimilarities between concepts in Bolzano's and\nŁukasiewicz's theories of probability. The respect for\nhistory also lay behind Łukasiewicz's groundbreaking studies\nin the history of logic, notably his accounts of Stoic propositional\nlogic and Aristotle's syllogistic.  \n\nŁukasiewicz emulated and indeed surpassed Twardowski in his\nattention to clarity of expression. Qualified experts agree that\nŁukasiewicz's scientific prose, in whichever of the three\nlanguages in which he wrote, is of unmatched clarity and beauty. \n\nIn the years before World War I, Łukasiewicz worked\npredominantly on matters to do with the methodology of science. His\ndoctorate, published in 1903 as “On induction as the inverse of\ndeduction”, investigated the relationship between the two forms\nof reasoning, in the light of work by Jevons, Sigwart and Erdmann.\nInductive reasoning, proceeding from singular empirical statements,\nattempts on his early view to reach a general conclusion to which a\ncertain probability can be ascribed. But he soon shifted to the view\nthat it is impossible to ascribe a determinate probability to a general\nstatement on the basis of induction. Rather the method of the empirical\nsciences is to creatively hazard the thought that a certain\ngeneralization is true, deduce singular conclusions from this, and then\nsee whether these are true. If one conclusion is not, then the general\nstatement is refuted. This, an early formulation of the\nhypothetico-deductive method of science, anticipates the ideas of\nPopper by more than two decades, though expressed less forcefully.\nŁukasiewicz also anticipated Popper by stressing what he called\n“creative elements in science”, against the idea that the\nscientist's task is to reproduce or replicate the facts. \n\nAn interest in probability lay behind one of Łukasiewicz's two\nmonographs published before the war, namely Logical Foundations of\nProbability Theory, which was written and published not in Polish\nbut in German. In 1908 and 1909 Łukasiewicz visited Graz where\nboth Alexius Meinong and Ernst Mally were also working on probability\ntheory at this time, so it is likely that the book was written in\nGerman because their language of discussion was German, and also in\norder to ensure a wider audience. Łukasiewicz's theory makes\nconstructive use of ideas plucked from elsewhere: from Frege he took\nthe idea of a truth-value, from Whitehead and Russell the idea of an\nindefinite proposition, and from Bolzano the idea of the ratio of true\nvalues to all values for a proposition. Consider the classical urn\nexample, where an urn contains m black balls and n\nwhite balls. Let the indefinite proposition ‘\\(x\\) is a\nblack ball in this urn’ be such that the variable\n‘\\(x\\)’ may take as value any expression naming a\nball in the urn: the variable is then said to range over the\nindividual balls, and different expressions naming the same ball to\nhave the same value. (Note that Łukasiewicz indeed uses the\nterminology, later associated with Quine, of a variable taking values,\nhere expressions, and ranging over objects designated by said\nexpressions.) An indefinite proposition is said to be true if it\nyields a true proposition (Łukasiewicz says\n‘judgement’ for a definite proposition) for all values of\nits variables, it is false if it yields a false judgement for all\nvalues, and is neither true nor false if it yields true judgements for\nsome values and false judgements for others. The ratio true values/all\nvalues is then called by Łukasiewicz the truth-value of\nthe indefinite proposition. For true indefinites it is 1, for false\nindefinites it is 0, and for others it is a rational number between 0\nand 1 (rational because only finite domains are considered). In our\nurn case the truth-value of the indefinite proposition\n‘x is a black ball in this urn’ is\n\\(\\frac{m}{m+n}\\). \n\nOn this basis Łukasiewicz develops a calculus of truth-values in\nwhich he can deal with logically complex propositions, conditional\nprobability, probabilistic independence, and derive Bayes'\nTheorem. The calculus of truth-values is used as a logical\ntheory of probability, assisting us in our dealings with definite\nreality: Łukasiewicz denies that there can be a theory either of\nobjective or of subjective probability as such. Two ideas from this\nshort but remarkable work are worth emphasizing because they resonate\nwith later ones of Łukasiewicz. Firstly, there is the idea of a\nproposition (in this case an indefinite proposition) being neither\ntrue nor false; secondly, and connected with this, of such a\nproposition having a numerical truth-value properly between 0 (false)\nand 1 (true).  Łukasiewicz's theory deserves to be better known:\nit continues and extends earlier ideas of Bolzano, his probability\ncorresponding to the latter's degree of validity of a proposition\n(with respect to variable components). Its chief drawback is that it\nis formulated for finite domains only. \n\nOf all the works Łukasiewicz published before World War I, one\nmost clearly anticipated his later concerns. This was the 1910\nmonograph On the Principle of Contradiction in Aristotle. It\nmarked a crucial turning point in the development of the\nLwów-Warsaw school. For Łukasiewicz it represented\nthe first sustained questioning of the assumptions of traditional\nAristotelian logic. \n\nŁukasiewicz introduces the project of his monograph, a critical\ninvestigation of the legitimacy of the Principle of Contradiction (PC)\nas variously formulated by Aristotle, in the context of its critique by\nHegel and the opportunity to re-examine the PC in the light of the\ndevelopment of mathematical logic from Boole to Russell.\nŁukasiewicz's sources for the post-Hegelian discussion of\nthe ‘logical question’ are Ueberweg, Trendelenburg and\nSigwart. A more local background was probably Twardowski's\naccount of the absolute and timeless nature of truth. \n\nŁukasiewicz distinguishes three different, non-equivalent versions\nof PC in Aristotle: an ontological version, a logical version, and a\npsychological version, as follows: \nOntological (OPC): No object may at the same time possess and\nnot possess the same property. \nLogical (LPC): Contradictory statements are not\nsimultaneously true. \nPsychological (PPC): No one can simultaneously believe\ncontradictory things. \n\nŁukasiewicz criticises Aristotle for on the one hand claiming\nPC cannot be proved, and on the other hand attempting an indirect or\npragmatic “proof”. In partial agreement with the tradition\naccording to which PC is not the cornerstone or basic principle of\nlogic, Łukasiewicz claims that its status is less secure than some\nother logical propositions, and that its function is principally to\nserve as a pragmatic norm. Nevertheless, in an Appendix to the book he\ngives a formal derivation of one version of PC from other assumptions.\nThis shows that PC is as it were just one logical theorem among others,\na statement that would raise few eyebrows today but was fairly radical\nin its day. Among the assumptions used in the derivation is a version\nof the Principle of Bivalence, that every proposition is either true or\nfalse and none is both, so the derivation of PC is not after all such a\nsurprise. \n\nŁukasiewicz described himself later as attempting in the\nmonograph to devise a “non-Aristotelian logic” but admits\nthat he did not succeed, principally because at this stage he was not\nprepared to reject the principle of bivalence. It may well be\nMeinong's influence at work when Łukasiewicz comes to give his\nnatural-language renderings of the symbolism of Couturat's algebra of\nlogic in the Appendix. There is little or no trace of the\npropositional logic that Łukasiewicz was to make very much his\nown: the renderings are clumsily object-theoretic: the constant\n‘0’ for example, which might be naturally construed as a\nconstant false proposition (and is so in later Łukasiewicz) is\nrendered as “the object that does not exist”. This is one\nreason why Łukasiewicz's formal work in the Appendix to the 1910\nwork appears relatively archaic. While the variable letters like\n\\(a, b\\) etc. “signify affirmative statements” and\ntheir negations \\(a', b'\\) etc. “signify\nnegative statements”, and in practice do work like propositional\nvariables and their negations in modern propositional logic,\nŁukasiewicz's renderings of them are curiously hybrid: \n‘\\(a\\)’ is rendered as ‘\\(X\\) contains\n\\(a\\)’ and ‘\\(a'\\)’\nas ‘\\(X\\) contains no \\(a\\)’, while \n‘1’ signifies ‘\\(X\\) is an object’ and \n‘0’ signifies ‘\\(X\\) is not an object’. \nThis is all very confused, and by no means a classical sentential logic \nin intent, even if it works like one in practice.  \n\nWhile not in itself a success, the book shows Łukasiewicz on\nthe threshold of his later logical breakthroughs. It was read in 1911\nby the young Leśniewski, who sought against Łukasiewicz to\nprove OPC, and who first introduced himself in 1912 on\nŁukasiewicz's doorstep with the words, “I am\nLeśniewski, and I have come to show you the proofs of an article\nI have written against you.” The book also contains a brief\ndiscussion of Russell's Paradox, and it was reading this that inspired\nLeśniewski to become a logician, intent on providing a\nparadox-free logical foundation for mathematics. The book promoted\nfurther discussion in Lwów: Kotarbiński wrote in defense\nof Aristotle's idea, discussed by Łukasiewicz, that a statement\nabout future contingent events may lack a truth-value before the event\nand only gain one afterwards, while Leśniewski wrote in\nopposition to this and brought Kotarbiński round to his own view\n(which agreed with earlier views of Twardowski and later ones of\nTarski) that truth is timeless, or as Leśniewski expressed it,\nboth eternal and sempiternal. Łukasiewicz was soon to side with\nthe earlier Kotarbiński, and in so doing to make his most famous\ndiscovery, that of many-valued logic. \n\nŁukasiewicz came across propositional logic, which he originally\nfollowed Whitehead and Russell in calling ‘theory of\ndeduction’, in their work and also in that of Frege. In 1921\nŁukasiewicz published a ground-clearing article,\n“Two-Valued Logic”, in which he brought together results\nin the algebra of logic governing the two truth-values true and false,\nwhich, like Frege, Łukasiewicz construed as what sentences or\npropositions denoted, but for which, unlike Frege, he\nintroduced constant propositional symbols ‘1’ and\n‘0’. He intended it as the first part of a monograph on\nthree-valued logic, which however was never completed, probably\nbecause Łukasiewicz became dissatisfied with the rather hybrid\napproach which was already being outdated by his rapid\ndevelopment. The article is notable for several innovations. Using a\nsymbolism derived from those of Couturat and Peirce, it introduces the\nidea of axiomatic rejection alongside that of axiomatic assertion,\nwhich latter was of course familiar from Frege, Whitehead and\nRussell. The constants ‘0’ and ‘1’ also occur\nin asserted and rejected formulas, in effect setting up an\nobject-language version of truth-tables. To show this we use\nŁukasiewicz's later parenthesis-free notation (see\nthe supplementary document \n(Łukasiewicz's Parenthesis-Free or Polish Notation) \n and his symbols ‘\\(\\vdash\\)’ for assertion and\n‘\\(\\dashv\\)’ for rejection, to be read respectively as\n“I assert” and “I reject”. The first\nprinciples of logic are simply \\({\\vdash}1\\) and \\({\\dashv}0\\) but to\nindicate the tabulation for implication the following principles must\nbe adhered to: \\({\\vdash}C00, {\\vdash}C01, {\\dashv}C10, {\\vdash}C11\\).\nWhen Łukasiewicz employed propositional variables, he quantified\nthem in the manner of Peirce, using ‘\\(\\Pi\\)’ for the\nuniversal and ‘\\(\\Sigma\\)’ for the particular\nquantifier.  \n\nŁukasiewicz and his students made the study of propositional\ncalculi very much their own: the results obtained between 1920 and\n1930 were published in a 1930 joint paper of Łukasiewicz and\nTarski, “Untersuchungen über den\nAussagenkalkül”. Work proceeded on both classical\n(bivalent) and many-valued calculi. The clearest and most complete\ndemonstration of how Łukasiewicz in his maturity treated\nclassical propositional calculus comes in his 1929 student textbook,\nbased on lecture notes, Elements of Mathematical Logic. The\nsystem, following Frege, is based on implication \\((C)\\) and\nnegation \\((N)\\) alone, with the elegant axiom set \n\nand three rules of inference: modus ponens, a rule of uniform\nsubstitution of formulas for propositional variables, and a rule of\ndefinitional replacement. On this basis, and using an extremely\ncompressed linear notation for proofs which is at the opposite extreme\nof Frege's space-occupying proofs, Łukasiewicz proves around 140\ntheorems in a mere 19 pages. \n\nŁukasiewicz, aided and abetted by students and colleagues, not\njust Tarski but also Adolf Lindenbaum, Jerzy Słupecki,\nBolesław Sobociński, Mordechaj Wajsberg and others,\ninvestigated not only the full (functionally complete) propositional\ncalculus, with different sets of connectives as basic, including the\nSheffer functor D, but also partial calculi, in particular the\npure implicational calculus (based on C alone) and the pure\nequivalential calculus (based on E alone). They strove to find\naxioms sets satisfying a number of normative criteria: axioms should be\nas few as possible, as short as possible, independent, with as few\nprimitives as possible. Undoubtedly there was a competitive element to\nthe search for ever better axiom systems, in particular in the attempt\nto find single axioms for various systems, and the exercise has been\nsmiled upon or even belittled as a mere “sport”, but the\nPolish preoccupation with improving axiom systems was a search for\nlogical perfection, an illustration of what Jan Woleński has\ntermed “logic for logic's sake”. At one time it was\nthought, not without some justification, that only Poles could compete.\nWhen Tarski once congratulated the American logician Emil Post on being\nthe only non-Pole to make fundamental contributions to propositional\nlogic, Post replied that he had been born in Augustów and his\nmother came from Białystok. Later, Łukasiewicz was to find in\nthe Irish mathematician Carew Meredith a worthy non-Pole who could\noutdo even the Poles in the brevity of his axioms. \n\nŁukasiewicz used many-valued matrices to establish the\nindependence of logical axioms in systems of Frege, Russell and others.\nHe proved the completeness of full, implicational and equivalential\ncalculi, and proved that the equivalential calculus could be based on\nthe single axiom \\(EEpqErqEpr\\), with substitution and detachment\nfor equivalence, and showed further that no shorter axiom could be the\nsole axiom of the system. Tarski showed in 1925 that the pure\nimplicational calculus could be based on a single axiom, but a series\nof improvements by Wajsberg and Łukasiewicz led to the\nlatter's discovering in 1936 that the formula\n\\(CCCpqrCCrpCsp\\) could serve as single axiom and that no shorter\naxiom would suffice, though the publication of this result had to wait\nuntil 1948. \n\nStandard propositional calculus employs neither quantifiers nor\nvariable functors, that is, functors of one or more places taking\npropositional arguments, but which unlike such constant functors as\n\\(N\\) or \\(C\\) do not have a fixed meaning. Such variable functors act\nlike the predicates of first-order predicate logic except for taking\npropositional rather than nominal arguments. They thus add to the\nexpressive power of the logic. Leśniewski added both quantifiers\nand bound propositional and functorial variables to propositional\nlogic, and called the resulting theory\nprotothetic. Leaving prefixed universal quantifiers tacit, it\nis a thesis of protothetic that \n\nwhere \\(\\delta\\) is a one-place propositional functor, out of the\nsame syntactic stable as negation or necessity. This thesis is an\nexpression of the law of extensionality for propositional expressions.\nIf \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are replaced by complex expressions\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) the thesis can be used to enable definitions\nto be given in the implicational form\n\\(C\\delta x\\delta y\\). \n\nIf \\(\\delta\\) is replaced by the first part of a complex\nexpression, e.g., \\(Cq\\) or \\(CCq0\\), then simply adjoining\na variable such as \\(p\\) to give \\(Cqp\\),\n\\(CCq0p\\), is straightforward. But if the\n“gap” where the variable is to go is not at the end, such\nas \\(Cpq\\), or if the variable is to be inserted more than once,\nas \\(CCp0p\\), this simple replacement procedure will not\nwork. Leśniewski got around the problem by introducing auxiliary\ndefinitions which maneuvered the required variable slot into the right\nposition with only one occurrence. But Łukasiewicz found this\nprocedure unintuitive and wasteful. His preference—which in fact\nechoes the practice of Frege—was to allow any context in which a\nsingle propositional variable is free to serve as a substituend for a\nfunctor like \\(\\delta\\), and mark the places into which the\nargument of \\(\\delta\\) was to be slotted with an apostrophe, so\nin our examples \\(C \\apos q\\),\n\\(CC\\apos 0 \\apos\\). This more liberal “substitution with\napostrophe” allows definitions to be given a satisfyingly simple\nimplicational form. For example, in propositional calculus based on\nimplication and the propositional constant 0, negation can be defined\nsimply by\n\\(C\\delta Np\\delta Cp0\\).\nThe use of variable functors with liberal substitution enables a\nnumber of principles of propositional logic to be given startlingly\ncompressed and elegant formulations, for example the principle of\nbivalence in the form \n\nwhich can be read as “if something is true of a false\nproposition then if it true of a true proposition, it is true of any\nproposition” (C00 is a true proposition). The supreme\nachievements of compression using variable functors were made by\nMeredith, who showed that the whole of classical propositional logic\nwith variable functors can be based on the single axiom \n\nMore astonishingly, in 1951 Meredith showed that the whole of\nbivalent propositional calculus with quantifiers and variable functors\ncan be deduced, using substitution, detachment and quantifier rules,\nfrom the single axiomatic formula  \n\nŁukasiewicz admiringly described this feat as “a\nmasterpiece of the art of deduction”. \n\nŁukasiewicz was interested in intuitionistic logic, not least\nbecause, like his own, it rejected the law of excluded middle. In a\nlate article published in 1952, he gave an elegant axiomatization with\nten axioms, using the letters \\(F\\), \\(T\\) and \\(O\\)\nfor the intuitionist connectives of implication, conjunction and\ndisjunction respectively, in order to obviate clashes caused by\n“competition” for the connectives, though interestingly he\nkept the usual negation for both systems. He then showed how to define\nclassical implication as \\(NTpNq\\), formulated this definition\nusing a variable functor as the implication \n\nand proved that in this version classical bivalent logic based on\n\\(C\\) and \\(N\\) is contained in intuitionistic logic,\nprovided that detachment is confined to \\(C\\)-\\(N\\)\nformulas only. Classical conjunction and disjunction can be defined in\nthe usual way as \\(NCpNq\\) and \\(CNpq\\) respectively. By\ndifferentiating intuitionistic from classical connectives his\nperspective reverses the usual one that intuitionistic propositional\ncalculus is poorer in theorems than classical: in Łukasiewicz's\nformulation it is the other way around. \n\nŁukasiewicz's most celebrated achievement was his development of\nmany-valued logics. This revolutionary development came in the context\nof discussing modality, in particular possibility. To modern\nlogicians, used to the idea of modal logic being grafted onto\nclassical bivalent logic, this may seem odd. But let us consider how\nŁukasiewicz arrived at the idea. If \\(p\\) be any\nproposition, let \\(Lp\\) notate that it is necessary that\n\\(p\\) and \\(Mp\\) that it is possible that \\(p\\). The\ntwo modal operators are connected by the usual equivalence\n\\(ENLpMNp\\). Everyone accepts the implications \\(CLpp\\) and\n\\(CpMp\\). Łukasiewicz supposes one accepts also the converse\nimplications \\(CpLp\\) and \\(CMpp\\), as one would from a\ndeterministic point of view. That gives the equivalences \\(EpLp\\)\nand \\(EpMp\\), which effectively collapse modal distinctions. Now\nadd in the idea that possibility is two-sided: if something is\npossible, then so is its negation: \\(EMpMNp\\). From these it\nimmediately follows that \\(EpNp\\), and this is paradoxical in\ntwo-valued logic. The way out, as Łukasiewicz portrays it, is to\nuncollapse the modal distinctions, not by rejecting any of the\nprinciples above but by finding a case where \\(EpNp\\) is\ntrue. We entertain the idea of the proposition \\(Mp\\)\nbeing true when \\(p\\) is neither true nor false. In addition to\nthe truth-values true (1) and false\n(0), allow then a third value, possible, which we\nwrite ‘\\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\)’, so that when \\(p\\) is neither true\nnor false, it is possible, and so is its negation \\(Np\\), for if\n\\(Np\\) were true, \\(p\\) would be false, and vice versa. If\n\\(Epq\\) is true when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same\ntruth-value, then when \\(p\\) is possible (we write \n‘\\(\\tval{p}\\)’ for the \ntruth-value of \\(p\\), so \n\\(\\tval{p}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\)) we\nhave  \n\nThis is, with minor changes, the way in which Łukasiewicz\nintroduces the third value in his first published paper on the\nsubject, which bears the title “On the Concept of\nPossibility”. This short paper is based on a talk given on 5\nJune 1920 in Lwów. Two weeks later a second talk in the same\nplace was more transparently titled “On Three-Valued\nLogic”. In this, Łukasiewicz sets out principles governing\nimplication and equivalence involving the third value. These in effect\n determine the\n truth-tables[2]\n for these connectives: \n\nTogether with the assumed definitions of negation, conjunction\nand disjunction as, respectively \n\nthis yields truth-tables for these connectives as \n\nŁukasiewicz proudly declares “that three-valued logic has,\nabove all, theoretical significance as the first attempt to create a\nnon-Aristotelian logic” (PL, 18; SW, 88). What\nits practical significance is, he thinks awaits to be seen, and for\nthis we need “to compare with experience the consequences of the\nindeterministic view which is the metaphysical basis of the new\nlogic” (ibid.). \n\nThis final remark reveals the motivation of Łukasiewicz's\ndrive to replace the old bivalent logic with the new trivalent one. It\nwas in order to defend indeterminism and freedom. In fact the idea had\ncome to fruition some three years earlier. Having been appointed to an\nadministrative position in the Ministry of Education in 1918, and being\nabout to leave academic life for an indefinite period, Łukasiewicz\ndelivered a “farewell lecture” to the University of Warsaw\non 17 March, in which he announced dramatically, “I have declared\na spiritual war upon all coercion that restricts man's free\ncreative activity.” The logical form of this coercion, in\nŁukasiewicz's view, was Aristotelian logic, which restricted\npropositions to true or false. His own weapon in this war was\nthree-valued logic. Recalling his 1910 monograph, he notes that: \n\nBecause Łukasiewicz was involved in government until the end of\n1919, it took until 1920 for his discoveries of 1917 to be revealed to\na wider academic public. Łukasiewicz returned to the subject of\ndeterminism for his inaugural lecture as Rector of the University of\nWarsaw on 16 October 1922. That lecture, delivered without notes but\nlater written down, was reworked, though not in essentials, up until\n1946. It was published only posthumously in 1961 as “On\nDeterminism”. Distinguishing logical from causal determinism,\nŁukasiewicz claims that if a prediction of a future contingent\nevent such as an action is true at the time the prediction is made, the\nevent must occur, so the only way to rescue the agent's freedom\nof action is to deny that the prediction is true, and assign it instead\nthe third truth-value of possibility. \n\nHere is not the place to go into the problems with\nŁukasiewicz's argumentation. Suffice it to say that the\nprinciple EpLp need not be accepted by determinists, and that\nother logicians who have considered adding a third value to logic, such\nas (unbeknown to Łukasiewicz) William of Ockham, concluded that\nthere was no reason to reject bivalence while upholding freedom. This\nis without even considering compatibilist views. \n\nOnce the spell of bivalence was broken, a natural next step was to\nconsider logic with more than three values. In 1922 Łukasiewicz\nindicated how to give truth-tables for the standard connectives in\nsystems with finitely or infinitely many truth values, according to the\nfollowing principles, where the truth-values are numbers in the\ninterval [0,1]: \n\nIn proposing logics with infinitely many values, Łukasiewicz\nwas thus the inventor of what was much later (43 years later, to be\nexact) to be called ‘fuzzy logic’. Commenting on these\nsystems in 1930, Łukasiewicz wrote \n\nWe will discuss this philosophical attitude below. \n\nOnce the truth-tabular or matrix approach to many-valued logics was\nestablished, it was natural to consider their axiomatization.\nŁukasiewicz's students assisted in this. In 1931 Wajsberg\naxiomatized the three-valued system Ł\\(_3\\)\nby the theses \n\nWajsberg also proved a conjecture of Łukasiewicz that the\ndenumerably infinite-valued system \nŁ\\(_{\\aleph_0}\\) can be axiomatized by \n\nNone of these systems is functionally complete: there are\nconnectives not definable on the basis of C and N\nalone. Among those that are definable is possibility M: as\nearly as 1921 Tarski showed that it could be defined as CNpp.\nIn 1936 Słupecki showed that by adding a functor \\(T\\) \nspecifiable as \\(\\tval{Tp} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\) for all values of p,\nall connectives can be defined in Ł3. To axiomatize\nthese functionally complete system the formulas \n\nhave to be added to Wajsberg's axioms. \n\nAdolf Lindenbaum showed that Ł\\(_n\\)  is contained\nin Ł\\(_m\\) \\((n \\lt m)\\) if and only\nif \\(n - 1\\) is a divisor of \\(m - 1\\), so if\nneither divides the other their respective tautologies properly overlap\nbut neither set is contained in the other. Tautologies of the\ninfinite-valued system Ł\\(_{\\aleph_0}\\) are contained in those\nof all the finite-valued systems. \n\nFrom 1917, Łukasiewicz had been happy with the three-valued logic\nas formulating adequate notions of modality, with the noted preference\nfor the infinite-valued system as optimally precise. At some time,\nprobably around 1951–52, when he was working on Aristotle's\nmodal logic, Łukasiewicz changed his mind. There are a number of\nreasons behind the change of mind but the easiest to identify is\nŁukasiewicz's concern that in Ł\\(_3\\) there are\ntheorems of the form \\(L\\alpha\\), for example\n\\(LCpp\\). Why should this be a concern, given that most\n“standard” modal logics recognize the principle that if\n\\(\\alpha\\) is a theorem, so is \\(L\\alpha\\)?\nŁukasiewicz gives two examples to justify the worry. If \\({=}ab\\)\nis the proposition that \\(a\\) is identical with \\(b\\),\nthen basing identity on the two axioms of self-identity and\nextensionality \n\nthen instantiating \\(L{=}a\\apos\\) for \\(\\phi\\)\ngives \n\nand if we accept \\(L{=}aa\\) we are forced to conclude that \\(L{=}ab\\),\nwhich Łukasiewicz thinks is false (SW 392, AS\n171), citing Quine's (1953) example (now outdated because the number\nhas changed) that while it's true that 9 = the number of planets, this\nis not necessarily true, although necessarily 9 = 9. Dually, we\nhave \n\nthat is, if \\(MN{=}ab\\) then \\(N{=}ab\\). But\nsuppose a is replaced by “the number thrown on this\nthrow of this die” and b by “the number thrown on\nthe next throw of this die” the antecedent can be true and the\nconsequent false. \n\nIn the wake of much subsequent discussion of such examples by Quine,\nKripke and others, these examples are hardly convincing, but there is\nanother more general reason why Łukasiewicz rejects necessities as\ntheorems:  Since \\(LCpp\\) is a theorem of all the systems of many-valued logic\nto date, Łukasiewicz needed to come up with something new.  This\nhe did in his 1953 paper “A System of Modal Logic”. \n\nŁukasiewicz begins the paper by laying out the conditions that a\nmodal logic needs to satisfy. These include axiomatic rejections as\nwell as assertions, as follows: \n\nTo obtain a system of modal logic respecting extensionality for\npropositional functors, Łukasiewicz takes Meredith's axiom\nfor \\(C\\)-\\(N\\)-\\(\\delta\\) propositional calculus \n\nand adds one more axiomatic assertion and two axiomatic\nrejections \n\ntogether with rules of substitution and detachment for both\nassertion and rejection, to obtain his logic. The principles for\nassertion are as usual, while those for rejection are:  \n\\(\\dashv\\) Substitution: Any formula which has a rejected\nsubstitution instance is rejected. \n\\(\\dashv\\) Detachment: If \\(Cab\\) is asserted and \\(b\\) is rejected then \\(a\\)\nis rejected.\n \n\nFrom these he can derive all the desired principles and\nextensionality. \n\nThis is the logic Ł. Unlike standard modal logics, it has a finite\ncharacteristic matrix, as follows, where like Łukasiewicz we now\nreplace ‘\\(M\\)’ by a new symbol\n‘\\(\\Delta\\)’, with 1 as the designated (true) value and 4\nthe antidesignated (false) value: \n\nThe matrix was proved characteristic by Smiley in 1961. Functors of\nnecessity (\\(\\Gamma\\)) and conjunction are definable in the standard\nway. More intriguingly, Łukasiewicz notes that there is another\npossibility operator \\(\\nabla\\)\nwith the truth-table also\ngiven below: \n\nTaken in isolation, this is indistinguishable from \\(\\Delta\\), \nbut\nthe two operators together interact differently, for while\n\\(\\dashv \\Delta\\Delta p\\) and\n\\(\\dashv \\nabla\\nabla p\\), both\n\\(\\vdash \\Delta\\nabla p\\) and\n\\(\\vdash \\nabla\\Delta p\\).  Łukasiewicz compares\nthem to twins which are indistinguishable separately but\ndistinguishable together. Similar twins are the necessity operator\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and its counterpart (with values 3434), and indeed the two intermediate truth-values 2\nand 3. \n\nThe logic is very unlike Łukasiewicz's earlier multivalent\nsystems and also very unlike other modal systems. It is unlike his own\nsystems in that it is an extension of classical bivalent logic and\nincludes all bivalent tautologies. This is less surprising when we\nnote that the four-valued matrices for the standard connectives are\nsimply the Cartesian product of the standard bivalent matrices with\nthemselves. It is the modal operators that make the\ndifference. Several features make this very unlike standard modal\nsystems. One is the complete lack of any truths, let alone theorems,\nof the form \\(\\Gamma a\\), in line with Łukasiewicz's rejection of\ntruths of “higher dignity”. Other odd theorems are: \n\\(\\vdash CK{\\Delta}p{\\Delta}q{\\Delta}Kpq\\)\n \nall possible propositions are compossible\n \n\\(\\vdash CEpqC{\\Delta}p{\\Delta}q\\)\n \nmaterially equivalent propositions are both possible if one is\n \n\\(\\vdash C{\\Delta}pC{\\Delta}Np{\\Delta}q\\)\n \nif a proposition and its negation are both possible, anything is\n  \n\nŁukasiewicz was aware of many of these odd consequences, but\ncontinued to uphold his system. Despite a number of attempts to make\nsense of the system, it has generally been concluded that because of\nthese oddities it is not really a system of modal logic. If there is\none dominant reason for this it is Łukasiewicz's adherence to the\nprinciple of extensionality (truth-functionality) even for modal\noperators, which forced his account of modality to go multivalent in\nthe first place.  \n\nŁukasiewicz's third signal achievement, along with his\ninvestigations of many-valued and propositional logics, is his work in\nthe history of logic. Indeed he can reasonably be considered the\nfather of the modern way of doing the history of logic, which is\npursued, to quote the subtitle of his book on Aristotle's syllogistic,\n“from the standpoint of modern formal logic.” We saw that\nhis early book on the principle of contradiction in Aristotle was\nrelatively unsuccessful in its own terms, though it demonstrated his\nability to go to the heart of the ancient Greek texts.  \n\nA decisive event in Łukasiewicz's development as an historian\nof logic was his discovery of ancient Stoic logic. It seems he was\nexamining a dissertation on the Stoics and to prepare for it he read\noriginal texts. He thereupon discovered that Stoic logic, contrary to\nthe then standard opinion, voiced by Prantl, Zeller and others, was\nnot a bowdlerized and defective Aristotelian syllogistic, but an early\npropositional logic, so that for example the first Stoic\nindemonstrable, “if the first, then the second; but the first,\ntherefore the second” is simply modus ponens or detachment for\nthe conditional ‘if’, and the variables, represented not\nby letters but by ordinal numerals, are propositional variables, not\nterm variables. He first voiced this view, which is now of course\nstandard, at a meeting in Lwów in 1923. A more systematic\ntreatment of 1934, “On the History of the Logic of\nPropositions”, is a delightful vignette taking in the broad\nsweep from the Stoics, ancient disputes about the meaning of the\nconditional, Petrus Hispanus and Ockham on the De Morgan laws, the\nmedieval theory of consequences, and culminating with Frege and modern\npropositional calculi. Modern appreciation of the achievements of\nStoic logic dates from Łukasiewicz's clarification and his\nunstinting praise of the Stoics, especially\nChrysippus. Łukasiewicz appreciated that Prantl did not have the\nbenefit of knowing post-Fregean logic, and despite Prantl's erroneous\ndismissal of the “stupidity” of much Stoic logic did at\nleast provide helpful sources. Nevertheless, Łukasiewicz's\njudgement on past historians of logic is scathing: \n\nIn Łukasiewicz's logic textbook of 1929, after treating\npropositional calculus he does not go on, as one would nowadays, to\nexpound predicate logic, but gives a brief formal account of\nAristotle's categorical (non-modal) syllogistic, presupposing\ntwelve theorems of propositional calculus. This foreshadowed his 1951\nbook, Aristotle's Syllogistic, by 22 years. This book,\nwhich revolutionized the study of Aristotle's logic, had a long\nand interrupted genesis. A talk on the subject given at Kraków\nin 1939 was published in Polish only in 1946. In 1939 Łukasiewicz\nprepared a Polish monograph, but the partial proofs and manuscript were\ndestroyed in the bombing of Warsaw. In 1949 he was invited to lecture\non Aristotle's syllogistic at University College Dublin, and\nthose lectures formed the basis of the book, completed in 1950 and\npublished the following year, his first in English. The first edition\ndealt only with categorical syllogistic. For the second edition,\ncompleted in 1955, less than a year before his death, Łukasiewicz\nadded three chapters on the modal syllogistic, employing the modal\nlogic Ł that he had developed in the meantime. The second edition\nwas proof-read and indexed by Lejewski, and appeared in 1957. \n\nŁukasiewicz's understanding of Aristotle's syllogistic is based\non two specific interpretative principles and a general attitude. The\nfirst principle is that Aristotle's syllogisms are not, as had\ntraditionally been supposed, inference schemata, of the form\n‘p, q, therefore\nr’, but conditional propositions of the form ‘if\np and q, then r’. This leads\ndirectly into the second principle, which is that there is behind the\nsyllogistic treatment of term logic a deeper logic, that of\npropositions, and in particular a logic of opposition,\n‘and’ and ‘if’, as well as (in modal\nsyllogistic) ‘necessarily’ and\n‘possibly’. Łukasiewicz takes this propositional basis to be occasionally\ninvoked by Aristotle, for instance in the treatment of indirect\nproofs, but for the most part left as tacit, and he therefore regards it as\nlegitimate to criticise Aristotle (unlike the Stoics) for not\nexplicitly formulating the underlying propositional\nlogic. Łukasiewicz's trenchant and controversial views sparked a\ncontroversy over how to interpret the syllogistic. While the\nprinciples did win an early adherent in Patzig (1968), subsequent\ncriticisms by Corcoran (1972, 1974) and, independently, Smiley (1974)\nestablished clearly that syllogisms are not propositions but\ninferences, and that Aristotle had no need of a prior logic of\npropositions. That view is now universal among scholars of Aristotle's\nlogic. In retrospect, it appears that Łukasiewicz was keen to\nwish onto Aristotle his own (Fregean) view of logic as a system of\ntheorems based on a propositional logic. \n\nThe general attitude, present throughout Łukasiewicz's treatment,\nis that Aristotle's work is of sufficient precision and stature to\nwarrant and withstand exposition using the most rigorous modern\nlogical methods and concepts.  In other words, the development of\nmodern logic, while it may highlight lacunae and deficits of\nAristotle's logic, in fact brings out its merits, innovations and\ngenius more clearly than previous traditional or philological\nstudies. Łukasiewicz's attitude has prevailed and is now\npervasive among those studying Aristotle's logic, whether or not they\nagree with his specific interpretative principles.  \n\nAfter an exposition of the basics of Aristotle's treatment of\nsyllogistic, in which he criticises earlier commentators and notes that\nAristotle originated the method of rejected forms in order to show not\njust which are the valid syllogisms but also to prove the invalid forms\nto be such, Łukasiewicz presents his formalization of categorical\nsyllogistic, based on the following logical expressions \n\nTaking \\(A\\) and \\(I\\) as primitive and defining\n\\(E = NI\\) and \\(O = NA\\), the axioms,\nadded to propositional calculus, are \n\ntogether with modus ponens and a substitution rule for term\nvariables. This in fact was the system that Łukasiewicz had put\nforward in his 1929 textbook. As the second axiom indicates,\nŁukasiewicz is here following Aristotle in assuming that all terms\ndenote. Rejected forms can be added: Łukasiewicz gives from the\nsecond figure \n\nwhich together with detachment and substitution for rejection\ndeliver all Aristotle's 232 rejected moods.\nŁukasiewicz's verdict on Aristotle's categorical\nsyllogistic is, that despite its narrowness, it is “a system the\nexactness of which surpasses even the exactness of a mathematical\ntheory, and this is its everlasting merit.” (AS,\n131) \n\nThe modal syllogistic on the other hand is little studied, according\nto Łukasiewicz, both because it falls well below the standards of\nperfection of the categorical, and for lack of a “universally\nacceptable system of modal logic”, which Łukasiewicz takes\nhimself, with Ł, now to have provided. Łukasiewicz's own\ntreatment falls short of being definitive, though it provides material\nfor later studies, and we shall not pursue it here.  Interestingly, in\nAristotle's attempts in Book I, Chapter 15 of the Prior\nAnalytics, to establish the theses \n\nŁukasiewicz sees an Aristotelian endorsement for the idea of a\nprinciple of extensionality for modal operators as well as for\ncategorical ones. \n\nIn his early philosophy, the most significant and influential position\nadopted by Łukasiewicz is his anti-psychologism in logic.  This\nwas influenced by Frege, Husserl and Russell. It manifested itself\nterminologically in Łukasiewicz's replacement of the traditional\nterm sąd (judgement), used by Twardowski, by the term\nzdanie (sentence). This change of perspective and terminology\nwas adopted by subsequent Polish logicians en masse. After\n1920, Łukasiewicz is very sparing in his statements regarding\nphilosophy and philosophical problems. His abiding commitment to\nindeterminism we have noted. His main comments and indeed ire are\nreserved for those who criticise the place of mathematical logic (or\nlogistic, as it was then known) in philosophy and thought in\ngeneral. He noted certain convergences in method and style between the\nLwów–Warsaw School and the Vienna Circle, but criticised\nthe latter for their conventionalism and rejection of all metaphysics\nand for their attempt to turn substantive problems into linguistic\nones. Despite its abstractness, logic is no more detached from reality\nthan any other science, and it is constrained to conform to aspects of\nthe world. It was his conviction that determinism was false that drove\nhis rejection of bivalent logic. While maintaining the metaphysical\nneutrality of logic, he admitted later in the 1930s that whereas he\nhad earlier been a nominalist, he was now a platonist. The source of\nthis conviction is stated at the end of his 1937 polemic “In\ndefence of logistic”: \n\nRarely has the motivation for platonism been so eloquently stated.  \n\nIn the philosophy of logic, one of Łukasiewicz's most\ndeep-seated convictions, one that he shared with the other logicians\nof the Warsaw School, was that logic has to be extensional, that it is\nthe study of the calculi not of linguistic meanings or psychological\njudgements but of the truth-values, whether just the classical two or\nmore besides. His view is that sentences denote truth-values, and that\nlogic is the science of such logical values, not of sentences (which\nis grammar) or of judgements (which is psychology), or of contents\nexpressed by propositions, or of objects in general (ontology). He\ndoes not justify this position, but simply accepts and assumes it. As\nwe saw, it has far-reaching consequences for his treatment of modal\nlogic, forcing it to be many-valued. \n\nIn addition to the general attitude to scientific philosophizing that\nhe derived from Twardowski, there is one identifiable source of some\nother of Łukasiewicz's philosophical stances regarding logic, or\nif not a source, at least a point of convergent convictions.  One is\nthe rejection of a “supertruth” above ordinary truth. This\ncomes out especially clearly in the modal logic Ł. The other is\nhis liking for degrees of possibility intermediate between truth (1)\nand falsity (0), by contrast with the non-quantitative third case of\npossibility (or in Ł twin third cases). An exactly similar\ndistinction between two kinds of possibility,\n“unincreasable”, without degrees, and\n“increasable”, with infinite degrees, can be found in\nMeinong's massive 1915 treatise Über Möglichkeit und\nWahrscheinlichkeit. Like Łukasiewicz, Meinong does not\naccord propositions a dignity of necessity higher than truth, and\ndespite having the most ample ontology known to philosophy, Meinong's\nobject theory lacks objects described as necessary: he never mentions\nGod, and ideal objects such as numbers are taken by him to subsist,\nnot to exist or subsist necessarily. It is perhaps not incidental that\non returning to Lwów after his visit to Graz, Łukasiewicz\nspoke in 1910 about the law of excluded middle, concluding that like\nthe principle of contradiction it is not fundamental, and has\npractical rather than logical significance. He conjectured that it\nfailed for general objects like the triangle in general, which is\nneither equilateral nor not equilateral. Meinong accepted such\nobjects, which he called “incomplete”, and had in fact\nadopted the idea from Łukasiewicz's teacher\nTwardowski. Łukasiewicz also regarded the application of the\nprinciple to real objects as “connected with the universal\ndeterminism of phenomena, not only present and past ones but also\nfuture ones. Were someone to deny that all future phenomena are today\nalready predetermined in all respects, he would probably not be able\nto accept the principle in question.” The seeds of three-valued\nlogic were already germinating in 1910, after the visit to Graz. \n\nMeinong employed the many values of increasable possibility to give an\naccount of probability. While Łukasiewicz's procedure in his 1913\nmonograph was based on a different idea, he continued to be pulled\ntowards the idea that infinite-valued logic might be able to shed\nlight on probability. At the very latest by 1935, with the publication\nof a short article on probability and many-valued logic by Tarski, he\nknew that the most straightforward approach, that of identifying\nprobabilities with truth-values between 0 and 1, would not work. The\nreason is that because of probabilistic dependence, probability is not\nextensional: if \\(p\\) is the proposition that it will rain in\nDublin tomorrow and \\(Np\\) is its negation, the probability of\nthe contradictory conjunction \\(KpNp\\) is 0, but if \\(p\\)\nhas degree of truth \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\), so does \\(Np\\), and so \n\\(\\tval{KpNp} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\) \nin both Ł\\(_3\\) and Ł\\(_{\\aleph_0}\\).\nDespite this, as late as 1955 Łukasiewicz could still muse, \n\nŁukasiewicz once declared somewhat immodestly that the discovery\nof many-valued logics was comparable to that of non-Euclidean\ngeometries (SW 176). Whatever their significance,\nŁukasiewicz's hopes for such logics have not been realized in the\nway he anticipated. The semantics and pure mathematics of multivalued\nlogics have flourished, leading to the development of MV-algebras in\nuse for the algebraic semantics of Łukasiewicz's\nlogics. Infinite-valued or fuzzy logic has its own mathematics, and\nprominent among its developers is the Czech mathematical logician Petr\nHájek, whose work is influenced by that of\nŁukasiewicz. Fuzzy logic is found in many practical applications,\nwhere it is used to deal with vagueness, inexactness, or lack of\nknowledge, whether these are the same or different. But\nŁukasiewicz's championing of multivalence in the analysis of\nmodality has been almost universally rejected, and the logic of\nmodality has inexorably followed other paths, mostly bivalent,\nnon-extensional ones. His final logic Ł has resisted consensual\ninterpretation, and is regarded as at best an oddity and at worst a\ndead end.  \n\nThe outstanding work that Łukasiewicz and his students\naccomplished in the logic and metalogic of propositional calculus, the\nPolish speciality of ever-shorter axioms and so on, now belongs to the\nbygone heroic age of logistic. Its results have indeed only been\nbettered occasionally by automated theorem-provers. On the other hand\nthe emphasis on logical semantics, Łukasiewicz's abundant use of\ntruth-values notwithstanding, has shifted interest away from axiomatic\nvirtuosity.  \n\nIn the history of logic, Łukasiewicz's pioneering studies\nopened up a new and more fruitful interaction between the past and the\npresent, and the rediscovery and new appreciation of figures from\nlogic's past “in the light of modern formal logic” has\ncontinued to this day, though not all of Łukasiewicz's own views\non how to approach Aristotle or the Stoics have stood the test of\ntime. His work also helped to inspire those historians of logic from\nthe Catholic tradition in Kraków, most notably Jan Salamucha\nand Józef Bocheński, who applied modern methods to the\ninvestigation of logical problems and arguments from the history of\nphilosophy.  \n\nDuring the heyday of the Warsaw School, 1920–1939,\nŁukasiewicz played a key role in educating the next generation of\nlogical researchers and inspiring them with methods, results and\nproblems. Even ideas he tossed off as exercises have changed logic,\nfor example a 1929 suggestion to formalize the informal procedure of\nproof from assumptions led to Stanisław Jaśkowski's 1934\nsystem of natural deduction, in essentials the way logic is mainly\ntaught to students today. The war irrevocably interrupted their work.\nSeveral of Łukasiewicz's best students were Jewish, and were\nkilled in Nazi death camps. In his exile from Poland after 1944,\nŁukasiewicz had scant opportunity to continue this pedagogical\nwork, holding a research position in a non-teaching institution in a\ncountry with no logical tradition. His interactions with\ncontemporaries were much more sparse, and those chiefly through\ncorrespondence. The one notable logician who interacted with\nŁukasiewicz at this time and whose work intersects with his in\nboth interests (time, modality, many-valuedness) and attitudes (the\nimportance of logic for philosophy) is Arthur Prior, who was the only\nmajor logician to adopt Polish notation, and who also expended more\neffort than anyone in the attempt to find a plausible interpretation\nfor the system Ł. It is also fair to say that of the major\nfigures among the Warsaw logicians, Łukasiewicz has received the\nleast attention from commentators and historians. There are relatively\nfewer monographs and papers on Łukasiewicz than on other major\nfigures of the Lwów–Warsaw School. \n\nDespite such disappointments, Łukasiewicz's achievements and\ninventions ensure him a permanent and honorable place in the history of\nmathematical and philosophical logic. Łukasiewicz was justly proud\nof the prominence achieved by Polish logicians between the wars, and\nfully deserves his commemoration by one of Adam Myjak's four\nstatues of prominent Lwów–Warsaw School members at the\nentrance to Warsaw University Library.","contact.mail":"psimons@tcd.ie","contact.domain":"tcd.ie"}]
