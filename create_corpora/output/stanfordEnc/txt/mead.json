Dewey referred to Mead as “a seminal mind\nof the very first order” (Dewey, 1932, xl). Yet by the middle of\nthe twentieth-century, Mead's prestige was greatest outside of\nprofessional philosophical circles. He is considered by many to be the\nfather of the school of Symbolic Interactionism in sociology and\nsocial psychology, although he did not use this nomenclature. Perhaps\nMead's principal influence in philosophical circles occurred as a\nresult of his friendship with John Dewey. There is little question\nthat Mead and Dewey had an enduring influence on each other, with Mead\ncontributing an original theory of the development of the self through\ncommunication. This theory has in recent years played a central role\nin the work of Jürgen Habermas. While Mead is best known for his\nwork on the nature of the self and intersubjectivity, he also\ndeveloped a theory of action, and a metaphysics or philosophy of\nnature that emphasizes emergence and temporality, in which the past\nand future are viewed through the lens of the present. Although the\nextent of Mead's reach is considerable, he never published a\nmonograph. His most famous work, Mind, Self, and Society: From the\nStandpoint of a Social Behaviorist, was published after his death\nand is a compilation of student notes and selections from unpublished\nmanuscripts.\n\n\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead was born on February 27, 1863, in South Hadley,\nMassachusetts. His father, Hiram Mead, a minister in the\nCongregational Church, moved his family from Massachusetts to Ohio in\n1869 in order to join the faculty of The Oberlin Theological\nSeminary. At Oberlin he taught homiletics and held the chair in Sacred\nRhetoric and Pastoral Theology. Mead would attend Oberlin College from\n1879–1883, and matriculate at Harvard from 1887–1888. At Harvard he\nstudied with Josiah Royce, a philosopher deeply indebted to\nG.W.F. Hegel, who also left a lasting impression on Mead. (Mead met\nWilliam James at Harvard, although he did not study with him. Almost\nimmediately after graduation, Mead resided in William James's summer\nhome tutoring his son Harry.)  Mead's mother, Elizabeth Storrs\nBillings, was a devoutly religious woman, who taught at Oberlin for\ntwo years after the death of her husband in 1881, and served as\npresident of Mount Holyoke College from 1890–1900. After his college\nyears, Mead became a committed naturalist and non-believer, but he had\nstruggled for years with the religious convictions that he had\ninherited from his family and community. For a period of time after\ncollege he even considered Christian Social Work as a career, but 1884\nhe explained in a letter to his friend Henry Castle why this career\npath would be problematic. \n\nMead did indeed move away from his earlier religious roots, but the\nactivist spirit remained with him. Mead marched in support of\nwomen's suffrage, served as a treasurer for the Settlement House\nmovement, immersed himself in civic matters in Chicago, and generally\nsupported progressive causes. Jane Addams was a close\nfriend. In terms of his transformation into a naturalist,\nno doubt Darwin played a significant role. As a matter of fact,\none can understand much of Mead's work as an attempt to\nsynthesize Darwin, Hegel, Dewey's functionalist turn in\npsychology, and insights gleaned from James. Mead taught with Dewey at\nthe University of Michigan from 1891–1894, and when Dewey was made\nchair at the University of Chicago in 1894, he requested that Mead\nreceive an appointment. Mead spent the rest of his career at\nChicago. But before he began teaching at Michigan, Mead was\ndirectly exposed to major currents of European thought when he studied\nin Germany from 1888–1891, taking a course from Wilhelm Dilthey and\nimmersing himself in Wilhelm Wundt's research. \n\nDewey and Mead were not only very close friends, they shared similar\nintellectual trajectories. Both went through a period in\nwhich Hegel was the most significant philosophical figure for them, and\nboth democratized and de-essentialized Hegelian ideas about the self\nand community. Nevertheless, neo-hegelian organic metaphors and\nnotions of negation and conflict, reinterpreted as the problematic\nsituation, remain central to their positions. The teleological\nalso remains important in their thought, but it is reduced in scale\nfrom the world historical and localized in terms of anticipatory\nexperiences and goal oriented activities. \n\nFor Mead, the development of the self is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of language. To demonstrate this connection, Mead\nbegins by articulating what he learned about the gesture from\nWundt. Gestures are to be understood in terms of the\nbehavioral responses of animals to stimuli from other organisms.\nFor example, a dog barks, and a second dog either barks back or runs\naway. The “meaning” of the “barking\ngesture” is found in the response of the second organism to the\nfirst. But dogs do not understand the “meaning” of\ntheir gestures. They simply respond, that is, they use symbols\nwithout what Mead refers to as “significance.” For a\ngesture to have significance, it must call out in a second organism a\nresponse that is functionally identical to the response that the first\norganism anticipates. In other words, for a gesture to be\nsignificant it must “mean” the same thing to both\norganisms, and “meaning” involves the capacity to\nconsciously anticipate how other organisms will respond to symbols or\ngestures. How does this capacity arise? It does so through\nthe vocal gesture. \n\nA vocal gesture can be thought of as a word or phrase. When a\nvocal gesture is used the individual making the gesture responds\n(implicitly) in the same manner as the individual hearing it. If\nyou are about to walk across a busy street during rush hour, I might\nshout out, “Don't walk!” As I shout, I hear my\ngesture the way in which you hear it, that is, I hear the same words,\nand I might feel myself pulling back, stopping in my tracks because I\nhear these words. But, of course, I don't hear them exactly\nas you do, because I am aware of directing them to you. According\nto Mead, “Gestures become significant symbols when they\nimplicitly arouse in the individual making them the same responses\nwhich the explicitly arouse, or are supposed to arouse, in other\nindividuals” (MSS, 47). He also tells us that, “the\ncritical importance of language in the development of human experience\nlies in this fact that the stimulus is one that can react upon the\nspeaking individual as it reacts upon the other” (MSS,\n69). \n\nAs noted, Mead was indebted to Hegel's work, and the\nnotion of reflexivity plays a fundamental role in Mead's theory\nof mind. Vocal gestures—which depend on sufficiently\nsophisticated nervous systems to process them—allow individuals to\nhear their own gestures in the way that others hear them. If I\nshout “Boo” at you, I might not only scare you, I might\nscare myself. Or, to put this in other terms, vocal gestures\nallow one to speak to oneself when others are not present. I\nmake certain vocal gestures and anticipate how they would be responded\nto by others, even when they are not present. The responses\nof others have been internalized and have become part of an accessible\nrepertoire. (Mead would agree with Ludwig Wittgenstein that\nthere are no private languages. Language is social all the way\ndown.) According to Mead, through the use of vocal gestures\none can turn “experience” back on itself through the loop\nof speaking and hearing at relatively the same instant. And when\none is part of a complex network of language users, Mead argues that\nthis reflexivity, the “turning back” of experience on\nitself, allows mind to develop. \nMentality on our approach simply comes in when the organism is able\nto point out meanings to others and to himself. This is the\npoint at which mind appears, or if you like, emerges…. It is\nabsurd to look at the mind simply from the standpoint of the\nindividual human organism; for, although it has its focus there, it is\nessentially a social phenomenon; even its biological functions are\nprimarily social. (MSS, 132–133) \n\nIt is by means of reflexiveness—the turning back of the experience\nof the individual upon himself—that the whole social process is\nthus brought into the experience of the individuals involved in it; it\nis by such means, which enable the individual to take the attitude\nof the other toward himself, that the individual is able consciously to\nadjust himself to that process, and to modify the resultant of that\nprocess in any given social act in terms of his adjustment to it.\nReflexiveness, then, is the essential condition, within the social\nprocess, for the development of mind. (MSS, 134) \n\nMind is developed not only through the use of vocal gestures, but\nthrough the taking of roles, which will be addressed below. Here it is\nworth noting that although we often employ our capacity for\nreflexivity to engage in reflection or deliberation, both Dewey and\nMead argue that habitual, non-deliberative, experience constitutes the\nmost common way that we engage the world.  The habitual involves a\nhost of background beliefs and assumptions that are not raised to the\nlevel of (self) conscious reflection unless problems occur that\nwarrant addressing. For Dewey, this background is described as “funded\nexperience.” For Mead, it is the world that this there and\nthe “biologic individual.” \n\nOne of the most noteworthy features of Mead's account of the\nsignificant symbol is that it assumes that anticipatory experiences are\nfundamental to the development of language. We have the ability place\nourselves in the positions of others—that is, to anticipate their\nresponses—with regard to our linguistic gestures. This ability\nis also crucial for the development of the self and\nself-consciousness. For Mead, as for Hegel, the self is\nfundamentally social and cognitive. It should be distinguished from the\nindividual, who also has non-cognitive attributes. The self, then,\nis not identical to the individual and is linked to\nself-consciousness. It begins to develop when individuals\ninteract with others and play roles. What are roles? They\nare constellations of behaviors that are responses to sets of behaviors\nof other human beings. The notions of role-taking and role playing are\nfamiliar from sociological and social-psychological literature. For\nexample, the child plays at being a doctor by having another child play\nat being a patient. To play at being a doctor, however, requires\nbeing able to anticipate what a patient might say, and vice\nversa. Role playing involves taking the attitudes or perspectives of \nothers. It is worth noting in this context that while Mead\nstudied physiological psychology, his work on role-taking can be viewed\nas combining features of the work of the Scottish sympathy theorists\n(which James appealed to in The Principles of\nPsychology), with Hegel's dialectic of self and other.\nAs we will discover shortly, perspective-taking is associated not \nonly with roles, but with far more complex behaviors. \n\nFor Mead, if we were simply to take the roles of others, we would\nnever develop selves or self-consciousness. We would have a\nnascent form of self-consciousness that parallels the sort of reflexive\nawareness that is required for the use of significant symbols. A\nrole-taking (self) consciousness of this sort makes possible what might\nbe called a proto-self, but not a self, because it doesn't have\nthe complexity necessary to give rise to a self. How then does a\nself arise? Here Mead introduces his well-known neologism, the\ngeneralized other. When children or adults take\nroles, they can be said to be playing these roles in dyads.\nHowever, this sort of exchange is quite different from the more complex\nsets of behaviors that are required to participate in games. In\nthe latter, we are required to learn not only the responses of specific\nothers, but behaviors associated with every position on the\nfield. These can be internalized, and when we succeed in doing so\nwe come to “view” our own behaviors from the perspective of\nthe game as a whole, which is a system of organized actions. \n\nFor Mead, although these communities can take different forms, they\nshould be thought of as systems; for example, a family can be thought\nof systemically and can therefore give rise to a generalized other and\na self that corresponds to it. Generalized others can also be\nfound in \n\nIn his Principles of Psychology, a book Mead knew well,\nWilliam James discusses various types of empirical selves, namely, the\nmaterial, the social, and the spiritual. In addressing the social\nself, James notes how it is possible to have multiple selves. \n\nFrom Mead's vantage point, James was on the right track.  However, the\nnotion of audience is left undeveloped in James, as is the manner in\nwhich language is utilized in the genesis of the self and\nself-consciousness. For Mead, James's audiences should be thought of\nin terms of systemically organized groups, such as we find in certain\ngames, which give rise to generalized others. Further, we need an\naccount of how we come to view ourselves from the perspective of these\ngroups that goes beyond the concept of “sympathetic\nattachments.” Such an account involves reflexivity, which\noriginates with the vocal gesture and is essential to taking roles and\nthe perspective of the generalized other.  In addition, reflexivity\nhelps make possible the capacity to “see” ourselves from\never wider or more “universal” communities. Mead relates\nthe latter capacity to cosmopolitan political and cultural\norientations. It's worth noting that for Mead a full account of the\nself should address the phylogenetic as well as the ontogenetic. \n\nOne of Mead's most significant contributions to social psychology is\nhis distinction between the “I” and the “Me.”\nIt's worth emphasizing that while this distinction is utilized in\nsociological circles, it is grounded philosophically for Mead. His\ntarget, in part, is no less than the idea of the transcendental ego,\nespecially in its Kantian incarnation. It is also important to note\nthat the “I” and “Me” are functional\ndistinctions for Mead, not metaphysical ones. He refers to them as\nphases of the self (MSS 178, 200), although he more typically uses the\nword self to refer to the “Me” (Aboulafia 2016). \n\nThe self that arises in relationship to a specific generalized other\nis referred to as the “Me.” The “Me” is a\ncognitive object, which is only known retrospectively, that is, on\nreflection. When we act in habitual ways we are not typically\nself-conscious. We are engaged in actions at a non-reflective\nlevel. However, when we take the perspective of the generalized\nother, we are both “watching” and forming a self in\nrelationship to the system of behaviors that constitute this\ngeneralized other. So, for example, if I am playing second base,\nI may reflect on my position as a second baseman, but to do so I have\nto be able to think of “myself” in relationship to the\nwhole game, namely, the other actors and the rules of the\ngame. We might refer to this cognitive object as my (second\nbaseman) baseball self or “Me.” Perhaps a\nbetter example might be to think of the self in relationship to\none's family of origin. In this situation, one views oneself from\nthe perspective of the various sets of behaviors that constitute the\nfamily system. \n\nTo return to the baseball example, one may have a self, a\n“Me,” that corresponds to a particular position that one\nplays, which is nested within the game as an organized totality.  This\nself, however, doesn't tell us how any particular play may be\nmade. When a ball is grounded to a second baseman, how he or she\nreacts is not predetermined. He reacts, and how he reacts is always to\nsome degree different from how he has reacted in the past.  These\nreactions or actions of the individual, whether in response to others\nor self-initiated, fall within the “sphere” of the\n“I.” Every response that the “I” makes is\nsomewhat novel. Its responses may differ only in small ways from\nprevious responses, making them functionally equivalent, but they will\nnever be exactly the same.  No catch in a ball game is ever identical\nto a previous catch.  Mead declares that, “The ‘I’\ngives the sense of freedom, of initiative. The situation is there for\nus to act in a self-conscious fashion. We are aware of ourselves, and\nof what the situation is, but exactly how we will act never gets into\nexperience until after the action takes place” (MSS,\n177–178). The “I” is a “source” of both\nspontaneity and creativity. For Mead, however, the “I” is\nnot a noumenal ego. Nor is it a substance. It is a way of designating\na locus of activity. \n\nThe responses of the “I” are non-reflective.\nHow the “I” reacts is known only on reflection, that is,\nafter we retrospect. \n\nIn other words, once the actions of the “I” have become\nobjectified and known, by definition they have become a\n“Me.” The status of the “I” is interesting in\nMead. In trying to differentiate it from the empirical, knowable,\n“Me,” he states, “The ‘I’ is the\ntranscendental self of Kant, the soul that James conceived behind the\nscene holding on to the skirts of an idea to give it an added\nincrement of emphasis” (MSC in SW, 141). However, this statement\nshould not to be interpreted as endorsing the notion of a\ntranscendental ego. Mead is seeking to emphasize that the\n“I” is not available to us in our acts, that is, it is\nonly knowable in its objectified form as a “Me.” This\npoint is clarified by a remark that directly follows the statement\njust cited. “The self-conscious, actual self in social\nintercourse is the objective ‘me’ or ‘me's’\nwith the process of response continually going on and implying a\nfictitious ‘I’ always out of sight of himself” (MSC\nin SW, 141). A transcendental ego is not fictitious. But for Mead,\nsince we are dealing with a functional distinction here, it is quite\nacceptable to refer to the “I” as fictitious in\na metaphysical sense. \n\nWhy, then, do we seem to experience what Mead refers to as a\n“running current of awareness,” that is, an ego that\nappears to be aware of itself as it acts and thinks, if the\n“I” is not immediately aware of itself (SS in SW, 144)?\nWilliam James sought to explain this phenomenon in terms of\nproprioception and the relationship between “parts” of the\nstream of consciousness. (James 1890, 296–307; James 1904, 169–183;\nJames 1905, 184–194). Mead developed a unique explanation based\non the relationship of the “I” to the\n“Me.” As we have seen, the “I” reacts and\ninitiates action, but the actions taken are comprehended, objectified,\nas a “Me.” However, the “Me” is not simply \nconfined to the objectifications of the immediate actions of the\n“I.” The “Me” carries with it\ninternalized responses that serve as a commentary on the\n“I's” actions. Mead states, “The action\nwith reference to the others calls out responses in the individual\nhimself—there is then another ‘me’ criticizing,\napproving, and suggesting, and consciously planning, i.e., the\nreflective self” (SS in SW, 145). The running current of\nawareness, then, is not due to the “I” being immediately\naware of itself. It is due to the running commentary of the\n“Me” on the actions of the “I.” The\n“Me” follows the “I” so closely in time that it\nappears as if the “I” is the source of the “running\ncurrent of awareness.” \n\nFreud's super-ego could be conscious or unconscious. One might think\nof the “Me” as similar to the conscious super-ego in the\ncommentary that it provides, but one would have to be careful not to\ncarry this analogy too far. For Mead, the “Me” arises in\nrelationship to systems of behaviors, generalized others, and,\ntherefore, is by definition multiple, although the behaviors of\nvarious “Me's” can overlap.  Further, Freud's model\nassumes a determinism that is not inherent in the relationship of the\n“I” to the “Me.” Not only does the\n“I” initiate novel responses, its new behaviors can become\npart of a “Me.” In other words, “Me's” are not\nstatic. They are systems that often undergo transformation. This will\nbecome more apparent in the next section when we discuss Mead's ideas\nregarding emergence. In this context it is enough to suggest the\nfollowing: when a ballplayer makes a catch in a manner that has never\nbeen made before—that is, makes a play that is significantly\ndifferent from prior catches—the new play may become part of the\nrepertoire of the team's behaviors. In other words, the play may alter\nthe existing generalized other by modifying existing behavioral\npatterns. In so doing, it gives rise to a modified or new self because\nthe game as a whole has been changed. Once again, this may be easier\nto see in terms of the transformations that take place in families\nwhen new reactions occur as children and adults interact over time.\nNew selves are generated as family systems are transformed. \n\nWe have seen that the “I” introduces novelty in actions\nand in the interactions between human beings. For Mead, novelty\nis not a phenomenon that can be accounted for in terms of human\nignorance, as it can for a determinist such as Spinoza. In the\nSpinozistic framework, even though everything in nature is determined,\nas finite modes we must remain ignorant of the totality of causes.\nIn principle, however, an infinite Mind could predict every\nevent. Mead, following in the footsteps of Darwin, argues that\nnovelty is in fact an aspect of the natural world, and that there are\nevents that are not only unpredictable due to ignorance, but are in\nprinciple impossible to predict. In the latter category, for example,\nwe find mutations that help to give rise to new species, as well as the\ncreative responses of baseball players, musicians, composers, dancers,\nscientists, etc. \n\nIn The Philosophy of the Present—a compilation based on\nthe Carus Lectures delivered in late 1930 in Berkeley—Mead\noutlines his thoughts on nature and time. Mead did not have the\nopportunity to develop his ideas into a book. (He passed away early in\n1931.) In spite of the fact that these lectures were hurriedly written\ndue to obligations that he had as chair of the University of Chicago's\nphilosophy department, they contain ideas that illuminate his earlier\nwork and indicate the direction of his thought. On the first page of\nthe lectures we are told that “reality exists in a\npresent” and that we do not live in a Parmenidean cosmos (PP,\n1). “For a Parmenidean reality does not exist. Existence\ninvolves non-existence: it does take place. The world is a world of\nevents” (PP, 1). Our world is one in which change is real and\nnot merely a subjective, perceptual, phenomenon.  \n\nThe universe doesn't just spin its wheels and offer motion without real\nnovelty. Part of the impetus behind The Philosophy of the\nPresent was to argue against an interpretation of space-time, such\nas Hermann Minkowski's, which eliminates the truly novel or the\nemergent. Emergence involves not only biological organisms, but\nmatter and energy; for example, there is a sense in which water can be\nspoken of as emerging from the combination of hydrogen and\n oxygen.[1]\nNevertheless,\nbiological examples appear best suited to Mead's approach.\nIt's worth noting at this juncture that Mead had always been\nkeenly interested in science and the scientific method. However,\nas a pragmatist, the test of a scientific hypothesis for him is whether\nit can illuminate the world that is there. He certainly was\nnever a positivist. \n\nAs mentioned, Mead is a systemic thinker who speaks of taking the\nperspectives of others and of generalized others. These perspectives\nare not “subjective” for Mead. They are\n“objective” in the sense that they provide frames of\nreference and shared patterns of behavior for members of\ncommunities. (This is not to say that every human community has an\nequally viable account of the natural world. This is in part why we\nhave science for Mead.)  However, it is not only human perspectives\nthat are objective for Mead. While it is true that only human beings\nshare perspectives in a manner that allows them to be (self) conscious\nabout the perspectives of others, there is an objective reality to\nnon-human perspectives. How can a non-human perspective be objective?\nIn order to answer this question, a few general remarks about Mead's\nnotion of “perspective” are in order. First, it is important to note\nthat perspectives are not primarily visual for Mead. They are ways of\nspeaking about how organisms act and interact in environments. In the\nwords of David Miller, \n\nMead has been referred to as a tactile philosopher, as opposed\nto a visual one, because of the importance of contact experience in his\nthought. Perspectives involve contact and interaction between\norganisms and their environments. For example, a fish living in a certain\npond can be thought of as inhabiting an ecosystem. The way in which it\nnavigates the pond, finds food to eat, captures its food, etc., can be\nspoken of as the fish's perspective on the pond, and it is\nobjective, that is, its interactions are not a matter of the subjective\nperceptions of the fish. Its interactions in its environment\nshape and give form to its perspective, which is different from the\nsnail's perspective, although it lives in the same waters. In\nother words, organisms stratify environments in different ways as they\nseek to meet their needs (Miller 1973, 207–217). The pond, in fact, is\nnot one system but many systems in the sense that its inhabitants\nengage in different, interlaced interactions, and therefore have\ndifferent objective perspectives. The fish, of course, does not\ncomprehend its perspective or localized environment as a system, but\nthis doesn't make its perspective subjective. Human beings,\ngiven our capacity to discuss systems in language, can describe the\necology of a pond (or better, the ecologies of a pond depending on what\norganisms we are studying). We can describe, with varying degrees\nof accuracy, what it is like to be a fish living in a particular pond,\nas opposed to a snail. Through study we learn about the\nperspectives of other creatures, although we cannot share them as we\ncan the perspectives of the language bearing members of our own\nspecies. \n\nFor Mead, as noted, systems are not static. This is especially evident\nin the biological world. New forms of life arise, and some of them are\ndue to the efforts of human beings, for example, the botanists who\ncreate hybrids. Mead argues that if a new form of life emerges from\nanother form, then there is a time when the new organism has not fully\ndeveloped, and therefore has not yet modified its environmental\nniche. In this situation the older order, the old environment, has not\ndisappeared but neither has the new one been born. Mead refers to this\nstate of betwixt and between as\nsociality.  Sociality is a key idea for Mead and it has implications for his\nsociology and social psychology. If we think of the “Me”\nas a system, then there are times when the “I” initiates\nnew responses that may or may not be integrated into an existing\n“Me.” But if they come to be integrated, then there is a\ntime betwixt and between the old and new “Me” system. What\nmakes this all the more interesting is that human beings have a\ncapacity for reflection. We can become aware of changes that are\ntaking place as we “stand” betwixt and between, which\nallows for the possibility of influencing the development of a future\nself. We can even set up conditions to promote changes that we believe\nmay transform us in certain ways. Or to put this in another light, new\nproblems are bound to arise in the world, and because of our capacity\nfor sociality, we can get some purchase on the courses of action\navailable to us as we reflect on the novel problems confronting us. Of\ncourse, because the problems are novel means that we do not have ready\nsolutions. However, the capacity to stand betwixt and between old and\n(possible) new orders, as we do between old and new social roles,\nprovides us with some opportunity for anticipating alternatives and\nintegrating new responses. As a matter of fact, Mead links moral\ndevelopment with our capacity for moving beyond old values, old\nselves, in order to integrate new values into our personalities when\nnew situations call for them. \n\nIt's worth noting here that Mead did not develop an ethics, at\nleast not one that was systematically presented. But his position\nbears a kinship to theorists of moral sentiment, if we understand\n“the taking the perspectives of others” as a more\nsophisticated statement of sympathetic attachments. It is\nimportant to emphasize that for pragmatic reasons Mead does not think\nthat the idea of compassion is sufficient for grounding an\nethics. He argues for a notion of obligation that is tied to\ntransforming social conditions that generate pain and\n suffering.[2] \n\nReturning to Mead's notion of sociality, we can see that he is\nseeking to emphasize transitions and change between systems. This\nemphasis on change has repercussions for his view of the present, which\nis not to be understood as a knife-edge present. In human\nexperience, the present arises from a past and spreads into the\nfuture. In a manner reminiscent of James's account of\nthe stream of thought, Mead argues that the present entails\nduration (James 1890, 237–283). It retains the receding past and\nanticipates the imminent future. Yet because reality ultimately\nexists in the present, Mead argues that the historical past, insofar as\nit is capable of being experienced, is transformed by novel\nevents. History is not written on an unchanging scroll.\nNovelty gives lie to this way of seeing the past. By virtue of\nits originality, the novel event, the emergent, can not be explained or understood in\nterms of prior interpretations of the past. The past, which by\ndefinition can only exist in the present, changes to accommodate\nnovel events. \n\nMead's account of the “Me” and the generalized\nother has often led commentators to assume that he is a\ndeterminist. It is certainly the case that if one were to\nemphasize Mead's concern with social systems and the social\ndevelopment of the self, one might be led to conclude that Mead is a\ntheorist of the processes of socialization. And the latter,\nnested as they are within social systems, are beyond the control of\nindividuals. However, when one considers the role of the\n“I” and novelty in his thinking, it becomes more difficult\nto view him as a determinist. But his emphasis on novelty only\nseems to counter determinism with spontaneity. This counter to\ndeterminism in itself doesn't supply a notion of\nautonomy—self-governance and self-determination—which is often viewed\nas crucial to the modern Western notion of the\nsubject. However, Mead was a firm booster of the scientific\nmethod, which he viewed as an activity that was at its heart\ndemocratic. For him, science is tied to the manner in which human\nbeings have managed from pre-recorded times to solve problems and\ntransform their worlds. We have just learned to be more\nmethodical about the ways in which we solve problems in modern\nscience. If one considers his discussions of science and problem\nsolving behavior, which entail anticipatory experience, the reflexivity\nof consciousness, the sharing of perspectives and their objective\nreality, and the creativity of the “I,” then one begins to\nsee how Mead thought that our biological endowments coupled with our\nsocial skills could assist us in shaping our own futures, as well aid\nus in making moral decisions. He did not work out the details of\nthis process, especially with regard to moral autonomy and the\n“I's” role in\n it.[3]\nThere is, however, little doubt\nthat he thought autonomy possible, but the condition for its\npossibility depends on the nature of the self's genesis and the\ntype of society in which it develops.","contact.mail":"mitchell.aboulafia@manhattan.edu","contact.domain":"manhattan.edu"}]
