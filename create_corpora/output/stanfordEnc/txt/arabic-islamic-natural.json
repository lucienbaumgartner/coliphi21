Within the medieval Arabic-speaking world there\nwere two primary intellectual traditions in which natural philosophy\nwas done: kalam and falsafa. Kalam, or\nIslamic speculative theology, in general approached issues in physics\nfrom an atomistic framework, which for some of these theologians\nextended not only to the composition of bodies, but also to motion and\ntime as well, culminating among later Islamic theologians in an\noccasionalist worldview that reserved causal agency for God alone.\nfalsafa, or simply ‘philosophy,’ had its roots in\nthe Greek intellectual world and more specifically in the\nphilosophical thought of Aristotle as he was interpreted by later\nPeripatetic and Neoplatonic commentators with the additional\nsupplementation by Galen in biology and anatomy and Ptolemy in\nastronomy. The following account begins with the atomistic theories\nfound among the Islamic speculative theologians followed by the\ndevelopments in Aristotelian natural philosophy by Arabic-speaking\nphilosophers and their unique contributions to that field.\n\nAlthough some early Muslim theologians maintained that there is\nbasically only accidents and that bodies are composites of bundles of\naccidents, while others held that there are only corporeal bodies and\nthat everything else is constituted out of the interpenetration of\nthese bodies, most Muslim theologians included both\n atoms[1]\n and accidents in their ontology and additionally God. One way that\nthis ontology was justified was to begin with a proof for the world’s\ntemporal creation. It was argued that if the world were not created,\nthen an infinite number of past days would have been traversed;\nhowever, it was held as self-evident that an infinite, let alone\ntraversing it, is impossible. Thus the world must have been created at\nsome first moment. In that case, however, the world must have a\nCreator. Thus there is what creates, namely, God, and what is created.\nWhat is created was divided further into what occupies space, namely,\nsubstances or atoms, and what does not, namely, accidents. \nOccupying space (tahayyuz) was for the Muslim theologians the\nnecessary result of any thing’s being a substance, and it was this\nattribute of occupying space that confirmed the existence of\nsubstances; for occupying space was held to be an attribute that was\ndirectly perceived by the senses and as such could not be gainsaid.\nThus that substances exist was a matter of direct knowledge. Most\nMuslim theologians additionally maintained that these substances also\nhave an atomic structure. This is not to say that they thought humans\ncould directly perceive an individual atom taken in\nisolation—they did not; however, they believed that one could\ndemonstrate that the ultimate material constituents of the world must\nbe discrete rather than continuous. In general, their arguments for\natomic rather than continuous substances used paradoxes involving the\ninfinite. For example, it was argued that if a body were continuous,\nthen it would be divisible infinitely, in which case the body would\nhave an actually infinite number of parts that all adhere together to\nform the body and that correspond with the infinite number of\ndivisions. The existence of an actual infinite is absurd, however, and\nso the division of the body must terminate at a finite number of\nindivisible parts or atoms. It does no good to say that the body has\nonly a potentially infinite number of parts corresponding to the\ndivisions rather than an actually infinite number; for it was argued\nthat if something is truly potential, then some agent, such as God,\nmust have the power to bring about or actualize that potentiality.\nThus, let God bring about the purportedly potentially infinite number\nof divisions, in which case there would be an actually infinite number\nof parts, which again is absurd. Similarly, it is of no avail to say\nthat the divisions are neither actual nor potential, but only\nimagined, since what is truly impossible cannot be imagined, and the\nexistence of an actual infinite, it was believed, is truly impossible.\nAnother argument for the atomic structure of matter was a variation on\nZeno’s dichotomy paradox, couched in terms of an ant’s creeping over a\nsandal. If a body were continuous, the argument runs, then should an\nant attempt to cross a sandal, it would first need to reach the\nhalfway point on the sandal, but before it could reach the halfway\npoint, it would need to reach its halfway point and so on infinitely.\nSince an infinite cannot be traversed, the ant could never cross the\nsandal, but of course a body such as a sandal can be crossed, and thus\nbodies cannot be continuous, but must be composed of a finite number\nof atomic parts. Yet another argument observed that differences in\nsize are accounted for by difference in the number of constituent\nparts that make up the body. Now if bodies were continuous and so\ncomposed of an infinite number of parts, then the number of parts\nconstituting a mustard seed and the number of parts constituting a\nmountain would be the same, namely, infinite. Consequently the two\nbodies should not differ in size; for one infinite cannot exceed\nanother, and yet such a conclusion is patently false. In the end, most\nIslamic speculative theologians concluded that the matter constituting\nthe cosmos must be discrete rather than continuous. \nScholars have varied, however, concerning whether the indivisible\nparts posited in the physics of these theologians should be viewed as\nextended or point-like. Shlomo Pines argued that although later Muslim\ntheologians took atoms to have a certain measure and so were\nconsidered extended, earlier theologians conceived of them as points.\nPines wrote his groundbreaking study of Islamic atomism,\nBeiträge zur islamischen Atomenlehre, in 1936; however,\nsince then more kalam texts have become available. In light\nof these new sources, Alnoor Dhanani (Dhanani 1994, 90–140) has\nsuccessfully challenged Pines’ suggestion and argued in its place that\nthe atoms of both early and later Muslim theologians are akin to\nEpicurean minimal\n parts.[2]\n In this respect, the atom is the minimal space-occupying unit having\na wholly simple internal structure. As such the atom has neither\nphysical nor conceptual features into which it could be divided. As a\nresult of this understanding of atoms, although they function as the\ncomponents of the various magnitudes composed of them, such as lines,\nplanes and solids, they technically cannot be said to have length,\nwidth and depth; for length, width and depth are always bounded by\nextremities, whereas atoms simply cannot have any extremities, but\ninstead play the role of the extremities themselves of those things\nthat possess length, breadth and depth. \nAtoms in themselves again are space occupying; however, among created\nthings the Muslim theologians also posited things that were in\nthemselves not space occupying, but rather inhered in atoms. Things of\nthis latter sort are the so-called ‘accidents.’ Muslim\ntheologians had argued for the existence of accidents from the fact\nthat atoms as such are similar or homogeneous, and so if there are\nperceptible differences among bodies (and there clearly are such\ndifferences), those differences must be due to differences among the\naccidents that inhere in the atoms. The Muslim theologians then went\non to identify no less than twenty-two different kinds of accidents,\nwhich include the obvious ones such as taste, color and smell as well\nas adhesion, force, power and willing, but also less obvious ones such\nas life and ceasing to exist. \nIn addition to God, atoms and accidents, certain Muslim theologians\nalso posited (empty) space. Averroes claimed that they did so in order\nfor there to be a place in which God temporally creates the atoms and\naccidents, although such a claim is not clearly stated by the\ntheologians themselves. Concerning space two questions were debated\namong the atomists: one, “Is space discrete (like the atoms that\noccupy it) or continuous?” and, two, “Is there any\nunoccupied space, or more exactly, could there be interstitial void\nspaces between atoms or is the cosmos a plenum?” \nWhile the Islamic theologians were virtually unanimous that matter is\ndiscrete, they varied concerning the make up of the space that atoms\noccupied, namely, whether space is constituted out of exactly fitting\natom-sized cells, or whether it is an open continuous expanse. The\ndebate centered on the issue of whether an atom could be placed on top\nof two atoms such that the top atom straddles both of the bottom atoms\nequally, for instance like the top block on a small pyramid made up of\nthree equally sized blocks. Those who argued that space must be\ndiscrete did so on the basis that if it were not, then atoms would\nturn out to be at least conceptually divisible, yet all Muslim\natomists agreed that atoms are not only physically indivisible, but\nalso conceptually indivisible. One of their most common arguments\nbegan with the premise that the atom represents the smallest possible\nmagnitude. If space is continuous such that an atom could straddle two\natoms at their boundary and so form something like the aforementioned\nthree-block pyramid, then imagine two such pyramids joined at their\nbases so that a gap is formed between the two top atoms. In that case,\nthe two top atoms would be separated from one another by a magnitude\nless than an atom. Since the atom is the least possible magnitude, and\nyet the magnitude between the two top atoms is purportedly less than\nan atom, there is a contradiction; for there is a magnitude less than\nthe smallest possible magnitude. Those who argued for a continuous\nspace in contrast began with the premise that an atom can occupy and\nmeasure any vacant space that is of a sufficient size to hold it. Thus\nthey had one imagine a line three atoms long and then two more atoms\non top of these, where one atom is exactly over the far-right, bottom\natom, for example, and another atom is exactly over the far-left\nbottom atom. Next they had one imagine that at the exact same moment\ntwo equal forces push the two top atoms towards each other. Either the\ntwo atoms straddle the two boundaries of the three bottom atoms or\nnot. If they straddle them, then space must be continuous and not\ndiscrete. If the opponent denies that they straddle the boundaries,\nthen he owes us an answer as to why they do not. Certainly the two\natoms can be moved in the manner described; for the only thing that\ncould prevent the motion would be the presence of an obstacle, and yet\nthe adjacent space into which the atoms are moved is supposedly empty.\nAlthough this last argument offered a serious challenge to the notion\nof discrete space, most of the later theologians were in fact inclined\nto make all magnitudes discrete, whether that magnitude was corporeal,\nspatial or even, as we shall see, temporal. \nThe second question concerning space involved the possible existence\nof interstitial voids and focused on whether two atoms could be\nseparated from one another without a third atom’s existing between\nthem. Dhanani (Dhanani 1994, 74–81) has classified the arguments\nagainst such a possibility into two types: those involving non-being\nand those involving the principle ‘nature abhors a void.’\nAn example of the first kind of argument is the following. Assume that\ntwo atoms are separated and that purportedly nothing exists between\nthem. Since one cannot perceive what does not exist, then in the\npresent case one should not be able to perceive a truly empty space\nbetween the separated atoms; however, it seems evident that one would\nbe able to perceive the space between them and so that space could not\nbe truly empty, but must be occupied by an atom. An example of the\nsecond sort of argument against interstitial voids is taken from the\nmedical arts and the use of cupping glasses for blood letting. It is\nobserved that when a cupping glass is placed over a vein and the air\nis withdrawn, the flesh is drawn up into the cup. The detractors of\ninterstitial voids used this phenomenon as a verification of the\nprinciple that nature abhors a vacuum. Consequently, since nature does\nabhor a vacuum, void spaces will not exist in nature. Interestingly,\nthe proponents of interstitial voids were able to turn the cupping\nglass phenomenon against their opponents to show that a void must\nexist. They had one imagine that a sheet of atoms one atom thick is\nplaced between two cupping glasses and then the air is simultaneously\nremoved from both glasses. Either the sheet is drawn into one or the\nother glass or it is not. If the sheet is drawn into one cupping\nglass, there is a void in the other; if the sheet is not drawn into\none or the other cupping glass, then there is a void in both. In\neither case a void has been produced. \nAs for time, although Moses Maimonides would claim in the Guide of\nthe Perplexed that Muslim theologians had a single atomic theory\nof time, such a claim seems to be gainsaid by earlier sources\navailable to us (Maimonides 1963, ch. 73, premise 3). The theologian\nal-Ash‘ari lists no less than three different accounts of the\nmoment and time (al-Ash‘ari 1980, 443). One theory makes time an\naggregate of moments, where the moment is a ‘certain duration\nbetween one action and the next action’ (Ibid). It is not clear\nwhether the duration in question is some minimal temporal unit or some\npotentially divisible temporal unit or even whether it could be either\ndepending upon the action in question. If it is some minimal temporal\nunit, or time atom, then such a view would clearly advocate time’s\nhaving an atomic structure. A second theory considers the moment an\naccident. The philosopher Avicenna (980–1037), who was writing a\nlittle more than a generation later, commented on this view and noted\nthat the moment-accident posited by certain theologians is what\ntemporally locates an atom and that time is simply a collection of\nsuch accidents. The final theory of time, which was by far the most\npopular among the theologians, made the moment simply some\nconventionally specified event, such as someone’s entering a house,\nand as such it has no special ontological status, whereas\n‘time’ is just another name for the motion of the heavens.\nIt should be noted, however, that if the motion in question had an\natomic structure, then ipso facto time would be atomic, and\nindeed many of those who held this conception of time endorsed atomic\nmotion. Although it not clear whether Muslim theologians explicitly\nespoused a theory of atomic time, as we shall see in the next section,\nsome of them adopted a theory of occasionalism, which at least\nimplicitly endorses such a view. \nAt least among those theologians who posited both atoms and accidents\nin their ontology, most changes were explained in terms of one\naccident’s being replaced by its contrary or at least by something\nacting like a contrary. In this case the atom changes, not the\naccident, which in fact is annihilated by its contrary. Although\naccident-replacement was the most general account of change, changes\nthat involve one type of body coming from another type of body (as for\nexample when fire is produced from burning wood or a spark is produced\nfrom striking stones together) presented a special case that needed a\ndifferent analysis of change. Many theologians explained this sort of\nchange in terms of a theory of latency (kumun), which\nmaintained that the fire atoms were already present in the wood or\nstone, albeit latent in them, and then were made manifest through the\naction of burning or striking. \nConcerning the more prominent sort of change, namely,\naccident-replacement, two further questions were debated: one,\n“Does change form a single kind or not?” and two,\n“Where does locomotion occur, that is to say, do the initial\natoms prior to the motion or the subsequent atoms after the motion\nreceive the accident of motion?” One argument used to show that\nthere are several kinds of motion observed that a single kind cannot\nbring about contradictory things, as for example, a fire does not\nproduce cooling and heating; however, motions do bring about\ncontraries such as being to the right or being to the left or being\nblack and being white. Thus motion cannot form a single kind. An\ninteresting response to this line of thought, which itself constituted\nan argument that motion forms a single kind, was the following. When a\nperson determines to move, say to the right, then at the next moment\nthere is both a motion and together with the motion a state of being\nto the right, and so there is a rightward motion. Similarly, should\none choose to move to the left, there would be both a motion together\nwith a state of being to the left, and so a leftward motion. Motion\nthen can be analyzed into both a motion and a particular state or\nmanner of being that accompanies the motion (where perhaps the\naccompanying state is understood as the result of the motion, although\nit is not explicitly described as such). The motion considered in\nitself is different from both the accompanying state (or result) as\nwell as the composite of the state and motion. Motions considered in\nthemselves, then, are similar with respect to being motion, but differ\nwith respect to the state or manner of being that accompanies the\nmotions, and so motion considered apart from the accompanying state is\na single kind. \nThe second issue debated by Muslim theologians concerning motion was\nwhether motion should be thought to occur in the first or second\nmoment, as for example whether there is motion at the very moment that\none determines to move rightward or at the moment when one is to the\nright. There were no less than three answers given to this question:\none was that the accident of motion occurs at the initial location of\nthe moving body; another located the motion in some second location;\nand finally one maintained that motion requires the body’s being at\ntwo locations at two different moments. Those who maintained that the\naccident of motion occurs at the initial locations claimed that motion\nis the force of a body that necessitates its being in the second\nlocation. Since the force must be initially present in the body if it\nis to move to the second place, and motion is identified with this\nforce, the accident of motion must be present while the body is still\nin the initial place. Those who maintained that the accident of motion\noccurs in the second location did so on the basis of a linguistic\nanalysis of the term ‘motion’; for ‘motion’\nmeans there is a passage or transference of a body; however, there has\nbeen no passage or transference of a body while it is still in its\ninitial location. Thus the accident of motion must occur in the second\nlocation. Abu Hudhayl (d. 841), who held that motion is different from\neither the state or composite of state and motion, maintained that\nmotion requires two places and two moments; ‘The body’s motion\nfrom the first place to the second place occurs in [the body] and [the\nbody] is in the second place at the exact moment it is in [motion],\nwhich is the transference and emergence of [the body] from the first\nplace … and so local motion inevitably involves two places and\ntwo moments’ (al-Ash‘ari 1980, 355). \nAssociated with issues concerning motion and change was that of\ncausality, namely, “What or who is the agent that brings about\nchange?” Many of the earlier theologians subscribed to a theory\nof engenderment (tawallud), which preserved a degree of\ncausal efficacy for humans, whereas most later theologians adopted an\noccasionalist worldview, which reserved all agency for God and God\nalone. For the earlier theologians causal agency required a full\nknowledge (‘ilm) that one is acting as well as the\nknowledge of what results from that action. Thus causal agency is\nlimited to God and humans. That humans had the power to engender\ncertain actions was assumed by most of the earlier theologians. The\nquestion, then, was whether humans had the power to engender action\nsolely in themselves or in other things as well. One of the arguments\nused by those who thought humans could engender effects in things\nother than themselves came from the knowledge criterion for agency. It\ntook as an example that when a person beats another, he knows the\nbeating of the other, in which case the knowledge is of the action of\nthe one beating the other (al-Ash‘ari 1980, 401–402).\nGeneralized, the argument seems to be that if one knows that one is an\nagent (and again it was taken for granted by the early theologians\nthat humans are agents), then one must know the effects of his action,\nand yet one knows that the effects of certain actions are in others,\nas in the case of beating and so causing pain. In contrast, others\nargued that humans only engender actions within themselves, and it is\nGod who brings about the effect in others, as for example, a human may\nproduce the action of willing to throw a stone, but it is God who\nactually causes the stone to move. One way of defending this thesis\nwas to observe that God creates bodies all at once and that at each\nmoment He recreates them (Ibid, 404). The assumption seems to be that\nsince God recreates bodies, human or otherwise, at every moment, no\nbody survives between two moments such that an action willed in the\nhuman body at one moment could be causally efficacious on some other\nbody at a second moment; for in one sense any purported efficacy of\nwhat was willed at one moment is wholly disconnected with the events\nof some second moment. \nThis latter argument taken to its logical conclusions, however,\nvirtually entails occasionalism, that is, the view that at each moment\nGod recreates the world, its atoms and accidents as well as all\nactions, whether that of a human or not, and so it is God alone who is\noccasioning the events that occur in our world. Indeed later\ntheologians would embrace such an occasionalist worldview. Their\npreferred argument for occasionalism, however, was not the one\nsketched above, but one based on the notion of possibility\n (istita‘a).[3]\n The argument roughly was that a creature only performs some action if\nit possesses the possibility to perform that action. Whenever the\ncreature possesses this possibility, the possibility is either\nactualized or not. On the one hand, to affirm a non-actualized\nexisting thing, such as an un-actualized possibility, is tantamount to\naffirming a non-existing existing thing, which is a patent\ncontradiction. On the other hand, if the possibility is actualized,\nthen the creature must be performing the correlative action, and will\nalways be doing so when it possesses the actualized possibility, but\nof course created things sometimes act and sometimes do not. Therefore\nthe possibility for a creature to perform any given action must be\ncreated for it at any time it acts, and it is God who is constantly\ncreating the possibility to act, and so in effect the correlative\naction, at every moment something acts. In short, all agency must\nbelong to God and God alone. \nAgain as a general rule most of the speculative theologians adopted an\natomistic framework for explaining natural phenomena; however, such a\nposition was not without its critics even within the kalam\ntradition itself, and the most notorious of these critics was Ibrahim\nan-Nazzam (d. ca. 840). An-Nazzam denied the atom-accident ontology of\nmost theologians and instead maintained that with the one exception of\nthe accident of motion everything else in our world was a body.\nMoreover, bodies, as well as space, did not have an atomic structure,\nbut a continuous one according to an-Nazzam. Affirming continuous\nspace and motion left an-Nazzam vulnerable to Zeno-style paradoxes,\nand indeed the atomist Abu Hudhayl openly confronted him with the\nant-sandal paradox sketched above. An-Nazzam’s solution was to\nmaintain that a moving object, such as an ant, could cross a\ncontinuous space with its infinite number of halfway points by means\nof a leap (tafra). The general idea was that a moving body\ncould cover a continuous space by making a finite number of leaps and\nthat during each leap the moving body is not in the intervening\nspaces. In other words, a moving body leaps from some first place to a\nthird place on a continuous magnitude without having passed through\nany second place between the two. \nDespite the counterintuitive nature of an-Nazzam’s suggestion, he\nargued that even the atomists had to posit leaps as well. He had one\nimagine the rotation of a millstone. Now in a single rotation an atom\nat the outer edge of the wheel would traverse a distance equal to the\ncircumference of the wheel, whereas an atom at the hub would traverse\na shorter distance equal to the circumference of the hub. Since the\natom at the outer edge is traversing a greater distance in an equal\ntime as the atom at the hub, the atom at the outer edge must be moving\nfaster than the atom at the hub. An-Nazzam next observed that there is\nonly one of two ways to explain this phenomenon: either the atom at\nthe outer edge leaps over some of the intervening atomic cells, or the\natom at the hub rests at some of the atomic cells for a few moments\nwhile the atom at the outer edge catches up. The preferred atomist\nsolution to differences in velocity was to posit that slower moving\nobjects have a greater number of intervallic rests than faster moving\nobjects; however, an-Nazzam disallowed this solution with respect to\nthe rotating millstone on the grounds that in that case the millstone\nwould fragment as certain atoms rest while others keep moving. In\nother words, some atoms that at the beginning of the motion had been\nnext to other atoms would have moved away from each other as the ones\nnearer the rim kept moving in order to cover the greater distance and\nthe ones nearer the hub rested in order to cover only their respective\ndistance, and so by the atom’s moving away from each other, the\nmillstone as a whole would fragment and break up. Yet, argued\nan-Nazzam, it is directly observable that the stone does not fragment,\nand thus even the atomists must be committed to leaps. \nThe above provides a very general outline of one of the prominent\nintellectual approaches to natural philosophy in the Arabic-speaking\nworld of the medieval period. The second major tradition of natural\nphilosophy, falsafa, had its origin in Aristotle’s physical\nwritings and the Graeco-Arabic commentary tradition that arose up\n around them.[4]\n Since natural philosophy, at least as it occurred in the\nGreek scientific tradition, is the study of natures, and natures are\ncauses of motion or change, understanding what motion is and the\nconditions necessary for motions within a broadly Aristotelian\nframework was the primary focus of natural philosophers working in the\nfalsafa tradition. Aristotle himself had defined motion as\n“the entelekheia of potential insofar as it is\nsuch” (Physics, III 1). One of the exegetical issues\nwith which earlier Greek commentaries struggled was how to understand\nthe enigmatic term entelekheia in Aristotle’s definition, a\nterm it would seem that Aristotle himself coined. Some argued that\nentelekheia must refer to a progression or process towards\nsome end or perfection. Others argued that entelekheia must\nrefer in some sense to the completed actuality of some partial end or\nperfection. The dispute in the ancient world, then, settled upon\nwhether entelekheia is itself a process term or not. If\nentelekheia is a process term then it is clear how\nAristotle’s definition of motion describes a process, but it does so\nby assuming a process term in the definition, whereas Aristotle’s\ndefinition of motion was intended to provide the most basic account of\nwhat a process is and so should not presuppose a process. If\nentelekheia is not a process term, then Aristotle’s\ndefinition avoids circularity, but it is no longer clear how it\ndescribes a process, since a completion or perfection is the end of a\nprocess, not a process itself. The above roughly presents a key\nphilosophical debate surrounding Aristotle’s definition of motion as\nit reached Arabic-speaking\n philosophers.[5] \nPart of this terminological issue was resolved by the Arabic\ntranslation of Aristotle’s Physics itself; for there\nAristotle’s definition is rendered “motion is the perfection\n(kamal) of what is in potency inasmuch as it is such,”\nwhere the translation of entelekheia as\n‘perfection’ would decidedly bias Arabic-speaking\nAristotelians against the process interpretation of that term. Thus\nthe primary issue for these philosophers involved explaining how\nAristotle’s definition of motion actually describes a process. Perhaps\nthe most sophisticated solution to this issue was that of Avicenna,\nwho in effect argued for motion at an instant (Avicenna 2009, II.1,\n4–6; Hasnawi 2001; McGinnis\n 2006a).[6]\n Avicenna begins his analysis by distinguishing two senses of motion,\none of which might be termed ‘traversal-motion’ and the\nother ‘intermedial-motion’. Traversal-motion occurs when\none observes an object in two different, opposing states, for example,\nbeing here and then being there. Now in the world, a\nmoving object is not simultaneously partially here and partially there\nduring its motion. Consequently, in the world, motion is not some\ncontinuous thing that at any moment actually extends between here and\nthere in the way that the distance continuously extends between two\npoints; rather, the relation between these two states is impressed\nupon the mind, and it is this mental impression that gives rise to the\nidea of traversal-motion, that is, the idea of motion as a continuous\nextended magnitude. \nAs for intermedial-motion, that is, the motion that exists\nextra-mentally, here is where Avicenna’s novel analysis of motion at\nan instant comes to play. He first notes that the perfection in\nquestion in Aristotle’s definition could not refer either to the\nstarting point or to the ending point of the motion, since in the\nfirst case the motion has not yet begun and in the second case the\nmotion is already completed. Thus the perfection must refer to some\nperfection of the moving object while it is in an intermediate state\nbetween these two extremes. So, for example, an object moving between\nx and z is not in motion at either x or\nz, but only while it is in the space between x and\nz. That intermediate state, in turn, could refer either to\nthe whole continuous medium between the two extremes or to a point.\nSo, again, the intermediary state might refer to the whole of the\nmotion along the entire continuous distance between x and\nz or to the moving object’s being at one or another single\npoint along the distance, as for example, y. Avicenna next\nobserved that at every instant during a moving object’s continuous\nmotion it is moving, and yet there is no instant at which the whole of\nthe motion exists as some extended magnitude. Thus the perfection in\nthe definition of motion must refer to the perfection of the moving\nthing at one or another point between the starting and ending points,\nalbeit, as the moving thing is at that point for only an instant. It\nis the very fact that the moving object is only at the intermediate\npoint for precisely an instant that guarantees that the object is\nundergoing motion; for should it remain at some point for more than an\ninstant, and so for a period of time, the object would in fact be at\nrest at that point. \nNot all were pleased with Avicenna’s interpretation of Aristotle’s\ndefinition of motion and some authors challenged not merely Avicenna\nbut even the need for Aristotle’s own recondite definition of motion\nin term of an entelekheia. Such an attitude was certainly the\ncase in the Islamic East during the period immediately following\nAvicenna as witnessed in the works of Abu l-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d.\n1165) and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1209). Abu l-Barakat, although part\nof the falsafa tradition, was also a critical reader of both\nAristotle and Avicenna, whereas Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, while working\nwithin the kalam tradition seriously engaged the philosophers\nand even wrote a commentary on one of Avicenna’s shorter philosophical\nencyclopedias. They preferred to define motion as a gradual or\nnot-all-at-once emergence from potency to act. Avicenna himself had\nconsidered this definition but found it wanting. Specifically,\nAvicenna complained that this definition is ultimately circular\n(Avicenna, 2009, II.1, 3). Thus he noted that gradual/not-all-at-once\nare understood in terms of time, and time, following Aristotle, is\ndefined in terms of motion, namely, as the measure of motion\nwith respect to before an after. Consequently, complains Avicenna, an\nunderstanding of time requires that one already understand motion, but\nthe suggested understanding of motion appeals to an understanding of\ntime. In response to this objection, Abu l-Barakat noted that both\nAristotle (Posterior Analytics, 1.13, 78a22–b32) and\nAvicenna (Kitab al-burhan, III.2, 202–3) recognize a\ndifference between something’s being better known to us and\nbeing better known by nature. Something is better known to\nus, if it is a matter of direct sensible observation, whereas it is\nbetter known by nature if one grasps the underlying causal\nexplanation. The standard example is drawn from the observation that\nwhat is near does not twinkle, and the planets do not twinkling. Thus\nAristotle and Avicenna observe that from the fact that the planets do\nnot twinkle (a fact better known to us) one can infer that the planets\nare near. One can then convert this conclusion and use it a\ndemonstration that causally explains why the planets do not twinkle,\nnamely, because they are near (now a fact better known by nature). The\nappearance of circularity is purportedly illusory, since in the two\ninferences, the premises are not being used in the same way: in one\ncase the premise explains something better known to us and in the\nother something better known by nature. Whether one accepts Aristotle\nand Avicenna’s analysis is less important than that both of them\nseemed committed to it, and Abu l-Barakat exploits this fact. He\nargues that the supposed circularity underlying defining motion in\nterms of the gradual emergence from potency to actuality is nothing\nmore than a case of a conversion from something better-known-to-us to\nsomething better-known-by-nature. \nFakhr al-Din al-Razi in his al-Mabāhith al-mashriqiyya,\nmoreover, approvingly repeats Abu l-Barakat’s suggestion: \nConceptualizing the true nature of “all-at-once,”\n“not-all-at-once” and “gradual” are all\nprimitive conceptualizations owing to the aid of sensation. Sure, we\nunderstand that these things are known only by reason of the now and\ntime, but that requires a demonstration. It is possible that the true\nnature of motion is known by these things, and thereafter motion fixes\na knowledge of time and the now, which are reasons for those first\nthings’ being conceptualized, but in that case no circle is entailed.\nThis is a fine answer. (ar-Razi, Fakhr al-Din, 1990, vol. 1, 670) \nAl-Razi’s idea, like Abu l-Barakat’s, is that notions like all-at-once\nand gradual are known immediately through sensation. While it is true\nthat time and the now, respectively, provide the basis in reality for\nour perceptions of things emerging gradually or all-at-once, such a\nrelation must be demonstrated and is not immediate. Since the notions\nof gradual and all-at-once are immediate, they can provide us with the\ntrue nature of what motion is. Having identified what motion is, one\ncan use it then to define time and so explain the gradual and the\nlike. \nAbu l-Barakat and al-Razi’s definition of motion was in turn picked up\nby the polymath, Athir al-Din al-Abhari (d. 1262 or 1265), who used it\nin his highly successful textbook of natural philosophy, Hidayat\nal-hikma. The definition would be common at least until it was\nchallenged by the great Shia philosopher and theologian, Mulla Sadra\n(d. 1636). Drawing on Avicenna’s earlier account of motion, which\nMulla Sadra defends at least in his Sharh al-Hidaya (Mulla\nSadra, 2001, 103–105), he reminds his reader that motion is\nitself an equivocal term and is said in no less than two ways:\ntraversal-motion and intermedial-motion. Abu l-Barakat and Fakhr\nal-Din al-Razi’s rejoinder to Avicenna’s original charge of\ncircularity works, observes Mulla Sadra, only if the sense of motion\nis the same in the two converted premises. They are not maintains\nMulla Sadra. While it is true that time-better-know-to-us can be used\nto understand motion, the motion in question is traversal-motion, that\nis, the idea of motion that, according to Avicenna, exists only\nmentally. In contrast, the sense of motion used to explain the nature\nof time is not traversal-motion but intermedial-motion, that is, the\nextra-mental motion that exists in the world. Thus the actual premises\nare not those noted by Abu l-Barakat and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, but the\nfollowing two: \nThe conversion thus does not go through, since none of the terms in\nthe two premises are common. Mulla Sadra then concludes his account of\nmotion by repeating and defending Avicenna’s idea that the form of\nmotion as it exists in the world involves motion at an instant, and it\nis this account that comes to predominate in the Muslim East\n(certainly Muslim India) until at least as late as the 1850s. \nAlthough the above argument provides some of the medieval Arabic\naccounts of the form of motion as discussed within the\nfalsafa tradition, there are other causal factors and\nnecessary conditions involved in the analysis of motion. Some of the\nmost significant conditions are (1) the infinite (particularly as it\nappears in descriptions of the continuous, e.g., the continuous as\nwhat is potentially divisible infinitely), (2) place and, closely\nrelated to place, (3) void, and also (4) time. \nThe standard argument against the actual existence of the\ninfinite can be traced back at least as early as al-Kindi and\nstretches throughout the entire classical period of Arabic or Islamic\nphilosophy up to at least as-Suhrawardi (al-Kindi 1950, 115–116 &\n202–203; Avicenna 1983, III.8, 212–214; id., 1985, IV.11,\n244–246; Ibn Bajja 1978, 36–37; Ibn Tufayl 1936,\n75–77; and as-Suhrawardi 1999,\n 44).[7]\n A simplified version of the argument runs as follows. Imagine two\nrigid beams, which cannot give way so as to stretch. Moreover, suppose\nthat these beams extend from the earth infinitely into space. Next,\nimagine that some finite length, x, is removed from one of\nthe beams, for instance, the distance between the earth and the end of\nour galaxy; call that beam from which x has been removed\nR. Now imagine that R is pulled toward the earth,\nand then is compared with the beam from which nothing had been\nremoved. Call that Original beam O. In this case, since the\nbeams are rigid, R could not have stretched so as to extend\nthe extra length x. Consequently, R must be less\nthan O by a length equal to x. Now imagine the two\nbeams lying side-by-side and compare them. Since they are\nside-by-side, either R corresponds exactly with O\nand so is equal to O in spatial extent, or R falls\nshort of O. On the one hand, if R does not fall\nshort of O but exactly corresponds with, and so is equal to,\nO, then R is not less than O. But it was\nposited that R is less than O by the length\nx, and so there is a contradiction. If, on the other hand,\nR falls short of O on the side extending into space,\nthen where it falls short of O is a limit of R, in\nwhich case R is limited on both the side extending into space\nand on the earth side. In that case, R is finite, but it was\nassumed to be infinite, another contradiction. In short, if an\nactually infinite extension could exist and can be shortened by some\nfinite amount (which is assumed as given), then the shortened amount\nmust be either equal to or less than the original infinite extension;\nhowever, either case leads to contradiction. Therefore, the premise\nthat gave rise to the contradictions, namely, an actually infinite\nextension could exist, must be rejected. \nAl-Kindi went on to use the conclusion of this argument to maintain\nthat time itself must be finite and consequently that the period of\ntime during which the world has existed must be finite. Therefore, he\nconcluded on the basis of this argument that the world must have been\ncreated at some first moment of time and so is not eternal (al-Kindi\n1950, 121–122 & 205–206). Al-Kindi’s argument for the\ntemporal finitude of the cosmos is also the same one preferred by\nadvocates of kalam, and is none other than the\n“Kalam Cosmological Argument,” recently\nre-popularized by William Lane Craig (Craig, 2000). In opposition to\nal-Kindi’s application of the foregoing argument to time, most\nsubsequent philosophers in the falsafa tradition took the\nconclusion of the above argument to entail only that an actual\ninfinite magnitude or number of things could not exist, that is to\nsay, there cannot exist some wholly completed infinite all of whose\nparts exist at one and the same moment in time. In those cases where\nnot all of the magnitude or its parts exist together at a single\nmoment—as in the case of time and its parts, the past, present\nand future—then an infinite, they argued, could exist, albeit\nonly potentially. \nIn addition to offering a means of understanding the eternity of the\nuniverse, the notion of a potential infinite was also useful for many\nnatural philosophers in that it provided a way to explain the\ncontinuous. Although strictly speaking Arabic-speaking philosophers\nfollowed the definition of the continuous given by Aristotle in\nPhysics V 3, which is in terms of two touching limits\nbecoming one and the same, they nonetheless further glossed this\ndefinition in terms of being divisible into ever smaller portions\nwithout limit, that is, as being potentially divisible infinitely.\nClearly the notion of the continuous ran afoul of the atomists’\narguments against continua, which we have seen above. In response to\nsuch arguments, the philosophers insisted that a continuous magnitude\nis properly speaking one and unified and as such it is not composed of\nan infinite number of parts and so does not have an actually infinite\nnumber of divisions (e.g., Avicenna 1983, III.2, 8–10). They\nfurther maintained that properly speaking one cannot even say that a\ncontinuous magnitude has an infinite number of potential divisions, at\nleast not in the sense that an infinite number of non-actualized\ndivisions exist latently in the continuous magnitude such that they\ncould ever all come to exist so as to be all actualized at once. For\nthe philosophers, there is no real sense that the divisions are in the\nmagnitude, whether actually or potentially; rather, the sense in which\na continuous magnitude is potentially divisible ad infinitum\nis that one can mentally posit accidental divisions within the\nmagnitude without end. These accidental divisions would be like the\nleft side when pointing to the left, and the right\nside when pointing to the right. There are not real left- and\nright-divisions within the magnitude apart from the positing. In other\nwords, nothing in the magnitude precludes or hinders one from mentally\npositing ever-smaller divisions. For example, think of 1/2, and 1/2\nagain, and so forth; however, those halves are not really or actually\nin the magnitude until unless one goes through the process of mentally\n(or even physically) marking them off. Consequently, when the\nphilosophers say that the continuous is potentially divisible\ninfinitely, they mean that it is impossible to complete the process of\ndivision such that the resultant is an actually infinite number of\nparts. Thus, there is an inherent contradiction in the theologians’\nobjection that if the continuous is potentially divisible infinitely,\nthere must be a power, such as God, that can actualize all the\npotential divisions; for such an argument absurdly entails that what\nby definition cannot be completed is completed. \nHaving shown how the notion of the continuous does not lead to the\nabsurdities presented by the atomists, the philosophers next argued\nthat atomism is itself conceptually incoherent. Perhaps the most\nimportant thing to bear in mind when considering Arabic-speaking\nphilosophers’ arguments against atomism is the nature of the atoms\nthat they want to reject. “Atom” comes from the Greek\natomos and literally means that which cannot be cut or\ndivided. Within the medieval Muslim world, philosophers and\ntheologians alike recognized two sorts of division: “physical\ndivisibility” and “conceptual divisibility.” The\nfirst and true sense of divisibility for Avicenna, physical\ndivisibility, is the form of division that actually brings about a\nseparation and discontinuity within the magnitude. It involves\nphysically dividing a magnitude into two actually distinct parts. The\nsecond type of division, namely, conceptual divisibility, involves\nonly the accidental partition of the magnitude. The parts involved in\nthis type of divisibility are the accidental parts noted above that\nresult from a certain psychological process, namely, division through\nmere positing. As for their critique of atomic theories of magnitude,\nthey came in two general forms: arguments attempting to show that\natomism cannot even approximate our best mathematics and arguments\nattempting to show that the notion of minimal parts that are not even\nconceptually divisible is inadequate to describe certain basic natural\nphenomena. \nThe most common mathematical criticism against atomism was that if\natomism were correct, then one could not even approximate the\nPythagorean theorem, and yet the Pythagorean theorem is the best\nattested theorem in mathematics (e.g., Avicenna 1983, III.4, 190). The\nargument begins by envisioning atomic space something like a\nchessboard, which is a fair approximation of how the theologians did\nthink of atomic space. Next imagine inscribed on this atomic space a\nright isosceles triangle, whose legs are four atoms longs. The length\nof the hypotenuse of the triangle must equal the number of atoms that\nrun down the diagonal of the purported atomic square; however, given\nthat the space is atomic, that length would be only four atoms long.\nNow since according to the Pythagorean theorem the square of the sum\nof the legs should equal the square of hypotenuse, one would have\n42 + 42 = 42, if the space were\natomic, but this is clearly false. Since the absurdity arose from\ntaking jointly the two assumptions that the space is atomic and the\nPythagorean theorem, one of them must be rejected, and the obvious\ncandidate is to deny that there are minimal atomic units of magnitude.\nIt does no good to say that the diagonal of an atom is longer than its\nsides; for such an assumption entails that there are lengths shorter\nthan the smallest part, namely, that amount by which the atom’s\ndiagonal is supposedly longer than its side, but a length shorter than\nthe shortest length is a contradiction. In short, it would seem that\nif the Pythagorean theorem is correct, then the atomism of the\ntheologians is false. \nA second type of argument used against atomism involved showing that\nthat the notion of conceptually minimal parts was philosophically and\nscientifically wanting (e.g., Avicenna 1983, III.4, 189–190).\nThe issue at stake concerned how atoms could be aggregated so as to\ngive rise to the physical bodies that we observe around us. There seem\nto be four possible ways: (1) the atoms could be in succession with\none another, but in no way touching one another; or the atoms could be\ntouching one another, in which case they might do so by being (2)\ncontiguous with one another, (3) continuous with one another, or (4)\ninterpenetrating one another. Clearly the bodies we observe around us\nare unified wholes, that is, their parts are together and so form\nsolids rather than being ‘cloud like.’ Thus the atoms\ncannot merely be in succession. If the atoms were in contact with one\nanother by interpenetrating each other, then bodies would never be\nlarger than a single atom, but again this outcome is empirically\nfalse. Thus, atoms must be in contact by either being contiguous or\ncontinuous with one another. In that case, however, imagine three\natoms, ABC, that are either contiguous with\nor continuous with one another. In this case, B must be\nseparating A from C; for if B were not\nseparating A from C, then, for instance, A\ncould be in contact with C despite B‘s\npresence such that A would in fact be interpenetrating\nB; but this alternative has already been excluded.\nConsequently, there must be something, x, in virtue of which\nB is in contact with A and something, y, in\nvirtue of which B is in contact with C, and\nx and y must be separate from each other, otherwise\nA and C would not be separate from each other. In\nthat case, however, B can be conceptually divided into\nx and y, and yet B was assumed to be a\nconceptually indivisible, and so there is a contradiction. In short,\nthe conceptually indivisible parts of the atomists are inadequate to\nexplain the existence of the physical bodies that we observe around\nus. \nDespite their rejection of conceptually minimal parts, certain Muslim\nphilosophers, following Aristotle (Physics, 1.4,\n187b13–21) and some of this Greek commentators such as John\nPhiloponus (d. 570), conceded that bodies do have physically minimal\nparts. To be exact they recognized minima naturalia, that is\nlimits to how far a specific kind of body, like water or flesh, could\nphysically be divided and still remain that specific kind of body and\nnot instead be converted into some other kind of body (Avicenna, 2009,\nIII.12, 2–9; Averroes, 1962, ad 1.4 & 3.7; for\nstudies see Glasner, 2001 & 2009, ch. 8; Cerami, 2012; McGinnis,\n2015). In order to appreciate one version of their argument for\nminima naturalia (Avicenna 2009, III.12, 8), one must first\nconsider the theory of the elements and elemental change, which it\npresupposes. According to ancient and medieval elemental theory there\nare associated with each of the traditional four elements two primary\nqualities, one each from two pairs. These pairs include the primary\nqualities hot/cold and wet/dry. The element earth is associated with\nthe qualities cold-dry, water with cold-wet, air with hot-wet and fire\nwith hot-dry. These primary qualities are related to the elements’\nmaterial cause. When these primary qualities are altered through a\nprocess of physical causation—that is, there is some motion or\nchange in the element such as an increase or decrease in the degree of\nhotness, coldness, dryness or wetness—the alteration prepares or\npre-disposes the underlying matter so that it is suited to receive a\nnew substantial form. So, for example, when water, which again is\nassociated with a cold-wet combination, is sufficiently heated, the\nunderlying qualitative disposition is no longer suited to the\nsubstantial form of water. Consequently, at some point in the heating\nprocess the matter receives a new substantial form that is compatible\nwith the matter’s new underlying qualitative disposition, namely, the\nmatter receives the form of air. And, indeed, the steam produced from\nvigorously heating water does have a definite air-like quality. An\naccount similar to the one just limned also applies to more complex\ncases of mixtures, like blood, flesh, and seeds, which are involved in\nanimal and plant generation. \nAs for the proof for the existence of minima naturalia\nitself, it begins by repeating that division is spoken of in two ways:\nphysical division—which brings about an actual division,\nseverance or fragmentation of the magnitude—and conceptual\ndivision—which involves a mere mental division or positing that\nleaves the magnitude intact. Again the argument is specifically about\nphysical divisibility. The argument runs thus: The smaller the\nquantity of a given substance the more apt it is to be acted upon by\nsurrounding bodies. So, for example, all things being equal, it takes\nlonger for a body of water to cool down a ton of molten iron than for\nthat same body of water to cool down an ounce of molten iron, and\nsimilarly, a blast furnace is able to heat the same ounce more quickly\nthan the ton. So again the smaller the physical divisions of a given\nsubstance are, the more disposed that reduced quantity of the\nsubstance becomes to the primary qualities of the surrounding bodies.\nBelow a certain limit, the ratio between the strength of the primary\nqualities of the surrounding bodies and those of the body being\ndivided is such that the qualities of the surrounding bodies overcome\nthose of the divided body. At that moment, the divided substance’s\nunderlying qualitative disposition becomes altered so as no longer to\nbe suitable to its elemental form, and the matter receives a new\nsubstantial form. So, for example, imagine a cup of water that is\nsurrounded by hot, dry summer air. Now imagine half that amount of\nwater, and then keep taking halves. At some point the amount of water\nis so small that the water simply evaporates as it were\ninstantaneously, or, as medieval natural philosophers would have it,\nthe form of water in that minuscule physical quantity is immediately\nreplaced with the form of air. In short, for these thinkers the\nelements, as well as more complex mixtures, have natural minima beyond\nwhich they cannot be divided and still be capable of retaining their\nspecies form, for the primary qualities of the surrounding bodies so\nalter that body that it is no longer suitable for sustaining its\ninitial form. There must be, then, the argument concludes, minima\nnaturalia \nAristotle in his Physics (IV 4, 212a2–6) had argued\nthat place is the first motionless limit of a containing body. His\naccount, however, came under heavy criticism from the late Greek\nNeoplatonic thinker John Philoponus. Philoponus asserted that place is\na (finite) three-dimensional extension that though never devoid of\nbody on its own, nonetheless, considered in itself is self-subsistent,\nand so in theory could exist independently of a body. One of the ways\nthat Philoponus defended this thesis was to argue that Aristotle’s\naccount of place was inconsistent with other features of his\nphilosophical system. Aristotle seemed committed to the following\nthree claims: one, if something has a place, then given his definition\nof ‘place’ there must be something else beyond that thing\nthat contains it; two, once approximately every twenty-four hours the\noutermost celestial sphere makes a complete westward rotation; and\nthree, there are only three generic types of motion: motion with\nrespect to (1) place, (2) quantity and (3) quality. Given these\nbeliefs, Philoponus posed the following dilemma. Either the universe\nas a whole has a place or it does not. If it has a place, then\nAristotle’s definition of place is wrong since there is nothing beyond\nthe universe itself that contains it. If the universe as a whole does\nnot have a place, then Philoponus asks, “In what respect does\nthe outermost celestial sphere move during the course of its diurnal\nmotion?” Again the motion either could be (1) with respect to\nthe category of place (as when something undergoes locomotion), (2)\nwith respect to the category of quantity (as when something grows or\nshrinks) or (3) with respect to the category of quality (as when\nsomething changes color or temperature and the like). Clearly the\nuniverse’s diurnal motion is not with respect to either of the\ncategories of quantity or quality, and thus it must be with respect to\nplace; however, in this horn of the dilemma it was assumed that the\nuniverse has no place, and so there is a contradiction. Although\nPhiloponus had other arguments for his belief that place is the space\noccupied by a body, this dilemma is the one that most exercised\nsubsequent Arabic-speaking natural philosophers. \nVirtually all Arabic-speaking philosophers adopted Aristotle’s account\nof place as the limit of a containing body, and so the challenge was\nto explain whether the universe as a whole has a place and in what\nsense it can be said to move. There were two approaches to this issue:\none was to deny that the universe had a place and then explain in what\nsense it could be said to move, while the other was to assert that the\nuniverse has a place and then show how its having a place is\nconsistent with Aristotle’s definition of place. Avicenna represents\nthe first approach, whereas Ibn Bajja and Averroes (and it would also\nseem al-Farabi) took the second approach. \nSo for instance, Avicenna denied that the universe has a place, but he\nlikewise further denied that the list of the types of motion exploited\nby Philoponus in his dilemma is exhaustive: one must further add to\nthat list, maintained Avicenna, motion with respect to the category of\nposition (Avicenna 1983, II.3, 103–105.13; McGinnis 2006b).\nAccording to Avicenna, then, all cases of rectilinear motion, that is,\nmotion from some spatial point x to a distinct spatial point\ny, are cases of motion with respect to the category of place,\nwhereas all cases of spinning or rotating, where the moving object\ndoes not depart from a given spatial location, are cases of motion\nwith respect to the category of position. Since the universe during\nits daily rotation does not depart from one spatial location to\nanother it does not need a place and yet it can still move albeit with\nrespect to the category of position, concluded Avicenna. \nA contrasting approach is that of Ibn Bajja, who we are told followed\nal-Farabi; this position would also be the one that Averroes in\ngeneral would adopt, albeit with certain reservations and\nmodifications (Lettinck 1984, 297–302; Averroes 1962,\n141E–144I). Ibn Bajja begins by slightly modifying Aristotle’s\ndefinition of place; instead of being the first containing\nlimit, place is now identified with ‘the proximate\nsurrounding surface.’ The shift in language is slight,\nbut it allows Ibn Bajja the opportunity to distinguish between two\nsenses of ‘surrounding surface.’ Things can either be\nsurrounded by a concave or convex surface, maintained Ibn Bajja. A\nRectilinear body, that is, a body that undergoes rectilinear motion,\nhas as its place a concave surface that is outside of it, whereas a\ntruly spherical body, that is, a body that undergoes circular motion\nor rotation, has as its place a convex surface, which is inside of the\nrotating body and is in fact the surface of the center around which\nthe body rotates. Since the universe rotates around the earth, at\nleast according to ancient and medieval cosmology, the universe is\n‘surrounded’ by the earth at the earth’s convex surface,\nand thus the universe as a whole has a place, namely, the surface of\nthe earth. Averroes’ modifications make the surface of the earth only\nthe accidental place of the universe rather than the essential place,\nbut since Aristotle had spoken of the universe’s having a place only\naccidentally, the Commentator was satisfied. \nNatural philosophers writing in Islamic lands did not necessarily\ndefend Aristotle’s account of place against Philoponus’ critique out\nof a slavish adherence to Aristotle, but because Philoponus’\nalternative account of place entailed that there could be a void\nspace, and most Arabic-speaking philosophers thought that the\nexistence of the void was both physically impossible as well as\nconceptually incoherent. Aristotle himself had presented numerous\nphysical impossibilities associated with a void, whereas\nArabic-speaking philosophers explored the conceptually incoherent\naspect of the notion of a void in order to show that its existence is\nimpossible. For example, in On First Philosophy al-Kindi\nobserved that the meaning of ‘void’ is a place in which\nnothing is placed; however, he continued, place and being something\nplaced are correlative terms neither of which proceeds the other, and\nso if there is a place, there must be something placed, and if there\nis something placed, there must be a place. Consequently there cannot\nbe a place without something placed in it. Again, however, a place\nwithout something placed in it is precisely what is meant by\n‘void.’ Therefore, concluded al-Kindi, it is impossible\nthat an absolute void exists (al-Kindi 1950, 109). \nAl-Farabi in a small treatise on the void took a similar approach, but\nnow from the direction of what is meant by ‘body’\n(al-Farabi 1951). He begins by considering an experiment that might\nlead one to conclude that a void exists. The experiment involves\nsucking air out of a vial and then placing one’s finger on the mouth\nof the vial. One next inverts the vial into a bowl of water and then\nremoves the finger from the mouth of the vial. A certain amount of\nwater will be attracted into the vial, and so one might conclude that\na void space proportional to the amount of water drawn into the vial\nwas present while one’s finger was over the mouth of the vial. The\nconclusion does not follow, argued al-Farabi; for he believed that one\nmust concede that the purported void space in the vial has a certain\nvolume, but since volume just is a body possessing length, breadth and\ndepth, there must be a body in the purported void\n space.[8]\n In this respect al-Farabi was simply following the standard\ndefinition of ‘body’ as whatever possesses three\ndimensions; however, he also suggested that there is something\nincoherent about considering void as some sort of absolute nothingness\npossessing three dimensions, since there is no coherent sense in which\nnothingness could be the subject for the accidental qualities of\nlength, breadth and\n depth.[9]\n Given these considerations against the void, continued al-Farabi, one\nshould conclude from the above experiment that the volume of air\nexpanded, and consequently a smaller amount of air now occupies the\nsame amount of space. In other words, the particular volume that a\nbody possesses, and particularly in the case or air, is not essential\nto that body, and so given the right causal factors or conditions a\nbody’s volume can expand or decrease. Al-Farabi’s suggestion here was\nto become the standard among Arabic-speaking natural philosophers when\ndealing with purportedly artificially manufactured voids. \nLike so many issues in natural philosophy, philosophers working in the\nfalsafa tradition took their lead concerning temporal topics\nfrom Aristotle. Thus most Arabic-speaking philosophers defined time as\nthe measure of motion with respect to priority and\n posteriority.[10]\n Although a number of the most discussed issues and problems\nassociated with time concerned the eternity of the world, and so in a\nsense belonged to metaphysics, there were some pressing questions\nconcerning the nature of time that remained wholly in the domain of\nnatural philosophy. Arguably the most important of these physical\nquestion concerned clarifying which motion or motions time measures.\nAverroes presented the problem at stake nicely in an extended\ndigression his Long Commentary on the Physics (Averroes 1962,\n178F-179I). \nAverroes began by asking whether time is associated with every motion\nor just one special motion. If time were associated with, and indeed\ngenerated by, every motion, then there would be as many times as there\nwere motions, and yet it seems immediately obvious that there is but a\nsingle time. Thus it would seem that time must be associated with just\none special motion; and indeed virtually everyone in the Aristotelian\ntradition, going back to at least Alexander of Aphrodisias, if not\nAristotle himself, did associate time with one special motion, namely,\nthe motion of the heavens. Now, continued Averroes, if time were\nuniquely associated with this and only this motion, then one’s sensing\nand being aware of time would be associated with one’s sensing and\nbeing aware of the heavens’ motion. Consequently, should someone have\nnever sensed that motion, such as Plato’s prisoners in the cave from\nthe Republic, that person would be wholly unaware of time,\nand such a conclusion simply seems false. In fact, Averroes\ngeneralized his argument to include all special motions that exist\noutside of our souls. Hence it would seem that the motion in question\nin the definition of time must refer to a psychological motion, that\nis, some motion that our souls undergo. The difficulty with this\nsuggestion, Averroes concluded, is twofold: first, it implies that\nthere is no time outside the soul, and second, since there will be as\nmany psychological motions as there are souls, we have returned to our\ninitial difficulty of the existence of multiple times. \nAverroes’ solution is to say that our awareness of time is first and\nessentially our awareness of ourselves inasmuch as we have undergone\nsome sort of change. We are in turn aware that we have undergone some\nsort of change by being aware of two different moments, as for\nexample, I am aware that the moment at which I first began to write\nthis account is different from the present moment, in which case I am\naware that I have undergone some sort of change. Our undergoing\nchange, however, Averroes quickly added, only results from the\nheavens’ undergoing motion, and should per impossibile the\nheavens cease moving, then we would no longer undergo change.\nConsequently, although our awareness of time is associated immediately\nwith our undergoing change, and so we can be aware of time even though\nwe are not aware of any particular extra-mental motion, time itself is\nassociated with the motion of the heavens that is the ultimate cause\nof our undergoing motion, and so time is one and not multiplied. \nAnother temporal issue that was clearly of interest to natural\nphilosophers in Islamic lands concerned time’s topography: “Is\nit finite or infinite?” and “Is it\n‘rectilinear’ or ‘cyclical’?” Among the\nArabic-speaking philosophers, al-Kindi was virtually alone in\naffirming the finitude of time; most others philosophers argued that\ntime must necessarily be infinite in that it could have no beginning.\nHow various philosophers argued for this thesis reveals that both\nrectilinear and cyclical conceptions of time were present within the\nfalsafa tradition, where Avicenna advocates a rectilinear\nconception of time and Averroes a cyclical conception of time. \nAgain the area where this issue arose concerned proofs for the\neternity of time. So, for example, in a novel proof for the existence\nof time based upon differences in the amount of distance that can be\ncovered by slower and faster moving objects, Avicenna linked time with\na possibility or capacity (imkan) for motion (Avicenna 1985,\n228–229). He then argued by means of a reducto ad\nabsurdum. He has us assume that time is finite, and so the motion\nof the universe must have some first moment when it began. Even if the\nmotion of the universe began at some first moment, the argument\ncontinues, clearly there would still have been the possibility for the\nCreator of the world to make a motion that extended further back. In\nthat case, there is a capacity or possibility for motion that precedes\nthe purported first moment, but time according to Avicenna is again\njust a certain capacity or possibility for motion. Thus a time would\nhave preceded the purported first moment, which is absurd. Since the\nsame argument applies to any purported first moment of time, concluded\nAvicenna, time can have no beginning and so must be infinite. Clearly,\nthe conception of time implicit in Avicenna’s argument is that of a\ntemporal line stretching back infinitely. \nAverroes too provided an argument for time’s having no beginning, but\nnow in terms of conceiving time as a circle (Averroes 1991, question\nIII). As was explained above, for Averroes time is a consequence and\nmeasure of the circular motion of the heavens and so is itself\ncircular. Now just as any point on a circle is both a beginning and\nending of some arc on the circle, so any moment assumed in time must\nbe a beginning and ending of some period of time. Consequently time\nhas no beginning. That it should have no beginning, however, is not in\nthe sense that a straight line has no beginning, but in the sense that\nno point on a circle can be said to be the beginning of the circle.\nAlthough Averroes did not explicitly claim that all events and thing\nwill come around again, his argument does seem to imply such a\nconclusion. \nAs noted most of those working in the falsafa tradition drew\ntheir inspiration from Aristotle and his later commentators, the most\nnotable exception was the independent philosopher-physician Abu Bakr\nar-Razi (ca. 864–925 or 930), whose natural philosophy and cosmology\nhappily drew upon Arabic versions of Plato’s Timeaus as well\nas certain non-Greek sources. Ar-Razi maintained that there were five\neternals: (1) the Creator, (2) the Universal Soul, (3) prime matter,\n(4) absolute time and (5) absolute space (understood as something like\nvoid space) (ar-Razi 1939, 195–215). The first three eternal\nprinciples find their counterparts in the natural philosophy of the\nNeoplatonizing Aristotelians in the Islamic world, whereas it is the\nlast two notions that truly set ar-Razi apart from other medieval\nnatural philosophers. \nFor all of the philosophers we have treated time and place are\nrelative terms, which respectively depend on a motion and a situated\nthing for their very existence. In contrast, ar-Razi argued that one\nhad to distinguish between the relative conception of these notions\nand the absolute conception. Thus he distinguished between time (a\nrelative temporal notion) and duration (an absolute temporal notion)\nas well as between place (a relative spatial notion) and void (an\nabsolute spatial notion). As absolute both duration and void are\nsubstances in the sense that they have an existence independent of\nanything else and thus in principle could exist if everything else\nfailed to exist. \nAs for the eternity of duration, ar-Razi noted that time (the relative\ntemporal notion) is constantly perishing and coming to be inasmuch as\nall past time has ceased to be, while future time is constantly coming\nto be. In this case, time itself is changing, but every change\nrequires a duration during which it changes. If this duration itself\nunderwent change, there would need to be a further duration and so on\ninfinitely. To stop the regress ar-Razi posited an unchanging\nduration, which is itself the precondition for the measured time of\nthose philosophers following Aristotle. \nAs for absolute space or void, we have seen how the Arabic-speaking\nphilosophers had closely linked place with something placed in it. Now\nif the space and what is placed in it were essentially correlatives as\nthe philosophers maintained, then, argued ar-Razi, by imagining the\ndestruction of one correlate, one must likewise imaging the\ndestruction of the other. Let one imagine the destruction of the\nuniverse. The notion of void or empty space, claimed ar-Razi, is not\ndestroyed along with imagined destruction of everything occupying it.\nThus void and what is placed in it are not correlatives like the\nphilosophers claimed. Hence one must distinguish between the notion of\nvoid space, which is not destroyed when one imagines the destruction\nof the universe, and the notion of place, which is destroyed when one\nimagines the destruction of the universe. The former is absolute,\nwhereas only the latter is relative.","contact.mail":"mcginnis@umsl.edu","contact.domain":"umsl.edu"}]
