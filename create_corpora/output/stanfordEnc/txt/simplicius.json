[{"date.published":"2020-06-03","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicius/","author1":"Christoph Helmig","entry":"simplicius","body.text":"\n\n\nSimplicius of Cilicia (ca. 480–560 CE), roughly a contemporary\nof John Philoponus, is without doubt the most important Neoplatonic\ncommentator on Aristotle and one of the two most influential exegetes\nwithin the Aristotelian tradition, along with Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(around 200 CE). Simplicius’ works are an unmatched source for\nthe intellectual traditions that preceded him: Presocratic, Platonic,\nand especially the Peripatetic tradition. He is also an independent\nthinker in his own right, with a coherent philosophical agenda. Best\nknown for his tendency to harmonise Plato and Aristotle, he\nnevertheless criticised Aristotle on several occasions and considered\nhimself a loyal follower of Plato. Writing in an age when Christianity\nwas the dominant religious and political view, Simplicius aimed to\nshow that the Hellenic tradition is not only much older, but also more\nvenerable and more coherent than the Christian tradition. Unimpressed\nby charges of alleged contradictions among Greek philosophers,\nSimplicius repeatedly proclaimed that “the ancient wisdom\n(palaia philosophia) remains unrefuted” (In\nPhys. 77.11). It is also noteworthy that, like Proclus and other\nNeoplatonists, Simplicius presents himself as a thinker for whom\nphilosophy and theology form a complete unity. As has frequently been\nobserved, Simplicius’ works, despite their scholarly outlook,\nhave an important spiritual dimension (see\n §5).\n \n\nSimplicius’ commentaries have only recently been studied with an\neye to his own philosophical views. He was long considered a mere\nsource for Greek philosophy, and, as noted by Baltussen (2010: 714),\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplicius’ importance as a source for ancient Greek philosophy\nand science has long overshadowed his contributions as an independent\nthinker. \n\n\n\nNineteenth-century Quellenforschung was especially interested\nin his Commentary on the Physics, which was edited in two\nvolumes (Simplicii in Aristotelis Physicorum libros quattuor\npriores/quattuor posteriores, comprising almost 1500 pages) by\nHermann Diels; this commentary served as the basis for Diels’\nedition of the Doxographi Graeci (Greek\nDoxographers), which includes the main doctrines on natural\nphilosophy according to ancient doxographical compendia.\n\n\nOne of the aims of this entry is to emphasise that Simplicius’\nwritings have much more to offer than a mere doxography of his\npredecessors—but always bearing in mind that it is only possible\nto appreciate how Simplicius arranges and interprets the material at\nhis disposal by duly attending to his Neoplatonic agenda.\n\nNot much is known about Simplicius’ life. In Histories\nII, 30.1 [Keydell], Agathias informs us\nthat Simplicius was born in Cilicia (south coastal region of Asia\nMinor; today southern Turkey, north to northeast of the island\nCyprus). According to Simplicius’ own commentaries, he was\neducated in Alexandria by Ammonius, son of Hermias (In Cael.\n271.19), and in Athens by Damascius (In Phys. 601.19). Hence,\nhe refers to Proclus as “teacher of my teachers” (In\nPhys. 611.11–12; 795.4–5) and “successor of\nPlato (diadochos, i.e., head of the school) who lived shortly\nbefore me” (In Cael. 640.24–25). The following\ntext from Simplicius’ Commentary on the Physics\nillustrates well the important role that Proclus played in the\ntradition of Athenian Neoplatonism: \nAll the philosophers after Proclus and down to my time, more or less,\nfollowed Proclus not only on this detail, but in all the other dogmas,\nexcept for Asclepiodorus, Proclus’ most gifted student, and our\nDamascius. The former because of his immense talent, took pleasure in\ninnovating in doctrinal matters, whereas Damascius, because of his\nlove of work and his sympathy for Iamblichus, was not afraid to\nreconsider many of Proclus’ dogmas. (Simplicius, In\nPhys. 795.11–17, translated by I. Hadot and M. Chase, in I.\nHadot 2015: 126 n. 223 \nSeveral passages in Simplicius’ commentaries also testify to the\ncrucial role that Iamblichus’ philosophy and exegesis played for\nhim (see\n §1\n and\n §5 in the supplement on “The Commentaries of Simplicius”).\n Simplicius’ controversy with the Christian commentator\nPhiloponus, who taught in Alexandria, regarding whether the world was\ncreated in time (see\n §3 in the supplement on “The Commentaries of Simplicius”) is well known. However, it seems that they never met personally\n(“[I] feel no hostility against this man whom, to my knowledge,\nI have never seen”; In Cael. 26.18–19, translated\nby C. Wildberg). \nIn 529, a year that some historians have considered the end of\nAntiquity, emperor Justinian ordered that “no one was any longer\nallowed to teach philosophy and astronomy” (this is often\nreferred to as the closure of the Platonic Academy; for details and\nfurther literature see Goulet & Coda 2016: 344). It is assumed\nthat this edict mainly targeted non-Christian philosophers such as\nNeoplatonists and Manichaeans. Following this prohibition, but not\nimmediately, Simplicius travelled with six other Neoplatonic\nphilosophers under the lead of Damascius to the court of the Persian\nKing Chosroes, who had only come to power in Ctesiphon in 531.\nDisappointed by their experience in Persia—the historian\nAgathias suggests that the philosophers at first considered Chosroes a\nkind of ideal Platonic philosopher king—and protected by a peace\ntreaty between Persia and Rome in 532, the philosophers left the\ncountry, apparently several months after their arrival. Where the\nseven went after that is still a matter of debate. The treaty says,\ninter alia, that  \nthese men should be allowed to return to their own country and live\nthere henceforth in safety, without being forced to adopt opinions\nwhich they did not hold, or to change their own faith. (translated by\nA. Cameron 1969/1970: 169)  \nDamascius recorded that he returned in 538 to his home country of\nSyria (Hoffmann 1994: 590–591). Did the others follow him, or\ndid they return to Athens, Syria, or Harran (ancient Carrhae, in the\nnorth of Mesopotamia, close to the Syrian border)? This question has\nnot been satisfactorily answered (for the ongoing discussion, see\nGoulet & Coda 2016: 343–346; Watts 2005: 290–298).\nHowever, it seems clear that, in order to write his\ncommentaries—which, as most scholars assume, were composed after\nreturning from Chosroes’ court (I. Hadot 2014:\n135)—Simplicius needed quite an extensive library. Therefore, he\ncould only have returned to a place that provided such a library. \nSimplicius wrote four commentaries that survive today (on\nEpictetus’ Handbook and Aristotle’s\nCategories, Physics, and De Caelo). It is\ndebatable whether, as univocally attested by the all manuscripts,\nSimplicius is also the author of a fifth commentary, on\nAristotle’s De anima. Although there are several other\nworks that he might have written, these do not include any\ncommentaries on Plato aside from one work on the Phaedo\n(Goulet & Coda 2016: 361–364, 390–394; see In\nCael. 369.4–6 and In Epict. I, 350–354\n[Hadot]). As is discussed in the supplement\n The Commentaries of Simplicius, it is\n difficult to determine the order and periods in which Simplicius\n composed his commentaries. \nAlthough there are no extant commentaries on Plato that are known to\ncome from Simplicius’ hand, Simplicius’ readers will\nnotice his intimate familiarity with and highest esteem for Plato.\nSimplicius’ commentaries constitute a rich source for Platonic\nphilosophy, and he is well known for his tendency to harmonise Plato\nand Aristotle (see\n §6).\n His work continues a tendency, probably initiated by Porphyry, to\nmake Plato’s pupil an integral part of the Platonic tradition,\nreading Aristotle through Platonic—or rather\nNeoplatonic—lenses. Simplicius frequently chooses a Platonic\ndialogue in order to compare Plato’s and Aristotle’s\nphilosophy in a specific domain by way of contrast—for example,\nwhen he comments on the Physics and the De Caelo,\nwhere the Timaeus is always at hand. The Sophist and\nhis the doctrine of the highest kinds (megista genê)\nplay an important role in Simplicius’ commentary on the\nCategories (cf. already in Plotinus VI 1–3\n[42–44]). It should also be noted that Iamblichus’\nNeoplatonic psychology, which can be considered a systematisation of\nPlato’s views, lies in the background throughout\nthe Commentary on the De anima. When Simplicius finds\nreferences to Eleatic philosophy in Aristotle (especially in\nPhysics I), the Sophist and Parmenides also\nfigure prominently. \nIt is also important to identify Simplicius’ purpose and\nintended audience in writing his compendious exegetical works. Given\nthe sheer size of the commentaries and their argumentative structure,\nwhich at times is rather complex, it is difficult to imagine that\nSimplicius is aiming at students. Moreover, given the uneven length of\nthe exegeses of specific lemmata and the considerable number\nof so-called digressions (see\n §2),\n it is not clear how a teacher could organise the material in the\ncommentaries for a series of lessons. To be suitable for the\nclassroom, Simplicius’ style would have needed to be much more\ndidactic and elementary. Although Baltussen (2010: 717) maintains that\n \nSimplicius writes mostly for a student audience and that his works are\nintended to be read (In Cael. 377.32, 653.9; In\nPhys. 111.17, 762.29),  \nthis seems unlikely. Rather, his underlying incentive seems to be to\npreserve as much original material (from Aristotle, his predecessors,\nand his commentators) as possible and to present it in a way that\nbrings the unity of the Hellenic tradition to the fore. This would\nexplain why Simplicius continuously reminds his readers not only of\nthe harmony (sumphônia) between Plato and Aristotle,\nwith Aristotle as a loyal member of the Platonic tradition, but also\nthe continuity of Aristotle with the Presocratics, especially the\nPythagoreans and the Eleatics. There are several indications in\nSimplicius’ collective text that he is addressing readers of\n“considerable sophistication” (Bowen 2013: 5) and that the\ntarget audience, as should be suspected given his use of the first\nperson plural, is  \ncontemporary Platonists in some community (to which he did or did not\nbelong) or […] readers imagined to be of like mind in a\ncounterfactual present. (2013: 5)  \nThis fully accords with the view that Simplicius probably did not\nteach in any school and that when he wrote his commentaries, there was\ntherefore no philosophical curriculum. As Golitsis (2018: 95) has\nconvincingly suggested,  \n[T]here was no place where they [sc. the Platonic philosophers] could\nbe trained […]. Simplicius invites them to learn by themselves\nor, if possible, in groups. (see In Cat. 7.33–8.2) \nWhat makes Simplicius’ commentaries a unique source for the\nhistory of philosophy before him is the fact that he preserved so much\nmaterial from his predecessors, often in verbatim quotations: \n[…] Simplicius, clearly aware of the fact that the works of\nmany philosophers earlier, contemporary with, and later than Aristotle\nwere in danger of disappearing made a point of quoting from them at\nlength. And so he has often preserved for us texts and information not\nextant elsewhere. Suffice it to mention, by way of example, the\nfragments of Anaximander, Parmenides, Zeno, Melissus, Empedocles,\nAnaxagoras, Theophrastus (especially his History of\nPhilosophy or Physikôn Doxai), Eudemus (especially\nhis History of Geometry), Xenocrates, Epicurus, The Stoics,\nPorphyry, etc. It is noteworthy that in the case of the Presocratics\nSimplicius alone has preserved at least two thirds of all the verbatim\nquotations. (Tarán 1987b: 247) \nIn his introduction to the Commentary on the Categories,\nSimplicius provides a neat characterisation of the good commentator\n(axion exêgêtên) on Aristotle (and\nPlato): \nThe worthy exegete of Aristotle’s writings must not fall wholly\nshort of the latter’s greatness of intellect\n(megalonoia). He must also have experience of everything the\nPhilosopher has written, and must be an expert\n(epistemôn) of Aristotle’s customary use of\nlanguage (sunêtheia). His judgement must be impartial\n(adekaston), so that he may neither, out of misplaced zeal,\nseek to prove something well said to be unsatisfactory, nor, if some\npoint should require attention, should he obstinately persist in\ntrying to demonstrate that [Aristotle] is always and everywhere\ninfallible, as if he had enrolled himself in the Philosopher’s\nschool. [The good exegete] must, I believe, not convict the\nphilosophers of discordance (diaphônia) by looking only\nat the letter (lexis) of what [Aristotle] says against Plato;\nbut he must look towards the spirit (nous), and track down\n(anikhneuein) the harmony (sumphônia) which\nreigns between them on the majority of points. (Simplicius, In\nCat. 7.23–32, translated by M. Chase, slightly\nmodified) \nThis is certainly one of the most interesting passages for those\ntrying to understand the Simplicius’ view of the role of the\ncommentator. The passage can, with caution, be considered a kind of\nself-portrait of the Neoplatonic commentator at work, a glimpse into\nhis workshop, as it were. The good commentator must (1) be able to\nunderstand and follow Aristotle’s arguments (“greatness of\nintellect”). He must (2) have read all of Aristotle’s\nworks and must know his terminology and ways of expressing himself\n(“customary use of language”). This is required in order\nto explain “Aristotle by means of Aristotle” (see\n[Pseudo-?]Simplicius, In de Anima 1.14–15, and\nElias/David, In Cat. 123.7–11) and show that he does\nnot contradict himself. The good commentator must also (3) be\nimpartial, that is, not openly polemical against Aristotle and merely\nscoring points, but at the same time not an uncritical enthusiast.\nSimplicius illustrates this elsewhere with his well-known saying,\n“amicus Plato vel Aristoteles, sed magis amica\nveritas” (“Plato or Aristotle are dear to me, but\nmuch dearer is the truth”; see Tarán 1984 and In\nCael. 301.19–21 [about Alexander]). In other words, it is\ncertainly legitimate to criticise Aristotle. But things are different\nwith respect to Plato, because it seems that Simplicius never\ncriticised him. Finally, the good commentator must (4) strive for\nharmony in most cases, by means of a distinction between the\nsuperficial sense of a text (lexis) and its true or deeper\nmeaning (nous). \nIn order to forge a clearer profile of the commentator, it will be\nuseful to compare him to other Aristotelian commentators, such as\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Iamblichus, David, and Elias. The\nNeoplatonists certainly did not consider Alexander to be an impartial\ncommentator on Aristotle. Rather, Simplicius often treats him as\nsomeone who stands in firm opposition to the harmony of Plato and\nAristotle. As good a text as any to characterise Alexander’s\nattitude towards Aristotle can be found in the opening words of his\nDe anima: \nJust as I have great reverence for Aristotle’s works on other\nsubjects, since I find more truth in the views passed down from him\nthan in what others have claimed, I regard what he states in his\ntheory of the soul in the same way as well. I will therefore have\nfulfilled my aim if I can set out his claims about the soul as clearly\nas possible and offer suitable arguments to show how each of them is\nwell formulated. (Alexander, De anima 2.4–9 [Bruns],\ntranslated by V. Caston) \nOn the other hand, the Neoplatonists viewed Iamblichus as someone who\nbrought Plato and Aristotle too close together. A text from Philoponus\npoints to interpreters who argued that the two even agreed on the\nnature of universals: \nThus, also Proclus plainly and openly agrees with us about the\ndifference of the two philosophers [sc. as regards the status of\nuniversals], or rather he has demonstrated it from the words/writings\nof Aristotle himself. From this one can only wonder about the\novershooting amount of shamelessness among those who try to show that\nAristotle and Plato did agree also in this point. (Philoponus, De\naeternitate mundi 32.8–13 [Rabe], trans. by author) \nIt is very likely that Iamblichus was among these interpreters. We\nknow from elsewhere that he even saw agreement regarding the theory of\nForms (Elias/David, In Cat. 123.1–3). Along the same\nlines, Simplicius seems to have reconciled Aristotle’s\ncomparison of the soul with an empty writing tablet (De anima\nIII 4, 429b31–430a2) and Plato’s theory of innate\nknowledge (de Haas 2000, 169–170). \nWas Simplicius impartial towards Plato? This is insisted upon, for\ninstance, by Elias/David (In Cat. 122.27–32), but not,\nat least not explicitly, by Simplicius. As noted above, Simplicius is\nprepared to criticise Aristotle time and again (for instance, in his\ndigression on place [topos]), but he never seems to criticise\nPlato. For Simplicius, Plato is the one who brought the truth to\nlight, the explainer or interpreter of the truth (ho tês\nalêtheias exêgêtês, In Cael.\n131.1), but Aristotle is never granted such an honorary title (cf.\nSyrianus’ and Proclus’ distinction between a “divine\nPlato”and a (merely) “daimonic/semi-divine\nAristotle”). Therefore, one may surmise that Plato was not\nsubject to the impartiality requirement, since he was, compared to all\nother representatives of the ancient philosophical tradition (hoi\npalaioi), somehow closest to the truth. \nIf one were to name a single commentator apart from Simplicius’\nNeoplatonic sources (esp. Porphyry and Iamblichus) who mostly strongly\nshaped his commentaries, it would undoubtedly be Alexander of\nAphrodisias (around 200 CE): \n[It is] profitable for those who choose to understand and explain\nAristotle’s thought by way of Alexander’s commentaries, to\nexamine what he said. (Simplicius, In Cael. 297.8–10,\ntranslated by J. Hankinson) \nBaltussen used this telling quotation to preface the chapter on\nAlexander of Aphrodisias in his monograph on Simplicius (2008: 107).\nIt illustrates rather well that Simplicius by no means blindly\nfollowed “the commentator” (ho\nexêgêtês), as he calls him (In Phys.\n1170.2, In Cael. 121.12 and 700.9), but was eager to\ncarefully examine what Alexander had to say. It is known, for\ninstance, that Simplicius had direct access to Alexander’s\ncommentaries on the Physics, the Heavens, and the\nCategories. All of these are now lost, but a good deal can be\nreconstructed based on Simplicius’ testimony (see the overview\nin Kupreeva [2018: 387-388 and 443]). It can even be said without exaggeration that\nlarge parts of Simplicius’ oeuvre are, in fact, extended\nconversations with “Aristotle’s most famous exegete”\n(Baltussen 2016: 1). While Simplicius owes much to Alexander, his\nattitude towards him is ambiguous and comparable to how Syrianus deals\nwith Alexander’s Commentary on the Metaphysics.\nSyrianus focuses especially on those passages where Aristotle attacks\nPythagorean-Platonic metaphysics (esp. in books 13 and 14 of the\nMetaphysics), but in other cases, Alexander’s comments\nsuffice (O’Meara & Dillon 2008: 5). In other words,\nAlexander’s comments generally have great value; he is the more\ngenuine (gnêsiôteros) commentator on Aristotle\n(In Phys. 80.15–16), especially as far as the\nPeripatetic tradition is concerned. Moreover, while Aristotle is the\nmost genuine disciple of Plato (gnêsiôtatos),\nAlexander is the “most careful of Aristotle’s\npartisans” (epimelestatos spoudastês, In\nCael. 378.20–22, borrowing the translation from\nMueller). \nOn the other hand, Alexander of Aphrodisias can also be a stumbling\nblock for integrating Aristotle into the Platonic tradition. This is\nreflected in several passages where Simplicius remarks on\nAlexander’s way of explaining Aristotle and, more specifically,\nhis attitude towards Plato. For while Simplicius as a rule tries to\nexplain away critical remarks that Aristotle aimed at his teacher, for\ninstance, via the distinction between the superficial meaning of a\ntext (lexis, to phainomenon) and its real purpose\n(dianoia, nous), Alexander always sides with\nAristotle against Plato: \nIt is my opinion that Alexander of Aphrodisias obviously understands\nthe words of Aristotle well on other occasions—and does so\nbetter than the other Peripatetics, but, in the case of the things\nwhich Aristotle says concerning Plato, he does not seem to me to bear\nin mind that Aristotle’s counter-arguments are directed at the\nsurface import of Plato’s statements (pros to\nphainomenon). But, contesting Plato frivolously\n(kakoscholôs) in a way, he tries not only, as Aristotle\nalso does, to refute the surface import of what Plato says, taking\nsimpler <people> into consideration, but he also attacks the\nideas (tas ennoias) of the divine Plato and tries to draw\nconsequences from what Plato says, frequently not even attending to\nthe surface import. \nConsequently I, setting out the truth, which is dear to god and to\nAristotle, will here try to do a careful investigation, putting\nforward the things which Alexander says are the opinions of Plato\nabout the motion of the soul. I do this because of those who deal with\nhis words in a more superficial way and dare to take from them in a\nway which is hostile to the views of Plato, which is the same as to\nsay hostile to the opinions of Aristotle and to divine truth.\n(Simplicius, In Cael. 377.20–34, translated by I.\nMueller) \nBut Alexander von Aphrodisias does not understand Plato’s\ndoctrines as Aristotle understood them, nor does he accept that their\nviews are in agreement (sumphônia) […].\n(Simplicius, In Cael. 297.1–4, translated by R. J.\nHankinson) \nI have said these things against Alexander for, while I respect the\nman and wish him well, I think that honouring the truth the more is\ndear to him too. (Simplicius, In Cael. 301.19–21,\ntranslated by R. J. Hankinson) \nBut Alexander, although he is accustomed to drag in Plato even where\nhe is quite irrelevant, for some reason has here forgotten Plato\ninstead. (Simplicius, In Phys. 560.11–13, translated by\nJ. O. Urmson) \nThe Neoplatonic commentaries of late Antiquity represent rather\nsophisticated readings of Plato and Aristotle, integrating a rich\nprehistory of exegesis and philosophical debate, but also structured\naccording to certain well-defined rules and methods. Since Simplicius\ncomes almost at the end of this tradition, his commentaries are also a\nrepository from which such constituent parts of Platonic exegetical\npractices can be reconstructed. Generally speaking, both ancient and\nmedieval commentators share a nondevelopmentalist approach to their\nauthors and treat single works as part of a greater philosophical\nwhole or system. Simplicius’ main aim is to clarify the\nAristotelian text, explain Aristotle by means of his own writings, and\ndemonstrate the harmony of Plato, Aristotle and older pre-Socratic\ntraditions. \nSeveral elements are characteristic of Simplicius’ commentaries.\nAll are lemmatised, that is, Aristotle’s (or Epictetus’)\ntext is divided into smaller sections of text which are then commented\nupon, and the commentaries are introduced with prologues of varying\nlengths (see below for more details). The comments on a single lemma\nare sometimes subdivided into two sections, one which mainly comments\non the philosophical content (theôria) and one which\ncomments on single expressions or words (lexis). Such a\ndistinction goes back to Proclus (Festugière 1963 [1971]).\nSince the commentaries are probably not written for teaching purposes\n(see\n §1),\n they are not structured according to “lessons”\n(praxeis), as was the usual practice in the Alexandrian\nschool after Ammonius. Digressions or autonomous essays that interrupt\nthe running commentary are also characteristic of Simplicius (see\nGolitsis 2008a and\n §2.3 in the supplement “The Commentaries of Simplicius”).\n Like Aristotle, Simplicius frequently integrates longer doxographies.\nAt times, he approaches philosophical issues through the method of\n“difficulties and solutions” (aporiai kai\nluseis), which can frequently be found in Damascius,\nSimplicius’ teacher, and ultimately goes back to Aristotle (cf.\nMetaphysics Beta, with its long list of aporiai).\nFrom Iamblichus, Simplicius borrows the policy that each of\nPlato’s and Aristotle’s works should be explained by first\nestablishing its main, overarching topics (skopos) which hold\nall the parts together: \nFor the goal (skopos), once correctly identified, defines and\nrectifies our thought (dianoia), so that we are not vainly\ntransported about in every direction, but refer everything to it.\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 8.13–15, translated by Michael\nChase) \nA common practice among later Neoplatonists was to preface their\ncommentaries with a series of questions or preliminary points\n(kephalaia) that should be settled before embarking on the\nexegesis proper (Hadot & Hoffmann 1990: 21–160; Hoffmann\n1998; Mansfeld 1994; for an excellent (English) summary see Hoffmann\n2006: 607–613). The form that these prolegomena, as\nthey were called, take in Simplicius was introduced by the\nNeoplatonist Proclus (Elias/David, In Cat. 107.24–26).\nIn the case of Aristotle’s Categories, for instance, we\nfind not only prolegomena suited for this very text (in seven points),\nbut also a general introduction to Aristotle’s philosophy (in\nten points; for a useful overview see Hoffmann 2006: 607–613).\nThis is because the Categories was the first of\nAristotle’s texts to be read in the Neoplatonic school: \nSince the Categories is the first book of Aristotle’s which we\nencounter, and Aristotle’s school—the so-called\nPeripatetic—is one of the schools of philosophy, we ought first\nto say how and in how many ways the philosophical schools received\ntheir appellations. Secondly, what is the division of the Aristotelian\nwritings, so that the class to which we shall assign the present work\nshall be clear. Third, whence should one begin [the study of]\nAristotle’s writings? Fourth, what is the goal of\nAristotle’s philosophy? Fifth, which things lead us towards this\ngoal? Sixth, what is the form of the Aristotelian writings? Seventh,\nwhy did the Philosopher practise obscurity? Eighth, what must the\nexegete of accounts (logoi) such as these be like? Ninth,\nwhat kind of student should be accepted? Tenth, in the case of each\nAristotelian treatise, how many main points (kephalaia)\nshould be taken up, which are they, and for what reason? (Simplicius,\nIn Cat. 3.18–29, translated by M. Chase) \nFinally, the tenth of the matters set forth was: how many, and of what\nkind, are the preliminary points (kephalaia) we must\narticulate prior to the study of each Aristotelian treatise. They are\nthe following: the goal (skopos), the usefulness (to\nchrêsimon), the reason for the title (aitia\nepigraphês), its place in the order of reading (taxis\nanagnôseôs), whether the book is a genuine work of\nthe Philosopher (gnêsion), its division into chapters\n(eis kephalaia dihairesis). It may also not be inappropriate\nto inquire under what part of his philosophy (meros tês\nphilosophias) the work is placed. (Simplicius, In Cat.\n8.9–13, translated by M. Chase) \nSuch an introductory scheme could be modified according to the\nspecific needs and exigencies of a text, so that there is not always a\ndiscussion of all preliminary points: \nIt is to be noted, however, that all these things do not always\nrequire articulation, for often, the usefulness becomes clear at the\nsame time as the goal, while the title is obvious to everyone, as [in\nthe case of] the On the Soul. Authenticity, for its part,\ndoes not need to be established in every case, but in general only\nwhen there is some starting-point for controversy. (Simplicius, In\nCat. 8.31–9.3, translated by M. Chase) \nI offer these things as a hymn to You, Lord (despota),\nCreator (dêmiourgos) of the whole cosmos and of the\nsimple bodies in it, and to those who have been made by You, desiring\nto behold the greatness of Your works and proclaim it to the worthy so\nthat, thinking nothing mean or merely human about You, we might kneel\ndown to You because of the superiority which You have over all the\nthings created by You. (Simplicius, In Cael. 731.25–29,\ntranslated by I. Mueller) \nSimplicius’ Commentary on the Heavens ends with a\nprayer to the demiurge. In this prayer, the whole work is termed a\n“hymn” (humnos) to the creator god. Several\nrecent studies have pointed out that the later Neoplatonists\nconsidered theology and ritual (theurgy) an integral part of their\nphilosophy. For instance, Proclus composed several hymns and begins\nhis Commentary on the Parmenides with a long prayer. Both he\nand his teacher Syrianus were eager to show that Plato was in harmony\nwith most ancient religious traditions such as the Orphics, the\nPythagoreans and the Chaldaean Oracles. Simplicius’ extant\ncommentaries all end with a prayer, the only exception being the\nCommentary on the De anima, where we find a small prayer at\nthe beginning of the work: \nAnd now, under the Guide who is the cause of all souls and all\nreasoning, let us start upon the projected work. (Simplicius, In\nde Anima 1.3–21, translated by J. O. Urmson, slightly\nmodified) \nSurprisingly, and unexpectedly for readers familiar with\nAristotle’s Physics and De caelo, which are\nboth rather technical in character, Simplicius’ comments time\nand again betray a deeply religious or spiritual mindset. In the\ntradition of Athenian Neoplatonism, where religious and ritual\nelements were crucial ingredients of philosophy, Simplicius’\nPlatonisation of Aristotle, as it were, also entails a\nspiritualisation of Aristotle’s works. \nThis is where the ultimate usefulness (chrêsimon) of\nSimplicius’ writings is located. Philippe Hoffmann has\ndemonstrated this admirably: \nThe example of Simplicius’s Commentary on Aristotle’s\nPhysics is emblematic of the connection between learned exegesis\nand religion: the “usefulness” of physics, Simplicius\nexplains, is to provoke the awakening in souls of the anagogical triad\nof Love, Truth, and Faith (to which is added a fourth term, Hope); and\nthe successive reading of the Physics and the De\nCaelo leads the soul of the philosopher-exegete and those of his\naudience (or of his readers) to a “union”\n(henôsis), through Faith and the “vital\nsympathy” correlative with it, with the divine Heaven and with\nthe demiurgic intellect that produces the World. (Hoffmann 2006:\n599–600) \nWithin this text is a motif that may be called the ultimate goal\n(telos) of all ancient philosophical schools, but especially\nof the Platonic tradition, to wit, “assimilation to god” (Plato, Theaetetus 176b–c, trans. by author).\nThe average Aristotle\nscholar today might find this far-fetched, to say the least. However,\nneither of Simplicius’ commentaries on natural philosophy was by\nany means a religious manifesto. Rather, they are both crammed with\ntechnical details and a vast knowledge of texts and philosophical\nproblems. But to ignore this religious dimension would do injustice to\nSimplicius’ general approach to philosophy and exegesis, for in\nlate Antiquity, philosophy was considered a “way of life”\n(P. Hadot 1995) and always related\nto ethics and the ultimate goal of human life, i.e., purification,\nascent, and salvation/deification of the soul: \nIf we take Simplicius at his word that the ‘study of physics\n[…] arouses us to marvel and magnify the maker of the cosmos',\nhis commentaries on Physics and On the Heavens are\nindeed also a form of worship in which his ingenuity and respect for\nthe established tradition contribute to the general effort of\nclarifying the interpreters of nature (and the interpreters of the\ninterpreters). In trying to defend the Platonist point of view in\ncontradistinction to the Christian outlook he uses polemic to persuade\nand refute, the comprehensive exegesis to clarify and proselytise. His\ncommentaries thus became one very elaborate protreptic and guide to\nAristotle's works. (Baltussen 2008: 195) \n[The good exegete] must, I believe, not convict the philosophers of\ndiscordance (diaphônia) by looking only at the letter\n(lexis) of what [Aristotle] says against Plato; but he must\nlook towards the spirit (nous), and track down\n(anikhneuein) the harmony (sumphônia) which\nreigns between them on the majority of points. (Simplicius, In\nCat. 7.29–32, translated by M. Chase) \nThis programmatic statement from the introductory section to the\nCommentary on the Categories shows that the harmony of Plato\nand Aristotle was one of Simplicius’ top priorities as a\ncommentator. As mentioned earlier, the ancient notion of harmony\n(sumphônia) did not entail a strict identity of\nphilosophical views. Rather, it referred to positions that are\nreconcilable, compatible, or even complementary: \nThe text of the two philosophers can be in accord by being\ncomplementary in a unified system, which is quite different from their\nbeing in accord as to the very ideas they contain. (Golitsis 2018:\n72) \nNeoplatonists frequently characterised Aristotle as the secretary of\nnature, as it were, while Plato was the metaphysician par excellence\n(cf. Raphael’s “The School of Athens”). Each had his\nown peculiar domain and his peculiar philosophical attitude, but one\ncould nevertheless speak of a harmony between the two approaches: \n[Aristotle] always refuses to deviate from nature; on the contrary, he\nconsiders even things which are above nature according to their\nrelation to nature, just as, by contrast, the divine Plato, according\nto Pythagorean usage, examines even natural things insofar as they\nparticipate in the things above nature. (Simplicius, In Cat.\n6.27–30, translated by M. Chase) \nOne ought to know that Aristotle is always doing natural philosophy\nwhen he does theology, while Plato is always doing theology when he\ndoes natural philosophy. (Elias/David, In Cat.\n120.30–121.4) \nHowever, I think that one should also attend to the purpose\n(skopos) as well as at the words and recognise that the\ndifference (diaphora) between the two philosophers on these\nquestions is not about things (pragmata) but about words:\nPlato rejects the ordinary use of words (sunêtheia) in\nthe name of precision, but Aristotle makes use of the ordinary use of\nwords on the grounds that the truth is not at all harmed by this.\n(Simplicius, In Cael. 69.11–15, translated by I.\nMueller) \nHere, therefore, the difference (diaphora) between the\nphilosophers is not over a reality (pragma), but over a name\n(onoma), as it is in most cases. I think the reason often is\nthat Aristotle wishes to preserve linguistic usage and carries out his\narguments on the basis of what is evident to the senses, while Plato\noften scorns them and readily resorts to intellective theories.\n(Simplicius, In Phys. 1249.12–17, translated by I.\nBodnár, M. Chase, and M. Share; cf. (Pseudo-?)Simplicius,\nIn de Anima 28.12–13) \nCertainly, one may wonder whether such a program does justice to\neither Plato or Aristotle, although this issue is not relevant to the\npresent discussion of Simplicius. Within the framework of Late\nNeoplatonism, it seems advisable to distinguish Simplicius from\nSyrianus and Proclus, since both of the latter are much more explicit\nand polemical when it comes to reprimanding Aristotle for his\ncriticism of Plato. On the other hand, while it is true that\nSimplicius makes a great effort to reconcile the two philosophers,\nsuch a rapprochement could also be considered a Platonisation of\nAristotle and a stealthy neutralisation of his at times anti-Platonic\nline of reasoning. \nBe that as it may, it is nevertheless clear that there is a rich\npedigree in the history of the Platonic tradition regarding\nharmonisation. Simplicius continues and extends a program that was\ninaugurated by his teacher Ammonius, and also before him by Porphyry,\nand it was afterwards continued in Alexandria by Hierocles and\nOlympiodorus, more or less along the same lines as Simplicius.\nKaramanolis (2018: 36) argues convincingly that Porphyry (and before\nhim some Middle Platonists) had already considered Aristotle a crucial\npart of the Platonic tradition: \n[…] Porphyry wrote commentaries on works of Aristotle because\nhe found these works to represent an elaboration on, and a development\nof, Plato’s philosophy. […] What Porphyry does deny is\nthat Aristotle contradicts the essence of Plato’s philosophical\nviews when he articulates theories that are not in Plato, since these\nmay be inspired from Plato or continue in some way Plato’s\nthinking on a given issue. \nScholars have remarked that Simplicius’ eagerness to harmonise\nPlato and Aristotle should be seen in the context of the\nNeoplatonist’s anti-Christian attitude and especially his\npolemics against the Christian Platonist John Philoponus (Hoffmann\n2014: 286). After Christianity became the official state religion (in\n380 CE), it was ever more difficult for pagan philosophers to teach\nand practice their cultic rituals. This development culminated in the\nfamous edict of 529, commonly referred to as the closing of the\nPlatonic Academy (see\n §1).\n One of the main criticisms, made as early as the first Christian\napologist Tertullian, was that Greek philosophers and their schools\nwould constantly contradict each other, so that it was impossible to\nspeak of a unified intellectual tradition or heritage. In this\nrespect, John Philoponus was particularly dangerous in criticising the\nHellenic tradition from within, and with an excellent knowledge of all\nof the relevant texts. If all of this weren’t bad enough, the\nChristian Platonist from Alexandria openly countered efforts toward\nharmonisation. Being a fervent champion of the creation of the world\nin time (according to the Christian creed), Philoponus argues that one\nof the most common arguments of the harmonisers—that Aristotle\nwould only criticise the apparent meaning of Plato’s\nwords—is not valid. He even refers to it as a fiction\n(muthos), adding that if it were true, Aristotle would have\nsaid so explicitly: \nFrom these passages we can most certainly see that Aristotle’s\nrefutations of Plato are not directed at people who have wrongly\nunderstood Plato, which is a fiction created by some more recent\ncommentators out of embarrassment at the disagreement between the\n<two> philosophers, but rather constitute a rebuttal of the\nnotions of Plato himself. For, if Aristotle had not been attacking\nPlato’s own doctrine of the Forms but, as these commentators\nclaim, that of people who have misunderstood him, he would have\nspecified precisely this at the outset and not have refuted the\ndoctrine of the Forms generally and without qualification.\n(Philoponus, De aet. Mundi 29.2–13, translated by P.\nGolitsis 2018: 73) \nSimplicius’ polemics with Philoponus in his commentaries on the\nPhysics and De Caelo will be examined in more detail\nbelow. \nAmmonius, pupil of Proclus was also an important predecessor for\nSimplicius. Ammonius taught in Alexandria (around the second half of\nthe fifth century) and famously argued that Aristotle’s Unmoved\nMover is both a final and an efficient cause (Simplicius, In\nCael. 271.13–21 and In Phys.\n1360.24–1363.24). Such a reading of Aristotle, which Proclus\nstill firmly opposes (In Parm. IV 842.20–27 [Steel],\nwhere he calls the Unmoved Mover agonos, i.e., not productive\nor infertile; see also Tempelis 1998: 134 n. 609), was an important\nstep in combining the demiurge in Plato’s Timaeus with\nAristotle’s self-thinking intellect (Metaphysics Lambda\n6–7). Simplicius welcomes Ammonius’ innovation and, not\nsurprisingly, refers to him with great approval (see In Phys.\n1362.11–16 and Golitsis 2017a). \nBut it should not be forgotten that there were also other threads to\nSimplicius’ approach of harmonising the Hellenic tradition and\nespecially of integrating Aristotle. At In Cael.\n297.1–6, he mentions some interpreters (tines) who\nbetrayed a hostile attitude towards Aristotle. It is likely that he\nmainly had Syrianus and Proclus in mind. Simplicius had to deal with\nsuch criticism with much more delicacy than the criticism coming from\nPhiloponus. There is a telling passage in In Cael.\n640.20–31, where Simplicius explains that Proclus has refuted\nAristotle’s criticism of Plato in the De caelo in a\nspecial monograph (now lost; see Steel 2005 and Luna, Segonds, and\nEndress 2012: 1591–1596) in order to immediately remark that the\ncriticism was only apparent. \nWhat are the different strategies Simplicius uses to harmonise Plato\nand Aristotle or to integrate the Presocratics and even earlier\ntraditions (Chaldeans, Orphics) into the Platonic tradition? In\nPlatonic Theology I 4, Proclus discusses at length an\nexegetical device that seems to be comparable to the doctrine of the\n“four senses of scripture” (quattuor sensus sacrae\nscripturae), well known from biblical exegesis. According to\nProclus, different hermeneutical methods may be applied to different\ntexts, depending on the mode of their composition. From the\nperspective of the Neoplatonists, different authors or even schools of\nthought had different ways of expressing themselves; this applied\nmainly to traditions that were active or alleged to be active before\nSocrates and Plato: the Chaldeans, the Orphics, Homer (and Hesiod),\nthe Presocratics (esp. Parmenides and Pythagoras, including the\nPseudo-Pythagorean tradition)—but also to Plato and Aristotle.\nTexts could be written “in riddles”, “as\nmyths”, “in symbols”, or “in images”,\nand they could be “inspired” or “dialectical”.\nAt times, this entailed that these texts needed to be translated or\ndecoded in order to serve in philosophical debates. It goes without\nsaying that such presuppositions also granted a certain kind of\nexegetical freedom to the interpreters. Plato himself, Proclus\nexplains, betrays at least four modes of expressing himself in\ndifferent dialogues, while Aristotle was often considered to\nintentionally write in an obscure way for members of his school.\nMoreover, while Plato, according to Simplicius, “rejects the\nordinary use of words in the name of precision”, Aristotle\n“makes use of the ordinary use” (Simplicius, In\nCael. 69.11–15). \nIt is against this background that Simplicius’ attempt to\nharmonise the Greek tradition should be interpreted. Compared to\nProclus, Simplicius’ approach is less complex, and it is, in\nfact, rather similar in principle. Regarding the Presocratics,\nSimplicius remarks that they frequently speak in riddles\n(ainigmatôdôs) and that Aristotle’s\ncriticism of them is merely directed against their apparent meaning.\nWhat is more, we should keep in mind that they wrote before the\nmethods of philosophical discourse and formal logic were firmly\nestablished by Plato and Aristotle: \nBut since we will hear Aristotle too refuting the opinions of earlier\nphilosophers, and before Aristotle Plato seems to do this, and before\nboth of them Parmenides and Xenophanes, it should be known that these\npeople, being concerned for those who listen more superficially,\nrefuted the apparent absurdity (to phainomenon atopon) in\ntheir accounts, since the ancients were accustomed to express their\ndoctrines in riddles (ainigmatôdôs). (Simplicius,\nIn Phys. 36.25–31, translated by R. Barney and S.\nMenn) \n[…] Eudemus bears witness to this when he says: ‘Someone\nmight be amazed at Parmenides for following these untrustworthy\narguments and being deceived by things of this kind, but these matters\nhad not yet then been clarified. For neither did anyone refer to\n“[being spoken of] in many ways” but Plato was the first\nto introduce “in two ways”, nor [did anyone speak of] the\n“in itself” or “the accidental”; and it seems\nthat he [i.e., Parmenides] was indeed misled by these points. These\nhave been studied through the arguments and counter arguments, and the\nsyllogistic <figure>. For there was no agreement unless it was\nseen to be necessary. But our predecessors made claims without proof.\n(Simplicius, In Phys. 120.6–12, translated by P. Huby\nand C. C. W. Taylor) \nSimplicius uses the same pattern of argument regarding\nAristotle’s criticism of Plato: Aristotle argues merely against\nthe apparent meaning of Plato’s words (see, for instance, In\nCael. 352.27–28, 296.6–8 and 26–30, 377.20\nff.). Pantelis Golitsis has rightly pointed out that such criticism had\na “preventive” and “pedagogical” function for\nordinary, more superficial, and inexperienced readers who were prone\nto misunderstand Plato. This goes back, in part, to the Neoplatonist\nSyrianus (Golitsis 2018: 94). For instance, Golitsis points to In\nPhys. 821.27–29, where Simplicius explains that\n“Aristotle philosophised in a way which is more suited to the\nmajority of people and because he was aware of their misunderstandings\n[…]” (translated by J. O. Urmson and P. Golitsis).\nSimplicius’ arguments are, as previously noted, indebted to\nAmmonius. Olympiodorus, Ammonius’ pupil in Alexandria, shows a\nstrategy similar to Simplicius’ strategy. The only difference\nmay be that, as already noted, Simplicius never seems to disagree with\nPlato. Was the Alexandrian or the Ammonian school more liberal in this\nrespect? Once again, it is interesting to compare Simplicius with\nOlympiodorus: \nOlympiodorus follows Ammonius in emphasizing the harmony between\nAristotle and his master […]. He calls him a true disciple of\nPlato (In Alc. 5.29–32). Whenever possible he resolves\napparent contradictions and says that in the rare instances where\nAristotle diverges from Plato he is still indebted to him (In\nGorg. 41.9, 214.13–215.11). Olympiodorus is not blind to\nthe divergences, and in those cases he usually, though not always,\nagrees with Plato. (Opsomer 2010: 707) \nIn the Middle Ages and after, Simplicius was read by a wide range of\nauthors, but to date no systematic study of his legacy has been\npublished. This final section presents only a limited selection of\nevidence for his legacy. In the Latin West, the Dominican friar\nWilliam of Moerbeke (1215–1286) translated some of\nSimplicius’ commentaries into Latin. This made them accessible\nto readers such as Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, and\nmany others. Moerbeke finished translating the Commentary on the\nCategories in 1266 (Chase 2008: 12–17 and 20–24). He\nalso translated a small part of the Commentary on the De\nCaelo, the so-called fragmentum Toletanum, followed by a\nfull translation of the commentary in 1271 (see Bossier 1987). In\naddition, there is a partial translation by Robert Grosseteste that is\nolder then the one by Moerbeke, but it is difficult to determine who\nactually made use of it. \nRegarding Moerbeke’s influence on Thomas, the latter seems to\nhave followed Simplicius in the way he conceives the history of\nphilosophy and, more specifically, the relation between Plato and\nAristotle (see Hankey 2002): \nThe diversity of these two positions stems from this, that some, in\norder to seek the truth about the nature of things, have proceeded\nfrom intelligible reasons, and this was the particular characteristic\nof the Platonists. Some, however, have proceeded from sensible things,\nand this was the particular characteristic of the philosophy of\nAristotle, as Simplicius says in his commentary Upon the\nCategories. (Thomas Aquinas, De Spiritualibus creaturis\n3.40.275–282, as quoted in Hankey 2002: n. 46) \nMoreover, Thomas must have considered Simplicius a rich source of\ninformation about ancient philosophers and their doctrines and\nespecially about the Peripatetic tradition. Bossier (1987) and others\nhave suggested that Thomas might have used material from the\npreviously mentioned fragmentum Toletanum in his\nCommentary on Aristotle’s Metaphysics (XII 8, on\nconcentric spheres and their different movers). There is no evidence\nof an early Latin translation of the other commentaries, with the\npossible exception of a small part of the Commentary on the\nPhysics, which also goes back to Robert Grosseteste (Mansion\n1956: 94). \nThe Arabic tradition is another important source of information about\nSimplicius (for a concise summary, see Goulet & Coda 2016:\n384–394; see also Vallat 2014a and 2014b and Gätje 1982).\nAs in the Latin tradition, the Commentaries on the\nCategories and the De anima seem to have primarily\nbeen read by scholars (in both Arabic and Syriac). However, there also\nappears to be some evidence for a lost Commentary on the First\nBook of Euclid (Goulet & Coda 2016: 390–394; I. Hadot\n2014, 39–53; R. Rashed 2005). Before Simplicius, Proclus had\nalready commented on Euclid. Proclus’ commentary still exists,\nand so there is a question regarding Simplicius’ motivation for\nwriting a second commentary, and it may be that Simplicius’\ncommentary was simply an augmented and revised version of\nProclus’ commentary. Philosophers in the Arabic tradition, like\nthose in the Latin tradition, also used Simplicius to defend the\nharmony of Plato and Aristotle. \nThe Byzantine tradition is primarily relevant for the textual\ntransmission of Simplicius’ works. From the little that is\nknown, Byzantine scholars seem to have had a special interest in the\nCommentary on the Physics. One of the most important\nmanuscripts conserving this commentary (Mosquensis Muz. 3649), not\nused by Hermann Diels in his CAG edition, was copied by the Byzantine\nprincess Theodora Palaiologina Rhaulaina (ca. 1240–1300; see\nHarlfinger 1987). Simplicius’ Commentary on the Physics\nwas used by Michael Psellus, Nicophorus Blemmydes (in his\nIsagogical Epitome; Golitsis 2007), Georgios Pachymeres (in\nhis own Commentary on the Physics, traditionally attributed\nto Psellus; Golitsis 2008b), Georgios Gemistius-Plethon, Georgios\nScholarius, and Theodorus of Gaza. Since there was a lively debate\namong Byzantine philosophers on the relation between Plato and\nAristotle, it is very likely that Simplicius had an impact in this\nrespect. \nInterest in the Commentary on the De anima can also be traced\nin the Renaissance, for instance, the attention paid to\n(Pseudo-?)Simplicius’ reading of De anima III 5 as\nregarding the human intellect only, and also his explanation of the\nkey notion of entelecheia and his relation to Averroes’\npsychology (Nardi 1951; Salatowsky 2006; Blackwell 2011). Moreover,\nRenaissance philosophers, like scholars in Byzantium and the Latin\nWest, thought much about the relation between Plato and Aristotle,\nwith some sharing Simplicius’ preference for harmony or\nconcordism and others opposing it. Thus, for example, Thomas\nAquinas’ view on the harmony of Plato and Aristotle was partly\ninspired by passages from Simplicius (in William of Moerbeke’s\nLatin translation). Other than in the Middle Ages, we also find a\ngrowing interest in his Commentary on Epictetus’\nHandbook from the fifteenth century onwards, especially among\nHumanists (P. Hadot 1987). Last, but not least, in his Lectures on\nthe History of Philosophy, G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) calls\nSimplicius “the most learned and acute of the Greek commentators\non Aristotle” (“der gelehrteste und scharfsinnigste\nder griechischen Kommentatoren des Aristoteles”) and\nasserts that “we owe him much” (“wir verdanken\nihm Verdienstliches”). \nAlthough much more could be said here about Simplicius’ legacy,\nsuffice it to say the following. As mentioned in the introduction, his\nCommentary on the Physics was the basis for Diels’\nfundamental studies on the Greek doxographers (Doxographi\ngraeci) and the fragments of the Presocratic philosophers\n(Fragmente der Vorsokratiker). The reconstruction of the\nPeripatetic tradition also depends to a large extent on Simplicius\n(Falcon 2017 and Baltussen 2016). This is especially obvious in \nthe work of Alexander of Aphrodisias, where substantial parts of lost\ncommentaries can be retrieved from Simplicius’ works (M. Rashed\n2011), but also in the case of less well-known figures such as Boethos\nof Sidon (Chiaradonna & Rashed forthcoming). Compared to Hermann\nDiels and others, we now have a much better grasp of how Simplicius\nhandled his sources and how he portrayed the historical development of\nGreek philosophy up to his time. Several recent studies have also\nprovided a clearer profile of Simplicius’ own philosophical\nagenda. Nevertheless, considerable parts of his commentaries are still\nrelatively unexplored, and it now seems to be a good time for\ncontemporary scholars to rediscover the Neoplatonist as an inspiring\nlate-ancient colleague in the joint venture of coming to terms with\nAristotle.","contact.mail":"helmigc@uni-koeln.de","contact.domain":"uni-koeln.de"}]
