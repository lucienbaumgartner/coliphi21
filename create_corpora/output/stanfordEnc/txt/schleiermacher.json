But he is certainly one of the best second-tier\nphilosophers of the period (a period in which the second-tier was still\nextremely good). He was not only a philosopher, but also an eminent\nclassical scholar and theologian. Much of his philosophical work was in\nthe philosophy of religion, but from a modern philosophical point of\nview it is his hermeneutics (i.e., theory of interpretation) and his\ntheory of translation that deserve the most attention. This article\nwill attempt to provide a fairly broad overview of his philosophical\nthought. One thing that will emerge from this is that although he has\nimportant philosophical debts to many predecessors and contemporaries\n(including Spinoza, Kant, and Friedrich Schlegel), he was above all\nfollowing in the philosophical footsteps of one predecessor in\nparticular: Herder.\n\n\n\n\nFriedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768–1834) was born in\nBreslau as the son of a clergyman of the reformed church. His earlier\neducation took place in institutions of the Moravian Brethren\n(Herrnhuter), a strict pietist sect. However, while there he also\npursued broader humanistic interests. Largely as a result of skepticism\nabout certain Christian doctrines taught there, he moved to the more\nliberal University of Halle in 1787. However, he continued in theology\n(with philosophy and classical philology as minor fields). He passed\nhis theological examinations in Berlin in 1790. This was followed by a\nperiod as a private tutor, which ended in 1793, partly, it seems, due\nto friction caused by his sympathy with the French Revolution, to which\nhis employer was opposed. During the periods just mentioned he was heavily occupied with the\nstudy and criticism of Kant’s philosophy. This work culminated in\nseveral unpublished essays—On the Highest Good (1789),\nOn What Gives Value to Life (1792–3), and On\nFreedom (1790–3)—which rejected Kant’s\nconception that the “highest good [summum bonum]”\nrequires an apportioning of happiness to moral desert, and Kant’s\nconnected doctrine of the “postulates” of an afterlife of\nthe soul and God, while developing an anti-Kantian theory of the\nthoroughgoing causal determination of human action and of the\ncompatibility of this with moral responsibility. In 1793–4 he\nwrote two essays about Spinoza: Spinozism and Brief\nPresentation of the Spinozistic System. A major catalyst for these\nessays was Jacobi’s work On the Doctrine of Spinoza, in\nLetters to Mr. Moses Mendelssohn (1785), which was highly critical\nof Spinozism. But they also show the influence of Herder’s work\nGod: Some Conversations (1787), which championed a modified\nform of Spinozism. In his two essays Schleiermacher himself embraces a\nmodified form of Spinoza’s monism similar in character to\nHerder’s (in particular, like Herder, he is inclined to\nsubstitute for Spinoza’s single substance the more active\nprinciple of a single fundamental force). He also attempts to\ndefend this position by showing it to be reconcilable with central\nfeatures of Kant’s theoretical philosophy (notably, Kant’s\ndoctrine of things in themselves). This neo-Spinozistic position would\nsubsequently be fundamental to Schleiermacher’s most important\nwork in the philosophy of religion, On Religion: Speeches to Its\nCultured Despisers (1799). However, in thus rejecting\nJacobi’s anti-Spinozism, Schleiermacher seems also to have\nabsorbed something from Jacobi that would be equally important for his\nfuture philosophy of religion: the idea (for which his pietist\nbackground no doubt made him receptive) that we enjoy a sort of\nimmediate intuition or feeling of God. During the period 1794–6 Schleiermacher served as a pastor in\nLandsberg. In 1796 he moved to Berlin, where he became chaplain to a\nhospital. In Berlin he met Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel, as\nwell as other romantics, became deeply engaged in the formation of the\nromantic movement, and collaborated with the Schlegel brothers on the\nshort-lived but important literary journal Athenaeum\n(1798–1800). Among Schleiermacher’s contributions to this\njournal was the short proto-feminist piece Idea for a Catechism of\nReason for Noble Ladies (1798). During the period 1797–9, he\nshared a house with Friedrich Schlegel. Encouraged by the romantic\ncircle to write a statement of his religious views, in 1799 he\npublished his most important and radical work in the philosophy of\nreligion, On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers\n(revised editions followed in 1806, 1821, the latter including\nsignificant “explanations”, and 1831). This work sought to\nsave religion in the eyes of its cultured despisers (prominent among\nthem some of the romantics, including Friedrich Schlegel) by, inter\nalia, arguing that human immortality and even God are inessential\nto religion; diagnosing and excusing current religion’s more\noff-putting features in terms of its corruption by worldly bourgeois\nculture and state-interference; and arguing that there are an endless\nmultiplicity of valid forms of religion. The book won Schleiermacher a\nnational reputation. In the same year (1799) he also published an essay\non the situation of the Jews in Prussia, Letters on the Occasion of\nthe Political-Theological Task and the Open Letter of Jewish\nHouseholders. In this work he rejected an expedient that had been\nproposed for ameliorating the situation of the Jews in Prussia of\nachieving their civil assimilation through baptism (which would, he\nargues, harm both Judaism and Christianity) and instead advocated full\ncivil rights for Jews (on certain rather reasonable conditions). The\nsame year also saw Schleiermacher’s composition of the\ninteresting short essay Toward a Theory of Sociable Conduct,\nwhich is important as his first significant discussion of the art of\nconversation (an art that would later be central to his discipline of\ndialectics). Finally, 1799 also saw his publication of a highly\ncritical review of Kant’s Anthropology. The review in\nparticular took Kant to task for his dualistic philosophy of mind and\nhis superficial, disparaging attitude toward women and other\npeoples. During the following several years Schleiermacher complemented\nOn Religion with two substantial publications that were more\nethical in orientation: the especially important Soliloquies\n(1800; second edition 1810) and the Outlines of a Critique of\nPrevious Ethical Theory (1803). In 1800 he also defended his\nfriend Friedrich Schlegel’s controversial and arguably\npornographic novel Lucinde from the same year in his\nConfidential Letters Concerning Friedrich Schlegel’s\nLucinde—a shared proto-feminism constituting a large part of\nhis reason for sympathizing with Schlegel’s book. During the\nperiod 1799–1804 Schleiermacher developed with Schlegel the\nproject of translating Plato’s dialogues. As time went on,\nhowever, Schlegel left this work to Schleiermacher, which contributed\nto increasingly difficult relations between the two men after 1800.\nSchleiermacher’s translations appeared during the period\n1804–28 (though not quite all of the dialogues were translated in\nthe end), and are still widely used and admired today. While in Berlin Schleiermacher developed romantic attachments to two\nmarried women, Henriette Herz and Eleonore Grunow—the latter of\nwhich attachments led to scandal and unhappiness, eventually causing\nSchleiermacher to leave the city. He spent the years 1802–4 in\nStolpe. By 1804 he was teaching at Halle University. During the period\n1804–5 he began lecturing on ethics (as he would do again\nrepeatedly until 1832). In 1805 he also began delivering his famous and\nimportant lectures on hermeneutics (which he repeated regularly until\n1833). In 1806 he published the short book Christmas Eve, a\nliterary work that explores the meaning of Christian love by depicting\na German family’s celebration of Christmas Eve. This is in\nkeeping with On Religion’s ideal that (Christian)\nreligion should be family- rather than state-centered. In 1806–7\nhe left Halle as a result of the French occupation, and moved back to\nBerlin. From this time on he began actively promoting German resistance\nto the French occupation and the cause of German unity. In 1808 he\npublished Occasional Thoughts on Universities in a German Spirit,\ntogether with an Appendix on One about to be Founded, a work\nwritten in connection with plans for founding a new university in\nBerlin (now known as the Humboldt University), to which Wilhelm von\nHumboldt likewise contributed theoretically soon afterwards as well as\nleading the project’s implementation. In 1808 Schleiermacher\nmarried a young widow, Henriette von Willich, with whom he had several\nchildren. In 1808–9 he became preacher at the\nDreifaltigkeitskirche, in 1810 professor of theology at the University\nof Berlin, and by 1811 also a member of the Berlin Academy of\nSciences. After becoming a member of the Academy he often delivered addresses\nbefore it, among which several on ethics, one on translation from 1813,\none on the philosophy of Socrates from 1815, and one on Leibniz’s\nidea of a universal language from 1831 are especially significant. In 1811 he lectured on dialectics for the first time (as he would do\nagain regularly until his death, at which time he was in the early\nstages of preparing a version for publication). In 1812 he began\nlecturing on the history of philosophy (as he would again repeatedly in\nsubsequent years). In 1813 he delivered as an address, and then\npublished as an essay, On the Different Methods of\nTranslation—a very important work in translation theory\ndeeply informed by his own experience as a translator. In 1813–14\nhe lectured on pedagogy, or the philosophy of education, for the first\ntime (as he would do on two subsequent occasions: 1820–1 and\n1826). In 1818 he lectured on psychology for the first time (as he\nwould again repeatedly until 1833–4). In 1819 he lectured on\naesthetics for the first time (as he subsequently did on two further\noccasions, the last of them in 1832–3). In the same year he also\nbegan lecturing on the life of Jesus (as he did again on four further\noccasions over the following twelve years)—thereby inaugurating\nan important genre of literature on this subject in the nineteenth\ncentury. In 1821–2 he published his major work of systematic theology,\nThe Christian Faith (revised edition 1830–1). In 1829 he\npublished two open letters on this work (nominally addressed to his\nfriend Lücke), in which he discusses it and central issues in the\nphilosophy of religion and theology relating to it in a concise and\nlucid way. Schleiermacher died in 1834. As can be seen even from this brief\nsketch of his life and works, a large proportion of his career was\ntaken up with the philosophy of religion and theology. However, from\nthe secular standpoint of modern philosophy it is probably his work in\nsuch areas as hermeneutics (i.e., the theory of interpretation) and the\ntheory of translation that is most important. Accordingly, this article\nwill begin with these more interesting areas of his thought, only\nturning to his philosophy of religion briefly at the end. Since the topics of language and human psychology are central to\nSchleiermacher’s hermeneutics and theory of translation, it is\nappropriate to begin with some discussion of his philosophies of\nlanguage and mind. Schleiermacher nowhere presents his philosophy of\nlanguage separately; instead, it is found scattered through such works\nas his lectures on psychology, dialectics, and hermeneutics. The\nfollowing eight positions—all but the last of which are heavily\nindebted to Herder—are especially worth noting: The next five of the eight positions are especially important for\nSchleiermacher’s hermeneutics and theory of translation (to be\ndiscussed below): As was mentioned earlier, with the sole exception of this final\nfeature (semantic holism), Schleiermacher’s entire philosophy of\nlanguage is heavily indebted to Herder. However, while refining\nHerder’s philosophy of language with this final feature, it also\nweakens it in other respects. For example, whereas Herder’s\nversion of doctrine\n (4)\n normally restricted itself\nto a claim that thought is essentially dependent on and bounded by\nlanguage, Schleiermacher’s version asserts the outright\nidentity of thought with language, or with inner language. But\nsuch a strong version of the doctrine is philosophically\nproblematic—vulnerable to counterexamples in which thought occurs\nwithout any corresponding (inner) language use, and vice versa. Again,\nas we noted, in later works Schleiermacher tends to add to the\nHerderian doctrine\n (5)\n a thesis that concepts are\nempirical schemata à la Kant (see\n (6)).\nThis is likely to seem problematic at first sight because of its\ninclusion of sensory images in meaning. But that is arguably not so:\nHerder had already included them in a way as well; contrary to first\nappearances, doing so need not conflict with a suitably interpreted\ndoctrine that meanings are word-usages; and the currently popular\nattack on such “psychologism” in modern philosophy of\nlanguage influenced by Frege and Wittgenstein, which is likely to make\nsuch a position seem suspect, may well itself be misguided. What\nis problematic about Schleiermacher’s thesis is rather\nthat Kant’s theory of empirical schemata had implied that there\nis a sharp distinction between meanings, conceived as something purely\npsychological, and word-usages, so that Schleiermacher’s\nunmodified reintroduction of the theory implies the same, and hence\nconflicts with doctrine\n (5),\n the doctrine that\nmeaning is word-usage. Finally, whereas for Herder doctrine\n (7)\n was merely an empirically established rule of thumb\nand admitted of exceptions, Schleiermacher in his lectures on ethics\nand dialectics attempts to give a sort of a priori proof of\nlinguistic and conceptual-intellectual diversity even at the level of\nindividuals as a universal fact—a proof that is dubious\nin its very a priori status, in its specific details, and in its\nextremely counterintuitive implication (often explicitly asserted by\nSchleiermacher) that, strictly speaking, no one can ever understand\nanother person. Schleiermacher’s philosophy of mind is found mainly in his\nlectures on psychology. It is too extensive to present in detail here.\nBut the following four central principles—all of which have their\nroots in Herder, and especially in Herder’s main work on the\nphilosophy of mind, On the Cognition and Sensation of the Human\nSoul (1778)—are especially striking and important: Finally, one feature of Schleiermacher’s philosophy of mind\nthat distinguishes it from Herder’s, and from other\nGerman predecessors’, is also worth noting: Schleiermacher says\nrelatively little about unconscious mental processes, and when\nhe does mention them often seems skeptical about them. For example, he\nargues that thought cannot be unconscious, and that so-called\n“obscure representations” are in fact merely sensuous\nimages that do not involve thoughts. Some of Schleiermacher’s most important philosophical work\nconcerns the theories of interpretation (“hermeneutics”)\nand translation. Friedrich Schlegel was an immediate influence on his\nthought here. Their ideas on these subjects began to take shape in the\nlate 1790s, when they lived together in the same house in Berlin for a\ntime. Many of their ideas are shared, and it is often unclear which of\nthe two men was the (more) original source of a given idea. But since\nSchlegel’s surviving treatments are much less detailed and\nsystematic than Schleiermacher’s, the latter inevitably take on\nprime importance. Schleiermacher’s theories of interpretation and translation\nrest squarely on three of the Herder-inspired doctrines in the\nphilosophy of language that were described above:\n (4)\n thought is essentially dependent on and bounded by, or\neven identical with, language;\n (5)\n meaning is\nword-usage; and\n (7)\n there are deep linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual differences between people. Doctrine\n (7)\n poses a severe challenge to both interpretation and\ntranslation, and it is the main task of Schleiermacher’s theories\nto cope with just this challenge. Schleiermacher’s most original\ndoctrine in the philosophy of language, doctrine\n (8)\n (semantic holism), is also highly relevant in this\nconnection, for, as Schleiermacher recognizes, semantic holism greatly\nexacerbates the challenge to interpretation and translation that is\nposed by\n (7). Schleiermacher lectured on hermeneutics frequently between 1805 and\n1833. The following are his main principles: (a) Hermeneutics is strictly the theory of understanding\nlinguistic communication—as contrasted, not equated, with\nexplicating, applying, or translating it. (b) Hermeneutics should be a universal\ndiscipline—i.e., one that applies equally to all subjects areas\n(such as the Bible, law, and literature), to oral as well as to written\nlanguage, to modern texts as well as to ancient ones, to works in\none’s own language as well as to works in foreign languages, and\nso forth. (c) In particular, the interpretation of sacred texts such as the\nBible is included within it—this may not rely on special\nprinciples, such as divine inspiration (either of the author or of the\ninterpreter). (d) Interpretation is a much more difficult task than is generally\nrealized: contrary to a common misconception that “understanding\noccurs as a matter of course”, in fact “misunderstanding\noccurs as a matter of course, and so understanding must be willed and\nsought at every point” (HHM 109–110;\nHC 21–22). (This position derives from\nSchleiermacher’s version of principle\n (7):\ndeep linguistic and conceptual-intellectual diversity.) How, then, is interpretation to be accomplished? (e) It is essential to distinguish clearly between the question of\nthe meaning of a text or discourse and the question of its\ntruth. Assuming that a text or discourse must be true will\noften lead to serious misinterpretation. (f) Before the interpretation proper of a text or discourse can even\nbegin, the interpreter must acquire a good knowledge of its historical\ncontext. (The suggestion found in some of the secondary literature that\nSchleiermacher thinks that historical context is irrelevant to\ninterpretation is absurd.) (g) Interpretation proper always has two sides: one linguistic, the\nother psychological. Linguistic interpretation’s task (which\nrests on principle\n (5))\n consists in inferring from\nevidence that consists in particular actual uses of words to the rules\nthat are governing them, i.e., to their usages and thus to their\nmeanings; psychological interpretation instead focuses on an\nauthor’s psychology. Linguistic interpretation is mainly\nconcerned with what is common or shared in a language; psychological\ninterpretation mainly with what is distinctive to a particular\nauthor. (h) Schleiermacher implies several reasons why an interpreter needs\nto complement linguistic interpretation with psychological in this way.\nFirst, he sees such a need as arising from the deep linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual distinctiveness of individuals. This\ndistinctiveness at the level of individuals leads to the problem for\nlinguistic interpretation that the actual uses of words that are\navailable to serve as evidence from which to infer an author’s\nexact usage or meaning will usually be relatively few in number and\npoor in contextual variety—a problem which an appeal to authorial\npsychology is supposed to help solve by providing additional clues.\nSecond, an appeal to the author’s psychology is also required in\norder to resolve ambiguities at the level of linguistic meaning that\narise in particular contexts (i.e., even after the range of meanings\navailable to the author for the word(s) in question is known). Third,\nin order fully to understand a linguistic act one needs to know not\nonly its linguistic meaning but also what more recent philosophers have\ncalled its “illocutionary force” or intention. For example,\nif I encounter a stranger by a frozen lake who says to me, “The\nice is thin over there”, in order fully to understand his\nutterance I need to know not only its linguistic meaning (which in this\ncase is clear) but also whether it is being made as a factual\nobservation, a threat, a joke, or whatnot. (Schleiermacher himself\nplaces most emphasis on the first of these three considerations.\nHowever, if, as Schleiermacher does, one wants to argue that\ninterpretation needs to invoke psychology generally, and if,\nas I hinted earlier, linguistic and conceptual-intellectual\ndistinctiveness is not in fact the pervasive phenomenon that\nSchleiermacher usually takes it to be, then it is arguably the latter\ntwo considerations that should be considered the more fundamental\nones.) (i) Interpretation also requires two different methods: a\n“comparative” method (i.e., a method of plain induction),\nwhich Schleiermacher sees as predominating on the linguistic side of\ninterpretation, where it takes the interpreter from the particular uses\nof a word to the rule for use that governs them all; and a\n“divinatory” method (i.e., a method of tentative, fallible\nhypothesis based on but also going well beyond the empirical evidence\navailable; the etymology to keep in mind here is not so much Latin\ndivinus, which would point toward prophecy, but rather French\ndeviner, to guess or conjecture), which he sees as\npredominating on the psychological side of interpretation. (The\nwidespread notion in the secondary literature that\n“divination” is for Schleiermacher a process of\npsychological self-projection into texts contains a grain of truth, in\nthat he does think that interpretation requires some measure\nof psychological common ground between interpreter and interpretee, but\nis basically mistaken.) (j) Ideal interpretation is of its nature a holistic activity (this\nprinciple in part rests on but also goes well beyond\nSchleiermacher’s semantic holism). In particular, any\ngiven piece of text needs to be interpreted in light of the whole text\nto which it belongs, and both need to be interpreted in light of the\nbroader language in which they are written, their larger historical\ncontext, a broader pre-existing genre, the author’s whole corpus,\nand the author’s overall psychology. Such holism introduces a\npervasive circularity into interpretation, for, ultimately,\ninterpreting these broader items in its turn depends on interpreting\nsuch pieces of text. Schleiermacher does not see this circle as\nvicious, however. Why not? His solution is not that all of these tasks\nshould be accomplished simultaneously—for that would far exceed\nhuman capacities. Rather, it essentially lies in the (very plausible)\nthought that understanding is not an all-or-nothing matter but instead\nsomething that comes in degrees, so that it is possible to\nmake progress toward full understanding in a piecemeal way. For\nexample, concerning the relation between a piece of text and the whole\ntext to which it belongs, Schleiermacher recommends that we first read\nthrough and interpret as best we can each of the parts of the text in\nturn in order thereby to arrive at an approximate overall\ninterpretation of the text, and that we then apply this approximate\noverall interpretation in order to refine our initial interpretations\nof each of the particular parts, which in turn gives us an improved\noverall interpretation, which can then be re-applied toward still\nfurther refinement of the interpretations of the parts, and so on\nindefinitely. Schleiermacher’s debts to Herder in this theory of\ninterpretation extend well beyond the framework-principles\n (4),\n (5),\n and\n (7)\n mentioned earlier. Indeed, Schleiermacher’s\ntheory as it has just been described is almost identical to\nHerder’s. Some of the common ground here is admittedly due to the\nfact that they were both influenced by the same predecessors,\nespecially J.A. Ernesti. But Schleiermacher’s theory owes\nexclusively to Herder the two central moves (often wrongly thought to\nhave been original with Schleiermacher) of supplementing\n“linguistic” with “psychological”\ninterpretation and of identifying “divination” as the\npredominant method of the latter. (Herder had already made these two\nmoves, especially in On Thomas Abbt’s Writings [1768]\nand On the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul [1778].)\nSchleiermacher’s theory as it has just been described in essence\nmerely draws together and systematizes ideas that already lay scattered\nthrough a number of Herder’s works. There are some significant exceptions to this rule of continuity,\nhowever—respects in which Schleiermacher’s theory deviates\nfrom Herder’s. But it is precisely here that\nSchleiermacher’s theory tends to become more philosophically\nproblematic. To begin with two deviations that are not problematic, but\nrather advantageous: First, as was previously mentioned, Schleiermacher\nexacerbates the challenge to interpretation that principle\n (7)\n already poses by introducing principle\n (8),\n semantic holism. Second, Schleiermacher’s\ntheory explicitly introduces principle\n (b),\n the\nideal of the universality of hermeneutics. This principle is\nvery much in the spirit of Herder’s theory, but it does go beyond\nits letter. (There were, however, some clearer precedents for\nit—for example, in van der Hardt, Chladenius, Pfeiffer, Grosch,\nand Meier.) Turning now to deviations that are problematic, we already\nnoted several examples of such problematic deviations concerning the\nexact force of the three principles in the philosophy of language that\nunderpin Schleiermacher’s theory of interpretation,\n principles\n (4),\n (5),\n and\n (7).\n But the following are further examples. Whereas\nHerder rightly emphasizes the vital importance in interpretation of\ncorrectly identifying a work’s genre, and also the great\ndifficulty of doing so in many cases, especially due to the constant\nchanges in genres that take place and the consequent pervasive\ntemptation falsely to assimilate unfamiliar genres to more familiar\nones, Schleiermacher pays relatively little attention to this subject.\nAgain, unlike Herder, Schleiermacher, especially in his later work,\nmore closely specifies psychological interpretation as a process of\nidentifying, and tracing the necessary development of, a single\nauthorial “seminal decision [Keimentschluß]”\nthat lies behind a work and unfolds itself as the work in a necessary\nfashion. However, this seems an unhelpful move, for how many works are\nactually composed, and hence properly interpretable, in such a way?\nAgain, whereas Herder includes not only an author’s linguistic\nbehavior but also his non-linguistic behavior among the evidence that\nis relevant to psychological interpretation, Schleiermacher normally\ninsists on a restriction to the former. But this too seems misguided;\nfor example, the Marquis de Sade’s recorded acts of\ncruelty seem no less potentially relevant to establishing the (as we\nnow put it) sadistic side of his psychological make-up, and hence to\ninterpreting his texts accurately, than his cruel statements. Again,\nunlike Herder, Schleiermacher regards the central role of\n“divination”, or hypothesis, in interpretation as a ground\nfor sharply distinguishing interpretation from natural science, and\nhence for classifying it as an art rather than a science. However, he\nshould arguably instead have regarded it as a ground for considering\ninterpretation and natural science similar. (His mistake here\nwas caused by a false assumption that natural science works by a method\nof plain induction—i.e., roughly: this first a is\nF, this second a is F, this third a\nis F, … therefore all as are\nF—rather than by hypothesis.) Schleiermacher’s theory also tends to play down, obscure, or\nmiss certain important points concerning interpretation that Friedrich\nSchlegel had already made. Schlegel’s treatment of hermeneutic\nmatters—in texts such as his Philosophy of Philology\n(1797) and the Athenaeum Fragments\n(1798–1800)—largely resembles Schleiermacher’s. But\nit also includes the following three points which are either less bold,\nobscured, or altogether missing in Schleiermacher: (i) Schlegel notes\nthat texts (at least superior ones) often express unconscious\nmeanings: “Every excellent work … aims at more than it\nknows” (On Goethe’s Meister [1798]\n[PJ 2:177]). Schleiermacher sometimes implies a\nsimilar-looking view, most famously in his doctrine that the\ninterpreter should aim to understand an author better than he\nunderstood himself, but Schlegel’s version of such a position is\nmore radical, envisaging indeed an “infinite depth” of\nmeaning that is largely unknown to the author himself. (ii) Schlegel\nemphasizes that a work often expresses important meanings, not\nexplicitly in any of its parts, but rather through the way in which\nthese are put together to form a whole. This is a very important point.\nSchleiermacher perhaps in a way makes it as well, but if so,\nthen only as incorporated into and obscured by his more dubious\ndoctrine of the “seminal decision”. (iii) Unlike\nSchleiermacher, Schlegel emphasizes that works typically contain\nconfusions that the interpreter needs to identify and which the\ninterpreter also needs to explain when they occur: It is not enough that one understand the actual sense of a confused\nwork better than the author understood it. One must also oneself be\nable to know, characterize, and even construe the\nconfusion even down to its very principles. (KFSA\n18:63) This is another very important point. Despite these significant but limited shortcomings in the details of\nSchleiermacher’s hermeneutics, his pupil August Boeckh, an\neminent classical philologist, subsequently gave a broadly faithful and\neven more systematic re-articulation of Schleiermacher’s\nhermeneutics in lectures that were eventually published as his\nEncyclopedia and Methodology of the Philological Sciences\n(delivered as lectures 1809–66; published posthumously 1877), and\nthrough the combined influence of Schleiermacher’s and\nBoeckh’s treatments it achieved something very much like the\nstatus of the official hermeneutical methodology of nineteenth-century\nclassical and biblical scholarship. Schleiermacher applied his scrupulous hermeneutic method fruitfully\nto several areas of scholarship that centrally require interpretation.\nOne example of this is the series of lectures on the life of Jesus that\nhe delivered between 1819 and 1833. Another—for philosophers\nperhaps more significant—example is his work as a historiographer\nof philosophy. For further discussion, see the supplementary\n document\n Schleiermacher’s Historiography of Philosophy. As was already mentioned, Schleiermacher also develops his theory of\ntranslation on the foundation of the Herder-influenced principles in\nthe philosophy of language\n (4),\n (5),\n and\n (7),\n together with\n (8),\n his own semantic holism, which exacerbates the\nchallenge to translation already posed by (7). Schleiermacher was himself a masterful translator, whose German\ntranslations of Plato are still widely used and admired today, about\ntwo hundred years after they were done. So his views on translation\ncarry a certain prima facie authority. He explains his theory\nof translation mainly in the brilliant essay On the Different\nMethods of Translation (1813). The following are some of his main\npoints: (a) Translation usually faces the problem of a conceptual gulf\nbetween the source language and the target language (as the latter\ncurrently exists). (This is an application of principle\n (7).) (b) This situation makes translation an extremely difficult task,\nposing a major obstacle to the attainment of translation’s\ntraditional primary goal, that of faithfully reproducing the original\nmeaning in the target language. In this connection, Schleiermacher in\nparticular notes the following problem (which might be dubbed the\nparadox of paraphrase): If, faced with the task of translating an alien\nconcept, a translator attempts to reproduce its intension by\nreproducing its extension with the aid of an elaborate paraphrase in\nhis own language, he will generally find that as he gets closer to the\noriginal extension he undermines the original intension in other ways.\nFor instance, faced with Homer’s color word\nchlôros, a word that Homer sometimes applies to things\nthat we would classify as green (e.g., healthy foliage) but at other\ntimes to things that we would classify as yellow (e.g., honey), a\ntranslator might attempt to reproduce the extension correctly by\ntranslating the word as “green or yellow”. But in doing so\nhe would be sacrificing the original intension in other ways—for\nHomer did not have either the concept green or the concept\nyellow (only the concept chlôros), and in addition for\nHomer chlôros was not a disjunctive\nconcept. (c) Schleiermacher also identifies a number of further challenges\nthat commonly exacerbate the difficulty of translation. For example, he\nnotes that in the case of poetry it is necessary to reproduce not only\nthe semantic but also the musical aspects of the original, such as\nmeter and rhyme—and this not merely as a desideratum over and\nabove the main task of reproducing meaning, but also as an essential\npart of that task, because in poetry such musical features\nserve as essential vehicles for the precise expression of meaning. And\nhe argues that in addition to reproducing meaning a translation should\nattempt to convey to its readership where an author was being\nconceptually conventional and where conceptually original—for\nexample, by using older vocabulary from the target language in the\nformer cases and relative neologisms from it in the latter. But he also\nnotes that in both of these connections the added requirement or\ndesideratum involved will frequently stand in tension with that of\nfinding the closest semantic fit—since, for example, it will turn\nout that the word that would best reproduce a rhyme or best reflect a\nconcept’s vintage is not the one that is closest in meaning to\nthe word in the original. (d) Because of this great difficulty, the translator needs to\npossess real interpretive expertise, and to be an “artist”,\nif he is to cope with the task of translation at all adequately. (e) The conceptual gulf that poses the central challenge here might\nin principle be tackled in one of two broad ways: either by bringing\nthe author’s linguistic-conceptual world closer to that of the\nreader of the translation or vice versa. The former approach had been\nchampioned, among others, by Luther in his classic Letter on\nTranslation (1530) and had been practiced by him in his\ntranslation of the Bible (he called it Verdeutschung,\n“Germanizing”). However, Schleiermacher finds it\nunacceptable, mainly because it inevitably distorts the author’s\nconcepts and thoughts. Schleiermacher therefore champions the\nalternative approach of bringing the reader toward the\nlinguistic-conceptual world of the author as the only acceptable\none. But how can this possibly be accomplished? (f) According to Schleiermacher, the key to a solution lies in the\nplasticity of language. Because of this plasticity, even if the usages\nof words, and hence the concepts, expressed by the target language\nas it currently exists are incommensurable with the\nauthor’s, it is still possible for a translator to bend the language of the translation as far possible toward that of\nthe original in order to communicate as far as possible an impression\nof the system of concepts developed in it. (DM 25) (This solution presupposes principle\n (5)\n in the\nphilosophy of language.) For instance, the translator faced with the\ntask of translating Homer’s word chlôros would\nselect the closest counterpart in the target language, say\n“green”, but then modify its usage over the course of the\ntranslation so that it is applied not only to things that are green\n(e.g., healthy foliage) but also to things that are yellow (e.g.,\nhoney). (g) This approach entails a strong preference for translating any\ngiven word in the original in a uniform way throughout the translation\nrather than switching between two or more different ways of translating\nit in different contexts. (h) This approach also makes for translations that are considerably\nless easy to read than those that can be achieved by the alternative\napproach (Verdeutschung). However, this is an acceptable price\nto pay given that the only alternative is a failure to convey the\nauthor’s meaning at all accurately. Moreover, the offending\npeculiarities have a positive value in that they constantly remind the\nreader of the conceptual unfamiliarity of the material that is being\ntranslated and of the “bending” approach that is being\nemployed. (i) In order to work at all effectively, though, this approach\nrequires that large amounts of relevant material be translated, so that\nthe reader of the translation becomes habituated to it and acquires\nenough examples of a particular word’s unfamiliar use in enough\ndifferent contexts to enable him to infer the unfamiliar rule for use\nthat is involved. (j) Even this optimal approach to translation has severe\nlimitations, however. In particular, it will often be impossible to\nreproduce the holistic aspects of meaning—the several related\nusages of a given word, the systems of related words/concepts, and the\ndistinctive grammar of the language. And since these holistic features\nare internal to a word’s meaning, this will entail a shortfall in\nthe communication of its meaning by the translation. Reading a\ntranslation therefore inevitably remains only a poor second best to\nreading the original, and the translator should think of his task as\none of striving to approximate an infinite, never fully realizable,\nideal. (k) Translation is still amply justified, though—not only for\nthe obvious reason that it is necessary in order to make works\navailable to people who want to read them but are not in the fortunate\nposition of knowing the original languages, but also for the less\nobvious reason that through its “bending” approach it\neffects a conceptual enrichment of their language (and through its\nreproduction of musical features a musical enrichment). (l) Nor (Schleiermacher adds in answer to a worry that Herder had\nexpressed) need we fear that this enrichment will deprive our language\nof its authentic character. For in cases where a real conflict with\nthat character arises, the enrichments in question will soon wither\nfrom the language. Here again (as in the case of interpretation), not only the\nframework principles\n (4),\n (5),\n and\n (7),\n but most of\nthese ideas about translation come from Herder. In particular,\nSchleiermacher’s central strategy of “bending” the\ntarget language in order to cope with conceptual incommensurability,\nand his point that it is also important to convey the musical aspects\nof an original (poetic) text in order to convey its meaning accurately,\nboth do so. (Relevant Herderian sources here are the Fragments on\nRecent German Literature [1767–8] and the Popular\nSongs [Volkslieder] [1774 and 1778/9].) However, unlike Schleiermacher’s theory of interpretation,\nwhich, as was mentioned earlier, often worsens Herder’s, this\ntheory of translation tends to refine Herder’s in some modest\nbut significant ways. Among the ideas just adumbrated, examples of\nthis occur in (b), where Schleiermacher’s paradox of paraphrase\nis largely novel; (c), where his ideal of making clear in a\ntranslation at which points the author was being conceptually\nconventional and at which points conceptually original is novel in\ncomparison with Herder; (h), where his idea that the oddities that\nresult from the “bending” approach are not only an\nacceptable price to pay but can actually serve a positive function is\nnovel; (i), which is a novel point; (j), where the point that semantic\nholism imposes principled limitations on the successfulness of\ntranslations is novel; and (l), which plausibly contradicts\nHerder. Schleiermacher tended to be quite self-deprecating about his\nsensitivity to and knowledge of art, and hence about his aptitude for\naesthetics (e.g., in On Religion and the Soliloquies,\nwhere he is clearly rather in awe of the greater talent and expertise\nin this area that such romantic friends as the Schlegel brothers\nenjoyed), and accordingly tended to shy away from discussing the\nsubject in detail in his earlier work. However, he did eventually bring\nhimself to confront the subject systematically, namely, in his lectures\non aesthetics (first delivered in 1819, and then again in 1825 and\n1832–3). Part of his motivation behind this eventual confrontation with the\nsubject—and part of the reason why it remains interesting\ntoday—derives from the fact that the phenomenon of art, and in\nparticular the phenomenon of non-linguistic art (e.g., painting,\nsculpture, and music), prompts a certain theoretical question that is\nof fundamental importance, not only for the philosophy of art itself,\nbut also for hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation, and for the\nphilosophy of language that underlies it: Do non-linguistic arts such\nas painting, sculpture, and music express meanings and thoughts, and if\nso how? This question is obviously important for the philosophy of art.\nBut it is also important for hermeneutics, or the theory of\ninterpretation, because it carries in its train such further questions as\nwhether the theory of interpretation ought not to treat additional\nforms of expression besides the linguistic ones that\nSchleiermacher’s own hermeneutics treats, what the appropriate\nmethods of interpretation might be in such additional cases, and how\nsuch additional cases and their interpretive methods might relate to\nlinguistic ones. Moreover, the question mentioned is also important for\nthe philosophy of language that underpins Schleiermacher’s theory\nof interpretation, as embodied in principles\n (4)\nand\n (5).\n For a positive answer to this question\nmight threaten those two principles, or at least show that they need\nmajor revision. In his last cycle of aesthetics lectures (1832–3)\nSchleiermacher initially pursued a very simple strategy for dealing\nwith these issues concerning non-linguistic art. However, he soon\nrealized that the strategy in question was untenable, and abandoned it\nfor a more promising but also more ambiguous position. His whole train of thought there closely followed one that Herder\nhad already pursued in the Critical Forests (1769), so it may\nbe useful to begin with a brief sketch of the latter. By the time of\nwriting the Critical Forests Herder was already committed to\nhis own versions of principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n Accordingly, in reaction to the phenomenon of the\nnon-linguistic arts the book initially set out to argue for a theory of\ntheir nature that would preserve consistency with those principles, and\nit did so in a very straightforward way, denying the non-linguistic\narts any the ability to express thoughts or meanings\nautonomously of language by denying them any ability to\nexpress thoughts or meanings at all: whereas poetry has a\nsense, a soul, a force, music is a mere succession of objects in time,\nand sculpture and painting are merely spatial; whereas poetry not only\ndepends on the senses but also relates to the imagination, music,\nsculpture, and painting belong solely to the senses (to hearing,\nfeeling, and vision, respectively); whereas poetry uses voluntary\nand conventional signs, music, sculpture, and painting employ only\nnatural ones. However, as Herder proceeded with his book he\ncame to realize that this simplistic solution was untenable: in the\nthird part of the book he stumbled upon the awkward case of ancient\ncoins, which, though normally non-linguistic, clearly do nonetheless\noften express meanings and thoughts in pictorial ways. This realization\ndid not lead him to abandon his versions of principles\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n however. Instead, it\nbrought him to a more refined account of the non-linguistic arts which\nwas still consistent with those principles: the non-linguistic arts do\nsometimes express meanings and thoughts, but the meanings and thoughts\nin question are ones that are parasitic on a prior linguistic\nexpression or expressibility of them by the artist. In the fourth\npart of the book (which was not published until the middle of the\nnineteenth century, and was hence unknown to Schleiermacher) Herder\nalready extended this solution from coins to painting; and in\nsubsequent works he extended it to sculpture and music as well. Schleiermacher’s aesthetics lectures follow a strikingly\nsimilar course. He at first sets out to develop a version of the theory\nthat Herder had initially developed in the Critical Forests,\ncorrelating the several non-linguistic arts with the different senses\nas Herder’s theory had done (his only significant revision here\nconsists in modifying Herder’s correlation of sculpture with the\nsense of touch to include vision as well as touch). Like Herder’s\ninitial theory, Schleiermacher’s is largely motivated by his\nprior commitment to principles\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n which, again like Herder’s initial theory, it\nseeks to vindicate in a naive way: non-linguistic arts, such as music\nand sculpture, do not express meanings or thoughts\nautonomously of language because they do not express them\nat all. For example, Schleiermacher argues that music merely\nexpresses physiologically based “life-conditions\n[Lebenszustände]”, not representations or thoughts.\nHowever, rather like Herder with his ancient coins, in the course of\ndeveloping this naive solution Schleiermacher stumbles upon a case that\nforces him to the realization that it is untenable: He develops his\nnaive solution smoothly enough for the cases of music and painting, but\nthen in the middle of his discussion of sculpture he suddenly recalls\nPausanias’s account that the very earliest Greek sculptures were\nmerely rough blocks whose function was to serve, precisely, as symbols\nof religious ideas (oops!). He subsequently goes on to note\nthat an analogous point holds for other non-linguistic arts, such as\npainting, as well. Accordingly, at this stage in his lectures he\nchanges tack. He now acknowledges that non-linguistic arts do\n(at least sometimes) express meanings and thoughts after all, and he\ngoes on to vacillate between two new, and mutually conflicting,\naccounts of that fact: (a) The arts in question do so in such a way\nthat the meanings and thoughts involved are at least sometimes not\n(yet) linguistically articulable. (In particular, he suggests that the\nearly Greek sculpture just mentioned expressed religious ideas that\nonly later got expressed linguistically.) This account would\nentail abandoning or at least severely revising principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n (b) The arts in question\ndo so in virtue of a pre-existing linguistic articulation or\narticulability of the same meanings and thoughts in the artist. (He\nactually only says in virtue of “something universal”,\n“a representation”, but a dependence on language seems\nclearly implied.) This account is similar to Herder’s final\naccount, and, like it, would preserve principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n In the end, then, having\nrenounced his initial—clearly untenable—position,\nSchleiermacher is left torn between these two more plausible-looking\npositions, which, however, contradict each other. The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German hermeneutic tradition\nas a whole was similarly torn between these two positions. As has\nalready been mentioned, (b) was the considered position at which Herder\neventually arrived. But (a) had strong champions as well—in\nparticular, Hamann, Wackenroder and Tieck, Hegel (concerning\narchitecture and sculpture), and the later Dilthey. The choice between\nthese two positions is a genuinely difficult one, philosophically\nspeaking. Where does this leave Schleiermacher in relation to the several\nissues bearing on his hermeneutics and his philosophy of language that,\nI suggested, encouraged him to undertake this investigation of\nnon-linguistic art in the first place? Concerning the primary question,\nwhether the non-linguistic arts express meanings and thoughts and if so\nhow, he has now realized that they do indeed (at least sometimes)\nexpress meanings and thoughts, but he remains torn on exactly how they\ndo so. Concerning his theory of interpretation, that realization is\nalready important, because it shows that interpretation theory does\nindeed need to extend its coverage beyond linguistic cases to include\nat least some cases of non-linguistic art. But he remains torn on the\nfurther issues in this area—in particular, on whether, as (a)\nimplies, there will be cases in which the interpretation of\nnon-linguistic art will transcend the interpretation of any associated\nlanguage or, as (b) implies, it will always be dependent on and\nrestricted by the interpretation of associated language. Finally,\nconcerning the philosophy of language that underpins his theory of\ninterpretation, he remains torn about whether the meanings and thoughts\nthat are expressed by non-linguistic art are always parasitic on\nlanguage (position (b)), so that principles\n (4)\nand\n (5)\n can be retained without any qualification\nor modification, or they are instead sometimes independent of language\n(position (a)), so that principles\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n will either have to be abandoned or (with\nHamann in his Metacritique [1784]) (re)construed in a way that\nstretches their reference to “language” and\n“words” to include not-strictly-linguistic-or-verbal symbol\nuse in the non-linguistic arts. Another motive behind Schleiermacher’s treatment of art in his\nlate aesthetics lectures concerns its cultural status, especially\nrelative to religion. It was an abiding concern of\nSchleiermacher’s from early in his career until the very end of\nit—one that set him at odds with the predominant tendency of\nearly German romanticism—to subordinate art to religion. The\nfinal cycle of the aesthetics lectures from 1832–3 is merely the\nlast in a long line of attempts to achieve this goal. It seems to me,\nhowever, that, partly for reasons already touched on, this last attempt\nturns out to be oddly and interestingly self-subverting. Let us first briefly survey Schleiermacher’s whole series of\nattempts to subordinate art, and then consider how this last one proves\nself-subverting. It was already one of the early Schleiermacher’s\nmain goals to turn contemporary culture, and especially the romantic\nmovement, away from the then fashionable idea that art was the highest\npossible type of insight toward the idea that religion was. This is an\nimportant part of the project of On Religion (1799), where he\ncriticizes the sort of elevation of art above religion that Goethe and\nSchiller had begun and the romantics had then accentuated, complains of\nthe trivial nature of modern art, and argues that art ought to subserve\nreligion, as Plato had thought. (The early Schleiermacher was in a way\nstrikingly successful in achieving his goal: after 1799, largely under\nhis influence, the leading romantics did increasingly turn away from\nart toward religion, and to some extent the same was also true of\nGerman culture more generally.) The ethics lectures of 1812–13\ncontinue the same project in a certain way. There Schleiermacher\nrepresents art as of its very nature a collective expression of\nreligious feeling (one that differs in accordance with the differences\nbetween religions). In other words, he represents art as only true to\nits own nature when it subserves religion. The 1830 psychology lectures\ndevelop an interesting variation on the same theme. There\nSchleiermacher argues that the perception of beauty is a feeling but\none that has a certain sort of deep cognitive content in that it\nexpresses the relation of intelligence to Being. This makes it sound\nvery much like religious feeling, and indeed in these lectures it is\ntreated as a sort of close second-in-command to religious feeling. It\nmight seem as though, from Schleiermacher’s standpoint, there was\na danger here of art acquiring too independent and exalted a status.\nHowever, that danger is in part averted by the fact that he is here\ntalking primarily about natural beauty, and only secondarily\nabout artistic beauty. The 1832–3 aesthetics lectures continue this sort of\nart-demoting project, but in a different manner. Schleiermacher’s\ninitial intention there, it seems, was to demote art (in comparison\nwith religion) in two ways: First, as we saw, the lectures initially\nset out to give an account of non-linguistic arts (music, painting, and\nsculpture) that represents them as merely expressive of sensuous\nfeelings and non-cognitive in character. Second, the lectures give an\naccount of poetry that represents it as merely national and indeed\nindividual in nature (not universal). Thus the lectures argue that art\ngenerally, and therefore poetry in particular, is national in nature,\nnot universal like science and (in a way) religion, and more radically\nthat it indeed has the function of expressing individuality, of\nresisting even the commonality of a national language (thereby making\nexplicit a potential that is also present, though less fully realized,\nin normal language use). However, as I suggested, this twofold strategy for demoting art\nturns out to be curiously self-subverting. For one thing, as we saw,\nthe model of non-linguistic art as merely sensuous and non-cognitive in\nthe end proves to be unsustainable. Moreover, not only does\nnon-linguistic art turn out to have a cognitive content after all, but\nin addition that fact becomes clear from a case (the earliest Greek\nsculpture) in which the content in question is not trivial but deeply\nreligious in character. Furthermore, this self-subversion would be even\nmore extreme if position (a) won out over position (b) in the end. For\nanother thing, poetry’s function of expressing individuality\nimplies that for Schleiermacher it represents the highest ethical\nvalue (for more on individuality’s high status in\nSchleiermacher’s ethics, see below). In short, what was intended\nas a demotion of art turns willy-nilly into a sort of\ncognitive-religious and ethical exaltation of it. Most of Schleiermacher’s earliest philosophical work was in\nareas of the subject that might reasonably be described as peripheral\nin comparison with such central areas as metaphysics and epistemology\n(in particular, ethics, philosophy of religion, and hermeneutics). This\nfact, together no doubt with the imposing presence of several\nintellectual competitors who had recently made or were making\ncontributions in those central areas (including Kant, Fichte,\nSchelling, and Hegel), seems to have spurred him to develop his own\ntreatment of them. The result was his “dialectics”, which\nhe began presenting in lecture-form in 1811. (This subject-title calls\nto mind relevant positions not only in Plato and Aristotle, but also in\nKant and Hegel.) Accordingly, Schleiermacher’s dialectics in some ways carries\nthe marks of a discipline that he felt forced to develop, rather than\none for which he had a clear, compelling vision (as he had for his\nphilosophy of religion and his hermeneutics, for example). For one\nthing, the nature of the discipline undergoes a striking shift between\nits two earliest versions (the lectures of 1811 and\n1814–15)—which have the character of fairly conventional\ntreatments of metaphysical and epistemological issues, already\nconcerned to some extent with resolving disagreements indeed, but in a\npurely theoretical way—and its two main later versions (the\nlectures of 1822 and the book-fragment from 1833), which make the art\nof resolving disagreements through conversation the core of the\ndiscipline (albeit that “conversation” here includes not\nonly the paradigm case of oral communication but also written\ncommunication and even dialogue internal to a single person’s\nmind). This shift might be roughly described as one from a more\nAristotelian to a more Socratic-Platonic conception of\n“dialectics”. For another thing, in all of its versions Schleiermacher’s\ndialectics has an oddly rag-bag appearance, including as it does not\nonly material that would naturally be classified as metaphysics and\nepistemology, but also large helpings of philosophy of mind, logic\n(especially the logic of concepts and judgments; Schleiermacher treats\nthe logic of syllogism in a reductive and rather deprecatory way),\nphilosophy of science, and philosophy of religion. In its final versions (on which I shall focus here), the discipline\nhas the following character: Its concern is with what Schleiermacher\ncalls “pure thought”, as distinguished from the thought of\neveryday affairs or of art—that is, with thought that aims at\ntruth, rather than merely at achieving practical ends or inventing\nfictions. (Schleiermacher denies, though, that the former is sharply\ndivorced from the latter two; rather, it is to some degree implicit in\nthem as well as vice versa.) According to Schleiermacher, genuine knowledge of its very nature\nrequires, not only (1) correspondence to reality, but also (2)\nsystematic coherence with all knowledge, and (3) universal\nagreement among people. The main motive behind this elaborate position\nseems to be the thought that there is in principle no way to determine\nthe fulfillment of condition (1) directly, so that believers\nneed to rely on guidance by the fulfillment of conditions (2) and (3).\n(The German scholar Manfred Frank, in a well known early interpretation\nof Schleiermacher’s dialectics that he gave in his book Das\nindividuelle Allgemeine (1985) accentuated condition (3), attributing to\nSchleiermacher on the strength of it a consensus theory of truth.\nHowever, in his subsequent edition of Schleiermacher’s dialectics\nlectures Frank rightly admitted that this interpretation had overlooked\nthe realism implied by condition (1). Incidentally, Frank’s\nself-correction of the reading of Schleiermacher’s dialectics\nthat he had given in Das individuelle Allgemeine also\nundercuts his equally well known early reading of\nSchleiermacher’s hermeneutics there, which built upon this\nascription to Schleiermacher of a consensus theory of truth an\nascription to him of a—roughly Gadamerian—conception of\ninterpretation as an ongoing construction of facts about meaning\nthrough the development of interpretations.) Not surprisingly given how strong the three conditions just\nmentioned are, Schleiermacher considers genuine knowledge to be only an\n“idea” toward which we can make progress, not something\nthat we can ever actually achieve. (Not coincidentally, this position\nresembles his official positions in hermeneutics and translation theory\nthat the correct understanding of another person and the correct\ntranslation of a text are only goals to which we can approximate, not\nones that we can ever actually achieve. This is a characteristically\nromantic pattern.) Schleiermacher’s dialectics is largely conceived as a\nmethodology for making such progress. This project proceeds relatively\nsmoothly in connection with conditions (1) and (2). For example, in\nconnection with (1), Schleiermacher develops certain principles\nconcerning how to form concepts correctly rather than incorrectly\n(i.e., in such a way that—as a more recent idiom would put\nit—they, their superordinate genus-concepts, their subordinate\nspecies-concepts, and their contrasting coordinate concepts\n“carve nature at the joints”). And in connection with (2),\nwhile he acknowledges that the task of forming a totality of knowledge\nis of its nature incompletable, he nonetheless prescribes what he calls\n“heuristic” and “architectonic” procedures for,\nrespectively, amassing pieces of knowledge and forming them together\ninto a coherent whole. However, the project runs into deeper difficulties in relation to\ncondition (3). There are two main problems here. First, besides the\nobvious and avowed impossibility of actually accessing all people in\norder to come to agreement with them, Schleiermacher also identifies a\nfurther obstacle in the way of reaching, or even making significant\nprogress toward, agreement with them: the deep differences that exist\nbetween different languages and modes of thought. The dialectics\nlectures fail to find a promising way of coping with this problem. The\n1822 version attempts to do so in two ways, but neither of them looks\nhopeful. Its first approach consists in hypothesizing a domain of\n“innate concepts” that are common to everyone (with certain\nqualifications, for example, that these concepts require sensations in\norder to be actualized). This would certainly solve the problem, but\nonly by contradicting Schleiermacher’s normal, and\nphilosophically more plausible, position, from which the problem arose\nin the first place, that there is no such conceptual common\nground between all languages (or even, Schleiermacher normally adds,\nbetween all individuals who in some sense share a given language). The\nsecond approach that the 1822 version tries is an argument that we need\nto develop a complete history of the differences in question and of how\nthey arose. However, this proposal seems beside the point—a\ndistraction from the problem rather than a solution to it. In his 1833 book-fragment Schleiermacher at some points seems close\nto giving up on this problem, saying in one place that because of it\ndialectics must restrict itself to a specific “linguistic\nsphere”. But at other points he evidently still clings to the\nhope of finding common ground that unites different “linguistic\nspheres”. What sort of solution does he have in mind? The answer\ncan perhaps be seen from an 1831 address that he delivered on\nLeibniz’s idea of a universal language. In this address he in\neffect argues that it was a mistake on Leibniz’s part to suppose\nthat there was already a conceptual common ground shared by\neveryone, which could be captured in a universal language (this also\namounts to a rejection of his own dubious idea in the 1822 lectures of\ncommon “innate concepts”), but that the sort of conceptual\ncommon ground that Leibniz had thus wrongly envisaged as\nalready existing can nonetheless be achieved (or at\nleast approached) for the sciences in the future, namely by cultivating\nan attitude of openness to the borrowing of conceptual resources from\nother languages according as such resources prove themselves useful for\nthe sciences (a process that, according to Schleiermacher, is in fact\nalready strongly underway, and which is realizable either through\nborrowing the foreign words in question outright or by translating them\ninto one’s own language in the sort of scrupulous way that his\ntheory of translation advocates). Schleiermacher notes that this\nsolution requires an (in any case healthy) shedding of prejudices about\nthe superiority of one’s own language, mode of thought, and\npeople over others. This looks like Schleiermacher’s most\npromising solution to the problem in question. He did not, however,\nlive long enough to develop it in detail or to build on it toward a\nmore complete method for resolving interlinguistic disagreements. The second, and perhaps more surprising, problem is that\nSchleiermacher’s dialectics lectures do not even develop a\nsubstantive account of how to resolve disagreements through\nconversation within a “linguistic sphere”.\nHowever, here again it is fortunately possible to supplement the\ndialectics lectures with additional material that goes further in such\na direction. One important text in this connection is\nSchleiermacher’s early essay Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct (1799), which is precisely concerned with the art of\nconversation within a linguistic sphere. This early essay emphasizes\nthe importance of finding (conceptual) “content” that one\nshares with one’s interlocutor(s), and restricting one’s\nconversation to this. Schleiermacher accordingly recommends that one\nbegin a conversation guided by a sort of minimal estimate of such\ncontent arrived at from one’s knowledge of such things as the\nprofession, the educational background, and the class of one’s\ninterlocutor(s), but that one then tentatively and experimentally work\noutwards toward identifying and exploiting further shared\ncontent—a process that he recommends one should undertake, not by\nthe heavy-handed method of introducing doubtfully shared content\ndirectly, but rather by the subtler method of introducing it indirectly\nin the form of a dimension of allusion and satire that one adds to\none’s treatment of already established shared content (after\nwhich, if the response from the interlocutor(s) is positive, it can\njoin the previously established shared content as a proper\nsubject-matter for direct treatment). Another helpful text in this connection is Schleiermacher’s\nhermeneutics lectures, which implicitly revise the earlier account just\ndescribed in two respects: (a) In that account conversation was to be\nrestricted to conceptual content that was already shared between\ninterlocutors. But as we saw previously, by the time Schleiermacher\nwrites the hermeneutics lectures he is skeptical that people\never really share conceptual content. Consequently, he would\npresumably now set the bar for fruitful conversation somewhat lower\nthan strict sharing. (b) Also, it seems reasonable to infer from his\nconception of hermeneutics that he would now place less emphasis on\ndiscovering pre-existing commonalities, or even near-commonalities, and\nmore on refining those found and establishing further ones—in\nboth cases, with the help of an adept use of the art of\nhermeneutics. Finally, Schleiermacher’s hermeneutics lectures also supply a\nfurther part of his seemingly missing solution to the problem of\nreaching agreement through conversation, both in inter- and in\nintra-linguistic contexts. Clearly, any art of reaching agreement\nthrough conversation is going to depend on an art of interpreting\ninterlocutors. Accordingly, the dialectics lectures explicitly assert\nthat dialectics is dependent on hermeneutics (as well as vice versa),\nSchleiermacher’s conception of hermeneutics as a universal\ndiscipline ensures its applicability to conversations, and\nSchleiermacher indeed mentions in the hermeneutics lectures that he\nsometimes applies his own hermeneutical principles in conversational\ncontexts. In short, Schleiermacher’s hermeneutics itself\nconstitutes an important component of his art of reaching agreement\nthrough conversation. In sum, whereas Schleiermacher’s final conception of\ndialectics as a discipline leads one to expect it to provide a fairly\ndetailed set of procedures for resolving both inter- and\nintra-linguistic disagreements in conversation (analogous to the\ndetailed set of procedures for interpretation that one finds in his\nhermeneutics), this expectation is largely disappointed by the\ndialectics lectures themselves. However, one can supplement the\ndialectics lectures from other texts in order to see how Schleiermacher\nmight have envisaged a fuller solution to this task. One last point that should be mentioned in this connection is the\nfollowing. Schleiermacher’s most prominent motive for developing\nsuch an art of conversation is the epistemological one described above.\nThat may or may not be a good motive in the end. However,\nSchleiermacher also has further, independent motives behind this art\nthat are more obviously attractive. Thus, his 1831 address on Leibniz\nimplies two additional motives behind the intercultural side of the\nart: first, Schleiermacher’s cosmopolitan concern for humanity as\na whole in all of its diversity constitutes a moral reason for\npromoting fruitful intercultural dialogue; and second, his sense that\ninsight, far from being a monopoly of our own, is dispersed among many\ncultures constitutes another reason for us to engage in such dialogue.\nSchleiermacher would presumably say that analogous considerations help\nto justify the intracultural side of the art as well. Again, the essay\nToward a Theory of Sociable Conduct emphasizes yet another\nmotive behind the intracultural side of the art. In this essay\nSchleiermacher does not yet mention his later epistemological motive at\nall, but instead focuses on more direct benefits that he expects from\nfruitful conversation between members of society, in particular the\nindividual’s enrichment of his own limited perspective through an\nincorporation of the different perspectives of other people.\nSchleiermacher would presumably say that an analogous consideration\nhelps to justify the intercultural side of the art as well. In short,\neven if it were to turn out that Schleiermacher’s predominant\nepistemological motive for developing an art of inter- and\nintra-cultural conversation were unpersuasive, such an art might still\nbe valuable for other reasons that he also has in mind such as these\nones. Finally, it is worth mentioning a few further positions that\nSchleiermacher develops in his dialectics, albeit more briefly. One\nrather striking position is a denial that any concepts, thoughts, or\ncognitions are either purely a priori in character or purely\nempirical—either the product of the “intellectual”\nfunction alone or of the “organic” function alone. Rather,\nall are the product of both functions—though the\nproportions in which they are involved vary from case to\ncase. More specifically, as Schleiermacher conceives the situation, all\nare located on a continuum that stretches between the maximally\n“intellectual” ideas of Being or God and the maximally\n“organic” chaos of sensations. These two extremes do not\nthemselves involve mixture: Being or God is purely intellectual, while\nthe chaos of sensations is purely organic. However, they do not for\nthat reason constitute counterexamples to the position just mentioned,\nbecause they are not themselves strictly speaking concepts, thoughts,\nor cognitions. As was mentioned previously, Schleiermacher’s theory of\nconcepts also says that they are in each case defined by relations of\nsubsumption under higher concepts, contrast with correlative concepts\nsimilarly subsumed, and subsumption of further concepts under them.\nSubsumption under the non-concept Being and the subsumption of a class\nof primitive judgments concerning sensations constitute special cases\nat the two extremes of this conceptual hierarchy. Another position that Schleiermacher holds is that the (Kantian)\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is a merely\n“relative” one. One reason for this position seems to lie\nin his view that all judgments are partly empirical in nature (a\nconsideration that anticipates Quine). But what he mainly seems to have\nin mind here is that it is always in some sense up to us to decide how\nmany and which characteristic marks to build into any given subject\nconcept, and therefore how many and which judgments in which that\nsubject concept features will count as analytic or as synthetic. A last feature of Schleiermacher’s dialectics is more\npuzzling. Schleiermacher notes at one point that he wants to chart a\nsort of middle course between ancient dialectics, which had the virtue\nof openness but the vice of courting skepticism, and the dogmatism of\nthe scholastics, for whom everything of importance was pre-decided in a\nreligious principle that they presupposed. His concession to the former\nposition has in effect already been described above. But what about his\nconcession to the latter? This takes the form of positing a\n“transcendental ground” or God which is (1) beyond all\noppositions, including those of thought/reality, thought/volition, and\nconcept/judgment, (2) beyond Being (even though Being is itself beyond\nsuch oppositions), (3) an essential impulse behind, and accompaniment\nof, all attempts to know, and (4) not thinkable or linguistically\nexpressible but instead felt. This is all rather mysterious. For\nexample, the philosophical rationale for positing such a\n“transcendental ground” or God as beyond rather than\nidentical with Being is obscure, and so too is the exact way in which\nit is supposed to be the impulse behind, and accompaniment of, all\nattempts to know. Schleiermacher’s ethical thought divides into two overlapping\nchronological phases. The first phase—which stretched from the\nlate 1780s until about 1803—was mainly critical in character.\nEarly in this phase, the three unpublished essays On the Highest\nGood (1789), On What Gives Value to Life (1792–3),\nand On Freedom (1790–3) mounted a sustained attack on\nKant’s ethical theory, and at the end of this phase the longer\npublished work Outlines of a Critique of Previous Ethical\nTheory (1803) developed that attack into a more comprehensive and\nsystematic critique of previous ethical theories. The second\nphase—which began around 1800—was by contrast mainly\nconstructive in character. To this phase belong the\nSoliloquies (1800), the Draft of an Ethics\n(1805–6), and Schleiermacher’s mature ethics lectures\n(including the complete draft from 1812–13, as well as a number\nof later partial drafts). The three early essays On the Highest Good, On What\nGives Value to Life, and On Freedom criticize and reject\ncentral tenets of Kant’s moral philosophy: in particular,\nKant’s inclusion in the “highest good [summum\nbonum]” of an apportioning of happiness to moral desert;\nKant’s position that this must be believed in as a presupposition\nof morality, so that its own implicit presuppositions, an afterlife of\nthe soul and a God, must be so as well (the doctrine of the\n“postulates”); and Kant’s incompatibilism concerning\ncausal determinism and the freedom that is required for moral\nresponsibility, and consequent recourse to the causally indeterministic\nnoumenal realm as the locus for freedom (On Freedom argues\nthat all human actions are causally determined, but that this is\ncompatible with the freedom that is required for moral\nresponsibility). A further area of disagreement with Kant forms the hinge on which\nSchleiermacher’s development of his own constructive ethical\ntheory turns. Kant’s fundamental moral principle, the\n“categorical imperative”, consisted, according to its\ncentral formulation, in a requirement that an agent’s moral maxim\n(or intention) be consistent when universalized, and was conceived by\nKant to apply uniformly to all human beings. Schleiermacher\nrejects this position in two ways. First, already in On What Gives\nValue to Life, and then especially in the Soliloquies, he\nargues against the latter idea of uniformity in ethics—instead\nasserting, in the spirit of Herder (and others influenced by Herder,\nsuch as Goethe, Schiller, and fellow romantics), the value of\ndiversity or individuality even in the moral sphere.\nIn this connection, Schleiermacher champions not only a (moral)\ndistinctiveness of different human societies vis-à-vis the human\nspecies as a whole (this had been Herder’s main cause), but also\na (moral) distinctiveness of the individual vis-à-vis his\nsociety (this had also been a cause of Herder’s). (In On\nReligion Schleiermacher makes an analogous case for both societal\nand individual diversity in religion. His positive evaluation of\nsocietal and individual diversity naturally also extends beyond morals\nand religion to other domains.) Second, Schleiermacher also rejects the content of Kant’s\n“categorical imperative” as specified by its central\nformulation: the requirement of consistency of a maxim under\nuniversalization. In On Religion and the Soliloquies\nSchleiermacher is rather inclined to champion Kant’s subordinate\nformula of a commitment to the welfare of humanity, though not\nin Kant’s sense of a common rational nature, but instead in\nHerder’s sense of all human beings in their diversities as well\nas their commonalities. (In On Religion he discusses the\nhistorical dimension of this principle of humanity in a Herderian\nspirit, like Herder in Ideas for the Philosophy of History of\nHumanity [1784–91] emphasizing the important role that has\nbeen played by (Christian) religion in advancing it, and interpreting\nhistory as its progressive realization.) This double position of Schleiermacher’s might seem to court\nthe following sort of problem: What if the moral values of a society or\nan individual conflict with the ideal of humanity? What, for example,\nif the society is Nazi Germany or the individual Hitler? In the\nSoliloquies Schleiermacher forestalls this sort of problem by\nlimiting the forms of moral distinctiveness and individuality that he\nsupports to those that are compatible with, or even supportive of, the\nideal of humanity. Thus he expresses his commitment to moral\ndistinctiveness or individuality in such formulas as that a person\nshould be an individual “without violating the laws of\nhumanity”, that “each human being should represent humanity\nin his own way”, and that what is valuable is a person’s\n“distinctive being and its relation to humanity”.\nSimilarly, Schleiermacher’s championing of (moral) diversity or\nindividuality is always combined with requirements of a measure of\nconformity with a broader species-wide or societal whole. This constructive tension between “distinctive\n[eigentümlich]” and “universal” sides\nof ethics survives to constitute the central principle of\nSchleiermacher’s mature ethics lectures. There he begins by\narguing that very general forms or analogues of such a constructive\ntension exist as universal facts of nature—that all finite beings\nexhibit such a tension, more specifically, that all life does so in the\nform of a tension between autonomy and social commonality, and more\nspecifically still, that all human mental life does so in this same\nform. He then goes on to derive from this a moral duty to realize such\na tension in one’s own person. This position prompts certain questions, to which the answers are\nnot entirely clear. First, is Schleiermacher not here guilty of the\nso-called “naturalistic fallacy”, that of attempting to\ndeduce an “ought” from an “is”? The answer\nwould depend on the exact nature of his derivation of the moral duty\nfrom the universal facts of nature, which is obscure. Second, how can a\nsynthesis of commonality with individuality both be an unavoidable fact\nabout human nature (e.g., since we can never quite share any\nconcepts, we also can never quite share any moral concepts in\nparticular) and be a moral duty? There are two possible answers to this\npuzzle. One would appeal to Schleiermacher’s determinism and\ncompatibilism: that a mode of existence or behavior is inevitable does\nnot for him preclude its moral obligatoriness. The other would instead\nappeal to the fact that the sort of synthesis in question can come in\nvarying degrees: it might be that some degree of moral\nindividuality is indeed inevitable for the reason mentioned but that\nthe degree that is morally required is greater. In addition to the central principle just discussed, three further\naspects of the mature ethics lectures are worth mentioning briefly: (a)\nAs was reflected in the argument just sketched, Schleiermacher’s\nmature conception of ethics is that it is fundamentally ontological\nrather than merely prescriptive in character: it is based on the\nimmanence of “reason” in “nature”, and is hence\nmore fundamentally a matter of an “is” than of an\n“ought”. (b) Accordingly (with an eye to the role of\n“reason” just mentioned), for Schleiermacher ethics is not\nfundamentally a matter of sentiments—which, he says, simply\nvary—but instead of cognitions, or more exactly, of something\nthat grounds both ethical sentiments and ethical cognitions. (Here\nSchleiermacher is close to agreement with Kant.) (c) Accordingly again\n(but this time with an eye to the predominance of ontology over\nprescription just mentioned), Schleiermacher divides his ethics into a\nDoctrine of Goods, a Doctrine of Virtue, and a Doctrine of Duties,\ntreating them in this sequence in order to reflect what he takes to be\nthe priority, or greater fundamentalness, of goods over virtues and of\nvirtues over duties. Despite all these intriguing lines of thought,\nSchleiermacher’s ethics lectures are not a great success. They\ncontain a rather unholy mixture of, not only ethics in the usual sense,\nbut also political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, and\nphilosophy of mind; lurch back and forth between claims of startling\ndubiousness and claims of startling banality (with too little in\nbetween); and hold all of this together with a thick stain of\nobscurantism and a thin varnish of systematicity. One is often left\nwith the impression that, having put the more critical phase of his\nwork in ethics behind him, Schleiermacher found that he did not really\nhave enough constructive to say about the subject to fill up the hours\nin the lecture hall. Schleiermacher’s political and social philosophy is found\nscattered through a considerable number of works from different\nperiods. Its most systematic, though not necessarily most interesting,\nstatement occurs in his lectures on the theory of the state, which were\ndelivered between 1808–9 and 1833. Concerning international politics, Schleiermacher’s\nfundamental position is thoroughly Herderian: a cosmopolitan commitment\nto equal moral respect for all peoples in all their diversity. This\nposition is already articulated in On What Gives Value to Life\n(1792–3); it is central to On Religion (1799) and the\nSoliloquies (1800), in the form of a commitment to the\nHerderian ideal of “humanity”; and it survives in later\nworks as well (for example, in the 1831 address on Leibniz’s idea\nof a universal language). Concerning domestic politics: Schleiermacher was always somewhat\nreticent about fundamental constitutional questions. To judge from his\nearly enthusiasm for the French Revolution, and his\nrepublican-democratic model of an ideal church in On Religion,\nthe early Schleiermacher was strongly attracted to republicanism and\ndemocracy (like Herder and the young Friedrich Schlegel). However, his\nlater position—while it still makes consent a conditio sine\nqua non of any genuine state—is more sympathetic to\naristocratic and monarchical forms of government. Thus in his lectures\non the theory of the state from 1829–33 he argues that whereas\nsmaller and “lower” states are naturally democratic, large\nand “higher” ones are naturally aristocratic or\nmonarchical. However, Schleiermacher’s domestic politics is more\nconsistently radical in another respect: liberalism. (Here again he is\nheavily indebted to Herder.) This ideal is already prominent in two\nworks from 1799: the essay Toward a Theory of Sociable Conduct\nargues that there should be a sphere of free (by which Schleiermacher\nmeans especially: state-free) social interaction, in order to make\npossible the development and communication of individuality; and On\nReligion argues strongly against state-interference in religion,\nmaking the liberation of religion from such interference a fundamental\npart of its program for developing individualism in religion, and\ndiagnosing some of the worst vices of current churches and religion in\nterms of such interference. This liberalism remains prominent in the\nethics lectures of 1812–13, which add to the positions just\nmentioned a proscription of state interference in the universities. And\nit is still central to Schleiermacher’s political thought in his\n(otherwise much more conservative) late lectures on the theory of the\nstate from 1829–33, where he argues that the three spheres of\nsociality, religion, and science (e.g., the universities) lie beyond\nthe legitimate power of the state, and notes critically that the\ncurrent (Prussian) state falls short of this ideal. His Augsburg\nConfession sermons from 1830 are likewise still liberal. Schleiermacher\nhas several reasons for this broad liberalism, but one of his most\nfundamental ones lies in the need to free up a domain in which the\nbasic good of individuality can develop. Schleiermacher devotes especially close attention to the question of\nreligion’s proper relation to the state (and to other\nsocio-political institutions). As was mentioned, in On\nReligion he indicates two main reasons why religion should be\nliberated from state interference: first, because individualism in\nreligion, the autonomous development of a multiplicity of forms of\nreligion, is valuable; and second, because state-interference corrupts\nthe nature of religion by, for example, attracting the wrong sorts of\npeople into leadership positions within the church (men with worldly\nskills and motives rather than religious ones) and foisting alien\npolitical functions onto religious mysteries such as baptism and\nmarriage. He argues that the true socio-political center of religion\nshould instead be the family—a position that he subsequently goes\non to illustrate in Christmas Eve (1806), a work that depicts\nin a literary way a sort of ideal interweaving of (Christian) religion\nwith family life. One especially important and interesting case to which he applied\nhis general insistence on the freedom of religion from\nstate-interference was that of Prussia’s Jews. (Once again,\nHerder had already set an example here—by both developing a\nhighly sympathetic interpretation of ancient Judaism and forcefully\ncriticizing modern anti-semitism.) In an early work on the subject of\nJewish emancipation in Prussia, Letters on the Occasion of the\nPolitical-Theological Task and the Open Letter of Jewish\nHouseholders (1799), Schleiermacher argues that Jews should\nreceive full citizenship and civil rights, provided only that they\ncompromise in their religious observances to a point that allows them\nto meet their duties to the state and that they give up such\npolitically threatening commitments as those to a coming messiah and to\ntheir status as a separate nation. He argues that Jews should not have\nto resort to the expedient of baptism as a means of achieving\ncitizenship and civil rights (as some (Jewish) contemporaries had\nproposed), on the grounds that this expedient would be detrimental both\nto the Jews and their religion themselves and to Christianity. In the\nlatter connection the main concern he expresses is that it would\nfurther water down an already rather watery church. But another of his\nconcerns is that it would in effect amount to yet more interference by\nthe state in a religious mystery (baptism). It is significant to note\nthat Schleiermacher adopts this strikingly liberal position concerning\nthe Jews despite himself being rather critical of Judaism as religion:\nin On Religion he argues that Reimarus’s conception that\nthere are deep continuities between Judaism and Christianity is\nmistaken, and that although Judaism was a beautiful religion in its day\nit has long since become corrupted and is now effectively moribund\n(unlike vibrant Christianity). A further important aspect of Schleiermacher’s socio-political\nphilosophy, especially in its earlier phases, is his proto-feminism (in\nwhich he is again influenced by Herder, who was a pioneer in this area,\nbut even more so by Friedrich Schlegel). His proto-feminism has several\nsides. First, he encourages women to strive for goods that have\ntraditionally been the monopoly of men. For example, in his short\nIdea for a Catechism of Reason for Noble Ladies, he enjoins\nwomen, “Let yourself covet men’s culture, art, wisdom, and\nhonor”. Second, as a special case of this, he encourages women to\nseek sexual fulfillment, and to free themselves from inhibitions about\ndiscussing sex. This is one of the central themes of his\nConfidential Letters Concerning Friedrich Schlegel’s\nLucinde (1800). Third, he identifies women as a source of valuable\nmoral and intellectual resources for the benefit and improvement of\nsociety as a whole. One example of this lies in their natural aversion\nto the sorts of insensitivity and violence to which men are commonly\nprone, and their potential ability to restrain instead of encouraging\nor permitting these. In this vein the Idea for a Catechism\nenjoins women, “You should not bear false witness for men. You\nshould not beautify their barbarism with words and works”.\nAnother (less morally urgent and more localized) example, discussed in\nToward a Theory of Sociable Conduct, concerns the ability of\nwomen, due to their broad education but their freedom from the narrow\nconfines of the professions, to direct social conversation away from\nlimited professional concerns toward deeper and more broadly shared\nones (Schleiermacher is thinking here especially of the hostesses of\nsalons of the period that he himself attended). Yet another example can\nbe found in an argument that Schleiermacher develops in his ethics\nlectures to the effect that women are by nature more attuned to\nrecognizing and respecting individuality, whereas men are more attuned\nto recognizing and respecting abstract generalizations, and that\naccordingly one of the key functions of marriage is to bring about a\nvaluable blending of these (equally important) intellectual-moral\nqualities in each partner. (It should be noted, however, that\nSchleiermacher in his later years tended to be more conservative in his\nviews about women.) At the risk of repetition, it is worth underscoring that in its\nbroad cosmopolitan concern for other peoples, Jews, and women\nSchleiermacher’s socio-political philosophy was continuing a\nparadigm that was above all the achievement of a single predecessor:\nHerder. Another noteworthy feature of Schleiermacher’s socio-political\nphilosophy, especially prominent in the works from 1799–1800, is\na broad critique of some central modern socio-economic institutions and\na set of proposals for remedying their harmful effects. (The\nSoliloquies casts this critique in the form of an attack on\nthe self-satisfaction of the Enlightenment very reminiscent of\nHerder’s attack on the same in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory (1774).) Three parts of Schleiermacher’s case are\nespecially interesting: First, in Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct he implicitly criticizes modern division of labor on the\ngrounds that it blinkers people, inhibiting their development of their\nown individuality and their sense for the individuality of others. His\nproposed solution here is the development of a sphere of\n“sociability”—that is, a sphere of free conversation\nand social intercourse, in which such one-sidedness can be overcome.\nSecond, in On Religion he criticizes the deadeningly\nrepetitive labor that is typical of modern economies as an obstacle to\nspiritual, and in particular religious, self-development. His proposed\nsolution here is mainly a hope that advances in technology will free\npeople from the sort of labor in question. Third, in On\nReligion and the Soliloquies he criticizes the hedonism,\nutilitarianism, and materialism of the modern age for preventing\npeople’s spiritual and religious self-development. His proposed\nsolution here is mainly the sort of revival of a vibrant religious and\nmoral life for which On Religion and the Soliloquies\nplead. Finally, another noteworthy aspect of Schleiermacher’s\npolitical and social philosophy is his philosophy of education, a\nsubject with which he engaged throughout his career. Especially\ninteresting in this regard is a work that he published in 1808 in\nconnection with the plans for founding a new university in Berlin (now\nknown as the Humboldt University): Occasional Thoughts on\nUniversities in a German Spirit, together with an Appendix on One about\nto be Founded. This work preceded Wilhelm von Humboldt’s\nbetter known pieces on the same topic, which date from 1809–10,\nand it evidently had a strong influence on them. Schleiermacher and\nHumboldt both write in a very liberal and progressive spirit (with only\nmodest differences of position), and thereby not only collectively\ngenerated the model of the university that Humboldt helped to implement\nin Berlin and which thereby became the model of the modern university\ntout court, but also developed many principles on the subject that\nwould still repay serious consideration today (for example, Britain\ncould learn a lot from them). Among the principles that Schleiermacher\ndevelops and which Humboldt took over are: a conception that\nthe university should promote not only knowledge but also\nindividuality; a principle that this requires the greatest possible\nindependence of the university from the state (something that will in\nthe end also serve the state’s own interests better); a principle\nthat it also requires that there should be as much freedom as possible\nwithin the university for both faculty and students; a\nprinciple that students should be admitted to university regardless of\ntheir class provided only that they are academically qualified; a\nprinciple that philosophy should replace theology as the top faculty; a\nprinciple of combining research with teaching; and a principle (based\non a philosophy of language that Schleiermacher shares with Humboldt\naccording to which not only is language fundamental to thought but also\noral language is more fundamental than written) that the teaching in\nquestion should be primarily oral in character (for Schleiermacher the\nlecture, for Humboldt the seminar). Indeed, Schleiermacher is in\ncertain ways even more radical and progressive than Humboldt in that\nhe, for example, explicitly calls for the university to be run on a\ndemocratic model and demands that students from the lower\nclasses not only be admitted to university but also receive financial\nsupport from the state in order to enable them to attend. Schleiermacher also gave more general lectures on pedagogy, or the\nphilosophy of education, in 1813–14, 1820–1, and\n1826—among which those from 1826 are most fully developed. But by\nthe time he delivered this last cycle of lectures his views had become\nmuch more politically conservative and orthodoxly Christian, so that\nthe radical edge of his earlier work on the subject was blunted, the\ninterests of the state and the church were now assigned greater weight\nas goals of education, and such principles as freedom in education\naccordingly underwent heavy qualification. Schleiermacher’s most radical and important work in the\nphilosophy of religion is On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured\nDespisers from 1799. (Later editions of this work, and the later\ntheological treatise The Christian Faith, strive for greater\nChristian orthodoxy, and are consequently as a rule less interesting\nfrom a philosophical point of view.) As its title implies, the project of On Religion is to save\nreligion from the contempt of enlightenment and especially romantic\nskeptics about religion, “its cultured despisers”. At least\nwhere the romantics were concerned, the work was strikingly successful\nin this regard, in that several of them, especially Friedrich Schlegel,\ndid turn to religion following the book’s publication (though\nadmittedly not to quite the sort of religion that Schleiermacher had\nenvisaged). Schleiermacher’s later philosophy of religion has a\nsimilar motivation. In his 1829 open letters to Lücke he\nespecially emphasizes the pressing need to defend religion against the\ntwin threats posed to it by modern natural science and modern\nhistorical-philological scholarship. This project of defending religion against educated skeptics is\nreminiscent of Kant’s similarly motivated critical philosophy.\nSchleiermacher is also sympathetic to Kant’s strategy in\nconnection with religious matters of “deny[ing] knowledge in\norder to make room for faith” (Critique of Pure Reason,\nBxxx), and in particular to Kant’s attack on the traditional\nproofs of the existence of God; Schleiermacher himself denies that\nreligion is a form of knowledge or can be based on metaphysics or\nscience. However, as can already be seen from his early unpublished\nessays On the Highest Good (1789) and On What Gives Value\nto Life (1792–3), Schleiermacher’s approach is in\nother respects defined more by opposition to than by agreement with\nKant’s. In particular, Schleiermacher sharply rejects\nKant’s alternative moral proof of an otherworldly God\nand human immortality (i.e., Kant’s proof of them by showing them\nto be necessary presuppositions of morality); for Schleiermacher\nreligion can no more be based on morality than on metaphysics or\nscience. As this stance already suggests, Schleiermacher has a large measure\nof sympathy with the skeptics about religion whom he means to answer.\nBut, at least in his early period, his sympathy with them also goes\nmuch deeper than this. In On Religion he is skeptical about\nthe ideas of God and human immortality altogether, arguing that the\nformer is merely optional (to be included in one’s religion or\nnot depending on the nature of one’s imagination), and that the\nlatter is downright unacceptable. Moreover, he diagnoses the modern\nprevalence of such religious ideas in terms of the deadening influence\nthat is exerted by modern bourgeois society and state-interference on\nreligion. He reconciles this rather startling concession to the\nskeptics with his ultimate goal of defending religion by claiming that\nsuch ideas are inessential to religion. This stance strikingly\nanticipates such later radical religious positions as Fritz\nMauthner’s “godless mysticism”.\n(Schleiermacher’s own later religious thought tended to backtrack\non this radicalism, however, restoring God and even human immortality\nto a central place in religion.) This naturally leaves one wondering what the content and the\nepistemological basis of religion are for the early\nSchleiermacher. As can already be seen from the 1793–4 essays\nSpinozism and Brief Presentation of the Spinozistic\nSystem, and then again from On Religion, he follows\nSpinoza in believing in a monistic principle that encompasses\neverything, a “one and all”. However, he also modifies\nSpinoza’s conception in certain ways—partly under the\ninfluence of Herder (whom he mentions by name in the essays on\nSpinoza). In particular, whereas Spinoza had conceived his monistic\nprinciple as a substance, Schleiermacher follows Herder in thinking of\nit rather as an original force and the unifying source of a\nmultiplicity of more mundane forces. (Later on Schleiermacher distanced\nhimself from this neo-Spinozistic position. Indeed, he explicitly\ndenied that he was a follower of Spinoza. Accordingly, in the\ndialectics lectures he argued that there was an even higher\n“transcendental ground” beyond the Spinozist\nnatura naturans or the Herderian highest force. His main\nmotive behind this change of position seems to have been a desire to\navoid the heavily charged accusations of Spinozism and\npantheism—which is hardly an impressive motive philosophically\nspeaking.) So much for the early Schleiermacher’s conception of the\ncontent of religion. What about its epistemological basis? As was\nmentioned, for Schleiermacher religion is founded neither on\ntheoretical knowledge nor on morality. According to On\nReligion, it is instead based on an intuition or feeling of the\nuniverse: “Religion’s essence is neither thinking nor\nacting, but intuition and feeling. It wishes to intuit the\nuniverse” (OR Second Speech:\n22). The term “intuition” here is both revealing and\nproblematic. As Kant had defined it, “intuition is that\nthrough which [a mode of knowledge] is in immediate relation to\n[objects]” (Critique of Pure Reason, A19). So part of\nwhat Schleiermacher means to convey here is evidently some sort of\nimmediate cognitive relation to some sort of object, namely, the\nuniverse as a single whole. On the other hand, the term\n“intuition” also imported certain implications that\nSchleiermacher in fact wanted to avoid. In particular, Kantian pure or\nempirical intuition required the addition of concepts in order to\nconstitute any sort of real insight (“intuitions without concepts\nare blind”—Critique of Pure Reason, A51), whereas\nSchleiermacher had in mind a sort of insight that is unmediated by\nconcepts. In the later editions of On Religion he therefore\nretreated from speaking of “intuition” in connection with\nreligion (instead reserving this term for science), and instead spoke\nsimply of “feeling”. In accordance with this change,\nThe Christian Faith went on to define religion more\nspecifically as a feeling of absolute dependence, or what\nSchleiermacher also described in his open letters to Lücke as the\nimmediate consciousness of “an immediate\nexistence-relationship”. A further aspect of the “feeling” on which\nSchleiermacher bases religion should also be mentioned: its inclusion\nof motivating force, its self-manifestation in\nactions. The wish to include this aspect was one of\nSchleiermacher’s reasons for supplementing religious\n“intuition” with “feeling” even in the first\nedition of On Religion. And his later work emphasizes this\ndimension of religious “feeling” as well. This whole epistemological position looks suspiciously like\nphilosophical sleight-of-hand, however. “Feelings” can be\nof at least two very different sorts: on the one hand, non-cognitive\n“feelings”, such as physical pains and pleasures; on the\nother hand, “feelings” that incorporate beliefs, for\nexample, a feeling that such and such is the case. Whereas the\npossession and awareness of non-cognitive feelings such as pains and\npleasures may indeed be conceptually unmediated, beyond mediation by\nreasons for or against, and hence in a sense infallible, the possession\nand awareness of feelings that incorporate beliefs, for instance, the\nfeeling that such and such is the case, does require conceptual\nmediation, is subject to reasoning for or against, and is fallible. As\ncan be seen from the neo-Spinozistic content that\nSchleiermacher’s religious intuition or feeling was originally\nsupposed to have, his original characterization of it as an intuition\nin the Kantian sense of an immediate cognitive relation to an object,\nhis later characterization of it as representing “an immediate\nexistence-relationship”, and so on, he does not mean religious\nfeeling to be merely non-cognitive, but rather to incorporate some sort\nof belief. However, he also helps himself to the apparent\nepistemological advantages that belong only to non-cognitive feelings:\nnon-mediation by concepts, transcendence of reasons for or against, and\ninfallibility. In short, it looks as though his epistemological\ngrounding of religion in “feeling” depends on a systematic\nconfusion of these two crucially different sorts of cases. Turning more briefly to some additional features of\nSchleiermacher’s philosophy of religion in On Religion:\nHe recognizes a potentially endless multiplicity of valid religions,\nand strongly advocates religious toleration. However, he also arranges\nthe various types of religion in a hierarchy, with animism at the\nbottom, polytheism in the middle, and monotheistic or otherwise\nmonistic religions at the top. This hierarchy is understandable given\nhis fundamental neo-Spinozism. More internally problematic, however, is a further elaboration of\nthis hierarchy that he introduces: he identifies Christianity as the\nhighest among the monotheistic or monistic religions, and in particular\nas higher than Judaism. His rationale for this is that Christianity\nintroduces “the idea that everything finite requires higher\nmediation in order to be connected with the divine” (i.e., the\nhigher mediation of Christ) (OR Fifth Speech: 120).\nBut this looks contrived. It is left unclear why “higher\nmediation” is supposed to be a good thing. Moreover, even if one\nwere to grant that it is, why do other monotheistic religions such as\nJudaism not share in this putative advantage as well, namely, in the\nform of their prophets? And if the answer is that this is because\nprophets are not themselves divine, then why is the mediator’s\ndivinity supposed to be such a great advantage? In addition, Schleiermacher remarks insightfully on the\ndistinctively polemical nature of Christianity, the striking\nextent to which Christianity’s religious and moral standpoint is\ndefined by a hostile opposition to other standpoints, and even to other\ndissenting positions within Christianity itself. This observation\nrecalls that of another well-informed and honest Christian, Montaigne,\nwho had noted in his Apology for Raymond Sebond (1580) that\n“there is no hostility quite as perfect as Christian\nhostility”. And it is amply borne out by the historical\nevidence—for example, the bloody early history of Christianity,\nthe Crusades, the Inquisition’s treatment of Jews and witches,\nthe Wars of Religion of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and\nmany other, similar horrors (all of which only stopped, or at least\ndiminished, when Christianity was rendered politically impotent by the\nEnlightenment and the American and French Revolutions in the eighteenth\ncentury). Moreover, this striking feature of Christianity has since\nreceived deeper explanations—including Jan Assman’s\nobservation that Judeo-Christian-Muslim religion was from the start a\nsort of “anti-religion [Gegenreligion]”, defined\nby its opposition to other religions and cultures, and\nNietzsche’s observation that Christianity and its morality\nspecifically were from the beginning a reaction against Greek and Roman\nculture motivated by resentment against Greek and Roman imperial\noppression in Palestine and elsewhere, so that, for example, (a point\nthat Nietzsche does not himself make clearly) the Greeks’ most\ngeneral word for a god, daimôn, became the Christian\nconcept of a demon, and (a point that he makes very clearly)\nChristian moral values performed a systematic inversion of traditional\nGreek and Roman values. So Schleiermacher’s observation is an\ninsightful one. But then how can a proponent of religious pluralism and\ntoleration like Schleiermacher consistently see this striking trait of\nChristianity as anything but a very serious vice? On the (flimsy) basis of his perception of Christianity’s\nsuperiority as a religion, Schleiermacher also tries to reconcile his\nneo-Spinozism with traditional Christian doctrines as far as possible.\nThis project already begins in a modest way in On Religion,\nwhere, for example, he tries to salvage the Christian doctrine of\nmiracles in the modified form of a doctrine that classifies\nall events as miracles (insofar as viewed from a religious\nperspective). A similar project is pursued more elaborately (and\ntediously) in The Christian Faith. Finally, a more fruitful contribution of Schleiermacher’s to\nthe study of Christianity was the series of lectures on the life of\nJesus that—under the influence of two late works of\nHerder’s: On the Savior of Mankind according to our First\nThree Gospels (1796) and On God’s Son, the World’s\nSavior, according to John’s Gospel (1797)—he began to\ndeliver in 1819 and which were published posthumously. Schleiermacher\ntried in these lectures to combine an interpretation of Jesus as a mere\nhuman being with a claim that his extraordinary level of awareness of\nGod nonetheless amounted to a sort of presence of God in him. This\ncompromise was strained and implausible. But Schleiermacher’s\nproject nonetheless constituted an important step toward much more\nconsistently naturalistic and plausible treatments of the life of Jesus\nby subsequent scholars, especially David Friedrich Strauss’s\nThe Life of Jesus, Critically Examined (1835–6).
