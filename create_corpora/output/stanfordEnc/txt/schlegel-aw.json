Schlegel (Sept. 5, 1767, Hanover – May 12, 1845, Bonn)\nwas a German essayist, critic, translator, philosopher, and poet.\nAlthough the philosophical dimension and profundity of his writings\nremain underrated, he is considered to be one of the founders of the\nGerman Romantic Movement—which he conceived of as a European\nmovement—as well as one of the most prominent disseminators of\nits philosophical foundational ideas, not only in Germany but also\nabroad and, most notably, in Britain.\n\n\nSchlegel had an outstanding knowledge of art, history, literature,\narchitecture, anthropology, and foreign languages, which made him a\ndecisive figure in the early development of comparative literature\n(cf. Craig 2000: 864) and modern linguistics, and with the creation of\nthe journal Indische Bibliothek, he inaugurated the domain of\nSanskrit studies in Germany. He also wrote poetry and drama; but he is\nmostly known for his critical writings and his brilliant translations\ninto German of Shakespeare, which are still used today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust Wilhelm Schlegel was son of Johanna Christiane Erdmuthe\nSchlegel (née Hübsh) and Johann Adolf Schlegel, who was a\nLutheran clergyman and poet. He was born in September of 1767, in\nHanover. He initiated his studies at the University of Göttingen\nin 1786, first in theology and later in classical philology and\naesthetics. It is also in Göttingen that he first met Wilhelm von\nHumboldt and Caroline Michaelis (Caroline Böhmer after 1784), an\nintellectual and scholar who encouraged him and also participated in\nhis Shakespeare translations.  His youngest brother, Friedrich\nSchlegel, joined him in 1790. During this period, he was influenced by\nsome of his lecturers, such as Heyne, Bürger, and Eschenburg, and\nthe works of authors such as Johann Gottfried Herder (cf. Ewton 1972\nand Hölter 2010: 16–18). August Schlegel finished his\nstudies in 1791 and moved to Amsterdam where he worked until 1795 as a\nprivate teacher of Willem Ferdinand Mogge Muilman. In 1796 he moved to\nJena to work as a literary critic. His brother Friedrich also followed\nhim to Jena, and they both joined important artists and philosophers\nsuch as Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Dorothea Schlözer, and\nF.W.J. Schelling, thus forming the ‘heart’ of the so\ncalled Jena Romantik. In this same year, he married the widow\nCaroline Böhmer, whose role in A.W. Schlegel’s translations\nof Shakespeare as well as other writings attributed solely to him\n(such as the dialogue Die Gemälde, first published in\nthe Athenaeum in 1799) was much more\nimportant than has been acknowledged. In fact, as Ernst Behler claims,\nCaroline “had a decisive influence upon the formulation of early\nRomantic theory” (Behler 1993: 40). \nIn 1798, tired of the publishing difficulties endured within the\nexisting literary journals, A.W. Schlegel and his brother Friedrich\nSchlegel founded the famous periodical Athenaeum. They were\nboth the editors and the main writers of this journal, which would\noffer an alternative to mainstream classicist approaches in literary\ncriticism and which was soon to become one of the main outlets of the\nGerman Early Romantic Movement. The Athenaeum was devoted\nprimarily to literary criticism with a philological and historical\nperspective, and a large section of it featured the review of\ncontemporary literature. It contained critical essays, fragments,\nletters, announcements, and dialogues and appeared twice a year in the\nperiod between 1798 and 1800. Most importantly, though, the\nAthenaeum became the “leading publication of the early\nRomantics” (Behler 1993: 36). \nIn that same year, 1798, A.W. Schlegel started giving Lectures at the\nUniversity of Jena. He also continued his translation of the works of\nShakespeare (1797–1810), but on the whole his new involvement\nwith the university meant that his presence in the Athenaeum\nwould suffer, as did his marriage (Paulin 2016: 126). In 1801 Schlegel\nmoved alone to Berlin, where he also lectured on literature and art at\nthe University. Both his Jena (1798–1799) and his Berlin\nLectures (1801–1804) were highly didactic while at the same time\ninterspersed with important philosophical insights. So, as well as\nproviding a comprehensive vision of the history of European\nliterature, poetry, and mythology, Schlegel presented a new critical\nand philosophical (i.e., systematic) approach to art and its history.\nSome of these lectures were published in literary journals, until 1884\nwhen they were posthumously collected as Vorlesungen über\nphilosophische Kunstlehere (Lectures on Philosophical Art\nEducation) and Vorlesungen über schöne Literatur\nund Kunst (Lectures on Fine Art and Literature)\nrespectively. Four years later, in Vienna, Schlegel delivered another\nseries of lectures elaborating upon some of the ideas he had developed\nin his previous work. A literal transcription of these lectures was\npublished between 1809 and 1811 as Vorlesungen über\ndramatische Kunst und Literatur (A Course of Lectures on\nDramatic Art and Literature). A more extended version of his\nCourse of Lectures was published in an 1816 edition: by that\ntime, they had already been translated into English, French, Dutch,\nand Italian and had obtained a wide circulation. Later Schlegel shows\nawareness of the fact that he was read “not only from Cadiz to\nSt. Petersburg, but in North America as well and even as far as\nAsia” (Paulin 2016: 561). Indeed, the successful circulation of\nhis Vienna Lectures facilitated the dissemination of the fundamental\nideas underlying the Romantic Movement throughout Europe, and helped\nto solidify Schlegel’s influence and reputation as a critic. \nAfter his divorce from Caroline Michaelis, who left him for his friend\nthe philosopher F.W.J. Schelling, Schlegel became Mme. de\nStaël’s constant companion on her travels in Germany,\nItaly, France, and Sweden until her death in 1817. He also was tutor\nof her children. In August 1818 he married Sophie Paulus in\nHeidelberg, but they only remained together for a few weeks. Sophie\nnever accompanied him to Bonn, where Schlegel was appointed Professor\nof Literature and Art History and lectured until 1844, a year before\nhis death. \nAlongside his academic work, A.W. Schlegel was a remarkably talented\ntranslator; he translated over 16 Shakespearean plays, five plays by\nCalderón de la Barca, and selected pieces by Dante, Petrarch,\nGiovanni Boccaccio, Miguel de Cervantes, Torquato Tasso, and\nLuís de Camões, published in 1804 as\nBlumensträusse italiänischer, spanischer, und\nportugiesischer Poesie, (Bouquets of Italian, Spanish, and\nPortuguese Poetry). He also made the first complete translation\nof the Bhagavadgītā from Sanskrit into Latin, which\nhelped to promote and popularize the book in Germany (cf. Adluri and\nBagche 2014: 33f.). \nA.W. Schlegel can rightly be regarded as one of the first and most\nsignificant founders of Indology in Western Europe. Apart from his\ntranslations of Sanskrit texts, and the publishing the scholarly\njournal Indische Bibliothek (1820–1830), he set up a\nSanskrit printing press with which he provided the first printed\neditions of the Bhagavadgītā (1823) and\nRāmāyana (1829) in continental Europe.  An anthology of some of A.W. Schlegel’s critical essays,\nselected by the author himself, was published in Berlin in 1828.\nDespite his opposition to the publication of the rest of his essays,\nA.W. Schlegel’s ‘collected works’ were edited by E.\nBöcking and published in 16 volumes between 1846 and 1848 (the\ncollection is not complete). Since then, there has been no standard,\ncritical edition of his works. A critical edition of his Vienna\nlectures was edited by E. Behler in 1989 (the edition of his complete\nlectures is still in progress), and (some of his) his letters were\nedited by J. Körner and published in 1930. All in all, the\nsituation of A.W. Schlegel’s texts leaves much to be\ndesired. \nEspecially during the Athenaeum period, Schlegel’s\nwritings are witty, original, and sagacious in both form and content\n(e.g., Die Sprachen, Die Gemälde). After this\nperiod, i.e., once he started lecturing at the University, his style\nseems to lose its boldness and wit, gaining perhaps in depth and\nerudition. Some scholars suggest that these two developments are not\nunconnected (cf. Paulin 2016: 126).  Thus, while stressing their\nformal perfection, critics of his literary writings\n(Gedichte, 1800;\nIon, 1803; Poetische Werke, 1811) tend to justify\nhis lack of success as a poet. It is as if A.W. Schlegel was not able\nto follow the aesthetics standards that he himself had developed\ntheoretically. Other scholars, however, consider his play Ion\na great success. But, on the whole, Heinrich Heine’s view that\nboth Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel “were critics and\ninterpreters rather than poets” (Heine [1833] 1985: 2) seems to be\nwidely accepted (cf. Craig 2000: 863; Ziolkowski 2016: 270), even by\nthose who are critical towards Heine’s extremely negative and\nsarcastic outbursts against the Schlegels. \nBy contrast, Schlegel’s lectures as well as his translations\n(some of which are still used today) were very successful and\ninfluential. It was indeed A.W.  Schlegel’s lectures, with their\nparticular view of world literature as an organic whole, that were to\ninfluence many authors.  F.W.J. Schelling (the most Romantic of the\nGerman idealist philosophers) and G.W. Hegel, for instance, used\nSchlegel’s Jena lectures as a basis for the elaboration of\ntheir Lectures on the Philosophy of Art (1802–1804)\nand Lectures on Aesthetics (1818) respectively. But\nA.W. Schlegel’s influence was not restricted to Germany\nalone. His lectures, having been translated into many languages and\nsuccessfully promoted by authors such as Mme de Staël (Grundmann\n2005: 40), were also extremely influential abroad—S.T. Coleridge\nbeing perhaps the most notable example (cf. Helmholtz-Phelan 1907). In\nthe preface to his critical essays (Kritische Schriften,\nBerlin, 1828), Schlegel explains how many of the\n‘revolutionary’ ideas he had formerly defended in his\nessays and lectures had been internalized and normalized by those very\ncritics who had once rejected them with\ncontempt. A.W. Schlegel’s response to this was modest: he said,\nhe had just been able to foresee the coming shift of taste and\nevaluative parameters in the understanding and the interpretation of\nworks of art (KS: I, vi). \nSome critics have argued that, as a literary critic, A.W. Schlegel is\nmore empirical and less philosophical than his brother Friedrich\n(cf. Welleck 1955: 72–73). And it has even been questioned\nwhether A.W. Schlegel is the genuine creator of the ideas laid out in\nhis writings and lectures (Heine [1833] 1985: 47). Yet, however convincing\nthe distinction between ‘having\ncreated’ the ideas as opposed to merely ‘having\ndisseminated’ them may seem, this claim is quite\ndisputable. Schlegel’s philosophical analyses of art and the\nartist were undoubtedly inspired by his reading of and/or encounters\nwith Herder, Kant, Fichte, Goethe, Schiller, and Schelling among\nothers, but he developed his own poetology. A.W. Schlegel’s\nlectures had a unique dialectic character (Schlegel himself suggest\nthat his lectures are to be understood as a dialogue), combining high\ntheoretical standards with an appealing, empirical approach, thus\noffering “one of the first narratives of the historical and\nphilosophical interrelation of all art forms” (Franzel 2014:\n351). In the development and presentation of his theoretical position,\nhe was indeed less speculative than other German philosophers (such as\nHegel). But as Walter Benjamin notes, this is the result of a\nconscious decision to make room for a more critical approach, which\nrenders Schlegel’s position surprisingly modern (Benjamin [1920]\n1996: 118). In a mixture of pride and censure, Schlegel frequently\nnotes how German authors are more speculative than practical (LDA: 16\nand 440). Moreover, his aesthetical essays can be seen as a comment on\nand criticism of those more speculative Germanic approaches in which\nthe particular work of art and the artist seem to be relegated to a\nsecondary level and are treated like the piece of a theoretical\n‘whole’. Die Gemälde, a dialogue on painting\nas well as a fictive visit through the gallery of Dresden (cf. Penzel\n2007: 77ff.) that he co-wrote with Caroline Michaelis, is a good\nexample of this, precisely for the attentive way in which it\napproaches and engages with the individual paintings (Paulin 2016:\n160). Overall, though, A.W. Schlegel’s writings are prolific,\nbut remain somewhat unfocused and repetitive. As Schlegel himself had\noften regretted, by taking too many different topics into\nconsideration, his work lost the intensity of its philosophical and\ncritical insights. \nAlthough Schlegel’s lectures were “avidly devoured by\nintellectuals from all of the European countries” (Engel and\nLehmann 2004: 84) and in spite of what could be regarded as quite a\nsuccess during his lifetime—Schlegel himself was proud to have\nbeen read “from Cadiz to Edinburgh, Stockholm and St.\nPetersburg” (Schirmer 1986: 233) –, the works of A.W.\nSchlegel have suffered from an arguably unfair and prejudiced neglect.\nA first full-scale biography was only published in 2016 (!). In this\nbiography, Roger Paulin argues that Schlegel’s reputation\n“never quite recovered from Heine’s devastating attack in\nDie Romantische Schule of 1835” (Paulin 2016: 3).\n“Apart from the Vienna Lectures and the Shakespeare\ntranslations”, he writes, “it is Heine’s attack that\nremains in the general consciousness”, so that in the end the\nimage that pervades is one of “decline,\ndéchéance, decrepitude, impotence”\n(Paulin 2016: 542). Nonetheless, the recent rising number of\ndissertations, articles, and even monographies (such as\nPaulin’s) dedicated to different aspects A.W. Schlegel’s\nwritings, seem to suggest that there is a slow but steady change of\nattitude towards his work. \nDespite the emphasis the ‘Romantics’ laid on the\nindividual artist, the figure of the genius, originality, and\nindividuality in general (cf. Schulte-Sasse [1985] 1988:\n136–137), the conceptualization of the Romantic Movement itself\nneeds to be understood essentially as a collective process.\nAnd yet, as problematic as it may be to ascribe the original\nconception of the romantic aesthetical and philosophical precepts to\none author alone, A.W. Schlegel’s influence in the\nconceptualization as well as the dissemination of some of the most\ncharacteristic and informing principles of German\nRomanticism—including the term ‘Romantic’\n(romantisch) itself (cf. Ferber 2005)—is by no means\ntrivial. Indeed, if the periodical Athenaeum (which A.W.\nSchlegel co-edited and co-created with his brother Friedrich) was to\nbecome the ‘organ’ of the Romantic Movement, it is\nundisputable that A.W. Schlegel’s popular lectures in Jena\n(1798), Berlin (1801–1804), and Vienna (1808–1812)\n“disseminated the aesthetics of German Romanticism across\nEurope” (Engel and Lehmann 2004: 84). \nThe Romantic Movement emerged, on the one hand, as a reaction against\nClassicist and Neoclassicist aesthetical ideals (largely based on\nmimesis and representation, Behler 1993: ix), and on the other, as a\ncritique from the somewhat blind faith in reason set up by the\nEnlightenment and which had proved to be unsatisfactory. Until the\ncreation of the Athenaeum, A.W. Schlegel had published some\nof his writings in Friedrich Schiller’s periodical Die\nHoren (which was to Weimar Classicism what the Athenaeum would be\nto German Romanticism). Both he and his brother, Friedrich, however\nsoon realized that their particular aesthetic views, philosophical\ninsights, and literary criticisms (which they shared or thought to\nshare with a number of authors such as Novalis, Tieck, Fichte, and\nSchleiermacher) needed a new, adequate space to be published without\nconstraints. The Athenaeum was created with precisely this\nview in mind and was to provide an alternative space that was open to\nnew aesthetic ideas. And although it was conceived as a collective\nwork with an intended and welcomed diversity of positions, styles, and\nliterary forms (letters, aphorisms, dialogues, literary criticism,\netc.), their main idea was that they would publish only those pieces\nthat they could consider as “their own” (A: I, iv). In\neffect: there were two editors, several writers, and a diversity of\nopinions, but one unifying principle (A: I, vi). The\nAthenaeum thus became the hotbed for powerful, original and\nphilosophically revolutionary ideas and insights about poetry,\nliterature, and art in general (cf. Paulin 2016: 118).  \nBut, in order for these ideas to have the transformative effect that\nthe German Romantic movement actually had within and beyond Germany,\nthey needed to be not only systematized and organized into a more\ntangible unit, but also disseminated to broader audiences. This is\nprecisely the role that A.W. Schlegel’s lectures played (cf.\nFranzel 2014). As Jochen Schulte-Sasse, argues: Schlegel’s\nBerlin Vorlesungen über schöhne Kunst und Literatur\n(‘Lectures on Fine Arts and Literature’), which he gave\nbetween 1801 and 1804, “have to be seen as a programmatic\nattempt to explain early Romantic theories of art in a relatively\n‘popular’ and accessible form” (Schulte-Sasse [1985]\n1988: 136). Indeed, the last series of these lectures\n(1803–1804) were dedicated entirely to the ‘History of\nRomantic Literature’. These Berlin lectures, however, were not\npublished until 1884 (and to my knowledge never translated into\nEnglish), but Schlegel made an effort to circulate them; for instance\nhe sent them to Schelling, who then used them for his own Jena\nlectures on art. To be sure, Schlegel’s later Vienna lectures,\nwhich were translated into several languages and rapidly disseminated\nacross Europe, were largely based on his Berlin lectures. \nThroughout his lectures and essays, A.W. Schlegel praised the plays of\nShakespeare and Calderón to the detriment of French\nNeoclassical theatre. This criticism was not arbitrary, but was part\nof a systematic and organic comprehension of art and art history.\nHowever, his harsh attack on classical rules considered\n‘sacred’ by French critics predisposed the latter to react\nwith hostility (especially to the publication of the polemical\nComparaison entre la Phèdre de Racine et celle\nd’Euripide, in 1807), whilst being favored by English\nreviewers. In fact, the rediscovery of Shakespeare’s greatness\nin the 19th century was due, not only to Schlegel’s\ntranslations, but most importantly to his special approach to\nShakespearean theatre: instead of comparing Shakespeare to ancient\nTragedy, as if it were a bad copy, Schlegel claimed it should be\nanalyzed on the grounds of constituting a necessary and historical\ndifference. This difference—the difference between the\nancients and the modern—was the cornerstone of Schlegel’s\ncritique and set the basis for his theoretical use of the concept\nRomantic, which became the key-concept in his comprehension\nand reevaluation of modernity. \nIn effect, most commentators credit A.W. Schlegel for having given the\nword ‘romantic’ a systematic significance and affirmative\ntone from the very beginning (Furst 1969: 84). In contrast with other\nliterary critics who used the term in contradictory and erratic ways\n(or avoided it altogether, such as Schelling, even if he based his\naesthetics on the difference between the Ancient and the Modern),\nSchlegel believed it was important to transmit a clear-cut\nunderstanding of the term and “to elevate it again to its true\nsignification” (LDA: 441). Indeed, his purpose was to foster a\nsolid movement that should become the symbol of modernity and Germany\nas well as Europe, as he clearly indicates in the introduction to his\nBerlin lectures:  \nI say, I hope to fully dispel the doubt that still arises here and\nthere as to whether there really is a romantic, i.e., specifically\nmodern art: an art that does not follow the model of the Ancient and\nis nevertheless appreciated as fulfilling the highest principles\n[…], a perfectly achieved art; in other words, I hope to dispel\nthe doubt that there is a poetry that is not merely nationally and\ntemporarily interesting, but universal and eternal. (VLK: III, 7) \nAlthough subject to scholarly debate (Esterhammer 2002a: 153),\nSchlegel’s profound influence on English Romanticism through\nColeridge is widely accepted. Some authors even claim that Coleridge\nfound in Schlegel’s lectures the lucidity and sharpness\nregarding some of the main romantic principles and criticisms that he\nhad lacked until his encounter with the Vorlesungen über\ndramatische Kunst (Helmholtz-Phelan 1907: 361). Schlegel’s\nwritings made Shakespeare one of the most universally known and\nrevered authors, not only in Germany arguably in England too. In the\nend, however, Schlegel was quite pessimistic about the actual\ninfluence he had had in his time, and lamented that his efforts had\nfallen so far short of his desire to inspire an artistic movement and\ndefine an epoch. \nArt is not a mere ‘imitation’ or\n‘representation’ of nature; art is the product of a\ncreative force. This sentence, crystallizing one of the\nfundamental ideas of German Romantic aesthetics, constitutes the core\nof one of A.W. Schlegel’s most well-known Berlin lectures. It\nwas published in the Viennese journal, Prometheus in 1808 and\nre-collected in his Kritische Schriften (1828) as\nÜber das Verhältniss der schönen Kunst zur Natur;\nÜber Täuschung und Wahrscheinlichkeit; Über Manier und\nStil (On the Relationship of Art to Nature; On Illusion and\nProbability; On Style and Manner). The importance of this essay\nlies not only in this thesis (an idea that we also find in other texts\nof that period, such as Schelling’s 1807 essay Über das\nVerhältniß der bildenden Künsten zu der Natur (On the\nRelationship of Visual Arts to Nature), but rather in the way\nSchlegel developed his argument. \nIn this text, Schlegel argues in favor of a Modern (i.e., Romantic)\nart theory, in opposition to the representationalist and mimetic\ndoctrines that go back to Aristotle’s Poetics and\nconceive the work of the artist as that of a craftsman copying the\nbeauty of nature (Abrams 1953: 48). But his critique of the classicist\nformula ‘art imitates nature’ was accompanied by a careful\nanalysis of the different meanings the term ‘nature’ had\ncome to assume within aesthetic discourses. This philological and\nhistorical approach is distinctive of Schlegel’s writings and\nlends intelligibility and clarity to the texts without eroding their\nphilosophical sharpness. Undoubtedly, the Romantic notion of art goes\nhand in hand with a reevaluation of the concept of nature. Similar to\nother authors who also were inspired by Spinoza’s distinction\nbetween natura naturans and natura naturata,\nSchlegel argues that, from a philosophical point of view, everything\nparticipates in an ongoing process of creation, whereas, from an\nempirical point of view, natural things are conceived as if they were\ndead, fixed and independent from the whole. This means that, in its\npurest and philosophical sense, nature is not perceptible in the same\nway the worldly objects are. However, unlike Schelling with his\n‘intellectual intuition’ or intellektuelle\nAnschauung, Schlegel did not develop an elaborate theory to give\naccount of this different form of perception; he succinctly argued\nthat the comprehension of nature’s true essence is more like a\npresentiment (ahnen) or an aesthetic contemplation,\nthan like scientific knowledge. In order to realize this\n‘Romantic’ notion of nature, one needs to comprehend or\nrather feel oneself as an organic whole. One needs to achieve\nself-awareness and to recognize oneself as forming part of a larger\nunity. This resort to a non-theoretical or non-discursive plane as an\nessential constituent of human knowledge was also important in\nSchlegel’s philosophy of language, which he already expounded in\nhis Letters on Poetry, Meter and Language (Briefe\nüber Poesie, Sylbenmaß und Sprache) in 1795.  \nIn any case, the philosophical or Romantic notion of nature as an\nunfathomable unity and creative force that cannot be seen nor touched,\nand which is obviously a direct response to some of the many questions\nraised by Kant’s three Critiques, is not to be\nunderstood as a mere intellection, an empty chimera: Nature is the\nproductive force pulsing in all living beings. For Schlegel, nature is\norganic in the sense that it is an organized and organizing principle,\ngranting intelligence to the totality of existing beings. It is a\ncreative force that produces independent living things, the life of\nwhich does not need any external mechanism to keep its autonomy, for\nit only depends on its inner, natural power to live (as is the case\nwith Leibniz’ vis activa). At this point Schlegel\nmentions the astrological doctrines that claim that even the tiniest\natom is a mirror of the universe. The idea of Nature mirroring itself\nin each and every living organism is characteristic both of German\nIdealism and German Romanticism. The difference between human beings\nand other animals, plants, or mineral structures is that, (1) human\nbeings are able to understand the fact that they, as an organism,\nmirror Nature’s organic structure; and furthermore, (2) that\nthey are capable of reproducing nature’s creativity through art,\nas well as reflecting upon this fact. This reasoning induced Schlegel\nto define human genius and his/her poetical creativity as a whole\n(i.e., art and language) as the capability of producing a world within\na world (Müller-Vollmer 2000 [2002]: 317); a definition which is\nmost tangible in dramatic literature. \nSchlegel’s criticism of the physicalists’ conception of\nnature is surely the result of a very specific aesthetic and\nphilosophical perspective. But this particular viewpoint enabled him\nto reinterpret and give a new meaning to the old and criticized\nformula ‘art imitates nature’. Indeed, once we conceive of\nnature as an organic whole, constantly becoming and transforming\nitself, then the sentence is quite different and seems to capture not\nonly the true essence of (Romantic) art, but also its most fundamental\nprinciple. It is in this sense that Schlegel polemically will say that\n“art should imitate nature” (SW: III, 306). The\ndeficiency of the formula does not lie in the idea itself, but in the\nmeaning we give to its components. In a very precise sense, art\nimitates nature, because in his or her creativity, the\ngenuine artist (i.e., the Romantic artist) also seeks to\nproduce an organic whole and thereby embody an eternal truth. For\nSchlegel, it is only through art and through everything that art\nsignifies, that man is capable of attaining that seemingly\nlost unity. \nTo be sure, if art is seen as the embodiment of an eternal truth, of\nabsolute beauty, this implies that art is not Beauty itself.\nThis is also why, according to Schlegel, each work of art is the\nexpression of a certain longing, a craving for the recreation of that\nvery unity experienced through the “spiritual feeling or\nintuition (geistige Anschauung) of Nature” (SW: III,\n307). For Schlegel, it is only through art and through everything that\nart signifies, that man is capable of attaining (even if not\nabsolutely) such a wholeness, i.e., to recover what is felt as a\n‘lost’ unity. The idea of longing or Sehnsucht is\nindeed essential in Schlegel’s account of Romanticism and must\nbe understood in relation to the difference between ancient and modern\nart, which also was the structuring principle and, in a sense,\nconstituted the real object of Schlegel’s analysis in his\nLectures on Dramatic Art. This opposition may be summarized\nas follows: whereas ancient poetry is plastic, sensual, harmonious,\nand, overall, a poetry of enjoyment of the present; modern poetry is a\npoetry of desire and longing (Sehnsucht), hovering between\nthe idealizations of a remote past and an unknown future (LDA: 9).\nAccording to Schlegel, these differences encompass every sphere of\nreality and every form of art, and are on the whole the result of a\nhistorical event, namely the establishment of Christianity. \nAs F.W.J. Schelling had done in his Lectures on the Philosophy of\nArt of 1803, what Schlegel emphasizes about the transition from\npaganism to Christianity is that it involved the realization of an\ninsurmountable breach between subject and object, between the I and\nthe World, i.e., between consciousness and nature. Christianity, he\nargues, awakened the consciousness of the internal rupture or\nfundamental discord between the finite and the infinite which, in\nSchlegel’s analysis, is constitutive of modernity. In other\nwords, for Schlegel, modernity arises from the painful realization of\nan insurmountable fissure, and the subsequent insight that real\nhappiness can never be attained, i.e., “that no external object\ncan ever entirely fill our souls; and that every mortal enjoyment is\nbut a fleeting and momentary deception” (LDA: 9). As a result,\nin Schlegel’s view, to understand modern and especially Romantic\nliterature means to understand art as the eternal longing for the\nreconciliation of this fissure between the subject and the universe,\nthe finite and the infinite or the divine. Both the realization of the\ninsurmountable fissure as well as the longing for its reconciliation\nare part of a particular way of experiencing nature, the self, and the\ninfinite. \nIn their attempts at finding alternative ways of understanding reason\nand its relation to life, art and feelings, the Romantics also tried\nto recuperate or rediscover elements from what had been regarded as\nthe irrational and mythical spirit of the Middle Ages. Schlegel uses\nthe term ‘Romantic’ to denote the very specific historical\nand stylistic discrepancy between German and Modern art, on the one\nhand, and Ancient and Classicist art, on the other. Schlegel argued\nthat German culture, which he defined as having a natural inclination\ntoward the Romantic (LDA: 439), was indebted to all the cultures which\npreceded it. But he specifically laid the roots of the so-called\n‘Romantic spirit’ in chivalry, i.e., in the union of the\nheroism of the northern conquerors with the humanistic principles of\nChristianity. Schlegel associated chivalry and the Middle Ages in\ngeneral with a certain form of purity that manifests itself (1) in a\nmore spiritual understanding of love and female worth, to the extent\nthat one could talk of a fusion between the metaphysical longing for\nthe infinite (or God) and the erotic longing for a woman; and (2) in a\n‘heroic’ morality. It is a morality “that never\ncalculated consequences, but consecrated unconditionally certain\nprinciples of action” (LDA: 8). On the other hand, though,\nSchlegel’s genealogy of the ‘romantic’ would be\nincomprehensible without paying attention to his openness to and\ninterest in other cultures and languages. Thus, the ‘Romantic\nspirit’ is also found in the works of Shakespeare, and sought in\nthe spirit of romance cultures and languages, which, for Schlegel, are\nthe result of a fusion between Latin and Teutonic languages, in a\nsimilar way as German Romanticism “is the fruit of the union of\nthe peculiarities of the North with fragments of antiquity”\n(LDA: 5). \nFor Schlegel, in the same way as nature—the true\nexperience of nature— cannot be reduced to its mere\nphysical or external manifestations, both the work of art and the\nexperience it evokes are more than just the simple perception or the\nanalysis of its forms. Thus, he argues, the true work of art, in order\nto endure the shifting modes and fashions of time, must have something\nmore profound than just a beautiful form, in the same way a flower\nneeds its roots and cannot survive long without them. For Schlegel, as\nfor Schelling or Novalis, the attempt to understand the work of art as\nthe result of the conscious decisions of the artist alone would be\nmisleading, because there is always an unconscious element in every\nartistic creation. The work of art is a result of both conscious and\nunconscious forces. In other words, the artist’s\nintention is, to a great extent, irrelevant for the\nartistic product, and hence, cannot play a major role in the\nevaluation of the work itself. In his Lectures on Dramatic\nArt, Schlegel defines genius as someone being capable of the\n“almost unconscious choice of the highest degree of\nexcellence” (LDA: 5), and in an Athenaeum fragment he\nclaimed that “it is a distinguishable mark of poetical genius to\nknow a great deal more than he knows he knows” (SW: VIII, 15).\nThis does not mean that any sign of an ‘unconscious’\nchoice in the production of art is a sign of genius; what is\ncharacteristic about the great artist is that his/her\n‘unconscious’ choices seem attributable to a higher,\ndivine and conscious force. The extent to which the artist is\ncapable of transcending his/her more or less involuntary\nparticularities, i.e., the extent to which his/her choices seem to\nderive from an unconscious ability to select always the highest degree\nof excellence, determines the difference between style and\nmannerism. When the work of art appears as if all\nits elements had been consciously chosen by a power above and beyond\nthe artist, it has style; when the artist has not transcended\nhis/her individuality, then s/he is categorized as mannerist\n(SW: III, 309–312). \nThe essence of a work of art, the principle that all real\nworks of art have in common and what makes them more than a mere\naccumulation of particular elements, is what Schlegel called the\n‘poetical’. Consequently, the ability to grasp whatever\nis truly poetical in a specific work of art set the basis for\nhis methodological procedure in his art criticism. For Schlegel, a\ncriterion for evaluating a work of art is its capacity to extend\nitself “beyond the limits of reality into the region of a\ncreative fancy” (LDA: 107–108). On the other hand, the\npoetical aspect of a work of art depends on its capacity to mirror and\nto present (darstellen) eternally true ideas (LDA:\n18). But, as in many aesthetic texts from this period, it is not\nalways obvious which ‘ideas’ the work of art must seek to\nmirror. It seems these ‘ideas’ should be understood in a\nPlatonic sense, as they generally refer to great values or great\nideals such as beauty, greatness, and goodness. \nHowever, and partly due to his reluctance to consider the\nartist’s intentionality as being decisive in the comprehension\nof the work of art (which in some way prefigures the late Romantic\nideal of l’art pour l’art), Schlegel did not\nunderline a necessary moral purpose in aesthetic objects. And yet, for\nSchlegel, this did not imply that the contemplation and understanding\nof art should lose its moral aura. Quite to the contrary, for\nSchlegel, art has the power to elevate us above our ordinary\nencounters with the world, above the sorrows and daily troubles of\nlife. This is why he argued that the purpose of art could not be a\nmere imitation or reduplication of the world as it is,\nbecause in this case, apart from the fact that music, dance,\narchitecture, and so many other art forms become totally inexplicable,\nthe best works of art would be the ones that deceive the most, in the\nsense that the viewer would find himself prevented from contemplating\nthe work of art as a work of art. Clearly, if the purpose of\nart were to replicate nature (understood as an object rather than a\nsubject) the aesthetic objects would evoke no particular interest\nbeyond mere ornamentation. But, for Schlegel, both the\ncontemplation/critique and the production of art should be seen as the\nresult of creative activity.  \nIn accordance with these theoretical assumptions, Schlegel was very\nnegative about naturalistic neo-classicist tendencies in art. He\npraised wholeness and poetical unity as well as originality in a work\nof art. For Schlegel, similarly as for Baumgarten, the magic of a work\nof art is that it creates and hence brings us into a different world,\nwith all its own internal coherence. It is in this sense that a work\nof art is organic and complete. The purpose of a work of art should\ntherefore not be to reflect the real world with naturalism, but rather\nto create its own world, which could never be a question of applying a\nset of rules and principles to a particular matter (paintings, words,\nmarble), such as classicist aesthetics seemed to suggest. The search\nfor naturalism and plausibility, in an attempt at producing the most\ntrue and real representation of reality, makes art lose its greatness,\nbeauty, and wonder. \nIn his Lectures on Dramatic Art, Schlegel praised the use of\nmasks in theatrical representations as well as those performers who\nmanaged to create an emotional distance between themselves, the\naudience and the role they were playing. Once more, art is not about\ndeceiving or hiding, but about the production or the creation of a\nworld within a world. This also explains Schlegel’s admiration\nof Old Comedy, because in this case the spectator is constantly forced\nto remain aware of the experience in which s/he is partaking, namely\nthe experience of the difference between reality and illusion. A\nsimilar reconsideration of comedy was also the basis for other\ncontemporary authors in Schlegel’s circle, such as Ludwig Tieck\nwith his version of the 17th century fairy tale Der\ngestiefelte Kater (Puss in Boots). Schlegel stresses\nthat, in contrast to tragedy (where the author needs to remain\ninvisible to guarantee the integrity of his/her fictional world); in\ncomedy, the gap between the different levels of reality and illusion,\nor rather, the very disintegration of the unity of the story becomes\nthe center of the play. As Schlegel puts it, in Old Comedy: “the\nwhole production was one entire jest within itself” (LDA: 108).\nIn Aristophanes’ plays, the chorus, which regularly interrupts\nthe course of the play to address the audience with reference to the\nstory (parabisis), the author and the people from the\naudience alike, virtually destroys all the elements and\ncharacteristics of tragedy: its seriousness as well as its harmonious\nunity is systematically parodied. Not only the scenes, not only the\npoetry, but also the tragic composition, the music, acting, and\ndancing, were object of a hilarious distortion. For Schlegel, this did\nnot mean that comedy should be understood as a derivative of tragedy;\non the contrary, he affirms it to be “a species of poetry as\nindependent and original as tragedy itself” (LDA: 108). In fact,\nA.W. Schlegel’s characterization of the distinction between the\ncharacter of Old Comedy and Greek tragedy would become a central\nreference in literary criticism. \nAmong all the different artistic manifestations, Schlegel considered\ndramatic poetry to be “the most entertaining of all\ndiversions” (LDA: 12). The fundamental reason for dramatic\npoetry’s being so engaging, as Schlegel points out, lies in the\nmimicry that is always involved in theatrical representations.\nSchlegel maintained that all works of art, and in particular, all\ntheatrical representations, are expression of the idiosyncrasies of\nthe country where they are produced. And although he succinctly\nsuggested that the existence of a theatrical tradition may be seen as\na symbol of a special intellectual and political environment, he also\nindicated that the enjoyment of mimicry per se is somehow constitutive\nof human beings (Flaherty 1994: 195). For Schlegel, children’s\ndelight in imitating their relatives is also expressive of man’s\nbasic psychological predisposition to mimicry (LDA: 18); a disposition\nwithout which man would not be able to enter the linguistic, let alone\nthe poetical and creative phases of his development (SW: VII, 117).\nDramatic poetry, he argued, is the representation of an\n“important” action, namely an action that has been purged\nof the petty and unnecessary details of real life; it is the\nperformance of a morally and intellectually exemplary action through\ndialogue. Schlegel’s placing of dramatic poetry in the highest\nrank amongst the arts hardly makes his position unique. What does\nrender him quite distinctive, rather, is the argument he gives, namely\nthat it produces the maximum enjoyment. This certainly contrasts with\nSchiller’s moralizing views. Schlegel was very aware of the\nnecessity for a play to be interesting and exciting for the audience:\nthe greatness of a play has to do with the way in which it creates a\ncertain tension or conflict that involves the audience. But, what\nmakes dramatic poetry different from a mere pantomime, what really\nelevates it above other human activities is, once again, its poetical\nelement, i.e., its capacity to mirror an idea or eternal truth.\nUltimately, this is also what determines the difference between\ntragedy and comedy. The tragic tone is given through a sincere\nmelancholy, a longing for and accepting of a “destiny soaring\nabove this earthly life”, whereas the main characteristic of\ncomedy is its “forgetfulness of all discouraging\nconsiderations” (LDA: 24). For Schlegel, the aim of tragedy is\nnot “to purify the passions by pity and terror” (LDA: 43),\nas Aristotle had said, but to elevate us “to the most dignified\nview of humanity” (LDA: 112). In fact, Schlegel’s analysis\nof Greek tragedy and his sharp rejection of Aristotle’s theory\nof tragedy were extremely influential.  \nIn his Lectures on Dramatic Art Schlegel was very critical\ntowards the present state of German theatre (LDA: 438). However, apart\nfrom Shakespeare, Calderón with their ironic way of mixing the\ntragic with the comic (LDA: 175), and the ancient Greek, Schlegel also\npraised Lessing, Schiller, and Goethe for having “redeemed the\nGerman theatre from its long continued mediocrity” (LDA:\n424). \nIn his Letters on Poetry… from 1795, addressed to a\nfictional Amalie, Schlegel discusses the origins of language;\na theme, to which he would later return in his Jena and Berlin\nlectures. Schlegel was thus resuming an old philosophical debate which\nhad formed two opposite hypotheses (Behler 2002: 124–128). The\ntwo basic and mutually exclusive positions maintained, on the one\nhand, as Schlegel portrays them, that human language must have\noriginated as a transcription, representation, or imitation of\nexternal objects; and, on the other, that in its origin\nlanguage must have been purely sensual, i.e., a mere form of\nexpression of emotions through sounds. Thus, either directly or\nindirectly, Schlegel was referring to authors such as Condillac,\nHemsterhuys, Karl Phillip Moritz, August Ferdinand Bernhardi, Fichte,\nHerder, and Rousseau. However, in contrast to Herder (and even his own\nbrother Friedrich) for whom the debate about the origin of language\nwas primarily a debate about whether its origin was natural or divine,\nfor Schlegel, the real question at stake was the extent to which the\nnature of language could be reduced to and explained in pure\nrationalistic terms. Furthermore, in these letters Schlegel implicitly\nquestions the possibility of attaining absolute knowledge solely\nthrough theory, i.e., attending only to a scientific rationale that\nnecessarily excludes more metaphorical and intuitive approaches, which\nattempt to understand and grasp things “under the mysterious\nlight of twilight” (SW: VII, 110). For Schlegel, in any case,\nthe real problem lay in the assumed exclusivity of both alternatives\n(cf. Behler 2000: 126).  \nSchlegel’s decision to present his position in an epistolary\nform, mixing different styles of argumentation, is an almost necessary\nconsequence of his approach to the debate: a lively debate, which he\naimed to dissolve by reconciling both perspectives but without\nnegating any of them. In a way, these letters are a clear example of\nthe fusion between content and form. In fact, Schlegel actually\nmodified his last Letter after having received a commentary,\nthrough a missive, from Friedrich Schiller (Behler 2002: 126). For\nSchlegel, the only plausible theory on the origin of language had to\ntake into account both its irrational elements (i.e., the purely\nemotional, imaginative, sensual, and most radically communicative\naspects of language) and its rational characteristic (i.e., a system\nof signs based on convention), while admitting that on the whole, the\norigin of language remains as secret and inexplicable as the origin of\nhumanity itself (SW: VII, 111). In brief: for Schlegel, as for Novalis\nor Schleiermacher, language could not be reduced to a mere system of\nsigns and any account of the origin of language had to be able to\nintegrate the two apparently opposite aspects of it. \nFor Schlegel, language, in its most elementary conception, constitutes\nthe basic means of communication of immediate feelings, and therefore\nrepresents a dimension that is also present in other animals. Children\nlearn to move their tongues, Schlegel notes, even before they learn to\nuse their feet (SW: VII, 117). But in human language, this\ncommunicative capability is also the tool that enables man to surpass\na pure naturalistic or animalistic sphere. Indeed, for Schlegel, as\nfor Herder, language is the quintessence of human beings. Language, on\nthe one hand, represents our rupture with nature, but, on the other,\nit constitutes our first and most fundamental contact with the world:\n(1) it is the true condition of possibility of our orientation in the\nworld; and (2) it provides us with the unique opportunity of\ncommunicating with other people and of developing subjectivity.\nMoreover, for Schlegel, the world as such only makes sense through or\nwithin language. It is through language that we tear ourselves away\nfrom nature and constitute ourselves as a subject. Language is what\ntakes us beyond ourselves; it is the “magical power” that\nleaves room for the incorporeal, unphysical in us (SW: VII, 139). \nSchlegel accepts the idea that, in its beginning, language was\nprobably a direct expression of feelings and emotions through sounds.\nThe origin of language, he argues, must have been very close to the\ncry of animals and the singing of birds, an idea that he reinforces\nthrough the fact that we all began to use our voices by screaming (SW:\nVII, 115). But to this basic point, Schlegel also adds the idea of\nrhythm. In his letters, he suggests that the rhythmic character of\nlanguage is as old as poetry, and moreover, as old as human life. The\noldest or the first language, he argues, must have been\nindivisible from tones, rhythms, music, and dance. Poetry, or rather\nrhythm, he affirms, is thus essential to language itself. Indeed, it\nwould be impossible to eliminate rhythm from language (SW: VII, 108).\nIn other words, Schlegel claims that, in its origin, language was\npoetry (SW: VII, 104). Most important, though, is that Schlegel\n“does not limit the realm of sensuality and feeling to an early\nstage in the formation of language” (Behler 2000: 81). For\nSchlegel, this more sensual aspect of language is always present:\nhowever civilized a people may be, they cannot avoid using\ndifferent tones and rhythms to express themselves (SW: VII, 115). Each\nutterance, each sentence is spoken with a certain rhythm, each word\nalso carries the way in which it is said, the way in which it\nrefers to the world, and all these elements constitute an aspect of\nlanguage, for they help to establish the ultimate meaning of the\nwords. This, as Schlegel points out, becomes most obvious once we\nrealize that, in order to comprehend the emotions that are being\ntransmitted through a particular speech, one does not need to\nunderstand the words literally (SW: VII, 114). \nThus, for Schlegel, language not only was poetry in its origin:\nlanguage is essentially poetry. Or as he would later claim in\nhis Berlin lectures: “language is an ongoing becoming and\ncontinually changing, never ending poem of human kind” (VLK: I,\n388). Thus, the nature of language should be understood, not as a more\nor less automatic response to the necessities the world imposes upon\nus, but as a creative, poetical ability. For Schlegel, the\ncharacterization of language as poetry is the only way a theory of\nlanguage could give account of language’s inherent spontaneity\nand creativity. In a certain way, Schlegel was reinterpreting Herder\nthrough Fichte, emphasizing Fichte’s idea of man’s\nself-possession and his relation to the world as an active and not a\npassive one. This also explains the importance Schlegel gave to the\nrole of the poet (and to the literature translator) in the development\nof the language of a nation. For Schlegel, as for Wilhelm von\nHumboldt, the task of the poet and also that of the translator is to\nbroaden the signifying and expressive capacity of a language. The\npoet, Schlegel says in his 1796 text The Works of Homer by\nVoss, is the force that renders language alive, which\nnevertheless does not mean that s/he may introduce any kind of\nchanges: language’s malleability also has its grammatical and\nphilological limits (KS: I, 75–76 and 116–117). \nIn his philosophical account of the fact that language is constantly\nchanging and moving from lower to higher stages, Schlegel operates\nwith two very different ways of approaching language, which, at the\nsame time, reveal the co-existence of two opposite but equally\nconstitutive forces in the development of a language: the\nartist’s language-shaping efforts and the grammarian’s\njudicial function (SW: VII, 117). In this way, Schlegel is somehow\nanticipating Saussure’s extremely influential distinction\nbetween langue and parole. For Schlegel, as for\nSaussure or Deleuze, the tension between language as an ordered and\nstable whole, and language as the subject of a more or less arbitrary,\nfree and creative development, is what makes language something\nalive. \nIn a similar way, Schlegel affirms that our encounters with the world\nare always poetical, in the sense that they are not be merely\nreceptive, but also creative. Reality exists through language, or, in\nother words, we always relate to the world metaphorically. This also\nmeans that there cannot be an ‘absolute’ (i.e., an\nabsolutely true) way of referring to the external world, for we do not\nsee the world as it is, but always in relation to ourselves.\nSchlegel’s theory of language is thus intrinsically connected to\nhis theory of mythology. Both in his Jena and in his Berlin lectures,\nSchlegel stressed the fact the experience of an existing totality has\na mythological basis without which the experience itself would be\nimpossible (Behler 1992: 77–78). Once again, Schlegel stressed\nthe idea that mythology is not merely a phase of human rationality,\nbut is part of our being in the world. It is a structural principle of\nhuman intellectual activity, the purest rational activity being a\nmythological one: be it in art, sciences, or in our daily activities,\nwe always relate to the world metaphorically. \nIn his letters, Schlegel claims that language is the “most\nwonderful creation of human being’s poetical talent”,\nbecause it is through language that human nature is able to reflect\nupon itself (SW: VII, 104). Thus, Schlegel’s theory of language\nis at the same time a theory of the origin of poetry, which also\nexplains his predilection for poetry among all the different artistic\nmanifestations. Thanks to this comprehension of the poetical nature of\nlanguage, Schlegel can explain poetry as the highest and freest of all\narts, because it creates its own objects. Indeed, if language is\ndefined as poetry, then poetry itself becomes “poetry in\npoetry” (Behler 1992: 125). The only difference between language\nand poetry, he argued, is that the poet is aware of his/her poetical\ncreativity: s/he consciously decides to create a dream; whereas in\nordinary speech, the subject is unaware of his/her poetical and\nimaginative activity (VLK: I, 275). In this way, Schlegel was\nanticipating some of Nietzsche’s most interesting theses in\nOn Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense and The Birth of\nTragedy \nAlthough Schlegel himself denied that he had developed a translation\ntheory (IB: I, 256), many of his texts are devoted to the analysis of\nexisting translations (such as Voss’s and Bürger’s\ntranslations of Homer) as well as to the commentary on his own work as\ntranslator. Schlegel was almost certainly influenced by the work of\nJohann Gottfried von Herder, but his decision to avoid the elaboration\nof a systematic translation theory can be interpreted as the result of\na very precise theoretical position, namely that each text requires a\ndifferent procedure for its translation. As he affirmed in the\ncommentary to his Bhagavad-Gita translation, it all depends on the\nrelation between the two languages (IB: I, 256). In other words, for\nSchlegel, a translation theory as such is uninteresting unless it\ninvolves the exposition of the actual work undertaken with the texts,\ni.e., with the original text as well as with all the existing\ntranslations. Consequently, Schlegel’s commentary and his\nsuggestions concerning Voss’s translation of Homer are\naccompanied by a very detailed analysis of the Greek text together\nwith a comparative study of Voss’s and Bürger’s\nversions. Likewise, in his Über die Bhagavad-Gita,\nSchlegel analyzes all the different ways in which a particular word\n(such as ‘yoga’ or ‘dharma’) has been\ntranslated, creating thus a history of the translation. And although\nhis commentaries appear as a work in progress, they show a very\nprecise and carefully conceived methodology which was mostly valuable\nfor other translators and translation theorists. Very much as a\ncritique and response to Voss, Schlegel’s translations need to\nbe understood as an example of the so called “paradigm\nshift” (cf. Robinson 1991 and Bernofsky 1997) that was taking\nplace within translation theories. \nFor Schlegel, a good translation is not necessarily a literal\ntranslation; the translator must be able to translate the spirit of\nthe text. He must follow the letter, but he must also be able to\n“capture some of the innumerable, indescribable marvels that do\nnot reside in the letter, but float above it like a breath of\nspirit!” (SW: VII, 39). Thus, in an 1838 letter to Herrn Reimen,\nSchlegel explains that the aim of a translator should be to\n“provide those who have no access to the original with as pure\nand uninterrupted appreciation of the work as possible” (SW:\nVII, 287). Anticipating Humboldt’s distinction between the\n‘foreign’ (das Fremde) and\n‘strangeness’ (die Fremdheit)—which he\nintroduced in the preface of his translation of the Agamemnon\nfrom 1816 –, Schlegel also emphasizes that all translations\nshould avoid converting foreign texts into strange texts (Berman\n1992a: 154). As he had said in his Works of Homer by Voss, in\norder to translate a text from a different culture, the translator\nneeds to maintain the text’s naturalness; s/he cannot convert it\ninto something strange, there is no necessity in violating the\nlanguage, in inventing a new language (SW: VII, 116). Indeed, what\nSchlegel reproached in Voss’s translation of Homer was precisely\n“to have created a much too ‘strange’ pidgin of\nGreek and German” (Berman 1992a: 154). On the other hand,\nthough, as a translator and art-critic Schlegel was also concerned\nwith enabling the assimilation and comprehension of otherness, and\ncriticized strongly the way in which - especially French translations\n- tended to paraphrase passages from foreign texts in order to make\nthem seem more French (KS: I, 75–76, cf. Berman 1992a:\n36). Moreover, Schlegel believed that German culture and language (as\nopposed to other languages) provided much better conditions for good\ntranslations, i.e., translations that were able to assimilate a\ncertain foreignization, without becoming too\n‘strange’. \nAlthough many of Schlegel’s remarks may seem self-evident and\nelementary to translators today, they did not appear so at the time.\nIn fact they are the result of a very precise way of understanding\nlanguage. Schlegel’s translation theories are very much\nconnected to his philosophy of language. It is within his explanatory\nobservations about the difficulty of translating Sanskrit terms that\nwe find a philosophical theory about the genealogy of abstract\nsignificance. All abstract concepts, he argues, are the result of a\nprogressive growing apart between an original sensual denotation and\nits future abstract meanings (IB: II, 248–258). Therefore, the\ntranslator needs to make a decision between (a) finding a more or less\nneutral term in his own language that has a similar meaning to the\noriginal, sensual meaning (in this case he needs to explain the\nparticular use of this word); and (b) using all the meanings that the\noriginal word has been attached to. The problem in the latter case is\nthat one meaning does not relate to the other, and, what is worse, the\ntranslation loses the cohesion between all the different meanings, so\nthe reader is not always able to know in which way these different\nmeanings are bound. \nSchlegel describes the task of the translator as a voluntary and\nembarrassing slavery (IB: II, 254). It is never gratifying, because\nthe more he tries to make the best translation, the more he realizes\nhow impossible his task is:  \nI have come to the conviction that translation is, though freely\nchosen, nevertheless a laborious bondage, an art without substance, a\nthankless craft; thankless not just because the best translation is\nnever esteemed as equal to an original, but also because the\ntranslator, the more he gains insight, must feel even more the\ninevitable imperfection of his work. (IB: II, 255)  \nIn effect, Heine, criticized Schlegel’s translations for\n“polishing his words ever so sweetly and fastidiously”\n(Heine [1833] 1985: 25), Voss argued that Schlegel’s Shakespeare\n“was not Shakespeare but Schlegel” (quoted in Larson 1989,\n124) and there is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which Schlegel\nromanticizes Shakespeare (Bernofsky 1997: 180f.). And yet,\nthere also seems to be a consensus regarding the fact that his\ntranslations into German of the works of Shakespeare are still and by\nfar the best. \nThe Romantic vision of the great artist as an exceptional individual,\nan unrepeatable genius, creator of his own rules, of his own style,\nleaves the figure of the philosopher and essayist in a rather\ndifficult position. The art critic has a very different task from that\nof the artist. As a critic, Schlegel conceives his activity as an\neducational and moral one, something which he definitely does not\ndemand from the artist. “Art needs the discourse of art history\nfor its artistry to become visible” (Schulte-Sasse [1985] 1988:\n137). Certainly, in order to appreciate correctly the work of the\nartist, in order to avoid being dazed by superficialities, the art\ncritic also has to have an inner feeling, a certain genius. But his\ntask is not to create, but to comprehend and to educate the public in\ntheir taste, to enable them to value the new, modern artistic\nproductions with a profound understanding of their significance. For,\n \nwhat ennobles human nature [is] to recognize and respect whatever is\nbeautiful and grand under those external modifications which are\nnecessary to their existence, and which sometimes even seem to\ndisguise them. There is no monopoly of poetry for certain ages and\nnations. (LDA: 2)  \nThroughout Schlegel’s entire work the Romantic ideals are in\nfact embedded in an enlightenment project. \nThus in the 1809 preface to the publication of his Lectures on\nDramatic Art, Schlegel argued that his main purpose was not so\nmuch to transmit an indifferent account of the history of dramatic\npoetry, but most importantly to “develop those ideas which ought\nto guide us in our estimate” (LDA: vii). His objective was to\nliberate his listeners and readers from what he calls a\n“despotism in taste” (LDA: 2), that is, to release them,\nboth from their provincial prejudices towards unknown cultures and\nfrom the new tendencies developing in German literature. He wanted to\nprepare the German public for a (future) German Romantic theatre. \nIn a similar fashion, Schlegel argued that in order to appreciate art\nproductions from past cultures and remote nations, an acquaintance not\nonly with the actual work of art is indispensable, but also with its\nhistorical and cultural background: it is imperative to understand the\npeculiarities of their culture and history as a whole. The profound\ncomprehension of History is the basis for any comprehension of art and\nlanguages, which necessarily bears a direct relationship with the\nhistorical conditions circumscribing it (KS: I, x). As a consequence,\nSchlegel introduced in all of his lectures historical, social, and\ncultural observations; because for him, the aim of the critic is,\nprimarily, to reconcile the division between theory and experience,\ni.e., between a philosophical and a historical approach. Such was the\nbalance Schlegel sought to achieve in his lectures between what would\nbe a purely theoretical comprehension of tragedy and the consideration\nof the theatre as such, with all the historical, architectural and\ncultural characteristics that conditioned the actual performance of\nthe play. \nThe critic of art and history needs to be a connoisseur in\nthe strictest sense of the word, for he must be able to explain the\nactual state of humanity from its most remote past. He needs to\ndistance himself sufficiently from his own time in order to be able to\nunderstand and judge it. The true critic must have a\n“universality of mind” so that he may leave aside his\n“personal predilections” (LDA: 5). Schlegel conceived his\nlectures as a true critique, and many years later, he still\nconsidered that this is what made his approach in his Lectures on\nDramatic Art and Literature unique (KS: I, xiii). \nIn the preface to the publication of his critical writings from 1828,\nSchlegel explains that the difficulty of his task as an art critic\nlies not so much in the critique or the judgment itself, or in the\nlaying out of the proper argument in demonstration of his views, as in\nfinding, i.e., creating the right concepts with which to\nexpress the effect and the impressions generated by a specific work of\nart (KS: I, xii). The genius of the critic is that he is able to use\nthe word ‘romantic’ in such a way that it may express the\nessence of an epoch. And, although Schlegel did not believe he\nactually had a big influence on the German public, by 1828 he did\nremark that a shift of taste had taken place in Europe, a shift that\nshowed how the Romantic ideals had in fact widely pervaded European\naudiences. \nThrough his translations and essays A.W. Schlegel intended to make\nforeign literary traditions and literary works accessible to the\nGerman public, but he also thought that the opposite was necessary.\nThat is, Schlegel understood that his task as an art critic was also\nto defend and disseminate German culture, within Germany and\nthroughout Europe. Indeed, Schlegel’s preoccupation with the\nhistorical and cultural diversities had two different, even opposite,\nconsequences. On the one hand it made Schlegel’s approach to\ndifferent cultures and their artistic production much more tolerant,\nbecause he was aware of the fact that one needs to immerse oneself in\ntheir culture in order to grasp the universal or poetical nature of\nthe particular work of art and avoid a provincial attitude. In fact,\nSchlegel liked to think of himself as a citizen of the world. But, on\nthe other hand, it led him to harbor a certain nationalistic\nsentiment, which he projected both abroad and to the German literati.\nSo, as well as restoring German culture (many of his writings can be\nregarded as a manifesto of German Romanticism and German philosophy),\nhe also encouraged his fellow countrymen, in a highly patriotic tone,\nto become deeply national and historical and to depict “what\nGermans of olden times were and what they should become again”,\nlest they should lose their “unity as Germans” (LDA: 441).\nSchlegel believed that for the true potential of Romantic literature\nto be realized in Germany, Germans needed to regain an interest in the\ngreat events of their history and in their identity as an independent\nnation (Carlson 1994: 143). \nIn his late essay Abriß von den Europäischen\nVerhältnissen der Deutschen Literatur (1825), written for an\nEnglish audience, he repeats an idea he had also defended in his\nLectures on Dramatic Art, namely that German literature was\nyoung because of the historical evolution of the German language, and\nnot because of its qualities (LDA: 421, SW: VIII, 207). Schlegel\nfervently defended German authors (such as Klopstock, Lessing,\nWinkelmann, Wieland, Goethe, or Herder) as well as German\nphilosophers, from the English accusations of being abstract and\nobscure (SW: VIII, 212). He also claimed that Germans were the most\ncosmopolitan and intellectual leaders of European culture, and that\nGermany had reached its maturity, its autonomy, and hence its freedom\n(SW: VIII, 214). This is why, for Schlegel, Germany had a central role\nin the development of European culture: in the recuperation of the\nRoman and Greek cultures, which were the very foundations of Europe.\nThe evidence of this ‘superiority’ would lie in the\ndevelopment of natural sciences, philosophy, and the critical\ninterpretation of classical texts (SW: VII, 214–217). In short,\nA.W. Schlegel’s concern became more and more a problem of\nnational identity (Schmelling 1994: 35–36). But, at the same\ntime, these assertions must be seen against the background of his\nstatements from earlier texts, such as the Wettstreit der\nSprachen (The Contest of Languages) from 1798, in which\nSchlegel develops his idea of a “cosmopolitan literature”\n(Albrecht 2005: 307) and seems to criticize and make fun of all forms\nof nationalism. As Andrea Albrecht argues, Schlegel’s engagement\nwith translations, investigation, and dissemination of European and\nnon-European literature, must be seen as a sign and proof of his\ncosmopolitanism. In the third part of his Berlin lectures\nfrom 1803, Schlegel expresses his desire that all different\nnationalities be united. But, again, this desire to transcend national\nboarders seems to go hand in hand with the necessity of establishing\nGermany as the new “center for the human spirit” (quoted\nin Albrecht 2005: 308, my translation), the rationale behind this\nbeing, that “universality, cosmopolitanism, is the real German\ncharacteristic” (VLK: III, 36). Undoubtedly, Schlegel’s\ncosmopolitanism is uncannily mixed up with a strange form of blind,\nromantic nationalism. \nAfter the disastrous consequences of German nationalism during the\n20th century, and the fact that  \nit is also a common view that “political romanticism”, in\nits regard for organic community, was a precursor to Nazism, (Black\n1964: 32)  \nsuch ‘romantic’ nationalistic statements are not received\nwithout a certain apprehension. However, without trying to solve the\nambivalent character of the Romantic political program, it is\nimportant to note how these very statements show that Schlegel was not\nan impartial critic. He too was in some way trapped in what he called\nthe Romantic spirit, despite his efforts to contemplate art, history,\nand society from a neutral perspective. In explaining the spirit\nof the Romantic, Schlegel himself is being very\nromantic. The very division he made between the ancient and\nthe modern, as well as his views of Shakespeare, Aristophanes, or the\nGreeks as a people who were  \nconscious of no wants, and aspired at no higher perfection than that\nwhich they could actually attain by the exercise of their own\nfaculties, (LDA: 9)  \nwere inevitably influenced by his own time. \nA.W. Schlegel’s writings show a great preoccupation and interest\nin the perspective of the ‘other’: women, children, and,\nabove all, other cultures. He constantly reminds the reader about the\nnecessity, in critical thought, of creating a link between theory and\npractical experience or historical knowledge. This enables him to\ndefend the idea that two totally different works of art can be great\nand admirable, not only in spite of their differences, but because\nof them. It was indeed this affirmation of difference that\nenabled him to use the notion ‘Romantic’ in the way that\nhe did. In fact, although Schlegel’s Lectures on Dramatic\nArt can be seen as a plea for modern or Romantic poetry and\nculture in general (“the feeling of the moderns is, upon the\nwhole, more intense, their fancy more incorporeal, and their thoughts\nmore contemplative”, LDA: 9), in contrast to other authors, he\nis always very careful not to judge modern works of art according to\ntheir similarities or dissimilarities with ancient ones. It was not by\nchance that Schlegel should be the first to introduce the idea of a\ncomparative literature. \nThe emphasis on the opposition between ancient and modern art, and its\nparallel to the antagonism between Christianity and Greek pagan\nmythology, are recurring assumptions in 19th century\naesthetics. But Schlegel’s aim is not to conceptualize a\nparticular canon of beauty, but much more, as a means of elevating\noneself above all partial views, to find an approach that may enable\nthe comprehension and enjoyment of the different ways in which art is\nmanifested throughout history. Thus, Schlegel is taking to its highest\npoint the 19th century idealist principle according to\nwhich art is the “power of creating what is beautiful and\nrepresenting (darstellen) it to the human eye and ear”\n(LDA: 3) as well as the idea that “poetry, as the fervid\nexpression of our whole being, must assume a new and peculiar form in\ndifferent ages” (LDA: 29). \nThe experience of difference also becomes an important element in his\ncritique of art. Schlegel clearly positions himself against modern\ncritics, who consider the mixture of reality and imitation\n“destructive of theatrical illusion” (LDA: 34). Although\nnot always explicit in his writings, Schlegel constantly stresses the\nidea that in the contemplation of a work of art, the spectator must\nstill perceive the craftedness of the whole; i.e., the difference\nbetween reality and illusion. This is a fundamental element of his\ncriticism of naturalism and his defense of the use of verse and masks\nin theatre. What is more interesting, though, is that the constant\nawareness of the difference between reality and illusion (for instance\nthrough irony) also shows the fundamental fragility of difference\nitself in a much more compelling way than a rigorous classicist work\nof art does. Reality is also an illusion; it also is the result of\ncreative forces, such as language is.  \nIn this specific sense, Schlegel could be understood as a thinker of\ndifference in a much more radical way than other philosophers of his\ntime. Although Schlegel’s writings have not been considered as\nphilosophical as those of other 19th century German\nphilosophers, his approach to art and its history, and his reflections\non language and cultural differences are much closer to what is\nsometimes called a postmodern comprehension of aesthetics\nthan that of his contemporaries. Indeed, in his characteristically\nunpresumptuous style, Schlegel anticipates philosophers such as\nNietzsche, Blumenberg, or Deleuze.","contact.mail":"katia_hay@yahoo.fr","contact.domain":"yahoo.fr"}]
