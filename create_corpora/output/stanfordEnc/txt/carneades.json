He is credited by ancient tradition with\nfounding the New or Third Academy and defended a form of probabilism\nin epistemology. \n\nBorn in Cyrene, then a Greek-speaking city on the Mediteranean coast\nof North Africa, Carneades pursued his philosophical studies in\nAthens, which was then as it had been and was to be for some time the\nphilosophical center of the ancient world. There he studied not only\nat the Academy, the school founded by Plato of which he was to become\nthe leader or scholarch, but also with with Diogenes of Babylon, the\nfifth scholarch of the Stoic school and a pupil of Chrysippus (c.\n208–206 BCE). Chrysippus was the principal architect of the\nStoic system and the most important philosophical stimulus to\nCarneades, who is reported to have said, ‘If Chrysippus had not\nbeen, I would not have been’ (D.L. 4.62) (which echoes the\nsaying, ‘If Chrysippus had not been, there would have been no\nStoa’). Carneades became scholarch of the Academy sometime\nbefore 155 BCE, when, together with Diogenes and Critolaus, the head\nof Aristotle’s school, the Peripatos, he was sent to Rome to\nrepresent Athens in a petition before the senate (see Powell,\n2013). \nAccording to tradition, Carneades also delivered a pair of lectures\nwhile in Rome, speaking in defense of justice on one day and, in\nrebuttal of his own arguments of the previous day, against it on the\nfollowing day. This celebrated episode is recounted or alluded to in a\nnumber of ancient sources, all of them much later, and doubts about\nevery part of the story including the reality of the lectures\nthemselves have been raised (see Drecoll, 2004; Powell, 2013). The\nspeech of Philus in the only partially extant third book of\nCicero’s De Republica may preserve traces of\nCarneades’ speech against justice, though it is a matter of\ncontroversy if and to what extent it does, or failing that it may draw\non arguments that Carneades made on other occasions (see Ferrary,\n1977; Glucker, 2001). \nLike Arcesilaus (316/15–241/40 BCE), the head of the Academy who\nwas responsible for the school’s so-called ‘skeptical\nturn’, and Socrates before him, Carneades wrote nothing, but\nmade his mark through face to face teaching and argument (D.L. 4.65).\nThe influence he exerted in this way was immense. From the time of his\nscholarchate until the dissolution of the Academy under its probably\nlast leader, Philo of Larissa (159/8–84/3 BCE), philosophical\nactivity in the Academy and among the philosophers in its orbit\nconsisted in good part in the further development of ideas and lines\nof argument pioneered or substantially reshaped by Carneades. Indeed\nthese philosophers often put forward their own views in the guise of\ninterpretations of Carneades. We are ultimately indebted for what we\nknow about him to works by those with firsthand experience of him,\nespecially Clitomachus, his student and eventual successor as\nscholarch. Although none of the latter’s many books has\nsurvived, they were used by authors like Cicero (106-43 BCE) and\nSextus Empiricus (probably 2nd or 3rd century CE), whose works have\ncome down to us. (Greek and Latin testimonies are collected in Mette,\n1985; many important passages with an English translation and notes\ncan be found in Long and Sedley, 1987.) \nHistories of philosophy typically speak, as I did above, of a\n‘skeptical turn’ in the Academy or of the ‘skeptical\nAcademy’. Ancient authors called the school of Arcesilaus and\nhis successors the ‘New Academy’ to distinguish it from\nthe ‘Old Academy’ of his predecessors. Some cautions and\nqualifications are in order, however. The term ‘skeptic’\nwas not used by the Academics, but was the most prominent of several\ndescriptions bestowed on themselves by the members of the Pyrrhonian\nschool. It was applied only later to the Academics on the basis of a\nlong-recognized affinity between the two schools. In the original\nmeaning of the term, a skeptic is an inquirer or investigator, but it\ncame to be associated in particular with theses calling into question\nthe possibility of knowledge and recommending suspension of judgment\ntogether with the arguments put forward in support of them. The sense\nof ‘skeptic’ and ‘skeptical’ most familiar to\nus has its origin in this use of the term. There is a corresponding\ntension in accounts of the Academy, and in the philosophical activity\nthey seek to describe.  \nThis activity took the form of argument on both sides of the question\n(in utramque partem). The speeches for and against justice\nthat Carneades delivered during the philosophers’ embassy to\nRome was an instance. Most often, however, Academics in this period\nleft the defense of a theory to its proponents and argued against it,\ncreating an opposition in this way. The Academy’s method of\nargument was, in the first instance, dialectical, like that of\nSocrates in Plato’s Socratic dialogues. An argument is\ndialectical in the relevant sense when one party, the questioner, puts\nquestions to another, questions that when affirmed by the answerer\nbecome premises in an argument to a conclusion that contradicts a\nthesis of the answerer’s. This conclusion, deduced as it is from\npremises chosen by the questioner because the answerer is committed to\nthem or will otherwise find them hard to resist, is not one to which\nthe questioner need be committed in propria persona. In\ndrawing them out, he remains detached, uncovering difficulties\ninternal to his interlocutor’s position without committing\nhimself to a position of his own. The side usually taken by the\nAcademics in epistemological debates was that of the skeptic, in the\nsense of one who challenges the possibility of knowledge. \nThere are numerous testimonies to the effect that the Academics\nregarded argument on both sides of the question as a method of\ninquiry, and argued as they did the better to discover the truth,\ni.e., to further skeptical ends in the original acceptance of the term\n(cf. Cicero, Acad. 2.7. 60, 76; N.D.1.11; Plutarch,\nStoic. Repugnan. 1037C). But opposing arguments to each other\ncan be also be used to lend support to skepticism in the sense of a\nskeptical position by calling the possibility of knowledge\ninto question and commending the suspension of judgment. And sometimes\nthe Academics are said to have created such oppositions with this end\nin view, i.e., it seems, to support a skeptical position to which they\nwere committed (Cicero Acad. 1.46). And a set of arguments\ndirectly to the–in our sense–skeptical conclusions that\nnothing can be known and that one should suspend judgment occupied a\nplace of central importance in the Academy’s practice of\nargument. The Academics seemed to their opponents to be attached to\nthe skeptical conclusions of these arguments. And this seems to have\nbeen true of at least some Academics. Nonetheless these arguments seem\nat least at first and in the hands of some New Academics to have been\nput forward in a dialectical spirit. \nThe principal target of the arguments was the epistemology of the\nStoics, and it was out of their engagement on that front that the form\nof the skeptical position defended by the Academics first emerged. The\nStoics maintained that it is possible for human beings to achieve a\ncondition of wisdom entirely free of opinion, i.e., false or insecure\nbelief. According to them, all of a wise human being’s judgments\nare instances of knowledge, based on an unshakable grasp of the truth.\nKnowledge of this kind was possible according to them because there\nexist so-called cognitive impressions (katalêptikai\nphantasiai), which function as the criterion of truth (cf. Frede,\n1999; Sedley, 2002). A cognitive impression they define as an\nimpression from what is, stamped and impressed in exact accordance\nwith what is, and such as could not be from what is not. This seems to\nmean, in the paradigm case of a perceptual impression, that it is an\nimpression that arises in conditions which: \nAccording to the Stoics, by restricting one’s assent in the\nperceptual sphere to impressions of this kind, one can avoid ever\nassenting to a false perceptual impression, a key necessary condition\nif one is to attain knowledge. As the criterion of truth, cognitive\nimpressions are the ultimate basis of all knowledge, by confining\none’s assent to which, and meeting certain further conditions,\nthe Stoics maintained, one can avoid error and opinion entirely. \nThe Academics appealed to the skeptic’s stock in trade, dreams,\nmadness, optical illusions and divinely inspired visions, in order to\nargue that the special character allegedly proper to cognitive\nimpressions was not in fact peculiar to impressions produced in the\nrequired truth-guaranteeing way, but could also be found in false\nimpressions (Cicero, Acad. 2.49–54, 79–82,\n88–90; Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos\n[henceforwad S.E. M] 7.402–8 = Long and Sedley\n[henceforward L&S] 40H). If so, impressions that arise in the\nspecified conditions, though true, will be indistinguishable from\nfalse impressions—so far as any intrinsic, discriminable\ncharacter is concerned. Therefore they will not be cognitive, and not\nbeing cognitive, they will not be able to serve as a criterion. That\nthere are no cognitive impressions is the first of the two\npropositions most closely associated with ancient skepticism. And\nsince it then follows, on Stoic assumptions, that nothing can be\nknown, this was often taken to be equivalent to the claim that nothing\ncan be known. The second skeptical proposition, that one ought to\nsuspend judgment, the Academics deduced from the first together with\nthe Stoic doctrine that the wise do not hold (mere) opinions (S.E.\nM 7.155–7 = L&S 41C). On Stoic assumptions, assent\nto an impression that is not cognitive (either in the strict sense or\nin a broader sense which covers impressions that, though not\nperceptual, nonetheless afford an equally secure grasp of their\ncontents), is sufficient to make the resulting judgment an opinion.\nTherefore, in the absence of cognitive impressions, one can avoid\nopinion only by suspending judgment entirely. \nOn a strictly dialectical interpretation, the skeptical propositions\nfor which the Academics argued need not tell us anything about what\nphilosophical views, if any, they accepted themselves. The skeptical\nposition that comprises these two claims—that knowledge is not\npossible and that one ought to suspend judgement about\neverything—is an unwelcome consequence of Stoic views and\npresents the Stoics with a problem that it is their responsibility to\nsolve, not the Academy’s. \nTo be sure, Arcesilaus and other Academics, Carneades above all,\ndefended the possibility of a life without knowledge and without\nassent (Plutarch, Adversus Colotem 1122A–F = L&S]\n69A). But that need not show that they somehow held a skeptical\nposition. Instead their aim may have been to counter the Stoic charge\nthat the Academic arguments for the skeptical propositions must be\nfaulty because they render rational action impossible. And\nArcesilaus’ account of how one can act in the absence of\nknowledge and without assent is so heavily dependent on Stoic\ndoctrines that it looks very much like an effort to show the Stoics\nthat their system already contained the resources necessary to explain\nhow action was possible for the skeptic as envisaged in the\nAcademy’s arguments. \nNevertheless, there is evidence that at some stage in the\nschool’s history, even if they did not use the term\n‘skeptic’, some Academics were skeptics in the sense that\nthey adopted one or both of the two skeptical propositions as the\ncorrect philosophical position in propria persona. Whether\nCarneades endorsed a positions of his own and, if so, which ones is\nunclear and was already a matter of dispute in the Academy. He is\nknown to have championed different positions on the same question in\ndifferent contexts. It is plain nonetheless that he prepared the way\nfor his successors to take this step (see below). \nLater ancient writers sometimes speak of Carneades founding the third\nor New Academy (giving ‘New Academy’ which elsewhere\ncovers the whole of the Academy from Arcesilaus’ time a narrower\nmeaning) which followed the second or Middle Academy of Arcesilaus and\nthe first or Old Academy of Plato and his earliest successors. (The\ndistinction between Academies was meant to signal changes in\nphilosophical doctrine or approach, not changes in the school as an\ninstitution.) The New Academy in this narrower sense seemed, to both\nancient philosophers and modern historians, to differ from the Middle\nchiefly in two respects. Carneades appeared to favor a mitigated form\nof skepticism, which admitted the possibility of well-founded opinions\nif not of certain knowledge. And he tackled issues in, and sometimes\ndefended positions about, logic, ethics, natural philosophy and\ntheology as well as epistemology, which had been the focus of\nArcesilaus’ attention.  \nIt is likely that Carneades refined and added to the stock of\nskeptical arguments employed in the Academy. They come in two groups.\nThe first focus on the allegedly peculiar character, a kind of\nclarity, and strikingness, that belongs only to impressions that arise\nin the way specified by the definition of the cognitive impression,\nwhile the second tackle the requirement that cognitive impressions be\ndistinct (Acad. 2.54–8, 84–6; S.E. M\n7.408–11 = L&S 40H). Arguments of the second type are based\non the idea, denied by the Stoa, that two object might be exactly\nalike. If this were true, then even if impressions that captured their\nobjects with complete accuracy by arising in the specified ideal\nconditions did possess a clarity that it was possible to acquire in no\nother way, it would not be possible to avoid errors of identification\nby confining one’s assent to impressions with the required\nclarity. One could, for instance, mistake someone for his identical\ntwin. The only sure way to avoid error would then be to suspend\njudgment. \nThe contribution for which Carneades is best known, however, came in\nreply to the Stoics’ counter-argument in defense of the\ncognitive impression. In response to their contention that, without\ncognitive impressions, human beings would lack any basis for action or\ninquiry Carneades argued that such a basis could be found in so-called\nprobable impressions (from probabilis, that which lends\nitself to or invites approval, Cicero’s Latin for Greek\n“pithanos,” persuasive) (see Allen, 1994; Obdrzalek, 2006;\nReinhardt, 2018). The theory of probable impressions went far beyond\nanything Arcesilaus had said and had an independent appeal which\nArcesilaus’ response to the same challenge lacked.\nCarneades’ defense of this theory is a main reason why he was\nthought to have departed from or moderated the stricter skepticism\nthought to have been espoused by Arcesilaus and the Middle Academy\n(S.E. Pyrrhoneae hypotyposes [henceforward PH]\n1.227–30; M 7.166–89 = L&S 69DE). It seemed\nto be complemented by the line he sometimes defended on opinion, and\nthat some of his successors took for his considered opinion, according\nto which assent to non-cognitive impressions and the opinions to which\nit gives rise are compatible with wisdom (Acad. 2.59, 67,\n78). But the interpretation of Carneades championed by Clitomachus,\naccording to which the wise will refrain from assent and so avoid\nopinion, also relied on probability as the basis for an alternative\nform of approval (Acad. 2.99-100, 104-3). \nCarneades’ defense of probabilism can also be viewed, at least\nin the first instance, as a natural extension of the Academy’s\ntradition of dialectical argument, however. The epistemological debate\nbetween the Stoa and the Academy extended over many years and was\nconducted with a great deal of energy and ingenuity on both sides. It\ntended toward impasse. If the burden of argument fell entirely upon\nthe Academy and the its members were restricted to premises that were\nstrictly implied by Stoic theory, the Academic case was not proven.\nThe Stoics were not required on pain of self-contradiction to accept\nall the premises the Academics needed. Nonetheless, by rejecting these\npremises, the Stoics often committed themselves to highly disputable\ncontentions. This mattered to them, because their aim was not simply\nto vindicate the internal consistency of their system. They claimed\nthat their views were true and uniquely consistent with common\nconceptions held by all human beings. \nIn effect, the Stoics claimed that no position apart from theirs could\ndo justice to a set of considerations that were not peculiar to their\nschool but were accepted by everyone. It should, then, be possible for\nthem to convince open-minded and intelligent auditors of the truth of\nStoicism. The challenge that Carneades accepted was to show that there\nwere alternatives which could do justice to the agreed upon\nconsiderations as well as or better than did the Stoic position, while\ndispensing with its most distinctive and contentious features. Though\nit does not restrict itself to premises that are already Stoic\ndoctrines, this form of argument is broadly dialectical. By aiming to\ndo justice to the considerations which the Stoics agree are relevant\nto the area in question, and directing his arguments to intelligent\nand open-minded auditors whom they are committed to taking seriously,\nCarneades, perhaps among other things, was trying to show the Stoics\nthat their position did not satisfy the standards they set for\nthemselves. Because the theories he put forward and defended to this\nend are not based solely on Stoic doctrines, they sometimes have a\nwider appeal, and it is easier to attribute them to their author.\nNonetheless, though they are Carneades’ in the sense of being\nhis creations, they need not have expressed his convictions. \nIn keeping with this style of argument, Carneades prepared the way for\nhis theory of probability by setting out an epistemological framework\nwhich, though obviously indebted to Stoic views, was intended to\ncapture intuitions that were more widely shared. In this broadly\nfoundationalist framework it is natural to look for a criterion of\ntruth where the Stoics and other Hellenistic philosophers do, viz.\namong self-evident impressions of sense (S.E. M\n7.159–65 = L&S 70A). Yet the Academy’s arguments\nagainst cognitive impressions seem to have shown that no such\nimpressions are to be found. With the aid of his account of\nprobability, Carneades undertook to show that, after all, they are not\nneeded. Rational action and inquiry are possible without the\nfoundation that cognitive impressions promised to provide because\nprobable impressions can serve in their place. And if this is right,\nor if it is sufficiently plausible, the Stoics’ attempt to\nprovide indirect support for their contentions about the cognitive\nimpression by showing that there are no satisfactory alternatives will\nfail. \nThe account of probability explains how one can discriminate among\nimpressions by investigating whether an initially persuasive\nimpression agrees with one’s other impressions or if there is\nsomething about the conditions in which it arose that undermines\nconfidence in it. The more such checks it survives, the more\nconfidence one will have in it. Depending on the amount of time\navailable and the importance of the matter in question, it is possible\nto perform more or fewer of them. Although no amount of checking is\nsufficient to eliminate any chance of error, it is possible to achieve\nthe degrees of confidence required in different circumstances to make\nrational action and theoretical inquiry possible (Acad. 2.32,\n110). Carneades’ theory is thus an early instance of\nfallibilism. And he seems to have used it not only to counter the\nStoics’ argument that there are no alternatives to their theory,\nbut also to suggest that that theory’s reliance on self-evident\nperceptual impressions is misplaced, even when viewed as an\nepistemological ideal. According to Carneades’ theory, the\nimprovement of which our faculties are capable is not a matter of\napproaching the condition of perfect discrimination of self-evident\nimpressions ever more closely; it consists instead in refining\none’s appreciation for the complicated relations between\nimpressions in virtue of which they add to or detract from each\nother’s value as evidence, which in some cases may lead us to\nreject apparently self-evident, true impressions. \nDrawing on his account of probable impressions, Carneades defended two\nviews about assent. He sometimes argued that the wise person will\nalways withhold assent, but will be able to act and inquire by\nfollowing or using probable impressions in a way that does not amount\nto assent, and so does not involve holding opinions about anything\n(Acad. 2.59, 99, 108). On other occasions, he maintained that\nthe wise person will assent to what is probable and so form opinions,\nbut with the proviso that he may be wrong (Acad. 2.59, 67,\n78, 112). In this way he gave his interlocutors a choice between two\nalternatives to Stoic orthodoxy, each of which describes a way of life\nwithout the certainty furnished by cognitive impressions. Either one\nlives entirely without opinions, while following probable impressions\nwithout assenting to them or one lives with opinions, but opinions\nthat are held in a self-consciously tentative spirit and subject to\nrevision in the light of new evidence. \nThe view according to which the wise person assents and forms opinions\nappealed to those convinced by the Academy’s arguments that,\nthough certainty is unobtainable, well founded probabilities are\nwithin our grasp, among which is this view itself. Someone who thinks\nthis is likely to see little point in keeping a special kind of\napproval, assent, in reserve for a kind of certainty which he thinks\nis neither needed nor possible, though he cannot be certain of this\nany more than he can be certain of anything else. This view was, it\nseems, favored by Philo of Larissa among others (cf. Brittain, 2001),\nand it gave rise to a form of probabilism, as a positively endorsed\ntheory of knowledge, which is one of the New Academy’s legacies.\nThe other view, which favors withholding assent while still relying on\nprobability, appealed to those who were attracted, as Zeno and\nArcesilaus had been, to the ideal of certain knowledge, for which it\npreserves assent while permitting a weaker form of approval. This is\nthe classical skeptical stance that was the New Academy’s other\nlegacy, which was defended by Clitomachus, and it also influenced the\nother main ancient school of skepticism, the Pyrrhonists. It is\nnoteworthy that the more radical forms of skepticism defended by\nClitomachus and the Pyrhonists were less firmly attached to the\nskeptical proposition that nothing can be known than moderate\nskeptics, who assented vehemently to it (Acad. 2. 148). \nTackling ethics, Carneades proceeded as he had in epistemology and\nconstructed a framework intended to capture and do justice to the\nmotives behind ethical theory. His framework classified not only all\nthe views about the goal or end of life that had been held, but also\nall those that could be held (Cicero, Fin. 5.16–21 =\nL&S 64EG; cf. Algra, 1997). He sets out from the assumption that\npractical wisdom, the knowledge we need to conduct our lives\nsuccessfully, must have an object. That is, it must be knowledge of\nsomething other than itself. This immediately rules out of contention\nviews that identify human good with knowledge without having anything\nto say about what it might be knowledge of apart from human good (the\nthreat of circularity had already been noted by Plato,\nRepublic 505bc). He further supposes that this object must be\none towards which human beings have a natural impulse. There were, he\nmaintained, three possible such objects: pleasure, freedom from pain,\nand the natural advantages such as health and strength. The principle\nof virtue corresponds to this initial choice: to be virtuous is to act\nwith a view to obtaining one of them. There are six simple views about\nthe goal of life, three of which identify the goal with virtue, that\nis, acting with a view to obtaining either pleasure, freedom from\npain, or the natural advantages; and three of which identify it with\nactually obtaining one of these objects. Three combined views take the\ngoal to be a combination of virtue and actually obtaining the\ncorresponding object. There are thus nine views altogether. The Stoic\nposition, that virtue is the only good, is the third view mentioned,\nnamely that the goal is acting with a view to obtaining the natural\nadvantages whether or not one obtains them. \nOn different occasions, we are informed, Carneades defended the simple\nview that the goal is actually to obtain the natural advantages or the\ncombined view that it is virtue together with pleasure (Fin.\n2.35; 5.20; Acad. 2.132, 139). His aim seems to have been to\nchallenge the Stoics by showing that the considerations captured by\nthe framework do not all point to the Stoic view. By defending the\nview that the goal is the actual enjoyment of the natural advantages,\nCarneades probably intended to suggest that the considerations which\nsupport taking the natural advantages as the object of our first\nnatural impulse, as the Stoics did, also count in favor of taking them\nto be goods and therefore components of the end. The point of arguing\nin support of the view that the goal is a combination of virtue and\npleasure, on the other hand, was probably to show that taking pleasure\nas the ultimate object of impulse would require a recognizably\nvirtuous life, a view for which there were Socratic antecedents in\nPlato’s Protagoras. Neither of these positions had the\nkind of independent appeal that Carneades’ probabilism and his\nviews about assent did—our sources always describe them as put\nforward for the sake of argument—but Carneades’ division\nof ethical views was extremely influential, and through Cicero it\nshaped the modern understanding of Hellenistic ethical theory (cf.\nStriker, 1991 sect. 5; Allen, 2014). \nCarneades also raised problems for the Stoic attempts to define of the\nend of life in terms drawn from the arts or technai (cf.\nStriker, 1991 sect. 3). \nWe are well informed about Carneades’ contributions to two other\nimportant philosophical debates. The first concerns the cluster of\nissues surrounding fate, voluntary action and freedom; the second\nregards the nature and number of the gods. \nOur principal source for the Hellenistic phase of the the first debate\nand Carneades’ contributions to it is Cicero’s De\nfato, which has survived only in an incomplete form. (A Latin\ntext with an English translation and helpful notes is found in\nSharples, 1991; older but still useful is Bayer, 1963 with a German\ntranslation and notes. On the debate as a whole, see Bobzien, 1998).\nIt is clear from the De fato that Carneades took on both the\nStoics and the Epicureans. Cicero’s presentation suggests that\nhe may have defended a consistent position distinct from theirs. If he\ndid, here as elsewhere we do not need to decide whether he endorsed it\nin propria persona or put it forward as an alternative to\nchallenge to the positions on offer. It was at least the latter,\nserving to show the Epicureans and the Stoics that there was another,\narguably better, way to tackle the issues, one that avoided the most\ntroubling and implausible choices to which they had been led in the\nconstruction of their own theories. \nThe Stoics held that all things come about by fate. Fate they define\nas ‘the ordered series of causes, when cause joined to cause\nbrings about each thing, ceaselessly flowing for eternity’\n(Cicero De divinatione I 125; Gellius Noctes Atticae\n7.2.1-3 = L&S 55 K). To maintain that all things are fated in this\ncontext is to hold that every event is the effect of antecedent causes\nsufficient to bring it about. In other words, the Stoics were\ndeterminists. And they accepted some of the familiar implications of\ndeterminism, e.g, that a sufficiently powerful intellect with a\ncomplete grasp of the state of the world would be able to predict\nevery future event (De divinatione I 127 = LS 55 O). They\nalso confronted the familiar problems that determinism seems to\npresent. If human beings are parts of a deterministic universe and\ntheir every action is the pre-determined effect of causes antecedent\nto their existence, there is a plausible argument that all our actions\nare involuntary, that as it was often put in the ancient debate,\nnothing is up to us or in our power. In no case could we have done\nother than what we did. And from this it would seem to follow that we\nare not responsible for our actions and, with this, that there is no\nscope for blame or punishment, which presuppose that we can be held\nmorally responsible for at least some of what we do. They solved this\nproblem to their own satisfaction by defending the first properly\narticulated\n compatibilist theory,\n according to which voluntary action is compatible with\ndeterminism. \nEpicurus and his followers, by contrast, accepted that if all things\nare fated, then all our actions are involuntary, from which it follows\nthat we are responsible for none of them. They preserved the voluntary\nand moral responsibility by rejecting fate, notoriously postulating\nthe swerve, occasional random uncaused atomic motions (De\nfato 21-2; cf. Lucretius DRN 2.251-93 = LS 20 F). \nLike the Stoics, the Epicureans were also occupied with we may call\nlogical determinism. According to the principle of bivalence, every\nproposition P is either true or false. If there is a future tense\nproposition predicting every future occurrence before it\nhappens–it doesn’t matter whether it has ever been\nexpressed–true at all times before the event, it would seem that\nthe future is fixed or settled. Aristotle tackled this problem in\nDe Interpretatione 9, though it is unclear whether the\nparties to the Hellenistic debate were familiar with his contribution.\nThough an argument for the pre-determination of the future from\nbivalence alone is possible (there may be hints at De fato\n21, 29), in Cicero’s presentation of the issues, the role of the\nprinciple of bivalence is to lend support to causal determinism. The\nidea seems to be that the truth of a proposition at a given time\ndepends on the state of the world at that time and that the facts\nabout the world that bear on the truth of a future tense prediction\nmust be about causes then operative sufficient to bring about the\npredicted event. \nCarneades’ most noteworthy contribution to the debate was to\nreject the connection, accepted by both schools, between the principle\nof bivalence and causal determinism. These, he argued, were separate\nissues. To affirm that a suitably formulated statement about the\nfuture that is true cannot become false implies nothing about fate,\nbut is merely an explanation of the meaning of the words employed\n(De fato 20; cf. 27-8). The Stoics were not obliged to\nembrace determinism by accepting bivalence and were not entitled to\ncite bivalence as a ground for their commitment to determinism; the\nEpicureans were not under an obligation to repudiate bivalence because\nthey rejected fate (De fato 20; cf. 32-3). \nEven though his proposal would have freed the Epicureans to defend the\nswerve without the need to reject a fundamental principle of logic,\nCarneades was strongly critical of the swerve. The position that he\nput forward as an alternative was supposed to show how the Epicureans\ncould uphold their cause without the swerve (De fato 23; cf.\n47-8). It raises interpretive problems that reflect both the intrinsic\ndifficulty of the issues and the imperfect state of our sources. The\ncause of the Epicureans to which Carneades promises to lend support is\nthe rejection of fate, i.e., the view that every event is the effect\nof antecedent causes sufficient to bring it about. But the error from\nwhich he would save them is the postulation of uncaused motion, which\nis entailed by the swerve. According to Carneades, there is a way in\nwhich it can be truly said that there is motion without cause and a\nway in which it is false (De fato 24). \nHe offers an analogy designed to appeal to the Epicureans. In\nEpicurean physics atoms move downwards in straight lines unless\ndisturbed by collisions with other atoms (collisions that are set in\ntrain by atomic swerves). The downward motion of the atoms is without\na cause if we mean action exerted on them from outside, but their\nmotion is not unqualifiedly uncaused, for it is their nature to move\nas they do (De fato 25). The voluntary motions of our\nmind–our volitions–are like this, not the effect of\nexternal causes (though there will be external occasions, or as we\nmight say precipitating causes, for them). \nHis thought seems to be that the mind possesses a certain autonomy.\nExplanations of an agent’s actions are always available after\nthe fact. ‘The outcome reveals its causes’ (De\nfato 37). Explanations for voluntary action do not terminate, as\nthey arguably would if the Epicureans were right about the swerve, in\nuncaused motions, and we are not, as it might then seem, playthings of\nchance. Rather it is the nature of the mind, and the characteristics\nof the minds of the agents who act, which are the causes of their\nvoluntary actions. But it is not because our actions are\npredetermined, not because they are fated, that we act as we do. \nHow effective Carneades’ version of autonomous mental causation\nwas at disarming the determinist intuitions of his\nopponents–then and now–is another matter, of course. \nTwo accounts of Carneades’ sorites arguments against\nthe existence of the gods have come down to us, one in Sextus\nEmpiricus (M 9.182–90), one in Cicero’s dialogue,\nthe De natura deorum (3.43–50). \nSorites arguments are fashioned by assembling as premises a sequence\nof conditionals the antecedent of each of which after the first is the\nconsequent of the preceding member of the series. According to each\npremise, if a property belongs to an item or items specified in the\nantecedent, then it belongs to the item or items specified in the\nconsequent. The argument using the property heap (Greek\nsôros), from which the genus takes its name, is a good\nexample. If one grain of sand is not a heap, then the result of adding\none more grain is not a heap; if two grains are not a heap, then the\nresult of adding one more is not a heap. But it is plain that if one\nrepeats the operation by which these premises are generated often\nenough, the result will be a sequence of conditionals the consequent\nof whose last member (n grains of sand are not a heap) is clearly\nfalse. Anyone who agrees that it is false, but who has accepted each\nof the conditionals in the sequence, is obliged to reject the\nantecedent of the first, that one grain of sand is not a heap, which\nseems just as plainly true as the consequent of the last premise is\nplainly false. Those who would avoid this face the difficult task of\ndrawing a line somewhere in the sequence by rejecting one of the\npremises and explaining why this conditional and not one preceding it\nis to be rejected. \nCarneades’ theological sorites arguments set out from apparently\nunobjectionable ideas about divinity and little by little, on the\nbasis resemblances and implied grounds for bestowing divine status on\nthe generally acknowledged gods, enlarge the extension of the divine\nuntil a conclusion that will be received as absurd is reached (cf.\nBurnyeat, 1982). The first argument in Sextus’ account, for\nexample, proceeds as follows (M 9.182): If Zeus is a god,\nthen Poseidon is a god, but if Poseidon is a god, then Achelous (a\nriver) is a god; Achelous is a god, then so too is the Nile; if the\nNile, then every river, then every stream. This, it is implied, is\nabsurd. Therefore Zeus is not a god, and we are invited to draw the\nconclusion that there are no gods because if any being were a god,\nZeus would be a god and it has apparently just been shown that he is\nnot. \nIn Cicero’s account, Carneades’ purpose in so arguing is\nsaid to have been ‘not to abolish the gods–what could\nbecome a philosopher less–but to convict the Stoics of having\nexplained nothing clearly about the gods’ (N.D 44).\nScholars who follow the lead of this remark take Carneades’\nintentions to have been narrowly dialectical–to draw unwelcome\nconsequences from the commitments of his specifically Stoic opponents,\nconsequences that for all the argument tells us follow only Stoic\nassumptions (see Couissin, 1941). But though the Stoics may be\nvulnerable to Carneades’ sorites arguments, the understanding of\nthe divine on which the arguments depend is hardly peculiar to them.\nIn Cicero the arguments are presented by the character Cotta, a priest\nin the Roman religion, who speaks the words describing\nCarneades’ intentions just cited. Cicero’s decision to\nmake Cotta the spokesperson for Academic skepticism in his dialogue\ntells us something important about it, that it was possible to combine\nAcademic skepticism with religious conviction. But the attitude, which\nresembles fideism, that Cotta attributes to Carneades may not have\nbeen Carneades’. There is no special reference to the Stoics in\nSextus’ presentation. Carneades’ arguments, like those in\nthe broader context, may have been intended to raise doubts about the\nexistence of the gods that did not depend on Stoic philosophy and had\nimplications that were not for the Stoics alone. Carneades would have\nbeen arguing not as a committed atheist of course, for he would have\nbeen sensible of the force of the argument in support of the\ngods’ existence, but perhaps as a pioneering agnostic (see\nSedley, 2020). \nCarneades also had a hand in the arguments raising problems in logic\ndescribed in Cicero’s Academica (Acad.\n2.91–8; cf. Barnes, 1997) and in the case against divination\npresented in his De divinatione.","contact.mail":"jv.allen@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
