Heytesbury developed the works of\nThomas Bradwardine and Richard Kilvington, and he was also influenced\nby Walter Burley, William Ockham, and Roger Swyneshed (or Swineshead). He authored a\npopular textbook Regulae solvendi sophismata and several\nother collections of sophisms. He linked interests in logic,\nmathematics, and physics. He formulated the Mean Speed Theorem\noffering a proper rule for uniformly accelerated motion, later\ndeveloped by Galileo. His works anticipated nineteenth-century\nmathematical analyses of the continuum. He influenced logic in Britain\nand Italy (where several late fourteenth and early fifteenth-century\neditions of his texts were printed) and his influence lasted until the\nsixteenth century when the debates he participated in declined.\n\nWilliam Heytesbury was most likely born before 1313 in Wiltshire\n(Salisbury Diocese). He is first mentioned as a fellow at Merton\nCollege in Oxford in 1330; he is thus among the second generation of\nOxford Calculators (a follower of Thomas Bradwardine and Richard\nKilvington, a contemporary of John Dumbleton and Roger Swyneshed, and\na predecessor of Richard Swineshead). He held the administrative\nposition of a bursar of Merton in 1338–1339, responsible for\ndetermining dues, auditing accounts, and collecting\n revenues.[1]\n He was named a fellow of the new Queen’s College in 1340, but\nwas soon mentioned among the fellows of Merton College again. He is\nrecorded to have become a Doctor of Theology in 1348, yet none of his\ntheological works are known. He was chancellor of the University in\n1371–72 (and perhaps also in 1353–54) and died shortly\nthereafter, between December 1372 and January\n 1373.[2] \nHeytesbury’s extant writings, which are tentatively dated to the\nperiod 1331–1339 by Weisheipl, are (with one exception)\nconcerned with the analysis of fallacies and sophisms. Regulae\nsolvendi sophismata [RSS] or Logica (a\ncollection of six treatises: on paradoxes, on knowing and doubting, on\nrelative terms, on beginning and ceasing, on maxima and minima, and on\nthe velocity of movements) is concerned with instructions for solving\ndifferent types of sophisms in the first year of logical studies.\nSophismata [Soph] is a collection of\nsophisms for advanced students working on natural philosophy.\nSophismata asinina [SophAs] is a collection\nof sophistical proofs that the reader is a donkey. Iuxta hunc\ntextum [IHT], also known as Consequentiae\nHeytesbury, is a collection of sophisms designed for testing\nformal inference rules. Casus obligationis\n[CO] is a collection of epistemic sophisms. De\nsensu composito et diviso [SCD] is a manual on\nthe logical analysis of the de re/de dicto\nambiguity. Termini naturales is a vocabulary of basic\nphysical\n concepts.[3]\n  Most of these have not been critically edited, but early prints,\nrecent editions, and several modern translations are\n available.[4] \nSince most of Heytesbury’s logical views are spelled out either\nin the context or in terms of\n obligationes,[5]\n a brief note on these must be the starting point of their\npresentation. The most important passages are in\n[SCD] and [Soph] and to a certain\ndegree in [RSS]. Three problems will be introduced:\n1) the basic concepts, and in particular, relevance; 2) the\ndistinction between metaphysical and epistemic possibility; and 3) the\ndistinction between conceding a sentence and conceding that a sentence\nis true. \nHeytesbury’s obligationes are zero-sum and dynamic\nconsistency games participated by two players, an\n“opponent” and a “respondent”. The opponent\nposits a “casus” (ponitur casus), i.e.,\nthe initial linguistic and extra-linguistic assumptions, and proposes\nparticular sentences. The respondent admits or denies the\ncasus (admittitur, negatur casus) depending\non its consistency and concedes (concedo), negates\n(nego), or doubts (dubito) the proposed sentences,\nthe criteria being logical relations to either casus or to\nthe totality of preceding moves (including the casus).\nHeytesbury chooses the latter option, thus subscribing to so-called\n“antiqua responsio” (Read 2013: 20–23). The\nrespondent wins if he maintains consistency. \nSentences proposed to the respondent split into “relevant”\nor “irrelevant” depending on their logical relation to\npreceding moves. If the sentence proposed to the respondent or its\nnegation follows from preceding moves, it is relevant\n(pertinens) and should be either conceded (if implied by\nthese moves) or negated (if it is incompatible with them); otherwise,\nit is irrelevant (impertinens). An irrelevant sentence is\neither conceded, negated, or doubted depending on the\nrespondent’s knowledge about the “external” world;\nit is conceded if known to be actually true, negated if known to be\nactually false and doubted otherwise. Such a game is dynamic in the\nsense that the status of irrelevant sentences can change in the game\ncourse ([SCD] 1494: fol. 4ra–rb [1988a:\n432–433]). This can happen for two reasons. First, if the\nexternal world changes during the game, the respondent’s move\nwould change along with his new information state since the\nrespondent’s moves regarding irrelevant sentences depend on his\nknowledge of the external world ([SCD] 1494: fol.\n4rb [1988a: 433]). The second (and more interesting) case is brought\nabout by a particular game course. Heytesbury’s example is the\nfollowing game: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: The king is seated or you are in\nRome. \n[R1] I admit the casus. \nThe casus is possible. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: The king is seated. \n[R2] I doubt that. \nIrrelevant and not known to be true or false in the external world. \n[O3] PROPONITUR: You are in Rome. \n[R3] I negate that. \nIrrelevant and known to be false. \n[O4] PROPONITUR: The king is seated. \n[R4] I concede that. \nRelevant and implied by [R1] and\n[R3]. \n[R2] and [R4] are correct moves because [R1] and [R3] are. When\n“the king is seated” is proposed in [O2], it can only be\nrelevant with respect to [R1], which is not the case as\ndisjunctions do not entail their sub-formulas. If the respondent is\nunaware of the king’s whereabouts, the sentence must be doubted.\n“You are in Rome” proposed in [O3] is also irrelevant, but\ncan be negated as known to be false in the external world. At that\npoint, “the king is seated” becomes relevant and must be\nconceded as implied by “the king is seated or you are in\nRome” and the negation of “you are in Rome” via\ndisjunctive syllogism ([SCD] 1494: fol. 4rb [1988a:\n433–434]). \n\n Heytesbury\n considers three types of casus: a) possible; b) impossible\nbut imaginable; and c) impossible and unimaginable\n([Soph] soph. 18 and 31 [1494: fols. 131va–vb\nand 162va–vb]). The criteria of possibility, which probably\npertain to metaphysics, are not spelled out clearly. The criteria of\nimaginability are logical and epistemological: \nBriefly, every casus which is not explicitly inconsistent or\nimpossible in a way not easily imaginable (such as a man being a\ndonkey etc.) can be admitted for the sake of disputation. But first,\nthe respondent has to make the impossibility of such casus\nexplicit and emphasize that he has not admitted the casus as\npossible but merely as imaginable, to defend its implications (as\nimaginable, not as possible) and to negate what is incompatible with\nit in accord with his obligation. ([Soph] soph. 31\n[1494: fol. 162va–vb]) \nThe realm of the imaginable includes whatever is epistemically\nadmissible for either logical or epistemic reasons. Neither is purely\nobjective: what can and cannot be imagined seems player-relative, as\nis being “explicitly” inconsistent (for seeing or\noverlooking a contradiction is a matter of individual skill). Examples\nof the imaginable include the existence of a vacuum, infinite\nvelocities, expansions of physical objects, and men being immortal,\nbut not men being\n donkeys.[6]\n The criteria may be practical: certain hypotheses are not productive.\nSince the respondent’s goal is to maintain consistency,\naccepting overtly inconsistent assumptions is a\n nonstarter,[7]\n and certain impossibilities are such that nobody would agree to\ndefend them even for the sake of\n argument.[8]\n Defining admissibility in terms of imaginability makes\nobligationes into a framework for discussing\n“impossibilities” with applications in\n physics[9]\n as a science based on conceptual analysis and\n thought-experiments,[10]\n where the “secundum imaginationem” assumptions\nplay the same role as the modern day idealizations such as mass points\nor frictionless\n movement.[11] \nA principle utilized in Heytesbury’s solution to various\nparadoxes states that a proposed sentence is evaluated according to\nits standard meaning, even if it is assumed to signify something else\nin the casus. For instance, the following moves of the\nrespondent would be correct: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: “All mice are grey”\nsignifies that all cats are blue. All cats are white. \n[R1] I concede the casus. \nThe casus is possible. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: All mice are grey. \n[R2] I concede that. \nIrrelevant and known to be true in the external world. \n[O3] PROPONITUR: The sentence “all mice are\ngrey” is true. \n[R3] I negate that. \nRelevant and inconsistent with the casus. \nBy [R2], the respondent agrees that all mice are grey, while by [R3]\nhe denies that all cats are blue. To concede a sentence is to agree\nthat what the sentence signifies according to its standard meaning is\nthe case, but to concede that a certain sentence is true is to agree\nthat what the sentence signifies in the casus is the case.\nThese may or may not be the same depending on the casus.\n([SophAs]\n 412)[12] \n\n The genre of “proprietates\n terminorum” developed in the twelfth century alongside the\nreception of Aristotle’s Sophistical refutations, and a\nlogico-semantical analysis of fallacies seems to have been one of its\nprimary\n applications.[13]\n It is an umbrella genre for, among others, theories of meaning and\nreference, the use-mention distinction, quantification, and tense.\nThese are utilized in several of Heytesbury’s works with\nterminological variations. Three of these issues will be presented\nhere: the theories of “suppositio”,\n“mobilitatio”, and\n“ampliatio”. \nSupposition is a semantic relation between terms and the object(s)\nthey stand for in a sentential context. The modes of supposition are\nconnected to the way sentences can be analyzed (expositio),\nin particular, to the way general terms can be replaced by a\nstructured collection of subordinate terms, the so-called\n“descensus”. The following classifications of\nsuppositions can be reconstructed from Heytesbury’s\nwritings: \nMaterial supposition (“only you are a donkey” in\n“only you are a donkey is false”) consists in mentioning\nan expression ([SophAs] 403), whereas personal (or\nsignificative) supposition consists in using it\n([SophAs] 404). Discrete supposition is a personal\nsupposition of a singular term ([SophAs]\n 390);[14]\n its complement is usually called “common” supposition and\nis further divided into determinate and confused suppositions.\nDeterminate supposition is exemplified by the supposition of\n“human” in “some human is an animal”\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 3va [1988a: 427]), connected to the\ndescensus, whereby it can be paraphrased as “this human\nis an animal or that human is an animal etc.”\n([SophAs] 387). Merely confused or non-distributive\nsupposition is exemplified by the supposition of “animal”\nin “every human is an animal” and connected to\n“disjunctive” descensus ([SCD]\n1494, fol. 2va–vb [1988a: 420–421]; [Soph]\nsoph. 7 [1494: fol. 106rb] and soph. 16 (1494: fol. 127vb)), whereby\nit can be paraphrased as “every man is this animal or that\nanimal etc.” Confused and distributive suppositions are most\ntypically exemplified by the supposition of “human” in\n“every human is an animal”, connecting the\ndescensus to every instance of the common term, whereby it\ncan be paraphrased as “this human is an animal and that human is\nan animal etc.” ([SCD] 1494: fol. 2va–vb\n[1988a: 420–421]; [Soph] soph. 7 [1494: fol.\n106rb] and soph. 16 [1494: fol. 127vb]). \nThe theory of suppositio is extended by the theory of\n“mobility” and “immobility”. If a particular\nmode of descensus is admissible, that type of supposition is\ncalled “mobile” (mobilis); otherwise it is called\n“immobile”\n (immobilis).[15]\n Heytesbury’s example of immobile supposition is the function of\n“penny” in “I promise you a penny” or\n“human” in “by necessity, every man is an\nanimal” ([PC] 1494: fol. 188vb;\n[IHT] arg. 19; [SophAs] 398). \nNote that: First, the so-called “simple”\n(“human” in “human is a species”) supposition\nis\n omitted.[16]\n Second, Heytesbury’s analysis of predicates in terms of the\nmerely confused supposition is nominalist, as opposed to the realist\nanalysis of these examples in terms of standing for an abstract\n object.[17]\n Third, Heytesbury endorses the Aristotelian sensus\ncompositus-sensus divisus distinction, rather than the\nterminist framework in cases where that would be\n appropriate.[18] \nLastly, Heytesbury introduces the so-called\n“ampliatio”, which consist in extending the range\nof a term to non-actual entities, such as entities in the past,\nfuture, or mere possibilia. Thus, for instance, the proper paraphrase\nof the sentence “a white thing can be black” is\n“something that now is white or can be white can be black”\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 2va [1988a:\n 418]).[19]\n The complementary property is called\n“restrictio” ([Soph] soph. 4\n[1494: fol. 89vb]). \n\n The basic textual evidence for\n Heytesbury’s theory of deductive validity includes\n[IHT], [Soph] and [RSS]. \n[IHT] is a collection of arguments for both the\nvalidity and invalidity of spurious inferences. Typically, the\npro-arguments construe them as instances of formal inference rules\n(bona et formalis), the contra-arguments argue that they are\nnot valid (non valet), and the resolutions show that the\ninference under scrutiny is not a genuine instance of such a rule.\nThis method presupposes that deductive validity is ultimately\ntruth-preservation (an inference is valid if its consequent cannot be\nfalse while its antecedent is true or if its antecedent is\nincompatible with the negation of the consequent)\n([IHT] arg. 6). The criterion is that it is not\npossible to present a counterexample, i.e., a possible (obligational)\nsituation (casu possibili posito) verifying the antecedent\nand falsifying the consequent ([IHT] arg. 2). The\nmethod also presupposes that the underlying inference rules are\nassumed to be legitimate but misapplied in such sophisms as to require\nelucidation, and not revision. The treatise is mostly concerned with\nthe analysis of logical form (expositio) of sentences\ncontaining operators (officialia) such as “only”,\n“nothing but”, “begins”, “ceases”,\netc., with a few applications of modal and epistemic logic. \n[IHT] introduces the distinction between the\n“universal” (bona et formalis generaliter) and\n“restricted” (bona et formalis specialiter)\nformal validity: \nAn inference is formally valid in the universal sense if the opposite\nof its consequent is formally incompatible with its antecedent and a\nsimilar form [of argument] holds in all applications (consimilis\nforma valet in omni materia) (…) An inference is\n[formally] valid in the restricted sense if the opposite of its\nconsequent is formally incompatible with its antecedent, but not every\nsuch application is valid. ([IHT] arg. 11) \nThe concept of formal compatibility is not explicitly introduced in\nthis context. \n[Soph] relates the relevance view of formality as a\nconceptual connection between premises and conclusions to the\nsubstitutional view of formality as validity under any substitution of\nextra-logical terms or in any domain of application (in omni\nmateria). If an inference is valid only in a restricted domain of\napplication, it is valid based on content or in a particular domain of\napplication (de materia, gratia materiae) or\n“simply valid” (bona simpliciter)\n([IHT] arg. 11; [Soph] soph. 3\n[1494: fol. 86ra]). The concept of formal incompatibility is clarified\nas part of the explication of validity based upon the form (de\nforma): \nIt is commonly agreed that such inference is not valid based upon the\nform, because the opposite of its consequent and its antecedent do not\nformally imply a contradiction, where “to imply a contradiction\nformally” means that these two cannot be distinguished or\nconsistently and distinctively imagined as holding simultaneously.\n([Soph] soph. 2 [1494: fol. 83rb]) \nAs opposed to testing simple validity against possible counter-models,\nformal validity is tested against impossible but imaginable\ncounter-models to eliminate extra-linguistic influences. Imaginable\ncasus introduced in obligationes are thereby\nutilized as part of general logic. \nFinally, a “necessary” inference is one which can be\nreduced to a categorical or hypothetical syllogism via a necessary\nauxiliary assumption or “middle” (per medium\nnecessarium) ([Soph] soph. 2 [1494: fol. 83rb]).\nSimilarly, two sentences are assumed to be logically equivalent\n(convertantur) if they imply each other formally via a\nnecessary middle ([RSS] 1494: fol. 15rb–va\n[1988b:\n 461–462]).[20]\n This represents the view of validity as reducibility to\nparadigmatically valid\n syllogisms.[21] \nIn general, Heytesbury introduces three levels of\n validity.[22]\n First, validity as relevance secured by logical form in every domain\nof application, explicated as truth-preservation of all inferences\nsharing the same logical form (forma or modus\narguendi) with respect to every imaginable world. Second,\nvalidity as relevance secured by conceptual content with a restricted\ndomain of application, explicated as truth-preservation with respect\nto all imaginable worlds, which is not substitution-invariant. Third,\nvalidity as simple truth-preservation with respect to all possible\nworlds. Heytesbury’s parallel use of different concepts of\nformality makes him a representative of British logic in the\ntransition period, containing different stages of development: the\nsubstitutional view (validity preserved in all substitution-instances)\ntypical for the “Continental tradition”, the relevance\nview (conceptual connection) typical for the “British\ntradition” and later Paul of Venice and Paul of Pergula, and\nformality as reducibility to a syllogism typical for the early\nfourteenth-century\n tradition.[23] \nHeytesbury’s analysis of epistemic statements encompasses the\nlogical analysis of epistemic statements, inference rules for\nsentences containing epistemic operators, and rules for obligational\ngames with epistemic statements, most of which are applied to\nsolutions to\n sophisms[24]\n and instructions for obligational games. The underlying principles\npertaining to the logical analysis of language and inference rules for\nepistemic statements will be addressed\n below.[25] \nLet us consider the following two sentences:  \n(dr), called “sensus divisus” by Heytesbury,\ndenotes that there is a person (who happens to be Socrates) of whom I\ncorrectly know that he is running in Beaumont, but about whom I may or\nmay not know that he is Socrates; his kinematics, but not his\nidentity, is part of my belief. On the other hand, according to (dd),\ncalled “sensus compositus” by Heytesbury, I know\nthat it is Socrates who is running in Beaumont. Hence if I believed\nthat Socrates died years ago, (dr) could be true but (dd) would be\nfalse ([SCD] 1494: fol. 3va [1988a: 427] and\n[RSS] 1494, fol. 13rb and [1988b:\n 444]).[26]\n By strictly endorsing the Aristotelian framework and analyzing\nepistemic contexts in terms of the de re/de dicto\nambiguity, Heytesbury does not participate in the fourteenth-century\ndevelopments in the logical analysis of\n language.[27]\n Also, his criteria for distinguishing between the two readings are\npurely syntactic, whereby scholastic Latin is viewed as an artificial\nlanguage with strict formation\n rules.[28] \nHeytesbury’s remarks on the “common interpretation of\nknowledge” emphasize that a firm and unhesitant belief does not\nconstitute knowledge unless it is veridical, which results in the\nformulation “to know is nothing other than unhesitatingly to\napprehend the truth—i.e., to believe unhesitatingly that it is\nso when it is so in reality” ([RSS] 1494: fol.\n13vb [1988b:\n 447]).[29]\n This implies the veracity of knowledge, formally (where\n“\\(K(\\xi,X)\\)” abbreviates “the agent \\(\\xi\\) knows\nthat X”): \nThe introspection axioms govern iterated epistemic modalities (Boh\n1984 and 1985). While denying the possibility of doubting one’s\nown knowledge, Heytesbury proposes positive introspection: \nThis principle is spelled out in terms of the definienda of knowledge:\nif an agent perceives something unhesitatingly and pays attention to\nwhether he does or does not perceive it, he also perceives that he\nperceives it, for both the first and second-order knowledge are based\non the same evidence ([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b:\n447–448]). Heytesbury also holds the contraposition of (4)\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b: 448]): \nIn the context of (T), Heytesbury discusses the casus where\nan agent sees a person who looks exactly like a king, but is not one.\nThe agent can believe the man to be a king beyond any doubt and even\nbelieve himself to know that. But, by (T), he knows neither that the\nman is a king (because that is not true), nor that the man is not a\nking (because he does not believe that) ([RSS] 1494:\nfol. 13vb [1988b: 447]). Even though Heytesbury doesn’t\nexplicitly say so, it seems natural to assume that this agent\ndoesn’t know that he failed to know that man is a king. Hence he\nfails to know something, but also, presumably, fails to know that he\nfails to know it, which is a counter-example to negative\nintrospection: \nAccepting (4) while denying (5) is based on Heytesbury’s\ninterpretation of knowledge as an evidence-based act of considering\nsomething and apprehending its factuality: the absence of knowledge\nalone does not constitute conscious ignorance. \nHeytesbury’s account of the closure properties of knowledge\nencompasses the closure of meaning under entailment, the distribution\nof knowledge over implication, and the distribution of knowledge over\nsignification. \nFirst, Heytesbury introduces the concept of implied meaning\n(significare ex consequenti) and believes that sentential\nmeaning is closed under entailment. As he explains the different\nsenses of “signifying precisely” (significare\nprecise), he claims that a sentence cannot signify something\nprecisely in the sense of not signifying anything else. Instead,\n“to signify precisely” means that a sentence has a\n“primary meaning” (“significat primo et\nprincipaliter” or “significatio primaria et\nadequata”) plus whatever its primary meaning entails\n(quod sequitur ipsam significantem quod ita sit), but nothing\nelse ([RSS] 1494: fol. 15ra–rb [1988b:\n 459–460]).[31]\n To allow that, Heytesbury’s semantics must validate the\nfollowing principle (where “\\(\\textrm{sig}(x,X)\\)”\nabbreviates “x signifies that X”): \nSecond, Heytesbury denies outright logical omniscience, i.e., the\nclosure of knowledge under implication: \nbut agrees with the distribution of knowledge over implication, i.e.,\nthat knowledge is closed under known inferences (the “axiom\nK”) ([CO] soph. 2): \nThird, if an agent knows that it is completely the case as a sentence\nsignifies, does he know that everything it signifies is the\n case?[34]\n The problem of conceding a sentence whose meaning is deductively\nclosed by an agent with a finite cognitive capacity is solved by\nintroducing a distinction parallel to (K) and (O)\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 15rb [1988b: 460]); Heytesbury\ndenies: \nbut holds: \nTogether with “strong” semantic closure,\nHeytesbury’s analysis of epistemic operators validates the\n“weaker” distribution principles and rejects the\n“stronger” closure principles, i.e., different forms of\nlogical\n omniscience.[35] \nHeytesbury analyzes insolubilia or self-referential paradoxes\nmost thoroughly in the first chapter of\n [RSS],[36]\n where he dismisses three alternative solutions to paradoxes to settle\nfor the fourth. The first three positions agree that paradoxical\nsentences can have precisely their standard meaning. According to the\nfirst position held by Roger Swyneshed, paradoxical sentences are\nfalse because they imply their own falsity, and a sentence and its\nnegation can be false at the same time if one of them is paradoxical\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 4va and 6rb [1979: 18–19 and\n45]). According to the second position, paradoxical sentences do not\nmake genuine statements, hence are neither true nor false\n([RSS] 1494: fols. 4va–vb [1979: 19]). That is\nreminiscent of the so-called “cassantes” who\nclaim that paradoxical sentences fail to make a true or false\nstatement (literally “say nothing”) (de Rijk 1966), available, for instance,\nthrough Burley or Bradwardine (Roure 1970; Bradwardine B-I. Heytesbury\nalso could have viewed the second position as the interpretation of\nBradwardine’s “mediantes”, who claims that\nparadoxical sentences are neither true nor false, but of a\n“middle\n value”.[37]\n According to the third position, paradoxical sentences are\neither-true-or-false but neither true nor false; they make genuine\nstatements, but fail to have a standard truth-value\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 4vb [1979: 19–20]). \nAccording to the fourth position, paradoxical sentences have their\nstandard meaning, but say more than what their overt meanings\nindicate. It is based on the definitions of a paradoxical\ncasus and a paradoxical sentence. There are two versions of\nthese definitions, differing in the last clause: \nA paradoxical casus is one in which mention is made of some\nsentence such that if in the same casus that sentence\nsignifies precisely as its words commonly pretend, from its being true\nfollows that it is false, and vice versa. ([RSS]\n1494: fol. 6rb [1979: 47]) \nor: \n…it follows that it is true and also false. (Pozzi 1987:\n236) \nFurthermore: \nA paradoxical sentence is one of which mention is made in a\nparadoxical casus, such that if in the same casus it\nsignifies precisely as its words commonly pretend, then from its being\ntrue follows that it is false, and vice versa ([RSS]\n1494: fol. 6rb [1979: 47]). \nor: \n…it follows that it is true and also false. (Pozzi 1987:\n 236)[38] \nThe solution to paradoxes is exemplified by the casus, where\nSocrates only pronounces the sentence “Socrates is saying\nsomething false”, henceforth labelled (s). Five elementary\nsettings differ in assumptions concerning its meaning: \nFor Heytesbury, “to solve a paradox” is to instruct the\nrespondent in the corresponding obligatio-game. His\ninstructions are as follows: \nThe corresponding moves are: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s). \n[R1] I admit the casus. \nThe casus is possible. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: (s) is false. \n[R2] ??? \nIrrelevant and ??? \nHeytesbury applies his view of obligationes: in the absence\nof any other assumptions, (s) is initially irrelevant. As such, if\nproposed as the first sentence in the game, the respondent’s\nmove cannot be affected by either the casus or the previous\nmoves, but must follow the respondent’s knowledge about the\nexternal world. Heytesbury’s emphasis on the stage of the game\nsuggests that this can change due to the dynamic character of\nobligationes. \nThe corresponding moves are: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s) and (s)\nsignifies precisely that (s) is false \n[R1] I do not admit the casus. \nThe casus is inconsistent. \nSince obligationes are consistency-maintenance games, the\nonly non-losing strategy for a respondent is not to start such a game,\nfor otherwise he would be dragged into inconsistency via the\nwell-known paradoxical reasoning. \nThe corresponding moves are: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s) and (s)\nsignifies that (s) is false \n[R1] I admit the casus. \nThe casus is consistent. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: (s) is false. \n[R2] I concede that. \nImplied by the casus. \n[O3] PROPONITUR: “(s) is false” is\ntrue. \n[R3] I deny that. \nIncompatible with the casus. \nThe justification of [R2] is not clearly explained in\n[RSS]. A minimalist interpretation is that the\nproposed sentence is implied by [R1] via reductio: If (s) is\nfalse, then it is false (trivially); if (s) is not false, it is true,\nand then it is the case as it signifies, hence it is false. Either\nway, it is false, hence it is\n false.[39]\n An obligational explanation is that (s) is regarded as relevant in\nthis casus, and as such can only be conceded or denied. Since\nits denial implies an inconsistency, such a move must be avoided in a\nconsistency-maintenance game, therefore it should be conceded. Since\nthe casus has been admitted as consistent, it cannot validate\nan inconsistent move, hence it must validate its opposite. By the same\nreasoning, it is possible to deny that (s) is true. Furthermore,\nHeytesbury refuses to certify the additional meaning of (s)\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 6va [1979: 49–50]).\nUnsatisfactory as this may seem, it is legitimate from the point of\nview of obligationes: meaning certification is not a move\navailable to the respondent, and since the instructions are\nrespondent-oriented, the actual meaning of (s) is an external\nproblem. \n(2.31) and (2.32) are dealt with along the same lines. \nFor Heytesbury, paradoxes are obligational games with self-referential\n sentences.[40]\n However, his criticism of alternative solutions is part of the\nfourteenth-century developments relating paradoxes to general\nlogico-semantical\n issues.[41]\n He views his approach as relatively defensible and probable, but\nadmits that he cannot solve all objections and considers a completely\nsatisfactory solution to paradoxes impossible (unfortunately without a\njustification). Without too much self-confidence, he closes his\ntreatise by saying that young students should move past the topic and\ndo something useful. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 4vb and 7rb\n[1979: 21 and 58]) \nHeytesbury’s treatise Regule solvendi sophismata may be\ntaken as representative of Oxford Calculators’s\nspeculative/mathematical physics. It links interests in logic,\nmathematics, and physics. As Curtis Wilson says: “Heytesbury\nemploys the concept of “limit” and “infinite\naggregate” with considerable precision and subtlety; and in\ntreating of variable physics quantities, he approaches the ideal of a\npurely mathematical description” (Wilson 1960: 3). Not only does\nHeytesbury analyze physical and mathematical problems by means of the\ntechniques of the logica moderna, but he also employs\nphysical and mathematical rules in the analyses of logical or semantic\nproblems of denomination. Heytesbury is mostly interested in the\nproblem of determining under what conditions a subject can be\ndenominated such-and-such, e.g., “white” or\n“running”. The issue of denomination arises because the\nattributes of subjects vary in degrees of intensity or completeness.\nHe establishes sets of rules of everyday speech, determining how we\ndenominate a subject under all imaginable circumstances of change. For\nexample, in sophism Omnis homo qui est albus currit, he\nconcludes that a man is called to be “white” if and only\nif the external surface of the upper half of him is white (in everyday\nspeech, a man is white if the skin of his face is white) (Wilson 1960:\n22–23). \nLike one of the founders of the School of Oxford\nCalculators—Richard Kilvington– Heytesbury takes\nOckham’s nominalist position and affirms that the real physical\nworld consists only of res absolutae, i.e., substances and\nqualities. They both acknowledge that terms such as\n“point”, “line”,\n“latitude”, and “degree” do\nnot have any representation in reality, but are useful for describing\ndifferent types of change. They also hold that time is not real since\ntime is not distinguished realiter from the motion of\ncelestial sphere, and motion not distinguished realiter from\nthe body which moves. Thus, they both contrast things that are really\ndistinct with things distinguishable only in reason, i.e., in the\nimagination. Heytesbury follows Kilvington’s frequent use of the\nphrase secundum imaginationem. Imaginary cases are\ndescriptions of hypothetical situations; the elements of the\ndescription, and not the situation itself, are of primary concern. The\nonly requirement for an imaginable case is that it should not involve\na formal logical contradiction; whether it is physically possible or\nnot is a matter of indifference. As Wilson says,  \na distinction is drawn between realiter or\nnaturaliter or physice loquendo and logice\nor sophistice loquendo: physice we follow experience\nand the principles laid down in the natural philosophy of Aristotle;\nlogice or sophistice we are free to introduce\nwhatever distinctions and cases are convenient and imaginable. (Wilson\n1960: 25) \nHeytesbury, however, remains in the framework of Aristotelian\nphilosophy of nature, and the problems he discusses are to be found in\nAristotle’s Physica and De caelo.\nNevertheless, Heytesbury is captivated by the mathematical approach\nlike former Oxford Calculators were. Like Thomas Bradwardine and\nRichard Kilvington, he examines physical problems using mathematical\napparatus. In Chapters 4–6 of the Regulae, Heytesbury\ndevelops the measurement by limit, i.e., by the first and last\ninstants of the beginning and ending, and by the intrinsic and\nextrinsic limits of passive and active capacities. Although these type\nof “measuring” do not appear to be straightforwardly\nmathematical, it raises mathematical considerations and give\noutstanding results in analyses of the instantaneous in motion and\ntime, as well as analyses of the continuum. As Wilson states:  \n“Heytesbury admits “according to the common mode of\nspeech” that everything which is, whether time or motion or\ninstant, is in an instant, in the sense that it is instantaneously\nmeasured by an instant […] the instant in time and the\ninstantaneous position in movement are always to be regarded as\n“limits”. (Wilson 1960: 41)  \nThe second type of measurement employs a new calculus of compounding\nratios. The third type of measurement, by latitude of forms, describes\nmotion, in which an accidental form, such as speed, is intensified or\ndiminished. He focuses on establishing the rules for uniform and\ndifform local motion, alteration, and augmentation. He is centered on\nthe possible measure of the speed of such motions by the effect\nproduced during equal length of time. Thus, he is interested in the\nkinematical aspect of motion (Ideo viso iam generaliter penes quid\ntamquam quo ad effectum attendatur velocitas in motu locali, quia\nsecundum proportionem potentie motoris ad potentiam resistivam\ngeneraliter attenditur velocitas in quocumque motu tamquam quo ad eius\ncausam) ([RSS] 1494: fol. 44rb). \nIn chapter IV of the Regulae (De incipit et desinit)\nHeytesbury poses and analyzes in great detail cases in which any\nthing, process, or state may be said to begin or cease to be. He\nbegins with possible expositions of the terms “beginning”\n(incipere) and “ceasing” (desinere) in a\nway that uncovers certain paradoxical properties of the temporal\ncontinuum. “Beginning” may be expounded by\npositio of the present (i.e., by the positing of existence in\nthe present instant) and remotio of the past (i.e., by denial\nof existence in the past), meaning that in the present instant a thing\nor a process is, and immediately prior to the present instant it was\nnot. “Beginning” may be also expounded by remotio\nof the present and positio of the future, meaning that in the\npresent instant a thing or a process is not, and immediately after the\npresent instant it will be. Likewise, “ceasing” may be\nexpounded in two ways, either by remotio of the present and\npositio of the past, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is not, and immediately prior to the present\ninstant it was, or by positio of the present and\nremotio of the future, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is, and immediately after the present instant it\nwill not be. Heytesbury offers a number of sophisms involving the\nlimit-decision. One of them is particularly interesting since it\nclearly exhibits Heytesbury’s remarkable skill in solving\nproblems of instantaneous motion and time without symbolic techniques\nof the calculus. Heytesbury poses a case in which both Plato and\nSocrates begin to move from rest at the same instant, but Plato starts\nto move with a constant acceleration and Socrates with an acceleration\nwhich starts at zero degree and increases uniformly with time. He\nconcludes that “both Socrates and Plato infinitely slowly begin\nto be moved, and yet Socrates infinitely more slowly begins to be moved\nthan Plato” (Wilson 1960: 54, [RSS] 1494: fol. 26vb).\nAs Wilson proves, the\nconclusion is an effect of comparison of two infinitesimals of\ndifferent order.  \nIn the case under consideration both the velocity of Plato (\\(v_p\\))\nand the velocity of Socrates (\\(v_s\\)) are infinitesimal for time\nt approaching zero. Two infinitesimals are said to be of\ndifferent order if the limit of their quotient is either zero or\ninfinite. In the case under consideration the limit of the quotient\n\\(v_p/v_s\\) as \\(t\\rightarrow 0\\) is infinite. (Wilson 1960: 55) \nIn chapter V of the Regulae, Heytesbury considers the limits\nof capacities, and he applies the limit-concept to the bounding of the\nranges of variables and aggregates. All capacities are sorted as\nactive or passive. An active capacity (force) is measured against the\npassive capacity (resistance) which it can overcome. If an active\ncapacity can overcome some resistance, it can overcome less. For\nexample, if Socrates can lift one hundred pounds, he can lift fifty\npounds. Conversely, if a passive capacity can be affected by less, it\ncan be affected by greater. For example, if Socrates can see a grain\nof millet from the distance of a mile, he will be able to see the\nChurch at the same distance. The boundaries of capacities are of two\nkinds: an intrinsic boundary (when an element is a member of the\nsequence of elements it bounds: maximum quod sic, minimum quod\nsic) and an extrinsic boundary (when an element which serves as a\nboundary stands outside the range of elements which it bounds:\nmaximum quod non, minimum quod non). From the definitions of\nactive and passive capacities, it follows that the boundary of an\nactive capacity must be assigned either by the affirmation of the\nmaximum (maximum quod sic) or by the negation of the minimum\n(minimum quod non); the boundary of a passive capacity is\nassigned either by the affirmation of the minimum (minimum quod\nsic) or by the negation of the maximum (maximum quod\nnon). \nHeytesbury sets the following conditions which must be obtained for\nlimits to exist: (1) There must be a range in which the capacity can\nact or be acted upon, and another range in which it cannot act or be\nacted upon, and not both; (2) Each capacity should only be able to\ntake a value in the range on which it is measured from zero and the\nvalue which serves as its boundary. Thus, if an active capacity is\ncapable of acting upon a given passive capacity in the range, it must\nbe capable of acting upon any less, and if it is not capable of acting\nupon a given passive capacity, it is not capable of acting upon any\ngreater. Conversely, if a passive capacity is capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it must be capable of being acted upon by any\nagent of greater strength, and if it is not capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it is not capable of being acted upon by a\nweaker agent; and (3) Infinite capacities like the infinite power of\nGod are excluded from the discussion, since no termination can be\nassigned for them ([RSS] 1494: fol.\n29va–vb). \nHeytesbury, like Kilvington, classifies all capacities as mutable or\nimmutable. A mutable capacity is capable of more and less, and both\naffirmative and negative parts of the division might be assigned. For\nexample, with respect to Socrates, a mutable power of lifting (an\nactive capacity) a minimum quod non is assigned. For a\npassive capacity the maximum quod non is assigned, e.g., a\nmaximum visible body which cannot be seen at a given distance. An\nimmutable capacity acts in a determinate way, so it produces the only\none effect it actually produces. Therefore, the affirmative part of\nthe division is always assigned as a boundary for immutable capacity.\nThus, e.g., there is a maximum distance which, ceteris\nparibus, Socrates can traverse in an hour by a speed which\nincreases uniformly from A to B degree ([RSS] 1494:\nfol. 29vb; Wilson 1960: 73). \nChapter VI (De tribus praedicamentis) of the Regulae\ndeals with motion in three categories: place, quantity, and quality.\nThe first part (de motu locali) deals with the quickness or\nslowness in uniformly or difformly accelerated and decelerated motion\nconsidered in its kinematical aspect. The second part (de\nvelocitate motus augmentationis) deals with augmentation\nunderstood as pure increase in size, and more specifically with the\nspeed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced, i.e., by\nspace traversed in time. The third part (de velocitate motus\nalterationis) is concentrated on mathematical description of\nvariation of intensity in space and time. The prime purpose to be\nachieved in this chapter is to establish definitions of speed in the\nthree categories of motion. All debated cases are posed secundum\nimaginationem. \nLocal motions are grouped into two classes: uniform and difform. A\nuniform motion is motion in which equal spaces are traversed\ncontinually in equal parts of time. Difform motions can vary in\ninfinite ways, both with respect to the magnitude or the subject\nmoved, and with respect to time. Difform motion with respect to the\nsubject moved is motion in which different points of the body move\nwith unequal speeds; for instance, a rolling wheel moves with difform\nmotion since different points on the wheel vary in regard to distance\nfrom the axis of rotation. Difform motion with respect to time is\nmotion in which unequal spaces are traversed in equal times. Motion\ncan also be difform with respect to both time and the subject moved.\nDifform motions are subdivided into two classes: the uniformly difform\nmotion and the difformly difform motion. Uniformly difform motion is\nmotion in which the speed either increases or decreases uniformly,\nthat is, a motion in which in any equal parts of time, equal latitudes\nof speed are either acquired or lost. A difformly difform motion is\nmotion in which a greater latitude of velocity is gained or lost in\none part of time than in another equal to it. \nThe most gripping example of uniformly difform motion is accelerated\nmotion, like a motion of a body moving towards the earth. Heytesbury\ngives a general rule, called Mean Speed Theorem, by which we may\ncalculate the distance traversed from the latitude of speed uniformly\nacquired. He makes use of this theorem to both accelerate and\ndecelerate motions. According to this rule, the distance traversed by\na uniformly accelerated body in a given time is equal to the distance\nwhich would be traversed in the same time in a uniform motion with its\nmean speed (half of the sum of the initial and final speed). A number\nof conclusions follow from this theorem: \nIn concluding the chapter, Heytesbury states that an infinite number\nof sophisms can be made concerning speed in local motion, as well as\nintension and remission of such speed (Infinita possunt fieri\nsophismata de velocitate motus localis et de comparatione unius motus\nad alium, et de comparatione intensionis ad remissionem motus et\nconiungendo latitudinem motus intensionis et remissionis cum\nlatitudine velocitatis ([RSS] 1494: fols.\n44rb–44va)). \nHeytesbury presents the same concern with quantitative description of\nhypothetical cases in the subchapter dealing with qualitative change.\nHe takes part in the debate over one of the most widely discussed\nproblems in the fourteenth-century philosophy of nature focused on the\npossible “measure” of the intension and remission of\nforms. Like most of the Oxford Calculators, Heytesbury accepts\nScotus’s and Ockham’s addition theory and assumes that the\nintension of form is the result of adding qualitative parts. As an\nOckhamist, Heytesbury emphasizes that the term “motion” in\nalteration connotes nothing else than the degrees or latitude of\nquality that are successively acquired. A basic assumption is that\nqualitative intensity is a certain kind of linearly ordered and\nadditive quantity. Thus, as in the case of local motion, Heytesbury\ndivides the latitudes of motion of alteration into the latitude of\nmotion of intension and the latitude of motion of remission; and the\nlatitude of the latitude of motion into the latitude of the\nacquisition of the latitude of motion and the latitude of the loss of\nlatitude of motion. In modern terminology, these latitudes correspond\nto latitudes of speed and of acceleration and deceleration,\nrespectively. Since there is no limit to speeds of alteration nor to\nrates of acceleration or deceleration of that speed, those latitudes\nare all infinite. \nHeytesbury presents three different ways of “measuring”\nthe speed of alteration in which intensity of a quality varies form\none point to another, or from instant to instant of time, or from\npoint to point of the moving body: (1) by the degree (gradus)\ninduced (a subject is considered to be altered faster when a higher\ndegree is induced); (2) by the latitude of form acquired in comparison\nto the size of the subject (the speed of alteration is proportionally\ngreater in a larger body); and (3) by the latitude acquired in a given\ntime, without regard to size of the subject undergoing alteration.\nHeytesbury holds the third position and claims that as in the case of\nlocal motion, the speed of alteration is to be measured at the point\nof the body where the rate of change is most rapid, that is, where the\nmaximum latitude of form is acquired ([RSS] 1494:\nfol. 51ra). \nHeytesbury deals with augmentation as with pure increase in size,\nwhich is the same process as rarefaction; more precisely, he deals\nwith the speed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced.\nThere are three ways of “measuring” the speed of\naugmentation acquired in time: (1) by the maximum quantity acquired;\n(2) by the latitude of rarity or rareness; and (3) by the ratio of new\nsize to previous size ([RSS] 1494: fol. 60rb). He\nholds the third position, according to which the ratios correspond to\ndifferent degrees of augmentation. Augmentation, like the two other\nmotions, can be uniform or difform. An augmentation is uniform if in\nequal intervals of time, the body undergoing augmentation increases in\nsize by the same ratio. While discussing the above mentioned\npositions, Heytesbury makes broad use of the new calculus of ratios\ninvented by Kilvington and Bradwardine. \nAs a logician, Heytesbury strongly influenced logic in fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century Britain, and there is a notable fifteenth and early\nsixteenth-century reception in Italy where multiple editions of his\ncommentaries on [RSS] and [SCD] were\nprinted (Ashworth & Spade 1992; de Rijk 1975, 1977). As of now,\nonly the influence of his insolubilia-treatise is\nparticularly well-documented. Despite his dismissive attitude toward\nthis genre, Heytesbury’s treatise is one of the most influential\nlate medieval texts. These influences include the British logical\ntradition (see Pironet 2008), the Italian logical\n tradition,[42]\n and John Mair’s\n circle,[43]\n and the treatise is referred to even as late as 1688 (De Benedictis\n1688: 580–590; for other influence, see Spade 1989: 273).\nHeytesbury’s catalogue of solutions to the paradoxes, where the\npositions are (correctly or not) attributed to fourteenth-century\nBritish logicians, is further developed and sometimes defended against\nHeytesbury’s harsh and sarcastic dismissal. (R2.2) is developed\nby extending the proof and supplemented by saying that paradoxical\nsentences (or all sentences, for that matter) signify their own truth.\nAs a philosopher, Heytesbury significantly influenced later Oxford\nCalculators: John Dumbleton, anonymous author of Tractatus de sex\ninconvenientibus, Richard Swineshead, author of one of the most\nfamous treatise Liber Calculationum, and continental\nfourteenth and fifteenth-century philosophers, e.g., John Casali, John\nof Holland, Petrus of Mantua, Cajetan of Thiene, Giovanni Marliani,\nand Paul of Venice (see Wilson 1960: 25–28). The Mean Speed\nTheorem was widely discussed during the fourteenth and fifteenth\ncenturies, and later played an important role in the formulation of\nthe law of free fall (see Damerow et al. 1992: 161–200,\nesp. 232–236).","contact.mail":"misao@kfi.zcu.cz","contact.domain":"kfi.zcu.cz"},{"date.published":"2018-01-19","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heytesbury/","author1":"Miroslav Hanke","author2":"Elzbieta Jung","entry":"heytesbury","body.text":"\n\n\nWilliam Heytesbury (c. 1313–1372/3), a member of Oxford’s\nMerton College and the School of “Oxford Calculators”, was\nmost likely a student of Richard Kilvington, who was a younger\ncontemporary of John Dumbleton. Heytesbury developed the works of\nThomas Bradwardine and Richard Kilvington, and he was also influenced\nby Walter Burley, William Ockham, and Roger Swyneshed (or Swineshead). He authored a\npopular textbook Regulae solvendi sophismata and several\nother collections of sophisms. He linked interests in logic,\nmathematics, and physics. He formulated the Mean Speed Theorem\noffering a proper rule for uniformly accelerated motion, later\ndeveloped by Galileo. His works anticipated nineteenth-century\nmathematical analyses of the continuum. He influenced logic in Britain\nand Italy (where several late fourteenth and early fifteenth-century\neditions of his texts were printed) and his influence lasted until the\nsixteenth century when the debates he participated in declined.\n\nWilliam Heytesbury was most likely born before 1313 in Wiltshire\n(Salisbury Diocese). He is first mentioned as a fellow at Merton\nCollege in Oxford in 1330; he is thus among the second generation of\nOxford Calculators (a follower of Thomas Bradwardine and Richard\nKilvington, a contemporary of John Dumbleton and Roger Swyneshed, and\na predecessor of Richard Swineshead). He held the administrative\nposition of a bursar of Merton in 1338–1339, responsible for\ndetermining dues, auditing accounts, and collecting\n revenues.[1]\n He was named a fellow of the new Queen’s College in 1340, but\nwas soon mentioned among the fellows of Merton College again. He is\nrecorded to have become a Doctor of Theology in 1348, yet none of his\ntheological works are known. He was chancellor of the University in\n1371–72 (and perhaps also in 1353–54) and died shortly\nthereafter, between December 1372 and January\n 1373.[2] \nHeytesbury’s extant writings, which are tentatively dated to the\nperiod 1331–1339 by Weisheipl, are (with one exception)\nconcerned with the analysis of fallacies and sophisms. Regulae\nsolvendi sophismata [RSS] or Logica (a\ncollection of six treatises: on paradoxes, on knowing and doubting, on\nrelative terms, on beginning and ceasing, on maxima and minima, and on\nthe velocity of movements) is concerned with instructions for solving\ndifferent types of sophisms in the first year of logical studies.\nSophismata [Soph] is a collection of\nsophisms for advanced students working on natural philosophy.\nSophismata asinina [SophAs] is a collection\nof sophistical proofs that the reader is a donkey. Iuxta hunc\ntextum [IHT], also known as Consequentiae\nHeytesbury, is a collection of sophisms designed for testing\nformal inference rules. Casus obligationis\n[CO] is a collection of epistemic sophisms. De\nsensu composito et diviso [SCD] is a manual on\nthe logical analysis of the de re/de dicto\nambiguity. Termini naturales is a vocabulary of basic\nphysical\n concepts.[3]\n  Most of these have not been critically edited, but early prints,\nrecent editions, and several modern translations are\n available.[4] \nSince most of Heytesbury’s logical views are spelled out either\nin the context or in terms of\n obligationes,[5]\n a brief note on these must be the starting point of their\npresentation. The most important passages are in\n[SCD] and [Soph] and to a certain\ndegree in [RSS]. Three problems will be introduced:\n1) the basic concepts, and in particular, relevance; 2) the\ndistinction between metaphysical and epistemic possibility; and 3) the\ndistinction between conceding a sentence and conceding that a sentence\nis true. \nHeytesbury’s obligationes are zero-sum and dynamic\nconsistency games participated by two players, an\n“opponent” and a “respondent”. The opponent\nposits a “casus” (ponitur casus), i.e.,\nthe initial linguistic and extra-linguistic assumptions, and proposes\nparticular sentences. The respondent admits or denies the\ncasus (admittitur, negatur casus) depending\non its consistency and concedes (concedo), negates\n(nego), or doubts (dubito) the proposed sentences,\nthe criteria being logical relations to either casus or to\nthe totality of preceding moves (including the casus).\nHeytesbury chooses the latter option, thus subscribing to so-called\n“antiqua responsio” (Read 2013: 20–23). The\nrespondent wins if he maintains consistency. \nSentences proposed to the respondent split into “relevant”\nor “irrelevant” depending on their logical relation to\npreceding moves. If the sentence proposed to the respondent or its\nnegation follows from preceding moves, it is relevant\n(pertinens) and should be either conceded (if implied by\nthese moves) or negated (if it is incompatible with them); otherwise,\nit is irrelevant (impertinens). An irrelevant sentence is\neither conceded, negated, or doubted depending on the\nrespondent’s knowledge about the “external” world;\nit is conceded if known to be actually true, negated if known to be\nactually false and doubted otherwise. Such a game is dynamic in the\nsense that the status of irrelevant sentences can change in the game\ncourse ([SCD] 1494: fol. 4ra–rb [1988a:\n432–433]). This can happen for two reasons. First, if the\nexternal world changes during the game, the respondent’s move\nwould change along with his new information state since the\nrespondent’s moves regarding irrelevant sentences depend on his\nknowledge of the external world ([SCD] 1494: fol.\n4rb [1988a: 433]). The second (and more interesting) case is brought\nabout by a particular game course. Heytesbury’s example is the\nfollowing game: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: The king is seated or you are in\nRome. \n[R1] I admit the casus. \nThe casus is possible. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: The king is seated. \n[R2] I doubt that. \nIrrelevant and not known to be true or false in the external world. \n[O3] PROPONITUR: You are in Rome. \n[R3] I negate that. \nIrrelevant and known to be false. \n[O4] PROPONITUR: The king is seated. \n[R4] I concede that. \nRelevant and implied by [R1] and\n[R3]. \n[R2] and [R4] are correct moves because [R1] and [R3] are. When\n“the king is seated” is proposed in [O2], it can only be\nrelevant with respect to [R1], which is not the case as\ndisjunctions do not entail their sub-formulas. If the respondent is\nunaware of the king’s whereabouts, the sentence must be doubted.\n“You are in Rome” proposed in [O3] is also irrelevant, but\ncan be negated as known to be false in the external world. At that\npoint, “the king is seated” becomes relevant and must be\nconceded as implied by “the king is seated or you are in\nRome” and the negation of “you are in Rome” via\ndisjunctive syllogism ([SCD] 1494: fol. 4rb [1988a:\n433–434]). \n\n Heytesbury\n considers three types of casus: a) possible; b) impossible\nbut imaginable; and c) impossible and unimaginable\n([Soph] soph. 18 and 31 [1494: fols. 131va–vb\nand 162va–vb]). The criteria of possibility, which probably\npertain to metaphysics, are not spelled out clearly. The criteria of\nimaginability are logical and epistemological: \nBriefly, every casus which is not explicitly inconsistent or\nimpossible in a way not easily imaginable (such as a man being a\ndonkey etc.) can be admitted for the sake of disputation. But first,\nthe respondent has to make the impossibility of such casus\nexplicit and emphasize that he has not admitted the casus as\npossible but merely as imaginable, to defend its implications (as\nimaginable, not as possible) and to negate what is incompatible with\nit in accord with his obligation. ([Soph] soph. 31\n[1494: fol. 162va–vb]) \nThe realm of the imaginable includes whatever is epistemically\nadmissible for either logical or epistemic reasons. Neither is purely\nobjective: what can and cannot be imagined seems player-relative, as\nis being “explicitly” inconsistent (for seeing or\noverlooking a contradiction is a matter of individual skill). Examples\nof the imaginable include the existence of a vacuum, infinite\nvelocities, expansions of physical objects, and men being immortal,\nbut not men being\n donkeys.[6]\n The criteria may be practical: certain hypotheses are not productive.\nSince the respondent’s goal is to maintain consistency,\naccepting overtly inconsistent assumptions is a\n nonstarter,[7]\n and certain impossibilities are such that nobody would agree to\ndefend them even for the sake of\n argument.[8]\n Defining admissibility in terms of imaginability makes\nobligationes into a framework for discussing\n“impossibilities” with applications in\n physics[9]\n as a science based on conceptual analysis and\n thought-experiments,[10]\n where the “secundum imaginationem” assumptions\nplay the same role as the modern day idealizations such as mass points\nor frictionless\n movement.[11] \nA principle utilized in Heytesbury’s solution to various\nparadoxes states that a proposed sentence is evaluated according to\nits standard meaning, even if it is assumed to signify something else\nin the casus. For instance, the following moves of the\nrespondent would be correct: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: “All mice are grey”\nsignifies that all cats are blue. All cats are white. \n[R1] I concede the casus. \nThe casus is possible. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: All mice are grey. \n[R2] I concede that. \nIrrelevant and known to be true in the external world. \n[O3] PROPONITUR: The sentence “all mice are\ngrey” is true. \n[R3] I negate that. \nRelevant and inconsistent with the casus. \nBy [R2], the respondent agrees that all mice are grey, while by [R3]\nhe denies that all cats are blue. To concede a sentence is to agree\nthat what the sentence signifies according to its standard meaning is\nthe case, but to concede that a certain sentence is true is to agree\nthat what the sentence signifies in the casus is the case.\nThese may or may not be the same depending on the casus.\n([SophAs]\n 412)[12] \n\n The genre of “proprietates\n terminorum” developed in the twelfth century alongside the\nreception of Aristotle’s Sophistical refutations, and a\nlogico-semantical analysis of fallacies seems to have been one of its\nprimary\n applications.[13]\n It is an umbrella genre for, among others, theories of meaning and\nreference, the use-mention distinction, quantification, and tense.\nThese are utilized in several of Heytesbury’s works with\nterminological variations. Three of these issues will be presented\nhere: the theories of “suppositio”,\n“mobilitatio”, and\n“ampliatio”. \nSupposition is a semantic relation between terms and the object(s)\nthey stand for in a sentential context. The modes of supposition are\nconnected to the way sentences can be analyzed (expositio),\nin particular, to the way general terms can be replaced by a\nstructured collection of subordinate terms, the so-called\n“descensus”. The following classifications of\nsuppositions can be reconstructed from Heytesbury’s\nwritings: \nMaterial supposition (“only you are a donkey” in\n“only you are a donkey is false”) consists in mentioning\nan expression ([SophAs] 403), whereas personal (or\nsignificative) supposition consists in using it\n([SophAs] 404). Discrete supposition is a personal\nsupposition of a singular term ([SophAs]\n 390);[14]\n its complement is usually called “common” supposition and\nis further divided into determinate and confused suppositions.\nDeterminate supposition is exemplified by the supposition of\n“human” in “some human is an animal”\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 3va [1988a: 427]), connected to the\ndescensus, whereby it can be paraphrased as “this human\nis an animal or that human is an animal etc.”\n([SophAs] 387). Merely confused or non-distributive\nsupposition is exemplified by the supposition of “animal”\nin “every human is an animal” and connected to\n“disjunctive” descensus ([SCD]\n1494, fol. 2va–vb [1988a: 420–421]; [Soph]\nsoph. 7 [1494: fol. 106rb] and soph. 16 (1494: fol. 127vb)), whereby\nit can be paraphrased as “every man is this animal or that\nanimal etc.” Confused and distributive suppositions are most\ntypically exemplified by the supposition of “human” in\n“every human is an animal”, connecting the\ndescensus to every instance of the common term, whereby it\ncan be paraphrased as “this human is an animal and that human is\nan animal etc.” ([SCD] 1494: fol. 2va–vb\n[1988a: 420–421]; [Soph] soph. 7 [1494: fol.\n106rb] and soph. 16 [1494: fol. 127vb]). \nThe theory of suppositio is extended by the theory of\n“mobility” and “immobility”. If a particular\nmode of descensus is admissible, that type of supposition is\ncalled “mobile” (mobilis); otherwise it is called\n“immobile”\n (immobilis).[15]\n Heytesbury’s example of immobile supposition is the function of\n“penny” in “I promise you a penny” or\n“human” in “by necessity, every man is an\nanimal” ([PC] 1494: fol. 188vb;\n[IHT] arg. 19; [SophAs] 398). \nNote that: First, the so-called “simple”\n(“human” in “human is a species”) supposition\nis\n omitted.[16]\n Second, Heytesbury’s analysis of predicates in terms of the\nmerely confused supposition is nominalist, as opposed to the realist\nanalysis of these examples in terms of standing for an abstract\n object.[17]\n Third, Heytesbury endorses the Aristotelian sensus\ncompositus-sensus divisus distinction, rather than the\nterminist framework in cases where that would be\n appropriate.[18] \nLastly, Heytesbury introduces the so-called\n“ampliatio”, which consist in extending the range\nof a term to non-actual entities, such as entities in the past,\nfuture, or mere possibilia. Thus, for instance, the proper paraphrase\nof the sentence “a white thing can be black” is\n“something that now is white or can be white can be black”\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 2va [1988a:\n 418]).[19]\n The complementary property is called\n“restrictio” ([Soph] soph. 4\n[1494: fol. 89vb]). \n\n The basic textual evidence for\n Heytesbury’s theory of deductive validity includes\n[IHT], [Soph] and [RSS]. \n[IHT] is a collection of arguments for both the\nvalidity and invalidity of spurious inferences. Typically, the\npro-arguments construe them as instances of formal inference rules\n(bona et formalis), the contra-arguments argue that they are\nnot valid (non valet), and the resolutions show that the\ninference under scrutiny is not a genuine instance of such a rule.\nThis method presupposes that deductive validity is ultimately\ntruth-preservation (an inference is valid if its consequent cannot be\nfalse while its antecedent is true or if its antecedent is\nincompatible with the negation of the consequent)\n([IHT] arg. 6). The criterion is that it is not\npossible to present a counterexample, i.e., a possible (obligational)\nsituation (casu possibili posito) verifying the antecedent\nand falsifying the consequent ([IHT] arg. 2). The\nmethod also presupposes that the underlying inference rules are\nassumed to be legitimate but misapplied in such sophisms as to require\nelucidation, and not revision. The treatise is mostly concerned with\nthe analysis of logical form (expositio) of sentences\ncontaining operators (officialia) such as “only”,\n“nothing but”, “begins”, “ceases”,\netc., with a few applications of modal and epistemic logic. \n[IHT] introduces the distinction between the\n“universal” (bona et formalis generaliter) and\n“restricted” (bona et formalis specialiter)\nformal validity: \nAn inference is formally valid in the universal sense if the opposite\nof its consequent is formally incompatible with its antecedent and a\nsimilar form [of argument] holds in all applications (consimilis\nforma valet in omni materia) (…) An inference is\n[formally] valid in the restricted sense if the opposite of its\nconsequent is formally incompatible with its antecedent, but not every\nsuch application is valid. ([IHT] arg. 11) \nThe concept of formal compatibility is not explicitly introduced in\nthis context. \n[Soph] relates the relevance view of formality as a\nconceptual connection between premises and conclusions to the\nsubstitutional view of formality as validity under any substitution of\nextra-logical terms or in any domain of application (in omni\nmateria). If an inference is valid only in a restricted domain of\napplication, it is valid based on content or in a particular domain of\napplication (de materia, gratia materiae) or\n“simply valid” (bona simpliciter)\n([IHT] arg. 11; [Soph] soph. 3\n[1494: fol. 86ra]). The concept of formal incompatibility is clarified\nas part of the explication of validity based upon the form (de\nforma): \nIt is commonly agreed that such inference is not valid based upon the\nform, because the opposite of its consequent and its antecedent do not\nformally imply a contradiction, where “to imply a contradiction\nformally” means that these two cannot be distinguished or\nconsistently and distinctively imagined as holding simultaneously.\n([Soph] soph. 2 [1494: fol. 83rb]) \nAs opposed to testing simple validity against possible counter-models,\nformal validity is tested against impossible but imaginable\ncounter-models to eliminate extra-linguistic influences. Imaginable\ncasus introduced in obligationes are thereby\nutilized as part of general logic. \nFinally, a “necessary” inference is one which can be\nreduced to a categorical or hypothetical syllogism via a necessary\nauxiliary assumption or “middle” (per medium\nnecessarium) ([Soph] soph. 2 [1494: fol. 83rb]).\nSimilarly, two sentences are assumed to be logically equivalent\n(convertantur) if they imply each other formally via a\nnecessary middle ([RSS] 1494: fol. 15rb–va\n[1988b:\n 461–462]).[20]\n This represents the view of validity as reducibility to\nparadigmatically valid\n syllogisms.[21] \nIn general, Heytesbury introduces three levels of\n validity.[22]\n First, validity as relevance secured by logical form in every domain\nof application, explicated as truth-preservation of all inferences\nsharing the same logical form (forma or modus\narguendi) with respect to every imaginable world. Second,\nvalidity as relevance secured by conceptual content with a restricted\ndomain of application, explicated as truth-preservation with respect\nto all imaginable worlds, which is not substitution-invariant. Third,\nvalidity as simple truth-preservation with respect to all possible\nworlds. Heytesbury’s parallel use of different concepts of\nformality makes him a representative of British logic in the\ntransition period, containing different stages of development: the\nsubstitutional view (validity preserved in all substitution-instances)\ntypical for the “Continental tradition”, the relevance\nview (conceptual connection) typical for the “British\ntradition” and later Paul of Venice and Paul of Pergula, and\nformality as reducibility to a syllogism typical for the early\nfourteenth-century\n tradition.[23] \nHeytesbury’s analysis of epistemic statements encompasses the\nlogical analysis of epistemic statements, inference rules for\nsentences containing epistemic operators, and rules for obligational\ngames with epistemic statements, most of which are applied to\nsolutions to\n sophisms[24]\n and instructions for obligational games. The underlying principles\npertaining to the logical analysis of language and inference rules for\nepistemic statements will be addressed\n below.[25] \nLet us consider the following two sentences:  \n(dr), called “sensus divisus” by Heytesbury,\ndenotes that there is a person (who happens to be Socrates) of whom I\ncorrectly know that he is running in Beaumont, but about whom I may or\nmay not know that he is Socrates; his kinematics, but not his\nidentity, is part of my belief. On the other hand, according to (dd),\ncalled “sensus compositus” by Heytesbury, I know\nthat it is Socrates who is running in Beaumont. Hence if I believed\nthat Socrates died years ago, (dr) could be true but (dd) would be\nfalse ([SCD] 1494: fol. 3va [1988a: 427] and\n[RSS] 1494, fol. 13rb and [1988b:\n 444]).[26]\n By strictly endorsing the Aristotelian framework and analyzing\nepistemic contexts in terms of the de re/de dicto\nambiguity, Heytesbury does not participate in the fourteenth-century\ndevelopments in the logical analysis of\n language.[27]\n Also, his criteria for distinguishing between the two readings are\npurely syntactic, whereby scholastic Latin is viewed as an artificial\nlanguage with strict formation\n rules.[28] \nHeytesbury’s remarks on the “common interpretation of\nknowledge” emphasize that a firm and unhesitant belief does not\nconstitute knowledge unless it is veridical, which results in the\nformulation “to know is nothing other than unhesitatingly to\napprehend the truth—i.e., to believe unhesitatingly that it is\nso when it is so in reality” ([RSS] 1494: fol.\n13vb [1988b:\n 447]).[29]\n This implies the veracity of knowledge, formally (where\n“\\(K(\\xi,X)\\)” abbreviates “the agent \\(\\xi\\) knows\nthat X”): \nThe introspection axioms govern iterated epistemic modalities (Boh\n1984 and 1985). While denying the possibility of doubting one’s\nown knowledge, Heytesbury proposes positive introspection: \nThis principle is spelled out in terms of the definienda of knowledge:\nif an agent perceives something unhesitatingly and pays attention to\nwhether he does or does not perceive it, he also perceives that he\nperceives it, for both the first and second-order knowledge are based\non the same evidence ([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b:\n447–448]). Heytesbury also holds the contraposition of (4)\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b: 448]): \nIn the context of (T), Heytesbury discusses the casus where\nan agent sees a person who looks exactly like a king, but is not one.\nThe agent can believe the man to be a king beyond any doubt and even\nbelieve himself to know that. But, by (T), he knows neither that the\nman is a king (because that is not true), nor that the man is not a\nking (because he does not believe that) ([RSS] 1494:\nfol. 13vb [1988b: 447]). Even though Heytesbury doesn’t\nexplicitly say so, it seems natural to assume that this agent\ndoesn’t know that he failed to know that man is a king. Hence he\nfails to know something, but also, presumably, fails to know that he\nfails to know it, which is a counter-example to negative\nintrospection: \nAccepting (4) while denying (5) is based on Heytesbury’s\ninterpretation of knowledge as an evidence-based act of considering\nsomething and apprehending its factuality: the absence of knowledge\nalone does not constitute conscious ignorance. \nHeytesbury’s account of the closure properties of knowledge\nencompasses the closure of meaning under entailment, the distribution\nof knowledge over implication, and the distribution of knowledge over\nsignification. \nFirst, Heytesbury introduces the concept of implied meaning\n(significare ex consequenti) and believes that sentential\nmeaning is closed under entailment. As he explains the different\nsenses of “signifying precisely” (significare\nprecise), he claims that a sentence cannot signify something\nprecisely in the sense of not signifying anything else. Instead,\n“to signify precisely” means that a sentence has a\n“primary meaning” (“significat primo et\nprincipaliter” or “significatio primaria et\nadequata”) plus whatever its primary meaning entails\n(quod sequitur ipsam significantem quod ita sit), but nothing\nelse ([RSS] 1494: fol. 15ra–rb [1988b:\n 459–460]).[31]\n To allow that, Heytesbury’s semantics must validate the\nfollowing principle (where “\\(\\textrm{sig}(x,X)\\)”\nabbreviates “x signifies that X”): \nSecond, Heytesbury denies outright logical omniscience, i.e., the\nclosure of knowledge under implication: \nbut agrees with the distribution of knowledge over implication, i.e.,\nthat knowledge is closed under known inferences (the “axiom\nK”) ([CO] soph. 2): \nThird, if an agent knows that it is completely the case as a sentence\nsignifies, does he know that everything it signifies is the\n case?[34]\n The problem of conceding a sentence whose meaning is deductively\nclosed by an agent with a finite cognitive capacity is solved by\nintroducing a distinction parallel to (K) and (O)\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 15rb [1988b: 460]); Heytesbury\ndenies: \nbut holds: \nTogether with “strong” semantic closure,\nHeytesbury’s analysis of epistemic operators validates the\n“weaker” distribution principles and rejects the\n“stronger” closure principles, i.e., different forms of\nlogical\n omniscience.[35] \nHeytesbury analyzes insolubilia or self-referential paradoxes\nmost thoroughly in the first chapter of\n [RSS],[36]\n where he dismisses three alternative solutions to paradoxes to settle\nfor the fourth. The first three positions agree that paradoxical\nsentences can have precisely their standard meaning. According to the\nfirst position held by Roger Swyneshed, paradoxical sentences are\nfalse because they imply their own falsity, and a sentence and its\nnegation can be false at the same time if one of them is paradoxical\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 4va and 6rb [1979: 18–19 and\n45]). According to the second position, paradoxical sentences do not\nmake genuine statements, hence are neither true nor false\n([RSS] 1494: fols. 4va–vb [1979: 19]). That is\nreminiscent of the so-called “cassantes” who\nclaim that paradoxical sentences fail to make a true or false\nstatement (literally “say nothing”) (de Rijk 1966), available, for instance,\nthrough Burley or Bradwardine (Roure 1970; Bradwardine B-I. Heytesbury\nalso could have viewed the second position as the interpretation of\nBradwardine’s “mediantes”, who claims that\nparadoxical sentences are neither true nor false, but of a\n“middle\n value”.[37]\n According to the third position, paradoxical sentences are\neither-true-or-false but neither true nor false; they make genuine\nstatements, but fail to have a standard truth-value\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 4vb [1979: 19–20]). \nAccording to the fourth position, paradoxical sentences have their\nstandard meaning, but say more than what their overt meanings\nindicate. It is based on the definitions of a paradoxical\ncasus and a paradoxical sentence. There are two versions of\nthese definitions, differing in the last clause: \nA paradoxical casus is one in which mention is made of some\nsentence such that if in the same casus that sentence\nsignifies precisely as its words commonly pretend, from its being true\nfollows that it is false, and vice versa. ([RSS]\n1494: fol. 6rb [1979: 47]) \nor: \n…it follows that it is true and also false. (Pozzi 1987:\n236) \nFurthermore: \nA paradoxical sentence is one of which mention is made in a\nparadoxical casus, such that if in the same casus it\nsignifies precisely as its words commonly pretend, then from its being\ntrue follows that it is false, and vice versa ([RSS]\n1494: fol. 6rb [1979: 47]). \nor: \n…it follows that it is true and also false. (Pozzi 1987:\n 236)[38] \nThe solution to paradoxes is exemplified by the casus, where\nSocrates only pronounces the sentence “Socrates is saying\nsomething false”, henceforth labelled (s). Five elementary\nsettings differ in assumptions concerning its meaning: \nFor Heytesbury, “to solve a paradox” is to instruct the\nrespondent in the corresponding obligatio-game. His\ninstructions are as follows: \nThe corresponding moves are: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s). \n[R1] I admit the casus. \nThe casus is possible. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: (s) is false. \n[R2] ??? \nIrrelevant and ??? \nHeytesbury applies his view of obligationes: in the absence\nof any other assumptions, (s) is initially irrelevant. As such, if\nproposed as the first sentence in the game, the respondent’s\nmove cannot be affected by either the casus or the previous\nmoves, but must follow the respondent’s knowledge about the\nexternal world. Heytesbury’s emphasis on the stage of the game\nsuggests that this can change due to the dynamic character of\nobligationes. \nThe corresponding moves are: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s) and (s)\nsignifies precisely that (s) is false \n[R1] I do not admit the casus. \nThe casus is inconsistent. \nSince obligationes are consistency-maintenance games, the\nonly non-losing strategy for a respondent is not to start such a game,\nfor otherwise he would be dragged into inconsistency via the\nwell-known paradoxical reasoning. \nThe corresponding moves are: \nopponent’s moves \nrespondent’s moves \njustification \n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s) and (s)\nsignifies that (s) is false \n[R1] I admit the casus. \nThe casus is consistent. \n[O2] PROPONITUR: (s) is false. \n[R2] I concede that. \nImplied by the casus. \n[O3] PROPONITUR: “(s) is false” is\ntrue. \n[R3] I deny that. \nIncompatible with the casus. \nThe justification of [R2] is not clearly explained in\n[RSS]. A minimalist interpretation is that the\nproposed sentence is implied by [R1] via reductio: If (s) is\nfalse, then it is false (trivially); if (s) is not false, it is true,\nand then it is the case as it signifies, hence it is false. Either\nway, it is false, hence it is\n false.[39]\n An obligational explanation is that (s) is regarded as relevant in\nthis casus, and as such can only be conceded or denied. Since\nits denial implies an inconsistency, such a move must be avoided in a\nconsistency-maintenance game, therefore it should be conceded. Since\nthe casus has been admitted as consistent, it cannot validate\nan inconsistent move, hence it must validate its opposite. By the same\nreasoning, it is possible to deny that (s) is true. Furthermore,\nHeytesbury refuses to certify the additional meaning of (s)\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 6va [1979: 49–50]).\nUnsatisfactory as this may seem, it is legitimate from the point of\nview of obligationes: meaning certification is not a move\navailable to the respondent, and since the instructions are\nrespondent-oriented, the actual meaning of (s) is an external\nproblem. \n(2.31) and (2.32) are dealt with along the same lines. \nFor Heytesbury, paradoxes are obligational games with self-referential\n sentences.[40]\n However, his criticism of alternative solutions is part of the\nfourteenth-century developments relating paradoxes to general\nlogico-semantical\n issues.[41]\n He views his approach as relatively defensible and probable, but\nadmits that he cannot solve all objections and considers a completely\nsatisfactory solution to paradoxes impossible (unfortunately without a\njustification). Without too much self-confidence, he closes his\ntreatise by saying that young students should move past the topic and\ndo something useful. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 4vb and 7rb\n[1979: 21 and 58]) \nHeytesbury’s treatise Regule solvendi sophismata may be\ntaken as representative of Oxford Calculators’s\nspeculative/mathematical physics. It links interests in logic,\nmathematics, and physics. As Curtis Wilson says: “Heytesbury\nemploys the concept of “limit” and “infinite\naggregate” with considerable precision and subtlety; and in\ntreating of variable physics quantities, he approaches the ideal of a\npurely mathematical description” (Wilson 1960: 3). Not only does\nHeytesbury analyze physical and mathematical problems by means of the\ntechniques of the logica moderna, but he also employs\nphysical and mathematical rules in the analyses of logical or semantic\nproblems of denomination. Heytesbury is mostly interested in the\nproblem of determining under what conditions a subject can be\ndenominated such-and-such, e.g., “white” or\n“running”. The issue of denomination arises because the\nattributes of subjects vary in degrees of intensity or completeness.\nHe establishes sets of rules of everyday speech, determining how we\ndenominate a subject under all imaginable circumstances of change. For\nexample, in sophism Omnis homo qui est albus currit, he\nconcludes that a man is called to be “white” if and only\nif the external surface of the upper half of him is white (in everyday\nspeech, a man is white if the skin of his face is white) (Wilson 1960:\n22–23). \nLike one of the founders of the School of Oxford\nCalculators—Richard Kilvington– Heytesbury takes\nOckham’s nominalist position and affirms that the real physical\nworld consists only of res absolutae, i.e., substances and\nqualities. They both acknowledge that terms such as\n“point”, “line”,\n“latitude”, and “degree” do\nnot have any representation in reality, but are useful for describing\ndifferent types of change. They also hold that time is not real since\ntime is not distinguished realiter from the motion of\ncelestial sphere, and motion not distinguished realiter from\nthe body which moves. Thus, they both contrast things that are really\ndistinct with things distinguishable only in reason, i.e., in the\nimagination. Heytesbury follows Kilvington’s frequent use of the\nphrase secundum imaginationem. Imaginary cases are\ndescriptions of hypothetical situations; the elements of the\ndescription, and not the situation itself, are of primary concern. The\nonly requirement for an imaginable case is that it should not involve\na formal logical contradiction; whether it is physically possible or\nnot is a matter of indifference. As Wilson says,  \na distinction is drawn between realiter or\nnaturaliter or physice loquendo and logice\nor sophistice loquendo: physice we follow experience\nand the principles laid down in the natural philosophy of Aristotle;\nlogice or sophistice we are free to introduce\nwhatever distinctions and cases are convenient and imaginable. (Wilson\n1960: 25) \nHeytesbury, however, remains in the framework of Aristotelian\nphilosophy of nature, and the problems he discusses are to be found in\nAristotle’s Physica and De caelo.\nNevertheless, Heytesbury is captivated by the mathematical approach\nlike former Oxford Calculators were. Like Thomas Bradwardine and\nRichard Kilvington, he examines physical problems using mathematical\napparatus. In Chapters 4–6 of the Regulae, Heytesbury\ndevelops the measurement by limit, i.e., by the first and last\ninstants of the beginning and ending, and by the intrinsic and\nextrinsic limits of passive and active capacities. Although these type\nof “measuring” do not appear to be straightforwardly\nmathematical, it raises mathematical considerations and give\noutstanding results in analyses of the instantaneous in motion and\ntime, as well as analyses of the continuum. As Wilson states:  \n“Heytesbury admits “according to the common mode of\nspeech” that everything which is, whether time or motion or\ninstant, is in an instant, in the sense that it is instantaneously\nmeasured by an instant […] the instant in time and the\ninstantaneous position in movement are always to be regarded as\n“limits”. (Wilson 1960: 41)  \nThe second type of measurement employs a new calculus of compounding\nratios. The third type of measurement, by latitude of forms, describes\nmotion, in which an accidental form, such as speed, is intensified or\ndiminished. He focuses on establishing the rules for uniform and\ndifform local motion, alteration, and augmentation. He is centered on\nthe possible measure of the speed of such motions by the effect\nproduced during equal length of time. Thus, he is interested in the\nkinematical aspect of motion (Ideo viso iam generaliter penes quid\ntamquam quo ad effectum attendatur velocitas in motu locali, quia\nsecundum proportionem potentie motoris ad potentiam resistivam\ngeneraliter attenditur velocitas in quocumque motu tamquam quo ad eius\ncausam) ([RSS] 1494: fol. 44rb). \nIn chapter IV of the Regulae (De incipit et desinit)\nHeytesbury poses and analyzes in great detail cases in which any\nthing, process, or state may be said to begin or cease to be. He\nbegins with possible expositions of the terms “beginning”\n(incipere) and “ceasing” (desinere) in a\nway that uncovers certain paradoxical properties of the temporal\ncontinuum. “Beginning” may be expounded by\npositio of the present (i.e., by the positing of existence in\nthe present instant) and remotio of the past (i.e., by denial\nof existence in the past), meaning that in the present instant a thing\nor a process is, and immediately prior to the present instant it was\nnot. “Beginning” may be also expounded by remotio\nof the present and positio of the future, meaning that in the\npresent instant a thing or a process is not, and immediately after the\npresent instant it will be. Likewise, “ceasing” may be\nexpounded in two ways, either by remotio of the present and\npositio of the past, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is not, and immediately prior to the present\ninstant it was, or by positio of the present and\nremotio of the future, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is, and immediately after the present instant it\nwill not be. Heytesbury offers a number of sophisms involving the\nlimit-decision. One of them is particularly interesting since it\nclearly exhibits Heytesbury’s remarkable skill in solving\nproblems of instantaneous motion and time without symbolic techniques\nof the calculus. Heytesbury poses a case in which both Plato and\nSocrates begin to move from rest at the same instant, but Plato starts\nto move with a constant acceleration and Socrates with an acceleration\nwhich starts at zero degree and increases uniformly with time. He\nconcludes that “both Socrates and Plato infinitely slowly begin\nto be moved, and yet Socrates infinitely more slowly begins to be moved\nthan Plato” (Wilson 1960: 54, [RSS] 1494: fol. 26vb).\nAs Wilson proves, the\nconclusion is an effect of comparison of two infinitesimals of\ndifferent order.  \nIn the case under consideration both the velocity of Plato (\\(v_p\\))\nand the velocity of Socrates (\\(v_s\\)) are infinitesimal for time\nt approaching zero. Two infinitesimals are said to be of\ndifferent order if the limit of their quotient is either zero or\ninfinite. In the case under consideration the limit of the quotient\n\\(v_p/v_s\\) as \\(t\\rightarrow 0\\) is infinite. (Wilson 1960: 55) \nIn chapter V of the Regulae, Heytesbury considers the limits\nof capacities, and he applies the limit-concept to the bounding of the\nranges of variables and aggregates. All capacities are sorted as\nactive or passive. An active capacity (force) is measured against the\npassive capacity (resistance) which it can overcome. If an active\ncapacity can overcome some resistance, it can overcome less. For\nexample, if Socrates can lift one hundred pounds, he can lift fifty\npounds. Conversely, if a passive capacity can be affected by less, it\ncan be affected by greater. For example, if Socrates can see a grain\nof millet from the distance of a mile, he will be able to see the\nChurch at the same distance. The boundaries of capacities are of two\nkinds: an intrinsic boundary (when an element is a member of the\nsequence of elements it bounds: maximum quod sic, minimum quod\nsic) and an extrinsic boundary (when an element which serves as a\nboundary stands outside the range of elements which it bounds:\nmaximum quod non, minimum quod non). From the definitions of\nactive and passive capacities, it follows that the boundary of an\nactive capacity must be assigned either by the affirmation of the\nmaximum (maximum quod sic) or by the negation of the minimum\n(minimum quod non); the boundary of a passive capacity is\nassigned either by the affirmation of the minimum (minimum quod\nsic) or by the negation of the maximum (maximum quod\nnon). \nHeytesbury sets the following conditions which must be obtained for\nlimits to exist: (1) There must be a range in which the capacity can\nact or be acted upon, and another range in which it cannot act or be\nacted upon, and not both; (2) Each capacity should only be able to\ntake a value in the range on which it is measured from zero and the\nvalue which serves as its boundary. Thus, if an active capacity is\ncapable of acting upon a given passive capacity in the range, it must\nbe capable of acting upon any less, and if it is not capable of acting\nupon a given passive capacity, it is not capable of acting upon any\ngreater. Conversely, if a passive capacity is capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it must be capable of being acted upon by any\nagent of greater strength, and if it is not capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it is not capable of being acted upon by a\nweaker agent; and (3) Infinite capacities like the infinite power of\nGod are excluded from the discussion, since no termination can be\nassigned for them ([RSS] 1494: fol.\n29va–vb). \nHeytesbury, like Kilvington, classifies all capacities as mutable or\nimmutable. A mutable capacity is capable of more and less, and both\naffirmative and negative parts of the division might be assigned. For\nexample, with respect to Socrates, a mutable power of lifting (an\nactive capacity) a minimum quod non is assigned. For a\npassive capacity the maximum quod non is assigned, e.g., a\nmaximum visible body which cannot be seen at a given distance. An\nimmutable capacity acts in a determinate way, so it produces the only\none effect it actually produces. Therefore, the affirmative part of\nthe division is always assigned as a boundary for immutable capacity.\nThus, e.g., there is a maximum distance which, ceteris\nparibus, Socrates can traverse in an hour by a speed which\nincreases uniformly from A to B degree ([RSS] 1494:\nfol. 29vb; Wilson 1960: 73). \nChapter VI (De tribus praedicamentis) of the Regulae\ndeals with motion in three categories: place, quantity, and quality.\nThe first part (de motu locali) deals with the quickness or\nslowness in uniformly or difformly accelerated and decelerated motion\nconsidered in its kinematical aspect. The second part (de\nvelocitate motus augmentationis) deals with augmentation\nunderstood as pure increase in size, and more specifically with the\nspeed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced, i.e., by\nspace traversed in time. The third part (de velocitate motus\nalterationis) is concentrated on mathematical description of\nvariation of intensity in space and time. The prime purpose to be\nachieved in this chapter is to establish definitions of speed in the\nthree categories of motion. All debated cases are posed secundum\nimaginationem. \nLocal motions are grouped into two classes: uniform and difform. A\nuniform motion is motion in which equal spaces are traversed\ncontinually in equal parts of time. Difform motions can vary in\ninfinite ways, both with respect to the magnitude or the subject\nmoved, and with respect to time. Difform motion with respect to the\nsubject moved is motion in which different points of the body move\nwith unequal speeds; for instance, a rolling wheel moves with difform\nmotion since different points on the wheel vary in regard to distance\nfrom the axis of rotation. Difform motion with respect to time is\nmotion in which unequal spaces are traversed in equal times. Motion\ncan also be difform with respect to both time and the subject moved.\nDifform motions are subdivided into two classes: the uniformly difform\nmotion and the difformly difform motion. Uniformly difform motion is\nmotion in which the speed either increases or decreases uniformly,\nthat is, a motion in which in any equal parts of time, equal latitudes\nof speed are either acquired or lost. A difformly difform motion is\nmotion in which a greater latitude of velocity is gained or lost in\none part of time than in another equal to it. \nThe most gripping example of uniformly difform motion is accelerated\nmotion, like a motion of a body moving towards the earth. Heytesbury\ngives a general rule, called Mean Speed Theorem, by which we may\ncalculate the distance traversed from the latitude of speed uniformly\nacquired. He makes use of this theorem to both accelerate and\ndecelerate motions. According to this rule, the distance traversed by\na uniformly accelerated body in a given time is equal to the distance\nwhich would be traversed in the same time in a uniform motion with its\nmean speed (half of the sum of the initial and final speed). A number\nof conclusions follow from this theorem: \nIn concluding the chapter, Heytesbury states that an infinite number\nof sophisms can be made concerning speed in local motion, as well as\nintension and remission of such speed (Infinita possunt fieri\nsophismata de velocitate motus localis et de comparatione unius motus\nad alium, et de comparatione intensionis ad remissionem motus et\nconiungendo latitudinem motus intensionis et remissionis cum\nlatitudine velocitatis ([RSS] 1494: fols.\n44rb–44va)). \nHeytesbury presents the same concern with quantitative description of\nhypothetical cases in the subchapter dealing with qualitative change.\nHe takes part in the debate over one of the most widely discussed\nproblems in the fourteenth-century philosophy of nature focused on the\npossible “measure” of the intension and remission of\nforms. Like most of the Oxford Calculators, Heytesbury accepts\nScotus’s and Ockham’s addition theory and assumes that the\nintension of form is the result of adding qualitative parts. As an\nOckhamist, Heytesbury emphasizes that the term “motion” in\nalteration connotes nothing else than the degrees or latitude of\nquality that are successively acquired. A basic assumption is that\nqualitative intensity is a certain kind of linearly ordered and\nadditive quantity. Thus, as in the case of local motion, Heytesbury\ndivides the latitudes of motion of alteration into the latitude of\nmotion of intension and the latitude of motion of remission; and the\nlatitude of the latitude of motion into the latitude of the\nacquisition of the latitude of motion and the latitude of the loss of\nlatitude of motion. In modern terminology, these latitudes correspond\nto latitudes of speed and of acceleration and deceleration,\nrespectively. Since there is no limit to speeds of alteration nor to\nrates of acceleration or deceleration of that speed, those latitudes\nare all infinite. \nHeytesbury presents three different ways of “measuring”\nthe speed of alteration in which intensity of a quality varies form\none point to another, or from instant to instant of time, or from\npoint to point of the moving body: (1) by the degree (gradus)\ninduced (a subject is considered to be altered faster when a higher\ndegree is induced); (2) by the latitude of form acquired in comparison\nto the size of the subject (the speed of alteration is proportionally\ngreater in a larger body); and (3) by the latitude acquired in a given\ntime, without regard to size of the subject undergoing alteration.\nHeytesbury holds the third position and claims that as in the case of\nlocal motion, the speed of alteration is to be measured at the point\nof the body where the rate of change is most rapid, that is, where the\nmaximum latitude of form is acquired ([RSS] 1494:\nfol. 51ra). \nHeytesbury deals with augmentation as with pure increase in size,\nwhich is the same process as rarefaction; more precisely, he deals\nwith the speed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced.\nThere are three ways of “measuring” the speed of\naugmentation acquired in time: (1) by the maximum quantity acquired;\n(2) by the latitude of rarity or rareness; and (3) by the ratio of new\nsize to previous size ([RSS] 1494: fol. 60rb). He\nholds the third position, according to which the ratios correspond to\ndifferent degrees of augmentation. Augmentation, like the two other\nmotions, can be uniform or difform. An augmentation is uniform if in\nequal intervals of time, the body undergoing augmentation increases in\nsize by the same ratio. While discussing the above mentioned\npositions, Heytesbury makes broad use of the new calculus of ratios\ninvented by Kilvington and Bradwardine. \nAs a logician, Heytesbury strongly influenced logic in fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century Britain, and there is a notable fifteenth and early\nsixteenth-century reception in Italy where multiple editions of his\ncommentaries on [RSS] and [SCD] were\nprinted (Ashworth & Spade 1992; de Rijk 1975, 1977). As of now,\nonly the influence of his insolubilia-treatise is\nparticularly well-documented. Despite his dismissive attitude toward\nthis genre, Heytesbury’s treatise is one of the most influential\nlate medieval texts. These influences include the British logical\ntradition (see Pironet 2008), the Italian logical\n tradition,[42]\n and John Mair’s\n circle,[43]\n and the treatise is referred to even as late as 1688 (De Benedictis\n1688: 580–590; for other influence, see Spade 1989: 273).\nHeytesbury’s catalogue of solutions to the paradoxes, where the\npositions are (correctly or not) attributed to fourteenth-century\nBritish logicians, is further developed and sometimes defended against\nHeytesbury’s harsh and sarcastic dismissal. (R2.2) is developed\nby extending the proof and supplemented by saying that paradoxical\nsentences (or all sentences, for that matter) signify their own truth.\nAs a philosopher, Heytesbury significantly influenced later Oxford\nCalculators: John Dumbleton, anonymous author of Tractatus de sex\ninconvenientibus, Richard Swineshead, author of one of the most\nfamous treatise Liber Calculationum, and continental\nfourteenth and fifteenth-century philosophers, e.g., John Casali, John\nof Holland, Petrus of Mantua, Cajetan of Thiene, Giovanni Marliani,\nand Paul of Venice (see Wilson 1960: 25–28). The Mean Speed\nTheorem was widely discussed during the fourteenth and fifteenth\ncenturies, and later played an important role in the formulation of\nthe law of free fall (see Damerow et al. 1992: 161–200,\nesp. 232–236).","contact.mail":"ejung@uni.lodz.pl","contact.domain":"uni.lodz.pl"}]
