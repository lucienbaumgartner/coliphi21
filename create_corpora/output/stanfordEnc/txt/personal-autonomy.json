But what is a\nself-governing agent?  Governing oneself is no guarantee that one will\nhave a greater range of options in the future, or the sort of\nopportunities one most wants to have.  Since, moreover, a person can\ngovern herself without being able to appreciate the difference between\nright and wrong, it seems that an autonomous agent can do something\nwrong without being to blame for her action. What, then, are the\nnecessary and sufficient features of this self-relation?  Philosophers\nhave offered a wide range of competing answers to this question.\n\n\n\nWhen people living in some region of the world declare that their\ngroup has the right to live autonomously, they are saying that they\nought to be allowed to govern themselves. In making this claim, they\nare, in essence, rejecting the political and legal authority of those\nnot in their group. They are insisting that whatever power these\noutsiders may have over them, this power is illegitimate; they, and\nthey alone, have the authority to determine and enforce the rules and\npolicies that govern their lives. \n\nWhen an individual makes a similar declaration about some sphere of\nher own life, she, too, is denying that anyone else has the authority\nto control her activity within this sphere; she is saying that any\nexercise of power over this activity is illegitimate unless she\nauthorizes it herself. Most of the reasons that can be offered in\nsupport of this claim have correlates in the case of demands for group\nautonomy. But there is one very important exception: a reason that\ntakes us beyond politics, to the metaphysics of agency. \n\nAn agent is one who acts. In order to act, one must initiate one’s\naction. And one cannot initiate one’s action without exercising one’s\npower to do so. Since nothing and no one has the power to act except\nthe agent herself, she alone is entitled to exercise this power, if she\nis entitled to act. This means that insofar as someone is an agent,\ni.e., insofar as she is one who acts—she is correct to regard\nher own commitments to acting, her own judgments and decisions about\nhow she should act, as authoritative. Indeed, if she were to challenge\nthe authority that is an essential feature of her judgments and\ndecisions, then they would cease to be her own practical conclusions.\nTheir power to move her would cease to be a manifestation of her power\nto move herself; it would not be the power of her own agency. \n\nIn short, every agent has an authority over herself that is\ngrounded, not in her political or social role, nor in any law or\ncustom, but in the simple fact that she alone can initiate her actions.\nTo be sure, it might be unwise for someone to follow the commands she\ngives to herself when she “makes up her mind.” The point,\nhowever, is that she has no conceivable option. In order to form an\nintention to do one thing rather than another, an agent must regard her\nown judgment about how to act as authoritative—even if it is\nonly the judgment that she should follow the command or advice of\nsomeone else. This tight connection between being an agent and having\nauthority has no correlate in cases where the authority at issue is\npolitical. Anyone can coherently (and often plausibly) challenge the\npolitical authority of some individual or group. Even a political\nleader herself can with good reason believe that her political power is\nillegitimate, and that exercising this power is unjustified. \n\nDespite the special inalienable nature of our authority over\nourselves, it is possible for us to fail to govern ourselves, just as\nit is possible for a political leader to fail to govern those who fall\nwithin her domain. Indeed, precisely because our authority over our own\nactions is an intrinsic feature of our agency, our deference to this\nauthority is but the form of self-government. It is no guarantee that\nwhenever we act, the forces that move us owe their power to\nour power to decide what to do. Just as a political leader’s\nofficial status is compatible with her having no real power to call the\nshots, so too, a person can have an authoritative status with respect\nto her motives without having any real power over them. Though it is an\nagent’s job to determine how she will act, she can do this job without\nreally being in control. Of course, no one can govern herself without\nbeing subject to influences whose power does not derive from her own\nauthority: everything we do is a response to past and present\ncircumstances over which we have no control. But some of the forces\nthat move us to act do not merely affect which actions we choose to\nperform, nor how we govern ourselves in making these choices. They\ninfluence us in a way that makes a mockery of our authority to\ndetermine our own actions. They undermine our autonomy. \n\nWhat distinguishes autonomy-undermining influences on a person’s\ndecision, intention, or will from those motivating forces that merely\nplay a role in the self-governing process? This is the question that\nall accounts of autonomy try to answer. As the number and variety of\nthese accounts indicate, the distinction is extremely elusive. There is\ncertainly widespread agreement about the paradigm threats to personal\nautonomy: brainwashing and addiction are the favorite examples in the\nphilosophical literature. But philosophers seem unable to reach a\nconsensus about the precise nature of these threats. They cannot agree\nabout how it is that certain influences on our behavior prevent us from\ngoverning ourselves. \n\nThis disagreement about the defining characteristics of autonomous\nagency reflects the fact that even as concrete examples appear to call\nattention to a very real difference between those who govern themselves\nand those who do not, there are significant conceptual obstacles to\nmaking sense of this distinction. These obstacles are tied to the very\nfeature of agency mentioned above—the feature that appears to\nsupport the demand that individuals be granted considerable political\nand legal power. If an agent fails to govern herself when she acts,\nthis must be because what she does is independent of her power to\ndetermine how she will act. But if she necessarily has the authority to\ndetermine how she will act, and if this essential feature of agency is\ninseparable from the fact that she necessarily defers to herself\nwhenever she initiates her action, then how can her behavior possibly\nescape her control? Intuitively, an agent can fall under the sway of\ndesires, or urges, or compulsions whose power is at odds with her own\npower as an agent; she can be moved by such impulses “in spite of\nherself.” But in what sense, exactly, are such motives\n“external” to the agent herself? How can their\npower to move her fail to be a manifestation of her power to\nact? How can their power reduce her authorization of her action to a\nmere formality? It is difficult to answer these questions when the\ngoverning agent and the agent she governs are one and the same. \n\n(Again, the perplexity to which these questions give voice does not\nhave a correlate in the political case. We can easily grasp the idea of\na country’s army (or legislative body, or cabinet ministers) dictating\nto the president what legislation he must approve; for in this case\nthere are (at least) two independently identifiable \ndecision-makers—each with its own point of view, each with its own power. The\ndifficulty in the case where the relevant powers are all within the\npsyche of a single individual agent is that there is no such\nindependently identifiable pair of standpoints in terms of which we can\ndistinguish the powers that bully this agent from the powers that can\nbe attributed to the agent herself. An account of the conditions under\nwhich an individual agent is bullied by her motives is, at the same\ntime, an account of what makes a motive external to the agent’s own\nstandpoint.) \n\nPhilosophers have proposed many different accounts of the autonomous\nagent’s special relation to her own motives. According to one\nprominent conception, which one might call\n“coherentist,” an agent governs her own action if\nand only if she is motivated to act as she does because this\nmotivation coheres with (is in harmony with) some mental state that\nrepresents her point of view on the action.  The relevant mental state\nvaries from account to account. According to one popular story, an\nagent’s point of view is constituted by her highest-order desires\nregarding which of her first-order desires moves her to\nact. (Frankfurt\n 1988c)[1] \nAccording to another story, her point of\nview is constituted by her (contemporaneous or long-term) evaluative\njudgments regarding which actions are (most) worth performing. (Watson\n 1975)[2] Still\nanother account adds that there must also be harmony between what the\nagent does and her more or less long-term plans (Bratman 1979 and\n2007).  And others appeal to the relatively stable network of\nemotional states constitutive of “caring” (Frankfurt 1988f\nand 1999d, Jaworska, Shoemaker\n 2003)[3]\n or to the agent’s character traits\n(Dworkin, R.), or to her most thoroughly “integrated”\npsychological states (Arpaly and Schroeder).\n \n\nAll these accounts reflect the intuition that an action cannot be\nattributed to the agent herself if, even as she performs this action,\nshe occupies a point of view from which she repudiates what she is\ndoing. More carefully, such an action cannot be the agent’s doing in\nthe way that it must be if it is to qualify as an instance of\nself-government. According to this intuition, if someone repudiates,\nor in some other way dissociates herself from, the causal efficacy of\nher own motives, then the power of these motives is independent of her\nauthority. If, on the other hand, she endorses these motives, whether\nimplicitly or explicitly, then her actions occur with her permission,\nif not necessarily at her command. Under what conditions does someone\ncount as endorsing or repudiating her motives?  Each account offers a\ndifferent answer to this question. \n\nNot only does there appear to be a tight conceptual connection between\nself-governing agency and synchronic psychic unity; there\nalso appears to be a connection between self-governing agency and\nthe diachronic unity of one’s later self with one’s earlier\nself. This is the connection central to accounts that identify\nself-governing agents with agents constrained by plans, or by\nwell-integrated emotions, or traits of character. Agents persist\nthrough time; and so, these accounts stress, an agent’s point of view\nis not simply a function of whatever mental state(s) she happens to be\nin at some point in time. Because an agent’s plans play a crucial role\nin ensuring that she is more than a mere collection or sequence of\nmental states, it is reasonable to think that whether her motives have\nher support depends on whether they are constrained by these plans.\nSo, too, it is reasonable to think that her stance toward her motives\nis determined by her long-term values and/or her relatively stable\ncommitments and cares.\n \n\nOn a strict coherentist conception of autonomy, autonomous agents can\nbe moved by desires they are helpless to resist: though an addict fails\nto govern herself if she would rather resist her irresistible urge to\ntake drugs, she is an autonomous agent if she has no objection to her\naddiction and its motivational effects. According to the coherentist,\nmoreover, both the origin and the content of a person’s higher-order\nattitudes (evaluative judgments, plans) are irrelevant to whether she\nis an autonomous agent. She need have done nothing to bring it about\nthat she has these attitudes; and the attitudes need not be especially\nrational or well-informed. Coherentist accounts are thus doubly\ninternalist. They express the intuition that whether we govern\nourselves depends on neither how we came to be who we are (a fact that\nis prior to (and in this sense external to) the action itself) nor how\nour beliefs and attitudes relate to reality (a fact that is independent\nof (and in this sense external to) the beliefs and attitudes\nthemselves). In other words, on these accounts, there need be no special\nrelation between our autonomy-constituting attitudes and either the\npast circumstances that caused these attitudes or the present\ncircumstances in response to which they move us to act. \n\nOther accounts of autonomy introduce conditions that are\nexternalist in one or both of these ways. According to those\nwho advocate a reasons-responsive conception of autonomous agency, an\nagent does not really govern herself unless her motives, or the mental\nprocesses that produce them, are responsive to a sufficiently wide\nrange of reasons for and against behaving as she\n does. (Fischer and Ravizza, Nelkin, \n Wolf)[4]\n On accounts\nof this type, an agent who is unresponsive to the reasons for\n“standing behind,” or “backing up,” certain\nmotives and not others is not in the proper position to authorize her\nown actions. Whether the relevant reasons are grounded in facts about\nher own desires and interests, or whether they have some independent\nsource, the idea is that someone is not qualified to govern herself if\nshe cannot understand what she (really) has reason to do, or (if this\nis a distinct handicap) is incapable of being moved by these reasons.\nIn effect, her exercise of authority is so ill-conceived that it is\npowerless to confer legitimacy on her motives. \n\nThe feature of these accounts that most distinguishes them from\ncoherentist accounts is the importance they attribute to an agent’s\nability to appreciate the reasons she has. (Once she appreciates these\nreasons, her inability to act accordingly is, essentially, the\ninability to conform her act to her own judgment, and to her\ncorresponding (higher-order) desire.) What, exactly, is the connection\nsupposed to be between being out of touch with (evaluative and/or\nnonevaluative) reality and failing to govern oneself? Clearly, a person\nwho fails to appreciate a wide range of reasons for action is unlikely\nto govern herself well: she is likely to do things that will,\nin the long run, thwart her own purposes and interests. The\nreasons-responsiveness conception of autonomy thus appears to\nreflect the intuition that when we do something very poorly, we do not\nreally do it at all. There is, however, another possible underlying\nrationale for regarding ignorance as a threat to self-government. If\ndoing Y is constitutive of doing Z, then if I\nauthorize myself to be moved by the desire to do Y because I\nmistakenly believe that doing Y is a way of not doing\nZ, then there is an obvious sense in which I have not\nauthorized myself to do what I am now doing when I am moved by the\ndesire to do Y. So, if I have a general desire to do what is\nright and prudent, or, even more generally, a desire to do what I can\njustify to myself (and others), or, more generally still, a desire to\nbe responsive to reasons, then insofar as I am moved to act in ways\nthat are, in fact, incompatible with satisfying these desires, there\nis a sense in which I—who am committed to doing only what I\nhave good (enough) reason to do—have not really authorized my\naction. Alternatively, we could say that, under these circumstances,\nsomething external to my power to guide myself by reasons has\nprevented me from exercising this power, and so has prevented me from\ngoverning\n myself.[5] \n\nAn additional source of support for the reasons-responsive\nconception of autonomy comes from the thought that someone who cannot\nrespond to the reasons there are must have a limited ability to reason.\nThis brings us to a third popular approach to autonomous \nagency—an approach that stresses the importance of the reasoning process\n itself (Christman 1991, 1993 and Mele 1993,\n 1995).[6]\n According to\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts, the essence of\nself-government is the capacity to evaluate one’s motives on the basis\nof whatever else one believes and desires, and to adjust these motives\nin response to one’s evaluations. It is the capacity to discern what\n“follows from” one’s beliefs and desires, and to act\naccordingly. One can exercise this capacity despite holding false\nbeliefs of all kinds about what one has reason to do. Accordingly, on\nthese accounts, being autonomous is not the same thing as being guided\nby correct evaluative and normative judgments. \n\nThe emphasis on an autonomous agent’s responsiveness to her own\nreasoning reflects the intuition that someone whose education consisted\nof a method of indoctrination that deprived her of the ability to call\nher own attitudes into question would, in effect, be governed by her\n“programmers,” not by herself. So, too, someone whose\npractical reasoning was directly manipulated by others would not govern\nherself by means of this reasoning. And so, it seems, she would have no\npower over the motives that this reasoning produced. \n\nLike the coherentists, advocates of responsiveness-to-reasoning\naccounts believe that the key to autonomous agency is the ability to\ndistance oneself from one’s attitudes and beliefs—to occupy a\nstandpoint that is not constituted by whatever mental states are moving\none to act. They agree that motives authorized from this reflective\nstandpoint are internal to the agent herself in a way that her other\nmotives are not. Unlike the coherentists, however, the\nreasoning-responsive theorists believe that there is more to the\ncapacity for self-reflection than the capacity to hold higher-order\nattitudes. The authority of our higher-order attitudes is grounded,\nthey claim, in the authority of the practical reasoning that supports\nthese attitudes. So a self-governing agent does not merely endorse her\nmotives: her endorsements are implicit claims about which motives have\nthe support of her reason. \n\nThis fact is closely tied to another. Like many accounts that stress\nan autonomous agent’s responsiveness to reasons, responsiveness-\nto-reasoning accounts often suggest that self-government requires the\ncapacity for self-transformation. On this assumption, an autonomous\nagent is someone who can change her mind when she discovers good reason\nto do\n so.[7]\n In contrast, strict coherentists insist that\nit is possible to act autonomously while being moved by desires that\nare not only irresistible when they produce their effects, but so\nintegral to one’s identity that one could not possibly will to resist\nthem.[8] \n\nThe conception of autonomous agency as responsiveness to reasoning\nclearly has a more internalist character than the conception of\nautonomous agency as responsiveness to reasons: according to those who\nstress the autonomous agent’s ability to evaluate her own motives, what\ncounts is not the relation between the agent’s attitudes and external\nreality, but her ability to draw inferences from what she wants and\nbelieves, and by so doing, to reconsider—to rationally reflect\nupon—her other desires and beliefs. Insofar, however, as a\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning account presupposes a particular conception\nof practical reasoning, it appeals to standards, or principles, that\nthe agent herself might misapply, or fail to recognize altogether.\nMoreover, even if advocates of autonomy as responsiveness-to-reasoning\nhave nothing in particular in mind when they speak of the process of\n“reflection,” “rational evaluation,” etc.,\nreasoning is a norm-governed process that an agent might reject for\nreasons of her own. Responsiveness to reasoning accounts thus contain\nan externalist element that is absent from strict coherentist accounts.\nThey imply that an agent can be mistaken about whether she is really\nreasoning—and so can be mistaken about whether the power of her\nmotives reflects the fact that she has the authority to determine her\nown actions. \n\nThis weak externalism naturally expands into more robust varieties.\nIn particular, it supports the idea that whether an agent’s reasoning\nis really her way of governing her actions depends on which\nforces exert a nonrational influence on this reasoning. Even when\nindoctrination and other more or less imaginary forms of “mind\ncontrol” do not prevent a person from reaching evaluative\nconclusions about her own motives, they can prevent her from thinking\nfor herself. So, too, it seems, someone in the grip of compulsion or\naddiction can be so dominated by this condition that whatever facts she\nconsiders, and whatever conclusions she draws, cannot legitimately be\nattributed to her. One way to interpret these cases is to say that the\nperson’s reasoning falls so far short of the norms of “rational\nreflection” that she is not really reasoning at all.\nAlternatively, one can say that her reasoning does not guarantee her\nautonomy because it is under the control of external forces. \n\nInsofar as accounts of autonomy simply stipulate that certain\ninfluences on an agent’s intention-forming process “interfere\nwith,” or “pervert,” this process, these accounts\nare incomplete. For they leave it mysterious why certain influences,\nand not others, are a threat to self-government. One response to this\nchallenge is offered by reasons-responsive accounts: according to this\nresponse, the autonomy-undermining influences are the ones that\nprevent the reasoning process from being sufficiently sensitive to the\nreasons there\n are.[9]\nAnother – compatible – response appeals to the\n“relational” aspects of autonomy: other agents can prevent\nsomeone’s reasoning from qualifying as a mode of self-government by\npreventing the reasoner from developing the self-respect and/or\nself-trust necessary for forming a point of view that is truly her\nown (Benson 1994, 2000, Mackenzie and Stoljar, Anderson and \n Honneth)[10].\n If an agent’s point of view does not reflect her respect for\nherself and for her ability to set her own ends and assess the reasons\nrelevant to pursuing some ends and not others, then the direction her\nreasoning takes cannot be attributed to her.  (Though relational\naccounts of autonomy highlight the extent to which an agent’s capacity\nto govern herself depends on her interactions with other agents, it is\nimportant to note that self-respect and self-trust can also be\nundermined by experiences or psychological conditions that do not\ninvolve the actions of anyone else.) \nA fourth conception of personal autonomy offers a very different\nresponse to the challenge of distinguishing (i) the determining causes\nthat prevent an agent from governing herself when she employs her\nreason from (ii) the causes that determine how an agent governs\nherself when she reasons.  According to this incompatibilist\nconception, each of these influences undermines the agent’s autonomy;\ncases of mind control simply call our attention to the fact that\nwhenever our motives are causally determined by events over which we\nhave no control, their power does not reflect our\nauthority. (Pereboom) According to incompatibilists, if our actions\ncan be fully explained as the effects of causal powers that are\nindependent of us, then even if our beliefs and attitudes are among\nthese effects, we do not govern them, and so we do not govern\nourselves. (Kane 1996 and van Inwagen\n1983)[11] \n\nIncompatibilist accounts of autonomy take many subtly different\nforms. So do the three other (compatibilist) accounts mentioned here.\nSome of the differences reflect disagreements over the extent to which\nthe relevant conditions—coherence among higher- and\nlower-order attitudes, responsiveness to reasons, responsiveness to\nreasoning, freedom from determination by external causes—must\nactually obtain when an agent determines her will, or whether it is\nenough that under certain specified circumstances the\nagent would relate to her motives in the stipulated manner.\nThere is also a difference of opinion about the scope of the relevant\ncapacities: Must an autonomous agent be capable of responding to a\nwide range of reasons for and against her action? or is it enough that\nher motives are responsive to the “strongest,” “most\ncompelling” reasons? and can these reasons include the sort of\ncredible threats that figure in cases of coercion? What range of\nattitudes must an autonomous agent be capable of calling into\nquestion?  How well must she be capable of reasoning? Does it matter\nwhether she is guided by certain principles of rationality? Must it be\npossible for her to draw different conclusions on the basis of the\nreasons she considers? Is it essential that she could have considered\na different set of reasons instead? \n\nThere are even disagreements over whether the reasons to which\nself-governing agents respond are, as most assume, practical\nconsiderations concerning what to do, or what is worth doing. It has\nbeen suggested that agents govern their actions by engaging in\ntheoretical reasoning to the end of forming beliefs about which modes\nof behavior they could explain, given their desires. (Velleman) This suggestion\nstresses the extent to which governing oneself involves deferring to\npsychic demands whose power is independent of one’s authority. On this\npicture, an agent exercises authority over what she does only once she\nis faced with a set of possible actions, whose possibility reflects\ntheir compatibility with the causal power of her desires: in predicting\nthat she will perform one of these actions, she authorizes this action,\nand thereby strengthens her motives for performing\n it.[12] \n\nThis way of interpreting the link between autonomous agency and\nresponsiveness to reasons raises larger questions about the\nrelationship between our practical impulses and our reason.  The\nanswers to these questions, and to those mentioned above can be\ncombined in many different ways.  Not only, moreover, can each\napproach thus take a wide variety of forms, but the approaches\nthemselves can (and often do) figure together as necessary or\nsufficient conditions in a single complex account. \n\nAll the proposals just considered contribute to our understanding\nof the various roles that agents can play in their\nown actions. They articulate various ideals that agents can realize to\nvarious degrees when they act. In so doing, they shed light on how,\nwith the proper training, a very young child, whose deference to the\nauthority of her own judgments is little more than the form of\nself-government, can develop into an exemplary self-governing agent. \n\nThis is a very important contribution. Nonetheless, it falls short\nof giving us everything we have reason to expect from an account of\npersonal autonomy. In particular, challenges to the different\napproaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the\nminimal conditions under which a person’s exercise of authority over\nhow she behaves reflects her own power to determine how\nshe exercises this authority. Minimal self-government seems to\nrequire nothing more nor less than being the power behind whatever\nreasoning directly gives rise to one’s behavior. Yet none of the\naccounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most\nbasic, form of self-government. Nor, it seems, does any combination of\nthese accounts. \n\nThe worry that the coherence of one’s contemporaneous attitudes does\nnot suffice for even minimal self-government is grounded in the\napparent possibility that a person could be brainwashed, or otherwise\ncompelled, to endorse a given motive. Indeed, her brain could be\nmanipulated in such a way that each of her endorsements is highly\nresponsive to reasons. This has led some philosophers to supplement\ncoherentist accounts of autonomy with additional conditions that place\nconstraints on the causal history of an agent’s endorsements,\nconstraints of the very sort singled out in the\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts. These supplements face a\nsignificant challenge, however: it is very difficult to spell out the\ndistinction between autonomy-conferring reasoning and\nautonomy-undermining reasoning without implicitly appealing to\nthe very phenomenon one is trying to explain. \n\nEven if historical approaches to autonomy can successfully overcome\nthis difficulty, they do nothing to address the fact that coherence is\nnot even necessary for autonomous agency. An agent need not sacrifice\nher autonomy in order to decide to act contrary to her long-term\ncommitments and concerns; acting “out of character” is not\na sufficient condition for failing to govern oneself.  Though a\n“weak-willed” agent is hardly a paradigm example of\nsomeone who governs herself when she acts, she too plays a decisive\nrole in the relative power of her own motives; she authorizes her\nbehavior, even though she believes that she has good reason to act\notherwise. It is notoriously difficult to make sense of such an\nexercise of\n authority.[13] \nFor our purposes here, however, it\nsuffices to note that if weakness of will is a genuine phenomenon,\nthen human agents have the capacity to govern themselves in a way that\nthey themselves take to be unjustified. They can assert an authority\nover themselves that challenges the authority of their very own\nreason. \n\nOf course, someone whose action is caused in this way does not\ngovern herself as thoroughly as someone whose will is\n“strong”; she acts for a reason that she herself deems\ninadequate; and so she is not (adequately) governed by the norms of her\nown thought. Nonetheless, even under these conditions, the desires that\nmove her to act do so on her own authority. To use what is perhaps the\nmost important metaphor in the literature on personal autonomy, the\nweak-willed agent “identifies with” her motives in whatever\nway she must in order to be accountable for their effects. It is not\nsimply that what she does is the result of an earlier autonomous\naction. Rather, her accountability is grounded in her contemporaneous\nrelation to what she is doing. \nThe possibility of weakness of will points to the more general fact\nthat an agent’s authorization of her own motives need not take the\nform of the judgment that it would not be better to act otherwise.\nVarious forms of perversity are perfectly compatible with autonomous\nagency.  Some philosophers believe that it is also possible for agents\nto defy their own contemporaneous normative verdicts without defying\nanything very deep about themselves. A woman, for example, may\nconclude that even though she has an overriding reason to give up her\nchild for adoption, she cannot recognize herself in this action, and\nso cannot identify with the desire to perform\n it.[14]\nReasonable people will surely disagree about how best to interpret any\nparticular example. But human experience does seem to support the\ngeneral point: the human capacity for self-reflection enables human\nagents to distance themselves in thought from every aspect of their\nown psyches—even their rational reflections. Given this\npossibility, a person’s identification with her motives cannot be\ncashed out in terms of higher-order attitudes of approval and\ndisapproval, or in terms of the rational reflections that typically\nground these attitudes. \n\nSimilar concerns are raised by the appeal to plans. Though plans\noften enable a person to exercise some measure of control over her life\nas a whole, a person can govern herself at a particular time even while\ndefying her earlier attempts to place constraints on how she will\ngovern herself at this time. She can take it upon herself to abandon\nher plans, or to modify them in ways she did not anticipate when she\nfirst made them. She can even reject the counsel of the long-term\nvalues that provide the underlying rationale for these plans. \n\nReflections along these lines have led some to conclude that we are\nbound to come up empty-handed as long as we think of an agent’s\nidentification with her motives as a self-relation she is responsible\nfor securing. For, as long as we take this approach, we appear to be\nstuck with the question: under what conditions does the agent govern\nher identification with some motive? what conditions must she satisfy\nin order to identify with the motives that move her to identify with\nsome of her motives and not others? under what conditions does she\nauthorize the attitudes and/or mental activities that issue in a given\nlower-order authorization? If we are to escape the regress such\nquestions evoke, it seems that there must be an attitude that can be\nidentified with the agent’s point of view simply by virtue of being the\nattitude it is; there must be an attitude from which no agent can\npossibly be alienated. To be sure, if—like most animals—rational \nagents could not distance themselves from their own motives,\nthen they would be incapable of governing themselves. Self-government\nrequires two points of view: that of the governing authority, and that\nof the governed. Nonetheless, if there is to be an end to the potential\nregress of identifications, it seems that there must also be a limit to\nthe capacity for self-alienation. \n\nAs we have seen, no such limitation seems to apply where the mental\nstate at stake is an agent’s highest-order desire, evaluative\njudgment, or plan, or even an integrated combination of such\nattitudes. The only attitude from which it seems that no agent can be\nalienated is the desire to have sufficient power to determine one’s\nown motives—the desire to be a self-governing\n agent.[15]\n Even if, however, we leave to one side the\nquestion of whether this desire can really be attributed to every\npotentially self-governing agent, it does not seem to be an adequate\nbasis for distinguishing motives whose power can be attributed to the\nagent herself from motives that are not in this sense internal. For if\na desire underlies every action performed by a potentially\nself-governing agent, then it plays a causal role even when an agent\nfails to govern her motives in the minimal way necessary to be\naccountable for them. It thus cannot be the key to any account of what\nis special about self-governing \n agency[16].\n \n\nPerhaps there is no attitude to which we can point in order to\ndistinguish between cases in which the power of an agent’s motives can\nbe directly attributed to her and cases in which her authority\nover her motives is a mere formality. If so, then this might seem to be\na reason to favor accounts that tie autonomous agency to the agent’s\nresponsiveness to reasons. Unfortunately, however, these accounts have\nproblems of their own. Most importantly, it seems as though a person\ncan govern herself even if she does not understand the significance of\nwhat she is doing. To be sure, if someone’s ignorance is perfectly\nreasonable, then she may not be to blame if she does something wrong.\nBut under such circumstances, what frees her from blame is the fact\nthat she has good reason to be ignorant. There appears to be no basis\nfor assuming that, in addition to lacking certain relevant information,\nshe is not really the (ill-informed) power behind her authorization of\nher action. \n\nIn killing Desdemona, Othello fails to accomplish his aim of doing\nwhat he has good reason to do. But this does not prevent him from\nbeing the author of his own actions. Nor would he necessarily have\nbeen prevented from governing himself if, given his character and\ncircumstances, he had been unable to “track” the\nevaluative and nonevaluative facts: he would still have been\naccountable for what he did if his reason for doing it had been that\nhe was too jealous, or too stubborn, or too vain, or too hot-tempered\nto be capable of responding to the wide range of reasons against\nbelieving that his wife was unfaithful to him—and the wide\nrange of reasons against killing her even if she was\n unfaithful.[17]\n More carefully, to\ninsist that he would not have been accountable under these\ncircumstances, we must abandon the assumption that autonomous agency is\npossible even if all actions can, in principle, be explained in terms\nof deterministic laws of nature. In other words, we must accept the\nincompatibilist thesis that if a person’s character is the product of\nforces over which he never had any control, and if his character traits\ndetermine his choices, then even if his motives are responsive to\nreasons, he is not responsible for their motivating force. \n\nThe preceding reflections call attention to how difficult it is to\ndistinguish the conditions of ideal self-government from the\nconditions under which one is sufficiently self-governing to be\nresponsible for the motivating power of one’s desires. The difficulty\nis manifested in the fact that as soon as we try to pin down the\nminimal, threshold conditions of autonomous agency, we seem to\ncome up against the conditions necessary for agency\nitself. \n\nConsider, for example, an alleged paradigm case of an agent who fails\nto govern herself: a person who takes drugs even though she would\nrather resist the motivating force of her addiction. It is widely\nagreed that, even if many people who fit this description are merely\nweak-willed, not all of them are: some unwilling addicts are not\nself-governing in even the minimal sense. According to coherentist and\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts, this is because such addicts\nare, in effect, “passive bystanders” to their own\nmotives. But even if we could find a satisfactory account of the\nrelevant passivity, this diagnosis would be problematic. For it\nassimilates the addict to someone whose behavior does not even qualify\nas an action—someone, e.g., with Tourette’s Syndrome,\nwhose verbal outbursts and bodily movements are not\neven voluntary. It thus fails to shed light on the conditions\nunder which someone acts—intentionally, even \ndeliberately—without being accountable for what she does. (The same problem\narises for the proposal that autonomous agents differ from other\nagents in virtue of their special way of understanding what they are\nup to.  Regardless of whether someone governs her intentional actions,\nshe knows what she is doing without having to observe her behavior.\nIf someone had to observe her own behavior in order to discover what\nshe was up to, then this behavior would not qualify as her action.)\n \n\nIf someone’s motives directly defy her attempt to exercise authority\nover her actions, then their power is not only independent of her\nauthority; they bypass her agency altogether. Even if under these\nconditions a person can acknowledge that there is something to be said\nfor behaving as she does, she is as alienated from the power of her own\nmotives as she is from the power of the physiological states that\nproduce her reflex movements. She is not an autonomous agent because\nshe is not an agent at \n all[18].\n \n\nOf course, there is a sense in which the addict, but not the victim\nof Tourette’s, is responsive to reasons. But even if we could spell out\nthis distinction in a satisfactory way, we still face the problem of\nexplaining why an agent’s capacity to respond to external reality is\nrelevant to her capacity to govern herself. And there are other\nproblems too. If, for example, nonaction differs from action in virtue\nof being unresponsive to reasons, then it follows that nonrational\nanimals never really act, or that acting from instinct is acting for\nreasons. It is not clear what considerations could overcome the\nimplausibility of these implications. \n\nEven nonautonomous rational agents authorize the motivating\npower of the desires that move them to act. Yet there is an important\nsense in which the power behind their authorizations is not their own.\nWhat does the relevant impotence amount to? The incompatibilist, we\nsaw, has a ready answer: an agent is prevented from exercising any\npower over her behavior when her authorization of this behavior can be\ntraced to the determining influence of external powers. According to\nthe incompatibilist, if the unwilling addict fails to govern herself,\nthis is because her motives are determined by past states of affair\nover which she does not have (and never did have) any control. And if a\nwilling addict’s motives have a similar genesis, then she,\ntoo, is not accountable for their motivating power. \n\nThe familiar problem with this answer is that there seems to be no way\nfor an agent to gain an extra measure of control over her motives\nsimply by acquiring attitudes or judgments or other mental states that\nare not determined by anything else. If someone’s attitude toward her\nmotives is not determined by any earlier state of affairs, then how\ncan it be determined by her? This question pushes some with\nincompatibilist intuitions to attribute a special causal power to\nagents—a power of agency, which is not reducible to the effect\none event has on another. On this view, a person can\n“agent-cause” a certain response to earlier events in a\nway that is not itself the effect of these earlier events. (Chisholm,\nClarke, O’Connor, Taylor, R.) She can bring it about that she is\nmotivated in a certain way, without anything determining her to do so.\nThus, her power over her actions cannot be reduced to the power of\nexternal motivating\n forces.[19] \n\nSuch accounts of autonomous agency take seriously the need to\ndistinguish an agent’s power from the power of the psychic forces that\npush and pull her. Yet the obscurities of the special sort of causation\nthey evoke are enough to prevent most philosophers from embracing this\nconception of autonomous agency. To mention just a few familiar\nchallenges: If agent-causing an event does not involve doing something\nto bring it about that the event occurs, then how does the agent exert\nher causal power? and why does this power produce its effects at one\ntime rather than another? If, on the other hand, an agent must do\nsomething in order to agent-cause an action, then doesn’t this require\nthat she undergo some change? and isn’t this change of state itself an\nevent? \n\nOn the basis of these and other difficulties, many conclude that the\nappeal to agent-causation provides no more insight into autonomy than\nthe simple assertion that we can sometimes govern the causal efficacy\nof our own motives. Incompatibilists who are sympathetic with this\ncomplaint nonetheless insist that even if an agent’s causal power must\nbe understood in terms of the causal relations among events, autonomous\nagency is possible only if the conditions that immediately give rise to\nan agent’s intention need not suffice to produce it. If, they argue, an\nagent cannot authorize a given action without being determined to do so\nby powers beyond her control, then autonomous agency is an illusion. If\nour every action is an event in a deterministic causal chain, then we\nauthorize our actions only in the sense that a figurehead authorizes\nthe decisions she is forced to sign. Indeed, unlike a political puppet,\nwe do not even have the option of \n defiance[20].\n \nOthers see things differently, however. They argue that the\nincompatibilist’s conclusion reflects a misunderstanding of the very\nnature of rational agency. In making their case, they take their lead\nfrom the philosopher who has contributed more than any other to our\nunderstanding of autonomy. Kant, they note, stresses the deep\ndifferences between the two points of view from which we can think\nabout ourselves and our\n world.[21]\n We take up the\ntheoretical point of view in order to gain knowledge about the\nnature of reality, and on this basis make predictions about which\neffects will follow from which causes. When we want to make up our\nminds about what to do, however, we take up the practical\npoint of view. From this point of view, too, we survey the facts that\nare relevant to our decisions. But since none of these facts, taken\nsingly or together, is intrinsically action-guiding, they cannot free\nus from the task of drawing our own conclusions about what we have\nreason to do. (Korsgaard, Bok) \nThis is true, the neo-Kantians point out, even if our decisions are\nthe effect of causal powers over which we have no control. Since no\nfacts of which we could possibly become aware can force us to attribute\nany particular significance to them, and since in order to decide what\nto do, we must attribute some significance to the facts of which we are\naware (even if this involves taking them to have no significance at\nall), our decisions are “up to us.” According to those who press this\nline of argument, our authority over our own actions would not be\nillusory even if our mode of exercising it were causally determined by\nevents or states of affairs over which we have no control. Even under\nthese circumstances, no events or states of affairs would have the\npower to determine what we have reason to do. So even under\nthese circumstances, we have to reach our own conclusions on this point\nand acting accordingly. (Note that since this argument relies on the\nconnection between determining what we have reason to do and\ndetermining what we will do, it can also be endorsed by those\nwho take acting for reasons to involve responding to theoretical\nreasons. Indeed, there is a loose sense in which an agent’s point of\nview is “practical” as long as the truth of her predictions\ndepends on the fact that she makes them.) \n\nThese last observations take us back to where we started. The\npolitical demand to be permitted to govern ourselves is grounded in the\nmetaphysics of agency: any agent who faces the task of “making up\nher mind” has the authority to determine how she will act. On\nmost occasions, what an agent does is the direct effect of her exercise\nof this authority. Yet there is also ample evidence that the capacity\nfor self-government is vulnerable to any number of assaults; an agent’s\nauthority over her actions is no guarantee that she has the power to\ndetermine how she exercises this authority. Agents can be deprived of\ntheir autonomy by brainwashing, depression, anxiety, fatigue; they can\nsuccumb to compulsions and addictions. To what, exactly, are we calling\nattention when we say that, under these conditions, an agent does not\ngovern herself, even if she acts as she does because she thinks she has\nsufficient reason to do so, even if she has (thoroughly) considered the\npros and cons of her options, and has endorsed her behavior on this\nbasis, and even if she would have acted differently if there had been\nstronger reason to do so? Most agents who are capable of asking this\nquestion are confident that they are the authors of most of their\nactions, and are thus accountable for most of what they do. Nonetheless, as\nthis brief survey indicates, the self-relation they thereby attribute\nto themselves is extremely difficult to pin \n down.[22]","contact.mail":"sbuss@umich.edu","contact.domain":"umich.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-05-28","date.changed":"2018-02-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/","author1":"Sarah Buss","author2":"Andrea Westlund","entry":"personal-autonomy","body.text":"\n\n\nAutonomous agents are self-governing agents. But what is a\nself-governing agent?  Governing oneself is no guarantee that one will\nhave a greater range of options in the future, or the sort of\nopportunities one most wants to have.  Since, moreover, a person can\ngovern herself without being able to appreciate the difference between\nright and wrong, it seems that an autonomous agent can do something\nwrong without being to blame for her action. What, then, are the\nnecessary and sufficient features of this self-relation?  Philosophers\nhave offered a wide range of competing answers to this question.\n\n\n\nWhen people living in some region of the world declare that their\ngroup has the right to live autonomously, they are saying that they\nought to be allowed to govern themselves. In making this claim, they\nare, in essence, rejecting the political and legal authority of those\nnot in their group. They are insisting that whatever power these\noutsiders may have over them, this power is illegitimate; they, and\nthey alone, have the authority to determine and enforce the rules and\npolicies that govern their lives. \n\nWhen an individual makes a similar declaration about some sphere of\nher own life, she, too, is denying that anyone else has the authority\nto control her activity within this sphere; she is saying that any\nexercise of power over this activity is illegitimate unless she\nauthorizes it herself. Most of the reasons that can be offered in\nsupport of this claim have correlates in the case of demands for group\nautonomy. But there is one very important exception: a reason that\ntakes us beyond politics, to the metaphysics of agency. \n\nAn agent is one who acts. In order to act, one must initiate one’s\naction. And one cannot initiate one’s action without exercising one’s\npower to do so. Since nothing and no one has the power to act except\nthe agent herself, she alone is entitled to exercise this power, if she\nis entitled to act. This means that insofar as someone is an agent,\ni.e., insofar as she is one who acts—she is correct to regard\nher own commitments to acting, her own judgments and decisions about\nhow she should act, as authoritative. Indeed, if she were to challenge\nthe authority that is an essential feature of her judgments and\ndecisions, then they would cease to be her own practical conclusions.\nTheir power to move her would cease to be a manifestation of her power\nto move herself; it would not be the power of her own agency. \n\nIn short, every agent has an authority over herself that is\ngrounded, not in her political or social role, nor in any law or\ncustom, but in the simple fact that she alone can initiate her actions.\nTo be sure, it might be unwise for someone to follow the commands she\ngives to herself when she “makes up her mind.” The point,\nhowever, is that she has no conceivable option. In order to form an\nintention to do one thing rather than another, an agent must regard her\nown judgment about how to act as authoritative—even if it is\nonly the judgment that she should follow the command or advice of\nsomeone else. This tight connection between being an agent and having\nauthority has no correlate in cases where the authority at issue is\npolitical. Anyone can coherently (and often plausibly) challenge the\npolitical authority of some individual or group. Even a political\nleader herself can with good reason believe that her political power is\nillegitimate, and that exercising this power is unjustified. \n\nDespite the special inalienable nature of our authority over\nourselves, it is possible for us to fail to govern ourselves, just as\nit is possible for a political leader to fail to govern those who fall\nwithin her domain. Indeed, precisely because our authority over our own\nactions is an intrinsic feature of our agency, our deference to this\nauthority is but the form of self-government. It is no guarantee that\nwhenever we act, the forces that move us owe their power to\nour power to decide what to do. Just as a political leader’s\nofficial status is compatible with her having no real power to call the\nshots, so too, a person can have an authoritative status with respect\nto her motives without having any real power over them. Though it is an\nagent’s job to determine how she will act, she can do this job without\nreally being in control. Of course, no one can govern herself without\nbeing subject to influences whose power does not derive from her own\nauthority: everything we do is a response to past and present\ncircumstances over which we have no control. But some of the forces\nthat move us to act do not merely affect which actions we choose to\nperform, nor how we govern ourselves in making these choices. They\ninfluence us in a way that makes a mockery of our authority to\ndetermine our own actions. They undermine our autonomy. \n\nWhat distinguishes autonomy-undermining influences on a person’s\ndecision, intention, or will from those motivating forces that merely\nplay a role in the self-governing process? This is the question that\nall accounts of autonomy try to answer. As the number and variety of\nthese accounts indicate, the distinction is extremely elusive. There is\ncertainly widespread agreement about the paradigm threats to personal\nautonomy: brainwashing and addiction are the favorite examples in the\nphilosophical literature. But philosophers seem unable to reach a\nconsensus about the precise nature of these threats. They cannot agree\nabout how it is that certain influences on our behavior prevent us from\ngoverning ourselves. \n\nThis disagreement about the defining characteristics of autonomous\nagency reflects the fact that even as concrete examples appear to call\nattention to a very real difference between those who govern themselves\nand those who do not, there are significant conceptual obstacles to\nmaking sense of this distinction. These obstacles are tied to the very\nfeature of agency mentioned above—the feature that appears to\nsupport the demand that individuals be granted considerable political\nand legal power. If an agent fails to govern herself when she acts,\nthis must be because what she does is independent of her power to\ndetermine how she will act. But if she necessarily has the authority to\ndetermine how she will act, and if this essential feature of agency is\ninseparable from the fact that she necessarily defers to herself\nwhenever she initiates her action, then how can her behavior possibly\nescape her control? Intuitively, an agent can fall under the sway of\ndesires, or urges, or compulsions whose power is at odds with her own\npower as an agent; she can be moved by such impulses “in spite of\nherself.” But in what sense, exactly, are such motives\n“external” to the agent herself? How can their\npower to move her fail to be a manifestation of her power to\nact? How can their power reduce her authorization of her action to a\nmere formality? It is difficult to answer these questions when the\ngoverning agent and the agent she governs are one and the same. \n\n(Again, the perplexity to which these questions give voice does not\nhave a correlate in the political case. We can easily grasp the idea of\na country’s army (or legislative body, or cabinet ministers) dictating\nto the president what legislation he must approve; for in this case\nthere are (at least) two independently identifiable \ndecision-makers—each with its own point of view, each with its own power. The\ndifficulty in the case where the relevant powers are all within the\npsyche of a single individual agent is that there is no such\nindependently identifiable pair of standpoints in terms of which we can\ndistinguish the powers that bully this agent from the powers that can\nbe attributed to the agent herself. An account of the conditions under\nwhich an individual agent is bullied by her motives is, at the same\ntime, an account of what makes a motive external to the agent’s own\nstandpoint.) \n\nPhilosophers have proposed many different accounts of the autonomous\nagent’s special relation to her own motives. According to one\nprominent conception, which one might call\n“coherentist,” an agent governs her own action if\nand only if she is motivated to act as she does because this\nmotivation coheres with (is in harmony with) some mental state that\nrepresents her point of view on the action.  The relevant mental state\nvaries from account to account. According to one popular story, an\nagent’s point of view is constituted by her highest-order desires\nregarding which of her first-order desires moves her to\nact. (Frankfurt\n 1988c)[1] \nAccording to another story, her point of\nview is constituted by her (contemporaneous or long-term) evaluative\njudgments regarding which actions are (most) worth performing. (Watson\n 1975)[2] Still\nanother account adds that there must also be harmony between what the\nagent does and her more or less long-term plans (Bratman 1979 and\n2007).  And others appeal to the relatively stable network of\nemotional states constitutive of “caring” (Frankfurt 1988f\nand 1999d, Jaworska, Shoemaker\n 2003)[3]\n or to the agent’s character traits\n(Dworkin, R.), or to her most thoroughly “integrated”\npsychological states (Arpaly and Schroeder).\n \n\nAll these accounts reflect the intuition that an action cannot be\nattributed to the agent herself if, even as she performs this action,\nshe occupies a point of view from which she repudiates what she is\ndoing. More carefully, such an action cannot be the agent’s doing in\nthe way that it must be if it is to qualify as an instance of\nself-government. According to this intuition, if someone repudiates,\nor in some other way dissociates herself from, the causal efficacy of\nher own motives, then the power of these motives is independent of her\nauthority. If, on the other hand, she endorses these motives, whether\nimplicitly or explicitly, then her actions occur with her permission,\nif not necessarily at her command. Under what conditions does someone\ncount as endorsing or repudiating her motives?  Each account offers a\ndifferent answer to this question. \n\nNot only does there appear to be a tight conceptual connection between\nself-governing agency and synchronic psychic unity; there\nalso appears to be a connection between self-governing agency and\nthe diachronic unity of one’s later self with one’s earlier\nself. This is the connection central to accounts that identify\nself-governing agents with agents constrained by plans, or by\nwell-integrated emotions, or traits of character. Agents persist\nthrough time; and so, these accounts stress, an agent’s point of view\nis not simply a function of whatever mental state(s) she happens to be\nin at some point in time. Because an agent’s plans play a crucial role\nin ensuring that she is more than a mere collection or sequence of\nmental states, it is reasonable to think that whether her motives have\nher support depends on whether they are constrained by these plans.\nSo, too, it is reasonable to think that her stance toward her motives\nis determined by her long-term values and/or her relatively stable\ncommitments and cares.\n \n\nOn a strict coherentist conception of autonomy, autonomous agents can\nbe moved by desires they are helpless to resist: though an addict fails\nto govern herself if she would rather resist her irresistible urge to\ntake drugs, she is an autonomous agent if she has no objection to her\naddiction and its motivational effects. According to the coherentist,\nmoreover, both the origin and the content of a person’s higher-order\nattitudes (evaluative judgments, plans) are irrelevant to whether she\nis an autonomous agent. She need have done nothing to bring it about\nthat she has these attitudes; and the attitudes need not be especially\nrational or well-informed. Coherentist accounts are thus doubly\ninternalist. They express the intuition that whether we govern\nourselves depends on neither how we came to be who we are (a fact that\nis prior to (and in this sense external to) the action itself) nor how\nour beliefs and attitudes relate to reality (a fact that is independent\nof (and in this sense external to) the beliefs and attitudes\nthemselves). In other words, on these accounts, there need be no special\nrelation between our autonomy-constituting attitudes and either the\npast circumstances that caused these attitudes or the present\ncircumstances in response to which they move us to act. \n\nOther accounts of autonomy introduce conditions that are\nexternalist in one or both of these ways. According to those\nwho advocate a reasons-responsive conception of autonomous agency, an\nagent does not really govern herself unless her motives, or the mental\nprocesses that produce them, are responsive to a sufficiently wide\nrange of reasons for and against behaving as she\n does. (Fischer and Ravizza, Nelkin, \n Wolf)[4]\n On accounts\nof this type, an agent who is unresponsive to the reasons for\n“standing behind,” or “backing up,” certain\nmotives and not others is not in the proper position to authorize her\nown actions. Whether the relevant reasons are grounded in facts about\nher own desires and interests, or whether they have some independent\nsource, the idea is that someone is not qualified to govern herself if\nshe cannot understand what she (really) has reason to do, or (if this\nis a distinct handicap) is incapable of being moved by these reasons.\nIn effect, her exercise of authority is so ill-conceived that it is\npowerless to confer legitimacy on her motives. \n\nThe feature of these accounts that most distinguishes them from\ncoherentist accounts is the importance they attribute to an agent’s\nability to appreciate the reasons she has. (Once she appreciates these\nreasons, her inability to act accordingly is, essentially, the\ninability to conform her act to her own judgment, and to her\ncorresponding (higher-order) desire.) What, exactly, is the connection\nsupposed to be between being out of touch with (evaluative and/or\nnonevaluative) reality and failing to govern oneself? Clearly, a person\nwho fails to appreciate a wide range of reasons for action is unlikely\nto govern herself well: she is likely to do things that will,\nin the long run, thwart her own purposes and interests. The\nreasons-responsiveness conception of autonomy thus appears to\nreflect the intuition that when we do something very poorly, we do not\nreally do it at all. There is, however, another possible underlying\nrationale for regarding ignorance as a threat to self-government. If\ndoing Y is constitutive of doing Z, then if I\nauthorize myself to be moved by the desire to do Y because I\nmistakenly believe that doing Y is a way of not doing\nZ, then there is an obvious sense in which I have not\nauthorized myself to do what I am now doing when I am moved by the\ndesire to do Y. So, if I have a general desire to do what is\nright and prudent, or, even more generally, a desire to do what I can\njustify to myself (and others), or, more generally still, a desire to\nbe responsive to reasons, then insofar as I am moved to act in ways\nthat are, in fact, incompatible with satisfying these desires, there\nis a sense in which I—who am committed to doing only what I\nhave good (enough) reason to do—have not really authorized my\naction. Alternatively, we could say that, under these circumstances,\nsomething external to my power to guide myself by reasons has\nprevented me from exercising this power, and so has prevented me from\ngoverning\n myself.[5] \n\nAn additional source of support for the reasons-responsive\nconception of autonomy comes from the thought that someone who cannot\nrespond to the reasons there are must have a limited ability to reason.\nThis brings us to a third popular approach to autonomous \nagency—an approach that stresses the importance of the reasoning process\n itself (Christman 1991, 1993 and Mele 1993,\n 1995).[6]\n According to\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts, the essence of\nself-government is the capacity to evaluate one’s motives on the basis\nof whatever else one believes and desires, and to adjust these motives\nin response to one’s evaluations. It is the capacity to discern what\n“follows from” one’s beliefs and desires, and to act\naccordingly. One can exercise this capacity despite holding false\nbeliefs of all kinds about what one has reason to do. Accordingly, on\nthese accounts, being autonomous is not the same thing as being guided\nby correct evaluative and normative judgments. \n\nThe emphasis on an autonomous agent’s responsiveness to her own\nreasoning reflects the intuition that someone whose education consisted\nof a method of indoctrination that deprived her of the ability to call\nher own attitudes into question would, in effect, be governed by her\n“programmers,” not by herself. So, too, someone whose\npractical reasoning was directly manipulated by others would not govern\nherself by means of this reasoning. And so, it seems, she would have no\npower over the motives that this reasoning produced. \n\nLike the coherentists, advocates of responsiveness-to-reasoning\naccounts believe that the key to autonomous agency is the ability to\ndistance oneself from one’s attitudes and beliefs—to occupy a\nstandpoint that is not constituted by whatever mental states are moving\none to act. They agree that motives authorized from this reflective\nstandpoint are internal to the agent herself in a way that her other\nmotives are not. Unlike the coherentists, however, the\nreasoning-responsive theorists believe that there is more to the\ncapacity for self-reflection than the capacity to hold higher-order\nattitudes. The authority of our higher-order attitudes is grounded,\nthey claim, in the authority of the practical reasoning that supports\nthese attitudes. So a self-governing agent does not merely endorse her\nmotives: her endorsements are implicit claims about which motives have\nthe support of her reason. \n\nThis fact is closely tied to another. Like many accounts that stress\nan autonomous agent’s responsiveness to reasons, responsiveness-\nto-reasoning accounts often suggest that self-government requires the\ncapacity for self-transformation. On this assumption, an autonomous\nagent is someone who can change her mind when she discovers good reason\nto do\n so.[7]\n In contrast, strict coherentists insist that\nit is possible to act autonomously while being moved by desires that\nare not only irresistible when they produce their effects, but so\nintegral to one’s identity that one could not possibly will to resist\nthem.[8] \n\nThe conception of autonomous agency as responsiveness to reasoning\nclearly has a more internalist character than the conception of\nautonomous agency as responsiveness to reasons: according to those who\nstress the autonomous agent’s ability to evaluate her own motives, what\ncounts is not the relation between the agent’s attitudes and external\nreality, but her ability to draw inferences from what she wants and\nbelieves, and by so doing, to reconsider—to rationally reflect\nupon—her other desires and beliefs. Insofar, however, as a\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning account presupposes a particular conception\nof practical reasoning, it appeals to standards, or principles, that\nthe agent herself might misapply, or fail to recognize altogether.\nMoreover, even if advocates of autonomy as responsiveness-to-reasoning\nhave nothing in particular in mind when they speak of the process of\n“reflection,” “rational evaluation,” etc.,\nreasoning is a norm-governed process that an agent might reject for\nreasons of her own. Responsiveness to reasoning accounts thus contain\nan externalist element that is absent from strict coherentist accounts.\nThey imply that an agent can be mistaken about whether she is really\nreasoning—and so can be mistaken about whether the power of her\nmotives reflects the fact that she has the authority to determine her\nown actions. \n\nThis weak externalism naturally expands into more robust varieties.\nIn particular, it supports the idea that whether an agent’s reasoning\nis really her way of governing her actions depends on which\nforces exert a nonrational influence on this reasoning. Even when\nindoctrination and other more or less imaginary forms of “mind\ncontrol” do not prevent a person from reaching evaluative\nconclusions about her own motives, they can prevent her from thinking\nfor herself. So, too, it seems, someone in the grip of compulsion or\naddiction can be so dominated by this condition that whatever facts she\nconsiders, and whatever conclusions she draws, cannot legitimately be\nattributed to her. One way to interpret these cases is to say that the\nperson’s reasoning falls so far short of the norms of “rational\nreflection” that she is not really reasoning at all.\nAlternatively, one can say that her reasoning does not guarantee her\nautonomy because it is under the control of external forces. \n\nInsofar as accounts of autonomy simply stipulate that certain\ninfluences on an agent’s intention-forming process “interfere\nwith,” or “pervert,” this process, these accounts\nare incomplete. For they leave it mysterious why certain influences,\nand not others, are a threat to self-government. One response to this\nchallenge is offered by reasons-responsive accounts: according to this\nresponse, the autonomy-undermining influences are the ones that\nprevent the reasoning process from being sufficiently sensitive to the\nreasons there\n are.[9]\nAnother – compatible – response appeals to the\n“relational” aspects of autonomy: other agents can prevent\nsomeone’s reasoning from qualifying as a mode of self-government by\npreventing the reasoner from developing the self-respect and/or\nself-trust necessary for forming a point of view that is truly her\nown (Benson 1994, 2000, Mackenzie and Stoljar, Anderson and \n Honneth)[10].\n If an agent’s point of view does not reflect her respect for\nherself and for her ability to set her own ends and assess the reasons\nrelevant to pursuing some ends and not others, then the direction her\nreasoning takes cannot be attributed to her.  (Though relational\naccounts of autonomy highlight the extent to which an agent’s capacity\nto govern herself depends on her interactions with other agents, it is\nimportant to note that self-respect and self-trust can also be\nundermined by experiences or psychological conditions that do not\ninvolve the actions of anyone else.) \nA fourth conception of personal autonomy offers a very different\nresponse to the challenge of distinguishing (i) the determining causes\nthat prevent an agent from governing herself when she employs her\nreason from (ii) the causes that determine how an agent governs\nherself when she reasons.  According to this incompatibilist\nconception, each of these influences undermines the agent’s autonomy;\ncases of mind control simply call our attention to the fact that\nwhenever our motives are causally determined by events over which we\nhave no control, their power does not reflect our\nauthority. (Pereboom) According to incompatibilists, if our actions\ncan be fully explained as the effects of causal powers that are\nindependent of us, then even if our beliefs and attitudes are among\nthese effects, we do not govern them, and so we do not govern\nourselves. (Kane 1996 and van Inwagen\n1983)[11] \n\nIncompatibilist accounts of autonomy take many subtly different\nforms. So do the three other (compatibilist) accounts mentioned here.\nSome of the differences reflect disagreements over the extent to which\nthe relevant conditions—coherence among higher- and\nlower-order attitudes, responsiveness to reasons, responsiveness to\nreasoning, freedom from determination by external causes—must\nactually obtain when an agent determines her will, or whether it is\nenough that under certain specified circumstances the\nagent would relate to her motives in the stipulated manner.\nThere is also a difference of opinion about the scope of the relevant\ncapacities: Must an autonomous agent be capable of responding to a\nwide range of reasons for and against her action? or is it enough that\nher motives are responsive to the “strongest,” “most\ncompelling” reasons? and can these reasons include the sort of\ncredible threats that figure in cases of coercion? What range of\nattitudes must an autonomous agent be capable of calling into\nquestion?  How well must she be capable of reasoning? Does it matter\nwhether she is guided by certain principles of rationality? Must it be\npossible for her to draw different conclusions on the basis of the\nreasons she considers? Is it essential that she could have considered\na different set of reasons instead? \n\nThere are even disagreements over whether the reasons to which\nself-governing agents respond are, as most assume, practical\nconsiderations concerning what to do, or what is worth doing. It has\nbeen suggested that agents govern their actions by engaging in\ntheoretical reasoning to the end of forming beliefs about which modes\nof behavior they could explain, given their desires. (Velleman) This suggestion\nstresses the extent to which governing oneself involves deferring to\npsychic demands whose power is independent of one’s authority. On this\npicture, an agent exercises authority over what she does only once she\nis faced with a set of possible actions, whose possibility reflects\ntheir compatibility with the causal power of her desires: in predicting\nthat she will perform one of these actions, she authorizes this action,\nand thereby strengthens her motives for performing\n it.[12] \n\nThis way of interpreting the link between autonomous agency and\nresponsiveness to reasons raises larger questions about the\nrelationship between our practical impulses and our reason.  The\nanswers to these questions, and to those mentioned above can be\ncombined in many different ways.  Not only, moreover, can each\napproach thus take a wide variety of forms, but the approaches\nthemselves can (and often do) figure together as necessary or\nsufficient conditions in a single complex account. \n\nAll the proposals just considered contribute to our understanding\nof the various roles that agents can play in their\nown actions. They articulate various ideals that agents can realize to\nvarious degrees when they act. In so doing, they shed light on how,\nwith the proper training, a very young child, whose deference to the\nauthority of her own judgments is little more than the form of\nself-government, can develop into an exemplary self-governing agent. \n\nThis is a very important contribution. Nonetheless, it falls short\nof giving us everything we have reason to expect from an account of\npersonal autonomy. In particular, challenges to the different\napproaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the\nminimal conditions under which a person’s exercise of authority over\nhow she behaves reflects her own power to determine how\nshe exercises this authority. Minimal self-government seems to\nrequire nothing more nor less than being the power behind whatever\nreasoning directly gives rise to one’s behavior. Yet none of the\naccounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most\nbasic, form of self-government. Nor, it seems, does any combination of\nthese accounts. \n\nThe worry that the coherence of one’s contemporaneous attitudes does\nnot suffice for even minimal self-government is grounded in the\napparent possibility that a person could be brainwashed, or otherwise\ncompelled, to endorse a given motive. Indeed, her brain could be\nmanipulated in such a way that each of her endorsements is highly\nresponsive to reasons. This has led some philosophers to supplement\ncoherentist accounts of autonomy with additional conditions that place\nconstraints on the causal history of an agent’s endorsements,\nconstraints of the very sort singled out in the\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts. These supplements face a\nsignificant challenge, however: it is very difficult to spell out the\ndistinction between autonomy-conferring reasoning and\nautonomy-undermining reasoning without implicitly appealing to\nthe very phenomenon one is trying to explain. \n\nEven if historical approaches to autonomy can successfully overcome\nthis difficulty, they do nothing to address the fact that coherence is\nnot even necessary for autonomous agency. An agent need not sacrifice\nher autonomy in order to decide to act contrary to her long-term\ncommitments and concerns; acting “out of character” is not\na sufficient condition for failing to govern oneself.  Though a\n“weak-willed” agent is hardly a paradigm example of\nsomeone who governs herself when she acts, she too plays a decisive\nrole in the relative power of her own motives; she authorizes her\nbehavior, even though she believes that she has good reason to act\notherwise. It is notoriously difficult to make sense of such an\nexercise of\n authority.[13] \nFor our purposes here, however, it\nsuffices to note that if weakness of will is a genuine phenomenon,\nthen human agents have the capacity to govern themselves in a way that\nthey themselves take to be unjustified. They can assert an authority\nover themselves that challenges the authority of their very own\nreason. \n\nOf course, someone whose action is caused in this way does not\ngovern herself as thoroughly as someone whose will is\n“strong”; she acts for a reason that she herself deems\ninadequate; and so she is not (adequately) governed by the norms of her\nown thought. Nonetheless, even under these conditions, the desires that\nmove her to act do so on her own authority. To use what is perhaps the\nmost important metaphor in the literature on personal autonomy, the\nweak-willed agent “identifies with” her motives in whatever\nway she must in order to be accountable for their effects. It is not\nsimply that what she does is the result of an earlier autonomous\naction. Rather, her accountability is grounded in her contemporaneous\nrelation to what she is doing. \nThe possibility of weakness of will points to the more general fact\nthat an agent’s authorization of her own motives need not take the\nform of the judgment that it would not be better to act otherwise.\nVarious forms of perversity are perfectly compatible with autonomous\nagency.  Some philosophers believe that it is also possible for agents\nto defy their own contemporaneous normative verdicts without defying\nanything very deep about themselves. A woman, for example, may\nconclude that even though she has an overriding reason to give up her\nchild for adoption, she cannot recognize herself in this action, and\nso cannot identify with the desire to perform\n it.[14]\nReasonable people will surely disagree about how best to interpret any\nparticular example. But human experience does seem to support the\ngeneral point: the human capacity for self-reflection enables human\nagents to distance themselves in thought from every aspect of their\nown psyches—even their rational reflections. Given this\npossibility, a person’s identification with her motives cannot be\ncashed out in terms of higher-order attitudes of approval and\ndisapproval, or in terms of the rational reflections that typically\nground these attitudes. \n\nSimilar concerns are raised by the appeal to plans. Though plans\noften enable a person to exercise some measure of control over her life\nas a whole, a person can govern herself at a particular time even while\ndefying her earlier attempts to place constraints on how she will\ngovern herself at this time. She can take it upon herself to abandon\nher plans, or to modify them in ways she did not anticipate when she\nfirst made them. She can even reject the counsel of the long-term\nvalues that provide the underlying rationale for these plans. \n\nReflections along these lines have led some to conclude that we are\nbound to come up empty-handed as long as we think of an agent’s\nidentification with her motives as a self-relation she is responsible\nfor securing. For, as long as we take this approach, we appear to be\nstuck with the question: under what conditions does the agent govern\nher identification with some motive? what conditions must she satisfy\nin order to identify with the motives that move her to identify with\nsome of her motives and not others? under what conditions does she\nauthorize the attitudes and/or mental activities that issue in a given\nlower-order authorization? If we are to escape the regress such\nquestions evoke, it seems that there must be an attitude that can be\nidentified with the agent’s point of view simply by virtue of being the\nattitude it is; there must be an attitude from which no agent can\npossibly be alienated. To be sure, if—like most animals—rational \nagents could not distance themselves from their own motives,\nthen they would be incapable of governing themselves. Self-government\nrequires two points of view: that of the governing authority, and that\nof the governed. Nonetheless, if there is to be an end to the potential\nregress of identifications, it seems that there must also be a limit to\nthe capacity for self-alienation. \n\nAs we have seen, no such limitation seems to apply where the mental\nstate at stake is an agent’s highest-order desire, evaluative\njudgment, or plan, or even an integrated combination of such\nattitudes. The only attitude from which it seems that no agent can be\nalienated is the desire to have sufficient power to determine one’s\nown motives—the desire to be a self-governing\n agent.[15]\n Even if, however, we leave to one side the\nquestion of whether this desire can really be attributed to every\npotentially self-governing agent, it does not seem to be an adequate\nbasis for distinguishing motives whose power can be attributed to the\nagent herself from motives that are not in this sense internal. For if\na desire underlies every action performed by a potentially\nself-governing agent, then it plays a causal role even when an agent\nfails to govern her motives in the minimal way necessary to be\naccountable for them. It thus cannot be the key to any account of what\nis special about self-governing \n agency[16].\n \n\nPerhaps there is no attitude to which we can point in order to\ndistinguish between cases in which the power of an agent’s motives can\nbe directly attributed to her and cases in which her authority\nover her motives is a mere formality. If so, then this might seem to be\na reason to favor accounts that tie autonomous agency to the agent’s\nresponsiveness to reasons. Unfortunately, however, these accounts have\nproblems of their own. Most importantly, it seems as though a person\ncan govern herself even if she does not understand the significance of\nwhat she is doing. To be sure, if someone’s ignorance is perfectly\nreasonable, then she may not be to blame if she does something wrong.\nBut under such circumstances, what frees her from blame is the fact\nthat she has good reason to be ignorant. There appears to be no basis\nfor assuming that, in addition to lacking certain relevant information,\nshe is not really the (ill-informed) power behind her authorization of\nher action. \n\nIn killing Desdemona, Othello fails to accomplish his aim of doing\nwhat he has good reason to do. But this does not prevent him from\nbeing the author of his own actions. Nor would he necessarily have\nbeen prevented from governing himself if, given his character and\ncircumstances, he had been unable to “track” the\nevaluative and nonevaluative facts: he would still have been\naccountable for what he did if his reason for doing it had been that\nhe was too jealous, or too stubborn, or too vain, or too hot-tempered\nto be capable of responding to the wide range of reasons against\nbelieving that his wife was unfaithful to him—and the wide\nrange of reasons against killing her even if she was\n unfaithful.[17]\n More carefully, to\ninsist that he would not have been accountable under these\ncircumstances, we must abandon the assumption that autonomous agency is\npossible even if all actions can, in principle, be explained in terms\nof deterministic laws of nature. In other words, we must accept the\nincompatibilist thesis that if a person’s character is the product of\nforces over which he never had any control, and if his character traits\ndetermine his choices, then even if his motives are responsive to\nreasons, he is not responsible for their motivating force. \n\nThe preceding reflections call attention to how difficult it is to\ndistinguish the conditions of ideal self-government from the\nconditions under which one is sufficiently self-governing to be\nresponsible for the motivating power of one’s desires. The difficulty\nis manifested in the fact that as soon as we try to pin down the\nminimal, threshold conditions of autonomous agency, we seem to\ncome up against the conditions necessary for agency\nitself. \n\nConsider, for example, an alleged paradigm case of an agent who fails\nto govern herself: a person who takes drugs even though she would\nrather resist the motivating force of her addiction. It is widely\nagreed that, even if many people who fit this description are merely\nweak-willed, not all of them are: some unwilling addicts are not\nself-governing in even the minimal sense. According to coherentist and\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts, this is because such addicts\nare, in effect, “passive bystanders” to their own\nmotives. But even if we could find a satisfactory account of the\nrelevant passivity, this diagnosis would be problematic. For it\nassimilates the addict to someone whose behavior does not even qualify\nas an action—someone, e.g., with Tourette’s Syndrome,\nwhose verbal outbursts and bodily movements are not\neven voluntary. It thus fails to shed light on the conditions\nunder which someone acts—intentionally, even \ndeliberately—without being accountable for what she does. (The same problem\narises for the proposal that autonomous agents differ from other\nagents in virtue of their special way of understanding what they are\nup to.  Regardless of whether someone governs her intentional actions,\nshe knows what she is doing without having to observe her behavior.\nIf someone had to observe her own behavior in order to discover what\nshe was up to, then this behavior would not qualify as her action.)\n \n\nIf someone’s motives directly defy her attempt to exercise authority\nover her actions, then their power is not only independent of her\nauthority; they bypass her agency altogether. Even if under these\nconditions a person can acknowledge that there is something to be said\nfor behaving as she does, she is as alienated from the power of her own\nmotives as she is from the power of the physiological states that\nproduce her reflex movements. She is not an autonomous agent because\nshe is not an agent at \n all[18].\n \n\nOf course, there is a sense in which the addict, but not the victim\nof Tourette’s, is responsive to reasons. But even if we could spell out\nthis distinction in a satisfactory way, we still face the problem of\nexplaining why an agent’s capacity to respond to external reality is\nrelevant to her capacity to govern herself. And there are other\nproblems too. If, for example, nonaction differs from action in virtue\nof being unresponsive to reasons, then it follows that nonrational\nanimals never really act, or that acting from instinct is acting for\nreasons. It is not clear what considerations could overcome the\nimplausibility of these implications. \n\nEven nonautonomous rational agents authorize the motivating\npower of the desires that move them to act. Yet there is an important\nsense in which the power behind their authorizations is not their own.\nWhat does the relevant impotence amount to? The incompatibilist, we\nsaw, has a ready answer: an agent is prevented from exercising any\npower over her behavior when her authorization of this behavior can be\ntraced to the determining influence of external powers. According to\nthe incompatibilist, if the unwilling addict fails to govern herself,\nthis is because her motives are determined by past states of affair\nover which she does not have (and never did have) any control. And if a\nwilling addict’s motives have a similar genesis, then she,\ntoo, is not accountable for their motivating power. \n\nThe familiar problem with this answer is that there seems to be no way\nfor an agent to gain an extra measure of control over her motives\nsimply by acquiring attitudes or judgments or other mental states that\nare not determined by anything else. If someone’s attitude toward her\nmotives is not determined by any earlier state of affairs, then how\ncan it be determined by her? This question pushes some with\nincompatibilist intuitions to attribute a special causal power to\nagents—a power of agency, which is not reducible to the effect\none event has on another. On this view, a person can\n“agent-cause” a certain response to earlier events in a\nway that is not itself the effect of these earlier events. (Chisholm,\nClarke, O’Connor, Taylor, R.) She can bring it about that she is\nmotivated in a certain way, without anything determining her to do so.\nThus, her power over her actions cannot be reduced to the power of\nexternal motivating\n forces.[19] \n\nSuch accounts of autonomous agency take seriously the need to\ndistinguish an agent’s power from the power of the psychic forces that\npush and pull her. Yet the obscurities of the special sort of causation\nthey evoke are enough to prevent most philosophers from embracing this\nconception of autonomous agency. To mention just a few familiar\nchallenges: If agent-causing an event does not involve doing something\nto bring it about that the event occurs, then how does the agent exert\nher causal power? and why does this power produce its effects at one\ntime rather than another? If, on the other hand, an agent must do\nsomething in order to agent-cause an action, then doesn’t this require\nthat she undergo some change? and isn’t this change of state itself an\nevent? \n\nOn the basis of these and other difficulties, many conclude that the\nappeal to agent-causation provides no more insight into autonomy than\nthe simple assertion that we can sometimes govern the causal efficacy\nof our own motives. Incompatibilists who are sympathetic with this\ncomplaint nonetheless insist that even if an agent’s causal power must\nbe understood in terms of the causal relations among events, autonomous\nagency is possible only if the conditions that immediately give rise to\nan agent’s intention need not suffice to produce it. If, they argue, an\nagent cannot authorize a given action without being determined to do so\nby powers beyond her control, then autonomous agency is an illusion. If\nour every action is an event in a deterministic causal chain, then we\nauthorize our actions only in the sense that a figurehead authorizes\nthe decisions she is forced to sign. Indeed, unlike a political puppet,\nwe do not even have the option of \n defiance[20].\n \nOthers see things differently, however. They argue that the\nincompatibilist’s conclusion reflects a misunderstanding of the very\nnature of rational agency. In making their case, they take their lead\nfrom the philosopher who has contributed more than any other to our\nunderstanding of autonomy. Kant, they note, stresses the deep\ndifferences between the two points of view from which we can think\nabout ourselves and our\n world.[21]\n We take up the\ntheoretical point of view in order to gain knowledge about the\nnature of reality, and on this basis make predictions about which\neffects will follow from which causes. When we want to make up our\nminds about what to do, however, we take up the practical\npoint of view. From this point of view, too, we survey the facts that\nare relevant to our decisions. But since none of these facts, taken\nsingly or together, is intrinsically action-guiding, they cannot free\nus from the task of drawing our own conclusions about what we have\nreason to do. (Korsgaard, Bok) \nThis is true, the neo-Kantians point out, even if our decisions are\nthe effect of causal powers over which we have no control. Since no\nfacts of which we could possibly become aware can force us to attribute\nany particular significance to them, and since in order to decide what\nto do, we must attribute some significance to the facts of which we are\naware (even if this involves taking them to have no significance at\nall), our decisions are “up to us.” According to those who press this\nline of argument, our authority over our own actions would not be\nillusory even if our mode of exercising it were causally determined by\nevents or states of affairs over which we have no control. Even under\nthese circumstances, no events or states of affairs would have the\npower to determine what we have reason to do. So even under\nthese circumstances, we have to reach our own conclusions on this point\nand acting accordingly. (Note that since this argument relies on the\nconnection between determining what we have reason to do and\ndetermining what we will do, it can also be endorsed by those\nwho take acting for reasons to involve responding to theoretical\nreasons. Indeed, there is a loose sense in which an agent’s point of\nview is “practical” as long as the truth of her predictions\ndepends on the fact that she makes them.) \n\nThese last observations take us back to where we started. The\npolitical demand to be permitted to govern ourselves is grounded in the\nmetaphysics of agency: any agent who faces the task of “making up\nher mind” has the authority to determine how she will act. On\nmost occasions, what an agent does is the direct effect of her exercise\nof this authority. Yet there is also ample evidence that the capacity\nfor self-government is vulnerable to any number of assaults; an agent’s\nauthority over her actions is no guarantee that she has the power to\ndetermine how she exercises this authority. Agents can be deprived of\ntheir autonomy by brainwashing, depression, anxiety, fatigue; they can\nsuccumb to compulsions and addictions. To what, exactly, are we calling\nattention when we say that, under these conditions, an agent does not\ngovern herself, even if she acts as she does because she thinks she has\nsufficient reason to do so, even if she has (thoroughly) considered the\npros and cons of her options, and has endorsed her behavior on this\nbasis, and even if she would have acted differently if there had been\nstronger reason to do so? Most agents who are capable of asking this\nquestion are confident that they are the authors of most of their\nactions, and are thus accountable for most of what they do. Nonetheless, as\nthis brief survey indicates, the self-relation they thereby attribute\nto themselves is extremely difficult to pin \n down.[22]","contact.mail":"westlund@uwm.edu","contact.domain":"uwm.edu"}]
