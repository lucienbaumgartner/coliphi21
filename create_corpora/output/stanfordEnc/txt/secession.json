Two factors may explain why philosophers have now begun\nto turn their attention to secession. First, in the past two decades\nthere has been a great increase not only in the number of attempted\nsecessions, but also in successful secessions, and philosophers may\nsimply be reacting to this new reality, attempting to make normative\nsense of it. The reasons for the frequency of attempts to secede are\ncomplex, but there are two recent developments that make the prospect\nof state-breaking more promising: improvement in national security and\nliberalization of trade. As the fear of forcible annexation diminishes\nand trade barriers fall, smaller states become feasible, and\nindependent statehood looks more feasible for regions within states.\nSecond, in roughly the same time period, the idea that there is a\nstrong case for some form of self-government for groups presently\ncontained within states has gained ground. Once one begins to take\nseriously the case for special group rights for\nminorities—especially if these include rights of\nself-government—it is difficult to avoid the question of whether\nsome such groups may be entitled to full independence. \n\nPolitical scientists, sociologists, and political economists attempt\nto describe and explain the causes and effects of secessionist\nmovements and of states’ reactions to them. Philosophers focus on the\nmoral issues and on clarifying the conceptual framework for thinking\nabout secession. Philosophical work on secession can be divided into\nthree categories: (1) attempts to articulate the conditions under\nwhich a group has the moral right to secede; (2) examinations of the\ncompatibility or incompatibility of secession with constitutionalism,\n(3) attempts to determine what position international law should take\nregarding secession. Thus far, philosophical theories of secession\nhave not been integrated with two areas of normative theorizing that\nare directly relevant to them. The first is just war theory. This is\nsurprising, since part of what motivates systematic thinking about\nsecession is a realization that attempts to secede often involve or\nprovoke large-scale violence. The second is theories of territorial\njustice. This, too, is surprising, because ideally a theory of\nsecession would be situated within a broader normative theory of a\nrange of claims to territory, including, but not limited to claims to\nsovereign jurisdiction of the sort now associated with statehood.  \nIt is useful to distinguish secession from other ways in which\n“separation” or “state-breaking” can occur. In\nwhat might be called secession in the classic sense, a group in a\nportion of the territory of a state attempt to create a new state\nthere; secessionists attempt to exit, leaving behind the original\nstate in reduced form. Second, there is irredentist secession, wherein\nthe attempt is not to create a new state, but to merge the seceding\nterritory with a neighboring state. This typically occurs when the\nmajority in the seceding area are of the same ethno-national as that\nwhich is predominant in the neighboring state. A third case,\nexemplified by the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, occurs when there is\nagreement between the populations or at least the leaders of two\nregions (which together comprise the whole territory of the state), to\nsplit the state into two new states. A fourth case is that of\nexternally-imposed partition of an existing state into two or more new\nstates. In the past partition usually occurred when a deal was struck\nbetween two powerful neighboring states at the expense of the state\nthat was partitioned, as with the partitioning of Poland between Nazi\nGermany and the Soviet Union. At present, externally-imposed partition\nis more likely to be considered as a last resort for dealing with\nintractable ethno-national conflict within a state. In what follows,\nthe focus is on secession in the classical sense, but with some\nattention also to irredentist secession. \nThough many who pursue the first project do not make this explicit,\nthey are concerned with the moral justification of unilateral\nsecession or the moral right to secede unilaterally, that is with\nsecession that is undertaken without the consent of the state and\nwithout constitutional sanction. A theory of the right to unilateral\nsecession is most urgently needed, not only because unilateral\nsecession occurs more frequently than consensual secession, but also\nbecause it is both more controversial and more likely to result in\nlarge-scale violence.  \nConsensual secession is secession that results either from a\nnegotiated agreement between the state and the secessionists (as\noccurred when Norway seceded from Sweden in 1905) or through\nconstitutional processes (as the Supreme Court of Canada recently\nenvisioned for the secession of\n Quebec).[1]\n Constitutionally sanctioned secession is achieved either by the\nexercise of an explicit constitutional right to secede (which only a\nfew constitutions currently contain) or by constitutional\namendment. \nSometimes it is not clear whether a theorist is advancing a theory of\nthe conditions under which secession is morally justified, that is,\nthe conditions under which a group has a moral liberty-right or mere\nmoral permission to secede, or a theory of the conditions under which\na group has the claim-right to secede. Talk about “the right to\nsecede” is ambiguous between these alternatives. A claim-right\nincludes not only a liberty-right or mere permission (i.e., that a\ngroup is justified in seceding in the sense that if they do so they do\nnot thereby act impermissibly), but also a correlative obligation on\nthe part of others not to interfere with the attempted secession. \nThe distinction between establishing that a group is morally justified\nin (unilaterally) seceding (in the sense of having a liberty-right)\nand establishing that the group has a moral claim-right to secede\n(unilaterally) is crucial, though rarely explicitly drawn by\nphilosophers writing about secession. Having the liberty-right does\nnot imply having the claim-right: A group might be morally justified\nin seceding and yet it might not be the case that others (including\nthe state from which the group is seceding) are obligated to refrain\nfrom interfering with the group’s attempt to secede. Therefore, an\nargument that suffices to establish that a group is justified in\nseceding under such and such conditions may not suffice to establish\nthat the group has a (claim-) right to secede under those conditions.\nYet when philosophers attempt to develop a moral theory of secession\nby appealing to intuitions about hypothetical examples of secession,\nit is often unclear whether the intuition elicited is about the moral\njustifiability of the secession (the mere permissibility) or about the\nexistence of a moral\n claim-right.\n  \nSome philosophers have distinguished between the question whether and,\nif so, under what conditions a group has a moral claim-right to secede\nand the question of whether and, if so, under what conditions a\nconstitution ought to or may include a right to secede. For example,\nwhile acknowledging that secession may sometimes be morally justified\n(where this presumably means the group in question has the claim-right\nto secede), Cass Sunstein has argued that constitutional recognition\nof a right to secede is incompatible with the principles of\nconstitutionalism (or at least democratic\n constitutionalism)[2]\n (Sunstein 1991). Sunstein argues that a basic principle of\nconstitutionalism is that political institutions, including the\nconstitution itself, must be designed so as to encourage citizens to\nengage in the hard work of democratic politics, where this means\ncompeting in the public forum on grounds of principle, with a minimum\nof strategic bargaining. Following Albert O. Hirschman (1970), he then\ncontends that if the constitution acknowledges a right to secede then\ndiscontent minorities will be tempted to shirk the hard work of\nprincipled, democratic politics either by actually seceding when the\nmajoritarian decisions go against their preferences or by using the\nthreat of secession as a strategic bargaining tool as a de facto veto\nover majority rule. In either case, democracy will be undermined. \nHowever, as argued Buchanan (1991: 132), Sunstein fails even to\nconsider the possibility that a constitution could so hedge the right\nto secede as to reduce the threat of exit by minorities to acceptable\nproportions. The analogy here is with the right of constitutional\namendment as found in the United States Constitution. This right is\nsignificantly hedged: two super-majorities, one in the Congress, the\nother among the States, are required for amendment. Similarly, an\nappropriately hedged right to secede is not incompatible with the\nprinciples of constitutionalism: Well-designed procedural hurdles\n(super-majorities, waiting periods, etc.) can make secession\nsufficiently difficult to avoid an unacceptable risk of premature exit\nor strategic bargaining by minorities, while still making secession\npossible under appropriate conditions. The current Ethiopian\nConstitution in fact includes such a hedged right to secede, requiring\nnot only two super-majorities in favor of secession, but also a\nwaiting period. So although appropriate constitutional design\nregarding secession must cope with the risks that secession will\nimpair democratic processes, constitutional recognition of a right to\nsecede does not appear to be incompatible with constitutionalism. \nWayne Norman goes further, arguing that there are significant\nadvantages to constitutionalizing conflicts over secession (Norman\n2003). The Supreme Court of Canada recently took the same position,\narguing that the potentially disruptive process of secession by Quebec\ncan be subjected to the rule of law by a process of negotiation and\nconstitutional\n amendment.[3] \nThere is yet another argument for including a right to secede in a\nconstitution. In some cases, when a new political entity is being\ncreated out of two or more independent or semi-autonomous entities,\nincluding a right to exit in the constitution of the new entity may be\nnecessary as an inducement to join the new union. Under conditions of\nuncertainty as to how the new union will work, constitutional\nrecognition of a “bail out” option may be necessary to get\nthe new union\n going[4]\n (Buchanan 1991: ch. 4).  \nThere is much philosophical work to be done on the question of when\nand if so how the right to secede might be constitutionalized. It will\nrequire both an account of the principles of constitutionalism and of\nthe morality of secession and an empirically-based knowledge of the\nconditions under which various constitutional arrangements can be\nreasonably expected to realize the principles of constitutionalism in\na manner that is consistent with the morality of secession. \nIn the philosophical literature a distinction is drawn between two\ntheories of the right to secede (understood as a unilateral\nclaim-right): Remedial Right Only Theories and Primary Right\n Theories.[5]\n Remedial Right Only Theories analogize the right to secede to the\nright to revolution, understanding it as a right that a group comes to\nhave only as a result of violations of other rights. On this view\nsecession is justified only as a remedy of last resort for persistent\nand serious injustices. The right to unilateral secession thus\nunderstood is not primary, but rather derivative upon the violation of\nother, more basic rights; hence the label ‘remedial right\nonly’. Sometimes the term “Just Cause Theories” is\nused to refer to Remedial Right Only Theories and the term\n“Choice Theories” to refer to Primary Right Theories. \nDifferent versions of Remedial Right Only Theories specify different\nlists of the injustices that can ground the remedial right. Consider,\nfor example, a Remedial Right Only Theory that includes among the\ngrounds for the (unilateral) right to secede the following: (a)\nlarge-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights, (b)\nunjust taking of the territory of a legitimate state (where secession\nis simply the taking back of wrongly taken territory, as with the\nsecession of the Baltic Republics from the Soviet Union in 1991), and\n(c) in certain cases, the state’s persisting violation of agreements\nto accord a minority group limited self-government within the state\n(Buchanan 2004). A more austere Remedial Right Only Theory would\nrecognize only (a), persistent, large-scale violations of basic human\nrights (in the most extreme case, genocide or other mass killings) as\nsufficient to justify unilateral\n secession.[6] \nPrimary Right Theories of the unilateral right to secede recognize\nthat a group can have a right to secede on remedial grounds, but they\ncontend that the (unilateral) right to secede can exist even when the\ngroup has not been subject to any injustice. This second type of\ntheory thus holds that there is a right to unilateral secession over\nand above whatever remedial and hence derivative right there may be.\n \nPrimary Right Theories are of two types: Ascriptivist (predominantly\nnationalist) Theories and Plebiscitary (or majoritarian) Theories. The\nformer hold that certain groups whose memberships are defined by what\nare sometimes called ascriptive characteristics, simply by virtue of\nbeing those sorts of groups, have a unilateral (claim-)right to\nsecede. Ascriptive characteristics are those that are ascribed to\nindividuals independently of their choice and include being of the\nsame nation or being a “distinct people”. The most common\nform of Ascriptivist theory holds that nations as such have a right of\nself-determination that includes the right to secede in order to have\ntheir own state. \nPlebiscitary Theories in contrast hold that a unilateral moral\nclaim-right to secede exists if a majority residing in a portion of\nthe state chooses to have their own state there, regardless of whether\nor not they have any common characteristics, ascriptive or otherwise,\nother than the desire for independence. They need not be co-nationals\nor members of a distinct society.  \nWhat the two types of Primary Right Theories have in common is that\nthey do not require injustice as a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a unilateral (claim-)right to secede. They are Primary\nRight Theories because they do not make the unilateral (claim-)right\nto secede derivative upon the violation of other, more basic rights,\nas the Remedial Right Only Theories\n do.[7] \nNo attempt will be made here to provide a comprehensive comparative\nevaluation of these rival theories (see Buchanan 1997). Instead we\nwill only identify only their major strength and weaknesses.  \nAs Lea Brilmayer has rightly stressed, secession is not simply the\nformation of a new political association among individuals or the\nrepudiation by a group of persons of their obligation to obey the\nstate’s laws (Brilmayer 1991). It is the taking of a part of the\nterritory claimed by an existing state. Accordingly, rival theories of\nsecession must be understood as providing alternative accounts of what\nit takes for a group to come to have a claim to territory that is at\nthe time included in the territory of an existing state. We discover\nbelow that the most serious objections to the two varieties of Primary\nRight Theories question the cogency of their accounts of exactly what\nit is that gives a group within this state a claim to a portion of the\nterritory claimed by the state. In contrast, the Remedial Right Only\napproach appears to provide a more cogent account of the\nsecessionists’ claim to territory.  \nThis approach to unilateral secession recognizes at least two ways a\ngroup can have the requisite valid claim to territory: (a) by\nreclaiming territory over which they were sovereign but which was\nunjustly taken from them (as with the Baltic Republics’ secession from\nthe Soviet Union in 1991); or (b) by coming to have a claim to\nsovereignty over the territory as a result of availing themselves of a\nlast resort remedy against serious and persistent violations of basic\nhuman rights. A more expansive reading of (b) would include among the\ninjustices that can ground a unilateral right to secede, not only the\nviolation of basic human rights, but also the state’s major violations\nof, or unilateral revocation of, intrastate autonomy agreements (as\nwith Milosovic’s destruction of Kosovo’s autonomy in 1989). \nWith respect to (a), the basis of the secessionists’ claim to\nterritory is straightforward: they are simply reclaiming what was\nrecognized by international law as theirs. With respect to (b) the\nRemedial Right Only Theory begins with the presumption that existing\nstates that are accorded legitimacy under international law have valid\nclaims to their territories but then argues that such claims can be\noverridden or extinguished in the face of persistent patterns of\nserious injustices towards groups within the state. The idea is that\nthe validity of the state’s claim to the territory cannot be sustained\nwhen secession is the only remedy that can assure that the fundamental\nrights of the group will be respected. \nGiven the tendency for unilateral secession to provoke massive\nviolence, the obvious strength of the Remedial Right Only approach is\nthat it places a significant constraint on unilateral\nsecession—namely, the requirement of a serious and persistent\ngrievance of injustice suffered by the secessionists. To that extent,\nit captures the intuition that nonconsensual state-breaking, like\nrevolution, is a grave affair requiring a weighty justification. More\nspecifically, this view provides a plausible explanation of how the\nstate can come to lose its entitlement to the territory: it does so by\nfailing to do what gives states a moral claim to control territory in\nthe first place, namely, providing justice for those within its\njurisdiction. \nAnother strength of the Remedial Right Only approach is that it\nappears to provide the right incentives: States that are just (or at\nleast do not persist in very serious injustices) are immune to legally\npermitted unilateral secession and entitled to international support\nin maintaining their territorial integrity. On the other hand, if, as\nthe theory recommends, a unilateral right to secede as a remedy for\nserious and persistent injustices is acknowledged, this will give\nstates an incentive to act more justly. \nSome critics have complained that the Remedial Right Only approach to\nunilateral secession is disturbingly irrelevant to the concerns of\nmany groups seeking self-determination. They say that in most cases it\nis nationalism that fuels the quest for self-determination, not\ngrievances of injustice per se (Moore 1998a). An advocate of the\nRemedial Right Only view might respond that the latter is only an\naccount of unilateral secession, not a comprehensive theory of\nself-determination. Thus the Remedial Right Only approach to\nunilateral secession is compatible with a fairly permissive stance\ntoward intrastate autonomy, including various forms of self-government\nfor national minorities within the state. The point is to uncouple the\nunilateral (claim-)right to secede from the various legitimate\ninterests that groups—including national minorities—can\nhave in various forms of self-determination short of statehood. \nMoreover, the Remedial Right Only approach need not reject claims to\nindependence on the part of nations; it only rejects the much stronger\nassertion that nations as such have a unilateral right to secede. In\nmany cases the groups that suffer persistent grave injustices are in\nfact nations, and therefore would be accorded the right to secede by\nthe Remedial Right Only Theory. To that extent it is inaccurate to say\nthat this type of theory ignores the realities of national\nself-determination movements. But just as important, the Remedial\nRight Only Theory, when integrated into a comprehensive theory of\nself-determination that includes a principled account of when\nintrastate autonomy arrangements warrant international support, will\naddress the concerns of national minorities in cases in which they do\nnot have a unilateral right to secede. \nWhat the Remedial Right Only approach does not do is concede that\nnations as such—independently of any persisting pattern of grave\ninjustices—have a unilateral right to secede. But it can be\nargued that this is a virtue of the account, not a defect. It thereby\navoids the objection to which Ascriptivist Theories are vulnerable,\nnamely, that they endorse a unilateral right to secede for all nations\nin a world in which virtually every state contains more than one\nnation and in which nations are not neatly sorted into discrete\nregions of the state’s territory, but instead claim the same\nterritories. The point is not simply that the Ascriptivist view is\nunfeasible; in addition its support for the idea of the ethnically\nexclusive state is an incitement to ethnic cleansing if not genocide.\nHowever, this line of argument can supply an effective reply to the\nobjection that Remedial Right Only Theories neglect the importance of\nnationalism only if the account of the right to secede they advance is\nproperly situated in a plausible, more comprehensive theory of\nself-determination. \nThe appeal of Plebiscitary Theories is that they appear to make the\ndetermination of boundaries a matter of choice or, more accurately, of\nmajority rule. To that extent they seek to bask in the popularity of\ndemocracy (Philpott 1995). Plebiscitary Theories typically add another\nnecessary condition, beyond majority preference (in the region in\nquestion) for secession: Both the seceding unit and the remainder\nstate must be able adequately to perform the basic functions that\njustify or legitimize states in the first place. Call this the State\nViability Requirement. \nThe appeal of Plebiscitary Theories is two-fold. First, they avoid a\nproblem that afflicts the other main type of Primary Right Theory,\nAscriptivist Theories, because they do not require either an account\nof what constitutes a nation or an explanation of why nations have a\nright to their own state. Second, they are less conservative than\nRemedial Right Only Theories, allowing a democratic path to the\nredrawing of state boundaries, and this may be appealing, given the\nfact, as noted earlier, that existing boundaries may reflect national\nsecurity needs and the need for large internal\nmarkets—considerations that are no longer as important in an era\nin which interstate wars are quite rare and markets extend across\nstate borders. \nHowever, given what is at stake in secession, it is far from clear\nthat the mere fact that a majority of persons residing in a portion of\na state desire independence should be a sufficient reason to give them\na unilateral right to secede, in the absence of any grievances. Why\nshould one assume that the mere fact of residence in an area\nauthorizes persons to decide by majority vote not only to change their\nown citizenship but also to deprive others (the nonsecessionists) of\ntheir citizenship and to remove a part of the territory of the state\nwithout the consent of the citizens who happen to live outside the\narea in question?  \nIn short, a serious weakness of existing Plebiscitary Theories, as\nBrilmayer (1991) emphasizes, is that they provide no account of the\nnormative implications of occupancy of territory. The most developed\nversions of Plebiscitary Theories ground the right to secede in a\nright of political association, but the right of political association\nconsidered in itself tells us nothing about the right to territory.\nWhat is needed is an account of why the fact that a group that happens\nto find itself in a particular region of the state has the right to\ntransform their political association in that particular piece of\nterritory into sovereign jurisdiction over it.  \nTo put the point bluntly, the Plebiscitary Theory seems to fly in the\nface of the doctrine of popular sovereignty. According to that\ndoctrine, which lies at the core of the liberal-democratic conception\nof the state, the state’s territory is properly conceived of as the\nterritory of the people as a whole, not just those who at a particular\ntime happen to reside in a portion of it. But if this is so, it is\nhard to understand how the mere fact that a majority of citizens in a\ncertain portion of the peoples’ territory desire to have that\nterritory become an independent state could confer on them the right\nunilaterally to appropriate it. \nAbsent an account of the normative significance of the fact of\noccupancy, Plebiscitary Theories do not make a convincing case that\nmajority preference plus satisfaction of the State Viability Proviso\nimply the right to independent statehood. Notice that it will not due\nfor the Plebiscitary Theorist to add the premise that a group that is\nentitled (by the right to political association) to have its own\nterritory. That would not explain why they have a right to the\nparticular territory they happen to occupy. \nIn addition, critics of the Plebiscitary view have pointed out that\nthe justifications for democratic governance within given political\nboundaries do not support the thesis that boundaries may be redrawn\nsimply by majority rule (Buchanan 1998a). There are two chief\njustifications for democratic governance. The first is that democracy\nis intrinsically valuable from the standpoint of a very basic\nprinciple of morality, namely, that all persons are entitled to equal\nconsideration. The core idea is that the basic moral equality of\npersons requires that they have an equal say in the decisions that\ndetermine the basic character of their polity. But it appears that\nthis justification for democracy does not imply that the decision\nwhether to secede should be determined unilaterally by a majority in\nfavor of secession in a portion of the territory of an existing state\nas opposed to being determined by a majority of all the citizens. \nThe first justification for democracy tells us that all who are\nmembers of a particular polity—all who must live under one\nsystem of rules that determine the fundamental character of social\nlife—should have an equal say or should participate as equals in\ndeciding what those rules are to be. But the principle of democratic\nrule cannot tell us what the boundaries of the polity should be,\nbecause in order to implement the democratic rule we must already have\nfixed the boundaries of the polity. The right to democratic governance\nis a principle that specifies a relation of equality among members of\nthe same polity, not a right to determine the membership of polities\nor their territorial boundaries. \nThe second chief justification for democracy is instrumental: It holds\nthat democratic governance tends to promote important goods, including\npeace, freedom, and other dimensions of well-being. Once again, the\nforce of the justification depends upon the assumption that what is\nbeing justified is a process of decision making for a polity. The\nclaim is that the well-being of all the citizens will be best served\nif all the citizens are allowed to express their preferences through\nvoting, at least on fundamental matters that affect all. Plainly, this\nargument cannot support the assertion that only some citizens (those\nin a particular portion of the polity) ought to be able unilaterally\nto decide a matter that will affect all citizens of the polity. Hence\nit cannot support the Plebiscitary Right view of the unilateral right\nto secede. Because neither of the justifications for democracy\nsupports the Plebiscitary view, the latter is not entailed by the\ncommitment to democracy. \nThere is one more problem that proponents of the Plebiscitary approach\nhave not addressed, at least not explicitly. A successful secession\ncan create security risks for the remainder state, and it is not clear\nthat this eventually is adequately taken into account in the\nPlebiscitary Theory’s State Viability Proviso. The issue is clearest\nin the case of irredentist secession. Suppose that a portion of the\nterritory of a state, S, whose inhabitants are predominantly members\nof minority ethnic group E1, secede in order to merge that territory\nwith the territory of a neighboring state S1, in which the E1 ethnic\ngroup is the majority. Depending on the relationship between S1 and\nS2—perhaps there is a history of conflicts as is the case with\nIndia and Pakistan—the result of the secession may be an\nintolerable threat to S1’s security. (Perhaps the seceding territory\ncontains natural barriers to invasion from S2 and expensive\nfortifications). It is at least worth asking whether the interest that\nthe secessionist group have in linking up with their ethnic comrades\nin S2 is morally weightier than the interest of the majority of the\ncitizens of S1 in national security. (Remember that by hypothesis, the\nsecessionist group has not suffered injustices at the hands of S1).\nEven if S2 does not invade S1, the new security situation created by\nthe change of borders (and the augmentation of S2s population) may\nmake S1 subject to domination by S2. It is not clear that the\nPlebiscitary Theory’s state viability criterion provides adequate\nresources for addressing this problem. It is not that S1 lacks the\ncapacity to perform the legitimizing functions of a state; rather, the\nproblem is that it has become vulnerable as a result of the\nsecession. \nReflections on the security problem lead to a methodological point.\nThe contours of a moral right to secede may depend on what\ninstitutional resources exist outside the state for protecting the\ninterests of the secessionists and/or of the people of the remainder\nstate. If international or regional organizations can provide\neffective guarantees to S1 that if part of its territory secedes and\nbecomes part of a neighboring state it will not face a security risk,\nthen it will be harder for S1 to justify forcibly resisting the\nsession. In contrast, if international security arrangements are weak,\nthen in cases where there is a serious security risk for the state if\nirredentist secession occurs, the irredentist group’s right to secede\nlooks more doubtful. Similarly, if regional or international\norganizations can be counted on to provide support for intrastate\nautonomy arrangements short of full independence, then it may be\nreasonable to conclude that a group that can significantly benefit\nfrom such arrangements does not have the right to secede. In contrast,\nif a dissatisfied minority group cannot rely on such external\nresources to protect its interests by securing some meaningful form of\nself-determination within the state, then it may have a stronger case\nfor seceding. In\n Section 4\n we develop this line of thought further, introducing a distinction\nbetween theories of secession that assume that only features of the\nstate and the new state that would be formed from it by secession are\nrelevant to determining the contours of the moral right to secede and\ntheories that recognize that facts about regional and international\ninstitutions can be relevant. \nThis approach to unilateral secession has a long pedigree, reaching\nback at least to Nineteenth Century nationalists such as Mazzini, who\nproclaimed that every nation should have its own state. Critics of the\nAscriptivist variant of Primary Right Theory (Buchanan 1991, Gellner 2008) argue that it would\nlegitimize virtually unlimited unilateral, forcible border changes\nbecause it confers an entitlement to its own state on every nation (or\n“people” or distinct society). For reasons noted above\nthis appears to be not only unfeasible, but a recipe for increasing\nethno-national conflict. \nHowever, those who advocate the Ascriptivist Theory reply that it does\nnot require every nation (or distinct people) to exercise its\nunilateral right to secede and have conjectured that were their theory\ngenerally accepted not every group upon which it confers this\nentitlement would choose to secede. Nevertheless, given the historical\nrecord of ethno-nationalist conflict, the worry remains that\ninstitutionalizing the principle that every nation is entitled to its\nown state would exacerbate ethno-national violence, along with the\nhuman rights violations it inevitably entails. Thus the moral costs of\nincorporating the Ascriptivist version of Primary Right Theory into\ninternational law may appear prohibitive—especially if there are\nless risky ways to accommodate the legitimate interests of nations,\nsuch as better compliance with human rights norms and recourse to\nintrastate autonomy arrangements. \nThere are variants of Ascriptivist theory that go some distance toward\nallaying the worry that acceptance of the theory would add fuel to the\nfires of ethno-national conflict by qualifying the unilateral right of\nsecession for nations (or distinct peoples) in various ways. For\nexample, the Ascriptivist may hold that there is a presumption in\nfavor of each nation or distinct people having a right to its own\nstate if it so desires, or a prima facie unilateral right to secede\nfor all such groups, but the international legal system is justified\nin requiring some groups to settle for autonomy arrangements short of\nfull independence to avoid dangerous instability or to accommodate\nsimilar claims by other groups to the same territory. This way of\nresponding to the worry about adding fuel to ethno-national conflicts\ncomes at a price: What was originally billed as a unilateral right of\nevery nation as such to its own state now looks more like a highly\ndefeasible presumption in favor of independence for nations. And\nunless a fairly concrete account of the conditions under which the\npresumption is not defeated is provided, it is hard to know what the\npractical implications of this qualified Ascriptivist view are. What\nis needed is an account of how the putative presumption in favor of\nstatehood for nations is to be weighed against competing claims and\nvalues. So far, proponents of Ascriptivist Theories have not provided\nthis. \nEarlier, we observed that critics of the Ascriptivist version of\nPrimary Right Theory tend to focus on the potential costs in terms of\nexacerbated ethno-national conflict of incorporating the view into\ninternational law. However, it is not enough to note the potential\ncosts of acceptance of the Ascriptivist Theory and its incorporation\ninto international law. It is also necessary to understand the\nputative benefits of having a system in which the rights of nations to\ntheir own states is acknowledged. Accordingly, David Miller has\nusefully distinguished two ways in which Ascriptivist theories can be\nsupported: by arguments to show that nations need states or by\narguments to show that states need to be mono-national (Miller\n1995). \nThe first type of argument has two variants: One can argue that\nnations need to have their own states, either (1) in order to be able\nto protect themselves from destruction or from forces that threaten\ntheir distinctive character, or (2) in order for co-nationals to have\nthe institutional resources to be able to fulfill the special\nobligations they owe one another as members of an “ethical\ncommunity”, in Miller’s phrase. Both of these considerations\ncan, under certain circumstances, weigh in favor of some form of\npolitical self-determination for nations, but it is not clear that\neither is sufficient to ground a general right of all nations to full\nindependence and hence a unilateral right to secede. Indeed Miller\nmarshals them in support of a weaker conclusion: that nations have a\n“strong claim” to self-determination, but does not specify\nwhen the claim constitutes a full-fledged right. \nThe second type of justification for the view that nations are\nentitled to their own states also has two variants: The first, which\ndates back at least to John Stuart Mill’s Considerations On\nRepresentative Government (Mill [1861] 1991), asserts that\ndemocracy can only flourish in mono-national states, because states in\nwhich there is more than one nation will be lacking in the solidarity,\ntrust, or shared sentiments and values that democracy requires. The\nsecond, advanced by David Miller, asserts that states need to be\nmononational in order to achieve distributive justice, because\ndistributive justice requires significant redistribution of wealth\namong citizens and the better off will only be willing share their\nwealth with their less fortunate fellow citizens if they see them as\nco-nationals (Miller 1995). Both forms of the “states need to be\nmononational”argument raise very interesting questions about the\nmotivational conditions necessary if crucial state functions are to be\nsuccessfully performed. \nMill apparently based his judgment that multination states are\nincompatible with democracy on historical experience. However, some\nwould argue that there are cases of multinational democratic states:\nCanada, Belgium, and perhaps Switzerland (depending upon whether one\nregards the last as multinational or merely multi-ethnic). One might\nalso add the United States, since most Indian tribes have a legal\nstatus that approaches sovereignty. \nOf course modern proponents of Mill’s argument would be quick to point\nout that the continued existence of Belgium and Canada are in doubt\ndue to nationalist secession movements. (However, at present the\nsecession of Quebec seems very unlikely.) On the other hand, it could\nbe argued that Mill’s generalization is prematurely pessimistic:\ngenuine democracies are a very recent phenomenon and until even more\nrecently there have been almost no serious attempts, even on the part\nof democratic states, to recognize the claims of nations within\nstates, through various forms of autonomy\n arrangements.[8]\n So as a justification for acknowledging a right to independent\nstatehood for all nations, with the risk of instability and violence\nthis might entail, Mill’s pessimism about multinational democracies\nmay seem to some to be premature. The most reasonable strategy would\nseem to be to do more to ensure that states respect the human rights\nof their minorities and to encourage intrastate autonomy agreements\nrather than giving up on the idea of multinational states. \nThe second version of the “states need to be\nmono-national” argument also faces serious objections. First,\nwhether or not nationalism will facilitate or instead block\nlarge-scale redistribution of wealth will depend upon the character of\nthe nationalism in question. Nationalist solidarity may not extend to\nwillingness to redistribute wealth. As socialists from Marx onward\nhave observed, the privileged minority has often been quite adept at\nappealing to nationalism to counteract the redistributive impulse.\nSecond, even in cases where nationalist sentiment facilitates\nredistribution, one must ask: what else does it facilitate? Miller\nappears to argue from the fact that a morally pristine, highly\nidealized nationalism would facilitate distributive justice (or\ndemocracy) to the conclusion that nations as such are entitled to\ntheir own states or at least to a presumption thereof. But there are\nmany historical instances in which the national unity that Miller\nassumes will be harnessed for the pursuit of distributive justice has\nbeen ferociously directed toward conquest and against non-nationals\nand dissenting members of the nation itself. \nThe foregoing comparative evaluation of the main types of theories of\nthe unilateral (claim-)right to secede suggests that the Remedial\nRight Only approach is superior. However, at present it is fair to say\nthat none of the rival types of theories is sufficiently worked out\nfor a definitive comparative evaluation to be possible. For each type\nof theory there are unanswered questions and potential objections. For\nexample, Remedial Right Only Theories that include unjust annexations\nof territory among the injustices that ground a unilateral\n(claim-)right to secede must provide a satisfactory solution to what\nhas elsewhere been called the moral statute of limitations problem\n(Buchanan 1991: 88): how durable are claims to independence based on\npast unjust takings—how far back in history may a group go in\nmaking the case that they are entitled to their own state because they\npreviously had one? \nMore importantly, a Remedial Right Only Theory of the unilateral right\nto secede will only be defensible in the end if it rests upon a\nplausible account of what entitles a state to control over a territory\nin the first place. Without such an account the Remedial Right Only\nview appears arbitrarily to privilege the status quo by requiring\nsecessionists to bear the burden of showing that they have suffered\nserious and persistent injustices in order to establish their claim to\nterritory. To answer this objection, the Remedial Right Only theorist\nwould have to provide a justice-based theory of legitimacy, arguing\nthat what grounds the state’s claim to territory is its provision of\njustice, and that it is for this reason that only serious injustices\ncan void that claim (such an account of legitimacy is in Buchanan\n2013).  \nAll three types of theories must address satisfactorily what may be\ncalled the problem of authentic voice. For Ascriptivist and Remedial\nRight Only Theories this means providing a reasoned answer to the\nquestion “what counts as an authentic decision to attempt to\nsecede?” (Is there some nonarbitrary way of specifying what sort\nof majority is required in favor of secession before it can be said\nthat the group in question has chosen to exercise its right to\nsecede?). Similarly, Plebiscitary Right theorists must provide a\nprincipled account of how large a majority in favor of secession must\nexist, before it can be said that the right to secede exists. \nIn addition, all three types of theories must articulate a plausible\naccount of the rights of those within the seceding territory who\noppose secession. For example, are there circumstances in which the\nanti-secessionists should be granted dual citizenship, so that they\ncan preserve their citizenship in the state from which the secession\nis occurring? Are there circumstances in which they deserve\ncompensation for losses they incur when a new state, perhaps with\ndifferent property laws, is created? \nFinally, as suggested earlier, the implications of each type of theory\nfor international law regarding secession should be explained. In the\nnext section, we explore briefly the relationship between views about\nthe moral (claim-)right to unilateral secession and the question of\nwhat position international law should take on unilateral\nsecession. \nThe discussion thus far indicates that all three types of theories\nsuffer a serious incompleteness: They do not situate their position on\nsecession within the context of a comprehensive theory of territorial\njustice. A theory of territorial justice would provide a coherent\naccount of valid moral claims to territory of various types, from\nclaims to full sovereign jurisdiction, to claims to the more limited\njurisdictional control needed for various forms of intrastate autonomy\n(modes of self-determination short of full independence), to claims to\nparticipation in various forms of joint jurisdiction, to claims to\npermanent occupancy. Ascriptivist theories need such a theory in order\nto explain why nations (as opposed to other types of groups) have the\nmost robust claim to territory, the jurisdiction over territory that\nconstitutes sovereignty. Plebiscitary Theories, as we have already\nseen, need such a theory to explain why the fact that a group is a\nmajority in a particular territory gives it a claim to sovereignty\nover that territory—and why the fact that those residing in the\nsame territory who do not support secession have no special claim to\nthat territory, not even one that falls short of the claim the\nmajority has. Remedial Right Only Theories need an account of what\nforms of control over territory, short of full sovereignty, are\nappropriate for which groups, given the nature of the injustices they\nhave suffered at the hands of the state. All existing theories of\nsecession include accounts of what gives a group a claim to\nsovereignty over territory, but to make these accounts fully\nplausible, they also need to explain what grounds less robust claims\nto territory, and that requires integrating a theory of secession into\na comprehensive theory of territorial justice. The first efforts at\ndeveloping systematic views on territorial justice have appeared only\nrecently, and their significance for philosophical controversies about\nthe right to secede is not yet clear (Kolers 2009; Meisels 2009; Nine\n2012). \nThere is another way of sorting theories of secession that is also\nilluminating. As noted in\n subsection 2.3,\n some theories assume that only facts about the institutional\nresources of the remainder state and the new state created by\nsecession are relevant to determining the contours of the moral right\nto secede and others recognize that facts about other institutions,\nwhether regional or international can be relevant. The Plebiscitary\nTheory developed by Altman and Wellman (2009), is an instance of the\nformer type of theory; Buchanan’s Remedial Right Only theory is an\ninstance of the latter.  \nAccording to Altman and Wellman, whether a group has the right to\nsecede depends only on its preference for independent statehood and on\nwhether the new state it creates and the remainder state will be able\nadequately to perform the basic functions of government. On this view,\nthe effects this group seceding or of other parties agreeing that it\nhas the right to secede on future secessionist attempts or on the\nwell-functioning of the international order are completely irrelevant\nto determining whether this group has the right to secede. In effect,\nthis theory treats secession as strictly a two-party affair, so far as\nthe interest relevant to determining whether a group has the right to\nsecede is concerned. Buchanan’s theory, in contrast, recognizes that\nother parties can have legitimate interests that are relevant to\ndetermining what the rights of the primary parties are.  \nAltman and Wellman might reply that their State Viability Proviso does\ntake the interests of third parties into account. More specifically,\nthe fulfillment of the Proviso serves the interests of third parties\nin having viable states and in the provision of justice that comes\nwith the discharging of basic state functions. \nThe problem with this reply is that, while acknowledging that\nthird-party interests can be relevant to determining whether a group\nhas the right to secede, it offers no reason as to why legitimate\nthird-party interests should be thus restricted. Why are not the\ninterests that other states and their populations have in a stable\norder of states and in avoiding security crises of the sort that\nirredentist secessions can create (as sketched above) also relevant to\ndetermining the contours of the right to secede? After all, whether a\ngroup has the (claim-)right to secede depends on whether other parties\nhave sufficient reason to refraining from trying to prevent the\nsecession and that in turn can depend on whether the secession is\nlikely to have a negative impact on various legitimate interests,\nincluding, but not limited to the interest in the remainder state and\nthe new state being viable. \nSuppose that a group within a legitimate, reasonably just state, is a\nmajority in a portion of the state’s territory and prefers to have its\nown state. Whether they have the right to secede depends on whether\nthere are sufficient reasons for other states to refrain from\ninterfering with their attempt at secession (because the right in\nquestion is a claim-right). But whether other states ought to refrain\nfrom interfering with a secession or not interfere with the state’s\nattempt to prevent a secession can depend on whether behaving in this\nway is likely to help establish a new norm of customary international\nlaw that permits territorially-concentrated majorities unilaterally to\nform their own states without interference. In the absence of\nimpartial institutions to determine when the conditions for justified\nsecession according to the Plebiscitary Theory are met, such a new,\nmuch more permissive norm of customary international law would be\ndangerous—it would encourage secessions that do not meet the\nPlebiscitary Theories own criteria. So, as in the case of irredentist\nsecessions noted above, it appears that in these circumstances as\nwell, whether other states ought to interfere with an attempted\nsecession, and hence whether a group has the right to secede, can\ndepend on factors other than those the Plebiscitary Theory allows to\ncount. \nIf, as we have suggested, a range of legitimate interests is relevant\nto determining the nature of the moral right to secede and if the\nextent that these interests are impacted by secession depends on the\nexisting institutional resources, including not just those of the\nremainder state and the new state, but also those of regional and\ninternational organizations, then it follows that a theory of the\nmoral right to secede must take into account existing institutional\nrealities at all levels. And if that is so, then contrary to what\ntheorists like Altman and Wellman assume, probing our moral intuitions\nabout quite different phenomena in which the institutional context is\nquite different will not be a reliable guide to understanding the\nnature of the moral right to secede. For example, analogizing the\ndecision of a minority group to break away and form their own state to\nthe decision of two individuals to marry will not be very\nilluminating, because the supposed analogy omits any reference to the\nrelevant institutional facts. \nA more serious lacuna in the philosophical literature on secession\nthan the failure to integrate it into a comprehensive theory of\nterritorial justice is the absence of a connection with just war\ntheory. In real-world conflicts in which a group asserts the right to\nsecede and the state denies the validity of the claim, either one or\nboth of the parties often resorts to force. But merely establishing\nthat a group has the right to secede does not settle whether it is\njustified in using force to achieve its goal of independent statehood.\n(In general, merely having a right to X does not entail being\njustified in using force to secure X). Similarly, if the group\ndoes not have the right to secede, it may still not be justifiable for\nthe state to use force to prevent it from seceding. Remarkably,\nphilosophical theories of secession have not distinguished between\nhaving the right to secede and being justified in using force to\nexercise the right. Nor have they discussed the conditions under which\nstates have the right to use force to resist secessions when the\nsecessionists have no moral right to secede. This is especially\nsurprising, given the resurgence of philosophical theorizing about\njust war.  \nThe key point here is that mainstream just war theory does not endorse\nthe assertion that the violation of any right can justify force nor\nthe assertion that force is justified if it is required for the\nsuccessful exercise of any right. Instead, the dominant view is that\nthe list of just causes (legitimate ends to be served by going to war)\nis more constrained than that and should reflect the conviction that\nthe use of force is only justified if it is required to remedy very\nserious injustices or for the exercise of very important rights.  \nIt is far from obvious how just war theory and the theory of secession\nshould be connected. It appears, however, the use of force by\nsecessionists would be more problematic on some theories of secession\nthan on others. Suppose, for example, that a majority of the people in\na portion of a legitimate state’s territory decide that they want\ntheir own state there, in spite of the fact that they are not victims\nof any injustices at the hands of the state. On the Plebiscitary\nTheory, they have the right to secede (so long as the new unit and the\nremainder state will be able adequately to perform the basic functions\nof government). If the state refuses to vacate its facilities in that\nregion, turn over control over that portion of the border to the\nsecessionists, etc., is it justifiable for the secessionists to use\nforce against the agents of the state? Does the mere preference for\ntheir own state justify engaging in a course of action that is likely\nto result in large-scale violence? The problem here is that the\npurpose the secessionists can invoke to justify a course of action\nseems not to fit well with the usual understandings of just cause. In\ncontrast, remedial Right Only Theories would seem to be consistent, at\nleast in principle, with mainstream just war theory, because the\nlatter recognizes redress of serious injustices (and not the mere\ndesire to have one’s own political unit) as a just cause. Nonetheless,\na fully-developed Remedial Right Only Theory would have to provide an\naccount of when injustices are sufficiently serious to warrant\nsecession under conditions in which there is a significant risk of\nlarge-scale violence. Regardless of which type of theory one embraces,\none would also need an account of the conditions under which the state\nwould be justified in using force to block secession. For as we have\nalready noted, the mere fact that the group attempting to secede does\nnot have a right to secede does not imply that it is justifiable for\nthe state to use force to prevent them from seceding. A moral theory\nof secession should not be limited, then, to articulating and\ndefending characterization of the moral right to secede. It should\nalso provide an account of the morality of using force in conflicts\nover secession and one that is consistent with its view of the right\nto secede. \nThere is yet another desideratum for a theory of secession: As\nsuggested earlier, the implications of each type of theory for\ninternational law regarding secession should be explained. In the next\nsection, we explore briefly the relationship between views about the\nmoral (claim-)right to unilateral secession and the question of what\nposition international law should take on unilateral secession. \nThe deficiencies of existing international law regarding secession\nmotivate the project of developing principled proposals for reform. At\npresent international law recognizes only a very narrow set of\ncircumstances under which the unilateral right to secede exists as an\ninternational legal right, namely, when a group is subject to colonial\ndomination. The difficulty with this conception of the international\nlegal right to unilateral secession is that, while clearly embodying\nthe idea that serious and persistent injustices can generate a right\nto unilateral secession, it arbitrarily restricts the injustices that\ngenerate the right to the special case of classical colonialism, where\na metropolitan power dominates a racially and/or ethnically distinct\ngroup in an overseas colony. Another difficulty is that while\ninternational legal practice has confined the unilateral right to\nsecede to the so-called “saltwater decolonization” case,\nseveral important international legal documents include reference to\nan apparently much broader “right of self-determination of all\npeoples” which is said to include the right to choose full\nindependence, and hence the right to\n secede.[9]\n One way to conceive of the chief task for a moral theory of\ninternational law regarding secession is that it must provide a\nreasoned basis for removing the arbitrary restriction from which the\ncurrent law suffers, while avoiding the dangerously expansive notion\nthat all “peoples” are entitled to their own states, in a\nworld in which virtually every existing state includes more than one\n“people”, in which several “peoples” claim the\nsame territory, and in which there are no international institutional\nprinciples or mechanisms for sorting out these conflicting claims. \nAn important choice for the moral theorist of international law\nregarding secession regards the scope of the right itself. On one\nview, international law should simply acknowledge, under certain\nconditions to be specified by the theory, a group’s right to its own\nstate; on the other view, international law should distinguish between\n(a) the conditions under which a group should be accorded the right to\nrepudiate the jurisdiction of the state over a portion of the state’s\nterritory and to attempt to establish its own control there and (b)\nthe conditions under which international law should recognize the\nsecessionist entity as a legitimate state, with all the rights,\nimmunities, privileges, and obligations this entails. \nThe difference between these two options can be appreciated if we take\nthe example of a Remedial Right Only approach to proposals for\nreforming international law regarding secession. For simplicity,\nsuppose that the Remedial Right Only theory under consideration\nrecognizes only large-scale and persistent violations of basic human\nrights as grounding the unilateral right to secede, and suppose that\ngroup G has suffered such violations. On the first view, the\nproposal is that international law should simply acknowledge that\nG has the right to its own legitimate state if forming a new\nstate is the remedy of last resort for large-scale, persistent\nviolations of the basic human rights of members of G, where\nthis means that other states should recognize the new entity as having\nall the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, and obligations this\nstatus entails. On the second view, there are two distinct questions\nthe international law of secession should address: First, has G\nsuffered large-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights\nand second, does G satisfy the conditions for recognitional\nlegitimacy, for being recognized as a legitimate state? The second\nview would maintain that although the group’s having suffered\nlarge-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights is\nsufficient for acknowledging its right to repudiate the state’s\njurisdiction and attempt to set up its own state, something more is\nrequired before international law should recognize the new entity as a\nlegitimate state; in particular, the new state should provide credible\nassurances that it will respect the rights of minorities within its\nterritory. \nMaking recognition of legitimate statehood dependent in this way upon\nsatisfying basic requirements of justice obviously coheres with the\nRemedial Right Only theory’s approach to secession, which involves\nrewarding states that respect rights. But there is much to be said for\ndistinguishing, regardless of which theory of the right to secede is\nadopted, between the right to secede (understood as the right to\nrepudiate the state’s authority over a portion of its territory and to\nattempt to set up a new state there) and the right to recognition as a\nlegitimate state. New entities created through secession typically are\nkeen to receive recognition of their legitimacy because of the\nbenefits this confers, including access to favorable trade regimes,\nloans and credits from international agencies such as the World Bank\nand International Monetary Fund, and the ability to participate as an\nequal with other states in the making of international law.\nDistinguishing between whether a group has the right to secede (to\nrepudiate the state’s jurisdiction and attempt to establish its own\nstate) and whether it has the right to recognition as a legitimate\nstate enables the international legal system to impose normative\nconditions on recognition in circumstances in which new states have\nstrong incentives to satisfy them. \nA fully-developed philosophical theory of what the international law\nof secession ought to be would be quite ambitious and complex. It\nwould have to include not only an account of the connection between\nthe right to secede and the right to recognition, but also a theory of\njustified intervention in support of or against secession that would\ncohere with a more general position on the legitimate use of force\nacross borders. \nPhilosophical work on secession falls into three main categories: (1)\nattempts to develop an account of the moral right to secede\n(understood either as a claim-right or as a mere liberty), (2)\ninvestigations of the compatibility or incompatibility of secession\nwith constitutionalism, and (3) attempts to determine what posture\ninternational law should adopt concerning secession. In each of these\nareas of inquiry, as well as in the connections among them,\nexploration of the moral issues of secession provides a powerful lens\nthrough which to examine some of the most important issues of\nmoral-political theory, including perhaps the most fundamental issue\nof all: what gives a state a valid claim to its territory?","contact.mail":"allen.buchanan@duke.edu","contact.domain":"duke.edu"}]
