In a broad sense, it is more or less identical\nwith Spanish Scholasticism, which also includes authors from the\nSpanish Netherlands. In a narrower sense, the School of Salamanca\nrefers to two or three generations of pupils of Francisco de Vitoria,\nwho was, in effect, the founding father of the school in both the\nbroad and narrow sense. On the whole, it is more useful to choose the\nbroader understanding of the term, even though it means considering\nsome figures who were never at Salamanca; and this approach has been\nadopted here. Regarded as forefathers of the law of nations (ius\ngentium), they also were theoreticians willing to depart from the\nteachings of Aristotle, and some of them were early theorists of\nmonetarist economics. They based themselves on the works of Thomas\nAquinas but felt free to depart from them, especially in dealing with\ncontemporary issues like Spanish expansion in the Indies and the\nchallenge of Protestantism to Catholic Christianity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the theoretical aspects of the School of\nSalamanca, it is necessary to give a short introduction to the history\nof the University of Salamanca. The focus will then turn to two\nDominicans, Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto, and two Jesuits,\nLuis de Molina and Francisco Suárez, though there were, of\ncourse, many other extremely important participants in the various\nfields of discourse in which the School engaged. \nThe University of Salamanca is the oldest institution of higher\neducation on the Iberian Peninsula. A cathedral school, located in\nSalamanca by 1130, received a charter from King Alfonso IX of\nLeón in 1218 as a “general school” for his realm.\nThe regulations for this school were promulgated by King Alfonso X\n“el Sabio” in 1254. Pope Alexander IV, in 1255, confirmed\nthe foundation of the studium generale and conferred on it\nthe licentia ubique docendi, a universally valid license to\nteach. Thereafter, Salamanca was recognized as a university. Courses\nin theology and law were offered, with many graduates receiving\nemployment by the crown of Spain. Lectures on authoritative texts were\nthe most common means of teaching. Starting in the fifteenth century,\nprofessors also offered relectiones, treating in greater\ndepth a particular topic previously covered during lectures.\nDisputations were also held. Christopher Columbus made his case for a\nsea route to Asia to the university before his voyage in 1492. \nTwo notable learned men, Juan de Segovia and Alfonso Tostado de\nMadrigal, were affiliated with the University of Salamanca in the\nfifteenth century. A short account of their careers will highlight the\nrange of views that characterized Spanish theology at the university\nin those years. Juan, a professor of theology (1422–1435),\nparticipated in the Council of Basel (1431–1449), beginning in\n1432. He defended conciliar supremacy and supported the doctrine of\nMary’s immaculate conception. His writings include polemics on\nbehalf of the council against Pope Eugenius IV (1431–1447) and a\nHistory of the General Council of Basel. Juan was made a\ncardinal by the antipope Felix V (1439–1449); but he retired\nafter Felix yielded to Eugenius’ successor, Nicholas V\n(1447–1455). In retirement, Juan wrote on the need for dialogue\nwith Islam. Aware of his impending death (c. 1458), Juan bequeathed\nhis library to the university. \nAlfonso Fernández de Madrigal, “el Tostado”, taught\ntheology before becoming a bishop in 1454. He, too, supported the\nCouncil of Basel, and he displayed his knowledge in extensive writings\non Scripture and ecclesiastical history. His tract on the polity\ndefended popular regimes in a realm whose intellectuals usually\nembraced monarchy. Alfonso also wrote against clerical concubinage.\nCertain controversial opinions of his were denounced to both pope and\ncouncil. The Castilian Dominican Juan de Torquemada wrote, on behalf\nof the Council of Basel, a critique of Alfonso’s views, to which\nhe replied. Alfonso later defended his teachings in Rome before Pope\nEugenius. “El Tostado”, on his death, left behind a\nreputation for great learning. \nThe Dominican order had established itself in Salamanca by 1244, when\na provincial chapter was held in that city. The convent of San\nEsteban, chosen as the site of a studium generale of the\norder in 1299, offered courses in grammar, logic, and theology. During\nthe fourteenth century, the Dominican convent gained control of two of\nthe university’s four chairs of theology. In 1489,\nSalamanca’s Dominican studium received from the papacy\nthe right to award academic degrees. The building now associated with\nVitoria and his school was begun in 1524 but not finished until 1610,\nwhen the university was falling into decline. By that date, other\nIberian universities, especially Alcalá and Coimbra, had become\ncompetitors of Salamanca for intellectual leadership. In addition, the\nJesuits had become competitors of the Dominicans as leading\nphilosophers and theologians. In Vitoria’s century,\ndistinguished scholars at Salamanca included the jurist Martín\nde Azpilcueta, who is known for developing a monetarist theory, and\nthe Scripture professor Gregorio Gallo, who considered the possibility\nthat the Apostle Thomas had preached in the New World. \nFrancisco de Vitoria (1486–1546) is usually regard as a late\nScholastic, who employed Aristotelian thought in his philosophy and\ntheology. Although Spanish Scholastics like Vitoria were primarily\ntheologians, the topics they discussed went far beyond the limits of\ntheology and even of the traditional philosophical companions of\ntheology, such as metaphysics and logic. This is partly because\nDominican theologians had to comment on the Summa theologiae\nof Thomas Aquinas (Sancti Thomae Aquinatis Doctoris Angelici Opera\nOmnia, volumes 4-12), with all the different topics it\ncovered. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw a revival of\nThomism in Paris, Rome, and Salamanca. In Rome, Thomas de Vio\n(Cajetan) wrote the most influential commentary on the Summa\ntheologiae. In Paris, Peter Crockaert, a pupil of John Mair,\njoined the Dominican order and became a zealous Thomist. Francisco de\nVitoria, who studied in Paris, embraced this Thomist revival. When he\nbegan teaching in Salamanca in 1524, he supplemented Peter\nLombard’s Sentences with the Summa theologiae\nas the textbook for the study of theology. Although the University of\nSalamanca was not a new foundation, Vitoria and his disciples,\nespecially Domingo de Soto (1494–1560) and Melchior Cano\n(1509–1560), transformed it into a center for a revived\nScholasticism, applying Thomism to such practical problems as the\nevangelization of the indigenous populations of the New World and the\nlegality of slavery. In addition, the Dominicans of Castile influenced\nthe intellectual development of the fledgling Jesuit order, which\nproduced such luminaries as Luis de Molina (1535–1600) and\nFrancisco Suárez (1548–1617). \nSome works of these theologians can be seen as vast, overflowing\ncommentaries on a number of questions from the Summa\ntheologiae, especially on topics such as law and justice. Since\nthey were confronted by a rapidly changing universe—the New\nWorld, populated by inhabitants who belonged to none of the\ntraditionally known religions, and a globalizing economy (including\nthe slave trade)—they had to deal with new opportunities and new\nproblems, while still considering long-standing questions such as the\nlegitimacy of charging interest. Because they were understood, or\nunderstood themselves, as confessors or as advisors of\nconfessors—Domingo de Soto was Emperor Charles V’s\nconfessor, Luis de Molina declared that he wrote for the confessors of\nthose who hold power—they had to cope with political, economic,\nand legal reality, often in a quite detailed manner. \nThe authors of the School of Salamanca used traditional tools to deal\nwith the new situations they faced. Besides the overarching influence\nof Thomas Aquinas—who became a Doctor of the Church in 1567 and\nwhose works Ignatius of Loyola had obliged the members of his newly\nfounded Jesuit order to study diligently—they engaged with other\nmedieval traditions, including the glosses to the Decretum\nGratiani, Franciscan authors (especially John Duns Scotus and\nWilliam Ockham), Jean Gerson and even Marsilius of Padua, a banned\nauthor who was not even allowed to be cited, but nevertheless had a\nconsiderable impact on the conciliarist debate. Scholastic authors\nmade a creative, instead of philologically correct, use of their\nauthorities, interpreting and explaining them in their own sense.\nMolina and Suárez even overtly criticized Thomas Aquinas and\nhis understanding of law. \nVitoria’s thought inevitably depended—but not\nslavishly—on Thomas Aquinas, not only in his commentary on the\nSumma theologiae, but also in his relectiones and\nother writings on law and society. His admiration for “Divus\nThomas” had already begun when he studied and later taught\ntheology at Paris and Valladolid. At Paris, he had assisted in the\npreparation of Crockaert’s edition of the Summa\ntheologiae, published in 1515. His lectures commenting on the\nPrima and the Prima secundae of the Summa\nare lost, but must have been quite successful. His most famous works\nwere published after he was elected to the first chair of theology at\nthe University of Salamanca in 1526, the most important professorship\nin the Spanish kingdom; and, contrary to the statutes of the\nuniversity, he took the Summa theologiae as the basis for his\nteachings (Vitoria, Vorlesungen 1995: 36). His reflections on\npolitical topics, such as the political status of the Church and the\nConquista in Mexico and South America, were followed\nattentively in the highest circles, even if not always approved, as\nEmperor Charles V’s harsh reaction to Vitoria’s lecture\nDe Indis showed. \nVitoria’s health became precarious in the 1540s, and the\ndominant role at Salamanca passed to his disciples. The most important\nof these was Domingo de Soto, who was born in Segovia 1494 of humble\norigins, studied in Alcalá and Paris, entered the Dominican\norder before he was thirty and was appointed to the second chair of\ntheology, the Catedra de visperas, at the University of\nSalamanca in 1532. Later he became the prior of the Convent of San\nEsteban in Salamanca and was from 1548–1550 confessor to Charles\nV. After this, he returned to the university, where he held the first\nchair of theology. He died at San Esteban in 1560. Together with\nMelchior Cano, another important disciple of Vitoria, who later became\nbishop of the Canary Islands, he participated in the Council of Trent\n(1545–1563) by order of Spain’s privy council. Soto,\nalthough without a vote in the council, urged bishops to attend to the\nwork of preaching; and he defended Scholastic theology against\nproposals to suppress it. Before returning to Spain, Soto helped with\nthe preparations for Charles V’s Augsburg Interim (1548), which\nmade concessions to the Protestants. One result of Soto’s\npresence at Trent was his tract De natura et gratia, which\nfocused on the errors of Martin Luther, whose writings he called\n“diabolic” (Soto-DII VII, qu. 5 ad. 4; Grimm 2017: 64). In\naddition, he wrote an Apologia against a fellow Dominican,\nAmbrosius Catharinus Politus, concerning the certitude of grace. \nMelchior Cano was less involved in controversy at Trent, concentrating\ninstead on preaching and sacramental theology; however, another\nDominican present at the council, Bartolomé Carranza\n(1503–1576), the future archbishop of Toledo, participated in\nthe discussion of justification, arguing for “twofold\njustification”. Carranza was reported to be reading\nLuther’s works, a sign of future troubles in which his\nCommentary on the Christian Catechism was criticized by both\nCano and Soto. Eventually, Carranza was condemned by the Inquisition\nfor his views on nature and grace and underwent a long imprisonment,\ndespite Soto’s efforts to defend him with a more balanced\nopinion, which Carranza cited in his own defense (Tellechea 1962). \nVitoria and his disciples engaged in arguments over Spain’s\nrights in the New World. The debate began when the Dominicans in the\nAntilles criticized the conquerors’ treatment of indigenous\npeoples. In a sermon given by the Dominican friar Antonio de\nMontesinos on December 21, the fourth Sunday of Advent 1511, in\nHispaniola (today’s Haiti and Dominican Republic), the Spaniards\nwho attended were told that they lived and died in mortal sin because\nof the cruelties they had inflicted upon the Amerindians. One of his\nlisteners was Bartolomé de Las Casas (1474–1566), who\njoined the Dominican order and was converted by Montesinos into the\nmost severe critic of the Conquista (Las Casas 1992). \nA Junta of Burgos (1513) declared that Charles V had a sound title to\nthe Indies. One argument in that context, grounded in\nAristotle’s thought, was that the Amerindians were slaves by\nnature. This view did not remain uncontested; and, eventually, on June\n2, 1537, Pope Paul III, influenced by Las Casas, issued the bull\nSublimis Deus, declaring the indigenous peoples to be fully\nhuman with souls and just title to their possessions. The ongoing\ndebate climaxed in the disputation between Las Casas, defending the\nliberty of the indigenous populations, and the humanist Aristotelian\nJuan Ginés de Sepúlveda (1494–1573), who defended\nthe Spanish title to the Indies because of the Amerindian’s sins\nand because they were slaves by nature. This took place in the Junta\nof Valladolid (1550/51), which Charles V had assembled with a number\nof other leading scholars on both sides. \nAfter the deaths of Domingo de Soto and Melchior Cano, the reputation\nof Salamanca’s Dominicans declined. Domingo Bañez\n(1528–1604), a pupil of Cano, is the best known of their\nsuccessors. When his commentary on Thomas’ Summa\nappeared (1584), admitting of no dissent from its doctrines, it\nprovoked a controversy over the theology of grace and free will.\nBañez—also the confessor of St. Theresa of\nAvila—was opposed by the Jesuit Luis de Molina, who accused him\nof being overly deterministic. \nMolina was born in Cuenca (Spain) in 1535, entered the Jesuit order at\nthe age of 18, studied in Salamanca and Coimbra, taught theology in\nÉvora (Portugal) from 1568 to 1583 and later in Lisbon. In 1591\nhe was sent to the Jesuit college of his home town of Cuenca and was\nelected in 1600 to the chair of moral theology at the Jesuit College\nin Madrid, where he died in the same year. In 1588 Molina published a\nvolume entitled Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina\npraescientia, providentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione\nconcordia (Molina 1588 [1953]), usually abbreviated as\nConcordia, in which he tried to reconcile free will with\ngrace, God’s pre-knowledge, providence, etc. It produced a\ndevastating effect (see below and MacGregor 2015), a passionate debate\nbetween Dominicans and Jesuits, raising accusations of both Pelagian\nand Calvinist heresy, both of which were extremely dangerous for\nCatholic theologians. This controversy continued until a congregation\nDe auxiliis meeting in Rome under Paul V decreed (1607) that\nDominicans and Jesuits could hold their own opinions on efficacious\ngrace. The conflict did not end, however, and in 1611 the Roman\nInquisition forbade the publication of any further books on the\ntopic—the most drastic case of ecclesiastical censorship in the\nseventeenth century (Knebel 2000: 170). \nIn general, the Jesuits felt less bound than Dominicans to the\nopinions of Thomas Aquinas, which meant that Molina and Suárez\nwere allowed a greater degree of originality in their teachings. For\nthis reason, some modern scholars emphasize the differences between\nthe Dominican School of Salamanca and the Jesuit School of Coimbra,\nwhich came after it, though both belong to the broad tradition of\nSpanish Scholasticism. \nSuárez was a student at Salamanca in 1561, when he joined the\nSociety of Jesus. He was an educator, settling eventually in Coimbra,\nwhere he produced a tract De legibus ac Deo legislatore\n(1612). As a polemicist, he intervened in the quarrel over the oath of\nallegiance imposed by James I on English Catholics after the Gunpowder\nPlot (1605). Suárez and his Jesuit contemporary Robert\nBellarmine were the most important Catholic writers on political and\necclesiological issues following the Council of Trent. \nWith the death of Suárez, the School of Salamanca and its\noffshoots lost their creative edge. Instead, there was an urge to\nrecapitulation. The Discalced Carmelites produced an enormous\ncompilation of past thought, the Cursus Theologiae Moralis;\nand the publication of its third volume in 1670 is often treated as\nmarking the end of the School of Salamanca. \nA common theological topic for the authors of the School of Salamanca\nwas the need to resist what they considered to be Lutheran heresies\n(Skinner 1978: 135–173). They suspected, for instance, that\nconnecting legal authority to the virtue of princes could\n“inveigle away the hearts of simple men from due obedience to\ntheir princes and their priests”, as Vitoria put it (De\npotestate ecclesiastica I qu. 1, art. 2; transl. Vitoria 1991b:\n55); and they regarded as heretical the view that grace is not\nincreased directly by the sacraments ex opere operato but\nrequires the faith of the recipient (De potestate\necclesiastica I qu. 2, art. 2). Other points at issue were\nwhether all Christians could be seen as priests (ibid., II qu. 2, art.\n1), the role of papacy, the veneration of the Virgin Mary, and the\ncentral problem of free will, which was denied by Luther. As we shall\nsee, the problem of free will and grace also gave rise to an extremely\nbitter and long-lasting controversy inside Catholicism after the\nCouncil of Trent between Dominicans and Jesuits. \nVitoria’s awareness of the challenge of Luther to Catholicism\naffected his teaching and that of his successors. In his\nRelectiones de potestate ecclesiastica (1532–1533) and\nRelectio de potestate papae et concilii (1534), he was\ncritical of the Roman curia, especially on account of its free-handed\ndistribution of dispensations; but he was careful not to open the way\nfor any assault on the papacy and Catholic orthodoxy. \nVitoria’s basic ecclesiology was traditional, identifying the\necclesia as the “congregation of the faithful”.\nWhen heretics left this community, they did so like deserters from an\narmy. The Church received its power from Christ, which was distinct\nfrom that of lay regimes, in order to promote good and resist evil.\nThe priesthood of the New Law superseded that of the Old Law. The\nChurch’s power had two aspects: orders and jurisdiction. Orders\ninvolved the sacraments, especially the eucharist and penance.\nJurisdiction included spiritual censures inflicted on erring\nbelievers. By divine command, the Church was a “perfect”\ncommunity, that is, one which was able to defend itself and punish\niniquity. \nChrist established the papacy to look after the Church’s\nwelfare. Priests administered the sacraments under the supervision of\nthe pope and the bishops. Orders came via the apostles but\njurisdiction via Peter, Christ’s vicar. It was the\nresponsibility of his successors, the popes, to build up the Church.\nBishops legislated for their diocese or province, but the pope acted\nfor the whole Church. Vitoria expressed great respect for general\ncouncils as gatherings of bishops, but he maintained that a council\ndid not have power superior to that of the pope. Moreover, after\nconsidering the councils of the fifteenth century, which had resolved\nthe Great Western Schism (1378–1417), he denied conciliarism in\nits dogmatic form. The most ancient councils had not claimed that\nsupreme power was invested in the Church. \nSpiritual power was superior to temporal, but that did not make the\npope lord of the world. Papal power could have an impact on Christian\nregimes, making and unmaking rulers, but only for spiritual ends. The\npontiff could authorize just wars against the Saracens and other\nenemies of the faith. The ecclesiastical commonwealth had its powers\nfrom grace, but grace did not cancel nature. On the contrary:\naccording to Thomas Aquinas “grace presupposes nature and\nperfects it” (“Gratia praesupponit naturam et perficit\neam”: Summa theologiae I qu. I art. 8 ad 2). \nThe topic of grace and free will was the main ingredient of the\ncontroversy over Molinism. It began with the work of Molina mentioned\nabove, Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia,\nprovidentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia (Molina\n1588 [1953]), in which he explains how God can preserve his\nomnipotence, providence, and pre-knowledge, while conceding free will\nto humans, by means of his scientia media, or “middle\nknowledge”, which gives him the ability to know what human\nbeings will decide—but no control over their decisions.\nScientia media is placed between scientia naturalis,\nby which God knows everything that can be, and scientia\nlibera, by which he knows what will be. Molina places God’s\ncounterfactual knowledge before the creation—contrary to Luther\nand Calvin. God’s omnipotence consists in the possibility that\nhe could have created beings without the capacity to accept or reject\nthe offer of grace by their will (Concordia pars IV, disp.\n52). Furthermore, humans are able by their free will, without the\nspecial help of God (“sine auxilio speciali Dei”:\nConcordia pars I, disp. 5; Molina 1588 [1953: 29]), but only\nwith his concursus generale, to act morally in a temporal\nsense; however, they need grace within temporal life and God’s\nspecial help for the effort to receive eternal grace, i.e., the\nvisio beatifica, the vision of God of the blessed after their\ndeath. In the ensuing controversy, known as De auxiliis,\nfierce criticisms came from the Dominican Domingo Bañez, who\nhad the first chair of theology at Salamanca, and his pupils; they\nheld a special Thomist theory of grace, which referred to the\npraedeterminatio physica, mankind’s inability to resist\nGod’s grace. \nIt is easy to forget that Suárez was concerned not only with\nmetaphysics and law; but he has also been described as the founder of\nMariology on account of his treatment of the Immaculate Conception and\nMary’s bodily assumption. Suárez took a balanced view of\nthe issues of divine foreknowledge, free will, and predestination in\nthe De auxiliis controversy; and, building on Molina, he\ndeveloped the doctrine of Congruism, which argued that God had\narranged matters to allow free will to assent to grace. He also\ndiscussed how God rewards the good and punishes sinners. \nSuárez was a confirmed papalist, who regarded the Holy See as\nnecessary to the Church’s unity. Canon law existed as a distinct\naspect of human law, supporting humanity’s higher ends and\nunifying all peoples. The pope was divinely guided in pronouncements\non doctrine, and he had a universal responsibility to spread the\ngospel. Suárez, however, refused to accept evangelization as an\nexcuse for war. Not even unnatural acts justified the use of violence.\nConsequently, Suárez, like Vitoria and Soto, upheld the\nlegitimacy of non-Christian regimes operating within the bounds of\nnatural law. \nOne of the generally acknowledged merits of the School of Salamanca\nwas the revival of natural law or at least its Thomist version. This\nwas more or less closely connected to commentaries on the second part\nof Thomas Aquinas’ Summa theologiae. Vitoria’s\nlectures on the quaestiones 90–105 of the Prima\nsecundae, entitled De lege, dealing with the different\nkinds of law, and his voluminous commentary on the Secunda\nsecundae are now available in critical editions by Vicente\nBeltrán de Heredia. Molina described his monumental De\niustitia et iure, which in current forms of printing would take\nup around 6,000 pages, as a commentary on quaestiones\n57–79 in the Secunda secundae of the Summa\ntheologiae, but he admitted that he was not following Thomas\nprecisely and that his theory covered a wider range compared to what\nhad been discussed by “Divus Thomas”. Whether the ten\nvolumes of Suárez’s De legibus ac Deo\nlegislatore are primarily to be seen as a commentary on\nquaestiones 90–108 of the Prima secundae is\nstill debated by modern scholars. Soto, who is mentioned by\nSuárez as one of his main sources besides Thomas Aquinas,\ncommented on questions from both the Prima secundae and\nSecunda secundae in the ten books of his extremely\ninfluential treatise De iustitia et iure. The common\nbackground for all the authors of the School of Salamanca, as well as\ntheir Jesuit successors, who dealt with law, natural law, and justice\nwas, therefore, Thomas Aquinas’s division of the different kinds\nof law in the Prima secundae and his reflections on the\ndifferent meanings of justice, law, and right from the Secunda\nsecundae, whether they followed him or not. \nThe classification of laws in the Summa (Ia IIae, qu.\n91–4) begins with God’s regulation of the universe via the\neternal law, manifest to humans through revealed divine law and\nthrough natural law, which was accessible by reason. Humans, even\nthose lacking revelation, could derive from natural law the principles\nfor enacting human law. Human law, inevitably, had to be adapted to\ntime, place and climate and was, therefore, limited. Nor was reason\nable to craft laws covering all contingencies. They had to be useful\nto the commonwealth and also mutable if circumstances changed.\nDispensations were required where a law did not apply in a particular\ncase. Disobeying laws was a vice, while obeying them was a virtue.\nDivine law, embodied in the Old Law or the New Law, which regulated\ncontingent elements of religious cult, but also the punishment of\nthose who had escaped human justice, was in accordance with natural\nlaw and eternal law: it just had its specific functions. Human laws\nwere invalid if they contradicted either divine or natural law. In the\nquaestiones 57–79 of the Secunda secundae,\nThomas addressed questions such as “Whether right is the object\nof justice”, and “What is justice?”; he also\ndiscussed judgment, kinds of justice, restitution, injustice, kinds of\ninjustice, and so on.  \nVitoria followed this schema in his lectures on the Summa\ntheologiae, especially in his 1533–1534 lectures and in his\ncommentary. He treated law as made by “reason and\nenlightenment”, not just the will. Natural law, derived from\neternal law by reason, was binding on all humanity; its principles\napplied to mutable situations and different peoples. God was the\nindirectly cause of human laws, which were binding on the conscience\nof individuals. There was a human urge to obey natural law, for\nexample, by honoring one’s parents, preferably out of love.\nFailure to heed these precepts was a moral fault.  \nThe gospel was valid when promulgated by Christ, but barbarians\nignorant of the gospel might violate its commands in a pardonable way.\nThe Church had general laws which were applicable anywhere, and\nfailure to obey them was sinful. Human legislators could enact laws\nfavoring religion, but they must not confuse their role with that of\nthe clergy under divine law.  \nHuman laws were intended to serve the common good, not the interests\nof the legislator, who was “the servant of the\ncommonwealth”. Any “perfect” community, sacred or\nsecular, had the power to make and enforce laws. Human laws were\nbinding once publicly promulgated; but the Church had its laws from\nGod. The Church had one ruler on earth, the pope, the vicar of Christ,\njust as the universe was ruled by God; but, like other rulers, the\nRoman pontiff delegated power for its effective exercise. \nDespite the preeminent place that Thomas Aquinas occupied for these\nauthors, there are significant deviations from the Thomist concept of\nnatural law that are shared by some of them, who at times also\ndirectly criticized the “Doctor Angelicus”. Suárez,\nfor instance, says that law has to be seen as something that rules the\nbehavior of beings capable of free decisions (De legibus I\niii 2); therefore, Thomas’ concept of an eternal law that rules\nthe whole universe can be understood as a law only in a metaphorical\nsense. There are still ongoing debates as to whether eternal law can\nbe seen as the theological basis of all other kinds of law\n(Schweighöfer 2018: 234–256). Natural law, for Thomas, on\nthe one hand, is known to humans because of their participation as\nrational beings in eternal law, but, on the other, it is at least\npartially shared with animals (Summa theologiae Ia IIae qu.\n95 art. 4 ad 1; IIa IIae qu. 57 art. 3 co) in parallel to Roman Law\n(Digest 1,1,1,4). Its role for Thomas was labeled as something like a\n“style”, i.e., a universal principle (Westerman 1998: 81)\ngoverning animate nature. For Suárez it becomes a device to\nrule the behavior of humans as rational beings who are responsible for\ntheir activities. It not only contains the most general principles of\nlaw, leaving the more detailed regulations to human law, but also\neverything that follows logically from these principles; otherwise not\neven the ten commandments would belong to natural law. According to\nSuárez, natural law is the voice of right reason which effects\nhuman behavior via man’s conscience, and  \na man who is led by this law is said to be his own law, because he has\nthe law written within himself. (“dicitur homo, qui illo\nducitur, sibi lex, quia habet in se scriptam legem”: De\nlegibus II v 9–10)  \nThis conceptual shift was initiated at least implicitly by Vitoria in\nhis commentary on quaestio 57. Thomas gives as an example of\nwhat is just by nature in an absolute sense the natural inclination of\nthe male to the female for the sake of procreation and the efforts of\nparents to nurture their children. Vitoria replaces these examples by\nthe obligation to return deposits and the Golden Rule. This\nmoralization of natural law is not found in all the authors under\nconsideration. Molina, for example, argues that someone who uses the\nextreme poverty of another to make that person his slave, instead of\nproviding help without imposing conditions, commits a sin against\ncharity; but the contract is valid according to natural law\n(Molina-DII II, disp. 34).  \nThe Salamancan theologians and their successors not only discussed and\nmodified Thomist natural law but also referred to other sources with\nslightly different categorizations, such as the distinction between\nius humanum and ius naturale vel divinum made by\nIsidore of Seville (Liber etymologiarum, lib. 5 c.\n2–18, Isidori Hispalensis episcopi etymologiarum libro\nXX, 1833), cited in\nDecretum Gratiani (Friedberg [ed.], Corpus Iuris\nCanonici, vol. 1, 1–5) and discussed by Soto (Soto-DII I,\nqu. V, art. iii and iv). There were many further differences among\nthem on natural law, as on law in general. For instance, with regard\nto whether law was an act of will or an act of intellect, some, like\nSoto, favored the intellect despite his early education in\nNominalist-dominated Paris, where voluntarism, an emphasis on the will\nover the intellect, prevailed; others, like Suárez, gave some\nrelevance to the will. Nevertheless, they were in agreement that the\nprinciples of natural law were inscribed in the heart of humans, so\nthat “no human being can plead ignorance as an excuse”, as\nSoto put it (Soto-DII I, qu. I art. 4; translated in Hamilton 1963:\n15). Suárez’s concept of law has been described as\nvoluntarist, but reason still played a significant role in his\nthought. Reason diagnosed situations, identifying possible remedies;\nbut the will implemented these measures. These deliberations happened\nwithin the context of immutable natural law, which Suárez\nbelieved was known through specific precepts. In addition, he held\nthat individual virtue lay in following right reason. Reason’s\ndictates were unique to human beings, not impulses shared with\nanimals. The laws common to many peoples, though not universal, made\nup the ius gentium. What may seem at first glance an\nacknowledgment of the moral competence of all human beings was also\nused to justify punishment, including war and enslavement, against\npeoples from other continents. \nIt is the ius gentium, not natural law, that regulates the\ndistribution of property and the enslavement of human beings. The\nimmutable natural law, however, gives permission for these activities,\nbecause, after the Fall, the circumstances of its application changed\ndramatically, making an enforced regulation of possession necessary\n(see, e.g., Suárez, De legibus L I xvi 7). Although\nproperty—or dominium as it was called—is not part\nof human nature, according to the majority of Salamancan thinkers and\ntheir followers, there are many reflections by different authors\narguing for the advantages of private property. Soto and Molina make\ndirect use of Aristotelian and Thomist arguments, saying that common\nownership would prevent men from working and from taking care of their\nthings to the disadvantage of the common good (Soto-DII IV, 3;\nMolina-DII II, 19; see Chafuen 2003: 3–38). There are\ndifferences concerning the way in which dominium in this\nsense is bound by regulations from positive and natural law. Most\nauthors, such as Vitoria, in his commentary on quaestio 66 in\nthe Secunda secundae of the Summa theologiae,\naccepted the Thomist view that those in extreme need are entitled to\ntake what is necessary for their survival. Martin de Azpilcueta\n(1491–1586), known as “Doctor Navarrus” or\n“Navarro”, however, held that there is no obligation to\ndonate to those who are in extreme need and that anyone who receives\nsuch a donation must see it as a loan, not as something of his own\n(Chafuen 2003: 44). \nSome of these theologians adopted an understanding of the word\nius in the sense of right, even subjective right. This is not\na Salamancan invention but seems to have been initiated in the glosses\nto the Decretum Gratiani and enforced by authors like Ockham\nand Gerson (Tierney 1997). But it plays an important role in arguments\non dominium—a term that oscillates between domination\nand property—and in reflections on the ius gentium. The\nfirst lecture of Vitoria’s De Indis deals with the\nquestion of whether the Indians may be called veri domini,\nthat is, real masters or real possessors, of their goods, and the\nthird lecture claims that they violated the rights of the Spaniards.\nMolina takes this subjective meaning of ius as the\nparadigmatic understanding of the term throughout his voluminous\ntreatise De iustitia et iure. He defines ius as  \na faculty to do or have something or to maintain it or to behave in\nany way such that if it is hindered without legitimate reason an\ninjury is done to the person who has it. This way, that right, in this\nmeaning, becomes something like a measure of injury: because as much\nas it is opposed and damaged without legitimate reason, injury is done\nto the one who has it. (Molina-DII II, 1)  \nThough it may be exaggerated to call the School of Salamanca the\ncradle of human rights, individual rights are pivotal for a number of\ntheir arguments. Molina states that a slave may have a ius qua\nhomo, even in the special case of a right to things he has won\nfrom his master in gambling and suchlike. Furthermore, he declares\nthat an injustice toward someone is a violation of that person’s\nrights, and he gives a number of examples where injustice is done\ntoward a slave and must be corrected or punished. We may, therefore.\nconclude that slaves also have rights in his system (Molina-DII II,\n38). \nThe central topics in the political theory of authors from the School\nof Salamanca are the aim of political community, the legitimacy of its\npower and the relationship between the commonwealth and its ruler. \nIn his lecture On Civil Power (De potestate civili),\nVitoria holds that every power, public or private, comes from God and\ncannot be abolished by human beings, not even if they are in full\nconsensus. Vitoria’s ideas about society depended partly on his\nAristotelian belief that human beings are social by nature, needing\nothers to survive and achieve a good life. Thus, a natural good,\nsurvival, not moral goodness, was its original purpose. Nature,\nfollowing God’s purpose, had implanted in early peoples the urge\nto establish households, cities, and regimes. Society eventually came\nto promote virtues, especially justice and amity, which supported the\ncommon good. He followed in a certain sense an Aristotelian line,\nusing the theory of the four causes for his analysis, first of public,\nthen of private power, and starting with the final cause, which was\nregarded in the Aristotelian and Thomist tradition as the necessary\ncause. According to Vitoria, “the origin of human cities and\ncommonwealths was not a human invention … but a device\nimplanted by nature in man for his own survival” and for the\nsake of this it also needs an “ordering force” (ibid., qu.\n1, art. 2, p. 9). The efficient cause of public power is God, and its\nmaterial cause is the commonwealth itself. Royal power is not from the\ncommonwealth, even if the king is elected, but from God himself\n(ibid., qu. 1 art. 5). Non-Christians have legitimate rulers, and a\nlegitimately constituted power cannot be abolished by the consent of\nthe people (ibid., qu.1. art 6–7). \nAll peoples created regimes: since a multitude could not govern itself\nwell, power was entrusted to a group or individual acting for the\ncommon good. The best regime, in Vitoria’s opinion, was rule by\none person, who was both above the community and within it.\nIndividuals might even sacrifice their lives in defense of the common\ngood. Society’s natural purpose, the preservation of temporal\nlife of its members, was not in contradiction to the Church’s\nend: the salvation of souls. In a Christian commonwealth, salvation\nwas the primary purpose, with human felicity as the secondary end. The\ncommonwealth transferred its power to the ruler, but his power\nultimately derived from God; and after its transfer of power to the\nruler, the commonwealth ceased to be able to legislate. Since the\nruler was within the commonwealth, he was bound by its laws. Vitoria\nstates that monarchy is the best form of government, but insists that\na whole commonwealth may be punished for the sins of its king, if he,\nfor example, wages an unjust war against another prince (ibid., qu. 1\nart. 8–9). This commonplace among the theorists of the ius\ngentium was important for some of the justifications of slavery\nand the slave trade, because captives in a just war traditionally\nbecame slaves and because the punishment of a whole commonwealth\ndecided the fate of all its members, regardless of their individual\nguilt or innocence. \nOnce different temporal regimes were created, each ruler was situated\nwithin a commonwealth. The ruler of France could not legislate for\nSpain. A ruler with multiple realms, like Emperor Charles V, had to\npromulgate laws in each region. Within a realm, custom was supposed to\nreinforce law or to be enforced itself. A ruler was best advised to\nsupport good customs. Vitoria faced the possibility that some laws\nmight be obeyed only by a few citizens, in which case they could be\nrevoked by the ruler. Revoking laws arbitrarily, however, might be\nsinful. Even a tyrant’s laws had to be obeyed if they served the\ncommon good. Vitoria claimed that legislators are bound by civil laws\n(ibid., qu. 3 art. 4), but that the laws of tyrant are valid (ibid.,\nqu. 3 art. 6), a view which conflicts with positions later held by\nJesuits. The community, according to Vitoria, retained the right to\ndefend itself against a tyrant threatening its survival, but it could\nnot abolish a licit regime. The regime did not have to be Christian,\nbut a non-Christian regime could not be overthrown solely on the\ngrounds of injustice. \nSoto never denied that God is the ultimate origin of the Christian\ncommonwealth, but he distinguished between the natural and\nsupernatural order and held that, in the natural, temporal order,\npeace and tranquility have to be guaranteed by the commonwealth and\ncan be identified with the bonum commune (Grimm 2017:\n74–77; Soto-DII I, qu.1 art. 2). This internal peace, the\nbonum commune, is the aim of any legitimate law; on the other\nhand, it is stabilized by just laws, which are more easily waged by a\npeaceful society. In this way, the theologians of the School of\nSalamanca implicitly paved the way for a secular understanding of the\nstate as a human institution that preserves peace and prosperity\nwithin a society. There are differences between some of the authors\nconcerning the anthropological question of whether human organizations\nand the distribution of property were already to be found in statu\ninnocentiae or only later, after the Fall, when domination and\nproperty became necessary because of human weakness. \nMolina explained why and how domination was introduced after the Fall,\ncoining the term dominium iurisdictionis for temporal power,\nin contrast to dominium proprietatis (Molina-DII II, 20; II,\n22; II, 23; Brett 2011), in order to avoid the equivocal use of the\nterm dominium that had confused discussions since the debate\non Franciscan poverty in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Brett\n1997). The political authority of the commonwealth—res\npublica—is directly given by God, as it was difficult to\nimagine that there was a new contract in every generation.\nNevertheless, the power (potestas) of the government comes\nonly indirectly from God and directly from the republic (Molina-DII\nII, 26.4). Molina accepted the common Salamancan view that communities\nhad transferred power to rulers. \nAll dominion was founded on natural reason, shared even by\nnon-Christians. “Government is the channel through which the\nnatural power of the commonwealth is exercised” (Costello 1974:\n49). Therefore, if a government misuses its power by trying to\nexercise a dominium proprietatis over its citizen, that is,\ntreating them like slaves, there is a right to resist. This also holds\nfor a king, notwithstanding that, for Molina, monarchy was the best\nform of government (Molina-DII II, 23.10). While this resistance has\nto be supported by the common will of the citizens in the case of\nabuse of power by a legitimate ruler, every citizen has the right to\nkill an illegitimate usurper of power (Molina-DII III, 6.2). \nSuárez believed that individual peoples reached agreement on\nthe need for government. God then granted rulers power to direct\nhumanity toward its proper ends. Critics of his thought like Robert\nFilmer objected to bringing in God at this late stage, in order to\nexplain the formation of regimes, rather than emphasizing his role in\nthe creation of commonwealths since Adam (Filmer 1680: chap. II 2).\nSuárez thought that it was the responsibility of the ruler to\npromote harmony between subjects, to exercise power well, and to enact\nlaws to perfect the community. He also treated the relationship of law\nto conscience and that of ecclesiastical to lay powers. Like many\nrepresentatives of Spanish Scholasticism, Suárez favored\nmonarchy, within limits, as the best regime. Individuals had the right\nto self-defense, as did the society as a whole, and they might resist\na ruler who acted badly. Suárez even contemplated the\npossibility that tyrants could be killed for threatening the survival\nof the commonwealth. In his polemics against King James I of England,\nhe argued for the immunity of the Church from control by lay regimes.\nThe English oath, the so-called oath of allegiance that King James had\nrequired his subjects to take in 1606, the year after the Gunpowder\nPlot, he said, violated this immunity and undermined obedience to the\nRoman pontiff in spiritual matters. Suárez was willing to\nbelieve that the pope could exhort the people to rise up against a\ntyrant or to invoke the aid of outsiders against one. Except in such\ncases, however, Christians were to obey their lay rulers in conformity\nwith natural law. This right to resistance was widely taken for\ngranted by the Jesuits and considerably expanded by Juan de Mariana\n(1536–1624). Although recent scholarship has cast doubt on the\ntraditional labeling of Mariana as an early exponent of popular\nsovereignty (Braun 2007), the Catholic zealot who assassinated Henry\nIV of France in 1610 is known to have referred to his writings.  \nAmong the most influential elements in the works from the School of\nSalamanca are those connected to what was called the ius\ngentium until the late eighteenth century but is nowadays\nreferred to as international law. Firstly, they separated the ius\ngentium from natural law, with which it had more or less been\nidentified with since the formulation of Roman Law; secondly, they\ndeveloped a martial law on the basis of quaestio 40 in the\nSecunda secundae of Thomas Aquinas’s Summa\ntheologiae; and thirdly, they treated the alleged right to\nenslave non-European human beings. \nWhen James Brown Scott (1934: 3, 160) called Vitoria the father of\nmodern international law, it was mainly in reference to his lectures\non the problems associated with the Indies. Vitoria’s opinions\non this matter loomed large in this debate. He addressed the Indies in\nthree relectiones: De temperantia (1537), De\nIndis (1539), and De iure belli (1539). In the first of\nthese he discussed cannibalism, while in the others he considered\nwhether a just war could be waged against indigenous peoples and\nwhether Spain’s title to the Indies was valid. In addition,\nVitoria, lecturing on the Summa theologiae (1534), discussed\nevangelization. His account of the right to rule also extended to the\nrole of the clergy in evangelizing peoples who, before 1492, had never\nheard of Christ. \nAs mentioned above, in the first of his three lectures De\nIndis, delivered in the summer of 1539, he shows that the\nAmerindians were veri domini of their goods, even if they\nwere unbelievers, sinners, and irrational (Vitoria 1991b:\n239–250). He discussed the argument from Aristotle that\n“barbarians” were little better than animals, madmen or\nthose lacking sense, then he turned to an argument of apologists for\nthe Conquista, claiming that Amerindians were infidels,\nliving in a perpetual state of mortal sin, requiring Christian\nintervention. He dismissed the argument from sin, on the grounds that\nsin did not cancel natural dominium. Brute beasts lacked such\nrights, but even children and the mad, although they had guardians,\nnevertheless had property rights. Aristotle wrote about those who\nneeded direction from others, but this did not negate ownership.\nVitoria extended rightful ownership even to Saracens. He blamed the\npoor education of indigenous peoples, which he compared to that of\nmany European peasants, for their depraved condition. Slavery, he\nadded, was a legal or civil construct. No one was a slave by\nnature. \nThe second lecture lists seven “unjust titles” for the war\nagainst the Amerindians. Vitoria rejected the idea that either the\nemperor or the pope is master of the world. He denied that Emperor\nCharles V could take away the domains of others. He cited Juan de\nTorquemada’s Summa de ecclesia to prove that the\npope’s supremacy was spiritual, not temporal; and he maintained\nthat the pope could not force unbelievers to convert. According to\nVitoria, discovery was not a justification for conquest; and he\nrefuted the view that sins against nature like cannibalism and incest,\nwhich were exceptions to the natural immunity that canon law allowed\nto non-believers, justified conquest. There were sinners in every\nnation, but the pope was not entitled to wage war against Christians\nwho were guilty of sin. Furthermore, neither the alleged voluntary\nchoice of the Amerindians nor the idea of a gift from God could\njustify the conquest of their territory (Vitoria 1991b:\n252–276). \nThe third lecture, finally, lists eight “just titles” for\nthe war against Amerindians, among them the violation of the right of\nSpaniards to travel in the Indies and to conduct missions, the\nprotection of innocents, etc. (Vitoria 1991b: 278–291). Vitoria\nargued for free intercourse between all peoples: indigenous rulers\ncould not exclude Christians from their lands, and Christian travelers\nattacked by the local inhabitants had the right of self-defense.\nSpanish children born in the New World were able to choose, under\nnatural law and the ius gentium, to become citizens of the\ncountry where they resided. Vitoria also argued for the right to\nevangelize. Christians could intervene to protect converts, allies,\nand friends. He warned, however, that waging war on indigenous peoples\nmight obstruct conversion. Vitoria weakened his defense of the Indians\nby saying that Spain might govern them for their own benefit. The\nindigenous peoples might even be treated “partly as\nslaves”. Moreover, once large-scale conversions had taken place,\nSpain could not abandon the New World. \nIn De temperantia Vitoria stated that all nations regarded\ncannibalism as an abomination. A prince might convert and suppress\nevil customs like human sacrifice on the grounds of justice; but\nforeign princes could not intervene. Vitoria also dismissed arguments\nfrom sins against nature as calumnies intended to excuse warfare and\nplunder. \nVitoria and the other authors of the School of Salamanca dealt with\nmartial law and developed a theory of just wars that was, on the one\nhand, based on Thomas Aquinas’ arguments and, on the other hand,\nbuilt on the foundation of the “classical doctrine of just\nwar” (Orend 2006). Vitoria dealt with just war in his lecture\nDe Indis relectio posterior sive De iure belli. He discusses\nwho can wage war—private persons only for self-defense, the\ncommonwealth, and the prince also for other reasons (Vitoria 1991b:\n299–302); what cannot be considered just reasons for waging war,\nsuch as difference in religion and enlargement of empire (1991b:\n302–304); what can be done in a just war (1991b: 304–306,\n314–317); and the view that it may not be enough if a prince\nbelieves that his war is just (1991b: 306–7). Vitoria regarded\n“perfect” commonwealths as able to defend themselves from\ninternal and external threats. The right of self-defense permitted the\nuse of force to repel force. A society, pagan or Christian, could wage\na just war in self-defense and execute malefactors. Vitoria accepted\nrepelling invaders and avenging injury as justifications for war, but\nnot the invasion of realms in order to acquire land, slaves or\nplunder. Religious difference and the vainglory of princes were also\nnot sufficient reasons. Those in authority could declare and wage war,\nbut they should take counsel about this. Subjects could not refuse\nservice in a just war. All necessary means were acceptable in a just\nconflict, even entering an enemy’s territory. Vitoria, however,\napplied a criterion of proportional harm to wars, so that a war was\nunjust if it caused more harm than good. Moreover, a ruler who had\nwaged an unjust war was obliged to make restitution. Booty could\nrecompense property unjustly seized by an enemy, but only if taken on\na superior’s orders. Vitoria permitted enslaving Saracens\ndefeated in a just conflict, but he denied that Christians could\nenslave other Christians. Moreover, he denounced devices used in\ncapturing slaves for export. Overall, Christians were expected to\nabide by the rules of war, showing moderation and humility when\nvictorious. \nSimilar ideas—legitimate authority; just cause, which only one\nside can have; trying all other ways of conflict resolution;\netc.—can be found in Suárez’ De bello, the\nthirteenth disputation of his De caritate. Molina, however,\nseems to have believed that, at least from a subjective point of view,\nboth sides may believe that their cause is just (Fernandes 2014). \nAccording to Molina, moreover, the ius gentium was not\nentirely a part of natural law, since it affirmed natural principles\nbut also embodied positive laws, including private property and\nslavery. Generally, it was in the period between Vitoria and\nSuárez that natural law was separated from the ius\ngentium, further divided by Suárez into the ius supra\ngentes (the law above nations) and the ius inter gentes\n(the law among nations), which eventually became international law in\nthe strict sense. Natural law and ius gentium were quite\nclose to each other in Roman Law and in Thomas Aquinas; but Vitoria,\nin his commentary on quaestio 57 in the Secunda\nsecundae of the Summa theologiae, already maintained\nthat, for Thomas, the ius gentium was part of positive law.\nSuárez makes it clear that, in contrast to natural law, which\nis inscribed in the heart of human beings and is immutably valid for\nall of them, the ius gentium is a positive convention among\npeoples or nations, which is valid for all or nearly for all of them;\nit includes the right to punish those who are defeated in a just war\nand, therefore, also the right of enslavement (De legibus II\nxviii 8). \nIt was furthermore the consensus among a majority of authors in the\nSchool of Salamanca that no wars could be waged against non-Christians\nby reason of their infidelity and that hostile actions could be\nresisted in self-defense. As we have seen, however, this natural\nimmunity did not extend to permitting cannibalism or human sacrifice.\nMolina, who favored the right to evangelize and permitted armed\nprotection for missionaries, was more wary than Vitoria of making free\ncommerce a right enforceable by war, using arguments which are\nsomewhat similar to those of Immanuel Kant, limiting\n“cosmopolitan right … to conditions of universal\nhospitality” in his treatise Toward Perpetual Peace\n(Kant 1795 [1996: 328–331]). For Molina as for Kant, the locals\nhave merely charitable obligations toward those who arrive in their\nterritories, if they are in need. They have no obligation to open them\ntheir ports. Countries might refuse to trade if they feared that\ncommerce was an excuse for conquest (Molina-DII II, 105). Just wars\ncould be waged by rulers, but hating the enemy was prohibited.\nSubjects were obliged to inquire about a ruler’s decision to\nwage a just war if there was “honest doubt” about it.\nMolina was willing to concede to the pope a role mediating between\nChristian rulers, but he warned against intervening directly in their\nsquabbles. \nOne of the recurring questions with respect to the treatment of\nindigenous peoples was whether their enslavement as slaves by nature\nin the traditional Aristotelian sense was justified. As mentioned\nabove, a famous discussion of this issue took place at the Junta of\nValladolid, when the Aristotelian Juan Ginés Sepúlveda\ndebated with the Dominican Bartolomé de Las Casas, an ardent\ndefender of the Amerindians and their rights. Sepúlveda argued\nthat the Amerindians, as barbarians, were slaves by nature, more or\nless on the level of beasts. Las Casas maintained that although there\nwere humans so simple-minded that they could be considered slaves by\nnature, such people existed in Spain as well as in the Americas (Hanke\n1959: 28–74). \nSoto, who also participated in the debate in Valladolid, said that the\nius gentium was a universally applicable form of positive\nhuman law, which was created by applying reason to natural principles.\nThis law governed trade, exchange of envoys, and even slavery, if it\nspared lives during war. It also included respect for property, even\nof non-Christians, to avoid squabbles over possessions. Nor was\nconversion a just reason for going to war and enslaving conquered\npeoples. \nSoto once considered going to the New World to resolve the\ncontroversies there. Unable to go himself, he advocated sending good\nmissionaries. In addition, his writings were employed by the Third\nMexican Council (1585) in the preparation of a confessors’\nmanual geared to a world of both Hispanic and Amerindian residents\n(Poole [ed.] 2018). Soto’s relectio on dominion\nconcluded that Spain’s title to the Indies was hard to justify.\nHe rejected the opinion of Sepúlveda on the justice of waging\nwar on infidels, also Pope Alexander VI’s division of overseas\ndomains between Spain and Portugal. Soto was trusted by all\nparticipants in the Junta of Valladolid to summarize the conflicting\nopinions of Las Casas and Sepúlveda, though he, or perhaps\nCano, another critic of conquest, may have been the one person who,\naccording to Sepúlveda, opposed him. The Dominicans of\nSalamanca continued to argue for just conduct by Spaniards in their\noverseas dominions; and also Jesuits like Molina, even in their\ndefense of slavery and slave trade, did not refer to the concept of\nslaves by nature. Soto, though accepting slavery, rejected the idea of\nnatural slavery: in his view, human beings who were incapable of\nleading their own lives clearly had to be guided by wiser men, but for\nreasons of their own well-being, not as living tools in the\nAristotelian sense. So, slavery for him was merely conventional. \nMolina, who wrote the first treatise on the Portuguese transatlantic\nslave trade, followed Soto on this point, accepting only conventional\nslavery. He justified slavery and mentioned the four just titles for\nenslavement: committing certain crimes; being captured in a just war;\nselling oneself because of urgent need; and the principle of\npartus sequitur ventrem, that is, the children of enslaved\nmothers are also slaves (Molina-DII II, disp. 33). Then he described\nthe history of the Portuguese slave trade and gave a critical\nevaluation of it (Molina-DII II, disp. 34–35). Interestingly,\nalthough he dealt intensively with the transatlantic slave trade,\nespecially from Africa, he never put forward a justification for\nenslavement based on race, though in his age were drawn to it. For\nexample, Noah’s curse on the children of Ham – or more\ncorrectly of Caanan (Genesis 9:20–7) – for mocking his\ndrunken nakedness, making them slaves of Sem and Japhet. Medieval\nconnections to Ham to blackness were used as a justification of\nAfricans from at least the fifteenth century to the nineteenth\n(Whitford 2009; Goldenberg 2017). \nAlongside the debates on just war, colonization, and the slave trade,\neconomics is perhaps the most striking example of how the theologians\nfrom the School of Salamanca used and transformed traditional medieval\ntheories in order to deal with new situations, creating innovative\nsolutions that had long-lasting influence. They have often been\nmentioned as the ancestors of the Austrian School of Economics, that\nin the late nineteenth and twentieth century emphasized the role of\nthe consumer’s estimation in the development of prices and the\nimportance of the market against any attempt at rationally planning\neconomic processes, while Molina has been described as a “solid\neconomic liberal” (Rothbard 2006: 113). This may be a\nrestrictive interpretation, because there is an undeniable relevance\nof the medieval heritage with its rigid condemnation of usury to be\nfound in the authors from the school of Salamanca. Their views on\neconomy are founded in natural law, implying therefore a normative\nview of economic processes instead of the purely strategic rationality\nof a homo oeconomicus. Nonetheless, the general consensus is\nthat there are liberal elements in late Scholastic economics\n(Schüssler 2014). Among the topics they dealt with were public\nfinance, the danger of exhausting public treasuries and of excessive\ntaxes (Chafuen 2003: 53–60), the just price for different goods\nand the problem of charging interest for lending money, which was\nconnected to the traditional condemnation of usury. The exchange of\nmoney was another major issue, because there were a large number of\nmonetary systems simultaneously in use within the Spanish and\nPortuguese kingdoms. According to Marjory Grice-Hutchinson, who\npublished an early and still important volume on their monetary\ntheory, the original contribution of the School of Salamanca in this\nfield consists  \nin its formulation of a psychological theory of value applied to both\ngoods and money, of the quantity theory, and of a theory of foreign\nexchange that closely resembles the modern purchasing-power parity\ntheory. (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 47–8.) \nA more or less common view of Spanish Scholastics on just price is\nthat the value of goods—and money—depends on estimation,\nnot primarily on the costs of production, nor on the needs of buyers\n(Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 48–51). It is not the communis\naestimatio of theologians that determines the natural price, but\nrather that of businessmen, as Molina says (Molina-DII II, 407); and\nit is not a fixed margin, but moves within a certain range, depending\nalso on the quantity of goods and money available. Monopolies are\ncriticized by Molina because they make such a determination of just\nprice impossible (Molina-DII II, 345). Some authors argued for a\npublic limitation on the price of foodstuffs. Molina favored support\nof the poor but hesitated to make only corn dealers pay for it,\nbecause a fixed price would prevent merchants from importing corn,\nthus damaging the common good (Molina-DII II, 365). \nThe first formulation of the quantity theory of money is often\nattributed to the jurist Martín de Azpilcueta, perhaps the best\nknown Salamancan writer on economic issues. In an appendix to his\nmanual for confessors, now published as On Exchange (1549\n[2014]), he discussed exchange, supply and demand, and money.\nAzpilcueta attempted to explain the rampant inflation of the sixteenth\ncentury as connected to the large-scale input of specie from the New\nWorld. Goods, he argued, were more costly when money was abundant.\nThis quantity theory of money was widely accepted throughout\nEurope. \nAzpilcueta, moreover, maintained that the exchange of money is not\nunnatural, contradicting Aristotle and many Scholastics. He treated\nmoney like other merchandise, positing that the morality of exchanges\nwhich were not dependent on money as their object was equitable. There\nwere different questions connected to exchange. One of these was\nwhether, in the case of petty exchange, it was licit to take more than\nthe legally fixed commission; this view was rejected, and the legal\ncommission was seen as binding in conscience (Alonso-Lasheras 2011:\n172–173). Another problem arose in relation to exchange bills\nbecause the value of money varied considerably between different\nplaces within the Spanish Empire, offering new possibilities of making\nand losing money. Spanish theologians such as Azpilcueta and Molina\ncountered the suspicion of usury associated with this kind of business\nby means of an early version of purchasing power theory according to\nwhich the exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when\ntheir purchasing power, i.e., what can be bought with a certain amount\nof money, remains the same (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 52–53;\nAlonso-Lasheras 2011: 179). Concerning the topic of lending money,\nauthors like Molina justified taking interest, first, by the\nlucrum cessans, the amount of money that the lender could\nhave made during the time it was on loan as a credit and, then, by the\npericulum sortis, the risk that he might lose his capital\n(Molina-DII II, 315). \nDespite the liberal elements which can be found in the works of\nauthors from the School of Salamanca, they nevertheless had a\ncompletely different understanding of the market from that of modern\nneoliberals.  \nThe market was first of all a physical place in which real people came\ntogether. These people possessed a moral conscience that was also part\nof the economic process. (Alonso-Lasheras 2011: 169) \nSpanish theologians were also involved in traditional discussions of\nlogic and metaphysics. Two representative examples will be discussed:\nSoto’s Summulae, a compendium on logic which is little\nknown today but which at the time was the compendium on logic\nin the Thomist tradition, ordered and paid for by the University of\nSalamanca in order to resist the influence of Nominalism; and\nSuárez’s famous and much studied treatise,\nDisputationes metaphysicae. \nSoto is regarded as responsible for the revival of Spanish-Thomistic\nlogic, as distinct from both Renaissance-oriented logic, which used\nonly ancient sources, and the extremely technical\n“sophistic” logic of Nominalism. His main sources were\nAristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Petrus Hispanus’ Summulae\nlogicales, from all of which, however, he deviated in many areas.\nIn his Summulae, especially starting with the second edition\nof 1547, which became one of the most influential textbooks of this\ngenre, he gives an introduction to traditional logic, including a\ntheory of terms, propositions and conclusions (Soto 1529 [1980]).\nWhereas Petrus Hispanus had been criticized for serious\ninconsistencies, Soto gives his own interpretation, in an effort to\nbuild up a coherent doctrine. In the presentation of the different\nkinds of terms, he did not follow the Aristotelian categories, but\ninstead presented the medieval distinctions between mental, written,\nand spoken terms, between categorematic and syncategorematic terms\n(that is, terms that have a meaning because they refer to things,\nconcepts or other terms and those which only make sense within\npropositions as connections, but cannot be a subject or predicate,\nsuch as ‘if’, ‘all’, etc.), between absolute\nand connotative terms, and so on. He continued by presenting different\nkinds of proposition, including a version of supposition\ntheory—the doctrine of the entities that the terms in a\nproposition, subject and predicate stand for (1529 [1980:\n31–36]). Here Soto also discussed Nominalist and realist\nobjections; but, in the end, he mostly defended the positions of\nPetrus Hispanus, largely omitting, however, complicated types of\nsupposition such as distributive, confused, merely confused, etc.,\nwhich had long puzzled medieval authors. The third book explains the\ndifferent kinds of relation between propositions, including an\nextended version of the square of oppositions (1529 [1980: 72]), as\nwell as truth conditions for modal propositions, conjunctions and\ndisjunctions. In his discussion of the different kinds of valid and\ninvalid conclusion, Soto not only referred to syllogisms (book 5) and\nthe so-called insolubilia, or reflections on paradoxes (book\n6), but also elements of the theory of consequentiae, a\nmedieval type of logical conclusion that may go back to the Stoic\nlogic of propositions (Read 1993; D’Ors 1983). \nWhile the Summulae provide something like a basic\nintroduction to the logical topics discussed at the time, Soto’s\nIn dialecticam Aristotelis commentarii (Salamanca 1543)\ncontains philosophical reflections on questions such as whether logic\nis a science and if so, what kind of logic, the logica docens\nin contrast to logica utens, which is a “mode of\nknowing”, and whether the subject of dialectics is an ens\nrationis (Di Liso 2000: 221–250). These reflections are\npresented within the context of a selective commentary on the\nAristotelian Organon, omitting De interpretatione and the\nAnalytica Priora, which were treated in the Summulae\n(ibid.). He also wrote Super octo libros Physicorum\ncommentarii and Super octo libros Physicorum quaestiones\nas part of the Artes liberales course. \nSuárez’s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597) was\npublished in eighteen editions over a few decades in printing centers\nthroughout Europe—not only in Catholic, but also in Protestant\nregions—and had an enormous influence on philosophy teaching in\nEuropean universities. It is still considered to be the most complete\nand comprehensive presentation of prima philosophia; and it\nwas the most important link between Scholastic metaphysics and\nseventeenth-century school philosophy, influencing Descartes, Leibniz,\nand Wolff. Although modern scholars debate the roots of the extremely\ncomplicated system of metaphysics which Suárez presents in the\ntreatise, they seem to agree that he created a kind of synthesis of\nThomist and Scotist theories. Only a very general survey of the topics\ndiscussed in Suárez’s 54 metaphysical disputations can be\nprovided here, along with a brief mention of some of the most\nimportant approaches to their interpretation. \nSuárez’s Disputationes do not follow the\nstructure of Aristotle’s Metaphysics. Instead, he\nstarts with an extensive introduction to the Aristotelian treatise,\naccording to a slightly different order than in modern editions, and\nindicates the precise places where the topics discussed there can be\nfound in his disputations. His first disputation reflects on the\nnature metaphysics as prima philosophia. It is followed by\ndisputations on the concept of being (ens), its passions,\ndifferent understandings of unity, on the true and the false, and the\ngood and the bad. The pivotal role that these\n“transcendentals” of medieval metaphysics play in\nSuárez’s metaphysics was the basis for the interpretation\nof his theoretical philosophy as transcendental (Honnefelder 1990).\nNext come sixteen disputations dedicated to the four Aristotelian\ncauses (material, formal, efficient, and final), followed by the\nvarious divisions of being (infinite and finite, uncreated and\ncreated—including some kind of rational theology which discusses\nquestions such as whether God can be recognized with natural reason\n(Disp. XXIX), whether there are physical proofs for God’s\nexistence (Disp. XXX) etc.—and the division of created being\ninto substance and accidents). Then there are about twenty\ndisputations dealing with the Aristotelian categories, concluding with\none on the special theoretical problems associated with the concept of\nens rationis, which does not belong to any of the previously\ndiscussed categories. \nInterpretations of the Disputationes metaphysicae over the\nlast decades have all attempted to fit Suárez into a kind of\ntheoretical history (Darge 2004: 7–26). Gilson (1949) identified\nan essentialism (according to the Thomist distinction between\nens and essentia) that neglects the act of being in\nfavor of a purely abstract conceptualization and that can be traced in\na line of thinkers from Avicenna through Duns Scotus and Suárez\nto Wolff and Kant. Honnefelder (1990) sees Suárez as dependent\non the same earlier philosophers, but he does not present it as a\nhistory of decadence from a Thomist perspective, as Gilson did, but\nrather as a success story for the transcendental Scotist approach.\nScotus uses a univocal instead of an analogous concept of being for\ncreated and uncreated substance (i.e., God) and individuates the realm\nof what may be meant by “being” based on the most general\nunderstanding of being as “id cui non repugnat\nesse”, i.e., the existence of which does not imply logical\ncontradictions. Furthermore, he gives a modal explication of the\ndifferent grades of finite and infinite being including the existence\nof finite and infinite substance. Courtine (1990) and Boulnois (1999)\nshare this “Scotist perspective”, but they see it more as\na move from the science of what is to the science of what can be\nthought, that is, an onto-logic. Precisely in the years when the term\n“ontology” was coined by Rudolf Goclenius (Lamanna\n2013), it no\nlonger referred to the “furniture of the universe”, as\nPutnam (1985: 28) called it, but instead to ways of thinking and\nspeaking about the things in the world—a process that ends with\nthe determination of what is through our speaking about it. Darge,\nfinally, tries to free Suárez from this purely logicistic\ninterpretation and from the Scotist perspective, in order to emphasize\nhis innovative merits against his classification as an intermediate\nfigure between Duns Scotus and Thomas, on the one hand, and Wolff and\nKant, on the other. There is no doubt, however, that\n“Renaissance and Baroque scholastic culture”, to which\nSuárez doubtlessly belongs, has finally become an object of\nserious research (Novák 2014: 2). This research is not only\nproviding a general systematization and historical integration of\nSuárez’s metaphysics, but also investigating particular\naspects of his extremely rich theory (Hill and Lagerlund 2012); Novák\n2014). \nIt is difficult to give a precise evaluation of the influence of the\nSchool of Salamanca in the many fields to which it contributed. There\nare various ideological motives, apart from the general tendency to\nconceal one’s sources, why later authors did not mention these\ntheologians. This was especially the case for philosophers,\ntheologians, and legal theorists from the Protestant North with their\naversion to Catholic thinkers, and especially Jesuits. Quarrels arose,\nfor instance, as to whether the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius\n(1583–1645) was the father of modern natural law and\ninternational law or whether he only copied and slightly altered the\nworks of Suárez and other Spanish authors. Another pertinent\nissue is that Suárez was regarded as the\nrepresentative of “the schools”, to which the founders of\nmodern philosophy opposed their new philosophical systems, often\ndenying their heritage. Some works by Spanish Scholastics therefore\nfell into oblivion. In recent years, however, the ideological barriers\nhave vanished, and there is a growing interest in an open-minded\ndiscussion of the School’s achievements and impact. \nAs has been indicated, the School of Salamanca is credited with a role\nin the development of international law. The gradual detachment of the\nius gentium from natural law, particularly as it pertained to\nissues such as slavery and the slave trade, was another notable\naccomplishment, So, too, was its consistent defense of the full\nhumanity of the Amerindians. That argument could be applied to other\nnon-European peoples who had also never heard of Jesus; their regimes\nand property rights were closely tied to reason and natural law. \nThe School, in addition, made important contributions to areas such as\ntrade and finance. Azpilcueta’s approach to inflation and his\ndefense of the morality of exchange was a step toward a culture of\naccepted risk and profit. Vitoria’s argument that commerce fell\nwithin the ius gentium was not embraced by everyone in the\nSchool; but this argument had a direct influence on Grotius. Moreover,\nalthough a Protestant and an opponent of papal claims to temporal\npower, Grotius drew on Thomas Aquinas, Cajetan, and Vitoria to argue\nfor the freedom of the seas and to develop a framework for\ninternational law. Because of the School’s role in the\ndevelopment of economic theory, some economists, including those\nbelonging to the Austrian School of National Economy, refer to them as\ntheir ancestors. \nSuárez and Mariana formulated theories of resistance to\nunacceptable rulers, which Roman Catholic thinkers engaged in opposing\nProtestantism and Protestant rulers like James I (England) found\nattractive. In the heated atmosphere of the times, it is possible that\nthese theories may have inspired the Catholic fanatics who\nassassinated Henry III (Valois), Henry IV (Bourbon), and William the\nSilent (Nassau). Similar theories were also developed by Protestant\nwriters, including French Huguenots and Calvinists in the Low\nCountries. \nMembers of the School of Salamanca departed from Aristotle and Thomas\nAquinas as they saw fit. This is apparent in Soto’s logic and\nSuárez’s widely read metaphysics. Less noted until\nrecently is the influence of Soto on Galileo. Diverging from\nAristotle, Soto advanced theories that have been described (Duhem\n1913, 555-562) as forerunners of\nthe modern idea of mechanics. His theory of falling bodies was well\nknown to Jesuit scholars, who circulated it through their writings. As\na young student, Galileo was probably exposed to these ideas, which\ninfluenced his approach to the physical laws governing the universe\n(Wallace 1981 and 2004). Galileo’s theories about falling bodies\neclipsed Soto’s, while his astronomical observations helped to\ncreate a heliocentric and un-Aristotelian intellectual milieu, in\nwhich many ideas of the School of Salamanca were regarded as\nobsolete. \nStarting in the 1930s, with the work of James Brown Scott and others,\nthe School of Salamanca gained renewed attention for its contribution\nto ideas of international law, including respect for non-Christian\npeoples. Academic interest overcame old prejudices tied to\nEurope’s past confessional and ideological divisions. The\ninterest of economists in monetarism also placed Salamanca in the\nscholarly mainstream. The revived study of Scholasticism has drawn\nattention to Soto, Molina, and Suárez, while modern editions,\nincluding those in the series “Corpus Hispanorum de Pace”,\nhave made these thinkers more accessible to a new generation of\nscholars.","contact.mail":"tizbicki@libraries.rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"libraries.rutgers.edu"},{"date.published":"2019-03-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-salamanca/","author1":"Thomas Izbicki","author2":"Matthias Kaufmann","entry":"school-salamanca","body.text":"\n\n\nThe School of Salamanca is a name for an intellectual movement or a\ncertain group of theologians in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nSpain and Portugal. In a broad sense, it is more or less identical\nwith Spanish Scholasticism, which also includes authors from the\nSpanish Netherlands. In a narrower sense, the School of Salamanca\nrefers to two or three generations of pupils of Francisco de Vitoria,\nwho was, in effect, the founding father of the school in both the\nbroad and narrow sense. On the whole, it is more useful to choose the\nbroader understanding of the term, even though it means considering\nsome figures who were never at Salamanca; and this approach has been\nadopted here. Regarded as forefathers of the law of nations (ius\ngentium), they also were theoreticians willing to depart from the\nteachings of Aristotle, and some of them were early theorists of\nmonetarist economics. They based themselves on the works of Thomas\nAquinas but felt free to depart from them, especially in dealing with\ncontemporary issues like Spanish expansion in the Indies and the\nchallenge of Protestantism to Catholic Christianity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the theoretical aspects of the School of\nSalamanca, it is necessary to give a short introduction to the history\nof the University of Salamanca. The focus will then turn to two\nDominicans, Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto, and two Jesuits,\nLuis de Molina and Francisco Suárez, though there were, of\ncourse, many other extremely important participants in the various\nfields of discourse in which the School engaged. \nThe University of Salamanca is the oldest institution of higher\neducation on the Iberian Peninsula. A cathedral school, located in\nSalamanca by 1130, received a charter from King Alfonso IX of\nLeón in 1218 as a “general school” for his realm.\nThe regulations for this school were promulgated by King Alfonso X\n“el Sabio” in 1254. Pope Alexander IV, in 1255, confirmed\nthe foundation of the studium generale and conferred on it\nthe licentia ubique docendi, a universally valid license to\nteach. Thereafter, Salamanca was recognized as a university. Courses\nin theology and law were offered, with many graduates receiving\nemployment by the crown of Spain. Lectures on authoritative texts were\nthe most common means of teaching. Starting in the fifteenth century,\nprofessors also offered relectiones, treating in greater\ndepth a particular topic previously covered during lectures.\nDisputations were also held. Christopher Columbus made his case for a\nsea route to Asia to the university before his voyage in 1492. \nTwo notable learned men, Juan de Segovia and Alfonso Tostado de\nMadrigal, were affiliated with the University of Salamanca in the\nfifteenth century. A short account of their careers will highlight the\nrange of views that characterized Spanish theology at the university\nin those years. Juan, a professor of theology (1422–1435),\nparticipated in the Council of Basel (1431–1449), beginning in\n1432. He defended conciliar supremacy and supported the doctrine of\nMary’s immaculate conception. His writings include polemics on\nbehalf of the council against Pope Eugenius IV (1431–1447) and a\nHistory of the General Council of Basel. Juan was made a\ncardinal by the antipope Felix V (1439–1449); but he retired\nafter Felix yielded to Eugenius’ successor, Nicholas V\n(1447–1455). In retirement, Juan wrote on the need for dialogue\nwith Islam. Aware of his impending death (c. 1458), Juan bequeathed\nhis library to the university. \nAlfonso Fernández de Madrigal, “el Tostado”, taught\ntheology before becoming a bishop in 1454. He, too, supported the\nCouncil of Basel, and he displayed his knowledge in extensive writings\non Scripture and ecclesiastical history. His tract on the polity\ndefended popular regimes in a realm whose intellectuals usually\nembraced monarchy. Alfonso also wrote against clerical concubinage.\nCertain controversial opinions of his were denounced to both pope and\ncouncil. The Castilian Dominican Juan de Torquemada wrote, on behalf\nof the Council of Basel, a critique of Alfonso’s views, to which\nhe replied. Alfonso later defended his teachings in Rome before Pope\nEugenius. “El Tostado”, on his death, left behind a\nreputation for great learning. \nThe Dominican order had established itself in Salamanca by 1244, when\na provincial chapter was held in that city. The convent of San\nEsteban, chosen as the site of a studium generale of the\norder in 1299, offered courses in grammar, logic, and theology. During\nthe fourteenth century, the Dominican convent gained control of two of\nthe university’s four chairs of theology. In 1489,\nSalamanca’s Dominican studium received from the papacy\nthe right to award academic degrees. The building now associated with\nVitoria and his school was begun in 1524 but not finished until 1610,\nwhen the university was falling into decline. By that date, other\nIberian universities, especially Alcalá and Coimbra, had become\ncompetitors of Salamanca for intellectual leadership. In addition, the\nJesuits had become competitors of the Dominicans as leading\nphilosophers and theologians. In Vitoria’s century,\ndistinguished scholars at Salamanca included the jurist Martín\nde Azpilcueta, who is known for developing a monetarist theory, and\nthe Scripture professor Gregorio Gallo, who considered the possibility\nthat the Apostle Thomas had preached in the New World. \nFrancisco de Vitoria (1486–1546) is usually regard as a late\nScholastic, who employed Aristotelian thought in his philosophy and\ntheology. Although Spanish Scholastics like Vitoria were primarily\ntheologians, the topics they discussed went far beyond the limits of\ntheology and even of the traditional philosophical companions of\ntheology, such as metaphysics and logic. This is partly because\nDominican theologians had to comment on the Summa theologiae\nof Thomas Aquinas (Sancti Thomae Aquinatis Doctoris Angelici Opera\nOmnia, volumes 4-12), with all the different topics it\ncovered. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw a revival of\nThomism in Paris, Rome, and Salamanca. In Rome, Thomas de Vio\n(Cajetan) wrote the most influential commentary on the Summa\ntheologiae. In Paris, Peter Crockaert, a pupil of John Mair,\njoined the Dominican order and became a zealous Thomist. Francisco de\nVitoria, who studied in Paris, embraced this Thomist revival. When he\nbegan teaching in Salamanca in 1524, he supplemented Peter\nLombard’s Sentences with the Summa theologiae\nas the textbook for the study of theology. Although the University of\nSalamanca was not a new foundation, Vitoria and his disciples,\nespecially Domingo de Soto (1494–1560) and Melchior Cano\n(1509–1560), transformed it into a center for a revived\nScholasticism, applying Thomism to such practical problems as the\nevangelization of the indigenous populations of the New World and the\nlegality of slavery. In addition, the Dominicans of Castile influenced\nthe intellectual development of the fledgling Jesuit order, which\nproduced such luminaries as Luis de Molina (1535–1600) and\nFrancisco Suárez (1548–1617). \nSome works of these theologians can be seen as vast, overflowing\ncommentaries on a number of questions from the Summa\ntheologiae, especially on topics such as law and justice. Since\nthey were confronted by a rapidly changing universe—the New\nWorld, populated by inhabitants who belonged to none of the\ntraditionally known religions, and a globalizing economy (including\nthe slave trade)—they had to deal with new opportunities and new\nproblems, while still considering long-standing questions such as the\nlegitimacy of charging interest. Because they were understood, or\nunderstood themselves, as confessors or as advisors of\nconfessors—Domingo de Soto was Emperor Charles V’s\nconfessor, Luis de Molina declared that he wrote for the confessors of\nthose who hold power—they had to cope with political, economic,\nand legal reality, often in a quite detailed manner. \nThe authors of the School of Salamanca used traditional tools to deal\nwith the new situations they faced. Besides the overarching influence\nof Thomas Aquinas—who became a Doctor of the Church in 1567 and\nwhose works Ignatius of Loyola had obliged the members of his newly\nfounded Jesuit order to study diligently—they engaged with other\nmedieval traditions, including the glosses to the Decretum\nGratiani, Franciscan authors (especially John Duns Scotus and\nWilliam Ockham), Jean Gerson and even Marsilius of Padua, a banned\nauthor who was not even allowed to be cited, but nevertheless had a\nconsiderable impact on the conciliarist debate. Scholastic authors\nmade a creative, instead of philologically correct, use of their\nauthorities, interpreting and explaining them in their own sense.\nMolina and Suárez even overtly criticized Thomas Aquinas and\nhis understanding of law. \nVitoria’s thought inevitably depended—but not\nslavishly—on Thomas Aquinas, not only in his commentary on the\nSumma theologiae, but also in his relectiones and\nother writings on law and society. His admiration for “Divus\nThomas” had already begun when he studied and later taught\ntheology at Paris and Valladolid. At Paris, he had assisted in the\npreparation of Crockaert’s edition of the Summa\ntheologiae, published in 1515. His lectures commenting on the\nPrima and the Prima secundae of the Summa\nare lost, but must have been quite successful. His most famous works\nwere published after he was elected to the first chair of theology at\nthe University of Salamanca in 1526, the most important professorship\nin the Spanish kingdom; and, contrary to the statutes of the\nuniversity, he took the Summa theologiae as the basis for his\nteachings (Vitoria, Vorlesungen 1995: 36). His reflections on\npolitical topics, such as the political status of the Church and the\nConquista in Mexico and South America, were followed\nattentively in the highest circles, even if not always approved, as\nEmperor Charles V’s harsh reaction to Vitoria’s lecture\nDe Indis showed. \nVitoria’s health became precarious in the 1540s, and the\ndominant role at Salamanca passed to his disciples. The most important\nof these was Domingo de Soto, who was born in Segovia 1494 of humble\norigins, studied in Alcalá and Paris, entered the Dominican\norder before he was thirty and was appointed to the second chair of\ntheology, the Catedra de visperas, at the University of\nSalamanca in 1532. Later he became the prior of the Convent of San\nEsteban in Salamanca and was from 1548–1550 confessor to Charles\nV. After this, he returned to the university, where he held the first\nchair of theology. He died at San Esteban in 1560. Together with\nMelchior Cano, another important disciple of Vitoria, who later became\nbishop of the Canary Islands, he participated in the Council of Trent\n(1545–1563) by order of Spain’s privy council. Soto,\nalthough without a vote in the council, urged bishops to attend to the\nwork of preaching; and he defended Scholastic theology against\nproposals to suppress it. Before returning to Spain, Soto helped with\nthe preparations for Charles V’s Augsburg Interim (1548), which\nmade concessions to the Protestants. One result of Soto’s\npresence at Trent was his tract De natura et gratia, which\nfocused on the errors of Martin Luther, whose writings he called\n“diabolic” (Soto-DII VII, qu. 5 ad. 4; Grimm 2017: 64). In\naddition, he wrote an Apologia against a fellow Dominican,\nAmbrosius Catharinus Politus, concerning the certitude of grace. \nMelchior Cano was less involved in controversy at Trent, concentrating\ninstead on preaching and sacramental theology; however, another\nDominican present at the council, Bartolomé Carranza\n(1503–1576), the future archbishop of Toledo, participated in\nthe discussion of justification, arguing for “twofold\njustification”. Carranza was reported to be reading\nLuther’s works, a sign of future troubles in which his\nCommentary on the Christian Catechism was criticized by both\nCano and Soto. Eventually, Carranza was condemned by the Inquisition\nfor his views on nature and grace and underwent a long imprisonment,\ndespite Soto’s efforts to defend him with a more balanced\nopinion, which Carranza cited in his own defense (Tellechea 1962). \nVitoria and his disciples engaged in arguments over Spain’s\nrights in the New World. The debate began when the Dominicans in the\nAntilles criticized the conquerors’ treatment of indigenous\npeoples. In a sermon given by the Dominican friar Antonio de\nMontesinos on December 21, the fourth Sunday of Advent 1511, in\nHispaniola (today’s Haiti and Dominican Republic), the Spaniards\nwho attended were told that they lived and died in mortal sin because\nof the cruelties they had inflicted upon the Amerindians. One of his\nlisteners was Bartolomé de Las Casas (1474–1566), who\njoined the Dominican order and was converted by Montesinos into the\nmost severe critic of the Conquista (Las Casas 1992). \nA Junta of Burgos (1513) declared that Charles V had a sound title to\nthe Indies. One argument in that context, grounded in\nAristotle’s thought, was that the Amerindians were slaves by\nnature. This view did not remain uncontested; and, eventually, on June\n2, 1537, Pope Paul III, influenced by Las Casas, issued the bull\nSublimis Deus, declaring the indigenous peoples to be fully\nhuman with souls and just title to their possessions. The ongoing\ndebate climaxed in the disputation between Las Casas, defending the\nliberty of the indigenous populations, and the humanist Aristotelian\nJuan Ginés de Sepúlveda (1494–1573), who defended\nthe Spanish title to the Indies because of the Amerindian’s sins\nand because they were slaves by nature. This took place in the Junta\nof Valladolid (1550/51), which Charles V had assembled with a number\nof other leading scholars on both sides. \nAfter the deaths of Domingo de Soto and Melchior Cano, the reputation\nof Salamanca’s Dominicans declined. Domingo Bañez\n(1528–1604), a pupil of Cano, is the best known of their\nsuccessors. When his commentary on Thomas’ Summa\nappeared (1584), admitting of no dissent from its doctrines, it\nprovoked a controversy over the theology of grace and free will.\nBañez—also the confessor of St. Theresa of\nAvila—was opposed by the Jesuit Luis de Molina, who accused him\nof being overly deterministic. \nMolina was born in Cuenca (Spain) in 1535, entered the Jesuit order at\nthe age of 18, studied in Salamanca and Coimbra, taught theology in\nÉvora (Portugal) from 1568 to 1583 and later in Lisbon. In 1591\nhe was sent to the Jesuit college of his home town of Cuenca and was\nelected in 1600 to the chair of moral theology at the Jesuit College\nin Madrid, where he died in the same year. In 1588 Molina published a\nvolume entitled Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina\npraescientia, providentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione\nconcordia (Molina 1588 [1953]), usually abbreviated as\nConcordia, in which he tried to reconcile free will with\ngrace, God’s pre-knowledge, providence, etc. It produced a\ndevastating effect (see below and MacGregor 2015), a passionate debate\nbetween Dominicans and Jesuits, raising accusations of both Pelagian\nand Calvinist heresy, both of which were extremely dangerous for\nCatholic theologians. This controversy continued until a congregation\nDe auxiliis meeting in Rome under Paul V decreed (1607) that\nDominicans and Jesuits could hold their own opinions on efficacious\ngrace. The conflict did not end, however, and in 1611 the Roman\nInquisition forbade the publication of any further books on the\ntopic—the most drastic case of ecclesiastical censorship in the\nseventeenth century (Knebel 2000: 170). \nIn general, the Jesuits felt less bound than Dominicans to the\nopinions of Thomas Aquinas, which meant that Molina and Suárez\nwere allowed a greater degree of originality in their teachings. For\nthis reason, some modern scholars emphasize the differences between\nthe Dominican School of Salamanca and the Jesuit School of Coimbra,\nwhich came after it, though both belong to the broad tradition of\nSpanish Scholasticism. \nSuárez was a student at Salamanca in 1561, when he joined the\nSociety of Jesus. He was an educator, settling eventually in Coimbra,\nwhere he produced a tract De legibus ac Deo legislatore\n(1612). As a polemicist, he intervened in the quarrel over the oath of\nallegiance imposed by James I on English Catholics after the Gunpowder\nPlot (1605). Suárez and his Jesuit contemporary Robert\nBellarmine were the most important Catholic writers on political and\necclesiological issues following the Council of Trent. \nWith the death of Suárez, the School of Salamanca and its\noffshoots lost their creative edge. Instead, there was an urge to\nrecapitulation. The Discalced Carmelites produced an enormous\ncompilation of past thought, the Cursus Theologiae Moralis;\nand the publication of its third volume in 1670 is often treated as\nmarking the end of the School of Salamanca. \nA common theological topic for the authors of the School of Salamanca\nwas the need to resist what they considered to be Lutheran heresies\n(Skinner 1978: 135–173). They suspected, for instance, that\nconnecting legal authority to the virtue of princes could\n“inveigle away the hearts of simple men from due obedience to\ntheir princes and their priests”, as Vitoria put it (De\npotestate ecclesiastica I qu. 1, art. 2; transl. Vitoria 1991b:\n55); and they regarded as heretical the view that grace is not\nincreased directly by the sacraments ex opere operato but\nrequires the faith of the recipient (De potestate\necclesiastica I qu. 2, art. 2). Other points at issue were\nwhether all Christians could be seen as priests (ibid., II qu. 2, art.\n1), the role of papacy, the veneration of the Virgin Mary, and the\ncentral problem of free will, which was denied by Luther. As we shall\nsee, the problem of free will and grace also gave rise to an extremely\nbitter and long-lasting controversy inside Catholicism after the\nCouncil of Trent between Dominicans and Jesuits. \nVitoria’s awareness of the challenge of Luther to Catholicism\naffected his teaching and that of his successors. In his\nRelectiones de potestate ecclesiastica (1532–1533) and\nRelectio de potestate papae et concilii (1534), he was\ncritical of the Roman curia, especially on account of its free-handed\ndistribution of dispensations; but he was careful not to open the way\nfor any assault on the papacy and Catholic orthodoxy. \nVitoria’s basic ecclesiology was traditional, identifying the\necclesia as the “congregation of the faithful”.\nWhen heretics left this community, they did so like deserters from an\narmy. The Church received its power from Christ, which was distinct\nfrom that of lay regimes, in order to promote good and resist evil.\nThe priesthood of the New Law superseded that of the Old Law. The\nChurch’s power had two aspects: orders and jurisdiction. Orders\ninvolved the sacraments, especially the eucharist and penance.\nJurisdiction included spiritual censures inflicted on erring\nbelievers. By divine command, the Church was a “perfect”\ncommunity, that is, one which was able to defend itself and punish\niniquity. \nChrist established the papacy to look after the Church’s\nwelfare. Priests administered the sacraments under the supervision of\nthe pope and the bishops. Orders came via the apostles but\njurisdiction via Peter, Christ’s vicar. It was the\nresponsibility of his successors, the popes, to build up the Church.\nBishops legislated for their diocese or province, but the pope acted\nfor the whole Church. Vitoria expressed great respect for general\ncouncils as gatherings of bishops, but he maintained that a council\ndid not have power superior to that of the pope. Moreover, after\nconsidering the councils of the fifteenth century, which had resolved\nthe Great Western Schism (1378–1417), he denied conciliarism in\nits dogmatic form. The most ancient councils had not claimed that\nsupreme power was invested in the Church. \nSpiritual power was superior to temporal, but that did not make the\npope lord of the world. Papal power could have an impact on Christian\nregimes, making and unmaking rulers, but only for spiritual ends. The\npontiff could authorize just wars against the Saracens and other\nenemies of the faith. The ecclesiastical commonwealth had its powers\nfrom grace, but grace did not cancel nature. On the contrary:\naccording to Thomas Aquinas “grace presupposes nature and\nperfects it” (“Gratia praesupponit naturam et perficit\neam”: Summa theologiae I qu. I art. 8 ad 2). \nThe topic of grace and free will was the main ingredient of the\ncontroversy over Molinism. It began with the work of Molina mentioned\nabove, Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia,\nprovidentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia (Molina\n1588 [1953]), in which he explains how God can preserve his\nomnipotence, providence, and pre-knowledge, while conceding free will\nto humans, by means of his scientia media, or “middle\nknowledge”, which gives him the ability to know what human\nbeings will decide—but no control over their decisions.\nScientia media is placed between scientia naturalis,\nby which God knows everything that can be, and scientia\nlibera, by which he knows what will be. Molina places God’s\ncounterfactual knowledge before the creation—contrary to Luther\nand Calvin. God’s omnipotence consists in the possibility that\nhe could have created beings without the capacity to accept or reject\nthe offer of grace by their will (Concordia pars IV, disp.\n52). Furthermore, humans are able by their free will, without the\nspecial help of God (“sine auxilio speciali Dei”:\nConcordia pars I, disp. 5; Molina 1588 [1953: 29]), but only\nwith his concursus generale, to act morally in a temporal\nsense; however, they need grace within temporal life and God’s\nspecial help for the effort to receive eternal grace, i.e., the\nvisio beatifica, the vision of God of the blessed after their\ndeath. In the ensuing controversy, known as De auxiliis,\nfierce criticisms came from the Dominican Domingo Bañez, who\nhad the first chair of theology at Salamanca, and his pupils; they\nheld a special Thomist theory of grace, which referred to the\npraedeterminatio physica, mankind’s inability to resist\nGod’s grace. \nIt is easy to forget that Suárez was concerned not only with\nmetaphysics and law; but he has also been described as the founder of\nMariology on account of his treatment of the Immaculate Conception and\nMary’s bodily assumption. Suárez took a balanced view of\nthe issues of divine foreknowledge, free will, and predestination in\nthe De auxiliis controversy; and, building on Molina, he\ndeveloped the doctrine of Congruism, which argued that God had\narranged matters to allow free will to assent to grace. He also\ndiscussed how God rewards the good and punishes sinners. \nSuárez was a confirmed papalist, who regarded the Holy See as\nnecessary to the Church’s unity. Canon law existed as a distinct\naspect of human law, supporting humanity’s higher ends and\nunifying all peoples. The pope was divinely guided in pronouncements\non doctrine, and he had a universal responsibility to spread the\ngospel. Suárez, however, refused to accept evangelization as an\nexcuse for war. Not even unnatural acts justified the use of violence.\nConsequently, Suárez, like Vitoria and Soto, upheld the\nlegitimacy of non-Christian regimes operating within the bounds of\nnatural law. \nOne of the generally acknowledged merits of the School of Salamanca\nwas the revival of natural law or at least its Thomist version. This\nwas more or less closely connected to commentaries on the second part\nof Thomas Aquinas’ Summa theologiae. Vitoria’s\nlectures on the quaestiones 90–105 of the Prima\nsecundae, entitled De lege, dealing with the different\nkinds of law, and his voluminous commentary on the Secunda\nsecundae are now available in critical editions by Vicente\nBeltrán de Heredia. Molina described his monumental De\niustitia et iure, which in current forms of printing would take\nup around 6,000 pages, as a commentary on quaestiones\n57–79 in the Secunda secundae of the Summa\ntheologiae, but he admitted that he was not following Thomas\nprecisely and that his theory covered a wider range compared to what\nhad been discussed by “Divus Thomas”. Whether the ten\nvolumes of Suárez’s De legibus ac Deo\nlegislatore are primarily to be seen as a commentary on\nquaestiones 90–108 of the Prima secundae is\nstill debated by modern scholars. Soto, who is mentioned by\nSuárez as one of his main sources besides Thomas Aquinas,\ncommented on questions from both the Prima secundae and\nSecunda secundae in the ten books of his extremely\ninfluential treatise De iustitia et iure. The common\nbackground for all the authors of the School of Salamanca, as well as\ntheir Jesuit successors, who dealt with law, natural law, and justice\nwas, therefore, Thomas Aquinas’s division of the different kinds\nof law in the Prima secundae and his reflections on the\ndifferent meanings of justice, law, and right from the Secunda\nsecundae, whether they followed him or not. \nThe classification of laws in the Summa (Ia IIae, qu.\n91–4) begins with God’s regulation of the universe via the\neternal law, manifest to humans through revealed divine law and\nthrough natural law, which was accessible by reason. Humans, even\nthose lacking revelation, could derive from natural law the principles\nfor enacting human law. Human law, inevitably, had to be adapted to\ntime, place and climate and was, therefore, limited. Nor was reason\nable to craft laws covering all contingencies. They had to be useful\nto the commonwealth and also mutable if circumstances changed.\nDispensations were required where a law did not apply in a particular\ncase. Disobeying laws was a vice, while obeying them was a virtue.\nDivine law, embodied in the Old Law or the New Law, which regulated\ncontingent elements of religious cult, but also the punishment of\nthose who had escaped human justice, was in accordance with natural\nlaw and eternal law: it just had its specific functions. Human laws\nwere invalid if they contradicted either divine or natural law. In the\nquaestiones 57–79 of the Secunda secundae,\nThomas addressed questions such as “Whether right is the object\nof justice”, and “What is justice?”; he also\ndiscussed judgment, kinds of justice, restitution, injustice, kinds of\ninjustice, and so on.  \nVitoria followed this schema in his lectures on the Summa\ntheologiae, especially in his 1533–1534 lectures and in his\ncommentary. He treated law as made by “reason and\nenlightenment”, not just the will. Natural law, derived from\neternal law by reason, was binding on all humanity; its principles\napplied to mutable situations and different peoples. God was the\nindirectly cause of human laws, which were binding on the conscience\nof individuals. There was a human urge to obey natural law, for\nexample, by honoring one’s parents, preferably out of love.\nFailure to heed these precepts was a moral fault.  \nThe gospel was valid when promulgated by Christ, but barbarians\nignorant of the gospel might violate its commands in a pardonable way.\nThe Church had general laws which were applicable anywhere, and\nfailure to obey them was sinful. Human legislators could enact laws\nfavoring religion, but they must not confuse their role with that of\nthe clergy under divine law.  \nHuman laws were intended to serve the common good, not the interests\nof the legislator, who was “the servant of the\ncommonwealth”. Any “perfect” community, sacred or\nsecular, had the power to make and enforce laws. Human laws were\nbinding once publicly promulgated; but the Church had its laws from\nGod. The Church had one ruler on earth, the pope, the vicar of Christ,\njust as the universe was ruled by God; but, like other rulers, the\nRoman pontiff delegated power for its effective exercise. \nDespite the preeminent place that Thomas Aquinas occupied for these\nauthors, there are significant deviations from the Thomist concept of\nnatural law that are shared by some of them, who at times also\ndirectly criticized the “Doctor Angelicus”. Suárez,\nfor instance, says that law has to be seen as something that rules the\nbehavior of beings capable of free decisions (De legibus I\niii 2); therefore, Thomas’ concept of an eternal law that rules\nthe whole universe can be understood as a law only in a metaphorical\nsense. There are still ongoing debates as to whether eternal law can\nbe seen as the theological basis of all other kinds of law\n(Schweighöfer 2018: 234–256). Natural law, for Thomas, on\nthe one hand, is known to humans because of their participation as\nrational beings in eternal law, but, on the other, it is at least\npartially shared with animals (Summa theologiae Ia IIae qu.\n95 art. 4 ad 1; IIa IIae qu. 57 art. 3 co) in parallel to Roman Law\n(Digest 1,1,1,4). Its role for Thomas was labeled as something like a\n“style”, i.e., a universal principle (Westerman 1998: 81)\ngoverning animate nature. For Suárez it becomes a device to\nrule the behavior of humans as rational beings who are responsible for\ntheir activities. It not only contains the most general principles of\nlaw, leaving the more detailed regulations to human law, but also\neverything that follows logically from these principles; otherwise not\neven the ten commandments would belong to natural law. According to\nSuárez, natural law is the voice of right reason which effects\nhuman behavior via man’s conscience, and  \na man who is led by this law is said to be his own law, because he has\nthe law written within himself. (“dicitur homo, qui illo\nducitur, sibi lex, quia habet in se scriptam legem”: De\nlegibus II v 9–10)  \nThis conceptual shift was initiated at least implicitly by Vitoria in\nhis commentary on quaestio 57. Thomas gives as an example of\nwhat is just by nature in an absolute sense the natural inclination of\nthe male to the female for the sake of procreation and the efforts of\nparents to nurture their children. Vitoria replaces these examples by\nthe obligation to return deposits and the Golden Rule. This\nmoralization of natural law is not found in all the authors under\nconsideration. Molina, for example, argues that someone who uses the\nextreme poverty of another to make that person his slave, instead of\nproviding help without imposing conditions, commits a sin against\ncharity; but the contract is valid according to natural law\n(Molina-DII II, disp. 34).  \nThe Salamancan theologians and their successors not only discussed and\nmodified Thomist natural law but also referred to other sources with\nslightly different categorizations, such as the distinction between\nius humanum and ius naturale vel divinum made by\nIsidore of Seville (Liber etymologiarum, lib. 5 c.\n2–18, Isidori Hispalensis episcopi etymologiarum libro\nXX, 1833), cited in\nDecretum Gratiani (Friedberg [ed.], Corpus Iuris\nCanonici, vol. 1, 1–5) and discussed by Soto (Soto-DII I,\nqu. V, art. iii and iv). There were many further differences among\nthem on natural law, as on law in general. For instance, with regard\nto whether law was an act of will or an act of intellect, some, like\nSoto, favored the intellect despite his early education in\nNominalist-dominated Paris, where voluntarism, an emphasis on the will\nover the intellect, prevailed; others, like Suárez, gave some\nrelevance to the will. Nevertheless, they were in agreement that the\nprinciples of natural law were inscribed in the heart of humans, so\nthat “no human being can plead ignorance as an excuse”, as\nSoto put it (Soto-DII I, qu. I art. 4; translated in Hamilton 1963:\n15). Suárez’s concept of law has been described as\nvoluntarist, but reason still played a significant role in his\nthought. Reason diagnosed situations, identifying possible remedies;\nbut the will implemented these measures. These deliberations happened\nwithin the context of immutable natural law, which Suárez\nbelieved was known through specific precepts. In addition, he held\nthat individual virtue lay in following right reason. Reason’s\ndictates were unique to human beings, not impulses shared with\nanimals. The laws common to many peoples, though not universal, made\nup the ius gentium. What may seem at first glance an\nacknowledgment of the moral competence of all human beings was also\nused to justify punishment, including war and enslavement, against\npeoples from other continents. \nIt is the ius gentium, not natural law, that regulates the\ndistribution of property and the enslavement of human beings. The\nimmutable natural law, however, gives permission for these activities,\nbecause, after the Fall, the circumstances of its application changed\ndramatically, making an enforced regulation of possession necessary\n(see, e.g., Suárez, De legibus L I xvi 7). Although\nproperty—or dominium as it was called—is not part\nof human nature, according to the majority of Salamancan thinkers and\ntheir followers, there are many reflections by different authors\narguing for the advantages of private property. Soto and Molina make\ndirect use of Aristotelian and Thomist arguments, saying that common\nownership would prevent men from working and from taking care of their\nthings to the disadvantage of the common good (Soto-DII IV, 3;\nMolina-DII II, 19; see Chafuen 2003: 3–38). There are\ndifferences concerning the way in which dominium in this\nsense is bound by regulations from positive and natural law. Most\nauthors, such as Vitoria, in his commentary on quaestio 66 in\nthe Secunda secundae of the Summa theologiae,\naccepted the Thomist view that those in extreme need are entitled to\ntake what is necessary for their survival. Martin de Azpilcueta\n(1491–1586), known as “Doctor Navarrus” or\n“Navarro”, however, held that there is no obligation to\ndonate to those who are in extreme need and that anyone who receives\nsuch a donation must see it as a loan, not as something of his own\n(Chafuen 2003: 44). \nSome of these theologians adopted an understanding of the word\nius in the sense of right, even subjective right. This is not\na Salamancan invention but seems to have been initiated in the glosses\nto the Decretum Gratiani and enforced by authors like Ockham\nand Gerson (Tierney 1997). But it plays an important role in arguments\non dominium—a term that oscillates between domination\nand property—and in reflections on the ius gentium. The\nfirst lecture of Vitoria’s De Indis deals with the\nquestion of whether the Indians may be called veri domini,\nthat is, real masters or real possessors, of their goods, and the\nthird lecture claims that they violated the rights of the Spaniards.\nMolina takes this subjective meaning of ius as the\nparadigmatic understanding of the term throughout his voluminous\ntreatise De iustitia et iure. He defines ius as  \na faculty to do or have something or to maintain it or to behave in\nany way such that if it is hindered without legitimate reason an\ninjury is done to the person who has it. This way, that right, in this\nmeaning, becomes something like a measure of injury: because as much\nas it is opposed and damaged without legitimate reason, injury is done\nto the one who has it. (Molina-DII II, 1)  \nThough it may be exaggerated to call the School of Salamanca the\ncradle of human rights, individual rights are pivotal for a number of\ntheir arguments. Molina states that a slave may have a ius qua\nhomo, even in the special case of a right to things he has won\nfrom his master in gambling and suchlike. Furthermore, he declares\nthat an injustice toward someone is a violation of that person’s\nrights, and he gives a number of examples where injustice is done\ntoward a slave and must be corrected or punished. We may, therefore.\nconclude that slaves also have rights in his system (Molina-DII II,\n38). \nThe central topics in the political theory of authors from the School\nof Salamanca are the aim of political community, the legitimacy of its\npower and the relationship between the commonwealth and its ruler. \nIn his lecture On Civil Power (De potestate civili),\nVitoria holds that every power, public or private, comes from God and\ncannot be abolished by human beings, not even if they are in full\nconsensus. Vitoria’s ideas about society depended partly on his\nAristotelian belief that human beings are social by nature, needing\nothers to survive and achieve a good life. Thus, a natural good,\nsurvival, not moral goodness, was its original purpose. Nature,\nfollowing God’s purpose, had implanted in early peoples the urge\nto establish households, cities, and regimes. Society eventually came\nto promote virtues, especially justice and amity, which supported the\ncommon good. He followed in a certain sense an Aristotelian line,\nusing the theory of the four causes for his analysis, first of public,\nthen of private power, and starting with the final cause, which was\nregarded in the Aristotelian and Thomist tradition as the necessary\ncause. According to Vitoria, “the origin of human cities and\ncommonwealths was not a human invention … but a device\nimplanted by nature in man for his own survival” and for the\nsake of this it also needs an “ordering force” (ibid., qu.\n1, art. 2, p. 9). The efficient cause of public power is God, and its\nmaterial cause is the commonwealth itself. Royal power is not from the\ncommonwealth, even if the king is elected, but from God himself\n(ibid., qu. 1 art. 5). Non-Christians have legitimate rulers, and a\nlegitimately constituted power cannot be abolished by the consent of\nthe people (ibid., qu.1. art 6–7). \nAll peoples created regimes: since a multitude could not govern itself\nwell, power was entrusted to a group or individual acting for the\ncommon good. The best regime, in Vitoria’s opinion, was rule by\none person, who was both above the community and within it.\nIndividuals might even sacrifice their lives in defense of the common\ngood. Society’s natural purpose, the preservation of temporal\nlife of its members, was not in contradiction to the Church’s\nend: the salvation of souls. In a Christian commonwealth, salvation\nwas the primary purpose, with human felicity as the secondary end. The\ncommonwealth transferred its power to the ruler, but his power\nultimately derived from God; and after its transfer of power to the\nruler, the commonwealth ceased to be able to legislate. Since the\nruler was within the commonwealth, he was bound by its laws. Vitoria\nstates that monarchy is the best form of government, but insists that\na whole commonwealth may be punished for the sins of its king, if he,\nfor example, wages an unjust war against another prince (ibid., qu. 1\nart. 8–9). This commonplace among the theorists of the ius\ngentium was important for some of the justifications of slavery\nand the slave trade, because captives in a just war traditionally\nbecame slaves and because the punishment of a whole commonwealth\ndecided the fate of all its members, regardless of their individual\nguilt or innocence. \nOnce different temporal regimes were created, each ruler was situated\nwithin a commonwealth. The ruler of France could not legislate for\nSpain. A ruler with multiple realms, like Emperor Charles V, had to\npromulgate laws in each region. Within a realm, custom was supposed to\nreinforce law or to be enforced itself. A ruler was best advised to\nsupport good customs. Vitoria faced the possibility that some laws\nmight be obeyed only by a few citizens, in which case they could be\nrevoked by the ruler. Revoking laws arbitrarily, however, might be\nsinful. Even a tyrant’s laws had to be obeyed if they served the\ncommon good. Vitoria claimed that legislators are bound by civil laws\n(ibid., qu. 3 art. 4), but that the laws of tyrant are valid (ibid.,\nqu. 3 art. 6), a view which conflicts with positions later held by\nJesuits. The community, according to Vitoria, retained the right to\ndefend itself against a tyrant threatening its survival, but it could\nnot abolish a licit regime. The regime did not have to be Christian,\nbut a non-Christian regime could not be overthrown solely on the\ngrounds of injustice. \nSoto never denied that God is the ultimate origin of the Christian\ncommonwealth, but he distinguished between the natural and\nsupernatural order and held that, in the natural, temporal order,\npeace and tranquility have to be guaranteed by the commonwealth and\ncan be identified with the bonum commune (Grimm 2017:\n74–77; Soto-DII I, qu.1 art. 2). This internal peace, the\nbonum commune, is the aim of any legitimate law; on the other\nhand, it is stabilized by just laws, which are more easily waged by a\npeaceful society. In this way, the theologians of the School of\nSalamanca implicitly paved the way for a secular understanding of the\nstate as a human institution that preserves peace and prosperity\nwithin a society. There are differences between some of the authors\nconcerning the anthropological question of whether human organizations\nand the distribution of property were already to be found in statu\ninnocentiae or only later, after the Fall, when domination and\nproperty became necessary because of human weakness. \nMolina explained why and how domination was introduced after the Fall,\ncoining the term dominium iurisdictionis for temporal power,\nin contrast to dominium proprietatis (Molina-DII II, 20; II,\n22; II, 23; Brett 2011), in order to avoid the equivocal use of the\nterm dominium that had confused discussions since the debate\non Franciscan poverty in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Brett\n1997). The political authority of the commonwealth—res\npublica—is directly given by God, as it was difficult to\nimagine that there was a new contract in every generation.\nNevertheless, the power (potestas) of the government comes\nonly indirectly from God and directly from the republic (Molina-DII\nII, 26.4). Molina accepted the common Salamancan view that communities\nhad transferred power to rulers. \nAll dominion was founded on natural reason, shared even by\nnon-Christians. “Government is the channel through which the\nnatural power of the commonwealth is exercised” (Costello 1974:\n49). Therefore, if a government misuses its power by trying to\nexercise a dominium proprietatis over its citizen, that is,\ntreating them like slaves, there is a right to resist. This also holds\nfor a king, notwithstanding that, for Molina, monarchy was the best\nform of government (Molina-DII II, 23.10). While this resistance has\nto be supported by the common will of the citizens in the case of\nabuse of power by a legitimate ruler, every citizen has the right to\nkill an illegitimate usurper of power (Molina-DII III, 6.2). \nSuárez believed that individual peoples reached agreement on\nthe need for government. God then granted rulers power to direct\nhumanity toward its proper ends. Critics of his thought like Robert\nFilmer objected to bringing in God at this late stage, in order to\nexplain the formation of regimes, rather than emphasizing his role in\nthe creation of commonwealths since Adam (Filmer 1680: chap. II 2).\nSuárez thought that it was the responsibility of the ruler to\npromote harmony between subjects, to exercise power well, and to enact\nlaws to perfect the community. He also treated the relationship of law\nto conscience and that of ecclesiastical to lay powers. Like many\nrepresentatives of Spanish Scholasticism, Suárez favored\nmonarchy, within limits, as the best regime. Individuals had the right\nto self-defense, as did the society as a whole, and they might resist\na ruler who acted badly. Suárez even contemplated the\npossibility that tyrants could be killed for threatening the survival\nof the commonwealth. In his polemics against King James I of England,\nhe argued for the immunity of the Church from control by lay regimes.\nThe English oath, the so-called oath of allegiance that King James had\nrequired his subjects to take in 1606, the year after the Gunpowder\nPlot, he said, violated this immunity and undermined obedience to the\nRoman pontiff in spiritual matters. Suárez was willing to\nbelieve that the pope could exhort the people to rise up against a\ntyrant or to invoke the aid of outsiders against one. Except in such\ncases, however, Christians were to obey their lay rulers in conformity\nwith natural law. This right to resistance was widely taken for\ngranted by the Jesuits and considerably expanded by Juan de Mariana\n(1536–1624). Although recent scholarship has cast doubt on the\ntraditional labeling of Mariana as an early exponent of popular\nsovereignty (Braun 2007), the Catholic zealot who assassinated Henry\nIV of France in 1610 is known to have referred to his writings.  \nAmong the most influential elements in the works from the School of\nSalamanca are those connected to what was called the ius\ngentium until the late eighteenth century but is nowadays\nreferred to as international law. Firstly, they separated the ius\ngentium from natural law, with which it had more or less been\nidentified with since the formulation of Roman Law; secondly, they\ndeveloped a martial law on the basis of quaestio 40 in the\nSecunda secundae of Thomas Aquinas’s Summa\ntheologiae; and thirdly, they treated the alleged right to\nenslave non-European human beings. \nWhen James Brown Scott (1934: 3, 160) called Vitoria the father of\nmodern international law, it was mainly in reference to his lectures\non the problems associated with the Indies. Vitoria’s opinions\non this matter loomed large in this debate. He addressed the Indies in\nthree relectiones: De temperantia (1537), De\nIndis (1539), and De iure belli (1539). In the first of\nthese he discussed cannibalism, while in the others he considered\nwhether a just war could be waged against indigenous peoples and\nwhether Spain’s title to the Indies was valid. In addition,\nVitoria, lecturing on the Summa theologiae (1534), discussed\nevangelization. His account of the right to rule also extended to the\nrole of the clergy in evangelizing peoples who, before 1492, had never\nheard of Christ. \nAs mentioned above, in the first of his three lectures De\nIndis, delivered in the summer of 1539, he shows that the\nAmerindians were veri domini of their goods, even if they\nwere unbelievers, sinners, and irrational (Vitoria 1991b:\n239–250). He discussed the argument from Aristotle that\n“barbarians” were little better than animals, madmen or\nthose lacking sense, then he turned to an argument of apologists for\nthe Conquista, claiming that Amerindians were infidels,\nliving in a perpetual state of mortal sin, requiring Christian\nintervention. He dismissed the argument from sin, on the grounds that\nsin did not cancel natural dominium. Brute beasts lacked such\nrights, but even children and the mad, although they had guardians,\nnevertheless had property rights. Aristotle wrote about those who\nneeded direction from others, but this did not negate ownership.\nVitoria extended rightful ownership even to Saracens. He blamed the\npoor education of indigenous peoples, which he compared to that of\nmany European peasants, for their depraved condition. Slavery, he\nadded, was a legal or civil construct. No one was a slave by\nnature. \nThe second lecture lists seven “unjust titles” for the war\nagainst the Amerindians. Vitoria rejected the idea that either the\nemperor or the pope is master of the world. He denied that Emperor\nCharles V could take away the domains of others. He cited Juan de\nTorquemada’s Summa de ecclesia to prove that the\npope’s supremacy was spiritual, not temporal; and he maintained\nthat the pope could not force unbelievers to convert. According to\nVitoria, discovery was not a justification for conquest; and he\nrefuted the view that sins against nature like cannibalism and incest,\nwhich were exceptions to the natural immunity that canon law allowed\nto non-believers, justified conquest. There were sinners in every\nnation, but the pope was not entitled to wage war against Christians\nwho were guilty of sin. Furthermore, neither the alleged voluntary\nchoice of the Amerindians nor the idea of a gift from God could\njustify the conquest of their territory (Vitoria 1991b:\n252–276). \nThe third lecture, finally, lists eight “just titles” for\nthe war against Amerindians, among them the violation of the right of\nSpaniards to travel in the Indies and to conduct missions, the\nprotection of innocents, etc. (Vitoria 1991b: 278–291). Vitoria\nargued for free intercourse between all peoples: indigenous rulers\ncould not exclude Christians from their lands, and Christian travelers\nattacked by the local inhabitants had the right of self-defense.\nSpanish children born in the New World were able to choose, under\nnatural law and the ius gentium, to become citizens of the\ncountry where they resided. Vitoria also argued for the right to\nevangelize. Christians could intervene to protect converts, allies,\nand friends. He warned, however, that waging war on indigenous peoples\nmight obstruct conversion. Vitoria weakened his defense of the Indians\nby saying that Spain might govern them for their own benefit. The\nindigenous peoples might even be treated “partly as\nslaves”. Moreover, once large-scale conversions had taken place,\nSpain could not abandon the New World. \nIn De temperantia Vitoria stated that all nations regarded\ncannibalism as an abomination. A prince might convert and suppress\nevil customs like human sacrifice on the grounds of justice; but\nforeign princes could not intervene. Vitoria also dismissed arguments\nfrom sins against nature as calumnies intended to excuse warfare and\nplunder. \nVitoria and the other authors of the School of Salamanca dealt with\nmartial law and developed a theory of just wars that was, on the one\nhand, based on Thomas Aquinas’ arguments and, on the other hand,\nbuilt on the foundation of the “classical doctrine of just\nwar” (Orend 2006). Vitoria dealt with just war in his lecture\nDe Indis relectio posterior sive De iure belli. He discusses\nwho can wage war—private persons only for self-defense, the\ncommonwealth, and the prince also for other reasons (Vitoria 1991b:\n299–302); what cannot be considered just reasons for waging war,\nsuch as difference in religion and enlargement of empire (1991b:\n302–304); what can be done in a just war (1991b: 304–306,\n314–317); and the view that it may not be enough if a prince\nbelieves that his war is just (1991b: 306–7). Vitoria regarded\n“perfect” commonwealths as able to defend themselves from\ninternal and external threats. The right of self-defense permitted the\nuse of force to repel force. A society, pagan or Christian, could wage\na just war in self-defense and execute malefactors. Vitoria accepted\nrepelling invaders and avenging injury as justifications for war, but\nnot the invasion of realms in order to acquire land, slaves or\nplunder. Religious difference and the vainglory of princes were also\nnot sufficient reasons. Those in authority could declare and wage war,\nbut they should take counsel about this. Subjects could not refuse\nservice in a just war. All necessary means were acceptable in a just\nconflict, even entering an enemy’s territory. Vitoria, however,\napplied a criterion of proportional harm to wars, so that a war was\nunjust if it caused more harm than good. Moreover, a ruler who had\nwaged an unjust war was obliged to make restitution. Booty could\nrecompense property unjustly seized by an enemy, but only if taken on\na superior’s orders. Vitoria permitted enslaving Saracens\ndefeated in a just conflict, but he denied that Christians could\nenslave other Christians. Moreover, he denounced devices used in\ncapturing slaves for export. Overall, Christians were expected to\nabide by the rules of war, showing moderation and humility when\nvictorious. \nSimilar ideas—legitimate authority; just cause, which only one\nside can have; trying all other ways of conflict resolution;\netc.—can be found in Suárez’ De bello, the\nthirteenth disputation of his De caritate. Molina, however,\nseems to have believed that, at least from a subjective point of view,\nboth sides may believe that their cause is just (Fernandes 2014). \nAccording to Molina, moreover, the ius gentium was not\nentirely a part of natural law, since it affirmed natural principles\nbut also embodied positive laws, including private property and\nslavery. Generally, it was in the period between Vitoria and\nSuárez that natural law was separated from the ius\ngentium, further divided by Suárez into the ius supra\ngentes (the law above nations) and the ius inter gentes\n(the law among nations), which eventually became international law in\nthe strict sense. Natural law and ius gentium were quite\nclose to each other in Roman Law and in Thomas Aquinas; but Vitoria,\nin his commentary on quaestio 57 in the Secunda\nsecundae of the Summa theologiae, already maintained\nthat, for Thomas, the ius gentium was part of positive law.\nSuárez makes it clear that, in contrast to natural law, which\nis inscribed in the heart of human beings and is immutably valid for\nall of them, the ius gentium is a positive convention among\npeoples or nations, which is valid for all or nearly for all of them;\nit includes the right to punish those who are defeated in a just war\nand, therefore, also the right of enslavement (De legibus II\nxviii 8). \nIt was furthermore the consensus among a majority of authors in the\nSchool of Salamanca that no wars could be waged against non-Christians\nby reason of their infidelity and that hostile actions could be\nresisted in self-defense. As we have seen, however, this natural\nimmunity did not extend to permitting cannibalism or human sacrifice.\nMolina, who favored the right to evangelize and permitted armed\nprotection for missionaries, was more wary than Vitoria of making free\ncommerce a right enforceable by war, using arguments which are\nsomewhat similar to those of Immanuel Kant, limiting\n“cosmopolitan right … to conditions of universal\nhospitality” in his treatise Toward Perpetual Peace\n(Kant 1795 [1996: 328–331]). For Molina as for Kant, the locals\nhave merely charitable obligations toward those who arrive in their\nterritories, if they are in need. They have no obligation to open them\ntheir ports. Countries might refuse to trade if they feared that\ncommerce was an excuse for conquest (Molina-DII II, 105). Just wars\ncould be waged by rulers, but hating the enemy was prohibited.\nSubjects were obliged to inquire about a ruler’s decision to\nwage a just war if there was “honest doubt” about it.\nMolina was willing to concede to the pope a role mediating between\nChristian rulers, but he warned against intervening directly in their\nsquabbles. \nOne of the recurring questions with respect to the treatment of\nindigenous peoples was whether their enslavement as slaves by nature\nin the traditional Aristotelian sense was justified. As mentioned\nabove, a famous discussion of this issue took place at the Junta of\nValladolid, when the Aristotelian Juan Ginés Sepúlveda\ndebated with the Dominican Bartolomé de Las Casas, an ardent\ndefender of the Amerindians and their rights. Sepúlveda argued\nthat the Amerindians, as barbarians, were slaves by nature, more or\nless on the level of beasts. Las Casas maintained that although there\nwere humans so simple-minded that they could be considered slaves by\nnature, such people existed in Spain as well as in the Americas (Hanke\n1959: 28–74). \nSoto, who also participated in the debate in Valladolid, said that the\nius gentium was a universally applicable form of positive\nhuman law, which was created by applying reason to natural principles.\nThis law governed trade, exchange of envoys, and even slavery, if it\nspared lives during war. It also included respect for property, even\nof non-Christians, to avoid squabbles over possessions. Nor was\nconversion a just reason for going to war and enslaving conquered\npeoples. \nSoto once considered going to the New World to resolve the\ncontroversies there. Unable to go himself, he advocated sending good\nmissionaries. In addition, his writings were employed by the Third\nMexican Council (1585) in the preparation of a confessors’\nmanual geared to a world of both Hispanic and Amerindian residents\n(Poole [ed.] 2018). Soto’s relectio on dominion\nconcluded that Spain’s title to the Indies was hard to justify.\nHe rejected the opinion of Sepúlveda on the justice of waging\nwar on infidels, also Pope Alexander VI’s division of overseas\ndomains between Spain and Portugal. Soto was trusted by all\nparticipants in the Junta of Valladolid to summarize the conflicting\nopinions of Las Casas and Sepúlveda, though he, or perhaps\nCano, another critic of conquest, may have been the one person who,\naccording to Sepúlveda, opposed him. The Dominicans of\nSalamanca continued to argue for just conduct by Spaniards in their\noverseas dominions; and also Jesuits like Molina, even in their\ndefense of slavery and slave trade, did not refer to the concept of\nslaves by nature. Soto, though accepting slavery, rejected the idea of\nnatural slavery: in his view, human beings who were incapable of\nleading their own lives clearly had to be guided by wiser men, but for\nreasons of their own well-being, not as living tools in the\nAristotelian sense. So, slavery for him was merely conventional. \nMolina, who wrote the first treatise on the Portuguese transatlantic\nslave trade, followed Soto on this point, accepting only conventional\nslavery. He justified slavery and mentioned the four just titles for\nenslavement: committing certain crimes; being captured in a just war;\nselling oneself because of urgent need; and the principle of\npartus sequitur ventrem, that is, the children of enslaved\nmothers are also slaves (Molina-DII II, disp. 33). Then he described\nthe history of the Portuguese slave trade and gave a critical\nevaluation of it (Molina-DII II, disp. 34–35). Interestingly,\nalthough he dealt intensively with the transatlantic slave trade,\nespecially from Africa, he never put forward a justification for\nenslavement based on race, though in his age were drawn to it. For\nexample, Noah’s curse on the children of Ham – or more\ncorrectly of Caanan (Genesis 9:20–7) – for mocking his\ndrunken nakedness, making them slaves of Sem and Japhet. Medieval\nconnections to Ham to blackness were used as a justification of\nAfricans from at least the fifteenth century to the nineteenth\n(Whitford 2009; Goldenberg 2017). \nAlongside the debates on just war, colonization, and the slave trade,\neconomics is perhaps the most striking example of how the theologians\nfrom the School of Salamanca used and transformed traditional medieval\ntheories in order to deal with new situations, creating innovative\nsolutions that had long-lasting influence. They have often been\nmentioned as the ancestors of the Austrian School of Economics, that\nin the late nineteenth and twentieth century emphasized the role of\nthe consumer’s estimation in the development of prices and the\nimportance of the market against any attempt at rationally planning\neconomic processes, while Molina has been described as a “solid\neconomic liberal” (Rothbard 2006: 113). This may be a\nrestrictive interpretation, because there is an undeniable relevance\nof the medieval heritage with its rigid condemnation of usury to be\nfound in the authors from the school of Salamanca. Their views on\neconomy are founded in natural law, implying therefore a normative\nview of economic processes instead of the purely strategic rationality\nof a homo oeconomicus. Nonetheless, the general consensus is\nthat there are liberal elements in late Scholastic economics\n(Schüssler 2014). Among the topics they dealt with were public\nfinance, the danger of exhausting public treasuries and of excessive\ntaxes (Chafuen 2003: 53–60), the just price for different goods\nand the problem of charging interest for lending money, which was\nconnected to the traditional condemnation of usury. The exchange of\nmoney was another major issue, because there were a large number of\nmonetary systems simultaneously in use within the Spanish and\nPortuguese kingdoms. According to Marjory Grice-Hutchinson, who\npublished an early and still important volume on their monetary\ntheory, the original contribution of the School of Salamanca in this\nfield consists  \nin its formulation of a psychological theory of value applied to both\ngoods and money, of the quantity theory, and of a theory of foreign\nexchange that closely resembles the modern purchasing-power parity\ntheory. (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 47–8.) \nA more or less common view of Spanish Scholastics on just price is\nthat the value of goods—and money—depends on estimation,\nnot primarily on the costs of production, nor on the needs of buyers\n(Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 48–51). It is not the communis\naestimatio of theologians that determines the natural price, but\nrather that of businessmen, as Molina says (Molina-DII II, 407); and\nit is not a fixed margin, but moves within a certain range, depending\nalso on the quantity of goods and money available. Monopolies are\ncriticized by Molina because they make such a determination of just\nprice impossible (Molina-DII II, 345). Some authors argued for a\npublic limitation on the price of foodstuffs. Molina favored support\nof the poor but hesitated to make only corn dealers pay for it,\nbecause a fixed price would prevent merchants from importing corn,\nthus damaging the common good (Molina-DII II, 365). \nThe first formulation of the quantity theory of money is often\nattributed to the jurist Martín de Azpilcueta, perhaps the best\nknown Salamancan writer on economic issues. In an appendix to his\nmanual for confessors, now published as On Exchange (1549\n[2014]), he discussed exchange, supply and demand, and money.\nAzpilcueta attempted to explain the rampant inflation of the sixteenth\ncentury as connected to the large-scale input of specie from the New\nWorld. Goods, he argued, were more costly when money was abundant.\nThis quantity theory of money was widely accepted throughout\nEurope. \nAzpilcueta, moreover, maintained that the exchange of money is not\nunnatural, contradicting Aristotle and many Scholastics. He treated\nmoney like other merchandise, positing that the morality of exchanges\nwhich were not dependent on money as their object was equitable. There\nwere different questions connected to exchange. One of these was\nwhether, in the case of petty exchange, it was licit to take more than\nthe legally fixed commission; this view was rejected, and the legal\ncommission was seen as binding in conscience (Alonso-Lasheras 2011:\n172–173). Another problem arose in relation to exchange bills\nbecause the value of money varied considerably between different\nplaces within the Spanish Empire, offering new possibilities of making\nand losing money. Spanish theologians such as Azpilcueta and Molina\ncountered the suspicion of usury associated with this kind of business\nby means of an early version of purchasing power theory according to\nwhich the exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when\ntheir purchasing power, i.e., what can be bought with a certain amount\nof money, remains the same (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 52–53;\nAlonso-Lasheras 2011: 179). Concerning the topic of lending money,\nauthors like Molina justified taking interest, first, by the\nlucrum cessans, the amount of money that the lender could\nhave made during the time it was on loan as a credit and, then, by the\npericulum sortis, the risk that he might lose his capital\n(Molina-DII II, 315). \nDespite the liberal elements which can be found in the works of\nauthors from the School of Salamanca, they nevertheless had a\ncompletely different understanding of the market from that of modern\nneoliberals.  \nThe market was first of all a physical place in which real people came\ntogether. These people possessed a moral conscience that was also part\nof the economic process. (Alonso-Lasheras 2011: 169) \nSpanish theologians were also involved in traditional discussions of\nlogic and metaphysics. Two representative examples will be discussed:\nSoto’s Summulae, a compendium on logic which is little\nknown today but which at the time was the compendium on logic\nin the Thomist tradition, ordered and paid for by the University of\nSalamanca in order to resist the influence of Nominalism; and\nSuárez’s famous and much studied treatise,\nDisputationes metaphysicae. \nSoto is regarded as responsible for the revival of Spanish-Thomistic\nlogic, as distinct from both Renaissance-oriented logic, which used\nonly ancient sources, and the extremely technical\n“sophistic” logic of Nominalism. His main sources were\nAristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Petrus Hispanus’ Summulae\nlogicales, from all of which, however, he deviated in many areas.\nIn his Summulae, especially starting with the second edition\nof 1547, which became one of the most influential textbooks of this\ngenre, he gives an introduction to traditional logic, including a\ntheory of terms, propositions and conclusions (Soto 1529 [1980]).\nWhereas Petrus Hispanus had been criticized for serious\ninconsistencies, Soto gives his own interpretation, in an effort to\nbuild up a coherent doctrine. In the presentation of the different\nkinds of terms, he did not follow the Aristotelian categories, but\ninstead presented the medieval distinctions between mental, written,\nand spoken terms, between categorematic and syncategorematic terms\n(that is, terms that have a meaning because they refer to things,\nconcepts or other terms and those which only make sense within\npropositions as connections, but cannot be a subject or predicate,\nsuch as ‘if’, ‘all’, etc.), between absolute\nand connotative terms, and so on. He continued by presenting different\nkinds of proposition, including a version of supposition\ntheory—the doctrine of the entities that the terms in a\nproposition, subject and predicate stand for (1529 [1980:\n31–36]). Here Soto also discussed Nominalist and realist\nobjections; but, in the end, he mostly defended the positions of\nPetrus Hispanus, largely omitting, however, complicated types of\nsupposition such as distributive, confused, merely confused, etc.,\nwhich had long puzzled medieval authors. The third book explains the\ndifferent kinds of relation between propositions, including an\nextended version of the square of oppositions (1529 [1980: 72]), as\nwell as truth conditions for modal propositions, conjunctions and\ndisjunctions. In his discussion of the different kinds of valid and\ninvalid conclusion, Soto not only referred to syllogisms (book 5) and\nthe so-called insolubilia, or reflections on paradoxes (book\n6), but also elements of the theory of consequentiae, a\nmedieval type of logical conclusion that may go back to the Stoic\nlogic of propositions (Read 1993; D’Ors 1983). \nWhile the Summulae provide something like a basic\nintroduction to the logical topics discussed at the time, Soto’s\nIn dialecticam Aristotelis commentarii (Salamanca 1543)\ncontains philosophical reflections on questions such as whether logic\nis a science and if so, what kind of logic, the logica docens\nin contrast to logica utens, which is a “mode of\nknowing”, and whether the subject of dialectics is an ens\nrationis (Di Liso 2000: 221–250). These reflections are\npresented within the context of a selective commentary on the\nAristotelian Organon, omitting De interpretatione and the\nAnalytica Priora, which were treated in the Summulae\n(ibid.). He also wrote Super octo libros Physicorum\ncommentarii and Super octo libros Physicorum quaestiones\nas part of the Artes liberales course. \nSuárez’s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597) was\npublished in eighteen editions over a few decades in printing centers\nthroughout Europe—not only in Catholic, but also in Protestant\nregions—and had an enormous influence on philosophy teaching in\nEuropean universities. It is still considered to be the most complete\nand comprehensive presentation of prima philosophia; and it\nwas the most important link between Scholastic metaphysics and\nseventeenth-century school philosophy, influencing Descartes, Leibniz,\nand Wolff. Although modern scholars debate the roots of the extremely\ncomplicated system of metaphysics which Suárez presents in the\ntreatise, they seem to agree that he created a kind of synthesis of\nThomist and Scotist theories. Only a very general survey of the topics\ndiscussed in Suárez’s 54 metaphysical disputations can be\nprovided here, along with a brief mention of some of the most\nimportant approaches to their interpretation. \nSuárez’s Disputationes do not follow the\nstructure of Aristotle’s Metaphysics. Instead, he\nstarts with an extensive introduction to the Aristotelian treatise,\naccording to a slightly different order than in modern editions, and\nindicates the precise places where the topics discussed there can be\nfound in his disputations. His first disputation reflects on the\nnature metaphysics as prima philosophia. It is followed by\ndisputations on the concept of being (ens), its passions,\ndifferent understandings of unity, on the true and the false, and the\ngood and the bad. The pivotal role that these\n“transcendentals” of medieval metaphysics play in\nSuárez’s metaphysics was the basis for the interpretation\nof his theoretical philosophy as transcendental (Honnefelder 1990).\nNext come sixteen disputations dedicated to the four Aristotelian\ncauses (material, formal, efficient, and final), followed by the\nvarious divisions of being (infinite and finite, uncreated and\ncreated—including some kind of rational theology which discusses\nquestions such as whether God can be recognized with natural reason\n(Disp. XXIX), whether there are physical proofs for God’s\nexistence (Disp. XXX) etc.—and the division of created being\ninto substance and accidents). Then there are about twenty\ndisputations dealing with the Aristotelian categories, concluding with\none on the special theoretical problems associated with the concept of\nens rationis, which does not belong to any of the previously\ndiscussed categories. \nInterpretations of the Disputationes metaphysicae over the\nlast decades have all attempted to fit Suárez into a kind of\ntheoretical history (Darge 2004: 7–26). Gilson (1949) identified\nan essentialism (according to the Thomist distinction between\nens and essentia) that neglects the act of being in\nfavor of a purely abstract conceptualization and that can be traced in\na line of thinkers from Avicenna through Duns Scotus and Suárez\nto Wolff and Kant. Honnefelder (1990) sees Suárez as dependent\non the same earlier philosophers, but he does not present it as a\nhistory of decadence from a Thomist perspective, as Gilson did, but\nrather as a success story for the transcendental Scotist approach.\nScotus uses a univocal instead of an analogous concept of being for\ncreated and uncreated substance (i.e., God) and individuates the realm\nof what may be meant by “being” based on the most general\nunderstanding of being as “id cui non repugnat\nesse”, i.e., the existence of which does not imply logical\ncontradictions. Furthermore, he gives a modal explication of the\ndifferent grades of finite and infinite being including the existence\nof finite and infinite substance. Courtine (1990) and Boulnois (1999)\nshare this “Scotist perspective”, but they see it more as\na move from the science of what is to the science of what can be\nthought, that is, an onto-logic. Precisely in the years when the term\n“ontology” was coined by Rudolf Goclenius (Lamanna\n2013), it no\nlonger referred to the “furniture of the universe”, as\nPutnam (1985: 28) called it, but instead to ways of thinking and\nspeaking about the things in the world—a process that ends with\nthe determination of what is through our speaking about it. Darge,\nfinally, tries to free Suárez from this purely logicistic\ninterpretation and from the Scotist perspective, in order to emphasize\nhis innovative merits against his classification as an intermediate\nfigure between Duns Scotus and Thomas, on the one hand, and Wolff and\nKant, on the other. There is no doubt, however, that\n“Renaissance and Baroque scholastic culture”, to which\nSuárez doubtlessly belongs, has finally become an object of\nserious research (Novák 2014: 2). This research is not only\nproviding a general systematization and historical integration of\nSuárez’s metaphysics, but also investigating particular\naspects of his extremely rich theory (Hill and Lagerlund 2012); Novák\n2014). \nIt is difficult to give a precise evaluation of the influence of the\nSchool of Salamanca in the many fields to which it contributed. There\nare various ideological motives, apart from the general tendency to\nconceal one’s sources, why later authors did not mention these\ntheologians. This was especially the case for philosophers,\ntheologians, and legal theorists from the Protestant North with their\naversion to Catholic thinkers, and especially Jesuits. Quarrels arose,\nfor instance, as to whether the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius\n(1583–1645) was the father of modern natural law and\ninternational law or whether he only copied and slightly altered the\nworks of Suárez and other Spanish authors. Another pertinent\nissue is that Suárez was regarded as the\nrepresentative of “the schools”, to which the founders of\nmodern philosophy opposed their new philosophical systems, often\ndenying their heritage. Some works by Spanish Scholastics therefore\nfell into oblivion. In recent years, however, the ideological barriers\nhave vanished, and there is a growing interest in an open-minded\ndiscussion of the School’s achievements and impact. \nAs has been indicated, the School of Salamanca is credited with a role\nin the development of international law. The gradual detachment of the\nius gentium from natural law, particularly as it pertained to\nissues such as slavery and the slave trade, was another notable\naccomplishment, So, too, was its consistent defense of the full\nhumanity of the Amerindians. That argument could be applied to other\nnon-European peoples who had also never heard of Jesus; their regimes\nand property rights were closely tied to reason and natural law. \nThe School, in addition, made important contributions to areas such as\ntrade and finance. Azpilcueta’s approach to inflation and his\ndefense of the morality of exchange was a step toward a culture of\naccepted risk and profit. Vitoria’s argument that commerce fell\nwithin the ius gentium was not embraced by everyone in the\nSchool; but this argument had a direct influence on Grotius. Moreover,\nalthough a Protestant and an opponent of papal claims to temporal\npower, Grotius drew on Thomas Aquinas, Cajetan, and Vitoria to argue\nfor the freedom of the seas and to develop a framework for\ninternational law. Because of the School’s role in the\ndevelopment of economic theory, some economists, including those\nbelonging to the Austrian School of National Economy, refer to them as\ntheir ancestors. \nSuárez and Mariana formulated theories of resistance to\nunacceptable rulers, which Roman Catholic thinkers engaged in opposing\nProtestantism and Protestant rulers like James I (England) found\nattractive. In the heated atmosphere of the times, it is possible that\nthese theories may have inspired the Catholic fanatics who\nassassinated Henry III (Valois), Henry IV (Bourbon), and William the\nSilent (Nassau). Similar theories were also developed by Protestant\nwriters, including French Huguenots and Calvinists in the Low\nCountries. \nMembers of the School of Salamanca departed from Aristotle and Thomas\nAquinas as they saw fit. This is apparent in Soto’s logic and\nSuárez’s widely read metaphysics. Less noted until\nrecently is the influence of Soto on Galileo. Diverging from\nAristotle, Soto advanced theories that have been described (Duhem\n1913, 555-562) as forerunners of\nthe modern idea of mechanics. His theory of falling bodies was well\nknown to Jesuit scholars, who circulated it through their writings. As\na young student, Galileo was probably exposed to these ideas, which\ninfluenced his approach to the physical laws governing the universe\n(Wallace 1981 and 2004). Galileo’s theories about falling bodies\neclipsed Soto’s, while his astronomical observations helped to\ncreate a heliocentric and un-Aristotelian intellectual milieu, in\nwhich many ideas of the School of Salamanca were regarded as\nobsolete. \nStarting in the 1930s, with the work of James Brown Scott and others,\nthe School of Salamanca gained renewed attention for its contribution\nto ideas of international law, including respect for non-Christian\npeoples. Academic interest overcame old prejudices tied to\nEurope’s past confessional and ideological divisions. The\ninterest of economists in monetarism also placed Salamanca in the\nscholarly mainstream. The revived study of Scholasticism has drawn\nattention to Soto, Molina, and Suárez, while modern editions,\nincluding those in the series “Corpus Hispanorum de Pace”,\nhave made these thinkers more accessible to a new generation of\nscholars.","contact.mail":"matthias.kaufmann@phil.uni-halle.de","contact.domain":"phil.uni-halle.de"}]
