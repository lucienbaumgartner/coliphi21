In spite of this widespread disagreement about the\ncontent of naturalism and non-naturalism there is considerable\nagreement about the status of certain historically influential\nphilosophical accounts as non-naturalist. In particular, there is\nwidespread agreement that G.E. Moore’s account of goodness in\nPrincipia Ethica is a paradigmatically non-naturalist\naccount. Indeed, if a representative sample of contemporary\nphilosophers were asked to name a non-naturalist in meta-ethics then\nMoore’s name almost certainly would predominate.  For better or worse,\nMoore’s discussion of non-naturalism profoundly shaped 20th\ncentury meta-ethics. Thomas Baldwin was not exaggerating much when he\nclaimed that, “twentieth century British ethical theory is\nunintelligible without reference to Principia Ethica; its\nhistory until 1960 or so being, in brief, that although Moore was\ntaken to have refuted ‘ethical naturalism’, Moore’s own\nbrand of ‘ethical non-naturalism’ was thought to make\nunacceptable metaphysical and epistemological demands; so the only\nrecourse was to abandon belief in an objective moral reality and\naccept an emotivist, prescriptivist or otherwise anti-realist, account\nof ethical values.” (Baldwin 1990: 66) More recent defenders of\nnon-naturalist theories (e.g. Shafer-Landau 2003, Enoch 2011, and\nParfit 2011) often distinguish their accounts from Moore’s in a number\nof ways, but few if any would dispute that Moore’s account is a\nparadigmatically non-naturalist one.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, simply characterizing non-naturalism in terms of\nMoore’s view is not very helpful for at least three reasons. First, we\nstill need some way of determining which dimensions of similarity to\nMoore’s views are the relevant ones. This is a standard problem with\ntrying to understand a genus in terms of a particularly salient species\nthereof. Second, Moore defended a variety of theses about goodness in\nPrincipia which have been referred to as forms of\nnon-naturalism, so we are then left with the question what these views\nhave in common in virtue of which they are all forms of non-naturalism.\nThird, Moore’s non-naturalist account of goodness in Principia\nis itself unclear in certain crucial respects. Indeed, his later “Reply\nto My Critics,” Moore himself admitted that his attempts in\nPrincipia to explain in what sense goodness was a non-natural\nproperty were untenable (Moore 1942: 582). Nonetheless, Moore’s account\nin Principia is important to bear in mind when trying to\ncharacterize non-naturalism in meta-ethics. For a plausible constraint\non any such characterization is that it not imply that Moore clearly\ndid not put forward a form of non-naturalism in Principia.\nWith this constraint in hand, we are in a position to develop a more\ngeneral characterization of non-naturalism.\n\n\n\nVery roughly, non-naturalism in meta-ethics is the idea that moral\nphilosophy is fundamentally autonomous from the natural sciences. More\naccurately, a family of related but distinct doctrines has gone under\nthe heading ‘non-naturalism’. In some contexts,\n‘non-naturalism’ denotes the semantic thesis that moral\npredicates cannot be analyzed in non-normative terms (see Shaver 2000\nand Gibbard 2002: 153). In other contexts, ‘non-naturalism’\ndenotes the epistemological thesis that knowledge of basic moral\nprinciples and value judgements are in some sense self-evident (see\nFrankena 1963: 85–86). However, this view (which some self-styled naturalists would actually accept) is more often and more usefully referred to as\n‘intuitionism’ and I shall henceforth also refer to it as\nsuch. Most often, ‘non-naturalism’ denotes the\nmetaphysical thesis that moral properties exist and are not identical\nwith or reducible to any natural property or properties in some\ninteresting sense of ‘natural’. However, just which sense\nof ‘natural’ is most apt in this context is highly\ncontroversial and I shall return to this point shortly. Understood in\nthis way, non-naturalism is a form of moral realism and is opposed to\nnon-cognitivist positions according to which moral utterances serve to\nexpress non-cognitive attitudes rather than beliefs that provide their\ntruth conditions and is also opposed to error-theoretical positions\naccording to which there are no moral facts. Moreover, each of these\ndifferent conceptions of non-naturalism bears interesting relations of\nsupport to the others. For example, a prima facie plausible explanation\nof the alleged immunity of moral predicates from analysis in\nnon-normative terms (non-naturalism in the first sense) would be that\nmoral predicates denote non-natural properties (which entails\nnon-naturalism in the third sense). Perhaps unsurprisingly, Moore\naccepted non-naturalism in all three of these senses. Because\nnon-naturalism is far more often understood in the third of these three\nways I shall henceforth use ‘non-naturalism’ with the third\nof these three meanings unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\nIt is also sometimes suggested that non-naturalism is the thesis\nthat moral properties are sui generis and irreducible (see,\ne.g. Pigden 1993: 421–422), and indeed this is one of the most\ndistinctive aspects of Moore’s account of goodness. However, this is\nnot the best way to understand non-naturalism. For intuitively whether\na property is natural is orthogonal to whether it is sui\ngeneris. We should preserve conceptual space for properties that\nare natural and irreducible (fundamental properties of physics are\nperhaps the least controversial examples, but many would argue that the\nfundamental properties of psychology and sociology are also irreducible\nbut natural) as well as properties that are non-natural but reducible\nto other non-natural properties (perhaps rightness is reducible to\ngoodness or vice versa even if both are non-natural). Indeed, Moore\nhimself was at one stage a non-naturalist about rightness but\nnonetheless thought that rightness was reducible to the property of\nbeing the action with the best outcome, though he later abandoned this\nview. Furthermore, a number of self-styled contemporary naturalists\nhold that moral properties are both natural and irreducible (Richard\nMiller and Nicholas Sturgeon, for example) and we\nshould try to accommodate this characterization of their view. In\nPrincipia Moore often (though not always – he considers\nthe example of yellowness) seems to ignore the fact that a property\nmight be both natural and irreducible.  Undoubtedly this has led to\nsome confusion in later discussions of naturalism and non-naturalism\n(for useful discussion of Moore on this point, see Baldwin 1990:\n83–84).\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most vexing problem for any general characterization of\nnon-naturalism is the bewildering array of ways in which the\ndistinction between natural and non-natural properties has been drawn.\nNatural properties have variously been characterized as properties that\n(i) are the subject matter of the natural sciences (Moore 1903: 40),\n(ii) are invoked in scientific explanations (Little 1994: 226), (iii)\nwould be identified by the best scientific theory and can be described\nin conceptual terms available to a being occupying a non-local point of\nview on the world (Crisp 1996: 117), (iv) can be known only a\nposteriori (Copp 2002, Moore 1903: 39), (v) can exist by themselves in\ntime (Moore 1903: 41), (vi) confer causal powers (Lewis 1983), (vii)\nfigure in the laws of nature (Vallentyne 1998), or (viii) explains\nsimilarity relations (Lewis 1983), e.g. why a black cat is more similar\nto a white cat than to a black dog. The first four of these\ncharacterizations are epistemological, and three of those four are cast\nexplicitly in terms of scientific inquiry; the remaining three are\nmetaphysical.\n\n\n\nSome of these characterizations can be put to one side rather\neasily. For example, the thesis that natural properties must be capable\nof existing by themselves in time [(v) above] seems to make the very\nidea of a natural property deeply problematic. As C.D. Broad argued\n(see Broad 1942), it is unclear how the roundness and brownness of a\npenny, for example, could exist in time by themselves. In light of this\nobjection, Moore himself eventually abandoned this way of\ncharacterizing natural properties (Moore 1942: 581–582). Understanding\nnatural properties as those studied by the natural sciences [(i) above]\nthreatens to make our characterization of the natural implausibly\ndependent on what the actual objects of scientific investigation happen\nto be, as if there could not be natural properties our actual\nscientific investigation somehow never discovered. It also makes it\nunclear why moral philosophy is not one of the sciences (Baldwin 1985:\n26). We could try to finesse this point by holding that natural\nproperties need not actually be the subject matter of the natural\nsciences but instead only must be fit for investigation by the natural\nsciences but this characterization is simply not very illuminating. For\nit cries out for a characterization of what makes something fit for\nstudy by the natural sciences, and that further characterization seems\nlikely to do all the work in explaining what is involved in a property\nbeing natural.\n\n\n\nSo we can narrow down the list of candidate ways of characterizing\nthe natural/non-natural distinction. Still, it would be very difficult\nand perhaps impossible to determine just which of the remaining\ncharacterizations of natural properties would provide “the” best way of\ncharacterizing the distinction between naturalism and non-naturalism in\nmeta-ethics. More likely, there are advantages and disadvantages to\neach of the remaining taxonomies on offer. Moreover, which\nunderstanding of the distinction between naturalism and non-naturalism\nis the most helpful will vary depending on the context and indeed on\none’s more substantive philosophical commitments. I shall therefore not\nhere undertake the fool’s errand of privileging one particular way of\nmaking the distinction between natural and non-natural properties.\nInstead I shall simply try to indicate in the discussion of the\narguments for and against non-naturalism where these differences might\nmatter.\n\n\n\nMoore famously claimed that naturalists were guilty of what he called\nthe “naturalistic fallacy.” In particular, Moore accused\nanyone who infers that X is good from any proposition\nabout X’s natural properties of having committed the\nnaturalistic fallacy. Assuming that being pleasant is a natural\nproperty, for example, someone who infers that drinking beer is good\nfrom the premise that drinking beer is pleasant is supposed to have\ncommitted the naturalistic fallacy. The intuitive idea is that\nevaluative conclusions require at least one evaluative\npremise—purely factual premises about the naturalistic features\nof things do not entail or even support evaluative conclusions. Moore\nhimself focused on goodness, but if the argument works for goodness\nthen it seems likely to generalize to other moral properties. \n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Moore in effect also argues that most forms\nof non-naturalism are also guilty of what he calls the naturalistic\nfallacy. In particular, he argues that so-called “metaphysical ethics,”\naccording to which goodness is a non-natural property existing in\n“supersensible reality” also are guilty of the naturalistic fallacy.\nSo, for example, a view according to which goodness is the property of\nbeing commanded by God where God is understood as existing outside of\nNature is also charged with having committed the naturalistic fallacy.\nThis suggests that the naturalistic fallacy is not well named in that\nit is not specifically a problem for naturalists, and Moore admits as\nmuch. If the point were purely terminological then it would be trifling\nbut an important philosophical point is at stake here. The real force\nof Moore’s argument is supposed to be that attempts to reduce moral\nproperties to anything else are doomed to fail. This is why Moore’s own\nview of goodness as sui generis and irreducible is supposed to\navoid the naturalistic fallacy. Since the\nreductionist/anti-reductionist distinction cuts across the\nnaturalist/non-naturalist distinction (properly understood), this\nsuggests that the real target of Moore’s argument is reductionism\nrather than naturalism. Admittedly, if Moore is right then at least\nreductionist forms of naturalism fall prey to the naturalistic fallacy\nand it is therefore still relevant to the debate over naturalism and\nnon-naturalism. However, the non-naturalist will need a separate\nargument against those naturalists who hold that moral properties\nnatural but irreducible. As noted in the Introduction, Moore seems to\nhave ignored the distinction between naturalism and reductionism and\nthis is one important case in which that mistake seems important. \n\nThe naturalistic fallacy is very poorly named indeed (a point also\nmade by Bernard Williams; see Williams 1985: 121–122). For not\nonly is it not especially a problem for naturalists, it is also not\nreally a fallacy even if Moore is right that it embodies a mistake of\nsome kind.  For it is highly uncharitable to charge anyone who\nadvances the sorts of arguments to which Moore alludes as having\ncommitted a logical fallacy. Rather, charity demands that we interpret\nsuch arguments as enthymematic, and usually this is easy enough. For\nexample, we should understand ‘X is pleasant,\ntherefore X is good’ as an enthymeme whose suppressed\npremise is ‘Whatever is pleasant is good’. Nor must the\nnon-naturalist even quarrel with such a suppressed premise. One can\nallow that goodness is itself a non-natural property but grant that\nall pleasant things necessarily have that non-natural property. What\nthe non-naturalist must reject is the thesis that such suppressed\npremises are true in virtue of the identity of goodness with the\nnatural property in question (being pleasant, in this case). So the\nso-called naturalistic fallacy is no fallacy at all.  Rather, if Moore\nis right then the so-called naturalistic fallacy actually embodies a\nmistaken belief about the reducibility of goodness, perhaps the belief\nthat ‘good’ just means ‘pleasant’ (or\nwhatever). However, to suppose that whenever someone is metaphysically\nor semantically confused he is guilty of a ‘fallacy’ robs\nthe term of its more standard and useful meaning. This point was made\nvery clearly by W.K. Frankena in a landmark article published\nin Mind (Frankena 1939). \n\nFinally, as Frankena also nicely pointed out, it cannot be assumed\nat the outset that what Moore calls the naturalistic fallacy really is\na mistake of any kind. For certain naturalists could then reasonably\ncomplain that the central question has been begged. The naturalist\nproposes a certain kind of definition of some moral term and the\nnon-naturalist then simply asserts that anyone who thinks such\ndefinitions are possible is mistaken. If we want to find a\nnon-question-begging argument against naturalism then we must look\nbeyond the so-called “naturalistic fallacy.” \n\nMoore’s “Open Question Argument” for the conclusion that goodness is a\nnon-natural property is closely related to his worries about the\nnaturalistic fallacy. Consider any proposed naturalistic analysis N of\na moral predicate M. The Open Question Argument maintains that it will\nalways be possible for someone competent with moral discourse without\nconceptual confusion to grant that something is N but still wonder\nwhether it is really M. Whether goodness is co-instantiated with any\nnatural property or set of natural properties is in this sense always\na conceptually open question. If, however, N really was an accurate\nanalysis of M then the question, “I know it is N but is it M?” would\nnot be open in this way for a conceptually competent judge any more\nthan the question, “I know he is a bachelor but is he unmarried?” can\nbe an open one. Moore himself used the Open Question Argument to\ndefend a non-naturalist account of goodness but held that rightness\nwas reducible to goodness. Moore held that it was true by definition\nthat right actions maximize goodness, though he later came to the\nconclusion that this definition of rightness was also vulnerable to an\nOpen Question Argument. A very similar argument was used by Sidgwick\nto establish that certain moral notions are irreducible (see Sidgwick\n1907: Book I, Chapter 3) and Moore credits Sidgwick with the idea\n(Moore 1903: 17). More recently, some philosophers have argued that\nnaturalism cannot capture the normativity of moral properties, and\nthese arguments also seem to be very similar to the Open Question\nArgument. The idea seems to be that for any naturalistic reduction one\noffers of some seemingly normative notion one can, without betraying\nany conceptual incompetence, admit that something has the property\nspecified by the reductive account but hold that this lacks\nnormativity—does not provide any reasons for action (see Dancy\n1996: 180–183).  \n\nOn its face, the Open Question Argument seems to beg the question\nagainst the naturalist just as much as the charge of a naturalistic\nfallacy. For if the naturalist holds that a given moral predicate M is\nequivalent in meaning to some definition N couched entirely in\nnon-moral predicates then she is obviously committed to holding that\nthe relevant questions are not open and the naturalist might therefore\nsimply deny the main premise of Moore’s argument. However, the Open\nQuestion Argument can be given a non-question-begging interpretation.\nThe crucial move is to understand the argument as an argument to the\nbest explanation. On this interpretation, the main premise of the\nargument is not that the relevant questions are conceptually open, but\nthe much more modest premise that they at least seem conceptually open\nto competent users of moral terms. The argument then proceeds to claim\nthat the best explanation of its seeming to competent users of the\nterms that these questions are open is that they really are open. That\nis, after all, a relatively simple and direct explanation of the\nphenomenon and the sort of explanation that we seem to accept by\ndefault when considering conceptual questions in general. This argument\ndoes not beg the question insofar as the opponent of non-naturalism can\ngrant that the relevant questions do seem open without thereby\ncontradicting their position—the main premise of this argument does\nnot directly entail non-naturalism. \n\nOnce again, however, the scope of the argument is not as great as\nMoore supposed. For anti-reductionist forms of naturalism (like Sturgeon’s) seem as invulnerable to the argument as Moore’s\nnon-naturalist account. Still, if the argument were to defeat all\nreductionist forms of naturalism that would be of substantial interest\nand might well be part of larger argument for non-naturalism when\ncombined with an independent argument against anti-reductionist forms\nof naturalism (for further discussion, see Ball 1988, Ball 1991 and\nBaldwin 1990: 87–89). \n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Open Question Argument so understood\nstill faces an impressive battery of objections. Perhaps the meaning of\na predicate is not as transparent to competent users of the predicate\nas Moore implicitly assumes. For example, some have argued that\ncompetence with a predicate consists in being disposed (for the most\npart) to use the predicate only in ways that are consistent with\ncertain “platitudes” in which the predicate figures (see, e.g. Jackson\nand Pettit 1995). A correct definition of the term might then be\nunderstood as one that best explains those platitudes. On this sort of\naccount a competent user of moral terms might respect the platitudes\nbut not recognize the theory that best explicates those platitudes even\nif presented with it. An analogy with grammar illustrates the point.\nLet us suppose that competent speakers are ones who are disposed (for\nthe most part) to follow certain grammatical rules but they might not\nrecognize those rules as valid when presented with them. The question,\n“I know the sentence violates this rule but is it ungrammatical?” might\ntherefore seem to them to be an open one and there need be no mystery\nin this. The same might be true in the moral case. The non-naturalist\nmight respond to this by arguing that if the proposed “platitudes” are\nsubstantial enough to fix the reference of moral terms to some natural\nproperty then the platitudes themselves are vulnerable to an Open\nQuestion Argument. The analogy with grammar might seem to break down at\njust this point. For there seems to be much more room for intelligible\nmoral disagreement amongst competent judges in spite of agreement about\neverything else than there is for grammatical disagreement amongst\ncompetent judges in spite of agreement about everything else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best explanation of the apparent\n“openness” of the relevant questions to competent users is that the\npredicates do not refer to properties at all. For it might be held that\nmoral predicates do purport to refer to non-natural properties but fail\nto refer precisely because those properties would have to be so queer.\nThis would be to defend a kind of error theory, as defended by John\nMackie (see Mackie 1977 and Joyce 2001). In effect, this would be to\ngrant that the non-naturalist is right about the semantics (moral\npredicates do purport to refer to non-natural properties) but wrong\nabout the metaphysics (the non-naturalist is wrong to suppose moral\npredicates refer to anything). \n\nEven more radically, it might be maintained that moral predicates do\nnot even purport to refer to properties and that this explains why the\nrelevant questions seem open. In particular, it has been argued that a\nnon-cognitivist analysis of moral discourse can explain why the\nrelevant questions seem open. The question, “I know its pleasant but is\nit good?” seems open on this account because one can admit that\nsomething is pleasant (or has whatever natural property you like)\nwithout having decided to approve (or disapprove) of the thing in\nquestion. It is easy enough to see why this would also block the\ninference to non-naturalism. For on a non-cognitivist account, as\ntraditionally understood, moral predicates do not even purport to refer\nto properties but rather serve to express speakers’ pro- and\ncon-attitudes. Hence, the non-cognitivist concludes, moral predicates\ndo not refer to properties at all, much less non-natural ones (see,\ne.g., Ayer 1952). In fact, it is fair to say that non-cognitivists\neventually gained at least as much mileage from the Open Question\nArgument as non-naturalists. \n\nFinally, more sophisticated forms of reductionist naturalism hold\nthat while moral predicates do refer to natural properties, they do not\nso refer in virtue of any sort of analytic equivalence between moral\npredicates and non-moral predicates. The analogy here is with certain\ntheories of reference borrowed from the discussion of proper names and\nnatural kinds (see, e.g., Boyd 1988). Some philosophers have held that\nidentifications of natural kinds like ‘water=H2O’ are\nnecessarily true but not analytic. Rather, they are a posteriori\nnecessary truths that hold in virtue of ‘water’ bearing the\nright causal relation (it has not been easy to say what causal\nrelations are of the right kind) to H2O. Water and H2O may well be the\nsame property but a competent user of ‘water’ need not know\nthis. Indeed, before the discovery of modern chemistry most users of\n‘water’ did not know this and it is not obvious that the\nmeaning of the word changed in light of this discovery. If this is a\nplausible semantic theory and if a similar theory is true of moral\npredicates (a thesis that requires further argument) then the Open\nQuestion Argument is in trouble. For given this semantic theory, just\nas a competent user of ‘water’ and ‘H2O’ could\nwithout confusion say, “I know it is H2O but is it water?” a competent\nuser of ‘good’ and ‘pleasant’ could say, “I\nknow it is pleasant but is it good?” without confusion. Whether this\nsort of causal theory of reference is plausible in the case of moral\nvocabulary is more controversial, but the defender of the Open Question\nArgument needs some reason to reject the analogy. \n\nHow can we come to know anything about non-natural properties? The\nquestion is a reasonable one on any of the myriad ways in which\nnon-natural properties have been conceived. On many characterizations,\nnon-natural properties by definition elude scientific investigation\nwhich many take to be the most reliable form of knowledge available to\nus. On other characterizations, non-natural properties are causally\ninert which makes it hard to see how we could reliably detect them. \n\nAt least two kinds of questions are relevant here. First, once we\nhave a particular property in mind how can we know it is a moral one?\nSecond, how do we come to know anything about moral properties apart\nfrom knowing they are moral? The first question might seem more\ndifficult for the naturalist than for some non-naturalists; if goodness\nreally is a sui generis non-natural property then perhaps\nbeing directly acquainted with it is sufficient for recognizing it as\nmoral. The second question, though, is easier for the naturalist than\nthe non-naturalist. Since the naturalist holds that moral properties\nare either identical to or reducible to some subset of natural\nproperties there need be no mystery about how we come to have some\nknowledge of those properties even if there is some residual mystery as\nto how we discover that they are the moral ones. Or, at least, a\ncommitment to naturalism in meta-ethics introduces no new problems\nabout how we come to know anything about these properties. For given\nnaturalism, the moral properties might well be identical to or\nreducible to familiar properties like the property of promoting\nhappiness or the property of being truthful. In general we learn about\nsuch natural properties through observation and scientific inquiry and\nthe naturalist can “piggy back” on whatever more general\nepistemological theory explains our ability to come to know anything\nabout those properties. We learn, for example, what kinds of upbringing\npromote honesty through empirical observation and theorizing.\nNon-naturalism can be understood in many different ways, but none seems\nto make the task of explaining the possibility of moral knowledge as\nstraightforward as it seems to be for the naturalist. \n\nThe non-naturalist’s standard move here is to defend some form of\n“intuitionism.” In its most straightforward form, intuitionism holds\nthat we come to know about moral properties through direct observation\nof those properties. Just as we can learn that cat is on the mat\nthrough direct observation we can also learn that kicking the cat on\nthe mat is wrong through direct observation. If we have the appropriate\nmoral sensibilities and just look carefully enough at a given situation\nthen we should be able to discern the relevant moral properties as such\nquite directly. It is worth noting that this move is in principle\navailable to naturalists as well as non-naturalists. In some cases this\nwill be easy; if you watch a bully beat up a defenseless child for fun\nthen it should be easy enough to see the cruelty and wrongness of his\naction. In other cases, discerning the moral facts will be much more\ndifficult. However, the difficulty of such cases is compatible with\nintuitionism. Familiarity with aesthetes makes it clear that perceiving\ncertain properties can be very subtle and require considerable training\nand attention. Plausibly, an intuitionist epistemology fits better\nwith some versions of non-naturalism than others. If, for example, we\nunderstand non-natural properties as properties we can know only a\npriori then the idea that we come to know them through perception seems\nproblematic. In any event, if intuitionism is defensible then it\nprovides the non-naturalist with an answer to both of the questions\nraised above. Plausibly, if we directly perceive moral properties (at\nleast partly answering the second question) then we also directly\nperceive that they are moral (answering the first question). \n\nSometimes the intuitionist’s perceptual characterization of moral\nknowledge is metaphorical. The idea is that moral knowledge is not\nliterally perceptual in the first instance but is somehow very much\nlike perceptual knowledge. This approach has its advantages. In trying\nto make sense of the idea of moral perception of non-natural\nproperties, some intuitionists have maintained that our ability to have\nveridical experiences of the moral properties is in virtue of our\nhaving a special faculty of mind whose function is to detect such\nproperties. This raises a number of questions about the origin and\nfunctioning of such a faculty. An account that claims only that moral\nknowledge is somehow like perceptual knowledge need not face these\ndifficulties. Of course, such accounts run the risk of being too vague\nto be helpful unless some less metaphorical account of moral knowledge\nis forthcoming. Even those who take the idea or perceptual moral\nknowledge literally are not thereby committed to belief in such special\nfaculties. Perhaps moral perception is continuous with other ordinary\nforms of perception even if it is literally the perception of a\nnon-natural property. If non-natural properties are by definition\ncausally inert then this position seems problematic. On other ways of\nunderstanding non-natural properties, though, whether there is a\nproblem will depend on further controversial philosophical questions.\nFor example, if non-natural properties are understood as properties\nthat would not figure in the best scientific account of reality then\nthe issue obviously concerns the authority of science to determine the\nanswers to all ontological questions. Non-naturalists sometimes accuse\ntheir opponents of crude scientism for assuming that science has such\nauthority and this brings out some deeper methodological differences\nbetween naturalists and non-naturalists (see below, “Methodology”).  One interesting objection to the non-naturalist’s deployment of\nintuitionism is that this combination of views makes it a\n“cosmic coincidence” that our intuitions would reliably\ntrack the moral facts (see Bedke 2009).  The force of the worry\nderives from the fact that non-natural properties, on some construals,\nare causally inert, whereas our intuitions are psychological states\nand hence part of the natural world.  It is simply not clear how our\nintuitions could reliably track such facts, given that they are\ncausally isolated from them.  An obvious contrast is with the way in\nwhich our knowledge of the empirical world plausibly does depend on\nreliability secured through suitable causal connections.  This is\nobviously related to other worries about the way in which the origins\nof our moral intuitions does not cohere well with their reliability,\ngiven non-naturalism – e.g. worries which focus more on the Darwinian\ninfluences on human moral judgment (see also Street 2006; for a reply\nto such worries, see Vavova forthcoming).  Interestingly, some\nnon-naturalists have tried to give a Darwinian argument for a kind of\nnon-theological pre-established harmony between our moral intuitions\nand the moral facts (see especially Enoch 2011).  An even more fundamental worry arising out of the causal inertness\nof moral properties, given non-naturalism, is how our words and\nconcepts manage so much as to be about those properties.  Certainly on\na causal theory of reference it would be very hard indeed to explain\nhow our moral words and concepts could refer to such sui generis moral\nproperties.  This worry about what is sometimes called “semantic\naccess” has only recently started to get the attention it\ndeserves – see Wedgwood 2009 and Enoch 2011.  Matti Eklund develops this worry about reference determination in an especially powerful way (Eklund 2017).  He argues that a constraint on a plausible theory of reference determination must ensure that what he calls the “normative role” (roughly, the practical role played by normative predicates in our deliberations about what to do) must be sufficient to determine a unique non-natural referent.  Otherwise, it will be possible for there to be other communities to use apparently normative predicates to refer to different non-natural properties.  This constraint is very far from trivial to satisfy; Eklund suggests that Wedgwood’s theory is unique in trying to meet it.  By contrast, a form of non-naturalism like the one defended by Cuneo and Shafer-Landau (Cuneo and Shafer Landau 2014) seems ill-suited to meeting this constraint.   On their view, the reference of moral terms and concepts is fixed, in part by more substantive “fixed points” which would seem to go beyond the mere normative role that Eklund has in mind.  Although Eklund admits the worry he has is in some ways ineffable, it seems like there ought to be some way in which the properties picked out by our normative predicates are the “right” ones to care about.  The reason Eklund’s worry is perhaps ineffable is that we presumably must index “right” in “right ones to care about” either to what we mean by “right” or by what some deviant possible community means by “right,” but neither seems to capture the intended worry.  Eklund notes the obvious analogies with the “Moral Twin Earth” objection to naturalism.  \n\nDeveloping a plausible epistemology (intuitionist or otherwise) is\nalso essential to meet some of the most pressing objections to\nnon-naturalism. One such objection begins with the premise that\nnon-natural properties do not figure in the best explanations of our\nexperiences and observations. Gilbert Harman famously argues that prima\nfacie there is a sharp contrast between moral beliefs and scientific\nbeliefs on this score. The best explanation of scientific beliefs often\nseems to entail the truth of those beliefs—Harman gives the example\nof a scientist’s belief that a proton is in a cloud chamber which seems\nto be best explained, in part, by the actual presence of a proton in\nthe chamber. By contrast, this does not seem to be true of our moral\nbeliefs. Rather, people’s moral beliefs can be explained more elegantly\nand plausibly in terms of their upbringing and psychology without\nreference to any mysterious non-natural moral properties. This\ncontrast, combined with the epistemological principle that we should\nbelieve in a property only if it figures in the best explanations of\nour experiences entails that non-naturalism should be rejected. Indeed,\nHarman’s argument would, if sound, also apply to anti-reductionist\nforms of naturalism. However, the anti-reductionist naturalist can try\nto avoid this line of argument by maintaining that the natural\nproperties constituting moral properties do figure in the best\nexplanations of our experiences. Nicholas Sturgeon, for example, argues\nthat reference to the moral property of being oppressive figures in the\nbest explanation of the growth of the anti-slavery movement in the\nUnited States between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War (see\nSturgeon 1988: 245; see also Railton 1986), and this is but one of a range of examples\ndiscussed by Sturgeon (for a reply, see Blackburn 1990). However, this\nstrategy is unavailable to the non-naturalist on many interpretations\nof what it is for a property to be a non-natural one. For example, if\nit is part of the definition of non-natural properties that they are\nnot invoked in scientific explanations then this defense is\nunavailable. However, on some interpretations of non-naturalism this\nmove is available. If, for example, non-natural properties are simply\nunderstood as properties that do not figure in similarity relations\nthen the non-naturalist might argue that often the best explanation of\nour moral judgements actually does advert to moral properties.\nIntuitionism and its plausibility are likely to be relevant here. The\nnon-naturalist might argue that people’s clear and distinct experiences\nof moral properties can be explained only as hallucinations of some\nkind in a naturalistic framework, and that this does not do justice to\nthe clarity and ubiquity of such perceptions. \n\nAlternatively, the non-naturalist might point out that the charge of\nexplanatory impotence itself must refer to evaluative properties (see\nSayre-McCord 1988b). For the naturalist’s objection must be that the\nbest explanation of our experiences does not presuppose the\nexistence of moral properties of the sort the non-naturalist has in\nmind. After all, if any old explanation you like would do then the\nnon-naturalist could no doubt provide some mediocre explanations of our\nexperiences that made reference to non-natural moral properties. Once\nthe naturalist allows that there are non-moral evaluative properties\nthat are relevant to the assessment of theories there is room for the\nnon-naturalist to argue that moral evaluative properties need not be\nall that different (metaphysically and epistemologically) and hence no\nmore problematic than the evaluative properties presupposed by the\nobjection. Moreover, this line of argument suggests that there is\nsomething self-defeating about the naturalist’s epistemological\nprinciple. It requires that we believe in properties only if they\nfigure in the best explanation of our experiences. However, it is not\nclear that the property of being a good explanation itself figures in\nthe best explanation of our experiences. In which case, the\nepistemological principle seems to recommend its own rejection. The\nproblem here is very similar to a problem facing verificationist\ntheories of meaning which seemed to entail their own meaninglessness.\nPresumably the naturalist’s best strategy is to argue that the values\nshe has in mind are purely naturalistic ones that we do have\nindependent reason to accept because they figure in the best\nexplanations of our experiences. Whether this strategy is plausible\nwill depend on the details of the naturalistic theory on offer.\n \n\nYet another reply to the objection is to argue that belief in moral\nproperties (or, more broadly, normative properties) construed in terms\nof non-naturalism, is indispensable to our deliberation.  The idea\nbehind this strategy is to argue that there is no reason we should\nprivilege explanatory indispensability over deliberative\nindispensability (see Enoch 2011). One worry about this strategy is\nthat it is not clear that it helps support belief in specifically\nmoral properties, but once we embrace non-naturalist realism about\nother normative properties there may be no further ontological costs\nto accepting the appearances about moral properties too.  Like all\ntranscendental arguments, this defense of non-naturalism is subject to\nworries about why the indispensability of some belief to our\ndeliberation speaks in favor of its truth.  Finally, it is not\nentirely clear why one must believe in normative properties as\nconstrued by non-naturalism in order to deliberate.  A lot of the work\nof this argument consists in debunking naturalist and expressivist\nconceptions of moral belief as inadequate for our deliberative\npurposes.  See both Enoch 2011 and Fitzpatrick 2011 for relevant\ndiscussion of this last point.   \n\nIt is often held that moral goodness has a kind of “magnetism.”\nIntuitively, the recognition of moral properties like goodness bears\nsome sort of intimate connection to motivation—not in the sense of\nbeing sufficiently motivated by such recognition that one actually does the relevant thing\nbut in the sense of being motivated to some degree to do it. The\ngeneral idea that there is some intimate connection between moral\njudgement and motivation is usually referred to as “judgement\ninternalism.” (see Darwall 1983: 54). It is not obvious how the\nnon-naturalist can explain how the recognition of moral properties can\nmotivate. Mackie famously argues that the defender of objective values\nmust implausibly maintain that moral properties have a kind of special\ncausal power to motivate people simply in virtue of their recognition\nof them. He argues that the recognition of moral properties must have a\nsort of direct influence on the will so that anyone who recognizes them\nis thereby motivated. Since a property with this sort of causal power\nwould be unlike anything else with which we are familiar and fits\npoorly into our scientific conception of the world, Mackie argues that\nwe should not believe in such properties. Mackie’s official target is\nthe thesis that moral properties are objective, but it is clear from\nhis discussion that non-naturalist interpretations of moral properties\nare supposed to be especially vulnerable to his line of argument.\nIndeed, Mackie’s argument seems to have two stages. First, he in effect\nargues that any plausible interpretation of our pre-theoretical beliefs\nabout morality will presuppose non-naturalism. Second, he argues that\nnon-naturalism is itself untenable.  The non-naturalist has a number of possible replies to Mackie’s\nobjection. First, the non-naturalist might simply deny that moral\nproperties are motivating in Mackie’s sense. Mackie’s argument seems\nto “load up” the concept of a moral property with a lot of\nbaggage that the non-naturalist need not accept. After all, some\npeople seem to make perfectly sound moral judgements but remain\nunmoved to action by them.  Some people care about morality and other\npeople do not; one need not ascribe any mysterious motivational power\nto moral properties to explain why moral properties motivate when they\ndo (see, e.g., Savavarsdottir 1999). This reply is fair enough so far\nas Mackie’s initial challenge goes, but it does suggest another\nrelated problem. For now we need some account of why some people care\nabout morality and other people do not, since it is clear enough that\nthis depends in some way on the person’s environment and\nconstitution. The non-naturalist may well be able to give such an\naccount but neither will this be a trivial task. \n\nSecond, the non-naturalist might argue that the motivating power of\nmoral judgements is a trifling semantic truth rather than a deep\nmetaphysical one. On this account, moral judgements are individuated\nnot just in terms of their content but in terms of the motivations of\nthe person making the judgement (see Tresan 2006, though he develops this approach on behalf of naturalism). So on this account someone who\nrecognizes the property of goodness but is completely unmoved by it\ndoes not thereby have a moral belief. Only when the person has the\nappropriate motivations does the belief count as moral. It is unclear,\nhowever, whether this account adequately meets the objection insofar\nas it leaves it a mystery why we should individuate moral beliefs in\njust this way. Intuitively, it is something about the special nature\nof the content of moral judgement that explains why they are\naction-guiding, but on this account the content need not play any role\nwhatsoever in the explanation. \n\nA third reply to Mackie is similar to the second one but tries to\nimprove on it by offering an explanation of the relationship between\nthe content of a moral judgement and the appropriate motivation. The\ngeneral idea is that moral properties can be recognized only by someone\nwith certain motivations. It might be held that one cannot recognize\nsomething as cruel, for example, unless one disapproves of it (at least\na little bit) and that cruelty is a non-natural moral property. This\nproposal differs from the second one in that it holds that moral\njudgements are individuated entirely in terms of their content and not\neven partly in terms of their motivational context. It just claims that\njudgements with certain contents cannot be made without certain\nmotivational states (see, e.g., McDowell 1998). Whereas the second\nsuggestion was semantic (“motivation on the cheap,” one might say),\nthis reply is in part metaphysical and requires substantial work in the\nphilosophy of mind. In adopting this strategy, the non-naturalist takes\non the burden of explaining why judgements with a distinctively moral\ncontent require appropriate motivations and this is likely to be no\neasy task. Cruelty, for example, presumably is a moral concept but\nintuitively someone can believe that an action would be cruel and\nsimply not give a damn. Indeed, intuitively it seems possible for\nsomeone to take the cruelty of an action to be an attractive feature or\na reason to perform the action—schoolyard bullies nicely illustrate\nthis possibility (a similar point is made in Blackburn 1998: 100) . Nor\ndoes the thesis that cruelty is a non-natural property make the defense\nof this view in the philosophy of mind any easier. \n\nMackie’s objection relies on the highly controversial premise that\nmoral judgements necessarily are motivating and as we have seen the\nnon-naturalist might reasonably just deny that premise (that was the\nfirst of the three replies discussed above). However, one might instead\nappeal to the much more modest premise that if an agent judges that\nsome possible action of hers is morally required then she will be\nmotivated to perform that action unless she is practically\nirrational. Michael Smith refers to this as the “practicality\nrequirement on moral judgement” (see Smith 1994: 61). This requirement\nseems plausible because the recognition that an action is right\nplausibly is the recognition that the action is well-supported (perhaps\nconclusively supported) by justifying moral reasons for action, and\nsuch a recognition should motivate someone unless the agent is\npractically irrational. For present purposes, the point is that even if\nMackie’s challenge can be bypassed or met in one of the three ways just\ndiscussed, a further challenge concerning motivation still faces the\nnon-naturalist. For if the practicality requirement on moral judgement\nis correct then the non-naturalist needs to provide some account of why\nan agent’s recognition that one of the actions available to her has the\nnon-natural property of rightness is such that her recognition of this\nfact rationally requires that she be motivated to perform the\naction.  In particular, some account of why judging that something is well supported by reasons (understood in non-naturalist terms) is appropriately connected to motivation. \n\nIf either of the last two replies to Mackie’s objection works then\nit can be redeployed against this objection. For if either of those\nreplies works then the non-naturalist can explain why the relevant\nmoral judgements necessarily are motivating, which trivially entails\nthat anyone who makes the relevant moral judgements either is\nappropriately motivated or is practically irrational. If, for example,\nit is an analytic truth that a judgment does not count as moral unless\nit is appropriately motivating then it trivially follows that anyone\nwho accepts a moral judgment is appropriately motivated or is\npractically irrational simply because it follows that anyone who\naccepts such a judgment is appropriately motivated. However, these\nstrategies are problematic in part for just the reason that Mackie’s\nversion of internalism is problematic—both seem to make a certain\nkind of practical irrationality impossible by asserting that making a\nmoral judgment guarantees appropriate motivation. In particular, it\nseems possible, though irrational, for an agent to judge that he is\nrequired to do something and yet not be motivated at all to do it. So\nperhaps non-naturalists should instead either try to accommodate\nSmith’s practicality requirement on moral judgement without committing\nthemselves to a form of judgement internalism as strong as the one\nMackie seemed to have in mind or argue against the practicality\nrequirement. Of course, if Smith’s practicality requirement on moral\njudgement is sound then accommodating it is a challenge faced by every\nmeta-ethical theory, but consideration of how the requirement might be\naccommodated suggests that the problem is especially pronounced for the\nnon-naturalist. \n\nThe non-naturalist could simply deny the practicality requirement on\nmoral judgement (this would be similar to the first reply to Mackie’s\nobjection). This is considerably more controversial than denying the\nvery strong link between motivation and moral judgement presupposed by\nMackie’s objection, but may nonetheless be defensible. The idea would\nbe that an agent can judge that she is morally required to do something\nand not be motivated accordingly without being guilty of any kind of\nirrationality. One might hold this on the grounds that the belief that\none is morally required to do something does not commit one to the\nbelief that there is conclusive reason to do it or on the grounds that\nthe belief that there is conclusive reason for one to do something\nsimply does not commit one to being motivated to do it on pain of\nirrationality. Unfortunately, a full discussion of the issues\nsurrounding the truth of the practicality requirement on moral\njudgement goes beyond the present scope. For useful discussion, see\nBrink 1986, Foot 1972 and Smith 1994. \n\nAlternatively, the non-naturalist might maintain that the\npracticality requirement on motivation is a trifling semantic truth.\nThe idea would be that to be fully rational in part just means\ndoing what one believes to be right. However, this move differs from\nthe second reply considered above in that it is a clear attempt to\ndefine a normative notion (rationality) in purely naturalistic terms.\nThis last claim assumes we can give a naturalistic account of\nrationality, which is not obviously correct given non-naturalism about\nrightness, but neither is it obviously incorrect. In any event, such an\nanalysis of rationality sits poorly with the non-naturalist’s standard\nappeal to the Open Question Argument. For if the Open Question Argument\nis sound for moral predicates like ‘morally required’ then\none might have thought that analogous arguments would go through for\n‘rational’ and ‘irrational’. After all,\nrationality is plausibly a normative notion and on some accounts (see above) it is the idea of\nnormativity that gives the Open Question Argument its force. This is\none reason the practicality requirement on moral judgement is\nespecially a problem for non-naturalists, since naturalists are not\ncommitted to accepting the soundness of the Open Question Argument in\nthe moral case. \n\nFinally, a more recent reply to such objections form motivation is that they misunderstand the role of the relevant non-natural properties in the motivational economy of a virtuous agent.  On this view (defended in Chappell 2019), the virtuous agent is not motivated by some simple non-natural property like goodness.  That, on this view, would be a sort of fetishism.  Rather, the virtuous agent is motivated by the purely natural facts that make the action morally right, e.g. that it spares someone emotional distress.  The role of the relevant non-natural property, here the property of being a reason for a given action, is to mark  the relevant properties as the ones it is correct to be motivated by.  One reply to this argument is suggested by Max Hayward (Hayward 2019). Hayward argues that our commitment to e.g. the value of our partner should not be conditional on the existence and distribution of non-natural properties.  Yet non-naturalist moral realism is committed to the view that all value is contingent on the existence of such properties.  Transposed to Chappell’s emphasis on normative properties as markers of our reasons, Hayward’s argument would imply the correctness of treating the relevant facts as reasons should not depend on the sort of obscure metaphysics posited by non-naturalist moral realists. \n\nNon-naturalism has trouble explaining the necessary dependence of\nthe moral facts on the natural facts. So long as our characterization\nof natural properties is broad enough to include both all of the mental\nproperties and all of the properties that would figure in the best\nphysical theory, it is very plausible to suppose that the moral\nsupervenes on the natural in the following sense: there can be no moral\ndifference between two situations or entire possible worlds without\nsome natural difference but not vice-versa (there can be non-moral\ndifferences without moral differences). On some ways of understanding\nthe natural properties, of course, it is unclear whether mental\nproperties are natural ones and this is an important point. Perhaps\nmental properties elude scientific investigation but are real\nnonetheless. If we characterize the non-natural properties as ones that\nelude scientific investigation then mental properties will be\nnon-natural ones. This is very important since it is not nearly so\nplausible that the moral supervenes on a set of facts that does not\ninclude the mental facts—as if the wrongness of an action could\nfloat independently of facts about pain, intentions and beliefs. For\npurposes of the present discussion I shall simply assume that the\nnatural properties include the mental properties. \n\nHowever, suitably formulated theses concerning the supervenience of\nthe moral on the natural are plausible enough that some philosophers\nhave held them to be analytic. Global supervenience theses are perhaps\nthe most plausible ones, claiming merely that two entire possible\nworlds cannot differ only in their moral properties without\nalso differing in some of their natural properties. To deny this thesis\nwould be to allow that it could have been the case that the world was\nexactly like the actual world in all of its naturalistic\nfeatures but in that world what Hitler did was not wrong. Since all the\nnatural facts are the same in this possible world it will still be true\nthat Hitler killed the same people, had the same intentions, etc. Such\nbare moral differences seem inconceivable. Very plausibly, the moral\nfacts are in some way entirely fixed by the natural facts. The problem\nfor the non-naturalist is that non-naturalism seems unable to explain\nthis supervenience. For if moral properties and natural properties\nreally are, in Hume’s terms, “distinct existences” then it is hard to\nsee why it should be impossible for the former to differ with no\ndifference in the latter and since the natural properties are non-moral\nones (given non-naturalism) this makes supervenience seem problematic.\nNon-naturalism’s apparent inability to explain such a basic platitude\nas global supervenience poses a serious problem (see Mackie 1977,\nBlackburn 1984, and Blackburn 1988). \n\nNaturalists of course can explain supervenience much more easily.\nFor given naturalism, the moral properties just are certain\nnatural properties, and the supervenience of the moral follows\ntrivially from this (every property supervenes on itself). It is much\nless obvious, however, that the naturalist can explain a slightly\ndifferent supervenience thesis. For it seems at least as plausible to\nsuppose that the moral properties supervene on the non-moral ones as it\nis to suppose that they supervene on the natural properties. Indeed,\nthe moral/non-moral supervenience thesis is probably more obviously\ncorrect than moral/natural supervenience theses because of the\nobscurity of the natural/non-natural distinction. Once we divide the\nnatural properties into the moral and the non-moral, it becomes unclear\nwhy the moral properties should supervene on all the other\nnatural properties (the non-moral ones). Perhaps the naturalist’s\ndialectical advantage is more modest than one would have thought. For\nif neither naturalists nor non-naturalists can explain the\nsupervenience of the moral on the non-moral and if that supervenience\nthesis is less controversial than moral/natural supervenience theses\nthen the fact that the naturalist can explain the latter looks less\nimpressive.  Perhaps non-cognitivists (or “quasi-realists,” in\nBlackburn’s favored terminology; see Blackburn 1984) and error\ntheorists reap the greatest dialectical dividends from reflection on\nhow we might explain supervenience. The standard view is that the\nnon-cognitivist’s explanatory task differs from the explanatory task\nfacing both naturalist and non-naturalist forms of cognitivism.\nWhereas the naturalist and non-naturalist must explain a metaphysical\nrelationship between two potentially distinct sets of properties the\nnon-cognitivist instead needs only to explain the sensibility of a\npractice of moralizing governed by a supervenience constraint. Since\none of the main points of moral discourse is to recommend options on\nthe basis of their natural properties it is easy enough to see why\nsuch a constraint is sensible. To abandon that constraint would be to\nabandon the project of moralizing so understood. For if our practice\nof moralizing were not to include such a constraint then you could\nevaluate options differently even if they were identical in all their\nnatural properties and this would make it hard to see in what sense\noptions were being recommended on the basis of their natural\nproperties. Since for the non-cognitivist there are no moral\nproperties (from the perspective of serious metaphysics, anyway; but\nwe can still “speak with the vulgar” as if there were such\nproperties) we can in the same way derive that our moralizing must not\nallow that two items identical in their non-moral properties might\nstill differ morally. For the point of moralizing is to recommend\noptions on the basis of their natural properties and all the natural\nproperties are non-moral according to the non-cognitivist.  One worry\nabout this line of argument is that quasi-realist expressivism, if\nsuccessful, allows us to make all of the original and seemingly\nmetaphysically problematic claims about moral reality in the only\nsense in which those claims can be understood.  In that case, it\nis not entirely obvious why the quasi-realist does not, at the end of\nthe day, face exactly the same explanatory burden as the\nnon-naturalist realist (see Street 2011).  Perhaps quasi-realists can\navoid this specific worry about self-defeat by holding that moral\nproperties are, after all, natural properties on their view.  The view\ncan remain expressivist so long as it also maintains that taking a\nview about just which natural property is identical to a given moral\nproperty is constituted by adopting suitable non-cognitive\nattitudes. \n\nLike the non-cognitivist, the error theorist denies that there any\nmoral properties, but unlike the non-cognitivist maintains that the\nlegitimacy of moral discourse presupposes that there are such\nproperties. This trivially entails that whenever there is a moral\ndifference there must be some non-moral difference for the simple\nreason that there never can be any moral differences between cases\ngiven the error theory. Typically, the error theorist agrees with the\nnon-naturalist (implicitly, anyway) about the semantics of moral\npredicates but holds that moral predicates do not refer precisely\nbecause moral properties to which they purport to refer would have to\nbe so queer (see Mackie 1977). One aspect of the putative queerness of\nmoral properties is the idea that they necessarily supervene on the\nnatural (and non-moral) properties without being reducible to those\nproperties. \n\nHow might non-naturalists respond to the charge that they cannot\nexplain supervenience? They might argue that the objection must be\nunsound because it would prove too much. For the form of the argument\nseems to generalize into an argument that no class of properties can\nsupervene on another class of properties unless the former are\nreducible to the latter in some way. It might seem in some of the cases\nnot involving moral properties that this cannot be correct. The\nsupervenience of the property of being a chair on all of the properties\nof microphysics seems unlikely to be explained in some reductive way\nbut seems obviously correct nonetheless. Non-naturalist’s critics can\neither accept this implication of their argument but try to argue that\nit is not so implausible or try to block the implication in some way. A\ndiscussion of the former strategy raises very general questions that go\nwell beyond the scope of the present article. So I shall here focus on\nthe question of whether the moral case is in some way unique even\nthough the more promising strategy here might be to argue that in these\nother cases some sort of reductive (albeit perhaps non-analytic)\naccount is available after all. \n\nArguably the moral case is different from these other cases of\nsupervenience without reduction because the supervenience of the moral\non the natural (and non-moral) is analytic. Plausibly, someone who\nthinks two things could differ morally but be identical in all other\nrespects does not fully grasp the meanings of moral predicates. This is\nnot nearly so plausible in other cases in which we seem to have\nsupervenience without reduction. Cartesian dualists can deny\nsupervenience and their view does not seem conceptually incoherent\nhowever mistaken it may be. As Blackburn argues, if this sort of error\nis a conceptual one then “whole cultures have been prone to denial of\nan analytic truth” (Blackburn 1985: 59) which at best seems unlikely.\nThe idea here seems to be that the only way a realist could explain\nsupervenience qua analytic truth would be to hold that the moral is\nanalytically identical to some property that can also be characterized\nin purely naturalistic terms. The non-naturalist, of course, is\ncommitted to rejecting any such analyses so if this is the only way to\nexplain the analyticity of supervenience then non-naturalists cannot\nexplain it. In which case, the appeal to analyticity might seem to\nblock the ‘proves too much objection’. \n\nHowever, this would be too quick. Blackburn’s appeal to the\nanalyticity of supervenience in the moral case notwithstanding, the\n‘proves to much’ objection can be reinstated against Blackburn’s\noriginal argument that non-naturalists (and moral realists more\ngenerally) cannot explain supervenience. For the non-naturalist might\ninstead hold that the analyticity of supervenience simply falls out of\nthe conventions governing our use of moral vocabulary. It is simply an\nempirical fact that those we take to be competent users of moral\nlanguage do respect supervenience constraints and would think anyone\nwho did not respect those constraints must be conceptually confused. As\nThomas Baldwin argues, “The realist can maintain that it is a\nconceptual truth that there are necessary connections between the\nethical and the non-ethical, even though the particular connections\nthemselves are not analytically necessary.” (Baldwin 1990: 99) In which\ncase, the appeal to analyticity seems not to help block the objection\nthat the argument from supervenience proves too much. One might\nbuttress this defense of non-naturalism by pointing out that it does\nseem analytic that moral properties are “resultant” ones in Jonathan\nDancy’s sense—the instantiation of a moral property must always be\nexplained by the instantiation of certain particular non-moral\nproperties. \n\nNonetheless, Baldwin is mistaken to suppose that this entirely\ndisarms the argument from supervenience. Baldwin might well show that\nBlackburn cannot escape the charge of proving too much simply by\nappealing to the thesis that supervenience in the moral case is a\npriori. Showing that Blackburn’s move does not explain why the argument\nwould not prove too much still does not provide a satisfactory defense\nof non-naturalism, though. For if the non-naturalist simply appeals to\nconventional and linguistic facts then they might well explain why it\nis analytic that if there are any moral properties then they\nmust supervene on the natural (and non-moral) ones. The original\nobjection, though, was a metaphysical one rather than a semantic one.\nThe problem for the non-naturalist now becomes one of explaining how\nthe non-natural properties in question could satisfy the relevant\nsupervenience constraints and hence count as moral in the first place.\nThe challenge is to provide a metaphysical account of how there could\nbe properties like the properties to which the non-naturalist maintains\nour moral vocabulary purports to refer. Otherwise we are left either\nwith the error-theoretic conclusion that there are no moral properties\nor the non-cognitivist conclusion that moral vocabulary does not even\npurport to refer (in the sense of ‘refer’ in play when one\ndoes serious metaphysics, anyway; again, the non-cognitivist will allow\nthat we can ‘speak with the vulgar’ here). So there is\nstill a problem for the non-naturalist. Nonetheless, Baldwin seems\nright in that the appeal to analyticity seems not to have done the work\nfor which it was invoked by Blackburn. For it again seems as if the\nargument from supervenience generalizes to other cases of supervenience\nwithout reduction. Perhaps the non-naturalist’s critics should simply\nembrace this implication but argue that the prospects for reduction in\nthese other cases are much brighter than the non-naturalist suggests\nthey are. \n\nA more promising approach for the non-naturalist would be to offer a\npositive explanation of supervenience in explicitly non-naturalist\nterms.  In his systematic defence of non-naturalist moral realism,\nRuss Shafer-Landau takes just this strategy.  There he argues that\nalthough each moral property is distinct from any natural property or\nproperties, still each instantiation of a moral property is fully\nconstituted (or, as he sometimes puts it, ‘realized’) by some\nconcatenation of natural properties (see Shafer-Landau 2003: 76–78).\nIn effect, the idea is to distinguish types from tokens, and argue\nthat the constitution of every token moral property by some\nconcatenation of natural properties is consistent with the\nnon-identity of that moral property with any natural property or\ncombination of natural properties.  Shafer-Landau suggests that this\nstrategy is the most plausible one for explaining supervenience\nwithout reduction in the philosophy of mind, and that this should make\nus optimistic about the prospects of an analogous strategy in the\nmoral case. \n\nAs I have argued elsewhere, it is not at all clear that the appeal to\ntoken constitution can do the needed work.  Moreover, even if this\nappeal could somehow explain supervenience, it would have further\nunfortunate consequences for the non-naturalist.  Since I have\ndiscussed these objections at length elsewhere (Ridge 2007), I shall\nbe brief here and simply summarize the main worries.  First,\nShafer-Landau’s constitution thesis by itself does not entail\nsupervenience.  A full explanation of supervenience will require some\nauxiliary premises, and Shafer-Landau does not tell us what these\npremises are.  Fortunately, his appeal to an analogy with the\nphilosophy of mind helps us fill in the blanks.  For the closest\nanalogue there seems to be David Robb’s attempt to explain\nsupervenience without reduction in the philosophy of mind in terms of\ntropes, where tropes just are property instantiations.  Trying to\ncarry out the Robb strategy (which I shall not try to summarize here;\nfor details, see Robb 1997), the needed premise for Shafer-Landau would\nseem to be that if a given natural trope constitutes a moral trope,\nthen it necessarily constitutes that trope.  This, plus\nShafer-Landau’s thesis that necessarily, every moral trope is fully\nconstituted by some set of natural tropes, would indeed entail\nsupervenience, so this does seem like an interesting way to fill out\nthe details of his strategy. \n\nWhy, though, should we suppose that this necessitation thesis (that if\none trope is fully constituted by another trope, then it necessarily\nis) is true?  Robb’s own thesis was actually about trope identity\nrather than trope constitution, and this gives Robb’s thesis more\nimmediate plausibility, as identity does seem to be necessary.\nShafer-Landau, however, wants to appeal to constitution rather than\nidentity (this is a departure from Robb), and this makes it very\nunclear why we should accept the analogous necessitation thesis. \n\nA second possible worry about Shafer-Landau’s strategy is that it does\nrely on a metaphysics which quantifies over tropes (Shafer-Landau\nprefers to speak of ‘property instantiations’ but this is\nreally a merely nominal difference).  This is itself a controversial\nmetaphysical commitment.  Moreover, Shafer-Landau seems committed to\nmeta-tropes—tropes of tropes.  For he needs this thesis to explain\nhow a fact (which for Shafer-Landau just is a property instantiation)\ncan itself have the property of being a reason.  While this is of\ncourse a metaphysical commitment that can perhaps be defended, it does\ngive some dialectical hostages to fortune. \n\nThird, Shafer-Landau’s approach seems to have the very odd consequence\nthat certain forms of first-order monism are ruled out.  Shafer-Landau\nhimself explicitly claims that his theory can be neutral on this\nfront, and it would be unfortunate if his theory did have such\nstriking implications for first-order theory.  Why do I say that\nShafer-Landau’s theory seems to lead very quickly to the rejection of\ncertain forms of monism?  Because on a standard view of tropes, a\nproperty (that is, a type) just is a resembling set of tropes.  In\nthis context, whether a given property is moral or natural will depend\nupon whether the relevant sort of resemblance is one which is\nespecially salient from the point of view of moral theory, on the one\nhand, or from the point of view of one of the natural sciences.  It\ncould be relevant from the point of view of both such perspectives,\nbut this would be for naturalism to be true, which, of course, is\ninconsistent with non-naturalism!  The main point is that for any\nnaturalist view which holds that something is good if and only if it\ninstantiates some particular single natural property (pleasantness,\nsay), it would follow that the relevant sort of resemblance would be\nsalient from the perspective of one of the natural sciences.  For all\npleasantness tropes do resemble one another in a way which would be\nsalient from the point of view of psychology (or possibly\nbiology)—or at least, insofar as pleasantness is a natural\nproperty this is likely to be so.  In which case, a standard view of\ntropes would entail that the property itself is a natural one.  In\nwhich case, we would have a form of reductive naturalism.  So for this\nstrategy to work, it seems that any form of first-order monism which\nholds that things are good if and only if they instantiate some single\nnatural property, must be rejected.  Otherwise we end up with a form\nof naturalism, rather than non-naturalism.  Insofar as the\nnon-naturalist (quite rightly) aspires to remain neutral on such\nfirst-order questions, this is a theoretical vice of the proposed\nexplanation. \n\nObviously there is a lot more that can be said by both parties to this\ndebate.  For example, for useful more recent discussion of the more\ngeneral issue of whether there can be necessary connections between\ndistinct existences, see Wilson 2010.  In any event, it is good that\nnon-naturalists in moral philosophy are not merely relying on the\nappeal to companions in guilt, but are also actually offering positive\nexplanations of supervenience.  Shafer-Landau offers an ambitious\nexplanation of supervenience in non-naturalist terms.  Even if his\ninitial strategy fails for some of the reasons discussed above, it at\nleast is a step in the right direction, and it might be possible to\nrefine his strategy in a way to avoid some or all of the worries\nraised above.  It is early days for this approach to supervenience in\nthe case of moral philosophy, and it will be interesting to see how\nthis debate plays out.  For further discussion of Shafer-Landau’s\nstrategy here, see also Mabrito 2005, Shafer-Landau 2005, Wedgwood\n2009 and McPherson 2012. Useful discussion can also be found in Dreier 2019, Gert 2019, and Moberger 2019.  \n\nThe debate over non-naturalism is difficult to resolve in part\nbecause the issues often hinge on fundamentally different\nmethodological starting points. Advocates of non-naturalism tend to be\nless concerned with finding a place for value and obligation in the\nworld as revealed by science and more interested in taking our common\nsense conception of morality as given and seeing what it implicitly\npresupposes. Non-naturalism’s opponents, by contrast, put a great deal\nof weight on explaining our moral practices in a way that fits well\nwith a properly scientific view of the world and are happy to reject\nthe presuppositions of common sense if they conflict with that\nconception. So non-naturalists tend to be more interested than their\nopponents in respecting our pre-theoretical intuitions about morality\nand moral judgement. Hence non-naturalists often give substantial\nweight to the intuitive force of the Open Question Argument. They also\nare less willing to revise common-sense moral beliefs about particular\ncases for the sake of aligning those beliefs with some ambitious\nnaturalistic moral theory. It is no coincidence that so-called moral\nparticularists, who deny that morality can adequately be captured by\nany set of principles linking natural features to moral ones, tend to\nfavor some form of non-naturalism. Naturalists, by contrast, are more\nlikely to emphasize the importance of rejecting beliefs that fit poorly\nwith our best scientific account of reality; if common sense commits us\nto properties that do not fit well into that account then so much the\nworse for common sense. Given these deep methodological differences,\nthe only apparent way avoid philosophical stalemate would be to develop\nan argument for one of the two positions whose plausibility does not\ndepend on the controversial methodological assumptions associated with\nthat position. The best candidate for such an argument considered here\nmight well be the argument that non-naturalists cannot explain\nsupervenience. For the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral\nseems to fall out of common sense rather than out of our scientific\nworld-view. Since the methodology associated with non-naturalism itself\nputs great weight on common sense, the argument from supervenience\nseems like a promising one. At the very least, the argument from\nsupervenience seems uniquely well situated to undermine non-naturalism\nwithout begging any central methodological questions.","contact.mail":"mridge@staffmail.ed.ac.uk","contact.domain":"staffmail.ed.ac.uk"}]
