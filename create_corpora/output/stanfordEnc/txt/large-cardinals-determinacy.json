This is true\nof statements from areas as diverse as analysis (“Are all\nprojective sets Lebesgue measurable?”), cardinal arithmetic\n(“Does Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis (CH) hold?”),\ncombinatorics (“Does Suslin's Hypotheses hold?”), and\ngroup theory (“Is there a Whitehead group?”). \n\n\n These developments gave rise to two conflicting positions. The\nfirst position—which we shall\ncall pluralism—maintains that the independence results\nlargely undermine the enterprise of set theory as an objective\nenterprise. On this view, although there are practical\nreasons that one might give in favour of one set of axioms over\nanother—say, that it is more useful for a given task—,\nthere are no theoretical reasons that can be given; and,\nmoreover, this either implies or is a consequence of the\nfact—depending on the variant of the view, in particular,\nwhether it places realism before reason, or conversely—that\nthere is no objective mathematical realm at this level. The second\nposition—which we shall\ncall non-pluralism—maintains that the independence\nresults merely indicate the paucity of our standard resources for\njustifying mathematical statements. On this view, theoretical\nreasons can be given for new axioms and—again,\ndepending on the variant of the view—this either implies or is a\nconsequence of the fact that there is an objective mathematical realm\nat this level. \n\n\n The theoretical reasons for new axioms that the non-pluralist\ngives are quite different that the theoretical reasons that are\ncustomarily at play in mathematics, in part because, having stepped\ninto the realm of independence, a more subtle form of justification is\nrequired, one that relies more heavily on sophisticated mathematical\nmachinery. The dispute between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is\nthus one that lies at the intersection of philosophy and\nmathematics—on the one hand, it is intimately connected with\nsome of the central questions of philosophy of mathematics, such as\nthe question of realism and the nature of justification; on the other\nhand, it addresses these questions in a manner that is sensitive to a\ngreat deal of sophisticated mathematics. \n\n\n The debate between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is really a\nhierarchy of debates. At the one extreme there is pluralism with\nregard to all of mathematics and at the other extreme there\nis non-pluralism with regard to all of mathematics. The\nintermediate positions (which are much more common) involve embracing\nnon-pluralism for certain domains (say first-order arithmetic), while\nadvocating pluralism with regard to others (say those where the notion\nof the full powerset enters the picture). Fortunately, the\nmathematical systems that arise in practice can be arranged in a\nwell-founded hierarchy—ranging from weak systems like Robinson's\narithmetic Q, up through Peano arithmetic PA, the subsystems of\nsecond-order arithmetic, the subsystems of set theory, and the\nhierarchy of large cardinal axioms. One can thus arrange the hybrid\nnon-pluralist/pluralist positions and the corresponding debates in a\nwell-founded hierarchy, where along the way one embraces more and more\nnon-pluralism. The challenge for those with non-pluralist tendencies\nis to make the case that non-pluralism extends further and further\ninto the upper reaches of higher mathematics. The challenge for those\nwith pluralist tendencies is to draw the line in a principled manner\nand make the case that no argument for non-pluralism will succeed for\nthe domains of mathematics beyond that line. \n\n\n It is sensible to approach the search for new axioms and the\nquestion of pluralism in a stepwise fashion, seeking first axioms that\nresolve certain low-level questions and making the case for\nnon-pluralism at that level, and then proceeding upward to questions\nof greater complexity and the question of pluralism at higher\nlevels. The present entry focuses on this debate as it takes place in\nthe setting of classical descriptive set theory. There are\nthree reasons for this choice. First, a popular view embraces\nnon-pluralism for first-order arithmetic but rejects the search for\nnew axioms for full second-order arithmetic and set theory and\nembraces pluralism at these \n levels.[1] \n The questions of descriptive set theory are\nimportant in this connection since many of them are statements of\nsecond-order arithmetic which are independent of the standard axioms,\nZFC. It thus represents a critical juncture in the debate between the\npluralist and non-pluralist. Second, here the mathematical landscape\nwith regard to the implications of new axioms has largely stabilized\nand we now have the resources required to address the issue between\nthe pluralist and the non-pluralist. (In the case of questions of\nthird- and higher-order arithmetic the matter still awaits further\nmathematical developments. That topic is treated in the entry\n “The Continuum Hypothesis”.)  \nFinally, the case for new axioms at this level involves so-called\n“extrinsic justifications” (something we shall describe\nbelow) and, moreover, provides the strongest current example of such\njustifications. \n\n\n Here is an overview of the present\nentry: Section 1 provides further philosophical\nmotivation and sharpens the question of pluralism by briefly\ndiscussing the interpretability hierarchy, the incompleteness\nphenomenon, and the nature of axioms.\n Section 2\n describes the central notions and results of classical\ndescriptive set theory along with the independence results concerning\nthe questions that remained open and were ultimately shown to be\nunresolvable on the basis of the standard axioms,\nZFC. Section 3 describes the two main\napproaches to new axioms—axioms of definable determinacy and\nlarge cardinal axioms—and discusses the implications of these\naxioms for the undecided questions of classical descriptive set\ntheory. Section 4 treats of the intimate\nrelationship between the two approaches and outlines the case that has\nbeen made for axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal\naxioms. Section 5 revisits the debate between\nthe pluralist and the non-pluralist in light of the foregoing\nmathematical developments. \n\n\nOne way to sharpen the question of pluralism involves appeal to the\ninterpretability hierarchy. In this section we will (1) introduce the\ninterpretability hierarchy, (2) briefly discuss the incompleteness\nphenomenon, (3) sharpen the question of pluralism, and (4) bring out\nthe philosophical issues involved by briefly discussing the nature of\naxioms and the nature of justification in mathematics.  \nSuppose T1 and T2 are\nrecursively enumerable axiom systems. We say that T1\nis interpretable in T2\n(T1 ≤ T2) when, roughly\nspeaking, there is a translation τ from the language\nof T1 to the language of T2 such\nthat, for each sentence ϕ of the language\nof T1, if T1 ⊢ ϕ\nthen T2 ⊢ τ(ϕ). We shall\nwrite T1 < T2\nwhen T1 ≤ T2\nand T2 ≰ T1 and we shall\nwrite T1 ≡ T2 when\nboth T1 ≤ T2\nand T2 ≤ T1. In the latter\ncase, T1 and T2 are said to\nbe mutually interpretable. The equivalence class of all\ntheories mutually interpretable with T is called\nthe interpretability degree\nof T. The interpretability hierarchy is the\ncollection of all theories ordered under the relation ≤.  \n There is a useful characterization of the relation ≤ that\napplies when it is restricted to the type of theories that we will be\nconsidering. To describe this we need a few more notions. A\ntheory T is reflexive provided it proves the\nconsistency of each of its finite fragments, it\nis Σ01-complete\nprovided it proves each\ntrue Σ01-statement,\nand it\nis Σ01-sound\nprovided it does not prove a\nfalse Σ01-statement. Let\n‘T1\n⊆Π01T2’\nbe shorthand for the statement that\nall Π01-sentences\nprovable in T1 are provable\nin T2. The following characterization of\ninterpretability is central to the theory of interpretability:\nIf T1 is reflexive\nand Σ01-complete,\nthen  \n This result is due to Orey and Hájek (for further details\nsee Theorem 6 on p. 103 of Lindström (2003) and Fact 3.2 of\nVisser (1998)). It follows from this result and the second\nincompleteness theorem that for any theory T meeting these two\nconditions, the theory T + Con(T) is strictly stronger\nthan T, that is, T < T +\nCon(T). Moreover, it follows from the arithmetized completeness\ntheorem that the T + ¬Con(T) is interpretable\nin T, hence, T ≡ T + ¬Con(T)\n(see Feferman 1960).  \n It turns out that the interpretability order is exceedingly\ncomplex. For example, through the uses of metamathematical coding\ntechniques, one can show that for any two\ntheories T1 and T2 such\nthat T1 < T2 there is a third\ntheory T such that T1 < T\n< T2. And for any theory T, one can show\nthat there are theories T1 and T2\nsuch that T1 > T and T2\n> T and yet neither T1\n≤ T2 nor T2\n≤ T1 (that is, T1\nand T2 are above T and are incomparable in\nthe interpretability order). Thus, the order on the degrees of\ninterpretability is neither well-founded nor linearly ordered.  \n Nevertheless, when one restricts to theories that “arise in\nnature” (that is, the kind of formal systems that one encounters\nin a mathematical text as opposed to examples of the type above, which\nare metamathematically manufactured by logicians to have the deviant\nproperties in question) the interpretability ordering is quite simple:\nThere are no descending chains and there are no incomparable\nelements. In other words, it is a well-ordering. This is quite\nremarkable: If one takes any two “natural\ntheories”—even from completely different domains, say one\nfrom analysis and another from combinatorics—then generally it\nturns out that one is interpretable in the other and that the two line\nup along a well-founded path through the interpretability\nhierarchy.  \n This well founded path through the interpretability hierarchy has\na canonical sequence through it which enables one to climb the\nhierarchy in a principled manner. At the base one has the very weak\ntheory Q and one climbs upward by adding “closure\nprinciples”. This starts with principles asserting that certain\nfast-growing functions—exponentiation, super-exponentiation,\netc.—are total and it proceeds upward through set existence\nprinciples, passing through the layers of second-order arithmetic, the\nsubsystems of set theory, and the hierarchy of large cardinal\naxioms.  \n Of particular interest with regard to the question of pluralism\nare those points along the well-founded sequence that correspond to\ncertain limitative conceptions of the nature of mathematics, such as\nthe degree marked by Q (Robinson Arithmetic,\nwhich corresponds to strict finitism\nin the sense articulated by Nelson), the degree marked by PRA (Primitive Recursive Arithmetic, which\ncorresponds to finitism in the sense articulated by Tait),\nand the degree marked by ATR0 (Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion, which corresponds\nto predicativism in the sense articulated by Feferman). In\neach case, one draws the line at a certain point in the hierarchy,\nmaintaining non-pluralism below and pluralism above.  Further Reading: For a more detailed account of the\ninterpretability hierarchy see the entry \n “Independence and Large Cardinals”. \n For even further detail see Lindström (2003) and Visser\n(1998).  \nWe noted above that the second incompleteness theorem provides us\nwith a case where the statement, namely, Con(T), leads to a\njump in the interpretability hierarchy while its negation does\nnot. There are also natural examples of this phenomenon—for\nexample, large cardinal axioms. When a statement ϕ is independent\nof a theory T in this manner—that is, in virtue of the\nfact that T < T + ϕ—we shall refer to the\nkind of independence involved as vertical independence. Thus,\nthe second incompleteness theorem demonstrated that Con(PA) is\nvertically independent of PA (assuming, of course, that PA is\nconsistent) and that the large cardinal axioms “There is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal” is vertically independent of ZFC\n(assuming that ZFC + “There is a strongly inaccessible\ncardinal” is consistent).  \n In contrast to vertical independence there is the kind of\nindependence that arises when a sentence ϕ is independent of a\ntheory T because  \n Such a sentence ϕ is called an Orey sentence with\nrespect to T. We shall refer to this kind of independence\nas horizontal independence. Using metamathematical techniques\none can construct such sentences. But again, as in the case of\nvertical independence, there are also natural non-metamathematical\nexamples—for example, PU (the statement that the projective sets\nhave the uniformization property, a property we shall discuss below)\nis a statement of (schematic) second-order arithmetic that is an Orey\nsentence with respect to ZFC, and CH is a statement of third-order\narithmetic that is an Orey sentence with respect to ZFC.  \nWith these pieces in place we can now begin to sharpen the question\nof pluralism.  \n As a first step we will restrict our attention to theories which\nare formulated in a common language and our language of choice will be\nthe language of set theory. The reason for restricting to a common\nlanguage is that otherwise there will be theories which are merely\nnotational variants of one another. And the reason for focusing on the\nlanguage of set theory is that it is a universal language in the sense\nthat any system of mathematics is mutually interpretable with a theory\nformulated in the language of set theory; for example, PA is mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC−Infinity. We are thus setting aside the\nquestion of pluralism as it might arise in a more metaphysical setting\nwhere one considers questions such as whether natural numbers are\n“really” sets or whether instead there are two distinct\ndomains of objects—natural numbers and the finite ordinals of\nset theory. Our focus is on the question of pluralism as it arises in\nresponse to the independence phenomenon and the issues at play in this\ndiscussion are invariant across different stances on the above\nmetaphysical question. With regard to our question there is no loss of\ngenerality in the restriction to the language of set theory since the\nproblem of finding new axioms for PA translates (through the natural\ninterpretation of number theory into set theory) into the problem of\nfinding new axioms for ZFC−Infinity, and\nconversely. Nevertheless, in what follows we shall, largely out of\nconvenience and familiarity, continue to speak of theories that are\nformulated in other languages—such as Q and PA—but the\nreader should always understand us to be strictly speaking of the\ncorresponding theory in the language of set theory.  \n The question of pluralism in its most general formulation is the\nquestion of whether there is a correct path through the hierarchy of\ninterpretability or whether instead a multitude of mutually\nincompatible theories must be admitted as equally legitimate from the\npoint of view of theoretical reason and mathematical truth. There are\nreally two problems that must be addressed. The first is the question\nof how far the hierarchy of interpretability extends, that is, which\ndegrees are non-trivial in that the theories within them are\nconsistent. This is the problem of consistency (or\nnon-triviality). The second is the question of whether, for a\ngiven (non-trivial) degree of interpretability, there are theoretical\nreasons that can be given for one theory over another. This is\nthe problem of selection. If one managed to solve both\nproblems—determining the extent of the non-trivial degrees and\nlocating the correct path through them—then one would have\ncompletely solved the problem of mathematical truth. There are,\nhowever, two important things to stress about this. First, because of\nthe incompleteness theorems, any such solution would have to be\n“schematic” concerning the first part (vertical\nindependence). Second, the solution to the full problem of selection\neven for the degree of ZFC is a very difficult one since it\ninvolves resolving CH and a multitude of other independent statements\nthat arise already at this level.  \n Because of the difficulty of the second problem it is useful to\nsplit it up into its own hierarchy by classifying statements in terms\nof their complexity. We shall discuss the hierarchy of statement\ncomplexity in more detail in the next section. But for the moment\nsuffice it to say that (roughly speaking) one starts with questions of\nsecond-order arithmetic (stratified according to their complexity) and\nthen one moves on to questions of third-order arithmetic (stratified\naccording to their complexity), and so on. Thus, one first tries to\nsolve the problem of selection at the level of, say, statements of\nsecond-order arithmetic and then one moves on to the problem of\nselection for statements of third-order arithmetic, and so on. The\nquestion of pluralism that we will be addressing is located in the\nhierarchy as follows: It takes a non-skeptical stance toward ZFC and\nseeks axioms that solve the problem of selection for the level of\nsecond-order arithmetic and somewhat\n beyond.[2] \n Let us now give some examples of the various\npluralist/non-pluralist positions. At one extreme there is radical\npluralism which maintains that all non-trivial theories in the\ninterpretability hierarchy are on a par and that there are no\ntheoretical reasons that one can give for any theory over\nanother. This form of pluralism is difficult to articulate since, for\nexample, assuming that Q is consistent the theory Q + ¬Con(Q) is\nconsistent. But it is hard to see how the pluralist can admit this\ntheory as a legitimate candidate since it contains a\nprinciple—namely, ¬Con(Q)—that is in conflict with the\nbackground assumption that the pluralist employs in arguing that the\ntheory is a legitimate candidate. For this reason most people are\nnon-pluralists about some domains but remain pluralists about\nothers.  \n The limitative views that we mentioned earlier—strict\nfinitism, finitism, and predicativism—are examples of such\nhybrid views. For example, strict finitists (on one construal) accept\nQ and certain theories that are mutually interpretable with Q, thereby\nadopting non-pluralism for this domain. In addition, the strict\nfinitist takes these theories to exhaust the domain of\nobjective mathematics and adopts a pluralist stance toward the\n remainder.[3] \n In a\nsimilar fashion, finitism and predicativism provide us with examples\nof hybrid non-pluralist/pluralist positions.  \n Predicativism is of particular interest for our present purposes\nsince it grants the frameworks of the natural numbers but rejects most\nof set theory and, in fact, most of second-order arithmetic. The\npredicativist is a non-pluralist about first-order arithmetic and\nthinks that there is an objective fact of the matter concerning every\nstatement formulated in the language of first-order arithmetic. And\nthe predicativist accepts as much of second-order arithmetic and set\ntheory that can be simulated in a theory such as ATR0 (Arithemetical Transfinite Recursion). But\nthe predicativist remains a pluralist about what lies above. The\npredicativist will often grant that there is utility in employing\naxiomatic systems of set theory but will maintain that the issue of\ntruth does not arise at that level since there is no univocal\nunderlying conception of set. For example, the predicativist will\nthink that there is an objective choice between PA and PA +\n¬Con(PA) but not think that there is an objective choice between\nPA2 + PU and PA2 + ¬PU (where here\nPA2 is (schematic) second-order arithmetic) or between ZFC\nand ZFC + “There are no strongly inaccessible\ncardinals”. Insofar as the predicativist thinks that the\nindependence results in set theory concerning second-order arithmetic\nare a reason for endorsing pluralism about both ZFC and PA2\nthe non-pluralist case we shall present below is directly engaged with\nthe predicativist. But we should stress that for this discussion we\nshall be presupposing ZFC and so the most direct brand of\nnon-pluralism/pluralism that we shall be engaged with is one that\ntakes a non-pluralist stance toward ZFC but a pluralist stance toward\nstatements like PU which are formally unresolvable on the basis of\nZFC. This is a fairly common view (see, for example, Shelah\n(2003)).  \nFurther Reading: For more on strict finitism see Nelson\n(1986); for more finitism see Tait (1981); for more on predicativism\nsee Feferman (1964, 2005).  \nThe above characterization of the question of pluralism makes it\nclear that it is closely connected with issues concerning the nature\nof justification in mathematics. The most traditional form of\njustification in mathematics involves justifying a statement by\nproving it from the axioms. This then raises the question: What is the\nsource of the justification of the axioms?  \n The radical pluralist maintains that there is nothing that\njustifies the axioms; rather they are simply postulates that one\nadopts hypothetically for a given purpose. This view faces the\ndifficulty raised above. Most would maintain that axioms have a\nprivileged status and that this status is more than merely\nhypothetical.  \nA popular view is that axioms are self-evident truths\nconcerning their domain. The difficulty with this view is that there\nis wide disagreement in the foundations of mathematics as to which\nstatements are self-evident and if we restrict ourselves to the\nintersection of the statements that all mathematicians would\nregard as self-evident then the result will be quite limited in reach,\nperhaps coinciding with Q or slightly\n more.[4] \n Markov\nhad a similar complaint with the employment of the related notion of\nbeing “intuitively clear”:  \nI can in no way agree to taking ‘intuitively\nclear’ as a criterion of truth in mathematics, for this\ncriterion would mean the complete triumph of subjectivism and would\nlead to a break with the understanding of science as a form of social\nactivity. (Markov (1962)) For these reasons we will not employ the notion of self-evidence.  \n There is, however, a related notion that we shall employ, namely,\nthe notion of one statement being more evident than\nanother. In contrast to the case of self-evidence, there is generally\nwide agreement (in the cases that concern us) on the question of what\nis more evident than what.   To illustrate this it is best to give some examples. Consider the following equivalences:  \n In each of the above cases, the second statement is more evident\nthan the first and there is general agreement on this fact. For\nexample, the Hilbert Basis Theorem is far from immediate. It is the\nsort of thing that we set out to prove from things that are more\nevident. In contrast, the statement that ωω is\nwell-founded is something that becomes clear by reflecting on the\nconcepts involved. It is not the sort of thing that we set out to\nprove from something more evident. This is what lies behind the fact\nthat the Hilbert Basis Theorem is called a theorem and not an\naxiom. As one climbs up through the other examples, the asymmetry\nbecomes even more dramatic. For example, the Hydra Theorem and\nKruskal's Theorem are actually quite surprising and\ncounter-intuitive. These are definitely the sort of statements that\nrequire proof on the basis of statements that are more evident.  \n We shall organize the statements in each interpretability degree\nby the relation of being more evident than and we shall speak of the\ncollection of all statements so ordered as the evidentness\norder.  \n A few words of caution are necessary concerning this\nordering. First, in saying that X is more evident than Y\nwe do not intend that X (or Y) is self-evident. To\nunderscore this point we will often use the expressions\n“X is prior to Y in the evidentness\norder”. Second, even in the case where X is minimal in\nthe evidentness order (within a given interpretability degree) we\nrefrain from saying that X is self-evident; indeed if the\ndegree is sufficiently high then this will not be the case. Third, the\nevidentness order is to be understood as an epistemic order and not,\nsay, the order of conceptual complexity. Fourth, we are not saying\nthat every two statements X and Y are comparable in the\nevidentness order. Indeed there are cases where there is not wide\nagreement on how to compare two statements in this order. However, we\nshall only employ the notion where there is wide\nagreement.  \n In addition, one might raise skeptical worries about the\nevidentness order. For example, perhaps judgments of the form\n“X is prior to Y in the evidentness order”\nare really just reflections of our mathematical training. The best way\nto allay such concerns and test the robustness of the notion is to\nexamine examples. Compare, for example, the statement of the Hydra\nTheorem and the statement that ϵ0 is well-ordered\nwith respect to primitive recursive relations (a weak\n(semi-constructive) form of the statement that ϵ0 is\nwell-ordered). If you describe the relevant notions to a mathematician\nor layperson who is not familiar with them then you will find the\nfollowing: There will be no expectation that Hercules wins the\nHydra. In fact, if you direct the person to one of the computer\nprograms (available online) that simulates the Hydra you will find\nthat they will be astounded at how fast the Hydra grows and if you\nassure them that if they kept on playing—for a period of more\nyears than there are atoms in the physical universe (as currently\nestimated)—the tides will eventually turn, they will make gains\nand eventually cut the Hydra down to size, you will find that they\nwill look at you in amazement. This is something that needs proof. Now\nif you describe to them the ordinals all the way up to\nϵ0 and you describe the notion of a well-ordering and\nask them whether ϵ0 is well-founded you will find\nthat the answer rests solely on whether they have grasped the object\nin question. To come to the conclusion that ϵ0 is\nwell-founded one does not search for a proof from some other statement\nwhich is more evident. Rather one works directly with the concepts\ninvolved. The statement, as it were, rests on the legitimacy of the\nunderlying concepts and one comes to accept it by grasping those\nconcepts. It is here that the buck stops in the process of seeking\njustification. And this is what we mean in saying that the statement\n“ϵ0 is well-ordered” is minimal in the\nevidentness order (of the degree of the Hydra Theorem).  \n In seeking axioms for theories within a given interpretability\n degree[6] \n we seek\naxioms that are as low as possible in the evidentness\norder. Ultimately one would like to find axioms that\nare minimal in the evidentness order. But questions remain:\n(1) Can we be assured of finding minimal points that\nare secure? The concern is that as one climbs up the\ninterpretability degrees the security of the minimal points will\nweaken to the point where there would arguably be little security\nleft. To see this consider statements of the form “α is\nwell-ordered” where α is the proof-theoretic ordinal of\nthe interpretability degree. As one climbs the degrees one passes\nthrough ϵ0, Γ0, and\nθΩω. This barely scratches the surface\nand yet already the corresponding statements of wellfoundedness have\nbecome less evident. This leads to the second question. (2) Is finding\na minimal point in the evidentness order (of a given interpretability\ndegree) the most one could hope for or are there other, more subtle\nways of accumulating evidence for axioms, ways that might further\nbuttress even the minimal points in the evidentness order (of a given\ninterpretability degree)?  \nThere is a discussion of Gödel that has bearing on each of\nthese questions, namely, his discussion of intrinsic and extrinsic\njustifications in his classic paper (Gödel (1947), expanded as\nGödel (1964)).  \n In introducing the notion of an intrinsic justification\nGödel gives as an example certain large cardinal axioms that are\njust beyond the reach of ZFC:  \n[The] axioms of set theory [ZFC] by no means form a\nsystem closed in itself, but, quite on the contrary, the very concept\nof set on which they are based suggests their extension by new axioms\nwhich assert the existence of still further iterations of the\noperation “set of” (260). \nAs examples he mentions the axioms asserting the existence of\ninaccessible cardinals and Mahlo cardinals:  \nThese axioms show clearly, not only that the axiomatic\nsystem of set theory as used today is incomplete, but also that it can\nbe supplemented without arbitrariness by new axioms which\nonly unfold the content of the concept of set as explained\nabove. (260–261, my emphasis) \nSince Gödel later refers to such axioms as having\n“intrinsic necessity” we shall accordingly speak of such\naxioms being intrinsically justified on the basis of the iterative\nconcept of set.  \n The notion of extrinsic justification is introduced as\nfollows:  \n[E]ven disregarding the intrinsic necessity of some\nnew axiom, and even in case it has no intrinsic necessity at all, a\nprobable decision about its truth is possible also in another way,\nnamely, inductively by studying its “success”. (261) \nHere by “success” Gödel means “fruitfulness\nin consequences, in particular “verifiable”\nconsequences”. In a famous passage he writes:  \nThere might exist axioms so abundant in their\nverifiable consequences, shedding so much light upon a whole field,\nand yielding such powerful methods for solving problems (and even\nsolving them constructively, as far as that is possible) that, no\nmatter whether or not they are intrinsically necessary, they would\nhave to be accepted at least in the same sense as any well-established\nphysical theory. (261) \n Let us now consider some examples. Consider first the conception\nof natural number that underlies the theory of Peano Arithmetic\n(PA). This conception of natural number not only justifies\nmathematical induction for the language of PA but also for any\nmathematical extension of the language of PA that is\n meaningful.[7] \n For\nexample, if we extend the language of PA by adding the Tarski truth\npredicate and we extend the axioms of PA by adding the Tarski truth\naxioms, then, on the basis of the conception of natural number, we are\njustified in accepting instances of mathematical induction involving\nthe truth predicate. In the resulting theory, one can prove\nCon(PA). This process can then be iterated (for more on this subject\nsee Feferman (1991) and the references therein) In contrast,\nthe Π01-statement\nCon(ZFC + “There are ω-many Woodin cardinals”) (a\nstatement to which we shall return below) is undoubtedly not\nintrinsically justified on the basis of the conception of natural\nnumber; rather its justification flows from an intricate network of\ntheorems in contemporary set theory, as we shall argue below.  \n Consider next the iterative conception of set. As in the case of\narithmetic, this conception (arguably) intrinsically justifies\ninstances of Replacement and Comprehension for certain extensions of\nthe language of set theory. But there are richer principles that are\n(arguably) intrinsically justified on the basis of this conception,\nnamely, the set-theoretic reflection principles. These principles\nassert (roughly) that any property that holds of V holds of\nsome initial segment Vα. These principles\nyield inaccessible and Mahlo cardinals (and more) and quite likely\nunderlie Gödel's claims in the above passage. Some have argued\nthat such reflection principles are intrinsically justified on the\nbasis of the iterative conception of set and, moreover, that they\nexhaust the principles that can be intrinsically justified on that\nconception (see, for example, Tait (2001), reprinted in (2005b),\npp. 283–284).  \n There is a view according to which intrinsically justified axioms\nare minimal points in the evidentness order and, moreover, that that\nis the most that one can hope for. On such a view, if one grants that\nthe above principles of set theory are intrinsically justified on the\nbasis of the iterative conception of set, then although one would have\naxioms that far surpassed the reaches of predicativism and even ZFC,\nlimitations would still remain and presumably a proponent of such a\nview would embrace pluralism for the remainder. For example, if, as\nTait (2001) argues, intrinsic justifications are confined to the\nhierarchy of reflection principles investigated in Tait (2005a), then\nby the results of Koellner (2009a), such a view would have to embrace\npluralism with regard to PU.  \n Extrinsic justifications provide us with the hope of securing\naxioms that have much greater reach. For they provide us with an\nadditional way to secure axioms, one that proves to be very rich. On\nthis view one can hope for much more than a minimal point in the\nevidentness order—one can hope to garner evidence for a\nproposition examining its inter-relationships with other statements\nthat are low in the evidentness ordering. Let us describe in very\nbroad brush strokes how this might work. To begin with, let us say\nthat a statement is “intrinsically plausible” if it is\n“low” in the evidentness order but the sort of thing that\ncould be overturned by other \n evidence.[8] \n One way to garner support for a proposition\nis to show that it leads to intrinsically plausible consequences. If\none then shows that it is the only statement that has these\nintrinsically plausible consequences then that strengthens the case by\nruling out possible incompatible competitors. If one shows that there\nare other intrinsically plausible statements that actually imply the\naxiom in question then that again strengthens the case by mapping over\nthe degree of intrinsic plausibility attached to one statement over to\nanother.  \n On this picture the general structure of the case for new axioms\nis this: First, for each interpretability degree one isolates the\nminimal points in the evidentness order and one organizes the entire\ndegree under the degree of one statement being more evident than\nanother. As one climbs the interpretability degrees the minimal points\ngenerally become less evident and so one seeks additional\nsupport. Second, one then examines the interconnections among the\nstatements in the interpretability degree, in particular, among the\nstatements which are low in the evidentness order. The hope is that a\nseries of deep mathematical theorems will reveal structural\nconnections that provides more and more evidential support for the\nstatements. Should this be the case then the loss in evidence attached\nto the minimal points as one climbs the interpretability hierarchy\nwould be compensated for by the gain in structural connections that\nare revealed as one ascends to richer domains of mathematics.  \n All of this is rather abstract at this stage. It is now time to\nturn to a concrete mathematical case where such structural connections\nhave been found. The question, of course, will be whether the\nmathematics makes for a convincing extrinsic case for new axioms. And\nthe question of pluralism at this level—where we are\npresupposing ZFC and trying to solve the problem of selection for\nsecond-order arithmetic—will rest on the nature of the\ncase.  \nFurther Reading: For further discussion of the nature of\naxioms and justification in mathematics see Parsons (2008) and Maddy\n(2011).  \nDescriptive set theory is the study of the structural properties of\ndefinable sets of real numbers. In this section we shall (1) provide a\nbrief historical overview, (2) introduce the basic notions of\ndescriptive set theory (explaining what we mean by “definable\nsets” and “structural properties”), (3) describe the\ncentral classical results, and (4) discuss the limitative results that\nultimately explained why the classical descriptive set theorists had\nrun into difficulties when attempting to generalize their\nresults.  \nOne reason for concentrating on definable sets of reals is that it\nis generally easier to gain insight into definable sets of reals than\narbitrary sets of reals and, furthermore, there is hope that this\ninsight will shed light on the latter. For example, in one of the\nearliest results in the subject, Cantor and Bendixson showed that\nevery closed set is either countable or has the size of the continuum;\nin other words, the closed sets satisfy CH.  \n The main origins of the subject lie in the early 20th\ncentury in the work of the French analysts Borel, Baire, and\nLebesgue. The subject grew into an independent discipline through the\nwork of the Russian mathematician Luzin (who had learned of the\nsubject as a student while in Paris) and was developed by his\nstudents, most notably Suslin. The end of this early period of\ndescriptive set theory was marked by a major theorem proved by the\nJapanese mathematician Kondô in 1937. After nearly 40 years of\ndevelopment, progress came to an abrupt halt. The explanation for this\nwas eventually provided by the independence results of Gödel and\nCohen (in 1938 and 1963). For, using this machinery, it was shown that\nthe open questions that the early descriptive set theorists were\ntrying to answer could not be resolved on the basis of the standard\naxioms of mathematics, ZFC. It is a testament to the ingenuity of the\nearly descriptive set theorists that they had developed their subject\nright up to the edge of undecidability.  \n The independence results of Gödel and Cohen thus showed that\nif one wished to develop descriptive set theory further then one must\ninvoke additional axioms. There were two main approaches, each of\nwhich led to a rebirth of descriptive set theory. The first approach\nwas to invoke axioms of definable determinacy. The axiom of\ndeterminacy (AD) was introduced by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962 and\nit was quickly seen to yield generalizations of the results of\nclassical descriptive theory. Unfortunately, AD contradicts AC and for\nthis reason it was never really proposed as a new axiom. However,\nSolovay and Takeuti pointed out that there is a natural such\nsubuniverse, namely, L(ℝ), in which AD could hold,\nconsistently with assuming AC in the full universe. This led to a\nhierarchy of axioms of definable determinacy that underwent\nintensive investigation in the 1970s and 1980s. The main sources for\nthis period are Moschovakis (1980) and the volumes of the Cabal\nseminar during 1977–1985. The second approach was to\ninvoke large cardinal axioms. This approach was initiated by\nSolovay in 1965. Finally, in the late 1960s Solovay conjectured that\nlarge cardinal axioms actually imply axioms of definable\ndeterminacy. If true, this would open the way for a unification of the\ntwo approaches. This hope was realized in the work of Martin, Steel,\nand Woodin from 1984 onward.  \nFurther Reading: For more on the history of classical\ndescriptive set theory see Kanamori (1995).  \nIn descriptive set theory it is convenient to work with the\n“logician's reals”, that is, Baire space:\nωω. This is the set of all infinite sequences\nof natural numbers (with the product topology (taking ω as\n discrete)).[9] \n In\nwhat follows, when we write ‘ℝ’ we shall always mean\n‘ωω’.  \n We are interested in sets of reals that are\n“definable” or “built up from below by simple\noperations.” We shall discuss three central regions of the\nhierarchy of definability—the Borel sets of reals,\nthe projective sets of reals, and the sets of reals\nin L(ℝ).  \n The Borel sets of reals (or sets of k-tuples of\nreals) are obtained by starting with the closed subsets of\nωω (or\n(ωω)k for some k <\nω) and closing under the operations of countable union and\ncountable intersection. This can be described level by level as\nfollows: Let k < ω. At the base level,\nlet Σ̰01\nconsist of the open subsets of\n(ωω)k and\nlet Π̰01\nconsist of the closed subsets of\n(ωω)k. For each ordinal\nα such that 0 < α < ω1, recursively\ndefine Σ̰0α\nto consist of the sets that are countable unions of sets appearing in\nsome Π̰0β,\nfor β < α, and\ndefine Π̰0α\nto consist of the sets that are countable intersections of sets\nappearing in\nsome Σ̰0β,\nfor β < α. The Borel sets of (k-tuples of) reals\nare the sets appearing in this \n hierarchy.[10] \n In 1905 Lebesgue employed Cantor's notion\nof a universal set and technique of diagonalization to show that the\nhierarchy of Borel sets is a proper hierarchy (that is, new\nsets appear at each level).  \n The projective sets of reals (or sets of k-tuples\nof reals) are obtained by starting with the closed subsets of\n(ωω)k and iterating the\noperations of complementation and projection. For A ⊆\n(ωω)k,\nthe complement of A is simply\n(ωω)k\n− A. For A ⊆\n(ωω)k+1,\nthe projection of A is  \n (Think of the case where k + 1 = 3. Here A is a\nsubset of three-dimensional space and p[A] is the result\nof “projecting” A along the third axis onto the\nplane spanned by the first two axes.)  We can now define the hierarchy\nof projective sets as follows: At the base level,\nlet Σ̰10\nconsist of the open subsets of\n(ωω)k and\nlet Π̰10\nconsist of the closed subsets of\n(ωω)k. For each n such\nthat 0 < n < ω, recursively\ndefine Π̰1n\nto consist of the complements of sets\nin Σ̰1n,\nand\ndefine Σ̰1n+1\nto consist of the projections of sets\nin Π̰1n. The\nprojective sets of (k-tuples of) reals are the sets appearing\nin this hierarchy. This hierarchy is also a proper hierarchy, as can\nbe seen using universal sets and diagonalization.  \n It is useful to also introduce\nthe Δ̰1n\nsets. A set of (k-tuples of) reals\nis Δ̰1n\niff it is\nboth Σ̰1n\nand Π̰1n. In\n1917, Suslin showed that the Borel sets are precisely\nthe Δ̰11\nsets. Thus, the projective hierarchy extends the Borel hierarchy.  \n It might seem odd to refer to the above hierarchies as hierarchies\nof definability. However, as the notation indicates, the above\nhierarchies can be recast in terms of definability. For example, the\nprojective sets are exactly the sets which are definable (with\nparameters) in second-order arithmetic. In the\nnotation Σ̰1n,\nthe superscript indicates that we are allowing quantification over\nobjects of second-order (that is, sets of integers (or, equivalently,\nreal numbers)), ‘Σ’ indicates that the starting\nquantifier is existential, the subscript indicates that there\nare n-alternations of quantifiers, and ‘∼’\nindicates that we are allowing real parameters. In the case where real\nparameters are prohibited, the corresponding pointclasses are\ndenoted Σ1n, Π1n,\nand Δ1n. The\nformer hierarchy (where real parameters are allowed) is called\na boldface hierarchy, while the latter (where real parameters\nare prohibited) is called a lightface hierarchy. In a similar\nmanner one can define a lightface version of the Borel\n hierarchy.[11]\n Thus, we really have two hierarchies of definability: the lightface\nhierarchy and the boldface hierarchy.  \n The projective hierarchy can be extended into the transfinite as\nfollows: For a set X, let Def(X) consist of the subsets\nof X that are definable over X using parameters\nfrom X. This is the definable powerset operation. The\nhierarchy L(ℝ) is the result of starting with ℝ and\niterating the definable powerset operation along the ordinals; more\nprecisely, we let L0(ℝ)\n= Vω+1, Lα+1(ℝ)\n=\nDef(Lα(ℝ)), Lλ(ℝ)\n=\n⋃α<λLα(ℝ)\nfor limit ordinals λ, and, finally,  \n We are interested in the sets of (k-tuples of) reals\nappearing in this hierarchy, that\nis, P((ωω)k)\n∩ Lα(ℝ) for α ∈\nOn. Notice that in the definition of the projective sets,\ncomplementation corresponds to negation and projection corresponds to\nexistential quantification over real numbers. It follows that the\nprojective sets of (k-tuples of) reals are\nexactly P((ωω)k)\n∩ L1(ℝ). Thus, the hierarchy of\nsets P((ωω)k)\n∩ Lα(ℝ) (for α ∈ On) does\nindeed yield a transfinite extension of the projective sets.  \n One can pass beyond the above hierarchy of sets of reals by\nconsidering richer notions of definability. We shall say little about\nthese stages, except to note that there are natural limits to the\nlightface and boldface hierarchy, namely that of being definable from\nordinal parameters (OD) and that of being definable from ordinal\nparameters and real numbers (OD(ℝ)). To see that the notion\nof ordinal definability is a limiting case of the lightface\nhierarchy notice first that any notion of definability which does not\nrender all of the ordinals definable can be transcended (as can be\nseen by considering the least ordinal which is not definable according\nto the notion) and second that the notion of ordinal definability\ncannot be so transcended (since by reflection OD is ordinal\ndefinable). (Similar considerations apply to the boldface hierarchy.)\nIt is for this reason that Gödel proposed the notion of ordinal\ndefinability as a candidate for an “absolute” notion of\ndefinability. As a limiting case of the lightface and boldface\nhierarchy we therefore have the sets of reals that are OD and the sets\nof reals that are OD(ℝ), respectively.  \nThere are many properties shared by “well-behaved” sets\nof reals. These are called regularity properties. We shall\nconcentrate on the three most central regularity\nproperties—the perfect set property, the property\nof Baire, and Lebesgue measurability.  \n A set of reals is perfect iff it is nonempty, closed and\ncontains no isolated points. The key feature of this for our purposes\nis that if a set of reals contains a perfect subset then it must have\nthe same size as the continuum (i.e., the reals). A set of reals is\nsaid to have the perfect set property iff it is either\ncountable or contains a perfect subset. The interest of this property\nis that the sets of reals with the perfect set property satisfy CH. In\nearly work, Cantor and Bendixson established (in 1883) that all closed\nsets have the perfect set property. Thus, there is no closed\ncounter-example to the continuum hypothesis. Later, in 1903, Young\nshowed that\nthe Π̰02\nsets have the perfect set property. A central question was how far\nthis property propagates. Do all of the Borel sets of reals have the\nperfect set property? Do all of the projective sets of reals have the\nperfect set property?  \n A set of reals is nowhere dense iff its closure under\nlimits contains no open sets. A set of reals is meager iff it\nis the countable union of nowhere dense sets. Finally, a set of\nreals A has the property of Baire iff it is\n“almost open” in the sense that there is an open\nset O such that the region where O and A do not\noverlap (that is, the symmetric difference (O − A)\n∪ (A − O)) is meager. It is straightforward to\nshow that all Borel sets have the property of Baire. Do all of the\nprojective sets have the property of Baire?  \n The property of Lebesgue measurability is familiar from\nanalysis and here we shall be more brief. To begin with, one\nintroduces a probability measure over sets of reals. A set of reals\nis null iff it has measure zero. A set of reals A\nis Lebesgue measurable iff it is “almost Borel”\nin the sense that there is a Borel set B such that the region\nwhere B and A do not overlap is null. The interest of\nthis notion can perhaps be best brought out by recalling a theorem of\nBanach and Tarski. Banach and Tarski showed that it is possible to cut\nthe unit sphere into finitely many pieces, and shift those pieces\naround (using only translations and rotations) to bring them back\ntogether into a sphere of twice the size. This requires a key\napplication of the Axiom of Choice. It is immediate that such pieces\ncannot be Lebesgue measurable. The question is “How complex must\nsuch pieces be?” and this amounts to the question “Which\nsets are Lebesgue measurable?” It is clear that the Borel sets\nare Lebesgue measurable. Are the projective sets Lebesgue\nmeasurable?  \n In all three cases it is straightforward to use the Axiom of\nChoice to show that there are sets of reals without the regularity\nproperty. The question is whether all definable sets of reals\nhave these properties.  \nThere are many structural properties connected with sets of\nreals—the uniformization property, the separation property, the\nprewellordering property, the basis property, the existence of scales,\nSuslin cardinals, the existence of homogeneous representations,\netc. We shall concentrate on just one such property—the\nuniformization property.  \n Let A and B be subsets of the plane\n(ωω)2. A uniformizes B\niff A ⊆ B and for all x ∈\nωω, there exists y such that\n〈x,y〉 ∈ B iff there is\na unique y such that 〈x,y〉\n∈ A. In other words, A yields a choice function\nfor B. Using AC it is clear that every set B has a\nuniformizing set A. However, the question of whether\nuniformizations exist becomes interesting when one imposes a\ndefinability constraint. Let Γ be a collection of\n(k-tuples of) sets of reals. Such a class is called\na pointclass. The pointclass Γ has uniformization\nproperty (Unif(Γ)) iff every subset of the plane that is in\nΓ admits a uniformization that is also in Γ.  \nDuring the early 20th century there were many advances\nby the French and Russian analysts in establishing that definable sets\nhad the above regularity and structural properties. We shall limit our\ndiscussion to the crowning achievements:  \n Notice that the property of Baire and Lebesgue measurability have\nthe feature that if they hold of A then they hold of the\ncomplement of A. However, the perfect set property does not\nhave this feature. It remained open whether\nall Π̰11\nsets have the perfect set property and whether\nall Σ̰12\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable.  \n It remained open whether all sets of reals\nin Π̰12, Σ̰13,\netc. have the uniformization property.  \nIt proved difficult to extend the above results to higher\npointclasses, so much so that in 1925 Luzin said that “one\nwill never know” whether all of the projective sets of\nreals have the regularity properties.  \n We now know the reason for the difficulties—the early\nanalysts were working in ZFC and the above questions cannot be\nresolved on the basis of ZFC alone. It is a testament to the power of\nthe early analysts that they obtained the strongest results that were\nwithin the reach of their background assumptions.  \n The independence of the above statements follows from the dual\ntechniques of inner model theory (invented by Gödel in\n1938) and outer model theory (invented by Cohen in\n1963).  \n The first half was established by Gödel and Addison:  \nIt follows that (assuming that ZFC is consistent), ZFC cannot prove\nthat Σ̰12\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable,\nthat Π̰11\nsets have the perfect set property, and that\nUnif(Σ̰1n)\nfails for n ≥ 2. It remained open whether ZFC could\nestablish the negations.  \n The second half was established by Martin, Solovay and Levy:  \nThe strongly inaccessible cardinal is necessary for the perfect set\nproperty (even\nfor Π̰11\nsets (Solovay)) and Lebesgue measurability (Shelah) but not for the\nproperty of Baire (Shelah). However, Martin and Solovay showed in 1970\nthat if ZFC is consistent then so is ZFC along with the statement that\nall Σ12\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable.  \nIn fact, Levy noted that this is the case in the original model\nintroduced by Cohen.  \n Putting everything together we have the following: (1) If ZFC is\nconsistent, then ZFC cannot determine whether\nall Σ̰12\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. (2) If\nZFC + “There is a strongly inaccessible cardinal” is\nconsistent, then ZFC cannot determine whether\nall Π̰11\nsets have the perfect set property. (3) If ZFC is consistent, then ZFC\ncannot determine the pattern of the uniformization property; more\nprecisely, it is consistent with ZFC that the uniformization property\nhas either the pattern  \nor the pattern  \nFurther Reading: For more on the history of classical\ndescriptive set theory see Kanamori (1995). For more on the\nmathematics of classical descriptive set theory see sections 12 and 13\nof Kanamori (2003), Kechris (1995), and Moschovakis (1980).  \nThe above limitative results show that ZFC lacks sufficient power\nto resolve many questions about simple definable sets of\nreals—it cannot determine\nwhether Σ̰12\nsets have the regularity properties and it cannot determine the\npattern of the uniformization property\nbeyond Σ̰12. This\nplaced mathematicians in an interesting predicament. In order to\nresolve these questions they must expand their resources beyond\nZFC. But there are many ways of doing this and it is unclear at the\noutset whether there is a correct direction of expansion.  \n There were two main candidates for new axioms that underwent\nintensive investigation in the 1970s and 1980s: Axioms of definable\ndeterminacy and large cardinal axioms. In this section we will (1)\nintroduce the basic machinery of determinacy and describe the\nimplications of axioms of definable determinacy for classical\ndescriptive set theory and (2) describe the implications of large\ncardinal axioms for classical descriptive set theory and briefly touch\non the connection between the two approaches.  \nFor a set of reals A ⊆ ωω\nconsider the game where two players take turns playing natural\nnumbers:  \n At the end of a round of this game the two players will have\nproduced a real x, obtained through “interleaving”\ntheir plays. We say that Player I wins the round if x\n∈ A; otherwise Player II wins the round. The set A\nis said to be determined if one of the players has a\n“winning strategy” in the associated game, that is, a\nstrategy which ensures that the player wins a round regardless of how\nthe other player plays. The Axiom of Determinacy (AD) is the\nstatement that every set of reals is determined. This axiom\nwas introduced by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962.  \n It is straightforward to see that very simple sets are\ndetermined. For example, if A is the set of all reals then\nclearly I has a winning strategy; if A is empty then clearly II\nhas a winning strategy; and if A is countable then II has a\nwinning strategy (by “diagonalizing”). This might lead one\nto expect that all sets of reals are determined. However, it\nis straightforward to use the Axiom of Choice (AC) to construct a\nnon-determined set (by listing all winning strategies and\n“diagonalizing” across them). For this reason AD was never\nreally considered as a serious candidate for a new axiom. However,\nthere is an interesting class of related axioms that are consistent\nwith AC, namely, the axioms of definable determinacy. These\naxioms extend the above pattern by asserting that all sets of reals at\na given level of complexity are determined, notable examples\nbeing Δ̰11-determinacy\n(all Borel sets of reals are determined), PD (all projective sets of\nreals are determined) and ADL(ℝ) (all sets of\nreals in L(ℝ) are determined).  \n One issue is whether these are really new axioms or whether they\nfollow from ZFC. One of the earliest results in the subject (due to\nGale and Stewart in 1953) is that (in ZFC)\nall Π̰01\n(that is, closed) games are determined. This result was extended to\nthe next few levels of the Borel hierarchy. Finally, in 1974, Martin\nproved the landmark result\nthat Δ̰11-determinacy\nis provable in ZFC. It turns out that this result is close to\noptimal—as one climbs the hierarchy of definability, shortly\nafter Δ̰11\none arrives at axioms that fall outside the provenance of ZFC. For\nexample, this is true\nof Π̰11-determinacy,\nPD and ADL(ℝ). Thus, we have here a hierarchy\nof axioms (including PD and ADL(ℝ)) which are\ngenuine candidates for new axioms.  \n For a pointclass Γ of (k-tuples of) sets of reals,\nlet Det(Γ) be the statement that all sets of reals in Γ\nare determined. In what follows we shall assume that Γ has\ncertain minimal closure properties; more precisely, we shall assume\nthat Γ is an adequate pointclass in the sense of\nMoschovakis (1980). The precise details of this notion are not\nimportant for our purposes; suffice it to say that all of the\npointclasses introduced thus far are adequate.  \n In particular, if one assumes PD then all projective sets of reals\nhave the regularity properties and if one assumes\nADL(ℝ) then all of the sets of reals\nin L(ℝ) have the regularity properties.  \n In fact by modifying the above proofs one can obtain the\nregularity properties for a larger pointclass, namely,\n∃ℝΓ. This is the pointclass obtained by\ntaking projections of sets in Γ. So, for example, if Γ\nis Δ̰11\nthen ∃ℝΓ\nis Σ̰11. It\nfollows that\nassuming Δ̰11-determinacy\n(which is provable in ZFC) one gets that\nthe Σ̰11\nsets of reals have the regularity properties (see the exercises in 6.G\nof Moschovakis (1980)). In this sense determinacy lies at the heart of\nthe regularity properties and may be considered their true\nsource.  \n The above results show that axioms of definable determinacy extend\nthe results on regularity properties that can be proved in ZFC. ZFC\ncan establish that\nall Σ̰11\nsets of reals have the regularity properties\nand Δ̰11-determinacy\n(a theorem of ZFC) lies at the heart of this result. The extension\nof Δ̰11-determinacy\nto stronger forms of definable determinacy (PD,\nADL(ℝ), etc.) generalizes these results by\nextending the regularity properties to the corresponding pointclasses\n(projective, in L(ℝ), etc.)  \n In a similar fashion, axioms of definable determinacy extend the\nresults on the uniformization property.  \nThus, under PD the uniformization property has the following\npattern:  \n This pattern recurs at higher levels under stronger forms of\ndeterminacy. For example, under ADL(ℝ) the\npattern recurs throughout the transfinite extension of the projective\nsets within L(ℝ). For all of L(ℝ) one\nhas:  \n(Here Σ̰21\nis defined just as (the logical version)\nof Σ̰11\nexcept that now the initial quantifier ranges over sets of reals and\nnot just reals (as is indicated by the superscript).)   \n Moreover, the uniformization property is not an isolated case. The\nsame pattern holds for other properties, such as the prewellordering\nproperty and the scale property.  \nThe second approach to new axioms—which ran in parallel to\nthe approach using definable determinacy—was to invoke large\ncardinal axioms. In fact, it was gradually shown (as Solovay had\nconjectured in the late 1960s) that large cardinal axioms actually\nimply forms of definable determinacy.  \n The result that underscored the significance of large cardinal\naxioms for the structure theory of simply definable sets of reals is\nthe following early result of Solovay:  \n Given\nthat Π̰11-determinacy\nimplies the regularity properties\nfor Σ̰12\nsets of reals (see the discussion after Theorems 3.1–3.3), it\nwas reasonable to suspect that a measurable cardinal actually\nimplied Π̰11-determinacy. This\nwas established by Martin:  \n Since definable determinacy lay at the heart of the structure\ntheory, much of the energy was focused on trying to show that it\nfollowed from large cardinal axioms. The next major advance was made\nin 1978.  \n(Martin actually used a somewhat weaker assumption but it is\nsomewhat technical and it would not be illuminating to state it\nhere.)  \n In early 1979, Woodin extended this by showing that PD follows\nfrom much stronger large cardinal hypotheses. To describe this, let us\nintroduce some terminology: Suppose j\n: Vλ+1 → Vλ+1\nis a non-trivial elementary embedding. Let\nκ0(j) be the critical point of j and\nfor each n let κn+1(j)\n= j(κn(j)). Let\nκw(j)\n={sup}n<ωκn(j). (Notice\nthat j(κω(j)) =\nκω(j).)  A sequence of\nembeddings j0,…, jn\nis an n-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence if\nthere exists a λ such that  \n is a non-trivial elementary embedding and  \nSo PD follows from the assumption that for each n, there is\nan n-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence.  \n The interesting thing about these large cardinal hypotheses is\nthat for n > 0 they are inconsistent with AC (by a result of\nKunen). Moreover, there is now reason to believe that for n\n> 0 they are outright inconsistent (in ZF) (see Woodin\n(2011)). Should this turn out to be the case it would be rather\ninteresting since it would be a case where one derived structure\ntheory from an inconsistency without awareness of the\ninconsistency.  \n Fortunately, in December of 1983 Woodin both strengthened the\nconclusion and reduced the large cardinal hypothesis to one that is\nnot known to be inconsistent with AC:  \nIn fact, Woodin got much more definable determinacy than\nADL(ℝ).  \n Still, the large cardinal assumption was thought to be too\nstrong. At this point the episode of history described\nearlier—the one involving Solovay's theorem of 1965 and Martin's\ntheorem of 1970—repeated itself. For in 1984 Woodin showed that\nif there is a supercompact cardinal then all projective sets have the\nregularity properties. In joint work with Shelah, the hypothesis was\nsignificantly reduced.  \n As in the earlier episode, this suggested that the above large\ncardinal hypothesis actually\nimplied Π̰1n+1-determinacy. This\nwas soon established by a landmark result of Martin and Steel.  \nFinally, in combination with Woodin's work on the stationary tower,\nthe following result was established.  \n In this way the two approaches to new axioms—via axioms of\ndefinable determinacy and via large cardinal axioms—were shown\nto be closely related. In fact, in subsequent work it was shown that\nthe connections are much deeper. But to fully appreciate this we must\nfirst introduce the machinery of inner model theory.  \nFurther Reading: For more on determinacy see sections\n27–32 of Kanamori (2003) and Moschovakis (1980). For further\ndetails concerning the structure theory provided by determinacy see\nthe volumes of the Cabal Seminar and Jackson (2010).  \nWe are now in a position to discuss aspects of the case that has\nbeen made for axioms of definable determinacy.  \nLet us stress from the beginning that because of the incompleteness\ntheorems the case for any new axiom is going to have to be\ndelicate. The standard way of establishing a proposition in\nmathematics is by proving it within some accepted set of\naxioms. However, the axioms implicitly accepted by mathematicians in\neveryday practice seem to be exhausted by those of ZFC, and we are\nhere dealing with questions and new axioms that are beyond the reach\nof ZFC. Given the nature of the case, it seems unlikely therefore that\none will have a knock-down argument for new axioms. Instead it seems\nthat the most that one can hope for is to accumulate evidence until\neventually the case becomes compelling. The other alternative is that\nthe case remains divided between two equally compelling but mutually\ninconsistent approaches.  \n Let us first say something very general about how such a case\nmight proceed. Some propositions have a certain degree\nof intrinsic plausibility. For example, the statement that\nthere is no paradoxical decomposition of the sphere using pieces that\nare Σ̰12\nis intrinsically plausible, although it is not provable in ZFC. Such\ninitial support for a proposition is not definitive. For example, the\nstatement that there are no space filling curves and the statement\nthat there is no paradoxical decomposition of the sphere using any\npieces whatsoever might have once seemed intrinsically plausible. But\nin each case these statements were overturned by theorems proved\nagainst the backdrop of systems that had much more than this degree of\ninitial plausibility in their favour. However, although such intrinsic\nplausibility is not definitive, it nevertheless has some weight.  \n Moreover, the weight can accumulate. Suppose we have two\nstatements from conceptually distinct domains that are intrinsically\nplausible—for example, one might concern the existence of (inner\nmodels of) large cardinal axioms and the other might concern the\nregularity properties of simply definable sets. If it is shown that\nthe first implies the second then the second inherits the initial\nplausibility attached to the first. Should the two statements\nultimately be shown to imply one another this would strengthen the\ncase for each. The hope is that through the accumulation of\nmathematical results—theorems proved in first-order logic, which\nare matters upon which everyone can agree—various independent\nintrinsically plausible statements will come to reinforce each other\nto the point where the case as a whole becomes compelling.  \n Some have maintained that this is actually the situation with\naxioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms. In the\nremainder of this section we shall present the case in the strongest\nway we know how.  \nFurther Reading: For more on the notion of intrinsic\nplausibility and how it figures in the structure of reason, see\nChapter 9 of Parsons (2008).  \nFor definiteness, when we speak of the “structure\ntheory” (at a given level) we shall be referring to the\nregularity properties introduced above—the perfect set property,\nand the property of Baire, and Lebesgue measurability—along with\nthe uniformization property. There is actually much more (as indicated\nabove) to the structure theory and what we shall have to say\ngeneralizes. We shall concentrate on two levels of definable\ndeterminacy—Δ̰11-determinacy\nand ADL(ℝ). Again, this is just for\ndefiniteness and what we shall have to say generalizes to certain\nhigher forms of definable determinacy.  \n The\naxiom Δ̰11-determinacy\n(equivalently, Borel-determinacy) is a theorem of ZFC and lies at the\nheart of the structure theory of Borel sets (and, in fact,\nthe Σ̰11-sets\nand Σ̰12\nsets). One virtue of ADL(ℝ) is that it lifts\nthis entire structure theory from the Borel sets to the sets\nin L(ℝ). Summarizing results from above we have:  \n Many descriptive set theorists take these consequences to be\nintrinsically plausible. Moreover, they have found the particular\npattern of the uniformization property provided by\nADL(ℝ) to be a plausible extension of the\npattern initiated in ZFC. For this last point consider the first\nω many levels and compare the case of V = L with\nthat of PD. In ZFC, the uniformization property propagates\nfrom Π̰11\nto Σ̰12. It\nis natural to expect it to continue to zig-zag back and\nforth. However, under V = L it stabilizes:  \nIn contrast, PD provides what appears to be the correct\nextrapolation:  \nAgain, this “periodicity phenomenon” occurs at higher\nlevels in L(ℝ).  \n One might grant that these are indeed fruitful consequences of\nADL(ℝ) and as such are evidence that\nADL(ℝ) holds. However, one might be concerned\nthat perhaps there are axioms that share these fruitful consequences\nand yet are incompatible with ADL(ℝ). As a\nresponse, one might note that this objection is never raised in the\nanalogous case of physics where a multitude of incompatible theories\ncan agree in their empirical consequences. But there is a much\nstronger response that one can make. For in contrast to the case of\nphysics—where one could never hope to show that there was only\none theory with the desired empirical consequences—in set theory\nthis is actually the case; more precisely, any theory that has these\nfruitful consequences—that is, which lifts the structure theory\nto the level of L(ℝ)—must imply\nADL(ℝ). This remarkable fact is embodied in\nthe following theorem:  \n Summary: There is a “good theory” (one that lifts the\nstructure theory) and all good theories imply\nADL(ℝ).  \nLarge cardinal axioms are taken (by those who study them) to have\ncertain degrees of intrinsic plausibility. As we noted above, large\ncardinal axioms imply forms of definable determinacy and so the latter\ninherit the considerations in favour of the former.  \n In fact, it turns out that the existence of certain inner\nmodels of large cardinal axioms is sufficient to prove definable\ndeterminacy. Since it is (arguably) even more plausible that there are\nsuch inner models, this (arguably) strengthens the case. So definable\ndeterminacy is a fruitful consequence of the existence of such inner\nmodels.  \n However, just as in the previous subsection, one would like some\nassurance that there are not incompatible axioms that share this\nfruitful consequence. Remarkably, this turns out to be the\ncase—axioms of definable determinacy are\nactually equivalent to axioms asserting the existence of\ninner models of large cardinals. We discuss what is known about this\nconnection, starting with a low level of boldface definable\ndeterminacy and proceeding upward. It should be emphasized that our\nconcern here is not merely with consistency strength but rather with\noutright equivalence (over \n ZFC).[12] \n Summary: Large cardinal axioms are sufficient to prove definable\ndeterminacy and inner models of large cardinal axioms are necessary to\nprove definable determinacy. In fact, through a series of deep\nresults, these two conceptually distinct approaches to new axioms are\nultimately seen to be at root equivalent.  \nLarge cardinal axioms have the fruitful consequence that they imply\naxioms of definable determinacy and hence illuminate the structure\ntheory of definable sets of reals. In fact,\nADL(ℝ) appears to be “effectively\ncomplete” with regard to questions\nconcerning L(ℝ). Let us try to make this precise in terms\nof generic absoluteness.  \n The motivating result in this area is the following:  \nIn other words,\nthe Σ12-theory\ncannot be altered by the method of outer models. In such a situation\nwe say that ϕ is generically absolute. Since our main\nmethod of establishing independence (without leaving an\ninterpretability degree) is the method of outer models, this explains\nwhy there are no\nknown Σ12\nstatements that lie in the interpretability degree of ZFC and are\nknown to be independent of ZFC.  \n A fruitful consequence of large cardinal axioms is that they place\nus in exactly this situation with regard to a much larger class of\nstatements (see Larson (2004) for an account of this result).  \n In this situation one, of course, has\nADL(ℝ). Again, one might be concerned that one\ncan have this fruitful consequence without having\nADL(ℝ). This is addressed by the following\ntheorem:  \n Summary: There is a “good theory” (one that freezes\nthe theory of L(ℝ)) and (granting a proper class of\nstrongly inaccessible cardinals) all good theories imply\nADL(ℝ).  \nWe have discussed two recovery results for\nADL(ℝ). First, ADL(ℝ)\nis implied by its structural consequences (Theorem 4.2). Second,\nADL(ℝ) is recovered by the generic\nabsoluteness that follows from large cardinals that imply\nADL(ℝ) (Theorem 4.11).  \n These recovery results are not isolated occurrences. The technique\nused to establish them is known as the core model\ninduction. This technique has been used to show that many other\nstrong theories imply ADL(ℝ). This even holds\nfor theories that are incompatible with one another. For\nexample, consider the following:  \nThese two theories are incompatible. There are many other\nexamples. In fact, the examples are so ubiquitous and the technique is\nso general that there is reason to believe that\nADL(ℝ) lies in the overlapping\nconsensus of all sufficiently strong, natural theories.  \n Summary: ADL(ℝ) lies in the overlapping\nconsensus of numerous strong theories and so it inherits the\nconsiderations of each. Moreover, there is reason to believe that\nADL(ℝ) lies in the overlapping consensus\nof all sufficiently strong, “natural”\ntheories.  \nMuch of the above case can be pushed even\nbeyond L(ℝ). To explain this we will need to introduce\nthe notion of a universally Baire set of reals.  \n For a cardinal δ, a set A ⊆ ℝ is\nδ-universally Baire if for all partial orders ℙ\nof cardinality δ, there exist trees S and T on\nω × λ (for some λ) such that A\n= p[T] and, if G ⊆ ℙ\nis V-generic,\nthen p[T]V[G] =\nℝV[G]\n− p[S]V[G]. A\nset A ⊆ ℝ is universally Baire if it is\nδ-universally Baire for all δ. The key point is that\nuniversally Baire sets have canonical interpretations in generic\nextensions V[G]. Let Γ∞ be the\ncollection of sets of reals that are universally Baire. This\ncollection has strong closure properties. For example, Woodin showed\nthat if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and A ∈\nΓ∞ then (1) L(A,ℝ) ⊧\nAD+ and (2) P(ℝ)\n∩ L(A,ℝ) ⊆\nΓ∞. Here AD+ is a (potential)\nstrengthening of AD designed for models of the\nform L(P(ℝ)) (see Woodin\n(1999)).  \n For κ an infinite regular cardinal, let H(κ) be\nthe set of all sets x such that the cardinality of the\ntransitive closure of x is less than κ.  \nThat is, we have generic absoluteness for\n“projective-in-A” where A is universally\nBaire. In fact, one has\n“Σ21(Γ∞)-generic\nabsoluteness”:  \nStronger large cardinal axioms imply that many sets of reals\nbeyond L(ℝ) are universally Baire. Let us call a\nset absolutely Δ21\nif there\nare Σ21\nformulas which define complementary sets of reals in all generic\nextensions. Woodin showed that if there is a proper class of\nmeasurable Woodin cardinals then all\nabsolutely Δ21\nsets of reals are universally \n Baire.[13] \n This is one precise sense in which CH was\nan unfortunate choice of a test case for the program for large\ncardinals—large cardinal axioms effectively settle all questions\nof complexity strictly below (in the above sense) that of\n CH.[14] \nEach of the above arguments has two parts. In the first part, one\nargues that there is a “good” theory (one having certain\nfruitful consequences). In many cases this theory explicitly includes\n(or just is) ADL(ℝ). In the second part, one\nshows that all such theories include\nADL(ℝ).  \n We want to stress this second part—the recovery\ntheorems. Without the recovery theorems one could always wonder\nwhether there are incompatible axioms with the same fruitful\nconsequences. In contrast to the case of physics, where one could\nnever hope to show that the data logically implies the theory, in the\ncase of the search for new axioms this is in fact possible. It is the\nrecovery theorems that seal the case.  \n Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of axioms of definable\ndeterminacy is the last. For the results show that there are deep\nconnections between approaches to new axioms from conceptually\ndistinct domains and that, remarkably, ADL(ℝ)\nis part of the picture provided by each. In short,\nADL(ℝ) lies in the overlapping consensus of\nall approaches that involve climbing the hierarchy of interpretability\nalong a natural path.  \nFurther Reading: For more on the topics of this section\nsee Koellner (2006, 2009b), Maddy (1988a,b), Martin (1998), Steel\n(2000), and Woodin (2001a,b, 2005a,b).  \nLet us return to the question of pluralism. Do the above results\ncollectively provide us with a strong extrinsic justification of\nADL(ℝ) and thereby secure non-pluralism at\nthis level?  \n The pluralist will certainly accept the above results—after\nall, they are mathematical theorems—but will resist the claim\nthat they provide us with theoretical reasons for adopting\nADL(ℝ). The pluralist may grant that the\nresults are quite interesting and that they show that\nADL(ℝ) has a certain appeal—since, for\nexample, it renders L(ℝ) a paradise for\nanalysts—but they will view this as a practical reason for\nadopting ADL(ℝ), not a theoretical reason. On\nthis view there are many roads that one can take—V\n= L, ADL(ℝ), etc.—and that while\neach has its advantages with respect to certain aims there is no\n“fact of the matter” as to which is the correct one, any\nmore than there is a “fact of the matter” as to which of\ntwo notations is the correct notation. At this level, according to the\npluralist, no theoretical reasons are at play and there is no issue of\nobjective mathematical truth. This is the view of Feferman (1999),\nKanamori (2003), Shelah (2003), and many other philosophers and\nmathematicians.  \n The non-pluralist regards the above results as collectively\nproviding very strong theoretical reasons for thinking that\nADL(ℝ) holds and that the other, incompatible\nalternatives fail. This is the view of Martin (1998), Steel (2000),\nWoodin (2005a), many philosophers and mathematicians, and most\ndescriptive set theorists and inner model theorists.  \n As we mentioned in the introduction, some pluralists and\nnon-pluralists take realism to be prior to reason while others take\nreason to be prior to realism. It is important to keep these two\nversions separate and address them individually.  \n Let us start with those who take realism to be prior to reason. To\nfix ideas consider the pluralist who accepts realism about the natural\nnumbers but not about arbitrary subsets of natural numbers and then,\non this basis, concludes that theoretical reasons can be offered in\nthe case of new axioms in number theory but not in the case of\nanalysis or set theory. When pressed on the source of this\nasymmetrical stance concerning realism in the two domains the\npluralist usually responds by resorting to the intuition that the\nnatural numbers are “clear” while the notion of an\narbitrary subset of natural numbers is “inherently\nvague”. To this the non-pluralist might respond that the notion\nof clarity is not clear. Intuitions of clarity, like intuitions of\nself-evidence, are notoriously vague and subjective and hence a weak\npoint upon which to rest one's case.  \n Let us now turn to those who take reason to be prior to\nrealism. People in this category take objectivity to be the hallmark\nof realism and they come to their conclusions concerning realism about\na given domain only after one has a good understanding of what kind of\ntheoretical reasons have traction in that domain. A pluralist who\nthinks that theoretical justification in mathematics must ultimately\ntrace back to axioms which are self-evident will be unmoved by the\nabove extrinsic case. Likewise for a pluralist who thinks that\ntheoretical justification in mathematics must ultimately trace back to\naxioms that are extrinsically justified. The case we have given is\nclearly an extrinsic one. The issue, then, comes down to the\nlegitimacy of extrinsic justifications.  \n We are certainly not in a position to resolve this debate\nhere. But it will be helpful to draw a parallel with the debate\nbetween the instrumentalist and non-instrumentalist\nin physics. An extreme form of instrumentalism was advanced by the\nneo-Kantian Hans Vaihinger in his book The Philosophy of As\nIf (1911). According to this view, the “hard data” of\nphysics consists in the data of our immediate sense impressions. Upon\nthis basis we are free to construct—in common sense and in\nphysics—a “reality”, but the result is not genuine\nknowledge—rather, it is a useful fiction for moving around in\neveryday life and making predictions in physics. In a similar fashion,\nthe extreme pluralist takes the “hard data” to consist of\nthe theorems that have actually been established and regards\neverything else as a useful fiction.  \n In the physical case the non-instrumentalist sees theoretical\nreason at play at a much higher-level, far beyond the data. For\nexample, in the time of Copernicus, when the Ptolemaic and Copernican\ntheory were observationally indistinguishable, theoretical reasons\ncould still be given for the Copernican theory over the Ptolemaic\n theory.[15]\n Similarly in the set theoretic case the non-pluralist sees theoretical\nreason at play at higher level, beyond the theorems and the\nintrinsically plausible statements. Just as in astronomy the\nnon-instrumentalist finds evidence of a higher-level structure in the\nconstellation of connections, likewise in the case of set theory the\nnon-pluralist takes the constellation of connections in the\ninterpretability hierarchy—in particular, the above theorems\nconcerning ADL(ℝ)—as providing evidence\nof structure of a higher level. There is, of course, much more to be\nsaid. But we hope to have brought the issues to the fore.  \n It should be mentioned that the non-pluralist about\nADL(ℝ) is open to the possibility that\npluralism holds at higher levels, say at the level of CH.
