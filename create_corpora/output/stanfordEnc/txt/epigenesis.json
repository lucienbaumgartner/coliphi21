Does\nevery individual start from material that is unformed, and the form\nemerges only gradually, over time? Or does the individual start in some\nalready preformed, or predelineated, or predetermined way? The\nquestions are part metaphysical: what is it that exists — form or\nalso the unformed that becomes the formed? And they are partly\nepistemological: how do we know — through observation or\ninference? The debate has persisted since ancient times, and today\nplays out as genetic determinists appeal to the already\n“formed” through genetic inheritance, while others insist\non the efficacy of environmental plasticity. Nature or nurture,\nepigenesis or preformation, genetic determinism or developmental free\nwill, or is some version of a middle ground possible? These are the\nterms of this perennial discussion, and the underlying assumptions\nshape debates about when life begins and have profound bioethical and\npolicy implications.\n\n\n\nThe core question underlying the existence of these two competing\nphilosophical traditions is the extent to which something is considered\nas being formed or organized from the “beginning” or\nwhether organization and form arise only over time. 19th\ncentury uses of the term “evolution” included a sense of\nunfolding of preexisting form, or a sort of preformationism in contrast\nto the epigenesis of the day. Discussions of “evolution”\nand “epigenesis” can therefore be misleading in retrospect\nsince evolution has assumed a meaning more nearly like the old\nepigenesis [Bowler 1975]. Making things even more complicated, by the\nlate 19th century “preformationism” really was\nless about the preexistence of form as such than about various versions\nof predetermination or predelineation. In the background lie debates\nabout the relative significance of predestination and free will, for\npersons, for organic beings, or even for the inorganic. Furthermore\nsome authors saw epigenesis or preformation as entirely internally\ndirected, while others in each case allowed responses to the\nenvironment. In each case, it is important to keep in mind what the\nparticular writer was saying and the arguments presented. Thus,\ndiscussions of epigenesis and preformation often bring in other\nancillary questions and are difficult to separate from their contexts.\nThis essay is an effort to extract what is centrally at issue and to\nfocus on key contributions to the discussion. \n\nSolar systems can “evolve” and could develop\nepigenetically, at least in theory. Yet they are not thought of as\ndoing so, typically, and so the terms apply primarily to the organic\nworld. Species can evolve or develop more or less gradually, with more\nor less form already physically existing or programmed in from the\nbeginning. Yet typically discussions of epigenesis and preformation\nhave focused on individual organisms and their development rather than\non species. The emphasis is on different interpretations of the actual\ndevelopmental process as it plays out in time, rather than on the\nunderlying cause of development per se. \n\nTherefore, this essay focuses on individual organisms and\nunderstandings of their development processes. Even more specifically,\nthis means looking at the development of their form and to a lesser\nextent also function. Epigenesis and preformation offer two competing\ninterpretations of what is involved, with a range of alternatives in\nbetween. The two approaches draw on different metaphysical and\ndifferent epistemological sets of assumptions. We can get at the\ncentral issues by looking most closely at a series of focused\nepisodes. \n\nAristotle was a keen observer of many things, including embryos.\nLooking at chicks, for example, and drawing on his interpretations\ndeveloped earlier for the physical science, he saw material, final,\nformal, and efficient causes at work in developing individual\norganisms. The early egg was not formed. It was not already a little\nchick (or whatever the species). Instead, it gradually acquired form,\nonly gradually acquired a heart that began beating, only gradually\nacquired the other parts that make it a chick. The material may be\nthere from the beginning in the case of chicks, for example, but the\nformal cause only gradually plays out along with the efficient cause of\nembryonic development. \n\nThus, Aristotle could fit his observations of embryos perfectly well\nwithin his larger theoretical interpretations of the world. With\nsexually reproducing species, individual organisms begin when the\nfluids (or “semen”) from the mother and the father come\ntogether. This combines the essential causes and initiates the\ndevelopmental process. Gradually, over time, form begins to emerge from\nthe unformed. The maternal contribution is the material cause, which\nresides in the menstrual blood. After “the discharge is over and\nmost of it has passed off, then what remains begins to take shape as a\nfetus” [Aristotle 1979]. Yet the female semen or menstrual blood\nis only “that out of which it generates” and must be acted\nupon by the male semen which is “that which generates.”\nTogether, consistent with the essential nature of the species and telos\n(or final cause) in question, the formal cause and efficient causal\nprocess act to bring a formed individual organism from potential into\nactual being. The male and female parents serve as the\n“principles of generation,” and each individual organism\nbegins anew. \n\nFor Aristotle, the causes lie internal to the combined fluids rather\nthan outside. An individual life begins when the male and female semen\nare brought together. This is an external action and it starts the\nindividual developmental process in motion. From that point on, the\nprocess is internal and driven by internal causes. The process then\nleads to development of form of the individual's type, since\n“once a thing has been formed, it must of necessity grow”\n[Aristotle 1979, pp. 151-153, 157]. (See Lennox 2001 for discussion of\nAristotle's predecessors on these points; see Vinci and Robert\n2005, on Aristotle's development.) \n\nAn individual organic life requires a “soul” which must\nbe there from the outset and that resides within the material body.\nThis soul guides the gradual epigenetic process of development. This is\nthe Aristotelian and not the Christian soul. Soul consists of the\nvegetative (for all organisms), locomotory (for those organisms that\nmove, namely animals), and rational (for those organisms that think,\nnamely man). This soul resides in the combination of male and female\nsemen. The living differs from the dead because of the action of the\nsoul. Therefore, it is the teleological drive of the potential that\nactualizes the individual and its form and function, epigenetically,\ngradually, and internally. \n\nAristotelians followed Aristotle and without much further study of\nembryos interpreted development, including human development, as\ngradual and epigenetic. Traditional Catholicism agreed. St. Augustine\nand St. Thomas Aquinas both held that hominization, or the coming into\nbeing of the human, occurs only gradually. Quickening was thought to\noccur around 40 days, and to be the point at which the merely animal\nmix of material fluids was ensouled. Until 1859, when Pope Pius IX\ndecreed that life begins at “conception,” the Church was\nepigenetic along with the Aristotelians [see Maienschein 2003]. \n\nShirley Roe's discussion of the 18th century\ndebates provides the best understanding of the context. Enthusiasm for\nscientific study of natural phenomena of all sorts was combined with\nparticular interest in natural history and changes over time and with\nnewly available microscopic methods to stimulate interest in\ndevelopment [Roe 1971].  Aristotelian epigenesis still provided the\nbackground assumptions about individual development as the\n18th century began, and researchers sought to observe the\ngradual emergence of form from non-form. Yet Aristotelian accounts\ncalled for the efficacy of the causes, acting through the process of\nensoulment. In effect, this interpretation of epigenesis depended on a\nlife force within the organism driving its emergence of form. Those who\naccepted epigenesis also accepted a form of vitalism. \n\nMatter in motion, by itself, would not seem to have the capacity to\nproduce these results. How could matter become formed when it was not?\nHow could the emerging form acquire the capacity to function without\nsome vital force or factor that was not strictly material? This was the\nproblem for materialists. And as Roe explains quite nicely, the\n18th century brought those who would be materialists. Those\nwho began with a materialist metaphysic, assuming that all that can\nexist is matter in motion, could not see how gradual epigenetic\nemergence of form could occur. The 18th century brought\ndebates between those who started from metaphysical assumptions of\nmaterialism and those who started from epistemological assumptions that\nempirical observation should provide the basis for scientific\nknowledge. \n\nOne popular representation of the alternative, preformationist view\nwas with the homunculus. Whether initially intended seriously or as a\nway to capture alternative ideas, the idea of a tiny preformed little\nperson did capture attention. Nicolaas von Hartsoeker gave us the image\nin 1694 of a tiny man in the sperm, which became the starting point for\nspermists. Others, ovists, accepted the idea of a preformed form but\nplaced it in the egg. This was preformationism taken quite literally.\nThe form that the individual adult organism would assume was,\nphysically and materially, preformed from the earliest stages of\ndevelopment. From that point it just grew up. \n\nNot all preformationists took their preformationism quite so\nliterally or graphically, but it did present a competing alternative to\nAristotelian epigenesis by the 18th century [see\nPinto-Correia 1997; Bowler 1971]. As Iris Fry has argued in her study of\norigins of life debates, only with preformation could a materialistic\nmechanist be a good Christian in the 18th century [Fry\n2000, p. 26, citing Farley 1977 p. 29]. This debate played out, for\nexample, in the work of Caspar Friedrich Wolff and Charles Bonnet, both\nlooking at chick development. They looked at the same thing and even\nfundamentally agreed about what they saw, but their conclusions were\nquite different. This story can be seen as a debate about scientific\ntheory. Wolff was an epigenesist, maintaining that form emerges only\ngradually; Bonnet was a preformationist, insisting that form exists\nfrom the beginning of each individual organism and only experiences\ngrowth over time. In addition to these theoretical and epistemological\nissues, there is also a story about metaphysics. This story has been\ntold in detail elsewhere, and I need not repeat that exposition here.\nThe central point for our purposes is that the 18th century\nbrought debates between metaphysical materialists who were forced into\npreformationism, and epistemological epigenesists who observed from\nemerging only gradually and who were willing to accept vitalism as the\nonly apparent causal explanation for the emergence of form from the\nnot-formed [Roe 1981, Maienschein 2000]. \n\nIn 1859, Darwin focused on embryos and their usefulness for\nunderstanding evolutionary relationships. Ernst Haeckel brought the\nstudy of embryos to popular attention. And histologists and\nembryologists, especially in Germany and the United States, used\nrapidly improving microscopic techniques to observe far more than had\nbeen possible before. These observations, in the context of\nevolutionary interpretations, raised new questions and provoked new\nanswers. The understanding of both epigenesis and preformation\nunderwent transformation so that the debates brought new questions\nalong with the traditional differences. \n\nDarwin pointed to embryology as fundamental for interpreting\nhistorical relationships. In Chapter 13 of the Origin he asked\n“How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,\nnamely the very general, but not universal difference in structure\nbetween the embryo and the adult; of parts in the same individual\nembryo, which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse\npurposes, being at this early period of growth alike; of embryos of\ndifferent species within the same class, generally, but not\nuniversally, resembling each other; of the structure of the embryo not\nbeing closely related to its conditions of existence, except when the\nembryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for\nitself; of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organization\nthan the mature animal, into which it is developed.” But we know\nthat this was rhetorical question, and sure enough he concluded that\n“I believe that all these facts can be explained, as follows, on\nthe view of descent with modification.” And that furthermore,\n“the leading facts in embryology, which are second in importance\nto none in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight\nmodifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some one\nancient progenitor, at a very period of the life of each, though\nperhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding\nnot early period. Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus\nlook at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common\nparent-form of each great class of animals” [Darwin 1858, chapter\n13]. \n\nHaeckel saw “Ontogeny as the brief and rapid recapitulation of\nphylogeny” and saw each individual's development as\nfollowing the sequence of, and indeed caused by, the evolutionary\nhistory of that individual organism's species. In his highly\npopular books that were widely translated and widely read, Haeckel\noffered pictures of comparative embryology. “See,” he\nseemed to suggest, “the human form emerges following the\nevolutionary development and adaptations of its ancestors.” Form\ncomes from form of the ancestors, and unfolds following pre-scripted\nstages [Haeckel 1867]. \n\nDarwin was not an embryologist, and he did not contribute to our\nunderstanding of embryogenesis as such. Nor, really, did Haeckel. But\nwhile Darwin's use of the embryo in supporting evolutionary\ntheory and in helping to interpret evolutionary relationships was\nconsistent with various versions of either epigenetic or\npreformationist development, Haeckel's view was decidedly\npreformationist. Here, then, was a preformationist interpretation based\nnot on additional embryological observations but on adherence to\nHaeckel's own metaphysical adherence to both his monistic\nmaterialism and to his desire to provide evidence for evolution. The\nHaeckelian approach reflected the context in which those studying cells\nand embryos worked at the end of the 19th century. \n\nIn 1899, American biologist William Morton Wheeler suggested that\nthere are just two different kinds of thinkers. Some see change and\nprocess, while others see stability. Heraclitus, Aristotle, physiology,\nand epigenesis characterize one way of looking at the world, while\nParmenides, Plato, morphology, and preformationism characterizes\nanother. These are, Wheeler felt, stable and persistent classes, with\njust the nature and details of their differences have changed over\ntime. Yet by the end of the 19th century, he argued, neither\na strict preformationist nor a strict epigeneticist who ignored new\nevidence and new reasoning should prevail. Rather he called for a\nmiddle ground, for: “The pronounced ‘epigenecist’ of\nto-day who postulates little or no pre-determination in the germ must\ngird himself to perform Herculean labors in explaining how the complex\nheterogeneity of the adult organism can arise from chemical enzymes,\nwhile the pronounced ‘preformationist’ of to-day is bound\nto elucidate the elaborate morphological structure which he insists\nmust be present in the germ.” Furthermore, it is not to\nphilosophy but science that we must look to resolve the relative\ncontributions of each, for “Both tendencies will find their\ncorrectives in investigation” [Wheeler 1899, p. 284]. \n\nWheeler was stimulated by recent late 19th century debates,\nthemselves provoked by a flood of new discoveries. August Weismann and\nOscar Hertwig provided particularly strong and contrasting positions.\nWeismann had begun from an epigenetic viewpoint and initially rejected\nthe idea that individual form emerges through the unfolding, or\nevolution, of pre-existent form in the inherited germ. But by the time\nhis Das Keimplasm appeared in 1892 (translated into English in\n1893), Weismann had changed his mind. As Weismann wrote: \n\nHis “proof” provided an account of how, within the\ncontext of cell theory and given that the entire body begins in one\nfertilized cell, all the diverse body parts can become so diversely\ndifferentiated. The key is in the special material of the germ cells,\nWeismann decided. Within these cells lies all the determinants\nnecessary to direct development. Inheritance, that is, causes\ndevelopment and differentiation. \n\nWeismann's theory postulated the existence of several levels of\nhypothetical units. By the 1890s, it was agreed that individuals begin\nas cells, those cells contain nuclei, and that nuclei contain\nchromosomes. The chromosomes are the material of heredity, Weismann\npostulated, and they consist of a string of determinants, correlated\nwith characters in the organism. Each determinant consisted of a\nnumber of material particles called biophores, inherited from both\nparents.  These biophores compete with each other and some prevail,\nwhich then determines the character of the determinant, which in turn\ndetermines the character of the organism. During each cell division,\nthe original whole chromosomal material is divided up, so that the\neffect is like a mosaic. Each cell becomes the right type just because\nof the action of the determinants distributed to it. As Weismann put\nit, “Ontogeny, or the development of the individual, depends\ntherefore on a series of gradual qualitative changes in the nuclear\nsubstance of the egg-cell.” Cells are self-differentiating\n“that is to say, the fate of the cells is determined by forces\nsituated within them, and not by external influences” [Weismann\n1893, pp. 32, 134]. Conditions external to the cell itself cannot\nguide development, but rather the causes lie within. And cell\ndifferentiations that make up complex organisms are predetermined. \n\nOscar Hertwig disagreed. He felt that Weismann made too many\nassumptions and that he actually provided no real explanation of\ndevelopment and differentiation at all. In his work of 1894,\nPräformation oder Epigenese, Hertwig complained that\nWeismann's theory: \n\nIn contrast to Weismann's preformationism, Hertwig pointed to\nthe interactions of cells and to the differences among cells for the\nsource of differentiation. The complexity is not built in from the\nbeginning, but emerges over time, dynamically, and interactively. A\ncytologist himself, Hertwig saw the intricate structures already part\nof the unfertilized egg, and the changes that occur with fertilization.\nThe egg is not a completely unstructured blob, but rather a complex of\ndifferent materials that can respond to influences both within the egg\nand from the external environment. Cells behave like small organisms,\nand it is the interactions of these separate organisms that makes the\nwhole. As Hertwig put it: “I shall explain the gradual,\nprogressive organization of the whole organism as due to the influences\nupon each other of these numerous elementary organisms in each stage of\nthe development. I cannot regard the development of any creature as a\nmosaic work. I hold that all the parts develop in connection with each\nother, the development of each part always being dependent upon the\ndevelopment of the whole.” Furthermore, “during the course\nof development, there are forces external to the cells that bid them\nassume the individual characters appropriate to their individual\nrelations to the whole; the determining forces are not within the\ncells, as the doctrine of determinants supposed” [Hertwig 1900,\npp. 105-106, 138]. \n\nHertwig and Weismann continued to argue both about the metaphysical\nnature of the organism as well as about the epistemological demands\nfor gaining knowledge about it, as did others, with no generally\naccepted way to resolve the issues. Given the information at hand, it\nseemed that Wheeler was right. There were just two different types of\npeople, drawing on two different sets of values and emphases. Both\nrelied on assumptions, and only more evidence could help move the\ndiscussion forward. \n\nWilhelm Roux adopted much the same approach as Weismann's and\nso, at first, did Hans Driesch. Yet their experiments ultimately led to\nnew approaches and revised interpretations of what was at issue with\nepigenesist and preformationist accounts of development. In 1888, Roux\npublished results of his experiments on frog eggs. Working on the\nassumption of a mosaic type preformationism, Roux was persuaded that\nstarting from the very first cell division, each cell would be\ndifferent because it was already predetermined to be different. \n\nRoux proposed an experiment, a simple and elegant experiment on the\nface of it. He proposed to take a developing frog egg, after the first\ncell division, and to separate the two cells. Finding it impossible to\nseparate the two cells, however, he simply killed one by inserting a\nhot needle. That cell just hung there like a blob of material and no\nlonger differentiated. The other half organism, or single cell\nproceeded to develop, in Roux's interpretation, as it normally would\nhave developed [Roux 1888]. The half became a half, just as it should\nif it were already preformed or predetermined as to its fate in the\norganism. Roux had, it seemed, confirmed the mosaic hypothesis. \n\nA few years later, Driesch was working at Naples and had access to sea\nurchin eggs. Fortunately, because of Oscar and his brother Richard\nHertwig's study of these eggs, Driesch knew that if he shook the two\ncells they would separate completely. Driesch reported agreeing with\nRoux and intending to confirm Roux's results. But since the sea urchin\neggs could actually be separated, he felt that his results would be\neven more convincing. Imagine his surprise when he looked the next\nmorning after separating the eggs and found not two half embryos but\ntwo smaller sized urchin larvae. As he noted, “I must confess\nthat the idea of a free-swimming hemisphere or a half gastrula open\nlengthwise seemed rather extraordinary. I thought the formations would\nprobably die.” Not so. “Instead, the next morning I found\nin their respective dishes typical, actively swimming blastulae of\nhalf size” [Driesch 1892].  In later experiments they developed\neven further, into apparently perfectly normal pluteus larvae, and\neven the four cell stage could do the same. \n\nDriesch concluded with an epigenetic account, but an epigenesis\nrelying strictly on materialistic factors (at least that was his\ninitial response; Driesch did turn later to a version of vitalism). The\nearly embryo retains its totipotency, he concluded. The fertilized egg\nclearly has the capacity to become a whole organism and so, apparently,\ndo the cells after the early cell divisions. Not a mosaic of cells\nalready predetermined by their inherited determinants in the nucleus,\nthe early embryonic stages are instead a population of separate\ntotipotent organisms, each capable of becoming a whole. It is only the\ninteractions among them under normal conditions that lead to a complex,\norganized, integrated differentiated organism. \n\nIt might seem that Roux would have to acknowledge the superiority of\nDriesch's approach, since he had actually separated the cells.\nBut no. Instead Roux countered with an additional hypothesis. The\nnucleus retains the capacity to adapt, especially in simpler organisms.\nThey need the capacity to regenerate when injured, and therefore the\nmosaic determination simply has not occurred yet. Each cell retains a\n“reserve idioplasm,” he argued, and this provides the\nnecessary backup determination needed to form a whole organism [see\nChurchill 1966, 1973].  \n\nIt seems that Wheeler was right. Roux, Weismann, and others had\ndecided that development must be guided by predetermined mosaic\ndifferences. Preformation, stability, and predictability stood on one\nside, with epigenesis, dynamic process, and change on the other. And,\nas Wheeler noted, by 1899 the way forward lay between the extremes of\nstrict preformation or epigenesis. Wheeler's dissertation\ndirector Charles Otis Whitman agreed. Whitman felt that what biology\nneeded was a clear statement of the alternative views, and then\nmovement to a new standpoint examining how much depends on the\norganism's developmental response to external conditions drawing\non preformation, rather than on programmed internal unfolding\nalone. \n\nWhitman, Edmund Beecher Wilson, and others at the Marine Biological\nLaboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, dedicated considerable energy\nto discovering the nature of each cell and its internal organization\nand relationships, in an attempt to discover the relative contributions\nof preformation and epigenetic development to a materialistic\nexplanation of development. By the early 20th century, they\nhad moved toward an understanding that included a fertilized egg that\nwas to some extent preorganized and differentiated, including in the\nnuclear chromosomes, and also a capacity of the individual organism to\nrespond to changes in its environment or to self-regulate. This was an\nepigenetic view that allowed some minimal predeterminism. \n\nThe epigenetic embryologists emphasized the individual's\ndevelopment, but an alternative new form of preformationism soon arose\nin the form of genetics. This pointed to the nuclear chromosomes as the\nlocus for the causes of differentiation. Yet unlike Weismann and Roux,\nthe new geneticists saw the genetic material not as divided up into a\nmosaic as an explanation of difference. Rather, the inherited nuclear\nmaterial was the same in every cell, but it acted differently according\nto an internal program. The interpretation appealed to some for\nmetaphysical reasons, since it focused on the material units of\nheredity and apparently of causation. Epistemologically, it was more\ndifficult to point to the evidence that inherited genes explain\ndevelopment. \n\nThis is not the place for a history of genetics, which has been\noffered many times elsewhere. The important point here is that genetics\nbrought a new form of preformationism. Instead of a dynamically acting\norganism taking its cues from the environmental conditions and from the\nway that cells interact with each cell division, the 20th\ncentury brought a dominant and popular view that has often emphasized\ngenes as programmed to carry the information of heredity, which was\nalso the information necessary to construct an individual. Of course,\nthere have been calls for alternatives or interactionist models where\nheredity and development, epigenesist and preformation, work together,\nbut these have often been offered as alternatives than as central\ninterpretations. [See, for example, Oyama 2000; Robert 2004.] \n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, at first Thomas\nHunt Morgan resisted the Mendelian-chromosome theory of inheritance\nthat saw inherited units of heredity carried on chromosomes as\ndeterminants of developed characters. If all the cells contain the same\nchromosomes, then how can their inheritance explain anything, he asked.\nInstead, he insisted that “We have two factors determining\ncharacters: heredity and the modification during development”\n[Morgan 1910a, p. 477].  Morgan wrote to a friend that “my field is\nexperimental embryology”and not the genetics with which he became\nassociated [Morgan 1908]. Like his Woods Hole colleagues, Morgan did\nnot see how inherited chromosomes could explain development of form\nfrom non-form. He had rejected Weismann's interpretations, and\ncontinued to reject the idea of inherited determinants. \n\nAlso in 1910, however, he was studying many different kinds of\norganisms in pursuit of explanations of heredity as well as\ndifferentiation. A white eyed male Drosophila fly famously\ncaught his attention, and led him to the conclusion that some inherited\nfactors must, indeed, cause expression in the emerging organism\n[Morgan 1910b]. It is not that Morgan changed his mind about how to do\nscience, but rather that the evidence carried him in new directions\n[Maienschein 1991]. \n\nThe fertilized egg cell contains a nucleus made up of chromosomes\ninherited from both parents. Along these chromosomes are lined up units\nof heredity that serve like Weismann's determinants and that were\ncalled genes. These genes correlate with some characters in the\nresulting organism, and therefore in some sense the resulting form was\npredetermined in the egg. Yet it was not already formed. And, indeed,\nthe mere correlation of genes and characters tells us virtually nothing\nabout how the differentiation occurs nor about how form becomes formed\n(or the problem of morphogenesis). Therefore, yes, genetics brings a\nsort of new preformation or more accurately predeterminism. But that in\nitself brings a description and a correlation but no explanation. Or so\nMorgan initially felt, as did his embryologist colleagues. \n\nBy mid 20th century, and especially after the discovery of\nDNA's structure (which apparently also explained its function),\nresearchers began to forget or at least to ignore questions about\nmorphogenesis and epigenesis. [See, for example, Olby 1974, Judson\n1979.] How, actually, did genes give rise to differentiated form?\nSomehow that works, seemed to be the answer. Genetics predominated\nover what C.H. Waddington referred to as the epigenetics of\ndevelopment  [Waddington 1942]. Of course not everyone ignored\ndevelopment, but it became a seriously neglected field and even\nprofessional societies and journals that had focused on\n“embryology” shifted to “developmental\ngenetics” [Oppenheimer 1967]. When Robert Briggs and Thomas King\ncloned frogs in the 1950s and John Gurdon extended the research in the\n1960s, it seemed that nuclear transfer could come from only early\nstages of development. Furthermore the resulting clones were like\ntheir donors from whom the nuclei came rather than like the mothers\nfrom whom the eggs came [Briggs and King 1952, Gurdon and Colman\n1999, McLaren 2000]. Apparently development brings differentiation that\nis unidirectional. Preformationist/ predeterminist thinking\nprevailed. Epigenetic development and regulatory response to\nenvironmental conditions seemed to have strict limits for those\nadopting the mid 20th century predeterminist emphasis. \n\nThe end of the 20th century brought discoveries that have\nchallenged the most the prevailing geneticism, and have also begun to\nreplace the extreme forms of either preformationism or epigenesist with\nthe sorts of interactionist models that were only offered as outlying\nalternatives in earlier decades. A modified form of epigenesis, in\nwhich the organism is seen as beginning from an inherited egg and sperm\nthat do include genes, seems to be on the rise again. Ian\nWilmut's team's success in cloning Dolly, reported in 1997,\nand Gearhart and Thomson's successes with developing human stem\ncell lines, both reported in 1998, challenged prevailing assumptions\n[Wilmut 2000, Thomson 1998, Shamblott et al. 1998, Gearhart 1998]. Both\nsuggested that development is a good deal more flexible, plastic, and\ninteractive than preformationist interpretations allow. \n\nStem cell research is exciting precisely because the fate of cells\nturns out to be not determined by the genes. At the early stages of\ndevelopment when embryonic stem cells are most plentiful, in the\nblastocyst stage just before implantation, the stem cells can be\nharvested and cultured to become a large number of different kinds of\ncells. In theory, they have the capacity to become any kind of\ndifferentiated cell, but it is impossible to prove that conclusively.\nNormally, each cell does become one kind of cell rather than all kinds.\nPosition in the organism and with respect to other cells seems to be\ndecisive in directing differentiation. Yes, genetics provides\ninformation about the range of possibilities. But clearly, regulation\nof the genetic expression involves interpretation. And this is\nepigenetic. It seems that those were right who called for a middle\nground, with some predetermination that interacts with some form of\nepigenetic development. Perhaps it is as Thomas Hunt Morgan suggested,\n“a process of pure epigenetic development, as generally\nunderstood nowadays, may also be predetermined in the egg”\n[Morgan 1901, p. 968]. The nowadays of the 21st century may\ntake us back to some of the understanding and insights of the early\n20th, a time when a balance of epigenesis and preformation\nseemed likely, a time for a bit of predeterminism and a bit of cellular\nfree will."}]
