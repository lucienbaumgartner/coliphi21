His work survives only in\nfragments, either as excerpts or in reports in later sources, mostly\nPlatonists, both pagan and Christian (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus,\nCalcidius, Origen, Eusebius). Numenius' work is important both\nhistorically and philosophically. Its historical significance lies\nmainly in that it shows how much of Plotinus' philosophy, especially\nPlotinus' metaphysics, was inspired by earlier Platonists such as\nNumenius, who was one of the authors read in Plotinus' seminar\n(Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 14.12).  Plotinus' debt to\nNumenius' philosophy was much debated already by Platonists of\nPlotinus' generation (ibid. 18.2–3, 17.1–23). This\ndiscussion shows that Plotinus was not considered in his own time to\nhave initiated a new and distinct movement in Platonism—what we\ntoday call Neoplatonism. He was rather seen as simply continuing and\ndeveloping the philosophy of previous Platonists, Numenius being\nprominent among them, just as they themselves had developed in similar\nfashion the work of their own Platonist predecessors. Numenius'\nsignificance also lies in his impact on the thought of early Christian\nthinkers like Origen and Eusebius, who are captured by Numenius'\nreferences to Hebrews and see in his theology a prefiguration of their\ntrinitarian doctrine. Philosophically, Numenius' work is important\nbecause he, like Eudorus and Moderatus (1st c. CE), tried\nto construct a hierarchical system of intelligible principles\n(archai) of reality, but unlike them he held that\nintelligible principles are responsible only for the order of the\nworld, wherein its goodness lies, while matter has an existence\nindependent of these principles and accounts for disorder and\nbadness. In this sense Numenius maintains a dualism in metaphysics\nthat has affinities with that of Plutarch. Numenius' system of three\nprinciples of reality, similar to Plotinus' hypostases of One,\nIntellect and Soul, was constructed on the basis of accounts of the\nintelligible world and its primacy, and of the soul as a spiritual\nsubstance essentially related to that world, in Plato. More\nspecifically, it results from reflection on the Form of the Good in\nRepublic VI, the demiurge and the world-soul of the\nTimaeus, and the One of the Parmenides. The\nhierarchical order of these principles of reality is determined by the\ndegree of unity and simplicity of each; the highest principle is the\nsimplest and most completely a unity. It is also absolutely good and transmits goodness.\n\n\n\nVery little is known about Numenius' life. The existing evidence\nassociates Numenius with two cities, Apamea in Syria and Rome.\nPlotinus' student, Amelius, who was an enthusiastic admirer of\nNumenius (Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 3.44–5), calls him\n“Apamean” (ibid. 17.18) and himself moved from Rome to\nApamea after Plotinus' death (ibid. 2.32–33). John Lydus\n(6th c. CE), however, refers to Numenius as “the\nRoman” (De mensibus ΙV.80, p. 132.11–12\nWünsch). The strong interest that both Amelius and Porphyry take\nin Numenius makes the evidence about Numenius in Porphyry's Life\nof Plotinus quite significant, but the testimony of John Lydus\nmay also hold some truth. One possible way of reconciling the two is\nthat Numenius was born in Apamea but taught both there and later also\nin Rome (Dodds 1960, 6–7). \nSeveral indications point to a date around the middle of the\n2nd century CE for Numenius' philosophical activity.  There\nis good evidence to suggest that Numenius antedates the Platonist\nAtticus, whose floruit is set around 176 (Eusebius,\nChronicle, p. 207 Helm): Proclus in his 5th-c. CE\nCommentary on the Timaeus outlines in chronological order the\nviews of ancient Platonists on the relation of the demiurge (the\ncreator god of the Timaeus myth) to the Forms, presenting\nfirst those of Numenius, then of Harpocration and Atticus, then of\nPlotinus, Amelius, Porphyry and Iamblichus (In Timaeum\nI.303.27–307.19). The chronological order is disturbed only by\nthe place of Harpocration (a pupil of Atticus) in the list, but this\nis because the latter follows Numenius rather than Atticus in his\ninterpretation of the way the demiurge relates to the Forms (Proclus,\nIn Timaeum I.304.22–305.16; on this matter see below,\nMetaphysics). Furthermore, a number of indications suggest Atticus'\nown dependence on Numenius. Atticus' work targeting those who profess\nto teach Plato's philosophy through the use of the writings of\nAristotle (Atticus frs. 1–9 Des Places) may well be inspired\nfrom Numenius' plea for a purification of Plato's philosophy from\nalien elements, Aristotelian and Stoic included.  Numenius argues for\nthis purification in his work On the Dissension of the Academics\nfrom Plato (Numenius fr. 24–28 Des Places). The resemblance\nbetween the relevant works of Atticus and Numenius extends to details:\nthe analogy of Plato's philosophy with the body of Pentheus torn apart\nby the Bacchai, that is found in Atticus (fr. 1.19–23 Des\nPlaces) goes back to Numenius (fr. 24.71–73), and so does the\ncomparison of the 3rd c. BCE Academic skeptic Arcesilaus'\nsuspension of judgment (epochê) to the cuttle fish\nspreading ink (Numenius fr. 25.77-81; cf. Atticus fr. 7.78-81).\nAtticus however presents Plato as the one who unified philosophy by\nputting together its dispersed parts, while Numenius implies that\nPlato combined parts which were belonging to the same body,\ni.e. Pythagorean philosophy. Also Numenius makes Arcesilaus resemble\nthe cuttle fish, in order to highlight his skeptic suspension of\njudgment as an escaping device, while Atticus applies this analogy to\nAristotle whose philosophy he criticizes as obscure. Numenius' dating\nin the middle 2nd century is compatible with two further\nfacts: the first surviving author who mentions Numenius is Clement of\nAlexandria (ca. 150–215) in his Stromata\n(I.22.150.4). Clement cites Numenius asking rhetorically what is Plato\nbut an atticizing Moses, a citation that Eusebius takes up\n(Praep. Ev. XI.10.14, fr. 8; on this see below,\nInfluence). The second fact that pertains to Numenius' dating is that\nthe latest author our fragments of Numenius mention is Mnaseas\n(fr. 25.17), the “methodist” doctor of the 1st\nc. CE. \nWe are fortunate to know the titles of some of Numenius'\ntreatises. One was On the Good, which comprised at least 6\nbooks (Eusebius, Preparatio Evangelica XI.18.22). Apparently,\nthis was one of Numenius' most important works and judging from the\nexisting excerpts, it must have been cast in dialogical form (see\nfrs. 3, 4a; cf. Edwards 2010, 118-120). In it Numenius set out to\noutline his ontology and theology and, more specifically, to\ninvestigate the nature of the first principle, which is divine, the\ncause of everything, and the source of goodness (hence the title\nOn the Good). Numenius is clearly inspired by Plato's\naccounts of the Form of the Good in Republic VI (508e-509b)\nand of the one concerning the goodness of the demiurge in the\nTimaeus (29e-30b), yet, as I will explain below, he did not\nidentify the demiurge with the Form of the Good. Also important must\nhave been Numenius' work On the Indestructibility of the Soul\n(Origen, Against Celsus V.57; fr. 29), in at least two\nbooks. We know of only one certain fragment of this work, but it is\nprobable that many of the testimonies of later Platonists regarding\nNumenius' views on the soul reflect claims made in it (Dillon 1977,\n364) (see below, Psychology). Quite unclear, however, remains the\ncontent of Numenius' treatise On Plato's Secret Doctrines\n(Eusebius, Prep.  Ev. XIII.4.4; fr. 23). In the sole\nsurviving fragment (fr. 23) Numenius discusses Plato's use of the\ncharacter Euthyphro in the Euthyphro as representative of\nAthenian popular religion.  Dillon (1977, 364) has speculated that in\nthis work Numenius proposed allegorical interpretations of aspects of\nPlatonic dialogues. This seems plausible since Numenius appears to\nhave indulged in allegorical interpretation of the cultic practices of\nvarious nations, taking them to be philosophically significant\n(fr. 1a; see below, Numenius' Platonism). But given Numenius'\nattachment to Pythagoreanism (on which see below, Numenius' Platonism)\nit may also be the case that in this work Numenius presented doctrines\nthat Platonists traditionally associated with Plato, such as the\nimmortality of the soul, as originally Pythagorean (see Dillon 1988,\n121). \n\nNumenius' best attested work is his treatise On the Dissension of\nthe Academics from Plato (frs. 24–28). The Christian writer\nEusebius in his Preparatio Evangelica (Preparation for\nthe Gospel) has excerpted five long pieces from it (in book\nXIV). Eusebius quotes so extensively from this work in order to\nsubstantiate his claim, which permeates the entire Preparatio\nEvangelica, that ancient philosophers were in disagreement with\neach other. He takes that feature to indicate the inability of pagan\nphilosophy to reach the truth. This is an originally skeptic argument,\nthat is employed by Academic and Pyrrhonean skeptics alike, to the\neffect that dogmatic philosophy amounts to failure because of the\ndisagreements occurring in it (Cicero, Academica II.115,\nSextus Empiricus, Against the Mathematicians II.11). Eusebius\nhas a special kind of disagreement in mind, namely that with Plato's\nphilosophy, which he considers to have come closer to the truth than\nany other pagan philosophy (Prep. Ev. XI.pref. 2-3, XI.8.1,\nXIII.4.3). Numenius' testimony fits well an argument like that of\nEusebius. For Numenius criticizes in this work the departure of the\nskeptical Academics from what he considers to be Plato's doctrine,\nnamely, the doctrine of first principles of reality that Numenius\nfinds adumbrated in the 2ndLetter attributed to\nPlato (fr.  24.51–6). For Numenius it is primarily the\ndisagreement of the Academic skeptics with Plato's allegedly dogmatic\nphilosophy that marks a failure. The surviving fragments of his work\nindicate Numenius' strong concern with the history of Platonism and\nare quite telling as to the tendencies of Platonism at his\ntime. Numenius' reaction against a skeptical interpretation of Plato\nmay have been triggered by attempts chronologically close to him, such\nas those by Anonymus in Theaetetum (1st c. CE?),\nPlutarch, and Favorinus (1st-2nd c. CE), to\nrevive a form of academic skepticism (see Opsomer 1998). Three other\nworks of Numenius, namely Epops, On Numbers, On place\n(Origen, Against Celsus IV.51; fr. 1c), were consulted by\nOrigen but are only titles to us (see Zambon 2002, 180-181). \n\nThe remains of Numenius' work leave no doubt that he relied primarily\non texts of Plato in constructing his own system of\nprinciples. Ancient testimonies are, however, divided between those\nthat classify him as a Platonist philosopher (Porphyry, Life of\nPlot. 14.12, Eusebius, Prep. Ev. XI.21.7) and those that\nconsider him a Pythagorean (Origen, Against Celsus I.15, VI.51, V.38\nfrs. 1b–1c, 53, Porphyry, Ad Gaurum 34.20–35.2;\nfr. 36, Calcidius, In Timaeum 297.8 Waszink; fr. 52.2). We\nshould not see any contradiction or even tension in this double\nclassification. Numenius is a Pythagorean Platonist like Moderatus\nhalf a century earlier or Eudorus around the turn of the\nmillenium. That is, Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the\ntwo authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded\nPlato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he\nconsidered to be the source of all true philosophy—including\nPlato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many\nphilosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed\non only orally (cf. fr. 24.57-60). \n\nThis view of Numenius is part of a general view about the history of\nphilosophy that we can reconstruct from his fragments.  Numenius\nbelieves that the truths given to us by philosophy have a status like\nthat claimed for the scriptures by revealed religions: they are the\nrevelation of logos (reason) in which all nations have a\nshare (frs. 1a, 1b) but which only certain inspired geniuses could\narticulate properly and explain for the first time. Numenius appears\nto believe that the religious practices of the various nations are\nphilosophically significant, because they contain some lore or\n“wisdom” that reflects philosophical truth. We find a\nsimilar view first in Posidonius (1st c. BCE) (in Seneca,\nEpist. 90.5-13, 20-25, 30-32; fr. 284 Edelstein-Kidd) and\nthen it appears in variations in several authors of the first two\ncenturies CE. The Platonist Celsus, for instance, who must have been\nNumenius' contemporary, wrote a work entitled True Account,\nin which he criticizes Christianity for deviating from the fundamental\noriginal wisdom that he takes to lie behind the religions of many\nnations (Origen, Against Celsus I.14, 16; see Frede 1994,\n5193–5198). A similar view is maintained by Plutarch\n(fr. 157.16–25 Sandbach; cf. his On Isis and Osiris)\nbut also by the 1st c. CE Stoic Cornutus in his\nIntroduction to Greek Theology (see Boys-Stones 2001,\n49–59, 105–114).  \n\nNumenius maintains that in the Greek tradition the revelation coming\nfrom reason was first grasped and articulated in properly\nphilosophical terms by Pythagoras, the source of true philosophy; it\nthen found its way into the philosophy of Plato. Numenius argues that\nPlato appropriated Pythagoras' doctrine and outlined it in his own\nwork (fr. 24.56–62). He suggests that Plato accessed Pythagorean\nphilosophy directly, presumably through his own acquaintance with\nPythagoreans, but also indirectly through Socrates, who, according to\nNumenius, was also philosophically a Pythagorean and was communicating\nto his pupils Pythagorean doctrines (fr 24.51–59), most\nespecially the doctrine of the three gods, that is, the One,\nIntellect, and the creator-demiurge (see below, Metaphysics), which is\nallegedly outlined in the pseudo-Platonic\n2ndLetter (312e). Numenius suggests that Plato\nwas in a position to recognize Socrates' Pythagoreanism because,\nbefore meeting him, Plato had already familiarized himself with\nPythagorean philosophy (fr. 24.57). On Numenius' view, then, Plato\nspeaks with authority in his many and extensive published works\nprecisely because he communicates Pythagorean doctrines. But to the\nextent that Plato's philosophy is derivative from the Pythagorean one,\nthe authority of Plato's written work is inferior to that of\nPythagoras (frs. 7.5–7, 26.12–22). This is why Numenius\nrecommends a move away from Plato towards the discourses of Pythagoras\n(fr. 1a). Numenius appears to claim even that Plato was not\nfaultless. Plato, Numenius suggests, did not present his doctrines\nsufficiently clearly.  This is why Numenius holds Plato partly\nresponsible for the departure of later Platonists (i.e. the Academic\nskeptics) from Plato's actual Pythagorean philosophy\n(fr. 24.60–66; Karamanolis 2006, 130–131). Plato's\nobscurity is pointed out by several other Platonists in late\nantiquity, such as Plutarch (On Isis and Osiris\n370E-F, On the Obsolescence of the oracles 421F) and Plotinus\n(Ennead IV.4.22.6-12), but none of them means this to be a\ncriticism of Plato, as is the case with Numenius, whose point is that\nPlato did not make sufficiently clear his intellectual debt to\nPythagoreanism and that this may have played a role in the dissension of\nhis followers in the Academy. \nNumenius continues the line of Eudorus and especially Moderatus of\nGadeira (1st c. CE), who also considered Plato to be a\nPythagorean in his philosophical commitments. But unlike Moderatus\n(Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras 53) and other Pythagoreans (see\ne.g. Photius, Bibliotheca cod. 249, 438b14–19) who\nconsidered also later philosophers, such as Aristotle, as\nPythagoreans, Numenius apparently maintains that nobody after Plato\nhad access to the Pythagorean wisdom. This tension among Pythagoreans\nis indicative of a vivid debate they were having about the sources on\nwhich one can rely for the reconstruction of Pythagorean\nphilosophy. This debate in turn is characterestic of a strong revival\nof the Pythagorean philosophy in the first two centuries CE. This\nrevival becomes manifest in a series of Pythagorean pseudepigrapha of\nthe same age. These are treatises which pass themselves off as written\nin ancient times and as communicating Pythagorean lore (see Centrone\n1990). It can also be seen in the attempt of Moderatus to present\nPythagorean doctrines systematically in his Pythagorean\nteachings (Pythagorikai scholai; Stephanus of Byzantius\ns.v. Gadeira, and Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras 48;\nKaramanolis 2006, 132–134). \nThe stress on Plato's Pythagoreanism on the part of Pythagoreans\nrevives and extends connections between Plato's metaphysics and\nPythagorean ideas noted already by Plato's younger associates.\nAlready Aristotle saw these connections (e.g. Metaphysics\nA.6, M.3, N.3). That early Academics like Xenocrates showed strong\ninterest in Pythagoras' doctrines is presumably because they took them\nto be present in, or close to, Plato’s. They even wrote\ntreatises on them (e.g. Diogenes Laertius IV.13). We hear that Plato\nwas accused of having copied the Timaeus from Philolaus' book\n(Diogenes Laertius VIII.85) and in the 3rd c. BCE Timon of\nPhlius parodied Plato for this (Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae\nIII.17.4). The renewed emphasis on the Timaeus in the work of\nPlatonists of the first centuries CE, which we can attribute already\nto Eudorus (see Dillon 1977, 117–121), is closely associated\nwith the revival of Pythagorean Platonism. Platonists considered\nthe Timaeus to communicate Pythagorean doctrine and even\nargued that it was inspired by the work of “Timaeus\nLocrus”, a late forgery in pseudo-Doric dialect (cf. Proclus, In\nTimaeum I.7.17-8.29).  Numenius is following ample precedent in\nassigning a central role to the Timaeus for deriving a system\nof first principles on the basis of Plato's metaphysics (Baltes 1975,\n241–242). His interest in numbers (he wrote a work on numbers),\nto which he assigns an ontological role (fr. 2.20-24) may well be for\nhim another Pythagorean doctrine that Plato had taken over (see Staab\n2002, 99–100). \n\nThe existing evidence about Numenius suggests that he was strongly\nconcerned with metaphysics. His metaphysical views can be distinguished\ninto ontological and theological ones. The remains of his treatise\nOn the Good show, however, that these two sets of views were closely\nlinked together.  Numenius defines the subject matter of this treatise\nas an investigation of the question what is being (fr. 3.1, fr. 5.5,\nfr.  7.12–13), which is reminiscent of Aristotle's definition of\nfirst philosophy, or metaphysics,\nin Metaphysics Gamma (1003a20–32). Quite\nnotably, however, Numenius declares that he will be guided in his\ninvestigation by the Timaeus (referring to\nTimaeus 27d-28a; fr. 7.8-12). In line with\nthe Timaeus, Numenius treats the Good, the highest principle,\nas well as the lower principles of reality that he introduces, as\ngods. \nNumenius maintains a sharp distinction between the sensible and the\nintelligible world—the realms of becoming and (true or pure)\nbeing respectively (fr. 16.8–10). In his On the Good he\nproceeds in an ontologically ascending order, starting with sensible\n(physical) entities, moving to the intelligible ones (including\nPlatonic Forms), and finally to the first principle, the Good, that is\nthe Platonic Form of the Good in the Republic (508e) that he\nidentifies with God (that is, the first and highest god). Arriving at\nthis divine first principle is the final aim of the treatise. This is\nunderstandable since according to Numenius everything that exists in\nthe world as it is, depends on the Good, the God, which is the cause\nof everything's goodness in the world (fr. 19.5-7). Beginning his\ninvestigation from natural elements (stoicheia), namely\nearth, fire, water, and air (cf. Timaeus 31b-c), Numenius\nargues that no such element can possibly qualify as a being (as having\nbeing), first because elements, like syllables, cannot exist by\nthemselves but only in combination, and secondly because no bodily\nentity whatever can qualify as a being (as having being), because\nbodies are subject to change (fr.  3.1–8). This means that all\nbodies have, at best, being-and-not-being (cf. Republic\n479c). What is more, Numenius suggests that for a body to exist, there\nmust be something to keep it together and account for its unity\n(fr. 4b.11-19), and this cannot be a further body but rather must be a\npower (dynamis; fr. 4b18), that is an intelligible entity,\nfor instance a soul, which is necessary to account for the unity of\nbodies, as we see that it does for living things (fr. 4b). In the\nTimaeus (33b), for instance, it is made clear that it is the\nworld-soul that keeps the body of the world together. \n\nSuch an argument shows that Numenius has strong views about the\nontological status of matter, the basis, he supposes, of all bodies\n(fr. 4b.25). In his 4th c. CE Latin commentary on the\nTimaeus Calcidius presents a long discussion about the status\nof matter (In Timaeum p. 297.7-301.20 Waszink), claiming that\nthis is based on Numenius (fr. 52.2). If Numenius did elaborate on the\nstatus of matter along the lines suggested in Calcidius, that must be\nbecause it was crucial to do so for his argument about what qualifies\nas being and also how the world has come into existence.  Interpreting\nthe Timaeus literally, Numenius maintains that matter has\nnever come into existence but is co-eternal with, and yet distinct\nfrom, God (fr. 52.7–14; cf. Alcinous, Didascalicus ch.\n12, 166.15–30 Hermann), unlimited (apeiros), indefinite\n(aoristos), without form and quality (fr. 52.6–14,\n44–45; cf. Antiochus in Cicero, Academica II.27,\nAlcinous, Didascalicus 163.6 Hermann). Numenius like other\nPlatonists of his age follows Aristotle in identifying Plato's\nreceptacle in the Timaeus with matter, which Aristotle\ncharacterizes as non being (Physics 192a3-14), formless and\nqualiteless (De caelo 306b17-19; cf. Timaeus\n50d7). This lack of form of matter amounts to lack of reason for\nNumenius (alogos; fr. 4a.1–4). In the same vein already\nPlutarch (De Iside 374C f.) identified matter with Poverty\n(penia that is informed by Abundance (poros), giving\na cosmological twist in Plato's myth in the Symposium (203B\nf.). Since matter is lacking reason, Numenius considers it in itself\ndisordered (ataktos) and unknowable\n(fr. 4.4–5). Because disorder and division were taken to be\nessential characteristics of matter in the earlier Platonist\ntradition, matter had been identified with the indefinite\n“dyad” that is referred to in Aristotle's account\nof Plato's metaphysics (cf. Plato, Parmenides 149d2; see\nBaltes 1975, 255–6). This was widely maintained among the\nPythagorean Platonists (Sextus Empiricus, Against the\nMathematicians 10.261), including Eudorus (Simpicius, In\nPhysica 181.7–30, 281.5) and Moderatus\n(ibid. 231.8–9; see Frede 1987, 1052). Numenius follows\nprecisely this line of thought (frs. 11.15, 52.6). And since for\nNumenius disorder amounts to badness, he considers matter to be bad,\nthe source and cause of all instances of badness and disorder in the\nworld (fr. 52.37–9, 63–64). Numenius might appear to\nmaintain that disordered matter (cf. Timaeus 30a) is animated\nby an evil world soul (fr. 52.64–5), as might be suggested in\nLaws 10 (896e) (cf. Plutarch, De animae procreatione in\nTimaeo 1014D). However, Calcidius' text, which preserves this\nview of Numenius, suggests instead that matter is not animated by, but\nsomehow simply is the evil world soul, that is, matter has life of its\nown (fr.  52.44–47, 66–67; see Baltes 1975, 247–248\nbut also Deuse, 1983, 68–73, Phillips 2002, 237).  This is\npresumably because a soul, if it animates anything, cannot be really\nevil in doing so, as it is the principle of life. And life is one kind\nof order and thus good (see Waszink 1966, 68–9, Baltes 1975,\n250–251, Frede 1987, 1053). The fact that for Numenius matter is\nbad, however, does not necessarily entail that the material world is\nalso bad, as Dillon (1977, 369) suggests, associating Numenius with\nthe Gnostic idea of an evil world. It actually seems that quite the\nopposite is the case: for Numenius the world is good because it is\nordered due to the dominance of the highest principle, the Good. \n\nNow, for Platonists only intelligible entities can account for order\nwhich amounts to goodness. A Platonic Form, for instance, is\nresponsible for the ordered existence of the physical things it is the\nForm of. A soul too accounts for the existence of living things, such\nas animals. Since the world has an order of its own as a single\nwell-ordered whole, there must be such an intelligible entity that\naccounts for the world's order, wherein its goodness or orderliness\nlies (kosmos). Being the source of this comprehensive\ngoodness, this must itself be surpassingly good (frs. 16.14–15,\n19, 20).  Platonists tended to identify this principle with the Form\nof the Good in the Republic (508e), which is the source of\nall being. It was also traditional among them to think of this\nprinciple as a divine one or unit—God. \n\nNumenius, then, distinguishes two sources of reality, or two\nontological principles, God-the Good and matter (inspired by\nTimaeus 47e-48a and Aristotle's report about Plato's\nprinciples in Metaphysics 988a7–15). Yet the crucial\nquestion for Numenius was how one should think about this divine\nprinciple, the Good, what kind of God this is. Numenius' position on\nthis has much to do with his view on matter. Numenius advocates a\nstrong dualistic position. In this he is like Plutarch and later\nAtticus follows them.  Numenius' dualism is different from that of\nmost contemporary Pythagoreans we know of, like those referred to by\nAlexander Polyhistor (in Diogenes Laertius VIII.25), by Sextus\nEmpiricus (Against the Mathematicians X.261–2), by\nNicomachus of Gerasa (Theologia Arithmêtikê in\nPhotius, Bibliotheca cod. 187, 143a24), by Eudorus\n(Simplicius, In Physica 181.10–30) and by Moderatus\n(Porphyry, On Matter in Simplicius, In Physica\n231.6–24). Those Pythagoreans postulated God or One, on the one\nhand, and matter or the indefinite dyad, on the other, but they\nmaintained that God or One is the ultimate principle of everything\n(Simplicius, In Physica. 7.1–30); from this matter came\ninto existence through the total privation of form\n(ibid. 231.7–9). Numenius appears to be reacting against this\nview, which is associated specifically with Moderatus\n(fr. 52.15–23; see Kahn 2001, 133). Numenius rejects Moderatus'\nview in favor of his own dualistic position, presumably because he\nwants to avoid the implication of the monistic position that God is\nthe source of what is bad. This concern seems also to motivate\nNumenius to distance God from matter as much as possible. He thus\ndistinguishes the divine demiurge, who creates the physical world by\nimposing order on matter, from the highest God. This highest God is\nmetaphysically above the demiurge (frs. 16, 17, 19–21) in the\nsense that the highest God, which Numenius also calls the first\nintellect (fr. 20.12), is inert (fr. 12.13, 15.2) and utterly simple\n(fr.  11.11–14), qualifies as being itself (auto on;\nfr. 17.4) and the source of being (fr. 16.4–5, 9), while the\ndemiurge is the source of generation (fr. 16.5); the highest God is\nabsolute goodness (frs. 16.4, 9–10, 20.12), identical with the\nForm of the Good (fr.  20.5, 11). Unlike the Form of the Good in\nRepublic VI, however, that is beyond being, Numenius' first\nGod is being, and indeed the source of it. This is not at odds with\nthe Republic, however, since several passages in it describe\nthe Good as being (518c9, 526e3-4, 532c5-6; see Burnyeat 2005,\n154-155). Numenius apparently takes stance in a debate among\nPlatonists as to whether the first principle is being or beyond being\n(Origen, Against Celsus IV.64.14-28). Numenius actually\ndescribes the First God as being (ho ôn), a phrase that\nalludes to Exodus 3.14 (fr. 13.4). This Biblical reference has been\nmuch debated and a number of alterations of the text have been\nproposed (see Dodds 1960, 15-16, Baltes 1975, 262, Dillon 1977, 368,\nTarrant 1979, Edwards 1989). None of these proposals is however\nconvincing since Numenius frequently designates the first God as being\n(frs. 5.5-14, 6.7-8, 8.2; see Whittaker 1978, Edwards 1990b, 21-22,\nand also Burnyeat 2005, 149-162). Yet this first God that is\nidentified with being and absolute goodness, remains “alone,\nisolated, abandoned” (fr. 2.9),which suggests that this God,\nlike Plotinus' One, is ineffable and incomprehensible (see Whittaker,\n1993). Numenius thus sets himself apart from those Platonists who\nidentified the divine demiurge of the Timaeus with the Form\nof the Good of Republic VI (508e), but his view is adopted by\nAlcinous (Didascalicus ch. 10, 164.27–165.16 Hermann),\nwho must be writing some decades later than Numenius. \nNumenius faces two challenges. First, how can the first God be the\nultimate cause of everything, as it appears it ought to be\n(fr. 16.1–2, 9), if it is inert? Second how can it be simple, as\nNumenius has claimed, if it is, as he has also claimed, an intellect\nthat thinks? Numenius maintains that the first or highest God, or\nfirst intellect, brings about a second one (frs. 13, 21.7), in fact\nthe divine demiurge, and uses this second intellect as an instrument\nof its thinking (fr.  22.1–2). It is not clear what this\ninstrumental use (proschrêsis fr. 22.2) amounts to, but\nwe find similar vocabulary in the Timaeus (28a7) for the use\nof the Forms by the demiurge. It is clearer however that the second\nintellect thinks of the Forms and creates by imposing them on matter\n(fr. 18.10). Numenius is inspired again by the Timaeus. On\nthe basis of Timaeus 39e7-9 he believes that the demiurge\nencompasses all Forms in him. To the extent that all other Forms exist\nby participating in the Form of the Good (frs. 16.2–5,\n46b–c), which is identical with the first intellect, this\nintellect accounts also for the (other) Forms (Frede 1987,\n1060–1063), while it is the second god who actually thinks of\nthem. The first intellect thinks only itself, like the Aristotelian\nGod of Metaphysics Lambda, and in this sense its being and\nits object of thought are identical. Hence the first God remains\nabsolutely simple, pure goodness, is at rest and inert, while the\nsecond god is in motion (fr. 15.3–4), is not simple, because it\ncontains the Forms of all entities, and is good only because of its\nrelation to the first God, the Form of the Good, a relation which\nNumenius describes as “imitation” (fr. 16.15), or as\n“participation” (frs. 19.9–11, 20.7–10). This,\nhowever, does not mean that Numenius considers the demiurge to be\nignorant and a less than good creator and in this sense like the\ndemiurge of the Gnostics, as Dillon (1977, 369) has argued. Although\nclearly the demiurge is not as good as the first God, however, for\nNumenius the demiurge is a recipient of the goodness of the highest\nGod, the Good, and in turn transmits this goodness to the world which\nit brings into existence (frs. 14,16, 19). In this respect Numenius'\ndemiurge is clearly different from the creator god of the\nGnostics. \nYet creation is a process which, according to the Timaeus,\ncan be divided into two stages, the demiurgic intellect's thinking of\nthe Forms of all entities and its imposing them on matter. Numenius\nmaintains that the demiurgic intellect, the second god in his\nhierarchy, splits into two when engaged in the creation in the world,\nbecause matter, which is required for and involved in creation, is\nsuch that it divides whatever has anything to do with it. One reason\nwhy matter divides is because it inspires desire in the demiurge (fr.\n11.13–16), presumably desire for imposing order and goodness. As\na result, the demiurge is divided into one intellect which continues\ncontemplating the Forms and another which imposes Forms on matter and\nthus orders matter (frs. 11.14–20, 16.10–12,\n21.4–5). This means that the demiurgic intellect engages in\ncreation through a third god, that is a third intellect\n(frs. 21.3–5, 22.4), which is thinking in a discursive way\n(dianooumenon; fr. 22.4), not in the purely contemplative way\nthat the demiurgic intellect thinks. This third god is conceived along\nthe lines of the world-soul of the Timaeus; it is perhaps\nfair to say that for Numenius the god that actually engages in\ncreation is in effect the world-soul of Plato's Timaeus\n(Baltes 1975, 267). Numenius uses very metaphorical language, inspired\nby the myth of Plato's Statesman, in order to present what\nthe demiurge does and how it thinks in doing it. He argues that it is\nlike a helmsman steering a ship using the Forms as instrument (fr. 18\nwith Statesman 272e; cf. Timaeus 39e). Despite the\nmetaphorical language, two things become reasonably clear. First, this\nintellect, the world-soul, is also active in preserving order and\nmaintaining the world in existence (frs. 12.14–19, 18,\n52.91–8). Secondly, the third god desires to create\n(fr. 11.16–20, 18.7–13), which amounts to saying that God,\nin the person of this third intellect, wants to impose order in the\nworld because order is good (see Deuse 1983, 65–67). Since this\nthird intellect is directly responsible for the existence of the\nworld, it is ultimately not distinguishable from the world itself\n(fr. 21.3), which according to Timaeus 34b1 is god, because\nit is this which keeps the world together (see also Tarrant 1979). \nThere is a question of how to understand Numenius' hierarchy of three\ngods. Should we take seriously Proclus' testimonies that suggest there\nare in fact three (frs. 21–22), or the fragments of Numenius\npreserved by Eusebius which suggest that there are actually only two\n(frs. 15–16, 20)? The question becomes accentuated in view of\nNumenius' statement that the second and third gods are one, using the\nverb “to be” in the singular (estin; fr.\n11.14–15) in referring to them together. Frede (1987,\n1057–1059) has argued convincingly that the unity of the two\ndoes not mean their identity. The demiurge is split into two because\nof the effect of matter. The second god is divisible in the same way\nthat some other intelligible entities, such as human and animal soul,\nare (fr. 41.6).  Soul remains essentially the same in all animate\nbeings and yet is divided, in the process of ensoulment of the things\nthat it makes animate. This is the case with the demiurge as\nwell. That Numenius proposed a hierarchy of three distinct gods,\nrather than two (thus Holzhausen 1992, 253–254), or three\naspects of one god (Krämer 1964, 88), is strengthened by the fact\nthat Christians like Origen and Eusebius, being Trinitarians, approve\nof his theology. \nNumenius' three gods are the principles of being (first God) and\ngeneration (second and third god; fr. 16), and thus of everything that\nexists. And because the highest god is absolute goodness, the world of\ngeneration becomes good and beautiful (fr. 16.16–17). Numenius\nadvanced the idea that goodness is transmitted from the highest God\nthrough the second, demiurgic intellect, which realizes creation\nthrough a third intellect, to the world without God actually doing\nanything (fr.  14.6–14), an idea further developed later by\nPlotinus (cf. Enneads I.6, III.8, V.8). \n\nLike most contemporary Platonists, Numenius was much preoccupied with\nthe status of soul and its relation to body. First, some fragments\nfrom Numenius' treatise On the Good (frs. 2–4) show\nclearly that the treatment of the soul was extensive in this\nwork. Secondly, Numenius' views on the soul are discussed by several\nlater Platonists, including Porphyry, Iamblichus, Damascius, and\nCalcidius, while they can arguably be detected in Macrobius' In\nSomnium Scipionis. The main reason for Numenius' strong interest\nin the soul, especially the human soul, must have been one which can\nbe detected also in Plotinus: the soul-body relation is paradigmatic\nfor the relation between intelligible and sensible reality in general.\nThe former is an instance of the latter, which means that we cannot\ngrasp the one independently from the other. Indeed Numenius' views on\nsoul and its relation to body square well with his views on the\nrelation between intelligible and sensible reality. \nPorphyry reports that Numenius speaks of two souls, a rational and a\nnon-rational one (Porphyry in Stobaeus I.350.25-351.1 Wachsmuth;\nfr. 44), while Philoponus (In de anima 9.35–38; fr. 47)\nsuggests that Numenius may have distinguished also a third kind of\nsoul, namely a vegetative one (phytikon). To begin with\nPorphyry's testimony, this is somewhat confusing because it does not\nmake clear that Numenius distingushes two kinds of soul and not two\nsouls in man (as Merlan 1967, 103 claims), while it groups Numenius\ntogether with those Platonists who distinguish parts of the soul\n(reason, spirit, and appetite). This, however, is a different matter\nfrom that of distinguishing different kinds of soul for different\nkinds of living thing, although both distinctions can be held by a\nPlatonist, and possibly also by Numenius. Further evidence, though,\ncorroborates the conclusion that Numenius did distinguish at least two\nkinds of soul, a rational one for humans and gods, and a nonrational\none for animals. The distinction of a third kind of soul for plants,\nthough less well attested, is perfectly possible given the testimony\nof Timaeus 77b and given Numenius' reliance on the\nTimaeus. Porphyry himself states that according to Numenius\nthe rational soul has an “assenting faculty” which\nmotivates all actions (fr. 45). This reference to assent suggests that\nNumenius operates with a notion of reason similar to that of the\nStoics and that, like the Stoics, he considers souls of human adults\nto be nothing but reason. This view, though, does have Platonic\ncredentials, arguably going back to Socrates as he appears in the\nProtagoras. This may explain why other Platonists\ncontemporary with Numenius, such as Celsus (Origen, Against\nCelsus VIII.49), also endorse it. This picture is confirmed by\nIamblichus' testimony, which suggests that there is a fundamental\nopposition between Numenius' two kinds of soul (On the Soul\nin Stobaeus I.374.21-375-18 Wachsmuth, fr. 43.4–5), namely that\nthe human soul, being rational or intellectual, is in its essence that\nof gods (fr.  41.15–6; Kahn 2001, 130–1), while that of\nother animals, being essentially non rational, is not. For Numenius\nthe human soul is of the kind of the divine soul, namely an immortal\nintellect (fr. 31.25–6), and in this sense human souls have\ndivine origin (fr. 52.73–5). \nApparently Numenius sides with those (notably the Stoics) who believe\nthat possessing reason makes a soul fundamentally different from souls\ndevoid of reason, and that this is crucial both for the status of the\nsoul as such as well as for its relation to the body and perhaps also\nfor the related bodily functions. For Numenius functions of this kind,\nsuch as perception, memory, and desire, are not essential to the soul\nand are later additions to it (fr. 43.7–9), coming into\nexistence with its embodiment. Numenius apparently held that the human\nsoul is an intellect that descended to human bodies through the\nplanets (fr.  12.14–16). This is a view that also Celsus shared\n(Origen, Against Celsus VI.21; see Frede 1994, 5211), which\nwe can find also in Hermetic treatises (Corpus Hermeticum. I.25;\nDodds 1960, 8). Furthermore, Origen also adopts the view that the\nhuman soul is essentially an intellect that falls in bodies and then\nbecomes a soul with the necessary faculties to operate within a human\nbody, yet the soul retains the ability to ascend and become an\nintellect again (On Principles I.4.1, I.8.1, II.6.4,\nII.9.7). Numenius arrives at this view guided by the analogy of the\nCave and the story of Er in Republic VII and X respectively,\nbut also by the description of the creation of the soul in\nthe Timaeus (41e), according to which the demiurge mounts the\nsouls on vehicles (ochêmata). Porphyry in his\nwork The Cave of Nymphs makes clear that he relies on\nNumenius' exegesis of the soul's descent to bodies through the planets\n(frs. 30–33) and speaks of the honey offered by the astrologists\nin anticipation of the future pleasures of the souls in earth\n(fr. 32). Apparently pleasures draw the soul towards the earth and\nalso keep it attached to it. \nFurther light is shed in Macrobius' long account about the descent of\nthe soul from the sky to the earth (In Somnium Scipionis\n1.12; test. 47 Leemans, omitted by Des Places), which at least to some\nextent must be drawn from Numenius (thus Dodds 1960, 8–10\nagainst Beutler 1940, 676–677; the extent of Macrobius' debt to\nNumenius is debated by Elferink 1968, Ley 1972, Baltes 1975,\n252–3, Deuse 1983, 72–73). According to Macrobius' story\nof the soul's descent from heaven to earth, the soul acquires a number\nof capacities necessary for its functions in a body as it goes through\nthe planets, such as the capacity of theoretical thinking\n(logistikon) in Saturn, that of practical thinking\n(praktikon) in Jupiter, the spirited aspect (thumos)\nin Mars, the perceptual capacity (aisthêtikon) and\nimagination (phantastikon) in the Sun, appetite\n(orektikon) in Venus, the linguistic capacity\n(hermeneutikon) in Mercury, and finally the vegetative\nfunctions (phutikon) in the Moon. As Frede (1987, 1072) has\nargued, the capacities acquired in the seven planetary spheres\ncorrespond to the seven parts of the soul according to the Stoics. It\nis crucial to stress that these acquired capacities neither are\nessential to soul nor do they change what the soul actually is, i.e.\nintellect (fr. 42). They rather are, as Iamblichus reports, causes of\nevil (On the Soul in Stobaeus I.374.21-375.18;\nfr. 43.7–9), as the soul loses its simplicity and purity. Yet\nthe evil is not due (or not only due) to the capacities themselves,\nbut rather to the accumulation of astral matter while the soul\ndescends through the planets. This is confirmed by the testimony of\nIamblichus according to which Numenius,\n Cronius,[1]\n and Harpocration\nconsider all embodiments to be invariably bad (fr. 48.10–14) and\nis compatible with Numenius' view that matter is the source of all\nthat is bad (see above, Metaphysics; cf. Dillon 1977, 375-376, Zambon\n2002, 213-221). \nWhen the soul is released from the body at death, then it remains only\nwhat it is essentially, namely intellect (fr. 35.21–26). If this\nis so, then for Numenius only the intellect is immortal. This however\nconflicts with the report of Damascius (In Phaedonem I.177\nWesterink; fr. 46a Des Places, wrongly attributed to Olympiodorus),\naccording to which Numenius maintained that not only the essence of\nthe soul, the intellect, is immortal, but also “the ensouled\ncondition” survives death, that is, the sum of all other psychic\ncapacities (the ones connected to bodily functions), and also with the\nreport of Philoponus (In de anima 3.35–38; fr.  47),\naccording to which Numenius follows Plato's Phaedrus (245c)\nin maintaining that “all soul is immortal” (Baltes 1975,\n245–246, Deuse 1983, 77). The immortality of the entire soul\nthough would be incompatible with the story of the soul's descent,\naccording to which the rest of the psychic capacities is acquired and\nnot originally present in the soul. Yet Numenius possibly\ndistinguished between the immortality of the intellect, and the\nimmortality for the rest of the psychic capacities. The intellect is\nimmortal in the sense that it always lives, while the irrational part\nof the soul is immortal in that it survives death as its constituent\ncapacities dissolve gradually into the spheres from which they were\noriginated. This is also the view that Porphyry later takes (in\nStobaeus 1.384.19–28, Porphyry fr. 453 Smith), who may well\nfollow Numenius on this (see Smith 1974, 56–68, Karamanolis\n2006, 292). For Numenius the soul is immortal strictly speaking only\nin its essence, that is as intellect, being free from body, even the\nastral body or matter accumulated during its descent. Numenius\nmaintains that the human rational soul may continue to live in other\nbodies and these may also be bodies of animals if the soul becomes bad\nduring its bodily life (fr. 49; cf. Alcinous, Didascalicus\n178.26-179.39 Hermann). Presumably such a life is a form of\npunishment.  \n\nNumenius had a powerful influence on contemporary and later\nphilosophers, pagans and Christians alike. His impact was particularly\npronounced on Plotinus and on many Platonists of Plotinus'\ngeneration. It is possible that Numenius exercised some influence\nalready on Ammonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus and the Christian\nOrigen (see Nemesius, De natura hominis 69–72 Matthaei;\nfr. 4b), given that all of Ammonius' students about whom we know\nanything show respect for and knowledge of Numenius' thought despite\ntheir disagreements on specific topics in Platonist philosophy. The\nmain issue which divides Ammonius and his followers from Numenius is\nthe number of the intelligible principles. The pagan Origen, another\nstudent of Ammonius, is a rigorous monist, holding that the supreme\ngod is also the creator of the universe (Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 3.32, Proclus, Platonic Theology II.4.9-22;\nsee Saffrey-Westerink,\nProclus Théologie Platonicienne vol. II, X-XX).\nLonginus, who studied both with Ammonius and the Christian Origen\n(Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 20.36–37), apparently also\ncommitted himself to this kind of metaphysical monism (Proclus, In\nTimaeum I.322.18–26; Longinus fr. 60 Männlein-Robert,\n538–540), possibly in reaction to Numenius, whose work he\nreportedly knew well (Porphyry, Life of Plotinus\n20.74–76). Also well acquainted with Numenius' philosophy was\nCronius, Numenius' contemporary (frs. 46b 48), as well as Atticus (see\nLife and Work). Numenius' work was particularly appreciated by the\nearly Christians. The Christian Origen was reportedly a keen reader of\nthe works of Numenius as he was of Plato and of Pythagoreans other\nthan Numenius, like Moderatus and Nicomachus\n(Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History VI.19.8). Indeed Origen has an\nimpressive knowledge of Numenius' work. This becomes evident in that\nhe often cites verbatim from it in his Against Celsus (I.15;\nfr. 1b, IV.51; fr. 1c, 10, V.57; fr. 29, V.38; fr. 53), which is\nremarkable given that Origen normally cites only from Scripture (see\nKritikos, 2007, 406–7). The practice of quoting verbatim from\nNumenius' work is inherited by Eusebius, who has preserved more\nfragments of Numenius than any other ancient author. \nThere are three reasons accounting for such a strong approval of\nNumenius by the early Christians. First, Numenius is rare among his\ncontemporaries in showing respect for the Jewish tradition (frs. 1a-c,\n8, 9); he is attested to speak of the religion of the Jews claiming\nthat their God is incorporeal (Against Celsus I.15; fr. 1b),\nhe is also reported as being a reader who practiced allegorical\ninterpretation of the statements of Moses and the prophets of the Old\nTestament (ibid. IV.51; fr. 1c). Moreover, Numenius famously states\nthat Plato is like Moses speaking Attic Greek (fr. 8.13; see Whittaker\n1967, Edwards 1990a), he even alludes to Jesus and he also speaks of\nMoses and Egyptian sages (fr. 10a).  Such attention to the Jewish\ntradition is important for the early Christian theologians and\napologists who want to establish the superiority of the\nJewish-Christian tradition against that of the pagan culture. This\nattention however is not motivated by historical concerns on the part\nof Numenius but rather by philosophical ones. Numenius wanted to show\nthat the Jewish nation must be counted among the ancient ones that\nhave a share in logos and also that Moses had a conception of\nthe first principle similar to that of Plato, since both identified\nGod with being (see Burnyeat 2005, 155-156). Secondly, Numenius'\ndoctrine of three divine principles of reality can be read as\nanalogous to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. To the extent that\nNumenius is an exegete of Plato, Christians feel entitled to claim\nthat Plato in the 2nd Letter foreshadows the doctrine of\nthe Trinity, and use this argument to try to convince the pagans that\nChristianity is not something new but was anticipated in the best\nparts of the pagan philosophical tradition (Eusebius,\nPrep. Ev. XI.praef. 3, XI.20.1–3; see Kritikos 2007,\n407–9). Origen in particular was inspired by Numenius'\ndistinction between the first God and the immediate agent of creation,\na second, creator god, a distinction which is meant to preserve the\nimmutability of the highest God (Origen, Against Celsus\nVII.42–44, Commentary on John I.6.35; Kritikos 2007,\n409–416). Finally, Numenius is valuable for the argument which\nEusebius makes in his Preparatio Evangelica that the pagan\nphilosophers disagree with each other and do not stick to what\nEusebius considers the best part of Greek philosophy, which is Plato's\nphilosophy (see above, Numenius' Platonism). \nThe extent of Numenius' influence on Plotinus was debated in\nantiquity. Plotinus' students, Amelius and Porphyry, were concerned to\ndiscredit the widespread charge of Plotinus' plagiarism of Numenius\n(Life of Plotinus 18.1–8, 21.1–9).  Amelius, who\nis attested to have known Numenius' work by heart (ibid.\n3.44–5), devoted a special work on this topic, On the\nDifference Between the Doctrines of Plotinus and Those of\nNumenius (ibid. 17.1–6).  Porphyry discusses the matter\nextensively in his biography of Plotinus (ibid. 17–18,\n21.1–9), making reference to Amelius' work mentioned above as\nwell as to Longinus' claim that Plotinus' works were far superior in\nterms of precision to Numenius', Cronius', Moderatus', and Thrasyllus'\n(ibid.  20.71–76, 21.5–9). Clearly, however, several of\nPlotinus' views resemble those of Numenius: both distinguish three\nintelligible principles, both consider matter to be evil, although\nPlotinus does not raise it into a principle (see Ennead I.8),\nand both consider the soul to be essentially an intellect. \n\nAmelius and Porphyry themselves are also much influenced by Numenius'\nphilosophy, as later Platonists point out. Amelius follows Numenius in\nmaintaining that not only sensible entities but also intelligible ones\nparticipate in intelligibles (Syrianus, In Metaphysica\n109.12–14; fr. 46b). Porphyry also relies much on Numenius\nespecially in his doctrine of the soul (e.g.\n Ad Gaurum 34.20–35; fr. 36), to the extent that he is\nexplicitly accused by Proclus of taking over Numenius' views (on\ndemons, In Timaeum I.76.30–77.23; fr.  37; see Waszink\n1966, Zambon 2002, ch. 4). \nNumenius' influence goes beyond the contemporaries of Plotinus.\nIamblichus, Proclus, Syrianus, Philoponus and Damascius also draw on\nhis work, although not always with approval (see\nfrs. 46a-51). Numenius was also used by Calcidius in his commentary on\nthe Timaeus (297.7–301.20 Waszink; fr. 52; see Phillips\n2003) and by Macrobius in his In Somnium Scipionis\n(frs. 54–55), a work that exerted considerable influence in the\nMiddle Ages.","contact.mail":"george.karamanolis@univie.ac.at","contact.domain":"univie.ac.at"}]
