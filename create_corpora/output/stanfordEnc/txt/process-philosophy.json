Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously\nchanging, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describing\nreality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic features\nare either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and\nderivative. For process philosophers the adventure of philosophy\nbegins with a set of problems that traditional metaphysics\nmarginalizes or even sidesteps altogether: what is dynamicity or\nbecoming—if it is the way we experience reality, how\nshould we interpret this metaphysically? Are there several varieties\nof becoming—for instance, the uniform going on of activities\nversus the coming about of developments? Do all developments have the\nsame way of occurring quite independently of what is\ncoming about? How can we best classify into different kinds\nof occurrences what is going on and coming about? How can we\nunderstand the emergence of apparently novel conditions? \n\n\nWhile process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is\ncontinuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there\nare temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. But\nthey take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior of\ndynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoing\ninteraction of processes. In order to articulate a process view of\nreality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since the\nstandard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to the\nstatic view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation of\npredicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that\nare exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what\nis from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical\nbias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as\nmetaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise—pushing\nfor a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of\ndeveloping new explanatory concepts and providing arguments\nfor why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy.\n\n\nProcess philosophy centers on ontology and metaphysics, but it has\nfull systematic scope: its concern is with the dynamic sense of being\nas becoming or occurrence, the conditions of spatio-temporal\nexistence, the kinds of dynamic entities, the relationship between\nmind and world, and the realization of values in action. Some\napproaches to process philosophy are conceived on the grand scale and\noffer a full-scope metaphysics in the form of a systematic theory or\ncomprehensive philosophical view. Other approaches, especially more\nrecent ones, take a more modest approach. They pursue the specific\nproblems that the various philosophical disciplines are engaged in\nwhile focusing on the dynamic aspects of each sub-domain. Such process\nontologies, process ethics, process epistemologies, process theories\nof mind etc. are contributions to ‘process philosophy’\nmore broadly conceived as a research paradigm of philosophical\ninquiry. They share the guiding idea that natural existence consists\nin modes of becoming and types of occurrences.\n‘Processists’ agree that the world is an assembly of\nphysical, organic, social, and cognitive processes that interact at\nand across levels of dynamic organization. However, within that broad\nframework, process philosophers debate about how such a world of\nprocesses is to be construed, how it relates to the human mind (which\nis another process) and how the dynamic nature of reality relates to\nour scientific theories. In consequence, process philosophers also\ndiffer in their view on the role of philosophy itself and in their\nchoice of theoretical style.\n\n\nProcess philosophy opposes ‘substance metaphysics,’ the\ndominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy since\nAristotle. Substance metaphysics proceeds from the\nintuition—first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher\nParmenides—that being should be thought of as simple, hence as\ninternally undifferentiated and unchangeable. Substance metaphysicians\nrecast this intuition as the claim that the primary units of reality\n(called “substances”) must be static—they must be\nwhat they are at any instant in time. In contrast to the\nsubstance-metaphysical snapshot view of reality, with its typical\nfocus on eternalist being and on what there is, process\nphilosophers analyze becoming and what is occurring as well\nas ways of occurring. In some process accounts, becoming is\nthe mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamic\nbeings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoing\nself-differentiation; on these accounts becoming is both the mode of\nbeing of different kinds of dynamic beings and the process\nthat generates different kinds of dynamic beings. In order to develop\na taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences),\nprocessists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysics\nwith a set of new basic categories. Central among these is the notion\nof a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it\n‘does.’ This type of functionally individuated entity is\noften labeled ‘process’ in a technical sense of this term\nthat does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Some\nof the ‘processes’ postulated by process philosophers\nare—in agreement with our common-sense understanding of\nprocesses—temporal developments that can be analyzed as\ntemporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with each\nsuch stage being numerically and qualitatively different from any\nother. But some of the ‘processes’ that process\nphilosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this \nsense—they are, for example, temporal but non-developmental\noccurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings that\nrealize themselves in a developmental fashion and thereby\nconstitute the directionality of time. What holds for all dynamic\nentities labelled ‘processes,’ however, is that they\noccur—that they are somehow or other intimately\nconnected to time, and often, though not necessarily, related to the\ndirectionality or the passage of time. \n\n\nProcess philosophers claim that there are many sound philosophical\nreasons to take the processual aspects of nature, cognition, and\naction as fundamental features of the real. The perhaps most powerful\nargument for process philosophy is its wide descriptive or explanatory\nscope. If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes,\nwe can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds of\nentities and relationships we are committed to when we reason about\nour world in common sense and in science: from quantum entanglement to\nconsciousness, from computation to feelings, from things to\ninstitutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams to\nclimate change, from spacetime to beauty. Moreover, results in\ncognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need a\nprocess metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of the\nmind and of normativity. These arguments form the background for the\nprocessist criticism of the focus on substance in Western philosophy.\nThe bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitive\ndispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly in\ntheoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of static\nentities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures)\nat the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast,\nprocess philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular language\ngroup and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of the\ngreat schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, process\nphilosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since only if\nwe re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come to\ngrips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena of\nartificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality,\nand investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scope\nof moral obligation. Thus contemporary process philosophy holds out\nthe promise of offering superior support for the three most pressing\ntasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century. First, it\nprovides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysics\nthat can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.\nSecond, it can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build an\nintercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary research\non global knowledge representation by means of an ontological\nframework that is no longer parochially Western. Third, it supplies\nconcepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflected\ntechnology development, and enable the cultural and ethical\nimagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changes\nengendered by the increased use of technology, especially automation.\n\n\nThe history of process philosophy extends far into antiquity, both in\nEastern and Western thought. In the Western tradition it is the Greek\ntheoretician Heraclitus of Ephesus (born ca. 560 B.C.E.) who is\ncommonly recognized as the founder of the process approach. The few\nremaining fragments of Heraclitus’ doctrine are often\ninterpreted as championing a philosophy of ubiquitous and radical\nflux, epitomized in the slogan panta rhei (“everything\nflows”). But Heraclitus’ claims are more sophisticated. To\nbe sure, the fragments contain an unambiguous commitment to ubiquitous\ndynamicity: “this world-order … is … an ever\nliving fire...” (Fr. 217, Kirk-Raven-Schofield). Whatever exists\nis a transformation of this cosmic fire, turning into apparently\nstable forms of matter such as sea and earth (Fr. 218), but all the\nwhile remaining present in these apparent stabilities (Fr. 204).\nCosmic fire is the source of change of all observable cosmological and\nnatural processes. Moreover, Heraclitus also postulates that all\nobservable changes result from a “strife” of opposing\nforces to overcome each other, thus creating transformative power as\nthe ruling condition of existence: “war is the father of all and\nking of all” (Fr. 212). However, Heraclitus’ reputation as\nthe great proponent of radical flux (alteration at every\ninstant) may be mainly due to the influence of his early commentators:\nPlato, Aristotle, Melissus, and Theophrastus. For one must not\noverlook that in the fragments we have from Heraclitus dynamicity is\ntied inextricably to balance or “measure” (Kirk 1951).\nWhile fire is postulated as an underlying pervasive cosmic factor that\nis creative and self-moving, the changes produced by fire happen in a\nregulated, measured way. Fire is “kindling in measures and going\nout in measures” (Fr. 217) and “all things are an equal\nexchange for fire and fire for all things, as goods are for gold and\ngold for goods” (Fr. 219). Furthermore the opposing forces,\nwhich are manifestations of fire, form unities of cyclical\nalternation—“day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety\nhunger unity”(Fr. 204)—that proceed within the limits of a\nquantitative measure (metron) reinforced by a\n“law” of nature (Fr. 226). The unity of opposites thus\ncreates an overall balance of reciprocity by cyclical transitions\nbetween extremes—“these things change places and are\nthose, and those change places again and are these” (Fr.202). The\n“same rivers” are constituted by the regular flow patterns\nof “different and different waters” which “scatter\nand…gather…come together and flow away…approach\nand depart” (Fr. 214). Moreover, the unity of opposites also\nproduces the dynamic arrest we know from “the bow or the\nlyre” (Fr. 209), i.e., the motionless dynamic presence resulting\nfrom the tension of a ‘backstretched connection’\n(palintonos harmoniē) pulling equally into two opposite\ndirections. In short, Heraclitus articulated three fundamental\ninsights that became seminal in the history of Western process\nphilosophy, despite the somewhat tendentious portrait of his thought\nin Greek antiquity. First, Heraclitus assigned to process or\ndynamicity the role of an explanatory feature, not only of a feature\nof nature to be explained. Second, he suggested that processes form\norganizational units and occur in a quantitatively measurable and\nordered fashion. Third, he contrasted dynamic transitions or\nalterations with dynamic permanence, and thus for the first time\nidentifies, and differentiates between, two basic\n‘Gestalts’ or forms of dynamicity.  \nThe direct counter-model to Heraclitus’ explanation of natural\nchanges was the atomism of Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus, who\nviewed matter as constituted by inert material atoms with permanent\nproperties (e.g., weight) and took natural developments to be the\nmacroscopic effects of atoms colliding and changing their spatial\npositions. Aristotle complained that the source of motion for these\ncollisions remained unexplained and developed a philosophy of nature\nthat includes a coherent account of the source of motion in natural\noccurrences, allowing also for explanations in terms of self-realizing\nand self-maintaining structural or formal factors. In\nAristotle’s view an item in nature persists by the active\nexercise of a collection of capacities, a self-maintaining internal\nprocess organization (physis, or more generally\nmorphē) that realizes a characteristic sort of\nfunctioning; by means of these characteristic types of functioning we\nsort entities into natural kinds. These kind-specific capacities must\nbe realized within a matter or medium (hylē) that\nsupports the relevant process organizations but that also harbors\ncounteracting, disintegrative tendencies, due to the fact that the\nelemental components of matter (fire, water, earth, or air) actively\nstrive towards their “natural place” further up or down.\nIf Aristotle indeed took these active elemental tendencies as\nfundamental and allowed for elemental transformations as changes\nper se without an underlying substratum or prime matter (as\nargued in Gill 1989), he can be counted as a process philosopher. But\nAristotle also supplied in his characterization of substance\n(ousia) those aspects that subsequent history selected to\nform the basic tenets of the paradigm of ‘substance\nmetaphysics.’ In addition, substance-metaphysics could also draw\non Aristotle’s classification of changes (kineseis)\ninto generation, destruction, alteration, and locomotion, since this\nclassification rests on a sophisticated doctrine of\n“potential” vs. “actual” features that are all\nattributed to a static subject of change. Aristotle’s\ndistinction between kinesis and energeia, on the\nother hand, must again be counted as an important contribution to\nprocess thought. Changes such as building a house or\nlearning lead to an end (telos) that lies\n“beyond,” and are incomplete as long as the end is not\nreached—“someone who is building a house, has not built\nit” (Metaphysics Theta 6). In contrast, activities such\nas seeing or living well are ends in themselves and\ncomplete at any moment for as long as they last—“he who is\nseeing has seen.” Aristotle’s distinction between changes\nand activities is significant in its own right, but even more seminal\nfor present-day process philosophy, since it is the first attempt to\nclassify types of occurrences in terms of logical and linguistic\nfeatures of associated expressions (see section 3 below).  \nThe history of Western metaphysics since Aristotle was mainly focused\non elaborating various versions of substance metaphysics—in\nfact, as one might say with Hegel, “the history of [Western]\nmetaphysics is the tendency towards substance.” However,\ninterspersed in this history of substance metaphysics are pockets of\nprocess thought, partly as supplementary elements to an otherwise\nsubstance-geared theory, and partly as independent\nprocess-philosophical explorations. For example, the neo-Platonic\nphilosopher Plotinus (204–270) introduced the thought that the\ndynamicity of being is the “emanation of the divine,” an\nidea that was later enriched by the Renaissance philosopher Francesco\nPatrizzi (1529–1597) with mereological descriptions of the\ndiffusion of processes in order to develop a “metaphysics of\nlight.” G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716) developed a\nfully-fledged process-based metaphysics, postulating as basic\nindividuals so-called “monads.” Monads are ordered\nsequences of states of affairs consisting of the co-exemplification of\nproperties during some period of time. But monads are not static: they\nare endowed with an inherent “active force” that engenders\nthe transitions between states. Moreover, since Leibniz took temporal\nrelations to be “founded” in the properties of monads,\nstates of monads are per se not temporally\n discrete.[1] \nA special branch of process thought opened up in late 18th and early\n19th century German Idealism, when Johann G. Fichte, Friedrich W. J.\nSchelling, and Georg W. F. Hegel responded to Immanuel Kant’s\nsystem of a transcendental idealism. All three of these thinkers\nalerted to the processual nature of the “transcendental\nsubject,” and aimed to overcome Kant’s incongruous\npostulate of unknowable “things in themselves” by focusing\non the process by which the world of knowable appearances, including\nreflective reasoning, is generated—this process, or so the\nargument goes, is the most promising candidate for reality in itself.\nHegel provided the most comprehensive and detailed elaboration of this\nbasic idea. He postulated that reality is the self-unfolding of\ndynamic structures or templates (“Begriffe”); among these\ntemplates external contrasts arise, which trigger self-modifications\nof the templates into more differentiated versions; these in turn\ncreate further external contrasts. The result is an increasingly\ninterrelated web of dynamic dependencies, and the “movement of\nreflection” that drives the interrelated differentiations of the\ntemplates in the end reaches a dynamic fixed point. According to\nHegel’s dynamic structuralism, self-unfolding reality\ndifferentiates itself into mental, natural, socio-cultural, and\ninstitutional processes, and, in fact, over time develops any possible\ndifferentiation, so that in the end reality occurs as the totality of\nall possible forms of mutual conditioning. Hegel argued that this\noverall “movement” of gradual self-determination by\ninternal and external differentiation drives all actual and possible\ndevelopments according to its inner necessity—reality is\n“reason” articulating itself as and within the world.\nHegel called this movement “dialectics” and his\nphilosophical system was an attempt to work out the\n‘logic’ underlying the total dialectical development of\nreality. Schelling claimed that Hegelian dialectics provides, at best,\na description of the development of constraining conditions on\nreality’s self-unfolding. But, Schelling argued, the productive\ndynamicity of the process that is being constrained is neither\nincluded nor explained in Hegel’s system, and correctly so,\nsince the latter is necessarily transcendent to conscious human\nthought. From the perspective of contemporary process ontology, the\ndevelopment of German Idealism between 1790 and 1850 in the debate\nbetween Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling displays in instructive ways the\nlimitations of a process metaphysics that puts the occurrence type of\nproductions center-stage and, in particular, understands\ncognition as a production: as a development with a product or result.\nAs pictures are the products of paintings, mental representations\n(thoughts, concepts) were taken to be the quasi-objects that result\nfrom the productive developmental occurrences of perceiving and\nthinking. When we conceive of an occurrence as a production, we\nseparate conceptually between the product and the process generating\nthe product. Thus, productions are precisely the type of occurrences\nthat prevent us from conceiving the dynamic presence of reality in\nitself as “process and result rolled into one,” as Hegel\nenvisaged. The metaphilosophical debate between Fichte, Hegel, and\nSchelling, which deeply influenced the further development of\n‘continental’ philosophy from Nietzsche to Heidegger to\nDerrida and onwards, can be viewed as ensuing from the assumption that\ncognitions are productions of sorts—if cognitions had been\nassigned another occurrence type, this specific metaphilosophical\ndebate could not have got off the ground.  \nHegel assumed that the process of reality follows certain principles\nthat can be fathomed by philosophical inquiry. This thesis is the\nhallmark of speculative process metaphysics, which has a\nnumber of adherents also among later process philosophers but has been\nchampioned most explicitly by Alfred N.\n Whitehead\n in his “philosophy of organism,” worked out during the\nearly decades of the 20th century. The basic unit of reality in\nWhitehead’s system is an event-like entity called “actual\noccasion,” which is the procedural integration or\n“concrescence” of processes of data transfer\n(“prehensions”) into unities that become new data. Each\nactual occasion is the growing together of the total available\ninformation of the universe at that time, according to certain\nprinciples, repeating and reinforcing certain patterns (“eternal\nobjects”) and thereby creating new ones. Whitehead’s\nprocess metaphysics is arguably the most comprehensive descriptive\nmetaphysical framework we have to date—as Whitehead’s\nfollowers, past and present, have shown, not only can it be used for\nthe interpretation of familiar domains of philosophical concern, but\nit can also provide illuminating descriptions for scientific domains\nwhere other metaphysical theories have little to offer, such as\ndiscourse pragmatics in linguistic typology, the neuro-psychological\nfoundations of value judgments, quantum physics, or measurements in\n astrophysics.[2]\n By refurbishing Plotinous’s idea of divinity coming about in\nthe world’s becoming, Whitehead’s philosophy also provided\na new impetus to the philosophy of religion.\n Charles Hartshorne,\n perhaps the most eminent American philosopher of religion of the\nTwentieth century, adopted and expanded Whitehead’s ideas for a\nprocess view of God and developed the position of\n process theism\n in the style of rational speculative process thought. It is important\nto note, however, that while the early followers of Whitehead such as\nHartshorne and Paul Weiss embraced the speculative principles of his\nphilosophy, many present-day Whiteheadians are content to put the\nsystem’s ontological concepts to descriptive use. \nOther proponents of speculative process metaphysics between 1850 and\n1950, such as Charles S. Peirce, Samuel Alexander, C. Lloyd Morgan,\nand Andrew Paul Ushenko, contributed two new motives for process\nthought, namely, the philosophical explanation of evolutionary\nprocesses and the philosophical explanation of emergence and\nself-organization. However, they also created an image of process\nmetaphysics that in the eyes of their contemporaries appeared\nmethodologically problematic. The first step of these\nprocess-philosophical enterprises seemed legitimate\nbusiness—surely it was important to identify the limitations of\nmechanistic explanations in science. But it was the second step, the\nendeavor of drafting purely speculative explanations for the direction\nand the origin of emergent evolution, that went against the positivist\ntemper of the time. Such explanations did not sit well with the\nphilosophers who defined and shaped the “analytic” method\nin postwar Anglo-American philosophy. As they rejected any empirical\nclaims that would go beyond what was scientifically proven, and\nassigned to philosophy the more mundane task of analyzing conceptual\ncontents (as well as linguistic and social practices, and phenomenal\nexperiences), they increased the intersubjective verifiability of\nphilosophical claims. But in the course of this important\nmethodological revision the ontological categories of process\nmetaphysics were mostly thrown out wholesale with the bathwater of the\nspeculative explanations these categories were embedded in. \nNevertheless, twentieth century speculative process\nmetaphysics is paralleled by an analytic-interpretive strand\nin contemporary process thought. This variety of process thought also\nproceeds from the theoretical intuition that processuality, in its\nvarious modes, is the primary starting point for a philosophical\ndescription of the world or of reality, but does not speculate about\nhow reality develops. Here processuality either is a defining trait of\nthe basic categories postulated for the analysis of common sense and\nscientific reasoning, in the style of analytic philosophy; or\nprocessuality is conveyed in the network of metaphors selected for the\ninterpretation of human experience and the conditions of human\nexistence, in the style of so-called ‘continental’\nphilosophy. Often contributions to analytic-interpretive processism\nare also placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic\nversus continental methods in contemporary philosophy. The following\nexamples will illustrate this methodological openness of\nnon-speculative contemporary process philosophy. \nBased on their analyses of phenomenal experience, the investigations\nof the “reflex arc” that were coming out of the psychology\nlaboratory, and an analysis of human social praxis, William James and\nJohn Dewey developed a process-based pragmatist metaphysics.\nJames’ process-based account of the self loomed less large for\nthe history of process philosophy than Dewey’s more\ncomprehensive view. Dewey holds that all existents are events whose\ncharacters we determine by giving them meaning in our interaction. For\nDewey meanings are not abstract or psychic objects but aspects of\nhuman cooperative behavior—in our interactions with the world\nwe create significances and thus determine what kind of situation\noccurs. Working from studies of social interaction, George Herbert\nMead added to process-based pragmatism the thesis that mind emerges\nfrom social communicative actions. On the side of\n‘continental’ philosophy, Henri Bergson arrived at a\nprocess metaphysics again based on an investigation of phenomenal\nexperience, like James and Dewey. But while Dewey and other\npragmatists put the process-character of being partly into the hand of\nhuman agents and their practical and theoretical interpretations of an\nongoing situation, Bergson argued that the process-character of being\nis precisely out of our cognitive reach, at least in so far as we try\nto conceptualize what we experience. As long as we understand\nconscious experience as a subject-object relation, Bergson pointed\nout, we merely follow the theoretical habits in which we have been\nconditioned by the substance-metaphysical tradition. However, when we\ncarefully attend to what we take in during conscious experience,\nespecially our self-experience, without forcing a conceptualization of\nthat experiential content or the act of experience, we find not a\nrelation and ready-made relata but an interactivity—an ongoing\ninterfacing out of which world and self arise in our\nconceptualizations. In immediate, non-conceptualized experience we\ngrasp the dynamicity of this interfacing as becoming or the flow of\nduration (“durée”), but this felt dynamic content\nof our experience transcends what we can conceptually articulate. As\nsoon as we try to conceptualize what we have grasped in\n“intuition” we turn the continuous complex flow of\nexperience into a sequence of discrete units, into pluralities of\nstates of objects at locations that engender Zeno’s paradoxes of\nmotion, and we transform our entangled being with the world into the\never puzzling opposition of a subject and an object. \nMartin Heidegger’s early and late philosophy also presents an\nanalytic-interpretive contribution to process philosophy, without\nspeculative formulations of metaphysical ‘laws of\ndevelopment,’ but with a view to the metaphilosophical and\npractical implications of process metaphysics. In Sein und\nZeit (1927) Heidegger presents what could be called an\n‘adverbial model’ of process metaphysics; based on an\nanalysis of human existence (“Dasein”) Heidegger shows\nthat what the metaphysical tradition understood as entities or factors\nstanding in relational constellations—e.g., space, world, self,\nothers, possibility, matter, function, meaning, time—can be\nviewed as ‘adverbial modifications’ of Dasein, as modes\nand ways in which Dasein occurs, while Dasein itself is the\ninteractivity of “disclosure” or ‘taking as.’\nSince Heidegger’s ‘taking as’ is an understanding\nthat is ineradicably practical, his early philosophy bears certain\naffinities to the pragmatist tendency in twentieth century American\nprocess thought. In Heidegger’s later work, however, human\nunderstanding is no longer the dynamic ‘locus’ but more a\ndimension of the process of being (“clearing”). \nWhile many twentieth century American process thinkers were influenced\nby Whitehead, some turned elsewhere or went their own ways. For\nexample, W. H. Sheldon championed a largely dialectical view of the\ndynamic nature of reality with process as a principle of conflict\nresolution. Wilfrid Sellars, one of the great figures in post-war\nanalytical philosophy, worked out what appears to be the first\nconsistently nominalist and naturalist system ever developed in the\nhistory of Western philosophy; this is often overlooked, however,\nsince the system relies on a process ontology that Sellars only\nbriefly sketched but never elaborated. Naturalism implies a nominalist\naccount of properties, Sellars argued, which in turn can only succeed\nif we take qualia to be aspects of processes—by categorizing\nblue as sensing-blue-ly, we can make better sense of\nhow physical processes engender sensory contents (Sellars 1981). With\nthe envisaged process-based solution to the body-sensory problem,\nwhich in many ways anticipates current ideas of “embodied\ncognition,” Sellars could further suggest a new process-based\nre-interpretation of intentionality. Any kind of content, Sellars\nargued, from the lowliest sensory content in bacteria to the\nnorm-governed contents of conceptual experience to the contents of\nscientific theories, is nothing else but a way of\nfunctioning. Taking over from Sellars the idea that content\nis function, present-day functionalist theories of mind and cognition\ntypically fail to acknowledge Sellars and thereby miss the decisive\nelement for a successful functionalist ‘reduction’ of\nintentionality and the mental, namely, that the reductive basis,\nfunctions, are not static input-output tables but ongoing processes in\nnatural systems that realize, in this ongoingness, normative\nsocio-cultural practices (Seibt 2016). Recently American process\nmetaphysics gained another important voice in Nicholas Rescher who,\nlike Sellars, consistently pursued a systematic approach in\nphilosophy. Rescher made important contributions to all\nphilosophical disciplines; originally these were framed as components\nof a system of “methodological pragmatism” and\n“pragmatic idealism”. In the mid-1990s, however, Rescher\ndeveloped a process metaphysical embedding for his system, using\nfamiliar philosophical terminology, and thus presented the first\nsystematic overview of the explanatory potential of a non-Whiteheadian\nprocess metaphysics that forfeits technical expenditure and operates\nwith a notion of process that is much closer to our common-sense\nunderstanding of developments.  \nGenerally speaking, current Western process philosophy has abandoned\nall speculative aspirations and develops the descriptive,\nanalytic-interpretive strand of process thought (the exception might\nbe the use of process metaphysics in areas of philosophy of physics\nwhere physics itself is speculative, see footnote 17). While interest\nin processism most recently has increased in analytic philosophy of\nscience, of mind, and of action, process thought is currently also\nused to highlight productive affinities between the continental and\nanalytical trajectories of twentieth century metaphilosophical\ncriticism of traditional metaphysics. Such\nanalytic-continental cross-overs enabled by attention to process can\nalso be observed in philosophy of cognition and philosophy of\ntechnology. Another more encompassing exploration across borders, a\ndetailed historical and systematic comparison between Western and\nEastern process philosophy (e.g.,\n Daoism)\n is an important task yet to be undertaken. \nAs may have become clear from the brief review of historical\ncontributions to (Western) process philosophy in section 1, process\nphilosophy is a complex and highly diversified field that is not tied\nto any school, method, position, or even paradigmatic notion of\nprocess. Some process philosophers (e.g. Whitehead) took organismic\nprocesses as their central model for a concept of occurrences that\ngenerate the internal and external coherence of an entity. Others\n(e.g. James) chose as their canonical illustrations individual\npsychological processes, or (e.g. Alexander) took evolutionary\ndevelopment as paradigmatic. Some process philosophers (e.g. Whitehead\nand Morgan) articulated their approach in the form of an axiomatic\ntheory and in close relation to science, while others (e.g. Bergson)\nworked from an almost mystical sort of sympathetic apprehension of\nreality and insisted that process metaphysics could, if at all, only\nbe expressed by means of a highly metaphorical use of language. Some\nprocessists (e.g., Roger Boscovich) championed a materialist position,\nwhile others endorsed idealism (e.g., Leibniz and Hegel). The\nhistorical overview in the preceding section also displays that the\ntools of process philosophy are not tied to any specific method of\nphilosophical inquiry, giving present-day process philosophers a broad\nspectrum of approaches with which to build their theories: by\nconceptual analysis (via informal and formal reconstructions of\nconceptual contents); by the integrative interpretation of scientific\nresults; or by phenomenological investigations. Similarly, while\ncompatibility with recent results of science is for many process\nphilosophers a privileged methodological constraint, others take\nscience to be merely an aspect of the more comprehensive philosophical\ndatum of cultural praxis. \nIn short, process philosophy is best understood as a paradigm of\nphilosophy characterized by a set of fundamental assumptions. For\nexample, process philosophers assume that the only primary or basic\nontological categories should be terms for occurring\nentities, and that certain formal theories—for example, set\ntheory—are ill-suited of themselves, without modifications, to\nexpress the dynamic relationships among occurrences. Or again, process\nthinkers hold that philosophical research may legitimately address\n‘creative’ phenomena that cannot be described as\nmodifications of permanent units, such as phenomena of emergence or\nself-organization. What unifies contemporary process-philosophical\nresearch more than any other aspect, however, is its metaphilosophical\naim to revise long-standing theoretical habits. Given its current role\nas a rival to the dominant substance-geared paradigm of Western\nmetaphysics, process philosophy has the overarching task of\nestablishing the following three claims: \nContributions to current process-philosophical research typically\nfocus on (aspects of) only one of these three components of a theory\n revision.[3]\n More often than not, however, the larger purpose of the contribution\nremains implicit, which is one of the reasons why contemporary process\nphilosophy, especially non-Whiteheadian process thought, does not\nclearly stand out as a unified effort at theory revision. Process\nphilosophy currently presents itself as an internally diversified,\ngeographically and disciplinarily distributed phenomenon of innovative\nthought in Western philosophy. Accordingly, there are significant\ndifferences in how process philosophers approach claims (1)–(3).\nIn the following the focus will be on arguments for claims\n(1)–(3) within contemporary analytical process philosophy. The\nreader should thus keep in mind that the pointers set in the following\nsections are partially representative at best and need to be\nsupplemented by introductions to, e.g., contemporary\n Whiteheadian\n process thought and French process thought\n (Gilles Deleuze,\n Alain Badiou). In addition, pointers to process-philosophical\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion are all but omitted, since\nextensive and in-depth treatments are provided in the entries on\n Charles Hartshorne\n and\n process theism.\n  \nIn order to support (Claim 1), two strategies have been pursued. The\nfirst strategy is to argue that the core assumptions of the substance\nparadigm—especially the focus on discrete, countable, static\nindividuals and the neglect of dynamic aspects—simply reflect\nthe cognitive dispositions that are typical for the speakers of the\nlanguages in which Western metaphysics were mainly developed, such as\nAncient Greek, Latin, German, and\n English.[4]\n The second strategy is to select a well-known argument for the\nnecessity of substance-based metaphysics and to show that it involves\na petitio principii. For example, consider Peter F.\nStrawson’s widely accepted argument against the very possibility\nof process\n metaphysics.[5]\n Strawson’s argument can be reconstructed as follows: \nIf this line of reasoning were correct, the substance paradigm would\nbe indispensable, and (Claim 1) above would be false. For it is clear\nthat any viable metaphysical theory must have room for identifiable\nindividuals that can be located in space and time. However, step (4)\nin Strawson’s argument begs the question on two counts. \nAll of the conditions that Strawson requires in step (3) (diversity,\nrichness, stability, and endurance or transtemporal sameness) are\nfulfilled as much by the entities that we conceptualize as\nphysical processes as by entities that “are or possess\nbodies.” Furthermore, the entities we conceptualize as processes\nare physically realized without being literally embodied, and for some\nof them it holds that we can point at them and distinguish them\n(“this trickle versus that trickle”) and re-identify them\n(“the trickle was gone for a minute, but then it came\nagain”). In nature’s spatio-temporal framework we\ndistinguish and re-identify both things and processes. That\nStrawson’s argument could have appeared plausible is perhaps due\nto the fact that his illustrations for processes are sounds and\nexplosions, which are not, like many other physical processes, lasting\noccurrences with determinate location (such as fires, tornadoes, or\nwaterfalls). The initial plausibility of step (4) may also derive from\na core assumption of the substance paradigm, namely, the thesis that\nall processes can be ontologically understood as modifications of\nsubstances. On this reductionist view, all processes are\n‘owned’ and we identify them via their owner: the murder\nof Cæsar, the construction of the forbidden\ncity, etc. But the fact that these processes involve certain things\nand persons is merely one of the aspects that an ontological\ninterpretation of processes should capture, and not a decisive one,\nsince many processes (e.g., tornadoes, lightening bolts, today’s\nrush-hour in New York) lack a proper ‘subject’\naltogether. \nEven more important is the second question-begging element involved in\nstep (4) of Strawson’s argument, for it displays the theoretical\nbias of the substance paradigm at a more fundamental level. Strawson\nsets up conditions for the ontological category or entity type that\ncan constitute a space-time framework and claims in step (4) (i) that\n“things that are or possess bodies” can fulfill these\nconditions, and (ii) that therefore such things are\n“basic particulars.” In this way Strawson turns a common\nsense concept, viz. “material thing,” into a basic\nontological category without asking whether it is possible that what\nwe common-sensically call a ‘thing’ might not also\nontologically be interpreted in terms of a category from process\nmetaphysics (e.g., as a bundle of activities or, in a Whiteheadian\nfashion, as ongoing pattern of events). Strawson elsewhere rejects\nsuch an interpretation as “revisionary metaphysics” while\nmetaphysics based on material things or substances is\n“descriptive,” but these adjectives are themselves in need\nof a convincing justification—as long as an ontological\ncategory fully captures the inferential content of a common sense\nconcept, it is as descriptive as any other. \nIn short, then, Strawson’s argument fails on two counts. It is\nsimply not the case that material things are the indispensable basis\nfor a framework of knowable, uniquely located, re-identifiable items.\nPhysical processes of a suitable sort can accomplish this task as\nwell. Moreover, even if material things were the only candidates for\nepistemically reidentifiable items, it still would be an open question\nhow we should interpret things ontologically. To be sure, the rebuttal\nof Strawson’s argument does not suffice to establish (Claim 1),\nbut it keeps process philosophy in the running. \nThe best way to show that the core assumptions of the substance\nparadigm can be dispensed with is surely just to do it. For process\nphilosophy, as for any attempt at theory revision, the proof of the\npudding is in the eating. Since Whitehead’s process metaphysics\nis terminologically somewhat difficult to digest at first try,\ncontemporary processists increasingly take non-Whiteheadian routes\ninto process philosophy and proceed from linguistic ruminations and a\ncritical review of the traditional philosophical menu.  \nThis latter strand of contemporary analytical process philosophy\nbegins with Zeno Vendler’s (1957) and Anthony Kenny’s\n(1963) cognate classifications of “action types” in terms\nof “action verbs” (both of these classifications are,\nvia Gilbert Ryle’s observations about\n“‘try’ verbs” and “‘got it’\nverbs,” inspired by Aristotle’s distinction between\n‘coming about’ (kinesis) and ‘going\non’ (energeia)). Vendler and Kenny argued that actions\ncan be sorted into various types according to certain logical and\nlinguistic features of verbs denoting these actions. Vendler, for\nexample, operated with a fourfold classification, distinguishing among\n“states, activities, accomplishments, and achievements,”\nusing as criterial conditions (e.g.) whether the verb that expresses\nthe occurrence type in question needs the progressive in present\ntense, whether it can be combined with the verb “finish,”\nor whether it applies an any moment of a temporal interval at which it\napplies. Certain problems with Vendler’s and Kenny’s\nclassifications were first noted by Henk Verkuyl (1972) and Alexander\nMourelatos (1978), who pointed out that the distinctions that Vendler\nand Kenny tried to capture are not a matter of the lexical semantics\nof “action verbs” but ultimately of the semantics of\nentire sentences. This renders the classificatory task much more\ncomplex than Vendler and Kenny envisaged, and during the last three\ndecades the linguistic discussion has produced (under the keywords\n“Aktionsart,” “verbal aspect,” and\n“aspectuality”) a plethora of theories about the many\ndifferent ways in which natural languages express the dynamic aspects\nof a situation and, although themselves not process-based theories,\nprovide essential data for process-ontology. \nMourelatos also showed that the logical criteria of Vendler’s\nand Kenny’s classifications actually function in two ways: they\ncan be used to distinguish various types of occurrences such as\nprocesses and events, but they also highlight inferential analogies\nbetween processes and stuffs on the one hand, and events and things on\nthe other hand. Taking up this clue, analytical process ontologists\nhave offered various criteria sets for the classification of\noccurrences and their relationships to other\n categories,[6]\n although there is so far no consensus about the details of these\nclassificatory set-ups, and there are disagreements as well about\nwhich formal theory, if any, should be employed to formulate the\nrelevant logical distinctions, and which dynamic category or\ncategories should be basic and which derived. Most, but not all,\nanalytical process ontologists agree that ‘activity-like,’\nnon-developmental processes or ‘goings-on’ should be\ndistinguished from ‘accomplishment-like,’ developmental\nprocesses or ‘comings-about.’ Some analytical processists\ncharacterize processes (or which ever label is used for the basic\ncategory) as dynamic individuals that are concrete particulars. By\ncontrast, elaborating on Mourelatos’ insights, Seibt has worked\nout a monocategoreal ontology (“General Process Theory”)\nbased on a conception of processes as non-particular individuals,\nwhich, like stuffs, are individuated in terms of their actual or\ntypical functioning alone, exist by permeating spacetime, and\ncan literally recur in space and\n time.[7]\n However, both particularist and non-particularist interpretations\nagree that processes cannot be individuated in terms of their\nspacetime location alone and cannot be identified with materially\nfilled space-time regions, thus parting company with\n“four-dimensionalism,” (a position in contemporary\nontology that is occasionally misunderstood as a process-based\napproach). Furthermore, while processists agree that processes combine\nand that they exhibit common features, there is disagreement on how to\narticulate such process combinations (e.g., by a special mereology)\nand whether the shared patterns of processes belong into a different\ncategory (as Whitehead suggested) or are themselves processes as\nwell. \nIn short, analytical process philosophy has worked out concepts and\ntheories of its own, however pedestrian and patchwork, as an\nalternative to Whitehead’s sophisticated system of categories,\nand there is a multitude of approaches within analytical process\nontology. Despite all differences in constructive detail, however,\nWhiteheadian and non-Whiteheadian process philosophy both recommend\nthemselves as gateways to renovating philosophical discourse. Here are\njust a few of the topics where processists promise philosophical\nadvance.  \n(i) Beginning with a familiar Whiteheadian move, the rejection of the\ntraditional “bifurcation of nature” into a physical and a\nmental domain, the process approach opens up new ways of looking at a\nwide variety of issues. Whiteheadians argue that the traditional\nmind-body problem dissolves if all basic constituents of reality are\nshort-lived processes of information transfer that exhibit both\n‘mental’ and ‘physical’ aspects in different\naccentuations according to context. Quite independently of\nWhitehead’s philosophy and commitments to panpsychism, a number\nof analytical philosophers have argued that the present-day debate in\nphilosophy of mind and philosophy of action has been hampered by an\nontology that is focused on upshots (states, and state-like events)\nand promote a theoretical ‘Gestalt’ switch in the\nmetaphysics of experience and agency (Stout 2017). Helen Steward\n(1997, 2012) criticizes the standard conception of perception and\nagency as a causal sequence of states, some of which are physical and\nsome mental; in order to make room for agentive freedom within the\nnatural world Steward proposes that we view agency as a special form\nof downward causation, taking our bearings from the hierarchical\nsystems of functioning in biological organisms (2017). Others have\npointed out that our common sense (teleological) explanations of\nactions commit us to ongoing occurrences (Stout 1996) or that we can\nbest make sense of the unity of our experience if we take processes to\nbe the objects of our experiences rather than states or things\n(Soteriou\n 2013).[8] \n(ii) Similarly, as non-Whiteheadian analytical processists have\npointed out, process metaphysics reconfigures the traditional problem\nof universals since it abandons the substance-metaphysical principle\nthat concrete entities are fully determinate while general or\nindeterminate entities are abstract (i.e., they must not be, undergo,\nor initiate\n changes).[9] \n(iii) Processists also have offered novel approaches to the problem of\npersistence, either by taking persistent entities to be\n“enduring” patterns of processes (Whitehead), or by\nquestioning the idea that “perdurance” vs.\n“endurance” accounts of persistence form a theoretically\nnecessary exclusive\n dichotomy.[10] \n(iv) The dichotomy of ‘fact’ and ‘norm,’ some\nprocessists argue, is another traditional “bifurcation”\nthat can be bridged. Some natural processes realize a certain form of\nlow-degree normativity. In some process organizations (e.g.,\nfar-from-equilibrium systems) each component process presupposes every\nother for its own occurrence; in the context of these particular\nprocess organizations the dependence amongst the single processes is\nnot merely a matter of linear causation but constrained by the\nsimultaneous interactions of the entire system, ensuring that each\nprocess is ‘functional for’ the occurrence of the\n system.[11] \n(v) Finally, the process approach also makes a difference in the realm\nof philosophy of religion. While the opposition between\n“immanence” and “transcendence” traditionally\nis taken to amount to an exclusive alternative, whether in application\nto universals or to God, the tools of process metaphysics allow us to\npursue a third option that exploits the explanatory grammar of the\n‘mode.’ We often consider the mode or way in which a\nprocess, or collection of processes, occurs as a separate kind of\nprocess (compare, e.g., scratching a violin string with a bow vs.\nplaying a tone on the violin, or free market economy vs. planned\neconomy). Processes that are modifications of other processes are both\nimmanent in the sense that they affect (by constraining and enabling)\nhow the modified processes occur, but are transcendent in the sense\nthat they are multiply realizable, that is, they are not themselves\ndependent on the particular spatio-temporal occurrences of the\nprocesses that realize\n them.[12] \nIn addition, there is a host of other contemporary issues where\nattention to processes generates novel answers that advance our\nunderstanding of the familiar questions of philosophy in important\nways, even without challenging some central, defining, dichotomy.\nCases in point are the ‘process account of causation’\n(Salmon 1984,\n 1997)[13]\n or N. Rescher’s processist analysis of knowledge. Offering\ndetailed reconstructions of the procedures of knowledge production,\nRescher argues that rational inquiry, including science, is the\nprocess of creating coherent theories that systematize what we have\nestablished as data with increasing complexity (Rescher 1982). That\nthis method of inquiry can yield (temporary) truths is justified by\nits practical success, but the method is essentially (a) interminable\nand (b) progressive, since: (a1) each knowledge claim contains\npresuppositions that raise new questions; (a2) reality is\n“cognitively inexhaustible”; and (b) since the increasing\ncomplexification of scientific knowledge can count as cognitive\nprogress, even though such progress may not be discernible as\ncumulative or linear advance (Rescher 1977, 1978, 1984). For claims\n(a2) and (b) Rescher supplies process-metaphysical underpinnings,\nendorsing a view of nature as continuously evolving and a view of\nevolution as directed towards increasing complexity (Rescher 1996,\n2006 ch. 10, and 2012; see also below section 6). \nPerhaps the clearest example for the progress that a processist\napproach can bring to longstanding tasks of philosophy is in the\ntheory of selfhood and personhood. Whatever cultural notions of\n‘person’ and ‘self’ we may have acquired, our\nimmediate self-awareness reveals us to ourselves as engaged in doings\nand undergoings. What we find ourselves to be doing and undergoing we\nunderstand as belonging to a space of possible occurrences. We notice\npatterns in what might possibly be going on with us, and some of these\npatterns we use to identify ourselves: in terms of our talents,\nskills, capabilities, traits, dispositions, habits, inclinations, and\ntendencies to action and inaction. It is integral to your\nself-awareness at this moment that your reading is yours, the\nreading of a self that is the same over time. But the sameness of this\nself we experience not as the sameness of a time-invariant thing but\nas the sameness of an ‘operation’ of integration—an\nongoing unification of experienced patterns in ways that enable a\nfirst-person perspective. Some process philosophers have taken the\nexperience of dynamic sameness in self-experience as the basis for\nconstructing a process-metaphysical account of personhood that defines\nthe core self as a unified manifold of actions and capacities,\ntendencies, and dispositions to (physical or psychical) actions (see\ne.g. Rescher 1996 ch.6). In this way they preserve a concept of\npersonhood that renders the self or ego experientially accessible. The\nunity of a person is a unity of experience—the coalescence of\nall of one’s diverse micro-experiences as part of one unified\nmacro-process. Importantly, processists do not equate the\ncross-temporal unity of a person-process with a sequence of momentary\ntotal states of consciousness, as neo-Humean accounts currently\npostulate; rather, it is the sort of unity of process that links each\nminute’s happenings into a single overall journey. From the\nprocess point of view a self just is the complex process\ncomposed of various physical interactions, experiences, feelings,\nmoods, and actions in their systemic interrelationship. The whole\nindividual person is continuously ‘in the making’ or being\nconstituted, yet it also continuously influences which components\n(e.g., experiences, feelings, actions) enter into the constitution of\nthe whole and in which ways these components occur. Such circular\ndependencies between a whole and its parts cannot be accommodated\nwithin a theory of individuals that is committed to the basic\nconstructional principles of the substance paradigm, especially the\nclaim that concrete individuals are fully determinate. Relationships\nof mutual constitution are legitimate theoretical tools within process\nontologies where entangled recursive definitions are not in conflict\nwith basic tenets about individual entities. By extending the dynamic\ndependencies among the component processes of a self to include\naspects of the person’s physical and social context, a process\naccount of persons can formulate in a differentiated and\nscientifically informed fashion various claims about the formative\nrole of our\n environments.[14] \nHarking back to (Claim 2) and (Claim 3) above, extant process-geared\ntreatments of familiar topics surely provide considerable support for\nthe claim that process philosophy is viable (Claim 2). But in the eyes\nof many processists (Claim 3) matters most—as the next section\nwill sketch, currently it may be process philosophy’s primary\nasset that it enables us to articulate and address important new\nquestions raised by modern science. \nThe relationship to science and technology appears to mark a\ndistinctive difference between continental process philosophy\n(Heidegger, Deleuze, Badiou) on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\nearly American process philosophy (Peirce, James, Dewey, Whitehead,\nMead) as well as current analytical process thought. While the former\ndevelops a critical point of view to reflect on the enterprises of\nscience and technology as cultural objects, the latter aligns its\ninvestigations with the aims and spirit of science and technology. In\nfact, the early phase of process philosophy in America was mainly\nmotivated by an effort to come to terms with the far-reaching\nphilosophical implications of the Darwinian theory of evolution. For\nthese early American process thinkers evolution was an emblematic and\nparadigmatic process—it seemed to provide a clear template for\nunderstanding how novelty and innovation come into both the human\nworld and the world of nature. The evolutionary framework calls for a\nnew metaphysics, the American pragmatists argued, which could\narticulate the pervasive role of process and of the passage of time.\nWas there a vehicle or substance that could ‘carry’\nphysical, biological, and cosmic evolution? If neither individuals nor\ntypes (species) of things are time-invariant, a new account of being\nwas needed that had room for the emergence of novelty in nature, and\ncould convey a sense of human existence as both “precarious and\nstable” (Dewey). The idea that evolution was a fact that\nphilosophy had to accommodate explains many of the elements of early\nAmerican process thought, in particular the understanding of\ndynamicity as a force of creating novelty, as well as the need to take\na stance on the question whether the overall process of reality is\ndirected or blind—which ultimately split the group (see section\n6). \nPresent-day contributions to analytical process philosophy are no\nlonger driven by an attempt of making sense of evolution. However,\nthey are often still motivated by the view that there are certain\nresults in science that philosophy simply must come to grips with, and\nif that involves a fundamental revision of the standard tools of\nphilosophy, then this is an area upon which philosophy must focus,\nfollowing in the train of science. Researchers in the philosophy of\nbiology and in the philosophy of chemistry have argued that\nprocess-based or process-geared approaches yield better ontological\ndescriptions of these domains, i.e., better capture the inferential\ncontent of the basic concepts of biology and\n chemistry.[15]\n The case of biology provides particularly strong empirical\nmotivations for a ‘process turn,’ as witnessed by a recent\ncollection of research in philosophy of biology that deserves special\nattention since most of its contributors do not proceed from but\narrive at process-ontological theses (Nicholson and Dupré\nforthcoming). As the editors point out, metabolism, lifecycles, and ecological interdependencies, i.e.\ntypes of dynamic phenomena that occur both at the level of cell biology\nas well as at the level of multicellular organism, present three\nclasses of phenomena that in\ndifferent ways dismantle substance-ontological presumptions; these\nphenomena call for an ontology that treats transtemporal sameness as a\ntime-scale dependent feature of process systems and models organisms\nno longer as independent and comparatively discrete substance but as a\ncomplex network of internal and external\n interactions.[16] \nBut there are other domains and topics of science that, as processists\nstress, directly imply a process-based metaphysics. For, on\nthe one hand, it appears that the conceptual contents of the relevant\nscientific terms cannot, without problematic distortions, be analyzed\nin terms of the categories of substance metaphysics. On the other\nhand, the researchers working in these areas have already adopted a\nlargely processist perspective in their informal glosses of\nmathematical descriptions and in their heuristic approach to the\ndomain. Among the various cases in point for either one or both of\nthese claims are (i) quantum physics, (ii) self-organization, and,\nmost recently, (iii) embodied cognition. \n(i) Quantum-physical processes: When Whitehead turned from\nmathematics to philosophy, he was quite aware that recent developments\nin physics (the demise of classical atomism in the face of quantum\ntheory and relativity theory) had thrown out our old common-sense\nvision of the order of the universe. Quantum physics brought on the\ndematerialization of physical matter—matter in the small could\nno longer be conceptualized as a Rutherfordian planetary system of\nparticle-like objects. The entities described by the mathematical\nformalism seemed to fit the picture of a collection of fluctuating\nprocesses organized into apparently stable structures by statistical\nregularities—i.e., by regularities of comportment at the level\nof aggregate phenomena. During the early decades of the twentieth\ncentury process philosophers were excited by the evidence that physics\nhad turned the tables on the core refuge of substance metaphysics:\nclassical atomism. Instead of very small things (atoms)\ncombining to produce standard processes (avalanches, snowstorms)\nmodern physics seemed to suggest that very small processes (quantum\nphenomena) combine to produce standard things (ordinary macro-objects)\nas a result of an as yet not understood modus operandi that\ncould, nevertheless, be mathematically described. So-called enduring\n“things” in this picture would come about through the\nemergence of stabilities in statistical fluctuations, as a stability\nwave in a surging sea of process, metaphorically speaking. \nContemporary quantum physics has produced a more diversified theory\nlandscape, and it is an open question whether we have moved beyond the\npoint where Whitehead’s metaphysical transposition of the field\nconcept is still pertinent, or could be adjusted to interpret also one\nof the currently competing\n theories.[17]\n However, very generally speaking, there are at least four basic\naspects of our current views of the quantum-physical domain that seem\nto favor a process metaphysics, whether Whiteheadian or\nnon-Whiteheadian. First, as the so-called ‘problem of identical\nparticles’ indicates, in the microphysical domain individuation\nand countability fall asunder, which calls for an ontology of\n‘subject-less’ processes that are the features by\nwhich we individuate quantum-physical entities, but occur in countable\nunits only relative to interaction context. Second, if spacetime is\nquantized and emergent, metaphysics cannot operate with basic entities\nthat are individuated in terms of their spacetime locations. Third,\nthe “measurement problem” presents a particular difficulty\nfor substance metaphysics, since the latter rests on the assumption\nthat all individuals are fully determinate independently of their\ninteraction context. In contrast, process metaphysics endorses the\nprinciple that ‘interaction is determination.’ Fourth,\nquantum entanglement (e.g., in EPR-Bohm systems) seems a clear-cut\nexample of ontic emergence that substance metaphysics cannot\naccommodate; while some systems properties (e.g., weight) can be\nconstrued as resulting directly from the causal properties of the\nelements of a collection of persistent substrata, the correlations\nthat measurements on entangled quantum entities display cannot be\ninterpreted in this fashion since the properties of the components of\nthe system do not exist independently of the measurement performed.\nThe measured correlations thus are properties of an interaction and\nnot of any substance. \nInterestingly, via the unlikely subject of the ontology of quantum\nphysics, new points of contact have opened up between analytical and\ninterpretive process thought in Karen Barad’s metaphysics of\n“agential realism” (Barad 2007). Grounded in a detailed\nscholarly interpretation of the philosophy of Niels Bohr, Barad views\nreality as the entanglement of natural and\nsocial“agencies” the distinctness of which emerges in the\nspecific “intra-actions” produced by specific physical\nset-ups (experiments); the continuous “intra-activity” of\nreality, Barad argues, calls for a non-essentialist, performatist\nunderstanding of meaning and values. \n(ii) Self-organization: Process metaphysics has traditionally\nbeen motivated by the fact that it seems to give the best explanation\nof the phenomena of emergence, originally understood as an integral\nfeature of evolution. Since the development of scientific theories of\n“self-organization,” “chaos,” and\n“complexity” have begun to alter our understanding of\nevolutionary change, there is a new need for a metaphysics that can\naccommodate all sorts of phenomena where dynamic organizations exert\ncausal constraints. While older, speculative, process metaphysics\nembraced the idea of purposes and creativity in nature, and allowed\nfor the explanatory category of a ‘self-realizing’ or\n‘self-engendering’ entity (in various terminological\nguises), present-day analytical processists confine themselves to\narguing that “downward causation” becomes perfectly\nintelligible once physicalism has been divorced from the assumptions\nof the substance paradigm, and most especially from the principle that\ncausal powers cannot be attributed to dynamic\n organizations.[18] \n(iii) Embodied cognition: The turn to “embodied\ncognition” in cognitive science provides another strong\nmotivation for the turn to process in metaphysics. The standard model\nof cognition as the computation of symbolic representations fits well\nwith the assumptions of substance metaphysics and suggested a pleasing\nanalogy to classical atomism: mental operations effect relational\nchange of cognitive atoms. But the first rivals to the standard model,\nconnectionism and the so-called “Dynamic Hypothesis” (Tim\nVan Gelder), were constructed along largely process-ontological lines,\nreplacing the classical conception of cognitions as discrete abstract\nobjects that represent concrete things outside the head with a dynamic\nconception of cognitions as modes of functionings of a neural net or\nof process organizations. Recent results in embodied cognition\nresearch seem to tip the balance further into the direction of a\nprocess-based philosophy of mind, since they suggest that the bodily\ninteraction of an organism plays a constitutive role in cognition.\nSome proponents of embodied cognition or “interactivism”\ninsist that the new focus on organism-environment interactions makes\nany talk about representations obsolete, while others argue for a\nnaturalist account of information, emergent representational processes, or emergent\n normativity.[19]\n A key notion for the ‘embodiment thesis’ is the concept\nof “structural coupling,” a phase in the contemporaneous\ndevelopment of two systems (e.g., organism and environment) where\nmutual dynamic dependencies unfold across system boundaries. Critics\nargue that the embodiment thesis might only hold for some form of\ncognition, but whatever the scope of the thesis might be, the fact\nremains that a more detailed description of the notion of structural\ncoupling requires a process-ontological framework. \nProcess philosophers share the view that being is dynamic or that\nthere are no concrete static entities; however, as stressed throughout\nthis entry, there are also profound differences in the way process\nphilosophers work out this basic intuition in their descriptions of\nthe structure of reality and our understanding of it. Which of the\ncompeting approaches to process philosophy can count as the currently\nmost promising? If processist theories recommend themselves in terms\nof their explanatory force, as offering new solutions to old problems\n(section 3), or better conceptual resources for new tasks (section 4),\nthen surely explanatory force should also be the standard for\nevaluating processist theories. But while cross-paradigm explanatory\nadvantages in the sense of sections 3 and 4 can be gauged more\nstraightforwardly, this becomes rather more difficult at the level of\nintra-paradigm comparisons. Does the wide scope of Whitehead’s\nphilosophy of organism outweigh the fact that all explanatory\ntechnical terms are dissociated from the rest of philosophical\ndiscourse? Or again, is the explanatory force of a formal axiomatic\nprocess ontology greater than a process metaphysics formulated with\nthe means of common sense terms whose meanings are carefully\ngerrymandered, or one that operates with a network of metaphors and\nrelies on the reader’s hermeneutic response? Here, at the\nintra-paradigm level, all the far-reaching methodological questions\naries that surround philosophical explanation in general. Setting\nthese larger questions aside, and focusing just on processist work in\nthe style of analytic philosophy, the explanatory force of a\nprocessist theory may depend on how well it addresses the following\nchallenges. \nThe first challenge is to define the notion of dynamicity itself. If\nthe individuals of a processist theory are ‘dynamic’\nrather than ‘static,’ how can we make sense of this new\ncategory feature? Some processists say that a process or dynamic\nentity is denoted by an English sentence in the progressive, \nor—less closely tied to the peculiarities of English \ngrammar—by sentences licensing certain inferential patterns of\naspectual meaning (see footnote 6). In both cases the definitional\ntask is thus deferred to linguistic theories of aspect; these\ntheories, however, take the term ‘dynamic’ to be\nunderstood. Alternatively, one might return to Aristotle and define\ndynamicity as the actualization of a potency or capacity; this,\nhowever, saddles the theory with further primitive terms (but see\nEastman et al. 2016). Finally, following the strategies of German\nIdealism, one might try to exploit the semantics of self-referential\npropositions to convey ‘presence without availability’ as\nthe hallmark of dynamic being. Should process ontologies thus abandon\nthe idea of an explicit definition of dynamicity and settle for a\nsystematic elucidation (along the lines of axiomatic definition)? \nThe second challenge is to state precisely how processes relate to\nspace and time. Do processes in some fashion constitute space and\ntime, as Whitehead postulated? Or are they occupiers of spatiotemporal\nregions like perduring entities, just not static (and thus, for\nexample, providing better support for presentist accounts of time than\nclassical substances)? Upon a closer look, the distinction between\n“perdurance” and “endurance” (Mark Johnston,\nDavid Lewis), which is commonly (though perhaps not quite correctly)\nlinked to W.E. Johnson’s distinction between occurrents and\ncontinuants, sits badly with a process ontology. For\n‘activity-like’ processes (e.g., snowing) somehow seem to\ntake time just as perduring entities do, yet are “wholly\npresent” at every time at which they exist, just like enduring\nentities or continuants. Several authors thus have pointed out that\nprocesses behave like\n continuants.[20]\n As mentioned above in section 3, this opens up a new solution path\nfor the problem of persistence, but it also calls for a clear account\nof how ongoing developmental and activity-like processes are situated\nin time and space, and how they relate to extended temporal and\nspatial\n regions.[21] \nThe third challenge consists in describing the different ways in which\nprocesses relate to each other and especially, how they combine. Since\nprocess combinations may engender emergent processes, and also in\nother regards do not abide by the laws of Boolean algebra, neither set\ntheory not classical extensional mereology can be used as formal\nframeworks ontologically to describe and classify different types of\nprocess combinations. Moreover, since the parthood relation on\nprocesses is not transitive, at least when processes are not\nidentified with extended spatiotemporal regions, further deviations\nfrom the classical axiomatization of the parthood relations are\nnecessary to formalize a mereology on processes (Seibt 2015a).\nFurthermore, as illustrated by the process-philosophical account of\npersonhood sketched above in section 3, it is a particular asset of\nprocess theories that they can draw on dynamic structure with complex\nfeedback loops and wholes whose functioning both conditions and is\nconditioned by their parts.  \nThe fourth challenge is more fundamental. If any of the basic\ntheoretical terms of the many process philosophies, past and present,\nare to have explanatory value at all, there must be a way to tie the\nprocess philosopher’s basic intuition to ordinary experience.\nAfter all, the purpose of philosophy is to enhance human\nunderstanding, and the core concepts of philosophical explanations\nmust in some fashion be anchored in what we intuitively understand\nfrom everyday experience. In fact, some process philosophers (e.g.,\nWhitehead) argue that the traditional notion of substance (a\ntime-invariant, necessarily uniquely located particular) precisely\nlacks any experiential grounding. On the other hand, substance\nontology has been capitalizing on the fact that the canonical\nillustrations of substances, things or living things, loom large in\nour practical interactions. The explanatory force of a process\nontology thus will depend on whether it is possible to identify a\nsimilarly salient canonical illustration for whatever technical notion\nof process is postulated as basic category. Some process approaches\nuse self-experience as anchoring canonical illustration for postulated\ntechnical notions of dynamic sameness and unity, but one might worry\nthat this model is all too complex. \nAs emphasized throughout, process philosophy is a complex and highly\ndiversified field that is difficult to describe in more than general\nand disjunctive terms. In conclusion this section will highlight a\ntopic on which contemporary process philosophers are fundamentally\ndivided, to the extent that one group believes that the entire issue\nis ill-conceived. \nAs Rescher (1996, ch. 5) points out, processists fall into two\nprincipal camps. On the one side is the teleological (and often\ntheological) wing that sees nature’s processuality as a matter\nof teleological directedness towards a positive destination. On the\nother side is the naturalistic (and generally secularist) wing that\nsees nature’s processuality as a matter of an inner dynamicity\nwithout any directness or at least without any directedness towards a\nspecifiable destination. Both agree in according a central role to\ninherent dynamicity in nature. But the one (naturalistic) wing sees\nthis in terms of randomness that leads in arbitrary ways away from the\nsettled formulations of an established past, while the other\n(teleological) wing sees this in terms of a goal-directed\npurposiveness preestablished by some value-geared directive force. \nThe division between secular and theological process philosophy has\nits roots in the early phase of contemporary process thought in late\n19th and the first half of the 20th century, and centers on two views\nof evolutions. For secular, atheological processists evolution\ntypifies the creative workings of a self-sustaining nature that\nfulfills the vision of a certain positivist program, dispensing\naltogether with a God function to explain any of the events in or\nappertaining to the\n universe.[22]\n For theological processists like Teilhard de Chardin, however,\nevolution exhibits God’s handwriting in the book of nature. \nPresent-day processists, who in the main no longer take Darwinian\nevolution as a concept or phenomenon that demands a commitment for or\nagainst theism, are wont to point to possible areas of agreement (see\nRescher ibid.). First, present-day processists point out that both\nsecular and theological protagonists of process thought can see\nevolution not only as a crucial instrument for understanding the role\nof intelligence in the world’s scheme of things but also as a\nkey aspect of the world’s natural development. In addition, both\nsecular and theological processists can agree that the evolutionary\nprocess provides process philosophy with one of its main models for\nhow large scale collective processes can inhere in and result from the\noperation of numerous small-scale individual processes, thus\naccounting for innovation and creativity also on a macro-level scale.\nSecond, present-day processists draw attention to the fact that early\nprocess thinkers were divided in their assessment of the phenomenon of\nevolution, since they failed to draw a division within the phenomenon\nof evolution itself. Undoubtedly, human intelligence is based on\nteleologically blind natural selection operating with random mutations\nto produce the neurophysiological capacities of the human brain.\nCultural evolution, on the other hand, does not share these features\nand could well appear as in some sense directed. For example, one\nmight argue that cultural evolution is generally Teilhardian, in that\nit is governed by a rationality-geared selection among purposefully\ndevised mutational variations. Cognitive evolution involves both\nbiological and cultural components, superimposing non-random rational\ndecision-making on biological selection. Our cognitive capacities and\nfaculties are part of the natural endowment we owe to biological\nevolution. But our cognitive methods, procedures, standards, and\ntechniques are socio-culturally developed resources that evolve\nthrough rationality-geared decision making in the process of cultural\ntransmission through successive generations. Our cognitive hardware\n(mechanisms and capacities) develops through Darwinian natural\nselection, but our cognitive software (the methods and procedures by\nwhich we transact our cognitive business) develops in a Teilhardian\nprocess of rationality-geared decision-making that involves purposeful\nintelligence-guided variation and selection. In the eyes of\npresent-day processists—at least those that no longer pursue\nspeculative process thought—it is for scientific research to\ndecide whether, and to what extent, the relationship between\nbiological and cognitive evolution can be understood on the analogy\nthat ‘biology produces the instrument and culture writes the\nmusic,’ with the instrument constraining the playable music, and\nnot vice versa (cf. Rescher 1996 ch. 5 and Rescher 2006 ch.\n10). \nThere is a middle ground between strict theological teleology on the\none hand, and, on the other hand, the naturalistic view that there is\nno final end that all processes are ultimately directed towards.\nAccording to this third alternative, a ‘soft’ version of\nthe teleological position, process is progress. For, so goes this line\nof reasoning, one can draw a lesson from evolutionary theory about\ncollective progress despite contingency and mortality at the scale of\nthe individual organism. In the small – i.e., item by item\n– nature’s processes are self-canceling: what arises in\nthe course of time perishes in the course of time. But nevertheless,\nso the argument goes, (i) the overall course of processual change\ntends to the development of ever richer, more complex and\nsophisticated conditions of occurrence. Moreover, Darwinian\nevolutionism suggests (ii) that \n… the arrangements which do succeed in establishing\nand perpetuating themselves will as a general tendency manage to have\ndone so because they represent actual improvements in one way or\nanother. … Accordingly, fruitfulness in the long run\ncompensates for transiency and mortality at a smaller scale of\noccurrence. (Rescher 1996: 102) \nThese two central premises for soft teleology are quite substantive,\nhowever. Premise (i) presupposes that (iii) there is a general and\ncomprehensive measure of simplicity or complexity that could be\napplied to natural and cultural processes in order to claim an overall\ntendency of development towards increased complexity; in particular,\nsuch a measure of complexity should make it possible to offset\ndecreases of complexity with respect to one parameter by increases in\ncomplexity relative to another parameter. Premise (ii) presupposes\nthat (iv) species survival can be taken as an indication of some\naspect that meaningfully can be connected to the axiology of progress.\nWhether the optimism of the soft teleological position is justified\nthus ultimately depends on the tenability of claims (iii) and\n(iv).[23] The\nfact that the premises for soft teleology have direct implications for\nour current debate about transhumanism endows the old question of the\ndirectionality of reality with unexpected practical relevance for the\nregulation of artificial intelligence and robotics.  \nProcess thought constituted a prominent sector of the active\nphilosophical scene in the USA during the first half of the 20th\ncentury. Apart from the proliferation of books and articles on the\ntopic, it has achieved considerable institutionalization in the USA\nduring the years after World War II. Indications of this phenomenon\ninclude the formation of the Society for Process Studies, as\nwell as the prominence of process philosophizing within the aegis of\nthe Society for American Philosophy and the American\nMetaphysical Society. Another clear token is the journal\nProcess Studies, published by the Center for Process\nStudies in Claremont CA, and founded in 1971 by Lewis S. Ford and\nJohn B. Cobb, Jr., a publication that has become a major vehicle for\narticle-length discussions in the field. Representatives of process\nphilosophy occupy influential posts in departments of philosophy and\nof religious studies in many of American universities and colleges,\nand some half-dozen doctoral dissertations are produced annually in\nthis field. But contemporary process philosophy is not geographically\nconfined. In 2002, the publishing house Ontos in Frankfurt, Germany,\nlaunched a book series on “Process Thought”; though taken\nover by DeGruyter in 2015, over 25 volumes have appeared. In Europe\nthe Center for Practical Philosophy at the Université\ndu Louvain, Belgium, directed by Michel Weber, is a focal point for\nresearch on, and applications of, international process philosophy.\nThe Bulgarian Academy of Science recently created a Center for\nProcess Studies for philosophers and computer scientists. The\nGerman Whitehead Society regularly organizes conferences and\nsummer schools on both Whiteheadian and non-Whiteheadian process\nthought. The International Process Network, recently launched\nby Mark Dibben at the University of Tasmania, Australia, is a new web\ncommunity of international process philosophers of all philosophical\nproveniences East and West. Even though process philosophy is not\ninstitutionalized as such everywhere in the global field of\nphilosophy, it is a research paradigm that currently is in use all\naround the world.","contact.mail":"filseibt@cas.au.dk","contact.domain":"cas.au.dk"}]
