In Sanskrit, he wrote a philosophic\nmasterpiece called the “Jewel” solidifying\nseveral centuries of advances in epistemology and logic within the\nclassical school of “Logic,” Nyāya. By all counts,\nGaṅgeśa is one of the major figures not only in\nNyāya but in the whole long and complex history of classical\nphilosophy. Gaṅgeśa is traditionally taken to inaugurate\n“New” Logic, Navya Nyāya. However, the\ndistinction between “Old” and “New” Nyāya\nis problematic, since over the tradition’s almost\ntwo-thousand-year history there are both numerous developments and\nsolid lines of continuity. At no time is there a decisive revolution,\nnot with Gaṅgeśa, and also not with Udayana, the\neleventh-century Naiyāyika whom Gaṅgeśa follows more\nclosely than any other thinker and whom scholars sometimes identify as\nthe originator of Navya Nyāya. However, Nyāya’s\nmethods of investigation and argumentation on a wide range of topic,\nand against opponents’ views—Buddhists in the early years,\nothers later—do indeed become increasingly refined, and\nGaṅgeśa’s work can in several ways be counted\npivotal.\n\n\nNyāya is a multi-dimensional system of interlocking views that\nbelies the stereotype of Indian philosophy as idealist and mystical in\norientation. The school’s founding text is the\nNyāya-sūtra (c. 100 CE), which had elicited tomes\nof commentary long before Gaṅgeśa. Nyāya is broadly\nrealist about objects talked about and experienced everyday.\nGaṅgeśa advances what may be called a reliabilist theory of\nknowledge and justification, indeed a super-reliabilism, an\ninfallibilism for externalists in the sense that sources of\nknowledge—perception, inference, analogy, and testimony, his\nmain focus—are conceived factively. Among his most major\naccomplishments are definitions of knowledge in general and of natural\n“pervasions” as underpinning inference as well as analyses\nof conditions governing meaning in knowledge-transfers through\ntestimony. He is also known for crisp treatments of the major types of\nfallacy and epistemic defeater. Gaṅgeśa presents, defending\nin long passages, (a) an argument for a self as a special type of\nsubstance, (b) a theistic argument that illustrates his theory of\ndebate and reasoning in great detail, and (c) a defense of the\npossibility of “liberation,” mukti, that both\nenlivens the views of very early Nyāya—in particular\nVātsyāyana (c. 400 CE)—and becomes influential in\nseveral other traditions and schools. Nyāya itself has a lively\nliterature that extends to the modern period and, among the\ntraditionally learned, to our own day.\n\nGaṅgeśa lived in the first half of the fourteenth century,\nin Mithilā, in northeastern India, where he was a prominent\nteacher, both of Nyāya, including logic and critical reasoning,\nand of Mīmāṃsā, the school known for Vedic\ninterpretation and ritual. Gaṅgeśa endorses Nyāya in\nhis Jewel, but he was also a great master of\nMīmāṃsā. Mīmāṃsā is a\nlong-running tradition which, like Nyāya, pronounces on almost\nevery topic imaginable, along with Vedic ritual, the school’s\nspecialization, as Nyāya’s is critical reasoning.\nGaṅgeśa knew well Mīmāṃsaka positions in\nboth of its major branches, the Bhāṭṭa (after\nKumārila Bhaṭṭa of the seventh century), and the\nPrābhākara (after Kumārila’s renegade student,\nPrabhākara). And Gaṅgeśa may be supposed to have\nlearned the standard curricula in the grammarian literature, the epic\npoems, etc., some of which he cites, for example, Pāṇini\n(c. 500 BCE), and, in several places, the Bhagavad\nGītā. \nBhattacharya cites data from literary and other sources, and in about\na dozen pages devoted to Gaṅgeśa (1958: 96–109)\nprovides termini a quo et ad quem—1300 and 1350 for his\nperiod of flourishing—from evidence that has not been corrected\nto date. Genealogical records kept in Mithilā suggest that he had\na wife and three sons and a daughter. One child was the famous\nNyāya author, Vardhamāna. Gaṅgeśa apparently\nachieved quite some fame during his lifetime, referred to as\n“jagad-guru,” which would be the rough equivalent\nof “Distinguished University Professor” for the\neducational institutions of his time. \nAbout the person little more is known. About\nGaṅgeśa’s reputation, Bhattacharya says (1958: 109):\n“The work of Gaṅgeśa became highly popular very soon\nand was studied and commented upon in various centers of culture of\nIndia. It not only cast the works of the old school of logic into\noblivion but the neo-logical works of his predecessors also faded into\ninsignificance and were gradually were forgotten due to its\noverwhelming popularity and all-embracing character.” Concerning\nthe part on inference, the learned sanskritist writes (1958: 107,\n108): “The second part on Anumāna (Inference) is by far the\nmost popular, though the most intricate of the whole book. …\nThe latest phase of Navyanyāya studies in India for about two\ncenturies flowed through a large number of channels cut by single\nsentences or phrases of this part of Gaṅgeśa’s work\nand by far the widest channel emerged from the general definition of\nFallacy. It has now assumed proportions through the efforts of all the\nbest Indian brains in Navyanyāya, which is a world’s wonder\nin the field of intellectual feats … .” \nThe Jewel has four chapters, each devoted to a source of\nknowledge: perception, inference, analogy, and testimony. Within a\nchapter are clearly delineated sections on various subtopics including\nlong reflections, mainly in the first chapter, concerning knowledge in\ngeneral and how it is known. Gaṅgeśa is lucid and precise,\nleading the reader into a preferred position by careful examination of\nalternatives. \nGaṅgeśa’s central focus is epistemology, not ontology\nor metaphysics, but his analyses rely on a centuries-old ontological\nsystem. In all four chapters of the Jewel, he addresses\nontological issues, especially the topics of universals and of the\nontological relation of qualification that is reflected in knowledge\nof something as qualified by a qualifier, “That’s a\ncow,” for instance, which would be an instance of knowledge of\nsomething qualified by the universal being-a-cow. \nThe system that Gaṅgeśa takes over is inherited in\nparticular from his “teacher” Udayana. In a dozen\ntreatises, Udayana merges the separate literature and worldview of\nVaiśeṣika—its advocates sometimes called\n“Atomists” —with Nyāya’s. Udayana also\nadded the category of absence to the\nVaiśeṣika-sūtra’s six, so that there\nare seven basic types of things possibly referred to in technical\nworks as in everyday life: \nThere are also properties and entities that do not fit very well into\nthe typology. Some philosophers after Gaṅgeśa rework the\nsystem, but Gaṅgeśa himself is ontologically conservative,\npresenting arguments for its expansion in various ways without\nendorsement. \nGaṅgeśa also inherits a causal schema that is crucial to\nhis causal theory of knowledge. Perception and the other sources\ngenerate knowledge instances, in the sense of being the\n“chief instrumental cause.” To understand this, we have to\nknow that there are most generally three varieties of cause-effect\nrelationship: \nGaṅgeśa, like other Naiyāyikas, also works with the\ndistinction between the necessary and the sufficient, sufficient\ncausality being a whole bundle of causal conditions, including general\nones such as time and space. A source of knowledge is a process of\nknowledge generation, and each has a distinct “trigger.” A\ntrigger is that instrumental cause which, when all the other causal\nconditions necessary for an effect are in place, brings it about. The\ntrigger of perceptual knowledge is said to be connection of a sensory\norgan with an object to be known. The trigger of knowledge by\ninference is said to be reflection on a property of an object as\npervaded by—invariably associated with—another property,\nthe former called the prover—the pervaded—and the latter\nthe probandum—the pervader. The trigger of testimonial knowledge\nis said to be the statement of a trustworthy expert as comprehended by\nthe hearer, a trustworthy expert being defined as someone who knows\nthe truth and wants to communicate it faithfully, without lying or\ndeceiving. Causal relations are especially important because knowledge\nof the occurrence of an effect allows the knower to infer any one or\nmore of its necessary conditions, as perception of smoke rising from a\nmountain allows one to infer fire. Furthermore, recognizing a\nparticular knowledge source by its trigger is one way to certify a\nresult, an instance of testimonial knowledge for instance. \nGaṅgeśa often utilizes a simpler ontological schema in his\nanalyses of the generation of knowledge: an instance of knowledge is\nabout, at a minimum, a qualifier-qualificandum, the hyphen\nstanding for the qualificative relation, also discussed, with\nqualificanda as property-bearers, anything we can talk about,\nincluding universals and supervenient properties such as similarity,\nand qualifiers as qualities or universals or even mind-imposed\nproperties that, as suggested, do not seem to have a place in the\ntraditional layout. No matter, we can deal with these later, seems to\nbe Gaṅgeśa’s attitude, as he proceeds to focus on\nknowledge and its generators. \nGaṅgeśa’s Nyāya embraces realism along several\ndimensions, realism in the sense of commitment to entities that exist\nindependently of consciousness. There are, however, exceptions in the\nproperties of a self along with some others that do require\nconsciousness to occur. Knowledge itself and other mental phenomena\nare counted as reals and knowable intersubjectively, for instance.\nRealism leads Naiyāyikas to embrace fallibilism from very early,\nbecause the transcendence, so to say, of a physical object to the\ninstruments of knowledge is seen to mean that the possibility of error\ncannot be ruled out—except in the case of apperception,\naccording to Gaṅgeśa (see below). The Jewel is\nfilled out with numerous definitional projects where the definienda\n(instances of knowledge, for example, as well as physical objects),\nare realities. And all individuals of whatever fundamental type\n(substance, quality, motion, universal, inherence, individuator, and\nabsence) are viewed as reals, although the mind can create fictions.\nAgainst Buddhist subjectivists, it is argued that the components of\nfalse and fictional awarenesses themselves indicate reals. Gold and\nmountains are real but maybe not a gold mountain. More about illusion\nand other instances of non-knowledge in practically every subsection\nbelow. \nThe target of epistemological evaluations in classical India is not\nbelief but rather cognition, which, however, like belief in the West,\nis viewed as propositional. Buddhists, Naiyāyikas,\nMīmāṃsakas, and others address the issue of how a\nproposition-laden cognition is known to be true, or false, for that\nmatter. Against Mīmāṃsakas in particular,\nGaṅgeśa advances an “extrinsicality” position.\nAlthough presumptive presentations of “fresh news” through\nany of the sources—perception and the others—are naturally\nand automatically taken to be veridical, according to\nGaṅgeśa’s Nyāya, it takes a separate cognitive\nact to determine whether a cognition is knowledge or\n“non-knowledge.” An awareness, an “experience”\n(anubhava, a term used technically in the system), defined as\nwhat a person takes to be presentation of news—i.e., takes\nautomatically to be new information—is presumptively knowledge\nbut on occasion is either false or not produced by a genuine knowledge\nsource, perception, inference, or testimony (analogy is, for\nGaṅgeśa, restricted to learning the meaning of words).\nAccording to Mīmāṃsā, certification is intrinsic\nto the apparent presentation. Gaṅgeśa’s refutation\ncenters on an alleged phenomenology of doubt and knowing that one\nknows. If the Mīmāṃsaka position were correct, it\nwould not be possible to doubt the veridicality of, for example, a\nperception that is indeed an instance of knowledge, both veridical and\nproduced in the right way. But it is possible, he says. \nCertification happens through source identification, and the sources\nare known mainly by inference from certain tell-tale signs called\n“merits,” guṇa, while falsification occurs\nthrough recognizing tell-tale signs of pseudo-sources called\n“flaws,” doṣa. Various fallacies, for\nexample, are flaws with respective to putative knowledge as determined\nby way of inference. In certain cases, however, in contrast to the\nnorm, there is practically self-certification, as the\nMīmāṃsakas claim. For example, perception is like that\nwith knowing that there is a small piece of āmalaka\nfruit in the palm of your hand. Much discussion throughout the\nJewel centers on certification conditions, some of which\nfigure in the definitions of the several sources. There is also much\nconcern with specification of the trigger, or triggers, of the\nworkings of the sources, which not only can serve to define them but\nwhose identification is one way certification proceeds. \nThe processes of perception, inference, analogy, and testimony\ngenerate “awareness,” anubhava, a technical term,\nas mentioned, meaning “presentation of fresh news.” No\nnon-veridical awarenesses are produced from the sources, but there are\nof course occasions when we are fooled. There are pseudo-sources,\nprocesses closely resembling the true ones, but flawed in some way and\ngenerating wrong results. Consonantly, there are awarenesses that at\nthe time we take to be telling us something true in the usual\nfashions—by perception and the rest—but are actually false\nor not produced correctly. These are instances of\n“non-knowledge,” apramā, contrasting with\npramā, “knowledge,” entailing truth and\nright production. \nPragmatic considerations reinforce our natural tendency to take the\ndeliverances of the sources to be veridical. We couldn’t get\nalong in the world without knowledge, as Naiyāyikas as early as\nVātsyāyana stress (1996: 2). This is a recurrent theme.\nGaṅgeśa relies on “pragmatic contradiction” to\nrefute a skeptic about inference in the Jewel’s\n“Hypothetical Reasoning” section (2020: 647–51): \nWhen there is doubt, there is no regular pattern of behavior. When\nthere is a regular pattern, doubt does not occur. Thus it has been\nsaid (by Udayana): “That is doubted concerning which as doubted\nthere occurs no contradiction with the doubter’s\naction.” \nFor it is not possible at once to resort regularly to fire and the\nlike for smoke and the like and to doubt that fire causes it. This is\nhow we should understand the saying. \nThus we may reject the argument that contradiction—understood as\nnatural opposition (virodha), governing precisely which F\ncannot occur along with precisely which G—cannot block an\ninfinite regress. It is the doubter’s own behavior that proves\nthe lie to the doubt, that blocks it (pratibandhaka). \nIt may be true that repeated observation (“even hundreds of\ntimes”) is insufficient to guarantee knowledge of a pervasion\n(pervasions underpin the natural entailments on which inference\ndepends). Not all things made out of earth are scratchable by iron;\ndiamonds, recently discovered, are a counterexample. Defending\npervasion-knowledge nevertheless, Gaṅgeśa cites this case\nin admitting that the possibility of a counterexample cannot be\neliminated, at least generally speaking. But we do grasp pervasions,\nand often meaningful doubt can be done away with. Absolute freedom\nfrom doubt is not required to have knowledge. And knowledge guides\naction. We may be wrong in any particular case, but we act on the\nbasis of the regularities in nature we take ourselves to be aware of,\nautomatically making inferences producing knowledge. \nThe same goes for perception, analogy, and testimony. With testimony,\nfor example, we may be aware of a defeater, a speaker’s being a\nliar, for instance, but in such a case we do not take ourselves to be\npresented with news. Perceptual and other awarenesses do not occur\nwhen blocked, when defeated in this way. A good example is the fallacy\ncalled bādhita, “defeated in advance.” No\ninference purporting to show that fire is cold can be successful\nbecause we already know it’s hot. But of course some defeaters\noccur to us only later, and for a time we are fooled. In the market,\nwe learn that the piece of shell we thought was silver is really only\nmother-of-pearl. Awarenesses are presumptively knowledge, but are also\ndefeasible. The exception concerns certain matters known by\napperception (see below), which, Gaṅgeśa argues, are known\nwithout the possibility of being wrong. \nIn sum, the defeasibility character of Gaṅgeśa’s\ntheory of knowledge centers on the fact that apparently trustworthy\nsources of information at times mislead. But in those cases it is not\nreally the knowledge sources, perception, and the rest, that are at\nwork but rather close imitators. Knowledge sources\n(pramāṇa) themselves are inerrant. This makes the\nconcept of the apparent source central\n(pramāṇâbhāsa): “You can't really\nsee John from this distance.” Awareness naturally taken\nto be informative is presumptively true but the presumption can be\ndefeated. It can also be certified. Defeating and certifying belong to\na second-level of knowing where we are self-conscious about\njustification. But there, too, we give the benefit of the doubt,\nbādhakam vinā, “unless there is a\ndefeater.” In this way there is no justification regress as\nfeared by Western foundationalists and alleged by the second-century\nBuddhist Nāgārjuna (1978). \nIt is difficult to appreciate Gaṅgeśa’s reflection on\ncertification without knowing something about the\nMīmāṃsaka positions, called in general\n“self-certification,” which he attacks. Self-certification\nis embraced also by Yogācāra Buddhist philosophers, but\nGaṅgeśa focuses mainly on the arguments of\nPrābhākaras as voiced in particular by the ninth-century\nauthor Śālikanātha (1961). It seems that\nMīmāṃsakas would secure the authority of Vedic\ntestimony for rituals and various rules of everyday life effortlessly,\none suspects in overview, by maintaining that knowledge is\nself-certifying. Gaṅgeśa focuses, however, on perceptual\nknowledge, which, he maintains, can, in certain circumstances, both be\ndoubted and later certified as knowledge. “I wouldn’t now\nbe drinking water, if the awareness had not been knowledge. But I am\nnow drinking, satisfying my thirst, and the awareness was knowledge\nindeed” (translator’s comments, Jewel 2020: 109).\nIn this case, the certification comes by way of an inference. Source\nidentification is another way of capturing the point. It is by\ninference that one determines that an awareness-generating process is\nindeeed perception, perception that is factively conceived. A genuine\nsource never misleads. Only “pseudo-sources” do. \nThere are different signs whereby one knows that an instance of\ninferential knowledge is both true and produced in the right way. Do\nwe really know the premises, in particular the alleged\n“pervasion,” vyāpti? For testimony,\ncertification conditions are the speaker’s being a trustworthy\nexpert along with conditions governing what it is to be a proper\nstatement and of course certain hearer conditions (such as knowing the\nlanguage). And in certain cases there is, admittedly,\nself-certification. But the Mīmāṃsakas are wrong to\ntake that to be the general rule. \nAs with the English word ‘perception’, the Sanskrit\n‘pratyakṣa’ so translated is used for both\nthe process of sensory connection with an object perceived and as the\nresultant awareness. In common Sanskrit, the word\n‘pratyakṣa’, etymologically “before\nthe eyes,” means something like “experientially\nevident” when used as an adjective and “immediate\nexperience” or “sense experience” as a noun.\nInternal perceptions as of thought and emotion, pleasure and pain, and\nindeed of a “self,” ātman, are considered in\nNyāya to be mediated by a “mind” or, in a better\ntranslation, an “internal organ,” manas. A\nperception that targets a preceding perception or another cognition or\nmental event is given a special word,\n‘anuvyayasāya’, “apperception,”\nliterally an “after-cognition,” a type of perception that\nis especially important in cross-school controversy. The internal\norgan, manas, also serves the function of channeling\ninformation from sense organs and bringing it together in perceptual\nknowledge for a self. Such a mental organ is denied by Buddhist\nadversaries and others in other schools, and is hotly debated within\nNyāya. \nThe processes of production of sensory awarness vary with modality and\nwith the type of thing perceived, earthen, watery, etc., universal or\nparticular, a group of things, something external or internal, and in\nways peculiar to perceivers. Neverthelesss, there are commonalities,\nespecially when it comes to the questions of epistemology, most\nprominently that innumerable instances of knowledge are sensorily\nproduced. But awareness produced by the senses is not how\nGaṅgeśa defines perceptual knowledge. If what was\nconsidered an instance of knowledge is discovered to be in fact a\nfalse belief, then we say in English that there was no knowledge in\nthe first place, only a belief that was considered true and warranted.\nThe same logic holds for Gaṅgeśa’s\n‘pratyakṣa’: if what was considered a\nperceptual awareness is discovered to be in fact non-veridical, then\nit is said that there was no perception in the first place, only an\nawareness that was considered veridical and produced by an organ of\nsense. \nThus there may be here only a verbal unity achieved cheaply, but it is\nimportant to know that Gaṅgeśa works with this\nunderstanding of the term. Perhaps this is why he spends section after\nsection in his “perception” chapter examining particular\nproblems with objects known such as air, the sound of one’s own\nson’s voice in a “tumultuous racket,” universals and\nthe types of sensory relation occurrent in knowledge thereof, apparent\nsimultaneous perception, and perception of perception itself. His\nchapter is full of phenomenological insights, but the science he\nrelies on to understand the operations of the several sense organs is\nobviously antiquated. Epistemologically, however, the goal is to\nseparate the pseudo-source that generates non-knowledge (awareness\nthat appears to to be true but is not or is not produced in the\nassumed way) from the genuine, and the science is often not relevant\nconsidering the signs of knowledge and non-knowledge. The longest\nsection of the chapter is devoted to a general account of illusion as\n“appearance of something as other than as it is,”\nanyathā-khyāti-vāda. \nIn illusion, Gaṅgeśa says, the presentation of\nF-hood—silverhood, for example, in the illusion of\n“seeing” a piece of shell as silver, and saying,\n“Silver,” when it’s really\nmother-of-pearl—originates in things’ really being F,\nthrough previous knowledge of F-hood, real bits of silver in the\nworld. The silverhood predication in the verbalization of the\nperception-like experience is available to become illusory predication\ncontent through previous experience of silver. It gets fused into a\ncurrent perception-like event by means of a foul-up in the normal\ncausal process through the arousing of a silverhood memory-disposition\n(saṃskāra) formed by previous experience of\nsilver, or, possibly, by testimony. The content or intentionality of\nan illusion is to be explained causally as generated by real features\nof real things just as is genuine perception although they are\ndistinct cognitive types. To repeat, genuine perception is factive;\nillusion is a perception-imitator (“You don’t really see\nMaitra because that’s Chaitra”). \nPerception gets content not only from the object in connection with\nthe sense organ but also from the classificational power of the mind\nor self. With the perceptual awareness, “That’s a\npot,” for instance, the pot as an individual in connection with\na sensory faculty is responsible for the cognition of a\nproperty-bearer, for what is called the qualificandum portion of the\nperception, without admixture of memory, but the sensory connection is\nnot by itself responsible for the qualifier portion, the pothood, also\nidentified as the “predication content”\n(prakāra, the verbalizable “way” something\nappears), the thing’s classification as a pot. The\nclassificational power of the mind should not, however, be understood\nas innate so much as the product of experience over the course of a\nlifetime. Repeatable features of reality get impressed on the mind or\nself in the form of memory dispositions. That is, in perceiving\na as an F, normally an F-saṃskāra formed\nby previous knowledge-source-produced bits of awareness of things F\nwould be a causal factor. The perception’s own content includes\nthe repeatable nature of the qualifier through the operation of this\nfactor. We see the tree as a tree, and it is a tree in fact. \nThe idea of indeterminate perception is a latecomer in Nyāya\ntradition. Gautama, Vātsyānana, and Uddyotakara, whose\nwritings form the core of the early school, do not recognize an\nindeterminate type of perception. The tenth-century author\nVācaspati introduces the notion into the system (1996: 111).\nGaṅgeśa is clearly aware of this history, for he opens his\ndiscussion by echoing Vācaspati's commentary on\nNyāya-sūtra 1.1.4 where, in considering the\nNyāya-sūtra’s definition of perception,\nVācaspati takes the two words\n‘avyapadeśya’ (“non-verbal”) and\n‘vyavasāyâtmaka’\n(“definite”) as indicating two types of perception,\nindeterminate and determinate. Udayana and Gaṅgeśa follow\nhim, but there seems to have been some dissension among later\nNaiyāyikas (Sibajiban Bhattacharyya 1990: 172–6). \nDeterminate perception, i.e., perceptual knowledge, is concept-laden,\na cognizing of a qualificandum through a qualifier. Things\nhave multiple properties some of which normally go undetected on any\ngiven occasion of experience. One can see Devadatta without seeing his\nback. Wholes are implicit in their parts, the very notion of which\nmakes no sense cut off from that of the whole: parts are parts of a\nwhole. If the ontological layering of things having qualifiers were\nnot reflected in a causal ordering of an indeterminate perception\nfeeding, so to say, the determinate, then perception of a\nqualificandum should entail that the “thick” particular be\npresented, i.e., the thing with all its properties, and, as\nGaṅgeśa argues, a blind person in touching a yellow piece\nof cloth would know its color as yellow (2020: 359–60). The idea\nof indeterminate perception picking up just one or another feature of\nthings is thus tied to Nyāya realism. The idea historically,\nhowever, was taken over from Buddhists, it seems (Perrett: 2016). \nIn a thought experiment, Gaṅgeśa imagines a child\nencountering a cow for the very first time (2020: 560). He argues that\nthe child can grasp the concept of cowhood and, had she the right\nwords, could say, correctly, “That’s a cow,” even\nthough she has had no previous experience of cows. The cowhood\npredication content is supplied by what is called\n“indeterminate” cognition of the qualifier, a first stage,\nso to say, of the sensory information flow. According to\nGaṅgeśa, such indeterminate cognition has to be positied to\nunderstand how we have, on the whole, workable concepts of things. The\nargument is that in a typical case of a first-time perceptual\nawareness of, for instance, a cow, there is a prior stage in the\ncausal process that is an indeterminate cognition, indeterminate in\nthat cowness is cognized but not as related to the particular cow, the\nqualificandum of the ensuing determinate perception. All other cases\nof cognition of an entity as qualified have a prior cognition of the\nqualifier as a causal factor. It is thus reasonable that the case of a\nfirst-time perception does as well. But since here clearly we do not\nhave a mental disposition (saṃskāra) at work,\nindeterminate cognition has to be posited. \nSomething like indeterminate perception is posited by moderate\nfoundationalists in analytic epistemology as helping to solve the\nproblem of a justification regress, it seems (Phillips 2012: 50). A\nmental state not embedding an assertion and so immune to questions\nwhether it is true or false is proposed. BonJour (2003: 20): “\n… such a state is, as it were, semi-assertive or\nsemi-judgmental in character: it has a kind of content or cognitive\nsignificance, but not in a way that would raise a further issue of\njustification.” Such a comparison could be misleading, however.\nPerception, according to Gaṅgeśa, is a doxastic justifier.\nThe foundations of our worldly beliefs are doxastic in that\ndeterminate perceptions embed propositions that say at a minimum that\nsomething is some way or another. Concept-free perception may be\nthought of as Nyāya’s way of rendering our ability to form\nconcepts merely from perception’s phenomenological side. It is a\ntheoretical posit made to explain how our concepts originate in\nreality—a problem that is epitomized in cases of a first-time\nperception of something as an F, the concept F-hood being previously\nunavailable to the perceiver. \n“Apperception,” anuvyavasāya, is defined as\na perception taking a preceding cognition or another psychological\nproperty as its object, typically a scoping cognition in relation to\nanother scoped (Phillips 2012: 48–50). Efforts and desires can\nbe similarly targeted. Through apperception, Gaṅgeśa\nclaims, one knows infallibly the intentionality, the\n“objecthood,” viṣayatā, of the\ncognition scoped, in its qualificandum, qualifier, and relational\nportions. One knows, in other words, what the scoped purports to be\nabout, and one knows this independently of a determination of the\ntarget’s being knowledge or not. Gaṅgeśa argues that\nsince the sensory connection in this case is not mediated by a\nmaterial organ, apperception is infallible about the contents of the\nscoped, but not of course about its truth. He devotes a long section\nof his perception chapter to defending this and other views about\napperception in the face of opponents claiming he is giving up central\nplanks of his theory. \nApperception makes certification possible because it sets up the item\nto be certified, showing the type of cognition the scoped is. Our\napperceptive ability to determine whether the scoped cognition is\nputatively perceptual, inferential, analogical, testimonial, or of\nanother character has epistemic relevance, since, as with all\nperception, there would be a presumption in favor of its correctness.\nThus there would also be restoration of a presumption of the truth for\na scoped cognition that had been brought into doubt were it judged to\nbe perceptual, inferential, analogical, or testimonial in character,\nalthough further examination might prove the identification wong. Note\nthat if further examination were called for, its direction would be\ndetermined by the apperception of cognitive type. For, the criteria of\ngenuine perception, inference, and the rest vary according to origin.\nThe characteristic epistemic merits and flaws (guṇa and\ndoṣa) are very different for each knowledge source and\nthere are also significant differences within species of perception in\nparticular. Thus apperceptive judgment of putative type directs\ninquiry, telling us what to check. \nCorollary to Gaṅgeśa’s thesis of the apperceptibility\nof cognitive types is his view that illusion can be scoped such that\nthere too we find, abstractly, a cognition of an object as qualified\nby a qualifier, for example, of a piece of tin appearing to be silver.\nHe also presents the argument that the fact that we can later see the\nsame thing as really the tin it is shows that the illusion is a single\ncognition and not, contra the Prābhākara, two cognitions, a\nperception and a remembering along with a failure to notice their\ndifference. But scoping an illusory awareness is supposed to show\nthis, too, and in a particularly dramatic way when one knows that the\ncognition is illusory while it continues, such as apparent sight of a\ndouble moon or a person with hepatitis seeing a wall she knows is\nwhite as yellow. Although apperception is said not in itself to be\nable to determine the veridicality of an awareness, in such a case the\nsubject practically sees one thing (the wall) appearing to be\nsomething it is not (yellow), anyathā-khyāti. \nGaṅgeśa’s contributions to understanding the\nknowledge source called “inference,”\nanumāna, and “inferential knolwedge,”\nanumiti, come on top of a long history of advances both\nwithin Nyāya and outside, from Yogācāra Buddhist\nlogicians and epistemologists, in particular, but also others.\nGaṅgeśa was a great student of philosophy. Most of the\ntechnical system can be found in his near predecessor,\nMaṇikaṇṭha Miśra (1953), and discussions of\nfallacies echo the seventh-century Buddhist Dharmakīrti (1993)\nand others. However, his treatment of inference is, arguably, more\nelaborate than that of any predecessor, and, as is his ususal\npractice, he examines a host of similar definitions of key items, such\nas “pervasion,” as well as many opponent positions before\ndefending one or more of his own. \nConsidering the development of logic in the West, it important to keep\nin mind that inference throughout Nyāya is part of epistemology.\nSomething about the world is known by any veritable inference. An\ninference must have premises that are themselves known. Nyāya\nphilosophers do not distinguish between a formally valid deductive\nargument (which may or may not have false premises) and deductive\narguments that are “cogent” (with no unjustified premises\nand no errors). \nA set of logical terms is standard across Nyāya and most of the\nother classical schools, and Gaṅgeśa both uses them and\nprovides his own precise definitions: \nFor example, he characterizes an inferential subject,\npakṣa (2020: 734): \nAn inferential subject (pakṣa) occurs where there is no\nknowledge source that has positively established something in\ncoördination with an absence of a desire to know. Thus, that is\nnot an inferential subject if there is a knowledge source that has\nalready positively established whatever and no desire to know\n(it by inference). … This is what it is to be an inferential\nsubject (as a factor in the generation of inferential knowledge).\nAdmittedly, this definition does not differentiate it from anything,\nsince to be an inferential subject is a property with universal scope\n(anything can be an inferential subject, qualities as well as\nsubstances, universals as well as particulars, and so on).\nNevertheless, the way the word ‛pakṣa’ is\nused has been explained. \nA stock example of an inference: \nGaṅgeśa devotes several long sections of the chapter to\nissues surrounding the inductive support that inferential knowledge\npresumes, a basis for the proper formation of the inference-informing\nsaṃskāra or “mental disposition”\nresponsible for a subject’s being able to remember (in a crucial\nmental event called “reflection,”\nparāmarśa) a vyāpti or inclusion of\nall things \\(H\\) as also things \\(S\\). This is the\n“example.” \nInference-grounding “pervasions,” vyāpti,\nare of different sorts, but they all obtain in nature, such as that\nbetween smokiness and fieriness. Gaṅgeśa and all\nNaiyāyikas are much occupied with pervasions, their nature and\nhow they are known. \nAfter rejecting twenty-four attempts—close attempts—to\ndefine the natural relation of pervasion such that the presence of a\npervaded property at a location proves that another, the pervader, is\nthere, too, Gaṅgeśa endorses the following characterization\n(2020: 623): \nPervasion, vyāpti, is a prover \\(H\\)’s having its\nlocations shared by a probandum \\(S\\) so long as \\(S\\) when specified\nas the counterpositive of an absolute absence (i.e., as \\(\\neg S\\))\nhas shared locations, shared with the absence of the prover (i.e.,\nwith \\(\\neg H\\): no \\(\\neg S\\) occurs on anything that is not also a\n\\(\\neg H\\)), and if shared with something that is the counterpositive\nof such an absence (\\(H\\)) also does not share it there (in the case\nof a non-locus-pervading property). \nAll \\(H\\) are \\(S\\) so long as there are no \\(\\neg S\\) that share a\nlocation with something that is not a \\(\\neg H\\). That is, there will\nbe pervasion given co-locatedness so long as what the \\(S\\) is,\naccording to the definition, is not something that in serving as the\ncounterpositive of an absence—specifically a counterpositive\nhaving shared locations, a universal, a class character, a repeatable\nproperty and not a particular instance (firehood as opposed to, say,\nkitchen fire)—does not share any location that does not also\nhouse a \\(\\neg H\\). Goekoop (1967: 111) has a nice paraphrase that\nmakes the point a little clearer: “There is a pervasion of \\(H\\)\nby \\(S\\) if and only if \\(H\\) has a common locus with \\(S\\) in such a\nway that \\(S\\) is none of the things that qua class are completely\nabsent from some locus of \\(H\\).” \nGaṅgeśa’s definition is supposed to solve a problem\nconcerning inferences about non-locus-pervading properties, such as a\nmonkey-conjunction in a tree, a case on which many of the rejected\ndefinitions floundered. “This tree possesses a\nmonkey-conjunction, since it is this tree (which always has\nmonkeys)” is a good inference even though the tree at its roots\nhas the ruled-out sort of counterpositive according to the definition.\nInferences involving conjunctions are ruled in if the \\(S\\) is a\nproperty that while not present at \\(l\\) along with the \\(H\\) in some\nspecified portion of \\(l\\) is not so overall, that is, at or in all\nportions of \\(l\\). The location \\(l\\) would be something that is\nindeed \\(S\\) in some portion, as a tree does have a monkey in its\nbranches though not at its roots. \nInferences put forth for others (parârtha) make plain\nthe conditions that work with oneself (svârtha)\nautomatically, and in texts of philosophy little is automatic. Thus\nbuilt into the conception of the operation of inference are the\ninductive procedures whereby a pervasion is known. Putatively similar\ninstances, sapakṣa, are defined as cases known to\npossess the probandum and thus should also, at least in one (as first\ninsisted by the Buddhist Dignāga), exhibit the prover (e.g.,\n\\(Hb\\) and \\(Sb\\))—while putatively dissimilar instances,\nvipakṣa, are defined as cases known not to possess the\nprobandum and thus should lack the prover, too (e.g., \\(\\neg Sc\\) and\n\\(\\neg Hc\\)). The example, dṛṣṭānta,\nis normally a single instance of sapakṣa where the\nprover also occurs (\\(Hb\\) and \\(Sb\\)), its citing thus indicating\nthat there is inductive support. In other words, by reference to cases\nthat are sapakṣa —i.e., known instances of the\nprobandum—where the prover is also found, positive evidence is\nmarshalled to support an inference-underpinning pervasion\n(anvaya, “positive correlation”). And by\nreference to cases that are vipakṣa —i.e., known\ninstances of the absence of the probandum—further support is\ngarnered by our not finding the prover (vyatireka,\n“negative correlation”). Citing an example is shorthand to\nindicate that such a procedure supports assertion of a\nvyāpti, “pervasion” or general rule.\nGaṅgeśa devotes several sections of the\nJewel’s inference chapter to elucidating inferences\nbased on both sapakṣa and vipakṣa, as\nwell as those based exclusively on sapakṣa\n(“positive-only inference”) and exclusively on\nvipakṣa (“negative-only inference”). In\ngeneral, it is “wide experience,”\nbhūyo-darśana, that is responsible for\npervasion-knowledge. But this term, championed by Udayana, and others,\nis vague, and Gaṅgeśa devotes several sections to inductive\nmethod. \nThere is also “hypothetical reasoning,” tarka,\nwhich, although not itself a knowledge source, is said to be able to\nshift the balance of what it is rational to accept. Its main role is\nto help people grasp pervasions, and is an important supplement to the\ninferences that are central to philosophic controversies.\nGaṅgeśa explains tarka as a hypothetical argument\nrevealing a fallacy or defeater with respect to a position\n∼p opposed to another position p that is to be\naccepted so long as p has independent evidence in its favor,\ntechnically called, pratikūla-tarka. There is, however,\nalso anukūla-tarka, “supportive reasoning,”\nsuch as economy of conception, that is positive in character. The\ntypes of tarka that Gaṅgeśa recognizes are: (1)\nātmâśraya, “self-dependence”\n(begging the question), (2) anyonyâśraya,\n“mutual dependence” (mutual presupposition), (3)\ncakraka, “circularity” (reasoning in a circle),\n(4) anavasthā “infinite regress,” (5)\naniṣṭa-prasaṅga, “unwanted\nconsequence” (contradiction), (6)\nprathama-upasthitatva, “being presupposed by the\nother,” the “first established” (a form of\nanukūla, “favorable,” tarka), (7)\nutsarga, “hasty generalization,” (8)\nvinigamanā-viraha, “differentiation\nfailure,” (9) lāghava, “economy of\nconception,” “theoretic lightness” (another form of\nfavorable tarka), and (10) gaurava, “lack of\neconomy of conception,” “theoretic heaviness”\n(Bagchi 1951: 151). \nGaṅgeśa devotes a section of his inference chapter to\ntarka where he shows “pragmatic contradiction”\nalso to be included, which was mentioned above in connection with his\nrejection of skepticism and defense of knowledge as the default for\nawareness. That passage begins (2020: 649): \nAs an example, consider the particular doubt about smoke as pervaded\nby fire. If smoke is not produced from a set of causes excluding fire,\nthen smoke, as not produced from a causal complex including fire,\nwould not be produced (a conclusion in contradiction, presumably, with\nthe doubter’s belief that smoke is produced). Now doubt (against\nthis hypothetical reasoning): Could the smoke come to be from\nsomething that is not fire? Or just in some instances could it come to\nbe without fire? Or could it come to be simply by chance\n(ahetuka, “without a cause”)? \nWere a subject \\(M\\) who has ascertained thoroughgoing positive\ncorrelations (\\(S\\) where \\(H\\)) and negative correlations (where no\n\\(S\\), no \\(H\\)), to doubt that an effect might arise without a cause,\nthen—to take up the example of smoke and fire—why should\n\\(M\\), as \\(M\\) does in a rulewise manner, resort to fire for smoke,\nto food to allay hunger, and to speech to communicate to another\nperson? \nGaṅgeśa argues that tarka is useful for—as\nwe might say these days—reëstablishing a presumption of\ntruth in favor of one or another thesis brought into doubt. For\nexample, by supposing the truth of an opponent’s thesis and\nshowing how it leads to unacceptable consequences, one repossesses a\npresumption of truth, provided one’s own thesis is supported by\nat least the appearance of a knowledge source and, further, that it\nhas not itself been ruled out. Thus tarka comprises arguments\nthat are not in themselves knowledge-generators but capable\nnonetheless of showing what we should and should not believe. In\nparticular, reasoning can show “untoward ramifications”\n(prasaṅga) of not accepting a conclusion that is\nevidenced, Gaṅgeśa says. Forms of tarka such as\nself-contradiction, infinite regress, and circular reasoning are\nemployed in the dialogic exchanges constructed in the Jewel\nand other works of later and indeed early Nyāya philosophy and,\nfor that matter, all the philosophic schools. \nInferential awareness, like the other types, is defeasible, and while\nwe have every right to accept, and act on, undefeated inferences, we\nare sometimes wrong. In particular, knowledge and justification do not\npass from premises to conclusion if we become aware of an\nupādhi, an “additional condition,” which\nwould be a blocker of “reflection” through undermining the\ngeneralization on which such reflection depends. Thus awareness of an\nupādhi is a preventer of inferential knowledge, a\n“defeater,” leading to belief relinquishment by someone\nwho has hitherto not noticed the condition and who has erroneously\narrived at a conclusion on the basis of a falsely induced,\npseudo-pervasion. A rough (and non-classical) example: I know that Al\nhas a temper that will flare up in certain circumstances from having\nwitnessed many tantrums such that I expect that Al will explode by\nmaking an inference when I see that the circumstances obtain, but\nhaving overlooked that it is only with Belle that Al is so irascible\nand Belle not being present in the circumstances where I expect, by\npseudo-inference, Al’s temper to flare, Belle would be the\nupādhi, the “additional condition.”\nDiscussion of the concept occupies more than a tenth of\nGaṅgeśa’s long inference chapter. \nThe upādhi (\\(U\\)) has a negative character, serving, at\nleast in the first place, to undermine a putative inferential\nconclusion by showing that the pervasion—all \\(H\\) as \\(S\\), a\nprover (\\(H\\)) as pervaded by a probandum (\\(S\\))—on which it\ndepends does not hold. But an upādhi may also serve as\npositive restorer of knowledge in that when it occurs together\nwith an original prover (\\(H\\)) that it undercuts (thus \\(H \\\n\\&\\ U\\)), the inferential conclusion is reestablished. \nAccording to a traditional definition which, although refined by\nGaṅgeśa, suits most purposes, an upādhi is a\nproperty \\(U\\) such that \nIt follows then that there is “deviation” (the prover is\nsaid to “deviate,” being somewhere the probandum is not)\nand no relation of pervasion. \nThere are lots of other fallacies that Gaṅgeśa discusses.\nThe Nyāya-sūtra lists five\n“pseudo-provers,” hetv-ābhāsa, which\nGaṅgeśa examines at length: \nThese “flaws of the prover,” hetu-doṣa, are\nalso called “constant flaws,” nitya-doṣa,\nas opposed to puruṣa-doṣa, “flaws of a\nperson,” which are anitya-doṣa, “occasional\nflaws.” Admittedly, Gaṅgeśa contends that sometimes\neven “failure to grasp a pervasion is (not a logical flaw but) a\nflaw belonging to a person or subject” (2020: 884).\nNevertheless, the five pseudo-provers are separated out from other\ndefeaters called clinchers from the Nyāya-sūtra on,\nbecause they highlight logical—or in the case of (3)\nepistemological—rules as opposed to personal failures such as\nfailing to pay attention. The upādhi fallacy, too,\nentails a counterexample and so is a “constant flaw,”\nalthough failure to notice one on occasion can be a personal\nerror. \nTwo further types of defeater or pseudo-defeater identified in the\nNyāya-sūtra are, first, jāti,\n“false analogies,” which seem dismissed by\nGaṅgeśa (in the voice of an opponent) saying that they are\nnot good responses in a debate or controversy (2020: 949), in contrast\nwith, second, “clinchers,” nigraha-sthāna,\nwhose importance in debate is acknowledged but not in any detail taken\nup (perhaps Gaṅgeśa sees the\nNyāya-sūtra’s list, as explained by\nVātsyāyana, as satisfactory). But jāti are\ndismissed because, it seems, however they may have been conceived in\nearly years (Prets 2001), long before Gaṅgeśa they come to\nbe understood as misleading analogies and classified as\ntricks of debate or philosophic conundra, not really worthy\nof inquiry. A jāti is a pseudo-defeater in the broad\nsense of a misleading analogy, and there is less agreement about them\nacross school than about pseudo-provers, clinchers, and, we must add,\ntypes of tarka, “hypothetical reasoning,” which\nwere reviewed above. \nGańgeśa advances three contentious inferences in his\ninference chapter, two of them—a theistic inference and one\nabout the possibility of “liberation,”\nmukti—defended at considerable length (all three are\nreconstructed and examined in Phillips 2012: 65–71). As much as\nsupporting longstanding positions of Nyāya on (a)\n“self,” ātman, (b) “Lord,”\nīśvara, and (c) mukti, his treatments\nillustrate his inferential system including defeating and hypothetical\nreasoning. Indeed, illustration of the system sometimes seems to be\nthe main goal. \nAlthough Gaṅgeśa accepts the position of early\nNaiyāyika Uddyotakara (c. 600) that one knows oneself\nperceptually as expressed by the word ‘I’ in perceptual\njudgments such as “I am seeing a pot” (Taber 2012),\npresumably he sees proving a self by inference as useful because\nBuddhists, for one, deny it (famously). And at least in\nYogācāra Buddhism perception is accepted as a knowledge\nsource, with the insistence that no self is known by it or indeed by\nany other means. \nThe Nyāya-sūtra has two arguments: diachronic\nsynthesis and synchronic. The former is illustrated by the\nrecognition, “This is that Devadatta I saw yesterday,”\nwhich could not be an expression of knowledge (and of course it is) if\nthe self of the recognizer had not endured (the recognition is fed by\na memory of Devadata as seen the day before, and one person does not\nhave another’s memories). The latter is illustrated by, “I\nam touching what I see” (a self is needed to bring together the\ninformation across sensory modality). In the Jewel’s\nperception chapter, Gaṅgeśa at times refers to or echoes\nthese arguments, but the argument for a self in the inference chapter\nis different. \nGaṅgeśa follows Vātsyāyana under\nNyāya-sūtra 1.1.5 (the “inference\nsūtra”): “Every living body (the inferential subject)\nhas a self (the probandum), since every living body has\nbreath (the prover), unlike a pot (the example, a pot being\nqualified by both absence-of-self and absence-of-breath).” My\nsense is that here the main point is as much to illustrate\n“negative-only” inference as to endorse\nVātsyāyana’s reasoning, but it is endorsed. The\ninferential subject includes all living bodies, and so there is no\nsapakṣa, no examples of the probandum known outside the\nset of things that are living bodies. Thus the inference has to be\nnegative-only, based solely on correlations of absences,\n“unlike a pot,” a pot having neither breath nor self.\nFundamental truths of things (tattva), which are captured by\nphilosophical definitions, seem accessible only through fundamental\ndistinctions being known through negative-only inferences, for\nexample, this inference to self (ātman) as a fundamental\ncategory of substance. \nIn a slightly more more elaborate version, Gaṅgeśa puts\nforth two steps. First, desires and the like are proved to have a\nlocus, like all qualities. In step two, self is proved to be that\nlocus, a distinct substance, different from earth, water,\ntejas, and so on down the traditional list, by eliminative\nargument. Defeaters for the proposition that desire and the like\nbelong to earth or any of the rest of the items on the ontological\nlist consists of hypothetical reasoning such as the following. If\ndesire were a property of earth (or water and so on), then like the\ncolor that exists in earthen things, it, too, would be perceived.\nSurveying pots and the like, we find that nothing material has desire,\ncognition, etc., outside of living bodies. He writes (2020: 803): \nGiven that desire has been proved to have an inherent cause (by the\ninference previously stated, “Desire has origins in an inherent\ncause, since it is an effect,” we formulate a second\ninference), being-a-desire occurs in that (namely, desire) which has\nas emergent cause a connection, since being-a-desire is a\nuniversal directly pervaded by the\nqualityhood-that-occurs-in-specific-qualities-grasped-by-an-eternal-organ\n(i.e., manas or the organ of hearing), like\nbeing-a-sound (soundhood, the universal of sound). And this emergent\ncause, which is a connection, is specified by something, since it is a\nconnection. (That “something” is the living body.) If\nmerely connection with a self were the origins of desire (without\nrequiring something else delimiting it), then ramifications would\noverextend. Therefore, having-a-self, which is the specifier of the\nconnection that gives rise to desire, is proved with respect to the\nliving body. (That is, every living body is\n“enselved.”) \nThe inference for positing an īśvara, the\n“Lord,” is a little less system-bound than this one for an\nātman, but its history stretches through several earlier\nNyāya efforts, in particular by Vācaspati (c. 950). It is an\ninference to a creator based on both positive and negative\ncorrelations: “Earth and the like have a conscious agent as an\ninstrumental cause, since they are effects, like a pot and\nunlike an atom (whatever is an effect has a conscious agent as an\ninstrumental cause).” Buddhists point to counterexamples, such\nas growing grass. Growing grass has the prover property,\nbeing-an-effect, but not the probandum,\nhaving-an-agent-as-an-instrumental cause. The Nyāya reply is to\npoint out that growing grass and all such examples are in dispute,\nthat is to say, fall within the domain of the inferential subject\n(pakṣa), here “earth and the like,” to wit,\nanything that is an effect but whose agential cause is not apparent,\nunlike the comparison class, a pot, for instance, which is clearly\nboth an effect and has an agent as an instrumental cause. Nothing that\nfalls within the domain of the subject can be used either as an\nexample supporting the rule of vyāpti inclusion or as a\ncounterexample, since that would beg the question. The whole point of\ninference is to make something known that was not known previously,\nand here, as with the existence of atoms, the conclusion could not be\nknown perceptually. The theological inference has the purpose of\nshowing that things like the earth and growing grass have an\nagent within the causal complex that brings them about. This is not\nsomething that we know without making the inference. \nSo, by the rules governing proper inference, the putative\ncounterexample is rejected, and the proof looks pretty good. For,\ncleverly it divides all things into three categories, as\nVācaspati remarks (1996: 563). There are uncreated things, atoms,\nfor instance, created things that clearly have an agential cause, such\nas pots, and things such as the earth and growing grass that do not\nclearly have an agential cause. This last set becoming the inferential\nsubject is bracketed such that no examples can be pulled from it. \nHowever, another refutation refined by Buddhist philosophers over the\ncenturies is not dismissed so easily (Mokṣākāragupta\n1998: 98; Patil 2009). The Nyāya argument falls to an\nupādhi, in this case the property,\nhaving-a-perceptible-body. As we have seen, an upādhi is\ndefined as a property that pervades the probandum while failing to\npervade the prover, that is to say, that is entailed by the presence\nof the probandum while not being instanced in at least one case of the\nprover. Having-an-agent-as-an-instrumental-cause, which is the \\(S\\)\nor probandum property of the target inference, is pervaded by the\nagent’s-having-a-perceptible-body, which is the \\(U\\) or\nupādhi property: all agents have bodies. But there is\nsomething that is an \\(H\\) but not a \\(U\\); something that is an\neffect but does not have within its causal complex an agent with a\nperceptible body, e.g., growing grass. The two conditions being met,\nit would follow that there is something that is an \\(H\\) but not an\n\\(S\\), something that is an effect but does not have an agent as an\ninstrumental cause. Thus the upādhi defeats the apparent\ninference by showing that the required pervasion and entailment do not\nhold. \nGaṅgeśa’s response is to deny that the putative\nupādhi, an-agent’s-having-a-perceptible-body,\npervades the probandum of the target inference,\nhaving-an-agent-as-an-instrumental-cause, and several rounds of\nobjection and response centering on Nyāya’s conception of\nthe Lord as an agent without a body are aired. The Lord’s\ncreative activity requires, like that of any agent, familiarity with\nthe material to be shaped, like the potter’s knowledge of clay\nand of what to do to make a pot. The Lord’s knowledge is to be\nconceived as appropriate to the tasks to be undertaken, such as\noriginally combining atoms, and if the Lord, like us, had to have a\nbody to have knowledge, including the knowledge required to combine\natoms, then, since bodies are combinations of atoms, there would have\nto be some earlier Creator to make the necessary\ncombinations—ad infinitum. Simpler than this conception\nis that of a bodiless Creator whose knowledge is appropriate to the\nmaterial forming earth and the like but, unlike our knowledge, is not\ngenerated. This seems to be the core of Gaṅgeśa’s\nreasoning, which is complex tarka targeting simplicity and\nfollowing Vācaspati in particular. \nAn inference to the possibility of “liberation,”\nmukti, brings the Jewel’s inference chapter to\na close. It is particularly dense (2020: 1142) and cannot be unpacked\nin a short space, but its central analogy is noteworthy. \nThen the justification (the inference to the conclusion that suffering\ncan come to an end for an individual), well, it is that suffering in\ngeneral, or the suffering in general of Devadatta (i.e., of any\nindividual), is the counterpositive of a non-simultaneous destruction\nexisting in the same locus, since it is a property that\noccurs only as an effect, or since it is continuous until its\nend, like the light of a lamp. This continuity is its being a\nproperty that occurs only as an effect at distinct times. And in this\nway the probandum, the property to be proved (viz., being the\ncounterpositive of a non-simultaneous destruction existing in the same\nlocus), is also applicable to pleasure in general and the like:\nliberation is the breaking up of the causal chain along with its\nsource. \nTranslator’s comments (2020: 1142) bring out that the crucial\npoint seems to be that something destroyed has no causal power,\nexisting only as an effect, in connection with the destruction for\nwhich it is the counterpositive. The destruction that is\nmukti is not of current but of future suffering, thus a\n“non-simultaneous” destruction. The destruction exists in\nthe same locus as the suffering that would occur were it not blocked.\nThe suffering does not really occur—it never comes\nabout—and so its ontological status is problematic. Clearly, it\ndoes not cause anything. It comes about only as an effect in\nconnection with the bringing about of the destruction in relation to\nwhich it is the counterpositive. And any destruction is of something\n(the counterpositive) at a place or locus: \\(cDl\\). Note that the\nexample appears to work only with the second of the two provers\nmentioned: like a lamp’s stream of light that can cease\nabsolutely, the suffering of an individual goes on continuously\n(through life, death, and rebirth)—in the sense of regularly if\nnot without occasional spells of pleasure—until its absolute\nend. Pleasure is similar. \nDifferent schools of classical philosophy have very different\nunderstandings of “analogy,” upamāna, and,\nunlike with perception, inference, and testimony, cross-school\ncontroversies seem often at cross-purposes. For example,\nMīmāṃsakas, worried about the criteria for substitutes\nfor materials enjoined to carry out rituals, talk about similarities\nas objective, whereas Naiyāyikas are concerned principally with\nword meanings, although Vātsyāyana (1997: 170–1) does\nshow the usefulness of analogy to indicate something new, a medicinal\nplant, for instance, similar to one with which an interlocutor is\nfamiliar. Gaṅgeśa sees the working of analogy to result\nsolely in learning the meaning of words. Nevertheless, appreciation of\nsimilarity, which he sees as a supervenient property, is, he says,\ncrucial in the operation of the knowledge source. The\nJewel’s chapter on analogy is quite short and lacks\nsubsections, hardly a “chapter” in comparison with the\nother three. \nWhat comes to be a stock example of analogical knowledge according to\nNyāya is elaborated in Nyāya-sūtra\ncommentaries and textbooks preceding Gaṅgeśa, who fills in\ndetails. A subject \\(S\\) inquires of a forester about a\ngavaya, which is a kind of buffalo, having heard the word\n‘gavaya’ used among her schoolmates but not\nknowing what it means, i.e., not knowing to what\n‘gavaya’ refers. Questioned by \\(S\\), the\nforester replies that a gavaya is like a cow, mentioning\ncertain specifics as also some dissimilarities. To simplify,\nNyāya philosophers say that the forester makes an analogical\nstatement (“A gavaya is like a cow”), whereby,\naccording to Gaṅgeśa, our subject \\(S\\) now knows in\ngeneral what the word means. But \\(S\\) does not yet know its\nreference, which he deems its principal meaning. Later encountering a\ngavaya buffalo, \\(S\\) says, “This, which is similar to\na cow, is the meaning of the word\n‘gavaya’,” a statement which expresses\n\\(S\\)’s new knowledge. Every instance of knowledge has a source,\nand this one has been generated by upamāna,\n“analogy.” Gaṅgeśa writes (2020: 1207): \nObjection:\n\nThe question [of the subject to the forester] concerns only the cause\nof her (eventual) knowledge (qua qualificandum). The answer gives its\nqualifiers. \nGaṅgeśa: No. Since she does not know the particulars\n(that would ground use of the word), she would be answered by the\nforester also with reference to a need for a sensory\nencounter: “If you go into the forest, you will see.” \nTherefore, \\(S\\)’s questions would concern only the distinct\ngrounds of employment: “What is a gavaya like? On what\ngrounds does one employ the word ‘gavaya’?”\nSince the one asked (viz., the forester) would not be able to show\nimmediately, directly (sākṣāt), what it is to\nbe a gavaya buffalo, he would talk about similarity,\nindirectly indicating it (i.e., indicating what it is to be a\ngavaya buffalo). And then later, when an individual has been\nseen by \\(S\\) who remembers the meaning of the analogical statement,\nshe acquires the knowledge: “This thing qualified by what it is\nto be a gavaya is the referent of the word\n‘gavaya’.” \\(S\\)’s knowledge is of a\nparticular that is the grounds for the employment of the word. It is\nthe result of analogy (as a knowledge source). \nGaṅgeśa begins his final chapter of the Jewel with\na defense of the integrity of testimony as a knowledge source,\nfollowing a long tradition beginning with an extended\nNyāya-sūtra passage (2.1.49–56) that elicited\nmuch commentary. Like his predecessors, he resists an opponent’s\ncontention that “testimonial” knowledge results from\ninference of a certain sort such that supposing an additional\nknowledge source is unnecessary. Gaṅgeśa’s response\nis to argue that testimony works uniquely through language, that\nwithout testimony the inferentialist’s premises in the\nsubstitute inference could not be understood. Furthermore, the\ncertification conditions for testimony are different. The chapter\nincludes much reflection on linguistic meaning, including sections on\ngrammar near the end. How to understand reference is a chief concern,\nreference being viewed as the primary mode of meaning. But there is\nalso “indirect indication,”\nlakṣaṇā, which works by way of a referent\nindicating something else, as when a poet says, “The\nmoon,” meaning the face of the beloved. All these are standard\ntopics in Nyāya literature. Injunctions, which are also talked\nabout from the earliest by Naiyāyikas as well as their\nMīmāṃsaka champions (the Veda is injunctive in\ncharacter), command a lot of attention. Their supposed ethical force\nis wrestled with, as Gaṅgeśa shows his mastery of\nMīmāṃsā and resists its view of a moral\nuniverse. \nNyāya and Mīmāṃsā are referentialist allies\nwith similar agendas when it comes to knowledge from testimony, both\nopposed to a Yogācāra pragmatic theory of meaning. Although\nconcerned mainly with Vedic hermeneutics, Mīmāṃsaka\nphilosophers pioneer many of the best arguments and counterarguments\nagainst Buddhists and others who attack Vedic authority. But\nGaṅgeśa does not accept the Mīmāṃsaka\ncontention that the overall purport of a statement or sentence can in\ngeneral, even in cases of secondary meaning,\nlakṣaṇā, be understood without an idea of\nthe speaker’s intention. We do not have to understand the\nspeaker’s intention to grasp a statement in all cases, although\nsometimes we do, for example, when multiple meanings are possible and\nwith some statements employing lakṣaṇā. But\nthe Mīmāṃsaka view that Vedic sentences have no author\nis false. \nGaṅgeśa apparently accepts the\nNyāya-sūtra’s definition, 1.1.7:\n“Testimony is the (true) statement of an trustworthy\nexpert” (Vātsyāyana 1997: 14), which indicates\ncertification conditions centering on the speaker. He focuses,\nhowever, on the conditions wrapped up in what it is to be a (true)\nstatement from the hearer’s point of view. The condition known\nas yogyatā, usually rendered “semantic fit,”\nis given by him a broad interpretation, where not only infelicitous\nstatements such as “The gardener is watering the plants with\nfire,” are violations, as is commonly pointed out, but also the\nhearer’s knowing that the speaker is not an āpta,\nthat the sounds are, for example, from a parrot. \nYogācāra Buddhists have a pragmatic theory of\nconcept-formation and view language as at best helping us get what we\nwant and avoid what we want to avoid. The Buddha’s words are to\nbe trusted because of his special experience and superior capacity as\na reasoner as well as his compassion motivating his most excellent\nadvice. Gaṅgeśa imagines an attack on testimonial knowledge\nfrom Buddhist skeptical quarters such that, in fact, there is no\nknowledge but only helpful or unhelpful advice because there is no\ntruth, no veridicality. Statements do not correspond to facts.\nGaṅgeśa’s rebuttal centers on knowledge production\nthrough words. Any instance of knowledge has a mode of production\ndistinct from one that fails so to produce. The argument that\nerroneous utterances fail to generate knowledge cuts no ice, since\nerroneous utterances are not veritable testimony as we Naiyāyikas\nunderstand it, he says (2020: 1215). We are able to distinguish\nerroneous and true utterances by the processes that produce them, and\nthus meet the skeptical challenge. \nA different line of rejection of testimony is attributed to the\nVaiśeṣika school, which is said to admit testimonial\nknowledge but to see its generation as coming from inference of a\ncertain sort. A hearer reasons: (1) Speaker \\(S\\) states p,\n(2) \\(S\\) is a “trustworthy authority,”\nāpta, (3) what such authorities state is true, and so,\ntherefore, (4) \\(p\\) is true. And if challenged, S could say that she\nknows \\(p\\) because of the inference. Gaṅgeśa’s\nrebuttal centers on how premise (1) could be known. Testimony has to\nbe admitted as a separate knowledge source to understand how the\nreductionist’s inference could get started. Just what is the\nknowledge source for (1)? \nIn the long chapter on testimony, one would expect speaker\ncertification conditions to be taken up, but they are not. Perhaps\nGaṅgeśa sees them as satisfactorily elucidated by\nVātsyāyana on Nyāya-sūtra 1.1.7 along\nwith the later commentaries. In any case, the Jewel’s\nfocus is on sentential conditions such as grammaticality and semantic\nfitness as remarked. Three conditions prominent in the grammatical\nliterature are addressed, “expectation,”\nākāṅkṣā, “semantic\nfit,” yogyatā, and “contiguity,”\nāsatti. Gaṅgeśa also takes up\ntātparya, “(speaker’s) intention,”\ndisputing the views of Mīmāṃsakas and championing\ncommon sense. Throughout the chapter, two views of sentence meaning\nare in view, (a) a “Bhāṭṭa” radically\nreferentialist theory (due to Kumārila) that a word refers\nindependently of sentential context, and (b) a\n“Prābhākara” holistic view that has the sentence\nas a whole as informational, not words independently of sentential\ncontext. Although Gaṅgeśa endorses the\nBhāṭṭa view that a factual relation, not directly\nexpressed, accounts for sentential unity, often he frames a point\nusing the Prābhākara theory. \nVātsyāyana and company discuss word meaning in terms of\npossible referents (Nyāya-sūtra 2.2.59–69),\n(i) the individual, for example, ‘cow’ used for a\nparticular cow, (ii) the universal, cowhood, what all cows have in\ncommon, and (iii) “shape,” ākṛti, as\nwith a cow-shaped pastry. The settled view is that all three are\ngenerally meant in a single usage, with predominance varying with\ncontext. Against this background, Vācaspati (1979) explores five\nviews of sentential meaning including both (a) the “theory of\nthe connection of the referents,” the radically, incrementally\nreferentialist view espoused by Bhāṭṭas and\nNaiyāyikas, abhihitânvaya-vāda, and (b) the\n“theory of reference of the connected,” “holistic\nreference,” the Prābhākara view of reference as\noccurring at the level of the sentence,\nanvītâbhidhāna-vāda. In his\nNyāya-sūtra work (1996), Vācaspati imports the\nBhāṭṭa view, according to which sentence meaning is\nderivative from the reference of individual words and other semantic\nelements taken together, with the overall connection, anvaya,\nprovided by the fact (if the statement is true) of the words’\nreferents being in relation, the “truth-maker.” Later\nNaiyāyikas such as Gaṅgeśa follow him, although, to\nrepeat, Gaṅgeśa often talks about sentential unity\npresupposing the Prābhākara view that the component words do\nnot individually have referential power but only as connected\ngrammatically, with a complex object or fact as that which is referred\nto by the unifying sentence. \n“Expectation,”\nākāṅkṣā, “(verbal)\nexpectation,” is the first of three sentential conditions taken\nup. After rejecting four attempts to define the phenomenon in its\nrelevance for the epistemology of testimony, Gaṅgeśa\nendorses the following (2020: 1259): \nExpectation amounts to incompleteness of reference, specifically, an\nincompleteness of \\(Y\\) with respect to \\(X\\); that is to say, without\n\\(Y\\) there would be, with respect to \\(X\\), no generation of\nawareness of an overall connection among the meanings of words and\nother factors taken in their native senses. Words (and other semantic\nunits) used as nouns, case endings, verbal roots, verbal endings,\nfinite verbs, and words in declension are such that, in a particular\ninstance, without the one or the other, there would not be awareness\ngenerated of an overall connection among all the referents mutually,\ntaking everything in its native sense. \nLists of words do not fulfill the “expectation” condition,\nfor example, “Cow, being-the-object-of-an-action (as designated\nby a word in the accusative case), bringing.” Gaṅgeśa\nadmits that it “could be an instance of knowledge of verbal\nmeaning, but it would not produce knowledge of an overall\nconnection” (2020: 1547). Nevertheless, with him the expectation\nis also something felt by a hearer, whose grasping the\nreference of one word with its case ending (which also refers,\naccording to him) leads to expectation not just of another word but of\nits referent. Thus expectation is a psychological property mediated by\nwords in reference to a fact. It is embedded in a subject’s\nunderstanding of words as united by their references comprising the\nfact that is captured by a statement. Sometimes\nGaṅgeśa’s dialectic, particularly in several sections\non verbal compounds and the like at the end of the chapter, trades on\nthe difficulty of finding a factual item to which a word would\ncorrespond in its real-world relationality as implicated in the\nincorporation of the word grammatically into a declarative sentence.\nThus while the “expectation” seems to work as a matter of\ngrammar, the “grammar” is thought to reflect a fact that\nthe words pick out. \nGaṅgeśa often refers to the problem of the word list that\nis not unified, several times appearing to reinstate a grammatical\nunderstanding of “expectation” as opposed to how\nobjects—referents—are related in fact. And once (2020:\n1547) this comes right at the heart of his endorsement of\n“incremental referentialism” as opposed to the\nconnectivist, “holistic” variety of the\nPrābhākara. He says, “ … a word endowed with\nexpectation and meeting the other requirements is what brings about a\nparticular presentation of an overall connection.” This seems to\nbe the answer to the problem of the list whose items do not show\ngrammatical connections although they are just what the things\nthemselves demand to constitute a fact, a truth-maker: “Pot,\nbeing-the-object-of-an-action (as designated by the accusative case),\nbringing, action.” The endings on the words in the list do not\nrefer to relations that connect up the other things properly. This is\nthe difference. Each item listed appears incomplete because, for\nexample, reference to bringing demands not only the meaning of a word\nas something that could be brought but a word in the accusative case\nwith the case ending indicating that it is in the right kind of\nrelation objectively. Every base word is by itself\n“unsaturated,” to use the Fregean term, referring to\nsomething in the world that has to hook up with something else\nreferred to, if there is to be a sentence and statement,\nabhihitânvaya. \nIn addition to a section devoted to a second sentential condition,\n“semantic fit,” yogyatā, Gaṅgeśa\nprovides a brief definition in other places in part because its\nviolation is commonly taken to be the trigger to take a word in a\nsecondary way, not directing us to a “native” referent (he\nalso advances a slightly different view of the trigger which\nwe’ll review later). For example (2020: 1228): \nSemantic fit (yogyatā) amounts to there being no\nlegitimate block to understanding a statement. \nIncluded in this is the “Gettier case” of a parrot’s\nsaying something that a hearer \\(H\\) would take as true if \\(H\\) did\nnot know the sounds were from a parrot. In the scenario, \\(H\\) fails\nto put together the sounds as words and as a sentence and does not\nacquire testimonial knowledge. Knowing that the sounds are from a\nparrot is a block. The yogyatā condition is defined\nnegatively and is commonly invoked as a kind a coherence check. And\nhere Gaṅgeśa concurs. \nHe resists, however, the application of the principle to a Vedic\ninjunction to perform a sacrifice whose result is supposed to be in\nthe distant future, going to heaven, say, which wouldn’t make\nsense, the ritualists reason, without elliptical reference to\napūrva, a magical “Unseen Force,”\nadṛṣṭa, that connects the completion of the\nsacrifice with its goal. According to Gaṅgeśa, no\napūrva is thereby referenced (etymologically that which\nis “not understood before” comprehension of an injunction\nas applying to oneself, say Mīmāṃsakas) and if there\nis “Unseen Force” created by a sacrifice or another good\nwork it, like all karma, inheres in the self of the performer,\naffecting, in particular, his or her next incarnation. Thus again he\nendorses a doctrine of the Nyāya-sūtra, which also\nrejects apūrva but accepts karma as popularly\nunderstood. \nThe Jewel’s section on “contiguity” is\nshort, and special topics such as ellipsis, etymology versus\nreconventionalization (only lotuses are referred to in Sanskrit by the\ncompound ‘paṅka-ja’,\n“mud-born,” although plants like the water-lily are also\nborn in mud), homonymy, and others are treated more or less briefly.\nBut the topic of injuction looms large in the chapter overall along\nwith a concern with Mīmāṃsaka views of moral authority\nas fundamenally a matter of Vedic injunction. \nInjunctions are commonly formed in Sanskrit through use of the\noptative verbal form, and a central question is just what does the\noptative affix mean. That one should do such and such seems to be the\ncore meaning about which everyone agrees, but different analyses are\ngiven of the idea that one should do such and such. A central thesis\nis that a certain kind of knowledge both prompts and guides any action\nthat is voluntary, pravṛtti, whether in everyday life\nor with a ritual. So now since rituals are actions, some of these\naction-prompting thoughts are prompted by comprehending Vedic\nsentences. Gaṅgeśa’s effort is often directed to\nintegrating our understanding of Vedic and everyday language, and he\nuses his criticisms of Mīmāṃsā analyses of ritual\nactions to illumine the voluntary in general along with “desire\nto do,” effort, and the knowledge that directs action,\nincluding, especially, knowledge of a “means to what’s\nwanted,” iṣṭa-sādhanatā, an idea\nhotly debated by all factions of Mīmāṃsā. A basic\ndivision in the school occurs on the issue whether means of\naccomplishing what is enjoined, or contemplated because desired,\niṣṭa-sādhanatā, is part of the content\nof an injunction (as itself implicated in any “desire to\ndo” as the desire’s cognitive content).\nBhāṭṭas insist that it is, but Prābhākaras\ndemur, claiming that such is known by a separate intellectual act of\n“presumption,” arthâpatti. For\nPrābhākaras, it is simply that something “ought to be\ndone,” its kāryatā, that is the meaning of an\ninjunction, with the means to what’s wanted known by\npresumption. Gaṅgeśa rehearses extensive arguments on both\nsides, and seems generally to favor the positions of the\nPrābhākaras. \nIn the end, Gaṅgeśa champions an understanding of the\ninjunction as expressing a certain kind of knowledge-prompting action,\nespecially “what one ought to do,”\nkāryatā, which he sees, agreeing with the\nPrābhākara, as the meaning of an injunction. That is to say,\nfor him, “what one ought to do” is the meaning in part.\nBut he also agrees with the Bhāṭṭa that a means has\nto be known or made known, and he adds another factor, effort, and the\nrequirement that the action be known as accomplishable by one’s\nown effort. \nAn ethical view centered on Vedic injunctions is embedded in\nMīmāṃsaka attitudes, and Gaṅgeśa shows\nsympathy for the life regulated by ritual, in particular daily rituals\nthat require no special qualifications. But his own ethical outlook is\nnowhere explicitly stated. At places he shows affinity for a\nsoteriological ethics implicit in a mystical way of knowing the\n“truth” concerning the “self,”\nātman, a self as experienced in a special kind of yogic\nmeditation. At several places, he quotes the Bhagavad\nGītā, apparently endorsing its karma-yoga teaching of\nbenevolent action. Despite sympathy for Mīmāṃsaka\npositions, when it comes to the striking and longlasting conflicts,\nethical and otherwise, between ritualists and mystics/yogins in the\nsubcontinent, Gaṅgeśa seems to line up with the\nyogins—like, it should be noted, Gautama, the author of the\nNyāya-sūtra and his commentators. Indeed, although\nairing Mīmāṃsā opinion apparently with much\nsympathy, Gaṅgeśa sees injunctions to perform rituals as\ntrumped by yogic teachings of the way to self-discovery. But also like\nmany Naiyāyikas before him, Gaṅgeśa appears to try to\nfind middle ground in ethics as in other areas of theory. Surely, he\nis not a radical critic of the ritualists’ moral codes, more\nlikely one of their number trying to nudge colleagues into broader\npoints of view. \nThe longest section in the testimony chapter and indeed in the\nentirety of the Jewel is devoted to\nlakṣaṇā, which is a second mode of meaning\ndependent on the first or primary called “denotation,”\nabhidhāna, i.e. reference. Nyāya-sutra\n2.2.62 gives about a dozen examples of semantic transference, for\nexample, “The stands are shouting,” where it is not the\nstands but the people in them who are shouting. And with “Usher\nin the sticks,” it is ascetics who carry walking sticks who are\nto be ushered in. In this example, the primary, denotative meaning is\nnot entirely transferred since the ascetics would carry their sticks\nin with them into the dining room, it is presumed. The most common\nexample in the Jewel is “The village is\nin-the-Gaṅgā,” where we understand the village to be\non the river’s bank (the indicated) because we know\nthat no village is actually built in the Gaṅgā,\nwhich is very deep. \nThe inherited view is that a violation of yogyatā,\n“semantic fit,” triggers a hearer to understand a\nsecondary sense. But one of the first comments Gaṅgeśa\nmakes about lakṣaṇā rejects this view,\nbringing up the phenomenon’s relevance to the debate about\nsentential unity, anvaya. He writes (2020: 1250): \n… [lakṣaṇā] is not triggered by a\nviolation of semantic fit (as is commonly held) but rather by a\nviolation of anvaya itself, of the overall connection of\nwords, the overall construction. For example, by force of context we\nunderstand from a violation of anvaya with the word\n‘stick’ in connection with ‘usher in’\n(“Usher in the sticks”) that the speaker’s purpose\nis to feed certain ascetics (who typically carry walking sticks) who\nwould be ushered in along with their sticks. \nIn a case where a secondary usage does not involve entire\nrelinquishment of the primary meaning but retains it in part, as (with\nthe previous example but also) in “The umbrella-holders are\ncoming,” it is precisely the context that tells us that the\ncoming is on the part of an umbrella-holder and also\nthose who are not umbrella-holders (important people over\nwhose heads a large umbrella is being held). Because of the violation,\nthe agency of the movement is understood. There would be a violation\nof anvaya in taking the meaning to apply only to a\nholder. \nSince it is entirely possible that several umbrella-holders are\ncoming, it must be something broader than “semantic fit”\nthat is violated in this and similar cases. \n“Indirect indication” does a lot of work for\nreferentialism, since there are many, many examples where no direct\nreferent is meant but a hearer comprehends a statement and acquires\ntestimonial knowledge. And although Gaṅgeśa resists\noveremployment of the notion, he uses it extensively. Further examples\nconcern the meaning of certain Sanskrit compounds and grammatical\nnumber, when, for instance, a plural form is used while what is meant\nis a single something or other. \nNaiyāyikas are hardly the only theorists who employ the tool.\nSome Mīmāṃsakas argue that reference is to the\nuniversal, the individual being indicated by\nlakṣaṇā. Gaṅgeśa considers the\nview that it is the universal that is known by\nlakṣaṇā, not the individual, the universal\nas specifying the character of the individual. On the dispute about\nreference to universals or individuals, Naiyāyikas want to agree\nwith all parties, it seems. Importantly, Gaṅgeśa sees\nreference to an individual as invariably to an individual of a kind,\nfor example “(A) cow,” would be to one qualified by\ncowhood: “the referent is an entity as qualified by a\nuniversal” (2020: 1576). To focus just on the cowhood would be\n“indirect indication,” he says, with the indicator being\nthe individual cow referred to. Prābhākaras tend to find no\nuse for lakṣaṇā, since according to them\nreference is holistic, a matter of the entire sentence, and the\nmeanings of the individual words are united in the hearer’s\nmind. Thus it is the radical referentialists who seem to need it\nmost. \nIn a remarkable passage, Gaṅgeśa puts forth a core argument\nfor lakṣaṇā (2020: 1631): \nObjection:\n\nReference (śakti = abhidhā) is alone\nsufficient (with no need to posit an additional mode of meaning),\nsince the conventional practice that supports anyone's understanding\nmeaning is common to both (what you call) primary and indicated\nsenses. For, the words (that make up a sentence and statement) having\nbeen put together, an etymological analysis can inform us of the\noverall connection because śakti, the power of\nreference, has accomplished a setting in mind, or settings in mind,\nproduced by the words. Otherwise, there could be neither testimony as\na knowledge source nor speaker’s intention, since this power\ngoverns and regulates them both. \nMoreover, if the speaker’s intention is understood (by anyone\nhearing “The village is in-the-Gaṅgā”), then\nonly reference need be imagined as accounting for the communication\n(no indirect meaning, lakṣaṇā), since that\nis the economical position. Like homonyms such as\n‘akṣa’ (“eye/dice”) and\ncompany, multiplicity of meaning is alone the right view. No\nuneconomical additional mode need be supposed. \nGaṅgeśa:\n\nWe answer. If we had to imagine that the word\n‘Gaṅgā’ is used (as you claim) for the\nthousands of things that could be indicated by using the word for such\na thing as a bank, then in order to understand a usage we would have\nto be familiar with another conventional practice of older persons\n(who have taught us the conventions of language) in each case among\nall the innumerable things that could be indicated. And so this view\nis uneconomical, and it is not borne out by experience. \nIndirect meaning (lakṣaṇā), on the other\nhand, is single, unitary, by nature to be related to what is picked\nout. And it does not require us to be familiar with another\nconventional practice of of older persons having the indicated as\nintentional object. Thus to have an economical position, it alone is\nappropriately posited. \nWithout lakṣaṇā, reference would have to do\ntoo much work and could not tie use of a word to a certain type of\nthing. It is to save the fixity of the referential tie that\nlakṣaṇā has to be posited. Its usefulness as\na concept depends on its flexibility. \nGaṅgeśa also swims against the mainstream by eschewing\nknowledge of speaker’s intention to explain the triggering of\nlakṣaṇā. He points out that typically one\nhas to understand a statement before knowing the speaker’s\nintention in making it. A hearer’s knowing the speaker’s\nintention is not a necessary factor in the generation of the\nhearer’s testimonial knowledge through indirect indication, he\nsays, but he admits that knowing a speaker’s intention could be\nsufficient. \nAbout the principles of transference, he has little to say other than\nto point to “relevant context” and “being set in\nmind quickly.” Indirect indication is preceded by comprehension\nof conventional meaning and is directed toward something that is\nrelated to the conventional meaning. But some cases,\n“frozen metaphors,” are reconventionalizations where the\nprimary, original meaning has been forgotten. A “windfall”\nseems to be a good example in modern English. There is a long and\nintricate discussion of this. Can we refer to a water-lily by using\nthe word ‘mud-born’? No, says Gaṅgeśa. The word\nhas been reconventionalized to mean in a primary way only lotuses and\nif used for a water-lily we would have a case of\nlakṣaṇā.","contact.mail":"stephen_phillips@utexas.edu","contact.domain":"utexas.edu"}]
