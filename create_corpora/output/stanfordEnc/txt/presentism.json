Thus, much of the literature that frames the development of\npresentism has grown up either in formulating objections to the view\n(e.g., Sider 2001: 11–52), or in response to such objections\n(e.g., Bigelow 1996; Markosian 2004), with exceptions to this largely\ncoming via the ways in which presentism is motivated. This entry\nmirrors the structure of that literature, for the most part.\nHere’s the plan for what follows. We begin with a more detailed\nsketch of presentism, its commitments and motivations. Then we move to\nconsider several concerns that have been raised for presentists. We\nuse these to illustrate both the breadth and severity of the\nchallenges that presentism faces, as well as the range of different\nversions of presentism developed to help meet these challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a bare ontological thesis, presentism can be understood as\nP: \nP is a claim about what there is, absolutely and\nunrestrictedly. As a description of presentism, it’s both\northodox and minimal. To flesh it out, the view is often contrasted\nwith two other ontological theses: an opposing view of time,\neternalism (“past, present, and future things exist”), and\nan analogical view in modality, actualism (“only actual things\nexist”) (see, e.g., Adams 1986: 321; Hinchliff 1996:\n123–4; Sider 1999: 326, 2001: 11–12; Noonan 2013:\n219–20). Theodore Sider, for instance, neatly articulates this\napparent orthodoxy: \nPresentism is the doctrine that only the present is real. … A\npresentist thinks that everything is present; more generally, that,\nnecessarily, it is always true that everything is (then) present. \nPresentism is the temporal analogue of the modal doctrine of\nactualism, according to which everything is actual. The\nopposite view in the philosophy of modality is possibilism,\naccording to which nonactual things exist; its temporal analogue is\neternalism, according to which there are such things as\nmerely past and merely future entities. (1999: 325–6) \nPresentists and eternalists make competing claims about temporal\nontology. According to presentism, only present things exist.\nAccording to eternalism, past and future things, such as dinosaurs and\nhuman outposts on Mars, exist as well. These are theories about what\nthere is, just like actualism, possibilism, Platonism, nominalism,\nMeinongianism, idealism, materialism, theism, atheism… (2006:\n75) \nPresentists and the rest thus disagree about what exists. When\nconfronted with W.V. Quine’s (1948) three Anglo-Saxon\nmonosyllables—“What is there?”—presentists\nhave a simple and distinctive reply: “Only what’s\npresent”. Non-presentists demur. Eternalists say that there are\npast and future things too. Growing block theorists\n(“no-futurists”) say that there are past and present\nthings, but no future things. On the orthodox picture, what’s\ndistinctive about presentism is determined primarily by the distinct\nset of claims made about temporal ontology. \nThe ontological doctrine, P, requires\nsupplementation. Consider, for example, a possible world, w, at\nwhich the growing block theory of time is true. At the first moment of\nw, P is true. There exists only the first\nmoment and that moment is present; there are no other moments, and so\nthe past hasn’t yet come to exist. Later on, it will become\nclear that w isn’t a presentist world, even though it\nseems initially to satisfy P: at the first moment,\nonly present things exist. For this reason, when being more\nforthcoming with a definition of their view, moving beyond mere\nslogan, presentism might more perspicuously be rendered as a view that\nis always true, if true at all (Crisp 2003: 215, 2004: 19,\nfn.6, 2007: 107, n.1). So, presentism amounts to the claim that: \nAlong the modal dimension, presentism might be thought of as a view\nthat is necessarily true, if true at all (e.g., Hestevold\n& Carter 2002: 499; Markosian 2004: 47, fn.1; Ingram 2016: 2868).\nThus: \nHowever, although presentists sometimes make this move, there’s\nvery little discussion in the literature as to whether\nPAN is preferable to PA and, if so,\nwhat would justify that preference. In what follows, reflecting that\nlack of discussion, we remain neutral on which of PA\nor PAN is preferred. We follow the wider literature\nin typically stating presentism as P, rather than\nPA, though we take it that something at least as\nstrong as PA is intended. \nMore modifications may be required. First, strictly speaking, on this\ncharacterization, presentism is a thesis that denies the existence of\natemporal or timeless entities, that is, entities that\naren’t present (but aren’t past or future either). This\nappears to rule out the existence of abstract entities. [See the entry\non\n abstract objects.]\n And this may be a step too far for some presentists. Hence, we might\nbe pressed to modify PA and restrict it to concrete\nobjects. We’re not forced to make that move, however, since\nPA only rules out abstracta qua timeless\nentities. Presentism is compatible with the existence of abstracta, so\nlong as such entities exist now (exist within time). In any case,\ntimeless abstracta are inconsistent with PA,\nbut (as is clear) this needn’t be of too much concern. It is\nunclear how much would be lost from the core of presentism if we\ncoupled PA to timeless abstracta. \nSecond, presentism isn’t merely the thesis that only present\nthings exist. This isn’t the full extent of the position.\nWithout qualification, P is consistent with the view\nthat reality is “static” (or “frozen”) and\nthat time doesn’t really pass. But reality isn’t that way;\nour reality is “dynamic”. Hence, a full and proper account\nof presentism requires more detail. Typically, presentism is thought\nto include the additional claim that various things have existed and\nthat others will exist: Julius Caesar, Marie Curie, and Amelia Earhart\nall existed, but exist no longer; and, though we exist, alongside\nTaylor Swift, Donald Trump, and you (dear reader), all of us will\ncease to exist at some future time(s), to be replaced by other things,\neach of which will go out of existence in their turn. Thus, presentism\ncommits us to there being a change in what exists over time, a change\nin what’s present. And, frequently (although not exclusively),\npresentists describe this change in terms of temporal\npassage—the passing of time—or, at least, as closely\nrelated to it. So, presentism can be understood as the following\nconjunction: \nFor those who state presentism explicitly in this way, see Price (2011: 277), Miller (2013: 346), and Leininger (2015: 726), amongst others. \nFurther, since presentism marks a difference between the present, on\none hand, and the past and future, on the other, it’s typical\n(although, again, not universal) to see presentism described as a\nversion of the “A theory” of time (e.g., Craig 2000;\nZimmerman 2008; Deasy 2017). Here we understand the “A\ntheory” as something like the union of the following two theses:\nthere are genuine, fundamental or “irreducible” properties\nof at least some of past, present and future (i.e., so-called “A\nqualities” or “A properties”); and, time passes (see\nthe entry on\n time,\n esp. §5). For recent explorations of presentism without the A\ntheory (or, without A qualities), see Rasmussen (2012) and Tallant (2012). \nThus far, our focus has been on saying what presentism is. And, as we\nsee it, we’ve reported faithfully what’s said typically\nabout the view in the contemporary literature. But the recent history\nof the view, presentism in the earlier parts of the\n20th century, is a little less clear. As far as we know,\nRobert Adams is the first to use the name “presentism” in\nprint (in 1986), though he implies that he isn’t the first to\nname it—he writes:  \n[a] reduction is offered by a view that is sometimes called\n“presentism” by analogy with “actualism”.\n(1986: 321)  \nBefore 1986, matters are unclear. Many (rightly) point to Arthur Prior\nas an important and historically significant adherent of presentism.\nWe agree that Prior endorses the presentist’s ontological\nthesis, P—he writes:  \nthe present simply is the real considered in relation to two\nspecies of unreality, namely the past and the future. (1970: 245)  \nBut we think that it’s less obvious that Prior’s complete\nview on time is presentism, as above (see e.g., Fine 1977,\nButterfield 1983 and Le Poidevin 1991: 36–40). [For detail on\nPrior’s life and work, see the entry on\n Arthur Prior.]\n There are others after Prior, but before Adams (1986) or Hinchliff\n(1988), who also appear to endorse P, such\nas Richard Routley (1980). Similarly, we take no stand here on whether\nsuch philosophers are presentists. \nThis concludes our opening sketch. Presentism is the view that only\npresent things exist and what’s present changes (i.e., things\nchange, time passes); and, it’s an A theory of time. Now, why\nbelieve it? \nThe most frequently cited reason given for endorsing\npresentism—or, at least, treating it as worthy of serious\ncritical consideration—trades upon some variant of the claim\nthat it’s the “intuitive” or “common\nsense” view of time (e.g., Bigelow 1996: 36; Sider 2001: 11;\nMarkosian 2004: 48; De Clercq 2006: 386; Tallant 2009b: 407). Many\nfriends agree, and more than a few foes concede, that there’s\nsomething compelling about the idea that present things really exist,\nwhilst past and future things don’t exist. Some who look to\ndefend presentism will rest there with the bare claim that presentism\nis intuitive (etc.) and that this gives us reason to think that\nit’s true. \nOne way to proceed is to extend this idea. Begin with the intuition\nthat there’s something special about the\npresent—something distinctive. This seems attractive enough. But\nhow might we capture it in our metaphysical model of time? One way to\ndo it is to assert that present things are the only things that exist, that is,\nto endorse the presentist’s ontic thesis. Certainly, this\nmarks the present as distinctive. And, to the extent that we wish to\ncapture and preserve the idea that the present is\n“special” (in some sense), so presentism fares well\nagainst this measure. But, of course, any model that\nprivileges the present in some way will fare well against the same\nmeasure. So, for this argument to fully motivate presentism, further\nargument must be given for thinking that these other rival views\ndon’t come up to scratch. \nAnother way to motivate presentism is via appeal to experience. To\nborrow a famous example, consider a headache (e.g., Zimmerman 1998:\n212). If a headache exists, it hurts. It can’t exist and fail to\nhurt. Now, suppose that we endorse the existence of the past (and deny\npresentism). Past headaches exist. But they don’t hurt (at\nleast, so goes the claim). If headaches from hangovers last year hurt\nus, neither author would be in a position to write this, so severe\nwould be the pain. Since headaches must hurt, if they\nexist—it’s part of their essence to do so—past\nheadaches cannot exist. This goes for the future headaches as well.\nThus, presentism is true. (For the classic statement of the\n“thank goodness that’s over” argument, in favor of A\ntheories of time, see A.N. Prior 1959. The wider literature is\nvoluminous. Representative recent works include: Suhler &\nCallender 2012, Hoerl 2015, and Pearson forthcoming.) \nThere are different examples that draw on our experience of pain and\nour attitude towards it. Consider again a past headache and compare it\nto a (possible) future headache, something that may result from over\nenthusiastic behavior in the bar this evening. A future headache is\nsomething that worries us. It influences our behavior. We seek to\navoid it. We may even fear it. By contrast, we feel differently about\na past headache (and past pains, generally). We don’t fear past\npains. They don’t worry us in quite the same way. One\nexplanation for this is that a past pain doesn’t exist. And\nwhilst a future pain doesn’t exist either, we know that it will\ndo so if we behave in such-and-such a way. It’s the potential\nfor that headache to exist (to come into being) that causes us to\nmodify our behavior. We wish to avoid that state. But if we think that\npast and future things exist, we cannot appeal to the explanation just\ngiven, for if the past headache exists, presumably we should fear it\nor worry about it, just as we should if a future headache exists. \nLast, but not least, we might motivate presentism by appealing to\nontological parsimony (e.g., Bourne 2006: 68–69). Suppose that we endorse something like “Ockham’s\nrazor”, viz. the principle that one shouldn’t\nmultiply entities beyond necessity (see the entry on\n simplicity,\n esp. §2). By asserting that only present things exist, by not\npositing the existence of any non-present things, the\npresentist’s ontology is more parsimonious than the ontology of\ntheir opponents (growing block theorists posit the existence of past\nand present things, eternalists posit the existence of past, present,\nand future things, etc.). All things being equal, we have at least a\ndefeasible preference for presentism over its rivals, if we have a\ntaste for ontological desert landscapes. \nThere are a number of complications with this way of motivating\npresentism. For one thing, although it’s typical (in\nmetaphysics) to see appeals to parsimony in cases where one view is\nmore “qualitatively” parsimonious than its\nrivals, that is, cases where a view posits fewer kinds of thing\nthan opposing views, it’s far less typical to see appeals in\ncases where one view is merely more\n“quantitatively” parsimonious than rivals, that is,\ncases where a view posits fewer things than another. The fact that\nappeals to quantitative parsimony are less typical reflects a general\nattitude that the only ontological parsimony that one ought to respect\nis qualitative parsimony. As David Lewis famously puts it: \nI subscribe to the general view that qualitative parsimony is good in\na philosophical or empirical hypothesis; but I recognize no\npresumption whatever in favor of quantitative parsimony (1973: 87) \nNow, it seems that if presentism is to be motivated by appeal to\nparsimony, then it must be motivated by appeal to considerations of\nquantitative parsimony. Presentism and eternalism don’t\ndisagree about the kinds of things that exist. Both\npresentists and non-presentists tend to agree on the metaphysical\nkinds (or “ontological categories”) that exist. What they\ndisagree about is the temporal location of the things that exist.\nPresentism states that everything exists at the present time;\neternalism states that there are things that exist at other times. If\npresentism is to be motivated in this way then we must justify a\npreference for quantitative parsimony in this case in the face of the\northodoxy that Lewis expresses. (See Tallant 2013b for an attempt to\ndeliver this sort of argument for presentism.) \nAt the outset, we noted that presentism has been formulated,\ndeveloped, and modified in response to a range of objections. In what\nremains of this entry, we consider what we take to be the most\nprominent and well-developed of these objections and explain how\npresentists have tried to respond (§§3–8). \nConsider the following minimal statement of presentism, viz.\nthe ontological thesis, P: \nThere is a concern with P, understood as a statement\nof presentism, arguing that the use of the verb “exist” is\nambiguous in a problematic way. The idea is that, once\nP is disambiguated properly, presentism is either\ntrivially true (but consistent with some non-presentist views) or else\nfalse. P admits of three apparently distinct\nreadings: \nThe highlighted portions indicate a putative disambiguation of\n“exist”. Opponents insist that these are the only\navailable readings of P and press the following\nargument: \nFor statements of this argument, see Crisp (2004: 17) and\nLudlow (2004: 22). For discussion of the (so-called)\n“sceptical” challenge, in a variety of forms, see Merricks (1995: 523, 1999: 421–2), Zimmerman (1998:\n209–10), Lombard (1999: 254–5, 2010), Sider (1999:\n325–7, 2006), Callender (2000: S588–90), Rea (2003), Meyer\n(2005, 2013), Savitt (2006), Stoneham (2009), Mozersky (2011:\n122–5), Torrengo (2012, 2016), Miller (2013: 348–51),\nTallant (2014) and Deng (forthcoming). \nThe argument (1)–(5) is valid. But why think that it’s\nsound? Well, premise (2) is clearly true. The claim that “only\npresent things exist now” amounts to the claim that “only\npresently existing things presently exist”. Whilst we\nshouldn’t disagree with this claim, it’s a mere triviality\nand cannot be used to advance a distinctive position in the philosophy\nof time. Moreover, P1 is consistent with\nthe existence of non-present things, contrary to the spirit of\npresentism. For example, Marie Curie isn’t a present\nentity—she doesn’t exist now—but she can exist (in\nthe past) without contradicting P1. Hence,\nP1 isn’t an adequate statement of\npresentism, regardless of its status as a truism. \nWhat about premises (3) and (4)? The standard justification for (3) is\nthat P2 is false because it’s open\nto counterexamples. The standard justification for (4) is that\nP3 collapses into\nP2. Both are controversial. We take each\nin turn. \nThe claim that we explore here is that: “only present things\nhave existed, exist now, or will exist”\n(P2) is false because some non-present\nthings have existed. For example, Marie Curie isn’t a present\nthing, but she has existed. This appears to be a counterexample to\nP2. \nOne might reply here that P2 isn’t\nfalse (for the reason just given) because there are no\nnon-present entities—presentists don’t think that there\nis something, Curie, that exists and isn’t present. To\nwork through the details here, it’s important to start talking\nabout what presentists accept in the domain of their most unrestricted\nquantifiers. That is, P2 isn’t false\nbecause there are no non-present entities in the relevant domain of\nquantification. Suppose that we read P2 in\nthe following way: “for any x, if x has existed,\nexists now, or will exist, then x is present”. And,\nfollowing Thomas Crisp (2004), presentists may read the quantifier\n“for any…” as “for any… within\ntime” (depending on views about the existence of timeless\nentities). If we shift to this reading, it’s no longer obvious\nthat P2 is false. It’s true that\nthere once was an entity, Marie Curie, who doesn’t exist at all\nanymore. But it’s not clear that Curie must be within the\nrelevant domain of quantification simply in virtue of having once\nexisted. So, if we read P2 as “for\nany x (within time), if x has existed, exists now, or\nwill exist, then x is present”—and we deny that\nthere are any non-present entities—then\nP2 isn’t false (cf. Crisp 2004:\n18–20). And, if P2 isn’t\nfalse, then premise (3) is false and the argument is\nunsound. \nOf course, whether one thinks that this kind of strategy is successful\nwill likely depend upon how one understands the locution “for\nany x”. Not everyone is likely to be persuaded. For\ninstance, Ulrich Meyer (2005: 214, 2013: 68–69), when advancing\nhis own “sceptical” challenge to presentism, considers a\nstatement of presentism that’s very similar to the reading of\nP2 offered by Crisp (2004), in which the\nstatement of presentism is equivalent to the claim that “only\npresent entities exist temporally”. (On the assumption that\n“x exists within time” and “x exists\ntemporally” are the very same notion, the two statements are\nequivalent.) However, Meyer argues that it’s clear enough that\nCurie exists temporally. After all, she has existed! And what can\n“x exists temporally” (or “x\nexists”) mean if not, simply, “x has existed,\nexists now, or will exist”? \nAssuming that the likes of Meyer are correct (and that the likes of\nCrisp are not), what should we make of premise (4)? What should we\nmake of the claim that: “only present entities exist\nsimpliciter” (P3) is false\nbecause P3 collapses into\nP2 (and P2 is\nfalse)? Perhaps we can argue that P3\ndoesn’t collapse into P2, and that\nP3 represents a distinct way to state the\npresentist’s ontic thesis. A defender of\nP3 might argue that there’s a notion\nof “existence simpliciter” that’s\nintelligible, substantive and, importantly, distinct from the\n“tensed” (“temporal”) notion of existence\nthat’s captured in P2 (i.e.,\n“has existed, exists now, or will exist”). \nOnce again, there’s clear and sustained disagreement about the\neffectiveness of this strategy. Suppose that we can insist sensibly\nthat there’s a notion of “existence\nsimpliciter” that helps presentism to avoid the\nchallenge that P3 collapses into\nP2. (If this is so, then our opponent\ncan’t tell us, simply, that P3 is\nfalse if P2 is false.) Nevertheless, this\nraises the question as to what, precisely, is meant by “x\nexists simpliciter” and whether the new notion can be\nused to characterize presentism. \nWhat does “x exists simpliciter” mean? In\nthis context, Meyer (2005: 214–5) tells us that if x\nexists simpliciter, then x exists either in the actual\nworld @, or else in some merely possible world. And, if x\nexists in @, then it exists in time, it exists\ntemporally; x either has existed, exists now, or will\nexist. Thus, it seems that if we specify the meaning of\n“x exists simpliciter”, we must take it to\nmean either that x exists “outside time”, but\nsomehow still in @, or else at some other world. But, perhaps\ncontroversially, Meyer (2005: 215) argues that neither of these ways\nof specifying the notion of “existence\nsimpliciter” will give us a characterization of\npresentism, qua model of time. Presentism is a view about\nwhat exists in time; it’s not a thesis about what exists outside\nof time, nor is it a thesis about what exists at other possible\nworlds. (Recall, from the discussion of the implications of\nPA, above, that nothing exists outside time, for\npresentists; nothing exists that isn’t present. Hence,\npresentism concerns what exists within time since it implies\nthat nothing exists without.) \nIt’s only fair to conclude this part of the discussion by noting\nthat it’s unclear how far we should be moved by these\nconsiderations. For instance, Daniel Deasy (2017) is clear that he\nthinks very little of this objection. Deasy discusses the objection\n(to presentism, defined as “always, everything is\npresent”), somewhat witheringly, as follows: \n[Some argue along the following lines:] the quantifier in the\ntraditional definition is either tensed or tenseless. If it is tensed\nthen presentism is the obviously false thesis that always, everything\nis now present. If it is tenseless then presentism is the trivially\ntrue thesis that always, everything is, was, or will be present.\n… The problem with this argument is that the key\npremise—that the quantifier in the traditional definition is\neither tensed or tenseless—is false. The universal quantifier in\nthe traditional definition (“everything”) should be read\nas expressing exactly the universal quantifier of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic … [The] traditional definition is\nintended to express a metaphysical thesis, and metaphysical theses\nought to be expressed in the most metaphysically\nperspicuous—i.e., most “joint carving”—terms\npossible. Classical first-order predicate logic is a much better\ncandidate for a language whose terms so cut than a natural language\nlike English. Moreover, the standard quantifiers of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic are neither “tensed” nor\n“tenseless” (or at least, not in the sense of the above\nargument). … [Quantifiers] are not verbs, they are quantifiers\n… Therefore there is no good reason to think the quantifiers\nhave either reading. (2017: 380–1) \nHowever, presentists shouldn’t celebrate too early. They should\nremain cautious. Deasy goes on to raise an independent concern with\nhow to define presentism. Echoing Timothy Williamson (2013:\n24–25), Deasy objects that there’s no satisfactory way to\nspell out what’s meant by “is present” in the\ndefinition of presentism. \nAs we’ve seen, standard ways of characterizing presentism face\nan array of definitional worries. So let’s change tack for a\nmoment. Presentism is the view that only present things exist. But it\nmight seem natural to suppose there’s more to presentism than a\nclaim about the extent of our ontological commitments. That is,\npresentism shouldn’t just be seen as a list of which objects\nexist (the present ones), but a claim about existence itself. Dean\nZimmerman (1996), for example,\ncharacterizes presentism as the view that “to be present\njust is to be real or to exist” (1996: 117). When presentism is\ncharacterized in this way, we can label it “Existence\nPresentism”, following Jonathan Tallant (2014). \nTrenton Merricks gives a more thorough expression of this picture, as\nfollows: \n[Standard] definitions, even though they get at something important,\nfail to get at what separates presentism most fundamentally from\neternalism. … [Presentism] and eternalism differ most\nfundamentally with respect to the nature of time and, relatedly, with\nrespect to what it is to exist at a time (and to have properties at a\ntime). (2007: 119–20) \nPresentists and eternalists alike say that those things that exist at\nthe present time really do exist and, moreover, that properties had at\nthe present time really are had. Thus one might think that, while\npresentism and eternalism part ways with respect to other times, they\nagree about the nature of the present time and, relatedly, agree about\nwhat it is to exist (and have properties) at the present time. But\nthey do not agree about these things. Indeed, their differences with\nrespect to the nature of, and existence at, the present time are as\nimportant as their differences with respect to the past and the\nfuture. (2007: 123) \n[Presentists] insist that there are objects that exist at the\npresent time (or, equivalently, that presently exist).\nSince they do not believe in a region called the “present\ntime”, presentists cannot reduce existing at the present\ntime to being located at that region. I think presentists should,\ninstead, say that existing at the present time just is\nexisting. Thus, given presentism, if something exists, then,\nobviously enough, it exists at the present time. So, given presentism,\nsince everything exists, everything exists at the present time. This\nis what is right about the standard definitions of presentism. (2007:\n125) \nThis way of characterizing presentism challenges the orthodoxy,\nsketched above (in\n §1),\n which takes the main difference between presentism and rival models\n(eternalism, etc.) to be their distinct ontological commitments. On\nthis revised way of thinking, such ontological disagreements are a\nconsequence of the view, rather than what’s truly distinctive\nabout it. Instead, what’s crucial to presentism is a claim about\nthe nature of what it is to exist. To exist is to be\npresent. \nHow, if at all, does this way of thinking about presentism help with\nthe definitional worries? Supposedly, this move helps us to identify a\nnew kind of disagreement between presentists and non-presentists.\nPresentists can endorse an identity claim of the form “existing\nat the present time is identical to existing” and thus draw new\nbattle lines. This identity claim is present tensed and it’s\ntrue now; it doesn’t face the same worries as the other\nstatements of presentism (P1,\nP2, or P3).\nNonetheless, the claim is distinctive; it’s not something to\nwhich eternalists can assent. Eternalists don’t agree that\nexisting now is existing. \nPrima facie, there are myriad “cross-temporal”\nrelations. We admire Marie Curie; admiration is a relation.\nYesterday’s rain caused today’s flood; causation is a\nrelation. There are other kinds of relation, which we discuss below,\nsuch as directly referring and truth-making, which seem like they\ncross times (and as if they might cause special trouble for\npresentism). For now though we want to consider the point very\ngenerally. Presentism is not compatible with the existence of Marie\nCurie or yesterday’s rainfall; we presentism denies the\nexistence of all past entities. Nonetheless, what we have here with\nadmiration and causation seems to be a relation. It’s very\nnatural and very reasonable to suppose that a relation can only be\ninstantiated if all of its relata exist: x cannot stand in a\nrelation R to y unless both x and y exist. If that’s\nright, then there’s an obvious worry. Presentism seems flat out\nincompatible with the existence of any and all cross-temporal\nrelations. Something must give. \nA famous statement of this “argument from relations” is\ndue to John Bigelow (1996). It goes as follows: \n…in order for a relation to hold between two things, both of\nthose two things will have to exist. Call this the principle that all\nrelations are existence entailing. Add as a further premise the\nsupposition that relations sometimes hold between a present thing and\nsomething else which is not present. The conclusion follows\nineluctably, that some things exist which are not present. (1996:\n37) \nBigelow suggests that this argument goes as far back as the Stoics and\nthe Epicureans. Here we focus on contemporary iterations of the\nproblem. For recent discussion of the problem, in a variety of forms,\nsee Adams (1986: 321–8), Quine (1987: 197–8),\nChisholm (1990a,b), Bigelow (1996), Sider (1999, 2001: 25–35),\nCraig (2000: 211–2), Davidson (2003), Markosian (2004), Crisp\n(2005), Brogaard (2006, 2013), De Clercq (2006), Torrengo (2006,\n2010), Inman (2012), and Ciuni & Torrengo (2013). For a\nsubstantial, book-length treatment of the issue, see Torrengo\n(2008). \nQuite generally, presentism can be defended via one of a few\nstrategies to address this worry about “cross-time”\nrelations. One option: to use presently existing entities to make\nsense of the relational claims. With our admiration of Marie Curie,\nfor example, this amounts to saying that: when she existed, Curie\ninstantiated various features and properties, those properties still\nexist, and it’s those present properties that we’re\nrelated to in admiration. Thus, it’s not Curie herself that we\nadmire, but her perseverance, insight and brilliance. Of course, one\nimportant issue with this strategy is that it fails to respect the\nidea that it’s Curie herself that we admire, rather than mere\nproperties that she exemplified. Alternatively, then, alongside\ndefending presentism we might deny that some or all relations are\n“existence-entailing”. Thus, we can stand in the relation\nof admiration to Marie Curie herself, even though there’s no\nsuch entity as Curie. But here we would face the difficult task of\ndenying the natural and reasonable supposition that a relation can\nonly be instantiated if all of its relata exist. Presentists who go\nthis route deny “serious presentism” and start down the\nroad towards Meinongianism, a position which many find quite\nundesirable (see the entry on\n nonexistent objects,\n esp. §4). Serious presentism is the temporal analogue of\n“serious actualism”, the view that “necessarily, if\nx has F or bears R, then x\nexists” (see the entry on\n actualism,\n esp. §2.2). (We remain neutral on the question of whether\npresentism implies serious presentism, pace Bergmann 1999,\nDavidson 2000, and leave the\n“non-serious” option open to presentists.) There’s\nat least one more option open: to say that such seeming cases of\nrelations aren’t, in fact, relational at all. Thus, rather than\nour admiration of Curie being a state that consists in Curie existing,\nour existing, and our bearing a relation to Curie, all that there is\nto such a state is our existing and instantiating a monadic property, admiring Marie Curie. Since the property is monadic,\nits instantiation requires only our existence. \nUnsurprisingly, there are questions about the advisability of each\nstrategy, in general, as well as about whether each can be pursued or\napplied sensibly in defense of presentism. Nonetheless, with the above\ngeneral overview in hand, we now turn our attention to two\nphilosophical problems that confront presentism: the problem of\nreference to non-present entities (§5) and the\n“truth-maker” problem\n (§6).\n Both are specific instances of our main objection, introduced above,\nand both present special problems for presentists. (The well-informed\nreader will note that we haven’t yet mentioned explicitly\nproblems concerning quantification across times or metric tensed\nstatements. We consider both as part of\n §6.) \nLet’s begin by noting that Socrates was a wise, snub-nosed\nphilosopher, who happened to be Plato’s finest teacher. From\nthis story, we can infer that “Socrates was wise” is true\nand, we might reasonably suppose, it expresses a (true) proposition,\n<Socrates was wise>. Similarly, we can take it that\n“Plato’s finest teacher was wise” is also true and\nit expresses a (true) proposition, <Plato’s finest\nteacher was wise>. [See the entry on\n propositions.] \nSome preliminary observations. Both propositions exist; they are true\nand so they must exist in order to be true. (Assuming something like\n“serious actualism”, see above.) Equally, both\npropositions are about the very same individual, Socrates, though\nthere’s a sense in which <Socrates was wise> is about\nSocrates more thoroughly (more intimately) than <Plato’s\nfinest teacher was wise> is about him. Indeed, it seems that\n<Socrates was wise> is “directly” about Socrates,\nwhereas <Plato’s finest teacher was wise> is only\n“indirectly” about him. <Socrates was wise> cannot\nfail to be about Socrates; it determines Socrates, the same\nindividual, in all possible contexts. But, by contrast,\n<Plato’s finest teacher was wise> is about Socrates only\naccidentally, only in virtue of the contingent fact that\nSocrates was Plato’s finest teacher. \nFurther, note that the sentence “Socrates was wise”, which\nexpresses <Socrates was wise>, contains a proper name\n(“Socrates”). And, suppose that this directly refers to\nSocrates. By contrast, “Plato’s finest teacher was\nwise”, which expresses <Plato’s finest teacher was\nwise>, contains a description (“Plato’s finest\nteacher”). We might suppose that this doesn’t directly\nrefer to Socrates, nor does it determine him in all possible contexts.\nConsider, for example, the possible scenario in which Socrates never\nencountered Plato. In this context, Plato’s finest teacher would\nhave been a distinct individual and the corresponding description\n“Plato’s finest teacher” would pick out that\nindividual. As such, <Plato’s finest teacher was wise>\nwould not be about Socrates and the truth of the proposition\nwouldn’t depend upon any facts about him. What unites both cases\nis reference; what divides them is the direct or indirect character of\nhow the expressions refer. Typically, reference is construed as a\nrelation that obtains between language and reality (between linguistic\nitems and things in the world). [See the entry on\n reference.]\n And, again: for two things to be so related, both things (both\nrelata) must exist. \nIn defending presentism we thus face a problem of direct reference\nwith respect to merely past entities. (Although, on one reading,\nit’s merely an instance of the general problem of\n“cross-time relations”, introduced above, in\n §4.)\n It seems that we can and do refer successfully to entities that have\nexisted and exist no longer, entities that don’t exist at all,\ngiven presentism. But, if this is so, then the past entities that we\nrefer to (and which are related to our linguistic items) must exist,\ncontrary to presentism. Presentists face a difficult choice. That is,\nthey must reject one of the following four claims, which form an\napparently inconsistent set: (i) we successfully refer to merely past\nentities, (ii) reference is a relation, (iii) for a relation to\nobtain, the relata must exist, and (iv) there are no merely past\nentities (i.e., past entities don’t exist). Presentists\ncan’t deny (iv), since that amounts to a rejection of\npresentism. But it proves almost equally difficult to reject any of\nthe other claims, given their independent plausibility. \nLet’s move away from the issue of reference, specifically, and\nturn to the metaphysics of propositions. First, note that <Socrates\nwas wise> is a “singular” proposition: a proposition\nthat’s directly about some individual, Socrates, whereas\n<Plato’s finest teacher was wise> is a\n“particularised” proposition: a proposition that’s\nabout Socrates, but not directly about them. [See the entry on\n singular propositions.]\n Frequently, propositions are taken to be complex metaphysical\nentities, entities with constituents and structure. [See the entry on\n structured propositions.]\n On this way of thinking, singular propositions are understood\ntypically as constituted by individuals, specifically the individuals\nthat they are (directly) about. Hence, a singular proposition about\nsome, x, is constituted by x itself. By contrast,\nparticularised propositions aren’t constituted by individuals,\nalthough they are structured entities with constituents. A\nparticularised proposition about x isn’t constituted by\nx, but may be constituted by a property of x. On this\nview, <Socrates was wise>, for example, is constituted by Socrates\nhimself, whereas <Plato’s finest teacher was wise>\nisn’t constituted by Socrates—but, perhaps, the\nproposition is constituted by some actual accidental property of\nSocrates, being the finest teacher of Plato or, indeed,\nhaving been the finest teacher of Plato. This way of thinking\nabout (singular) propositions isn’t universal, but it’s\npart of a standard theory with many adherents (see Adams 1986;\nWilliamson 2002; King 2007). \nIf propositions are complex (structured) entities with constituents,\nthen they depend for their existence upon the existence of their\npropositional constituents. The way that such entities ontologically\ndepend upon constituents is analogous to the way that sets depend upon\ntheir members. Consider, for example, {x}, x’s singleton\nset. {x} depends upon x for its existence. Typically,\nthis is cashed out as follows: necessarily, {x} exists only if\nx exists; and, it’s not the case that x exists\nonly if {x} exists. Similarly, we say: necessarily, some\nproposition P exists only if its (propositional) constituent\nc exist; and, it’s not the case that c exists only\nif P exists. [See the entry on\n ontological dependence.] \nPresentism faces a problem about how to account for the existence of\nsingular propositions about past entities. It seems that there are\nsuch propositions; recall that “Socrates was wise”\nexpresses a true singular proposition, <Socrates was wise>,\nwhich must exist in order to be true. The problem arises given a\nstandard treatment of singular propositions; that is, a proposition\nthat’s directly about an individual x is constituted by\nx itself, and propositions depend for their existence upon the\nexistence of their constituents. So, for example, <Socrates was wise>\nis constituted by Socrates himself and this proposition ontologically\ndepends upon Socrates. \nHere’s a deductively valid argument against presentism, based on\nthe above considerations: \nThe argument is clearly valid. To defend presentism, we must deny one\nof the premises. But each premise appears independently plausible. (1)\ntakes truth to be a monadic property, e.g., being true, and\nreflects a commitment to serious actualism: if P instantiates\nbeing true, then P exists. (2) takes propositions as\ntruth-bearers (or “truth-value bearers”) and follows from\nthe simple claim that there are truths about the past (more on this\nbelow, in\n §6).\n (4) takes propositions as complex entities and reflects a commitment\nto the principle that a complex depends for its existence upon things\nthat constitute it. The remaining premises, (5) and (7), follow\nstraightforwardly from the two metaphysical theses at issue, the\nstandard view of propositions and presentism, respectively. \nThe most obvious line of response (if we wish to avoid rejecting too\nmany plausible premises) is to deny some aspect of the standard view\nof propositions. Here we see a moderate and an extreme reply: a\nmoderate suggests a modification of the standard view (e.g., Ingram\n2016), an extremist suggests a total rejection of it\n(e.g., Merricks 2012). Moderates accept that propositions are\nstructured entities with constituents, but urge that the propositional\nconstituents are presently existing entities, and not any non-existent\npast entities. Extremists deny that propositions are structured\nentities and, instead, suggest a distinct treatment of\npropositions. \nFor another line of response, presentism might be modified à\nla Williamson (1998, 2002), who defends a view according to which\npast objects still exist, but are no longer concrete. We don’t\ntake a stand on whether such a position deserves the epithet\n“presentism” and, further, we note that Williamson (2013:\n20) explicitly states that he would prefer to see the debate between\npresentists and others recast in other terms, using a different\nmethodology. Nonetheless, it is clear enough that if the existence of\nabstract-Socrates (who once was concrete but now is abstract) is\ncompatible with presentism, then this would give the presentist a\nmeans to deny (7) and reject the argument given above. \nFor discussion of the above problem, in a variety of forms (i.e.,\nconcerning direct reference or singular propositions), see Adams\n(1986: 315–22), Fitch (1994), Markosian (2004), Merricks (2012:\n64–67, 2015: 170–3), and Ingram (2016).\nThere’s a modal analogue of this problem, facing actualism\n(roughly, the view that “only actual things exist”), and a\nrich literature accompanying it. For discussion of this problem, see\nAdams (1981), Plantinga (1983), Barcan Marcus (1985), Fine (1985),\nDavidson (2000), Merricks (2012: 64–71, 2015: 173–80), and\nSpeaks (2012). \nA good deal of work on presentism in the philosophy of time concerns\nitself with truth. In the current context, the work in question\nfocuses on whether (and, if so, how) presentism can account for the\ndifferent kinds of true proposition that we endorse. Our primary focus\nwill be on how to defend presentism whilst giving appropriate\nontological explanations for the truth of true claims about merely\npast things (with the “truth-making” literature as the\nbackground). We also briefly address a related problem of truths about\nspans of time (sometimes treated as a separate issue concerning\nquantification over times). \nNow we turn to one of the most discussed challenges to presentism in\nthe contemporary debate: the (so-called) “truth-maker”\nobjection to presentism. At first pass, this objection is another\ninstance of the general problem of cross-temporal relations\n (§4),\n but there are reasons for thinking that concerns about truth-makers\nunderwrite a special problem for presentists. This objection is\ntreated as a significant problem for presentism by many, including but\nnot limited to: Sider (2001: 35–42), Armstrong (2004:\n145–50), Keller (2004), Crisp (2007), Cameron\n(2011), Sanson & Caplan (2010), Markosian (2013), and Tallant &\nIngram (2015). For one\ngeneral discussion of the problem, see Caplan & Sanson (2011). [See the entry on\n truthmakers\n for background.] \nThe truth-maker objection is presented as a tension between three\nindependently plausible principles: (i) presentism, (ii) that there\nare (evidence-transcendent and objective) truths about the past, and\n(iii) truth-maker theory, the view that truths about the past are\n“made true” by some existent (see, e.g., Keller\n2004: 85–87; Cameron 2011: 55–57; Tallant & Ingram\n2015: 355, for this mode of presentation). Obviously, we cannot defend\npresentism and also abandon (i), and giving up on (ii) seems a steep\nprice to pay. If there are no truths about the past, then it’s\nhard to make sense of the idea that things change from one moment to\nthe next (or that time passes; see below,\n §7).\n That leaves us with (iii). Here, three options present themselves:\nlocate the required “truth-makers”; deny that truths about\nthe past require truth-makers; or, argue that truth-making isn’t\nthe kind of relation that requires the existence of both relata. We\nconsider these options in turn. \nIt’s worth noting, at the outset, that a version of the problem\ncan be stated with the principle that “truth supervenes upon\nbeing” in place of truth-maker theory, (iii), as in Kierland\n& Monton (2007). But it’s far more common to raise this\nspecific objection as a problem about a lack of truth-makers (rather\nthan the lack of an appropriate “subvenient base”). And so\nit’s the “truth-maker” objection, in particular,\nupon which we focus our attention. \nTruth-makers for truths about the past aren’t easy to find. We\nare searching for entities “in virtue of” which\npropositions about the past are true. For example, <Curie\nexisted> is true in virtue of some entity, its\n“truth-maker”. But what plays the truth-making role?\nSchematically, two kinds of solution can be given here: (i) posit\npresently existing truth-makers, or (ii) posit truth-makers that exist\n“outside time”. This second option is open to presentists\nwilling to countenance the existence of some atemporal\nentities (e.g., propositions, numbers, and so on). (Such a version of presentism\nwould require a defense the idea that entities that exist\noutside of time do no violence to the claim that “only\npresent things exist”.) \nPresentism can be amended via the addition of atemporal\ntruth-makers—truth-making entities that are, in a sense,\n“outside” time—see Bourne (2006) and Crisp (2007).\nThis is “ersatz presentism”. Ersatz presentism is the\nclaim that, for example, <Curie existed> is “made true” by\nan abstract time that represents how things were when Curie existed.\n(This is an “ersatz” abstract time, rather than a\n“genuine” concrete time.) One way to understand Ersatz\npresentism is as the view that there’s an abstract\nfour-dimensional manifold of times that represents how things were,\nare now, and will be. This manifold is ordered by an ersatz\nB-theoretic “earlier than” relation and forms an ersatz\nB-series of times. Here, the truth-makers for truths about the past\nare abstract entities: the ersatz times. An ersatz time, T,\nrepresents how things were (at some past time) by some other\nersatz time, T*, accurately representing how the concrete\nworld is now, and by T bearing the “earlier\nthan” relation (the “ersatz B-relation”) to\nT*. \nErsatz presentism is popular but the other position—the view\nthat we should posit presently existing\ntruth-makers—includes more variation. The most well-known\nversion of this view is “Lucretianism” espoused by John\nBigelow (1996). Lucretianism claims that <Curie existed> is made\ntrue by the world now instantiating a primitive past-tensed property\n(a “Lucretian” property) of having contained Marie Curie.\nHere the presently existing truth-maker is the present instantiation\nof the Lucretian property (having contained Curie) by the\nworld. There are a range of other “property solutions”,\nalongside Lucretianism, which differ in important respects but which\nshare a common core. For instance, see Keller (2004: 94–101) on a range\nof solutions, including one with indestructible atoms and their\nproperties, Cameron (2011, 2013) on temporal distributional\nproperties, McKinnon & Bigelow (2012) on tensing the instantiation\ntie, and Ingram (forthcoming) on uninstantiated thisnesses and their\nproperties, amongst others. \nResponses to the positions that posit presently existing truth-makers,\nsuch as Bigelow’s Lucretianism, along with the\n“Bigelow-style” property solutions (mentioned briefly),\neach seem to suffer from three distinct problems, perhaps only one of\nwhich afflicts the “ersatz presentist” proposal. We\nrehearse the problems facing presentism so-supplemented via these\nadditional truth-makers. \nFirst, note that any solution must ensure that the truth-makers\ndeliver the “right results” with respect to what’s\ntrue about the past. To illustrate, consider the following natural\nprogression of an object through time. Our story begins with a green\nbanana. Time passes and the banana ripens. The banana is now yellow,\nbut it was green. The world now instantiates the property having\ncontained a green banana (or so says the Lucretian). So far, so\ngood. But now consider the following progression, where the banana\nripens and yet the world comes to instantiate a different Lucretian\nproperty. Here the world instantiates the property having\ncontained a red banana, rather than having contained a green\nbanana. This progression is problematic. Witness: in the scenario\nimagined, though it was the case that the world contained a green\nbanana, <There was a green banana> is false; and, despite the\nworld never having contained a red banana, <There was a red\nbanana> is true. And, although the problematic progression\ndoesn’t appear at all likely, the worry with these\n“property” responses to the truth-maker objection is that\nthese kinds of progression appear possible, given the\nadvertised metaphysic. If such progressions are possible, they present\nan objection to these presently existing entities in fact being the\nright kind of truth-makers for truths about the past (see, e.g.,\nTallant & Ingram 2012; Cameron 2013; and Leininger 2015, for\ndiscussion of this sort of challenge). \nA second concern with “property solutions” stems from the\nworry that the kind of properties involved, for example, primitive tensed\n“Lucretian” properties, are wholly objectionable.\nProperties such as having contained dinosaurs seem, to many,\nto be “suspicious” or “dubious”\nentities—they are objectionable entities that shouldn’t be\ncountenanced in a respectable metaphysic. They are dubious and\nobjectionable because, in a sense that’s quite difficult to pin\ndown, they point beyond their instances (their bearers).\nThus, having contained dinosaurs is a property that\n“points beyond” how the world is now; it points\nbeyond the intrinsic nature of its bearer, and “points” to\nhow the world was; namely, containing dinosaurs. And, say the\nobjectors, acceptable properties aren’t like that; respectable\nproperties don’t point beyond (see, e.g., Sider 2001:\n39–42; Crisp 2007: 93–98; Merricks 2007: 134–6; and\nCameron 2011: 58–62, who each endorse versions of this\nchallenge, but see Tallant 2013a who argues that all such challenges\nmiss the mark in some way or other). \nAnother significant objection facing presentist attempts to solve the\ntruth-maker objection is based on “aboutness” intuitions\nand their role in determining which entity (or entities) is an\nadequate truth-maker for a particular truth. The idea goes as follows.\nA truth (any truth) is about something. If a proposition is made\ntrue—if a proposition “owes its truth” to something\nin the world—then the thing in the world that makes the\nproposition true should be what the truth is about (Merricks 2007:\n28–34). After all, <Taylor loves to sing>, for instance, is about\nTaylor and her love of singing. It would be altogether wrong for that\nproposition to be made true by the existence of anything other than\nTaylor and her love of singing. At least, so goes the thought. \nHowever, all these “solutions” to the truth-maker\nobjection share a common feature: the past entities that propositions\nabout the past seem to be about don’t exist, given\npresentism. Marie Curie doesn’t exist, yet <Curie existed>\nis about Curie. There are no dinosaurs, yet <there were\ndinosaurs> is about them. Our “aboutness”\nintuitions tell us that propositions about the past should be\nmade true by past entities, but they simply cannot be, given\npresentism. Whether the truth-makers we posit exist now, or\nexist outside time, the kind of entities that we posit won’t be\nup to the task. If we respect the aboutness constraint (on truth-maker\ntheory), and cannot shake off this objection, we will likely be\ninclined to give up on solving the objection by attempting to locate\nthe required truth-makers. (There are some exceptions. For example, Ingram\nforthcoming develops a Bigelow-style response and argues that the\nputative truth-makers, uninstantiated thisnesses, do satisfy aboutness\nintuitions.) \nThere’s time enough to mention briefly one additional\ncomplication. So far, we’ve focused on truths such as <Marie\nCurie existed> and <The banana was green>. But what about\n<Curie existed 100 years ago> or <The banana was green 3 days\nago>? Both include a “metric”, a term that\nspecifies a temporal interval or indicates some temporal distance. Now\nnote that since <Curie existed> is true now, it will always be\ntrue hereafter. Interestingly, however, the same isn’t true for\n<Curie existed 100 years ago>. (Curie ceased to exist in 1934.)\nHence, <Curie existed 100 years ago> will fail to be true in\n2035.) The same rules for tensed truths don’t apply to metric\ntensed truths, so we must find some way of accommodating them. Even\nso, it seems that presentists can say similar things in the case of\nmetric tensed truths as they do in the case of tensed truths. For example, take Bigelow’s Lucretianism and its putative truth-maker for\n<Curie existed>, viz. the present instantiation of a\ntensed (Lucretian) property of having contained Marie Curie by the\nworld. With a fairly simple modification, this view can deal with\n<Curie existed 100 years ago>. All that’s required is\nmetric tensed properties, such as the property of having contained Curie\n100 years ago. This is the sort of property that’s now\ninstantiated by the world (in 2017) but won’t be instantiated at\nsome point in the future (such as in 2035). So, the challenge from\nmetric tenses complicates matters but, at least on the surface, is far\nfrom insurmountable. \nRecall, the claims that generate the truth-maker objection: (i)\npresentism, (ii) there are truths about the past, and (iii)\ntruth-maker theory. The strategy just discussed, viz.\nlocating truth-makers for truths about the past, attempts to reconcile\nall three claims. But another strategy is to simply deny (iii), to\nassert that truths about the past don’t require\ntruth-makers. \nThis way of approaching matters has been mooted (e.g., Tallant 2009b),\nbut it hasn’t received a huge amount of support. This is due, at\nleast in part, to the fact that it’s only a partial response.\nIt’s all very well to deny that all truths require truth-makers,\nfor instance, and so deny that truths about the past require\ntruth-makers. It’s another thing altogether to explain what we\nshould say instead about truths about the past. And\nsurely something must be said, if we hope to account for\ntheir truth. We can’t say, simply, that truths about the past\nrequire no truth-makers and then say nothing more about what they\nrequire. And while we might look to replace a truth-maker theory with\nsomething less ontologically committing, presentists haven’t\nbeen forthcoming with an account of how truths get to be true, if not\nby some kind of truth-making account. \nAll of this leads us to the final option that we will consider here.\nNamely, that the truth-maker relation isn’t existence-entailing.\nThis kind of approach, described elsewhere as “nefarious”\n(contrasted with the “upstanding” project of locating\ntruth-makers), uses the language of truth-making without positing any\ntruth-makers for truths about the past. In presenting the nefarious\nstrategy, we can treat it as something like the union of two theses:\n(1) truths about the past are expressed using primitive (and\nunanalysable) tense operators; and, (2) the tense operators\ndon’t pick out a distinctive ontological category or aspect of\nreality. This sort of nefarious approach has been pursued recently by\nTallant (2009a), Sanson & Caplan (2010), and Baia (2012), amongst others. The labels\n(“nefarious” and “upstanding”) are due to a\nrecent discussion by Tallant & Ingram (2015). \nTo clarify: nefarious “cheats” (like Tallant) will say\n“<It was the case that p> is true, because it was the case\nthat p”. Here, the “was” is primitive and\nunanalysable. Notice, also, that those adopting this position will\nagree that this “was” doesn’t pick out any ontology;\nit doesn’t help us to speak of any distinctive metaphysical\ncategory. To that extent, those in this “nefarious” camp,\nwill agree that there are truths about the past, and will agree that\nhow the world was makes true how things are, but they deny\nthat the ensuing truth-maker “relation” (such as it is)\nbetween the past and the present (i.e., the true propositions) is\nexistence-entailing. For some, that might simply be considered\ntreacherous. How might presentists motivate the nefarious\nposition? \nOne key motivation involves a comparison with the\n“upstanding” approaches and the first problem we raised\nfor them, viz. getting the “right results”\n(discussed above). To be clear, if we think that there are\ntruth-makers, then we must ensure that the truth-making entities get\nthings right. That is, if the world contained a green banana, then it\nhad always better be true, any time after the fact, that a truth-maker\nexists for <There was a green banana> (rather than, say, a\ntruth-maker for <There was a red banana>, in the case where the\nworld never contained a red banana). But notice, then, that this seems\nto imply some kind of “fixing” relation; how the world\nwas (containing a green banana, not containing a red banana)\nserves to “fix” what truth-makers exist now.\nFixing is, plausibly, a relation. And, if x fixes y\nthen, intuitively, both x and y must exist; both relata\nof the fixing relation should exist. But, clearly, on the presentist\npicture, that’s not acceptable. Past things don’t exist\nand, in that case, the required “fixing” is a relation\nthat isn’t existence-entailing; it doesn’t require the\nexistence of both relata. And, if that’s right, then presentists\nmay as well “cut out the middleman” (so to speak) and\nsimply treat the truth-making relation as\n“non-existence-entailing” and so avoid any ontological\ninflation. Presentists don’t require ontological commitment to\nersatz times, Lucretian properties, etc., to serve as truth-makers for\ntruths about the past. They can do without. \nIs presentism out of the woods when it comes to the truth-maker\nobjection? It’s far from clear. We may, for instance, retain the\nworry that a relation (any relation) must be existence-entailing and\nthat what this shows is that we should give up on presentism (see,\ne.g., Baron 2013). And, even if we can solve the truth-maker\nobjection, there’s a closely related concern that looks like it\nwill raise further problems. (We discuss the related concern in what\nremains of this section.) \nIt’s true that there have been seven English Kings called\n“Edward”. Is presentism compatible with that claim? How\nshould we interpret the semantics? At no point in history were there\nall seven Kings; the Edwards weren’t contemporaneous. But, if\nthe Edwards didn’t all exist together, then how can <There\nhave been 7 English Kings called “Edward”> be true?\nPresentism faces a novel problem regarding truths about the past when\nsuch truths concern “spans” of time (see, e.g., Lewis\n2004). After all, the natural reading is false: it was the case that\n“there are 7 English Kings called\n‘Edward’”. \nTwo routes suggest themselves as plausible avenues to explore. The\nfirst is to try to make sense of talk of spans by using talk of\nindividual times. Following the literature, call these “slice\noperators”. The idea, then, is that we say that  \nIt WAS the case that [“<There is a King called\nEdward>, and it WAS the case that [<There is a King\ncalled Edward>, and….]]”  \nSomewhat loosely, we can describe this as analyzing the span in terms\nof the individual “slices” that would make it up, were\nsuch a thing as a “span” to exist. \nThere are many difficulties with this kind of approach. The most\nobvious challenge is that, in the above, the second iteration of our\ntense operator, “WAS” appears within the scope of the\nfirst. Thus, the attempted paraphrase of <There have been 7 English\nKings called “Edward”> is a sentence of the form\n“there has been a king called ‘Edward’, and there\nhad been a king called ‘Edward’…”. For one\nthing, however, suppose that there have been infinitely many entities\nin the past. Kings will not be a useful candidate here, so imagine\ninstead that there have been infinitely many electrons. Hence,\n<There have been infinitely many electrons> is true. But this\nrequires a construction with an infinite number of nested quantifiers\nand tense operators. This won’t do, for no such construction can\nbe generated, despite the fact that we clearly can utter a\nsentence that expresses the relevant proposition, “there have\nbeen infinitely many electrons”. \nAnother important problem for the translation approach is that there\nseem to be cases in which the paraphrase is false and yet the\nparaphrased sentence is true. Consider a merely possible case in which\nsome of the past Kings were instantaneous and simultaneous. (If this\nis too implausible in the case of Kings, given facts about royal\nsuccession, then swap the case for one involving fundamental physical\nparticles which can be instantaneous and simultaneous.) \nThe second route sees us endorsing a primitive “span”\noperator, an operator that picks out temporal intervals rather\nthan individual moments (cf. Lewis 2004: 12). Rather than try to\nanalyze the span in terms of slices, this approach sees us just\nendorsing a span operator as a primitive piece of terminology. Berit\nBrogaard (2007) introduces this strategy very neatly, as follows: \nWhere the usual slice operators mean (as the eternalist would put it)\n“at some past (or future) moment”, a span operator means\n“at some past (or future) interval” ([Lewis] 2004: 12).\nThus, where “it HAS been that” is the past-tense span\noperator, Lewis suggests that we translate “there have been two\nkings named Charles” as “it HAS been that (there are two\nkings named Charles)”. By eternalist lights, this means that\n“it is true of some interval in the past that there are two\nkings named Charles” ([Lewis] 2004: 12). The presentist, of\ncourse, cannot accept this translation, but must presumably treat span\noperators as primitives. (2007: 73) \nThere are also problems with this route. First, it seems that such\nspan operators introduce ambiguities. Let’s introduce the span\noperator “HAS” as the operator “it has been the case\nthat…” and consider a target sentence, “first it\nwas raining and then the sun shone”. Then, suppose that we\nparaphrase this as: “HAS (it is raining and the sun is\nshining)”. This is problematically ambiguous. The paraphrase\nmight mean that there has been an interval of time throughout which it\nhas both been the case that the sun has shone and it has rained. Or,\nit might mean that there is an interval of time, throughout a\nsub-interval of which the sun shone and throughout another\nsub-interval of which it rained. Clearly, we want the latter; but with\nHAS, at least as stated, we have no means of differentiating the two.\nIf the semantics of the span operator are ambiguous, then it\ndoesn’t give us a sensible semantics for span-talk. \nAs should be clear, merely solving the truth-maker objection\ndoesn’t automatically address this problem of spans. The\ntruth-maker objection rests upon the fact that presentists apparently\nlack the ontological resources required to accommodate truth-making.\nThe span objection rests upon the fact that, given presentism, it is\nfar from clear how to provide an adequate regimentation of the\nsemantics of ordinary language. Bringing together an adequate\nsemantics as well as an adequate ontology is no easy task. \nNext, we turn to an objection to presentism that concerns the idea\nthat time really passes. The challenge, put simply, is presentism\nisn’t compatible with this feature of reality. This is a problem\nsince presentism is a view that requires that reality is dynamic\n(i.e., not static) and that a change in what exists over time\nthat’s usually described in terms of the passage of time. (For\nthe purpose of this entry, we ignore general arguments to the\nconclusion that time doesn’t really pass and, instead, focus on\nspecific challenges to presentism concerning passage.) \nWhy think that presentism isn’t compatible with temporal\npassage? Well, begin with the fact that, typically, the passage of\ntime is expressed in the following terms: what’s future\napproaches the present, becoming less future, and what’s past\nrecedes from the present, becoming more past. Prima facie,\nthere’s a problem. What’s apparently required for the\ntruth of this passage metaphor is inconsistent with presentism; the\nview that only present things exist. There’s nothing that is\nfuture and so nothing to approach the present. Nor is there anything\nthat is past and so nothing to recede from the present. Hence, if we\nare to defend presentism then we have to suggest another way to\ninterpret the claim that time really passes. \nOne way to reinterpret the claim is as follows: there’s change\nin what exists over time. Put another way: what’s present\nchanges. But it’s unclear whether this solves the problem or\nshifts it down the road. What’s required in order to account for\nthe claim that “what”s present changes’? One might\nreasonably suppose that in order to assert that what’s present\nchanges, from one moment to the next, we require a difference in the\ncharacter of successive moments. But there are no such successive\nmoments, given presentism. There’s only the present moment and\nits contents. \nIn defense of presentism, we might insist that what exists\nnow is sufficient to account for the difference in character\nof successive present moments. Some of the strategies used in reply to\nobjections concerning cross-time relations and, in particular, the\n“truth-maker objection” (§§4–6) are useful\nhere. Consider, for example, ersatz presentists who posit abstract times, that is,\nmaximal consistent sets of tensed propositions that represent\nhow things are, but also how things were and will be, when the time is\npresent (when it’s “true”) (e.g., Markosian 2004; Bourne 2006; Crisp 2007). Ersatz presentism has the resources\nto assert that things really change (and so time really passes);\nthere’s a difference between the character of successive\nmoments, given the manifold of ersatz times. How things are, at the\n(concrete) present time, is different from how things were, as\nrepresented by an abstract time. Indeed, it seems that any version of\npresentism that posits presently existing entities to address worries\nabout cross-time relations, for instance, as putative “ontological\ngrounds” for truths about the past, can use such entities to\nestablish that there’s a difference between successive moments\nwithout reifying any non-present things. \nAt this point, however, a new question arises. So understood,\npresentism is giving us the resources to ground time’s passing,\nat, and only at, the present time. That is, everything required to\nestablish that things change from one moment to the next must be\ncontained within a single moment, the present. But within such a\nversion of presentism, what guarantees that things\nreally change? Or, to approach the same point in a different\nway, what in the metaphysics guarantees that the present resources\naccurately reflect how things were—for example, why think that\nthe ersatz manifold accurately represents the past—when\nthere’s no connection to the past? Why can’t reality\nconsist of a single “frozen” slice of concrete time, along\nwith the various ersatz-times? If reality really is that way\n(what’s concrete never changes and we have nothing more than a\nfrozen concrete instant against the backdrop of many ersatz times),\nthen we still have no temporal passage. What the presentist must do is\nfind some way of insisting that reality cannot be such; reality cannot\ninclude but a single concrete slice coupled to truth-makers for talk\nabout the past and future, where those truthmakers cannot be said to\nguarantee that things really change (compare with\nthe discussion of how truthmakers get the “right results”\nfrom §6). \nIn preceding sections, we examined problems facing presentism that\ncome from metaphysical quarters. In particular, we looked at a problem\nof “cross-temporal relations”\n (§4),\n and discussed two instances of that general problem, which pose\nspecial problems for presentism (§§5–6), before\nexamining a related challenge concerning temporal passage. Now, though\nthere are many worries for presentism that come from metaphysics,\nperhaps the most serious objection to presentism comes from physics.\nIn particular, the special theory of relativity (“STR”)\nhas been presented as in direct tension with presentism. [See the\nentry on\n being and becoming in modern physics.] \nSimon Saunders (2002) gives us a clear picture of how things\nsupposedly stand with respect to presentism and STR, as follows: \nAccording to presentism, all that is physically real is the\npresent—a system of physical events all of which are\nsimultaneous with each other. No other events are real. Precisely what\nthis system of events may be, now, as I snap my fingers, may not be\nknown to me; but there is a fact of the matter as to what it is, and\nit is a universal fact which embraces us all. It is an intersubjective\nreality—now, as a snap my fingers—and it is a reality\nwhich contains us only as an incidental part. But even if one knew all\nthat there is to know, consistent with special relativity, one would\nnot be able to say what this system of events might be. According to\npresentism, therefore, special relativity is radically deficient as a\ndescription of reality. It is blind to the sequencing of what is\nphysically real. (2002: 279–80) \nA quick and dirty reply on behalf of presentism is to suggest that\nmetaphysics and science are, in some sense, demarcated disciplines.\nThat is, the findings of physics are of no relevance to our best\nmetaphysics (and vice versa). But this doesn’t seem to be a move\nthat we should make. Both metaphysician and physicist are, surely,\ntrying to uncover the structure of the world and to theorize about the\nnature of reality (fundamental or otherwise). To ignore one another is\nno way for protagonists to carry on, when both aim at the same basic\ngoal. Of course, this means that we must say something in reply to\nSaunders and others, who raise the same sort of objection, for example,\nPutnam (1967), Stein (1968, 1970), Savitt (1994, 2000), Sider (2001:\n42–52), and Wüthrich (2013). But what can\nbe said? \nKatherine Hawley (2006) suggests two routes: “Undermining”\nor “Counterargument” (we introduce each in turn). Suppose\nthat, as seems to be the case in the debate concerning STR, we want to\nargue that some metaphysics, posited by science, is false. That is,\nthe science, as it’s traditionally interpreted, delivers the\n“wrong” metaphysics. There are options (though, as Hawley\nnotes, it seems likely that any genuine attempt to respond to the\nobjection from relativity may require a little of each). First,\n“Undermining”: \nThis is the attempt to show that the scientific metaphysics is not\ninvolved in generating novel prediction, and thus that its appearance\nin a scientific theory does not give us reason to think it true.\n(2006: 463) \nAs Hawley notes, there’s a second step to Undermining, since\nmerely establishing that the metaphysics implied by the traditional\ninterpretation of a scientific hypothesis isn’t essential to the\nscientific theory, doesn’t establish that the metaphysics with\nwhich we would seek to replace the scientific metaphysics is\npreferable. We need to do more than show that the metaphysics implied\nby traditional interpretation and the metaphysics that we prefer are\non a par. We need to show that the\n“metaphysically-supported” metaphysics is on a stronger\nfooting than the “scientifically-supported”\nmetaphysics. \nUndermining is a strategy that a number of metaphysicians have\nplausibly looked to deploy, arguing that there are empirically\nequivalent theories that differ with respect to metaphysical\ncommitments, but yield the same predictions. For instance, see Craig\n(2001) and Markosian (2004); Zimmerman (2011) explores a range of\noptions. \nConsider a case: if a rod, R, is traveling in direction d and\nis observed by an observer, O, who is stationary with respect\nto R, then R will appear to be length l. If,\nhowever, O is in motion with respect to R, moving toward\nit, then the length of R will appear, to O, to be less\nthan l. There are two competing explanations we might give, a\nstandard “space-time” interpretation, as well as a\n“neo-Lorentzian” interpretation. As Balashov & Janssen\n(2003) have it: \n…the space-time interpretation and the neo-Lorentzian\ninterpretation provide constructive theory explanations. In the\nspace-time interpretation, the model is Minkowski space-time and\nlength contraction is explained by showing that two observers who are\nin relative motion to one another and therefore use different sets of\nspace-time axes disagree about which cross section of the\n“world-tube” of a physical system give the length of the\nsystem. In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation, length contraction is\nexplained by a combination of dynamical effects of measurement. (2003:\n331) \nNow, to endorse this “Undermining” approach, we would have\nto say that the neo-Lorentzian account is preferable to the space-time\naccount. And, problematically, that looks to be false. The problem is\nas follows. There’s an explanatory advantage to treating length\ncontraction as explained by geometric features of space-time, rather\nthan by a dynamically occurring process. This, as we see below, will\nrequire us to postulate an unexplained brute fact as to why length\ncontraction and time dilation appear in laws governing all matter.\nSince unexplained coincidences, or treating certain facts as\n“brute”, is suboptimal (particularly when, as Balashov\n& Janssen argue (2003: 341–2), the space-time interpretation\noffers a better explanation—one that does not treat Lorentz\ninvariance as brute or mysterious), so we ought to deny the\nneo-Lorentzian interpretation of relativity. \nLet’s try to get a better sense of this. What’s the brute\nfact required of us? And why should we worry about it? Why should we\nthink that the neo-Lorentzian theory, which is acknowledged to be\nempirically equivalent to STR (Balashov & Janssen 2003: 23;\nCallender 2008: 52–53), offers an inferior explanation of both\nlength contraction and time dilation than does STR? Janssen (2002)\nputs the point as follows: \nFor Einstein, the Lorentz-transformed quantities are the correctly\nmeasured real quantities. In the final version of Lorentz’s\ntheory, measurements never reveal the real quantities because all\nmeasurements are made with devices that are systematically distorted\nand improperly synchronized as a result of their and the\nobserver’s motion through the ether. (2002: 429) \nThus, where for Lorentz, “Lorentz-invariance” is a product\nof a law governing the dynamical behavior of entities in motion, for\nEinstein, Lorentz-invariance is simply a product of the geometry of\nspace-time. As Balashov & Janssen go on to argue: \nCompare the status of Lorentz invariance in the two interpretations.\nIn the former, Lorentz invariance reflects the structure of space-time\nposited by the theory. In the latter, Lorentz invariance is a property\naccidentally shared by all laws effectively governing systems in\nNewtonian space and time…In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation\nit is, in the final analysis, an unexplained coincidence that the laws\neffectively governing different sorts of matter all share the property\nof Lorentz invariance. (2003: 341) \nSo, here’s the detail of the objection. Lorentz’s theory\nwas born of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics\n(Janssen 2002: 423): the latter incorporated electric and magnetic\nfields, but made no pronouncements at all concerning other forms of\nmatter. Thus, although we can extend the Lorentzian theory to\nall laws governing matter, we have no reason to do so. It just happens\nto turn out that the laws governing matter all instantiate this\nproperty. Craig Callender (2008) makes the point clearly, as\nfollows: \nThe matter fields are Lorentz invariant but the space-time is not. For\nthis reason, all else being equal, one ought to prefer the Einstein\nMinkowski interpretation to the Lorentz interpretation. Positing\notherwise unnecessary unobservable structure—absolute\nsimultaneity—does violence to Ockham’s razor. (2008:\n53) \nCallender goes on to point out that once we grant that the Lorentz\ninterpretation is logically consistent and empirically adequate, the\nquestion becomes, “[w]hat are a few lost explanatory virtues in\ncontrast to _______ (fill in the blank with whatever tenses\nexplain)?” (2008: 53). After all, we have to posit an\nunobservable frame of reference and we don’t, typically, posit\nunobservables without good reason. At the moment, we lack good reason,\nunless we think that the motivations for presentism (e.g., those\ndescribed in\n §2)\n serve to persuade us that a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of the\nphysics of space-time is preferable to the space-time interpretation.\nUndermining thus looks to be a difficult road to plough. \nThe second option that Hawley (2006) describes,\n“Counterargument”, is as follows: \nThis alternative to Undermining accepts that the scientific\nmetaphysics is genuinely confirmed by the role it plays in generating\nempirical success, but claims that independent reasons to believe the\ntraditional metaphysics outweigh this scientific support. (2006:\n464) \nCounterargument is bold in the extreme. It seems to require that we\nsimply overturn the best physics on the basis of metaphysical\narguments. Perhaps we could take this line (but it seems a very\nchallenging route. The arguments for presentism (those stated in\n §2,\n for instance) look somewhat underpowered when it comes to delivering\nthat result. The way in which counterarguers have typically tried to\nproceed, then, is by giving independent motivations for rejecting the\nspecial theory of relativity (both Crisp 2008 and Monton 2006 may be\nread as doing this). Nonetheless, the orthodoxy remains strongly\nopposed to this kind of approach.","contact.mail":"david.ingram@york.ac.uk","contact.domain":"york.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2018-01-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/presentism/","author1":"David Ingram","author1.info":"http://www.jonathantallant.com/","entry":"presentism","body.text":"\n\n\nPresentism is the view that only present things exist (Hinchliff 1996:\n123; Crisp 2004: 15; Markosian 2004: 47–48).\nSo understood, presentism is an ontological doctrine; it’s a\nview about what exists (what there is), absolutely and unrestrictedly.\nThe view is the subject of extensive discussion in the literature,\nwith much of it focused on the problems that presentism allegedly\nfaces. Thus, much of the literature that frames the development of\npresentism has grown up either in formulating objections to the view\n(e.g., Sider 2001: 11–52), or in response to such objections\n(e.g., Bigelow 1996; Markosian 2004), with exceptions to this largely\ncoming via the ways in which presentism is motivated. This entry\nmirrors the structure of that literature, for the most part.\nHere’s the plan for what follows. We begin with a more detailed\nsketch of presentism, its commitments and motivations. Then we move to\nconsider several concerns that have been raised for presentists. We\nuse these to illustrate both the breadth and severity of the\nchallenges that presentism faces, as well as the range of different\nversions of presentism developed to help meet these challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a bare ontological thesis, presentism can be understood as\nP: \nP is a claim about what there is, absolutely and\nunrestrictedly. As a description of presentism, it’s both\northodox and minimal. To flesh it out, the view is often contrasted\nwith two other ontological theses: an opposing view of time,\neternalism (“past, present, and future things exist”), and\nan analogical view in modality, actualism (“only actual things\nexist”) (see, e.g., Adams 1986: 321; Hinchliff 1996:\n123–4; Sider 1999: 326, 2001: 11–12; Noonan 2013:\n219–20). Theodore Sider, for instance, neatly articulates this\napparent orthodoxy: \nPresentism is the doctrine that only the present is real. … A\npresentist thinks that everything is present; more generally, that,\nnecessarily, it is always true that everything is (then) present. \nPresentism is the temporal analogue of the modal doctrine of\nactualism, according to which everything is actual. The\nopposite view in the philosophy of modality is possibilism,\naccording to which nonactual things exist; its temporal analogue is\neternalism, according to which there are such things as\nmerely past and merely future entities. (1999: 325–6) \nPresentists and eternalists make competing claims about temporal\nontology. According to presentism, only present things exist.\nAccording to eternalism, past and future things, such as dinosaurs and\nhuman outposts on Mars, exist as well. These are theories about what\nthere is, just like actualism, possibilism, Platonism, nominalism,\nMeinongianism, idealism, materialism, theism, atheism… (2006:\n75) \nPresentists and the rest thus disagree about what exists. When\nconfronted with W.V. Quine’s (1948) three Anglo-Saxon\nmonosyllables—“What is there?”—presentists\nhave a simple and distinctive reply: “Only what’s\npresent”. Non-presentists demur. Eternalists say that there are\npast and future things too. Growing block theorists\n(“no-futurists”) say that there are past and present\nthings, but no future things. On the orthodox picture, what’s\ndistinctive about presentism is determined primarily by the distinct\nset of claims made about temporal ontology. \nThe ontological doctrine, P, requires\nsupplementation. Consider, for example, a possible world, w, at\nwhich the growing block theory of time is true. At the first moment of\nw, P is true. There exists only the first\nmoment and that moment is present; there are no other moments, and so\nthe past hasn’t yet come to exist. Later on, it will become\nclear that w isn’t a presentist world, even though it\nseems initially to satisfy P: at the first moment,\nonly present things exist. For this reason, when being more\nforthcoming with a definition of their view, moving beyond mere\nslogan, presentism might more perspicuously be rendered as a view that\nis always true, if true at all (Crisp 2003: 215, 2004: 19,\nfn.6, 2007: 107, n.1). So, presentism amounts to the claim that: \nAlong the modal dimension, presentism might be thought of as a view\nthat is necessarily true, if true at all (e.g., Hestevold\n& Carter 2002: 499; Markosian 2004: 47, fn.1; Ingram 2016: 2868).\nThus: \nHowever, although presentists sometimes make this move, there’s\nvery little discussion in the literature as to whether\nPAN is preferable to PA and, if so,\nwhat would justify that preference. In what follows, reflecting that\nlack of discussion, we remain neutral on which of PA\nor PAN is preferred. We follow the wider literature\nin typically stating presentism as P, rather than\nPA, though we take it that something at least as\nstrong as PA is intended. \nMore modifications may be required. First, strictly speaking, on this\ncharacterization, presentism is a thesis that denies the existence of\natemporal or timeless entities, that is, entities that\naren’t present (but aren’t past or future either). This\nappears to rule out the existence of abstract entities. [See the entry\non\n abstract objects.]\n And this may be a step too far for some presentists. Hence, we might\nbe pressed to modify PA and restrict it to concrete\nobjects. We’re not forced to make that move, however, since\nPA only rules out abstracta qua timeless\nentities. Presentism is compatible with the existence of abstracta, so\nlong as such entities exist now (exist within time). In any case,\ntimeless abstracta are inconsistent with PA,\nbut (as is clear) this needn’t be of too much concern. It is\nunclear how much would be lost from the core of presentism if we\ncoupled PA to timeless abstracta. \nSecond, presentism isn’t merely the thesis that only present\nthings exist. This isn’t the full extent of the position.\nWithout qualification, P is consistent with the view\nthat reality is “static” (or “frozen”) and\nthat time doesn’t really pass. But reality isn’t that way;\nour reality is “dynamic”. Hence, a full and proper account\nof presentism requires more detail. Typically, presentism is thought\nto include the additional claim that various things have existed and\nthat others will exist: Julius Caesar, Marie Curie, and Amelia Earhart\nall existed, but exist no longer; and, though we exist, alongside\nTaylor Swift, Donald Trump, and you (dear reader), all of us will\ncease to exist at some future time(s), to be replaced by other things,\neach of which will go out of existence in their turn. Thus, presentism\ncommits us to there being a change in what exists over time, a change\nin what’s present. And, frequently (although not exclusively),\npresentists describe this change in terms of temporal\npassage—the passing of time—or, at least, as closely\nrelated to it. So, presentism can be understood as the following\nconjunction: \nFor those who state presentism explicitly in this way, see Price (2011: 277), Miller (2013: 346), and Leininger (2015: 726), amongst others. \nFurther, since presentism marks a difference between the present, on\none hand, and the past and future, on the other, it’s typical\n(although, again, not universal) to see presentism described as a\nversion of the “A theory” of time (e.g., Craig 2000;\nZimmerman 2008; Deasy 2017). Here we understand the “A\ntheory” as something like the union of the following two theses:\nthere are genuine, fundamental or “irreducible” properties\nof at least some of past, present and future (i.e., so-called “A\nqualities” or “A properties”); and, time passes (see\nthe entry on\n time,\n esp. §5). For recent explorations of presentism without the A\ntheory (or, without A qualities), see Rasmussen (2012) and Tallant (2012). \nThus far, our focus has been on saying what presentism is. And, as we\nsee it, we’ve reported faithfully what’s said typically\nabout the view in the contemporary literature. But the recent history\nof the view, presentism in the earlier parts of the\n20th century, is a little less clear. As far as we know,\nRobert Adams is the first to use the name “presentism” in\nprint (in 1986), though he implies that he isn’t the first to\nname it—he writes:  \n[a] reduction is offered by a view that is sometimes called\n“presentism” by analogy with “actualism”.\n(1986: 321)  \nBefore 1986, matters are unclear. Many (rightly) point to Arthur Prior\nas an important and historically significant adherent of presentism.\nWe agree that Prior endorses the presentist’s ontological\nthesis, P—he writes:  \nthe present simply is the real considered in relation to two\nspecies of unreality, namely the past and the future. (1970: 245)  \nBut we think that it’s less obvious that Prior’s complete\nview on time is presentism, as above (see e.g., Fine 1977,\nButterfield 1983 and Le Poidevin 1991: 36–40). [For detail on\nPrior’s life and work, see the entry on\n Arthur Prior.]\n There are others after Prior, but before Adams (1986) or Hinchliff\n(1988), who also appear to endorse P, such\nas Richard Routley (1980). Similarly, we take no stand here on whether\nsuch philosophers are presentists. \nThis concludes our opening sketch. Presentism is the view that only\npresent things exist and what’s present changes (i.e., things\nchange, time passes); and, it’s an A theory of time. Now, why\nbelieve it? \nThe most frequently cited reason given for endorsing\npresentism—or, at least, treating it as worthy of serious\ncritical consideration—trades upon some variant of the claim\nthat it’s the “intuitive” or “common\nsense” view of time (e.g., Bigelow 1996: 36; Sider 2001: 11;\nMarkosian 2004: 48; De Clercq 2006: 386; Tallant 2009b: 407). Many\nfriends agree, and more than a few foes concede, that there’s\nsomething compelling about the idea that present things really exist,\nwhilst past and future things don’t exist. Some who look to\ndefend presentism will rest there with the bare claim that presentism\nis intuitive (etc.) and that this gives us reason to think that\nit’s true. \nOne way to proceed is to extend this idea. Begin with the intuition\nthat there’s something special about the\npresent—something distinctive. This seems attractive enough. But\nhow might we capture it in our metaphysical model of time? One way to\ndo it is to assert that present things are the only things that exist, that is,\nto endorse the presentist’s ontic thesis. Certainly, this\nmarks the present as distinctive. And, to the extent that we wish to\ncapture and preserve the idea that the present is\n“special” (in some sense), so presentism fares well\nagainst this measure. But, of course, any model that\nprivileges the present in some way will fare well against the same\nmeasure. So, for this argument to fully motivate presentism, further\nargument must be given for thinking that these other rival views\ndon’t come up to scratch. \nAnother way to motivate presentism is via appeal to experience. To\nborrow a famous example, consider a headache (e.g., Zimmerman 1998:\n212). If a headache exists, it hurts. It can’t exist and fail to\nhurt. Now, suppose that we endorse the existence of the past (and deny\npresentism). Past headaches exist. But they don’t hurt (at\nleast, so goes the claim). If headaches from hangovers last year hurt\nus, neither author would be in a position to write this, so severe\nwould be the pain. Since headaches must hurt, if they\nexist—it’s part of their essence to do so—past\nheadaches cannot exist. This goes for the future headaches as well.\nThus, presentism is true. (For the classic statement of the\n“thank goodness that’s over” argument, in favor of A\ntheories of time, see A.N. Prior 1959. The wider literature is\nvoluminous. Representative recent works include: Suhler &\nCallender 2012, Hoerl 2015, and Pearson forthcoming.) \nThere are different examples that draw on our experience of pain and\nour attitude towards it. Consider again a past headache and compare it\nto a (possible) future headache, something that may result from over\nenthusiastic behavior in the bar this evening. A future headache is\nsomething that worries us. It influences our behavior. We seek to\navoid it. We may even fear it. By contrast, we feel differently about\na past headache (and past pains, generally). We don’t fear past\npains. They don’t worry us in quite the same way. One\nexplanation for this is that a past pain doesn’t exist. And\nwhilst a future pain doesn’t exist either, we know that it will\ndo so if we behave in such-and-such a way. It’s the potential\nfor that headache to exist (to come into being) that causes us to\nmodify our behavior. We wish to avoid that state. But if we think that\npast and future things exist, we cannot appeal to the explanation just\ngiven, for if the past headache exists, presumably we should fear it\nor worry about it, just as we should if a future headache exists. \nLast, but not least, we might motivate presentism by appealing to\nontological parsimony (e.g., Bourne 2006: 68–69). Suppose that we endorse something like “Ockham’s\nrazor”, viz. the principle that one shouldn’t\nmultiply entities beyond necessity (see the entry on\n simplicity,\n esp. §2). By asserting that only present things exist, by not\npositing the existence of any non-present things, the\npresentist’s ontology is more parsimonious than the ontology of\ntheir opponents (growing block theorists posit the existence of past\nand present things, eternalists posit the existence of past, present,\nand future things, etc.). All things being equal, we have at least a\ndefeasible preference for presentism over its rivals, if we have a\ntaste for ontological desert landscapes. \nThere are a number of complications with this way of motivating\npresentism. For one thing, although it’s typical (in\nmetaphysics) to see appeals to parsimony in cases where one view is\nmore “qualitatively” parsimonious than its\nrivals, that is, cases where a view posits fewer kinds of thing\nthan opposing views, it’s far less typical to see appeals in\ncases where one view is merely more\n“quantitatively” parsimonious than rivals, that is,\ncases where a view posits fewer things than another. The fact that\nappeals to quantitative parsimony are less typical reflects a general\nattitude that the only ontological parsimony that one ought to respect\nis qualitative parsimony. As David Lewis famously puts it: \nI subscribe to the general view that qualitative parsimony is good in\na philosophical or empirical hypothesis; but I recognize no\npresumption whatever in favor of quantitative parsimony (1973: 87) \nNow, it seems that if presentism is to be motivated by appeal to\nparsimony, then it must be motivated by appeal to considerations of\nquantitative parsimony. Presentism and eternalism don’t\ndisagree about the kinds of things that exist. Both\npresentists and non-presentists tend to agree on the metaphysical\nkinds (or “ontological categories”) that exist. What they\ndisagree about is the temporal location of the things that exist.\nPresentism states that everything exists at the present time;\neternalism states that there are things that exist at other times. If\npresentism is to be motivated in this way then we must justify a\npreference for quantitative parsimony in this case in the face of the\northodoxy that Lewis expresses. (See Tallant 2013b for an attempt to\ndeliver this sort of argument for presentism.) \nAt the outset, we noted that presentism has been formulated,\ndeveloped, and modified in response to a range of objections. In what\nremains of this entry, we consider what we take to be the most\nprominent and well-developed of these objections and explain how\npresentists have tried to respond (§§3–8). \nConsider the following minimal statement of presentism, viz.\nthe ontological thesis, P: \nThere is a concern with P, understood as a statement\nof presentism, arguing that the use of the verb “exist” is\nambiguous in a problematic way. The idea is that, once\nP is disambiguated properly, presentism is either\ntrivially true (but consistent with some non-presentist views) or else\nfalse. P admits of three apparently distinct\nreadings: \nThe highlighted portions indicate a putative disambiguation of\n“exist”. Opponents insist that these are the only\navailable readings of P and press the following\nargument: \nFor statements of this argument, see Crisp (2004: 17) and\nLudlow (2004: 22). For discussion of the (so-called)\n“sceptical” challenge, in a variety of forms, see Merricks (1995: 523, 1999: 421–2), Zimmerman (1998:\n209–10), Lombard (1999: 254–5, 2010), Sider (1999:\n325–7, 2006), Callender (2000: S588–90), Rea (2003), Meyer\n(2005, 2013), Savitt (2006), Stoneham (2009), Mozersky (2011:\n122–5), Torrengo (2012, 2016), Miller (2013: 348–51),\nTallant (2014) and Deng (forthcoming). \nThe argument (1)–(5) is valid. But why think that it’s\nsound? Well, premise (2) is clearly true. The claim that “only\npresent things exist now” amounts to the claim that “only\npresently existing things presently exist”. Whilst we\nshouldn’t disagree with this claim, it’s a mere triviality\nand cannot be used to advance a distinctive position in the philosophy\nof time. Moreover, P1 is consistent with\nthe existence of non-present things, contrary to the spirit of\npresentism. For example, Marie Curie isn’t a present\nentity—she doesn’t exist now—but she can exist (in\nthe past) without contradicting P1. Hence,\nP1 isn’t an adequate statement of\npresentism, regardless of its status as a truism. \nWhat about premises (3) and (4)? The standard justification for (3) is\nthat P2 is false because it’s open\nto counterexamples. The standard justification for (4) is that\nP3 collapses into\nP2. Both are controversial. We take each\nin turn. \nThe claim that we explore here is that: “only present things\nhave existed, exist now, or will exist”\n(P2) is false because some non-present\nthings have existed. For example, Marie Curie isn’t a present\nthing, but she has existed. This appears to be a counterexample to\nP2. \nOne might reply here that P2 isn’t\nfalse (for the reason just given) because there are no\nnon-present entities—presentists don’t think that there\nis something, Curie, that exists and isn’t present. To\nwork through the details here, it’s important to start talking\nabout what presentists accept in the domain of their most unrestricted\nquantifiers. That is, P2 isn’t false\nbecause there are no non-present entities in the relevant domain of\nquantification. Suppose that we read P2 in\nthe following way: “for any x, if x has existed,\nexists now, or will exist, then x is present”. And,\nfollowing Thomas Crisp (2004), presentists may read the quantifier\n“for any…” as “for any… within\ntime” (depending on views about the existence of timeless\nentities). If we shift to this reading, it’s no longer obvious\nthat P2 is false. It’s true that\nthere once was an entity, Marie Curie, who doesn’t exist at all\nanymore. But it’s not clear that Curie must be within the\nrelevant domain of quantification simply in virtue of having once\nexisted. So, if we read P2 as “for\nany x (within time), if x has existed, exists now, or\nwill exist, then x is present”—and we deny that\nthere are any non-present entities—then\nP2 isn’t false (cf. Crisp 2004:\n18–20). And, if P2 isn’t\nfalse, then premise (3) is false and the argument is\nunsound. \nOf course, whether one thinks that this kind of strategy is successful\nwill likely depend upon how one understands the locution “for\nany x”. Not everyone is likely to be persuaded. For\ninstance, Ulrich Meyer (2005: 214, 2013: 68–69), when advancing\nhis own “sceptical” challenge to presentism, considers a\nstatement of presentism that’s very similar to the reading of\nP2 offered by Crisp (2004), in which the\nstatement of presentism is equivalent to the claim that “only\npresent entities exist temporally”. (On the assumption that\n“x exists within time” and “x exists\ntemporally” are the very same notion, the two statements are\nequivalent.) However, Meyer argues that it’s clear enough that\nCurie exists temporally. After all, she has existed! And what can\n“x exists temporally” (or “x\nexists”) mean if not, simply, “x has existed,\nexists now, or will exist”? \nAssuming that the likes of Meyer are correct (and that the likes of\nCrisp are not), what should we make of premise (4)? What should we\nmake of the claim that: “only present entities exist\nsimpliciter” (P3) is false\nbecause P3 collapses into\nP2 (and P2 is\nfalse)? Perhaps we can argue that P3\ndoesn’t collapse into P2, and that\nP3 represents a distinct way to state the\npresentist’s ontic thesis. A defender of\nP3 might argue that there’s a notion\nof “existence simpliciter” that’s\nintelligible, substantive and, importantly, distinct from the\n“tensed” (“temporal”) notion of existence\nthat’s captured in P2 (i.e.,\n“has existed, exists now, or will exist”). \nOnce again, there’s clear and sustained disagreement about the\neffectiveness of this strategy. Suppose that we can insist sensibly\nthat there’s a notion of “existence\nsimpliciter” that helps presentism to avoid the\nchallenge that P3 collapses into\nP2. (If this is so, then our opponent\ncan’t tell us, simply, that P3 is\nfalse if P2 is false.) Nevertheless, this\nraises the question as to what, precisely, is meant by “x\nexists simpliciter” and whether the new notion can be\nused to characterize presentism. \nWhat does “x exists simpliciter” mean? In\nthis context, Meyer (2005: 214–5) tells us that if x\nexists simpliciter, then x exists either in the actual\nworld @, or else in some merely possible world. And, if x\nexists in @, then it exists in time, it exists\ntemporally; x either has existed, exists now, or will\nexist. Thus, it seems that if we specify the meaning of\n“x exists simpliciter”, we must take it to\nmean either that x exists “outside time”, but\nsomehow still in @, or else at some other world. But, perhaps\ncontroversially, Meyer (2005: 215) argues that neither of these ways\nof specifying the notion of “existence\nsimpliciter” will give us a characterization of\npresentism, qua model of time. Presentism is a view about\nwhat exists in time; it’s not a thesis about what exists outside\nof time, nor is it a thesis about what exists at other possible\nworlds. (Recall, from the discussion of the implications of\nPA, above, that nothing exists outside time, for\npresentists; nothing exists that isn’t present. Hence,\npresentism concerns what exists within time since it implies\nthat nothing exists without.) \nIt’s only fair to conclude this part of the discussion by noting\nthat it’s unclear how far we should be moved by these\nconsiderations. For instance, Daniel Deasy (2017) is clear that he\nthinks very little of this objection. Deasy discusses the objection\n(to presentism, defined as “always, everything is\npresent”), somewhat witheringly, as follows: \n[Some argue along the following lines:] the quantifier in the\ntraditional definition is either tensed or tenseless. If it is tensed\nthen presentism is the obviously false thesis that always, everything\nis now present. If it is tenseless then presentism is the trivially\ntrue thesis that always, everything is, was, or will be present.\n… The problem with this argument is that the key\npremise—that the quantifier in the traditional definition is\neither tensed or tenseless—is false. The universal quantifier in\nthe traditional definition (“everything”) should be read\nas expressing exactly the universal quantifier of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic … [The] traditional definition is\nintended to express a metaphysical thesis, and metaphysical theses\nought to be expressed in the most metaphysically\nperspicuous—i.e., most “joint carving”—terms\npossible. Classical first-order predicate logic is a much better\ncandidate for a language whose terms so cut than a natural language\nlike English. Moreover, the standard quantifiers of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic are neither “tensed” nor\n“tenseless” (or at least, not in the sense of the above\nargument). … [Quantifiers] are not verbs, they are quantifiers\n… Therefore there is no good reason to think the quantifiers\nhave either reading. (2017: 380–1) \nHowever, presentists shouldn’t celebrate too early. They should\nremain cautious. Deasy goes on to raise an independent concern with\nhow to define presentism. Echoing Timothy Williamson (2013:\n24–25), Deasy objects that there’s no satisfactory way to\nspell out what’s meant by “is present” in the\ndefinition of presentism. \nAs we’ve seen, standard ways of characterizing presentism face\nan array of definitional worries. So let’s change tack for a\nmoment. Presentism is the view that only present things exist. But it\nmight seem natural to suppose there’s more to presentism than a\nclaim about the extent of our ontological commitments. That is,\npresentism shouldn’t just be seen as a list of which objects\nexist (the present ones), but a claim about existence itself. Dean\nZimmerman (1996), for example,\ncharacterizes presentism as the view that “to be present\njust is to be real or to exist” (1996: 117). When presentism is\ncharacterized in this way, we can label it “Existence\nPresentism”, following Jonathan Tallant (2014). \nTrenton Merricks gives a more thorough expression of this picture, as\nfollows: \n[Standard] definitions, even though they get at something important,\nfail to get at what separates presentism most fundamentally from\neternalism. … [Presentism] and eternalism differ most\nfundamentally with respect to the nature of time and, relatedly, with\nrespect to what it is to exist at a time (and to have properties at a\ntime). (2007: 119–20) \nPresentists and eternalists alike say that those things that exist at\nthe present time really do exist and, moreover, that properties had at\nthe present time really are had. Thus one might think that, while\npresentism and eternalism part ways with respect to other times, they\nagree about the nature of the present time and, relatedly, agree about\nwhat it is to exist (and have properties) at the present time. But\nthey do not agree about these things. Indeed, their differences with\nrespect to the nature of, and existence at, the present time are as\nimportant as their differences with respect to the past and the\nfuture. (2007: 123) \n[Presentists] insist that there are objects that exist at the\npresent time (or, equivalently, that presently exist).\nSince they do not believe in a region called the “present\ntime”, presentists cannot reduce existing at the present\ntime to being located at that region. I think presentists should,\ninstead, say that existing at the present time just is\nexisting. Thus, given presentism, if something exists, then,\nobviously enough, it exists at the present time. So, given presentism,\nsince everything exists, everything exists at the present time. This\nis what is right about the standard definitions of presentism. (2007:\n125) \nThis way of characterizing presentism challenges the orthodoxy,\nsketched above (in\n §1),\n which takes the main difference between presentism and rival models\n(eternalism, etc.) to be their distinct ontological commitments. On\nthis revised way of thinking, such ontological disagreements are a\nconsequence of the view, rather than what’s truly distinctive\nabout it. Instead, what’s crucial to presentism is a claim about\nthe nature of what it is to exist. To exist is to be\npresent. \nHow, if at all, does this way of thinking about presentism help with\nthe definitional worries? Supposedly, this move helps us to identify a\nnew kind of disagreement between presentists and non-presentists.\nPresentists can endorse an identity claim of the form “existing\nat the present time is identical to existing” and thus draw new\nbattle lines. This identity claim is present tensed and it’s\ntrue now; it doesn’t face the same worries as the other\nstatements of presentism (P1,\nP2, or P3).\nNonetheless, the claim is distinctive; it’s not something to\nwhich eternalists can assent. Eternalists don’t agree that\nexisting now is existing. \nPrima facie, there are myriad “cross-temporal”\nrelations. We admire Marie Curie; admiration is a relation.\nYesterday’s rain caused today’s flood; causation is a\nrelation. There are other kinds of relation, which we discuss below,\nsuch as directly referring and truth-making, which seem like they\ncross times (and as if they might cause special trouble for\npresentism). For now though we want to consider the point very\ngenerally. Presentism is not compatible with the existence of Marie\nCurie or yesterday’s rainfall; we presentism denies the\nexistence of all past entities. Nonetheless, what we have here with\nadmiration and causation seems to be a relation. It’s very\nnatural and very reasonable to suppose that a relation can only be\ninstantiated if all of its relata exist: x cannot stand in a\nrelation R to y unless both x and y exist. If that’s\nright, then there’s an obvious worry. Presentism seems flat out\nincompatible with the existence of any and all cross-temporal\nrelations. Something must give. \nA famous statement of this “argument from relations” is\ndue to John Bigelow (1996). It goes as follows: \n…in order for a relation to hold between two things, both of\nthose two things will have to exist. Call this the principle that all\nrelations are existence entailing. Add as a further premise the\nsupposition that relations sometimes hold between a present thing and\nsomething else which is not present. The conclusion follows\nineluctably, that some things exist which are not present. (1996:\n37) \nBigelow suggests that this argument goes as far back as the Stoics and\nthe Epicureans. Here we focus on contemporary iterations of the\nproblem. For recent discussion of the problem, in a variety of forms,\nsee Adams (1986: 321–8), Quine (1987: 197–8),\nChisholm (1990a,b), Bigelow (1996), Sider (1999, 2001: 25–35),\nCraig (2000: 211–2), Davidson (2003), Markosian (2004), Crisp\n(2005), Brogaard (2006, 2013), De Clercq (2006), Torrengo (2006,\n2010), Inman (2012), and Ciuni & Torrengo (2013). For a\nsubstantial, book-length treatment of the issue, see Torrengo\n(2008). \nQuite generally, presentism can be defended via one of a few\nstrategies to address this worry about “cross-time”\nrelations. One option: to use presently existing entities to make\nsense of the relational claims. With our admiration of Marie Curie,\nfor example, this amounts to saying that: when she existed, Curie\ninstantiated various features and properties, those properties still\nexist, and it’s those present properties that we’re\nrelated to in admiration. Thus, it’s not Curie herself that we\nadmire, but her perseverance, insight and brilliance. Of course, one\nimportant issue with this strategy is that it fails to respect the\nidea that it’s Curie herself that we admire, rather than mere\nproperties that she exemplified. Alternatively, then, alongside\ndefending presentism we might deny that some or all relations are\n“existence-entailing”. Thus, we can stand in the relation\nof admiration to Marie Curie herself, even though there’s no\nsuch entity as Curie. But here we would face the difficult task of\ndenying the natural and reasonable supposition that a relation can\nonly be instantiated if all of its relata exist. Presentists who go\nthis route deny “serious presentism” and start down the\nroad towards Meinongianism, a position which many find quite\nundesirable (see the entry on\n nonexistent objects,\n esp. §4). Serious presentism is the temporal analogue of\n“serious actualism”, the view that “necessarily, if\nx has F or bears R, then x\nexists” (see the entry on\n actualism,\n esp. §2.2). (We remain neutral on the question of whether\npresentism implies serious presentism, pace Bergmann 1999,\nDavidson 2000, and leave the\n“non-serious” option open to presentists.) There’s\nat least one more option open: to say that such seeming cases of\nrelations aren’t, in fact, relational at all. Thus, rather than\nour admiration of Curie being a state that consists in Curie existing,\nour existing, and our bearing a relation to Curie, all that there is\nto such a state is our existing and instantiating a monadic property, admiring Marie Curie. Since the property is monadic,\nits instantiation requires only our existence. \nUnsurprisingly, there are questions about the advisability of each\nstrategy, in general, as well as about whether each can be pursued or\napplied sensibly in defense of presentism. Nonetheless, with the above\ngeneral overview in hand, we now turn our attention to two\nphilosophical problems that confront presentism: the problem of\nreference to non-present entities (§5) and the\n“truth-maker” problem\n (§6).\n Both are specific instances of our main objection, introduced above,\nand both present special problems for presentists. (The well-informed\nreader will note that we haven’t yet mentioned explicitly\nproblems concerning quantification across times or metric tensed\nstatements. We consider both as part of\n §6.) \nLet’s begin by noting that Socrates was a wise, snub-nosed\nphilosopher, who happened to be Plato’s finest teacher. From\nthis story, we can infer that “Socrates was wise” is true\nand, we might reasonably suppose, it expresses a (true) proposition,\n<Socrates was wise>. Similarly, we can take it that\n“Plato’s finest teacher was wise” is also true and\nit expresses a (true) proposition, <Plato’s finest\nteacher was wise>. [See the entry on\n propositions.] \nSome preliminary observations. Both propositions exist; they are true\nand so they must exist in order to be true. (Assuming something like\n“serious actualism”, see above.) Equally, both\npropositions are about the very same individual, Socrates, though\nthere’s a sense in which <Socrates was wise> is about\nSocrates more thoroughly (more intimately) than <Plato’s\nfinest teacher was wise> is about him. Indeed, it seems that\n<Socrates was wise> is “directly” about Socrates,\nwhereas <Plato’s finest teacher was wise> is only\n“indirectly” about him. <Socrates was wise> cannot\nfail to be about Socrates; it determines Socrates, the same\nindividual, in all possible contexts. But, by contrast,\n<Plato’s finest teacher was wise> is about Socrates only\naccidentally, only in virtue of the contingent fact that\nSocrates was Plato’s finest teacher. \nFurther, note that the sentence “Socrates was wise”, which\nexpresses <Socrates was wise>, contains a proper name\n(“Socrates”). And, suppose that this directly refers to\nSocrates. By contrast, “Plato’s finest teacher was\nwise”, which expresses <Plato’s finest teacher was\nwise>, contains a description (“Plato’s finest\nteacher”). We might suppose that this doesn’t directly\nrefer to Socrates, nor does it determine him in all possible contexts.\nConsider, for example, the possible scenario in which Socrates never\nencountered Plato. In this context, Plato’s finest teacher would\nhave been a distinct individual and the corresponding description\n“Plato’s finest teacher” would pick out that\nindividual. As such, <Plato’s finest teacher was wise>\nwould not be about Socrates and the truth of the proposition\nwouldn’t depend upon any facts about him. What unites both cases\nis reference; what divides them is the direct or indirect character of\nhow the expressions refer. Typically, reference is construed as a\nrelation that obtains between language and reality (between linguistic\nitems and things in the world). [See the entry on\n reference.]\n And, again: for two things to be so related, both things (both\nrelata) must exist. \nIn defending presentism we thus face a problem of direct reference\nwith respect to merely past entities. (Although, on one reading,\nit’s merely an instance of the general problem of\n“cross-time relations”, introduced above, in\n §4.)\n It seems that we can and do refer successfully to entities that have\nexisted and exist no longer, entities that don’t exist at all,\ngiven presentism. But, if this is so, then the past entities that we\nrefer to (and which are related to our linguistic items) must exist,\ncontrary to presentism. Presentists face a difficult choice. That is,\nthey must reject one of the following four claims, which form an\napparently inconsistent set: (i) we successfully refer to merely past\nentities, (ii) reference is a relation, (iii) for a relation to\nobtain, the relata must exist, and (iv) there are no merely past\nentities (i.e., past entities don’t exist). Presentists\ncan’t deny (iv), since that amounts to a rejection of\npresentism. But it proves almost equally difficult to reject any of\nthe other claims, given their independent plausibility. \nLet’s move away from the issue of reference, specifically, and\nturn to the metaphysics of propositions. First, note that <Socrates\nwas wise> is a “singular” proposition: a proposition\nthat’s directly about some individual, Socrates, whereas\n<Plato’s finest teacher was wise> is a\n“particularised” proposition: a proposition that’s\nabout Socrates, but not directly about them. [See the entry on\n singular propositions.]\n Frequently, propositions are taken to be complex metaphysical\nentities, entities with constituents and structure. [See the entry on\n structured propositions.]\n On this way of thinking, singular propositions are understood\ntypically as constituted by individuals, specifically the individuals\nthat they are (directly) about. Hence, a singular proposition about\nsome, x, is constituted by x itself. By contrast,\nparticularised propositions aren’t constituted by individuals,\nalthough they are structured entities with constituents. A\nparticularised proposition about x isn’t constituted by\nx, but may be constituted by a property of x. On this\nview, <Socrates was wise>, for example, is constituted by Socrates\nhimself, whereas <Plato’s finest teacher was wise>\nisn’t constituted by Socrates—but, perhaps, the\nproposition is constituted by some actual accidental property of\nSocrates, being the finest teacher of Plato or, indeed,\nhaving been the finest teacher of Plato. This way of thinking\nabout (singular) propositions isn’t universal, but it’s\npart of a standard theory with many adherents (see Adams 1986;\nWilliamson 2002; King 2007). \nIf propositions are complex (structured) entities with constituents,\nthen they depend for their existence upon the existence of their\npropositional constituents. The way that such entities ontologically\ndepend upon constituents is analogous to the way that sets depend upon\ntheir members. Consider, for example, {x}, x’s singleton\nset. {x} depends upon x for its existence. Typically,\nthis is cashed out as follows: necessarily, {x} exists only if\nx exists; and, it’s not the case that x exists\nonly if {x} exists. Similarly, we say: necessarily, some\nproposition P exists only if its (propositional) constituent\nc exist; and, it’s not the case that c exists only\nif P exists. [See the entry on\n ontological dependence.] \nPresentism faces a problem about how to account for the existence of\nsingular propositions about past entities. It seems that there are\nsuch propositions; recall that “Socrates was wise”\nexpresses a true singular proposition, <Socrates was wise>,\nwhich must exist in order to be true. The problem arises given a\nstandard treatment of singular propositions; that is, a proposition\nthat’s directly about an individual x is constituted by\nx itself, and propositions depend for their existence upon the\nexistence of their constituents. So, for example, <Socrates was wise>\nis constituted by Socrates himself and this proposition ontologically\ndepends upon Socrates. \nHere’s a deductively valid argument against presentism, based on\nthe above considerations: \nThe argument is clearly valid. To defend presentism, we must deny one\nof the premises. But each premise appears independently plausible. (1)\ntakes truth to be a monadic property, e.g., being true, and\nreflects a commitment to serious actualism: if P instantiates\nbeing true, then P exists. (2) takes propositions as\ntruth-bearers (or “truth-value bearers”) and follows from\nthe simple claim that there are truths about the past (more on this\nbelow, in\n §6).\n (4) takes propositions as complex entities and reflects a commitment\nto the principle that a complex depends for its existence upon things\nthat constitute it. The remaining premises, (5) and (7), follow\nstraightforwardly from the two metaphysical theses at issue, the\nstandard view of propositions and presentism, respectively. \nThe most obvious line of response (if we wish to avoid rejecting too\nmany plausible premises) is to deny some aspect of the standard view\nof propositions. Here we see a moderate and an extreme reply: a\nmoderate suggests a modification of the standard view (e.g., Ingram\n2016), an extremist suggests a total rejection of it\n(e.g., Merricks 2012). Moderates accept that propositions are\nstructured entities with constituents, but urge that the propositional\nconstituents are presently existing entities, and not any non-existent\npast entities. Extremists deny that propositions are structured\nentities and, instead, suggest a distinct treatment of\npropositions. \nFor another line of response, presentism might be modified à\nla Williamson (1998, 2002), who defends a view according to which\npast objects still exist, but are no longer concrete. We don’t\ntake a stand on whether such a position deserves the epithet\n“presentism” and, further, we note that Williamson (2013:\n20) explicitly states that he would prefer to see the debate between\npresentists and others recast in other terms, using a different\nmethodology. Nonetheless, it is clear enough that if the existence of\nabstract-Socrates (who once was concrete but now is abstract) is\ncompatible with presentism, then this would give the presentist a\nmeans to deny (7) and reject the argument given above. \nFor discussion of the above problem, in a variety of forms (i.e.,\nconcerning direct reference or singular propositions), see Adams\n(1986: 315–22), Fitch (1994), Markosian (2004), Merricks (2012:\n64–67, 2015: 170–3), and Ingram (2016).\nThere’s a modal analogue of this problem, facing actualism\n(roughly, the view that “only actual things exist”), and a\nrich literature accompanying it. For discussion of this problem, see\nAdams (1981), Plantinga (1983), Barcan Marcus (1985), Fine (1985),\nDavidson (2000), Merricks (2012: 64–71, 2015: 173–80), and\nSpeaks (2012). \nA good deal of work on presentism in the philosophy of time concerns\nitself with truth. In the current context, the work in question\nfocuses on whether (and, if so, how) presentism can account for the\ndifferent kinds of true proposition that we endorse. Our primary focus\nwill be on how to defend presentism whilst giving appropriate\nontological explanations for the truth of true claims about merely\npast things (with the “truth-making” literature as the\nbackground). We also briefly address a related problem of truths about\nspans of time (sometimes treated as a separate issue concerning\nquantification over times). \nNow we turn to one of the most discussed challenges to presentism in\nthe contemporary debate: the (so-called) “truth-maker”\nobjection to presentism. At first pass, this objection is another\ninstance of the general problem of cross-temporal relations\n (§4),\n but there are reasons for thinking that concerns about truth-makers\nunderwrite a special problem for presentists. This objection is\ntreated as a significant problem for presentism by many, including but\nnot limited to: Sider (2001: 35–42), Armstrong (2004:\n145–50), Keller (2004), Crisp (2007), Cameron\n(2011), Sanson & Caplan (2010), Markosian (2013), and Tallant &\nIngram (2015). For one\ngeneral discussion of the problem, see Caplan & Sanson (2011). [See the entry on\n truthmakers\n for background.] \nThe truth-maker objection is presented as a tension between three\nindependently plausible principles: (i) presentism, (ii) that there\nare (evidence-transcendent and objective) truths about the past, and\n(iii) truth-maker theory, the view that truths about the past are\n“made true” by some existent (see, e.g., Keller\n2004: 85–87; Cameron 2011: 55–57; Tallant & Ingram\n2015: 355, for this mode of presentation). Obviously, we cannot defend\npresentism and also abandon (i), and giving up on (ii) seems a steep\nprice to pay. If there are no truths about the past, then it’s\nhard to make sense of the idea that things change from one moment to\nthe next (or that time passes; see below,\n §7).\n That leaves us with (iii). Here, three options present themselves:\nlocate the required “truth-makers”; deny that truths about\nthe past require truth-makers; or, argue that truth-making isn’t\nthe kind of relation that requires the existence of both relata. We\nconsider these options in turn. \nIt’s worth noting, at the outset, that a version of the problem\ncan be stated with the principle that “truth supervenes upon\nbeing” in place of truth-maker theory, (iii), as in Kierland\n& Monton (2007). But it’s far more common to raise this\nspecific objection as a problem about a lack of truth-makers (rather\nthan the lack of an appropriate “subvenient base”). And so\nit’s the “truth-maker” objection, in particular,\nupon which we focus our attention. \nTruth-makers for truths about the past aren’t easy to find. We\nare searching for entities “in virtue of” which\npropositions about the past are true. For example, <Curie\nexisted> is true in virtue of some entity, its\n“truth-maker”. But what plays the truth-making role?\nSchematically, two kinds of solution can be given here: (i) posit\npresently existing truth-makers, or (ii) posit truth-makers that exist\n“outside time”. This second option is open to presentists\nwilling to countenance the existence of some atemporal\nentities (e.g., propositions, numbers, and so on). (Such a version of presentism\nwould require a defense the idea that entities that exist\noutside of time do no violence to the claim that “only\npresent things exist”.) \nPresentism can be amended via the addition of atemporal\ntruth-makers—truth-making entities that are, in a sense,\n“outside” time—see Bourne (2006) and Crisp (2007).\nThis is “ersatz presentism”. Ersatz presentism is the\nclaim that, for example, <Curie existed> is “made true” by\nan abstract time that represents how things were when Curie existed.\n(This is an “ersatz” abstract time, rather than a\n“genuine” concrete time.) One way to understand Ersatz\npresentism is as the view that there’s an abstract\nfour-dimensional manifold of times that represents how things were,\nare now, and will be. This manifold is ordered by an ersatz\nB-theoretic “earlier than” relation and forms an ersatz\nB-series of times. Here, the truth-makers for truths about the past\nare abstract entities: the ersatz times. An ersatz time, T,\nrepresents how things were (at some past time) by some other\nersatz time, T*, accurately representing how the concrete\nworld is now, and by T bearing the “earlier\nthan” relation (the “ersatz B-relation”) to\nT*. \nErsatz presentism is popular but the other position—the view\nthat we should posit presently existing\ntruth-makers—includes more variation. The most well-known\nversion of this view is “Lucretianism” espoused by John\nBigelow (1996). Lucretianism claims that <Curie existed> is made\ntrue by the world now instantiating a primitive past-tensed property\n(a “Lucretian” property) of having contained Marie Curie.\nHere the presently existing truth-maker is the present instantiation\nof the Lucretian property (having contained Curie) by the\nworld. There are a range of other “property solutions”,\nalongside Lucretianism, which differ in important respects but which\nshare a common core. For instance, see Keller (2004: 94–101) on a range\nof solutions, including one with indestructible atoms and their\nproperties, Cameron (2011, 2013) on temporal distributional\nproperties, McKinnon & Bigelow (2012) on tensing the instantiation\ntie, and Ingram (forthcoming) on uninstantiated thisnesses and their\nproperties, amongst others. \nResponses to the positions that posit presently existing truth-makers,\nsuch as Bigelow’s Lucretianism, along with the\n“Bigelow-style” property solutions (mentioned briefly),\neach seem to suffer from three distinct problems, perhaps only one of\nwhich afflicts the “ersatz presentist” proposal. We\nrehearse the problems facing presentism so-supplemented via these\nadditional truth-makers. \nFirst, note that any solution must ensure that the truth-makers\ndeliver the “right results” with respect to what’s\ntrue about the past. To illustrate, consider the following natural\nprogression of an object through time. Our story begins with a green\nbanana. Time passes and the banana ripens. The banana is now yellow,\nbut it was green. The world now instantiates the property having\ncontained a green banana (or so says the Lucretian). So far, so\ngood. But now consider the following progression, where the banana\nripens and yet the world comes to instantiate a different Lucretian\nproperty. Here the world instantiates the property having\ncontained a red banana, rather than having contained a green\nbanana. This progression is problematic. Witness: in the scenario\nimagined, though it was the case that the world contained a green\nbanana, <There was a green banana> is false; and, despite the\nworld never having contained a red banana, <There was a red\nbanana> is true. And, although the problematic progression\ndoesn’t appear at all likely, the worry with these\n“property” responses to the truth-maker objection is that\nthese kinds of progression appear possible, given the\nadvertised metaphysic. If such progressions are possible, they present\nan objection to these presently existing entities in fact being the\nright kind of truth-makers for truths about the past (see, e.g.,\nTallant & Ingram 2012; Cameron 2013; and Leininger 2015, for\ndiscussion of this sort of challenge). \nA second concern with “property solutions” stems from the\nworry that the kind of properties involved, for example, primitive tensed\n“Lucretian” properties, are wholly objectionable.\nProperties such as having contained dinosaurs seem, to many,\nto be “suspicious” or “dubious”\nentities—they are objectionable entities that shouldn’t be\ncountenanced in a respectable metaphysic. They are dubious and\nobjectionable because, in a sense that’s quite difficult to pin\ndown, they point beyond their instances (their bearers).\nThus, having contained dinosaurs is a property that\n“points beyond” how the world is now; it points\nbeyond the intrinsic nature of its bearer, and “points” to\nhow the world was; namely, containing dinosaurs. And, say the\nobjectors, acceptable properties aren’t like that; respectable\nproperties don’t point beyond (see, e.g., Sider 2001:\n39–42; Crisp 2007: 93–98; Merricks 2007: 134–6; and\nCameron 2011: 58–62, who each endorse versions of this\nchallenge, but see Tallant 2013a who argues that all such challenges\nmiss the mark in some way or other). \nAnother significant objection facing presentist attempts to solve the\ntruth-maker objection is based on “aboutness” intuitions\nand their role in determining which entity (or entities) is an\nadequate truth-maker for a particular truth. The idea goes as follows.\nA truth (any truth) is about something. If a proposition is made\ntrue—if a proposition “owes its truth” to something\nin the world—then the thing in the world that makes the\nproposition true should be what the truth is about (Merricks 2007:\n28–34). After all, <Taylor loves to sing>, for instance, is about\nTaylor and her love of singing. It would be altogether wrong for that\nproposition to be made true by the existence of anything other than\nTaylor and her love of singing. At least, so goes the thought. \nHowever, all these “solutions” to the truth-maker\nobjection share a common feature: the past entities that propositions\nabout the past seem to be about don’t exist, given\npresentism. Marie Curie doesn’t exist, yet <Curie existed>\nis about Curie. There are no dinosaurs, yet <there were\ndinosaurs> is about them. Our “aboutness”\nintuitions tell us that propositions about the past should be\nmade true by past entities, but they simply cannot be, given\npresentism. Whether the truth-makers we posit exist now, or\nexist outside time, the kind of entities that we posit won’t be\nup to the task. If we respect the aboutness constraint (on truth-maker\ntheory), and cannot shake off this objection, we will likely be\ninclined to give up on solving the objection by attempting to locate\nthe required truth-makers. (There are some exceptions. For example, Ingram\nforthcoming develops a Bigelow-style response and argues that the\nputative truth-makers, uninstantiated thisnesses, do satisfy aboutness\nintuitions.) \nThere’s time enough to mention briefly one additional\ncomplication. So far, we’ve focused on truths such as <Marie\nCurie existed> and <The banana was green>. But what about\n<Curie existed 100 years ago> or <The banana was green 3 days\nago>? Both include a “metric”, a term that\nspecifies a temporal interval or indicates some temporal distance. Now\nnote that since <Curie existed> is true now, it will always be\ntrue hereafter. Interestingly, however, the same isn’t true for\n<Curie existed 100 years ago>. (Curie ceased to exist in 1934.)\nHence, <Curie existed 100 years ago> will fail to be true in\n2035.) The same rules for tensed truths don’t apply to metric\ntensed truths, so we must find some way of accommodating them. Even\nso, it seems that presentists can say similar things in the case of\nmetric tensed truths as they do in the case of tensed truths. For example, take Bigelow’s Lucretianism and its putative truth-maker for\n<Curie existed>, viz. the present instantiation of a\ntensed (Lucretian) property of having contained Marie Curie by the\nworld. With a fairly simple modification, this view can deal with\n<Curie existed 100 years ago>. All that’s required is\nmetric tensed properties, such as the property of having contained Curie\n100 years ago. This is the sort of property that’s now\ninstantiated by the world (in 2017) but won’t be instantiated at\nsome point in the future (such as in 2035). So, the challenge from\nmetric tenses complicates matters but, at least on the surface, is far\nfrom insurmountable. \nRecall, the claims that generate the truth-maker objection: (i)\npresentism, (ii) there are truths about the past, and (iii)\ntruth-maker theory. The strategy just discussed, viz.\nlocating truth-makers for truths about the past, attempts to reconcile\nall three claims. But another strategy is to simply deny (iii), to\nassert that truths about the past don’t require\ntruth-makers. \nThis way of approaching matters has been mooted (e.g., Tallant 2009b),\nbut it hasn’t received a huge amount of support. This is due, at\nleast in part, to the fact that it’s only a partial response.\nIt’s all very well to deny that all truths require truth-makers,\nfor instance, and so deny that truths about the past require\ntruth-makers. It’s another thing altogether to explain what we\nshould say instead about truths about the past. And\nsurely something must be said, if we hope to account for\ntheir truth. We can’t say, simply, that truths about the past\nrequire no truth-makers and then say nothing more about what they\nrequire. And while we might look to replace a truth-maker theory with\nsomething less ontologically committing, presentists haven’t\nbeen forthcoming with an account of how truths get to be true, if not\nby some kind of truth-making account. \nAll of this leads us to the final option that we will consider here.\nNamely, that the truth-maker relation isn’t existence-entailing.\nThis kind of approach, described elsewhere as “nefarious”\n(contrasted with the “upstanding” project of locating\ntruth-makers), uses the language of truth-making without positing any\ntruth-makers for truths about the past. In presenting the nefarious\nstrategy, we can treat it as something like the union of two theses:\n(1) truths about the past are expressed using primitive (and\nunanalysable) tense operators; and, (2) the tense operators\ndon’t pick out a distinctive ontological category or aspect of\nreality. This sort of nefarious approach has been pursued recently by\nTallant (2009a), Sanson & Caplan (2010), and Baia (2012), amongst others. The labels\n(“nefarious” and “upstanding”) are due to a\nrecent discussion by Tallant & Ingram (2015). \nTo clarify: nefarious “cheats” (like Tallant) will say\n“<It was the case that p> is true, because it was the case\nthat p”. Here, the “was” is primitive and\nunanalysable. Notice, also, that those adopting this position will\nagree that this “was” doesn’t pick out any ontology;\nit doesn’t help us to speak of any distinctive metaphysical\ncategory. To that extent, those in this “nefarious” camp,\nwill agree that there are truths about the past, and will agree that\nhow the world was makes true how things are, but they deny\nthat the ensuing truth-maker “relation” (such as it is)\nbetween the past and the present (i.e., the true propositions) is\nexistence-entailing. For some, that might simply be considered\ntreacherous. How might presentists motivate the nefarious\nposition? \nOne key motivation involves a comparison with the\n“upstanding” approaches and the first problem we raised\nfor them, viz. getting the “right results”\n(discussed above). To be clear, if we think that there are\ntruth-makers, then we must ensure that the truth-making entities get\nthings right. That is, if the world contained a green banana, then it\nhad always better be true, any time after the fact, that a truth-maker\nexists for <There was a green banana> (rather than, say, a\ntruth-maker for <There was a red banana>, in the case where the\nworld never contained a red banana). But notice, then, that this seems\nto imply some kind of “fixing” relation; how the world\nwas (containing a green banana, not containing a red banana)\nserves to “fix” what truth-makers exist now.\nFixing is, plausibly, a relation. And, if x fixes y\nthen, intuitively, both x and y must exist; both relata\nof the fixing relation should exist. But, clearly, on the presentist\npicture, that’s not acceptable. Past things don’t exist\nand, in that case, the required “fixing” is a relation\nthat isn’t existence-entailing; it doesn’t require the\nexistence of both relata. And, if that’s right, then presentists\nmay as well “cut out the middleman” (so to speak) and\nsimply treat the truth-making relation as\n“non-existence-entailing” and so avoid any ontological\ninflation. Presentists don’t require ontological commitment to\nersatz times, Lucretian properties, etc., to serve as truth-makers for\ntruths about the past. They can do without. \nIs presentism out of the woods when it comes to the truth-maker\nobjection? It’s far from clear. We may, for instance, retain the\nworry that a relation (any relation) must be existence-entailing and\nthat what this shows is that we should give up on presentism (see,\ne.g., Baron 2013). And, even if we can solve the truth-maker\nobjection, there’s a closely related concern that looks like it\nwill raise further problems. (We discuss the related concern in what\nremains of this section.) \nIt’s true that there have been seven English Kings called\n“Edward”. Is presentism compatible with that claim? How\nshould we interpret the semantics? At no point in history were there\nall seven Kings; the Edwards weren’t contemporaneous. But, if\nthe Edwards didn’t all exist together, then how can <There\nhave been 7 English Kings called “Edward”> be true?\nPresentism faces a novel problem regarding truths about the past when\nsuch truths concern “spans” of time (see, e.g., Lewis\n2004). After all, the natural reading is false: it was the case that\n“there are 7 English Kings called\n‘Edward’”. \nTwo routes suggest themselves as plausible avenues to explore. The\nfirst is to try to make sense of talk of spans by using talk of\nindividual times. Following the literature, call these “slice\noperators”. The idea, then, is that we say that  \nIt WAS the case that [“<There is a King called\nEdward>, and it WAS the case that [<There is a King\ncalled Edward>, and….]]”  \nSomewhat loosely, we can describe this as analyzing the span in terms\nof the individual “slices” that would make it up, were\nsuch a thing as a “span” to exist. \nThere are many difficulties with this kind of approach. The most\nobvious challenge is that, in the above, the second iteration of our\ntense operator, “WAS” appears within the scope of the\nfirst. Thus, the attempted paraphrase of <There have been 7 English\nKings called “Edward”> is a sentence of the form\n“there has been a king called ‘Edward’, and there\nhad been a king called ‘Edward’…”. For one\nthing, however, suppose that there have been infinitely many entities\nin the past. Kings will not be a useful candidate here, so imagine\ninstead that there have been infinitely many electrons. Hence,\n<There have been infinitely many electrons> is true. But this\nrequires a construction with an infinite number of nested quantifiers\nand tense operators. This won’t do, for no such construction can\nbe generated, despite the fact that we clearly can utter a\nsentence that expresses the relevant proposition, “there have\nbeen infinitely many electrons”. \nAnother important problem for the translation approach is that there\nseem to be cases in which the paraphrase is false and yet the\nparaphrased sentence is true. Consider a merely possible case in which\nsome of the past Kings were instantaneous and simultaneous. (If this\nis too implausible in the case of Kings, given facts about royal\nsuccession, then swap the case for one involving fundamental physical\nparticles which can be instantaneous and simultaneous.) \nThe second route sees us endorsing a primitive “span”\noperator, an operator that picks out temporal intervals rather\nthan individual moments (cf. Lewis 2004: 12). Rather than try to\nanalyze the span in terms of slices, this approach sees us just\nendorsing a span operator as a primitive piece of terminology. Berit\nBrogaard (2007) introduces this strategy very neatly, as follows: \nWhere the usual slice operators mean (as the eternalist would put it)\n“at some past (or future) moment”, a span operator means\n“at some past (or future) interval” ([Lewis] 2004: 12).\nThus, where “it HAS been that” is the past-tense span\noperator, Lewis suggests that we translate “there have been two\nkings named Charles” as “it HAS been that (there are two\nkings named Charles)”. By eternalist lights, this means that\n“it is true of some interval in the past that there are two\nkings named Charles” ([Lewis] 2004: 12). The presentist, of\ncourse, cannot accept this translation, but must presumably treat span\noperators as primitives. (2007: 73) \nThere are also problems with this route. First, it seems that such\nspan operators introduce ambiguities. Let’s introduce the span\noperator “HAS” as the operator “it has been the case\nthat…” and consider a target sentence, “first it\nwas raining and then the sun shone”. Then, suppose that we\nparaphrase this as: “HAS (it is raining and the sun is\nshining)”. This is problematically ambiguous. The paraphrase\nmight mean that there has been an interval of time throughout which it\nhas both been the case that the sun has shone and it has rained. Or,\nit might mean that there is an interval of time, throughout a\nsub-interval of which the sun shone and throughout another\nsub-interval of which it rained. Clearly, we want the latter; but with\nHAS, at least as stated, we have no means of differentiating the two.\nIf the semantics of the span operator are ambiguous, then it\ndoesn’t give us a sensible semantics for span-talk. \nAs should be clear, merely solving the truth-maker objection\ndoesn’t automatically address this problem of spans. The\ntruth-maker objection rests upon the fact that presentists apparently\nlack the ontological resources required to accommodate truth-making.\nThe span objection rests upon the fact that, given presentism, it is\nfar from clear how to provide an adequate regimentation of the\nsemantics of ordinary language. Bringing together an adequate\nsemantics as well as an adequate ontology is no easy task. \nNext, we turn to an objection to presentism that concerns the idea\nthat time really passes. The challenge, put simply, is presentism\nisn’t compatible with this feature of reality. This is a problem\nsince presentism is a view that requires that reality is dynamic\n(i.e., not static) and that a change in what exists over time\nthat’s usually described in terms of the passage of time. (For\nthe purpose of this entry, we ignore general arguments to the\nconclusion that time doesn’t really pass and, instead, focus on\nspecific challenges to presentism concerning passage.) \nWhy think that presentism isn’t compatible with temporal\npassage? Well, begin with the fact that, typically, the passage of\ntime is expressed in the following terms: what’s future\napproaches the present, becoming less future, and what’s past\nrecedes from the present, becoming more past. Prima facie,\nthere’s a problem. What’s apparently required for the\ntruth of this passage metaphor is inconsistent with presentism; the\nview that only present things exist. There’s nothing that is\nfuture and so nothing to approach the present. Nor is there anything\nthat is past and so nothing to recede from the present. Hence, if we\nare to defend presentism then we have to suggest another way to\ninterpret the claim that time really passes. \nOne way to reinterpret the claim is as follows: there’s change\nin what exists over time. Put another way: what’s present\nchanges. But it’s unclear whether this solves the problem or\nshifts it down the road. What’s required in order to account for\nthe claim that “what”s present changes’? One might\nreasonably suppose that in order to assert that what’s present\nchanges, from one moment to the next, we require a difference in the\ncharacter of successive moments. But there are no such successive\nmoments, given presentism. There’s only the present moment and\nits contents. \nIn defense of presentism, we might insist that what exists\nnow is sufficient to account for the difference in character\nof successive present moments. Some of the strategies used in reply to\nobjections concerning cross-time relations and, in particular, the\n“truth-maker objection” (§§4–6) are useful\nhere. Consider, for example, ersatz presentists who posit abstract times, that is,\nmaximal consistent sets of tensed propositions that represent\nhow things are, but also how things were and will be, when the time is\npresent (when it’s “true”) (e.g., Markosian 2004; Bourne 2006; Crisp 2007). Ersatz presentism has the resources\nto assert that things really change (and so time really passes);\nthere’s a difference between the character of successive\nmoments, given the manifold of ersatz times. How things are, at the\n(concrete) present time, is different from how things were, as\nrepresented by an abstract time. Indeed, it seems that any version of\npresentism that posits presently existing entities to address worries\nabout cross-time relations, for instance, as putative “ontological\ngrounds” for truths about the past, can use such entities to\nestablish that there’s a difference between successive moments\nwithout reifying any non-present things. \nAt this point, however, a new question arises. So understood,\npresentism is giving us the resources to ground time’s passing,\nat, and only at, the present time. That is, everything required to\nestablish that things change from one moment to the next must be\ncontained within a single moment, the present. But within such a\nversion of presentism, what guarantees that things\nreally change? Or, to approach the same point in a different\nway, what in the metaphysics guarantees that the present resources\naccurately reflect how things were—for example, why think that\nthe ersatz manifold accurately represents the past—when\nthere’s no connection to the past? Why can’t reality\nconsist of a single “frozen” slice of concrete time, along\nwith the various ersatz-times? If reality really is that way\n(what’s concrete never changes and we have nothing more than a\nfrozen concrete instant against the backdrop of many ersatz times),\nthen we still have no temporal passage. What the presentist must do is\nfind some way of insisting that reality cannot be such; reality cannot\ninclude but a single concrete slice coupled to truth-makers for talk\nabout the past and future, where those truthmakers cannot be said to\nguarantee that things really change (compare with\nthe discussion of how truthmakers get the “right results”\nfrom §6). \nIn preceding sections, we examined problems facing presentism that\ncome from metaphysical quarters. In particular, we looked at a problem\nof “cross-temporal relations”\n (§4),\n and discussed two instances of that general problem, which pose\nspecial problems for presentism (§§5–6), before\nexamining a related challenge concerning temporal passage. Now, though\nthere are many worries for presentism that come from metaphysics,\nperhaps the most serious objection to presentism comes from physics.\nIn particular, the special theory of relativity (“STR”)\nhas been presented as in direct tension with presentism. [See the\nentry on\n being and becoming in modern physics.] \nSimon Saunders (2002) gives us a clear picture of how things\nsupposedly stand with respect to presentism and STR, as follows: \nAccording to presentism, all that is physically real is the\npresent—a system of physical events all of which are\nsimultaneous with each other. No other events are real. Precisely what\nthis system of events may be, now, as I snap my fingers, may not be\nknown to me; but there is a fact of the matter as to what it is, and\nit is a universal fact which embraces us all. It is an intersubjective\nreality—now, as a snap my fingers—and it is a reality\nwhich contains us only as an incidental part. But even if one knew all\nthat there is to know, consistent with special relativity, one would\nnot be able to say what this system of events might be. According to\npresentism, therefore, special relativity is radically deficient as a\ndescription of reality. It is blind to the sequencing of what is\nphysically real. (2002: 279–80) \nA quick and dirty reply on behalf of presentism is to suggest that\nmetaphysics and science are, in some sense, demarcated disciplines.\nThat is, the findings of physics are of no relevance to our best\nmetaphysics (and vice versa). But this doesn’t seem to be a move\nthat we should make. Both metaphysician and physicist are, surely,\ntrying to uncover the structure of the world and to theorize about the\nnature of reality (fundamental or otherwise). To ignore one another is\nno way for protagonists to carry on, when both aim at the same basic\ngoal. Of course, this means that we must say something in reply to\nSaunders and others, who raise the same sort of objection, for example,\nPutnam (1967), Stein (1968, 1970), Savitt (1994, 2000), Sider (2001:\n42–52), and Wüthrich (2013). But what can\nbe said? \nKatherine Hawley (2006) suggests two routes: “Undermining”\nor “Counterargument” (we introduce each in turn). Suppose\nthat, as seems to be the case in the debate concerning STR, we want to\nargue that some metaphysics, posited by science, is false. That is,\nthe science, as it’s traditionally interpreted, delivers the\n“wrong” metaphysics. There are options (though, as Hawley\nnotes, it seems likely that any genuine attempt to respond to the\nobjection from relativity may require a little of each). First,\n“Undermining”: \nThis is the attempt to show that the scientific metaphysics is not\ninvolved in generating novel prediction, and thus that its appearance\nin a scientific theory does not give us reason to think it true.\n(2006: 463) \nAs Hawley notes, there’s a second step to Undermining, since\nmerely establishing that the metaphysics implied by the traditional\ninterpretation of a scientific hypothesis isn’t essential to the\nscientific theory, doesn’t establish that the metaphysics with\nwhich we would seek to replace the scientific metaphysics is\npreferable. We need to do more than show that the metaphysics implied\nby traditional interpretation and the metaphysics that we prefer are\non a par. We need to show that the\n“metaphysically-supported” metaphysics is on a stronger\nfooting than the “scientifically-supported”\nmetaphysics. \nUndermining is a strategy that a number of metaphysicians have\nplausibly looked to deploy, arguing that there are empirically\nequivalent theories that differ with respect to metaphysical\ncommitments, but yield the same predictions. For instance, see Craig\n(2001) and Markosian (2004); Zimmerman (2011) explores a range of\noptions. \nConsider a case: if a rod, R, is traveling in direction d and\nis observed by an observer, O, who is stationary with respect\nto R, then R will appear to be length l. If,\nhowever, O is in motion with respect to R, moving toward\nit, then the length of R will appear, to O, to be less\nthan l. There are two competing explanations we might give, a\nstandard “space-time” interpretation, as well as a\n“neo-Lorentzian” interpretation. As Balashov & Janssen\n(2003) have it: \n…the space-time interpretation and the neo-Lorentzian\ninterpretation provide constructive theory explanations. In the\nspace-time interpretation, the model is Minkowski space-time and\nlength contraction is explained by showing that two observers who are\nin relative motion to one another and therefore use different sets of\nspace-time axes disagree about which cross section of the\n“world-tube” of a physical system give the length of the\nsystem. In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation, length contraction is\nexplained by a combination of dynamical effects of measurement. (2003:\n331) \nNow, to endorse this “Undermining” approach, we would have\nto say that the neo-Lorentzian account is preferable to the space-time\naccount. And, problematically, that looks to be false. The problem is\nas follows. There’s an explanatory advantage to treating length\ncontraction as explained by geometric features of space-time, rather\nthan by a dynamically occurring process. This, as we see below, will\nrequire us to postulate an unexplained brute fact as to why length\ncontraction and time dilation appear in laws governing all matter.\nSince unexplained coincidences, or treating certain facts as\n“brute”, is suboptimal (particularly when, as Balashov\n& Janssen argue (2003: 341–2), the space-time interpretation\noffers a better explanation—one that does not treat Lorentz\ninvariance as brute or mysterious), so we ought to deny the\nneo-Lorentzian interpretation of relativity. \nLet’s try to get a better sense of this. What’s the brute\nfact required of us? And why should we worry about it? Why should we\nthink that the neo-Lorentzian theory, which is acknowledged to be\nempirically equivalent to STR (Balashov & Janssen 2003: 23;\nCallender 2008: 52–53), offers an inferior explanation of both\nlength contraction and time dilation than does STR? Janssen (2002)\nputs the point as follows: \nFor Einstein, the Lorentz-transformed quantities are the correctly\nmeasured real quantities. In the final version of Lorentz’s\ntheory, measurements never reveal the real quantities because all\nmeasurements are made with devices that are systematically distorted\nand improperly synchronized as a result of their and the\nobserver’s motion through the ether. (2002: 429) \nThus, where for Lorentz, “Lorentz-invariance” is a product\nof a law governing the dynamical behavior of entities in motion, for\nEinstein, Lorentz-invariance is simply a product of the geometry of\nspace-time. As Balashov & Janssen go on to argue: \nCompare the status of Lorentz invariance in the two interpretations.\nIn the former, Lorentz invariance reflects the structure of space-time\nposited by the theory. In the latter, Lorentz invariance is a property\naccidentally shared by all laws effectively governing systems in\nNewtonian space and time…In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation\nit is, in the final analysis, an unexplained coincidence that the laws\neffectively governing different sorts of matter all share the property\nof Lorentz invariance. (2003: 341) \nSo, here’s the detail of the objection. Lorentz’s theory\nwas born of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics\n(Janssen 2002: 423): the latter incorporated electric and magnetic\nfields, but made no pronouncements at all concerning other forms of\nmatter. Thus, although we can extend the Lorentzian theory to\nall laws governing matter, we have no reason to do so. It just happens\nto turn out that the laws governing matter all instantiate this\nproperty. Craig Callender (2008) makes the point clearly, as\nfollows: \nThe matter fields are Lorentz invariant but the space-time is not. For\nthis reason, all else being equal, one ought to prefer the Einstein\nMinkowski interpretation to the Lorentz interpretation. Positing\notherwise unnecessary unobservable structure—absolute\nsimultaneity—does violence to Ockham’s razor. (2008:\n53) \nCallender goes on to point out that once we grant that the Lorentz\ninterpretation is logically consistent and empirically adequate, the\nquestion becomes, “[w]hat are a few lost explanatory virtues in\ncontrast to _______ (fill in the blank with whatever tenses\nexplain)?” (2008: 53). After all, we have to posit an\nunobservable frame of reference and we don’t, typically, posit\nunobservables without good reason. At the moment, we lack good reason,\nunless we think that the motivations for presentism (e.g., those\ndescribed in\n §2)\n serve to persuade us that a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of the\nphysics of space-time is preferable to the space-time interpretation.\nUndermining thus looks to be a difficult road to plough. \nThe second option that Hawley (2006) describes,\n“Counterargument”, is as follows: \nThis alternative to Undermining accepts that the scientific\nmetaphysics is genuinely confirmed by the role it plays in generating\nempirical success, but claims that independent reasons to believe the\ntraditional metaphysics outweigh this scientific support. (2006:\n464) \nCounterargument is bold in the extreme. It seems to require that we\nsimply overturn the best physics on the basis of metaphysical\narguments. Perhaps we could take this line (but it seems a very\nchallenging route. The arguments for presentism (those stated in\n §2,\n for instance) look somewhat underpowered when it comes to delivering\nthat result. The way in which counterarguers have typically tried to\nproceed, then, is by giving independent motivations for rejecting the\nspecial theory of relativity (both Crisp 2008 and Monton 2006 may be\nread as doing this). Nonetheless, the orthodoxy remains strongly\nopposed to this kind of approach.","contact.mail":"Jonathan.tallant@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"}]
