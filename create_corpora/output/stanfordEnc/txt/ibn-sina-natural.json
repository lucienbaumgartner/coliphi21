Avicenna’s fame in many ways is a result of his\nability to synthesize and to extend the many intellectual trends of\nhis time. These trends included not only the aforementioned Greek\ntraditions, but also the Islamic theological tradition, Kalām,\nwhich was emerging at the same time that the Greek scientific and\nphilosophical texts were being translated into Arabic. Avicenna’s own\nunique system survives in no fewer than three philosophical\nencyclopedias—Cure (or The Healing), The\nSalvation and Pointers and Reminders. Each provides a\ncomprehensive worldview ranging from logic to psychology, from\nmetaphysics to ethics (although admittedly, ethics is treated only\nscantly). At the middle of this Avicennan worldview is natural\nphilosophy or physics (ʿilm ṭabīʿī).\nThe significance of natural philosophy, and Avicenna’s physics in\nparticular, is twofold. First, it represents Avicenna’s best attempt\nto explain the sensible world in which we live and to provide the\nprinciples for many of the other special sciences. Second, Avicenna’s\nnatural philosophy lays the foundations for a full understanding of\nhis advancements in other fields. Examples of this second point\ninclude, but are certainly not limited to, the ramifications of\nlogical distinctions for the sciences, the physical basis of\npsychology (as well as the limitation of physicalism for a philosophy\nof mind) and the introduction of key problems that would become the\nfocal points of metaphysical inquiry. In all cases, Avicenna assumes\nhis readers know their physics. \n\n\nAs others before him, Avicenna understands natural philosophy as the\nstudy of body insofar as it is subject to motion. Thus the present\nentry, after an overview of medieval physics generally, turns to\nAvicenna’s account of the nature of body followed by his account of\nmotion. Central to an account of bodies is whether they are continuous\nor atomic, and so one must consider Avicenna’s critique of atomism and\nhis defense and analysis of continuous magnitudes. The discussion of\nmotion follows in two steps: one, his account of motion and, two, his\naccount of the conditions for motion. The section on motion\nconcentrates on Avicenna’s unique understanding of the Aristotelian\ndefinition of motion as the first actuality of potential as potential,\nwhile the conditions for motion involve his understanding of time and\nplace. \n\nFor Avicenna, the proper subject of natural philosophy, in its\nbroadest or most general sense, is body insofar as it is subject to\nmotion. Beyond general physics (al-samāʿ\nal-ṭabīʿī), the physical sciences are further\ndivided into various special sciences distinguished according to\neither the kind of motion investigated or the kind of body treated.\nWhile Avicenna himself does not explicitly identify his decision\nprocedure for dividing the special natural sciences, it is evidenced\nin the way that he divides up the books of his monumental encyclopedia\nof philosophy and the sciences, The Cure (al-Shifāʾ).\nFor example, his book On the Heavens and Earth (Fī\nl-Samāʾ wa-l-ʿālam) from The Cure\ngenerally treats rectilinear and circular motion; On Generation and\nCorruption (Fī l-Kawn wa-l-fasād) deals with change as\nit occurs in the Aristotelian category of substance, whereas On\nActions and Passions (Fī l-Afʿāl\nwa-l-infiʿālāt) concerns how bodies are affected\nand affect one another with respect to, for example, the primary\nqualities of hot-cold and wet-dry, which they possess. Avicenna\ndistinguishes additional special natural sciences according to the\nspecific sort of body being considered, namely, whether the body is\ninanimate—generally the subject matter of Meteorology\n(al-Maʿādin wa-l-āthār\nal-ʿulwiyya)—or the body is animate—the subject\nof psychology (literally, the science of the soul or animating\nprinciple). Avicenna further divides the study of living bodies into\ngeneral psychology (ʿilm al-nafs), botany\n(al-nabāt) and zoology (ṭabāʾiʿ\nal-hayawān). The focus of the present study is limited\nprimarily to Avicenna’s general natural philosophy, although at times\nthe discussion is supplemented with developments in the special\nphysical sciences.  \nThe hallmark of natural philosophy and indeed of any science (sing.\nGk. epistēmē, Ar. ʿilm) for Avicenna and\nthe entire Aristotelian tradition is to uncover and to grasp the basic\ncauses (sing. ʿilla) of the phenomenon under\nconsideration. Like Aristotle before him, Avicenna identifies four\nsorts of causes: the matter, form, agent (or efficient cause) and end\n(or final cause) (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.10 and Avicenna, [MPh], bk. 6). For\nAvicenna the material cause is a wholly inert substratum for form. The matter explains any passivity or potentiality to be acted upon that a\nbody might have. The form (ṣūra) is the cause,\nprimarily, of a body’s being the actual kind or species that it is and\nperforming the various actions associated with that species;\nsecondarily, a form might be the cause of the accidental features and\ndeterminations that belong to that body (Avicenna occasionally uses\nhayʾa for this second sense of form). In general then,\nthe form is the cause of any actuality, that is positive features or\nactions, that the body has or does. The efficient cause accounts for a\nbody’s undergoing motion and change (or even for its existence), while\nthe final cause is that for the sake of which the form occurs in the\nmatter.  \nUnlike Aristotle, Avicenna also recognizes a broader division of\ncauses into physical causes and metaphysical causes (Avicenna, [Ph],\n1.10 [3]). The distinction is best approached by considering the\nAristotelian division between substances and accidents as found in the\nten categories. (Within the Aristotelian tradition, including\nAvicenna, the ten categories purport to provide the broadest\nclassification of ways things are found (mawjūd) in the\nworld; Avicenna, [Cat], 1.1 and [MPh], 3.1.) The primary category is\nthat of substance, which for Avicenna is the existence that belongs to\na thing through itself, for example, the existence that belong to a\nhuman as human or a dog as dog (Avicenna, [MPh], 2.1 [1–2]).\nAccidents are what exist in another, namely, in a substance, and\ninclude a substance’s quantity, quality, relation, where, when,\nposition, possession, activity and passivity. Metaphysical causes\ninvolve what accounts for the existence and continual conservation of\na substance, or, more exactly, of a concrete particular. Physical causes in\ncontrast involve those factors that bring about changes in the\naccidental features of bodies, primarily changes of quality, quantity,\nlocation and position. For example, a father is responsible for seeing\nthat his semen becomes located within the mother, and the mother\nensures that the right womb temperature for the fetus is maintained\nand that the fetus is fed. Location, temperature, possession of\nnutriment and the like belong to categories of accidents, not to that\nof substance. Consequently, for Avicenna the father and mother are\nmost properly physical agents, that is, the cause of accidental\nchanges that prepare the matter for the form. As such the parents are\nnot the cause of the existence of the offspring’s species form by\nwhich it is the specific substance it is. Instead, the metaphysical\nagent—the one who imparts the species form to the matter such\nthat there comes to be a substance of the same kind as the\nparents—is a separate (immaterial) agent, which Avicenna calls\nthe Giver of\n Forms (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.10 [3]; [AP], 2.1; [MPh], 6.2 [5] & 9.5 [3–4]).[1] \nRegardless of whether one is considering physical or metaphysical\ncauses, any motion or change (whether of some specific existence itself or just of\nsome new accident), Avicenna explains, requires three things: (1) the\nform that comes to be as a result of the change, (2) the matter in\nwhich that form comes to be and (3) the matter’s initial privation of\nthat form (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.2 [12–13]). These three—the\nform, matter and privation—are frequently referred to, following\nAristotle, as “principles of nature” (cf. Aristotle,\nPhysics, 1.7). While Avicenna happily agrees that these three\nfactors are present in every instance of something’s coming to be\nafter not having been, he is not as happy as to whether all three of\nthese features are equally “principles” (sing.\nmabdaʾ). His concern is that, strictly speaking, causes\nand principles exist simultaneous with their effects, whereas\nprivation is only ever prior to the change and passes away\nwith the change (Avicenna, [Ph], 1.3 [14]; McGinnis 2012, Lammer\n2018, §3.3). More properly speaking, Avicenna contends, privation\nis a precondition for change rather than a principle. Still, he\nconcedes that if one is lax in one’s use of “principle” so\nas to understand a principle as “whatever must exist, however it\nmight exist, in order that something else exists, but not\nconversely” (ibid) privation would count as a principle\nof change. Avicenna reasons thusly: The elimination of the privation\nfrom something as changeable renders that thing no longer changeable,\nwhereas the elimination of that changeable thing itself does not\neliminate the privation. In other words, insofar as something is\nchangeable, it depends on or requires that there be some privation.\nConversely, privation does not depend on and does not require that\nthere be anything changeable. For example, for Avicenna, the celestial Intellects—think Angelic host—are not subject to change; nonetheless, they all possess some privation of existence and perfection, which is found in God. Thus privation has a certain ontological\npriority to the changeable. There can be privation without the\nchangeable, but there cannot be the changeable without privation.  \nClosely related to causes and principles is the notion of a nature\n(Gk. phusis, Ar. ṭabīʿa), for Aristotle\ndefined a nature as “a principle of being moved and being at\nrest in that to which it belongs primarily, not accidentally but\nessentially” (Aristotle, Physics, 2.1, 192b21–3).\nBefore commenting Aristotle’s definition of nature, Avicenna begins his chapter “On Defining Nature” from The Cure\n(Avicenna, [Ph], 1.5) by distinguishing between the\nmotions and actions that proceed from a substance owing to external\ncauses and those that proceed from a substance owing to the substance\nitself. For instance, water becomes hot as a result of some external\nheat sources, whereas it becomes cool of itself. Avicenna next\nidentifies two sets of parameters for describing those motions and\nactions that proceed from a substance owing to that substance itself.\nThey may either proceed from the substance as a result of volition or\nwithout volition. Additionally they may proceed either uniformly\nwithout deviation or non-uniformly with deviation. Thus there are four\nvery general ways for dividing and describing all the motions and\nactions that are found in the cosmos. \n(1) Motions and actions may proceed as a result of volition and do so\nin a uniform and unvarying way, such as the motion of the heavenly\nbodies. The internal cause in these cases, Avicenna tells us, is a\ncelestial\n soul.[2]\n (2) Other motions and actions may proceed as a result of volition but\ndo so in a non-uniform and varying way, like the motions and actions\nof animals; the internal cause in these cases is an animal soul. (3)\nAgain, other motions and actions may not proceed as a result of\nvolition and are non-uniform and varying, like plant growth; the\ninternal cause in these cases is a plant soul. Finally (4) some\nmotions and actions may proceed without volition while doing so in a\nuniform and unvarying way, like the downward motion of a clod of earth\nand the heating of fire; the internal cause in these cases is a\nnature.  \nNext, he turns to Aristotle’s own account of nature and begins by chiding Aristotle for his cavalier assertion that trying to prove that natures exist is a fool’s errand, since it is self-evident that things have such (internal) causes. While we are immediately aware\nof motions and actions that seemingly proceed from substances of\nthemselves, that there truly exist internal causes of these\nactions and motions is certainly in need of demonstration. Indeed, one\nwho first encounters the motion of a magnet, Avicenna gives as an\nexample, might imagine that its motion is a result solely of itself\nrather than of iron in the vicinity. Moreover, during Avicenna’s time\nthe question of whether natures existed at all was a hotly debated\ntopic between philosophers in the Graeco-Arabic tradition, like\nAvicenna, and thinkers in the Kalām tradition, the tradition of\nIslamic speculative theology and cosmology.  \nProponents of the Kalām tradition, such as\nal-Bāqillānī (950–1013) and al-Ghazālī (1058–1111), had\na two-stage critique. First, anticipating Hume by at least 700 years,\nthese thinkers noted that observation alone could not distinguish\nbetween causal connections and mere constant conjunctions. (A\ncontemporary example often found in statistic classes is that the\nsummer sun’s heat seems to be causally connected with ice\ncream’s melting, whereas eating ice cream is only constantly\nconjoined, at least in the US, with an increase in violent crimes.)\nObservation alone, these thinkers warn us, cannot determine, for\nexample, whether the cotton’s burning, which follows upon\nplacing fire in the cotton, or intoxication, which follows upon\nimbibing alcohol, is causally connected with the natures of fire and\nalcohol respectively, or whether these sets of events are merely\nconstantly conjoined. Indeed the concurrence of two events may be a\nresult of God’s habit or custom (ʿāda or\nsunna) of causing the one event together with the other. While\none might think that appealing to God to explain the various mundane\nevents that we constantly observe around us is extravagant, Kalām\nthinkers countered that it was in fact the philosophers who are\nontologically profligate, for the theologians assume only one class of\ncauses, namely, willful agent(s), whereas the philosophers are\ncommitted to two ontologically distinct classes of causes, if not\nmore. This point leads to the second stage of the Kalām critique\nof natures. God’s (omnipotent) causal power extends to every\nactual or even possible event. God’s causal power is either\nsufficient to produce these effects or it is not. If God’s power\nis not sufficient, then either the deity needs the added\n“boost” of natural powers, or it needs natures as a tool\nor instrument, etc.  This later position flirts with impiety. If,\nhowever, God’s causal power is sufficient to produce every\neffect and there are also natures, functioning as internal causes,\nevery event is over-determined. Indeed it is not clear at all what\ncausal role natures have to play. A principle of parsimony, so the\nKalām critique concludes, suggests that natures be jettisoned and\none reserve all causal power to God alone. While Avicenna addresses\nthe issue of the existence of natures and offers up a demonstration\nfor their existence in the Metaphysics (4.2, 9.2 & 9.5;\nalso see Dadikhuda 2019), he also notes that the science of physics is\nnot the proper place to undertake such an enterprise. That is because\nthe existence of a science’s subject matter, Avicenna notes\nfollowing Aristotle, is never demonstrated within that very science\nitself but only in a higher science.  \nHaving set aside the issue of whether natures exist and for present\npurposes posits that they do, Avicenna now unpacks Aristotle’s\ndefinition. Before considering his analysis, however,\nit should be noted that there is a certain ambiguity in Aristotle’s\noverall treatment of nature. The ambiguity involves whether nature\nshould be taken in a passive sense: is nature a cause of a substance’s\nbeing moved? Or, alternatively, should nature be taken in an\nactive sense: is a nature a cause of a substance’s (self) motion? In\nPhysics, 2.1, the text where Aristotle defines nature, he\nsuggests, although does not explicitly claim, that nature can be\nunderstood in both senses: a passive nature, which corresponds with a\nsubstance’s matter, and an active nature, which corresponds with the\nform of that substance, and so is a cause of its motion. In contrast,\nlater in the Physics, he argues that natures should be\nunderstood exclusively as passive (Aristotle, Physics, 8.4,\n225b29–256a3). This conclusion follows upon Aristotle’s principle\nthat everything that is moved must be moved by something, which he\nestablished at Physics, 7. The principle is significant for a\nkey element in Aristotle’s his natural philosophy, namely, his proof\nfor an unmoved mover. (The unmoved mover is intended to explain why\nthere is motion at all.) The aforementioned principle is significant\nbecause if all natural substances were capable of self motion, it is\nno longer clear that there is a need for an unmoved mover to account\nfor the motion of the cosmos. This ambiguity in Aristotle account of\nnature, namely, whether nature is an active source of moving or a\npassive factor of being moved, was the source of much discussion among\nAristotle’s subsequent Greek commentators, who included\n Alexander of Aphrodisias\n (ca. 200 CE) and the late Christian, Neoplatonic Philosopher\n John Philoponus\n (ca. 490–570). (For more detailed studies of this tradition see\nMacierowski & Hassing 1988, Lang 1992, 97–124 and Lammer \n2015, 2018, ch. 4).  \nAristotle’s definition of nature as it came down to\nAvicenna in Arabic literally translates into English as “the\nprimary principle of motion and rest in that to which it belongs\nessentially rather than accidentally” (quoted in Avicenna, [Ph],\n1.5\n [4]).[3]\n A “principle of motion,” Avicenna tells us, means\n“an efficient cause from which proceeds the production of motion\nin another, namely, the moved body” (ibid). Immediately we\nrecognize that a nature for Avicenna can be understood as an active\ncause that produces motion. Such a position is to be contrasted with\nAristotle’s claim at Physics 8.4 that a nature is not an\ninternal cause of a thing’s motion, but of its being\n moved.[4]\n Next we learn that “primary” in the definition means that\nthe nature causes the motion in the body without some further\nintermediary cause. As for “essentially,” (Gk. kath\nhauto, Ar. bi-dhātihi) it is an equivocal notion with\ntwo senses, Avicenna tells us. In one sense, “essentially”\nis predicated relative to the mover, while in another sense it is\npredicated relative to what is subject to motion, namely, the body.\nThus, on the one hand, when “essentially” is said relative\nto the mover, a substance’s nature, as efficient cause, essentially\nproduces those motions and actions that typify the substance as the\nkind that it is. On the other hand, when “essentially” is\nsaid relative to the body, it refers to the body’s essentially being\nsubject to those naturally characteristic motions and actions. In\neffect, by distinguishing the two relative senses of\n“essentially,” Avicenna has made room for Aristotle’s\ndefinition to include nature as an active and as passive principle. To sum up, for\nAvicenna, a substance’s nature is the immediate efficient cause for\nall of the naturally characteristic actions and motions it produces\n(active nature) as well as explaining why the body is subject to those\ncharacteristic actions and motions (passive nature).  \nWith the distinction between nature as active and nature as passive in\nplace, it becomes clear why Avicenna identifies the proper subject\nmatter of natural philosophy with body insofar as it is subject to\nmotion, for the science of physics studies nature in both of its\nactive and passive senses. Nature as passive refers to that which is\nsubject to motion, namely, bodies, while nature as active refers to\nthe causes and conditions of the motions and actions that bodies\nnaturally undergo. In this section, I begin with Avicenna’s general\nintroduction to bodies. I then take up his critique of atomism,\nspecifically as that theory was developed within Kalām.\nThereafter, I turn to Avicenna’s theory of the continuity of\nmagnitudes and his conception of infinity, concluding with a brief\nsurvey of his theory of the elements.  \nSensible body (jism or occasionally jirm), one can assume, is an aggregation of parts. Starting from this assumption, Avicenna next says of the body that it either (1) has actual parts or (2) has no actual parts. Avicenna effectively divides the logical space for a discussion of the aggregation of body into two categorical propositions: either “Some parts in a body are actual” or “No parts in a body are actual.” These are logically contradictory propositions, and so along one dimension they exhaust all logically possible options. In the case of “some parts,” the obvious question is, “How many?” where “finite” and “infinite” exhaust the possible options. Of course, the question, “How many?” is irrelevant when applied to no or 0 parts. Thus, there are three possible positions: body is an aggregate of (1) a finite number of actual parts, a position identified with that of the atomists; (2) an infinite number of actual parts, a position identified with that of Ibrāhīm al-Naẓẓām (c. 775–c. 845); (3) no actual parts, a position associated with the Aristotelian tradition and the contention that bodies are continuous and so not an aggregate of actual parts, even if potentially divisible ad inifinitum. \nAvicenna makes short work of (2), al-Naẓẓām’s\nposition (Avicenna, [PR], namaṭ 1, ch. 2; and\n[Ph], 3.4 [1]). The parts are units of the whole, which must have\neither no magnitude or some magnitude. If the units have no magnitude,\nthen while multiplying them may increase the number of units present\nin a body, it will not increase the size of the body. Consequently,\nbodies would not have any magnitude, an obviously false conclusion. If\nthe units have some magnitude, be it ever so small, and the body is\ncomposed of an actual infinity of these units, then complains\nAvicenna, “the relation of the finite units to the infinite\nunits would be the relation of a finite to a finite, which is an\nabsurd contradiction” (Avicenna, [PR],\nnamaṭ 1, ch. 2, p. 162). For instance, assume that\nal-Naẓẓām’s unit measures some extremely small yet\npositive amount of distance, for example, 1.5 x 10-35 of a\nmeter, then: \nThus ∞ : 1.5 x 10-35, that is, an infinite is\nproportional to a finite, which, as Avicenna notes, is absurd.  \nAvicenna’s more important target was Kalām atomism, which is significantly different from the Democritean atomism, which Aristotle had criticized. Thus, let us consider it quickly before turning to Avicenna’s critique of atomism.\n \nAristotle had in his physical writings addressed and critiqued atomism\n(e.g., Aristotle, Physics, 6.1 and On Generation and\nCorruption, 1.2). In the time between Aristotle and Avicenna,\nhowever, there were a number of developments in atomic theory both by\nEpicurus, one generation after Aristotle, and by Muslim theologians,\nthat is, proponents of Kalām, most of whom were atomists\n(Dhanani 1994, 2015). As a result, Avicenna’s critique of atomism\nneeded to address new innovations and challenges. One such innovation,\nwhich can be traced back to the Greek world, is a distinction between\nphysical divisibility and conceptual divisibility. Thus, for example,\nthe atoms of\n Democritus\n (d. 370 BCE) have as one of their properties shapes. If atoms have a\nshape and to have a shape is to have definite limits, then one might\nreason that Democritean atoms have distinct limits into which they can\nat least be conceptually divided, even if not physically divided.\nAristotle in fact exploited this point in his critique of Democritus.\nIn contrast, the minimal parts of\n Epicurus\n (d. 270 BCE) had no shape, and so were not subject to the same\ncriticism. Indeed, Epicurean minimal parts are purportedly not merely\nphysically indivisible but also conceptually indivisible. To provide a\nrough and ready image of an Epicurean minimal part, one might think of\nthe surface thickness of a plank, and the plank itself as the\naggregation of such surfaces. For example, then, when the surfaces of\ntwo planks are brought together tightly, intuitively one may think\nthat the two surfaces remain two distinct physical things; the bottom\nof the top plank, for instance, is distinct from the top of the bottom\nplank. When some enormous number of these surfaces is aggregated, a\nplank with a definite thickness, one might imagine, results. So how\nthick are these surfaces? One cannot fathom, but again being so thin\nthat dividing it further is inconceivable is the very point of\nEpicurus’ minimal parts. Whatever the chain of transmission, it was something much like\nEpicurus’ minimal parts that Muslim atomists identified with their\natoms, or more precisely, indivisible parts (sing. al-juzʾ\nalladhī lā yatajazzaʾu)—a spatial magnitude\nthat was not merely physically indivisible but also conceptually\nindivisible.  \nAnother difference between the theory of atomism that Aristotle\naddressed and the one that Avicenna does is the very nature of the\natoms themselves. Democritus’ atoms with their differences in shapes\nas well as differences in possible arrangement and positions are best\nconsidered as corpuscles, that is, small bodies. Thus when speaking of\nDemocritus, we can speak of “corpuscular atomism.” Such is\nnot necessarily the case with Epicurean minimal parts or Kalām\natoms, which, while making up the parts of bodies, were not themselves considered\nbodies. While there is some dispute about this point concerning\nEpicurus, Kalām atomists are fairly consistent in saying that the\nsole property of their atoms is that they occupy space\n(mutaḥayyiz) but otherwise lack any other determinations.\nIn fact, Kalām atoms might best be thought of as a matrix making\nup all space, with the individual atom representing the smallest\nspatial magnitude necessary for the occurrence of some co-incidental\nevent, determination or accident, like being red or hot or wet or even\npossessing power. In this respect, Kalām atoms are comparable to\nthe pixels on a modern-day TV or computer screen. The two are\ncomparable in that both are the smallest relevant units in which a\nsensible effect occurs, whether some color for modern pixels or any\naccident more generally for Kalām atomists. Consequently, this\nvariety of atomism might be called “pixelated atomism” to\ncontrast it with the corpuscular atomism that had been the target of\nAristotle’s criticisms. The significant point is that Avicenna could\nnot simply appeal to Aristotle and his attack on corpuscular atomism\nwhen critiquing atomism as he found it.  \nRegardless of what form of atomism one endorsed, a common argument in\natomism’s favor appeals to the notion of a sensible body’s being an\naggregation of parts. The argument is directed against the idea that a\ncontinuous magnitude, which for the philosophers included the natural sensible bodies that make up the world, can be potentially divisible ad infinitum (cf. Aristotle, Physics 3.7, 207b16). The most\ngeneral form of the argument rests on two principles: (1) the\nimpossibility of an actual infinity, a premise that even most\nAristotelians accepted; and (2) an analysis of potentiality in terms\nof an agent’s power, namely, to say that some action φ is\npotential is to say that there exists an agent who has the power\nactually to do φ. As part of a reductio-style argument, one is\nasked to assume (3), bodies are potentially divisible infinitely. In\nthat case, from (2), there must exist some agent (e.g., God) that can\nactually bring about the division. So let the agent enact the\npotential division. Either the result is an actually infinite number\nof parts or a finite number of parts. From (1), recall, an actual\ninfinity is impossible. Therefore, the totality of potential parts\nthat actually can be produced from the division is finite, but it was\nassumed that they were infinite, a contradiction. Since (1), (2) and\n(3) are mutually incompatible, one of these assumptions must be false.\nThe atomists point to the assumption of infinite divisibility and a\npotentially infinite number of parts. Thus, the argument concludes,\nthe parts from which sensible bodies are aggregated must be finite,\nwhether actually or potentially.  \nAvicenna’s response to this argument against the potentially infinite\ndivisibility of bodies is considered when discussing his theory of\n continuity.\n Prior to that, his reasons for rejecting atomism must be examined. To\nstart, Avicenna accepts that division with respect to body is of two\nsorts: physical division and conceptual division. In physical\ndivision, there is the actual fragmentation of a body, with the parts\nof the body becoming physically separated and at a distance from one\nanother. An example would be when one takes a single quantity of water and\nplaces part of it in one vessel and the other part in another vessel.\nAvicenna concedes that it well may be the case that bodies have some\nphysical limit beyond which they no longer can be physically divided\nand still remain the same sort of body. To provide an example of\nAvicenna’s point, our quantity of water can be divided as water until\none reaches a single water molecule; division beyond that point, while\nproducing hydrogen and oxygen atoms, does not produce smaller\nparticles of water. A single water molecule, then, is physically\nindivisible as water; it no longer remains as water after any further\ndivision. Still, inasmuch as a single water molecule occupies some\nspace, however small, one can conceive of half of that water molecule,\nand so it is conceptually divisible qua magnitude. Whether there\nactually are such physically indivisible units, Avicenna insists,\nrequires proof, which I consider when looking at\n Avicenna’s elemental theory.\n  \nThe form of atomism that Avicenna rejects is that there exist minimal\nparts that cannot even be conceptually divided further. These are the\nminimal parts of Epicurus and the atoms of Kalām. Avicenna’s\narguments against this conception of atomism takes two forms: one,\narguments showing that there is a physical absurdity with such atoms\nand, two, arguments showing that this form of atomism is incompatible\nwith our best mathematics, namely, that of Euclidean geometry. The\nfollowing two examples give one a sense of how Avicenna’s\nphysical-style and mathematical-style criticisms work (Avicenna,\n[PR], namaṭ 1, ch. 1 and [Ph], 3.4; Lettinck\n1988). While all the arguments considered are specifically directed\ntoward a theory of pixilated atomism, they apply equally well to\ncorpuscular atomism. Additionally, Avicenna has a series of arguments,\nnot considered here, showing the absurdities that would follow on the\npurported motion of corpuscular atoms.  \nWhile some of Avicenna’s physical-style arguments are quite complex\nand sophisticated, showing that the aggregation of bodies would simply\nbe impossible on the Kalām atomists’ view (an example can be\nfound in Section 2.3 of the entry on\n Arabic and Islamic natural philosophy and natural science),\n the following thought experiment is perhaps more intuitively obvious.\nPosit a sheet of conceptually indivisible atoms between yourself and\nthe sun. Certainly the side facing the sun is distinct from the side\nfacing you, for if the side that the sun is illuminating is the very\nsame side upon which you are gazing, there is no sense in which the\nsheet of atoms is between you and the sun. Thus on the\nassumption that it is physically possible for this sheet to exist\nbetween you and the sun, all the atoms composing the sheet have a\nsun-side and a you-side, and these two sides are distinct.\nPurportedly, conceptually indivisible atoms have been divided, a\ncontradiction.  \nAvicenna’s mathematical-style critique of Kalām atomism\nfrequently appeal to issues associated with incommensurability. In\nthis vein he argues that such geometrical commonplaces as diagonals\nand circles would be impossible on the assumption of conceptually\nindivisible atoms. For example, in the pixilated atomism of the\nKalām, the atoms might be thought to form a three-dimensional\nCartesian coordinate system with each atom corresponding to some\nordered triplet on this space. A two-dimensional plane, then, would\nlook something like a chessboard. Avicenna now has us describe a right\nisosceles triangle on this chessboard, setting the two equal sides,\nfor instance, at 3 units. Given the Pythagorean Theorem, A2\n+ B2 = C2, we should be able to solve for the\nlength of the hypotenuse, which is √18 ≈ 4.25. Avicenna,\nnext observes that assuming Kalām atomism, the hypotenuse of our\ntriangle must fall either well below the solution given by the\nPythagorean theorem—namely, it would be 3 units if one just\ncounts the 3 squares along the diagonal of a 3x3 chessboard—or\nsignificantly exceed it—for instance 6 units, if the atoms can\nsomehow be stair stepped. Alternatively, one might consider units\nsmaller than the atoms, but such a move is to give up atomism.\nKalām atomism, then, cannot even approximate the answer of the\nPythagorean Theorem, and yet the Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the\nmost well-proven theorem in the history of mathematics. Given the\nchoice between a dubious physical theory and our best mathematics,\nAvicenna sides with Euclidean geometry and its assumption of\ncontinuous\n magnitudes.[5] \nHaving rejected atomism, with its central claim that sensible bodies\nmust be aggregates of a finite number of conceptually indivisible\nparts, Avicenna must explain and defend his preferred account of\nbodies. Avicenna adopts a modified form of Aristotle’s theory of the\ncontinuity of bodies. Aristotle himself had provided no fewer than\nthree different accounts of continuity (Gk. sunecheia, Ar.\nittiṣāl): \nPrecisely because these three accounts are different, Avicenna starts\nhis own discussion of continuity, claiming that “being\ncontinuous is an equivocal expression that is said in three\nways” (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.2 [8]). Two of these senses, he\ncontinues, are relative notions, while only one, i.e., (3) above,\nidentifies the true essence of what it is to be continuous. In fact,\nhe even goes as far as to say that account (1) is not truly a\ndefinition of being continuous at all; rather, it is a necessary\naccident of the continuous that must be demonstrated, a point to which\nI return when I look at what Avicenna considers to be the proper\naccount of continuity. \nAs for the relative notions of continuity, the explanations can be\nquick. First, discrete objects might be said to constitute a\ncontinuous whole relative to a motion. For example, all the connected\ncars on a moving locomotive are clearly distinct and separate things,\nand yet they move together as a continuous whole. Second, discrete\nobjects might be said to be continuous according to Aristotle’s\ndefinition (2) relative to some shared extremity. For example, for any\nangle ∠ABC greater than or less than 180°, the lines AB and BC\nshare one and the same extremity, B, and yet are distinct and jointed.\nNeither of these senses is strictly speaking the target of the\natomist’s critique nor the thesis concerning the continuity of bodies\nand magnitudes that Avicenna (or other Aristotelians) is keen to\ndefend. Thus for Avicenna only (3), that two things are continuous if\nand only if there is a common boundary at which they join together,\ncaptures the proper definition of continuity.  \nA continuous sensible body (or any magnitude), Avicenna insists, must\nultimately lack any parts and instead must be considered entirely as a\nunified whole. Admittedly, one can posit parts in this unified whole,\nlike the left-part and the right-part, but such accidental parts are\nwholly the result of one’s positing and they vanish, claims Avicenna, with\nthe cessation of the positing.  \nTo press Avicenna’s point a bit further, a continuous body has no\nparts in it, not even potential parts, if by “potential\nparts” one means points or the like latent within the body\nwaiting for some power to actualize them or divide the body at them.\nTo appreciate Avicenna’s point here fully, a few words must be said\nabout his conception of the form-matter constitution of bodies and the\nrelation of his view of continuity to psychological processes.  \nLike Aristotle and other Aristotelians both before and after him,\nAvicenna is convinced that bodies are constituted of matter and form.\nIf one considers just body as such, that is, disregarding any specific\nkind of body it might be, then this absolute body, Avicenna tells us,\nis a composite of matter (hayūlā) and the form of\ncorporeality (ṣūra jismiyya). Avicenna conceives\nmatter as wholly passive, having no active qualities or features. (For\ndiscussion’s of Avicenna theory of matter see Hyman 1965; Buschmann\n1979; Stone 2001; McGinnis 2012; but also see Lammer 2018,\n§3.2 for corrections of some of these earlier views.) In fact,\nAvicennan matter has no positive characterizations of its own at all\nby which it can be defined; rather, for Avicenna, matter is best\nunderstood solely in relation to the forms by which it is actualized\nand informed. Avicenna’s matter, then, is intimately linked with\nrelative privation (ʿadam), that is, some lack, which under the right\nconditions can be realized. Given matter’s essentially privative\ncharacter, it, then, cannot be the explanation for a sensible body’s\nhaving the positive characteristics of being unified and one, nor the\ncause of that body’s being extended so as to be subject to division.\nInstead, according to Avicenna, what makes a body a unified whole and\nsubject to division is its form of corporeality.  \nFor a determinate body to exist at all, Avicenna believes, it must\nhave a determinate shape, and so be three dimensional, and so be\nlocalized in space. Both of these features are the result of its\ncorporeal form (For a fuller discussion see Hyman 1965; Shihadeh 2014;\nLammer 2018, §3.1). When the form of corporeality comes to inform\nmatter, there comes to be a single unified body, existing on account\nof its particular and individual form of corporeality. Should the body\nbe physically divided, the particular and individual form of\ncorporeality is not so much divided as destroyed and replaced with two\nnew particular and individual forms of corporeality corresponding with\ntwo new bodies. It is essentially the form of corporeality that\nunifies and makes a body numerically and actually one. Additionally,\nwhile the form of corporeality makes the body actually one,\nit also makes the body potentially many. That is to say, the\nform of corporeality is the cause of a body’s being three-dimensional\nsuch that one can posit such divisions as right-side and left-side in\nit.  \nWe are now led to the role of psychological processes in Avicenna’s\naccount of a continuous body’s infinite divisibility. While it is true\nfor Avicenna that continuous bodies can conceptually be divided\nwithout end, such a feature is not the result of any positive\nattribute within the body. This potentiality for division does not\ncorrespond with any positive features latent within the body. Instead\nthe potentiality for infinite division refers to a privation in the\nmatter of the body. The matter, extended and possessing quantity as a\nresult of the form of corporeality, does not preclude or prevent one\nfrom positing imagined divisions within the body as small as one\nwants. Indeed, this psychological process of imaging or positing\ndivisions in principle has no end. Thus, looking at, for example, a\nmeter stick, one can posit a halfway point, then the halfway point of\none side and then a further halfway point and so on as long as one\nlikes; however, as soon as one stops the process of imagining halfway\npoints, the imagined points (regardless of how many one has imagined)\ndo not magically remain but altogether cease with the cessation of\ntheir being posited. The body remains as it always was, a unified\nwhole, whose unity is only ever lost by actual physical division, not\nconceptual division.  \nWith this conception of continuity in place, the Kalām argument\nagainst potential divisibility ad infinitum dissolves. Again that\nargument assumed two principles: (1) the impossibility of an\nactual infinity; and (2) an analysis of potentiality in terms\nof an agent’s power, namely, the view that some action φ is\npotential if and only if there is an agent who has the power actually\nto do φ. In point of fact, Avicenna rejects both principles (his\nconception of infinity is discussed at\n 2.4);\n for now he simply questions the theologians’ inference from\nsomething’s being potential to the possibility of its being realized\nall at once at some moment or other. The original Kalām argument\nassumed that a potential infinity of divisions existed in a continuous\nbody. In that case, the argument continued, let God actualize that\npotential, and one is confronted with an actual infinity. Avicenna in\ncontrast understands the potential infinite divisibility of bodies in\nterms of an ongoing process of positing successive divisions within\nthe magnitude, a process that by definition has no end. Of course,\nthere is a contradiction here in assuming that some agent, even God,\ncan get to the end of some process that has no end, but such a\ncontradiction does not tell against Avicenna’s theory of continuous\nbodies. In fact, Avicenna’s conception of potential infinite\ndivisibility is compatible with (2), since there is no immediate\ncontradiction in saying that God eternally and without ceasing posits\never-decreasing halfway points in some magnitude. Still even in this\ncase, there never is an actual infinity of such halfway points, as the\nproponents of Kalām atomism maintain. \nWith the introduction of continuity and its corresponding notion of\ninfinite divisibility one is also obliquely introduced to the notion\nof infinity (lā nihāya). Avicenna, following\nAristotle’s account of the infinite (apeiron) at\nPhysics, 3.6, defines it as “that which whatever you take\nfrom it—and any of the things equal to that thing you took from\nit—you [always] find something outside of it” (Avicenna,\n[Ph], 3.7 [2]). In natural philosophy, the immediate issue is whether an\ninfinity exists either in quantities that posses some position or in\nnumbers in an ordered series (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.7 [1]). The\nmutakallimūn, that is, the proponents of Kalām, were for the\nmost part opposed to predicating the infinite of anything other than\nGod. This opposition included both actual infinity and potential\ninfinity, as we have seen. While it is notoriously difficult to give a precise account\nof the difference between the actual as opposed to the potential\ninfinite, a rough characterization is this: In the case of an actually\ninfinite magnitude, all the parts of that magnitude are somehow\nsimultaneously and fully present, whereas in the case of the\npotentially infinite there is an going process or succession in which\nthe units come to be, never wholly existing as actual at some given\npoint or moment. While Avicenna happily accepts the reality of\npotential infinities, he denies that there are material instances of\neither actually infinite qualities, like infinitely large bodies, or\nnumbers, like infinitely large sets of bodies, all of which exist\n simultaneously.[6] \nAvicenna has a number of arguments attempting to show that an actual\ninfinity in nature is impossible (for a presentation and assessment of some of these arguments see Zarepour 2020). These arguments can be divided into\nthose that appeal to motion as part of the proof, and those that do\nnot appeal to motion. Here I merely consider one of Avicenna’s\nnon-motion proofs against an actual (spatial) infinity. The argument,\nwhich I present, is not the preferred proof in either The Cure\nor The Salvation, although he had toyed with it in The\nCure (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.8 [5–7]). Still it is his preferred\nand indeed only argument against an actual infinity in his shorter and\nlast philosophical encyclopedia, Pointers and Reminders\n(Avicenna, [PR], namaṭ 1, ch. 11, p.\n 183–90).[7]\n Moreover, the proof is a uniquely Avicennan one.  \nThe argument asks one to posit some actually infinite ray, AB and then\nanother actually infinite ray, AC, so as to form an acute angle\n∠BAC. Next Avicenna asks one to consider the gap, BC, between the\ntwo rays. The farther from A that BC is, the larger BC becomes. Since the\ntwo rays are actually infinitely extended, BC should, in principle,\nalso be actually infinite; however, BC always lies between AB and AC\nand of necessity terminates at them, so BC is finite. Thus, there is a\ncontradiction: BC is both finite and infinite and, claims Avicenna,\nwhat produced the contradiction is the assumption that there is\nactually infinite space. Whether Avicenna’s new argument is successful\nbecame a matter of intense debate in post-classical Islamic natural\nphilosophy, with such notables as Abū l-Barakāt\nal-Baghdādī (1080–1165) and Najm al-Dīn\nal-Kātibī al-Qazwīnī (ca. 1203–1277) finding\nit wanting, whereas Naṣīr al-Dīn\nal-Ṭūsī (1201–1274) and Mullā\nṢadrā (1571–1636) considered it defensible (McGinnis 2018).  \nAvicenna’s arguments against an actual infinity in nature are in\ngeneral all directed against the possibility of infinite spatial\nmagnitude. Consequently, since space must be finite (i.e., limited),\nall bodies must be limited, and in being limited they have shape. This\nconclusion holds for the cosmos as a whole as well. As for the shape\nof the cosmos, while such a topic takes us slightly afield from a\ndiscussion of infinity, it does round out Avicenna’s abstract\ndiscussion of body. For a number of reasons, Avicenna thinks that the\nshape of the cosmos must be spherical. While in some ways Avicenna\ntakes this claim to be a matter of empirical observation, he also\nargues that since the nature of the heavenly bodies is completely\nhomogeneous and unvarying, there cannot be dissimilarities in a\nheavenly body such that a part of it would be angular and another part\nrectilinear or such that part of it has one sort of curve and another\npart a different sort (Avicenna, [DC], 3; also Avicenna, [Ph], 1.8\n[2] provides the general argument, albeit there it is applied to showing the\nsphericity of the Earth). Inasmuch as the cosmos is spherical, it must\nhave some center, which, at least from the point of physics, Avicenna\nidentifies with the Earth. (Strictly speaking the Earth is a bit off\ncenter in accordance with the demands of the Ptolemaic astronomy,\nwhich Avicenna adopts.)  \nWe thus now have a general picture of Avicenna’s conception of body in\nthe abstract. Body is not composed of conceptually indivisible atoms\nbut must be continuous and finite. In the next section I briefly\nconsider body not in the abstract, but particular kinds of bodies,\nnamely, the so-called elements.  \nWhen Avicenna speaks of elements (sing. usṭuquss) and\n(elemental) components (sing. ʿunṣur), he means\nsimple bodies, that is, bodies that are not composed of other sorts of\nbodies in the way that flesh, blood and bones, for example, are\ncomposed of more basics elements. Despite being simple, the elements\nare form-matter composites (Avicenna, [DC], 1). On account of their\nform and matter, elements have two powers: an active power following\nupon the element’s form and a passive power following upon its matter.\n \nAdditionally, Avicenna specifies different kinds of elements based\nupon three kinds of natural motions. The three kinds of natural motion\nare (1) motion around the center, (2) motion toward the center and (3)\nmotion away from the center (Avicenna, [DC], 2). Celestial bodies are\nin turn identified with those bodies whose natural motion is around\nthe center. Terrestrial bodies are identified with those undergoing\nrectilinear motion either toward or away from the center. By\nconvention, what moves away from the center moves upward, while what\nmoves toward the center moves downward. Avicenna believes that moving\naround the center, circular motion, is generically simple inasmuch as\nhe thinks that there is no contrary to circular motion (Avicenna,\n[Ph], 4.6 [7–11] & [DC],\n 2).[8]\n Consequently, the very nature of a celestial body is to move\ncircularly (Avicenna, [PR], namaṭ 2, ch. 12). As\nfor the terrestrial bodies, moving upward and downward are also\ngeneric descriptions; however, Avicenna continues, each of these\ngenera also has two species, corresponding with the different termini\nof the motion. Thus, for example, those bodies that move downward are\ngenerically alike in that they move away from the surrounding\ncelestial sphere; however, they can differ in that some have the\ncenter as their proper place or terminus for their motion, whereas the\nterminus of other downward-moving bodies falls short of the center.\nAny body that has the center as its proper place has absolute downward\nmotion, while a downward-moving body whose terminus falls short of the\ncenter has relative downward motion. The same holds mutatis\nmutandis for bodies that move upward. Those that have the limit\nof the surrounding celestial spheres as their terminus have absolute\nupward motion, while those whose terminus falls short of that limit\nhave relative upward motion.  \nIn order to explain the specific differences of the terrestrial\nelements, Avicenna, following a long tradition, which can be traced\nback at least as far as Hippocrates (460–370 BCE), appeals to\ncertain basic qualitative powers. These qualitative powers are\nhot/cold, which are seen as active powers following upon the form, and\nwet/dry, which are seen as passive powers, following upon the matter\n(Avicenna, [DC], 1). Additionally, Avicenna claims, the downward\nmotion of those elements so naturally inclined, namely, earth and\nwater, is the result of their being qualitatively cold and being\ndirected to their natural places, that is, toward the center.\nAnalogously, the upward motion of those elements so naturally\ninclined, namely, fire and air, is the result of their being\nqualitatively hot and being directed to their natural places, that is,\naway from center. The elements, earth and water’s natural inclination\n(mayl) downward is referred to as their heaviness, while fire\nand air’s natural inclination upward references their lightness\n(Avicenna, [DC], 2). As for the qualities, wet and dry, these passive\npowers refer to a body’s susceptibility or lack thereof to the\nimpressions and actions of some form. For example, what is wet or\nfluid more easily receives the impression of a form (just think of wet\nclay). In contrast, what is dry, while more readily retaining any\nimpressions made in it, does not easily yield to being impressed (now\nthink of kiln-dried clay). Given these differences in motions and\nqualitative powers, Avicenna, again following in this tradition,\nidentifies four terrestrial elements: (1) fire, which is hot and dry\nwith an absolute upward motion, (2) air, which is hot and wet with a\nrelative upward motion, (3) water, which is cool and wet with a\nrelative downward motion and (4) earth, which is cool and dry with an\nabsolute downward motion. Finally, and for completeness, (5) celestial\nbodies are neither hot nor cold (and so neither heavy nor light) nor\nwet nor dry, but instead are solely identified in term of their\nnatural circular motion.  \nIn section\n 2.2.2,\n it was noted that while Avicenna denied the possibility of\nconceptually indivisible atoms, he allowed for the possibility of\nphysically indivisible natural minimums. In other words, there might\nbe limits beyond which some specific kind of natural body cannot be\ndivided further and remain that same kind of body. It was further\nnoted that a proof was required whether there actually were such\nnatural minimums. We are now in a position to consider Avicenna’s\nproof for this thesis (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.12). Recall that for Avicenna\nthere are two forms of division. One involves merely positing imagined\ndivisions within a magnitude, so as never actually to destroy the\ncontinuity of the body. The second involves actually fragmenting and\nseparating parts of the body such that the parts are at a distance\nfrom one another. Avicenna’s proof for natural minimums involves this\nsecond form of division, namely, bringing about a separation of the\nparts. It additionally presupposes the theory of elements just\npresented and particularly the qualitative powers that are the\nnecessary concomitants of the terrestrial elements.  \nWhile the details and argumentation of Avicenna’s theory are complex,\nthe heart of the theory can be grasped through the following example.\n(For a discussion of the history and details of Avicenna’s account of\nnatural minimums see McGinnis 2015.) Avicenna first observes that the\nsmaller something is compared with its surrounding environment, the\nfaster and more easily that environment acts on what is surrounded.\nFor example, a blast furnace melts a kilogram of ore more readily than\nit does a metric ton of ore. Now, the example continues, isolate some\nrelatively small quantity of water, e.g., a milliliter, in a beaker.\nThe water qua the element water has the essential qualities of being\ncold and wet. Additionally, inasmuch as the water is isolated, and so\nnot part of a lake or the like, it is surrounded by ambient air,\nwhich, according to the elemental theory that Avicenna adopts, is hot\nand wet. Provided that the quantity of water is sufficiently large, it\ncan counteract the heating influences of the surrounding air; however,\nas one physically separates off smaller and smaller quantities of the\nwater, the natural heat of the surrounding air more readily and\neffectively acts on the diminishing quantity of water. At some point,\nthe heat of the surrounding air fully overcomes the coolness of the\nsmall quantity of water such that the coolness is replaced with the\nsame degree of heat as the surrounding air. In that case, there is no\nlonger a cold-wet element but a hot-wet element, and so there comes to\nbe air. What the example indicates is that there are natural limits of\nsmallness beyond which the qualitative concomitants of a given element can no\nlonger be sustained in isolation, and instead a new set of\nconcomitants, now associated with dominant ambient element, come to be. These limits beyond\nwhich a particular kind of body cannot be physically divided and\nremain the same kind of body are the natural minimums.  \nAgain the proper subject matter of physics is body inasmuch as it is\nmovable. We have just looked at Avicenna’s conception of body and\nassociated issues. I now turn to his theory of motion, followed by\ndiscussions of some of the conditions necessary for motion, like time\nand place. Avicenna’s theory of motion is best understood against the\nbackground of Aristotle’s account of motion and developments\nsurrounding that account that emerged in the later Greek world. (For detailed\ndiscussions of Avicenna’s theory of motion see Hasnawi 2001;\nMcGinnis 2006a; and Ahmed 2016).  \nIn Physics, 3.1, Aristotle defines motion (Gk.\nkinēsis, Ar. ḥaraka) as the\nentelecheia of potential as potential. Aristotle himself\napparently coined the term entelecheia, which might mean either\n“actualization,” as in a process, or\n“actuality,” as in the completion of a process. Given the\nambiguity of this term, it was a matter of some concern among later\nGreek commentators to understand Aristotle’s precise meaning. The\ndetails of the Greek debate need not concern us unduly, since the\nissue for philosophers in the medieval Islamic world was all but\nsettled by the choice of the Arabic translator of Aristotle’s\nPhysics, who rendered entelecheia as\n“perfection” or “completion”\n(kamāl). Consequently, for philosophers such as Avicenna,\nmotion was understood as a sort of actuality or perfection, as opposed\nto an actualization or a process.  \nGreek commentators provided additional glosses on the term\nentelecheia, which proved significant in Avicenna’s own account\nof motion. Drawing upon other Aristotelian texts (e.g., De\nanima, 2.5), these commentators identified both a first actuality\nand second actuality. A first actuality is like the student who\nactually knows a particular language but is not speaking it at that\nmoment, whereas the second actuality is like that student when\nactually speaking that language. Avicenna follows suit and formally\ndefines motion as “a first perfection of what is in potential\ninsofar as it is in potential” (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [3]). To\nclarify, Avicenna notes that in every category there are those things\nthat are actual and other things that, while actual in one respect,\nare potential in another. In the case of motion with respect to\nx (where x is some possible location or quantitative or\nqualitative feature of a body), the body before the motion is in\npotentiality to x—as well as any number of other places or states,\ny, z, etc. After the motion, the body is in a state of\nsecond actuality with respect to x, that is, x has been\nfully and completely reached or actualized. During the motion, then, the body is\nin a state of first actuality with respect to x. Avicenna\nunderstands this first actuality as a type of “being directed\ntoward” x (mutawajjih) as opposed to being\ndirected toward y or z. There is motion as long as the\nbody is directed toward x and there still remains some\npotentiality with respect to x, that is, the place or state of x\nhas not been fully reached or actualized. For example, as long as I sit in my\nhome, there are any number of places that I might visit; however, once\nI get up and begin going to the pub, as long as I remain directed\ntoward the pub but have not yet reached it, there is the motion that\nis my walking to the pub.  \nThus far, Avicenna’s discussion of motion is little more than a\nsophisticated commentary on Aristotle’s definition of motion.\nAvicenna’s analysis goes beyond Aristotle’s inasmuch as Avicenna\nrecognizes that “motion” is an equivocal term with two\nsenses. He identifies these two senses of motion, namely, traversal-motion and medial-motion. As for motion qua traversal, we sometimes speak of\nmotion as the whole continuous magnitude stretching from the initial\npotential state to the final actual state, such as my complete walk\nfrom my home to the pub. Now at no point does the whole of my walk\nexist in the way that the whole of the spatial distance covered\nbetween my house and the pub exists. Indeed, no sooner do I step\noutside the door of my home on my way to the pub than the initial\npotential state (being in my house) ceases to be and is replaced with\nsome new medial potential state (being on my porch). The same is true\nfor each subsequent state of the walk. Instead, observes Avicenna, the\nwhole and complete walk only ever exists as whole and complete in the\nmind, namely, I remember my being at home and then relate that mental\nimpression with my being in the pub. In other words, motion qua\ntraversal has no extra-mental existence but only ever has a mental\n existence.[9] \nIn contrast, medial-motion corresponds with motion inasmuch as it\nexists extra-mentally in the moving body itself. In other words,\nmedial-motion refers to the form that every moving body must have at\nany moment it is in motion in order to explain its being in motion.\nAvicenna describes this form thus: \nThis is the form of motion existing in the moved thing—namely,\nan intermediacy between the posited starting and end points inasmuch\nas at any limiting point at which it is posited, it did not previously\nexist there nor will it exist there afterwards, unlike [its state at]\nthe points of the two extreme limits (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [6]). \nWhile Avicenna is careful to avoid using any overtly temporal\nlanguage, like “time,” “instant” or\n“now,” what he has described is motion at an instant as\nopposed to the extended conception of motion captured in traversal-motion. In other words, motion as it exists extra-mentally occurs\njust in case a body exists at some point or in some state for only an\ninstant. For if a body is at some point or in some state for only an\ninstant, then at any subsequent instant it must be at some new point\nor in some new state, and consequently must have changed or undergone\nmotion. Such a position is not to concede that spatial, kinematic or\ntemporal magnitudes are composed of points. They are not, for again\nnatural magnitudes are continuous according to Avicenna. Instead,\nAvicenna means that as one can considers a smaller and smaller uniform\nmotion over a smaller and smaller spatial magnitude, the elapsed time\nof the motion becomes proportionally smaller too. At the limit\n(ṭaraf) of this process of considering smaller and\nsmaller increments of motion, there is motion at an instant, or, more\nin keeping with Avicenna’s description, at any point you posit the\nbody in the continuum, it was not there before nor will it be there\nafter. “This,” Avicenna concludes, “is, in fact, the\nfirst perfection,” which is motion (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [6]).\n \nAvicenna dedicates two chapters of the Physics of The\nCure (2.2 & 2.3) to motion’s relation to the categories: one\nto motion’s genus and the other to the species of motion. As for the\nfirst issue, Avicenna attempts to identify to which category motion\ngenerically belongs inasmuch as the categories supposedly provided the\nmost generic ways that (material) things might exist. While in the end\nhe concedes that given the canonical ten categories, motion seems most\naptly to fall under passion (Gk. paskhein; Ar.\ninfiʿāl), he is also uncertain whether Aristotle’s\nten categories are truly exhaustive and at least suggests that motion\nmight be sui generis (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.2 [8]; Hasnawi 2004;\nand McGinnis 2006a).  \nAs for the species of motion (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.3), Aristotle and the\ntradition up to Avicenna had recognized only three specific kinds of\nmotion. These include motion with respect to the categories of\nquantity, quality and place. Motion with respect to quantity involves\naugmentation and diminution, while motion with respect to quality\nincludes such changes as alterations in color, temperature and the\nlike. Finally, on the traditional categorization, there is change of\nplace, that is, locomotion, which for a number of reasons was believed\nto be the most significant or even primary species of motion. Avicenna\naccepts all three kinds of motion identified by the tradition. He\nadditionally adds to these three, motion with respect to the category\nof position, that is, the rotation of an object that remains in the\nsame place, like a spinning orb. The reason for his addition is\nobvious on consideration; for clearly an orb spinning in place is not\nchanging its quantity or quality and by supposition it is remaining in\nthe same place, yet clearly it is moving. Thus what kind of change is\nit undergoing? Only the relative position of its parts, claims\nAvicenna, is changing, and thus he concludes rotating objects must be\nchanging with respect to the category of position.  \nThe introduction of positional motion, however, brings with it a new\nchallenge. According to Avicenna, motion always involves a terminus\na quo, that is, a “from which,” (mā minhu)\nand a terminus ad quem, that is, a “to which”\n(mā ilayhi) (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [12 & 20–22]).\nHis reason for insisting on this point is that motion, as noted, is\nthe actuality of potential as potential, where the initial state of\npotentiality corresponds with the terminus a quo and the final\nstate of actuality corresponds with the terminus ad quem. The\ndifficulty is that there need be no starting and ending point for\nrotation, particularly if, as Avicenna believes, the rotation of the\nheavens has neither beginning nor end. Avicenna’s response to this\nchallenge involves a sophisticated analysis of the various ways of\nunderstanding actuality and potentiality (including an appeal to the\nfirst and second actuality already noted but also introducing a notion\nof remote and proximate potentiality). Without going into the details,\nthe general intuition of his response is simple enough (for a detailed\naccount see McGinnis 2006b). As a matter of supposition, one can posit\nwithin the continuous rotational motion of, say, a celestial sphere\nsome point, for example, the sun’s position when it is directly\noverhead. In positing that point, one by supposition indicates an\ninitial terminus a quo of the motion, but that same point also\nindicates a terminus ad quem for that motion (although the two\ntermini are in a sense also different since there is a difference in\ntime between the two instances of being at that point). Thus, for\nexample in our case, a complete sidereal day is actualized when the\nsun moves from a position directly overhead—the terminus a\nquo—and then returns to that position—the terminus\nad quem. Of course, nothing about this analysis requires that the\nrotation must cease once this sort of terminus ad quem, which\nis a proximate potency, has been actualized. Indeed it can be posited\nas a new terminus a quo for a new rotation. In short,\nrotational motion still has a terminus a quo and a terminus\nad quem corresponding with a potentiality and actuality, even\nthough such motion need have no absolute beginning or ending point.\n \nAn added benefit of Avicenna’s introduction of this new species of\nmotion is that it provides him an easy answer to what has been called\n“la grande question” of ancient celestial physics\n(Hasnawi 1984). As a bit of background to the problem, Aristotle\ndefined a thing’s “where,” or place, with the outermost\ncontaining limit of the surrounding body (Aristotle, Physics,\n4.4, 212a20) and Avicenna followed Aristotle faithfully on this point\n(Avicenna, [Ph], 2.9 [1–3]; Lammer 2018,\n§§5.1–2). Thus, only a body that has a body outside of\nit and containing it can have a place. Consequently the outermost\ncelestial sphere “beyond” which there is absolutely\nnothing, by definition cannot have a place. The problem, then, is\nthis: We observe the outermost celestial sphere apparently making a\ncomplete rotation once approximately every twenty-four hours, but what\nspecific sort of motion is the outermost celestial sphere undergoing?\nAristotle and the earlier tradition had identified only three species\nof motion: motion with respect to quantity, quality and place. Clearly\nthe motion of the heavens is neither a change in quantity nor a change in quality, but\nit is also not a change of place, since, as we have seen, the\noutermost celestial sphere has no place. Avicenna’s introduction of\npositional motion provides an obvious solution: the outermost\ncelestial sphere is moving with respect to the category of position.\nMoreover, Avicenna’s solution is not ad hoc, since he has integrated\nhis account of positional motion into his general analysis of motion\nand motion’s relation to the categories.  \nAgain physics is the study of bodies insofar as they are subject to\nmotion. We have just seen Avicenna’s account of motion and before that\nconsidered his views about bodies and magnitude more generally. A\ndiscussion of Avicenna’s treatment of certain necessary conditions\nassociated with motion and moving bodies is now in order. These\nnecessary conditions are, one, how to identify the place of a body\nand, two, the time required for motion.  \nAn account of place is particularly significant given that motion with\nrespect to place was frequently viewed as the primary species of\nmotion (although Avicenna would rank positional motion along side\nlocal motion, if not above it). The reason for giving priority to\nplace or position is that change in quantity involves the increase or\ndecrease of the place that a body occupies; and change in\nquality involves a body’s coming into proximity with some cause that\nbrings about the alteration, where “coming into proximity”\nrefers to a change of place either in the body or in the cause\n(Avicenna, [Ph], 4.9).  \nAs noted when discussing positional motion, Avicenna follows the\nAristotelian tradition and identifies the technical definition of\nplace (Gk. topos, Ar. makān) with “the\nsurface that is the extremity of the containing body” (Avicenna,\n[Ph], 2.9 [1]). The general structure of his argumentation for this\nthesis involves showing that all other candidates for what place might\nbe are wanting in some way. To this end, Avicenna provides us with, as\nit were, the logical space for an account of place (Avicenna, [Ph],\n2.6 [2]). Place can be either intrinsic or extrinsic to body, that is,\nessential or accidental to it. If place is intrinsic to a body, then\nit is either (1) the matter or (2) the form of the body, whereas if it\nis extrinsic, then the place is either (3) what the body exactly\nencompasses, that is, an interval (buʿd) or (4) what\nexactly encompasses the body, that is, the surface that is the\nextremity of the containing\n body.[10]\n Avicenna quickly eliminates (1) and (2). That is because a body can\nchange with respect to place, that is, depart from one place to\nanother, whereas a body cannot depart from either its matter or form\nwithout undergoing generation and corruption. Hence only (3) and (4)\nare truly live options. Account (4) is just the Aristotelian one,\nwhich Avicenna himself prefers. As for (3), namely that a body’s place\nis the interval it occupies, Avicenna believes that it ultimately\nstands or falls with whether a void (khalāʾ), an\nempty interval, is possible. Avicenna dedicates a long chapter\n(Avicenna, [Ph], 2.8) to showing that a void is impossible. If his\nargument there is successful, then (4), namely, place is the innermost\nlimit of the containing body, remains the only viable definition of\nplace.  \nAristotle before Avicenna had also dedicated a long section of his\nPhysics (4.6–9) to a refutation of the void. Aristotle’s\narguments might all best be described as physical ones inasmuch as\nthey all appeal to physical concerns associated with the void. More\nspecifically, Aristotle’s arguments attempt to show that motion would\nbe impossible on the assumption of a void. Avicenna reproduces many of\nAristotle’s physical arguments, often giving them his own unique\ntwist. Additionally, however, Avicenna develops what might be called a\nconceptual critique of the notion of void. In this critique, Avicenna\nattempts to show that the very idea of a void is conceptually vacuous\nor a vain intelligible. The criticism begins with a logical/physical\nprinciple: Anything that actually exists within the natural order can\nbe defined in terms of a genus and difference. (The general idea is\nthat the things that make up the physical world must be of some kind\nor species if they exist at all, and it is the genus and difference\nthat identify the kind or species.) He then adds one further\nqualification: Inasmuch as these actual existents positively make up\nthe world around us, their genus and difference must refer to positive\n(as opposed to negative) notions; a species properly understood\nanswers the question “what is it?” and a genus or\ndifference given in negative terms simply would not tell us what\nsomething is, but what it is not. (For a discussion of\nAvicenna’s theory of genus and difference and how it relates to his\ncriticism of the void see McGinnis 2007b.) \nWith these preliminaries in place, Avicenna’s conceptual critique\nbegins (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.8 [1–4]; also see McGinnis 2007a,\n2007b; and Lammer 2018, §5.3). He first asks whether the\nvoid actually exists or is absolutely nothing. If one says that the\nvoid is absolutely nothing, Avicenna happily agrees; for if it is\nabsolutely nothing, then it does not actually exist. Those who affirm\nthat the void actually exists, then, cannot simply say that it is\nnothing, but must provide some positive features about it. Avicenna\nnext notes that void space is frequently described as being of either\na greater or lesser extent, for the void space between two cities on\nEarth, for example, is less than the void space between the Earth and\nthe heavens. This property of being more or less is none other than\nthat of quantity. Thus if a void should exist, it would possess some\nquantity either essentially or accidentally. If quantity belongs to\nvoid accidentally, and every accident must belong to a substance, then\nvoid is joined to a substance possessing quantity. The quantity in\nquestion is necessarily three-dimensional, but as noted when\ndiscussing continuity, three-dimensionality follows upon the form of\ncorporeality. The form of corporeality, however, causes the existence\nof a body. Thus void would belong to a body as an accidental feature of it,\na seeming contradiction.  \nIn contrast, if the quantity is not accidental to the void but is\nessential to it, then void would be a species of quantity. Avicenna\nnow challenges the defenders of void to provide some positive\ndifference that would make up void’s species. It cannot be that void\nis a material quantity, since again a material quantity is body. If\none claims that void is immaterial quantity, Avicenna demands some\nnon-negative difference, for while there are immaterial substances,\nlike angels, one can provide a positive characterization of them as\nintellectual substances. Avicenna offers a number of\nsuggestions, but finds every attempt wanting or ultimately telling us\nwhat void is not rather than what it is. Since no definition of void\ncan be given in terms of a positive genus and difference, Avicenna\nconcludes that our idea of void is nothing but empty imaginings.  \nAgain, place had to be either (1) the matter or (2) the form of the\nbody, or either (3) what the body exactly encompasses or (4) what\nexactly encompasses the body (i.e., the surface that is the innermost\nextremity of the containing body). As noted (1) and (2) are\nnon-starters, and as just argued, (3) involves a conceptual confusion.\nConsequently, Avicenna concludes place must be the innermost surface\nof the surrounding body. \nAmong the conditions associated with motion, time (Gk. chronos,\nAr. zamān) is at least as important as that of place and\nvoid, for it is a necessary concomitant of motion. (A number of\nstudies on various aspects of Avicenna’s temporal theory exist and\ninclude Shayegan 1986; McGinnis 1999; Mayer 2007; and Lammer 2018,\nch. 6.) In order to appreciate time’s relation to motion, there is a\nmore basic question that must be answered first: Does time exist? An\naffirmative answer will seem obvious to many, but Aristotle at\nPhysics, 4.10 had offered a series of objections, four in all,\nthat cast doubt on the reality of time. Moreover, in his own positive\naccount of what time is, Aristotle does not address all of the\nobjections or even provide a general proof that time must exist in\nlight of the objections. One may then criticize Aristotle’s account of\ntime in light of his own theory of science: Aristotle has proceeded to\na theory of what time is before providing us with a proof\nthat time\n is.[11] \nAfter presenting the objections to and opinions about time, Avicenna\nbegins his own account of time (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.10–13) by\nfilling this lacuna in Aristotle’s presentation. Avicenna’s general\nstrategy is to take as empirically obvious certain facts about motion\nand then show that these facts cannot be explained unless there is\nassociated with motion a certain magnitude, which we commonly identify\nwith time. Only having shown that time exists does Avicenna then\nprovide a scientifically adequate explanation of what time essentially is.  \n\n Avicenna’s\n proof that time exists assumes these initial facts about moving\nbodies: \nOn the basis of these facts, Avicenna observes that associated with\nmoving bodies there is a certain possibility or capacity\n(imkān) to traverse some spatial magnitude. Moreover, this\ncapacity corresponds with the starting and stopping of the motion\n(that is, a kinematic magnitude). When the body is moving slower, a\ngreater amount of this possibility is required to cover the same\nspatial magnitude as that of a faster moving body. Given this\npossibility’s relation and correspondence with both spatial and\nkinematic magnitudes, Avicenna concludes that this capacity must be\nsome magnitude that stands in some relation to the distance and speed.\nThis magnitude is neither the magnitude of the body, whether the\nbody’s bulk or weight, nor the magnitude of the motion, whether the\nspeed or motivity, nor the magnitude of the distance traversed.\nInstead, this magnitude—again, the possibility belonging to a\nmoving body to cover more or less distance at a fixed\nspeed—concludes Avicenna, is what we call time\n(zamān).  \nWhile identifying time with a certain possibility to traverse some spatial magnitude, provides one with a criterion for recognizing time, it does not provide a proper scientific definition of what time essentially is, that is, a definition in terms of genus and difference. Thus, having shown that time exists, Avicenna next turns to defining time and showing what time essentially is. In general, Avicenna follows Aristotle and defines time as a “number of motion when it is differentiated into prior and\nposterior parts” (cf. Aristotle, Physics 4.1,\n219b1–2). Time’s genus, then, is a certain number, that is, some measurable aspect or magnitude, belonging to motion. Its difference is having essentially prior and posterior elements. Here is it important to note that for Avicenna, priority and posterity (taqaddum and taʾakhkhur) are generic notions, with a number of different species, like priority in eminence or location or time. For Avicenna, the prior and posterior in Aristotle’s definition refers to what is prior and posterior in the distance traversed as determined by the directedness of the motion over that distance. Thus, the charges of some, particularly Galen, that Aristotle’s definition of time is circular, since it appeals to purportedly temporal notions of before and after, is avoided. (See Lammer 2018, ch. 6.2). \nIn all three of Avicenna’s philosophical\nencyclopedias—The Cure, The Salvation and Pointers and\nReminders—he notes that, more precisely, time is a magnitude\nof circular motion with respect to the prior and posterior.\nHis insistence on circular motion rather than just motion in general\nis that only circular motion can potentially have neither beginning\nnor end. In other words, only circular motion can be infinitely\nextended into the past and future. \nWhile Avicenna has any number of arguments for the eternity of time\nand the world, his proof for the existence of time in terms of a\npossibility to traverse greater or lesser spatial magnitudes at a\nfixed velocity provides the basis for one of his central physical\narguments for that thesis. The argument, which is a reductio ad\nabsurdum has one assume that God created time, and so motion and\nmoving bodies, at some first moment, x, in the finite past, for\nexample, 10,000 years ago. Prior to x nothing but God existed,\nnot even time. (Here let years be measured in solar rotations as\nmeasured by the apparent motion of our sun. Also allow that\nthe present moment marks the completion of the 10,000 solar rotations, so that right now is the second terminal point for this motion.) Avicenna\nnext observes that it is certainly possible that God could have made a\ntime, and so motion and moving bodies, 20,000 solar rotations in\nduration, where this possible duration again reaches to the present\nmoment as its second terminal point. In this second scenario, 10,000 years of the full 20,000 year\nduration would exactly correspond with the 10,000 years in the first\nscenario, namely, the period extending from the present moment back to\nx. The remaining duration of this possible 20,000-year motion\nwould correspond with the possibility for 10,000 solar rotations,\nwhich now would terminate at x rather than beginning at\nx. (We can intuitively say that this remaining possibility is\nprior to or earlier than x, although Avicenna is careful not to\nbeg any questions.) Now to say that there is a possibility for 10,000\nsolar rotations (prior to x) is just to say that (prior to\nx) there exist a possibility for a sun (or other body) to\ntraverse a certain distance (that is, number of rotations) at a fixed\nspeed. From Avicenna’s earlier proof for the existence of time,\nhowever, recall that the possibility for a moving body to traverse a\ngiven distance at a fixed speed refers to time. Consequently, since\nthis possibility exists, time must exist. Yet in order for time to\nexist, as Avicenna argued, motion and moving bodies must exist.\nTherefore, concludes Avicenna, when nothing but God existed, time,\nmotion and a moving body also would have necessarily existed, a\nblatant contradiction. It is the assumption that time is finite,\nclaims Avicenna, that gives rise to the contradiction. Since this same\nargument applies to any finite duration of time, during which one may\nsuppose the world to exist, Avicenna concludes that time, and so\nmotion and moving bodies, must have existed infinitely into the past.\n(For the same reason  mutatis mutandis time, and so motion and\nmoving bodies, also must exist infinitely into the future.) \nWhile I have only scratched the surface of the riches of Avicenna’s\nnatural philosophy, the above discussions provide a number of the most\nbasic points of his thought.
