The\ncorresponding Latin terms were passio, affectus or\naffectio. Medieval theories of emotions were essentially\nbased on ancient sources. The new developments included the\ndiscussion of emotions from the point of view of Avicennian faculty\npsychology, the production of systematic taxonomies particularly in\nthirteenth-century Aristotelianism, the detailed studies of voluntary\nand involuntary aspects of emotional reactions, as well as late\nmedieval re-evaluations of the sharp divide between the emotions and\nthe will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe philosophical analysis of emotions was introduced by Plato and\ndeveloped further by Aristotle. In the fourth Book of his\nRepublic, Plato famously divided the soul into three parts:\nthe rational part (logistikon), the spirited part\n(thumoeides), and the appetitive part\n(epithumêtikon). This terminology was also used by\nAristotle and later ancient philosophers, even though its\nphilosophical background assumptions varied. The Latin terms for the\ncorresponding parts were intellectus, irascibilis\nand concupiscibilis. Plato’s view of emotions was\nbasically negative, with the exception of love in the\nPhaedrus and the educational capacity of the spirited part in\nthe Republic and the Laws. He regarded the emotions\nas irrational reactions of the lower psychosomatic levels of the soul,\nof which the appetitive part sought sensual pleasure and avoided\nsuffering and the spirited part was the seat of self-affirmation and\naggression. The immaterial reasoning part was the subject of knowledge\nand rational will. It was meant to govern the emotional parts by\nreducing the activity of the appetitive part as much as possible and\ncontrolling spontaneous suggestions of the spirited part and\nhabituating it to supporting good conduct. Plato supplied the\nemotional parts with a measure of non-intellectual cognitive\nevaluation with respect to perceptual representations and took them to\nbe accompanied by pleasant or unpleasant feelings and related\naction-initiating impulses. Plato’s main reason for this\ntripartition was the phenomenon of acrasy: while the undisturbed\nknowledge of right conduct makes people behave accordingly,\nuncontrolled lower impulses may draw them in other directions, most\ntypically toward immediate pleasures or aggression.  \nThe various aspects Plato associated with the dynamic movements of the\nlower soul were more systematically discussed in Aristotle’s\ntheory of emotions as part of the human condition. Aristotle developed\na detailed model for analyzing the psychological structure of\noccurrent emotions, which included four basic aspects, most\nextensively discussed in the section on emotions in the second book of\nthe Rhetoric. First, the cognitive element is an\nunpremeditated evaluation (belief or phantasy) that something positive\nor negative happens or may happen to the subject or to someone else in\na way which concerns the subject. Second, the affective\nelement is a subjectively felt pleasant or unpleasant feeling about\nthe content of the evaluation. Third, the dynamic element is\na behavioral impulse towards action which typically accompanies\nemotional evaluation. Fourth, there are typical physiological\nreactions such as the changes in the heartbeat. (For emotions in Plato\nand Aristotle, see Cooper 1999; Fortenbaugh 2003; Lorenz 2006; Price 2010; Dow\n2015.) \nThe compositional approach has been very influential in Western\nthought. As for the first element, practically all ancient and\nmedieval theories were cognitive, associating some kind of evaluative\nrepresentation with an emotion as its principal constituent. While the\nStoics, following their reason-centered rationalist psychology, argued\nthat it is philosophically sufficient to treat emotions simply as\nmistaken value-judgments, it was more common in ancient and medieval\ntimes to follow the view of Plato and Aristotle, who distinguished\nbetween the non-emotional intellectual power and the lower emotional\nparts of the soul, which were eliminated by the Stoics. This was the\nprevailing medieval view until the Franciscan conception of the\npassions of the intellectual faculty of the will (Knuuttila 2004). \nAs distinct from Plato’s control model, Aristotle proposed that\neducation may change the emotional dispositions so that their\naffective evaluations and inclinations support the quest for the good\nlife instead of disrupting it. This was the basis of his theory of the\nvirtues, which included the good emotional habits of the sensory soul\nand the good habits of the practical reason. As part of his\nphilosophical psychology, Aristotle developed a considered theory of\nhow the rational part may co-operate with the powers of the sensory\npart (Irwin 2017).  \nPlato and Aristotle presented some lists of emotions, the most\nextensive being in Aristotle’s Rhetoric II.1–11\n(cf. Plato, Timaeus 69d; Laws I.644c-d; Aristotle,\nNicomachean ethics II.5, 1005b21–23), but they did not\ndevelop any systematic taxonomy of emotions except considering some as\nthe affects of the appetitive part and some of the irascible part.\nBecause of the feeling aspect always being associated with an\nemotional representation, Aristotle sometimes distinguished emotions\non the basis of whether the emotional evaluation was pleasant or\nunpleasant; see also Aspasius’ commentary on the Nicomachean\nethics (41.28–43.32). The first elaborated taxonomy was put\nforward by the Stoics, who divided emotions into four basic types,\ndepending on whether the object was regarded as a present or future\ngood or a present or future evil: \nThe Stoics produced longer lists of particular emotions included in\nthese four types. (See Pseudo-Andronicus of Rhodes, Peri\nPathôn, ed. Glibert-Thirry, I.1–5; Diogenes Laertius\nVII.110–14; Stobaeus II.90.7–92.17.) The fourfold\nclassification was quoted in many well-known works, such as\nAugustine’s The City of God (XIV.5–9) and\nBoethius’ Consolation of Philosophy (I.7,\n25–28, and it was\ngenerally known in medieval times, although the Stoic explanation of\nemotions as such did not garner followers.  \nA well-known part of Stoic philosophy is the philosophical therapy of\nemotions (therapeia) described in works by Cicero, Seneca and\nEpictetus. Stoic therapy aimed at apatheia, the extirpation\nof emotions, as a consequence of learning to see things in accordance\nwith the Stoic conception of rational reality without self-centered\ncommitments. Emotions were typically regarded as false judgments about\nthe value of things and the behavioral reactions to them. The Stoics\noften described the types of emotion by referring to their typical\npsychosomatic reactions, but the positive beliefs about the propriety\nof these expressive movements and corresponding actions were regarded\nas irrational. The elements of the Stoic therapy were known in later\nLatin philosophy through Cicero’s Tusculan\ndisputations, Seneca’s On anger and some Christian\nsources. Other Hellenistic philosophers such as Plutarch generally\nfollowed the psychology of Plato and Aristotle, arguing for the\nmoderation of the emotions (metriopatheia). The Stoic\napatheia was regarded as impossible because of the emotional\npart of the soul and as inhumane insensitivity with respect to other\npeople. Plotinus and his Neoplatonic followers argued for\napatheia, though this did not involve the disappearance of\nthe emotional part—earthly emotions became useless in higher\nNeoplatonic spheres (see Nussbaum 1994; Sorabji 2000).  \nThe Alexandrian theologians Clemens and Origen combined Stoic and\nPlatonist ideas, arguing that freedom from emotion was part of\nChristian perfectibility and the precondition for divinization through\nparticipation in divine love (agapê). This mystical\nunion was described in highly emotional language, but supernaturally\ncaused spiritual feelings as experiences of the apathetic soul were\nnot called simply emotions. John Cassian made this combination of\ndivine love with freedom from mundane emotions known in Western\nmonasticism. It was employed in influential treatises by Gregory the\nGreat and Bernard of Clairvaux. While this approach was also present\nin the Cappadocian fathers and Augustine, they stressed the importance\nof Platonic control and moderation in everyday life to their\nnon-monastic audience.  \nThe monastic literature on mystical ascent developed introspective\nanalysis of subjective feeling, which Bernard of Clairvaux called the\nsense of being affected by divine action (sentit intra se\nactitari, Opera II, 10, 28–29; Köpf 1980:\n136–174). Many later theologians such as Albert the Great and\nThomas Aquinas wrote commentaries on the Pseudo-Dionysius’s\nworks (late fifth century), which taught on mystical experience from\nthe point of view of Christian Neoplatonism.  (For ancient Christian\ndiscussions, see Hadot 1995; Knuuttila 2004; for Augustine, see also\nByers 2013; Gao 2018; for Gregory the Great, see Straw 1988; Humphries\n2013; for medieval commentaries of Pseudo-Dionysius, see Coakley and\nStang (eds., 2009); Blankenhorn 2015. \nMonastic psychology also made use of the originally Stoic doctrine of\nfirst movements, which Origen, followed by Augustine and many others,\napplied to the Christian conception of sin. The Stoic idea, described\nby Seneca in On Anger (2.1–4), was that even apathetic\npeople might react quasi-emotionally on exceptional occasions, but\nthis was not really an emotion because it did not involve judgmental\nassent. Augustine taught that sinful thoughts which easily and\nfrequently came to mind because of original sin became sins through\na subsequent assent (Expositio quarundam propositionum ex Epistola ad\nRomanos, 2066). \nAccording to Augustine’s influential doctrine of sin, the\noriginal fall was followed by shame, which Adam and Eve felt when they\nfound themselves being moved by the movements of the lower soul and\nthe body, the functions of which they as rational beings should\ncontrol. Original disobedience of the higher part of the soul founded\nthe functional mode of the inherited original sin in the sense of\npenal disobedience of the lower part, the relative autonomy of which\ncontinuously reminds humans of their shameful condition of not being\nwhat they should be and demands continuous control (Augustine, De\ncivitate Dei, XIV.23). Augustine held that spontaneous emotional\nagitations are emotions even though they do not involve an assent to\nthe emotional evaluation or its behavioral suggestion. In his view,\nthe Stoics did not refer to these representations as emotions because\nof their sinful pride, which prevented them from realizing the\nweakness of the fallen soul in themselves (De civitate Dei\nIX.4). Augustine thought that the occurrence of evil thoughts and\ndesires is not directly under voluntary control. The temptations are\ntherefore not accountable sins (culpa) before one can in\nprinciple expel them from the soul. If this is not immediately done,\nthey can be regarded as being freely consented to (as all sins are)\n(De sermone Domini in monte,\n12.34–35). Augustine’s doctrine of sin was later developed\ninto a detailed theory of the modes of assent as the degrees of venial\nand mortal sin. As distinct from Augustine, sinfully oriented first\nmovements were increasingly regarded as venial sins even before a free\nchoice. This was also the view of Aquinas. See Knuuttila 2004:\n178–192. \nApart from the first sinful movements, love and compassion were other central emotions in medieval theology. Misericordia was a Latin translation of the term eleos used in Greek philosophy and literature. In the Vulgate translation of the Bible, the term misericordia was used of divine mercy as well as of a human emotion of sorrow for the misery of another. Compassio was not a Classical Latin word, but it came to be employed by some Christian authors and then increasingly used. The reason for this new terminology was apparently the need for an unambiguous word that would apply to the human part of the meaning of misericordia which continued to be used as a term with divine and human references. (See Konstan 2001: 106; Konstan 2006: 201-216.) It was usually assumed that God has no emotional sorrow or pity and no other emotion for that matter. Augustine wrote that “pity (misericordia) is a kind of compassion (compassio) in our hearts for the misery of others which compels us to help them if we can” (De civitate Dei IX.5). Gregory the Great’s understanding of compassion was similar to that of Augustine, and he treated it as a Christian sentiment which is included in the virtue of charity love. Because of the influence of Gregory’s works, compassion became a central notion in medieval theology (Straw 2013; Coolman 2008). Quoting Augustine’s definition, Aquinas explains that compassion is an emotion which as such is ethically neutral. When it is connected with charity, it becomes an affective part of misericordia (mercy), a virtuous concern for the miseries of others (Summa theologiae II.2.30). Aquinas writes that a person should be compassionate in affect and helpful in effect (Summa theologiae II-2.45.6, ad 3). (See also Miner 2016.) \nWhile the works of Augustine, Cassian, and Gregory the Great were\namong the main sources of the discussion of emotions in early medieval\nliterature, new non-religious impulses were supplied by the\nLatin translations of some philosophical and medical works. One of\nthese was the translation of the Arabic medical encyclopedia of\n‘Alī ibn al-‘Abbās al-Mağūsī (in\nLatin Haly Abbas), which contained various remarks on the emotions\nbased on Galen’s medical philosophy. The first partial\ntranslation by Constantine the African (c. 1080) was called the\nPantegni and the complete translation by Stephen of Antioch\n(1127) the Regalis dispositio. Elements of ancient\nmedical and philosophical theories of the emotions were also included\nin Nemesius of Emesa’s De natura\nhominis (17–21) from the late fourth century and John\nDamascene’s De fide orthodoxa from the eighth century,\nthe latter being much influenced by Nemesius’s work. These treatises were translated into Latin in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. An\nimportant early medieval psychological source-book was the sixth book\nof Avicenna’s Shifā’, translated into Latin\nin the middle of the twelfth century by Gundisalvi and Avendauth.\nThis translation was called Liber de Anima or Sextus de\nnaturalibus. Avicenna’s work influenced the terminology of\nearly commentaries on Aristotle’s De anima, which\nbecame the principal textbook of psychology in the middle of the\nthirteenth century; Aristotle’s work was translated c.\n1150 by James of Venice and 1267 by William of Moerbeke.  \nDrawing from Aristotelian and Neoplatonic psychology, Avicenna\ndistinguishes between the functions of the soul by attaching them to\nspecial powers or faculties. The most relevant in this connection are\nsensory moving powers and internal senses: common sense, imagery\n(retention of sensations), estimation, memory, and imagination\n(separation and combination of sensory forms). Inner senses are\nnon-perceptual apprehensive powers of the sensory soul (De\nanima IV.1, 1–11; IV.3, 37–40). The moving power of\nthe sensory soul is divided into a commanding power and an executive\npower, the former of which is the center of emotions. The executive\nmoving power operates through the nervous system and the muscles. It\nis moved by the commanding moving power, the acts of which are\ntriggered by an occurrent evaluation of estimative power and\naccompanied by bodily affections as well as behavioral changes,\nprovided that the executive moving power is also actualized. If the\ncommanding act is strong enough, the executive power is necessarily\nactualized in animals, but not so in humans because they can prevent\nthe impulse of the executive moving power by their will. The will is\nthe moving power of the immaterial intellectual soul. Together with\npractical intellect, it should control the emotions (De anima\nI.5, 94; IV.4, 54–56, 59). \nThe sensory commanding faculty is divided into concupiscible and\nirascible parts. The reactions of the concupiscible power are desires\nfor things taken to be pleasurable, and the reactions of the irascible\npower are desires to defeat adversaries and repel harmful things\n(De anima I.5, 83; IV.4, 56–57). The objects of\nemotions are recognized as emotionally relevant by the estimative\npower. By this power, the sheep judges that the wolf is to be avoided,\n“even though the exterior sense has not previously perceived\nit”. Avicenna calls the representations of the estimative power\n“intentions”. The recognition of the intentions is often\ninstinctive in animals, but it is mostly conscious and\npre-intellectually conceptual in humans (De anima I.5, 86,\n89; IV.1, 7; IV.3. 37–39; see also Black 2000; Hasse 2000: 130–141: Perler 2012). As an occurrent\nemotion involves acts of separate faculties, there must be some kind\nof governing awareness which combines these acts (De anima\nV.7, 158–159; Kitāb al-najāt 2.6.15, trans. Rahman, 64–68); cf. Toivanen and Yrjönsuuri 2014:\n441–442). \nAvicenna’s theory includes all elements of Aristotelian\ncompositional theory, but he uses the behavioral suggestion as the\ncentral factor. For this reason, he does not include pleasure or joy\namong the concupiscible or irascible emotions, regarding them as\naffective apprehensive acts. Somewhat strangely, he adds pain or\ndistress to the irascible motive acts such as fear and anger,\napparently thinking that they are moving acts and not merely\napprehensive (De anima IV.4, 57–59). \nWhile there are emotions common to humans and animals, the human\nestimative faculty is also a sensory reason, which qualifies its\nrecognizing emotional intentions. Hope and fear with respect to not\nyet actualized future things, shame at wrong action, and wonder at\nunusual things presuppose conceptualization that animals lack. It is\nalso human to express wonder by laughing and anxiety by weeping\n(De anima V.1, 69–76). Avicenna discusses emotions also\nin his Canon of Medicine, translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the\ntwelfth century. His medical approach to the cardiac and spiritual\naffects shows similarities to that of the Pantegni. See Knuuttila 2004. \nEarly medieval medical theory of the emotions concentrated on the\nGalenic ideas of the humors and the system of the spirits, the\nvitalizing spirits in the heart and the psychic spirits in the nerves\nand the brain. In the Pantegni (Theor. VI.110–114), the physical\naspects of the emotions were dealt with as slow or quick movements of\nthe vital spirits towards the heart or away from it. (See also the translation by Stephen of Antioch, V.38, p. 69.) This led to a\npopular medical classification of emotions: \nJohn of la Rochelle, a Franciscan theologian, referred to this scheme\nas a commonly known model in his Summa de anima (1235 [1995:\n262]). It was presented as a table with brackets in the\nsixteenth-century handbook of Jacob Wecker, Medicinae utriusque\nsyntaxes [1576, I.3, p. 181]. For a fourteenth-century formulation,\nsee Maino de Maineri, Regimen sanitatis 3.8, Paris 1506, f.\n38v. (Cf. Gil-Sotres 1994.)  \nAvicenna’s account of emotions was addressed in Dominicus\nGundisalvi’s De anima, which consisted to a great\nextent of texts from the Latin translation of Avicenna’s De\nanima by Gundisalvi and Avendauth. Almost half of\nGundisalvi’s quotations from Avicenna’s account of the\nsensitive motive acts concern the relationship between the\nconcupiscible and irascible powers and the changes in the heart and\nthe spirits. These were found interesting by the early\nthirteenth-century Latin authors John Blund and David of Dinant. They\ntook the medical account of the physical aspect of emotions as\ncausally primary, somewhat similarly to the James-Lange theory of\nemotions, but this was not an influential view (John Blund,\nTractatus de anima, 25.380; David of Dinant, Fragmenta\nQuaternulorum, 36–39, 67–68). \nTwelfth-century taxonomical discussions pertained to the division\nbetween concupiscible and irascible emotions, which proved to be\ncumbersome to many authors. A more simple but influential division is\nfound in the small treatise on the nature of love by Hugh of St. Victor\n(d. 1141), in which he defined love (amor) as a pleasure of\nthe heart which is directed to an object because of that object. It is\nfirst a directed affection (affectio) which becomes desire\n(desiderium) when it moves the subject towards the object and\njoy (gaudium) when the longing finds its fulfilment (De\nsubstantia dilectionis 82, 86). A similar tripartite sequence of\nappetitive acts was used in thirteenth-century classifications of\nconcupiscible passions. In his The Twelfth Patriarchs,\nRichard of St. Victor (d. 1173) operates with a list of seven\nemotions which is not found in other authors: hope, fear, joy,\ndistress, love, hatred, and shame (see Palmén 2014).  \nIsaac of Stella (d. 1177), a Cistercian theologian, presented an\nAugustinian classification which combined the Stoic fourfold table\nwith Platonist concepts as follows \n(Isaac of Stella, Letter on the Soul, 1878d, trans. in McGinn\n1977). Isaac’s classification was quoted in the influential\ntwelfth-century pseudo-Augustinian treatise De spiritu et\nanima (782; cf. 814, trans. in McGinn 1977) and through it in\nPhilip the Chancellor’s Summa de bono (748–749).\nBefore Isaac, the Stoic classification of emotions and the Platonic\ndivision of the soul were presented together in William of St. Thierry’s De natura corporis et animae (trans. in\nMcGinn 1977), without an explanation of how they are related to each\nother (2.88–91). Distress is an irascible emotion in\nIsaac’s classification, as in Avicenna, but Isaac was influenced\nby the Latin tradition in which concupiscible emotions are directed to\ngood objects and irascible to harmful ones (Knuuttila 2004: 229).\nWilliam of St. Thierry writes that anger and love are good irascible\ndispositions of a pious soul and match together because of the fervor\nof love and the hatred of vices. Bernard of Clairvaux similarly\nclassified joy and anger as irascible passions. (Opera V,\n358–359). For the Cistercian list of affects, see also Boquet\n2005. \nThese considerations show some uncertainty about how to combine\nvarious classificatory ideas. When Aristotle’s account became\nbetter known in the early thirteenth century, it was realized that the\ntwelfth-century divisions between concupiscible and irascible emotions\nwere not compatible with Aristotle’s idea of the contrary\nemotions of the same part of the soul. (See John Blund’s\nsomewhat complicated attempt to solve this problem in Tractatus de\nanima 18–22.) An influential new taxonomic idea was\nintroduced as a solution in the 1220s. (See the anonymous treatises\nDe anima et potentiis eius, 47–48, and De potentiis\nanimae et obiectis, 159, 164, as well as Philip the Chancellor,\nSumma de bono, 161). It was held that the objects of the\ncontrary concupiscible acts were simply pleasurable or painful, and\nthe objects of the irascible acts were also arduous (arduum),\ndifficult to obtain or to avoid. \nA detailed early thirteenth-century classification on the basis of the\nnotion of arduum with contrary emotions was developed in John\nof la Rochelle’s Summa de anima. He regarded emotions\nas the acts of two moving powers, the concupiscible and irascible,\nboth with several types of reaction divided into contrary pairs. The\nconcupiscible pairs are associated with the contrary dispositions of\nliking (placentia) or disliking (displicentia) and\nirascible emotions with strength (corroboratio) and weakness\n(debilitas). These correspond to different types of\nestimative acts which are their causes. The new systematic idea was to\nuse these dispositions of feeling and corresponding behavior reactions\nas classificatory principles. The emotions of the concupiscible power\nare classified as follows: \nPity and envy were treated as different forms of other-regarding\ndistress in Nemesius of Emesa (c. 19) and John Damascene (c. 28); for\npity, compassion and mercy, see also Aquinas, Summa theologiae\nII-2, 30. Love as liking with respect to another person’s\nprosperity was also a traditional characterization (cf. Aristotle,\nRhet. II.4). The somewhat less used idea of hate as liking\nwith respect to another person’s troubles was included in Calcidius’s Latin list of emotions in his commentary on the  Timaeus (216–217). Liking and disliking were also used as principles in\nRadulfus Ardens’s late twelfth-century classification that\notherwise was closer to the approach of Isaac of Stella (Speculum\nuniversale, book V). \nOf irascible emotions with the “arduous and difficult\nobjects”, ambition and hope pertain to future honor and\nprosperity, hope involving the belief that they will be achieved. The\nopposites of these are poverty of spirit and desperation. Three emotions,\npride, lust for power, and contempt, are associated with attempts to\nstrengthen one’s social rank and power. The opposite of pride\nand lust for power is humility, and the opposite of contempt is\nreverence. Of the acts directed towards evil things, courage is a\ndesire to meet the enemy with confidence, anger is a desire for\nrevenge, and magnanimity is rising up against evil. Three forms of the\nflight from evil are somehow opposites of courage: penitence toward\npast evil things, impatience with present evil things, and fear of\nfuture evil things. \nSee Summa de anima, 256–262; Knuuttila 2004:\n230–236; Knuuttila 2016. A more theological discussion of concupiscible and\nirascible emotions is found in William of Auvergne’s roughly\ncontemporary De virtutibus, chs. 16–18. For a twelfth-century treatise on pride and humility, see Bernard of Clairvaux, On the Degrees of Humility and Pride (Opera III, 13–59). \n \nFollowing Avicenna’s faculty psychology and the new division\nbetween concupiscible and irascible emotions, Albert the Great and\nThomas Aquinas treated emotions as acts of the sensory moving powers.\nWhile Albert employed the Stoic-based classifications of Nemesius of\nEmesa and John Damascene in his works (De homine q.\n66–67; De bono 3.5.2–3), Thomas Aquinas put\nforward a new taxonomy (Summa theologiae II-1, 22–48)\nwhich was probably influenced by John of la Rochelle. Albert argued\nthat emotions should be regarded as qualities as Aristotle described\nthem in Categories 8 (De bono 3.5.1, 3.5.3). Aquinas\ndefended the characterization of them as movements of the soul,\nfinding the basic classificatory principles of emotions in\nAristotle’s doctrine of contrary movements in Physics\nV.5. Bonaventure differed from these authors in relativizing the\ndifference between sensory and intellectual moving powers and\nattributing emotions to the intellectual soul in a proper sense and\nnot merely metaphorically as was traditionally done. In addressing the\nsoul of Christ in the third book of his Commentary on the\nSentences, Bonaventure argues that there were concupiscible and\nirascible parts in Christ’s intellectual will as well as\npassions of joy and distress. Similar ideas were also put forward\nearlier in the so-called Summa Halensis (Bonaventure,\nSent. III.16.2.1 (354); III.33.1.3 (717); see also Prentice\n1957; Vaura 2017). Even though Bonaventure’s account remained\nsketchy, it influenced the Franciscan view of the emotions of the will\nthat came to be more systematically analyzed by John Duns Scotus. \nIn discussing emotions in Summa theologiae II-1.22–48,\nAquinas first divided them in terms of their generic objects: the\nconcupiscible emotions react to what seems good or evil at the sensory\nlevel, whereas the irascible emotions react to arduous sense-good and\nsense-evil. The sensory moving faculties are activated by objects\nthrough cognition, and the modes of the resulting emotional movements\nserve as further qualifications in defining particular emotions. In\nemploying the Avicennian conception of the estimative power that\ngrasps the emotionally relevant aspects of objects, Aquinas says that\nthis could be called particular reason in humans (Summa theologiae I.78.4) The recognizable evaluative property (such as being dangerous) could be called the formal object of emotion (Summa\ntheologiae II-1.43.1; cf. Kenny 1963: 189; King 2011). \nIn his attempt to classify emotions with the help of Aristotle’s\nphysical theory of movements, Aquinas distinguishes between two types\nof the contraries of movements: the approach to something and retreat\nfrom it, and movements associated with contrary endpoints. The\ncontrary movements of the concupiscible power are of the second type,\ntowards contrary ends (sense-good and sense-evil). The contrary\nmovements of the irascible power are of the first type, with respect\nto the same objects. \nAquinas classifies (1) love, (2) desire and (3) pleasure or joy as the\nthree self-regarding concupiscible emotions with respect to the\nsense-good; the contrary movements with respect to sense-evil are (4)\nhate, (5) aversion and (6) pain or distress. As for the irascible\nemotions, the arduous future sense-good may give rise to (7) hope or\n(8) despair, the arduous future sense-evil to (9) fear or (10)\ncourage, and the arduous present sense-evil to (11) anger—this\nis without a contrary pair (Summa theologiae II-1.\n24.2–4, 25.2; see also King 1999.)  \nAquinas’s attempt to combine the Avicennian view of emotions as\nthe act of the sensory moving power with Aristotle’s doctrine of\nmovement involves some theoretical problems. In distinguishing between\nlove, desire and pleasure as the incipient movement, actual movement,\nand rest, Aquinas treats emotions as the behavioral changes that the\nmoving power is supposed to cause rather than the moving acts\nthemselves (Summa theologiae II-1. 25.2; for moving acts, see\n30.2; 23.4.) This is confusing, but he apparently assumes that the\nvarious acts of the moving power could be distinguished as causing\nvarious behavioral movements if these are not prevented. Aquinas also\ndistinguishes between the formal constituent of emotion, which is the\ngeneric content of emotional evaluation, and the material constituent,\nwhich is the particular intentional object, and further between the\nmovements of the moving power that constitute the form of emotions\nwith respect to their material constituents such as the movements of\nthe heart, the spirits and the humors (Summa theologiae II-1.\n28.5, 30.2, 43.1, 44.1). The behavioral movements to which Aristotle’s\nphysics is applied are not mentioned in these contexts. Emotions are\nessentially psychosomatic in Aquinas, and thus not possible for\nbodiless beings such as God and angels (Summa theologiae\nII-1.22.3).  \nAs for pleasure and distress, Aquinas explains that while one might\nspeak about a stone as loving its natural place and desiring to be\nthere, it does not make sense to speak about the pleasure or pain of a\nstone because it does not feel. He holds that pleasure or distress is\na pleasant or unpleasant awareness and this is an aspect of emotions\nin general since some kind of pleasure is involved in positive\nemotions and some kind of pain in negative ones (Summa\ntheologiae II-1.43.1). Giles of Rome, who mostly followed\nAquinas’s taxonomy, remarked that pleasure and distress as\nemotions are states of having moved rather than movements. He also\nwanted to add meekness, an opposite to anger in Aquinas’s\ntaxonomy (see Marmo 1991).  \nAquinas’s discussion of emotions, the most extensive in medieval\nliterature, involves detailed terminological, psychological and\nethical remarks on each emotion type. Like all medieval authors,\nAquinas argues that the intellectual soul should keep emotions under\nstrict control, but he also criticized the Stoic apatheia and Plotinus’s version of the freedom from emotions (Summa theologiae II-1.24.3, 59.2, 61.5). As\nin Aristotle, the virtues of the sensory soul are habits to feel\nemotions in accordance with the judgments of practical reason.\nEmotions themselves do not provide a sufficient guidance for a good\nlife. Aquinas’s theory and taxonomy were very influential until\nthe seventeenth century. (For medieval discussions from Avicenna to\nAquinas, see Knuuttila 2004; for Aquinas, see also\nKing 1999, 2002, 2010, 2011; Lombardo 2011; Miner 2009;\nMurphy 1999; for the discussion of the sensory passions in Christ, see\nGondreau 2002; Madigan 2007.) \nJohn Duns Scotus regarded the taxonomies based on the notion of\narduousness as artificial and criticized the influential Avicennian\nidea that there are “intentions” in things which can be\ngrasped by an estimative power and then move the motive power. He\nargued that representations of a certain kind cause learned or\ninstinctual behavioral changes in some animals and others in others,\nthis being a matter of law-like fact. A sheep naturally flees from a\nwolf which it perceives, not its inner hostility recognized by the\ninner sense as in Avicenna; it even flees from a peaceful sheep which looks like a\nwolf (Ordinatio I.3.1.1–2, p. 43–44; III.15,\n42–43, p. 495–496; III.34, 35–38, p. 193–196;\ncf. Perler 2012). The influential part of Scotus’s approach to\nemotions was his systematic discussion of the Franciscan position of\npostulating the passions of the will, which appears in the discussion\nof the emotions of Christ. This was also where Scotus developed his\ntheory of emotions. According to Scotus, when one is aware of the\nactuality of what was desired or its contrary, “there follows a\npassion of the will, joy or distress, which is caused by the object\npresent in this way”. These passions are not directly caused by\nfree will (Ordinatio III.15, 48, p. 498). Even though joy or\ndistress are acts of the will in the sense of being actual states of\nthe intellectual moving power, they are passions in the sense of\nhaving an external efficient cause and not being free acts of the\nwill. This corresponds to the traditional view of emotions as passive\nreactions.  \nScotus’s longer list of the factors which are sufficient to\ncause distress as a passion of the will involves the apprehension that\nwhat takes place is (1) what one actually wills against, (2) against\nthe natural inclination to happiness (affectio commodi) even\nthough no particular act of will is actual, (3) against sensory\ndesire, (4) in accordance to what is reluctantly willed in\ncircumstances in which the opposite is preferred but cannot be\nachieved (velleitas). There are corresponding factors which\nare sufficient to cause pleasure, the other passion of the will\n(Ordinatio III.15, 60, p. 505). The intellectual soul is\nconsequently regarded as very emotional—its feelings are changed\nby the influence of actual volitions or nolitions as well as by the\ninclinations of the will and the sensory part of the soul. Since these\nstates considerably influence people’s activities as motivations\nor hindrances, moral education should give strength to the natural\ninclination to justice (affectio iustitiae) and good moral\nhabits. New habits of will change the condition for feeling pleasure\nand distress (cf. Boulnois 2003; Knuuttila 2012; Drummond 2012).\nScotus treated liking and disliking (complacentia and\ndisplicentia), the unpremeditated first orientations of the will\nand necessary concomitants of its other acts, as analogous to sensory\nemotional reactions except that they were free acts. These not yet\nefficacious acts could be directly controlled, as distinct from the passions of the will. John Buridan, who otherwise followed\nScotus’s analysis, stated that liking and disliking were not\nfree acts and in this respect were similar to sensory emotions\n(Quaestiones super decem libros Ethicorum, X.2).\nBuridan’s revision increased the number of non-free emotional\nphenomena of the will, but the tendency to apply emotion terminology\nto the will took other forms as well. Ockham followed Scotus’s\nview of pleasure and distress as the passions of the will, though he\nrestricted their conditions to the first and fourth case in\nScotus’s list. But he also explained that “a passion is a form distinct from a cognition, which exists in the\nappetitive power as its subject and requires a cognition for its\nexistence” (Quodlibet II.17, p. 186). \nIf this was a considered view, it made all occurrent volitions\npassions, whether free or not (see Hirvonen 2004; Perler 2017). Is\nOckham speaking about passions or “pseudopassions”? King (2012) and Miner\n(2009) use this term in discussing Aquinas’s remarks on\nvolitions as dispassionate passions. Since Ockham often employed\nScotus’s account of pleasure and distress as the passions of the\nwill, it is possible that his definition of passion was somewhat\nsketchy and not meant to introduce a new semantics for the term\n“passion” after all. However, Adam Wodeham, his younger\ncolleague and collaborator, argues that volitions and nolitions are\nevaluative cognitions to which all human passions can be reduced\nbecause of the unity of the soul. An occurrent volition or nolition\nhas a cognition as a partial cause to which the evaluation pertains.\nThis cognitive account of emotions shows some similarities with the\nStoic theory, but there seems to be no historical connection to it\n(Lectura secunda, prol. q. 1, secs. 2, 5–6; d. 1, q. 5,\nsecs. 4–5, 11; cf. Knuuttila 2004: 275–282; a different\ninterpretation in Pickavé 2012).  \nMany theologians criticized the postulation of the real distinction\nbetween love and pleasure in beatific vision (fruitio) by\nScotus and Ockham who argued for this position because love is a free\nact of the will, but pleasure is not. The opposite view was\nparticularly stressed by Peter Auriol who held that all intellectual\npleasures are free acts of the will and love and pleasure are\nindistinguishable in the fulfilment of beatific vision. Auriol was\nfollowed by Wodeham and Walter Chatton with respect to the fruition,\nbut not with finite objects. Scotus and Ockham offered various\nexamples for the distinction between the fulfilment of love and the\nexperience of pleasure, one of these being the successful action of\nthe evil angel without pleasure (see Kitanov 2014). \nLate medieval philosophical compendia on emotions includes Peter of\nAilly’s influential Tractatus de anima (c. 1380), which\neclectically employs the views of the anonymous thirteenth-century\ncompilation of the views of Albert the Great, Summa\nnaturalium, and Gregory of Rimini’s brief remarks on the\ntheories of Scotus, Ockham, Auriol, and Wodeham on the passions of the\nwill and the relationship between love and pleasure. Ailly’s\nwork was one of the sources for introductions used in psychology\nteaching at the universities such as the Erfurtian treatises by John\nof Lutrea and Bartholomeus Arnoldi of Usingen in the late fifteenth-\nand early sixteenth-century (Kärkkäinen, 2009). Usingen\napplied the Buridanian version of the psychology of \ncomplacentia and displicentia and regarded them as\nnon-accountable first movements (Saarinen 2011: 106–107). John\nGerson’s treatises on emotions included long lists of passions\nclassified under the eleven types of Aquinas’s taxonomy\n(Oeuvres IX, 1–25, 155–61). \nMedieval theories of emotions were also discussed in many influential\nsixteenth-century scholastic works such as Gabriel Biel’s\nCollectorium on Peter Lombard’s Sentences and\nthe commentaries on Aquinas’s Summa theologiae by\nCardinal Cajetan, Bartholomé de Medina, and Francisco\nSuárez, often comparing the theories of Scotus and Aquinas.\nJohn of la Rochelle’s taxonomy of emotions was also known\nthrough a paraphrase in Gregor Reisch’s popular early\nsixteenth-century encyclopedia Margarita philosophica\n(12.4–5). Among the most discussed medieval theories in early\nmodern thought were Aquinas’s taxonomy on emotions and\nScotus’s theory of the passions of the will, both commented on\nby Suárez (King 2002; Knuuttila 2004, 2012).","contact.mail":"simo.knuuttila@helsinki.fi","contact.domain":"helsinki.fi"}]
