His contributions range from a\ncomprehensive account of order in all its various meanings (natural,\nhuman, and divine) to epistemological and methodological directions\nconcerning the progress of knowledge, from an elaborate theory of the\nimmortality of the soul to a sophisticated analysis of the role of\npractical wisdom (prudentia) in such diverse human activities\nas medicine and political action.\n\n\n\nGirolamo Cardano was born in Pavia in 1501 from Fazio and Chiara\nMicheri. Chiara delivered her baby in Pavia, in the house of family\nfriends, and not in Milan, to defuse a possible scandal concerning the\nillegitimate birth. Fazio would marry Chiara and recognize Girolamo\nonly later in 1524, just before his death. After a difficult childhood,\nsaddened by frequent illnesses and the harsh upbringing by his\noverbearing father, Cardano enrolled at the University of Pavia to\nstudy medicine in 1520 against his father’s wish. Fazio\n(1445–1524), a jurist and an accomplished practitioner of mathematics\nand natural philosophy (in 1480 he had published an edition of John\nPeckham’s Perspectiva communis (“General\nOptics”), written around 1265), wanted his son to undertake\nstudies of law, but Girolamo felt more attracted to philosophy and\nscience. When, due to the ongoing war between France and Spain, the\nauthorities in Pavia were forced to close the university, Cardano\nresumed his studies at the University of Padua, where he graduated in\nmedicine in 1526. For about six years, he practised as a physician in\nSaccolungo, a village close to Padua, where he met and married Lucia\nBandareni (1531). Three children were born from this marriage: Giovanni\nBattista (1534), Chiara (1537) and Aldo (1543). In the meantime,\nCardano had been trying several times to become a member of the College\nof Physicians in Milan, but his applications had always been turned\ndown, adding to his professional frustration and disappointment.\nRejections notwithstanding, he moved back to Milan with his family in\n1532. He divided his time between practising medicine in Gallarate, a\ntown nearby Milan, and teaching mathematics in the Piattine schools of\nMilan, a charitable institution founded by the nobleman Tommaso Piatti\nin 1501 to improve knowledge of Greek, logic, astronomy, and mathematics\namong Milanese students from a poor background. Fazio, too, had\npreviously taught in this school. In the meantime, his reputation as a\nsuccessful practitioner in medicine began to spread among the important\nfamilies of Milan. In 1539 his application to become a member of the\nCollege of Physicians was finally accepted. Discontinuously, from 1543\nto 1551, he taught medicine at the University of Pavia, until 1552,\nwhen he went to Scotland to treat the Archbishop of Edinburgh, John\nHamilton, who was suffering from a particularly severe form of asthma.\nBack to Milan in 1553, he resumed teaching in Pavia in 1559. In 1560\nhis son Giovanni Battista was executed charged with the murder of his\nwife, Brandona Seroni, whom, against his father’s will, he had\nmarried in 1557. This tragic event represented a turning point in\nCardano’s life and intellectual career. In 1562, he decided to\nleave Pavia, whose academic environment had become increasingly\nhostile, to teach medicine in Bologna. As a result of mounting\nsuspicions that he was actively spreading heretical views, he was\narrested on 6 October 1570 and remained in prison until 22 December of\nthe same year. In February 1571, before the Sacred Congregation led by\nAntonio Baldinucci, Cardano was required to acknowledge and reject his\nserious crimes against the faith (abiura de\nvehementi), having been declared “vehemently suspect of\nheresy.” He solemnly swore that he would no longer teach and\npublish books until his death. In 1571 he went to Rome to serve as\npersonal physician to Pope Pius V and then Pope Gregory XIII. After\nhaving been admitted to the College of Physicians in 1575, he died in\nRome, on 20 September 1576, devoting his last energies (from September\n1575 to May 1576) to write his autobiography, De vita propria,\npublished posthumously by Gabriel Naudé in 1643. \n\nCardano wrote and published a vast amount of works, in the most\ndisparate fields of knowledge, especially medicine, mathematics,\nastrology and natural history. His strictly philosophical treatises\ninclude: De arcanis aeternitatis (“The Mysteries of\nEternity”, began at the end of the 1530s and published partially\nin the posthumous\nOpera omnia in 1663); De consolatione (“On\nConsolation”, 1543); De sapientia (“On\nWisdom”, 1544); De animi immortalitate (“On the\nImmortality of the Soul”, 1545); De subtilitate\n(“On Subtlety”, 1550, 1554, 1560), and its twin book De\nrerum varietate (“On the Variety of Things”, 1557);\nTheonoston (“Divine Knowledge”, written in the\nmiddle of 1550s and published posthumously in 1617 and 1663); De\nutilitate ex adversis capienda (“On Gaining Advantage from\nMisfortunes”, 1561); Encomium Neronis (“Praise of\nNero”); Dialectica (“Dialectic”), De\nuno (“On the One”), Tetim seu de humana\nconditione (“Tetim, or On the Human Condition”),\nDe minimis et propinquis (“On Those Things which are\nSmallest and Closest to Hand”), De summo bono (“On\nthe Highest Good”) and Guglielmus, sive de\nmorte (“William, or On Death”), all published in 1562;\nAntigorgias dialogus sive de recta vivendi ratione\n(“Anti-Gorgias, or On the Right Way to Live”),\nHyperchen (“Being”) and De Socratis\nstudio (“On the Earnestness of Socrates”), published\nin 1566; Proxeneta, seu de prudentia civili\n(“The Mediator, or Civic Prudence”, published posthumously\nin 1627 and 1663); Paralipomena (“Supplements”,\nbegun in 1561 and published posthumously in 1663). Other works were\npublished posthumously in the Opera omnia edited by the French\nphysician Charles Spon (1609–1684) in 1666: Hymnus, seu\ncanticum ad Deum (“A Hymn, or a Canticle to God”);\nMnemosynon (“Memorial”); Norma vitae\nconsarcinata (“A Patched-Up Rule of Life”); De\noptimo vitae genere (“On the Noblest Kind of Life”);\nDialogus Hieronymi Cardani et Facii Cardani ipsius\npatris (“Dialogue between Girolamo Cardano and His Father\nFazio”); De natura liber unicus (“A Single Book on\nNature”). \n\nGenerally speaking, Cardano’s philosophy is heavily influenced\nby characteristic trends of late scholastic Aristotelianism, with a\nstrong penchant for Averroist interpretations. Cardano shows a great\ninterest in Averroes’ opinion that one intellect would perform\nintellective functions for all human beings. However, he tends to\nprovide a historicized version of this radical view, in that he looks\nat the one intellect as the varying amount of learning accumulated by\nmankind throughout the centuries rather than simply justifying it from\na purely epistemological point of view (seen as the one intellective\npower that actualizes the life and knowledge of the sublunary world as\na whole). Cardano’s philosophy also displays clear traces of\nPlatonic influences, absorbed through the reading of Marsilio\nFicino’s recent translations and commentaries, especially\nPlotinus and Iamblichus. Together with his impressive knowledge of\nastrological and medical literature, both scholasticism and Platonism\ngive a characteristically vitalistic slant to his cosmological views.\nCardano’s philosophy has often been described as suggestive and\nrich in original intuitions, but cluttered and inconsistent as a whole.\nIn fact, his philosophical work is yet another example, common during\nthe Renaissance, of how different philosophical traditions (including\nnot only Aristotelianism and Platonism, but also Epicureanism and\nStoicism, and not only Graeco-Roman, but also Christian and Arabic\nviews) could converge into one composite but coherent picture.\nThroughout his life, from his early endeavours in the 1540s (De\nanimi immortalitate) to the last philosophical attempt\n(Dialogus Hieronymi Cardani et Facii Cardani and\nDe propria vita), Cardano demonstrated a distinctive\ncommitment to a certain number of philosophical issues: the\nrelationship between oneness and multiplicity, with the notable\ncorollaries dealing with order and disorder, determinism and chance,\nlife and decay; the view of the intellect as the ultimate principle of\nreality and knowledge; a general theory of celestial heat, described as\nthe main formative agent in nature; the interplay of nature and the\nsoul in the organization of the universe; a general doctrine of the\nimmortality of the soul, seen as the foundation of both cognitive\nclarity and moral certitude. As a whole, the originality of\nCardano’s eclecticism lies in the unique way in which he\ncharacterizes the interdependence of life, knowledge and matter, in\nwhich a pronounced sense of reality and truth is constantly being\nquestioned and jeopardized by a realistic view of human nature,\nmercilessly presented as prone to fear, delusion and\ndeceit. \n\nCardano’s cosmological views belong to a long-established\nsystem of astro-biological doctrines whose origins go back to\nAristotelian physics, Hippocratic vitalism, and fundamental assumptions\nunderlying the tradition of astrological and meteorological learning,\nreshaped through a series of Hebrew and Arabic mediations. His account\nof the supralunary world combines elements from Neoplatonic philosophy\nand Christian theology. In line with many of his contemporaries,\nCardano maintains that there is a clear division between the\nsupralunary and sublunary world. The life of the universe is the result\nof varying degrees of celestial energy overflowing from the One, i.e.,\nGod. From God to matter, cohorts of the most disparate souls mediate\nbetween these two extremes. From a material point of view, the\nconnective element between heaven and earth is celestial heat. The\nprincipal constituents of the sublunary world are matter (earth, water\nand air), celestial heat, and a wide variety of souls (spanning from\ndemonic minds to substantial forms understood as specific principles of\nlife). \n\nIn line with the principles of Greek ontology (and showing an\nevident interest in the Renaissance recovery of Parmenides’\nphilosophy), Cardano maintains that nothing comes out of nothing;\nrather, all things derive from something, and this something cannot be\ninfinite (Hyperchen, OO, I, 284b; De natura, OO, II,\n284a). Aristotle called this something “hyle or prime\nmatter,” but Cardano prefers to discard this notion of an\nintermediate entity between being and non being, replacing it with the\nview of the elements (earth, water and air) as the material starting\npoint and celestial heat as the efficient active principle, “for\notherwise the elements would be completely redundant if there were\nprime matter” (De natura, OO, II, 284b). The elements,\nwhich represent the first level of organization in matter, are three\n(and not four as demanded by Aristotelian and scholastic physics):\nearth, water and air (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 9a). As\nfor fire, Cardano considers this to be a product of celestial heat,\nwhich is one of the various streams of vital energy flowing from the\nsupralunary sources of life and knowledge and which pervade the\nuniverse as one living organism. Innate heat of a celestial origin is\nthe active element that mediates between the state of utter immobility\nwhich characterizes intelligible substances and the incessant mobility\nthat defines the life of material beings. Through an exercise in\nintrospective analysis, Cardano enumerates three principles that\nregulate both our inner life and the life of all created things: one\n“is moved and does not move, resulting from the heavy\nelements;” another “moves, and it is not moved, that is,\nthe soul;” the third, finally, “is moved by the soul”\nand moves the body, i.e., the innate heat (Theonoston, OO, II,\n304b). To the question of whether the soul can be identified with\ncelestial heat, Cardano replies that, unlike the latter, the former is\nincorporeal, does not occupy any place and therefore is never in\nmotion. Also, that which is in motion does not have that level of\nself-stability that is necessary for a being to be able to perceive\n(sentire) or to think (intelligere)\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 304b). \n\nIn Cardano’s metaphysics, matter and form are complementary,\nin that in nature there cannot be matter without form, and forms are\nalways with a body. Forms represent the primordial stage in the process\nthrough which the created universe becomes one living being. The\ndifference between souls and forms is that souls, albeit involved in\nthe animation of bodies, remain nevertheless unaffected by corporeal\nreality. Up on a higher level, minds are souls that are completely\nindependent of matter, bodies and motion. However, even within the\nontological sphere of the minds, there are varying degrees of\nembodiment. While the highest celestial intelligences are wholly\nseparated from the material cosmos, demonic substances, albeit\nincorporeal, can affect the corporeal world through forces\n(vires) and influences (influxus) of various kind.\nOne of these is “that force which is connected to demons,\nregardless of whether this power is corporeal and depends on humours,\nor it is incorporeal.” Cardano maintains that it is through\nforces of this nature that “the parts of the universe are aroused\nby demons, stars or some other hidden cause”\n(Paralipomena, in OO, X, 446b–447a. See also De\nsubtilitate, OO, III, 670a). The principle that in a way collects\nand administers all these currents of celestial energy is the soul of\nthe world (anima mundi). In Cardano’s system of\nastro-biological determinism, the universal soul keeps the whole cosmos\ntogether and performs paramount operations in accordance with the\noriginal plan devised by God and implemented by the planetary\nintelligences, for “all things are influenced by the higher\nheaven and are moved at the command of the soul of the world.”\nThe soul of the world, which “cannot be understood without\nGod,” directs the work of nature, and, “in the process of\ngenerating things, produces supercelestial lives and\nmultiplicity” (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). In\nthe sublunary world, the major operations of life and generation are\nperformed by nature, understood as a source of teleological activity\nsupervised by the intellect and the soul of the world (De\nsubtilitate, OO, III, 360a; ed. Nenci, 63). The complex\nrelationship between soul and nature, and the role played by celestial\nforces, is a crucial point in Cardano’s philosophy (On\nCardano’s cosmological views, see Ingegno 1980, 1–78, 209–271;\nMaclean 1984; Grafton 1999). \n\nRegarding the hierarchical arrangement of the ontological\nprinciples, there is a certain oscillation in the way Cardano\ndistributes them along the various degrees of being, but by and large\nwe can say that God understood as the One represents the ultimate\nsource of order and activity in the universe, and all the rest emanates\nfrom it in the form of increasingly more plural and less integrated\nentities, from intellects to souls, from the soul of the world to\nindividual souls, from the soul to nature, from celestial to earthly\nanimals, from forms to scattered matter. In De arcanis\naeternitatis, Cardano lists fourteen genera of beings, a number\nthat, in his opinion, “matches the structure of the\nuniverse:” three elements (earth, water, air), celestial heat,\nstones, plants, living creatures generated from putrescent matter\n(animantia ex putredine), quadrupeds, birds, fish,\nreptiles, human beings, demons, and God (De arcanis\naeternitatis, OO, X, 8b). \n\nHigher animals are divided into four main classes: quadrupeds,\nbirds, fish and reptiles. In the diagram he attaches to his discussion,\n“the nature of the animals is connected to the human one only in\none point,” which is located in the area corresponding to the\nquadrupeds. See Figure 1: Figure 1. However, the margin of interaction between human beings and the\nrest of living creatures is ampler. In keeping with a number of\nRenaissance philosophers, Cardano maintains that man is at the centre\nof micro- and macro-cosmic exchanges within the universe: “since\nthe human circle corresponds to each single part of the whole domain\nof living beings, all the properties and natures that can be found in\nliving beings will also be present in human beings” (De\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 8a). In\nParalipomena, Cardano defines the human species as an amalgam\nof forms (tota humana species congeries quaedam est),\na “mass” that is in constant evolution (succrescit\natque decrescit): \n\nHuman nature includes all the forms of nonhuman nature, but they lie\ndormant, as it were, in a state of virtual energy. Cardano always pays\nspecial attention to those aspects of human nature that seem to\nindicate a close link with animals and lower forms of life.\nUnsurprisingly, comparative analyses between humans and animals abound\nin his works. Among the questions dealing with the relationships\nbetween human and nonhuman animals, Cardano is particularly interested\nin exploring whether reason is an exclusive prerogative of human beings\nor it should rather be seen as the result of biological development\n(De natura, OO, II, 283b–284a). \n\nAbove nonhuman and human animals, Cardano posits a universe teeming\nwith the most diverse kinds of incorporeal minds. He acknowledges that\nto count the number of celestial substances populating the supralunary\nworld would go way beyond the power of reason; and yet Denis the\nPseudo-Areopagite, “relying on Platonic arguments and the visions\nof St Paul” divided them into nine orders. Within these orders\nCardano identifies “seven natures.” The first nature is the\n“the infinite, or God,” eternal in itself. The second\nnature is “the soul of all things or lives,” which\nrepresents the first breaking up of the original unity; then comes the\nalready mentioned soul of the world, whose loss of ontological unity\nand independence begins to manifest itself, being “one principle\nresulting out of many and eternal ones because of something\nelse’s intervention.” The fourth nature is the soul which\nmoves the universe, the primum movens, not eternal in itself,\nbut through eternal temporal succession. The fifth nature, the souls of\nthe various planets, derives from the combined action of this primary\nmover and the soul of the world. Various orders of souls emanates from\nthe fifth nature: “heroic” souls, minds that are capable of\nhaving sense perceptions (mentes sensiles) and the\nsoul that presides over all sentient lives (communis\nsensilis). This last type of soul divides itself not only into\nindividual beings, but also into parts, “for everything is\nalive.” The next nature, therefore, the sixth one – the\n“common and vital soul” (anima communis atque\nvitalis) – belongs to plants, lower animals and the\nelements. The last order is “the soul conceived in matter,”\nwhich “Plato called idea,” and Cardano simply characterizes\nas “life.” Relying on later Platonic authors, from\nIamblichus to Denis the Pseudo-Areopagite, Cardano describes the\nuniverse as one single entity, seamlessly interrelated throughout its\nvital expanse, placed between the two extremes of God, absolute\neternity and unity, and matter, the domain of absolute transience and\nmultiplicity (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X,\n6ab). \n\nOne of the most complex questions in Cardano’s philosophy as a\nwhole concerns the relationship between nature and the soul. This is a\npoint where Cardano’s multiple allegiances (scholastic\nAristotelianism, Plotinian Platonism, medicine and astrology) come to\nthe fore. Inevitably, it is also an area where not a few frictions\namong different traditions come to the fore. Among Cardano’s\ndesiderata there was the plan to devote a specific philosophical\ntreatise to the notion of nature. It is an unfinished work that in all\nlikelihood he sketched at the beginning of the 1560s, De natura\nliber unicus. It can be seen as part of a series of treatises\ndevoted to the exploration of the most recondite aspects of the\nnatural, supernatural and moral worlds (De libris propriis,\nOO, I, 119; ed. Maclean, 293). De natura demonstrates\nCardano’s lifelong engagement with notions of naturalism,\nuniversal animation, and teleology. The discussion is opaque at times\nbecause of the topic’s difficulty, the characteristic obscurity\nof Cardano’s disjointed and elliptical writing, and the\nprecarious condition of the text, left unfinished, with several gaps\nand marks of typographical sloppiness (typos, mistakes, and missing\nwords). On the other hand, being a monographic treatment of the meaning\nof nature, the treatise holds great significance, all the more so\nbecause, as Cardano explains, the investigation of nature\n(inquisitio naturae) sheds light on the very origin\nof things, including human beings (De natura, OO, II, 283a).\nIn this sense, fragmentary as it may be, Cardano’s De\nnatura is an attempt to outline the ultimate principles of reality\n(on the relationship between natural and supernatural phenomena in\nCardano, see Siraisi 1997, 149–173). \n\nCardano’s notion of order has strong Platonic overtones. Unity\nis a mark of perfection, for all things rejoice in unity and they are\nin a better condition when they reach that level of unity that\nactualizes their potential nature. Unity gives structure and purpose\nto all the elements that make up the system of nature: “order\nand fate, since they are one, and exist with respect to the One, are\ngood; disorder and luck are bad, for they do not strive towards\nunity” (De uno, OO, I, 277b; ed. García\nValverde, 4). As an expression of unity and goodness, order is so\npervasive that in fact accounts for even the most haphazard and\ndisorderly aspects of reality.  Cardano maintains that multiplicity\nand diversity can always be brought back to potentially ordered series\nof individual elements (multitudo ordinata)\n(De uno, OO, I, 281ab; ed. García Valverde, 24; De\nnatura, OO, II, 283a). What we perceive as beauty (decus)\nand elegance (ornamentum) in nature is not due to scattered\nvariety (multitudo), but to a principle of ordered unity,\n“the one in the many,” which produces feelings of harmony\nand symmetry in us (De uno, OO, 280a; ed. García\nValverde, 20). The same principle of order and unity applies to\nknowledge: we can say that we really know something when we manage to\nrelate all the aspects and properties of this thing to one cause.\nAccording to Cardano, Plotinus followed the same approach in moral\nphilosophy, for he described his notion of happiness as a return to the\nOne (De uno, OO, I, 281b; ed. García Valverde, 24). \n\nAmong the sources of unity and order in the universe, souls play a\nmost significant role. As we have seen in the previous section, souls\nare at the center of Cardano’s cosmos. Being immaterial, they are\n“a unitary principle that is not continuous, nor contiguous, but\nexists of its own, not in a place, nor in a time.” Unlike life\n(vita), which is diffused everywhere and therefore cannot be\nsaid to be a real principium, souls have no spatial and\ntemporal limitation and are nowhere (nullibi) to be found\nbecause of their incorporeal nature (De uno, OO, I, 279a;\nGarcía Valverde, 12). While souls are one and individual\neverywhere (“our soul is no less here than in the sky, no less in\nItaly than in India”), bodies are different and manifold\ndepending on material circumstances and vital urges, for\n“division of bodies is determined by the needs of life (vitae\ncommodum)” (Paralipomenon, OO, X, 446a). Given the\ncentral role assigned to the soul, in all its forms, Cardano’s\nphilosophy of nature is inevitably exposed to charges of animism and\nanthropomorphism. The issue is accentuated by the fact that the human\nbeing represents for Cardano a model of rationality and teleological\nactivity. \n\nFor Cardano, human souls are individual principles of\nself-awareness. Selfhood is the principal argument in favour of their\nimmortality. However, in defending the immortal character of human\nsouls, Cardano also relies on proofs of a more pragmatic and\ntheological nature. Hope in “the immortality of the soul”\nwas implanted in human beings by God, therefore it cannot be considered\nas a deluded expectation. In common people God instilled this hope\n“through religions (leges),” in wise people,\n“through the hidden truths (arcana) of\nphilosophy.” However, when God provided human beings with hope\nfor immortal life, He decided to give them a feeble certainty, always\nin need of confirmation. The reason, according to Cardano, is that a\nfirm belief in the immortality of the soul would have created too wide\na gap between humans and animals, while leading man into arrogant\ndelusions of grandeur. There has always been and – “as long\nas there is a world” – there always will be an alternation\n(vicissitudo) of confirmations and doubts concerning the\nimmortality of the soul. It is a “vicissitude” of hopes and\ndespair that is part of the providential regime of the world\nestablished by God (De utilitate ex adversis capienda, OO, II,\n26a). Hope in the immortality of the soul is also a fundamental\npostulate in Cardano’s moral philosophy. As we will see in the\nnext section, Cardano maintains that true inner tranquillity depends,\namong other things, on virtue, wisdom, and “hope in the\ngods.” Otherwise, what is passed off as tranquillity is in fact\nmere harshness and stiffness (duritia) (Theonoston,\nOO, II, 303b, 305b, 308a, 312a). \n\nThe One (God), the ordered variety of nature (multitudo\nordinata), and the soul represent the main ontological\ncoordinates in Cardano’s view of the cosmos. The universe is\norganized according to a plurality of orders, arranged along\nhierarchical levels, but harmoniously attuned to each other. It is not\ncorrect, in Cardano’s opinion, to say that everything is for the\nsake of everything else (non omnia propter omnia), but rather\nthat everything is for the sake of one thing (omnia\npropter unum). This means that the One toward which everything\nelse converges includes many orders, “different among each\nother.” Nature, art and chance produce a variety of causal\nsequences that often intersect and are more or less perfect depending\non the extent to which the end to be actualized prevails over\nrefractory matter. With respect to natural causes, some are universal,\nothers specific. Among the universal causes of action, the most\nimportant are the stars, which act over the sublunary world through\ninfluences conveyed by light, heat and motion (De uno, OO, I,\n279, 281; ed. García Valverde, 12, 26). More specific and\nindividual sources of natural agency are demonic and human minds, which\nadd to the complexity of moral and political action. \n\nAt its deepest, the principle of unity and order coincides with God.\nGod is infinite, necessary, wholly undivided, therefore individual. In\nkeeping with the principles of theological Trinitarianism, God is\ndescribed by Cardano in terms of power (potestas), mind\n(mens), and love (amor), and these attributes are not\n“three gods, as Plotinus thinks,” but original divine\nattributes. The natural world is a constant reminder that God’s\n“threefold and undivided life” flows into each single\nthing, down to the smallest beings (ad minima usque) (De\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). However, for all the layers and\nmediations that characterize Cardano’s universe, the distance\nbetween human beings and God remains unbridgeable. Man cannot reconcile\nthe finite with the infinite, for “no finite thing can be\ntransformed into an infinite nature.” Cardano rules out that\n“this life of ours can get close to that which truly is,”\nfor there is no proportion and no resemblance between the two levels of\nbeing. Echoing Cusanian motifs, he argues that “everything that\nis understood by a finite being is finite, for the act of understanding\n(comprehensio) occurs through some proportion; but there is no\nproportion between the infinite and the finite.” Likewise, our\neyes cannot grasp the direct light (lux) of the sun, but only\na glimpse of its brightness (lumen) (De arcanis\naeternitatis, OO, X, 4b–5a). Such a powerful and all-encompassing\nview of divine and natural order, in which the presence of latent\nPlatonic and Averroist motifs contributes to strengthen the cogent\norganization of the whole universe, has inevitable repercussions\nconcerning the meaning of moral action. During his life, Cardano\ndevoted a considerable number of works to ethical inquiries, surveying\nalmost every aspect in the field: theoretical ethics, applied ethics,\nprudential behaviour, consolation, education, and the role of rhetoric.\nHowever, his most important contribution to moral philosophy consists\nin his attempt to redefine the relationship between the universal scope\nof practical reason and the need for human beings to apply moral laws\nto the concrete circumstances of their life. This characteristic\ntension between knowledge and application is particularly evident in\ntwo works: Theonoston (which Cardano began to write around\n1555) and De utilitate ex adversis capienda (published in\n1561). \n\nCardano presents De utilitate and Theonoston as\ncomplementary treatises aimed at implementing two different approaches\nin moral philosophy, the former based on the ordinary circumstances of\nhuman life (humanitus), the latter assuming the existence of\nsupernatural conditions such as immortal individual souls and the\neffects of divine providence (divinitus). They outline two\ndifferent paths towards the achievement of the same end: lasting\nhappiness. While the ethical program devised in De utilitate\nis designed to face situations of obvious emergency (quae oculis\nipsis subjacent) concerning human affairs (humanae\nres), Theonoston provides an account of the\nimmortality of the soul (enarratio immortalitatis\nanimi) that has momentous ethical consequences (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 8, 39a; Theonoston, OO, II, 299b). The\nsame duplicity of levels is evident in the way Cardano examines the\nnotion of “tranquillity,” which represents the highest\npoint in one’s virtuous behaviour: one type of tranquillity is\npremised on the attainment of a certain level of “honorable and\nmoderate pleasure,” the other secures a decent degree of\nhappiness “even in the greatest calamities”\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 310b). Here it is worth pointing out that\nCardano’s pragmatic approach to questions of moral philosophy\nworks on both levels, the rational and the empirical. In the final\nanalysis, tranquillity is for Cardano the most useful thing that may\nhappen to a human being, for it provides inner joy, long life, and a\nmore robust kind of wisdom. \n\nDespite the emphasis he places on the benefits of prudent action,\nCardano believes that real, lasting happiness can be possible only if\nwe demonstrate in a persuasive way that the human soul is immortal and\nthat God intervenes actively in the human world, sanctioning a\nprovidential regime of the world. Two principles, more than any other,\nunderlie Cardano’s moral philosophy: that the human soul is\nimmortal, and that universal order, being a direct emanation of the\nOne, governs all aspects of reality. Everything that happens has been\nplanned by God, and all that God has established can only be good.\nRegarding the immortality of the soul, Cardano maintains that, in order\nto lead a meaningful existence and act accordingly, people need to know\nwhether there is life after death and whether the nature of their\nafterlife will depend on the way they behaved in this world. In his\nopinion, Aristotle and the Stoics took the value of virtue for granted.\nIn actual life, human beings will never be persuaded that virtue should\nbe pursued for its own sake, unless they are convinced that their soul\nis immortal (De utilitate, OO, II, 3). In this sense, Cardano\ndefends the immortality of the soul on strong pragmatic grounds.\nReferring to Seneca’s renowned instructions on how to cope with\nthe thought of death, he points out that meditating about death while\nmaintaining that the soul is mortal is simply absurd. In his eyes,\nSeneca is a bad rhetorician and an Epicurean in disguise, who exhorts\nus to die serenely while claiming that there is nothing after death\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 10a; see Giglioni 2012, 187). \n\nAs we have seen while examining his natural philosophy,\nCardano’s moral views assign a central role to the soul:\n“The soul is the most important thing we own; everything refers\nto it, for riches, honors, and health are nothing without a sound\nsoul” (De utilitate, OO, II, 10a). Mental\nself-awareness, in particular, is the principal argument through which\nCardano advocates the immortality of the soul, for a human being is the\nsame thing as his mind (homo animus est) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 12; on Cardano’s notion of the mind, see\nGiglioni 2005–2007; García Valverde 2013). The same emphasis on\nmental awareness can be found in Cardano’s moral investigations,\nfor in his opinion human beings cannot understand what the ends of\ntheir actions are if they lack a clear knowledge of themselves (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 2). The highest good for them can only lie in\nthose attributes and activities that are part of their minds (quae\nanimo coniuncta sunt) (De utilitate, OO, II, 27a). In\nthis sense, the relationship between tranquillity and awareness is\nbiunique: human beings can be peaceful only when they know what the\nhighest good is and know that they have attained it\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 303b). According to the Hermit’s\ndefinition of tranquillity in Theonoston,\ntranquillitas coincides with securitas, that is, a\ncondition of unbreakable inner peace, free from cares and anxiety, and\nit is a level of wisdom that would even suit God. In this respect, true\ntranquillity for human beings coincides with their being\n“assimilated” to God, so that, when this condition of\nserenity is reached, nothing is any longer felt as lacking in meaning\nand substance. This level of happiness is a “kind of\npleasure” that derives from the awareness of “being in the\npossession of goods” (Theonoston, OO, II, 302a; De\noptimo vitae genere, OO, I, 488b). Intellectual pleasure should\nnever be a monstrum, that is to say, a hybrid creature\nresulting from combining the goods of reason with those of the body and\nexternal luck (Theonoston, OO, II, 313b–314a). \n\nBy doing so, Cardano provides a definition of happiness which is\ninclusive of both knowledge and pleasure. Happiness consists in a\n“perception of pleasure” that is great (magna),\nfull (plena), pure (pura), untroubled\n(secura), and safe (tuta) (De utilitate, OO,\nII, 37b; Theonoston, OO, II, 305b; De libris\npropriis, OO, I, 76b; ed. Maclean, 212–213). In\nTheonoston, happiness is said to coincide with a kind of inner\ncomposure understood not in terms of lack of sensibility\n(indolentia), but as a condition of mental vigour stemming\nfrom the contemplation of the true nature of things. If tranquillity\nconsisted in mere refractoriness to unsettling experiences, the\nimpassive state of a stone should then be viewed as the best condition\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 299b, 305b, 313b). By contrast, ethical\npeace rests on a state of cognitive tension and focus. In ways that\nremind us of the sea and the air, undisturbed calm (tranquilla\nquies) is always accompanied by a current of “light\nmotion,” i.e., a state of balance between opposite conditions\n“which does not unsettle, but delights us.” Cardano’s\ntranquillitas is therefore not the same as absolute rest:\n“in its state of highest tranquillity, our soul is as it were\ntremulous and breathing” (Theonoston, OO, II, 300a,\n305b). The incessant vitality of our being demonstrates that “the\nmatter we are made of, being of a celestial origin, produced and\nentwined with motion, does not enjoy rest, but thrives on\nmotion,” a motion that, in the final analysis, is no bodily\nactivity, but an expression of knowledge and intellect\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 304a). True tranquillity results from a\ncondition of inviolable self-fulfilment (securitas) based on\nresources that are in our power (in nostra potestate esse).\nCardano is not convinced by the Senecan view of tranquillity as a\nbalanced active life (vita actuosa), or by Socrates’s\nkind of ‘engaged’ tranquillity; in both cases, their\nbehaviour is for Cardano symptomatic of ambition rather than being the\nindication of a truly committed philosophical life\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 306b). Finally, Cardano rejects the\nideals of tranquillity championed by Plutarch, Antoninus and Cicero,\nviewed as models of ethical escapism devised by men who in their life\nnever managed to reach a condition of stable serenity\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 305a). \n\nIn outlining his views about the nature of the good, Cardano is\nfollowing a deliberately eclectic approach. He combines the Stoic\nconception of virtue with Epicurus’ emphasis on indifference\n(indolentia), Aristotle’s notion of virtuous life with\nAverroes’ characterization of happiness as the highest level of\nknowledge accessible to human beings. He justifies his eclectic\nposition by arguing that philosophers who were so clever in their\nfields are likely to have come up with closely related ideas and that\ntherefore “two or more of their opinions can converge into\none” (De utilitate, OO, II, 24b). From Socrates, for\ninstance, Cardano draws the principle that only wise people can be\ntruly happy because virtue lies in knowledge (De utilitate,\nOO, II, 90b). From medical authors, he borrows the view that pleasure\nalways follows release from a condition of tension or pain (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 28a). Following traditional argumentative\npatterns in moral philosophy, Cardano distinguishes among goods of the\nmind (virtues), goods of the body (health, longevity), and goods of\nfortune. Among the goods of fortune, Cardano lists finding the right\nwife, a lasting fame, and a painless death (De utilitate, OO,\nII, 19b). Goods of the body, such as enjoying good health and following\na healthy regimen, are also part of one’s happiness (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 19a; on Cardano’s notion of health, see\nSiraisi, 70–90). \n\nStrictly speaking, goods and ills are values. As such, they\ntranscend the level of nature and therefore cannot be treated as if\nthey were natural or against nature: “Goods and ills reside in\nthe soul; faculties and defects in the body; helps and impediments in\nfortune and its occurrences” (Theonoston, OO, II, 314b).\nIn general terms, Cardano defines the good as “what is longed for\nby the majority of human beings,” such as health, wealth,\nfriends, glory, offspring and wisdom. In a more specific sense\n(simpliciter), good is what is everlasting\n(perpetuum), safe (securum), and unchangeable\n(immutabile) (De utilitate, OO, II, 23ab). In order\nto achieve a stable condition of inner peace people need to commit to a\ngood that cannot be taken away from them. Ultimately, since only God\nhas all the requisites to be this kind of imperishable good, the more\ngenuine meaning of good is that which brings us closer to God or make\nus similar to Him (Theonoston, OO, II, 307b–308a, 313b). The\ndifference between human beings and God is that in God the good\n(bonum) coincides entirely with self-preservation (vita\nincolumis), whereas in human beings these two conditions are\ngenerally separate. Human beings need to take care of their life and\naim at a life that is marked by reason. There cannot be any discourse\non happiness where the primary requisites for life are lacking (due to\nmental illness or death) (Theonoston, OO, II, 309b). \n\nGoods of the mind are virtues. By virtue, Cardano means the\nprinciple that teaches human beings to behave in the best way towards\nGod, animals and our fellow human beings. Hence the key virtues are\nsense of duty (pietas), compassion (humanitas), and\nkindness (benignitas) (Theonoston, OO, II, 312ab).\nGiven their importance, virtues are among the foundations of human\naction: “by its nature, virtue is eternal and a divine good in\nus; all the rest rots in time and depends on circumstances”\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 21a. See ibid., 38b) . Emanating from\nthe innermost part of our rational soul, virtues have the power to\nretroact on our mind, thus fortifying and safeguarding its faculties.\nThe most prophylactic among virtues are fortitude, prudence and\nmoderation, and they result from the combined actions of nature, habit\nand reason, establishing a delicate balance between control of natural\nimpulses (impetus naturae), education, and the process of\ndecision making. \n\nAs already said, Cardano’s moral philosophy rests on a series of\ninterrelated principles which also play a key foundational role in\nnatural philosophy: that the soul is immortal; that incorporeal lives\nare everlasting; and that mental awareness is the defining\ncharacteristic of the soul. Since the intellect is the only thing that\nhumans can boast about themselves as being truly immortal,\nintellectual self-knowledge is regarded by Cardano as the highest good\nthat a human being may ever attain. Inevitably, this assumption\nre-proposes the Averroist conundrum about whether the mind belongs to\nhumankind as a whole or it informs the life and knowledge of each\nindividual human being. Cardano seems to suggest that the mind\ntranscends individual human beings ([mens] superior est\nhomini), for happiness coincides with eternal life: “he who\ndoes not live long cannot be happy for long” (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 23ab; on Averroism in Cardano, see\nGarcía Valverde 2013). There cannot be happiness in human life\nif there is no afterlife for the soul. On this point, Cardano follows\nSt Paul’s argument in his Letter to the Romans (8: 20–22): \n\nCardano’s reflections on mental happiness, assimilation to\nGod, and universal intelligibility should be read against the\nbackground of contemporary discussions about the Averroist notion of\nintellectual beatitude. There is no doubt that, when Cardano\ncharacterizes the highest good as the union of the soul with God, his\ndefinition is full of Aristotelian and Averroistic resonances. The\nsummum bonum, he argues in De utilitate ex\nadversis capienda, is “to be assimilated to the highest\ngood,” i.e., God. Unlike other kinds of love, love of God is\n“honest” and “safe,” for its object never\ndeserts the seeking soul (De utilitate, OO, II, 6, 25a.\n500a; De sapientia, OO, I, 500–501; ed.  Bracali,\n30–36). Elsewhere, Cardano’s definition of\nsummum bonum is suppler and implies such components\nas wisdom (sapientia), virtue (especially fortitude and\nprudence), and progeny: wisdom is distinctively human; expressions of\nfortitude and prudence can also be seen in several animals; to have\nchildren, finally, is a prerogative that belongs to almost all living\nbeings. It is a sort of pyramidal model of virtue, with fertility at\nthe basis and wisdom at the top (only very few people can reach wisdom)\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 25b; Theonoston, OO, II, 302b;\non Cardano’s views on virtue, see Ingegno 1980, 318–76).\n \n\nThe characteristic oscillation between intellectual good and\nprosperous life is particularly evident in De utilitate ex adversis\ncapienda. This work is meant to provide directions on how to\novercome difficult situations and lead a reasonably serene life relying\nonly on the material conditions of one’s existence and on the\ninformation that one can get from sensible experience. Contrary to the\napproach followed in Theonoston, in De utilitate\nCardano focuses on the kind of happiness that one can reach in this\nlife, advancing the hypothesis – to be understood in an\nexperimental sense – that there is no survival of the soul\n(etiam sublata immortalitate) (De utilitate,\nII, 5). In this case, the moral actor is confronted not so much with\nthe goods attainable by the mind as with the ills that the mind needs\nto transform into opportunities for inner exercise or practical gain.\nCardano divides ills (mala) into external and internal. They\nboth can be measured according to the impact they have on our lives\n(magnitudo) and the level of constraint they impose on our\nactions (necessitas). External ills depend on the variable\narrangement of external events (fortunae arbitrium)\nand on the shifting states of the body. Although, properly speaking,\nthe body is “no part of ourselves,” nevertheless, it\ncommunicates with our mind. Internal ills are all those passions that\ncan be hardly eradicated from our soul, such as madness, anger, fear,\nand envy. Since they are located within the soul (animus), it\nis exceedingly difficult to turn them into something useful and\nproductive unless we undergo a radical transformation of our self\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 11b–12a, 13b). \n\nCardano claims that there can be five kinds of responses to\ncalamities in one’s life. The first two are\n“paradoxical” and have nothing relevant to say about\npossible applications to the practical aspects of one’s life.\nThese are the Christian and the Stoic responses: adversities are either\ngood in themselves, or they have absolutely no incidence in\nsomeone’s happiness. The remaining three kinds of response are of\na “pragmatic” nature, for they appeal to the human senses\nand have possible social outcomes. First, they teach us how to avoid\nmisfortunes or mitigate the impact they have on our life; second, in\ncase they happen, they direct our attention to ways of coping with\nmisfortunes or escape dangerous consequences; third, they tell us how\nto gain “some good” out of “any kind of ill”\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 10b, 27b, 39a). For Cardano, this\nethical program in three stages is an approach that suits people\ninvolved in the many activities of civic life and helps meet their\nsocial commitments. The distinctive trait of prudent people is their\nability to turn difficulties into opportunities of knowledge and moral\nbetterment (De utilitate, OO, II, 11a). Regarding the\n“paradoxical” attitudes to calamities displayed by Stoic\nand Christian sages, Cardano thinks that there is a great difference\nbetween the situation in which the wise man is deemed capable of\n“bearing calamities with fortitude” (the Stoic approach)\nand that in which he is supposed to look at them as part of\n“one’s goods” (the Christian attitude). Even more\ndifferent, however, is to interpret calamities as useful and productive\nmeans of experience, as suggested by Cardano. Otherwise, to praise the\nills of life remains a futile rhetorical exercise, and for this reason\nCardano does not hesitate to place Erasmus’ Laus\nstultitiae (“Praise of Folly”) in this category of\nedifying but useless rhetoric. With the exception of irreparable\nlosses, which can only be assuaged by resorting to a whole range of\nconsolatory techniques, Cardano maintains that any other ill can always\nbe turned into something useful and therefore no consolation is needed.\nTo sum up, he identifies different levels – rhetorical,\ncognitive, and pragmatic – within the domain of moral philosophy:\n“To praise adversities is the eloquent rhetorician’s task;\nto bear them with fortitude belongs to a generous soul or a person who\nknows divine truths; to draw useful instruction from them is the mark\nof a prudent man” (De utilitate, OO, II, 11a). \n\nAs in the case of intellectual happiness, relief from emergencies is\npredicated on knowledge. Cardano characterizes his method\n(ratio) for avoiding misfortunes and preparing against\ncalamities as based on a particular kind of knowledge\n(scientia) – both useful and necessary – which\n“teaches us to recognize and obtain known goods, and once they\nare obtained, it tells us how to use them and how to protect us with\nthem against ills” (De utilitate, OO, II, 17a). The\nambivalent role of animus in Cardano’s moral philosophy\nis particularly evident in his directions on how to draw profit from\nmisfortunes, for both misery and happiness depend on awareness\n(“the fact that we know our condition”) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 88b). Our thinking activity is a key element in\nturning adversities into opportunities of growth in self-awareness. Any\nphilosophical discussion of ethical matters presupposes that the\nethical subject is aware of his or her happiness or unhappiness:\n“the mind (animus) alone is the one who is happy or\nunhappy.” We have previously noted how closely Cardano’s\nnotion of the summum bonum is connected to the\nprinciple of soul’s awareness. In the same way, all forms of\nexternal goods (riches, physical beauty, health, friends, offspring,\ncountry, honors) are no part of happiness unless they are related to\nthe mind (quatenus ad animum referuntur). \n\nThe principal resources through which human beings may learn to draw\nadvantages from adversities are fortitude, prudence, worldly knowledge\n(rerum experientia), and all sorts of helps\n(auxilia), such as material means, friends, authority, bodily\nstrength and practical experience (exercitatio) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 12a). Among the resources provided by reason,\nCardano shares with Seneca the belief that meditating about one’s\ndeath (meditatio mortis) can trigger active and\npointed responses to everyday problems: “although death is a\nnecessary event, nevertheless, it contains in an eminent way, so to\nsay, all the reasons that sadden our life.” Thinking about death,\nregardless of whether people may be sure that they are going to survive\nafter death, “can dissolve almost any form of sorrow”\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 17b). When methodically structured, far\nfrom producing anxiety, the thought of death and of the transient\nnature of all human affairs injects a sense of purpose and order into\nour existence, making us gradually adjusted to a universe in a constant\nflux. Cardano’s method of drawing profit from adversities is\nbased on the general principle that everything in nature is subject to\nincessant change: “I usually compare human affairs, this whole\nsublunary frame (machina sublunaris) and all that\nhappens in it to a mass of wax in which, while it is compressed,\nprotrusions become cavities and cavities protrude, all forms change,\nand now they change into similar ones, now into dissimilar ones, into\ncharming or foul, horrible and pleasant ones.” The principle of\nthe unremitting transformation of reality (vicissitudo\nrerum) is therefore the ontological rationale behind our\nbelief that ills can be turned into goods (De utilitate, OO,\nII, 14b). Closely related to this principle is Cardano’s striking\nassumption that, when considered from the point of view of happiness,\nall things are on a par (omnia aequalia sunt):\n“God levelled the conditions not only for all human beings, but\nalso for all things which are under the sky” (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 18a, 24b). \n\nIt is while examining the essence of humane misfortune that Cardano\nreaches the important conclusion that loss and want are the ultimate\ncauses of one’s hardships. The ability to anticipate and feel in\nadvance the effect of losing something or someone (sensus\namissionis) can therefore prepare us to face calamities in our\nlife (De utilitate, OO, II, 7). While Cardano insists that\nexperience of adversities in life (sensus\ncalamitatum) provides people with a richer sense of their\nhappiness, however, he is also well aware that there are limits in the\nhuman ability to process misfortunes into material for inner\ntransformation (De utilitate, OO, II, 38b). Material\ndestitution is certainly one of these limits. Among the circumstances\nthat affect our perception of want, penury prevents us from focusing on\nthe improvement of our knowledge and level of awareness. When in his\ndivision of the goods (of the mind, of the body and of fortune) Cardano\ndescribes material means as a pre-condition for the exercise of virtue\nand happiness, he takes special care in specifying that the ethical\ninconvenience in being poor does not lie in not having access to the\nadvantages of material prosperity, but in the inability to work towards\none’s own happiness: “if someone does not have the means to\nraise his children, to look for wisdom or to practice justice, he will\ncertainly be unhappy, not because he is poor, but because he cannot\npractice the works of happiness” (De utilitate, OO, II,\n26a). Mental pain is another situation in which human ability to turn\nmisfortunes into positive experiences is tested to the limit. The way\nCardano insists on the severe reality of mental pain (molestia\nanimi, dolor animi) is one of the most\ncharacteristic aspects of his moral philosophy: “No disease, if\nthere is not fear of death, can equal mental pain (dolor\nanimi)” (De utilitate, OO, II, 18a). \n\nIn promoting (whenever possible) the value of happiness in all\ncircumstances of human life, Cardano does not intend to humour any\nhuman tendency to self-delusion. On the contrary, he sees his effort to\ndispel false beliefs and to curb proclivities to self-deception as his\nmain contribution to moral philosophy, for there is no greater merit\nthan “to free mankind from false opinions” (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 26a). Indeed, sometimes he goes so far as to\ncriticize Averroes’ notion of mental happiness as a form of\nentertaining false hopes (in this case, the hope to achieve\nintellectual bliss). Cardano thinks that the principal task of a moral\nphilosopher should be that of freeing the mind from misapprehensions\nand prejudices: “There are many people who prefer to be happy in\na mistaken way rather than acknowledge the reality of their affairs and\ntheir condition” (De utilitate, OO, II, 24b). As already\nsaid, mental securitas cannot be premised on forms of\nself-distraction and self-delusion, which turn our mind away from the\ncauses of our discontent. A good physician would never try to assuage\nthe pain of the patient by recommending him to buy “paintings and\nprecious stones” (Theonoston, OO, II, 307a).\nCardano’s method of drawing profit from adversities is therefore\nan attempt to promote endurance while insisting on a courageous\nacceptance of the human condition. \n\nThe clash between appearance and reality, which represents the\nhallmark of Cardano’s ontology and theory of knowledge, has\ntherefore its obvious counterpart in his moral philosophy, where he\noften associates human misery with unrealistic ambitions triggered by\nhuman desires: “Since human nature is driven to the infinite by\nappetites, it can never be satisfied, for it cannot contain the\ninfinite, indeed, not even a great part of what it desires.”\nTherefore, he who is not capable of restraining his own appetites, be\nhe the greatest of the kings, will certainly be the unhappiest person\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 5; De sapientia, OO, I, 532a,\n544b–545a; ed. Bracali, 135, 174–175). To fight our propensity to\ncherish illusory dreams of happiness (somnium umbrae\nand umbra somnii), Cardano recommends us to become more aware\nof the precarious nature of the human condition (humana\nfragilitas) and to increase our level of self-mastery. The\ncombined action of self-knowledge (nosce te ipsum)\nand self-control (impera te ipsum) contributes to\nnarrow the otherwise unmanageable scope of our desires\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 310b; De consolatione, OO, I,\n615a; De utilitate, OO, II, 89b-90a). Self-awareness and\nself-control contribute to create positive habits (mores) out\nof actions and passions. Unlike nonhuman animals (belluae),\nhuman beings are capable of disciplining themselves (imperare\nsibiipsis) and to shape their nature (et naturam et mores\nsibi formare) (Paralipomena, OO, X, 448a). They modify\ntheir behavior through thought (cogitatio), language\n(sermo), and action (actio). Actions are primarily\ndirected to what is useful for us and are ruled by the criterion of\ninterest (utile), by pleasure, nature, and habit. Thought\nconcentrates on what is either useful or harmful for us. Language\nadjusts our actions and thought to the variable circumstances that\npresent themselves from time to time (De utilitate, OO, II,\n19a, 20b; De minimis, I, 693a). Once we manage to strike a\nbalance between the scope of our desires and the reality in which we\nlive, two things become most necessary (maxime\nnecessaria): to obtain what we wish to have (habere\nquod velis) and to know how to use what we have (his quae\nhabes uti commode scire) (De utilitate, OO, II, 1). To\nfacilitate this task, Cardano distinguishes between disciplines in\nwhich the theoretical aspect is more prevalent (such as geometry and\ntheology), disciplines which are characterized by a balanced interplay\nof theory (scientia) and practice (usus), such as\nmedicine and law, and finally disciplines in which practice\n(exercitatio) is essential, like moral philosophy. Cardano\nenumerates five requisites that define the nature of an accomplished\naction (in terms of attaining the right means for the right end\n(adeptio), readiness of execution (promptitudo), and\ncompletion (perfectio)). These requisites are nature, art,\ndiligence, practice, and familiarity with the experts in the field\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 1–2; De\nsapientia, OO, I, 494b; ed.  Bracali, 15).","contact.mail":"guidomaria.giglioni@unimc.it","contact.domain":"unimc.it"}]
