Richard's identity is\nuncertain, but he is known to be the author of a collection of\nlogically puzzling sentences, sometimes called “sophisms”,\nentitled Abstractiones. The puzzling aspect of these sophisms\nis variously caused by semantic or syntactic ambiguities involved in\ncertain logical or “syncategorematic” words such as\n“all”, “every”, “or”,\n“if…then”, “and”, “not”,\n“begins”, “ceases”, “except”,\n“necessary”, “possible”, etc.\n\n\n\nThe title “Abstractiones” was apparently meant to\ncapture the “excerpted” nature of this collection of\nsophisms that are presented in a somewhat summary \n fashion.[1]\n This collection of sophisms became a kind of logical textbook used to\nteach students to identify sophistical fallacies. This book was\nprobably used in several medieval universities for several decades,\nfrom the late thirteenth well into the fourteenth centuries. Richard\nis often referred to as “Magister Abstractionum” or\n“Magister Richardus Sophista” to give emphasis to the\nmasterful, albeit summary, treatment of a very large collection of\nover three hundred such sophism\n sentences.[2]\n The title “sophista” simply meant\n“logician”. \n\nThe seven known manuscripts of the Abstractiones date from\nthe late thirteenth to the early fourteenth \n centuries:[3] \n\nOnly two of these manuscripts (B, D) are complete; the remaining five\nare in varying degrees of fragmentation. Two manuscripts (O, R) appear\nto be derivative texts, or redactions, of the Abstractiones.\n \n\nThe dating of the composition of the Abstractiones appears to\nhave been around the 1230's or 40's. Earliest references to the\nAbstractiones appear from the late thirteenth century in a\nmanuscript at Worcester Cathedral Library, Q. 13, which is confidently\ndated no later than 1295, and probably as early as \n 1270.[4] \n Worcester Q. 13 contains four references to the “Magister\nAbstractionum.” Another reference to the Abstractiones can be\nfound in a Quodlibetal Question of William of Alnwick, “Does God\nknow infinitely many things (Utrum Deus cognoscat\ninfinita)?”, q. 9 probably dating from around 1320. Walter\nBurley's tract, De Exceptivis, edited by L. M. de Rijk,\ncontains a reference to the Magister \n Abstractionum.[5]\n An interesting reference can also be found in William of Ockham's\nSumma Logicae and additional references can be found in\nPs. Richard of Campsall, John of Reading and Adam \n Wodeham.[6] \n\nThe fact of the existence of two derivative texts of the\nAbstractiones as well as the numerous known references by\naccomplished logicians some seventy years after its composition\nindicate that the Abstractiones was a quite popular book that\nsurvived the test of time. Although as compared to sophism literature\nof the fourteenth century Richard's analysis of sophisms appears\nsomewhat unsophisticated, as compared to treatments of sophisms of his\ncontemporaries Richard's analyses are qualitatively similar. Richard's\ngreatest accomplishment lay, perhaps, in his ability to encapsulate\nand summarize a huge number of such logical puzzles, presenting for\nthe student a handy reference book filled with examples of a host of\nlogical fallacies. \n\nAn edition of Richard's Abstractiones finally appeared in 2016,\nedited by Sten Ebbesen, Mary Sirridge, and E. Jennifer Ashworth,\npublished by Oxford University Press in the series Auctores\nBritannici Medii Aevi. \n\nIn order to give the reader a better understanding of the content of\nthis book of Abstractiones, it might be helpful to list a few\nexamples of the sophism sentences discussed in it and to illustrate\nRichard's treatment of just one of these. As noted above, our book\ncontains over three hundred sophism sentences. A random sampling\nincludes these examples: \n\n(1) Every man is every man (Omnis homo est omnis\nhomo)  \n\n(16) Whatever exists or does not exist exists (Quicquid est vel\nnon est est) \n\n(39) Everything other than an animal which plus Socrates are two\ndiffers from Socrates (Omne aliud quam animal quod et Sortes sunt\nduo differt a Sorte) \n\n(79) The whole Socrates is less than Socrates (Totus Sortes est\nminor Sorte) \n\n(96) If you know that you are a stone you do not know that you are a\nstone (Si tu scis te esse lapidem tu non scis te esse\nlapidem) \n\n(157) Nothing is true about nothing (De nihilo nihil est\nverum) \n\n(187) You have not ceased to eat iron (Tu non cessas comedere\nferrum) \n\n(215) All ten except one are nine (Omnia X praeter unum sunt\nIX) \n\n(278) It is impossible that you know more than you know\n(Impossibile est te scire plura quam scis) \n\nFrom the above rather small list of sophisms, it can already be\nnoticed that some sentences are more complex, and thus more logically\npuzzling, than others. Some sentences do not seem puzzling in\nthemselves at all, but become puzzling only within a certain\n“context” that is set up within which arguments proving\nand disproving the sophism must be developed. Such a context was\ncalled a \n “casus”.[7]\n It seems likely that the proving and disproving of the sophism\nsentence was done along the lines of a medieval oral\n“disputatio” within the classroom setting. This\nis the way Richard writes up his summaries: Proposal of the sophism,\nsometimes within a casus; arguments establishing the truth of\nthe sentence; arguments establishing the falsity of the sentence;\nresolution of the sophism along with identification of the sophistical\nfallacy involved. \n\nThe very first sophism sentence treated is one of the least\ncomplicated (this sophism involves no casus): \n\nEvery man is every man  \n\nProof: This man is this man, that man is that man and so forth for\neach individual man, therefore every man is every man. \n\nAnother proof: No proposition is more true than one in which the\nsame thing is predicated of the same thing…. \n\nDisproof: This proposition is true, “some man is not every\nman” and, similarly, “no man is every man”; therefore it\nis false that every man is every man. \n\nSolution: The solution to the sophism is to note that “every\nman” is equivocal as to reference to every man taken singularly\n(as in “any man”) and as to every man taken as a whole (as\nin “all men”). Mixing the two senses of\n“every” from subject to predicate causes the logical\npuzzle. \n\nAs noted, this sophism sentence is relatively uncomplicated and it is\neasy to spot the obvious fallacy involved, but Richard's text proceeds\nwith increasingly more difficult and intricate sophism sentences, many\nof which engage the mind in complex mental acrobatics. The fallacies\nnoted throughout are the standard ones discussed in Aristotle's De\nSophisticis Elenchis: the fallacy of equivocation; the fallacy of\naccident; the fallacy of the composite and divided senses; the fallacy\nof the consequent; the fallacy of absolute and qualified senses; the\nfallacy of many causes of truth; amphiboly; improper supposition. \nThere is still no certainty as to the identity of the Magister\nAbstractionum. Because of the colophon appended to the two complete\nmanuscripts of the Abstractiones, we know, of course, that\nhis name was “Richard”: \n\n(These [sophisms] are complete, which you, Richard the Sophister,\n\n Flower of virtue and teacher of logic, have produced.\n\n Turn the scribe's hand [from its task], nurturing Spirit.\n\n The Abstractiones are complete.) \n\nDe Rijk suggested the name Richard Fishacre, disagreeing with the\nsuggestion of Richard Fitz-Ralph offered by Macray on the basis that\nthe dating of the text within the second quarter of the thirteenth\ncentury is more consistent with Fishacre's \n chronology.[8]\n Jan Pinborg suggested the name Richard Rufus also on grounds that the\ndating of the Abstractiones is consistent with Rufus' being\nat \n Oxford.[9]\n It is generally assumed that the author is English. Pinborg offered\none further bit of evidence for the name Richard Rufus in that there\nis some reason to think that certain doctrines of Richard Rufus, as\ncriticised by Roger Bacon, are in the Abstractiones. The\nprimary doctrine in question attributed to Richard Rufus and\ncriticised by Roger Bacon is, in general terms, that the signification\nof a name can remain in the absence of any actual thing signified by\nthat name, although, as Bacon suggests, the proponents of this view\nmust supply some kind of “habitual being” for the lost\nactual significate of such names. It is this doctrine of the\n“esse habituale” that Bacon finds\nobjectionable. That Richard Rufus does seem to have such a doctrine\nappears clear in his discussion of the question “Whether Christ\nwhile three days in the tomb was a man” (“Utrum\nChristus in triduo mortis fuerit homo”) in distinction 22,\nbook III of his Sentences\n Commentary.[10] \n\nIt would be beyond the scope of this essay to deal with the\ncomplexities of both Richard Rufus' treatment of this question as well\nas Roger Bacon's voiceful criticisms of the notion of the\n“esse habituale.” The important question here is\nwhether the doctrine espoused by Richard Rufus exactly parallels\nanything that can be found in the Abstractiones of Richard\nthe Sophister. It is important to find not only terminological\nsimilarities but also doctrinal similarities. The terminology within\nwhich Richard Rufus makes the above noted distinction is\n“esse in habitu” versus “esse in\nactu”, the former he also labels “esse\nsimpliciter”, the latter “esse ut\n nunc.”[11]\n Bacon seems to substitute the expression “esse\nhabituale” for the expression “esse in\nhabitu.” Rufus does not use the expression “esse\nhabituale.” As referenced above, Pinborg noticed the\nexpressions “esse consequentiae sive habitudinis”\nand “esse quod est operatio entis” in the\nAbstractiones. Bacon also uses the expression “esse\nhabitudinis”, but he seems to recognize a distinction\nbetween “esse habituale” and “esse\nhabitudinis”; the latter, he says, “is used about\npropositions and will be destroyed later when there is talk about\n propositions.”[12]\n This remark might indicate that Bacon finds the same doctrinal\nproblem with the “esse habitudinis” that he finds\nwith the “esse habituale” (i.e., it introduces a\nfoil for some kind of fictive being), but we cannot be certain of\nthis, since he never returned to this topic in the\nCompendium. Richardus Sophista does not use the terminology of\n“esse habituale/esse actuale”,\n“esse in habitu/esse in actu” that we find in\nBacon and Rufus \n respectively.[13]\n Pinborg also noted that William of Ockham criticizes those who make\nthe distinction between “esse consequentiae sive\nhabitudinis” and “esse quod est operatio\nentis” as ignorant of the simple distinction between\nhypothetical and categorical propositions, which according to Ockham\nis all that the distincition amounts \n to.[14]\n Pinborg sees Ockham's criticism as possibly making the same point as\nBacon, i.e., the terminology invites some kind of talk of fictive\nbeing. Although Ockham is probably right to want to eliminate the old\nterminology in favor of less problematic language, the important\nquestions are whether Richard the Sophister's use of the distinction\n“esse habitudinis/esse quod est operatio\nentis” entails anything other than a distinction between\ntypes of propositions and whether his use of the distinction comes\nunder the attacks of Roger Bacon on the same way in which these\nattacks seem relevant to a terminologically similar distinction in\nRichard Rufus. \n\nA complete answer to these questions would require not only a\ndetailed examination of the use of this distinction in the resolution\nof sophisms in the Abstractiones, but also an examination of\nRichard's position regarding terms that “assert non-being” and his\naccount of negation and negatives \n generally.[15]\n These tasks are clearly beyond the scope of this essay. With respect\nto the first question, it will have to suffice to record here that\nthere are only three places in the Abstractiones where\nRichard employs the distinction in the resolution of sophisms and in\nnone of these is it clear that this is his favored \n solution.[16]\n More importantly, Richard's use of the distinction in the resolution\nof sophisms seems to match the use made of the same distinction (under\nthe terminology “esse habituale/esse\nactuale”) by William of Sherwood, that is, as essentially a\nway of marking a distinction between hypothetical and categorical\n propositions.[17]\n It has been successfully argued by Braakhuis that the attacks of\nRoger Bacon do not apply to William's use of the distinction, even\nthough, of all the authors noted so far, only William's terminology is\nexactly the same terminology used by \n Bacon.[18]\n Thus, if the doctrine under attack by Bacon cannot be attributed to\nWilliam, neither can it be attributed to Richard the Sophister. It\nappears, then, that Richard Rufus and Richard the Sophister cannot be\nidentified, at least on the basis of these alleged doctrinal and\nterminological similarities.","contact.mail":"pas-43@msn.com","contact.domain":"msn.com"}]
