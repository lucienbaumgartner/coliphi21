(FA theories come in both\ncognitivist and noncognitivist versions, and can be given either a\nrealist or a quasi-realist gloss. For discussion of this point, see\n(D'Arms and Jacobson 2006a)). Contrast this view with its two\nmain realist alternatives, robust realism and dispositionalism.\nAccording to robust realism, values exist independently of human\nresponses to them, like such primary qualities as shape and size. A\nyellow tennis ball looks spherical because it is (roughly) a sphere;\nand shapes can be defined without recourse to anything about our\nresponses to them. By contrast, colors depend, in some way, both on the\nqualities of things and on our perceptual capacities. Even if yellow is\ndefined in terms of certain physical properties of yellow objects, the\nreason we conceive of colors as we do—which makes yellow a useful\nconcept to us—is because of the way our color vision happens to\nwork. According to a simple dispositionalist view of color, yellowness\njust is whatever has the power to arouse yellow appearances to normal\nhuman observers in standard conditions. Similarly, a dispositionalist\nview of value understands funniness, for instance, in terms of whatever\namuses normal humans in standard conditions; whereas robust realism\nabout the comic holds that amusement, when correct, is a perception of\nsome mind-independent quality of funniness.\n\n\n\nAn FA theory of humor agrees with dispositionalism that the funny\ncan only be characterized in terms of a human response (amusement); but\nit also holds, with robust realism, that the amusement of even normal\nhumans in standard conditions can be mistaken: it can be unfitting. To\ncall something funny is in some way to endorse amusement at\nit, not to report or predict it. The attraction of FA theory is that it\npurports to capture the sense that we ought to be amused at certain\nthings because they are funny, as robust realism has it, while agreeing\nwith dispositionalism that funny cannot be understood except by way of\nhuman response and sensibility: our sense of humor.\n\n\n\nAlthough terms such as ‘fitting’,\n‘appropriate’, and the like are often used interchangeably,\nthere are several distinct forms of endorsement one can give to\nevaluative attitudes (such as emotions and desires), and the failure to\ndifferentiate adequately between them gives rise to the central\noutstanding problem facing FA theory: the wrong kind of reason\nproblem. Consider the simplest form of FA theory, which analyzes\ngoodness in terms of what it is fitting to desire: the desirable. Not\nall considerations in favor of desiring something manifest its\ndesirability; for instance, incentives and sanctions attached to desire\ndo not. Perhaps desiring certain good things (such as happiness) makes\none less likely to succeed in getting them. If so, then that seems a\ngood reason not to desire happiness, but it clearly does not show that\nhappiness isn't desirable. Thus FA theories must explicate a\nnotion of fittingness that can distinguish reasons of the right kind:\nthose relevant to evaluative judgment of the object. Moreover, the\nevaluative attitudes used by the theory must not already involve the\nvalue concept it attempts to explicate, on pain of circularity. If to\ndesire something involves thinking it good, for example, then an FA\ntheory of goodness in terms of fitting desire seems circular. However,\ncertain FA accounts claim, at least with respect to more fine-grained\nattitudes and specific values, that such circularity is not vicious\nbecause it does real explanatory work.\n\n\n\nThe class of FA theories includes some quite disparate views, which\ndiffer importantly in their fundamental motivation as well as in their\nscope and ambition. Although the renewed interest in FA theories arose\nfrom a dispute between quasi-realist expressivism (Blackburn 1993,\nGibbard 1990) and anthropocentric, less-than-robust realism (McDowell\n1998, Wiggins 1987), the metaethical differences between these two\napproaches seem less significant than their similarities (D'Arms\nand Jacobson 2006a). Rather, the most significant differences among FA\ntheories concern the range of values they seek to analyze, the specific\nevaluative attitudes they adduce to do so, and whether or not they give\nexplanatory priority to those evaluative attitudes. Three distinct\nvarieties of FA theory are generic attitude theories,\nwhich aspire to give a general and non-circular theory of value in\nterms of some capacious notion such as desire or approval;\nsentimentalist theories that focus specifically on the\nsentiments and those values most intimately related to them, such as\nshame and the shameful; and sensibility theories, which deny\nthe priority of evaluative attitudes in favor of an overtly circular\naccount of value properties and evaluative responses.\n\n\n\nAccording to the most straightforward and ambitious form of the\nfitting attitude theory of value, to be valuable is to be the\nfitting object of some evaluative attitude. Since FA theories seek\nto analyze both value and disvalue, they must include both forms of\napproval and disapproval. Thus A. C. Ewing (1948: 168) writes:\n“if we analyse good as ‘fitting object of a pro\nattitude’, it will be easy enough to analyse bad as\n‘fitting object of an anti attitude’, this term covering\ndislike, disapproval, avoidance, etc.” For the sake of\nsimplicity, I will use ‘value’ here to refer both to\npositive and negative features, except when it is important to\ndifferentiate between them. Along with Ewing, Franz Brentano is usually\ncited as among the first proponents of an FA theory of value. Brentano\n(1969: 18) states his view this way: “In the broadest sense of\nthe term, the good is that which is worthy of love, that which can be\nloved with a love that is correct.” Despite his use of the\nemotion terms ‘love’ and ‘hate’, Brentano does\nnot have specific emotions in mind; rather, he includes as forms of\nlove all desiderative attitudes, and as forms of hate all aversive\nones. \n\nBrentano is typically credited with holding an FA theory of value.\nThis interpretation requires him to be read as understanding the\ncorrectness of love and other evaluative attitudes as something other\nthan the truth of some proposition on which they are founded. Fear, for\nexample, cannot be even partly constituted by the belief that the\nfeared object is dangerous, such that fear is correct whenever that\nproposition is true. Otherwise the value of an object—its\ngoodness or badness—would make it worthy of love or hate,\nrespectively, thus reversing the order of explanation definitive of FA\naccounts, as opposed to robust realism. All sides grant that it is\nfitting to approve of the good and disapprove of the bad; what\ndifferentiates FA theory is its ambition to explicate value by way of\n(fitting) evaluative attitudes. Thus when Brentano (1969: 75) writes,\n“One loves or hates correctly provided that one's feelings\nare adequate to their object—adequate in the sense of being\nappropriate, suitable, or fitting”—this is commonly taken\nas an injunction so to direct one's love and hate\n(Chisholm 1986). If so then both Brentano and Ewing seek to analyze all\nvalue in terms of the whole array of positive and negative evaluative\nattitudes. I will term these broadest and most ambitious forms of the\nview generic fitting attitude theories of value. \n\nIt will prove most perspicuous to hold two related but distinct\nclaims as constitutive of fitting attitude accounts. First, FA theories\nreduce values to a fundamentally different sort of normative notion,\ninvolving what one ought, or has reason, to feel. The first tenet of\nthe view, then, is the reduction of the evaluative to the\ndeontic, or normative reduction for short. This is to say that\nvalues such as the good and the funny are to be understood in terms of\nwhat one ought, or has most reason, to feel. This point is explicitly\nnoted by Chisholm (1986: 53): “This way of defining intrinsic\nvalue, then, makes use of the concept of requirement,”\nin order to provide “a way of reducing the concepts of the theory\nof value (‘axiology’) to those of ethics\n(‘deontology’).” It is important not to understand\n‘deontic’ to refer specifically to moral obligation. As\nEwing (1948: 132) observes, when we speak loosely of what we ought to\nfeel, this “‘ought’ really covers two different\nconcepts, the concept of fittingness and the concept of moral\nobligation.” It is the former notion with which FA analysis is\nprimarily concerned. I will follow the recent trend of explicating\nfittingness in terms of what we have reason to feel rather than what we\nought to feel. But the crucial point is that fittingness, the\nfundamental normative notion of FA theory, is distinct from other forms\nof endorsement of an attitude, for instance as prudent or morally\nobligatory. This is no minor point since—as we shall see in\ndiscussing the wrong kind of reason problem—the theory is doomed\nto failure unless it can draw this distinction (D'Arms and\nJacobson 2000b). \n\nThe second tenet of FA theory is its response-dependent account\nof value, on which values are partly determined by human responses\nand attitudes. As David Wiggins (1987: 206) describes the view,\nconsidered as a general theory of value, it holds: “x is\ngood if and only if x is the sort of thing that calls forth or\nmakes appropriate a certain sentiment of approbation given the\nrange of propensities we have to respond in this or that\nway.” Notice that Wiggins's formulation is\ndeliberately equivocal on the crucial point of whether the sentiment\nmust be merited or merely caused. It allows for both response-dependent\nviews that embrace normative reduction (by using a notion of\n“appropriate” sentiments) and views that instead reduce\nvalue to natural facts (about what sentiments are “called\nforth”). This illustrates why it is not trivial to characterize\nfitting attitude theories of value in terms of attitudes deemed to be\nfitting—that is, via response-dependency and normative reduction.\nThis way of articulating the two tenets of FA theory has the\nsignificant implication of ruling out those theories of value that hold\none tenet but not the other, which helps settle some outstanding\ntaxonomic issues. Certain “buck-passing” accounts hold the\nnormative reduction claim without response-dependency, whereas\ndispositional theories, including certain forms of sentimentalism, hold\nresponse-dependency without reducing value to another normative notion.\nThis will be discussed further in the sections on buck-passing and\nsentimentalism. \n\nConsider first the normative reduction claim. Here FA theories\nconflict with the commonsense view of value, which derives reasons from\nvalues (cf. Stratton-Lake and Hooker 2006). Take the simplest case: an\ninnocent pleasure granted to be intrinsically good. Many philosophers\nhold such pleasure to be good independently of anything about human\ndesire or approval. Of course people typically do want pleasure, and\nshould want it; but such desire is fitting because pleasure is\ngood. Similarly, we typically approve of people getting pleasure, and\nshould do so; but approval is fitting because this is a good state of\naffairs. According to generic FA theory, by contrast, what it is for\nsomething to be good is for it to be a fitting object of some\npro-attitude such as desire or approval. In this view, what makes\npleasure good is something about our attitudes—albeit not about\nour actual attitudes (which may be unfitting). But the central question\nremains. Why derive value from the fittingness of attitudes, rather\nthan understanding evaluative attitudes as being sensitive to values\nthat exist independently of them, which are fitting whenever this\napprehension is veridical? \n\nThe motivation for adopting an FA theory becomes clearer when one\nmoves from a single case, especially the paradigmatic good of pleasure,\nto other good things. Consider a plausible list of intrinsic values:\npleasure, beauty, friendship, and knowledge. Though this isn't\nmonistic hedonism, it's a very modest pluralism on which there\nare four distinct goods instead of one. Someone might wonder what these\nthings have in common, in virtue of which they are good. Of course\nthere may be no answer, if it is just a brute fact that there are four\nintrinsic goods, which resemble each other simply in having the\nproperty of goodness. But another sort of response suggests itself.\nPerhaps what unifies these goods is something about human attitudes.\nMaybe pleasure, knowledge, beauty, and friendship are all\ndesirable or admirable things, where this means not\nthat we can desire or admire them but that we should (ought, have\nreason to) do so, in virtue of facts about human nature, the inherent\nqualities of those attitudes, and natural facts about the objects. Were\nwe lone but rational wolves, we would have no use—and hence no\nfitting desire—for the friendship of other wolves, and no reason\nto admire lupine loyalty or the other traits requisite for friendship.\nHence the response-dependency thesis makes values\nanthropocentric, in that they depend on human capacities and\ndispositions, and would be of no inherent interest to rational beings\nwho lacked those propensities. If this seems problematic with respect\nto good and bad, it may seem much more plausible when it comes to the\nfunny and the shameful. \n\nThe notion that value, or at least some range of values, depends\nessentially on human responses has been championed by philosophers who\ndraw an analogy between values and secondary qualities. McDowell (1985:\n143) puts the point this way: \n\nNotwithstanding the anthropocentric nature of colors, some things\nreally are red and others not, and propositions about colors are\nknowable. Response-dependency is thus compatible with evaluative truth\nand knowledge, although these are not basic facts about the universe.\nBoth anthropocentrism and the rejection of skepticism are held in\ncommon between sensibility theory, which holds the normative reduction\nthesis and thus counts as an FA account, and dispositional theories of\nvalue which do not. \n\nAlthough the response-dependency thesis provides grounds for giving\npriority to the deontic notions, it also presents a challenge to FA\ntheory. Advocates of the commonsense view object that the relevant\nevaluative responses already invoke the value concepts they are\nsupposed to explicate. W. D. Ross (1939: 278–9) formulates this\nchallenge with respect to admiration, but it can be posed for any\npro-attitude: \n\nFA theory must hold that attitudes such as admiration and approval\nhave standards of fittingness that serve to make certain things, and\nnot others, valuable. Furthermore, these evaluative attitudes must not\nalready contain the thought that their object is good, on pain of\ncircularity. This challenge forces FA theory to engage with the\nphilosophy of emotion. Both Ross and Ewing seem implicitly to accept\nsome version of the feeling theory of emotion, on which\nemotions—or at any rate “mere emotions”—are\nsimply feelings with no essential cognitive component. \n\nEwing (1948: 154) responds to the circularity challenge by\nsuggesting that admiration can be understood as an emotion\nwithout invoking the concept of good, which FA theory is\nattempting to analyze:  \n\nBut Ewing's response does not seem adequate to meet the\ncircularity objection. Ross grants that admiration is, in part, an\nemotion. His objection is that it also involves thought about the\ngoodness of the object, as would Ewing's “state of mind\ntinged with emotional qualities.” In order to avoid circularity,\nit seems that FA theory has to make two claims. First, that such\nattitudes as admiration are not merely affectively tinged but simply\nemotions. Second, it must offer an account of the emotions on which\nthey do not include thoughts about their object's value. In the\nsection on sentimentalism, I will suggest that such a non-cognitive\naccount of certain basic emotions might prove tenable. But if thoughts\nof the object's value are even partly constitutive of the\nattitudes FA theory uses to analyze value, then the theory is\ncircular—whether viciously or not.  \n\nThree possibilities remain for the development of FA theory, which\ncorrespond to its main versions. First, generic FA theories aspire to\ngive a non-circular account of value generally. They therefore need to\nclaim that the broad pro and con attitudes utilized by the theory to\nexplicate good and bad do not already involve those very concepts.\nSecond, although sensibility theory too aspires to elucidate all value,\nit eschews the ambition to give a non-circular account. The question\nthen becomes whether a circular account really can be informative and,\nhence, not vicious. Third, a sentimentalist theory can be more modest\nabout how broadly the account applies, but it needs to give an account\nof the sentiments on which they do not contain those evaluative\nconcepts analyzed—for instance, an account of amusement that can\nbe characterized independently of thinking something funny. Finally,\nall FA theories have to solve the wrong kind of reason problem, in\norder to fix on those considerations for or against evaluative\nattitudes that are relevant to the value of their objects.  \n\nThe revival of interest in fitting attitude theory is largely due to\nseveral influential defenses of each of its constituent claims. In the\nfirst place, sensibility theories and neo-sentimentalist theories have\nrecently received both favorable and critical attention. Despite their\ndifferences, both sensibility theory and these recent forms of\nsentimentalism are full-fledged versions of FA theory, which subscribe\nto both its central tenets. Secondly, though, each of these tenets has\nalso been endorsed by philosophers who reject the other claim and\ntherefore do not hold FA accounts. Since these two constitutive claims\nhave not always been sharply differentiated, both these developments\nhave increased the interest in FA theory. Several response-dependent\ntheories of value have been developed, which make values prior to\nreasons and thus reject normative reduction (Lewis 1989). From the\nother direction, T. M. Scanlon (1998) has advanced what he calls the\nbuck-passing account of value. Although I will contend that\nScanlon's view is committed only to normative reduction, and\nhence is not an FA theory, the literature has tended to assimilate buck\npassing accounts with fitting attitude theories. This too has increased\nthe visibility of the FA theory of value, however illicitly.  \n\nFitting attitude theories of value are sometimes referred to as\nbuck-passing accounts, and a burgeoning secondary literature concerns\nthe viability of “passing the buck,” especially about the\ngood. This identification of FA theories with buck passing is somewhat\nmisleading, as they are distinct claims, but those interested in FA\ntheories of value cannot overlook the literature on buck passing (see\nbibliography). Issues of semantics aside, it will be helpful to\ndifferentiate the buck-passing account from the fitting attitude theory\nof value.  \n\nIn coining the buck-passing trope, Scanlon seems to combine two or\nthree distinct ideas. First, the leading thought of buck passing, which\ninspires its name, is that goodness provides no reasons of its\nown, but serves merely to collect things that are valuable on\nother grounds. As Scanlon (1998: 97) writes: \n\nIn this famous passage, however, Scanlon adds two other thoughts to\nthe core idea. He claims that “lower-order” properties of\ngood things provide reasons to respond “in certain ways” to\nthem. This resembles the normative reduction claim of FA theory;\nindeed, Scanlon endorses the strategy of explaining values in terms of\nreasons. Finally, although this is less clear, Scanlon seems to suggest\nthat these lower-order, good-making features must be natural\nproperties of objects. These three claims are compatible but distinct.\nOne can pass the buck about goodness—that is, deny that the\ngoodness of something adds any additional reason to want or get\nit—without holding normative reduction. Perhaps good things are\nalways good in virtue of more specific good-makers, but these\nlower-order values determine our reasons. Moreover, even if goodness\nprovides no reasons of its own, the properties that do provide reasons\nmight be lower-order but still essentially evaluative properties of\nobjects, not natural properties. Thus the question is not just whether\nto pass the buck, for instance from goodness to more specific\nproperties, but where does the buck stop? \n\nLet us consider the respects in which the details of Scanlon's\naccount do and do not resemble FA theory, and then turn to what I take\nas the leading thought of the buck-passing metaphor. Because Scanlon\nrefers to reasons to respond, and elsewhere to various\nattitudes one can take toward value, he can seem to be\nfocusing on the evaluative attitudes at the heart of FA theories. But\nScanlon's notion of response focuses primarily on action, and\nsecondarily on such practical attitudes as respect, contemplation, and\nenjoyment, as opposed to emotions. While his discussion raises\nquestions about evaluative attitudes that are left unanswered, two\npoints are clear. First, Scanlon rejects what he calls the teleological\nconception of value, according to which value only provides reasons to\npromote the valuable (and minimize the disvaluable). Second, Scanlon\n(1998: 99) rejects any account of value as systematic as generic FA\ntheory: \n\nAlthough it remains open to him to adopt a more limited FA theory of\ncertain values, Scanlon seems committed to rejecting any generic FA\ntheory, despite holding the buck-passing account of value quite\ngenerally.  \n\nIn order to differentiate buck passing from fitting attitude theory,\nwe need to discriminate between the aspect of Scanlon's view that\nis part of an FA theory, the aspect amenable but not essential to FA\ntheory, and the aspect that seems orthogonal to it. The analysis of\nvalue in terms of reasons, which we've called normative\nreduction, is one of the two constitutive claims of FA theory. (Even\nhere a caveat is needed, however, since those FA theories that aspire\nmerely to capture some values may not accept normative reduction as a\ngeneral thesis.) One might hold an FA theory specifically for those\nvalues that seem response-dependent, while thinking that certain other\nvalues—including perhaps the good or moral worth—are\nautonomous from human response and attitudes. (I take this complex view\nto have considerable plausibility.) Since Scanlon does not adopt the\nresponse-dependency thesis, he rejects generic FA analysis on its own\nterms, not merely because of his skepticism toward all systematic\ntheories of value.  \n\nMoreover, various theories that reject normative reduction, such as\nsimple hedonism, pass the buck with respect to goodness. (I will here\nignore tangential issues about the metaethical grounding of hedonism.)\nAccording to the hedonist, good things all have some natural property,\nnamely pleasure, which grounds all practical reasons. No additional\nreasons are provided by the fact that some state is good, beyond those\ngiven by its pleasure. It would be a mistake of double-counting to\nclaim that I have two reasons to take a warm bath: that it is\npleasurable, and that it is good. The goodness of pleasurable things\ndoes not add another reason to that given by its pleasantness. Hence\nthe claims of FA theory and buck-passing are distinct. One can pass the\nbuck about goodness without holding an FA theory. \n\nCan one hold an FA theory of some value without passing the buck\nwith respect to it? This is less clear, but it seems so. Consider the\ndelicious, for example. Does the fact that something is delicious\nprovide any reason to desire or consume it, or does the delicious pass\nthe buck to still lower-order natural properties that are the real\nreason givers? Surely what makes things delicious are various natural\nproperties, specifically those to which our taste is sensitive such as\nsaltiness. Yet saltiness isn't intrinsically reason-giving;\nsomething can be too salty or not salty enough, nor is there a perfect\namount of saltiness. Rather, it seems that the deliciousness of any\nparticular flavor depends on the other tastes accompanying it. Hence\ndeliciousness is a holistic property of how something tastes, dependent\non human sensibilities. I cannot see why one should be tempted to pass\nthe buck from the delicious to those complex natural properties that,\nalong with features of human taste, make certain things delicious. On\nthe contrary, it seems better to hold that the fact that something is\ndelicious gives one reasons: reasons to praise the dish, to admire the\nchef, and of course to eat it.  \n\nSuppose that values such as the delicious are most readily\nidentified by way of human tendencies to respond. This seems a\nsignificant difference between pleasure and deliciousness, which might\nmake buck passing about the good—at least on certain conceptions\nof goodness—more promising than it is for the delicious. For the\nhedonist, there is a reasonably satisfying explanation of the goodness\nof things that simply adverts to a (putatively) natural property:\npleasure. No such explanation is likely to be available about the\ndelicious, because it's so implausible to think we can always\npick out the natural properties in virtue of which something is\ndelicious. (The same point holds of the beautiful and other aesthetic\nproperties.) Talk about deliciousness usefully groups things\ntogether—usefully for us humans, that is—by explaining what\nthey have in common, at a level that can be widely understood despite\nour ignorance of the ultimate delicious-making properties. This\nmotivates the claim of FA theory that for something to be delicious is\nfor it to merit gustatory pleasure. Despite the fact that the\ndeliciousness of food is in some way a matter of its (and our) natural\nproperties, this does not imply that deliciousness fails to be\nreason-giving or that we must take lower-order properties to provide\nour reasons to enjoy some taste. In other words, the buck stops here:\nat what merits gustatory pleasure.  \n\nHence the issue at the core of buck-passing, about whether the\nhighest-order evaluative concepts provide reasons, seems orthogonal to\nFA theory except in one respect. Like FA theory, Scanlon's\naccount reduces values to reasons and thereby adopts the normative\nreduction thesis. While there may be something about FA theories that\nmake them especially amenable to passing the buck with respect to\ngoodness, this point has not yet been adequately established. And if we\ndo not pass the buck all the way down to natural properties, then such\nevaluative concepts as the funny and the beautiful might provide\nreasons of their own. Thus some of the values for which FA theory seems\nmost plausible are also those least amenable to a buck-passing account.\nOnce we move from generic FA theories to analogous accounts of more\nspecific values, the motivation for further buck-passing becomes more\nelusive.  \n\nThe term sensibility theory was coined to refer to a collection of\nsimilar views put forward most notably by John McDowell (1985, 1987,\n1996) and David Wiggins (1976, 1987), which claim values to be\nanthropocentric and use perceptual metaphors to describe evaluative\nthought and experience (Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton 1992). According\nto this view, value properties cannot be reduced to natural properties\nin a way that supports useful generalizations or explanations. Rather,\nas Wiggins (1987: 193) puts it: “Our subjective reactions to\nobjects or events will often impose groupings upon them that have no\npurely naturalistic rationale.” Sensibility theory therefore\nadopts the response dependency thesis quite broadly, holding it of all\nvalues. \n\nThis is one of two respects in which values resemble secondary\nqualities. Although redness might be identified with a messy\ndisjunction of physical properties, there would be no point in grouping\nthat disjunction together were it not for human color vision. The other\nanalogy is that this anthropocentrism does not lead (most) philosophers\nto deny that there are facts about what is and isn't red, or to\nbe generally skeptical of claims about knowledge of color facts.\nSensibility theory insists that the same is true of values. Yet there\nare also two crucial disanalogies between values and color acknowledged\nby these theories. The first is that sensibility theory explicates\nvalue in terms of the responses it merits, not just those it\nnormally causes (McDowell 1985: 143). (To say that an object\nmerits some response is equivalent to saying that the response is\nfittingly directed at the object.) And an evaluative response to an\nobject is fitting—pending a caveat to be discussed in the final\nsection on right and wrong kinds of reason—when there is\nsufficient reason to feel it toward that object. Thus sensibility\ntheory explicates values in terms of reasons: it adopts normative\nreduction. Since it holds both response dependency and normative\nreduction, sensibility theory is a version of the FA theory of value.\n \n\nThe other disanalogy concerns the disparity between color vision,\nwhich is very similar among humans, and our senses of humor, shame, and\nthe like, where people have quite different sensibilities. The merit\nschema makes it essentially contestable what counts as funny, good, or\nhonorable, whereas what counts as red is not essentially contestable or\noften contested. “There is, of course, a striking disanalogy in\nthe contentiousness that is typical of values;” McDowell (1985:\n144) grants, “but I think it would be a mistake to suppose this\nspoils the point.” Instead, he concludes that this\ncontentiousness allows for further criticism of actual responses, and\nprecludes their simply bootstrapping themselves into correctness.\n“The aspiration to understand oneself is an aspiration to change\none's responses, if that is necessary for them to become\nintelligible otherwise than as defective,” he writes (1985: 145).\nBy contrast, there can be no sensible aspiration to change one's\ncolor vision through criticism and regulation, though one can conclude\nthat it is defective and, hence, reserve judgment about certain colors\nbased on one's experience.  \n\nWhile the advocates of sensibility theory can be elusive about crucial\ndetails of their program, they seem to hold that their view can\ncapture all value. Wiggins (1976: 95) adopts a generic FA theory that\naims to include all evaluations—as good or bad, beautiful or\nugly, ignoble, brave, just, disgusting, amusing, etc. (He excludes\nwhat he calls directive judgments, such as “this is to be\ndone.”) But he also conceives each of these value properties as\nbeing associated with a specific response or reaction, as the funny is\nassociated with amusement. Through a process of refinement, some value\nproperties eventually become detached from independently identifiable\nresponses, but they will still be paired with something worth calling\na reaction. Although these “further properties that lie at a\nprogressively greater distance from specific kinds of affect”\n(Wiggins 1987: 196–7) cannot be paired with distinct sentiments, they\nwill still be constrained by human emotional capacities. It seems\nstrange that the sensibility theorists say so little about the\ndisparity between these various evaluative properties—between,\nsay, the funny and the just. All such values are claimed to be coeval\nwith responses, in that the response is not logically or\npsychologically prior to the property. But the plausibility of this\nclaim varies depending on the “distance” of the value from\nthe sentiment, and the differences among sentiments. \n\nSensibility theory embraces circularity because it holds a view\nabout the emotions on which they cannot be identified without invoking\nthe very concepts FA analysis attempts to analyze. As McDowell (1987:\n160) writes: “If there is no comprehending the right sentiments\nindependently of the concepts of the relevant [evaluative] features, a\nno-priority view is surely indicated.” Wiggins (1987: 195) holds\nsuch a no-priority view even of the relation between amusement and the\nfunny, but his argument on this point is less than compelling (cf.\nD'Arms and Jacobson 2006a). However, a more compelling case for a\nno-priority view might be found for resentment. Perhaps resentment is\nbest understood as a specific form of anger, restricted conceptually to\ncases founded on moral reasons. Then wrongness might be explicated in\nterms of fitting resentment, while resentment is understood partly in\nterms of wrongness. \n\nThe circularity implied by such a no-priority view is claimed not be\nvicious because it helps elucidate values. Thus Wiggins (1987: 189)\nwrites that sensibility theory “hopes to elucidate the concept of\nvalue by displaying it in its actual involvement with the sentiments.\nOne would not, according to [this view], have sufficiently elucidated\nwhat value is without that detour.” But this claim can be\nattacked from both sides. According to forms of sentimentalism that\nlimit their FA theory to a core class of emotions, sensibility theory\nexaggerates the interdependence of these responses (such as fear,\namusement, disgust, shame, and the like) with their associated value\nproperties (the fearsome, funny, disgusting, shameful, etc.). Here the\nsentiments are plausibly prior to the values, and circularity can be\navoided by giving an account of these emotions that does not advert to\nthe evaluative concepts at issue. Yet with respect to good and bad, it\nis hard to see how much is elucidated by the detour through the\nsentiments. Sensibility theory does not seem to improve upon generic FA\ntheories, with their vague references to pro-attitudes, in this\nrespect. What is it to approve of something other than to think it\ngood—perhaps with a charge of positive affect? Here the\ncircularity seems vicious precisely because the detour is so brief and\nuninformative. \n\nSentimentalism can be understood broadly, so as to include\nsensibility theory despite its no-priority claim, or more narrowly as\nthe thesis that a given value “depends on some internal sense or\nfeeling which nature has made universal in the species” (Hume\n1740/1975: 172). Note that sentimentalism must claim, in either case, that\nthose emotions on which it focuses are not merely epistemic routes to\nindependently existing values. For instance, amusement cannot merely be\na sensitivity to the funny, in order to be amenable to a sentimentalist\ntheory of humor in terms of (fitting) amusement. I will here adopt the\nnarrow usage, which makes sensibility theory not a form of\nsentimentalism but a close relation to it. The crucial difference is\nthat a Humean sentimentalist view gives priority to those universal\nhuman feelings: certain basic or pan-cultural emotions I'm\nreferring to as sentiments. These will not include all the\nvarious states commonly called emotions, and a sentimentalist might\nwell accept a no-priority account of the relation between certain\nvalues and “cognitively sharpened” emotions such as\nresentment, as opposed to simple anger (D'Arms and Jacobson\n2003).  \n\nAlthough response-dependency is an essential aspect of\nsentimentalism, not all such theories accept normative reduction. On\none reading of Adam Smith's prototypical sentimentalism, although\nhe holds that evaluative judgments concern what emotional response is\nproper, he then defines that notion dispositionally, in terms\nof actual rather than merited responses and endorsements. “To be\nthe proper and approved object” of a sentiment, he writes,\n“can mean nothing but to be the object [of that sentiment] which\nnaturally seems proper, and is approved of (1982: 69). Another reading\nof Smith, which attributes a sentimentalist FA theory to him, has his\nstandard of propriety determined by an essentially normative notion of\nan impartial spectator. \n\nAlthough sentimentalism can adopt dispositionalism rather than FA\ntheory, those versions that embrace normative reduction reduce the\nvalues on which the theory focuses to a primitive normative notion of\nfittingness or merit. Thus the shameful is understood as what merits\nshame, the funny as what merits amusement, and so forth. Moreover,\nsentimentalism can aspire to give a non-circular account of those\nsentiments that are claimed to be part of basic human nature, despite\nhaving (somewhat) different elicitors in different cultures and\nindividuals. How many such sentiments there are, and which ones, is a\nmatter of dispute that need not be entered into here. The important\npoint is that even these forms of sentimentalism need not adopt an FA\ntheory of all values; they can focus on those values that seem most\nintimately tied to specific human sentiments, such as the shameful,\nfunny, fearsome, and pride-worthy. This modest sentimentalism holds an\nFA theory only of certain values, those most amenable to\nresponse-dependency and normative reduction. It must deny\nresponse-independent accounts of these values, such as the incongruity\ntheory of humor, on which the funny is analyzed as the incongruous.\nSentimentalists will hold that such theories are either open to\nmanifold counterexamples or are only speciously response-independent\n(Scruton 1987).  \n\nThe circularity challenge appears most trenchant when wielded against\ngeneric FA theories, since the broad pro-attitudes they require, in\norder to capture all value, seem already to involve the thought that\nsomething is valuable. What is it to approve of some outcome except to\nthink it good, perhaps with a tinge of positive affect? Perhaps desire\ncan be understood more plausibly than approval as an independently\nidentifiable state, which can be characterized without invoking the\nconcept good. But it is less clear that the good is its object, as it\nwould have to be for an FA theory to analyze the desirable in terms of\nfitting desire. It seems equally plausible that desire aims at what is\ngood for the agent. Suppose some outcome would be extremely beneficial\nto me, though indifferent (or worse) when considered impartially. Why\nthink that fitting desires must always take as their object things\nthat are good from the point of view of the universe, rather than good\nfor the person who desires them? It is hard to see why such a desire\nwould be unfitting, not just selfish. Yet one can also desire\nsomething contrary to one's interests when it is sufficiently good for\nothers. Such a desire could also be fitting, it seems. Perhaps this\nproblem can be circumvented by distinguishing reasons to desire\nsomething for some individual's sake (such as the agent), but this\nshows at least that generic FA theories need to draw a further\ndistinction between reasons to desire. Moreover, any account of desire\nthat involves the notion of either good or good-for seems already to\ninvolve the concept it proposes to analyze, and similar problems\nattend accounts in terms of other generic attitudes such as approval\nor preference. Although other accounts of desire or pro-attitudes are\npossible, the circularity worry threatens generic FA theories of value\nbecause they cannot appeal to more specific attitudes that seem more\namenable to characterization without reference to an evaluative\nconcept.  \n\nSensibility theory embraces circularity by holding that values and\nevaluative responses are “made for each other” through a\nprocess of mutual adjustment. This circularity is claimed not to be\nvicious because it has explanatory power. Such an account, on which\nspecific sentiments (e.g., anger) can be refined into emotional\nresponses (resentment) shaped by the property with which they're\nassociated (wrongness), seems to work in some cases. Maybe this\nisn't a vicious circle insofar as it connects wrongness with\nanger (and guilt), thereby elucidating the nature of its motivational\nforce, but this argument is considerably less plausible in other cases.\nIt is hard to see how an analysis of the funny in terms of amusement,\nwhich is then characterized in terms of seeing something as funny,\nelucidates anything. \n\nThe challenge for sentimentalism, by contrast, is to produce a\ntheory of the sentiments on which they can be understood independently\nof the evaluative concepts that the theory uses them to analyze.\nSuggestions about how to do so have been given (Gibbard 1990), but no\nfully developed account has yet been offered. Moreover, sentimentalists\nwho hold even a limited FA theory must give an account of the\nsentiments on which they are amenable to judgments of when they are and\naren't fitting—unlike mere feelings—yet do not\nessentially involve the very concepts that they are meant to elucidate.\nThe theory must avoid circularity while maintaining the resources to\nsolve the wrong kind of reason problem. \n\nFitting attitude theories hold that for something to be valuable is\nfor it to merit some relevant evaluative attitude. Whether framed in\nterms of reasons or some other normative notion, the fundamental issue\nconcerns when there is sufficient reason to have some particular\nevaluative attitude or sentiment such as approval or contempt. These\nare questions over which people can intelligibly disagree; moreover, FA\ntheories seem capable of making sense of fundamental evaluative\ndisagreement. As long as parties to the debate understand the attitude\nin question—which is especially likely when it is part of a\nshared human repertoire of sentiments—they can sensibly disagree\nabout when such reasons obtain, even if they hold very different\nstandards of fittingness. This seems to be just what is at stake in\ndisputes of taste or sensibility: fundamental disagreement over whether\nsomething is funny, disgusting, shameful, and so forth. \n\nHowever, the wrong kind of reason problem poses a challenge to this\ncentral aspiration of FA analysis. The problem is that there seem to be\nreasons for having various attitudes that do not bear directly on the\nevaluative questions that the analyses seek to analyze. Take for\nexample Roger Crisp's (2000) demon who threatens to punish you\nunless you desire a cup of mud. While this seems like a reason to\ndesire the mud, it obviously doesn't make the mud any more\ndesirable. As a result, the question of whether there is reason to\ndesire the mud appears to deviate from the question of whether the mud\nis good. Someone who holds that there is sufficient reason to desire\nit, given by the advantages of having that desire, does not have an\nevaluative disagreement (about desirability) with someone who denies\nthere to be reason to desire such garden-variety mud. Rather, they are\naddressing different questions. Any genuine difference of opinion over\nthe value of the mud requires disagreement over whether there are\nreasons of the right kind for desiring it: the sort of reasons\nthat bear on evaluative judgment, as opposed to reasons to have or\nforbear from having the evaluative attitude (Rabinowicz and\nRönnow-Rasmussen 2004). \n\nOf course, no misunderstanding would arise in this case, as the\nclaim that there are strategic reasons to desire the mud is unlikely to\nbe confused with an evaluation of the mud itself. In this respect\nCrisp's case is typical of those discussed in the literature,\nmost of which pose no real danger of conflation. As a result, the WKR\nproblem has come to be treated simply as a technical objection to FA\nanalysis, which yields apparent counterexamples to the theory. These\ncases are designed precisely to be obviously WKRs, because\nthey are put forward to show that to be valuable isn't simply to\nbe something that there is just any sort of reason to value. The\ncriticism suggests that an FA analysis must be more precise: it must\nequate value with reasons of the right kind for having attitudes, while\nfinding some way to distinguish just these reasons. The obvious cases\non which most of the literature focuses pose no such challenge, since\neveryone agrees that they are not relevant to the evaluative judgment\nat issue.  \n\nBut it has been suggested that in addition to the obvious cases,\nthere are interestingly wrong kinds of reason as well\n(D'Arms and Jacobson 2000a). These are considerations in favor\n(or against) some attitude that fail to bear on the relevant evaluative\njudgment of something despite focusing on its properties. To use an\nexample from Berys Gaut (2007: 241): “Imagine a comedy full of\nhilarious jokes, all of which were so vicious and cruel that audiences\nwatched in stony silence, without being amused at all, since they\ncorrectly thought that it would be wrong to feel amusement.”\nAlthough viciousness and cruelty are properties of these jokes, they\nare supposed to make it the case that amusement at them is contrary to\nvirtue. While some philosophers, such as Gaut himself, take the\nviciousness of a joke always to detract from its humor, others hold\nthat it merely makes appreciating its humor morally problematic\n(Jacobson 2008). After all, the jokes are stipulated to be hilarious.\nAs McDowell (1987: 161, fn. 18) notes: “Much of what is\nordinarily appealed to in ranking objects for amusement is…not\nobviously relevant to this issue [of comic evaluation]; for\ninstance jokes that one may deplore as being ‘in bad taste’\n(usually on moralistic grounds) are not thereby shown not to be\nextremely funny.” Such interesting WKRs can be taken as\nreasons of the right kind and conflated with them, thus creating a form\nof spurious evaluative disagreement, analogous to the spurious\nevaluative disagreement created when a seemingly moral dispute rests on\na factual disagreement. \n\nIntuitively, reasons of the right kind are those that bear on the\nvalue of the object—for instance, reasons to desire the mud that\nbear on whether the mud is desirable. The challenge for FA analyses is\nhow to capture this intuitive idea in a non-tautological fashion. There\nare two general strategies for solving the wrong kind of reason\nproblem. The first is to draw a distinction between object-given and\nstate-given considerations, where a state-given consideration is one\nthat invokes some value of having the evaluative attitude toward an\nobject (e.g., desiring the mud), whereas an object-given consideration\nfocuses only on features of the object (Parfit 2001). Proponents of\nthis distinction hold that state-given considerations can only provide\nreasons of the wrong kind, like the demonic incentive which attaches to\nthe state of desiring the mud; whereas object-given considerations,\nsuch as the mud's foul taste, can provide the right kind of\nreason (not) to desire it. Various technical worries about this\ndistinction have been raised, and attempts to answer them offered\n(Olson 2004, Rabinowicz and Rönnow-Rasmussen 2006). The larger\nworry is that certain features of an object, such as the cruelty of a\njoke or the fact that one is not responsible for some bad trait, do not\nmake any overt reference to a state or attitude. Yet they might\nnevertheless bear on whether to have the state (because amusement is\nvicious or shame counterproductive) without bearing on the value of the\nobject (whether the joke is hilarious or the trait shameful). The force\nof the thought that one should not feel contempt or shame at such\ntraits might depend on the judgment that it would be unfair, or\notherwise vicious, to feel contempt or shame at those traits for which\nthe bearer is not responsible. Interestingly wrong kinds of reason do\nnot wear their normative import on their sleeve, as do obviously wrong\nkinds of reason such as demonic incentives.  \n\nIn addition to the formal test given by the distinction between\nstate-given and object-given reasons, and the psychological test given\nby asking to what attitude one can follow some consideration, there\nmight be a more substantive solution to the problem. A modest form of\nsentimentalism will seek to determine considerations of fit, and thus\nreasons of the right kind, through consideration of the specific\nsentiment at issue. Perhaps it is something about guilt, such as the\nfact that it motivates reparation; and something about shame, such as\nthe fact that it motivates concealment; that explains why lack of fault\nundermines the fittingness of guilt but not shame. If so then reasons\nof the right kind might be distinguished even in the most interesting\nand difficult cases. This will require no mere detour through the\nsentiments, but a more thoroughgoing investigation into\nthem—particularly into the actions they typically motivate and\nthe conditions that alleviate and exacerbate them. To make matters more\nchallenging, this interpretive project must not help itself to\nevaluative concepts, such as the wrong and the shameful, in order to\nexplicate the concerns of guilt and shame. At any rate, to do so would\nbe to give up on the ambition of offering a non-circular theory of even\nthose values most amenable to FA accounts."}]
