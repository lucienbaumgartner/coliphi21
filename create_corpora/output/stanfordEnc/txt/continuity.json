So,\nfor instance, in the later 18th century continuity of a function was\ntaken to mean that infinitesimal changes in the value of the argument\ninduced infinitesimal changes in the value of the function. With the\nabandonment of infinitesimals in the 19th century this definition came\nto be replaced by one employing the more precise concept of\nlimit.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, an infinitesimal quantity is one\nwhich, while not necessarily coinciding with zero, is in some sense\nsmaller than any finite quantity. For engineers, an infinitesimal is a\nquantity so small that its square and all higher powers can be\nneglected. In the theory of limits the term “infinitesimal”\nis sometimes applied to any sequence whose limit is zero. An\ninfinitesimal magnitude may be regarded as what remains after\na continuum has been subjected to an exhaustive analysis, in other\nwords, as a continuum “viewed in the small.” It is in this\nsense that continuous curves have sometimes been held to be\n“composed” of infinitesimal straight lines.\n\n\n\nInfinitesimals have a long and colourful history. They make an early\nappearance in the mathematics of the Greek atomist philosopher\nDemocritus (c. 450 B.C.E.), only to be banished by the mathematician\nEudoxus (c. 350 B.C.E.) in what was to become official\n“Euclidean” mathematics. Taking the somewhat obscure form\nof “indivisibles,” they reappear in the mathematics of the\nlate middle ages and later played an important role in the development\nof the calculus. Their doubtful logical status led in the nineteenth\ncentury to their abandonment and replacement by the limit concept. In\nrecent years, however, the concept of infinitesimal has been refounded\non a rigorous basis.\n\n\n\nWe are all familiar with the idea of continuity. To be\n continuous[1]\n is to constitute an unbroken or\nuninterrupted whole, like the ocean or the sky. A continuous\nentity—a continuum—has no “gaps”.\nOpposed to continuity is discreteness: to be\n discrete[2]\n is to be\nseparated, like the scattered pebbles on a beach or the leaves on a\ntree. Continuity connotes unity; discreteness, plurality. \n\nWhile it is the fundamental nature of a continuum to be\nundivided, it is nevertheless generally (although not\ninvariably) held that any continuum admits of repeated or successive\ndivision without limit. This means that the process\nof dividing it into ever smaller parts will never terminate in an\nindivisible or an atom—that is, a part which,\nlacking proper parts itself, cannot be further divided. In a word,\ncontinua are divisible without limit or infinitely\ndivisible. The unity of a continuum thus conceals a potentially\ninfinite plurality. In antiquity this claim met with the objection\nthat, were one to carry out completely—if only in\nimagination—the process of dividing an extended magnitude, such\nas a continuous line, then the magnitude would be reduced to a\nmultitude of atoms—in this case, extensionless points—or\neven, possibly, to nothing at all. But then, it was held, no matter how\nmany such points there may be—even if infinitely many—they\ncannot be “reassembled” to form the original magnitude, for\nsurely a sum of extensionless elements still lacks\n extension[3].\n Moreover,\nif indeed (as seems unavoidable) infinitely many points remain after\nthe division, then, following Zeno, the magnitude may be taken to be a\n(finite) motion, leading to the seemingly absurd conclusion that\ninfinitely many points can be “touched” in a finite\ntime. \n\nSuch difficulties attended the birth, in the 5th century\nB.C.E., of the school of atomism. The founders of this school,\nLeucippus and Democritus, claimed that matter, and, more generally,\nextension, is not infinitely divisible. Not only would the successive\ndivision of matter ultimately terminate in atoms, that is, in discrete\nparticles incapable of being further divided, but matter had in\nactuality to be conceived as being compounded from such atoms. In\nattacking infinite divisibility the atomists were at the same time\nmounting a claim that the continuous is ultimately reducible to the\ndiscrete, whether it be at the physical, theoretical, or perceptual\nlevel. \n\nThe eventual triumph of the atomic theory in physics and chemistry\nin the 19th century paved the way for the idea of\n“atomism”, as applying to matter, at least, to become\nwidely familiar: it might well be said, to adapt Sir William Harcourt's\nfamous observation in respect of the socialists of his day, “We\nare all atomists now.” Nevertheless, only a minority of\nphilosophers of the past espoused atomism at a metaphysical level, a\nfact which may explain why the analogous doctrine upholding continuity\nlacks a familiar name: that which is unconsciously acknowledged\nrequires no name. Peirce coined the term synechism (from Greek\nsyneche, “continuous”) for his own\nphilosophy—a philosophy permeated by the idea of continuity in\nits sense of “being\n connected”[4].\n In this article I shall\nappropriate Peirce's term and use it in a sense shorn of its Peircean\novertones, simply as a contrary to atomism. I shall also use the term\n“divisionism” for the more specific doctrine that continua\nare infinitely divisible. \n\nClosely associated with the concept of a continuum is that of\n infinitesimal.[5]\n An infinitesimal magnitude has been\nsomewhat hazily conceived as a continuum “viewed in the\nsmall,” an “ultimate part” of a continuum. In\nsomething like the same sense as a discrete entity is made up of its\nindividual units, its “indivisibles”, so, it was\nmaintained, a continuum is “composed” of infinitesimal\nmagnitudes, its ultimate parts. (It is in this sense, for example, that\nmathematicians of the 17th century held that continuous\ncurves are “composed” of infinitesimal straight lines.) Now\nthe “coherence” of a continuum entails that each of its\n(connected) parts is also a continuum, and, accordingly, divisible.\nSince points are indivisible, it follows that no point can be part of a\ncontinuum. Infinitesimal magnitudes, as parts of continua, cannot, of\nnecessity, be points: they are, in a word, nonpunctiform. \n\nMagnitudes are normally taken as being extensive\nquantities, like mass or volume, which are defined over extended\nregions of space. By contrast, infinitesimal magnitudes have been\nconstrued as intensive magnitudes resembling locally defined\nintensive quantities such as temperature or density. The effect of\n“distributing” or “integrating” an intensive\nquantity over such an intensive magnitude is to convert the former into\nan infinitesimal extensive quantity: thus temperature is transformed\ninto infinitesimal heat and density into infinitesimal mass. When the\ncontinuum is the trace of a motion, the associated\ninfinitesimal/intensive magnitudes have been identified as\npotential magnitudes—entities which, while not\npossessing true magnitude themselves, possess a tendency to\ngenerate magnitude through motion, so manifesting\n“becoming” as opposed to “being”. \n\nAn infinitesimal number is one which, while not coinciding\nwith zero, is in some sense smaller than any finite number. This sense\nhas often been taken to be the failure to satisfy the Principle of\nArchimedes, which amounts to saying that an infinitesimal number\nis one that, no matter how many times it is added to itself, the result\nremains less than any finite number. In the engineer's practical\ntreatment of the differential calculus, an infinitesimal is a number so\nsmall that its square and all higher powers can be neglected. In the\ntheory of limits the term “infinitesimal” is sometimes\napplied to any sequence whose limit is zero. \n\nThe concept of an indivisible is closely allied to, but to\nbe distinguished from, that of an infinitesimal. An indivisible is, by\ndefinition, something that cannot be divided, which is usually\nunderstood to mean that it has no proper parts. Now a partless, or\nindivisible entity does not necessarily have to be infinitesimal:\nsouls, individual consciousnesses, and Leibnizian monads all supposedly\nlack parts but are surely not infinitesimal. But these have in common\nthe feature of being unextended; extended entities such as lines,\nsurfaces, and volumes prove a much richer source of\n“indivisibles”. Indeed, if the process of dividing such\nentities were to terminate, as the atomists maintained, it would\nnecessarily issue in indivisibles of a qualitatively different nature.\nIn the case of a straight line, such indivisibles would, plausibly, be\npoints; in the case of a circle, straight lines; and in the case of a\ncylinder divided by sections parallel to its base, circles. In each\ncase the indivisible in question is infinitesimal in the sense of\npossessing one fewer dimension than the figure from which it is\ngenerated. In the 16th and 17th centuries\nindivisibles in this sense were used in the calculation of areas and\nvolumes of curvilinear figures, a surface or volume being thought of as\na collection, or sum, of linear, or planar indivisibles\nrespectively. \n\nThe concept of infinitesimal was beset by controversy from its\nbeginnings. The idea makes an early appearance in the mathematics of\nthe Greek atomist philosopher Democritus c. 450 B.C.E., only to be\nbanished c. 350 B.C.E. by Eudoxus in what was to become official\n“Euclidean” mathematics. We have noted their reappearance\nas indivisibles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: in this\nform they were systematically employed by Kepler, Galileo's student\nCavalieri, the Bernoulli clan, and a number of other mathematicians. In\nthe guise of the beguilingly named “linelets” and\n“timelets”, infinitesimals played an essential role in\nBarrow's “method for finding tangents by calculation”,\nwhich appears in his Lectiones Geometricae of 1670. As\n“evanescent quantities” infinitesimals were instrumental\n(although later abandoned) in Newton's development of the calculus,\nand, as “inassignable quantities”, in Leibniz's. The\nMarquis de l'Hôpital, who in 1696 published the first treatise on\nthe differential calculus (entitled Analyse des Infiniments Petits\npour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes), invokes the concept in\npostulating that “a curved line may be regarded as being made up\nof infinitely small straight line segments,” and that “one\ncan take as equal two quantities differing by an infinitely small\nquantity.” \n\nHowever useful it may have been in practice, the concept of\ninfinitesimal could scarcely withstand logical scrutiny. Derided by\nBerkeley in the 18th century as “ghosts of departed\nquantities”, in the 19th century execrated by Cantor\nas “cholera-bacilli” infecting mathematics, and in the\n20th roundly condemned by Bertrand Russell as\n“unnecessary, erroneous, and self-contradictory”, these\nuseful, but logically dubious entities were believed to have been\nfinally supplanted in the foundations of analysis by the limit concept\nwhich took rigorous and final form in the latter half of the\n19th century. By the beginning of the 20th\ncentury, the concept of infinitesimal had become, in analysis at least,\na virtual “unconcept”. \n\nNevertheless the proscription of infinitesimals did not succeed in\nextirpating them; they were, rather, driven further underground.\nPhysicists and engineers, for example, never abandoned their use as a\nheuristic device for the derivation of correct results in the\napplication of the calculus to physical problems. Differential\ngeometers of the stature of Lie and Cartan relied on their use in the\nformulation of concepts which would later be put on a\n“rigorous” footing. And, in a technical sense, they lived\non in the algebraists' investigations of nonarchimedean fields. \n\nA new phase in the long contest between the continuous and the\ndiscrete has opened in the past few decades with the refounding of the\nconcept of infinitesimal on a solid basis. This has been achieved in\ntwo essentially different ways, the one providing a rigorous\nformulation of the idea of infinitesimal number, the other of\ninfinitesimal magnitude. \n\nFirst, in the nineteen sixties Abraham Robinson, using methods of\nmathematical logic, created nonstandard analysis, an extension\nof mathematical analysis embracing both “infinitely large”\nand infinitesimal numbers in which the usual laws of the arithmetic of\nreal numbers continue to hold, an idea which, in essence, goes back to\nLeibniz. Here by an infinitely large number is meant one which exceeds\nevery positive integer; the reciprocal of any one of these is\ninfinitesimal in the sense that, while being nonzero, it is smaller\nthan every positive fraction 1/n. Much of the usefulness of\nnonstandard analysis stems from the fact that within it every statement\nof ordinary analysis involving limits has a succinct and highly\nintuitive translation into the language of infinitesimals. \n\nThe second development in the refounding of the concept of\ninfinitesimal took place in the nineteen seventies with the emergence\nof synthetic differential geometry, also known as smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis. Based on the ideas of the American\nmathematician F. W. Lawvere, and employing the methods of category\ntheory, smooth infinitesimal analysis provides an image of the world in\nwhich the continuous is an autonomous notion, not explicable in terms\nof the discrete. It provides a rigorous framework for mathematical\nanalysis in which every function between spaces is smooth (i.e.,\ndifferentiable arbitrarily many times, and so in particular continuous)\nand in which the use of limits in defining the basic notions of the\ncalculus is replaced by nilpotent infinitesimals, that is, of\nquantities so small (but not actually zero) that some power—most\nusefully, the square—vanishes. Smooth infinitesimal analysis\nembodies a concept of intensive magnitude in the form of\ninfinitesimal tangent vectors to curves. A tangent vector to a\ncurve at a point p on it is a short straight line segment\nl passing through the point and pointing along the curve. In\nfact we may take l actually to be an infinitesimal\npart of the curve. Curves in smooth infinitesimal analysis are\n“locally straight” and accordingly may be conceived as\nbeing “composed of” infinitesimal straight lines in de\nl'Hôpital's sense, or as being “generated” by an\ninfinitesimal tangent vector. \n\nThe development of nonstandard and smooth infinitesimal analysis has\nbreathed new life into the concept of infinitesimal,\nand—especially in connection with smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis—supplied novel insights into the nature of the\ncontinuum. \n\nThe opposition between Continuity and Discreteness played a\nsignificant role in ancient Greek philosophy. This probably derived\nfrom the still more fundamental question concerning the One and the\nMany, an antithesis lying at the heart of early Greek thought (see\nStokes [1971]). The Greek debate over the continuous and the discrete\nseems to have been ignited by the efforts of Eleatic philosophers such\nas Parmenides (c. 515 B.C.E.), and Zeno (c. 460 B.C.E.) to establish\ntheir doctrine of absolute\n monism[6].\n They were concerned to\nshow that the divisibility of Being into parts leads to contradiction,\nso forcing the conclusion that the apparently diverse world is a\nstatic, changeless\n unity.[7]\n In his Way of Truth Parmenides\nasserts that Being is homogeneous and continuous.\nHowever in asserting the continuity of Being Parmenides is likely no\nmore than underscoring its essential unity. Parmenides seems to be\nclaiming that Being is more than merely continuous—that it is, in\nfact, a single whole, indeed an indivisible whole. The single\nParmenidean existent is a continuum without parts, at once a continuum\nand an atom. If Parmenides was a synechist, his absolute monism\nprecluded his being at the same time a divisionist. \n\nIn support of Parmenides' doctrine of changelessness Zeno formulated\nhis famous paradoxes of motion. (see entry on\n Zeno's paradoxes)\n The Dichotomy\nand Achilles paradoxes both rest explicitly on the limitless\ndivisibility of space and time. \n\nThe doctrine of\n Atomism,[8]\n which seems to have\narisen as an attempt at escaping the Eleatic dilemma, was first and\nforemost a physical theory. It was mounted by Leucippus (fl.\n440 B.C.E.) and Democritus (b. 460–457 B.C.E.) who maintained\nthat matter was not divisible without limit, but composed of\nindivisible, solid, homogeneous, spatially extended corpuscles, all\nbelow the level of visibility. \n\nAtomism was challenged by Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.), who was\nthe first to undertake the systematic analysis of continuity and\ndiscreteness. A thoroughgoing synechist, he maintained that physical\nreality is a continuous plenum, and that the structure of a continuum,\ncommon to space, time and motion, is not reducible to anything else.\nHis answer to the Eleatic problem was that continuous magnitudes are\npotentially divisible to infinity, in the sense that they may be\ndivided anywhere, though they cannot be divided\neverywhere at the same time. \n\nAristotle identifies continuity and discreteness as attributes\napplying to the category of\n Quantity[9].\n As examples of\ncontinuous quantities, or continua, he offers lines, planes,\nsolids (i.e., solid bodies), extensions, movement, time and space;\namong discrete quantities he includes\n number[10]\n and\n speech[11].\n He also\nlays down definitions of a number of terms, including continuity. In\neffect, Aristotle defines continuity as a relation between\nentities rather than as an attribute appertaining to a single\nentity; that is to say, he does not provide an explicit definition of\nthe concept of continuum. He observes that a single continuous\nwhole can be brought into existence by “gluing together”\ntwo things which have been brought into contact, which suggests that\nthe continuity of a whole should derive from the way its parts\n“join up”. Accordingly for Aristotle quantities such as\nlines and planes, space and time are continuous by virtue of the fact\nthat their constituent parts “join together at some common\nboundary”. By contrast no constituent parts of a\ndiscrete quantity can possess a common boundary. \n\nOne of the central theses Aristotle is at pains to defend is the\nirreducibility of the continuum to discreteness—that a continuum\ncannot be “composed” of indivisibles or atoms, parts which\ncannot themselves be further divided. \n\nAristotle sometimes recognizes infinite\ndivisibility—the property of being divisible into parts\nwhich can themselves be further divided, the process never terminating\nin an indivisible—as a consequence of continuity as he\ncharacterizes the notion. But on occasion he takes the property of\ninfinite divisibility as defining continuity. It is this\ndefinition of continuity that figures in Aristotle's demonstration of\nwhat has come to be known as the isomorphism thesis,\nwhich asserts that either magnitude, time and motion are all\ncontinuous, or they are all discrete. \n\nThe question of whether magnitude is perpetually divisible into\nsmaller units, or divisible only down to some atomic magnitude leads to\nthe dilemma of divisibility (see Miller [1982]), a difficulty\nthat Aristotle necessarily had to face in connection with his analysis\nof the continuum. In the dilemma's first, or nihilistic horn,\nit is argued that, were magnitude everywhere divisible, the process of\ncarrying out this division completely would reduce a magnitude to\nextensionless points, or perhaps even to nothingness. The second, or\natomistic, horn starts from the assumption that magnitude is\nnot everywhere divisible and leads to the equally unpalatable\nconclusion (for Aristotle, at least) that indivisible magnitudes must\nexist. \n\nAs a thoroughgoing materialist,\n Epicurus[12]\n (341–271\nB.C.E.) could not accept the notion of potentiality on which\nAristotle's theory of continuity rested, and so was propelled towards\natomism in both its conceptual and physical senses. Like Leucippus and\nDemocritus, Epicurus felt it necessary to postulate the existence of\nphysical atoms, but to avoid Aristotle's strictures he proposed that\nthese should not be themselves conceptually indivisible, but should\ncontain conceptually indivisible parts. Aristotle had shown\nthat a continuous magnitude could not be composed of points,\nthat is, indivisible units lacking extension, but he had not shown that\nan indivisible unit must necessarily lack extension. Epicurus met\nAristotle's argument that a continuum could not be composed of such\nindivisibles by taking indivisibles to be partless units of magnitude\npossessing extension. \n\nIn opposition to the atomists, the Stoic philosophers Zeno of Cition\n(fl. 250 B.C.E.) and Chrysippus (280–206 B.C.E.) upheld the\nAristotelian position that space, time, matter and motion are all\ncontinuous (see Sambursky [1963], [1971]; White [1992]). And, like\nAristotle, they explicitly rejected any possible existence of void\nwithin the cosmos. The cosmos is pervaded by a continuous invisible\nsubstance which they called pneuma (Greek:\n“breath”). This pneuma—which was regarded as a kind\nof synthesis of air and fire, two of the four basic elements, the\nothers being earth and water—was conceived as being an elastic\nmedium through which impulses are transmitted by wave motion. All\nphysical occurrences were viewed as being linked through tensile forces\nin the pneuma, and matter itself was held to derive its qualities from\nthe “binding” properties of the pneuma it contains. \n\nThe scholastic philosophers of Medieval Europe, in thrall to the\nmassive authority of Aristotle, mostly subscribed in one form or\nanother to the thesis, argued with great effectiveness by the Master in\nBook VI of the Physics, that continua cannot be composed of\nindivisibles. On the other hand, the avowed infinitude of the Deity of\nscholastic theology, which ran counter to Aristotle's thesis that the\ninfinite existed only in a potential sense, emboldened certain of the\nSchoolmen to speculate that the actual infinite might be found even\noutside the Godhead, for instance in the assemblage of points on a\ncontinuous line. A few scholars of the time, for example Henry of\nHarclay (c. 1275–1317) and Nicholas of Autrecourt (c. 1300–69) chose to\nfollow Epicurus in upholding atomism reasonable and attempted to\ncircumvent Aristotle's counterarguments (see Pyle [1997]). \n\nThis incipient atomism met with a determined synechist rebuttal,\ninitiated by John Duns Scotus (c. 1266–1308). In his analysis of the\nproblem of “whether an angel can move from place to place with a\ncontinuous motion” he offers a pair of purely geometrical\narguments against the composition of a continuum out of indivisibles.\nOne of these arguments is that if the diagonal and the side of a square\nwere both composed of points, then not only would the two be\ncommensurable in violation of Book X of Euclid, they would even be\nequal. In the other, two unequal circles are constructed about a common\ncentre, and from the supposition that the larger circle is composed of\npoints, part of an angle is shown to be equal to the whole, in\nviolation of Euclid's axiom V. \n\nWilliam of Ockham (c. 1280–1349) brought a considerable degree of\ndialectical\n subtlety[13]\n to his analysis of continuity; it has been\nthe subject of much scholarly\n dispute[14].\n For Ockham the\nprincipal difficulty presented by the continuous is the infinite\ndivisibility of space, and in general, that of any continuum. The\ntreatment of continuity in the first book of his Quodlibet of\n1322–7 rests on the idea that between any two points on a line there is\na third—perhaps the first explicit formulation of the property of\ndensity—and on the distinction between a\ncontinuum “whose parts form a unity” from a\ncontiguum of juxtaposed things. Ockham recognizes that it\nfollows from the property of density that on arbitrarily small\nstretches of a line infinitely many points must lie, but resists the\nconclusion that lines, or indeed any continuum, consists of points.\nConcerned, rather, to determine “the sense in which the line may\nbe said to consist or to be made up of anything.”, Ockham claims\nthat “no part of the line is indivisible, nor is any part of a\ncontinuum indivisible.” While Ockham does not assert that a line\nis actually “composed” of points, he had the insight,\nstartling in its prescience, that a punctate and yet continuous line\nbecomes a possibility when conceived as a dense array of points, rather\nthan as an assemblage of points in contiguous succession. \n\nThe most ambitious and systematic attempt at refuting atomism in the\n14th century was mounted by Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1290\n– 1349). The purpose of his Tractatus de Continuo (c.\n1330) was to “prove that the opinion which maintains continua to\nbe composed of indivisibles is false.” This was to be achieved by\nsetting forth a number of “first principles” concerning the\ncontinuum—akin to the axioms and postulates of Euclid's\nElements—and then demonstrating that the further\nassumption that a continuum is composed of indivisibles leads to\nabsurdities (see Murdoch [1957]). \n\nThe views on the continuum of Nicolaus Cusanus (1401–64), a champion\nof the actual infinite, are of considerable interest. In his De\nMente Idiotae of 1450, he asserts that any continuum, be it\ngeometric, perceptual, or physical, is divisible in two senses, the one\nideal, the other actual. Ideal division “progresses to\ninfinity”; actual division terminates in atoms after finitely\nmany steps. \n\nCusanus's realist conception of the actual infinite is reflected in\nhis quadrature of the circle (see Boyer [1959], p. 91). He took the\ncircle to be an infinilateral regular polygon, that is, a\nregular polygon with an infinite number of (infinitesimally short)\nsides. By dividing it up into a correspondingly infinite number of\ntriangles, its area, as for any regular polygon, can be computed as\nhalf the product of the apothem (in this case identical with the\nradius of the circle), and the perimeter. The idea of considering a\ncurve as an infinilateral polygon was employed by a number of later\nthinkers, for instance, Kepler, Galileo and Leibniz. \n\nThe early modern period saw the spread of knowledge in Europe of\nancient geometry, particularly that of Archimedes, and a loosening of\nthe Aristotelian grip on thinking. In regard to the problem of the\ncontinuum, the focus shifted away from metaphysics to technique, from\nthe problem of “what indivisibles were, or\nwhether they composed magnitudes” to “the new\nmarvels one could accomplish with them” (see Murdoch\n[1957], p. 325) through the emerging calculus and mathematical\nanalysis. Indeed, tracing the development of the continuum concept\nduring this period is tantamount to charting the rise of the calculus.\nTraditionally, geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the\ncontinuous and arithmetic (or algebra) with the discrete. The\ninfinitesimal calculus that took form in the 16th and\n17th centuries, which had as its primary subject matter\ncontinuous variation, may be seen as a kind of synthesis of\nthe continuous and the discrete, with infinitesimals bridging the gap\nbetween the two. The widespread use of indivisibles and infinitesimals\nin the analysis of continuous variation by the mathematicians of the\ntime testifies to the affirmation of a kind of mathematical atomism\nwhich, while logically questionable, made possible the spectacular\nmathematical advances with which the calculus is associated. It was\nthus to be the infinitesimal, rather than the infinite, that served as\nthe mathematical stepping stone between the continuous and the\ndiscrete. \n\nJohann Kepler (1571–1630) made abundant use of infinitesimals in his\ncalculations. In his Nova Stereometria of 1615, a work\nactually written as an aid in calculating the volumes of wine casks, he\nregards curves as being infinilateral polygons, and solid bodies as\nbeing made up of infinitesimal cones or infinitesimally thin discs (see\nBaron [1987], pp. 108–116; Boyer [1969], pp. 106–110). Such uses are in\nkeeping with Kepler's customary use of infinitesimals of the same\ndimension as the figures they constitute; but he also used indivisibles\non occasion. He spoke, for example, of a cone as being composed of\ncircles, and in his Astronomia Nova of 1609, the work in which\nhe states his famous laws of planetary motion, he takes the area of an\nellipse to be the “sum of the radii” drawn from the\nfocus. \n\nIt seems to have been Kepler who first introduced the idea, which\nwas later to become a reigning principle in geometry, of continuous\nchange of a mathematical object, in this case, of a geometric\nfigure. In his Astronomiae pars Optica of 1604 Kepler notes\nthat all the conic sections are continuously derivable from one another\nboth through focal motion and by variation of the angle with the cone\nof the cutting plane. \n\nGalileo Galilei (1564–1642) advocated a form of mathematical atomism\nin which the influence of both the Democritean atomists and the\nAristotelian scholastics can be discerned. This emerges when one turns\nto the First Day of Galileo's Dialogues Concerning Two New\nSciences (1638). Salviati, Galileo's spokesman, maintains,\ncontrary to Bradwardine and the Aristotelians, that continuous\nmagnitude is made up of indivisibles, indeed an infinite number of\nthem. Salviati/Galileo recognizes that this infinity of indivisibles\nwill never be produced by successive subdivision, but claims to have a\nmethod for generating it all at once, thereby removing it from the\nrealm of the potential into actual realization: this “method for\nseparating and resolving, at a single stroke, the whole of\ninfinity” turns out simply to the act of bending a straight line\ninto a circle. Here Galileo finds an ingenious\n“metaphysical” application of the idea of regarding the\ncircle as an infinilateral polygon. When the straight line has been\nbent into a circle Galileo seems to take it that that the line has\nthereby been rendered into indivisible parts, that is, points. But if\none considers that these parts are the sides of the infinilateral\npolygon, they are better characterized not as indivisible points, but\nrather as unbendable straight lines, each at once part of and tangent\nto the\n circle[15].\n Galileo does not mention this\npossibility, but nevertheless it does not seem fanciful to detect the\ngerm here of the idea of considering a curve as a an assemblage of\ninfinitesimal “unbendable” straight\n lines.[16] \n\nIt was Galileo's pupil and colleague Bonaventura Cavalieri\n(1598–1647) who refined the use of indivisibles into a reliable\nmathematical tool (see Boyer [1959]); indeed the “method of\nindivisibles” remains associated with his name to the present\nday. Cavalieri nowhere explains precisely what he understands by the\nword “indivisible”, but it is apparent that he conceived of\na surface as composed of a multitude of equispaced parallel lines and\nof a volume as composed of equispaced parallel planes, these being\ntermed the indivisibles of the surface and the volume respectively.\nWhile Cavalieri recognized that these “multitudes” of\nindivisibles must be unboundedly large, indeed was prepared to regard\nthem as being actually infinite, he avoided following Galileo into\nensnarement in the coils of infinity by grasping that, for the\n“method of indivisibles” to work, the precise\n“number” of indivisibles involved did not matter.\nIndeed, the essence of Cavalieri's method was the establishing of a\ncorrespondence between the indivisibles of two “similar”\nconfigurations, and in the cases Cavalieri considers it is evident that\nthe correspondence is suggested on solely geometric grounds, rendering\nit quite independent of number. The very statement of Cavalieri's\nprinciple embodies this idea: if plane figures are included between a\npair of parallel lines, and if their intercepts on any line parallel to\nthe including lines are in a fixed ratio, then the areas of the figures\nare in the same ratio. (An analogous principle holds for solids.)\nCavalieri's method is in essence that of reduction of dimension: solids\nare reduced to planes with comparable areas and planes to lines with\ncomparable lengths. While this method suffices for the computation of\nareas or volumes, it cannot be applied to rectify curves, since the\nreduction in this case would be to points, and no meaning can be\nattached to the “ratio” of two points. For rectification a\ncurve has, it was later realized, to be regarded as the sum, not of\nindivisibles, that is, points, but rather of infinitesimal straight\nlines, its microsegments. \n\nRené Descartes (1596–1650) employed infinitesimalist\ntechniques, including Cavalieri's method of indivisibles, in his\nmathematical work. But he avoided the use of infinitesimals in the\ndetermination of tangents to curves, instead developing purely\nalgebraic methods for the purpose. Some of his sharpest criticism was\ndirected at those mathematicians, such as Fermat, who used\ninfinitesimals in the construction of tangents. \n\nAs a philosopher Descartes may be broadly characterized as a\nsynechist. His philosophical system rests on two fundamental\nprinciples: the celebrated Cartesian dualism—the division between\nmind and matter—and the less familiar identification of matter\nand spatial extension. In the Meditations Descartes\ndistinguishes mind and matter on the grounds that the corporeal, being\nspatially extended, is divisible, while the mental is partless. The\nidentification of matter and spatial extension has the consequence that\nmatter is continuous and divisible without limit. Since extension is\nthe sole essential property of matter and, conversely, matter always\naccompanies extension, matter must be ubiquitous. Descartes' space is\naccordingly, as it was for the Stoics, a plenum pervaded by a\ncontinuous medium. \n\nThe concept of infinitesimal had arisen with problems of a geometric\ncharacter and infinitesimals were originally conceived as belonging\nsolely to the realm of continuous magnitude as opposed to that of\ndiscrete number. But from the algebra and analytic geometry of the\n16th and 17th centuries there issued the concept\nof infinitesimal number. The idea first appears in the work of\nPierre de Fermat (see Boyer [1959]) (1601–65) on the determination of\nmaximum and minimum (extreme) values, published in 1638. \n\nFermat's treatment of maxima and minima contains the germ of the\nfertile technique of “infinitesimal variation”, that is,\nthe investigation of the behaviour of a function by subjecting its\nvariables to small changes. Fermat applied this method in determining\ntangents to curves and centres of gravity. \n\nIsaac\n Barrow[17]\n (1630–77) was one of the first\nmathematicians to grasp the reciprocal relation between the problem of\nquadrature and that of finding tangents to curves—in modern\nparlance, between integration and differentiation. In his Lectiones\nGeometricae of 1670, Barrow observes, in essence, that if the\nquadrature of a curve y = f(x) is known,\nwith the area up to x given by F(x), then\nthe subtangent to the curve y = F(x) is\nmeasured by the ratio of its ordinate to the ordinate of the original\ncurve. \n\nBarrow, a thoroughgoing synechist, regarded the conflict between\ndivisionism and atomism as a live issue, and presented a number of\narguments against mathematical atomism, the strongest of which is that\natomism contradicts many of the basic propositions of Euclidean\ngeometry. \n\nBarrow conceived of continuous magnitudes as being generated by\nmotions, and so necessarily dependent on time, a view that seems to\nhave had a strong influence on the thinking of his illustrious pupil\nIsaac\n Newton[18]\n (1642–1727). Newton's meditations\nduring the plague year 1665–66 issued in the invention of what he\ncalled the “Calculus of Fluxions”, the principles and\nmethods of which were presented in three tracts published many years\nafter they were\n written[19]\n : De analysi per aequationes numero\nterminorum infinitas; Methodus fluxionum et serierum infinitarum;\nand De quadratura curvarum. Newton's approach to the\ncalculus rests, even more firmly than did Barrow's, on the conception\nof continua as being generated by motion. \n\nBut Newton's exploitation of the kinematic conception went much\ndeeper than had Barrow's. In De Analysi, for example, Newton\nintroduces a notation for the “momentary increment”\n(moment)—evidently meant to represent a moment or\ninstant of time—of the abscissa or the area of a curve, with the\nabscissa itself representing time. This\n“moment”—effectively the same as the infinitesimal\nquantities previously introduced by Fermat and Barrow—Newton\ndenotes by o in the case of the abscissa, and by ov\nin the case of the area. From the fact that Newton uses the letter\nv for the ordinate, it may be inferred that Newton is thinking\nof the curve as being a graph of velocity against time. By considering\nthe moving line, or ordinate, as the moment of the area Newton\nestablished the generality of and reciprocal relationship between the\noperations of differentiation and integration, a fact that Barrow had\ngrasped but had not put to systematic use. Before Newton, quadrature or\nintegration had rested ultimately “on some process through which\nelemental triangles or rectangles were added together”, that is,\non the method of indivisibles. Newton's explicit treatment of\nintegration as inverse differentiation was the key to the integral\ncalculus. \n\nIn the Methodus fluxionum Newton makes explicit his\nconception of variable quantities as generated by motions, and\nintroduces his characteristic notation. He calls the quantity generated\nby a motion a fluent, and its rate of generation a\nfluxion. The fluxion of a fluent x is denoted by\n x·,\n and its moment,\nor “infinitely small increment accruing in an infinitely short\ntime o”, by\n x·o. The problem of\ndetermining a tangent to a curve is transformed into the problem of\nfinding the relationship between the fluxions\n x·\n and\n z·\n when presented with an equation representing the\nrelationship between the fluents x and z. (A\nquadrature is the inverse problem, that of determining the fluents when\nthe fluxions are given.) Thus, for example, in the case of the fluent\nz = xn, Newton first forms\n z·\n +\n z·o =\n (x· +\n x·o)n, expands the\nright-hand side using the binomial theorem, subtracts z =\nxn, divides through by o,\nneglects all terms still containing o, and so obtains\n z·\n =\nnxn−1x·. \n\nNewton later became discontented with the undeniable presence of\ninfinitesimals in his calculus, and dissatisfied with the dubious\nprocedure of “neglecting” them. In the preface to the\nDe quadratura curvarum he remarks that there is no necessity\nto introduce into the method of fluxions any argument about infinitely\nsmall quantities. In their place he proposes to employ what he calls\nthe method of prime and ultimate ratio. This method, in many\nrespects an anticipation of the limit concept, receives a number of\nallusions in Newton's celebrated Principia mathematica philosophiae\nnaturalis of 1687. \n\nNewton developed three approaches for his calculus, all of which he\nregarded as leading to equivalent results, but which varied in their\ndegree of rigour. The first employed infinitesimal quantities which,\nwhile not finite, are at the same time not exactly zero. Finding that\nthese eluded precise formulation, Newton focussed instead on their\nratio, which is in general a finite number. If this ratio is known, the\ninfinitesimal quantities forming it may be replaced by any suitable\nfinite magnitudes—such as velocities or fluxions—having the\nsame ratio. This is the method of fluxions. Recognizing that this\nmethod itself required a foundation, Newton supplied it with one in the\nform of the doctrine of prime and ultimate ratios, a kinematic form of\nthe theory of limits. \n\nThe philosopher-mathematician G. W. F.\n Leibniz[20]\n (1646–1716) was\ngreatly preoccupied with the problem of the composition of the\ncontinuum—the “labyrinth of the continuum”, as he\ncalled it. Indeed we have it on his own testimony that his\nphilosophical system—monadism—grew from his\nstruggle with the problem of just how, or whether, a continuum can be\nbuilt from indivisible elements. Leibniz asked himself: if we grant\nthat each real entity is either a simple unity or a multiplicity, and\nthat a multiplicity is necessarily an aggregation of unities, then\nunder what head should a geometric continuum such as a line be\nclassified? Now a line is extended and Leibniz held that extension is a\nform of repetition, so, a line, being divisible into parts, cannot be a\n(true) unity. It is then a multiplicity, and accordingly an aggregation\nof unities. But of what sort of unities? Seemingly, the only candidates\nfor geometric unities are points, but points are no more than\nextremities of the extended, and in any case, as Leibniz knew, solid\narguments going back to Aristotle establish that no continuum can be\nconstituted from points. It follows that a continuum is neither a unity\nnor an aggregation of unities. Leibniz concluded that continua are\nnot real entities at all; as “wholes preceding\ntheir parts” they have instead a purely ideal character. In this\nway he freed the continuum from the requirement that, as something\nintelligible, it must itself be simple or a compound of simples. \n\nLeibniz held that space and time, as continua, are ideal, and\nanything real, in particular matter, is discrete, compounded of simple\nunit substances he termed monads. \n\nAmong the best known of Leibniz's doctrines is the\nPrinciple or Law of Continuity. In a somewhat\nnebulous form this principle had been employed on occasion by a number\nof Leibniz's predecessors, including Cusanus and Kepler, but it was\nLeibniz who gave to the principle “a clarity of formulation which\nhad previously been lacking and perhaps for this reason regarded it as\nhis own discovery” (Boyer 1959, p. 217). In a letter to Bayle of\n1687, Leibniz gave the following formulation of the principle:\n“in any supposed transition, ending in any terminus, it is\npermissible to institute a general reasoning in which the final\nterminus may be included.” This would seem to indicate that\nLeibniz considered “transitions” of any kind as continuous.\nCertainly he held this to be the case in geometry and for natural\nprocesses, where it appears as the principle Natura non facit\nsaltus. According to Leibniz, it is the Law of Continuity that\nallows geometry and the evolving methods of the infinitesimal calculus\nto be applicable in physics. The Principle of Continuity also furnished\nthe chief grounds for Leibniz's rejection of material atomism. \n\nThe Principle of Continuity also played an important underlying role\nin Leibniz's mathematical work, especially in his development of the\ninfinitesimal calculus. Leibniz's essays Nova Methodus of 1684\nand De Geometri Recondita of 1686 may be said to represent the\nofficial births of the differential and integral calculi, respectively.\nHis approach to the calculus, in which the use of infinitesimals, plays\na central role, has combinatorial roots, traceable to his early work on\nderived sequences of numbers. Given a curve determined by correlated\nvariables x, y, he wrote dx and dy\nfor infinitesimal differences, or differentials, between the\nvalues x and y: and dy/dx for the\nratio of the two, which he then took to represent the slope of the\ncurve at the corresponding point. This suggestive, if highly formal\nprocedure led Leibniz to evolve rules for calculating with\ndifferentials, which was achieved by appropriate modification of the\nrules of calculation for ordinary numbers. \n\nAlthough the use of infinitesimals was instrumental in Leibniz's\napproach to the calculus, in 1684 he introduced the concept of\ndifferential without mentioning infinitely small quantities, almost\ncertainly in order to avoid foundational difficulties. He states\nwithout proof the following rules of differentiation: \n\nBut behind the formal beauty of these rules—an early\nmanifestation of what was later to flower into differential\nalgebra—the presence of infinitesimals makes itself felt, since\nLeibniz's definition of tangent employs both infinitely small distances\nand the conception of a curve as an infinilateral polygon. \n\nLeibniz conceived of differentials dx, dy as\nvariables ranging over differences. This enabled him to take the\nimportant step of regarding the symbol d as an\noperator acting on variables, so paving the way for the\niterated application of d, leading to the\nhigher differentials ddx = d2x,\nd3x = dd2x,\nand in general dn+1x =\nddnx. Leibniz supposed that the\nfirst-order differentials dx, dy,…. were\nincomparably smaller than, or infinitesimal with respect to, the finite\nquantities x, y,…, and, in general, that an\nanalogous relation obtained between the\n(n+1)th-order differentials\ndn+1x and the\nnth-order differentials\ndnx. He also assumed that the\nnth power (dx)n of a\nfirst-order differential was of the same order of magnitude as an\nnth-order differential\ndnx, in the sense that the quotient\ndnx/(dx)n is\na finite quantity. \n\nFor Leibniz the incomparable smallness of infinitesimals derived\nfrom their failure to satisfy Archimedes' principle; and quantities\ndiffering only by an infinitesimal were to be considered equal. But\nwhile infinitesimals were conceived by Leibniz to be incomparably\nsmaller than ordinary numbers, the Law of Continuity ensured that they\nwere governed by the same laws as the latter. \n\nLeibniz's attitude toward infinitesimals and differentials seems to\nhave been that they furnished the elements from which to fashion a\nformal grammar, an algebra, of the continuous. Since he regarded\ncontinua as purely ideal entities, it was then perfectly consistent for\nhim to maintain, as he did, that infinitesimal quantities themselves\nare no less ideal—simply useful fictions, introduced to shorten\narguments and aid insight. \n\nAlthough Leibniz himself did not credit the infinitesimal or the\n(mathematical) infinite with objective existence, a number of his\nfollowers did not hesitate to do so. Among the most prominent of these\nwas Johann Bernoulli (1667–1748). A letter of his to Leibniz\nwritten in 1698 contains the forthright assertion that “inasmuch\nas the number of terms in nature is infinite, the infinitesimal exists\nipso facto.” One of his arguments for the existence of\nactual infinitesimals begins with the positing of the infinite sequence\n1/2, 1/3, 1/4,…. If there are ten terms, one tenth exists; if a\nhundred, then a hundredth exists, etc.; and so if, as postulated, the\nnumber of terms is infinite, then the infinitesimal exists. \n\nLeibniz's calculus gained a wide audience through the publication in\n1696, by Guillaume de L'Hôpital (1661–1704), of the first\nexpository book on the subject, the Analyse des Infiniments Petits\nPour L'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes. This is based on two\ndefinitions: \n\nAnd two postulates: \n\nFollowing Leibniz, L'Hôpital writes dx for the\ndifferential of a variable quantity x. A typical application\nof these definitions and postulates is the determination of the\ndifferential of a product xy: \n\nHere the last step is justified by Postulate I, since dx\ndy is infinitely small in comparison to y dx\n+ x dy. \n\nLeibniz's calculus of differentials, resting as it did on somewhat\ninsecure foundations, soon attracted criticism. The attack mounted by\nthe Dutch physician Bernard Nieuwentijdt[21] (1654–1718) in works of 1694-6 is\nof particular interest, since Nieuwentijdt offered his own account of\ninfinitesimals which conflicts with that of Leibniz and has striking\nfeatures of its own. Nieuwentijdt postulates a domain of quantities,\nor numbers, subject to a ordering relation of greater or less. This\ndomain includes the ordinary finite quantities, but it is also\npresumed to contain infinitesimal and infinite quantities—a\nquantity being infinitesimal, or infinite, when it is smaller, or,\nrespectively, greater, than any arbitrarily given finite quantity. The\nwhole domain is governed by a version of the Archimedean principle to\nthe effect that zero is the only quantity incapable of being\nmultiplied sufficiently many times to equal any given\nquantity. Infinitesimal quantities may be characterized as\nquotients b/m of a finite quantity b by an infinite\nquantity m. In contrast with Leibniz's differentials,\nNieuwentijdt's infinitesimals have the property that the product of\nany pair of them vanishes; in particular each infinitesimal is\n“nilsquare” in that its square and all higher powers are\nzero. This fact enables Nieuwentijdt to show that, for any curve given\nby an algebraic equation, the hypotenuse of the differential triangle\ngenerated by an infinitesimal abscissal increment e coincides\nwith the segment of the curve between x and x\n+ e. That is, a curve truly is an infinilateral\npolygon. \nThe major differences between Nieuwentijdt's and Leibniz's calculi\nof infinitesimals are summed up in the following table: \nIn responding to Nieuwentijdt's assertion that squares and higher\npowers of infinitesimals vanish, Leibniz objected that it is rather\nstrange to posit that a segment dx is different from zero and\nat the same time that the area of a square with side dx is\nequal to zero (Mancosu 1996, 161). Yet this oddity may be regarded as\na consequence — apparently unremarked by Leibniz himself — of\none of his own key principles, namely that curves may be considered as\ninfinilateral polygons. Consider, for instance, the curve y\n= x2. Given that the curve is an infinilateral\npolygon, the infinitesimal straight stretch of the curve between the\nabscissae 0 and dx must coincide with the tangent to the\ncurve at the origin — in this case, the axis of abscissae —\nbetween these two points. But then the point\n(dx, dx2) must lie on the axis of\nabscissae, which means that dx2 = 0. \nNow Leibniz could retort that that this argument depends crucially on\nthe assumption that the portion of the curve between abscissae 0\nand dx is indeed straight. If this be denied, then of course\nit does not follow that dx2 = 0. But if one\ngrants, as Leibniz does, that that there is an infinitesimal straight\nstretch of the curve (a side, that is, of an infinilateral polygon\ncoinciding with the curve) between abscissae 0 and e, say,\nwhich does not reduce to a single point then e cannot be\nequated to 0 and yet the above argument shows\nthat e2 = 0. It follows that, if curves are\ninfinilateral polygons, then the “lengths” of the sides of\nthese latter must be nilsquare infinitesimals. Accordingly, to do full\njustice to Leibniz's (as well as Nieuwentijdt's)\nconception, two sorts of infinitesimals are required: first,\n“differentials” obeying= as laid down by Leibniz — the\nsame algebraic laws as finite quantities; and second the (necessarily\nsmaller) nilsquare infinitesimals which measure the lengths of the\nsides of infinilateral polygons. It may be said that Leibniz\nrecognized the need for the first, but not the seccond type of\ninfinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice-versa. It is of interest to note\nthat Leibnizian infinitesimals (differentials) are realized in\nnonstandard analysis, and nilsquare infinitesimals in smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis (for both types of analysis see below). In fact\nit has been shown to be possible to combine the two approaches, so\ncreating an analytic framework realizing both Leibniz's and\nNieuwentijdt's conceptions of infinitesimal. \n\nThe insistence that infinitesimals obey precisely the same algebraic\nrules as finite quantities forced Leibniz and the defenders of his\ndifferential calculus into treating infinitesimals, in the presence of\nfinite quantities, as if they were zeros, so that, for\nexample, x + dx is treated as if it were the same as\nx. This was justified on the grounds that differentials are to\nbe taken as variable, not fixed quantities, decreasing continually\nuntil reaching zero. Considered only in the “moment of their\nevanescence”, they were accordingly neither something nor\nabsolute zeros. \n\nThus differentials (or infinitesimals) dx were ascribed\nvariously the four following properties: \n\nwhere “≈” stands for “indistinguishable\nfrom”, and “→ 0” stands for “becomes\nvanishingly small”. Of these properties only the last, in which a\ndifferential is considered to be a variable quantity tending to 0,\nsurvived the 19th century refounding of the calculus in\nterms of the limit\n concept[22]. \n\nThe leading practitioner of the calculus, indeed the leading\nmathematician of the 18th century, was Leonhard\n Euler[23]\n (1707–83). Philosophically Euler was\na thoroughgoing synechist. Rejecting Leibnizian monadism, he favoured\nthe Cartesian doctrine that the universe is filled with a continuous\nethereal fluid and upheld the wave theory of light over the corpuscular\ntheory propounded by Newton. \n\nEuler rejected the concept of infinitesimal in its sense as a\nquantity less than any assignable magnitude and yet unequal to 0,\narguing: that differentials must be zeros, and dy/dx\nthe quotient 0/0. Since for any number α, α · 0 = 0,\nEuler maintained that the quotient 0/0 could represent any number\n whatsoever[24].\n For Euler qua formalist the\ncalculus was essentially a procedure for determining the value of the\nexpression 0/0 in the manifold situations it arises as the ratio of\nevanescent increments. \n\nBut in the mathematical analysis of natural phenomena, Euler, along\nwith a number of his contemporaries, did employ what amount to\ninfinitesimals in the form of minute, but more or less concrete\n“elements” of continua, treating them not as atoms or\nmonads in the strict sense—as parts of a continuum they must of\nnecessity be divisible—but as being of sufficient minuteness to\npreserve their rectilinear shape under infinitesimal flow, yet\nallowing their volume to undergo infinitesimal change. This\nidea was to become fundamental in continuum mechanics. \n\nWhile Euler treated infinitesimals as formal zeros, that is, as\nfixed quantities, his contemporary Jean le Rond d'Alembert\n(1717–83) took a different view of the matter. Following Newton's\nlead, he conceived of infinitesimals or differentials in terms of the\nlimit concept, which he formulated by the assertion that one varying\nquantity is the limit of another if the second can approach the other\nmore closely than by any given quantity. D'Alembert firmly rejected the\nidea of infinitesimals as fixed quantities, and saw the idea of limit\nas supplying the methodological root of the differential calculus. For\nd'Alembert the language of infinitesimals or differentials was just a\nconvenient shorthand for avoiding the cumbrousness of expression\nrequired by the use of the limit concept. \n\nInfinitesimals, differentials, evanescent quantities and the like\ncoursed through the veins of the calculus throughout the\n18th century. Although nebulous—even logically\nsuspect—these concepts provided, faute de mieux, the\ntools for deriving the great wealth of results the calculus had made\npossible. And while, with the notable exception of Euler, many\n18th century mathematicians were ill-at-ease with the\ninfinitesimal, they would not risk killing the goose laying such a\nwealth of golden mathematical eggs. Accordingly they refrained, in the\nmain, from destructive criticism of the ideas underlying the calculus.\nPhilosophers, however, were not fettered by such constraints. \n\nThe philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), noted both for his\nsubjective idealist doctrine of esse est percipi and his\ndenial of general ideas, was a persistent critic of the presuppositions\nunderlying the mathematical practice of his day (see Jesseph [1993]).\nHis most celebrated broadsides were directed at the calculus, but in\nfact his conflict with the mathematicians went deeper. For his denial\nof the existence of abstract ideas of any kind went in direct\nopposition with the abstractionist account of mathematical concepts\nheld by the majority of mathematicians and philosophers of the day. The\ncentral tenet of this doctrine, which goes back to Aristotle, is that\nthe mind creates mathematical concepts by abstraction, that\nis, by the mental suppression of extraneous features of perceived\nobjects so as to focus on properties singled out for attention.\nBerkeley rejected this, asserting that mathematics as a science is\nultimately concerned with objects of sense, its admitted generality\nstemming from the capacity of percepts to serve as signs for all\npercepts of a similar form. \n\nAt first Berkeley poured scorn on those who adhere to the concept of\ninfinitesimal. maintaining that the use of infinitesimals in deriving\nmathematical results is illusory, and is in fact eliminable. But later\nhe came to adopt a more tolerant attitude towards infinitesimals,\nregarding them as useful fictions in somewhat the same way as did\nLeibniz. \n\nIn The Analyst of 1734 Berkeley launched his most sustained\nand sophisticated critique of infinitesimals and the whole metaphysics\nof the calculus. Addressed To an Infidel\n Mathematician[25],\n the\ntract was written with the avowed purpose of defending theology against\nthe scepticism shared by many of the mathematicians and scientists of\nthe day. Berkeley's defense of religion amounts to the claim that the\nreasoning of mathematicians in respect of the calculus is no less\nflawed than that of theologians in respect of the mysteries of the\ndivine. \n\nBerkeley's arguments are directed chiefly against the Newtonian\nfluxional calculus. Typical of his objections is that in attempting to\navoid infinitesimals by the employment of such devices as evanescent\nquantities and prime and ultimate ratios Newton has in fact violated\nthe law of noncontradiction by first subjecting a quantity to an\nincrement and then setting the increment to 0, that is, denying that an\nincrement had ever been present. As for fluxions and evanescent\nincrements themselves, Berkeley has this to say: \n\nNor did the Leibnizian method of differentials escape Berkeley's\nstrictures. \n\nThe opposition between continuity and discreteness plays a\nsignificant role in the philosophical thought of Immanuel Kant\n(1724–1804). His mature philosophy, transcendental\nidealism, rests on the division of reality into two realms. The\nfirst, the phenomenal realm, consists of appearances or\nobjects of possible experience, configured by the forms of sensibility\nand the epistemic categories. The second, the noumenal realm,\nconsists of “entities of the understanding to which no objects of\nexperience can ever correspond”, that is,\nthings-in-themselves. \n\nRegarded as magnitudes, appearances are spatiotemporally extended\nand continuous, that is infinitely, or at least limitlessly, divisible.\nSpace and time constitute the underlying order of phenomena, so are\nultimately phenomenal themselves, and hence also continuous. \n\nAs objects of knowledge, appearances are continuous\nextensive magnitudes, but as objects of sensation or\nperception they are, according to Kant, intensive magnitudes.\nBy an intensive magnitude Kant means a magnitude possessing a\ndegree and so capable of being apprehended by the senses: for\nexample brightness or temperature. Intensive magnitudes are entirely\nfree of the intuitions of space or time, and “can only be\npresented as unities”. But, like extensive magnitudes, they are\ncontinuous. Moreover, appearances are always presented to the senses as\nintensive magnitudes. \n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) Kant brings a new\nsubtlety (and, it must be said, tortuousity) to the analysis of the\nopposition between continuity and discreteness. This may be seen in the\nsecond of the celebrated Antinomies in that work, which concerns the\nquestion of the mereological composition of matter, or extended\nsubstance. Is it (a) discrete, that is, consists of simple or\nindivisible parts, or (b) continuous, that is, contains parts\nwithin parts ad infinitum? Although (a), which Kant\ncalls the Thesis and (b) the Antithesis\nwould seem to contradict one another, Kant offers proofs of both\nassertions. The resulting contradiction may be resolved, he asserts, by\nobserving that while the antinomy “relates to the division of\nappearances”, the arguments for (a) and (b)\nimplicitly treat matter or substance as things-in-themselves. Kant\nconcludes that both Thesis and Antithesis “presuppose an\ninadmissible condition” and accordingly “both fall to the\nground, inasmuch as the condition, under which alone either of them can\nbe maintained, itself falls.” \n\nKant identifies the inadmissible condition as the implicit taking of\nmatter as a thing-in-itself, which in turn leads to the mistake of\ntaking the division of matter into parts to subsist independently of\nthe act of dividing. In that case, the Thesis implies that the sequence\nof divisions is finite; the Antithesis, that it is infinite. These\ncannot both be true of the completed (or at least\ncompletable) sequence of divisions which would result from taking\nmatter or substance as a\n thing-in-itself.[26]\n Now since the truth\nof both assertions has been shown to follow from that assumption,\nit must be false, that is, matter and extended substance are\nappearances only. And for appearances, Kant maintains, divisions into\nparts are not completable in experience, with the result that such\ndivisions can be considered, in a startling phrase, “neither\nfinite nor infinite”. It follows that, for appearances, both\nThesis and Antithesis are false. \n\nLater in the Critique Kant enlarges on the issue of\ndivisibility, asserting that, while each part generated by a sequence\nof divisions of an intuited whole is given with the whole, the\nsequence's incompletability prevents it from forming a whole;\na fortiori no such sequence can be claimed to be actually\ninfinite. \n\nThe rapid development of mathematical analysis in the\n18th century had not concealed the fact that its underlying\nconcepts not only lacked rigorous definition, but were even (e.g., in\nthe case of differentials and infinitesimals) of doubtful logical\ncharacter. The lack of precision in the notion of continuous\nfunction—still vaguely understood as one which could be\nrepresented by a formula and whose associated curve could be smoothly\ndrawn—had led to doubts concerning the validity of a number of\nprocedures in which that concept figured. For example it was often\nassumed that every continuous function could be expressed as an\ninfinite series by means of Taylor's theorem. Early in the\n19th century this and other assumptions began to be\nquestioned, thereby initiating an inquiry into what was meant by a\nfunction in general and by a continuous function in particular. \n\nA pioneer in the matter of clarifying the concept of continuous\nfunction was the Bohemian priest, philosopher and mathematician Bernard\nBolzano (1781–1848). In his Rein analytischer Beweis of 1817\nhe defines a (real-valued) function f to be continuous at a\npoint x if the difference f(x + ω)\n− f(x) can be made smaller than any preselected\nquantity once we are permitted to take w as small as we\nplease. This is essentially the same as the definition of continuity in\nterms of the limit concept given a little later by Cauchy. Bolzano also\nformulated a definition of the derivative of a function free of the\nnotion of infinitesimal (see Bolzano [1950]). Bolzano repudiated\nEuler's treatment of differentials as formal zeros in expressions such\nas dy/dx, suggesting instead that in determining the\nderivative of a function, increments Δx,\nΔy, …, be finally set to zero. For\nBolzano differentials have the status of “ideal elements”,\npurely formal entities such as points and lines at infinity in\nprojective geometry, or (as Bolzano himself mentions) imaginary\nnumbers, whose use will never lead to false assertions concerning\n“real” quantities. \n\nAlthough Bolzano anticipated the form that the rigorous formulation\nof the concepts of the calculus would assume, his work was largely\nignored in his lifetime. The cornerstone for the rigorous development\nof the calculus was supplied by the ideas—essentially similar to\nBolzano's—of the great French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy\n(1789–1857). In Cauchy's work, as in Bolzano's, a central role is\nplayed by a purely arithmetical concept of limit freed of all geometric\nand temporal intuition. Cauchy also formulates the condition for a\nsequence of real numbers to converge to a limit, and states his\nfamiliar criterion for\n convergence[27]\n , namely, that a\nsequence <sn> is convergent if and\nonly if sn+r −\nsn can be made less in absolute value than any\npreassigned quantity for all r and sufficiently large\nn. Cauchy proves that this is necessary for convergence, but\nas to sufficiency of the condition merely remarks “when the\nvarious conditions are fulfilled, the convergence of the series is\nassured.” In making this latter assertion he is implicitly\nappealing to geometric intuition, since he makes no attempt to define\nreal numbers, observing only that irrational numbers are to be regarded\nas the limits of sequences of rational numbers. \n\nCauchy chose to characterize the continuity of functions in terms of\na rigorized notion of infinitesimal, which he defines in the Cours\nd'analyse as “a variable quantity [whose value] decreases\nindefinitely in such a way as to converge to the limit 0.” Here\nis his definition of continuity. Cauchy's definition of continuity of\nf(x) in the neighbourhood of a value a\namounts to the condition, in modern notation, that\nlimx→af(x) =\nf(a). Cauchy defines the derivative f\n′(x) of a function f(x) in a manner\nessentially identical to that of Bolzano. \n\nThe work of Cauchy (as well as that of Bolzano) represents a crucial\nstage in the renunciation by mathematicians—adumbrated in the\nwork of d'Alembert—of (fixed) infinitesimals and the intuitive\nideas of continuity and motion. Certain mathematicians of the day, such\nas Poisson and Cournot, who regarded the limit concept as no more than\na circuitous substitute for the use of infinitesimally small\nmagnitudes—which in any case (they claimed) had a real\nexistence—felt that Cauchy's reforms had been carried too far.\nBut traces of the traditional ideas did in fact remain in Cauchy's\nformulations, as evidenced by his use of such expressions as\n“variable quantities”, “infinitesimal\nquantities”, “approach indefinitely”, “as\nlittle as one wishes” and the\n like[28]. \n\nMeanwhile the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815–97)\nwas completing the banishment of spatiotemporal intuition, and the\ninfinitesimal, from the foundations of analysis. To instill complete\nlogical rigour Weierstrass proposed to establish mathematical analysis\non the basis of number alone, to\n “arithmetize”[29]\nit—in effect, to replace the continuous by the discrete.\n“Arithmetization” may be seen as a form of mathematical\natomism. In pursuit of this goal Weierstrass had first to formulate a\nrigorous “arithmetical” definition of real number. He did\nthis by defining a (positive) real number to be a countable set of\npositive rational numbers for which the sum of any finite subset always\nremains below some preassigned bound, and then specifying the\nconditions under which two such “real numbers” are to be\nconsidered equal, or strictly less than one another. \n\nWeierstrass was concerned to purge the foundations of analysis of\nall traces of the intuition of continuous motion—in a word, to\nreplace the variable by the static. For Weierstrass a variable\nx was simply a symbol designating an arbitrary member of a\ngiven set of numbers, and a continuous variable one whose corresponding\nset S has the property that any interval around any member\nx of S contains members of S other than\nx. Weierstrass also formulated the familiar (ε,\nδ) definition of continuous\n function[30]\n : a function\nf(x) is continuous at a if for any ε\n> 0 there is a δ > 0 such that |f(x)\n− f(a)| < ε for all x such\nthat |x − a| <\n δ.[31] \n\nFollowing Weierstrass's efforts, another attack on the problem of\nformulating rigorous definitions of continuity and the real numbers was\nmounted by Richard Dedekind (1831–1916). Dedekind focussed\nattention on the question: exactly what is it that distinguishes a\ncontinuous domain from a discontinuous one? He seems to have been the\nfirst to recognize that the property of density, possessed by the\nordered set of rational numbers, is insufficient to guarantee\ncontinuity. In Continuity and Irrational Numbers (1872) he\nremarks that when the rational numbers are associated to points on a\nstraight line, “there are infinitely many points [on the line] to\nwhich no rational number corresponds” so that the rational\nnumbers manifest “a gappiness, incompleteness,\ndiscontinuity”, in contrast with the straight line's\n“absence of gaps, completeness, continuity.” Dedekind\nregards this principle as being essentially indemonstrable; he ascribes\nto it, rather, the status of an axiom “by which we attribute to\nthe line its continuity, by which we think continuity into the\nline.” It is not, Dedekind stresses, necessary for space\nto be continuous in this sense, for “many of its properties would\nremain the same even if it were discontinuous.” \n\nThe filling-up of gaps in the rational numbers through the\n“creation of new point-individuals” is the key idea\nunderlying Dedekind's construction of the domain of real numbers. He\nfirst defines a cut to be a partition\n(A1, A2) of the rational\nnumbers such that every member of A1 is less than\nevery member of A2. After noting that each rational\nnumber corresponds, in an evident way, to a cut, he observes that\ninfinitely many cuts fail to be engendered by rational numbers. The\ndiscontinuity or incompleteness of the domain of rational numbers\nconsists precisely in this latter fact. \n\nIt is to be noted that Dedekind does not identify irrational numbers\nwith cuts; rather, each irrational number is newly\n“created” by a mental act, and remains quite distinct from\nits associated cut. Dedekind goes on to show how the domain of cuts,\nand thereby the associated domain of real numbers, can be ordered in\nsuch a way as to possess the property of continuity, viz.\n“if the system ℜ\n  of all real numbers divides into two classes\n 1,\n 2 such\nthat every number a1 of the class\n 1 is\nless than every number a2 of the class\n 2, then\nthere exists one and only one number by which this separation is\nproduced.” \n\nThe most visionary “arithmetizer” of all was Georg\n Cantor[32]\n (1845–1918). Cantor's analysis of\nthe continuum in terms of infinite point sets led to his theory of\ntransfinite numbers and to the eventual freeing of the concept of set\nfrom its geometric origins as a collection of points, so paving the way\nfor the emergence of the concept of general abstract set central to\ntoday's mathematics. Like Weierstrass and Dedekind, Cantor aimed to\nformulate an adequate definition of the real numbers which avoided the\npresupposition of their prior existence, and he follows them in basing\nhis definition on the rational numbers. Following Cauchy, he calls a\nsequence a1, a2,…,\nan,… of rational numbers a fundamental\nsequence if there exists an integer N such that, for any\npositive rational ε, there exists an integer N such\nthat |an+m − an| <\nε for all m and all n > N. Any\nsequence <an> satisfying this condition is\nsaid to have a definite limit b. Dedekind had taken irrational\nnumbers to be “mental objects” associated with cuts, so,\nanalogously, Cantor regards these definite limits, as nothing more than\nformal symbols associated with fundamental sequences. The\ndomain B of such symbols may be considered an enlargement of\nthe domain A of rational numbers. After imposing an\narithmetical structure on the domain B, Cantor is emboldened\nto refer to its elements as (real) numbers. Nevertheless, he\nstill insists that these “numbers” have no existence except\nas representatives of fundamental sequences. Cantor then shows that\neach point on the line corresponds to a definite element of B.\nConversely, each element of B should determine a definite\npoint on the line. Realizing that the intuitive nature of the linear\ncontinuum precludes a rigorous proof of this property, Cantor simply\nassumes it as an axiom, just as Dedekind had done in regard to his\nprinciple of continuity. \n\nFor Cantor, who began as a number-theorist, and throughout his\ncareer cleaved to the discrete, it was numbers, rather than geometric\npoints, that possessed objective significance. Indeed the isomorphism\nbetween the discrete numerical domain B and the linear\ncontinuum was regarded by Cantor essentially as a device for\nfacilitating the manipulation of numbers. \n\nCantor's arithmetization of the continuum had the following\nimportant consequence. It had long been recognized that the sets of\npoints of any pair of line segments, even if one of them is infinite in\nlength, can be placed in one-one correspondence. This fact was taken to\nshow that such sets of points have no well-defined “size”.\nBut Cantor's identification of the set of points on a linear continuum\nwith a domain of numbers enabled the sizes of point sets to be\ncompared in a definite way, using the well-grounded idea of one-one\ncorrespondence between sets of numbers. \n\nCantor's investigations into the properties of subsets of the linear\ncontinuum are presented in six masterly papers published during\n1879–84, Über unendliche lineare\nPunktmannigfaltigkeiten (“On infinite, linear point\nmanifolds”). Remarkable in their richness of ideas, these papers\nprovide the first accounts of Cantor's revolutionary theory of infinite\nsets and its application to the classification of subsets of the linear\ncontinuum. In the fifth of these papers, the Grundlagen of\n 1883,[33]\n are to be found some of Cantor's most\nsearching observations on the nature of the continuum. \n\nCantor begins his examination of the continuum with a tart summary\nof the controversies that have traditionally surrounded the notion,\nremarking that the continuum has until recently been regarded as an\nessentially unanalyzable concept. It is Cantor's concern to\n“develop the concept of the continuum as soberly and briefly as\npossible, and only with regard to the mathematical theory of\nsets”. This opens the way, he believes, to the formulation of an\nexact concept of the continuum. Cantor points out that the idea of the\ncontinuum has heretofore merely been presupposed by mathematicians\nconcerned with the analysis of continuous functions and the like, and\nhas “not been subjected to any more thorough\ninspection.” \n\nRepudiating any use of spatial or temporal intuition in an exact\ndetermination of the continuum, Cantor undertakes its precise\narithmetical definition. Making reference to the definition of real\nnumber he has already provided (i.e., in terms of fundamental\nsequences), he introduces the n-dimensional arithmetical space\nGn as the set of all n-tuples of real\nnumbers\n<x1,x2,…,xn>,\ncalling each such an arithmetical point of\nGn. The distance between two such points is given\nby \n\nCantor defines an arithmetical point-set in\nGn to be any “aggregate of points of the\npoints of the space Gn that is given in a lawlike\nway”. \n\nAfter remarking that he has previously shown that all spaces\nGn have the same power as the set of real numbers\nin the interval (0,1), and reiterating his conviction that any infinite\npoint sets has either the power of the set of natural numbers or that\nof\n (0,1),[34]\n Cantor turns to the definition of the\ngeneral concept of a continuum within\nGn.. For this he employs the concept of\nderivative or derived set of a point set introduced\nin a paper of 1872 on trigonometric series. Cantor had defined the\nderived set of a point set P to be the set of limit\npoints of P, where a limit point of P is a point\nof P with infinitely many points of P arbitrarily\nclose to it. A point set is called perfect if it coincides\nwith its derived\n set[35].\n Cantor observes that this condition does\nnot suffice to characterize a continuum, since perfect sets can be\nconstructed in the linear continuum which are dense in no interval,\nhowever small: as an example of such a set he offers the\n set[36]\nconsisting of all real numbers in (0,1) whose ternary expansion does\nnot contain a “1”. \n\nAccordingly an additional condition is needed to define a continuum.\nCantor supplies this by introducing the concept of a\nconnected set. A point set T is connected in\nCantor's sense if for any pair of its points t,\nt′ and any arbitrarily small number ε there is\na finite sequence of points t1,\nt2,…, tn of T\nfor which the distances [tt1],\n[t1t2],\n[t2t3], …,\n[tnt′], are all less than\nε. Cantor now defines a continuum to be a perfect connected\npoint set. \n\nCantor has advanced beyond his predecessors in formulating what is\nin essence a topological definition of continuum, one that,\nwhile still dependent on metric notions, does not involve an order\n relation[37].\n It is interesting to compare Cantor's\ndefinition with the definition of continuum in modern general topology.\nIn a well-known textbook (see Hocking and Young [1961]) on the subject\nwe find a continuum defined as a compact connected subset of a\ntopological space. Now within any bounded region of Euclidean\nspace it can be shown that Cantor's continua coincide with continua in\nthe sense of the modern definition. While Cantor lacked the definition\nof compactness, his requirement that continua be “complete”\n(which led to his rejecting as continua such noncompact sets as open\nintervals or discs) is not far away from the idea. \n\nThroughout Cantor's mathematical career he maintained an unwavering,\neven dogmatic opposition to infinitesimals, attacking the efforts of\nmathematicians such as du Bois-Reymond and\n Veronese[38]\n to\nformulate rigorous theories of actual infinitesimals. As far as Cantor\nwas concerned, the infinitesimal was beyond the realm of the possible;\ninfiinitesimals were no more than “castles in the air, or rather\njust nonsense”, to be classed “with circular squares and\nsquare circles”. His abhorrence of infinitesimals went so deep as\nto move him to outright vilification, branding them as\n“Cholera-bacilli of mathematics.” Cantor's rejection of\ninfinitesimals stemmed from his conviction that his own theory of\ntransfinite ordinal and cardinal numbers exhausted the realm of the\nnumerable, so that no further generalization of the concept of number,\nin particular any which embraced infinitesimals, was admissible. \n\nDespite the great success of Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor in\nconstructing the continuum from arithmetical materials, a number of\nthinkers of the late 19th and early 20th\ncenturies remained opposed, in varying degrees, to the idea of\nexplicating the continuum concept entirely in discrete terms. These\ninclude the philosophers Brentano and Peirce and the mathematicians\nPoincaré, Brouwer and Weyl. \n\nIn his later years the Austrian philosopher Franz Brentano\n(1838–1917) became preoccupied with the nature of the continuous\n(see Brentano [1988]). In its fundamentals Brentano's account of the\ncontinuous is akin to Aristotle's. Brentano regards continuity as\nsomething given in perception, primordial in nature, rather than a\nmathematical construction. He held that the idea of the continuous is\nabstracted from sensible intuition. Brentano suggests that the\ncontinuous is brought to appearance by sensible intuition in three\nphases. First, sensation presents us with objects having parts that\ncoincide. From such objects the concept of boundary is\nabstracted in turn, and then one grasps that these objects actually\ncontain coincident boundaries. Finally one sees that this is\nall that is required in order to have grasped the concept of a\ncontinuum. \n\nFor Brentano the essential feature of a continuum is its inherent\ncapacity to engender boundaries, and the fact that such boundaries can\nbe grasped as coincident. Boundaries themselves possess a quality which\nBrentano calls plerosis (“fullness”). Plerosis is\nthe measure of the number of directions in which the given boundary\nactually bounds. Thus, for example, within a temporal continuum the\nendpoint of a past episode or the starting point of a future one bounds\nin a single direction, while the point marking the end of one episode\nand the beginning of another may be said to bound doubly. In the case\nof a spatial continuum there are numerous additional possibilities:\nhere a boundary may bound in all the directions of which it is capable\nof bounding, or it may bound in only some of these directions. In the\nformer case, the boundary is said to exist in full plerosis;\nin the latter, in partial plerosis. Brentano believed that the\nconcept of plerosis enabled sense to be made of the idea that a\nboundary possesses “parts”, even when the boundary lacks\ndimensions altogether, as in the case of a point. Thus, while the\npresent or “now” is, according to Brentano, temporally\nunextended and exists only as a boundary between past and future, it\nstill possesses two “parts” or aspects: it is both the end\nof the past and the beginning of the future. It is worth mentioning\nthat for Brentano it was not just the “now” that existed\nonly as a boundary; since, like Aristotle he held that\n“existence” in the strict sense means “existence\nnow”, it necessarily followed that existing things exist\nonly as boundaries of what has existed or of what will exist, or\nboth. \n\nBrentano took a somewhat dim view of the efforts of mathematicians\nto construct the continuum from numbers. His attitude varied from\nrejecting such attempts as inadequate to according them the status of\n “fictions”[39].\n This is not surprising given his\nAristotelian inclination to take mathematical and physical theories to\nbe genuine descriptions of empirical phenomena rather than\nidealizations: in his view, if such theories were to be taken as\nliteral descriptions of experience, they would amount to nothing better\nthan “misrepresentations”. \n\nBrentano's analysis of the continuum centred on its phenomenological\nand qualitative aspects, which are by their very nature incapable of\nreduction to the discrete. Brentano's rejection of the mathematicians'\nattempts to construct it in discrete terms is thus hardly\nsurprising. \n\nThe American philosopher-mathematician Charles Sanders Peirce's\n(1839–1914) view of the\n continuum[40]\n was, in a sense,\nintermediate between that of Brentano and the arithmetizers. Like\nBrentano, he held that the cohesiveness of a continuum rules out the\npossibility of it being a mere collection of discrete individuals, or\npoints, in the usual sense. And even before Brouwer, Peirce seems to\nhave been aware that a faithful account of the continuum will involve\nquestioning the law of excluded middle. Peirce also held that any\ncontinuum harbours an unboundedly large collection of\npoints—in his colourful terminology, a\nsupermultitudinous collection—what we would today call a\nproper class. Peirce maintained that if “enough”\npoints were to be crowded together by carrying insertion of new points\nbetween old to its ultimate limit they would—through a\nlogical “transformation of quantity into\nquality”—lose their individual identity and become fused\ninto a true continuum. \n\nPeirce's conception of the number continuum is also notable for the\npresence in it of an abundance of infinitesimals, Peirce\nchampioned the retention of the infinitesimal concept in the\nfoundations of the calculus, both because of what he saw as the\nefficiency of infinitesimal methods, and because he regarded\ninfinitesimals as constituting the “glue” causing points on\na continuous line to lose their individual identity. \n\nThe idea of continuity played a central role in the thought of the\ngreat French mathematician Henri\n Poincaré[41]\n (1854–1912).\nWhile accepting the arithmetic definition of the continuum, he\nquestions the fact that (as with Dedekind and Cantor's formulations)\nthe (irrational) numbers so produced are mere symbols, detached from\ntheir origins in intuition. Unlike Cantor, Poincaré accepted the\ninfinitesimal, even if he did not regard all of the concept's\nmanifestations as useful. \n\nThe Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881–1966) is best\nknown as the founder of the philosophy of (neo)intuitionism\n(see Brouwer [1975]; van Dalen [1998]). Brouwer's highly idealist views\non mathematics bore some resemblance to Kant's. For Brouwer,\nmathematical concepts are admissible only if they are adequately\ngrounded in intuition, mathematical theories are significant only if\nthey concern entities which are constructed out of something given\nimmediately in intuition, and mathematical demonstration is a form of\nconstruction in intuition. While admitting that the emergence of\nnoneuclidean geometry had discredited Kant's view of space, Brouwer\nheld, in opposition to the logicists (whom he called\n“formalists”) that arithmetic, and so all mathematics, must\nderive from temporal intuition. \n\nInitially Brouwer held without qualification that the continuum is\nnot constructible from discrete points, but was later to modify this\ndoctrine. In his mature thought, he radically transformed the concept\nof point, endowing points with sufficient fluidity to enable them to\nserve as generators of a “true” continuum. This fluidity\nwas achieved by admitting as “points”, not only fully\ndefined discrete numbers such as √2, π, e, and the\nlike—which have, so to speak, already achieved\n“being”—but also “numbers” which are in a\nperpetual state of becoming in that there the entries in their decimal\n(or dyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice by a\nsubject operating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The\nresulting choice sequences cannot be conceived as finished,\ncompleted objects: at any moment only an initial segment is known. In\nthis way Brouwer obtained the mathematical continuum in a way\ncompatible with his belief in the primordial intuition of\ntime—that is, as an unfinished, indeed unfinishable entity in a\nperpetual state of growth, a “medium of free development”.\nIn this conception, the mathematical continuum is indeed\n“constructed”, not, however, by initially shattering, as\ndid Cantor and Dedekind, an intuitive continuum into isolated points,\nbut rather by assembling it from a complex of continually changing\noverlapping parts. \n\nThe mathematical continuum as conceived by Brouwer displays a number\nof features that seem bizarre to the classical eye. For example, in the\nBrouwerian continuum the usual law of comparability, namely that for\nany real numbers a, b either a <\nb or a = b or a > b,\nfails. Even more fundamental is the failure of the law of excluded\nmiddle in the form that for any real numbers a, b,\neither a = b or a ≠ b. The\nfailure of these seemingly unquestionable principles in turn vitiates\nthe proofs of a number of basic results of classical analysis, for\nexample the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, as well as the theorems of\nmonotone convergence, intermediate value, least upper bound, and\nmaximum value for continuous\n functions[42]. \n\nWhile the Brouwerian continuum may possess a number of negative\nfeatures from the standpoint of the classical mathematician, it has the\nmerit of corresponding more closely to the continuum of intuition than\ndoes its classical counterpart. Far from being bizarre, the failure of\nthe law of excluded middle for points in the intuitionistic continuum\nmay be seen as fitting in well with the character of the intuitive\ncontinuum. \n\nIn 1924 Brouwer showed that every function defined on a closed\ninterval of his continuum is uniformly continuous. As a consequence the\nintuitionistic continuum is indecomposable, that is, cannot be\nsplit into two disjoint parts in any way whatsoever. In contrast with a\ndiscrete entity, the indecomposable Brouwerian continuum cannot be\ncomposed of its parts. Brouwer's vision of the continuum has in recent\nyears become the subject of intensive mathematical investigation. \n\nHermann Weyl (1885–1955), one of most versatile mathematicians\nof the 20th century, was preoccupied with the nature of the\ncontinuum (see Bell [2000]). In his Das Kontinuum of 1918 he\nattempts to provide the continuum with an exact mathematical\nformulation free of the set-theoretic assumptions he had come to regard\nas objectionable. As he saw it, there is an unbridgeable gap between\nintuitively given continua (e.g., those of space, time and motion) on\nthe one hand, and the discrete exact concepts of mathematics (e.g.,\nthat of real number) on the other. For Weyl the presence of this split\nmeant that the construction of the mathematical continuum could not\nsimply be “read off” from intuition. Rather, he believed\nthat the mathematical continuum must be treated and, in the end,\njustified in the same way as a physical theory. However much he may\nhave wished it, in Das Kontinuum Weyl did not aim to provide a\nmathematical formulation of the continuum as it is presented to\nintuition, which, as the quotations above show, he regarded as an\nimpossibility (at that time at least). Rather, his goal was first to\nachieve consistency by putting the arithmetical\nnotion of real number on a firm logical basis, and then to show that\nthe resulting theory is reasonable by employing it as the\nfoundation for a plausible account of continuous process in the\nobjective physical world. \n\nLater Weyl came to repudiate atomistic theories of the continuum,\nincluding that of his own Das Kontinuum. He accordingly welcomed\nBrouwer's construction of the continuum by means of sequences generated\nby free acts of choice, thus identifying it as a “medium of free\nBecoming” which “does not dissolve into a set of real\nnumbers as finished entities”. Weyl felt that Brouwer, through\nhis doctrine of intuitionism, had come closer than anyone else to\nbridging that “unbridgeable chasm” between the intuitive\nand mathematical continua. In particular, he found compelling the fact\nthat the Brouwerian continuum is not the union of two disjoint nonempty\nparts—that it is indecomposable. “A genuine\ncontinuum,” Weyl says, “cannot be divided into separate\nfragments.” In later publications he expresses this more\ncolourfully by quoting Anaxagoras to the effect that a continuum\n“defies the chopping off of its parts with a hatchet.” \n\nOnce the continuum had been provided with a set-theoretic\nfoundation, the use of the infinitesimal in mathematical analysis was\nlargely abandoned. And so the situation remained for a number of years.\nThe first signs of a revival of the infinitesimal approach to analysis\nsurfaced in 1958 with a paper by A. H. Laugwitz and C.\n Schmieden[43].\n But the major breakthrough came in 1960\nwhen it occurred to the mathematical logician Abraham Robinson\n(1918–1974) that “the concepts and methods of contemporary\nMathematical Logic are capable of providing a suitable framework for\nthe development of the Differential and Integral Calculus by means of\ninfinitely small and infinitely large numbers.” (see Robinson\n[1996], p. xiii) This insight led to the creation of\nnonstandard\n analysis,[44]\n which Robinson regarded as realizing\nLeibniz's conception of infinitesimals and infinities as ideal numbers\npossessing the same properties as ordinary real numbers. \n\nAfter Robinson's initial insight, a number of ways of presenting\nnonstandard analysis were developed. Here is a sketch of one of\nthem. \n\nStarting with the classical real line\n ℜ,\n a set-theoretic\nuniverse—the standard universe—is first\nconstructed over it: here by such a universe is meant a set U\ncontaining\n ℜ\nwhich\n is closed under the usual set-theoretic operations of union,\npower set, Cartesian products and subsets. Now write\n \n for the structure\n(U, ∈), where ∈ is the usual membership relation on\nU: associated with this is the extension\n L(U) of\nthe first-order language of set theory to include a name\nu for each element u of U.\nNow, using the well-known compactness theorem for first-order\n logic,\n  is extended\nto a new structure\n *\n = (*U, *∈), called a nonstandard\nuniverse, satisfying the following key principle: \n\nThe saturation property expresses the intuitive idea that the\nnonstandard universe is very rich in comparison to the standard one.\nIndeed, while there may exist, for each finite subcollection\n F\n of a given collection of properties\n P,\n an element of U satisfying the members\n of\n F in\n ,\n there may not necessarily be an element of U satisfying\nall the members of\n P.\nThe saturation of\n *\n guarantees the existence of an element of\n*U which satisfies, in\n *,\n all the members of \n P.\n For example, suppose the set\n ℕ\n of natural numbers is a member of U; for each n\n ∈\n ℕ\n let Pn(x) be the property x\n∈\n ℕ\n & n < x. Then clearly, while each finite\nsubcollection of the collection\n P\n = {Pn: n ∈\n ℕ}\n is satisfiable\n in \n , the whole\ncollection is not. An element of *U satisfying\n P\n in\n * will then be an\n“natural number” greater than every member of\n ℕ,\n that is, an\ninfinite number. \n\nFrom the saturation property it follows that\n * satisfies the\nimportant \n\nThe transfer principle may be seen as a version of Leibniz's\ncontinuity principle: it asserts that all first-order properties are\npreserved in the passage to or “transfer” from the standard\nto the nonstandard universe. \n\nThe members of U are called standard sets, or\nstandard objects; those in *U − U\nnonstandard sets or nonstandard objects: *U\nthus consists of both standard and nonstandard objects. The members of\n*U will also be referred to as *-sets or\n*-objects Since U ⊆ *U, under this\nconvention every set (object) is also a *-set (object) The\n*-members of a *-set A are the *-objects x\nfor which x *∈ A. \n\nIf A is a standard set, we may consider the collection\n Â—the\ninflate of A—consisting of all the *-members of\nA: this is not necessarily a set nor even a *-set. The\n inflate\n Â of a standard\nset A may be regarded as the same set A viewed from a\nnonstandard vantage point. While clearly A ⊆\n Â,\n\n Â may contain\n“nonstandard” elements not in A. It can in fact be\nshown that infinite standard sets always get\n“inflated” in this way. Using the transfer principle, any\nfunction f between standard sets automatically extends to a\nfunction—also written f—between their\ninflates. \n\nIf\n \n =\n(A, R,…) is a mathematical structure, we may\nconsider the structure\n \n =\n (Â,Rˆ).\n From the transfer principle it follows that\n \n and\n \n have precisely\nthe same first-order properties. \n\nNow suppose that the set\n ℕ\n of natural numbers is a member of U. Then so\nis the set\n ℜ\n of\nreal numbers, since each real number may be identified with a set of\nnatural numbers.\n ℜ\n may be regarded as an ordered field, and the same is\ntherefore true of its inflate\n ℜˆ,\n since the latter has precisely the same\nfirst-order properties as\n ℜ.\n ℜˆ\n is called the hyperreal line, and its\nmembers hyperreals. A standard hyperreal is then just a real,\nto which we shall refer for emphasis as a standard real.\n Since\n ℜ is infinite,\nnonstandard hyperreals must exist. The saturation principle implies\nthat there must be an infinite (nonstandard)\n hyperreal,[45]\n that is, a hyperreal a such that\na > n for every n ∈\n ℕ.\n In that case its\nreciprocal 1/a is infinitesimal in the sense of\nexceeding 0 and yet being smaller than 1/n+1 for\nevery n ∈\n ℕ.\n In general, we call a hyperreal a\ninfinitesimal if its absolute value |a| is less than\n1/n+1 for every n ∈\n ℕ.\n In that case the\nset I of infinitesimals contains not just 0 but a substantial\nnumber (in fact, infinitely many) other elements. Clearly I is\nan additive subgroup of\n ℜ,\n that is, if a, b ∈\nI, then a − b ∈ I. \n\nThe members of the inflate\n ℕˆ\n of\n ℕ\n are called hypernatural numbers. As for the\nhyperreals, it can be shown that\n ℕˆ\n also contains nonstandard elements which must\nexceed every member of\n ℕ;\n these are called infinite hypernatural\nnumbers. \n\nFor hyperreals a, b we define a ≈\nb and say that a and b are\ninfinitesimally close if a − b ∈\nI. This is an equivalence relation on the hyperreal line: for\neach hyperreal a we write μ(a) for the equivalence\nclass of a under this relation and call it the monad\nof a. The monad of a hyperreal a thus consists of all\nthe hyperreals that are infinitesimally close to a: it may be\nthought of as a small cloud centred at a. Note also that\nμ(0) = I. \n\nA hyperreal a is finite if it is not infinite;\nthis means that |a| < n for some n\n ∈\n ℕ . It is not\ndifficult to show that finiteness is equivalent to the condition of\nnear-standardness; here a hyperreal a is\nnear-standard if a ≈ r for some\nstandard real r. \n\nMuch of the usefulness of nonstandard analysis stems from the fact\nthat statements of classical analysis involving limits or the\n(ε, δ) criterion admit succinct, intuitive translations\ninto statements involving infinitesimals or infinite numbers, in turn\nenabling comparatively straightforward proofs to be given of classical\ntheorems. Here are some examples of such\n translations:[46] \n\nNow suppose that f is a real-valued function defined on\nsome open interval (a, b). We have remarked above\nthat f automatically extends to a function—also written\nf—on\n  \n\nMany other branches of mathematics admit neat and fruitful\nnonstandard formulations. \n\nThe original motivation for the development of constructive\nmathematics was to put the idea of mathematical existence on a\nconstructive or computable basis. While there are a number of varieties\nof constructive mathematics (see Bridges and Richman [1987]), here we\nshall focus on Bishop's constructive analysis (see Bishop and Bridges\n[1985]; Bridges [1994], [1999]; and Bridges and Richman [1987]) and\nBrouwer's intuitionistic analysis (see Dummett [1977]). \n\nIn constructive mathematics a problem is counted as solved only if\nan explicit solution can, in principle at least, be produced. Thus, for\nexample, “There is an x such that\nP(x)” means that, in principle at least, we\ncan explicitly produce an x such that P(x).\nThis fact led to the questioning of certain principles of classical\nlogic, in particular, the law of excluded middle, and the creation of\na new logic, intuitionistic logic (see entry on\n intuitionistic logic).\n It also led to the introduction of a sharpened definition of real\nnumbers—the constructive real numbers. A constructive real\nnumber is a sequence of rationals (rn) =\nr1, r2, … such that, for\nany k, a number n can be computed in such a way that\n|rn+p −\nrn| ≤ 1/k. Each rational\nnumber a may be regarded as a real number by identifying it with the\nreal number (α, α, …). The set R of all\nconstructive real numbers is the constructive real line. \n\nNow of course, for any “given” real number there are a\nvariety of ways of giving explicit approximating sequences for it. Thus\nit is necessary to define an equivalence relation, “equality on\nthe reals”. The correct definition here is:\n r =ℜs\niff for any k, a number n can be found so that\n |rn+p −\n sn+p| ≤\n1/k, for all p. To say that two\nreal numbers are equal is to say that they are equivalent in this\nsense. \n\nThe real number line can be furnished with an axiomatic description.\nWe begin by assuming the existence of a set R with \n\nThe elements of R are called real numbers. A real\nnumber x is positive if x > 0 and\nnegative if −x > 0. The relation ≥\n(greater than or equal to) is defined by \n\nThe relations < and ≤ are defined in the usual way; x\nis nonnegative if 0 ≤ x. Two real numbers are\nequal if x ≥ y and y ≥\nx, in which case we write x = y. \n\nThe sets N of natural numbers, N+ of\npositive integers, Z of integers and Q of rational\nnumbers are identified with the usual subsets of R; for\ninstance N+ is identified with the set of elements\nof R of the form 1 + 1 + … + 1. \n\nThese relations and operations are subject to the following three\ngroups of axioms, which, taken together, form the system\nCA of axioms for constructive analysis, or\nthe constructive real numbers (see Bridges [1999]). \n\nField Axioms \n\nOrder Axioms \n\nThe last two axioms introduce special properties of > and ≥.\nIn the second of these the notions bounded above, bounded below,\nand bounded are defined as in classical mathematics, and the\nleast upper bound, if it exists, of a\n nonempty[47]\n set S of real numbers is the unique real number b\nsuch that \n\nSpecial Properties of >. \n  The least upper bound principle. Let S be a\nnonempty subset of R that is bounded above relative to the\nrelation ≥, such that for all real numbers a, b\nwith a < b, either b is an upper bound\nfor S or else there exists s ∈ S with\ns > a. Then S has a least upper\nbound. \n\nThe following basic properties of > and ≥ can then be\nestablished. \n\nThe constructive real line R as introduced above is a model of\nCA. Are there any other models, that is, models not\nisomorphic to R. If classical logic is assumed, \nCA is a categorical theory and so the answer is\nno. But this is not the case within intuitionistic logic, for there it\nis possible for the Dedekind and Cantor reals to fail to be\nisomorphic, despite the fact that they are both models\nof CA. \n\nIn constructive analysis, a real number is an infinite (convergent)\nsequence of rational numbers generated by an effective rule, so that\nthe constructive real line is essentially just a restriction of its\nclassical counterpart. Brouwerian intuitionism takes a more liberal\nview of the matter, resulting in a considerable enrichment of the\narithmetical continuum over the version offered by strict\nconstructivism. As conceived by intutionism, the arithmetical continuum\nadmits as real numbers not only infinite sequences determined in\nadvance by an effective rule for computing their terms, but also ones\nin whose generation free selection plays a part. The latter are called\n(free) choice sequences. Without loss of generality we may and\nshall assume that the entries in choice sequences are natural\nnumbers. \n\nWhile constructive analysis does not formally contradict classical\nanalysis, and may in fact be regarded as a subtheory of the latter, a\nnumber of intuitionistically plausible principles have been proposed\nfor the theory of choice sequences which render intuitionistic analysis\ndivergent from its classical counterpart. One such principle is\nBrouwer's Continuity Principle: given a relation\nQ(α, n) between choice sequences α and\nnumbers n, if for each α a number n may be\ndetermined for which Q(α, n) holds, then\nn can already be determined on the basis of the knowledge of a\nfinite number of terms of\n α.[48]\n From this one can\nprove a weak version of the Continuity Theorem, namely, that every\nfunction from R to R is\ncontinuous. Another such principle is Bar Induction, a certain\nform of induction for well-founded sets of finite\n sequences[49].\n Brouwer used Bar Induction and the Continuity Principle in proving his\nContinuity Theorem that every real-valued function defined on a closed\ninterval is uniformly continuous, from which, as has already been\nobserved, it follows that the intuitionistic continuum is\nindecomposable. \n\nBrouwer gave the intuitionistic conception of mathematics an\nexplicitly subjective twist by introducing the creative\nsubject. The creative subject was conceived as a kind of idealized\nmathematician for whom time is divided into discrete sequential stages,\nduring each of which he may test various propositions, attempt to\nconstruct proofs, and so on. In particular, it can always be determined\nwhether or not at stage n the creative subject has a proof of\na particular mathematical proposition p. While the theory of\nthe creative subject remains controversial, its purely mathematical\nconsequences can be obtained by a simple postulate which is entirely\nfree of subjective and temporal elements. \n\nThe creative subject allows us to define, for a given proposition\np, a binary sequence <an> by\nan = 1 if the creative subject has a proof of\np at stage n; an = 0 otherwise. Now if the\nconstruction of these sequences is the only use made of the creative\nsubject, then references to the latter may be avoided by postulating\nthe principle known as Kripke's Scheme \n\nTaken together, these principles have been shown to have remarkable\nconsequences for the indecomposability of subsets of the continuum. Not\nonly is the intuitionistic continuum indecomposable (that is, cannot be\npartitioned into two nonempty disjoint parts), but, assuming the\nContinuity Principle and Kripke's Scheme, it remains indecomposable\neven if one pricks it with a pin. The intuitionistic continuum has, as\nit were, a syrupy nature, so that one cannot simply take away one\npoint. If in addition Bar Induction is assumed, then, still more\nsurprisingly, indecomposability is maintained even when all the\nrational points are removed from the continuum. \n\nFinally, it has been shown that a natural notion of infinitesimal\ncan be developed within intuitionistic mathematics (see Vesley [1981]),\nthe idea being that an infinitesimal should be a “very\nsmall” real number in the sense of not being known to be\ndistinguishable—that is, strictly greater than or less\nthan—zero. \n\nA major development in the refounding of the concept of\ninfinitesimal took place in the nineteen seventies with the emergence\nof synthetic differential geometry, also known as smooth\ninfinitesimal\n analysis (SIA)[50].\n Based on the ideas of the American\nmathematician F. W. Lawvere, and employing the methods of category\ntheory, smooth infinitesimal analysis provides an image of the world in\nwhich the continuous is an autonomous notion, not explicable in terms\nof the discrete. It provides a rigorous framework for mathematical\nanalysis in which every function between spaces is smooth (i.e.,\ndifferentiable arbitrarily many times, and so in particular continuous)\nand in which the use of limits in defining the basic notions of the\ncalculus is replaced by nilpotent infinitesimals, that is, of\nquantities so small (but not actually zero) that some power—most\nusefully, the square—vanishes. Since in SIA all functions are\ncontinuous, it embodies in a striking way Leibniz's principle of\ncontinuity Natura non facit saltus. \n\nIn what follows, we use bold R to distinguish the\nreal line in SIA from its counterparts in classical and constructive\nanalysis. In the usual development of the calculus, for any\ndifferentiable function f on the real\nline R, y =\nf(x), it follows from Taylor's theorem that the\nincrement δy = f(x +\nδx) − f(x) in\ny attendant upon an increment δx in x\nis determined by an equation of the form \n\nwhere f ′(x) is the derivative of\nf(x) and A is a quantity whose value depends\non both x and δx. Now if it were possible to\ntake δx so small (but not demonstrably\nidentical with 0) that (δx)2 = 0 then (1)\nwould assume the simple form \n\nWe shall call a quantity having the property that its square is zero\na nilsquare infinitesimal or simply a microquantity.\nIn SIA “enough” microquantities are present to ensure that\nequation (2) holds nontrivially for arbitrary\nfunctions f: R → R. (Of\ncourse (2) holds trivially in standard mathematical analysis because\nthere 0 is the sole microquantity in this sense.) The meaning of the\nterm “nontrivial” here may be explicated in following way.\nIf we replace δx by the letter ε standing for an\narbitrary microquantity, (2) assumes the form \n\nIdeally, we want the validity of this equation to be independent of\nε , that is, given x, for it to hold for all\nmicroquantities ε. In that case the derivative f\n′(x) may be defined as the unique quantity\nD such that the equation \n\nholds for all microquantities ε. \n\nSetting x = 0 in this equation, we get in particular \n\nfor all ε. It is equation (4) that is taken as\naxiomatic in smooth infinitesimal analysis. Let us write Δ\nfor the set of microquantities, that is, \n\nThen it is postulated that, for any f: Δ →\nR, there is a unique D ∈\nR such that equation (4) holds for all ε. This\nsays that the graph of f is a straight line passing through\n(0, f(0)) with slope Δ. Thus any function on Δ is\nwhat mathematicians term affine, and so this postulate is\nnaturally termed the principle of microaffineness. It\nmeans that Δ cannot be bent or broken: it is subject\nonly to translations and rotations—and yet is not (as it\nwould have to be in ordinary analysis) identical with a point. Δ\nmay be thought of as an entity possessing position and attitude, but\nlacking true extension. \n\nNow consider the space\nΔΔ of maps\nfrom Δ to itself. It follows from the\nmicroaffineness principle that the subspace\n(ΔΔ)0\nof\nΔΔ consisting\nof maps vanishing at 0 is isomorphic to\n R[51].\n The space ΔΔ is a\n monoid[52]\n under composition which may be regarded as\nacting on Δ by evaluation: for f ∈\nΔΔ,\nf · ε = f (ε). Its subspace\n(ΔΔ)0\n is a submonoid naturally identified as the space of\nratios of microquantities. The isomorphism between\n(ΔΔ)0\n and R noted above is easily seen to be\nan isomorphism of monoids (where R is considered a\nmonoid under its usual multiplication). It follows that\nR itself may be regarded as the space of ratios of\nmicroquantities. This was essentially the view of Euler, who regarded\n(real) numbers as representing the possible results of calculating the\nratio 0/0. For this reason Lawvere has suggested that\nR be called the space of Euler reals. \n\nIf we think of a function y = f(x) as\ndefining a curve, then, for any a, the image under f\nof the “microinterval” Δ + a obtained by\ntranslating Δ to a is straight and coincides with the\ntangent to the curve at x = a. In this sense each\ncurve is “infinitesimally straight”. \n\nFrom the principle of microaffineness we deduce the important\nprinciple of microcancellation, viz. \n\nFor the premise asserts that the graph of the function g:\nΔ → R defined by\ng(ε) = aε has both slope a\nand slope b: the uniqueness condition in the principle of\nmicroaffineness then gives a = b. The principle of\nmicrocancellation supplies the exact sense in which there are\n“enough” infinitesimals in smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis. \n\nFrom the principle of microaffineness it also follows that all\nfunctions on R are continuous, that is,\nsend neighbouring points to neighbouring points. Here two\npoints x, y on R are said to be\nneighbours if x − y is in Δ, that is, if\nx and y differ by a microquantity. To see this, given\nf : R → R and\nneighbouring points x, y, note that y =\nx + ε with ε in Δ, so that \n\nBut clearly any multiple of a microquantity is also a microquantity,\nso εf ′(x) is a microquantity, and the\nresult follows. \n\nIn fact, since equation (3) holds for any f, it also holds\nfor its derivative f ′; it follows that functions in\nsmooth infinitesimal analysis are differentiable arbitrarily many\ntimes, thereby justifying the use of the term “smooth”. \n\nLet us derive a basic law of the differential calculus, the\nproduct rule: \n\nTo do this we compute \n\n(fg)(x + ε) = f(x +\nε)g(x + ε) = [f(x)\n+ f ′(x)]·[g(x) +\ng′(x)] \n\n= f(x)g(x) +\nε(f ′g + fg′)\n+ ε2f ′g′ \n\n= f(x)g(x) +\nε(f ′g +\nfg′), \n\nsince ε2 = 0. Therefore\nε(fg)′ =\nε(f ′g +\nfg′), and the result follows by\nmicrocancellation. \n\nA stationary point a in R of a function\nf : R →\nR is defined to be one in whose vicinity\n“infinitesimal variations” fail to change the value of\nf, that is, such that f(a + ε) =\nf(a) for all ε. This means that\nf(a) + εf\n′(a)= f(a), so that\nεf ′(a) = 0 for all ε, whence\nit follows from microcancellation that f ′(a)\n= 0. This is Fermat's rule. \n\nAn important postulate concerning stationary points that we adopt in\nsmooth infinitesimal analysis is the \n\nPut succinctly, “universal local constancy implies global\nconstancy”. It follows from this that two functions with\nidentical derivatives differ by at most a constant. \n\nIn ordinary analysis the continuum R is connected\nin the sense that it cannot be split into two non empty subsets neither\nof which contains a limit point of the other. In smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis it has the vastly stronger property of\nindecomposability: it cannot be split in any way\nwhatsoever into two disjoint nonempty subsets. For suppose\nR = U ∪ V with U ∩\nV = ∅. Define f : R\n→ {0, 1} by f(x) = 1 if\nx ∈ U, f(x) = 0 if x\n∈ V. We claim that f is constant. For we\nhave \n\nThis gives 4 possibilities: \n\n(ii) f(x) = 0 & f(x +\nε) = 1 \n\n(iii) f(x) = 1 & f(x +\nε) = 0 \n\n(iv) f(x) = 1 & f(x +\nε) = 1 \n\nPossibilities (ii) and (iii) may be ruled out because f is\ncontinuous. This leaves (i) and (iv), in either of which\nf(x) = f(x + ε). So\nf is locally, and hence globally, constant, that is,\nconstantly 1 or 0. In the first case V = ∅ , and in the\nsecond U = ∅. \n\nWe observe that the postulates of smooth infinitesimal analysis are\nincompatible with the law of excluded middle of classical\nlogic. This incompatibility can be demonstrated in two ways, one\ninformal and the other rigorous. First the informal argument. Consider\nthe function f defined for real numbers x by\nf(x) = 1 if x = 0 and f(x)\n= 0 whenever x ≠ 0. If the law of excluded middle held,\neach real number would then be either equal or unequal to 0, so that\nthe function f would be defined on the whole of\nR. But, considered as a function with domain\nR, f is clearly discontinuous.\nSince, as we know, in smooth infinitesimal analysis every function on\nR is continuous, f cannot have domain\nR\n there[53].\n So the law of excluded middle fails in\nsmooth infinitesimal analysis. To put it succinctly, universal\ncontinuity implies the failure of the law of excluded middle. \n\nHere now is the rigorous argument. We show that the failure of the\nlaw of excluded middle can be derived from the principle of\ninfinitesimal cancellation. To begin with, if x ≠ 0, then\nx2 ≠ 0, so that, if x2 = 0,\nthen necessarily not x ≠ 0. This means that \n\nNow suppose that the law of excluded middle were to hold. Then we\nwould have, for any ε, either ε = 0 or ε ≠\n0. But (*) allows us to eliminate the second alternative, and we infer\nthat, for all ε, ε = 0. This may be written \n\nfrom which we derive by microcancellation the falsehood 1 = 0. So\nagain the law of excluded middle must fail. \n\nThe “internal” logic of smooth infinitesimal analysis is\naccordingly not full classical logic. It is, instead,\nintuitionistic logic, that is, the logic derived from the\nconstructive interpretation of mathematical assertions. In our brief\nsketch we did not notice this “change of logic” because,\nlike much of elementary mathematics, the topics we discussed are\nnaturally treated by constructive means such as direct computation. \n\nWhat are the algebraic and order structures on\nR in SIA? As far as the former is concerned, there is\nlittle difference from the classical situation: in SIA\nR is equipped with the usual addition and\nmultiplication operations under which it is a field. In particular,\nR satisfies the condition that each x ≠ 0\nhas a multiplicative inverse. Notice, however, that since in SIA no\nmicroquantity (apart from 0 itself) is provably ≠ 0, microquantities\nare not required to have multiplicative inverses (a requirement which\nwould lead to inconsistency). From a strictly algebraic standpoint,\nR in SIA differs from its classical counterpart only\nin being required to satisfy the principle of infinitesimal\ncancellation. \n\nThe situation is different, however, as regards the order structure\nof R in SIA. Because of the failure of the law of\nexcluded middle, the order relation < on R in SIA\ncannot satisfy the trichotomy law \n\nand accordingly < must be a partial, rather than a\ntotal ordering. Since microquantities do not have\nmultiplicative inverses, and R is a field, any\nmicroquantity ε must satisfy \n\nAccordingly, if we define the relation < by x <\ny iff ¬(y < x), then, for any\nmicroquantity ε we have \n\nUsing these ideas we can identify three infinitesimal\nneighbourhoods of 0 on R in SIA, each of which is\nincluded in its successor. First, the set Δ of microquantities\nitself, next, the set I = {x ∈\nR : ¬x ≠ 0} of elements\nindistinguishable from 0; finally, the set J = {x\n∈ R : x ≤ 0\n ∧\n x ≥ 0}\nof elements neither less nor greater than 0. These three may be thought\nof as the infinitesimal neighbourhoods of 0 defined algebraically,\nlogically, and order-theoretically, respectively. \n\nIn certain models of SIA the system of natural numbers\npossesses some subtle and intriguing features which make it possible to\nintroduce another type of infinitesimal—the so-called\ninvertible infinitesimals—resembling those of\nnonstandard analysis, whose presence engenders yet another\ninfinitesimal neighbourhood of 0 properly containing all those\nintroduced above. \n\nIn SIA the set N of natural numbers can be defined\nto be the smallest subset of R which contains 0 and is\nclosed under the operation of adding 1. In some models of SIA,\nR satisfies the Archimedean principle that\nevery real number is majorized by a natural number. However, models of\nSIA have been constructed (see Moerdijk and Reyes [1991]) in which\nR is not Archimedean in this sense. In these models it\nis more natural to consider, in place of N, the set\nN* of smooth natural numbers defined by \n\nN* is the set of points of intersection of the\nsmooth curve y = sin πx with the positive\nx-axis. In these models R can be shown to\npossess the Archimedean property provided that in the\ndefinition N is replaced by\nN*. In these models, then, N is a\nproper subset of N*: the members of\nN* − N may be considered\nnonstandard integers. Multiplicative inverses of nonstandard\nintegers are infinitesimals, but, being themselves invertible, they are\nof a different type from the ones we have considered so far. It is\nquite easy to show that they, as well as the infinitesimals in\nJ (and so also those in Δ and I) are all\ncontained in the set—a further infinitesimal neighbourhood of\n0— \n\nof infinitely small elements of\nR. The members of the set \n\nof invertible elements of K are naturally identified as\ninvertible infinitesimals. Being obtained as inverses of\n“infinitely large” reals (i.e., reals r satisfying\n∀n∈N(n < r)\n ∨\n ∀n∈N(r < −n))\n the members of\nIn are the counterparts in SIA of the infinitesimals of\nnonstandard analysis. \n\nFinally, a brief word on the models of SIA. These are the\nso-called smooth toposes, categories (see entry on\n category theory)\n of a certain kind in\nwhich all the usual mathematical operations can be performed but whose\ninternal logic is intuitionistic and in which every map between spaces\nis smooth, that is, differentiable without limit. It is this\n“universal smoothness” that makes the presence of\ninfinitesimal objects such as Δ possible. The\nconstruction of smooth toposes (see Moerdijk and Reyes [1991])\nguarantees the consistency of SIA with intuitionistic logic. This is so\ndespite the evident fact that SIA is not consistent with classical\nlogic.","contact.mail":"jbell@uwo.ca","contact.domain":"uwo.ca"}]
