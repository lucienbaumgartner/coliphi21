[{"date.published":"2014-03-19","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-more/","author1":"Dominic Baker-Smith","entry":"thomas-more","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThomas More (1478–1535) was an English lawyer, humanist,\nstatesman, and Catholic martyr, whose paradoxical life is reflected in\nhis contrasting titles: he was knighted by King Henry VIII in 1521 and\ncanonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935. Born to an affluent mercantile and\nprofessional family, he was representative of the lively intellectual\nculture which had evolved in fifteenth century London and which\nprovided a platform for the early manifestations of humanism.  More's\noutlook was shaped by his legal role in the affairs of the city, then\nby far the largest in England with a population of about 50,000, and\nit was as a representative of city interests that he was first drawn\ninto service of the Crown. This involvement with London's civic life\nalso played its part in the conception of Utopia, his best\nknown work, completed in 1516. His friendship with the Dutch scholar\nDesiderius Erasmus lasted over thirty years and was crucial to the\ndevelopment of his own ideas on literary studies, in particular the\nrevival of Greek, and on the social possibilities of education. It was\nthanks to Erasmus that he was drawn into the literary networks of\nNorthern humanism. While More cannot be classified in any formal sense\nas a philosopher, it is in his writings in defence of humanism and in\nUtopia that he can best be seen as an exponent of ideas. In\nthe early years of their association More and Erasmus shared a\ncritical interest in exposing the follies and abuses of contemporary\nlife, not least in matters of religious practice; but once More was\ndrawn into the savage polemics of the early Reformation he defended\nCatholic orthodoxy with all the weapons at his disposal.  However, his\nefforts were compromised by a shift in government policy.  His\nconscientious refusal to support King Henry's campaign to repudiate\nhis marriage to Katherine of Aragon led to his retirement from public\nlife and, ultimately, to imprisonment. During fourteen months in the\nTower he wrote a number of devotional works which are in contrast to\nthe severity of his polemical writings. Tried for treason, More was\nbeheaded on 6 July 1535. His death caused widespread indignation on\nthe Continent, where he was initially seen as a model of integrity, a\nSeneca-like counsellor who resisted a tyrannical ruler.  His status as\na Catholic martyr emerged later under the influence of the English\nCounter-Reformation. \n\n\n\nOn the title-page of Utopia Thomas More identifies himself as\na citizen of the renowned city of London. The city, with its\nprivileges and corporate procedures, was central to his formation and\nto the style of his political thought. Born in Milk Street,\nCripplegate, in February 1478, he was the son of a successful\nbarrister, John More. Thomas began his education at St Anthony's, the\noutstanding grammar school in the city, but around 1490 he was placed\nas a page in the household of Cardinal John Morton, Archbishop of\nCanterbury and Lord Chancellor. Morton was evidently struck by More's\ntalents since after two years he was sent on to Oxford, perhaps to\nCanterbury College. It was probably never intended that he should take\na degree, but he must have received some grounding in the subjects of\nthe trivium (grammar, dialectic, rhetoric).  Morton, who died\nin 1500, would remain a figure of personal significance to More,\nappearing both in Richard III (in his earlier office as\nbishop of Ely) and in Utopia, where he serves as the figure\nof a wise and flexible statesman. \n\nAn important source for More's biography is the letter that Erasmus\nwrote to Ulrich von Hutten in 1519 (CWE 7: Ep. 999), but it needs to\nbe treated with caution. Erasmus had his own agenda, and he is largely\nresponsible for the idea that John More dragged his reluctant son into\na legal career. In fact, there is a marked consistency about Thomas's\nearly career, and it seems that he successfully balanced his humanist\ninterests with commitment to the law. After two years at Oxford, he\nreturned to London, initially studying at New Inn, before he was\nadmitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1496. When Erasmus arrived on his first\nvisit to England in 1499, he reacted with enthusiasm to the\nintellectual atmosphere he encountered and lists four new\nacquaintances, John Colet, William Grocyn, Thomas Linacre, and Thomas\nMore (CWE 1: Ep. 118). A common feature of this group is their\ninterest in Greek studies; moreover, all of them, apart from More, had\ntravelled in Italy. It is possible that More had picked up some Greek\nin Oxford: Grocyn returned there in 1491 after a period of study in\nFlorence and had given the first Greek lectures in the university, but\nhe moved in 1496 to London, where More would have had easy access to\nhis teaching.  In any case, Thomas Linacre, who had shared Grocyn's\nstudies in Florence, returned to England in 1499, and More mentions\nreading Aristotle's Meteorologica under his guidance. The\nacquisition of competence in Greek was of profound importance in\nMore's intellectual development, and it provided the basis for his\ncollaboration with Erasmus. It was in the course of the latter's visit\nto England in 1505 that they agreed to translate works by the Greek\nsatirist Lucian of Samosata into Latin, and their combined efforts\nwere printed at Paris in the following year. More was an instinctive\nironist and clearly responded to Lucian's exposure of human\nself-deception; this works not only on the level of private delusion\nbut also on the broader level of cultural convention. More even\ninvokes Lucian as an antidote to the superstitious fables which so\neasily distort Christian belief and might even mislead such an\nauthoritative figure as St Augustine (CWM 3:1,5). \n\nIn 1501 More completed his legal studies and qualified as a\nbarrister. It was also the year in which he delivered a course of\nlectures on Augustine's City of God in Grocyn's church of St\nLawrence Jewry. We have no record of what these contained, though\nThomas Stapleton in Tres Thomae (1588) claims that he treated\nthe work more from the standpoint of history and philosophy than\ntheology. Augustine would remain central to More's thinking, yet, in\nhis 1515 letter to Martin Dorp, he takes the opportunity to criticize\nthe saint's view on the corporeality of demons:  Being a man, he could make a mistake. I take his word\nas seriously as anyone's, but I take no man's word\nunconditionally. (CWM 15: 69) \nSuch an approach to religious authority is evidence of More's\nadherence to the critical standards of humanism. His ability to\ncombine an interest in the academic study of law (he was acting as\nLent Reader at Lincoln's Inn as late as 1514), together with Greek and\npatristic studies, while pursuing an increasingly busy legal career,\nis remarkable. In his prefatory letter to Utopia, he gives a\nhumorous account of the pressures that have hindered completion of the\nwork, but it seems that this demanding routine must have been his\nnormal pattern of life. Prior to his marriage in 1505, More reportedly\nlived in the Charterhouse, presumably in the guest lodgings, an\nassociation that has led to conjectures about his attraction to the\nmonastic life, or at least to the priesthood. Erasmus has not helped\nhere since he uses More as an example of one who, having tested\nhimself for a religious vocation, could not shake off the idea of\nmarriage: “And so he chose to be a god-fearing husband rather\nthan an immoral priest” (CWE 7: Ep. 999, p. 21). Modern\nscholarship has sometimes seen More as a “spoiled monk”,\nyet there is a striking unity of purpose about More's early life; he\ncould find a rationale for the combination of private study and prayer\nwith public business in the ideal presented in the Epistle on\nMixed Life by the Augustinian canon Walter Hilton (d. 1396),\nwhose writings he recommends.  Describing a life which balances\nspiritual culture with action in the world, Hilton applies it to those\nlaymen who possess both material wealth and authority over others,\n“to govern and sustain them”. The New Building which More\nwould later erect on his Chelsea estate contained a chapel, a library\nand a gallery and, according to William Roper, More's son-in-law, he\nwould withdraw to it regularly, “to be solitary, and sequester\nhimself from worldly company” (Roper 1935: 25). This sounds more\nlike Hilton's ideal than some form of monastic nostalgia. \n\nMeanwhile, More's legal career in the city flourished, and in 1504 he\nwas returned as a Member of Parliament. It was in the course of this\nParliament that Henry VII's demand for a retrospective subsidy to\ncover the expenses of his daughter's marriage to James IV of Scotland\nwas rejected, and Roper attributes this substantially to More's\nintervention. It is unlikely that the affair reached quite the pitch\nof drama that Roper suggests, but it does fit with the hostile view of\nHenry VII's fiscal policies which More reveals both in his Latin poem\ncelebrating Henry VIII's coronation (CWM 3:2, no. 19), and implicitly\nin Utopia. Early in the following year, he married Jane Colt\nand moved into the Old Barge, Bucklersbury, a residence large enough\nto permit a flow of guests; among them was Erasmus, who arrived in\nAugust 1509, full of anticipation of patronage under the new king and\ncarrying in his head the initial idea for The Praise of\nFolly. Under its Latin title Encomium Moriae, this\npunned on More's name, “which is as close in form to\nMoria (Folly) as you are in fact remote from folly\nitself” (CWE 2: Ep. 222, p. 161); and once Erasmus had completed\nit under More's roof, he dedicated it to his friend, whom he compares\nto Democritus, the laughing philosopher. Certainly More's sardonic\nlaughter found its way into his Latin epigrams, many of which must\ndate from these years; but a more solemn undertaking was the\ntranslation of the biography of the syncretist philosopher Giovanni\nPico della Mirandola (1463–1494) by his nephew Gianfrancesco,\nwhich would seem to date from about this time. Stapleton suggests that\nMore settled on Pico as a model of the lay intellectual, though Pico's\nretired life might seem the obverse of More's public\nengagement. More's aim in the Life of Pico was not simply to\nprovide an English translation of Gianfrancesco's text but to modify\nit for his own ends; so a substantial part of the original is cut,\nmost notably the parts dealing with Pico's more exotic intellectual\ninterests and controversies, and out of forty-seven letters printed by\nGianfrancesco only three are retained. Rather than justifying Pico's\nhighly individual career, More is concerned to sketch the outline of\nan edifying life: in effect, Pico's conversion from the early\narrogance with which he had proposed to defend his nine hundred\nConclusiones against all comers to a career of selfless\nscholarship, dedicated to “the love of God and the profit of his\nchurch”. To this end Pico disposed of his patrimony and lands to\nhis nephew so cheaply that “it seemed rather a gift than a\nsale”, and also distanced himself from the distractions of\npublic life in order to preserve his independence (CWM 1,\n63–4). These are the very characteristics that will later\nreappear in the figure of Raphael, the wandering philosopher who is\nour guide to the island of Utopia. Of the three letters which More\ntranslates, that to Andrea Corneo is the most important, dealing as it\ndoes with the social role of philosophy. Corneo has urged Pico to put\nhis studies to use in “the civil and active life”, but to\nPico this compromises the integrity of the philosopher; he is prepared\nto tolerate something tantamount to the mixed life in which\ncontemplation and action are reconciled, but he maintains the\nsuperiority of a life free of any dependence on external recognition.\nPhilosophers, he concludes, cannot serve: “They dwell with them\nself, and be content with the tranquillity of their own mind”\n(CWM 1, 87). We can see More here putting down markers that will later\nshape the dispute about philosophy and the public sphere which\nsurfaces in Utopia.  \n\nHowever the year 1510, which saw the Life of Pico in print,\noffered More little scope for tranquil retirement. He was heavily\nengaged in London affairs, representing the city in Henry VIII's first\nParliament, and in September he became one of its two Undersheriffs,\nthe office by which he identifies himself on the title-page of\nUtopia. As Undersheriff, he was responsible for providing\nlegal advice to senior officers of the corporation, but in particular\nfor presiding over the Sheriff's court; it was, in fact, a key post\nthat placed him at the heart of the city's life and at the same time\ngave him a vivid sense of the social problems played out before the\ncourts. The urgency of his obligations may well explain the haste of\nhis remarriage: his wife Jane, who had borne him four children, died\nin June 1511, and allegedly within a month he had married Alice Middleton, the\nwidow of a fellow member of the Mercers' Company. More had to consider\nnot only his children but also the management of his substantial\nhousehold: among its occasional lodgers were counted Erasmus and also\nAndrea Ammonio, who became Latin secretary to the king in 1511. The\nevidence points to some intellectual intimacy between these friends,\nand this takes on special interest in light of the new king's warlike\nconduct. Fired by the example of his illustrious predecessor Henry V,\nthe victor of Agincourt, Henry VIII had entered into the Holy League,\ninstigated by Pope Julius II against France, and prepared to attack\nEngland's traditional enemy. When Henry invaded France in 1513 Ammonio\naccompanied him and sent back accounts of the campaign which are\nechoed in Erasmus's own exposure of martial glory in the adage\n“Dulce bellum inexpertis”, one of the most widely\ncirculated anti-war tracts ever written (CWE 35:\n399–440). More's immediate response was limited to a handful of\nepigrams, the most effective being a cluster (CWM 3:2,\nnos. 188–195) which ridicule the Chordigera, a\npretentious mini-epic by the French humanist Germain de Brie that\ncelebrates the deeds of a French naval commander. More objects to the\nway epic convention is used to mask the brutal realities of war (the\ncommander was incinerated in his burning ship); like Erasmus, he aims\nto discredit those cultural idols which promote militarism. The full\nimpact of his response to the events of 1513 only emerges later in the\nwar practices of the Utopians, whose objective approach to conflict\nleaves no room for spurious concepts of glory. When Erasmus left\nEngland in July 1514, he took with him the thoughts, and probably the\ndrafts, that would provide major additions to the 1515\nAdagia, the so-called “Utopian edition”. These\ndealt not only with war but equally with the dangers of absolute rule:\nthe Lucianic discussions at the Old Barge had stimulated a radical\ncritique of established social forms. \nIronically, it was in that year of 1515 that More was first drawn into\nthe service of the Crown. According to Roper, his talents had been\nspotted, probably by Cardinal Wolsey, when he appeared in Star Chamber\nas counsel for the papal ambassador in a case of an impounded\ncargo. In May he was dispatched to Bruges, along with Cuthbert\nTunstall and others, to renegotiate English trading agreements with\nthe Netherlands, then under threat. More would have been included not\nonly for his competence in mercantile law but also as a representative\nof London interests. It was to prove an extended visit, and he did not\nreturn to England until the end of October. Since the negotiations\nwere temporarily suspended in July, this gave him ample leisure to\ntravel and to embark on two of his most important writings, the\nUtopia and the letter addressed to Martin Dorp in defence\nof literary studies. His travels took him to Mechelen, where he\nenjoyed the hospitality of Jerôme de Busleyden and wrote complimentary\nepigrams on his house and his collection of antique coins, and also to\nTournai, then under English occupation; but the most significant\nencounter was with Pieter Gillis at Antwerp. Gillis (c.\n1486–1533), a valued friend of Erasmus, was secretary to the\ncorporation of Antwerp: as a lawyer-humanist holding office in a\nlargely independent mercantile city, he had a natural affinity with\nMore, and it was while visiting him that More's most famous work\nbegan. Utopia, or to give it its full title De optimo\nreipublicae statu deque nova insula Utopia (“On the Best\nState of a Commonwealth and on the New Island of Utopia”),\nbegins with a chance encounter after divine service in the cathedral,\na device that may be intended to recall the opening of Plato's\nRepublic. More and Gillis, together with the wandering\nphilosopher, Raphael Hythlodaeus, agree to retire to the garden of\nMore's lodging in order to pursue their conversation. While this is\ninitially concerned with Raphael's travels, it soon switches to the\nissue of political engagement. Raphael justifies his refusal to enter\nthe service of a prince by a scathing exposure of European\ninstitutions and customs. In justifying this stance, he appeals to the\nwise and effective institutions of the Utopians, grounded as these are\non community of possessions. Pressed by his companions, Raphael then\nprovides a detailed description of the island and its social\narrangements, concluding with a withering attack on the injustices of\nEurope and its money-driven society. As the book ends and the\nfictional More leads his guests into supper, he shares with the reader\na mixed response to the challenging features of Utopian life.  \nErasmus, in his letter to von Hutten, asserts that More wrote\nUtopia in two stages: “The second book he had written\nearlier, when at leisure; at a later opportunity he added the first in\nthe heat of the moment.” Quite what prompted the genesis of the\nbook is unknown, but the fact that Gillis appears as one of the\nfictional speakers suggests that it may have been initiated by\nconversations at his house. It also makes sense to suppose that the\nactual description of an imaginary island came first, when More had\nleisure to explore the possibilities of a society exempt from the\ninherited pressures and distortions of the European world. This\naccounts for Raphael's extensive description of Utopian life which\ntakes up most of Book 2, and yet this solo performance is set within\nthe context of conversational exchange in an Antwerp garden. It seems\nlikely that this containing dialogue, which forms Book 1 and the\nclosing paragraphs of Book 2, was written later, probably after More's\nreturn to London. J. H. Hexter, who has offered the most persuasive\naccount of the composition of the work, even argues for two distinct\nintentions within it: the original intention of projecting a society\nbased on community of goods; and a secondary one concerned with the\nreception of philosophical ideals within the political community. The\nlatter issue had been raised by Plato, notably at Republic\n592A–B where a crucial distinction is drawn between the\ncity of the philosopher's birth and that other city “whose home\nis in words, for I think it can be found nowhere on earth”. Up\nuntil its actual publication, More referred to his book as\nNusquama, the Latin for “nowhere”; the Greek\ntitle Utopia, “no place”, was a late\nintervention, perhaps by Erasmus, who saw the book through the\npress. \n\nMore returned to England at the end of October, but not before writing\nhis lengthy epistle to the Louvain theologian Martin Dorp.  Ostensibly\na defence of Erasmus and his philological approach to the biblical\ntext, this offers an important statement of humanist ideals, highly\ncritical of the artificial linguistic universe generated by scholastic\ndialectic and insistent on the priority of Greek, “since it is\nfrom Greek that the rest of mankind has received every variety of\nknowledge”. Evidently the months More spent in the Netherlands\nhad been stimulating and productive: he had established his\ncredentials among the Northern humanists and, as he departed for\nEngland, he took with him the draft description of Utopia. Yet, as his\nprefatory letter to Gillis indicates, he had little leisure in which\nto continue with it: while heavily engaged with city commitments he\nwas also drawn into court business—as Andrea Ammonio reported:\n“None bids my lord of York [Wolsey] good morrow earlier than\nhe” (CWE 3: Ep. 389, p.239). This makes it all the more\nsignificant that the opening book of Utopia is concerned with\nissues of political practice within the identifiable world of Europe.\nThe whole framework which encloses Raphael's account of the\nextraordinary island, the conversation of friends in an Antwerp\ngarden, is focused on the tension between the received order and\npolitical idealism. Should one stand aloof like Raphael, rejecting the\ncity of one's birth, or try to modify it in light of the ideal as\nMore's fictional-self attempts to argue? In the late summer of 1516\nErasmus visited London, and this may well have prompted More to\ncomplete the book; in any case, More sent the final text to him in the\nautumn, and it was printed at Louvain in December, with minor\nadditions by Erasmus and Gillis. \n\nThe one other work of a specifically political character which More\nwrote was The History of King Richard the Third,\nalternatively the Historia Richardi Tertii since it was\nwritten in both English and Latin versions. Indeed, More appears to\nhave worked on the two concurrently, and neither is a simple\ntranslation of the other.  The Historia concludes with the\ncoronation of the usurper Richard, while the History\ncontinues with the murder of his nephews and breaks off in mid-flight\nas Bishop Morton, later More's own mentor, tries to turn the Duke of\nBuckingham against the king. No part of the work was published in\nMore's lifetime, and even the period of its composition is obscure. It\nseems likely that More worked at it, on and off, over a period of\nyears, conceivably between 1513 and 1520, when his humanist interests\nwere dominant. While he had access to first-hand informants, it is\nclear that the intention is rather to enact a moral point than to\nprovide an exact chronicle, and this gives it a certain affinity with\nUtopia. Both works show a concern with social pathology: by\nwhat means can a state be corrupted? Although the period of\nRichard III covers the years of More's early childhood, the\nmost important influences on his writing are the Roman historians\nTacitus and Sallust. The latter, in particular, would have interested\nMore, not least because Augustine in the City of God praises\nhis analysis of the moral collapse of the Roman Republic. Sallusts's\naccount of the conduct of the Roman patriciate reveals a comparable\nprocess of institutional subversion to that described in More's\nhistory, where the driving forces are divisive faction and the\n“pestilent serpent ambition”. In the Latin text the words\nused, “execrabilis belua superbia”, match those\nof Raphael in the Utopia: as he concludes his catalogue of\nthe injustices of European society, it is pride, superbia,\n“the origin and begetter of all plagues”, which Raphael\nsees as the ultimate obstacle to social justice. Flattery and\ndeception pervade the action and erode all forms of social trust. At\nthe end of the English text, even Morton, in so many ways More's model\nprelate, shows moral ambivalence as he incites the Duke of Buckingham\nto rebel against Richard. Various explanations have been proffered as\nto why More left the work unfinished—it seems unlikely that\npressure of work would have been the sole cause. Clearly such a recent\nhistory would be liable to offend certain of his contemporaries, and\nits negative exposure of public affairs would jar with his own\nincreasing involvement in government business. It offers little scope\nfor the kind of ameliorative participation in the political order that\nMore's fictional self tries to defend in Utopia.  \n\nNonetheless, More was drawn into the royal service, and his membership\nof the Council was confirmed by March 1518. Apart from his practical\nabilities, he seems to have appealed to the king as a prestigious\nfigure, a court intellectual: even as he entered the Council, the\nthird edition of Utopia was printed by Johann Froben at\nBasel, along with his Epigrams, in a volume which confirmed\nMore's continental reputation. At the same time, he made a series of\ninterventions in favour of Greek and of Erasmus's educational\ninnovations. The “Letter to the University of Oxford” is\naddressed from Abingdon, where the itinerant court was resident; its\naim is to discredit the self-styled Trojans who are resisting the\nintroduction of liberal studies (CWM 15, 133). The “Letter to\nEdward Lee” was part of a wider, and unsuccessful, effort to\npersuade Lee, who later became archbishop of York, from publishing his\nhostile criticisms of Erasmus' New Testament, and it contains More's\nmost vehement endorsement of his friend's efforts which, he asserts,\nhave done more for secular and sacred learning “than virtually\nanyone else's exertions for the last several centuries” (CWM 15,\n161). The most vitriolic of the letters is that addressed “to a\nmonk”, tentatively identified by modern scholarship as John\nBatmanson, later prior of the London Charterhouse. In it More comes\nclose to the spirit of the Praise of Folly, mocking at the\npresumption of cloistered religious who, “perched on a sunbeam,\nlook down from the heights on the general populace creeping like ants\non the ground…” (CWM 15, 279). It certainly shows him at\nhis most anti-clerical, but the underlying theme is the importance of\nGreek, and consequently of Erasmus' contribution, to the renewal of\ntheology. As things turned out, it would prove to be his last\nstatement on the humanist curriculum.  \n\nPredictably, there has been some debate about More's reluctance to\nenter the court world—Erasmus insists that he was\n“dragged” into it—but there is a forward impetus in\nMore's career which suggests that, while well aware of the dangers, he\ncould also see it as an opportunity to realize the active element of\nHilton's “mixed life”. It may have been on just such terms\nthat he entered a world which he had previously satirized. Once in the\nCouncil, his duties were multifarious. As royal secretary up to 1525,\nhe was the intermediary between the king and his chief minister\nCardinal Wolsey, with whom he had close, though not cordial,\nrelations. There were aspects of Wolsey's administration which he\ncould endorse, among them the cardinal's efforts to improve access to\njustice, especially for the poor, and he was heavily engaged in the\njudicial functions of the Council, sitting in the Court of Requests\nand Star Chamber. Beyond his judicial duties, More was also employed\nas an “orator” in both of the current senses, delivering\naddresses of welcome to visiting dignitaries and serving as an\nambassador. Given the mocking account of treaties in Utopia\n(CU: 197–201), it is unlikely that he was over-optimistic about\ntheir lasting effect, but he played a significant diplomatic role in\nthe 1520s, participating in a number of important negotiations. He\nderived particular satisfaction from his part in the “Ladies'\nPeace” of Cambrai in 1529 which restored “a long-desired\npeace to the world”, since he mentions it in the inscription he\ndevised for his own tomb (SL: p.181). His skills as a negotiator were\nclearly appreciated, and they found domestic applications as well: in\n1523, after his election as Speaker of the Commons, he delivered a\nmemorable plea to the king for the privilege of free speech in the\nHouse, while during the same session he obtained for the Crown a\nsubsidy which the Commons had initially resisted. When Wolsey fell\nfrom favour in 1529 and More succeeded him as Lord Chancellor, he had\npresided over both Houses of Parliament. \n\nRoper reports a conversation with his father-in-law in which More\ndeclared that he would gladly be thrown into the Thames in a sack if\nonly three things could realized: that there should be peace between\nChristian princes, that turmoil in the church might be settled\n“in a perfect uniformity of religion”, and that the matter\nof the king's marriage might come to a good conclusion (Roper 1935:\n24–5). If the peace of Cambrai might satisfy his first\nrequirement, the two other issues would prove more problematic. In\n1521, as Luther's challenge to the Catholic church gained momentum,\nKing Henry published his Assertio septem sacramentorum, a\nstatement of orthodoxy which won him the title Defender of the Faith\nfrom a grateful pope. More appears to have had some editorial role in\nthis, and it marks the beginning of a new phase in his intellectual\ncareer, as an apologist for the Catholic faith.  Thirteen years later,\nwriting in his own defence to Thomas Cromwell, More would bitingly\nobserve that his early doubts about the divine institution of papal\nprimacy had been put at rest by the king himself (SL: p.212). Luther's\nresponse to the royal book was predictably offensive, and More was put\nforward to retaliate in kind; his Responsio ad Lutherum\n(1523) is a vigorous presentation of familiar arguments, without much\nevidence of engaging with Luther's thought. Basic to his argument is\nthe appeal to tradition, understood as the unwritten deposit of\nteaching which precedes the Gospel texts and provides the matrix\nwithin which they must be interpreted. After his appointment as\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1525, he was drawn directly\ninto the campaign against the circulation of heretical books, and in\n1528 his old colleague Tunstall, now bishop of London, commissioned\nhim to respond to heretical books. This resulted in a daunting body of\nwritings in the vernacular which extends from A Dialogue\nConcerning Heresies in 1529 to The Answer to a Poisoned\nBook in 1534, and some of its aspects are discussed below.  \n\nMore succeeded Wolsey as Chancellor in October 1529, but he took on a\nless ambitious portfolio of duties, conceivably because of his\ninability in conscience to support the king's efforts to annul his\nmarriage to Catherine of Aragon. Largely excluded from foreign\naffairs, he built instead on his predecessor's policy of legal reform,\naiming for greater reliance on equity in the application of common\nlaw. Roper describes his confrontation with the common law judges in\nwhich he upheld his use of injunctions to modify verdicts in the\ncommon law courts and urged the judges to mitigate the rigid\napplication of precedent through their own discretion, according to\nconscience. Though the judges were unresponsive, More's brief tenure\nof office has been described as a “magisterial\nperformance” (Guy 1980: 93), and it naturally invites comparison\nwith Utopian legal practice where the most obvious interpretation is\nthe most equitable one (CU: 197). In addition, he assumed\nresponsibility for assisting the ecclesiastical authorities in the\nsuppression of heresy, a direct consequence of the oath imposed on\nsecular judges, requiring them to investigate and extirpate heresy, a\nsurvival of Henry V's anti-Lollard legislation (CWM 6:1, 409; 8:1,\n28). Six heretics were executed during his tenure of office, three\nwith his personal involvement; in this respect recent scholarship has\nconcluded that while More acted with severity, in a deliberate counter\nto Wolsey's “gentle and courteous” approach which was\nevidently failing, he did so within the law. However, his position as\nChancellor swiftly became untenable. Within days of taking office he\nhad opened the “Reformation” Parliament, which soon\nestablished its anticlerical credentials; and, in view of the growing\nunlikelihood of a favourable decision from Rome over the king's\nmarriage, royal policy shifted towards an alliance with the Commons'\nattack on clerical privileges. One irony was that More had ex\nofficio to convey to Parliament the opinions of various European\nuniversities on the validity of the royal marriage, most of them\nfavourable to the king. On 15 May 1532, a depleted Convocation enacted\nthe Submission by which the clerical estate surrendered their\nindependent power to legislate, effectively bringing spiritual\njurisdiction under secular control. More resigned his office the\nfollowing day. While it has been suggested that he acted as leader of\na disaffected faction, there is little evidence for this; it seems\nmore likely that he withdrew from an alien political landscape and\nfocused on writing, in particular his dispute with Christopher St\nGerman over the discrepancy between common law practice and the\ninquisitorial procedures of church courts. Unwilling to take the oath\nto the Act of Succession on account of its anti-papal preamble, he was\nsent to the Tower of London on 17 April 1534, where he remained in\nconfinement, though free to write. In November of that year the Act of\nSupremacy made the king Supreme Head of the Church in England, and a\nrelated Act made it treason to deny that title “by writing or\nwords”. After a series of interrogations, which make it clear\nthat More did not actively seek martyrdom, he was tried at Westminster\nHall on 1 July 1535, found guilty of treason, and executed five days\nlater. As his reported words to the court make clear, he considered\nhimself to be dying for the sake of the unity of Christendom. \n\nOne of the best known anecdotes about More concerns a visit paid by\nthe king to his house at Chelsea: when Roper congratulated him on this\nfavour, More—ever the realist—remarked that if his head\ncould win the king a castle in France it would not fail to go (Roper\n1935: 21). In Richard III a major theme is this discrepancy\nbetween public performance and hidden motive, and More conveys it\nfiguratively through the image of the theatre: “these matters be\nkings' games, as it were stage plays, and for the more part played\nupon scaffolds” (CWM 2, 81). This moderate pessimism can be\nassociated with his early study of St Augustine, the Church Father\nwhom he knew most intimately. When preparing his 1501 lectures on the\nCity of God, he must have been struck by Augustine's words on\nthe role of the wise judge: given the darkness that surrounds social\nlife,  will the wise man take his seat on the judge's bench,\nor will he not venture to do so? Clearly, he will take his seat; for\nthe claims of human society, which he thinks it wicked to abandon,\nconstrain him and draw him to this duty. (City of God,\n19:6) \nMore's own career can be interpreted as just such a measured response\nto the claims of human society; as his fictional self puts it in\nUtopia, “what you cannot turn to good, you may at least\nmake as little bad as possible” (CU: 97). His political\ninstincts are corporate, something that would have been reinforced by\nhis involvement in the civic government of London, and he is radically\nopposed to any form of absolutism. There are signs of this as early as\nhis 1505 translation of Lucian's Tyrannicida, and it provides\na major theme in his Epigrams, which were printed with\nUtopia in 1518.  Several of the poems deal with the tyrant,\nwhose character is to exploit his subjects (CWM 3:2, nos. 80, 109,\n110, 114, 115, 142), while others define the true king who is\ndedicated to their good (nos. 111, 112, 120). In one oddly apposite\nexample, More compares a courtier who enjoys a prince's favour to\nsomeone playing with tamed lions—“suddenly the fun becomes\nfatal” (no. 162).  More's political beliefs are most clearly\nshown in an epigram which echoes the title of Utopia:\n“What is the best form of the commonwealth” (no. 198);\nhere his preference for a senate over a king is based on its\nrestraining power: a senator is chosen by the people, and any erratic\ntendencies on his part will be held in check by his fellow\nsenators. This is not so much a paean for representative government as\na tentative proposal to curb the darker passions which underlie the\npolitical world. It is just these passions which More dramatizes in\nRichard III, where the stately narrative is persistently\nqualified by the ironic perspective of the narrator. This creates a\nworld of dissimulation and distrust: the only person to act\n“upon the surety of his own conscience” is Lord Rivers,\nand it simply precipitates his death (CWM 2, 18).  Underlying the\naction is the same “ambition and desire of vainglory” (CWM\n2, 12) which More had encountered in the Roman historians and which he\nnow transferred to the England of living memory; from the political\nperspective, Richard III is a work of almost unrelieved\ngloom, and this may well explain its unfinished state. In practice,\nMore's pessimism was qualified by his Augustinian sense of social\nobligation.  \n\nHumanism was founded on the philological ambition to recapture the\nlegacy of classical literature, both by the retrieval of texts and by\nthe imitation of classical style; but, equally, it implied the\nrecognition of language as a persuasive medium, the province of\nrhetoric. The revival of rhetoric is at the core of humanism: in its\npersuasive role, language is directed out to the social community in\nthe effort to stimulate moral or political response. More's most\ndirect statements on the cultural issue of the age occur in four\nletters which he wrote between 1515 and 1519 to Martin Dorp, to\nOxford, to Edward Lee and “to a monk” (all now in CWM\n15). Dorp, a theologian with humanist interests, had expressed\nuneasiness with Erasmus's scurrilous treatment of scholastic theology,\nas well as his presumption in correcting Jerome's Vulgate New\nTestament in light of the Greek text. He also protests at his apparent\nsubordination of the higher faculties, such as theology, to the rule\nof grammarians; for Erasmus, he implies, the worst heresy is\nlinguistic barbarism. More had seen the exchange of letters between\nDorp and Erasmus during his 1515 stay in the Netherlands and\nintervened in defence of his friend.  While Dorp's view of humanism is\nessentially cosmetic, a matter of vocabulary and style, More takes the\nargument to a deeper level. His complaint is about the way dialectic\nhas usurped control of the arts course, the trivium, allowing\nscant attention to grammar and rhetoric. The later scholastics, in\ntheir quest for a meta-language purified of subjective reference, had\nreinvented Latin as a wholly artificial construction closed to\noutsiders. It had ceased to be communicative speech. This tendency is\nthen passed on to theology, where the Scriptures and the Fathers are\nfragmented into proof texts: More describes how his clash with an aged\ntheologian about St Augustine's view on demons arose because he is\nciting the original work, while the theologian has picked up scraps of\nAugustine second-hand from Peter Lombard's Sentences (CWM 15,\n68–9). One work which attracts More's venom is the Parva\nlogicalia (“Little Logicals”), so-called, More\nsuggests, because it has so little logic in it. This is the section of\nPeter of Spain's Summulae logicales devoted to supposition\ntheory and, as such, it formed an integral part of most university\ncourses on dialectic. In Utopia, on the other hand, where\nMore again refers to it, we learn that the natives, for all their\nintelligence, fail to grasp these “elaborate rules about\nrestrictions, amplifications and suppositions” (CU: 157). This\nis because in their reasoning they use customary speech, the language\nof the community, and can make no sense of a technical language which\ndeviates from the order of nature. More is not opposed to dialectic,\nand he probably had experience of the trivium during his stay\nin Oxford, but he wants a return to the dialectic of Aristotle,\nespecially as now made available by humanist scholarship. Both grammar\nand dialectic have their part in communication, grammar by clarifying\nestablished usage and dialectic by clarifying the structure of nature\n(CWM 15, 34–35); they must be integrated with rhetoric in speech\ncomprehensible to all who participate in the language community. The\nquibbles of the logicians, by contrast, exclude those who, like the\nUtopians, have not been initiated into their artificial\nprocedures. \n\nAll this has implications for theology. Taken up with their abstruse\nquestions and writing in a language which More characterizes as\nLatino-Gothic, scholastic theologians have increasingly forfeited\ntheir pastoral relevance. Against this he advocates a\n“positive” theology founded on study of the Scriptures and\nthe Church Fathers; it is a typically humanist return to the sources,\nand it fits with More's conception of the church as a community\nembedded in history and process. As he observes, the church flourished\nfor more than a thousand years until “the Trojan Horse” of\nPeter Lombard's Sentences released its army of arcane\nproblems, and this he sees as the era of the Fathers (among whom he\nwould probably wish to include Thomas Aquinas). In his “Letter\nto Oxford” he describes the true theologian as one who has\ngained a preliminary understanding of human affairs from his study of\npoets, orators and historians, and can add to this a proficiency in\nLatin, Greek and possibly Hebrew. The letter is an endorsement of\nErasmus' efforts to revive classical eloquence and patristic exegesis\nin the service of a theology which can both instruct and inspire. At\nthe centre of this shift lies the issue of Greek studies, which is\nmuch more than a curricular option. When More introduces Raphael, his\nwitness to Utopia, he is described as more at home in Greek than\nLatin: being primarily interested in philosophy he finds little of\nvalue in Latin apart from some works by Cicero and Seneca. The\nUtopians themselves become passionate students of Greek, and for the\nvery same reason. As More reiterates in his aggressive championing of\nthe humanist curriculum, Greek is the essential source both for\nsecular wisdom and for the New Testament.  While he admits translation\nas an aid, it cannot equal the impact of reading—say\nAristotle—in the original (CWM 15,101). As for those critics of\nErasmus who allow the Latin Vulgate a sacrosanct status and regard his\ncorrections from the Greek as unwarranted and even blasphemous, More\ncounters with a pragmatic view of textual reception. The church, whose\nsense of the Gospels precedes any written text, accepts the Greek\noriginal as the true Gospel and may extend its approval to Latin\ntranslations, but never to the extent of ruling out the human\nfallibility of the translator. Even one of the Fathers like Jerome can\nerr (CWM 15, 87, 217), so there is a vital need for philological\nengagement with the sources. From More's perspective, Greek is the key\nelement in a major cultural shift.  One consequence of More's humanism was his advocacy of female\neducation. In Utopian schools all children are introduced to literary\nstudies, and in later life both sexes are free to attend the public\nlectures and pursue intellectual interests. Something of this sort was\na feature in his own household: he established a “school”\nfor his own children and others where the majority may well have been\ngirls. Writing in 1518 to William Gonnell, a protégé of Erasmus who\nwas then in charge of the school, More justifies the idea of educating\nwomen on the grounds of a common human rationality which invites\ncultivation (SL: no. 20). As in Utopia, the basic aim of education is\nnot to prepare for some specific activity or profession but to enhance\nthe possibilities of being human, regardless of gender.  More\nenvisages a curriculum based on literary studies which will develop\nmoral awareness, and he further recommends reading of the Church\nFathers and of the Roman historians, specifically Sallust.  Erasmus,\nan admiring witness of this novelty, reports that the girls all had\nLivy in their hands (CWE 8: Ep. 1233, p. 296), and More's eldest\ndaughter Margaret has been tentatively identified with the Magdalia\nwho champions female education in the colloquy “The Abbot and\nthe Learned Lady” (CWE 39: 499–519). \n\nThe opening of Utopia at once raises a fundamental issue: the\nrelationship between imagination and experience. We encounter real,\nthat is to say historic, persons such as More (or at least his\nfictional self), Tunstall, the Habsburg delegation, and Pieter Gillis;\nbut then we are introduced to Raphael Hythloday, whose fictional\nnature is conveyed by his name (Hythlodaeus, “purveyor of\nnonsense”). This merging of worlds, real and imaginary, prepares\nthe reader for the Platonic tension between two cities—that of\nthe philosopher's birth and the one which he creates with words\n(Republic 592A–B). As Raphael describes his travels,\nGillis is prompted to suggest that he serve some prince. However, this\nwould entail swapping cities, moving from the ideal to the actual, a\ncompromise which Raphael rejects. As it is, he can live as he wishes\n(CU: 51). There is a deliberate echo here of Cicero's discussion of\nthe retired life in his De officiis (I.20.70), and, for that\nmatter, of the argument of Pico della Mirandola which More had earlier\ntranslated. On the one hand, there is the option of intellectual\nliberty, free of external constraints and, on the other, the career of\npublic service, which inevitably demands a degree of accommodation to\nthe status quo. At this point, “More” intervenes\nto urge the latter course: Raphael owes it to himself to use his\ntalents for public benefit, even at some personal inconvenience. The\nstage is set for the debate that follows.  To make his point\nthat by participation in the political world the intellectual risks\neither irrelevance or contamination, Raphael appeals to a series of\nmodels: first, there is the flashback to Cardinal Morton's household\nin 1497, and this is followed by fly-on-the-wall accounts of the\nFrench Council as it debates foreign policy, and of another, which\nremains unidentified but is probably the English Council under Henry\nVII, as it reviews fiscal policy. The odd one out is the Morton\nepisode which may well date from the final stage of More's\ncomposition. In essence, it is about value: the setting of human life\nagainst property. Raphael's intervention raises two key issues: one\nasks what could be an appropriate penalty for theft, while the other\nlooks—with astonishing originality—at the unjust\nconditions which encourage theft. To steal may be a personal moral\nfailing, but social pressures which drive the malefactor to crime must\nshare some of the guilt. More would, in any case, have been familiar\nwith the tradition in canon law which argued that in dire necessity to\ntake what was required to support life was not theft.  Raphael lists\nvarious causes for the prevalence of theft, among them discharged\nsoldiers and cast-off retainers, but his most startling suggestion is\nsheep, which now seem to swallow up people and lay the country waste\n(CU: 63). More is pointing obliquely at the evil of enclosures by\nwhich peasants are driven from the land to make way for the more\nprofitable returns of sheep farming, a clear instance of vested\ninterests acting against the common good. Uprooted and deprived of\nwork, these people have little choice but to steal and to hang as a\nresult. \n\nIn each of the illustrative episodes which More includes in Book 1,\nRaphael appeals to some imaginary land which can provide an\nalternative to the established order. In a sense, these episodes\nprepare us for his account of Utopia. For the Morton sequence, it is\nthe land of the Polylerites (CU: 71), whose ingenious system of penal\nservitude, which may well owe something to Plato's Laws\n(862D), aims to destroy the vices but save the persons, providing in\nthe process reparation for their crimes. In discussing the French\nCouncil, with its focus on aggressive territorial expansion, Raphael\nappeals to the Achorians, who compel their prince to confine himself\nto a single kingdom. Similarly, the English Council is taken up with\ndubious schemes to help the prince augment his wealth, and the\ncounter-example is that of the Macarians, who bind their ruler by oath\nto restrict the sums held in his treasury to a thousand pounds in\ngold, enough to contain rebels or to resist invaders. The two royal\ncouncils are presented with satiric intent, though the policies\nproposed are all too real. However, if we take all three episodes\ntogether, one feature they share is the presence of courtiers. The\nrole of courtiers should be to counsel the prince, but in each episode\nthey are presented as amoral opportunists whose sole aim is to flatter\nhim. Raphael, who seems to overlook the fact that Morton had\nentertained his proposal for penal reform, declares that there is no\nplace for philosophy at court, a claim which leads to one of the most\nimportant exchanges in the book (CU: 95–97). While Raphael\nsimply refers to philosophy, “More” chooses to distinguish\nbetween two modes, scholastica and civilior: the\nfirst, which he associates with Raphael, is best understood as geared\nto academic disputation; the second, by contrast, relates to public\naffairs and civil life. As “More” observes, the first may\nbe valid in formal debate but will fall on deaf ears in the public\narena; the point about his civil philosophy is that it is informed by\nrhetorical values—adapted to its specific context and designed\nto persuade.  Hence, his telling comparison with a stage play: you\ncannot mix comedy with tragedy; Raphael, he implies, is confusing his\ngenres. The counsellor must not abandon ship because he cannot control\nthe winds; instead, he must work obliquely, “by indirect\nmeans”, to handle matters tactfully and minimize the effects of\nunsound policy. It is significant that the case for this rhetorical\napproach is linked in with a passing reference to human imperfection:\nit is inconceivable that all should turn out well, says\n“More”, unless all men become good, “and that I\ndon't expect to see for quite a few years yet” (CU: 96). In a\nperfect world, it seems, rhetoric would be redundant. The argument\nfrom expediency is rejected by Raphael, but his dismissal of all\ncompromise leads him to make the first allusion to the Utopians and\ntheir holding of property in common, a practice he associates with\nPlato. However, his account of the benefits it brings is interrupted\nby “More”, who presents the standard\nAristotelian-scholastic case for private property as both an incentive\nfor productivity and a basis for public authority, an argument which\nhe raises again at the close of Book 2. Yet, meanwhile, so intriguing\nare Raphael's references to the Utopians that he is persuaded to give\na full account of the island. \n\nFor much of its reception-history, Utopia has been treated as\nif it consisted exclusively of Book 2, and this impression was\nsupported by some printed versions which omitted the first book. It\nwas this that gave rise to the misleading adjective\n“Utopian” with its negative connotations of unreal and\nunattainable aspiration.  In Book 2 More sets out to project a society\nwhich is radically different from European society, and he does this\nby drawing on the idea of a state of nature. This idea, sometimes\npresented as the Golden Age, was familiar from classical sources, and\nit also coloured reports of those who had witnessed the native\ncultures of the New World.  Essentially, it imagined a primeval state\nof human association, prior to the invention of property and the laws\nwhich protect it, when all could have access to nature's fruits as\ntheir needs dictated.  Cicero, in De officiis (1.16.51),\nwrites of the bond of rationality which unites humanity and gives a\ncommon right to all that nature has produced. However, confronted by\nthe Roman reality, he adds rather lamely that everything identified by\nstatutes and civil law as private property must remain such; it seems\nthat the primitive rights of the state of nature are now reduced to a\nkind of universal benevolence. More was well aware, too, of Plato's\ndoubts about ownership, and he applies to the whole population of\nUtopia the communality of possessions which Plato reserves for his\nGuardians (Republic 416D-417B). In the Laws, too,\nPlato's “first-best society” attempts to remove all forms\nof ownership from life (739C). The novelty of More's account is that\nit gives us a society which has evolved from a rough and primitive\nmanner of life to “a perfection of culture and humanity as makes\nthem now superior to almost all other mortals” (CU: 111), but it\nhas done so without developing a system of private ownership and the\ninevitable legal safeguards that go with it. It is precisely private\nproperty which defines European society, and along with it goes the\nlegal code governing ownership, largely inherited from ancient\nRome. By making his Utopians adopt a communality of possessions More liberates them\nfrom the passions generated by acquisition and loss; by the same\ntoken, they are relieved of the whole ideological burden which\ndistorts European society.  \n\nIt seems an obvious corollary that in a society where all is common\nmoney should be redundant, since it opens up a gap between\nconventional value, which is socially created, and the worth which\nderives from nature. In Europe this leads to the sort of injustice by\nwhich those in essential tasks are cruelly exploited, while those\nluxury trades which cater to artificial desires flourish. It is this\ndivorce of value from worth in Europe which prompts Raphael to condemn\nwhat he sees as “a conspiracy of the rich, who are advancing\ntheir own interests under the name and title of the\ncommonwealth” (CU: 245). There is a striking contrast between\nthe oligopoly of those sheep traders who profit from enclosures in\nEngland and the Utopians' belief that they are the cultivators\n(agricolae) of their land rather than proprietors\n(domini); it echoes the scholastic distinction between\nusus, simple use, and dominium, the right of\ndisposal which underlies European ideas of property. In Utopia all\nshare in the fruits of the land, and these are distributed freely\nthrough the community; “though no one owns anything, everyone is\nrich” (CU: 241). Whatever is gathered or produced is cycled\nthrough the city markets to meet the requirements of each residential\ngroup, or syphograncy, of thirty households. While the household is\nthe basic unit, each with its own residence, the syphograncy binds\nthem to the wider community; in its spacious hall, the household\nmembers meet daily to have their meals in common and annually to elect\none of their number as syphogrant. This officer represents their\ninterests in the wider affairs of the city and participates in the\nelection of its governor; although the latter may serve for life, the\nconstitution itself is carefully devised to block any shift towards\ntyranny or factional interest. Thus, physical and political needs are\nwell catered for. \n\nHowever, the central principle underlying the Utopians' way of life is\nthat as much time as possible should be reserved for the cultivation\nof the mind, as it is in this that they consider true happiness can be\nfound (CU: 135). This requirement is met by their extraordinary system\nof work in which all citizens, of either sex, (and that could amount\nto about 60,000 in each city) must labour at some essential trade, but\nonly for six hours a day; this more than meets their needs, but still\nleaves ample leisure for intellectual pursuits.  Every child is\ngrounded in the liberal arts, and most of the adult population,\n“men and women alike”, devote themselves to further study\nin their spare time. While there is an elite class of scholars,\ncarefully selected by the priests and approved by the syphogrants, who\ndedicate themselves to full-time study and are available to hold the\nhigher offices, the lectures provided for them are equally open to all\ncomers. There is a vital cultural life, a direct consequence of their\neconomic arrangements. One of the most vivid episodes in\nUtopia is the account of the Anemolian ambassadors: these\ndignitaries, determined to impress the Utopians, deck themselves out\nin conventional finery—cloth of gold, gold chains and rings,\njewelled badges—only to find that the Utopians regard them as\nslaves or fools. This is because of the Utopian value system, which\nuses such impractical metals for shackles or chamber pots: it is an\nessential part of their humanist education to recognize authentic\nvalues, not the pseudo-values imposed by social conspiracy but those\nderiving from nature itself. The fact that they need very few laws\ncomes from the effectiveness of this early formation (CU: 195).  \n\nWhile the Utopians are baffled by scholastic logic, like good\nhumanists they are keenly interested in moral philosophy and the\nnature of the happy life, which is one reason why they are so\ndedicated to learning Greek. Raphael provides an extended account of\ntheir views on pleasure (CU: 159–79), in their view, the most\nimportant ingredient of human happiness. What he describes is, in\neffect, a classical synthesis: while their definition of virtue as a\nlife in accord with nature has Stoic overtones, the emphasis which\nthey lay on pleasure echoes Epicurean teachings. However, seeing that\nthe theory of pleasure they adopt is based on the supremacy of\nspiritual pleasure, there is little in the discussion which might not\nhave originated with Plato.  Certainly, the key to their thinking lies\nin the soul and its destiny; and to the rational arguments of\nphilosophy they join certain religious axioms—that the soul is\nimmortal and that after death it will receive reward for virtues and\npunishment for sins (CU: 161).  Suicide is condemned, but their\ncommitment to pleasure means that euthanasia is practised: there is no\nChristian concept of value in suffering, though those strange\nreligious groups, the Buthrescas, put up with hardship now to win\nhappiness after death (CU: 229). The psychic focus of their beliefs is\none of the factors which makes the monotheistic religion of the\nUtopians into a prisca theologia or primitive anticipation of\nChristianity; and we learn that when they have been introduced to\nChrist's teachings by Raphael and his companions, many of them embrace\nthese eagerly. But, as Raphael points out, conversion is made easier\nfor them by the discovery that Christ had endorsed the communal life\nled by his disciples and that this is still observed in monasteries\n(CU: 221; cf. Mark 6:8–9). The irony needs no comment. \n\nWhat is the reader to make of this newly discovered island and its\nstrange institutions? Raphael's closing peroration places the focus\nback on the social injustices of Europe: he concludes that it is pride\nor “self-pleasing”, identified by Augustine as the root of\nsin (City of God, 14:13), which prevents the adoption of a\nfairer system. And, as “More” had implied in Book 1, pride\nis unlikely to disappear soon; his conclusion is ambivalent. For a\nstart, he rejects Utopian communalism, as it subverts the  nobility, magnificence, splendour and majesty which\n(in the popular view) are the true ornaments and glory of any\ncommonwealth. (CU: 247) \nThis confronts us again with the Aristotelian-scholastic view of\nprivate property as a resource to be used for public benefit, which is\na legitimate argument, but the reference to popular opinion, with its\necho of Plato's cave, is less reassuring. As he leads his guest into\ndinner, “More” does confide that he would be glad to see\nsome Utopian features in his own society, but he is not\nhopeful—his closing verbs, optarim (“I might wish\nfor”) and sperarim (“I might hope for”),\nare subjunctive.  Raphael “s encounter with the ideal has\nalienated him from the familiar world, while “More”\nremains within it but somehow changed. How far can Utopia be imitated? One\nfeature which is often overlooked is its foundation: the entire\npolity, from social organization and street plans to its benign\nreligious toleration, is due to one man, Utopus, whose military\nconquest of the country enabled him, in Plato's terms, to wipe the\nslate clean (CU: 111; Republic 501A). He represents the ideal\nphilosopher-king who reconciles wisdom with power, and this scarcely\nmakes his precedent an easy one to follow. In spite of the common\ntendency to interpret Utopia as a social blue-print, it seems\nmore helpful to view it as a “spiritual exercise”: the\nimaginative engagement with a model which can modify our attitudes and\neven qualify our conduct. This would explain why in his prefatory\nletters to Pieter Gillis and elsewhere, the author More plays with the\ninterface between fiction and reality. It also fits with More's own\npractice of political engagement, while preserving his intellectual\nindependence. \n\nWriting to Erasmus in 1533, More expressed his wish to be grievous to\nheretics, “my increasing experience with these men frightens me\nwith the thought of what the world will suffer at their hands”\n(SL: p.180). His writings in defence of Catholic orthodoxy have limited\nrelevance in a philosophical context, but some observations are in\norder. More's efforts to counter heresy, whether by writing or legal\nprocess, were undertaken as a public duty, and he invariably\nassociates heresy with “malice”, that is with active\nproselytising, rather than the holding of a belief. His career as a\npolemicist began when he was drafted, probably by the Council, to\nanswer Luther's assault on Henry's Assertio, and in 1528 he\nwas enlisted by Tunstall to provide a vernacular response to the\nheretical books illegally shipped in from the Continent. The\nconventions which he inherited saw the detection of heresy as a means\nto restore social unity and inclusion (Forrest 2005: 240), and he\nviewed with dismay what he read as signs of social disintegration in\nthe Peasants' Revolt of 1525 in Germany and the Sack of Rome in 1527\n(CWM 6:1, 369–72, 427–28; 8:1, 56). Like many\nCatholic apologists, he claimed (misguidedly) that Luther's teaching\nof justification by faith alone was a license for immoral conduct. It\nis no surprise, then, that the author of Utopia should defend\northodoxy not as a check-list of doctrines but rather as a culture, an\nall-embracing way of life, along with the attitudes and practices\nwhich that generated. It is a constant in his thinking that individual\nperceptions must be subject to the constraints of collective\nexperience—as with the “old holy doctors and saints”\nwho may err on individual matters but conform themselves, by an act of\nwill, to the consensus of the church as a whole.  \n\nWhen writing in Latin, More could assume a sophisticated and informed\nreadership, able to handle his criticism of contemporary abuses\nwithout drawing false conclusions. However, in an age of expanding\nliteracy, vernacular readers were more exposed to misunderstanding,\nespecially when confronted by conflicting voices.  More's concern\nabout untutored access to controversial texts is made clear in A\nDialogue Concerning Heresies, where he treats the issue of an\nEnglish Bible: he is in favour of one, provided that both translation\nand circulation are controlled by the bishops and that it is handed\nout to those who are “honest, sad and virtuous” and who\nwill read it for purposes of devotion rather than disputation (CWM\n6:1, 341). Like Erasmus, More is unhappy at the thought of letting\nunqualified readers loose on thorny theological issues like free will,\nor indeed on the biblical texts themselves, “meddling with such\nparts as least will agree with their capacities”. In the church,\nGod “will have some readers and some hearers, some teachers and\nsome learners”; even Plato, “the great philosopher”,\nrestricted discussion of the laws to “folk meet therefore and in\nplace convenient” (CWM 6:1, 334). Most arresting of all is\nhis declaration in the Confutation of Tyndale that were\nanyone to translate his earlier Latin writings and Erasmus's\nFolly into English, he would burn the books with his own\nhands, “rather than folk should (though through their own fault)\ntake any harm of them”.  For More, it is an issue of expediency,\nand that reference to translation is revealing: in the current state\nof affairs, when “men by their own default [incapacity]\nmisconstrue and take harm of the very scripture of God”, it is\nthe vulnerability of the vernacular reader that worries him (CWM 8:1,\n177–79). If A Dialogue Concerning Heresies is the\nmost successful of the polemical works, this is because it is not\nwritten as a direct riposte to an opponent but as a dialogue which\nenacts the process of persuasion. In this More, again adopting a\nfictional persona, wins over the youthful Messenger, his interlocutor,\nwhose sincerity is never in doubt but whose anti-intellectual bias and\nself-reliance makes him representative of an evangelical\nreadership. \n\nThe most interesting strand in the polemical works is More's idea of\nthe church, since that connects with an important theme in late\nmedieval thought. Against Luther's sinless church,\n“imperceptible and mathematical like Platonic Ideas” (CWM\n5:1, 167), More presents the church as a mixed community of saints and\nsinners, both “good corn and cockle”, deeply bound up in\nhistorical process. Against Tyndale's “feeling faith”,\ninspired by the Spirit in the heart of the individual, More argues\nthat the Spirit operates through the medium of the church (CWM 8:2,\n752–53). Against the reformers generally, he asserts the\nmaterial insufficiency of Scripture: before the Gospels were ever\nwritten, the Spirit had inscribed Christ's teaching on the hearts of\nthe faithful, and it is within this controlling context that the\nGospels must be read. But More's conception of the church is far from\nbeing a static appeal to tradition, since he sees the Spirit as\nactively engaged within the church till the end of time as its\nfounding doctrines evolve and develop (CWM 6:1, 146–47). This\n“pneumatic” view of the church has implications for its\norganization. More is acutely aware of the church as “the whole\nflock of all Christian people”: in a lively image or\n“suppose”, he pictures a primitive assembly of all\nChristians drawn together on a “fair plain”. Apart from\nthe effort of getting there, they are running short of food, so it is\narranged for the future that representatives should be chosen from\neach part to form a general council, and this council would have the\nsame credence that “the whole Christian people should have if\nthey were all present there, man, women and child” (CWM 8:2,\n937).  More prefers to locate the operation of the Spirit in this\ncorporate body rather than in any specified office: in the\nResponsio he describes how Christ has breathed his Spirit on\nthe Holy Doctors of the Church, each of whom—being\nhuman—may be in error at some time, but when there is consensus\nover a point of doctrine, “in such great numbers through so many\nages”, this may be taken as the voice of the Spirit, who\n“makes those who dwell in a house to be of one mind” (CWM\n5:1, 129). He even emphasises the way in which synods and councils are\nrepresentative of the church as a whole by direct analogy with\nParliament, which “representeth the whole realm” (CWM 8:1,\n146). More might be called a moderate conciliarist; and though his\nrefusal to swear the oath of succession arose from its implicit\nrepudiation of the pope's power of dispensation, he saw that power as\nderiving from the church as the whole people of God. In his view, the\npope might be admonished and even deposed by a council, and he did not\nhesitate to declare this view to Thomas Cromwell (CWM 8:2, 590; SL:\np.214).  Against the more extreme claims of ultra-papal canonists,\nMore's understanding of the pope's office resembles the restrained\nconception of royal authority expressed by English lawyers like Sir\nJohn Fortescue (c. 1395–c. 1477), in which the\ninstitution of the body politic is grounded in the intention of the\npeople. \n\nMore was confined in the Tower of London from April 1534 until his\nexecution on 6 July 1535, and during this period he wrote several\nworks, notably A Dialogue of Comfort and the unfinished Latin\nmeditation De tristitia Christi (“The Sadness of\nChrist”). The letters written at this time to his daughter\nMargaret Roper offer a direct insight into his thoughts, but of\nparticular interest is the letter of Margaret to her step-sister Alice\nAlington (Corr., Letter 206), in which More's voice is\nunmistakeably present. Both the Dialogue and De\ntristitia face the issue of suffering, but they transcend private\nanxiety and are clearly intended for wider circulation. In the\nDialogue More returns to his preferred fictional form,\nsetting it in Hungary, as the elderly Antony and his nephew Vincent\nanticipate persecution in the aftermath of the Ottoman invasion of\ntheir country.  The parallel with More's situation is clear: should\none accommodate or follow conscience? The older man's serene progress\ntowards acceptance of temporary suffering for a higher good is set\nagainst the counterpoint of the younger man's hesitation. Unlike any\nclassical treatment of consolation, More admits the role of grace; but\ngrace still assumes our synergistic response, and this is his primary\nconcern: it is necessary to gather comfort and courage, “and let\nit sink into the heart” (CWM 12, 296). By right\nimagining—a form of internalized rhetoric—an abstract\nargument is transformed into “a habitual, fast, and deep-rooted\npurpose”. A key motif is that of the prison: in an apparent\nallusion to Plato's myth of the cave, More distinguishes between\nactual confinement in a cell, rated as a prison in the opinion of the\ncommon people, and the more philosophical view that the whole earth\nis, in effect, a prison and all its inhabitants under sentence of\ndeath (CWM 12, 269–70). The wise prisoner, however narrowly\nconfined, is free as long as he can quiet his mind and is content to\nbe where he is.  Though More's wife finds his prison claustrophobic,\nthe only difference between his cell and her chamber is that his lock\nis outside, while hers is inside (CWM 12, 277). Given More's\nrelatively lonely stand against royal policy, conscience is a crucial\nterm for him, as it touches on the soundness of his own motives,\nespecially when these are criticized as over-scrupulous; and in the\nbeast fable of Mother Maud he playfully navigates a course between the\nscrupulous conscience and the over-large or elastic conscience (CWM\n12, 114–20). In Letter 206 of the Correspondence,\nattributed to Margaret but clearly based on More's own words,\n“conscience” occurs more than forty times. Margaret, cast\nas Eve, conveys the view of Sir Thomas Audley, More's successor as\nChancellor, that he is driven by “a right simple scruple”:\nwith the exceptions of More and Bishop Fisher, all others have been\ncontent to take the oath. In response, More insists that he acts from\nan informed conscience, one shaped by many years of study and\nreflection. Above all, he acts on his own conscience, and he carefully\ndistinguishes his position even from that of Fisher— “I\nnever intend…to pin my soul to another man's back”. The\nresponsibility must be his alone. While he notes that some of the most\nlearned men who have taken the oath had previously affirmed the\ncontrary, he will not impugn their motives or condemn any other man's\nconscience; but for his own part, he is content “to lose goods,\nland, and life too, rather than swear against my conscience”. It\nwas on the basis of this meticulous self-examination that More went to\nthe scaffold."}]
