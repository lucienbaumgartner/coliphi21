(For details,\nsee Section 1, below.) Given such a paradox, one might be sceptical of\nthe notion of truth, or at least of the prospects of giving a\nscientifically respectable account of truth. \n\n\nAlfred Tarski's great accomplishment was to show how to give —\ncontra this scepticism — a formal definition of truth for a wide\nclass of formalized languages. Tarski did not, however, show\nhow to give a definition of truth for languages (such as\nEnglish) that contain their own truth predicates. He thought\nthat this could not be done, precisely because of the liar's\nparadox. More generally, Tarski reckoned that any language\nwith its own truth predicate would be inconsistent, as long as it\nobeyed the rules of standard classical logic, and had the ability to\nrefer to its own sentences. As we will see in our remarks on Theorem\n2.1 in Section 2.3, Tarski was not quite right: there are consistent\nclassical interpreted languages that refer to their own sentences and\nhave their own truth predicates. (This point originates in Gupta 1982\nand is strengthened in Gupta and Belnap 1993.)\n\n\n Given the close connection between meaning and\ntruth, it is widely held that any semantics for a language\nL, i.e., any theory of meaning for L, will be\nclosely related to a theory of truth for L: indeed, it is\ncommonly held that something like a Tarskian theory of truth for\nL will be a central part of a semantics for L. Thus,\nthe impossibility of giving a Tarskian theory of truth for languages\nwith their own truth predicates threatens the project of giving a\nsemantics for languages with their own truth predicates.\n\n\n\nWe had to wait until the work of Kripke 1975 and of Martin &\nWoodruff 1975 for a systematic formal proposal of a semantics for\nlanguages with their own truth predicates. The basic thought is\nsimple: take the offending sentences, such as (1), to be neither\ntrue nor false. Kripke, in particular, shows how to implement\nthis thought for a wide variety of languages, in effect employing a\nsemantics with three values, true, false and\n neither.[1]\n It is safe to\nsay that Kripkean approaches have replaced Tarskian pessimism as the\nnew orthodoxy concerning languages with their own truth\npredicates.\n\n\n \nOne of the main rivals to the three-valued semantics is the Revision\nTheory of Truth, or RTT, independently conceived by Hans Herzberger\nand Anil Gupta, and first presented in publication in Herzberger 1982a\nand 1982b, Gupta 1982 and Belnap 1982 — the first monographs on\nthe topic are Yaqūb 1993 and the locus classicus, Gupta\n& Belnap 1993. The RTT is designed to model the kind of reasoning\nthat the liar sentence leads to, within a two-valued\ncontext. (See Section 5.2 on the question of whether the RTT is\ngenuinely two-valued.) The central idea is the idea of a revision\nprocess: a process by which we revise hypotheses about\nthe truth-value of one or more sentences. The present article's\npurpose is to outline the Revision Theory of Truth. We proceed as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nLet's take a closer look at the sentence (1), given above: \n\nIt will be useful to make the paradoxical reasoning explicit. First,\nsuppose that  \n\nIt seems an intuitive principle concerning truth that, for any\nsentence p, we have the so-called T-biconditional \n\n(Here we are using ‘iff’ as an abbreviation for ‘if\nand only if’.) In particular, we should have  \n\nThus, from (2) and (4), we get  \n\nThen we can apply the identity,\n \n\nto conclude that (1) is true. This all shows that if (1) is not true,\nthen (1) is true. Similarly, we can also argue that if (1) is true\nthen (1) is not true. So (1) seems to be both true and not true: hence\nthe paradox. As stated above, the three-valued approach to the paradox\ntakes the liar sentence, (1), to be neither true nor false. Exactly\nhow, or even whether, this move blocks the above reasoning is a matter\nfor debate.  \nThe RTT is not designed to block reasoning of the above\nkind, but to model it-or most of\n it.[2]\n As stated above,\nthe central idea is the idea of a revision process: a process\nby which we revise hypotheses about the truth-value of one or\nmore sentences. \n Consider the reasoning regarding the liar sentence, (1)\nabove. Suppose that we hypothesize that (1) is not true. Then,\nwith an application of the relevant T-biconditional, we might revise\nour hypothesis as follows: \nWe could continue the revision process, by revising our hypothesis once\nagain, as follows:\n \n\nAs the revision process continues, we flip back and forth between\ntaking the liar sentence to be true and not true. \n\nInformally, we might reason as follows. Either (7) is true or (7) is\nnot true. Thus, either (8) is true or (9) is true. Thus, (7) is true.\nThus (8) is true and (9) is not true, and (7) is still true. Iterating\nthe process once again, we get (8) is true, (9) is not\ntrue, and (7) is true. More formally, consider any initial hypothesis,\nh0, about the truth values of (7), (8) and\n(9). Either h0 says that (7) is true or\nh0 says that (7) is not true. In either case, we\ncan use the T-biconditional to generate our revised hypothesis\nh1: if h0 says that (7) is\ntrue, then h1 says that ‘(7) is true’\nis true, i.e. that (8) is true; and if h0 says\nthat (7) is not true, then h1 says that ‘(7) is\nnot true’ is true, i.e. that (9) is true. So\nh1 says that either (8) is true or (9) is true. So\nh2 says that ‘(8) is true or (9) is\ntrue’ is true. In other words, h2 says that\n(7) is true. So no matter what hypothesis h0 we\nstart with, two iterations of the revision process lead to a\nhypothesis that (7) is true. Similarly, three or more\niterations of the revision process, lead to the hypothesis that (7) is\ntrue, (8) is true and (9) is not true — regardless of our initial\nhypothesis. In Section 3, we will reconsider this example in a more\nformal context.  \n\n One thing to note is that, in Example 1.1, the revision process\nyields stable truth values for all three sentences. The\nnotion of a sentence stably true in all revision sequences\nwill be a central notion for the RTT. The revision-theoretic treatment\ncontrasts, in this case, with the three-valued approach: on most ways\nof implementing the three-valued idea, all three sentences, (7), (8)\nand (9), turn out to be neither true nor\n false.[3]\n In this case, the\nRTT arguably better captures the correct informal reasoning than does\nthe three-valued approach: the RTT assigns to the sentences (7), (8)\nand (9) the truth-values that were assigned to them by the informal\nreasoning given at the beginning of the example.  \n\nThe goal of the RTT is not to give a paradox-free account of\ntruth. Rather, the goal of the RTT is to give an account of our often\nunstable and often paradoxical reasoning about truth. RTT seeks, more\nspecifically, to give a a two-valued account that assigns stable\nclassical truth values to sentences when intuitive reasoning would\nassign stable classical truth values. We will present a formal\nsemantics for a formal language: we want that language to have both a\ntruth predicate and the resources to refer to its own sentences.   \n\nLet us consider a first-order language L, with connective\n&, ∨, and ¬, quantifiers ∀ and ∃, the equals sign =,\nvariables, and some stock of names, function symbols and relation\nsymbols. We will say that L is a truth language, if\nit has a distinguished predicate T and\nquotation marks ‘ and ’, which will be used to form\nquote names: if A is a sentence of L, then\n‘A’ is a name. Let SentL\n= {A : A is a sentence of L}. \n\nIt will be useful to identify the T-free fragment of a truth language L: the first-order language L− that has the same names, function symbols and relation symbols as L, except the unary predicate T. Since L− has the same names as L, including the same quote names, L− will have a quote name ‘A’ for every sentence A of\nL. Thus ∀xTx is not a sentence of L−, but ‘∀xTx’ is a name of L− and ∀x(x = ‘∀xTx’) is a sentence of L−.\n \n\nOther than the truth predicate, we will assume that our language is interpreted classically. More precisely, let a ground model for L  be a\nclassical model M = <D, I > for L−, the T-free fragment of L, satisfying\nthe following:  \n\nClauses (1) and (2) simply specify what it is for M to be a\nclassical model of the T-free fragment of\nL. Clauses (3) and (4) ensure that L, when\ninterpreted, can talk about its own sentences.  Given a ground model, we will consider the prospects of providing a satisfying interpretation of T. The most obvious desideratum is that the ground model, expanded to include an interpretation of T, satisfy Tarski's T-biconditionals, i.e., the biconditionals of the form \n\nfor each A ∈ SentL. \n\nSome useful terminology: Given a ground model M\nfor L and a name, function symbol or relation\nsymbol X, we can think of I(X) as the\ninterpretation or, to borrow a term from Gupta and Belnap,\nthe signification of X.  Gupta and Belnap\ncharacterize an expression's or concept's signification in a\nworld w as “an abstract something that carries all the\ninformation about all the expression's [or concept's] extensional\nrelations in w.” If we want to\ninterpret Tx as ‘x\nis true’, then, given a ground model M, we would like\nto find an appropriate signification, or an appropriate range of\nsignifications, for T.  \n\nWe might try to assign to T\na classical signification, by expanding M to a\nclassical model M′ =\n<D′, I′ > for all of\nL, including T. Also recall that we want\nM′ to satisfy the T-biconditionals: for our immediate\npurposes, let us interpret these classically. Let us say that an\nexpansion M′ of a ground model M\nis Tarskian iff M′ is a classical model and\nall of the T-biconditionals, interpreted classically, are true\nin M′. We would like to expand ground models to\nTarskian models. We consider three ground models in order to assess\nour prospects for doing this. \n\nTheorem 2.1 \n(1) M1 can be expanded to exactly one Tarskian model: in this model, the sentences (Tβ \n ∨\n Tγ) and Tα are true, while the sentence ¬Tα is false.\n(2) M2 can be expanded to exactly two Tarskian models, in one of which the sentence Tτ is true and in the other of which the sentence Tτ is false.\n(3) M3 cannot be expanded to a Tarskian model.\n \nThe proofs of (1) and (2) are beyond the scope of this article, but some remarks are in order. \n Re (1): The fact that M1 can be expanded to a Tarskian model is not surprising, given the reasoning in Example 1.1, above: any initial hypothesis about the truth values of the three sentences in question leads, after three iterations of the revision process, to a stable hypothesis that (Tβ \n ∨\n Tγ) and Tα are true, while ¬Tα is false.\nThe fact that M1 can be expanded to exactly one Tarskian model needs the so-called Transfer Theorem, Gupta and Belnap 1993, Theorem 2D.4.  \nRemark: In the introductory remarks, above, we claim that there are consistent classical interpreted languages that refer to their own sentences and have their own truth predicates.  Clauses (1) of Theorem 2.1 delivers an example. Let M1′ be the unique Tarskian expansion of M1. Then the language L1, interpreted by M1′ is an interpreted language that has its own truth predicate satisfying the T-biconditionals classically understood, obeys the rules of standard classical logic, and has the ability to refer to each of its own sentences. Thus Tarski was not quite right in his view that any language with its own truth predicate would be inconsistent, as long as it obeyed the rules of standard classical logic, and had the ability to refer to its own sentences.  \n\nRe (2): The only potential problematic self-reference is in the sentence Tτ, the so-called truth teller, which says of itself that it is true. Informal reasoning suggests that the truth teller can consistently be assigned either classical truth value: if you assign it the value t then no paradox is produced, since the sentence now truly says of itself that it is true; and if you assign it the value f then no paradox is produced, since the sentence now falsely says of itself that it is true. Theorem 2.1 (2) formalizes this point, i.e., M2 can be expanded to one Tarskian model in which Tτ is true and one in which Tτ is false. The fact that M2 can be expanded to exactly two Tarskian models needs the Transfer Theorem, alluded to above. Note that the language L2, interpreted by either of these expansions, provides another example of an interpreted language that has its own truth predicate satisfying the T-biconditionals classically understood, obeys the rules of standard classical logic, and has the ability to refer to each of its own sentences.  \n\nProof of (3). Suppose that M3′ = <D3, I3′ > is a classical expansion of M3 to all of L3.  Since M3′ is an expansion of M3, I3 and I3′ agree on all the names of L3. So \n\nSo the sentences Tλ and\nT ‘¬Tλ’\nhave the same truth value in M3′. So the\nT-biconditional \n\nis false in M3′. \nRemark: The language L3 interpreted by the ground model M3 formalizes the liar's paradox, with the sentence ¬Tλ as the offending liar's sentence. Thus, despite Theorem 2.1, Clauses (1) and (2), Clause (3) strongly suggests that in a semantics for languages capable of expressing their own truth concepts, T cannot, in general, have a classical signification; and the ‘iff’ in the T-biconditionals will not be read as the classical biconditional. We take these suggestions up in Section 4, below. \n\n In Section 1, we informally sketched the central thought of the\nRTT, namely, that we can use the T-biconditionals to generate a\nrevision rule — a rule for revising a hypothesis about the\nextension of the truth predicate. Here we will formalize this notion,\nand work through an example from Section 1.  \n \nIn general, let L be a truth language and M be a ground model\nfor L. An hypothesis is a function\nh : D → {t,\nf}. A hypothesis will in effect be a hypothesized\nclassical interpretation for T. Let's work\nwith an example that combines Examples 2.1 and 2.3. We will state the\nexample formally, but reason in a semiformal way, to transition from\none hypothesized extension of\nT to another.  \nIt will be convenient to let\n \nThus:\n  \n\nSuppose that the hypothesis h0 hypothesizes that\nA is false, B is true, C is false and\nX is true. Thus \n\nNow we will engage in some semiformal reasoning, on the basis of\nhypothesis h0. Among the four sentences,\nA, B, C and X,\nh0 puts only B in the extension of\nT. Thus, reasoning from\nh0, we conclude that \n\nThe T-biconditional for the four sentence A, B,\nC and X are as follows:  \n\nThus, reasoning from h0, we conclude that\n \n\nThis produces our new hypothesis h1:\n  \n\nLet's revise our hypothesis once again. So now we will engage in some\nsemiformal reasoning, on the basis of hypothesis\nh1. Hypothesis h1 puts\nA, C and X, but not B, in the\nextension of the T. Thus, reasoning from\nh1, we conclude that  \n\nRecall the T-biconditional for the four sentence A,\nB, C and X, given above. Reasoning from\nh1 and these T-biconditionals, we conclude\nthat \n\nThis produces our new new hypothesis h2:\n \n\n□ \n\nLet's formalize the semiformal reasoning carried out in Example\n3.1. First we hypothesized that certain sentences were, or were not,\nin the extension of T. Consider ordinary\nclassical model theory. Suppose that our language has a predicate\nG and a name a, and that we have a model M\n= <D, I > which places the\nreferent of a inside the extension of G: \n\nThen we conclude, classically, that the sentence Ga is true\nin M. It will be useful to have some notation for the\nclassical truth value of a sentence S in a classical model\nM. We will write\nValM(S). In this case,\nValM(Ga) =\nt. In Example 3.1, we did not start with a classical\nmodel of the whole language L, but only a classical model of\nthe T-free fragment of L. But then\nwe added a hypothesis, in order to get a classical model of all of\nL. Let's use the notation M + h for the\nclassical model of all of L that you get when you extend\nM by assigning T an extension via\nthe hypothesis h. Once you have assigned an extension to the\npredicate T, you can calculate the truth\nvalues of the various sentences of L. That is, for each\nsentence S of L, we can calculate \n\nIn Example 3.1, we started with hypothesis h0 as follows:\n \nThen we calculated as follows:\n \nAnd then we concluded as follows:\n \nThese conclusions generated our new hypothesis, h1:\n \nNote that, in general,\n \n\nWe are now prepared to define the revision rule given by a\nground model M = <D, I >. In general,\ngiven an hypothesis h, let M + h =\n<D, I′ > be the model of L which\nagrees with M on the T-free\nfragment of L, and which is such that\nI′(T) = h. So\nM + h is just a classical model for all of\nL. For any model M + h of all of L\nand any sentence A if L, let\nValM+h(A) be the ordinary\nclassical truth value of A in M + h.   \n\nThe ‘otherwise’ clause tells us that if d is not\na sentence of L, then, after one application of revision, we\nstick with the hypothesis that d is not\n true.[5]\n Note that, in Example 3.1, h1 =\nτM(h0) and\nh2 =\nτM(h1). We will often drop\nthe subscripted ‘M’ when the context make it\nclear which ground model is at issue. \n\nLet's pick up Example 3.1 and see what happens when we iterate the\napplication of the revision rule.  \n\nThe following table indicates what happens with repeated applications\nof the revision rule τM to the hypothesis\nh0 from Example 3.1. In this table, we will write\nτ instead of τM: \n\nSo h0 generates a revision sequence (see\nDefinition 3.7, below). And A and B are stably\ntrue in that revision sequence (see Definition 3.6, below), while\nC is stably false.  The liar sentence X is,\nunsurprisingly, neither stably true nor stably false: the liar\nsentence is unstable. A similar calculation would show that\nA is stably true, regardless of the initial hypothesis: thus\nA is categorically true (see Definition 3.8). \n\nBefore giving a precise definition of a revision sequence, we\ngive an example where we would want to carry the revision process\nbeyond the finite stages, h, τ1(h),\nτ2(h), τ3(h), and so\non. \n More formally, let A0 be the sentence\n Tα0\n ∨\n ¬Tα0,\n and for each n ≥ 0, let An+1\n be the sentence\n Tαn. Thus\n A1 is the sentence\n Tα0, and\n A2 is the sentence\n Tα1, and\n A3 is the sentence\n Tα2, and so on. Our\n ground model M =\n <D, I > is as follows: \nThus, the extension of G is the following set of sentences:\n{A0, A1,\nA2, A3, … } =\n{(Tα0\n ∨\n ¬Tα0),\n Tα0, \n Ta1,\n Ta2,\n Ta3,\n… }. Finally let B be the sentence\n ∀x(Gx ⊃\nTx). Let h be any\n hypothesis for which we have, for\n each natural number n, \n The following table indicates what happens with repeated applications\nof the revision rule τM to the hypothesis\nh. In this table, we will write τ instead of\nτM: \n \nAt the 0th stage, each An is\noutside the hypothesized extension of T. But\nfrom the nth stage onwards,\nAn is in the hypothesized\nextension of T. So, for each n, the\nsentence An is eventually stably\nhypothesized to be true.  Despite this, there is no finite\nstage at which all the An's are\nhypothesized to be true: as a result the sentence B = \n ∀x(Gx ⊃\n Tx)\n remains false at each finite stage. This\nsuggests extending the process as follows:  \n\nThus, if we allow the revision process to proceed beyond the finite\nstages, then the sentence B = \n ∀x(Gx ⊃\n Tx) is stably true from the \nω+1st stage onwards. □ \n In Example 3.4, the intuitive verdict is that not only should each\nAn receive a stable truth value of\nt, but so should the sentence B =\n∀x(Gx ⊃\nTx). The only way to ensure this is\nto carry the revision process beyond the finite stages. So we will\nconsider revision sequences that are very long: not only will a\nrevision sequence have a nth stage for each finite\nnumber n, but a ηth stage for every\nordinal number η. (The next paragraph is to help the\nreader unfamiliar with ordinal numbers.) \n\n One way to think of the ordinal\nnumbers is as follows. Start with the finite natural numbers: \n\n Add a number, ω, greater than all of these but not the\n immediate successor of any of them:  \n And then take the successor of ω, its successor,\nand so on: \n Then add a number ω+ω, or ω×2, greater than\nall of these (and again, not the immediate successor of any), and\nstart over, reiterating this process over and over: \nAt the end of this, we add an ordinal number ω×ω or\nω2: \n The ordinal numbers have the following structure: every ordinal\nnumber has an immediate successor known as a successor\nordinal; and for any infinitely ascending sequence of ordinal\nnumbers, there is a limit ordinal which is greater than all\nthe members of the sequence and which is not the immediate successor\nof any member of the sequence. Thus the following are successor\nordinals: 5, 178, ω+12, (ω×5)+56,\nω2+8; and the following are limit ordinals: ω,\nω×2, ω2, (ω2+ω),\netc. Given a limit ordinal η, a sequence S of objects is\nan η-long sequence if there is an object\nSδ for every ordinal δ < η. We\nwill denote the class of ordinals as\n On.\n  Any sequence S of objects is an\n On-long\n sequence if there is an object Sδ for every\nordinal δ.  \n\nWhen assessing whether a sentence receives a\nstable truth value, the RTT considers sequences of hypotheses of\nlength\n On.\n So suppose that S is an \n On-long\n  sequence of hypotheses, and let ζ and η range over\nordinals. Clearly, in order for S to represent the revision\nprocess, we need the ζ+1st hypothesis to be generated\nfrom the ζth hypothesis by the revision rule. So we\ninsist that Sζ+1 =\nτM(Sζ). But what\nshould we do at a limit stage? That is, how should we set\nSη(δ) when η is a limit ordinal?\nClearly any object that is stably true [false] up to that\nstage should be true [false] at that stage. Thus consider\nExample 3.2. The sentence A2, for example, is true\nup to the ωth stage; so we set A2\nto be true at the ωth stage. For objects\nthat do not stabilize up to that stage, Gupta and Belnap 1993 adopt a\nliberal policy: when constructing a revision sequence S, if\nthe value of the object d ∈ D has not\nstabilized by the time you get to the limit stage η, then you can\nset Sη(δ) to be whichever of\nt or f you like. Before we give the\nprecise definition of a revision sequence, we continue with\nExample 3.3 to see an application of this idea.   \n\nThe following table indicates what happens with repeated applications\nof the revision rule τM to the hypothesis\nh0 from Example 3.1. For each ordinal η, we\nwill indicate the ηth hypothesis by\nSη (suppressing the index M on\nτ). Thus S0 = h0,\nS1 = τ(h0),\nS2 = τ2(h0),\nS3 = τ3(h0),\nand Sω, the ωth hypothesis,\nis determined in some way from the hypotheses leading up to it. So,\nstarting with h0 from Example 3.3, our revision\nsequence begins as follows:  \n What happens at the ωth stage? A and\nB are stably true up to the ωth\nstage, and C is stably false up to the\nωth stage. So at the ωth\nstage, we must have the following: \n\nBut the entry for Sω(X) can be\neither t or f. In other words, the\ninitial hypothesis h0 generates at least two\nrevision sequences. Every revision sequence S that has\nh0 as its initial hypothesis must have\nSω(A) = t,\nSω(B) = t, and\nSω(C) = f. But there is\nsome revision sequence S, with h0 as its\ninitial hypothesis, and with Sω(X)\n= t; and there is some revision sequence\nS′, with h0 as its initial\nhypothesis, and with Sω′(X) =\nf. □ \n We are now ready to define the notion of a revision\nsequence:  \n Suppose that S is a η-long sequence of hypothesis for\nsome limit ordinal η. Then we say that d ∈\nD is stably t [f]\nin S iff for some ordinal θ < η we have \n\nIf S is an \n On-long\n sequence of hypotheses and η is a limit ordinal, then\nS|η is the initial segment of S up to\nbut not including η. Note that S|η is a\nη-long sequence of hypotheses.   \n\nWe now illustrate these concepts with an example. The example will also\nillustrate a new concept to be defined afterwards.  \n\nLet A0 be the sentence ∃x(Gx\n & ¬Tx). And for each\nn ≥ 0, let An+1 be the\nsentence Tαn.\nConsider the following ground model M =\n<D, I >  \n\nThus, the extension of G is the following set of sentences:\n {A0, A1,\nA2, A3, … } =\n{Tα0,\nTα1,\nT α2,\nTα3, … }. Let\nh be any hypothesis for which we have, h(B)\n= f and for each natural number n, \n And let S be a revision sequence whose initial hypothesis is\nh, i.e., S0 = h. The following\ntable indicates some of the values of\nSγ(C), for sentences C\n∈ {B, A0, A1,\nA2, A3, … }. In the top\nrow, we indicate only the ordinal number representing the stage in the\nrevision process.   \n\nIt is worth contrasting the behaviour of the sentence B and the\nsentence A0. From the ω+1st stage\non, B is stabilizes as true. In fact, B is stably\ntrue in every revision sequence for M. Thus, B is\ncategorically true in M. The sentence A0,\nhowever, never quite stabilizes: it is usually true, but within a few\nfinite stages of a limit ordinal, the sentence A0\ncan be false. In these circumstances, we say that\nA0 is nearly stably true (See Definition\n3.10, below.) In fact, A0 is nearly stably true in\nevery revision sequence for M. □  \n\nExample 3.9 illustrates not only the notion of stability in a revision\nsequence, but also of near stability, which we define now:  \n\nGupta and Belnap 1993 characterize the difference between stability\nand near stability as follows: “Stability simpliciter\nrequires an element [in our case a sentence] to settle down to a value\nx [in our case a truth value] after some initial\nfluctuations say up to [an ordinal η]… In contrast, near\nstability allows fluctuations after η also, but these fluctuations\nmust be confined to finite regions just after limit\nordinals” (p. 169). Gupta and Belnap 1993 introduce two theories of\ntruth, T* and\nT#, based on stability and near\nstability. Theorems 3.12 and 3.13, below, illustrate an advantage of\nthe system T#, i.e., the system\nbased on near stability.  \n\nTheorem 3.12 \n Suppose that L is a truth language, and that M =\n<D, I > is a ground model. Then,\nfor every sentence A of L, the following is valid in\nM by T#: \n\nTheorem 3.13 \n There is a truth language L and a ground model M =\n<D, I > and a sentence\nA of L such that the following is not valid\nin M by T*: \n\nGupta and Belnap 1993, Section 6C, note similar advantages of\nT# over\nT*. For example,\nT# does, but\nT* does not, validate the\nfollowing semantic principles:  \n T ‘A \n ∨\n   B’ ≡\nT ‘A’ \n ∨\n   T ‘B’ \n \n Gupta and Belnap remain noncommittal about which of\nT# and\nT* (and a further alternative\nthat they define, Tc) is\npreferable. \n\n The main formal notions of the RTT are the notion of a revision\nrule (Definition 3.2), i.e., a rule for revising hypotheses; and a\nrevision sequence (Definition 3.7), a sequence of hypotheses\ngenerated in accordance with the appropriate revision rule. Using\nthese notions, we can, given a ground model, specify when a sentence\nis stably, or nearly stably, true or false in a particular\nrevision sequence. Thus we could define two theories of truth,\nT* and\nT#, based on stability and near\nstability.  The final idea is that each of these theories delivers a\nverdict on which sentences of the language are categorically\nassertible, given a ground model.  \n\nNote that we could use revision-theoretic notions to make rather\nfine-grained distinctions among sentences: Some sentences are unstable\nin every revision sequence; others are stable in every revision\nsequence, though stably true in some and stably false in others; and\nso on. Thus, we can use revision-theoretic ideas to give a\nfine-grained analysis of the status of various sentences, and of the\nrelationships of various sentences to one another. \n\n Recall the suggestion made at the end of Section 2: \n\nGupta and Belnap fill out these suggestions in the following way.  \n\n First, they suggest that the signification of\nT, given a ground model M, is the\nrevision rule τM itself. As noted in the\npreceding paragraph, we can give a fine-grained analysis of sentences'\nstatuses and interrelations on the basis of notions generated directly\nand naturally from the revision rule τM. Thus,\nτM is a good candidate for the signification\nof T, since it does seem to be “an abstract\nsomething that carries all the information about all [of\nT's] extensional relations” in\nM. (See Gupta and Belnap's characterization of an\nexpression's signification, given in Section 2, above.)  \n\nGupta and Belnap's related suggestion concerning the ‘iff’\nin the T-biconditionals is that, rather than being the classical\nbiconditional, this ‘iff’ is the distinctive biconditional\nused to define a previously undefined concept. In 1993, Gupta\nand Belnap present the revision theory of truth as a special case of a\nrevision theory of circularly defined concepts. Suppose that\nL is a language with a unary predicate F and a\nbinary predicate R. Consider a new concept expressed by a\npredicate G, introduced through a definition like this: \n\nSuppose that we start with a domain of discourse, D, and an\ninterpretation of the predicate F and the relation symbol\nR. Gupta and Belnap's revision-theoretic treatment of\nconcepts thus circularly introduced allows one to give categorical\nverdicts, for certain d ∈ D about whether or\nnot d satisfies G. Other objects will be unstable\nrelative to G: we will be able categorically to assert\nneither that d satisfies G nor that d does not\nsatisfy G. In the case of truth, Gupta and Belnap take the\nset of T-biconditionals of the form \n\ntogether to give the definition of the concept of truth. It is their\ntreatment of ‘=df’ (the\n‘iff’ of definitional concept introduction), together with\nthe T-biconditionals of the form (10), that determine the revision\nrule τM.   \n\nRecall the liar sentence, (1), from the beginning of this article: \n In Section 1, we claimed that the RTT is designed to model, rather\nthan block, the kind of paradoxical reasoning regarding (1). But we\nnoted in footnote 2 that the RTT does avoid contradictions in these\nsituations. There are two ways to see this.  First, while the RTT does\nendorse the biconditional \n the relevant ‘iff’ is not the material biconditional, as\nexplained above. Thus, it does not follow that both (1) is true and\n(1) is not true. Second, note that on no hypothesis can we conclude\nthat both (1) is true and (1) is not true. If we keep it firmly in\nmind that revision-theoretical reasoning is hypothetical rather than\ncategorical, then we will not infer any contradictions from the\nexistence of a sentence such as (1), above. \n\nGupta and Belnap's suggestions, concerning the signification of\nT and the interpretation of the\n‘iff’ in the T-biconditionals, dovetail nicely with two\nclosely related intuitions articulated in Gupta & Belnap 1993. The\nfirst intuition, loosely expressed, is “that the T-biconditionals are\nanalytic and fix the meaning of ‘true’” (p. 6).\nMore tightly expressed, it becomes the “Signification Thesis” (p. 31):\n“The T-biconditionals fix the signification of truth in every world\n[where a world is represented by a ground\n model].”[6]\n Given the revision-theoretic treatment of the definition\n‘iff’, and given a ground model M, the T-biconditionals\n(10) do, as noted, fix the suggested signification of\nT, i.e., the revision rule\nτM. \n\nThe second intuition is the supervenience of the signification of\ntruth. This is a descendant of M. Kremer's 1988 proposed\nsupervenience of semantics. The idea is simple: which\nsentences fall under the concept truth should be fixed by (1)\nthe interpretation of the nonsemantic vocabulary, and (2) the\nempirical facts. In non-circular cases, this intuition is particularly\nstrong: the standard interpretation of “snow” and “white” and the\nempirical fact that snow is white, are enough to determine that the\nsentence “snow is white” falls under the concept truth. The\nsupervenience of the signification of truth is the thesis that the\nsignification of truth, whatever it is, is fixed by the ground model\nM. Clearly, the RTT satisfies this principle.  \n\nIt is worth seeing how a theory of truth might violate this\nprinciple. Consider the truth-teller sentence, i.e., the sentence that\nsays of itself that it is true: \n\nAs noted above, Kripke's three-valued semantics allows three truth\nvalues, true (t), false (f), and\nneither (n). Given a ground model M = \n <D, I > for a truth\nlanguage L, the candidate interpretations of\nT are three-valued interpretations, i.e.,\nfunctions h : D →\n{ t, f,\nn }. Given a three-valued interpretation of\nT, and a scheme for evaluating the truth\nvalue of composite sentences in terms of their parts, we can specify a\ntruth value ValM+h(A) =\nt, f or n, for\nevery sentence A of L. The central theorem of the\nthree-valued semantics is that, given any ground model M,\nthere is a three-valued interpretation h of\nT so that, for every sentence A, we\nhave\nValM+h(T ‘A’)\n =\n ValM+h(A).[7]\n We will call such an interpretation of T an\nacceptable interpretation. Our point here is this: if there's\na truth-teller, as in (11), then there is not only one acceptable\ninterpretation of T; there are three: one\naccording to which (11) is true, one according to which (11) is false,\nand one according to which (11) is neither. Thus, there is no single\n“correct” interpretation of T given a ground\nmodel M. Thus the three-valued semantics seems to violate the\nsupervenience of\n semantics.[8] \n\n The RTT does not assign a truth value to the truth-teller,\n(11). Rather, it gives an analysis of the kind of reasoning that one\nmight engage in with respect to the truth-teller: If we start with a\nhypothesis h according to which (11) is true, then upon\nrevision (11) remains true. And if we start with a hypothesis\nh according to which (11) is not true, then upon revision\n(11) remains not true. And that is all that the concept of truth\nleaves us with. Given this behaviour of (11), the RTT tells us that\n(11) is neither categorically true nor categorically false, but this\nis quite different from a verdict that (11) is neither true nor\nfalse.  \n\nWe note an alternative interpretation of the revision-theoretic\nformalism. Yaqūb 1993 agrees with Gupta and Belnap that the\nT-biconditionals are definitional rather than material biconditionals,\nand that the concept of truth is therefore circular. But Yaqūb\ninterprets this circularity in a distinctive way. He argues that, \n Like Gupta and Belnap, Yaqūb posits no privileged extension for\nT. And like Gupta and Belnap, he sees the\nrevision sequences of extensions of T, each\nsequence generated by an initial hypothesized extension, as “capable\nof accommodating (and diagnosing) the various kinds of problematic and\nunproblematic sentences of the languages under consideration” (1993,\n41).  But, unlike Gupta and Belnap, he concludes from these\nconsiderations that “truth in a bivalent language is not\nsupervenient” (1993, 39). He explains in a footnote: for truth to\nbe supervenient, the truth status of each sentence must be “fully\ndetermined by nonsemantical facts”. Yaqūb does not explicitly\nuse the notion of a concept's signification. But Yaqūb\nseems committed to the claim that the signification of\nT — i.e., that which determines the\ntruth status of each sentence — is given by a particular\nrevision sequence itself. And no revision sequence is determined by\nthe nonsemantical facts, i.e., by the ground model, alone: a revision\nsequence is determined, at best, by a ground model and an initial\n hypothesis.[9] \n\nWe have given only the barest exposition of the three-valued\nsemantics, in our discussion of the supervenience of the signification\nof truth, above. Given a truth language L and a ground model\nM, we defined an acceptable three-valued\ninterpretation of T as an interpretation \n h : D →\n{ t, f,\nn } such that\nValM+h(T‘A’)\n= ValM+h(A) for each\nsentence A of L. In general, given a ground model\nM, there are many acceptable interpretations of\nT. Suppose that each of these is indeed a\ntruly acceptable interpretation. Then the three-valued semantics\nviolates the supervenience of the signification of\nT.  \n\n Suppose, on the other hand, that, for each ground model M,\nwe can isolate a privileged acceptable interpretation as the\ncorrect interpretation of T. Gupta and\nBelnap present a number of considerations against the three-valued\nsemantics, so conceived. (See Gupta & Belnap 1993, Chapter 3.) One\nprincipal argument is that the central theorem, i.e., that for each\nground model there is an acceptable interpretation, only holds when\nthe underlying language is expressively impoverished in certain ways:\nfor example, the three-valued approach fails if the language has a\nconnective ~ with the following truth table:  \nThe only negation operator that the three-valued approach can handle\nhas the following truth table: \n\nBut consider the liar that says of itself that it is ‘not’\ntrue, in this latter sense of ‘not’. Gupta and Belnap urge\nthe claim that this sentence “ceases to be intuitively paradoxical”\n(1993, 100). The claimed advantage of the RTT is its ability to describe\nthe behaviour of genuinely paradoxical sentences: the genuine liar is\nunstable under semantic evaluation: “No matter what we hypothesize its\nvalue to be, semantic evaluation refutes our hypothesis.” The\nthree-valued semantics can only handle the “weak liar”, i.e., a\nsentence that only weakly negates itself, but that is not guaranteed\nto be paradoxical: “There are appearances of the liar here, but they\ndeceive.” \n \n\nWe've thus far reviewed two of Gupta and Belnap's complaints against\nthree-valued approaches, and now we raise a third: in the\nthree-valued theories, truth typically behaves like a nonclassical\nconcept even when there’s no vicious reference in the\nlanguage. Without defining terms here, we note that one popular\nprecisification of the three-valued approach, is to take the correct\ninterpretation of T to be that given by the ‘least fixed\npoint’ of the ‘strong Kleene scheme’: putting aside\ndetails, this interpretation always assigns the truth value n to the\nsentence ∀x(Tx ∨\n¬Tx), even when the ground model allows\nno circular, let alone vicious, reference. Gupta and Belnap claim an\nadvantage for the RTT: according to revision-theoretic approach, they\nclaim, truth always behaves like a classical concept when there is no\nvicious reference. \n\nKremer 2010 challenges this claim by precisifying it as a formal claim\nagainst which particular revision theories\n(e.g. T*\nor T#, see Definition 3.11,\nabove) and particular three-valued theories can be tested. As it turns\nout, on many three-valued theories, truth does in fact behave like a\nclassical concept when there's no vicious reference: for\nexample, the least fixed point of a natural variant of the\nsupervaluation scheme always assigns T a\nclassical interpretation in the absence of vicious reference. Granted,\ntruth behaves like a classical concept when there’s no vicious\nreference on Gupta and Belnap's\ntheory T*, but, so Kremer argues,\ndoes not on Gupta and Belnap's\ntheory T#. This discussion is\nfurther taken up by Wintein 2014. \nA contrast presupposed by this entry is between allegedly two-valued\ntheories, like the RTT, and allegedly three-valued or other\nmany-valued rivals. One might think of the RTT itself as providing\ninfinitely many semantic values, for example one value for every\npossible revision sequence. Or one could extract three semantic values\nfor sentences: categorical truth, categorical falsehood, and\nuncategoricalness. \nIn reply, it must be granted that the RTT generates\nmany statuses available to sentences. Similarly, three-valued\napproaches also typically generate many statuses available to\nsentences. The claim of two-valuedness is not a claim about statuses\navailable to sentences, but rather a claim about the truth\nvalues presupposed in the whole enterprise. \n\nWe note three ways to amend the RTT. First, we might put constraints\non which hypotheses are acceptable. For example, Gupta and Belnap 1993\nintroduce a theory, Tc, of truth\nbased on consistent hypotheses: an hypothesis h is\nconsistent iff the set\n{A : h(A) =\nt} is a complete consistent set of sentences.  The\nrelative merits of T*,\nT# and\nTc are discussed in Gupta &\nBelnap 1993, Chapter 6. \n Second, we might adopt a more restrictive limit policy than\nGupta and Belnap adopt.  Recall the question asked in Section 3: How\nshould we set Sη(d) when η is a\nlimit ordinal? We gave a partial answer: any object that is stably\ntrue [false] up to that stage should be true [false]\nat that stage. We also noted that for an object d\n∈ D that does not stabilize up to the stage η, Gupta\nand Belnap 1993 allow us to set Sη(d)\nas either t or f. In a similar\ncontext, Herzberger 1982a and 1982b assigns the value\nf to the unstable objects. And Gupta originally\nsuggested, in Gupta 1982, that unstable elements receive whatever\nvalue they received at the initial hypothesis\nS0. \n\n These first two ways of amending the RTT both, in effect, restrict\nthe notion of a revision sequence, by putting constraints on which of\nour revision sequences really count as acceptable revision\nsequences. The constraints are, in some sense local: the first\nconstraint is achieved by putting restrictions on which hypotheses can\nbe used, and the second constraint is achieved by putting restrictions\non what happens at limit ordinals. A third option would be to put more\nglobal constraints on which putative revision sequences count as\nacceptable. Yaqūb 1993 suggests, in effect, a limit rule whereby\nacceptable verdicts on unstable sentences at some limit stage η\ndepend on verdicts rendered at other limit stages.\nYaqūb argues that these constraints allow us to avoid certain\n“artifacts”. For example, suppose that a ground model M =\n<D, I > has two independent\nliars, by having two names α and β, where\nI(α) = ¬Tα and\nI(β) =\n¬Tβ. Yaqūb argues that it is\na mere “artifact” of the revision semantics, naively presented, that\nthere are revision sequences in which the sentence\n¬Tα ≡\n¬Tβ is stably true, since the two\nliars are independent. His global constraints are developed to rule\nout such sequences. (See Chapuis 1996 for further discussion.)  \n\nAs indicated in our discussion, in Section 4, of the ‘iff’\nin the T-biconditionals, Gupta and Belnap present the RTT as a special\ncase of a revision theory of circularly defined concepts.  To\nreconsider the example from Section 4. Suppose that L is a\nlanguage with a unary predicate F and a binary predicate R. Consider a\nnew concept expressed by a predicate G, introduced through a\ndefinition, D, like this:  \n where A(x,G) is the formula \n In this context, a ground model is a classical model\nM = <D, I > of the language\nL: we start with a domain of discourse, D, and an\ninterpretation of the predicate F and the relation symbol\nR. We would like to extend M to an interpretation of\nthe language L + G. So, in this context, an\nhypothesis will be thought of as an hypothesized extension for the\nnewly introduced concept G. Formally, a hypothesis is simply\na function h : D →\n{t, f}. Given a hypothesis\nh, we take M+h to be the classical model\nM+h =\n<D, I′ >, where\nI′ interprets F and R in the same way\nas I, and where I′(G) = h.\nGiven a hypothesized interpretation h of G, we\ngenerate a new interpretation of G as follows: and object\nd ∈ D is in the new extension of G\njust in case the defining formula A(x,G) is\ntrue of d in the model M+h. Formally, we\nuse the ground model M and the definition D to\ndefine a revision rule,\nδD,M, mapping hypotheses to\nhypotheses, i.e., hypothetical interpretations of G to\nhypothetical interpretations of G.  In particular, for any\nformula B with one free variable x, and d\n∈ D, we can define the truth value\nValM+h,d(B) in\nthe standard way. Then, \n\n Given a revision rule δD,M, we\ncan generalize the notion of a revision sequence, which is\nnow a sequence of hypothetical extensions of G rather than\nT. We can generalize the notion of a\nsentence B being stably true, nearly stably\ntrue, etc., relative to a revision sequence.  Gupta and Belnap\nintroduce the systems S* and\nS#, analogous to\nT* and\nT#,\nas\n follows:[10] \n\nOne of Gupta and Belnap's principle open questions is whether there is\na complete calculus for these systems: that is, whether, for each\ndefinition D, either of the following two sets of sentences is\nrecursively axiomatizable:\n {B : ⊨*,D B}\nand \n {B : ⊨#,D B}.\n Kremer 1993 proves that the answer is no: he shows that there is a\ndefinition D such that each of these sets of sentences is of\ncomplexity at least Π12, thereby putting a\nlower limit on the complexity of S* and\nS#. (Antonelli 1994a and 2002 shows that\nthis is also an upper limit.)  \n Kremer's proof exploits an intimate relationship between circular\ndefinitions understood revision-theoretically and circular\ndefinitions understood as inductive definitions: the theory\nof inductive definitions has been quite well understood for some\ntime. In particular, Kremer proves that every inductively defined\nconcept can be revision-theoretically defined. The expressive power\nand other aspects of the revision-theoretic treatment of circular\ndefinitions is the topic of much interesting work: see Welch 2001,\nLöwe 2001, Löwe and Welch 2001, and Kühnberger et\nal. 2005. \n\nThe RTT is a clear example of a semantically motivated theory of\ntruth. Quite a different tradition seeks to give a satisfying\naxiomatic theory of truth. Granted we cannot retain all of classical\nlogic and all of our intuitive principles regarding truth, especially\nif we allow vicious self-reference. But maybe we can arrive at\nsatisfying axiom systems for truth, that, for example, maintain\nconsistency and classical logic, but give up only a little bit when it\ncomes to our intuitive principles concerning truth, such as the\nT-biconditionals (interpreted classically); or maintain consistency\nand all of the T-biconditionals, but give up only a little bit of\nclassical logic. Halbach 2011 comprehensively studies such axiomatic\ntheories (mainly those that retain classical logic), and Horsten 2011\nis in the same tradition. Both Chapter 14 of Halbach 2011 and Chapter\n8 of Horsten 2011 study the relationship between the Friedman-Sheard\ntheory FS and the revision semantics, with some interesting\nresults. For more work on axiomatic systems and the RTT, see Horsten\net al 2012. \n\nField 2008 makes an interesting contribution to axiomatic theorizing\nabout truth, even though most of the positive work in the book\nconsists of model building and is therefore semantics. In particular,\nField is interested in producing a theory as close to classical logic\nas possible, which at the same time retains all T-biconditionals (the\nconditional itself will be nonclassical) and which at the same time\ncan express, in some sense, the claim that such and such a sentence is\ndefective. Field uses tools from multivalued logic, fixed-point\nsemantics, and revision theory to build models showing, in effect,\nthat a very attractive axiomatic system is consistent. Field’s\nconstruction is an intricate interplay between using fixed-point\nconstructions for successively interpreting T, and revision sequences\nfor successively interpreting the nonclassical conditional — the\nfinal interpretation being determined by a sort of\nsuper-revision-theoretic process. \n\nGiven Gupta and Belnap's general revision-theoretic treatment of\ncircular definitions-of which their treatment of truth is a\nspecial case-one would expect revision-theoretic ideas to be applied\nto other concepts. Antonelli 1994b applies these ideas to\nnon-well-founded sets: a non-well-founded set X can be\nthought of as circular, since, for some X0,\n…, Xn we have X ∈\nX0 ∈ … ∈\nXn ∈ X. Chapuis 2003\napplies revision-theoretic ideas to rational decision making.  Also,\nsee Wang 2011 for a discussion of revision theory and abstract\nobjects, and Asmus 2013 for a discussion of revision theory and\nvagueness. \n\nIn the last decade, there has been increasing interest in bridging the\ngap between classic debates on the nature of truth —\ndeflationism, the correspondence theory, minimalism, pragmatism, and\nso on — and formal work on truth, motivated by the liar's\nparadox. The RTT is tied to pro-sententialism by Belnap 2006;\ndeflationism, by Yaqūb 2008; and minimalism, by Restall 2005. We must also mention Gupta 2006. In this work, Gupta argues that an\nexperience provides the experiencer, not with a straightforward\nentitlement to a proposition, but rather with a hypothetical\nentitlement: as explicated in Berker 2011, if subject S has\nexperience e and is entitled to hold view v (where\nS’s view is the totality of S’s concepts,\nconceptions, and beliefs), then S is entitled to believe a certain\nclass of perceptual judgements, Γ(v). (Berker uses\n“propositions” instead of “perceptual judgements” in his formulation.)\nBut this generates a problem: how is S entitled to hold a view? There\nseems to be a circular interdependence between entitlements to views\nand entitlements to perceptual judgements. Here, Gupta appeals to a\ngeneral form of revision theory — generalizing beyond both the\nrevision theory of truth and the revision theory of circularly defined\nconcepts (Section 5.4, above) — to given an account of how\n“hypothetical perceptual entitlements could yield categorical\nentitlements” (Berker 2011). \n\nWe close with an open question about T*\nand T#.  Recall Definition 3.11, above,\nwhich defines when a sentence A of a truth language\nL is valid in the ground model M\nby T* or by\nT#. We will say that A is\nvalid by T* [alternatively,\nby T#] iff A is valid in\nthe ground model M by T*\n[alternatively, by T#] for every ground\nmodel M. Our open question is this: What is the complexity of\nthe set of sentences valid by T*\n[T#]?","contact.mail":"kremer@utsc.utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utsc.utoronto.ca"}]
