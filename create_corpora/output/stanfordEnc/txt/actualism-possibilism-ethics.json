But, suppose furthermore that if you\ndo accept the invitation, you’ll freely decide to get inebriated\nat the wedding and ruin it for everyone, which would be the worst\noutcome. The second best thing to do would be to simply decline the\ninvitation. In light of these facts, should you accept or decline the\ninvitation? (Zimmerman 2006: 153). The answer to this question hinges\non the actualism/possibilism debate in ethics, which concerns the\nrelationship between an agent’s free actions and her moral\nobligations. In particular, it focuses on whether facts about how an\nagent would freely act in certain contexts play any role in\ndetermining the agent’s moral obligations. Historically, the\ndebate has primarily arisen in the work of impartial consequentialists\nwith an interest in deontic logic. However, its relevance is not\nlimited to such versions of consequentialism. The debate concerns the\nscope of acts that are relevant options for the agent, which is an\nissue that cuts across, and has substantive implications for, a wide\nrange of normative ethical views. As such, the debate brings into\nfocus issues of central importance for any normative ethical\ntheory.\n\n\n\nFor contingent historical reasons, this debate has unfolded in such a\nway that the following background assumptions are made in the\nliterature. First, likely for ease of exposition, everyone writes as\nif counterfactual determinism is true (Goldman 1976: 469; Greenspan\n1978: 77). That is, it is assumed that there are facts about how an\nagent would (not simply might) act in any given\nsituation. This assumption, however, is not necessary for the purposes\nof the debate (Portmore 2011: 56 fn. 1). Second, since everyone writes\nas if both counterfactual determinism is true and as if agents can act\nin a way in which they do not in fact act, those in the debate seem to\nassume compatibilism. Interestingly, the concerns raised by the\nactualism/possibilism debate still arise even if libertarianism about\nfree will is assumed (Portmore 2011: 167 fn. 21). Describing the\ndebate in libertarian terms, however, does add an extra layer of\ncomplexity to the discussion. Third, some form of maximizing\nconsequentialism is generally assumed, again, likely for ease of\nexposition. The debate actually arises for any normative ethical\ntheory that holds that there are at least pro tanto reasons\nto bring about the good, and so the importance of this debate extends\nfar beyond forms of maximizing consequentialism (Bales 1972; Goldman\n1976: 458 fn. 13). Fourth, the various positions in the debate are\nunderstood in terms of objective, rather than\nsubjective, obligations, though the same issues arise with\nrespect to both. Objective obligations are those determined by all of\nthe normatively relevant facts, which include facts of which the agent\nmay be unaware. By contrast, subjective obligations are determined by\nthe agent’s epistemic state (such as her beliefs, or beliefs\nthat would be supported by her evidence) concerning the normatively\nrelevant facts (cf. Zimmerman 1996: 10–20; Portmore 2011:\n12–23). Following the norms of the literature, these assumptions\noperate in the background of this encyclopedia entry as well. However,\nnone actually need to be made in order for the debate to get off the\nground. \nThe historical origins of the debate may be traced back to work by\nLars Bergström and Hector-Neri Castañeda. In his A\nProblem for Utilitarianism (1968), Castañeda argues that,\ngiven a few standard assumptions, utilitarianism is formally\nincoherent. His argument may be stated rather straightforwardly.\nFirst, Castañeda assumes a principle of deontic logic known as\n“ought distributes through conjunction”. This principle\nholds that if an agent S ought to do both A and\nB, then S ought to do A and S ought to do\nB (1968: 141). The term “ought” is used in a\nvariety of different ways in the ethics literature. However, when it\nis used in the formulation of views in the actualism/possibilism\nliterature, it should be understood as denoting the ought of moral\nobligation. This idea may be represented more formally as \nOught Distributes Through Conjuction:\n \nIn other words, if an agent is obligated to perform a set of acts, then\nthat agent is obligated to perform each of the acts in that set.  \nSecond, Castañeda considers a principle he refers to as (U),\nwhich he takes to be a basic commitment of all existing forms of\nutilitarianism. \n\nSome who have responded to Castañeda, such as Zellner (1972:\n125), took (U) not only to be a commitment of utilitarianism, but a\nformulation of act-utilitarianism itself. Now, here’s the\nsupposed problem. According to Castañeda, (ODC) and (U)\ngenerate contradictory prescriptions. To see why he believed this,\nsuppose that an agent S’s performing the conjunctive\nact-set \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) brings about a greater balance of\ngood over bad than any alternative act-set (singleton or plural)\nthat S can perform. It is supposed to follow from (U)\nthat S is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp\nB\\rangle\\). Now, given (ODC), it follows that S is obligated to\nperform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and that\nS is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\). But,\nCastañeda claims, given (U), performing \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\)\nwould result in more net good than performing any alternative,\nincluding \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\). Moreover, given (U), performing\n\\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) would also result in more net good than\nperforming any alternative, including \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\). Hence the\nsupposed contradiction. Performing \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) cannot result\nin both more good and less good than performing \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\).\nThis consequence may be illustrated with an example, drawn from\nWestphal (1972: 83–84).  \nNaturally, the act-set of ⟨opening the window & shutting\nthe door⟩ is the best that Tom can do in the circumstances he\nis in at the start on the warm day in question. Given\nCastañeda’s argument, Tom is obligated to ⟨open\nthe window⟩ and he is obligated to ⟨shut the\ndoor⟩. But if he is obligated to do each of them, then\n⟨opening the window⟩ must produce more net good than any\nalternative and ⟨shutting the door⟩ must produce more\nnet good than any alternative. But, Castañeda claims, each of\nthese acts cannot be uniquely optimific. \nCastañeda’s short article spawned a number of replies\nwith various proposed solutions. Castañeda himself argued that\nthe problem stemmed from the “only if” clause in\n (U)\n and concluded that it should be removed. However, he believed that,\neven once this clause has been removed, it remains an open question\nwhether utilitarianism could identify necessary conditions for\nobligatory actions (1968: 142). \nThe most numerous, and influential, replies were written by Lars\nBergström, who argued that the contradiction arises only if it is\nassumed that \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) are\nalternatives in the relevant sense. He argued that \\(\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) are not, in fact, alternatives\nsince they are compatible (Bergström 1968b: 43). Notably, this is\nan issue of which Bergström was clearly aware of in his (1966:\nch. 2) book in which he argued that “two actions can reasonably\nbe regarded as alternatives (in the morally relevant sense) only if\nthey are incompatible or mutually exclusive”. If, by hypothesis,\nS is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\), then\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) must be compatible and\nso are not alternatives (1968b: 44). The subsequent literature\nconsisted of a back-and-forth between Bergström and\nCastañeda that primarily revolved around identifying the\nmorally relevant set of alternatives and Bergström’s\nattempts to formulate a utilitarian principle that avoids\nCastañeda’s objection (Bergström 1968a,b, 1971,\n1973, 1976; Castañeda 1968, 1969, 1972). As will be shown in\nthe subsequent sections, the issue of identifying the morally relevant\nset of alternatives forms the crux of the actualism/possibilism\ndebate. \nDag Prawitz (1970) and Fred Westphal (1972) both suggested revising\n (U)\n by indexing actions to the time they would need to be performed in\norder to bring about the uniquely optimific outcome. So, if performing\nthe joint act \\(\\langle A \\at t_1 \\lamp B \\at t_2\\rangle\\) would\nresult in the greatest net amount of good, then S is obligated\nto perform \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\) and to perform \\(\\langle B \\at\nt_2\\rangle\\) and, Westphal claims, this avoids the contradiction. At\n\\(t_1\\), \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) supposedly is the act that\nwould produce the greatest net amount of good in comparison to any\nother act performable at \\(t_1\\). At \\(t_2\\), \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\)\nsupposedly is the act that would produce the greatest net\namount of good in comparison to any other act performable at \\(t_2\\).\nFinally, from among the performable act-sets that might occur from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\), \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) is the\nact-set that would produce the greatest net amount of good. Thus, each\nact is the uniquely optimific act at the time it is performed, or so\nWestphal claims. Notably, Prawitz (1968, 1970) and Westphal (1972)\neach argue that an act is permissible if and only if it is part of an\nact-set that, if performed, would bring about the greatest net good of\nany of the acts available to the agent. In making this argument,\nPrawitz and Westphal were giving what may be considered the earliest\ndefenses of possibilism. However, they did not yet refer to this view\nas possibilism.  \nWhile possibilism itself remains a viable view in the literature,\nHarold Zellner demonstrated that Prawitz’s and Westphal’s\nresponses did not solve the specific problem Castañeda\nidentified for utilitarianism. This is because, while performing\n\\(\\langle A \\at t_1 \\lamp B \\at t_2\\rangle\\) may be uniquely\noptimific, it does not follow that performing either of these\nindividual acts at their respective times would be uniquely optimific.\nFor instance, performing \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\) may not be\nuniquely optimific if the agent would not perform \\(\\langle B\n\\at t_2\\rangle\\)if she first performs \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\).\nZellner (1972: 125)\nillustrates this with the following case.  \nAgain, it would be best if Tom ⟨commutes to campus &\nteaches⟩, second best if he ⟨plays Cupid⟩, and\nworst if he ⟨commutes to campus & skips class⟩.\nThus, the value of the act-sets may be ranked from best to worst as\nfollows. \nZellner points out that, since Tom would \\(\\langle{\\sim}B\\rangle\\) if\nhe were to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\), the value of performing \\(\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) is not uniquely optimific even though the value of\nperforming \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) is uniquely optimific. Thus,\nin such cases,\n (U)\n combined with\n (ODC)\n still generates contradictions, even if each act is indexed to their\nrespective times. Zellner argued that, to solve the problem, (U)\nshould be rejected because it is inconsistent with a supposedly basic\nprinciple of inference, referred to as (NI), which holds that if an\nagent is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\), then\nshe is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) (1972: 125). This\nrule is sometimes referred to as Normative Inheritance or as\nPermissibility is Closed Under Implication. It may be\nrepresented more formally in the Standard Deontic Logic system as\n(Feldman 1986: 41): \nThis literature on the coherence of utilitarianism directly gave rise\nto the actualism/possibilism literature. Most importantly, (i) it made\nsalient the importance of determining the relevant act-alternatives\navailable to the agent and (ii) cases such as Teach, Play\nCupid, or Skip Class raised questions about the\nrelationship between an agent’s free actions and her moral\nobligations. As will be illustrated in the next section, actualists\nand possibilists are divided over cases with this exact structure. \nSuppose someone is trying to determine whether she is obligated to\nteach a summer school course that students would greatly benefit from,\nbut only if taught well. Do facts about how an agent would teach the\ncourse (e.g., well or poorly) have any role in determining whether she\nis morally obligated to teach the course? Actualists answer in the\naffirmative and possibilists in the negative. Possibilists hold that\nthe deontic status of an act \\(\\phi\\) depends on facts about how an\nagent could act were she to \\(\\phi\\). So, according to\npossibilists, what determines whether she should teach the summer\nschool course is whether she could teach it well,\nirrespective of whether she would teach it well. Actualists,\nby contrast, hold that the deontic status of an act \\(\\phi\\) depends,\nin part, on facts about how an agent would act (under certain\nconditions) were she to \\(\\phi\\). So, according to actualists, roughly\nwhat matters in determining whether one should teach the summer school\ncourse is whether she would teach it well, irrespective of\nwhether she could teach it well. \nThese views, and their differences, can best be understood by\nconsidering the standard case in the literature, viz. Professor\nProcrastinate. Holly M. Smith (formerly Holly S. Goldman)\nprovides the original version of this case in her (1978:\n185–186) essay, and variations of it appear throughout the\nliterature (Jackson & Pargetter 1986: 235; Carlson 1995: 124;\nVorobej 2000: 131–132; Portmore 2011: 180, 2019: ch. 5;\nTimmerman 2015: 1512; Timmerman & Cohen 2016: 673–674;\nCariani 2016: 400).  \nThe value of the act-sets that Procrastinate can perform are ranked\nfrom best to worst as follows. \nFurthermore, Procrastinate would \\(\\langle{\\sim}b\\rangle\\) regardless\nof whether she would \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\). In other words, the\nfollowing counterfactuals are true. \nOn a rough definition, according to actualism, Procrastinate is\nobligated to decline to review the paper because what would\nactually happen if she were to decline is better than what\nwould actually happen if she were to agree to review the\npaper. By contrast, according to possibilism, Procrastinate is\nobligated to agree to review the paper because doing so is part of the\nbest series of possible actions that Procrastinate can\nperform over her life. Now that we’ve covered how these views\ngenerally come apart, we will focus on the more precise formulations\nof these views in subsequent sections. It should also be noted that\ncounterfactuals like (1) and (2) are assumed to be true at least\npartly in virtue of Procrastinate’s imperfect moral character.\nHowever, such counterfactuals can also be true as a result of an\nagent’s ignorance, as a result of lacking the dexterity to\nperform an act, and as a result of an agent’s inability to\ncomprehend some future act (Goldman 1978:198; Bykvist 2002: 50). For\nthe purposes of this entry, we will focus on an agent’s\nimperfect moral character since this factor seems to be the driving\nforce behind many points of disagreement between actualists and\npossibilists. \n\nIn its simplest form, possibilism is the view that an agent is\nobligated to perform an act just in case it is part of the best series\nof acts she can perform over the course of her life. It may be defined\nmore formally as follows. \nAccording to possibilism, the act-sets that have their deontic status\ndirectly (i.e., they do not have their deontic status in virtue of the\ndeontic status of any other act-set) are the act-sets that agents can\nperform over the course of their entire lives, which we will refer to\nas maximal act-sets (Åqvist 1969). Moreover, any non-maximal\nact-set has its deontic status indirectly (i.e., its deontic status is\ndetermined by the deontic status of a maximal act-set of which it is a\npart). In Professor Procrastinate, assuming that\nProcrastinate cannot perform any acts after doing either \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle Y\\rangle\\), or \\(\\langle Z\\rangle\\),\npossibilists hold that Procrastinate is obligated to \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\) because the best maximal act-set she can perform over the\ncourse of her life includes \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\), and \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle \\)-ing requires \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\)-ing. \n\nPossibilism has been given slightly different definitions in the\nliterature. However, unlike the different definitions of actualism\ndiscussed in the next section, typical definitions of possibilism are\nessentially synonymous. Patricia Greenspan (1978) does not offer a\nformal definition of possibilism, but defends the view by way of\nrejecting Holly Goldman’s actualist principle, referred to as\n(G*1). Greenspan does so in the process of defending her (1975) view\nin a related debate concerning whether ought-statements should be\ndated differently from their objects and about whether they hold from\ndifferent temporal standpoints. Fred Feldman defines possibilism in\nterms of possible worlds. Feldman refers to his theory as (MO). As he\ncharacterizes (MO), what S is morally obligated to do,\n“as of a time, t”, is  \nto see to the occurrence of a state of affairs, p, iff p\noccurs in some world accessible to S at t, and it is not\nthe case that \\({\\sim}p\\) occurs in any accessible world as good as\n(or better than) that one. (Feldman 1986: 38) \n\nMichael Zimmerman defines possibilism in the simpler, standard sense\ngiven above (2006: 153; 2017: 119). However, he also develops and\ndefends (MO)-inspired formulations of possibilism. In his (1996) book,\nhe provides a formulation of what he refers to as “world\npossibilism” (WP) that invokes the notion of “deontic\nvalue” instead of “intrinsic value”, so as to\nprevent the formulation of possibilism from assuming impartial\nconsequentialism. In his (2006: 166) essay, he defends a prospective\nversion of (WP), where the value in question is the expected value of\nall the acts an agent can intentionally perform, which he refers to as\n“adjusted core prospective value”. \n\nThere are other views that deviate from the above standard definitions\nof possibilism. Carlson (1995: 99–109; 1999) defends a view that\nbears resemblance to possibilism in which the sole obligatory act-set\nis a unique minimally specific invariably optimal act-set. At t\nan act-set is optimal for an agent S just in case its outcome\nis at least as good as any other act-set that is performable for\nS at t. An invariably optimal act-set is one which is\noptimal no matter what S does at t. An invariably\noptimal act-set is minimally specific just in case it is not a proper\npart of some other invariably optimal act-set available to S. A\nminimally specific invariably optimal act-set is unique just in case\nthere is no other minimally specific invariably optimal act-set\navailable to S. Thus, in contrast to standard formulations of\npossibilism, no act-set that is a proper part of a unique minimally\nspecific invariably optimal act-set has a deontic status. Vorobej\n(2000) defends a view he refers to as “prosaic\npossibilism”, which may be considered an intermediary between\npossibilism and actualism. In his (2009) article, which contains an\nargument against possibilism, Woodard defines the view in terms of\nnormative reasons for action rather than moral obligations. As a final\nexample, in his (2016) article, Vessel proposes what he takes to be a\n“possibilist variant” of a view known as moral securitism,\nwhich will be discussed in\n section 4.\n The first possibilist definition given in this section, however,\ncaptures the standard understanding of possibilism and the commitments\nof its proponents, including Greenspan (1978), Thomason (1981),\nHumberstone (1983), Feldman (1986: 38), and Zimmerman (1990; 1996:\n190; 2006; 2008: ch. 3; 2017). On this definition, Procrastinate is\nobligated to agree to review the paper since it is part of the best\nseries of acts that she can perform over the course of her life. \n\nIn contrast to possibilism, standard forms of actualism hold that\nProcrastinate is obligated to decline to review the paper because what\nwould actually happen if Procrastinate were to do this is better than\nwhat would actually happen if she were to agree to review the paper.\nFor, what would happen if Procrastinate were to decline the invitation\nis that the student would receive a second-rate job offer. However, if\nshe were to agree to review the paper then she would not review it and\nthe student would receive no job offer. A simple, but not\nunproblematic, version of actualism holds the following: \nOne problem with this definition is that it blurs together the\nintrinsic value of the consequences of an act and the deontic value of\nthat act. An actualist’s stance with respect to the relationship\nbetween these different types of value depends upon her preferred\nnormative ethical theory. We will discuss more precise and informative\ndefinitions of actualism in\n section 3.\n However, the above definition suffices to illustrate the primary\ndifference between actualism and possibilism. \n\nIt is natural to initially diagnose the disagreement between\nactualists and possibilists as a disagreement about which act-sets\nagents can perform. However, the actualism/possibilism debate\ncuts across debates about the relevant sense(s) of “can”.\nActualists and possibilists may agree with one another about which\nact-sets agents can perform in any given case. At bottom, their\ndisagreement concerns which acts, from among the acts the agent can\nperform, are normatively relevant options for the agent. Less\nabstractly, actualists and possibilists may agree that Procrastinate\ncan \\(\\langle X\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle Y\\rangle\\), or \\(\\langle\nZ\\rangle\\). After all, by stipulation, she can \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\)\nand if she \\(\\langle a\\textrm{-s}\\rangle\\), then by stipulation she\ncan \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) and if she does that, then she will have\nperformed \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\). Procrastinate can \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), though one may still wonder whether she has the relevant\nkind of ability to \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\). That is, one may\nwonder whether \\(\\langle X\\textrm{-ing}\\rangle\\) is a relevant\noption for the agent. It is this question that divides\nactualists and possibilists. Goldman (1976: 453 and 1978: 153)\ninitially suggested that \\(\\langle X\\textrm{-ing}\\rangle\\) is a\nrelevant option for the agent, appealing to the following\naccount of ability. \n\nInterestingly, Goldman (1978) later rejects this account of ability\nafter considering cases where, at \\(t_1\\), the agent can \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\), but would not \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) and thus would not\n\\(\\langle X\\rangle \\), regardless of her intentions at \\(t_1\\). Such\ncases are ones where it’s possible for the agent to \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), but Goldman argues that it would be “pointless to\nuse this account of ability when assessing the range of activities\nwhich a moral principle should assess”. This is because agents\n“could not make practical use of” prescriptions to perform\nsuch alternatives. These types of cases will be discussed in more\ndetail the next section. For now, the important takeaway is that while\nan agent can perform such conjunctive act-sets in the sense\npicked out by Ability 1, there may be times before the agent\nacts during which she cannot ensure that she will perform these\nact-sets. So, while it’s possible for Procrastinate to \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\) by intending to \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\) at \\(t_1\\) and then\nintending to \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) at \\(t_2\\), it may also be true\nthat, at \\(t_1\\), Procrastinate would not \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) at\n\\(t_2\\) no matter what she intends to do at \\(t_1\\). In light of such\ncases, Goldman proposes the following account of ability.  \nSo, for any given act-set, actualists and possibilists will agree\nabout whether an agent has Ability 1, Ability 2, or\nboth to perform that act-set and thus will agree about each sense in\nwhich agents can perform these act-sets. Yet, they will disagree about\nwhich sense of ability picks out the morally relevant set of options\nfor an agent. Possibilists (e.g., Feldman 1986; Zimmerman 1996),\nhybridists (Timmerman & Cohen 2016), and some actualists (e.g.,\nJackson & Pargetter 1986; Jackson 2014) take Ability 1 to\nbe a morally relevant sense of ability. Most actualists and all\nsecuritists (e.g., Portmore 2011, 2018) will take Ability 2,\nor something close to it, to be the morally relevant sense of\nability. \nPossibilism has a lot going for it. Most notably, it generates the\nintuitively correct moral verdicts in a wide range of cases. It\npreserves\n (ODC),\n (S), and related, similarly attractive, principles in deontic\nlogic (Goldman 1978: 80; Feldman 1986: 41–44; Zimmerman 1990:\n58–60; Zimmerman 2006: 154–155; Vessel 2009; Kiesewetter\n2018). It is thought to avoid the main objection leveled against\nactualism. That is, since possibilism requires agents to perform the\nbest act-set they can over the course of their lives, it is\nnot thought to let agents off the hook too easily. It also\navoids the other objections leveled against actualism discussed in the\nnext section. Also, see Zimmerman (1996: fn. 72 & fn. 122 and\n2017: ch. 3) for a nice review of some of possibilism’s\nadditional, lesser appreciated, virtues. While there is much to be\nsaid in favor of possibilism, it also faces certain challenging\nobjections. \nPerhaps the primary objection to possibilism is that it can generate\nobligations that, if acted on, would result in the worst possible\noutcome. Versions of this objection have been raised throughout the\nliterature, (Goldman 1976: 469–70; Sobel 1976: 202–203;\nFeldman 1986: 52–57; Almeida 1992: 461–462; Woodard 2009:\n219–221; Portmore 2011: 211; Ross 2012: 81–82; Gustafsson 2014: 593; Timmerman\n& Cohen 2016: 674). Possibilism generates\nthis consequence because it implies that facts about how agents would\nfreely act play no role in determining deontic verdicts. So, this\npotentially objectionable consequence of possibilism is a product of a\ncore commitment of the view. \nTo illustrate the issue, consider Professor Procrastinate\nagain. According to possibilism, Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper & review the paper⟩ and\nthus is obligated to ⟨agree to review the paper⟩.\nHowever, if Procrastinate were to act on her obligation to\n⟨agree to review the paper⟩, she would ⟨not\nreview the paper⟩, thereby bringing about the worst possible\noutcome. This may not sound so counterintuitive in Professor\nProcrastinate where the worst outcome isn’t tragic. Yet,\nthis objection has more intuitive force in high-stakes variants.\nSuppose that no matter what Procrastinate were to intend today, she\nwould freely ⟨not review the paper⟩ if she\n⟨agrees to review the paper⟩. Suppose furthermore that\nif Procrastinate were to ⟨not review the paper⟩, then\nthe student would not receive any job offers and commit suicide.\nPossibilism still renders the verdict that Procrastinate is obligated\nto ⟨agree to review the paper⟩ and it renders this\nverdict no matter how terrible the consequences of ⟨agreeing to\nreview the paper⟩ happen to be. This objection to possibilism\nmay be stated more precisely as follows.  \n\nPossibilists have responded by suggesting that the intuitive force of\nthis objection stems from failing to appreciate the distinction\nbetween conditional and unconditional obligations. The possibilist\nobligation is meant to pick out agents’ unconditional\nobligations and it supposedly is not problematic for agents to have\nunconditional obligations that, if acted upon, would result in the\nworst possible outcome (Greenspan 1978: 81; Zimmerman 2017:\n126–128). So, while it’s true that possibilism entails\nthat Procrastinate has an unconditional obligation to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper⟩ in virtue of her unconditional obligation to\n⟨agree to review the paper & review the paper⟩, it\nmay also be true that she has a conditional obligation to\n⟨decline to review the paper⟩ given that she would\n⟨not review the paper⟩ if she were to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper⟩. More generally, possibilists can respond by\nholding that agents have an unconditional obligation to do the best\nthey can, but incur conditional obligations to bring about the next\nbest outcome if they won’t bring about the best\noutcome. The distinction between conditional and unconditional\nobligations will be further explored in\n section 5. \nA closely related objection appeals to considerations about moral\nadvice (Goldman 1976: 470; Greenspan 1978: 81; Feldman 1986:\n55–57). Suppose that Procrastinate asks her friend whether she\nshould \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\). Knowing that Procrastinate would almost\ncertainly fail to \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) if she were to \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\), it seems that her advisor ought to advise Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\). The basic idea is that since\nProcrastinate’s advisor ought to tell Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\), Procrastinate is, contrary to what\npossibilists claim, obligated to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\). \n\nPossibilists who accept that one ought to advise Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\) will deny that this suggests that\nProcrastinate truly has an obligation to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\).\nRather, they’ll hold that Procrastinate’s advisor has an\nobligation to advise Procrastinate to do something she is obligated to\nrefrain from doing. Possibilists will point out that\nProcrastinate’s advisor, just like Procrastinate, is obligated\nto do the best she can. In this case, doing the best she can requires\nadvising Procrastinate to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\) since\nProcrastinate won’t \\(\\langle a \\lamp b\\rangle\\) no matter what\nProcrastinate’s advisor says. Thus, the best\nProcrastinate’s advisor can do is to get Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a \\lamp{\\sim}b\\rangle\\) and that requires telling\nProcrastinate that she ought to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\). Erik\nCarlson gives this response in his (1995: 127) article. Fred Feldman\ngives this response in his (1986: 57) book and puts the point\nthusly. \n\nWhen we give moral advice, we morally ought to advise in the best way\nwe can. That is, we should advise in the way we advise in the best\nworld open to us. When things go smoothly, our advice will be\ntrue…But when things go awry, we may find that to advise in the\nbest possible way, we must give false advice. Reflection on a more\nextreme case should make this clear. Suppose an ornery child always\ndoes the opposite of what we tell him to do. Suppose we know that he\nought to turn right, and that hundreds of lives depend upon it. Should\nwe tell him to turn right? Obviously not. \nBoth Holly Goldman (1976: 469–470) and Christopher Woodard\n(2009) argue that possibilism is committed to an implausible asymmetry\nbetween moral and prudential reasons, whereas actualism treats such\nreasons symmetrically. To motivate this objection, Woodard asks one to\nconsider an intrapersonal case of prudence that is structurally\nidentical to typical actualist/possibilist cases. \nSuppose each option is equally morally good. However, the\nprudential value of the act-sets may be ranked from best to\nworst as follows. \nAgain, the following counterfactuals are true. \nPrudentially, what ought Smith to do? Woodard suggests that\nintuitively Smith prudentially ought to \\(\\langle{\\sim}A\\rangle\\),\nwriting that it’s hard  \nto believe that the fact that [Smith] would choose \\({\\sim}B\\) were\n[she] to choose A is irrelevant to whether [Smith] should\nchoose A or not. (2009: 221)  \nHowever, if possibilists treat prudential reasons in the same way they\ntreat moral reasons, they would be committed to holding that Smith\nprudentially ought to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) even though this would\nresult in her wasting her money on a plane ticket she wouldn’t\nuse. In light of intuitive judgments about prudential cases, Woodard\nconcludes that unless  \nthere is a sharp asymmetry between prudential and moral\noughts…the parallel [case concerning moral reasons also]\naffects Smith’s moral obligation to choose A or\n\\({\\sim}A\\).  \nWoodard’s thought is\nthat prudential cases support actualist judgments and, to avoid\npositing an implausible asymmetry between moral and prudential\nreasons, we should think actualism is true in moral cases as well. \nIt’s worth noting that this sort of question about prudential\ncases arises in the rational choice literature. The analogous question\nconcerns whether rationality requires one to choose suboptimal courses\nof action by predicating one’s present behavior on what will\nseem most attractive to one at a later time (see McClennen 1990: ch.\n8–9; Gauthier 1994). The subsequent literature suggests that\nintuitions about prudential cases are at least mixed. \nIn response to Woodard, possibilists could again appeal to the\ndistinction between unconditional and conditional (prudential)\nobligations. Perhaps what Smith is unconditionally prudentially\nobligated to do is ⟨purchase the plane ticket & board the\nplane⟩ and thus has an unconditional obligation to\n⟨purchase the plane ticket⟩. However, given that she\nwouldn’t ⟨board the plane⟩ if she were to\n⟨purchase the plane ticket⟩, she may incur a conditional\n(prudential) obligation to ⟨not purchase the plane\nticket⟩. Given that she won’t do what she prudentially\nought to do, she conditionally ought to do the next best thing. \nZimmerman’s response is to deny that there is an asymmetry,\narguing that what “matters, according to possibilism, is what\none can control” (2017: 128). In other words, both prudential\ncases and moral cases are treated symmetrically in the sense that what\nmatters for any case, according to possibilism, concerns what\nis under an agent’s control. To illustrate, in contrast to this\npurely prudential case, consider a similar case in which Smith’s\nnot boarding the plane will result in result in her friend, Fred,\nbeing deeply disappointed that he and Smith will not get an\nopportunity to catch up in person. In both of these cases,\nSmith’s control with respect to performing \\(\\langle A \\lamp\nB\\rangle\\) is exactly the same. So, according to Zimmerman, it\ndoesn’t matter that, in either case, Smith would in fact\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}B\\rangle\\) if she were to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\); Smith\nis still obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\), and, a\nfortiori, perform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\). Zimmerman may be right\nthat possibilists are not committed to treating moral and prudential\nreasons differently. However, by treating them symmetrically, it may\nstill be true (as Goldman and Woodard suggest) that possibilists are\ncommitted to counterintuitive verdicts in certain prudential cases, as\nillustrated in Plane Tickets.  \nThe objections considered in this section are some of the most\ninfluential or instructive objections that apply to possibilism,\ngenerally construed. However, they do not exhaust the objections that\nmay be levelled against the view. Even if possibilists are able to\nprovide adequate responses to these objections, other considerations\nmay count in favor of an alternative view. In the next section, we\nturn to possibilism’s main competitor: actualism. \n\nWhen it comes to cases concerning agents who are disposed to act\nwrongly, actualists consider their possibilist counterparts to be\noverly idealistic by theorizing about our moral obligations without\nconsidering the moral imperfections that result in our failing to do\nthe best that we can. According to actualists, the specific way in\nwhich our imperfections need to be considered is by taking into\naccount the truth-value of certain counterfactuals of freedom, i.e.,\ncertain facts about what we would freely do if we were in some\ncircumstances. The only counterfactuals that are relevant to our\nobjective obligations are ones in which the circumstances in the\nantecedent are fully described (Jackson 1985: 178, 186; Jackson &\nPargetter 1986: 240). This is because strengthening the antecedent of\na counterfactual, i.e., adding information to the antecedent, can\nalter the counterfactual’s truth-value (Stalnaker 1968; Lewis\n1973). \n\nMost, if not all participants, in the actualist-possibilist debate\nseem to assume that the agents have the ability at one time to perform\nan act that they would not in fact perform at a later time if they\nwere in the relevant circumstances. For example, although Professor\nProcrastinate can ⟨agree to review the paper & write the\nreview⟩, she would, as a matter of fact, ⟨not write the\nreview⟩ if she were to ⟨agree to review the\npaper⟩. In other words, she would do something (not write)\nother than what she can do (write). By holding fixed the fact that\nProcrastinate would ⟨not write the review⟩ even if she\nwere to ⟨agree to review the paper⟩, it follows from\nactualism that Procrastinate ought to ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩, even though she can ⟨agree to review the paper\n& write the review⟩. This is because actualism roughly\nstates that an agent ought to \\(\\phi\\) just in case \\(\\phi\\)-ing would\nresult in a better outcome than any other alternative to \\(\\phi\\)-ing.\nRecall the generic definition offered in the previous section. \n\nNow, what would happen if Procrastinate were to ⟨decline to\nreview the paper⟩ is better than what would happen if\nProcrastinate were to ⟨agree to review the paper⟩. As\nthis example illustrates, the value that actualists assign to an\noption is determined by what would happen if that option were\nperformed, rather than by being a member of the best act-set that the\nagent can perform over time. ⟨Agreeing to review the\npaper⟩ is part of the best act-set that is presently available\nto Procrastinate. But the value of ⟨agreeing to review the\npaper⟩ is less than the value of ⟨declining to review\nthe paper⟩ because of what would happen if these respective\noptions were to be performed.  \n\nBeyond this minimal agreement among all versions of actualism that\nProfessor Procrastinate ought (given certain descriptions of the case)\nto ⟨decline to review the paper⟩, actualists diverge on\nother substantial issues concerning the scope of our obligations.\nHolly S. Goldman and Jordan Howard Sobel independently developed and\narticulated the first versions of actualism. We will begin by\nintroducing Goldman’s formulation which is motivated in part by\nthe need to avoid prescribing jointly unfulfillable obligations. \n\nThe above formulation of actualism is subject to the problem of\njointly unfulfillable obligations. That is, it generates multiple\nobligations such that it is impossible for the agent to fulfill all of\nthem. For example, Procrastinate is obligated to ⟨decline to\nreview the paper⟩ because this would result in a better outcome\nthan the outcome that would follow ⟨agreeing to review the\npaper⟩. On the other hand, Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper & write the review⟩\nbecause doing so would have a better outcome than the outcome of\n⟨declining to review the paper & not reviewing the\npaper⟩. This is a problem for Jackson and Pargetter’s\nversion of actualism, to be discussed below. Goldman’s and\nSobel’s versions of actualism are formulated precisely to avoid\nthis problem.  To see how Goldman avoids this problem, consider the\nfollowing formulation of actualism that Goldman (1976: 471) considers\nand rejects: \n\nThe basic idea behind (G) is captured in the aforementioned rough\ndefinition of actualism. Here are the details. “\\(A_i\\)”\nmay apply to a single act or a sequence of acts over time. The main\nproblem that Goldman finds with (G) is that even if \\(A_i\\) satisfies\n(1) and (2), (G) does not take into account the following sort of\ncase: “\\(A_i\\)” refers to a sequence of acts over time,\nthe following counterfactual is true: “if the agent were to\nperform the first half of \\(A_i\\), then the agent would not perform\nthe second half of \\(A_i\\)”, and the sequence of acts that would\nfollow the performance of the first half of \\(A_i\\) would be worse\nthan the sequence of acts that would follow an alternative to the\nfirst half of \\(A_i\\). (G) implies that in this sort of case the agent\nhas jointly unfulfillable obligations at the same time t, viz.\nan obligation at t to perform \\(A_i\\) and an obligation at\nt to refrain from performing the first half of \\(A_i\\). For\nexample, according to (G) Procrastinate ought to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper & write the review⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\) because the sequence of acts that would follow\nthis act sequence from \\(t_2\\) is better than any sequence from\n\\(t_2\\) which would follow any alternative act sequence at\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\), including the alternative of ⟨declining\nto review the paper & not writing the review⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\). But, on the other hand, according to (G)\nProcrastinate ought to ⟨decline to review the paper⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\) because the sequence of acts that would follow this from\n\\(t_1\\) is better than any sequence from \\(t_1\\) which would follow\nany alternative act at \\(t_1\\), including the alternative of\n⟨agreeing to review the paper⟩. Obviously, it cannot be\nthe case that both obligations are fulfilled. \nGoldman (1976: 467) illustrates the possibility of jointly\nunfulfillable obligations with the following example. \nAlthough ⟨going to the office⟩ is a prerequisite for the\nbest outcome (viz. the outcome that follows ⟨voting for a\nlanguage requirement⟩), ⟨going to the office⟩\nwould, in fact, result in the worst outcome (viz. the outcome that\nfollows ⟨discouraging the student from seeking psychiatric\naid⟩). ⟨Staying home⟩ rather than ⟨going to\nthe office⟩ would result in a better outcome (viz. the outcome\nof ⟨writing lecture notes⟩). Here is Goldman’s\nchart, which summarizes Jones’s predicament: \nFigure 1: [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.] \nAs a matter of stipulation, the act-set which would follow the act-set\nthat terminates with ⟨voting for the language\nrequirement⟩ at \\(t_3\\) is better than the act-set which would\nfollow any other \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-set available to Jones at\n\\(t_1\\). So\n (G)\n implies that, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to do the best she can.\nHowever, (G) also implies that, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to\n⟨stay home⟩ at \\(t_1\\) rather than ⟨go to the\noffice⟩ at \\(t_1\\). This is because both acts are performable\nfor Jones at \\(t_1\\), and the act sequence which would follow\n⟨staying home⟩ is better than the act sequence which\nwould follow ⟨going to the office⟩. So, according to\n(G), Jones has at least two obligations that are jointly\nunfulfillable, A: ⟨going to the office, then going to\nthe faculty meeting, then voting for the language requirement⟩,\nand B: ⟨staying home⟩. Jones cannot perform both\n\\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\). There is no possible scenario in which\nboth obligations are fulfilled. \n\nTo avoid the problem of jointly unfulfillable obligations, Goldman\n(1976: 473) proposes the following version of actualism: \n\nUnlike\n (G),\n (G*1) assesses an act’s deontic status in a procedural manner,\nstarting with the options that are immediately available to the agent,\nand then proceeding to the next immediately available options. To\nillustrate, part (A) of (G*1) tells us to first evaluate all of the\noptions that are immediately performable for Jones at \\(t_1\\), and\nthose options are either ⟨going to the office⟩ or\n⟨staying home⟩. The latter option is obligatory because\nit would result in a better act-set than the act-set that\nwould result if Jones were to ⟨go to the office⟩. Part\n(B) of (G*1) tells us that, as of \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to perform an\nimmediate successor to ⟨staying home⟩ at \\(t_1\\) that\nwould result in a better sequence of acts than any alternative option\nthat is an immediate successor to ⟨staying home⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\). So, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to ⟨stay home and then do\nresearch for lectures⟩ from \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\). Similarly,\nat \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to perform an act-set that terminates with\n⟨writing lecture notes⟩ at \\(t_3\\), given the assumption\nthat the act-set that would follow ⟨writing the lecture\nnotes⟩ at \\(t_3\\) is better than the act-set that would follow\n⟨fixing lunch⟩ at \\(t_3\\). \n\nThe application of\n (G*1)\n to the case of Jones explains why (G*1) does not imply the\npossibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations. Although what would\nhappen if Jones were to ⟨go to the faculty meeting⟩ at\n\\(t_2\\) is better than what would happen if she were to do anything\nelse at \\(t_2\\) that, as of \\(t_1\\), she can do, Jones is nevertheless\nnot obligated at \\(t_1\\) to ⟨go to the faculty\nmeeting⟩ at \\(t_2\\). This is because if Jones were to perform\none of the acts required for ⟨going to the faculty\nmeeting⟩, viz. ⟨going to the office⟩, then the\nworst outcome would occur. As of \\(t_1\\), any act that precludes\n⟨staying home⟩ at \\(t_1\\) is impermissible. \n\nJordan Howard Sobel (1976: 196) similarly defends a version of\nactualism that avoids jointly unfulfillable obligations: \nA life L is a sequence of acts over time, or, in the\nterminology of this article, an act-set over time, such that this\nact-set is not contained in some other act-set that an agent S\ncan perform over time. Hence, a life is identical to the\npossibilist’s notion of a maximal act-set. A life L is\nsecurable for S at time t if at \\(t\\) \\(S\\) can immediately\nperform the first moment of x, x is in L, and if\nx were to occur, then L would occur (Sobel 1976: 199).\nAn obligatory life is determined in part by the set of immediately\nperformable fully specific minimal acts available to the agent. A\nminimal act is one whose completion cannot be stopped by the agent\nonce it is initiated. As such, all instantaneous acts are minimal acts\n(if there are any such acts). Moreover, a minimal act is fully\nspecific just in case it is not entailed by two or more minimal acts\navailable to the agent. \nLike\n (G*1),\n and unlike\n (G),\n (S) does not imply that Jones ought to do the best she can over time\nin the sense affirmed by possibilists. This is because, according to\n(S), all lives that contain ⟨voting for the language\nrequirement⟩ are not securable for Jones at \\(t_1\\). At\n\\(t_1\\), there is no fully specific minimal act that Jones can\nimmediately perform such that if Jones were to perform it then Jones\nwould perform a sequence of acts that includes ⟨voting for the\nlanguage requirement⟩. Similarly, ⟨writing the\nreview⟩ is not securable for Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) because,\nat \\(t_1\\), there is no fully specific minimal act that Jones can\nimmediately perform such that, if Jones were to perform it, then Jones\nwould ⟨write the review⟩. \nIn contrast to the views of Goldman and Sobel, other forms of\nactualism embrace the possibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations\nwhile simultaneously resisting the claim that actualism implies the\npossibility of obligation dilemmas, i.e., scenarios in which all of\nthe options available to an agent over time result in a failure to\nfulfill at least one obligation. Consider Frank Jackson and Robert\nPargetter’s (1986: 233) formulation of actualism. \n[T]he values that should figure in determining which option is best\nand so ought to be done out of a set of options are the values of what\nwould be the case were the agent to adopt or carry out the\noption, where what would be the case includes of course what the agent\nwould simultaneously or subsequently in fact do: the (relevant) value\nof an option is the value of what would in fact be the case were the\nagent to perform it. \nJackson and Pargetter (1986: 244–245) maintain that there are\ndifferent sets of options out of which different obligations arise.\nFor instance, from the set of all \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-sets\navailable to Jones at \\(t_1\\), the option with the highest value\nconsists of the act-set that includes ⟨Jones’s voting for\nthe language requirement⟩ at \\(t_3\\). Therefore, out of the\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-set, at \\(t_1\\) Jones is obligated to\n⟨go to the office, then go to the faculty meeting, and then\nvote for the language requirement⟩. This is because what would\nhappen if this act-set were to occur is better than what would happen\nif some other \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-set were to occur. But on the\nother hand, from the set of immediately performable acts available to\nJones at \\(t_1\\), the option with the highest value consists of\nJones’ ⟨staying home⟩ because what would happen if\nJones were to ⟨stay home⟩ is better than what would\nhappen if Jones were to ⟨go to the office⟩. Therefore,\nout of the performable \\(t_1\\) acts, at \\(t_1\\) Jones is obligated to\n⟨stay home⟩. Like\n (G),\n Jackson and Pargetter’s view does not assess an act’s\ndeontic status in the procedural manner with which Goldman’s\n (G*1)\n or Sobel’s\n (S)\n assesses an act’s deontic status. Moreover, like (G), Jackson\nand Pargetter’s view implies the possibility of obligations that\ncannot be jointly fulfilled. We will henceforth refer to their view as\ncontextualist actualism because what an agent is obligated to do\ndepends on the set of options being considered within a certain\ncontext. \nThe possibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations initially seems\nto imply the possibility of obligation dilemmas, i.e., scenarios in\nwhich all of the options available to an agent over time result in a\nfailure to fulfill at least one obligation. But this is not the case\ngiven the assumption taken for granted in the actualist-possibilist\ndebate: that agents have control over the truth-value of certain\ncounterfactuals. In other words, agents can perform certain acts, and\nif they were to do so, then certain counterfactuals that are in fact\ntrue would instead be false. For example, Procrastinate can\n⟨agree to review the paper & then write the review⟩.\nIf she were to do this, then the following counterfactual that is\nfalse would be true instead: “If Procrastinate were to\n⟨agree to review the paper⟩, then she would\n⟨write the review⟩”. Moreover, if this\ncounterfactual were true, then Procrastinate would not be obligated to\n⟨decline to review the paper⟩. This is because, in this\ncounterfactual scenario, what would follow from ⟨declining to\nreview the paper⟩ would be worse than what would follow from\n⟨agreeing to review the paper⟩.  \nJackson and Pargetter rightly conclude from this that Procrastinate\ncan avoid violating any obligation because if Procrastinate\nwere to do something that she can do, viz. ⟨agree to review the\npaper & then write the review⟩, then Procrastinate\nwouldn’t be obligated to ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩ in the first place, and thus there would be no\nunfulfilled obligations (Jackson 1985: 194; Jackson & Pargetter\n1986: 242–243; Louise 2009: 330; Jackson 2014: 636). In this\nsense, according to contextualist actualism, the obligation to\n⟨agree to review the paper & then write the review⟩\noverrides the obligation to ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩. More generally, at time t an agent can do\nsomething over time such that, if it were done, then their primary\nobligation would be fulfilled, and the agent would not have any\nunfulfilled obligations from t onwards. Jackson and\nPargetter’s view is more similar to possibilism in comparison to\nstandard formulations of actualism insofar as Jackson and Pargetter\nagree with possibilists about an agent’s obligation to perform\nthe same maximal act-set. The difference between contextualist\nactualism and possibilism is that the former view affirms the\nexistence of additional obligations that arise from sets of options\nthat do not include this maximal act-set. \nJackson and Pargetter (1986: 246–249) believe that incompatible\nprescriptions are objectionable only when they arise from the same set\nof alternatives. But their view never generates incompatible\nprescriptions out of the same set of alternatives. Out of the set of\nalternatives of ⟨agreeing to review the paper⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\) or ⟨declining to review the paper⟩ at \\(t_1\\),\n⟨declining to review the paper⟩ is obligatory. But out\nof the \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\) alternatives available to Procrastinate\nat \\(t_1\\), ⟨agreeing to review the paper and then writing the\nreview⟩ is the obligatory option. Hence, according to\ncontextualist actualism, as long as actualism does not prescribe\nincompatible obligations from the same set of alternatives,\nincompatible prescriptions are unproblematic. Still, one might object\nthat their view is not action-guiding in the sense that their theory\ndoes not say whether the overriding obligation takes priority over the\nother obligations (cf. Jackson 2014: 636). \nBy relativizing obligations to different sets of options,\ncontextualist actualism is subject to the so-called lumping problem.\nThis is the problem of lumping alternatives to an option O into\na single alternative (not-O) (Wedgwood 2009\n [Other Internet Resources, OIR];\n Ross 2012; Cariani 2016). Here is an example. Suppose that the\nfollowing increasingly worse options are available to an agent\nA: ⟨go to work⟩, ⟨gamble at home⟩,\n⟨kill someone at home⟩. Suppose furthermore that the\nfollowing four counterfactuals are true. \nIn that case, what would happen if A were to ⟨gamble at\nhome⟩ is better than what would happen if A were to\n⟨not gamble at home⟩. For, if A were to\n⟨not gamble at home⟩, then A would ⟨kill\nsomeone at home⟩. Now, when we consider A’s\noptions to be ⟨gambling at home⟩ or ⟨not gambling\nat home⟩, contextualist actualism implies that A ought\nto ⟨gamble at home⟩. This should seem very implausible,\neven by actualists’ own lights, because what would actually\nhappen if A were to ⟨go to work⟩ is better than\nwhat would happen if A were to make any other choice at the\ntime in question. Those who find this result counterintuitive have\nsuggested that an obligatory act O must have a higher value\nthan all of the non-supererogatory options available to the agent,\nrather than only having a higher value than not-O. In response\nto this worry, Jackson and Pargetter can remind us that it is also\ntrue that A ought to ⟨go to work⟩ out of a\ndifferent set options, viz. ⟨going to work⟩,\n⟨gambling at home⟩, and ⟨killing someone at\nhome⟩.  \nThe relativization of obligations to different sets of options has led\nJackson and Pargetter to reject the “ought distributes over\nconjunction” (ODC) principle (1986: 247). Recall that ODC holds\nthat if an agent S ought to do both A and B, then\nS ought to do A and S ought to do B\n(Castañeda 1968: 141). While they accept that Procrastinate\nought to ⟨agree to review the paper & then write the\nreview⟩, they deny that Procrastinate ought to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper⟩. Similarly, their view implies that Jones\nought to ⟨go to the office, then go to the faculty meeting, and\nthen vote for the language requirement⟩. However, Jones ought\nnot to ⟨go to the office⟩ since Jones ought to\n⟨stay home⟩. \nGoldman’s\n (G*1)\n and Sobel’s\n (S)\n enjoy the theoretical and practical virtue of simplicity by\nprescribing a single obligatory act sequence at a time rather than\nmultiple, jointly unfulfillable prescriptions at a time. But this\ntheoretical virtue comes at the cost of a possibilist objection: their\nviews allow agents to avoid incurring moral obligations simply in\nvirtue of having an imperfect moral character, and this allows agents\nto, morally speaking, get off the hook too easily (Jackson &\nPargetter 1986: 240; Zimmerman 1996: 193–194, 2006: 156;\nPortmore 2011: 207; Baker 2012: 642–43; Timmerman 2015;\nTimmerman & Cohen 2016; Cohen & Timmerman 2016). For example,\n\nProcrastinate avoids incurring an obligation to comment on a\nstudent’s paper simply because she is disposed to behave badly.\nActualism is committed to this even in cases in which an agent is\ndisposed to behave badly just because they intend to behave badly.\nBut, possibilists claim, agents cannot avoid incurring an obligation to \\(\\phi\\)\nsimply because they intend to \\(\\phi\\) poorly. More generally,\npossibilists claim that being disposed to do wrong does not allow one\nto avoid incurring obligations to do good. \nProponents of\n (G*1)\n or\n (S)\n may retort by reminding us that this apparently problematic\nimplication is the result of taking into account the relevant\ncounterfactuals, and that not taking them into account is too costly.\nWhile Procrastinate’s ⟨agreeing to review the\npaper⟩ is part of the best act-set that she can perform over\ntime, it is also part of the worst act-set that she can perform over\ntime, and the worst act-set would be performed if Procrastinate were\nto ⟨agree to review the paper⟩ (Jackson & Pargetter\n1986: 237). Similarly, Jones’ ⟨going to the\noffice⟩ is part of the best act-set that she can perform over\ntime, but it is also part of the worst act-set that she can perform\nover time, and the worst act-set would be performed if Jones were to\n⟨go to the office⟩. \nContextualist actualism can, in a sense, sidestep this possibilist\nobjection since contextual actualists agree with possibilists that an\nagent ought to do the best that she can over time, and, in addition,\nthey consider this obligation to override all other obligations in the\naforementioned sense (Jackson 1985: 194; Jackson & Pargetter 1986:\n242–243; Jackson 2014: 636). Possibilists may not be satisfied\nwith this response. Since possibilists accept ODC, they infer that\nProcrastinate is obligated to ⟨agree to review the\npaper⟩ from the fact that Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper & then write the review⟩.\nContextualist actualism denies that Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper⟩ at the cost of rejecting\nODC. \nAll of these versions of actualism face a second possibilist\nobjection: they prescribe bad behavior that the agent can easily avoid\n(Wedgwood 2009\n [OIR];\n Ross 2012: 75–76). For example, Procrastinate can easily avoid\n⟨declining to review the paper⟩ by ⟨agreeing to\nreview the paper⟩ and, once Procrastinate ⟨agrees to\nreview the paper⟩, she can easily ⟨write the\nreview⟩. Nevertheless, all of these versions of actualism\nmaintain that Procrastinate should ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩ rather than ⟨agree to review the paper⟩.\nOther extreme actualist-possibilist scenarios highlight the force of\nthis objection. Suppose that the following act-set is the best one\navailable to a mass murderer M at \\(t_1\\): ⟨kill no\n\none⟩ at \\(t_1\\) and ⟨kill no one⟩ at \\(t_2\\).\n\nSuppose, however, that the best immediately available option for\nM is ⟨killing someone at \\(t_1\\)⟩ because of the\ntruth of the following two counterfactuals: “if M were to\n⟨kill someone⟩ at \\(t_1\\), then M would\n⟨kill no one⟩ at \\(t_2\\)”, “if M were\nto ⟨kill no one⟩ at \\(t_1\\), then M would\n⟨kill ten people⟩ at \\(t_2\\)”. Possibilists claim\nthat M should ⟨kill no one⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\) and thus that M should ⟨kill no\none⟩ at \\(t_1\\). Actualists, however, claim that M\nshould ⟨kill someone⟩ at \\(t_1\\). Contextualist\nactualism at least allows one to say that although ⟨killing\nsomeone⟩ at \\(t_1\\) is obligatory, doing this violates\nM’s obligation to ⟨kill no one⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\). Goldman and Sobel’s versions cannot\naccommodate this appeasing judgment. \nIt is worth noting that possibilism is thought to be subject to a\nrelated problem. While it doesn’t allow agents to avoid incurring\nmoral obligations for having a vicious moral character, it does allow\nagents to avoid incurring moral obligations to curtail their vicious\nmoral character (Timmerman and Swenson 2019). To illustrate the\nproblem, suppose that one of the optimific act-sets Apathetic Andy can\nperform over time includes ⟨playing video games tonight and\ndonating his expendable income to charity tomorrow⟩. Andy is,\nhowever, quite apathetic. As such, he won’t ⟨donate his\nexpendable income to charity tomorrow⟩ unless he first\n⟨reads work by Peter Singer tonight⟩. If he\n⟨plays video games tonight⟩, he will merely reinforce\nhis selfish nature and ⟨use his expendable income to purchase\nmore video games tomorrow⟩. Here’s the catch. The other\noptimific act-set Apathetic Andy can perform is to ⟨read work\nby Peter Singer tonight and donate his expendable income to charity\ntomorrow⟩. Moreover, if Andy ⟨reads work by Peter Singer\ntonight⟩, he would ⟨donate his expendable income to\ncharity tomorrow⟩. Performing this optimific act-set won’t be\npleasant for Andy, though, since he finds reading philosophy to be\ntedious. Here’s the problem. Possibilism renders the verdict that Andy\nis permitted to ⟨play video games tonight⟩, which would\nnot only result in a suboptimal outcome, but also exacerbate (rather\nthan curtail) his bad moral character. By contrast, actualism entails\nthat Andy is obligated to improve his moral character by\n⟨reading work by Peter Singer tonight⟩, and actualism\nthus ensures that Andy would ⟨donate his expendable income to\ncharity tomorrow⟩. So, both possibilism and actualism seem to\nlet agents with vicious moral characters off the hook too easily,\nalbeit in different circumstances and in different ways. \nIn the next section we will consider an additional objection to\nactualism that has led to the development of views that may be\nconsidered intermediaries of actualism and possibilism. According to\nthese views, a counterfactual is relevant to an agent’s present\nobligation only if the agent presently lacks a specific kind of\ncontrol over the truth-value of that counterfactual. \nRecall that the kinds of actualist-possibilist scenarios that we have\nbeen discussing—the cases of Professor Procrastinate\nand the case of Jones—are diachronic cases in the sense\nthat they concern different acts that are performed across different\nmoments of time, rather than at the same time. For example, in the\ncase of Professor Procrastinate, one of the relevant\ncounterfactuals is that if she were to ⟨agree to review the\npaper⟩ at \\(t_1\\), then she would ⟨not write the\nreview⟩ at \\(t_2\\). The act in the antecedent and the act in\nthe consequent are indexed to different times. On the surface, it may\nappear that a diachronic case would yield the same results as a\nsynchronic case, i.e., a case that involves the performance of\ndifferent acts at the same time. But as Goldman (1978) shows, a\nsynchronic actualist-possibilist scenario yields new difficulties for\nactualism, including Goldman’s (1976)\n (G*1),\n and the way to address these difficulties is by incorporating a\ncontrol condition over the truth-value of certain counterfactuals. \nConsider Goldman’s (1978: 186) case, which we’ll call\nTraffic 1: \nAccording to Goldman, it seems that Jones should\n⟨accelerate⟩ at t since Jones is going to\n⟨change lanes⟩ at t, and ⟨accelerating\n& changing lanes⟩ at t would result in a better\noutcome than that of ⟨not accelerating & changing\nlanes⟩. But now consider this case: \nIn Traffic 2 Jones ⟨changes lanes and doesn’t\naccelerate⟩ at t. It seems that Jones should ⟨not\nchange lanes⟩ at t since she is going to ⟨not\naccelerate⟩ at t. But it also seems that Jones should\n⟨accelerate⟩ at t since she is going to\n⟨change lanes⟩. We have arrived at the verdict that in\nTraffic 2 Jones should ⟨not change lanes⟩ and\nthat Jones should ⟨accelerate⟩. This verdict is\nextremely counterintuitive since this would result in colliding with\nthe back of the truck, which is the worst possible outcome.  \nAccording to Goldman, the lesson to be gleamed from synchronic\nactualist-possibilist cases is this: In determining what we are\nobligated at t to do at t, we should not hold fixed\nfacts about what we are freely doing at t. Moreover, such synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not determine in any way what an agent is obligated\nto do at any time. Consequently, the kind of immediate act-set that is\na candidate for being obligatory is the fully specific simultaneous\nact-set that is immediately available to Jones. A performable fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set is one such that one cannot also perform\nany other act-set at the relevant time. Goldman (1978: 190) calls such\nact-sets maximal conjunctive acts, but this entry will stick with the\nterminology of a fully specific simultaneous act-set in order\nto avoid ambiguation with other notions of act-sets at issue in this\npaper. Let’s suppose that the (immediate) fully specific\nsimultaneous act-sets available to Jones are ranked from best to worst\nas follows.  \nAccording to Goldman, given options (1)–(4), Jones should\nobviously perform (1). Moreover, notice that if Jones were to\nperform (1), then the following synchronic counterfactual that is in\nfact true in Traffic 2 would be false instead: “if\nJones were to ⟨not accelerate⟩ at t, then at\nt Jones would ⟨change lanes⟩”. So, given\nthe intuition that Jones is obligated to perform (1) and that doing so\nwould alter the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals, we\nshould not hold fixed the truth-value of such synchronic\ncounterfactuals when theorizing about an agent’s obligation to\nperform some immediate fully specific simultaneous act-set. To\naccommodate this judgment, Goldman’s (1978) revised view\nincorporates a control condition over the truth-value of such\nsynchronic counterfactuals. \nGoldman’s revised view still adopts the insight behind\n (G*1)\n that, in order to avoid the possibility of jointly unfulfillable\nobligations, an obligatory act-set (or, as Goldman calls it, a sequence\nof acts) must be such that it would occur if the agent were to\nimmediately perform the first act of the act-set, and the agent can\nperform this first act of the act-set. Goldman’s revised view\n(1978: 202) is referred to as “4”, but we will refer to\nit as (G+) here: \n\nUnlike\n (G*1) ,\n Goldman’s revised view requires the first act to be a fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set. Moreover, the kind of act-set that\nshould be directly assessed is a maximal sequence. S\nhas the ability at \\(t_1\\) to perform X only if S has\nthe ability at \\(t_1\\) to immediately (at \\(t_1)\\) perform the first\nfully specific simultaneous act-set in \\(X.\\) Goldman’s (1978:\n201) notion of a maximal sequence is different from the\npossibilist’s aforementioned notion of a maximal act-set which\nextends to the end of one’s life. For, according to Goldman\n(1978: 193–195), at t an agent can perform an act-set\nover time if and only if, if at t the agent wanted to perform\nthis act-set, then the agent would do so over time. This implies that\nthe performable act-set over time must be such that the agent can, at\nt, form an intention to perform this act-set over time that\nwould be causally efficacious if the intention were formed.\nGoldman’s notion of a maximal sequence is thus more restricted.\nThat is, a maximal sequence X is an act-set available to an\nagent at t is such that, at t, the agent can form an\nintention to perform X, and no other act-set that at t\nthe agent can intend to perform is a proper part of X. So,\nhenceforth, we will refer to Goldman’s notion of a maximal\nsequence as an intentionally maximal act-set, and this is to\nbe distinguished from a maximal act-set. \nRecall that, according to Ability 2, an agent S has\nthe ability to immediately perform the first fully specific act-set in\nan intentionally maximal act-set if and only if S would perform\nthis fully specific act-set if S wanted to do so, and by\nextension we may assume Jones can perform each of (1)–(4). Under\nthis assumption,\n (G+)\n implies that although Jones would ⟨change lanes⟩ if she\nwere to ⟨not accelerate⟩, Jones nevertheless ought to do\nsomething that requires her to ⟨not accelerate⟩, viz.\n⟨not change lanes & not accelerate⟩. To see how (G+)\ndiffers from the versions of actualism in\n section 3,\n consider the following version of Professor\nProcrastinate: \nAccording to\n (G+)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform an intentionally\nmaximal act-set M that includes ⟨accepting the request\nand commenting⟩ because there is an immediate fully specific\nact-set available to Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) such that if it were\nperformed then M would occur, and M is the best\nintentionally maximal act-set that is securable for Procrastinate at\n\\(t_1\\). By contrast, according to\n (G*1)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to ⟨not accept the\nrequest⟩ because this would result in the performance of\nact-set M* that includes ⟨not commenting⟩ at\n\\(t_2\\), and M* is better than the act-set M** that\nwould occur if Procrastinate were to ⟨accept the\nrequest⟩ at \\(t_1\\) because M** includes\n⟨accepting & not commenting⟩. \nOne might suspect that a modified version of\n (G*1)\n that focuses exclusively upon decisions rather than overt bodily acts\ncan handle synchronic actualist-possibilist cases, such as\nProfessor Procrastinate*. But this isn’t so because it\nis possible for the following two counterfactuals to be true: \nEven though (i) is true, the best thing that Procrastinate can do\ninvolves ⟨deciding to accept the request⟩, viz.\n⟨deciding to accept the request & commenting⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\). This shows that whether we assess an agent’s\nobligations in terms of decisions or overt bodily acts, the acts that\nare to be directly assessed are fully specific simultaneous act-sets,\nwhich is precisely what\n (G+)\n accomplishes. \nContextualist actualism and Goldman’s provisional but rejected\nprinciple\n (G)\n similarly imply that Jones is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform (1)\nrather than any of (2)–(4) since these views permit a\ncandidate obligatory act to be fully specific. But these views do not\nrequire a candidate obligatory act to be fully specific, and\nthus these views also have the peculiar implication that in\nTraffic II Jones is obligated to ⟨accelerate⟩\nand Jones is obligated to ⟨not change lanes⟩. \nThus far, we have seen that synchronic actualist-possibilist cases\nsuggest that, first and foremost, an agent has an obligation to\nperform a fully specific immediate act rather than a\nless-than-fully-specific immediate act. As a result, synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not even partly determine an agent’s\nobligation to perform some fully specific immediate act. This still\nleaves open a question about the ability that an agent must possess in\norder to be able to perform some immediate (fully specific) act in the\nrelevant sense. Goldman’s (1978: 195, 204–205) Ability\n2, for instance, is a version of the conditional analysis of\nabilities. The conditional analysis of abilities remains suspect by\nsome on the grounds that an agent does not have direct control over\ntheir desires. Given this, one may infer that facts about what an\nagent would do if she had different desires is irrelevant to her\nabilities (Lehrer 1968; Curran 1995: 82). Nevertheless, since many\nparticipants in the actualist-possibilist debate take for granted that\nthe ability to do otherwise is compatible with facts about what an\nagent will do or would do under certain circumstances, a number of\npeople have followed Goldman (1978) by taking the relevant kind of\ncontrol to be one that does not hold fixed all facts about the\nagent’s psychological makeup. See, for instance, the views of\nDoug Portmore (2011) and Jacob Ross (2012). \nPortmore (2011) understands the relevant kind of control an agent must\nhave over an option in terms of scrupulous securability. A\nset of acts (i.e., an act-set) is scrupulously securable by an agent\nonly if there is some set of intentions and some set of permissible\nbackground attitudes (including beliefs and desires), such that if the\nagent had these intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform\nthat act-set (2011: 165). The sorts of attitudes Portmore (2011: 167)\nhas in mind are judgment-sensitive attitudes, i.e., attitudes that are\nsensitive to judgments about reasons (Scanlon 1998: 20).  \nThis form of control is similar to the conditional analysis insofar as\nthe agent does not need to possess the relevant intentions and\nattitudes required to perform an act in order to have an ability to\nperform that act. It just has to be the case that if the agent were to\nhave such intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform the\nrelevant act. Portmore’s (2011: 166–167) exact account of\ncontrol is as follows: \nA set of acts, \\(α_j\\), is, as of \\(t_i\\), scrupulously\nsecurable by S if and only if there is a time, \\(t_j\\), that\neither immediately follows \\(t_i\\) or is identical to \\(t_i\\), a set\nof acts, \\(α_i\\), (where \\(α_i\\) may, or may not, be\nidentical to \\(α_j\\)), and a set of background attitudes,\nB, such that the following are all true: (1) S would\nperform \\(α_j\\) if S were to have at \\(t_i\\) both\nB and the intention to perform \\(α_i\\); (2) S has\nat \\(t_i\\) the capacity to continue, or to come, to have at \\(t_j\\)\nboth B and the intention to perform \\(α_i\\); and (3)\nS would continue, or come, to have at \\(t_j\\) B (and,\nwhere \\(α_i\\) is not identical to \\(α_j\\), the intention\nto perform \\(α_i\\) as well) if S both were at \\(t_i\\)\naware of all the relevant reason-constituting facts and were at\n\\(t_j\\) to respond to these facts/reasons in all and only the ways\nthat they prescribe, thereby coming to have at \\(t_j\\) all those\nattitudes that, given those facts, she has decisive reason to have and\nonly those attitudes that she has, given those facts, sufficient\nreason to have. \nPortmore (2011: 177) understands a set of acts \\(α_j\\) to be a\nmaximal act-set in a similar vein to both a possibilist’s notion\nof a maximal act-set and Sobel’s notion of a life. The set of\nacts “\\(α_i\\)” is not identical to\n“\\(α_j\\)” when, e.g., one lacks the ability at\n\\(t_j\\) to form an intention to perform “\\(α_j\\)”,\nalthough the agent would in fact perform \\(α_j\\) if the agent\nwere to form at \\(t_j\\) the intention to perform \\(α_i\\). For\nexample, earning a PhD may be presently scrupulously securable for an\nagent, although she is presently unable to form an intention to do all\nof the things that are required to attain a PhD at least because she\ncannot presently intend to write about an idea in her dissertation\nthat she has not yet studied (Portmore 2011: 169). So, whenever\n\\(α_j\\) and \\(α_i\\) are not identical, part (1) says that\nS would perform some act-set if S were to intend to\nperform some other act-set (along with certain background\nattitudes). \nPart (2) of the above definition states that an agent must have a\ncapacity (or an ability) to have certain attitudes and intentions.\nThis allows one to sidestep the difficulties that have been posed for\nthe conditional analysis of abilities (cf. Portmore 2011: 168). Part\n(3) states that the agent’s attitudes must be permissible. To\nillustrate, suppose that the only way in which Doug can ensure at 2 pm\nthat he will eat a healthy meal rather than pizza at 6 pm is by having\nthe irrational belief that his life depends upon eating a healthy meal\nat 6 pm. Since it seems that he is not obligated to have such a\nbelief, it follows that, at 2 pm, Doug is not obligated to eat a\nhealthy meal at 6 pm since there is no combination of intentions and\npermissible attitudes (as opposed to impermissible attitudes) that\nDoug can have at 2 pm, such that if he were to have them at 2 pm then\nhe would eat a healthy meal at 6 pm (Portmore 2011:\n164–165). \nPortmore (2011: 222) pairs this notion of control with the following\naccount of rational permissibility that applies to moral\npermissibility when there are moral reasons to act: \nSecuritism employs a top-down approach by using normative principles\nto directly assess the deontic status of maximal act-sets and then\nextending the same deontic status to non-maximal act-sets that are\ncontained in the relevant maximal act-set (Portmore 2011: 179). This\napproach reaps the benefits of Goldman’s\n (G+)\n of avoiding jointly unfulfillable obligations and of denying that any\nsynchronic counterfactuals even partly determine an agent’s\nobligations. \nPortmore’s securitism—and by extension other views that\nhold fixed facts that are not presently up to the agent in some\nsense—has been criticized on the grounds that it does not\ngenerate an obligation to do the best one can in the sense at issue in\nAbility 1, and thus securitism sometimes requires agents to\nperform terrible and vicious acts, and it allows one to avoid\nincurring an obligation in light of vicious or immoral dispositions\n(Timmerman 2015; Vessel 2016). \nRoss (2012: 84) similarly maintains that an agent can immediately\nperform an act that requires some attitude that the agent does not in\nfact have, although Portmore’s and Ross’s views diverge in\ncertain cases. Here is Ross’s view (2012: 91): \nIn essence, MWSS is the view that “at any given time, an agent\nis obligated, at every future time, to be currently satisfying a\nwide-scope version” of Smith’s\n (G+)\n or Portmore’s securitism (Ross 2012: 91). Ross believes that\nonly MWSS can account for each of the four conditions of his core idea\n(2012: 89, 91). \nTo see how these views diverge, consider the following case which is\nsimilar to a case described by Ross (2012: 87–88): at \\(t_1\\)\nSally has the ability to immediately form an intention to ⟨not\nkill anyone five years later at \\(t_5\\)⟩, although\n⟨killing no one at \\(t_5\\)⟩ is not scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). On the other hand, killing exactly one\nperson or killing exactly two persons at \\(t_5\\) are both scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). According to Portmore’s\nsecuritism, one of the objectively morally permissible maximal set of\nacts that is scrupulously securable by Sally at \\(t_1\\) involves\nkilling one person at \\(t_5\\). However, at \\(t_5\\), not killing anyone\nis scrupulously securable for Sally, and thus at \\(t_5\\) Sally is\nobligated to not kill anyone at \\(t_5\\). These stipulations in\nRoss’s case are derived from the fact that at \\(t_1\\) Sally has\nan impeccable moral character that will be corrupted through no fault\nof her own (by being kidnapped by Satanists). But her moral character\nis not corrupted to such an extent that she is unable at \\(t_5\\) to\nrefrain from killing anyone. To emphasize, at \\(t_1\\) the best\nefficacious intention that Sally can form involves killing one person\nat \\(t_5\\) whereas at \\(t_5\\) the best efficacious intention that\nSally can form involves killing no one at \\(t_5\\). Portmore’s\nsecuritism thus prescribes an act at some future time, but then does\nnot prescribe that act once that time is present. \nRoss (2012: 87–89) wishes to avoid this implication.\n MWSS\n does not imply that at \\(t_1\\) Sally is obligated to kill exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) because whether Sally kills exactly one person at\n\\(t_5\\) causally depends upon her intentions at \\(t_1\\). So, Sally\nsatisfies the following conditional by not satisfying the first part\nof the antecedent: (if whether Sally refrains from killing exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) does not causally depend on the intentions she will\nhave after \\(t_1\\), and if all her maximally preferable, directly\nsecurable options involve killing exactly one person at \\(t_5\\), then\nshe kills exactly one person at \\(t_5)\\). Instead, MWSS implies that\nat \\(t_1\\) (and at \\(t_5)\\) Sally is obligated not to kill anyone\nbecause she satisfies the following conditional only by satisfying its\nconsequent: (if whether Sally kills no one at \\(t_5\\) does not\ncausally depend on the intentions she will have after \\(t_5\\), and if\nall her maximally preferable, directly securable options involve not\nkilling anyone at \\(t_5\\), then she kills no one at \\(t_5)\\). \nA proponent of securitism may reply that there’s simply nothing\nSally can do at \\(t_1\\) that allows her to secure not killing anyone\nat \\(t_5\\), and thus having an obligation at \\(t_1\\) not to kill\nanyone at \\(t_5\\) concedes too much to possibilism. For, one of the\ncore intuitions driving securitist views is that we should treat our\nnon-securable futures in the same way we treat the futures of other\nagents; we should hold such futures fixed when determining our present\nmoral obligations. This thought has led to an expansive discussion of\nthe way in which actualist-possibilist scenarios raise fundamental\nquestions about agency and how we are to conceive of our present\nselves in relation to our future selves (Louise 2009; Baker 2012). \nThe discussion up until this point has centered around making sense of\nthe general notion that an agent ought to do the (non-supererogatory)\nbest that she is able to do. But some theories hold that an\nagent’s moral life is more complex than this because an\nagent’s ability to do less than the (non-supererogatory) best is\nalso obligatory is some non-primary sense. This approach is motivated\nin part by the thought that some wrong actions are better than others.\nMichael McKinsey (1979: 391–392) develops this approach,\ndefending a view with multiple levels of obligation. His view may be\nformulated as follows: \nLevels of Obligation (LO): \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is a life\nsequence from t for x. Every \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) has a rank\n\\(n (n \\ge 1)\\) relative to every other life-sequence from t\nfor x, where n is a positive integer. If \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\)\nis among the optimum life sequences from t for x, then\nthe rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 1\\); if \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is among the second\nbest such sequences, then the rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 2\\); and so on.\nx ought\\(_n\\) at t to do \\(A_i\\) iff: \nWhile McKinsey’s formulation of (LO) is rather complicated, the\nbasic idea is quite simple. According to (LO), an agent\nS’s primary obligation is identical to the obligation\nthat possibilists believe S has. Additionally, for every\nmaximal act-set M (or a life) that, at t, S can\nperform, if M is not identical to the best maximal act-set\nthat, at t, S can perform, but is better than the\nmaximal act-set that S will in fact perform, then at t\nS has a moral obligation to perform M. To illustrate,\nconsider this case: \n\n (LO)\n implies that there are three levels of obligations that Ben fails to\nfulfill: his primary obligation to refrain from pressing any button,\nhis secondary obligation to press the first button, and his tertiary\nobligation to press the second button. If Ben were to instead press\nthe second button, then Ben would have failed to fulfill only two\nobligations, viz. the primary obligation to refrain from pressing a\nbutton, and the secondary obligation to press the first button.  \nMcKinsey’s\n (LO)\n is, in one sense, in agreement with possibilism because an\nagent’s primary obligation is identical to a possibilist\nobligation. Moreover, even though (LO) can generate jointly\nunfulfillable obligations, (LO) agrees with Jackson and\nPargetter’s contextualist actualism that if, in the terminology\nof (LO), an agent fulfills her primary obligation, then it’s not\nthe case that the agent violates any non-primary obligations because\nthe agent simply does not have any non-primary obligations. For\nexample, if Ben refrains from pressing any button, then according to\n(LO) it’s not the case that Ben had a secondary obligation to\npress the first button, and thus no non-primary obligations are\nviolated. McKinsey’s (LO) is, in a sense, also in agreement with\n(non-contextualist) versions of actualism. For example,\nProcrastinate’s obligation according to non-contextualist\nversions of actualism is to ⟨decline to review the paper &\nnot review the paper⟩, and, according to McKinsey, this is\nProcrastinate’s secondary obligation because this act-sequence\nis the second best maximal act-sequence (or a part of the second best\nmaximal act-sequence) that Procrastinate can perform over time.  \nGoldman (1978: 205–208) holds that there are exactly two orders\nof obligations, one primary and one secondary, and that it is better\nto fulfill one’s secondary obligation rather than to violate\nboth obligations. Primary obligations are governed by Goldman’s\n (G+),\n and secondary obligations are governed by principles such as\nGoldman’s (1976)\n (G*1)\n which, as we have seen in\n section 4,\n does not take into account an agent’s moral character that\ndetermines the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals. For\nexample, in the case of Professor Procrastinate*,\nProcrastinate’s primary obligation is to ⟨agree to review\nthe paper & review the paper⟩ because there is an\nimmediately performable, fully specific simultaneous act-set such\nthat, if performed, would result in ⟨agreeing & reviewing\nthe paper⟩. By contrast, Procrastinate’s secondary\nobligation is to ⟨decline to review the paper & not review\nthe paper⟩ because Procrastinate’s moral character is\nsuch that if Procrastinate were to ⟨agree to review⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\), then Procrastinate would harm the student by falsely\npromising to review at \\(t_2\\). Procrastinate’s moral character\nis taken into account by her secondary obligation, but not her primary\nobligation. As Goldman (1986: 205) notes, it is sometimes useful to\nreason in a way that holds fixed our actual moral character, and\npositing secondary obligations allows us to reason in this way.\nZimmerman (1986: 70) also subscribes to non-primary obligations and\nmotivates this position in part on the basis of considerations about\ndetachment and conditional obligations. \nThe issues raised by the actualist/possibilist debate are relevant for\na number of other debates in philosophy as well. As has already been\ndiscussed, whether actualism, possibilism, or some intermediary view\nis correct has direct import for various principles in deontic logic,\nthe correct formulation of act-consequentialism, and for analogous\nquestions in the philosophy of action. The actualism/possibilism\ndebate, however, is perhaps most closely connected to the\nmaximalism/omnism debate. These debates are deeply interrelated. While\nboth concern questions about the scope of the agent’s options,\nthe maximalism/omnism debate focuses on certain questions about how to\nassess these options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about whether\nall options should be assessed in terms of their own goodness, or\nwhether some options should be assessed in relation to the goodness of\nother options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about which facts\nground the reasons to perform the relevant options and, as will be\nillustrated shortly, are concerned with a wider range of cases than\nthose in the actualism/possibilism debate. \nThe maximalism/omnism debate concerns cases where the performance of\none option entails (or implies) the performance of another. Cases such\nas Professor Procrastinate are but one example.\nProcrastinate’s ⟨accepting the invitation and writing the\nreview⟩ entails ⟨accepting the invitation⟩. Not\nall examples share Procrastinate’s structure, however. Many\nexamples concern different ways of performing the same option in\ndifferent (e.g., more or less precise, better or worse) ways. For\ninstance, ⟨drinking a Coke⟩ entails ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩, ⟨visiting Uppsala⟩ entails\n⟨visiting Sweden⟩, and ⟨kicking someone very\nhard⟩ entails ⟨kicking someone⟩. \nNow, the central question in the debate concerns how the moral\nproperties of an option O are related to the moral properties\nof the options entailed by performing O. This abstract question\ncan be made clearer by considering an example. Suppose that I have\ngood reason to ⟨drink a soda⟩ and good reason to\n⟨drink a Coke⟩. Those in the maximalism/omnism debate\nare interested in whether the reason I have for performing one these\noptions grounds the reason I have for performing the other. Is it the\ncase that I have reason to ⟨drink a soda⟩ in virtue of\nmy having reason to ⟨drink a Coke⟩ or vice versa? Or is\nthere no grounding relation between my reason(s) to perform these\noptions? \nOmnists hold that all options should be directly assessed in terms of\ntheir own goodness. Omnism may be defined more precisely as\nfollows. \nIn this debate, a maximal option is simply understood as one that is\nnot entailed by any other option, aside from itself (Brown 2018: 752).\nMore precisely, a maximal option may be understood as “an option\nthat is maximally normatively specific in the sense that it is\nentailed only by normatively equivalent options”, where two\noptions are normatively equivalent if and only if they are equivalent\nin terms of all of the normatively relevant considerations (Portmore\n2017a: 428, 2017b: 2955). Any option that is not a maximal option will\nbe a non-maximal option. \nTo illustrate, suppose that hedonistic act-utilitarianism is true. To\nkeep things simple, suppose that the maximal options available to an\nagent S are ⟨drink a Coke⟩, ⟨drink nothing\nwhile smiling⟩, ⟨drink nothing while frowning⟩,\nand ⟨drink a Pepsi⟩. Suppose furthermore that\n⟨drinking a Coke⟩ would generate 5 hedons,\n⟨drinking nothing while smiling⟩ would generate 1 hedon,\n⟨drinking nothing while frowning⟩ would generate 0\nhedons, and ⟨drinking a Pepsi⟩ would generate 10 dolors\n(or −10 hedons). The non-maximal options available to S\ninclude ⟨drinking a soda⟩ and ⟨drinking\nnothing⟩. Finally, suppose that the following counterfactuals\nare true. \nAccording to omnism, whether it is permissible for S to\n⟨drink a soda⟩ depends on whether ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩ would result in maximizing hedonic utility. Given the\ntruth of (1), it wouldn’t, so omnism entails that\n⟨drinking a soda⟩ is wrong. Likewise, according to\nomnism, whether it is permissible for S to ⟨drink a\nCoke⟩ depends on whether S’s ⟨drinking a\nCoke⟩ would result in maximizing hedonic utility. It does, so\nomnism entails that ⟨drinking a Coke⟩ is permissible\n(and obligatory). \nUnlike omnists, maximalists hold that only maximal options should be\nassessed in terms of their own goodness. They believe that all\nnon-maximal options should only be assessed in terms of the goodness\nof the relevant maximal options of which they are a part. Maximalism\nmay be defined more precisely as follows. \nAssuming hedonistic act-utilitarianism once again, according to\nmaximalism, the deontic status of the maximal options depends on the\noutcome of performing each option. According to maximalism, then,\n⟨drinking a Coke⟩ would be obligatory and every other\nmaximal option would be impermissible. So, with respect to maximal\noptions, maximalism and omnism generate the same deontic verdicts. But\nnow consider what maximalists say about non-maximal options. This is\nthe point of contention between maximalists and omnists. By contrast\nwith the omnist’s ascription of wrongness to ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩, the maximalist holds that ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩ is obligatory. This is because the obligatory maximal\noption is ⟨drink a Coke⟩ and S cannot perform the\nmaximal option of ⟨drinking a Coke⟩ without performing\nthe non-maximal option of ⟨drinking a soda⟩. The\nnon-maximal act ⟨drink nothing⟩, on the other hand, is\nentailed by an impermissible act, namely ⟨drink nothing while\nsmiling⟩. So, maximalism entails that ⟨drinking\nnothing⟩ is impermissible. \nInterestingly, omnism has typically been assumed in the literature. It\nmay have only operated as an unquestioned background assumption until\nthe groundbreaking work of Bergström (1966) and Castañeda\n(1968). Goldman (1978) and Bykvist (2002) defend distinct variants of\nmaximalism. Since then, there have been a few arguments against\nmaximalism (cf. Gustafsson 2014). Omnism seems to be considered the\ndefault position, though new arguments against omnism and in favor of\nmaximalism have started to appear in the literature recently (Portmore\n2017a,b, forthcoming; Brown 2018). Much of the debate revolves around\ntheProblem of Act Versions. Following Brown (2018: 754) and\nPortmore (forthcoming: ch. 4), this problem may be explained by\nconsidering the following three jointly inconsistent principles. \n\nEach of these principles seems quite plausible when considered in\nisolation. Principle (1) simply holds that an agent ought to perform\nthe best option available to her. Assuming hedonistic\nact-utilitarianism, the best option(s) will be whichever one(s)\nmaximize(s) hedonic utility. Principle (2) holds that if an agent is\nobligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\),\nthen she is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\). So, if an\nagent is obligated to ⟨drink a Coke⟩ and\n⟨drinking a Coke⟩ entails ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩, then that agent is obligated to ⟨drink a\nsoda⟩.  \nPrinciple (3) holds that there are cases where an agent\nS’s obligatory option (e.g., a maximal option) entails\nanother option (e.g., a non-maximal option) that, if performed, would\nnot result in S performing the obligatory maximal\noption. Performing the best option of ⟨drinking a Coke⟩\nentails that S ⟨drink a soda⟩. But what would in\nfact happen if S were to ⟨drink a soda⟩ is that\nS would ⟨drink a Pepsi⟩ and ⟨drinking a\nPepsi⟩ is not S’s best option. That is, in fact,\nthe worst option. \nMaximalists have objected to omnism on the grounds that it, in\nconjunction with (2) and (3), entails a contradiction (Portmore\nforthcoming: ch. 4). Given omnism, S is obligated to\n⟨drink a Coke⟩ because performing that act is\nS’s best option. S’s ⟨drinking a\nCoke⟩ entails S’s ⟨drinking a soda⟩.\nSo, given (2), S is also obligated to ⟨drink a\nsoda⟩. However, recall that this case illustrates principle\n(3). If S were to ⟨drink a soda⟩, S would\n⟨drink a Pepsi⟩. Given this, ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩ would not result in S performing her best option.\nSo, omnism also entails that it is impermissible for S to\n⟨drink a soda⟩. Hence the contradiction. Omnism combined\nwith (2) and (3) entail both that S is obligated to\n⟨drink a soda⟩ and that it’s impermissible for\nS to ⟨drink a soda⟩. To avoid this contradiction,\nomnists must give up (2) or (3). Omnists such as Jackson and Pargetter\nhave given up (2). \nMaximalists reject omnism, which allows them to consistently accept\n(2) and (3), principles thought to have strong independent motivation.\nMaximalists, then, give up (1) to avoid the contradiction. According\nto the maximalist, sometimes agents are obligated to perform\nnon-maximal options (e.g., ⟨drink a soda⟩) that are not\ntheir best option in virtue of the fact that they are obligated to\nperform their best maximal option (e.g., ⟨drink a Coke⟩)\nand performing their best maximal option entails performing a\nsuboptimal non-maximal option. In short, the maximalist responds to\nthe Problem of Act Versions by giving up (1), while omnists\nrespond by giving up (2). As may already be clear, some motivations\nfor, and against, omnism parallel those of actualism, while some\nmotivations for, and against, maximalism parallel those of securitism\nand possibilism. Whichever considerations settle one of these debates\nwill likely settle (or at least significantly bear on) the other. \nThe actualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate in ethics\ngrew out of a debate concerning the problem that identifying act\nalternatives poses for act-consequentialism. The debate, in its\npresent form, may be traced back to the work of Holly Goldman’s\nand Jordan Howard Sobel’s independent articulations, and\ndefenses of, actualism. Early forms of actualism held that whether an\nagent is obligated to perform an act roughly depends on whether what\nwould happen if the agent performed that act is better than\nwhat would happen if the agent were to perform any alternative act at\nthe time in question. Contrast this with possibilism, which holds that\nwhether an agent is obligated to perform an act depends on whether\nthat act is part of the best maximal act-set the agent could\n(not would) perform over the course of her life. These are\nthe “extreme” versions of actualism and possibilism\nrespectively. To handle cases concerning synchronic acts, and to avoid\nhaving her view prescribe incompatible obligations, Goldman amended\nactualism by building a control condition into the definition in her\n(1978) essay. This revised actualism,\n (G+),\n along with Sobel’s\n (S),\n only holds fixed the acts of an agent that are not presently under\nthe agent’s control. This change proved influential and inspired\nvarious versions of this view, which came to be collectively referred\nto as securitism. Securitist views occupy a middle ground between\n“extreme” forms of actualism and possibilism. A variety of\nother views do too, including McKinsey’s (1979)\nlevels-of-obligation view and Carlson’s (1995, 1999) view. There\nis not yet a consensus about which view, if any, is the most\nplausible. Of course, this should not be surprising since the\nactualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate is,\nrelatively speaking, still quite new.","contact.mail":"travis.timmerman@shu.edu","contact.domain":"shu.edu"},{"date.published":"2019-05-20","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/actualism-possibilism-ethics/","author1":"Travis Timmerman","author1.info":"http://www.travistimmerman.com","author2.info":"https://usm.maine.edu/phi/yishai-cohen","entry":"actualism-possibilism-ethics","body.text":"\n\n\nSuppose that you have been invited to attend an ex-partner’s\nwedding and that the best thing you can do is accept the invitation\nand be pleasant at the wedding. But, suppose furthermore that if you\ndo accept the invitation, you’ll freely decide to get inebriated\nat the wedding and ruin it for everyone, which would be the worst\noutcome. The second best thing to do would be to simply decline the\ninvitation. In light of these facts, should you accept or decline the\ninvitation? (Zimmerman 2006: 153). The answer to this question hinges\non the actualism/possibilism debate in ethics, which concerns the\nrelationship between an agent’s free actions and her moral\nobligations. In particular, it focuses on whether facts about how an\nagent would freely act in certain contexts play any role in\ndetermining the agent’s moral obligations. Historically, the\ndebate has primarily arisen in the work of impartial consequentialists\nwith an interest in deontic logic. However, its relevance is not\nlimited to such versions of consequentialism. The debate concerns the\nscope of acts that are relevant options for the agent, which is an\nissue that cuts across, and has substantive implications for, a wide\nrange of normative ethical views. As such, the debate brings into\nfocus issues of central importance for any normative ethical\ntheory.\n\n\n\nFor contingent historical reasons, this debate has unfolded in such a\nway that the following background assumptions are made in the\nliterature. First, likely for ease of exposition, everyone writes as\nif counterfactual determinism is true (Goldman 1976: 469; Greenspan\n1978: 77). That is, it is assumed that there are facts about how an\nagent would (not simply might) act in any given\nsituation. This assumption, however, is not necessary for the purposes\nof the debate (Portmore 2011: 56 fn. 1). Second, since everyone writes\nas if both counterfactual determinism is true and as if agents can act\nin a way in which they do not in fact act, those in the debate seem to\nassume compatibilism. Interestingly, the concerns raised by the\nactualism/possibilism debate still arise even if libertarianism about\nfree will is assumed (Portmore 2011: 167 fn. 21). Describing the\ndebate in libertarian terms, however, does add an extra layer of\ncomplexity to the discussion. Third, some form of maximizing\nconsequentialism is generally assumed, again, likely for ease of\nexposition. The debate actually arises for any normative ethical\ntheory that holds that there are at least pro tanto reasons\nto bring about the good, and so the importance of this debate extends\nfar beyond forms of maximizing consequentialism (Bales 1972; Goldman\n1976: 458 fn. 13). Fourth, the various positions in the debate are\nunderstood in terms of objective, rather than\nsubjective, obligations, though the same issues arise with\nrespect to both. Objective obligations are those determined by all of\nthe normatively relevant facts, which include facts of which the agent\nmay be unaware. By contrast, subjective obligations are determined by\nthe agent’s epistemic state (such as her beliefs, or beliefs\nthat would be supported by her evidence) concerning the normatively\nrelevant facts (cf. Zimmerman 1996: 10–20; Portmore 2011:\n12–23). Following the norms of the literature, these assumptions\noperate in the background of this encyclopedia entry as well. However,\nnone actually need to be made in order for the debate to get off the\nground. \nThe historical origins of the debate may be traced back to work by\nLars Bergström and Hector-Neri Castañeda. In his A\nProblem for Utilitarianism (1968), Castañeda argues that,\ngiven a few standard assumptions, utilitarianism is formally\nincoherent. His argument may be stated rather straightforwardly.\nFirst, Castañeda assumes a principle of deontic logic known as\n“ought distributes through conjunction”. This principle\nholds that if an agent S ought to do both A and\nB, then S ought to do A and S ought to do\nB (1968: 141). The term “ought” is used in a\nvariety of different ways in the ethics literature. However, when it\nis used in the formulation of views in the actualism/possibilism\nliterature, it should be understood as denoting the ought of moral\nobligation. This idea may be represented more formally as \nOught Distributes Through Conjuction:\n \nIn other words, if an agent is obligated to perform a set of acts, then\nthat agent is obligated to perform each of the acts in that set.  \nSecond, Castañeda considers a principle he refers to as (U),\nwhich he takes to be a basic commitment of all existing forms of\nutilitarianism. \n\nSome who have responded to Castañeda, such as Zellner (1972:\n125), took (U) not only to be a commitment of utilitarianism, but a\nformulation of act-utilitarianism itself. Now, here’s the\nsupposed problem. According to Castañeda, (ODC) and (U)\ngenerate contradictory prescriptions. To see why he believed this,\nsuppose that an agent S’s performing the conjunctive\nact-set \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) brings about a greater balance of\ngood over bad than any alternative act-set (singleton or plural)\nthat S can perform. It is supposed to follow from (U)\nthat S is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp\nB\\rangle\\). Now, given (ODC), it follows that S is obligated to\nperform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and that\nS is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\). But,\nCastañeda claims, given (U), performing \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\)\nwould result in more net good than performing any alternative,\nincluding \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\). Moreover, given (U), performing\n\\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) would also result in more net good than\nperforming any alternative, including \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\). Hence the\nsupposed contradiction. Performing \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) cannot result\nin both more good and less good than performing \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\).\nThis consequence may be illustrated with an example, drawn from\nWestphal (1972: 83–84).  \nNaturally, the act-set of ⟨opening the window & shutting\nthe door⟩ is the best that Tom can do in the circumstances he\nis in at the start on the warm day in question. Given\nCastañeda’s argument, Tom is obligated to ⟨open\nthe window⟩ and he is obligated to ⟨shut the\ndoor⟩. But if he is obligated to do each of them, then\n⟨opening the window⟩ must produce more net good than any\nalternative and ⟨shutting the door⟩ must produce more\nnet good than any alternative. But, Castañeda claims, each of\nthese acts cannot be uniquely optimific. \nCastañeda’s short article spawned a number of replies\nwith various proposed solutions. Castañeda himself argued that\nthe problem stemmed from the “only if” clause in\n (U)\n and concluded that it should be removed. However, he believed that,\neven once this clause has been removed, it remains an open question\nwhether utilitarianism could identify necessary conditions for\nobligatory actions (1968: 142). \nThe most numerous, and influential, replies were written by Lars\nBergström, who argued that the contradiction arises only if it is\nassumed that \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) are\nalternatives in the relevant sense. He argued that \\(\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) are not, in fact, alternatives\nsince they are compatible (Bergström 1968b: 43). Notably, this is\nan issue of which Bergström was clearly aware of in his (1966:\nch. 2) book in which he argued that “two actions can reasonably\nbe regarded as alternatives (in the morally relevant sense) only if\nthey are incompatible or mutually exclusive”. If, by hypothesis,\nS is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\), then\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) must be compatible and\nso are not alternatives (1968b: 44). The subsequent literature\nconsisted of a back-and-forth between Bergström and\nCastañeda that primarily revolved around identifying the\nmorally relevant set of alternatives and Bergström’s\nattempts to formulate a utilitarian principle that avoids\nCastañeda’s objection (Bergström 1968a,b, 1971,\n1973, 1976; Castañeda 1968, 1969, 1972). As will be shown in\nthe subsequent sections, the issue of identifying the morally relevant\nset of alternatives forms the crux of the actualism/possibilism\ndebate. \nDag Prawitz (1970) and Fred Westphal (1972) both suggested revising\n (U)\n by indexing actions to the time they would need to be performed in\norder to bring about the uniquely optimific outcome. So, if performing\nthe joint act \\(\\langle A \\at t_1 \\lamp B \\at t_2\\rangle\\) would\nresult in the greatest net amount of good, then S is obligated\nto perform \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\) and to perform \\(\\langle B \\at\nt_2\\rangle\\) and, Westphal claims, this avoids the contradiction. At\n\\(t_1\\), \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) supposedly is the act that\nwould produce the greatest net amount of good in comparison to any\nother act performable at \\(t_1\\). At \\(t_2\\), \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\)\nsupposedly is the act that would produce the greatest net\namount of good in comparison to any other act performable at \\(t_2\\).\nFinally, from among the performable act-sets that might occur from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\), \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) is the\nact-set that would produce the greatest net amount of good. Thus, each\nact is the uniquely optimific act at the time it is performed, or so\nWestphal claims. Notably, Prawitz (1968, 1970) and Westphal (1972)\neach argue that an act is permissible if and only if it is part of an\nact-set that, if performed, would bring about the greatest net good of\nany of the acts available to the agent. In making this argument,\nPrawitz and Westphal were giving what may be considered the earliest\ndefenses of possibilism. However, they did not yet refer to this view\nas possibilism.  \nWhile possibilism itself remains a viable view in the literature,\nHarold Zellner demonstrated that Prawitz’s and Westphal’s\nresponses did not solve the specific problem Castañeda\nidentified for utilitarianism. This is because, while performing\n\\(\\langle A \\at t_1 \\lamp B \\at t_2\\rangle\\) may be uniquely\noptimific, it does not follow that performing either of these\nindividual acts at their respective times would be uniquely optimific.\nFor instance, performing \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\) may not be\nuniquely optimific if the agent would not perform \\(\\langle B\n\\at t_2\\rangle\\)if she first performs \\(\\langle A \\at t_1\\rangle\\).\nZellner (1972: 125)\nillustrates this with the following case.  \nAgain, it would be best if Tom ⟨commutes to campus &\nteaches⟩, second best if he ⟨plays Cupid⟩, and\nworst if he ⟨commutes to campus & skips class⟩.\nThus, the value of the act-sets may be ranked from best to worst as\nfollows. \nZellner points out that, since Tom would \\(\\langle{\\sim}B\\rangle\\) if\nhe were to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\), the value of performing \\(\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) is not uniquely optimific even though the value of\nperforming \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) is uniquely optimific. Thus,\nin such cases,\n (U)\n combined with\n (ODC)\n still generates contradictions, even if each act is indexed to their\nrespective times. Zellner argued that, to solve the problem, (U)\nshould be rejected because it is inconsistent with a supposedly basic\nprinciple of inference, referred to as (NI), which holds that if an\nagent is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\), then\nshe is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) (1972: 125). This\nrule is sometimes referred to as Normative Inheritance or as\nPermissibility is Closed Under Implication. It may be\nrepresented more formally in the Standard Deontic Logic system as\n(Feldman 1986: 41): \nThis literature on the coherence of utilitarianism directly gave rise\nto the actualism/possibilism literature. Most importantly, (i) it made\nsalient the importance of determining the relevant act-alternatives\navailable to the agent and (ii) cases such as Teach, Play\nCupid, or Skip Class raised questions about the\nrelationship between an agent’s free actions and her moral\nobligations. As will be illustrated in the next section, actualists\nand possibilists are divided over cases with this exact structure. \nSuppose someone is trying to determine whether she is obligated to\nteach a summer school course that students would greatly benefit from,\nbut only if taught well. Do facts about how an agent would teach the\ncourse (e.g., well or poorly) have any role in determining whether she\nis morally obligated to teach the course? Actualists answer in the\naffirmative and possibilists in the negative. Possibilists hold that\nthe deontic status of an act \\(\\phi\\) depends on facts about how an\nagent could act were she to \\(\\phi\\). So, according to\npossibilists, what determines whether she should teach the summer\nschool course is whether she could teach it well,\nirrespective of whether she would teach it well. Actualists,\nby contrast, hold that the deontic status of an act \\(\\phi\\) depends,\nin part, on facts about how an agent would act (under certain\nconditions) were she to \\(\\phi\\). So, according to actualists, roughly\nwhat matters in determining whether one should teach the summer school\ncourse is whether she would teach it well, irrespective of\nwhether she could teach it well. \nThese views, and their differences, can best be understood by\nconsidering the standard case in the literature, viz. Professor\nProcrastinate. Holly M. Smith (formerly Holly S. Goldman)\nprovides the original version of this case in her (1978:\n185–186) essay, and variations of it appear throughout the\nliterature (Jackson & Pargetter 1986: 235; Carlson 1995: 124;\nVorobej 2000: 131–132; Portmore 2011: 180, 2019: ch. 5;\nTimmerman 2015: 1512; Timmerman & Cohen 2016: 673–674;\nCariani 2016: 400).  \nThe value of the act-sets that Procrastinate can perform are ranked\nfrom best to worst as follows. \nFurthermore, Procrastinate would \\(\\langle{\\sim}b\\rangle\\) regardless\nof whether she would \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\). In other words, the\nfollowing counterfactuals are true. \nOn a rough definition, according to actualism, Procrastinate is\nobligated to decline to review the paper because what would\nactually happen if she were to decline is better than what\nwould actually happen if she were to agree to review the\npaper. By contrast, according to possibilism, Procrastinate is\nobligated to agree to review the paper because doing so is part of the\nbest series of possible actions that Procrastinate can\nperform over her life. Now that we’ve covered how these views\ngenerally come apart, we will focus on the more precise formulations\nof these views in subsequent sections. It should also be noted that\ncounterfactuals like (1) and (2) are assumed to be true at least\npartly in virtue of Procrastinate’s imperfect moral character.\nHowever, such counterfactuals can also be true as a result of an\nagent’s ignorance, as a result of lacking the dexterity to\nperform an act, and as a result of an agent’s inability to\ncomprehend some future act (Goldman 1978:198; Bykvist 2002: 50). For\nthe purposes of this entry, we will focus on an agent’s\nimperfect moral character since this factor seems to be the driving\nforce behind many points of disagreement between actualists and\npossibilists. \n\nIn its simplest form, possibilism is the view that an agent is\nobligated to perform an act just in case it is part of the best series\nof acts she can perform over the course of her life. It may be defined\nmore formally as follows. \nAccording to possibilism, the act-sets that have their deontic status\ndirectly (i.e., they do not have their deontic status in virtue of the\ndeontic status of any other act-set) are the act-sets that agents can\nperform over the course of their entire lives, which we will refer to\nas maximal act-sets (Åqvist 1969). Moreover, any non-maximal\nact-set has its deontic status indirectly (i.e., its deontic status is\ndetermined by the deontic status of a maximal act-set of which it is a\npart). In Professor Procrastinate, assuming that\nProcrastinate cannot perform any acts after doing either \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle Y\\rangle\\), or \\(\\langle Z\\rangle\\),\npossibilists hold that Procrastinate is obligated to \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\) because the best maximal act-set she can perform over the\ncourse of her life includes \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\), and \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle \\)-ing requires \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\)-ing. \n\nPossibilism has been given slightly different definitions in the\nliterature. However, unlike the different definitions of actualism\ndiscussed in the next section, typical definitions of possibilism are\nessentially synonymous. Patricia Greenspan (1978) does not offer a\nformal definition of possibilism, but defends the view by way of\nrejecting Holly Goldman’s actualist principle, referred to as\n(G*1). Greenspan does so in the process of defending her (1975) view\nin a related debate concerning whether ought-statements should be\ndated differently from their objects and about whether they hold from\ndifferent temporal standpoints. Fred Feldman defines possibilism in\nterms of possible worlds. Feldman refers to his theory as (MO). As he\ncharacterizes (MO), what S is morally obligated to do,\n“as of a time, t”, is  \nto see to the occurrence of a state of affairs, p, iff p\noccurs in some world accessible to S at t, and it is not\nthe case that \\({\\sim}p\\) occurs in any accessible world as good as\n(or better than) that one. (Feldman 1986: 38) \n\nMichael Zimmerman defines possibilism in the simpler, standard sense\ngiven above (2006: 153; 2017: 119). However, he also develops and\ndefends (MO)-inspired formulations of possibilism. In his (1996) book,\nhe provides a formulation of what he refers to as “world\npossibilism” (WP) that invokes the notion of “deontic\nvalue” instead of “intrinsic value”, so as to\nprevent the formulation of possibilism from assuming impartial\nconsequentialism. In his (2006: 166) essay, he defends a prospective\nversion of (WP), where the value in question is the expected value of\nall the acts an agent can intentionally perform, which he refers to as\n“adjusted core prospective value”. \n\nThere are other views that deviate from the above standard definitions\nof possibilism. Carlson (1995: 99–109; 1999) defends a view that\nbears resemblance to possibilism in which the sole obligatory act-set\nis a unique minimally specific invariably optimal act-set. At t\nan act-set is optimal for an agent S just in case its outcome\nis at least as good as any other act-set that is performable for\nS at t. An invariably optimal act-set is one which is\noptimal no matter what S does at t. An invariably\noptimal act-set is minimally specific just in case it is not a proper\npart of some other invariably optimal act-set available to S. A\nminimally specific invariably optimal act-set is unique just in case\nthere is no other minimally specific invariably optimal act-set\navailable to S. Thus, in contrast to standard formulations of\npossibilism, no act-set that is a proper part of a unique minimally\nspecific invariably optimal act-set has a deontic status. Vorobej\n(2000) defends a view he refers to as “prosaic\npossibilism”, which may be considered an intermediary between\npossibilism and actualism. In his (2009) article, which contains an\nargument against possibilism, Woodard defines the view in terms of\nnormative reasons for action rather than moral obligations. As a final\nexample, in his (2016) article, Vessel proposes what he takes to be a\n“possibilist variant” of a view known as moral securitism,\nwhich will be discussed in\n section 4.\n The first possibilist definition given in this section, however,\ncaptures the standard understanding of possibilism and the commitments\nof its proponents, including Greenspan (1978), Thomason (1981),\nHumberstone (1983), Feldman (1986: 38), and Zimmerman (1990; 1996:\n190; 2006; 2008: ch. 3; 2017). On this definition, Procrastinate is\nobligated to agree to review the paper since it is part of the best\nseries of acts that she can perform over the course of her life. \n\nIn contrast to possibilism, standard forms of actualism hold that\nProcrastinate is obligated to decline to review the paper because what\nwould actually happen if Procrastinate were to do this is better than\nwhat would actually happen if she were to agree to review the paper.\nFor, what would happen if Procrastinate were to decline the invitation\nis that the student would receive a second-rate job offer. However, if\nshe were to agree to review the paper then she would not review it and\nthe student would receive no job offer. A simple, but not\nunproblematic, version of actualism holds the following: \nOne problem with this definition is that it blurs together the\nintrinsic value of the consequences of an act and the deontic value of\nthat act. An actualist’s stance with respect to the relationship\nbetween these different types of value depends upon her preferred\nnormative ethical theory. We will discuss more precise and informative\ndefinitions of actualism in\n section 3.\n However, the above definition suffices to illustrate the primary\ndifference between actualism and possibilism. \n\nIt is natural to initially diagnose the disagreement between\nactualists and possibilists as a disagreement about which act-sets\nagents can perform. However, the actualism/possibilism debate\ncuts across debates about the relevant sense(s) of “can”.\nActualists and possibilists may agree with one another about which\nact-sets agents can perform in any given case. At bottom, their\ndisagreement concerns which acts, from among the acts the agent can\nperform, are normatively relevant options for the agent. Less\nabstractly, actualists and possibilists may agree that Procrastinate\ncan \\(\\langle X\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle Y\\rangle\\), or \\(\\langle\nZ\\rangle\\). After all, by stipulation, she can \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\)\nand if she \\(\\langle a\\textrm{-s}\\rangle\\), then by stipulation she\ncan \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) and if she does that, then she will have\nperformed \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\). Procrastinate can \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), though one may still wonder whether she has the relevant\nkind of ability to \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\). That is, one may\nwonder whether \\(\\langle X\\textrm{-ing}\\rangle\\) is a relevant\noption for the agent. It is this question that divides\nactualists and possibilists. Goldman (1976: 453 and 1978: 153)\ninitially suggested that \\(\\langle X\\textrm{-ing}\\rangle\\) is a\nrelevant option for the agent, appealing to the following\naccount of ability. \n\nInterestingly, Goldman (1978) later rejects this account of ability\nafter considering cases where, at \\(t_1\\), the agent can \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\), but would not \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) and thus would not\n\\(\\langle X\\rangle \\), regardless of her intentions at \\(t_1\\). Such\ncases are ones where it’s possible for the agent to \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), but Goldman argues that it would be “pointless to\nuse this account of ability when assessing the range of activities\nwhich a moral principle should assess”. This is because agents\n“could not make practical use of” prescriptions to perform\nsuch alternatives. These types of cases will be discussed in more\ndetail the next section. For now, the important takeaway is that while\nan agent can perform such conjunctive act-sets in the sense\npicked out by Ability 1, there may be times before the agent\nacts during which she cannot ensure that she will perform these\nact-sets. So, while it’s possible for Procrastinate to \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\) by intending to \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\) at \\(t_1\\) and then\nintending to \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) at \\(t_2\\), it may also be true\nthat, at \\(t_1\\), Procrastinate would not \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) at\n\\(t_2\\) no matter what she intends to do at \\(t_1\\). In light of such\ncases, Goldman proposes the following account of ability.  \nSo, for any given act-set, actualists and possibilists will agree\nabout whether an agent has Ability 1, Ability 2, or\nboth to perform that act-set and thus will agree about each sense in\nwhich agents can perform these act-sets. Yet, they will disagree about\nwhich sense of ability picks out the morally relevant set of options\nfor an agent. Possibilists (e.g., Feldman 1986; Zimmerman 1996),\nhybridists (Timmerman & Cohen 2016), and some actualists (e.g.,\nJackson & Pargetter 1986; Jackson 2014) take Ability 1 to\nbe a morally relevant sense of ability. Most actualists and all\nsecuritists (e.g., Portmore 2011, 2018) will take Ability 2,\nor something close to it, to be the morally relevant sense of\nability. \nPossibilism has a lot going for it. Most notably, it generates the\nintuitively correct moral verdicts in a wide range of cases. It\npreserves\n (ODC),\n (S), and related, similarly attractive, principles in deontic\nlogic (Goldman 1978: 80; Feldman 1986: 41–44; Zimmerman 1990:\n58–60; Zimmerman 2006: 154–155; Vessel 2009; Kiesewetter\n2018). It is thought to avoid the main objection leveled against\nactualism. That is, since possibilism requires agents to perform the\nbest act-set they can over the course of their lives, it is\nnot thought to let agents off the hook too easily. It also\navoids the other objections leveled against actualism discussed in the\nnext section. Also, see Zimmerman (1996: fn. 72 & fn. 122 and\n2017: ch. 3) for a nice review of some of possibilism’s\nadditional, lesser appreciated, virtues. While there is much to be\nsaid in favor of possibilism, it also faces certain challenging\nobjections. \nPerhaps the primary objection to possibilism is that it can generate\nobligations that, if acted on, would result in the worst possible\noutcome. Versions of this objection have been raised throughout the\nliterature, (Goldman 1976: 469–70; Sobel 1976: 202–203;\nFeldman 1986: 52–57; Almeida 1992: 461–462; Woodard 2009:\n219–221; Portmore 2011: 211; Ross 2012: 81–82; Gustafsson 2014: 593; Timmerman\n& Cohen 2016: 674). Possibilism generates\nthis consequence because it implies that facts about how agents would\nfreely act play no role in determining deontic verdicts. So, this\npotentially objectionable consequence of possibilism is a product of a\ncore commitment of the view. \nTo illustrate the issue, consider Professor Procrastinate\nagain. According to possibilism, Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper & review the paper⟩ and\nthus is obligated to ⟨agree to review the paper⟩.\nHowever, if Procrastinate were to act on her obligation to\n⟨agree to review the paper⟩, she would ⟨not\nreview the paper⟩, thereby bringing about the worst possible\noutcome. This may not sound so counterintuitive in Professor\nProcrastinate where the worst outcome isn’t tragic. Yet,\nthis objection has more intuitive force in high-stakes variants.\nSuppose that no matter what Procrastinate were to intend today, she\nwould freely ⟨not review the paper⟩ if she\n⟨agrees to review the paper⟩. Suppose furthermore that\nif Procrastinate were to ⟨not review the paper⟩, then\nthe student would not receive any job offers and commit suicide.\nPossibilism still renders the verdict that Procrastinate is obligated\nto ⟨agree to review the paper⟩ and it renders this\nverdict no matter how terrible the consequences of ⟨agreeing to\nreview the paper⟩ happen to be. This objection to possibilism\nmay be stated more precisely as follows.  \n\nPossibilists have responded by suggesting that the intuitive force of\nthis objection stems from failing to appreciate the distinction\nbetween conditional and unconditional obligations. The possibilist\nobligation is meant to pick out agents’ unconditional\nobligations and it supposedly is not problematic for agents to have\nunconditional obligations that, if acted upon, would result in the\nworst possible outcome (Greenspan 1978: 81; Zimmerman 2017:\n126–128). So, while it’s true that possibilism entails\nthat Procrastinate has an unconditional obligation to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper⟩ in virtue of her unconditional obligation to\n⟨agree to review the paper & review the paper⟩, it\nmay also be true that she has a conditional obligation to\n⟨decline to review the paper⟩ given that she would\n⟨not review the paper⟩ if she were to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper⟩. More generally, possibilists can respond by\nholding that agents have an unconditional obligation to do the best\nthey can, but incur conditional obligations to bring about the next\nbest outcome if they won’t bring about the best\noutcome. The distinction between conditional and unconditional\nobligations will be further explored in\n section 5. \nA closely related objection appeals to considerations about moral\nadvice (Goldman 1976: 470; Greenspan 1978: 81; Feldman 1986:\n55–57). Suppose that Procrastinate asks her friend whether she\nshould \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\). Knowing that Procrastinate would almost\ncertainly fail to \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) if she were to \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\), it seems that her advisor ought to advise Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\). The basic idea is that since\nProcrastinate’s advisor ought to tell Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\), Procrastinate is, contrary to what\npossibilists claim, obligated to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\). \n\nPossibilists who accept that one ought to advise Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\) will deny that this suggests that\nProcrastinate truly has an obligation to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\).\nRather, they’ll hold that Procrastinate’s advisor has an\nobligation to advise Procrastinate to do something she is obligated to\nrefrain from doing. Possibilists will point out that\nProcrastinate’s advisor, just like Procrastinate, is obligated\nto do the best she can. In this case, doing the best she can requires\nadvising Procrastinate to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\) since\nProcrastinate won’t \\(\\langle a \\lamp b\\rangle\\) no matter what\nProcrastinate’s advisor says. Thus, the best\nProcrastinate’s advisor can do is to get Procrastinate to\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}a \\lamp{\\sim}b\\rangle\\) and that requires telling\nProcrastinate that she ought to \\(\\langle{\\sim}a\\rangle\\). Erik\nCarlson gives this response in his (1995: 127) article. Fred Feldman\ngives this response in his (1986: 57) book and puts the point\nthusly. \n\nWhen we give moral advice, we morally ought to advise in the best way\nwe can. That is, we should advise in the way we advise in the best\nworld open to us. When things go smoothly, our advice will be\ntrue…But when things go awry, we may find that to advise in the\nbest possible way, we must give false advice. Reflection on a more\nextreme case should make this clear. Suppose an ornery child always\ndoes the opposite of what we tell him to do. Suppose we know that he\nought to turn right, and that hundreds of lives depend upon it. Should\nwe tell him to turn right? Obviously not. \nBoth Holly Goldman (1976: 469–470) and Christopher Woodard\n(2009) argue that possibilism is committed to an implausible asymmetry\nbetween moral and prudential reasons, whereas actualism treats such\nreasons symmetrically. To motivate this objection, Woodard asks one to\nconsider an intrapersonal case of prudence that is structurally\nidentical to typical actualist/possibilist cases. \nSuppose each option is equally morally good. However, the\nprudential value of the act-sets may be ranked from best to\nworst as follows. \nAgain, the following counterfactuals are true. \nPrudentially, what ought Smith to do? Woodard suggests that\nintuitively Smith prudentially ought to \\(\\langle{\\sim}A\\rangle\\),\nwriting that it’s hard  \nto believe that the fact that [Smith] would choose \\({\\sim}B\\) were\n[she] to choose A is irrelevant to whether [Smith] should\nchoose A or not. (2009: 221)  \nHowever, if possibilists treat prudential reasons in the same way they\ntreat moral reasons, they would be committed to holding that Smith\nprudentially ought to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) even though this would\nresult in her wasting her money on a plane ticket she wouldn’t\nuse. In light of intuitive judgments about prudential cases, Woodard\nconcludes that unless  \nthere is a sharp asymmetry between prudential and moral\noughts…the parallel [case concerning moral reasons also]\naffects Smith’s moral obligation to choose A or\n\\({\\sim}A\\).  \nWoodard’s thought is\nthat prudential cases support actualist judgments and, to avoid\npositing an implausible asymmetry between moral and prudential\nreasons, we should think actualism is true in moral cases as well. \nIt’s worth noting that this sort of question about prudential\ncases arises in the rational choice literature. The analogous question\nconcerns whether rationality requires one to choose suboptimal courses\nof action by predicating one’s present behavior on what will\nseem most attractive to one at a later time (see McClennen 1990: ch.\n8–9; Gauthier 1994). The subsequent literature suggests that\nintuitions about prudential cases are at least mixed. \nIn response to Woodard, possibilists could again appeal to the\ndistinction between unconditional and conditional (prudential)\nobligations. Perhaps what Smith is unconditionally prudentially\nobligated to do is ⟨purchase the plane ticket & board the\nplane⟩ and thus has an unconditional obligation to\n⟨purchase the plane ticket⟩. However, given that she\nwouldn’t ⟨board the plane⟩ if she were to\n⟨purchase the plane ticket⟩, she may incur a conditional\n(prudential) obligation to ⟨not purchase the plane\nticket⟩. Given that she won’t do what she prudentially\nought to do, she conditionally ought to do the next best thing. \nZimmerman’s response is to deny that there is an asymmetry,\narguing that what “matters, according to possibilism, is what\none can control” (2017: 128). In other words, both prudential\ncases and moral cases are treated symmetrically in the sense that what\nmatters for any case, according to possibilism, concerns what\nis under an agent’s control. To illustrate, in contrast to this\npurely prudential case, consider a similar case in which Smith’s\nnot boarding the plane will result in result in her friend, Fred,\nbeing deeply disappointed that he and Smith will not get an\nopportunity to catch up in person. In both of these cases,\nSmith’s control with respect to performing \\(\\langle A \\lamp\nB\\rangle\\) is exactly the same. So, according to Zimmerman, it\ndoesn’t matter that, in either case, Smith would in fact\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}B\\rangle\\) if she were to \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\); Smith\nis still obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\), and, a\nfortiori, perform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\). Zimmerman may be right\nthat possibilists are not committed to treating moral and prudential\nreasons differently. However, by treating them symmetrically, it may\nstill be true (as Goldman and Woodard suggest) that possibilists are\ncommitted to counterintuitive verdicts in certain prudential cases, as\nillustrated in Plane Tickets.  \nThe objections considered in this section are some of the most\ninfluential or instructive objections that apply to possibilism,\ngenerally construed. However, they do not exhaust the objections that\nmay be levelled against the view. Even if possibilists are able to\nprovide adequate responses to these objections, other considerations\nmay count in favor of an alternative view. In the next section, we\nturn to possibilism’s main competitor: actualism. \n\nWhen it comes to cases concerning agents who are disposed to act\nwrongly, actualists consider their possibilist counterparts to be\noverly idealistic by theorizing about our moral obligations without\nconsidering the moral imperfections that result in our failing to do\nthe best that we can. According to actualists, the specific way in\nwhich our imperfections need to be considered is by taking into\naccount the truth-value of certain counterfactuals of freedom, i.e.,\ncertain facts about what we would freely do if we were in some\ncircumstances. The only counterfactuals that are relevant to our\nobjective obligations are ones in which the circumstances in the\nantecedent are fully described (Jackson 1985: 178, 186; Jackson &\nPargetter 1986: 240). This is because strengthening the antecedent of\na counterfactual, i.e., adding information to the antecedent, can\nalter the counterfactual’s truth-value (Stalnaker 1968; Lewis\n1973). \n\nMost, if not all participants, in the actualist-possibilist debate\nseem to assume that the agents have the ability at one time to perform\nan act that they would not in fact perform at a later time if they\nwere in the relevant circumstances. For example, although Professor\nProcrastinate can ⟨agree to review the paper & write the\nreview⟩, she would, as a matter of fact, ⟨not write the\nreview⟩ if she were to ⟨agree to review the\npaper⟩. In other words, she would do something (not write)\nother than what she can do (write). By holding fixed the fact that\nProcrastinate would ⟨not write the review⟩ even if she\nwere to ⟨agree to review the paper⟩, it follows from\nactualism that Procrastinate ought to ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩, even though she can ⟨agree to review the paper\n& write the review⟩. This is because actualism roughly\nstates that an agent ought to \\(\\phi\\) just in case \\(\\phi\\)-ing would\nresult in a better outcome than any other alternative to \\(\\phi\\)-ing.\nRecall the generic definition offered in the previous section. \n\nNow, what would happen if Procrastinate were to ⟨decline to\nreview the paper⟩ is better than what would happen if\nProcrastinate were to ⟨agree to review the paper⟩. As\nthis example illustrates, the value that actualists assign to an\noption is determined by what would happen if that option were\nperformed, rather than by being a member of the best act-set that the\nagent can perform over time. ⟨Agreeing to review the\npaper⟩ is part of the best act-set that is presently available\nto Procrastinate. But the value of ⟨agreeing to review the\npaper⟩ is less than the value of ⟨declining to review\nthe paper⟩ because of what would happen if these respective\noptions were to be performed.  \n\nBeyond this minimal agreement among all versions of actualism that\nProfessor Procrastinate ought (given certain descriptions of the case)\nto ⟨decline to review the paper⟩, actualists diverge on\nother substantial issues concerning the scope of our obligations.\nHolly S. Goldman and Jordan Howard Sobel independently developed and\narticulated the first versions of actualism. We will begin by\nintroducing Goldman’s formulation which is motivated in part by\nthe need to avoid prescribing jointly unfulfillable obligations. \n\nThe above formulation of actualism is subject to the problem of\njointly unfulfillable obligations. That is, it generates multiple\nobligations such that it is impossible for the agent to fulfill all of\nthem. For example, Procrastinate is obligated to ⟨decline to\nreview the paper⟩ because this would result in a better outcome\nthan the outcome that would follow ⟨agreeing to review the\npaper⟩. On the other hand, Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper & write the review⟩\nbecause doing so would have a better outcome than the outcome of\n⟨declining to review the paper & not reviewing the\npaper⟩. This is a problem for Jackson and Pargetter’s\nversion of actualism, to be discussed below. Goldman’s and\nSobel’s versions of actualism are formulated precisely to avoid\nthis problem.  To see how Goldman avoids this problem, consider the\nfollowing formulation of actualism that Goldman (1976: 471) considers\nand rejects: \n\nThe basic idea behind (G) is captured in the aforementioned rough\ndefinition of actualism. Here are the details. “\\(A_i\\)”\nmay apply to a single act or a sequence of acts over time. The main\nproblem that Goldman finds with (G) is that even if \\(A_i\\) satisfies\n(1) and (2), (G) does not take into account the following sort of\ncase: “\\(A_i\\)” refers to a sequence of acts over time,\nthe following counterfactual is true: “if the agent were to\nperform the first half of \\(A_i\\), then the agent would not perform\nthe second half of \\(A_i\\)”, and the sequence of acts that would\nfollow the performance of the first half of \\(A_i\\) would be worse\nthan the sequence of acts that would follow an alternative to the\nfirst half of \\(A_i\\). (G) implies that in this sort of case the agent\nhas jointly unfulfillable obligations at the same time t, viz.\nan obligation at t to perform \\(A_i\\) and an obligation at\nt to refrain from performing the first half of \\(A_i\\). For\nexample, according to (G) Procrastinate ought to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper & write the review⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\) because the sequence of acts that would follow\nthis act sequence from \\(t_2\\) is better than any sequence from\n\\(t_2\\) which would follow any alternative act sequence at\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\), including the alternative of ⟨declining\nto review the paper & not writing the review⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\). But, on the other hand, according to (G)\nProcrastinate ought to ⟨decline to review the paper⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\) because the sequence of acts that would follow this from\n\\(t_1\\) is better than any sequence from \\(t_1\\) which would follow\nany alternative act at \\(t_1\\), including the alternative of\n⟨agreeing to review the paper⟩. Obviously, it cannot be\nthe case that both obligations are fulfilled. \nGoldman (1976: 467) illustrates the possibility of jointly\nunfulfillable obligations with the following example. \nAlthough ⟨going to the office⟩ is a prerequisite for the\nbest outcome (viz. the outcome that follows ⟨voting for a\nlanguage requirement⟩), ⟨going to the office⟩\nwould, in fact, result in the worst outcome (viz. the outcome that\nfollows ⟨discouraging the student from seeking psychiatric\naid⟩). ⟨Staying home⟩ rather than ⟨going to\nthe office⟩ would result in a better outcome (viz. the outcome\nof ⟨writing lecture notes⟩). Here is Goldman’s\nchart, which summarizes Jones’s predicament: \nFigure 1: [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.] \nAs a matter of stipulation, the act-set which would follow the act-set\nthat terminates with ⟨voting for the language\nrequirement⟩ at \\(t_3\\) is better than the act-set which would\nfollow any other \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-set available to Jones at\n\\(t_1\\). So\n (G)\n implies that, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to do the best she can.\nHowever, (G) also implies that, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to\n⟨stay home⟩ at \\(t_1\\) rather than ⟨go to the\noffice⟩ at \\(t_1\\). This is because both acts are performable\nfor Jones at \\(t_1\\), and the act sequence which would follow\n⟨staying home⟩ is better than the act sequence which\nwould follow ⟨going to the office⟩. So, according to\n(G), Jones has at least two obligations that are jointly\nunfulfillable, A: ⟨going to the office, then going to\nthe faculty meeting, then voting for the language requirement⟩,\nand B: ⟨staying home⟩. Jones cannot perform both\n\\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\). There is no possible scenario in which\nboth obligations are fulfilled. \n\nTo avoid the problem of jointly unfulfillable obligations, Goldman\n(1976: 473) proposes the following version of actualism: \n\nUnlike\n (G),\n (G*1) assesses an act’s deontic status in a procedural manner,\nstarting with the options that are immediately available to the agent,\nand then proceeding to the next immediately available options. To\nillustrate, part (A) of (G*1) tells us to first evaluate all of the\noptions that are immediately performable for Jones at \\(t_1\\), and\nthose options are either ⟨going to the office⟩ or\n⟨staying home⟩. The latter option is obligatory because\nit would result in a better act-set than the act-set that\nwould result if Jones were to ⟨go to the office⟩. Part\n(B) of (G*1) tells us that, as of \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to perform an\nimmediate successor to ⟨staying home⟩ at \\(t_1\\) that\nwould result in a better sequence of acts than any alternative option\nthat is an immediate successor to ⟨staying home⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\). So, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to ⟨stay home and then do\nresearch for lectures⟩ from \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\). Similarly,\nat \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to perform an act-set that terminates with\n⟨writing lecture notes⟩ at \\(t_3\\), given the assumption\nthat the act-set that would follow ⟨writing the lecture\nnotes⟩ at \\(t_3\\) is better than the act-set that would follow\n⟨fixing lunch⟩ at \\(t_3\\). \n\nThe application of\n (G*1)\n to the case of Jones explains why (G*1) does not imply the\npossibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations. Although what would\nhappen if Jones were to ⟨go to the faculty meeting⟩ at\n\\(t_2\\) is better than what would happen if she were to do anything\nelse at \\(t_2\\) that, as of \\(t_1\\), she can do, Jones is nevertheless\nnot obligated at \\(t_1\\) to ⟨go to the faculty\nmeeting⟩ at \\(t_2\\). This is because if Jones were to perform\none of the acts required for ⟨going to the faculty\nmeeting⟩, viz. ⟨going to the office⟩, then the\nworst outcome would occur. As of \\(t_1\\), any act that precludes\n⟨staying home⟩ at \\(t_1\\) is impermissible. \n\nJordan Howard Sobel (1976: 196) similarly defends a version of\nactualism that avoids jointly unfulfillable obligations: \nA life L is a sequence of acts over time, or, in the\nterminology of this article, an act-set over time, such that this\nact-set is not contained in some other act-set that an agent S\ncan perform over time. Hence, a life is identical to the\npossibilist’s notion of a maximal act-set. A life L is\nsecurable for S at time t if at \\(t\\) \\(S\\) can immediately\nperform the first moment of x, x is in L, and if\nx were to occur, then L would occur (Sobel 1976: 199).\nAn obligatory life is determined in part by the set of immediately\nperformable fully specific minimal acts available to the agent. A\nminimal act is one whose completion cannot be stopped by the agent\nonce it is initiated. As such, all instantaneous acts are minimal acts\n(if there are any such acts). Moreover, a minimal act is fully\nspecific just in case it is not entailed by two or more minimal acts\navailable to the agent. \nLike\n (G*1),\n and unlike\n (G),\n (S) does not imply that Jones ought to do the best she can over time\nin the sense affirmed by possibilists. This is because, according to\n(S), all lives that contain ⟨voting for the language\nrequirement⟩ are not securable for Jones at \\(t_1\\). At\n\\(t_1\\), there is no fully specific minimal act that Jones can\nimmediately perform such that if Jones were to perform it then Jones\nwould perform a sequence of acts that includes ⟨voting for the\nlanguage requirement⟩. Similarly, ⟨writing the\nreview⟩ is not securable for Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) because,\nat \\(t_1\\), there is no fully specific minimal act that Jones can\nimmediately perform such that, if Jones were to perform it, then Jones\nwould ⟨write the review⟩. \nIn contrast to the views of Goldman and Sobel, other forms of\nactualism embrace the possibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations\nwhile simultaneously resisting the claim that actualism implies the\npossibility of obligation dilemmas, i.e., scenarios in which all of\nthe options available to an agent over time result in a failure to\nfulfill at least one obligation. Consider Frank Jackson and Robert\nPargetter’s (1986: 233) formulation of actualism. \n[T]he values that should figure in determining which option is best\nand so ought to be done out of a set of options are the values of what\nwould be the case were the agent to adopt or carry out the\noption, where what would be the case includes of course what the agent\nwould simultaneously or subsequently in fact do: the (relevant) value\nof an option is the value of what would in fact be the case were the\nagent to perform it. \nJackson and Pargetter (1986: 244–245) maintain that there are\ndifferent sets of options out of which different obligations arise.\nFor instance, from the set of all \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-sets\navailable to Jones at \\(t_1\\), the option with the highest value\nconsists of the act-set that includes ⟨Jones’s voting for\nthe language requirement⟩ at \\(t_3\\). Therefore, out of the\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-set, at \\(t_1\\) Jones is obligated to\n⟨go to the office, then go to the faculty meeting, and then\nvote for the language requirement⟩. This is because what would\nhappen if this act-set were to occur is better than what would happen\nif some other \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_3\\) act-set were to occur. But on the\nother hand, from the set of immediately performable acts available to\nJones at \\(t_1\\), the option with the highest value consists of\nJones’ ⟨staying home⟩ because what would happen if\nJones were to ⟨stay home⟩ is better than what would\nhappen if Jones were to ⟨go to the office⟩. Therefore,\nout of the performable \\(t_1\\) acts, at \\(t_1\\) Jones is obligated to\n⟨stay home⟩. Like\n (G),\n Jackson and Pargetter’s view does not assess an act’s\ndeontic status in the procedural manner with which Goldman’s\n (G*1)\n or Sobel’s\n (S)\n assesses an act’s deontic status. Moreover, like (G), Jackson\nand Pargetter’s view implies the possibility of obligations that\ncannot be jointly fulfilled. We will henceforth refer to their view as\ncontextualist actualism because what an agent is obligated to do\ndepends on the set of options being considered within a certain\ncontext. \nThe possibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations initially seems\nto imply the possibility of obligation dilemmas, i.e., scenarios in\nwhich all of the options available to an agent over time result in a\nfailure to fulfill at least one obligation. But this is not the case\ngiven the assumption taken for granted in the actualist-possibilist\ndebate: that agents have control over the truth-value of certain\ncounterfactuals. In other words, agents can perform certain acts, and\nif they were to do so, then certain counterfactuals that are in fact\ntrue would instead be false. For example, Procrastinate can\n⟨agree to review the paper & then write the review⟩.\nIf she were to do this, then the following counterfactual that is\nfalse would be true instead: “If Procrastinate were to\n⟨agree to review the paper⟩, then she would\n⟨write the review⟩”. Moreover, if this\ncounterfactual were true, then Procrastinate would not be obligated to\n⟨decline to review the paper⟩. This is because, in this\ncounterfactual scenario, what would follow from ⟨declining to\nreview the paper⟩ would be worse than what would follow from\n⟨agreeing to review the paper⟩.  \nJackson and Pargetter rightly conclude from this that Procrastinate\ncan avoid violating any obligation because if Procrastinate\nwere to do something that she can do, viz. ⟨agree to review the\npaper & then write the review⟩, then Procrastinate\nwouldn’t be obligated to ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩ in the first place, and thus there would be no\nunfulfilled obligations (Jackson 1985: 194; Jackson & Pargetter\n1986: 242–243; Louise 2009: 330; Jackson 2014: 636). In this\nsense, according to contextualist actualism, the obligation to\n⟨agree to review the paper & then write the review⟩\noverrides the obligation to ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩. More generally, at time t an agent can do\nsomething over time such that, if it were done, then their primary\nobligation would be fulfilled, and the agent would not have any\nunfulfilled obligations from t onwards. Jackson and\nPargetter’s view is more similar to possibilism in comparison to\nstandard formulations of actualism insofar as Jackson and Pargetter\nagree with possibilists about an agent’s obligation to perform\nthe same maximal act-set. The difference between contextualist\nactualism and possibilism is that the former view affirms the\nexistence of additional obligations that arise from sets of options\nthat do not include this maximal act-set. \nJackson and Pargetter (1986: 246–249) believe that incompatible\nprescriptions are objectionable only when they arise from the same set\nof alternatives. But their view never generates incompatible\nprescriptions out of the same set of alternatives. Out of the set of\nalternatives of ⟨agreeing to review the paper⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\) or ⟨declining to review the paper⟩ at \\(t_1\\),\n⟨declining to review the paper⟩ is obligatory. But out\nof the \\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\) alternatives available to Procrastinate\nat \\(t_1\\), ⟨agreeing to review the paper and then writing the\nreview⟩ is the obligatory option. Hence, according to\ncontextualist actualism, as long as actualism does not prescribe\nincompatible obligations from the same set of alternatives,\nincompatible prescriptions are unproblematic. Still, one might object\nthat their view is not action-guiding in the sense that their theory\ndoes not say whether the overriding obligation takes priority over the\nother obligations (cf. Jackson 2014: 636). \nBy relativizing obligations to different sets of options,\ncontextualist actualism is subject to the so-called lumping problem.\nThis is the problem of lumping alternatives to an option O into\na single alternative (not-O) (Wedgwood 2009\n [Other Internet Resources, OIR];\n Ross 2012; Cariani 2016). Here is an example. Suppose that the\nfollowing increasingly worse options are available to an agent\nA: ⟨go to work⟩, ⟨gamble at home⟩,\n⟨kill someone at home⟩. Suppose furthermore that the\nfollowing four counterfactuals are true. \nIn that case, what would happen if A were to ⟨gamble at\nhome⟩ is better than what would happen if A were to\n⟨not gamble at home⟩. For, if A were to\n⟨not gamble at home⟩, then A would ⟨kill\nsomeone at home⟩. Now, when we consider A’s\noptions to be ⟨gambling at home⟩ or ⟨not gambling\nat home⟩, contextualist actualism implies that A ought\nto ⟨gamble at home⟩. This should seem very implausible,\neven by actualists’ own lights, because what would actually\nhappen if A were to ⟨go to work⟩ is better than\nwhat would happen if A were to make any other choice at the\ntime in question. Those who find this result counterintuitive have\nsuggested that an obligatory act O must have a higher value\nthan all of the non-supererogatory options available to the agent,\nrather than only having a higher value than not-O. In response\nto this worry, Jackson and Pargetter can remind us that it is also\ntrue that A ought to ⟨go to work⟩ out of a\ndifferent set options, viz. ⟨going to work⟩,\n⟨gambling at home⟩, and ⟨killing someone at\nhome⟩.  \nThe relativization of obligations to different sets of options has led\nJackson and Pargetter to reject the “ought distributes over\nconjunction” (ODC) principle (1986: 247). Recall that ODC holds\nthat if an agent S ought to do both A and B, then\nS ought to do A and S ought to do B\n(Castañeda 1968: 141). While they accept that Procrastinate\nought to ⟨agree to review the paper & then write the\nreview⟩, they deny that Procrastinate ought to ⟨agree to\nreview the paper⟩. Similarly, their view implies that Jones\nought to ⟨go to the office, then go to the faculty meeting, and\nthen vote for the language requirement⟩. However, Jones ought\nnot to ⟨go to the office⟩ since Jones ought to\n⟨stay home⟩. \nGoldman’s\n (G*1)\n and Sobel’s\n (S)\n enjoy the theoretical and practical virtue of simplicity by\nprescribing a single obligatory act sequence at a time rather than\nmultiple, jointly unfulfillable prescriptions at a time. But this\ntheoretical virtue comes at the cost of a possibilist objection: their\nviews allow agents to avoid incurring moral obligations simply in\nvirtue of having an imperfect moral character, and this allows agents\nto, morally speaking, get off the hook too easily (Jackson &\nPargetter 1986: 240; Zimmerman 1996: 193–194, 2006: 156;\nPortmore 2011: 207; Baker 2012: 642–43; Timmerman 2015;\nTimmerman & Cohen 2016; Cohen & Timmerman 2016). For example,\n\nProcrastinate avoids incurring an obligation to comment on a\nstudent’s paper simply because she is disposed to behave badly.\nActualism is committed to this even in cases in which an agent is\ndisposed to behave badly just because they intend to behave badly.\nBut, possibilists claim, agents cannot avoid incurring an obligation to \\(\\phi\\)\nsimply because they intend to \\(\\phi\\) poorly. More generally,\npossibilists claim that being disposed to do wrong does not allow one\nto avoid incurring obligations to do good. \nProponents of\n (G*1)\n or\n (S)\n may retort by reminding us that this apparently problematic\nimplication is the result of taking into account the relevant\ncounterfactuals, and that not taking them into account is too costly.\nWhile Procrastinate’s ⟨agreeing to review the\npaper⟩ is part of the best act-set that she can perform over\ntime, it is also part of the worst act-set that she can perform over\ntime, and the worst act-set would be performed if Procrastinate were\nto ⟨agree to review the paper⟩ (Jackson & Pargetter\n1986: 237). Similarly, Jones’ ⟨going to the\noffice⟩ is part of the best act-set that she can perform over\ntime, but it is also part of the worst act-set that she can perform\nover time, and the worst act-set would be performed if Jones were to\n⟨go to the office⟩. \nContextualist actualism can, in a sense, sidestep this possibilist\nobjection since contextual actualists agree with possibilists that an\nagent ought to do the best that she can over time, and, in addition,\nthey consider this obligation to override all other obligations in the\naforementioned sense (Jackson 1985: 194; Jackson & Pargetter 1986:\n242–243; Jackson 2014: 636). Possibilists may not be satisfied\nwith this response. Since possibilists accept ODC, they infer that\nProcrastinate is obligated to ⟨agree to review the\npaper⟩ from the fact that Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper & then write the review⟩.\nContextualist actualism denies that Procrastinate is obligated to\n⟨agree to review the paper⟩ at the cost of rejecting\nODC. \nAll of these versions of actualism face a second possibilist\nobjection: they prescribe bad behavior that the agent can easily avoid\n(Wedgwood 2009\n [OIR];\n Ross 2012: 75–76). For example, Procrastinate can easily avoid\n⟨declining to review the paper⟩ by ⟨agreeing to\nreview the paper⟩ and, once Procrastinate ⟨agrees to\nreview the paper⟩, she can easily ⟨write the\nreview⟩. Nevertheless, all of these versions of actualism\nmaintain that Procrastinate should ⟨decline to review the\npaper⟩ rather than ⟨agree to review the paper⟩.\nOther extreme actualist-possibilist scenarios highlight the force of\nthis objection. Suppose that the following act-set is the best one\navailable to a mass murderer M at \\(t_1\\): ⟨kill no\n\none⟩ at \\(t_1\\) and ⟨kill no one⟩ at \\(t_2\\).\n\nSuppose, however, that the best immediately available option for\nM is ⟨killing someone at \\(t_1\\)⟩ because of the\ntruth of the following two counterfactuals: “if M were to\n⟨kill someone⟩ at \\(t_1\\), then M would\n⟨kill no one⟩ at \\(t_2\\)”, “if M were\nto ⟨kill no one⟩ at \\(t_1\\), then M would\n⟨kill ten people⟩ at \\(t_2\\)”. Possibilists claim\nthat M should ⟨kill no one⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\) and thus that M should ⟨kill no\none⟩ at \\(t_1\\). Actualists, however, claim that M\nshould ⟨kill someone⟩ at \\(t_1\\). Contextualist\nactualism at least allows one to say that although ⟨killing\nsomeone⟩ at \\(t_1\\) is obligatory, doing this violates\nM’s obligation to ⟨kill no one⟩ from\n\\(t_1\\)–\\(t_2\\). Goldman and Sobel’s versions cannot\naccommodate this appeasing judgment. \nIt is worth noting that possibilism is thought to be subject to a\nrelated problem. While it doesn’t allow agents to avoid incurring\nmoral obligations for having a vicious moral character, it does allow\nagents to avoid incurring moral obligations to curtail their vicious\nmoral character (Timmerman and Swenson 2019). To illustrate the\nproblem, suppose that one of the optimific act-sets Apathetic Andy can\nperform over time includes ⟨playing video games tonight and\ndonating his expendable income to charity tomorrow⟩. Andy is,\nhowever, quite apathetic. As such, he won’t ⟨donate his\nexpendable income to charity tomorrow⟩ unless he first\n⟨reads work by Peter Singer tonight⟩. If he\n⟨plays video games tonight⟩, he will merely reinforce\nhis selfish nature and ⟨use his expendable income to purchase\nmore video games tomorrow⟩. Here’s the catch. The other\noptimific act-set Apathetic Andy can perform is to ⟨read work\nby Peter Singer tonight and donate his expendable income to charity\ntomorrow⟩. Moreover, if Andy ⟨reads work by Peter Singer\ntonight⟩, he would ⟨donate his expendable income to\ncharity tomorrow⟩. Performing this optimific act-set won’t be\npleasant for Andy, though, since he finds reading philosophy to be\ntedious. Here’s the problem. Possibilism renders the verdict that Andy\nis permitted to ⟨play video games tonight⟩, which would\nnot only result in a suboptimal outcome, but also exacerbate (rather\nthan curtail) his bad moral character. By contrast, actualism entails\nthat Andy is obligated to improve his moral character by\n⟨reading work by Peter Singer tonight⟩, and actualism\nthus ensures that Andy would ⟨donate his expendable income to\ncharity tomorrow⟩. So, both possibilism and actualism seem to\nlet agents with vicious moral characters off the hook too easily,\nalbeit in different circumstances and in different ways. \nIn the next section we will consider an additional objection to\nactualism that has led to the development of views that may be\nconsidered intermediaries of actualism and possibilism. According to\nthese views, a counterfactual is relevant to an agent’s present\nobligation only if the agent presently lacks a specific kind of\ncontrol over the truth-value of that counterfactual. \nRecall that the kinds of actualist-possibilist scenarios that we have\nbeen discussing—the cases of Professor Procrastinate\nand the case of Jones—are diachronic cases in the sense\nthat they concern different acts that are performed across different\nmoments of time, rather than at the same time. For example, in the\ncase of Professor Procrastinate, one of the relevant\ncounterfactuals is that if she were to ⟨agree to review the\npaper⟩ at \\(t_1\\), then she would ⟨not write the\nreview⟩ at \\(t_2\\). The act in the antecedent and the act in\nthe consequent are indexed to different times. On the surface, it may\nappear that a diachronic case would yield the same results as a\nsynchronic case, i.e., a case that involves the performance of\ndifferent acts at the same time. But as Goldman (1978) shows, a\nsynchronic actualist-possibilist scenario yields new difficulties for\nactualism, including Goldman’s (1976)\n (G*1),\n and the way to address these difficulties is by incorporating a\ncontrol condition over the truth-value of certain counterfactuals. \nConsider Goldman’s (1978: 186) case, which we’ll call\nTraffic 1: \nAccording to Goldman, it seems that Jones should\n⟨accelerate⟩ at t since Jones is going to\n⟨change lanes⟩ at t, and ⟨accelerating\n& changing lanes⟩ at t would result in a better\noutcome than that of ⟨not accelerating & changing\nlanes⟩. But now consider this case: \nIn Traffic 2 Jones ⟨changes lanes and doesn’t\naccelerate⟩ at t. It seems that Jones should ⟨not\nchange lanes⟩ at t since she is going to ⟨not\naccelerate⟩ at t. But it also seems that Jones should\n⟨accelerate⟩ at t since she is going to\n⟨change lanes⟩. We have arrived at the verdict that in\nTraffic 2 Jones should ⟨not change lanes⟩ and\nthat Jones should ⟨accelerate⟩. This verdict is\nextremely counterintuitive since this would result in colliding with\nthe back of the truck, which is the worst possible outcome.  \nAccording to Goldman, the lesson to be gleamed from synchronic\nactualist-possibilist cases is this: In determining what we are\nobligated at t to do at t, we should not hold fixed\nfacts about what we are freely doing at t. Moreover, such synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not determine in any way what an agent is obligated\nto do at any time. Consequently, the kind of immediate act-set that is\na candidate for being obligatory is the fully specific simultaneous\nact-set that is immediately available to Jones. A performable fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set is one such that one cannot also perform\nany other act-set at the relevant time. Goldman (1978: 190) calls such\nact-sets maximal conjunctive acts, but this entry will stick with the\nterminology of a fully specific simultaneous act-set in order\nto avoid ambiguation with other notions of act-sets at issue in this\npaper. Let’s suppose that the (immediate) fully specific\nsimultaneous act-sets available to Jones are ranked from best to worst\nas follows.  \nAccording to Goldman, given options (1)–(4), Jones should\nobviously perform (1). Moreover, notice that if Jones were to\nperform (1), then the following synchronic counterfactual that is in\nfact true in Traffic 2 would be false instead: “if\nJones were to ⟨not accelerate⟩ at t, then at\nt Jones would ⟨change lanes⟩”. So, given\nthe intuition that Jones is obligated to perform (1) and that doing so\nwould alter the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals, we\nshould not hold fixed the truth-value of such synchronic\ncounterfactuals when theorizing about an agent’s obligation to\nperform some immediate fully specific simultaneous act-set. To\naccommodate this judgment, Goldman’s (1978) revised view\nincorporates a control condition over the truth-value of such\nsynchronic counterfactuals. \nGoldman’s revised view still adopts the insight behind\n (G*1)\n that, in order to avoid the possibility of jointly unfulfillable\nobligations, an obligatory act-set (or, as Goldman calls it, a sequence\nof acts) must be such that it would occur if the agent were to\nimmediately perform the first act of the act-set, and the agent can\nperform this first act of the act-set. Goldman’s revised view\n(1978: 202) is referred to as “4”, but we will refer to\nit as (G+) here: \n\nUnlike\n (G*1) ,\n Goldman’s revised view requires the first act to be a fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set. Moreover, the kind of act-set that\nshould be directly assessed is a maximal sequence. S\nhas the ability at \\(t_1\\) to perform X only if S has\nthe ability at \\(t_1\\) to immediately (at \\(t_1)\\) perform the first\nfully specific simultaneous act-set in \\(X.\\) Goldman’s (1978:\n201) notion of a maximal sequence is different from the\npossibilist’s aforementioned notion of a maximal act-set which\nextends to the end of one’s life. For, according to Goldman\n(1978: 193–195), at t an agent can perform an act-set\nover time if and only if, if at t the agent wanted to perform\nthis act-set, then the agent would do so over time. This implies that\nthe performable act-set over time must be such that the agent can, at\nt, form an intention to perform this act-set over time that\nwould be causally efficacious if the intention were formed.\nGoldman’s notion of a maximal sequence is thus more restricted.\nThat is, a maximal sequence X is an act-set available to an\nagent at t is such that, at t, the agent can form an\nintention to perform X, and no other act-set that at t\nthe agent can intend to perform is a proper part of X. So,\nhenceforth, we will refer to Goldman’s notion of a maximal\nsequence as an intentionally maximal act-set, and this is to\nbe distinguished from a maximal act-set. \nRecall that, according to Ability 2, an agent S has\nthe ability to immediately perform the first fully specific act-set in\nan intentionally maximal act-set if and only if S would perform\nthis fully specific act-set if S wanted to do so, and by\nextension we may assume Jones can perform each of (1)–(4). Under\nthis assumption,\n (G+)\n implies that although Jones would ⟨change lanes⟩ if she\nwere to ⟨not accelerate⟩, Jones nevertheless ought to do\nsomething that requires her to ⟨not accelerate⟩, viz.\n⟨not change lanes & not accelerate⟩. To see how (G+)\ndiffers from the versions of actualism in\n section 3,\n consider the following version of Professor\nProcrastinate: \nAccording to\n (G+)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform an intentionally\nmaximal act-set M that includes ⟨accepting the request\nand commenting⟩ because there is an immediate fully specific\nact-set available to Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) such that if it were\nperformed then M would occur, and M is the best\nintentionally maximal act-set that is securable for Procrastinate at\n\\(t_1\\). By contrast, according to\n (G*1)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to ⟨not accept the\nrequest⟩ because this would result in the performance of\nact-set M* that includes ⟨not commenting⟩ at\n\\(t_2\\), and M* is better than the act-set M** that\nwould occur if Procrastinate were to ⟨accept the\nrequest⟩ at \\(t_1\\) because M** includes\n⟨accepting & not commenting⟩. \nOne might suspect that a modified version of\n (G*1)\n that focuses exclusively upon decisions rather than overt bodily acts\ncan handle synchronic actualist-possibilist cases, such as\nProfessor Procrastinate*. But this isn’t so because it\nis possible for the following two counterfactuals to be true: \nEven though (i) is true, the best thing that Procrastinate can do\ninvolves ⟨deciding to accept the request⟩, viz.\n⟨deciding to accept the request & commenting⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\). This shows that whether we assess an agent’s\nobligations in terms of decisions or overt bodily acts, the acts that\nare to be directly assessed are fully specific simultaneous act-sets,\nwhich is precisely what\n (G+)\n accomplishes. \nContextualist actualism and Goldman’s provisional but rejected\nprinciple\n (G)\n similarly imply that Jones is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform (1)\nrather than any of (2)–(4) since these views permit a\ncandidate obligatory act to be fully specific. But these views do not\nrequire a candidate obligatory act to be fully specific, and\nthus these views also have the peculiar implication that in\nTraffic II Jones is obligated to ⟨accelerate⟩\nand Jones is obligated to ⟨not change lanes⟩. \nThus far, we have seen that synchronic actualist-possibilist cases\nsuggest that, first and foremost, an agent has an obligation to\nperform a fully specific immediate act rather than a\nless-than-fully-specific immediate act. As a result, synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not even partly determine an agent’s\nobligation to perform some fully specific immediate act. This still\nleaves open a question about the ability that an agent must possess in\norder to be able to perform some immediate (fully specific) act in the\nrelevant sense. Goldman’s (1978: 195, 204–205) Ability\n2, for instance, is a version of the conditional analysis of\nabilities. The conditional analysis of abilities remains suspect by\nsome on the grounds that an agent does not have direct control over\ntheir desires. Given this, one may infer that facts about what an\nagent would do if she had different desires is irrelevant to her\nabilities (Lehrer 1968; Curran 1995: 82). Nevertheless, since many\nparticipants in the actualist-possibilist debate take for granted that\nthe ability to do otherwise is compatible with facts about what an\nagent will do or would do under certain circumstances, a number of\npeople have followed Goldman (1978) by taking the relevant kind of\ncontrol to be one that does not hold fixed all facts about the\nagent’s psychological makeup. See, for instance, the views of\nDoug Portmore (2011) and Jacob Ross (2012). \nPortmore (2011) understands the relevant kind of control an agent must\nhave over an option in terms of scrupulous securability. A\nset of acts (i.e., an act-set) is scrupulously securable by an agent\nonly if there is some set of intentions and some set of permissible\nbackground attitudes (including beliefs and desires), such that if the\nagent had these intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform\nthat act-set (2011: 165). The sorts of attitudes Portmore (2011: 167)\nhas in mind are judgment-sensitive attitudes, i.e., attitudes that are\nsensitive to judgments about reasons (Scanlon 1998: 20).  \nThis form of control is similar to the conditional analysis insofar as\nthe agent does not need to possess the relevant intentions and\nattitudes required to perform an act in order to have an ability to\nperform that act. It just has to be the case that if the agent were to\nhave such intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform the\nrelevant act. Portmore’s (2011: 166–167) exact account of\ncontrol is as follows: \nA set of acts, \\(α_j\\), is, as of \\(t_i\\), scrupulously\nsecurable by S if and only if there is a time, \\(t_j\\), that\neither immediately follows \\(t_i\\) or is identical to \\(t_i\\), a set\nof acts, \\(α_i\\), (where \\(α_i\\) may, or may not, be\nidentical to \\(α_j\\)), and a set of background attitudes,\nB, such that the following are all true: (1) S would\nperform \\(α_j\\) if S were to have at \\(t_i\\) both\nB and the intention to perform \\(α_i\\); (2) S has\nat \\(t_i\\) the capacity to continue, or to come, to have at \\(t_j\\)\nboth B and the intention to perform \\(α_i\\); and (3)\nS would continue, or come, to have at \\(t_j\\) B (and,\nwhere \\(α_i\\) is not identical to \\(α_j\\), the intention\nto perform \\(α_i\\) as well) if S both were at \\(t_i\\)\naware of all the relevant reason-constituting facts and were at\n\\(t_j\\) to respond to these facts/reasons in all and only the ways\nthat they prescribe, thereby coming to have at \\(t_j\\) all those\nattitudes that, given those facts, she has decisive reason to have and\nonly those attitudes that she has, given those facts, sufficient\nreason to have. \nPortmore (2011: 177) understands a set of acts \\(α_j\\) to be a\nmaximal act-set in a similar vein to both a possibilist’s notion\nof a maximal act-set and Sobel’s notion of a life. The set of\nacts “\\(α_i\\)” is not identical to\n“\\(α_j\\)” when, e.g., one lacks the ability at\n\\(t_j\\) to form an intention to perform “\\(α_j\\)”,\nalthough the agent would in fact perform \\(α_j\\) if the agent\nwere to form at \\(t_j\\) the intention to perform \\(α_i\\). For\nexample, earning a PhD may be presently scrupulously securable for an\nagent, although she is presently unable to form an intention to do all\nof the things that are required to attain a PhD at least because she\ncannot presently intend to write about an idea in her dissertation\nthat she has not yet studied (Portmore 2011: 169). So, whenever\n\\(α_j\\) and \\(α_i\\) are not identical, part (1) says that\nS would perform some act-set if S were to intend to\nperform some other act-set (along with certain background\nattitudes). \nPart (2) of the above definition states that an agent must have a\ncapacity (or an ability) to have certain attitudes and intentions.\nThis allows one to sidestep the difficulties that have been posed for\nthe conditional analysis of abilities (cf. Portmore 2011: 168). Part\n(3) states that the agent’s attitudes must be permissible. To\nillustrate, suppose that the only way in which Doug can ensure at 2 pm\nthat he will eat a healthy meal rather than pizza at 6 pm is by having\nthe irrational belief that his life depends upon eating a healthy meal\nat 6 pm. Since it seems that he is not obligated to have such a\nbelief, it follows that, at 2 pm, Doug is not obligated to eat a\nhealthy meal at 6 pm since there is no combination of intentions and\npermissible attitudes (as opposed to impermissible attitudes) that\nDoug can have at 2 pm, such that if he were to have them at 2 pm then\nhe would eat a healthy meal at 6 pm (Portmore 2011:\n164–165). \nPortmore (2011: 222) pairs this notion of control with the following\naccount of rational permissibility that applies to moral\npermissibility when there are moral reasons to act: \nSecuritism employs a top-down approach by using normative principles\nto directly assess the deontic status of maximal act-sets and then\nextending the same deontic status to non-maximal act-sets that are\ncontained in the relevant maximal act-set (Portmore 2011: 179). This\napproach reaps the benefits of Goldman’s\n (G+)\n of avoiding jointly unfulfillable obligations and of denying that any\nsynchronic counterfactuals even partly determine an agent’s\nobligations. \nPortmore’s securitism—and by extension other views that\nhold fixed facts that are not presently up to the agent in some\nsense—has been criticized on the grounds that it does not\ngenerate an obligation to do the best one can in the sense at issue in\nAbility 1, and thus securitism sometimes requires agents to\nperform terrible and vicious acts, and it allows one to avoid\nincurring an obligation in light of vicious or immoral dispositions\n(Timmerman 2015; Vessel 2016). \nRoss (2012: 84) similarly maintains that an agent can immediately\nperform an act that requires some attitude that the agent does not in\nfact have, although Portmore’s and Ross’s views diverge in\ncertain cases. Here is Ross’s view (2012: 91): \nIn essence, MWSS is the view that “at any given time, an agent\nis obligated, at every future time, to be currently satisfying a\nwide-scope version” of Smith’s\n (G+)\n or Portmore’s securitism (Ross 2012: 91). Ross believes that\nonly MWSS can account for each of the four conditions of his core idea\n(2012: 89, 91). \nTo see how these views diverge, consider the following case which is\nsimilar to a case described by Ross (2012: 87–88): at \\(t_1\\)\nSally has the ability to immediately form an intention to ⟨not\nkill anyone five years later at \\(t_5\\)⟩, although\n⟨killing no one at \\(t_5\\)⟩ is not scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). On the other hand, killing exactly one\nperson or killing exactly two persons at \\(t_5\\) are both scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). According to Portmore’s\nsecuritism, one of the objectively morally permissible maximal set of\nacts that is scrupulously securable by Sally at \\(t_1\\) involves\nkilling one person at \\(t_5\\). However, at \\(t_5\\), not killing anyone\nis scrupulously securable for Sally, and thus at \\(t_5\\) Sally is\nobligated to not kill anyone at \\(t_5\\). These stipulations in\nRoss’s case are derived from the fact that at \\(t_1\\) Sally has\nan impeccable moral character that will be corrupted through no fault\nof her own (by being kidnapped by Satanists). But her moral character\nis not corrupted to such an extent that she is unable at \\(t_5\\) to\nrefrain from killing anyone. To emphasize, at \\(t_1\\) the best\nefficacious intention that Sally can form involves killing one person\nat \\(t_5\\) whereas at \\(t_5\\) the best efficacious intention that\nSally can form involves killing no one at \\(t_5\\). Portmore’s\nsecuritism thus prescribes an act at some future time, but then does\nnot prescribe that act once that time is present. \nRoss (2012: 87–89) wishes to avoid this implication.\n MWSS\n does not imply that at \\(t_1\\) Sally is obligated to kill exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) because whether Sally kills exactly one person at\n\\(t_5\\) causally depends upon her intentions at \\(t_1\\). So, Sally\nsatisfies the following conditional by not satisfying the first part\nof the antecedent: (if whether Sally refrains from killing exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) does not causally depend on the intentions she will\nhave after \\(t_1\\), and if all her maximally preferable, directly\nsecurable options involve killing exactly one person at \\(t_5\\), then\nshe kills exactly one person at \\(t_5)\\). Instead, MWSS implies that\nat \\(t_1\\) (and at \\(t_5)\\) Sally is obligated not to kill anyone\nbecause she satisfies the following conditional only by satisfying its\nconsequent: (if whether Sally kills no one at \\(t_5\\) does not\ncausally depend on the intentions she will have after \\(t_5\\), and if\nall her maximally preferable, directly securable options involve not\nkilling anyone at \\(t_5\\), then she kills no one at \\(t_5)\\). \nA proponent of securitism may reply that there’s simply nothing\nSally can do at \\(t_1\\) that allows her to secure not killing anyone\nat \\(t_5\\), and thus having an obligation at \\(t_1\\) not to kill\nanyone at \\(t_5\\) concedes too much to possibilism. For, one of the\ncore intuitions driving securitist views is that we should treat our\nnon-securable futures in the same way we treat the futures of other\nagents; we should hold such futures fixed when determining our present\nmoral obligations. This thought has led to an expansive discussion of\nthe way in which actualist-possibilist scenarios raise fundamental\nquestions about agency and how we are to conceive of our present\nselves in relation to our future selves (Louise 2009; Baker 2012). \nThe discussion up until this point has centered around making sense of\nthe general notion that an agent ought to do the (non-supererogatory)\nbest that she is able to do. But some theories hold that an\nagent’s moral life is more complex than this because an\nagent’s ability to do less than the (non-supererogatory) best is\nalso obligatory is some non-primary sense. This approach is motivated\nin part by the thought that some wrong actions are better than others.\nMichael McKinsey (1979: 391–392) develops this approach,\ndefending a view with multiple levels of obligation. His view may be\nformulated as follows: \nLevels of Obligation (LO): \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is a life\nsequence from t for x. Every \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) has a rank\n\\(n (n \\ge 1)\\) relative to every other life-sequence from t\nfor x, where n is a positive integer. If \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\)\nis among the optimum life sequences from t for x, then\nthe rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 1\\); if \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is among the second\nbest such sequences, then the rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 2\\); and so on.\nx ought\\(_n\\) at t to do \\(A_i\\) iff: \nWhile McKinsey’s formulation of (LO) is rather complicated, the\nbasic idea is quite simple. According to (LO), an agent\nS’s primary obligation is identical to the obligation\nthat possibilists believe S has. Additionally, for every\nmaximal act-set M (or a life) that, at t, S can\nperform, if M is not identical to the best maximal act-set\nthat, at t, S can perform, but is better than the\nmaximal act-set that S will in fact perform, then at t\nS has a moral obligation to perform M. To illustrate,\nconsider this case: \n\n (LO)\n implies that there are three levels of obligations that Ben fails to\nfulfill: his primary obligation to refrain from pressing any button,\nhis secondary obligation to press the first button, and his tertiary\nobligation to press the second button. If Ben were to instead press\nthe second button, then Ben would have failed to fulfill only two\nobligations, viz. the primary obligation to refrain from pressing a\nbutton, and the secondary obligation to press the first button.  \nMcKinsey’s\n (LO)\n is, in one sense, in agreement with possibilism because an\nagent’s primary obligation is identical to a possibilist\nobligation. Moreover, even though (LO) can generate jointly\nunfulfillable obligations, (LO) agrees with Jackson and\nPargetter’s contextualist actualism that if, in the terminology\nof (LO), an agent fulfills her primary obligation, then it’s not\nthe case that the agent violates any non-primary obligations because\nthe agent simply does not have any non-primary obligations. For\nexample, if Ben refrains from pressing any button, then according to\n(LO) it’s not the case that Ben had a secondary obligation to\npress the first button, and thus no non-primary obligations are\nviolated. McKinsey’s (LO) is, in a sense, also in agreement with\n(non-contextualist) versions of actualism. For example,\nProcrastinate’s obligation according to non-contextualist\nversions of actualism is to ⟨decline to review the paper &\nnot review the paper⟩, and, according to McKinsey, this is\nProcrastinate’s secondary obligation because this act-sequence\nis the second best maximal act-sequence (or a part of the second best\nmaximal act-sequence) that Procrastinate can perform over time.  \nGoldman (1978: 205–208) holds that there are exactly two orders\nof obligations, one primary and one secondary, and that it is better\nto fulfill one’s secondary obligation rather than to violate\nboth obligations. Primary obligations are governed by Goldman’s\n (G+),\n and secondary obligations are governed by principles such as\nGoldman’s (1976)\n (G*1)\n which, as we have seen in\n section 4,\n does not take into account an agent’s moral character that\ndetermines the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals. For\nexample, in the case of Professor Procrastinate*,\nProcrastinate’s primary obligation is to ⟨agree to review\nthe paper & review the paper⟩ because there is an\nimmediately performable, fully specific simultaneous act-set such\nthat, if performed, would result in ⟨agreeing & reviewing\nthe paper⟩. By contrast, Procrastinate’s secondary\nobligation is to ⟨decline to review the paper & not review\nthe paper⟩ because Procrastinate’s moral character is\nsuch that if Procrastinate were to ⟨agree to review⟩ at\n\\(t_1\\), then Procrastinate would harm the student by falsely\npromising to review at \\(t_2\\). Procrastinate’s moral character\nis taken into account by her secondary obligation, but not her primary\nobligation. As Goldman (1986: 205) notes, it is sometimes useful to\nreason in a way that holds fixed our actual moral character, and\npositing secondary obligations allows us to reason in this way.\nZimmerman (1986: 70) also subscribes to non-primary obligations and\nmotivates this position in part on the basis of considerations about\ndetachment and conditional obligations. \nThe issues raised by the actualist/possibilist debate are relevant for\na number of other debates in philosophy as well. As has already been\ndiscussed, whether actualism, possibilism, or some intermediary view\nis correct has direct import for various principles in deontic logic,\nthe correct formulation of act-consequentialism, and for analogous\nquestions in the philosophy of action. The actualism/possibilism\ndebate, however, is perhaps most closely connected to the\nmaximalism/omnism debate. These debates are deeply interrelated. While\nboth concern questions about the scope of the agent’s options,\nthe maximalism/omnism debate focuses on certain questions about how to\nassess these options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about whether\nall options should be assessed in terms of their own goodness, or\nwhether some options should be assessed in relation to the goodness of\nother options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about which facts\nground the reasons to perform the relevant options and, as will be\nillustrated shortly, are concerned with a wider range of cases than\nthose in the actualism/possibilism debate. \nThe maximalism/omnism debate concerns cases where the performance of\none option entails (or implies) the performance of another. Cases such\nas Professor Procrastinate are but one example.\nProcrastinate’s ⟨accepting the invitation and writing the\nreview⟩ entails ⟨accepting the invitation⟩. Not\nall examples share Procrastinate’s structure, however. Many\nexamples concern different ways of performing the same option in\ndifferent (e.g., more or less precise, better or worse) ways. For\ninstance, ⟨drinking a Coke⟩ entails ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩, ⟨visiting Uppsala⟩ entails\n⟨visiting Sweden⟩, and ⟨kicking someone very\nhard⟩ entails ⟨kicking someone⟩. \nNow, the central question in the debate concerns how the moral\nproperties of an option O are related to the moral properties\nof the options entailed by performing O. This abstract question\ncan be made clearer by considering an example. Suppose that I have\ngood reason to ⟨drink a soda⟩ and good reason to\n⟨drink a Coke⟩. Those in the maximalism/omnism debate\nare interested in whether the reason I have for performing one these\noptions grounds the reason I have for performing the other. Is it the\ncase that I have reason to ⟨drink a soda⟩ in virtue of\nmy having reason to ⟨drink a Coke⟩ or vice versa? Or is\nthere no grounding relation between my reason(s) to perform these\noptions? \nOmnists hold that all options should be directly assessed in terms of\ntheir own goodness. Omnism may be defined more precisely as\nfollows. \nIn this debate, a maximal option is simply understood as one that is\nnot entailed by any other option, aside from itself (Brown 2018: 752).\nMore precisely, a maximal option may be understood as “an option\nthat is maximally normatively specific in the sense that it is\nentailed only by normatively equivalent options”, where two\noptions are normatively equivalent if and only if they are equivalent\nin terms of all of the normatively relevant considerations (Portmore\n2017a: 428, 2017b: 2955). Any option that is not a maximal option will\nbe a non-maximal option. \nTo illustrate, suppose that hedonistic act-utilitarianism is true. To\nkeep things simple, suppose that the maximal options available to an\nagent S are ⟨drink a Coke⟩, ⟨drink nothing\nwhile smiling⟩, ⟨drink nothing while frowning⟩,\nand ⟨drink a Pepsi⟩. Suppose furthermore that\n⟨drinking a Coke⟩ would generate 5 hedons,\n⟨drinking nothing while smiling⟩ would generate 1 hedon,\n⟨drinking nothing while frowning⟩ would generate 0\nhedons, and ⟨drinking a Pepsi⟩ would generate 10 dolors\n(or −10 hedons). The non-maximal options available to S\ninclude ⟨drinking a soda⟩ and ⟨drinking\nnothing⟩. Finally, suppose that the following counterfactuals\nare true. \nAccording to omnism, whether it is permissible for S to\n⟨drink a soda⟩ depends on whether ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩ would result in maximizing hedonic utility. Given the\ntruth of (1), it wouldn’t, so omnism entails that\n⟨drinking a soda⟩ is wrong. Likewise, according to\nomnism, whether it is permissible for S to ⟨drink a\nCoke⟩ depends on whether S’s ⟨drinking a\nCoke⟩ would result in maximizing hedonic utility. It does, so\nomnism entails that ⟨drinking a Coke⟩ is permissible\n(and obligatory). \nUnlike omnists, maximalists hold that only maximal options should be\nassessed in terms of their own goodness. They believe that all\nnon-maximal options should only be assessed in terms of the goodness\nof the relevant maximal options of which they are a part. Maximalism\nmay be defined more precisely as follows. \nAssuming hedonistic act-utilitarianism once again, according to\nmaximalism, the deontic status of the maximal options depends on the\noutcome of performing each option. According to maximalism, then,\n⟨drinking a Coke⟩ would be obligatory and every other\nmaximal option would be impermissible. So, with respect to maximal\noptions, maximalism and omnism generate the same deontic verdicts. But\nnow consider what maximalists say about non-maximal options. This is\nthe point of contention between maximalists and omnists. By contrast\nwith the omnist’s ascription of wrongness to ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩, the maximalist holds that ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩ is obligatory. This is because the obligatory maximal\noption is ⟨drink a Coke⟩ and S cannot perform the\nmaximal option of ⟨drinking a Coke⟩ without performing\nthe non-maximal option of ⟨drinking a soda⟩. The\nnon-maximal act ⟨drink nothing⟩, on the other hand, is\nentailed by an impermissible act, namely ⟨drink nothing while\nsmiling⟩. So, maximalism entails that ⟨drinking\nnothing⟩ is impermissible. \nInterestingly, omnism has typically been assumed in the literature. It\nmay have only operated as an unquestioned background assumption until\nthe groundbreaking work of Bergström (1966) and Castañeda\n(1968). Goldman (1978) and Bykvist (2002) defend distinct variants of\nmaximalism. Since then, there have been a few arguments against\nmaximalism (cf. Gustafsson 2014). Omnism seems to be considered the\ndefault position, though new arguments against omnism and in favor of\nmaximalism have started to appear in the literature recently (Portmore\n2017a,b, forthcoming; Brown 2018). Much of the debate revolves around\ntheProblem of Act Versions. Following Brown (2018: 754) and\nPortmore (forthcoming: ch. 4), this problem may be explained by\nconsidering the following three jointly inconsistent principles. \n\nEach of these principles seems quite plausible when considered in\nisolation. Principle (1) simply holds that an agent ought to perform\nthe best option available to her. Assuming hedonistic\nact-utilitarianism, the best option(s) will be whichever one(s)\nmaximize(s) hedonic utility. Principle (2) holds that if an agent is\nobligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\),\nthen she is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\). So, if an\nagent is obligated to ⟨drink a Coke⟩ and\n⟨drinking a Coke⟩ entails ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩, then that agent is obligated to ⟨drink a\nsoda⟩.  \nPrinciple (3) holds that there are cases where an agent\nS’s obligatory option (e.g., a maximal option) entails\nanother option (e.g., a non-maximal option) that, if performed, would\nnot result in S performing the obligatory maximal\noption. Performing the best option of ⟨drinking a Coke⟩\nentails that S ⟨drink a soda⟩. But what would in\nfact happen if S were to ⟨drink a soda⟩ is that\nS would ⟨drink a Pepsi⟩ and ⟨drinking a\nPepsi⟩ is not S’s best option. That is, in fact,\nthe worst option. \nMaximalists have objected to omnism on the grounds that it, in\nconjunction with (2) and (3), entails a contradiction (Portmore\nforthcoming: ch. 4). Given omnism, S is obligated to\n⟨drink a Coke⟩ because performing that act is\nS’s best option. S’s ⟨drinking a\nCoke⟩ entails S’s ⟨drinking a soda⟩.\nSo, given (2), S is also obligated to ⟨drink a\nsoda⟩. However, recall that this case illustrates principle\n(3). If S were to ⟨drink a soda⟩, S would\n⟨drink a Pepsi⟩. Given this, ⟨drinking a\nsoda⟩ would not result in S performing her best option.\nSo, omnism also entails that it is impermissible for S to\n⟨drink a soda⟩. Hence the contradiction. Omnism combined\nwith (2) and (3) entail both that S is obligated to\n⟨drink a soda⟩ and that it’s impermissible for\nS to ⟨drink a soda⟩. To avoid this contradiction,\nomnists must give up (2) or (3). Omnists such as Jackson and Pargetter\nhave given up (2). \nMaximalists reject omnism, which allows them to consistently accept\n(2) and (3), principles thought to have strong independent motivation.\nMaximalists, then, give up (1) to avoid the contradiction. According\nto the maximalist, sometimes agents are obligated to perform\nnon-maximal options (e.g., ⟨drink a soda⟩) that are not\ntheir best option in virtue of the fact that they are obligated to\nperform their best maximal option (e.g., ⟨drink a Coke⟩)\nand performing their best maximal option entails performing a\nsuboptimal non-maximal option. In short, the maximalist responds to\nthe Problem of Act Versions by giving up (1), while omnists\nrespond by giving up (2). As may already be clear, some motivations\nfor, and against, omnism parallel those of actualism, while some\nmotivations for, and against, maximalism parallel those of securitism\nand possibilism. Whichever considerations settle one of these debates\nwill likely settle (or at least significantly bear on) the other. \nThe actualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate in ethics\ngrew out of a debate concerning the problem that identifying act\nalternatives poses for act-consequentialism. The debate, in its\npresent form, may be traced back to the work of Holly Goldman’s\nand Jordan Howard Sobel’s independent articulations, and\ndefenses of, actualism. Early forms of actualism held that whether an\nagent is obligated to perform an act roughly depends on whether what\nwould happen if the agent performed that act is better than\nwhat would happen if the agent were to perform any alternative act at\nthe time in question. Contrast this with possibilism, which holds that\nwhether an agent is obligated to perform an act depends on whether\nthat act is part of the best maximal act-set the agent could\n(not would) perform over the course of her life. These are\nthe “extreme” versions of actualism and possibilism\nrespectively. To handle cases concerning synchronic acts, and to avoid\nhaving her view prescribe incompatible obligations, Goldman amended\nactualism by building a control condition into the definition in her\n(1978) essay. This revised actualism,\n (G+),\n along with Sobel’s\n (S),\n only holds fixed the acts of an agent that are not presently under\nthe agent’s control. This change proved influential and inspired\nvarious versions of this view, which came to be collectively referred\nto as securitism. Securitist views occupy a middle ground between\n“extreme” forms of actualism and possibilism. A variety of\nother views do too, including McKinsey’s (1979)\nlevels-of-obligation view and Carlson’s (1995, 1999) view. There\nis not yet a consensus about which view, if any, is the most\nplausible. Of course, this should not be surprising since the\nactualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate is,\nrelatively speaking, still quite new.","contact.mail":"yishai.cohen@maine.edu","contact.domain":"maine.edu"}]
