Moreover, his name has been associated with\nan aestheticization of philosophy, an illegitimate valorizing of the\nmedieval, and a politically reactionary program. This view of von\nHardenberg, however, is to a large extent rooted in the image created\nposthumously by his increasingly conservative friends within the\nromantic circle. Furthermore, von Hardenberg’s philosophical\nreputation has been shaped by his critics, the most prominent of whom\nwas Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\n\nIn spite of his death at 28, von Hardenberg (1772–1801) left\nbehind a complex philosophical legacy that encompasses discussions of\nsubjectivity and self-consciousness, issues in epistemology, moral\ntheory, political philosophy, problems of interpretation, philosophy\nof history, philosophy of religion, the proto-existentialist\nexperience of the finality of human life, as well as a significant\ncontribution to aesthetics and philosophy of art. While von Hardenberg\nis best known for his literary production—including the prose\npoem Hymns to the Night (1800) and the unfinished novels\nThe Apprentice from Said and Heinrich von\nOfterdingen (both published in 1802)—this overview focuses\non the argumentative presuppositions for and systematic implications\nof von Hardenberg’s philosophical work (without thereby\nsuggesting that his philosophy should be perceived as entirely\nseparate from his poetic production).\n\nFriedrich von Hardenberg was born into a family descending from the\nlower-Saxon nobility and spent most of his childhood on the family\nestate of the Oberwiederstedt manor. His father, Heinrich Ulrich\nErasmus von Hardenberg, was the manager of a salt mine and was known\nas a pietist and member of the Herrenhuter (Moravian) Church. His\nsecond wife, Auguste Bernhardine von Hardenberg (neé von Bölzig),\ngave birth to eleven children, the second of whom was Friedrich. After\nhis initial studies with a private tutor, von Hardenberg went on to\nthe Lutheran grammar school in Eisleben, where he, in line with the\ngeneral educational guidelines at the time, concentrated in rhetoric\nand ancient literature. From the age of twelve, he moved to the home\nof his uncle, Gottlob Friedrich Wilhelm von Hardenberg, who is said to\nhave taken an interest in French enlightenment philosophy. Von\nHardenberg later studied law in Jena, Leipzig, and Wittenberg. He\npassed his final exams in 1794 and moved on to work in the Prussian\ncivil service in Tennstedt, where he also met the young Sophie von\nKühn. The two got secretly engaged in 1795. Two years later, Sophie\ntragically died at the age of fifteen, an event that would move a\nwhole generation of poets and artists in Germany, including Goethe.\nJust prior to Sophie’s death, Novalis, following in his\nfather’s footsteps, commenced his studies of mining in Freiberg,\nSaxony, and eventually took up an administrative position at the salt\nmines in Weißenfels. Throughout this period, he would retain his\ninterest in philosophy, but also explore subjects such as medicine,\ngeology, and biology. He advanced to director of the salt mines and\nbecame engaged for a second time. \nFrom his period as a student in Jena onwards, von Hardenberg was well\nconnected with the dominant intellectual circles of the time. He was\nacquainted with Goethe, Fichte, Hölderlin, Herder, and Jean Paul\n(Richter), and made close friends with Ludwig Tieck, the Schlegel\nbrothers, Schelling, and Schiller (whose lectures he attended in\n1790). Friedrich von Hardenberg died of tuberculosis in March\n1801. \nVon Hardenberg did not publish much during his lifetime. His first\npublication, emerging in 1791 in Christoph Martin Wieland’s\nNeuem Teutschen Merkur, was the poem “Klagen eines\nJünglings”. In 1798, he published Pollen\n(Blüthenstaub), a collection of 114 aesthetic-philosophical\nfragments and reflections, in the first issue of the\nAthenaeum. The text was edited by Friedrich Schlegel, and\nNovalis’s Miscellaneous Observations is as close as we\nget to a final version from his hand. Only one other collection of\nfragments was published during his lifetime, the controversial\nFaith and Love, also from 1798. In 1799, Novalis finished his\npolitical-religious tract, Christianity or Europe, which\nremained unpublished until after the author’s death. A year\nlater emerged the famous lyrical cycle Hymns to the Night.\nThe rest of his writing consists mainly of posthumously published\nnotes and sketches, including Notes for a Romantic\nEncyclopaedia (Das Allgemeine Brouillon, 1798/99),\nstudies of Fichte (1795/96), Kant (1797), and Franz Hemsterhuis\n(1797). The pen name Novalis—referring back to an old family\nname while, all the same, conveying the meaning of “the one who\nclears new ground”—was initially introduced in\n1798. \nAfter Novalis’s death, his work was first edited by Tieck and\nFriedrich Schlegel and, subsequently, published in a number of\ndifferent editions. Since 2006, his complete work has been available\nin a six volume historical-critical edition (of which the first volume\nwas launched in 1960), edited by Paul Kluckhohn, Richard Samuel,\nHans-Joachim Mähl, and Gerhard Schulz, which provides a more adequate\npicture of Novalis’s philosophical reflections than the previous\neditions, helpfully distinguishes between complete and incomplete\ntexts, and offers a valuable apparatus of historical-philological\nfootnotes and commentaries. \nIn spite of its momentous impact in the history of Western art and\nthinking, early romantic philosophy lasted for only a short period of\ntime, and is commonly dated to the few years between 1797 and 1801,\nor, in some cases, the period between 1794 and 1808. With its initial\ncenter of gravity in Jena, the famous university town and intellectual\npowerhouse of the time, the romantic circle soon moved its foothold to\nBerlin, whose vivid salon scene offered welcoming new quarters.\nThroughout this period, the early romantic movement evolved around the\nwork of Ludwig Tieck, the Schlegel-brothers Friedrich and August\nWilhelm, as well as the philosopher and classicist Friedrich\nSchleiermacher and the jurist and writer Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder.\nAmong the inner circle were also Caroline Schelling (married to August\nWilhelm Schlegel, later to Schelling), Dorothea Schlegel (married to\nthe banker Simon Veit, later to Friedrich Schlegel), and Sophie Tieck,\nthe poet’s younger sister. Under the editorial leadership of the\nSchlegels, these self-designated romantic writers published the\nshort-lived, yet influential journal Athenaeum, whose famous\nmanifesto states that romanticism is neither merely an aesthetic, nor\na purely academic pursuit—as von Hardenberg optimistically puts\nit: the entire world should be romanticized (LFI #66). \nThe notion of the Athenaeum writers establishing a unified\nphilosophical group is due, in part, to their call for a shared\nphilosophizing (Symphilosophie)—their envisioning\nphilosophy as a progressive, collective enterprise, rather than a set\nof solitary contributions of the system-building variety—and the\naccompanying critique of the idea of intellectual authorship that\nwould encourage the adoption of pen-names and countless anonymous\npublications, which also, conveniently, minimized the impact of\ncensorship on individual academic careers and allowed the\nmovement’s female companions to publish and distribute their\nwork. Furthermore, from Hegel onwards, the critics of romantic\nphilosophy have typically favored sweeping claims and totalizing\nrejections rather than careful analysis of particular contributions\nand arguments. (I return to this point in Section Eight.) However, the\ngroup in question had rather porous and flexible boundaries. The\nAthenaeum philosophers were all part of the larger\nintellectual life in Germany. And the romantics not only responded to\nthe most well-known philosophical schools of the time, such as those\nof Kant or Fichte, but were also influenced by a whole host of writers\nand intellectuals whose work, at least within the Anglophone world,\nhave long been forgotten outside the circles of historically minded\nGerman scholars and experts on late eighteenth-century European\nthought. Rather than falling in rank under one unifying program, the\ncontributors to the Athenaeum stand forth as diverse with\nregard to philosophical orientations and insights as well as the\nhistorical-philosophical resources on which they draw. \nThe very term romanticism is often traced back to the medieval novel\nof chivalry in which the hero’s lonely fight against evil, sin,\nand moral weakness is fuelled by the twin motivation of faith and\nlove, hence reflecting a universe in which the individual is unified\nwith and understands himself through the de facto tradition\nto which he pledges allegiance. However, the turn to the Middle Ages\nis not primarily expressive of a sentimental cultivation of the past,\nbut had long been part of the German Enlightenment and its critique of\npolitical absolutism. Like the enlightenment philosophers, the Jena\nromantics were always clear that the organic unity of pre-modern\nsocieties was lost once and for all. When Novalis, in Christianity\nor Europe and other texts, wishes to revive the spirit of the\nMiddle Ages, he is frequently referring to the cosmopolitan thrust of\nthe Hanseatic League rather than a homogenous, tradition-based, and\nauthoritarian medieval culture. As such, Novalis’s philosophy is\nresponsive to the conditions of modernity. In his work, modern\nphilosophy is seen as fundamentally self-reflexive in nature, as\nbelonging to the age of self-critical reason; that is, it is linked up\nwith the quest not only for first-order knowledge of nature and human\nbeing, but also for second-order knowledge of what human knowledge\ninvolves in the first place. \nAs a philosophical form, the fragment reflects the conditions of\nmodernity. In Friedrich Schlegel’s view, the hyper-reflexive\nexpressive registers of irony and humor are particularly suited to\nvoice the modern mindset, and are, as such, intrinsically linked to\nthe fragment (such a view is also present in Novalis’s writings,\nthough underemphasized in comparison with Friedrich Schlegel).\nNovalis’s turn to the fragment has a different philosophical\nmotivation. The fragment questions the idea that philosophical\nsystem-building, be it of a deductive or a teleological kind, is fit\nto capture the nature of reality. Like\nBlüthenstaub—though the title was added when Friedrich\nSchlegel was editing Novalis’s text for publication—the\nfragment emerges as an intellectual seed or pollen that is meant to\nfoster critical and independent reflection rather than presenting a\nsystem of self-contained theorizing. \nAlthough the fragment, as a philosophical form, is often associated\nwith the early Jena romantics, it was not invented by this group.\nRather, the fragment has a long history, stretching back to the\nancient Greeks, but also to modern writers such as Chamfort, La\nRochefoucauld, and Lichtenberg. (Chamfort’s work was translated\ninto German in the 1790s and eagerly read and discussed at the time.)\nWithin circles closer to the romantics, Herder, from the late 1760s\non, had been exploring the philosophical potential of the fragment.\nHerder’s turn to the fragment was motivated by a wide-spanning\nskepticism with regard to the idea of a totalizing or teleological\nsystem of reason. The young Herder leads this skepticism back to the\nphilosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment. Novalis makes frequent\nreferences to Herder’s work and person. \nWith its broken form and literary style, Novalis’s return to the\nfragment has been taken to challenge the distinction between art and\ncritical thinking that was entirely central to Kant and Fichte.\nHowever, while the fragment draws on the expressive registers of\nliterature, it does not represent a deconstruction of the difference\nbetween philosophy and poetry, science and art. It is, rather, an\nattempt, from within the realm of critical reason, to explore\na reality whose complex nature cannot be captured by the work of a\nnarrowly oriented rationality (Verstandesdenken, in the\neighteenth-century glossary). Like Schelling and Hegel, Novalis\nchallenges the dry and narrow understanding of reason that, in their\nview, had come to dominate the post-Enlightenment world of politics,\nscience, and letters. Like them, he does this not by appealing to the\npurely irrational, but by developing a notion of reason that includes\na dimension of historicity and takes into account the experience of\nart, literature, and religious and affective sentiments of various\nkinds. Unlike Schelling and Hegel, however, Novalis believes that such\na notion of reason can only be obtained by leaving behind the idea of\na final and all-encompassing philosophical system. But as Herder had\nbeen demonstrating already in the early 1770s, to question the idea of\nan all-encompassing system is not the same as to endorse intellectual\nchaos or unsystematic thought procedures. When reading the early\nromantic philosophy of Novalis, one should keep in mind the warning of\nhis friend Friedrich Schlegel: Just as a fully systematic philosophy\nmight be an illusion, a completely unsystematic philosophy would\ninstantly kill off every intellectual ambition. Thus the challenge of\nromantic philosophy consists in the attempt to think systematically\nbut without allowing thought to stagnate in a final set of truths or\ndogma. Philosophy ought to be open-ended; it should develop in close\ninteraction with the natural sciences as well as the humanities. In\nshort, philosophy should take the shape of a sustained intellectual\nexperiment; it should be forever on its way and thoroughly inductively\nminded. This philosophical credo runs through the entire work of\nNovalis, from Miscellaneous Observations to Notes for a\nRomantic Encyclopaedia (Das Allgemeine Brouillon) and\nChristianity or Europe. \nEven though the fragment is expressive of the\ndeeper—anti-teleological, if one likes—motivations of\nNovalis’s thinking, it is easy to make too much of the form in\nwhich substantial parts of his work is handed down to us. As is made\nclear by the publication of the critical edition, many of\nNovalis’s texts are available as fragments simply because he did\nnot have the time to polish his thoughts or because they were never\nintended for publication. Furthermore, a text such as Pollen,\nwhich was indeed intended for publication, was edited by Friedrich\nSchlegel, who broke up some of the longer passages into shorter\nfragments. \nDas Allgemeine Brouillon brings to light the close connection\nin Novalis’s work between philosophy and empirical science. Yet\nthe Brouillon is not meant to give a final account of\nphilosophical knowledge, but aspires to recapitulate the state of\nknowledge as it currently is, hence providing an impetus to revision\nand improvement. In order to enhance its stakes and procedures,\nhowever, reason needs a point of orientation, an idea of what\nuniversal knowledge would amount to, even though such knowledge by\ndefinition is out of reach. In Novalis’s work, the very idea of\na philosophical encyclopedia provides such a point of orientation. \nThe affiliation with empirical science is another point at which\nNovalis’s understanding of the fragment differs from that of\nFriedrich Schlegel. Whereas Schlegel establishes a close link between\nphilosophy and poetry—at times he even dismantles the\ndistinction between them—Novalis is convinced that if human\nreason seeks everywhere for the unconditioned (das\nUnbedingte) but finds nothing but things (Dinge) (MO\n#1), then we better study these things closely and try to make sense\nof them. That is, in his view, reason is inevitably driven towards the\nidea of an infinite, pre-reflexive, and pre-subjective ground or first\nprinciple, an unconditioned, which it itself can never grasp; what it\ncan grasp, though, are the manifestations of such a ground in the\nworld to which it has access through experience and science. Thus\nNovalis claims that “Idealism is nothing but genuine\nempiricism” (AB #402). Novalis also defines philosophy\nas a science of science (AB #886); it explores the conditions for the\nstudy of nature, human nature included. \nSo conceived, philosophy is not cut off from practical purposes. Under\nthe heading “Encyclopedistics,” Novalis explains that\n“Half theories lead away from\npraxis—whole theories lead back to it”\n(AB #537). Or, as he, in the spirit of Kant’s teleology of\nnature, stages his metaphysical program: “Philosophy cannot bake\nbread—however, it can provide us with God, freedom and\nimmortality—now which is more practical—philosophy or\neconomics?” (AB #401). And in a slightly earlier work, Novalis,\nreferring to the Kantian definition of metaphysics, claims that\n“We only know it, insofar we realize\nit” (KS, 331, cf. also HKA 2, 378). \nIn Novalis’s view, true philosophical insight, addressing issues\nof legitimacy as well as the question of meaning (or, in Kantian\nlanguage, the regulative ideas of reason), provides a deepened\nself-understanding that guides our practice and orientation in the\nworld. The fragment strengthens this dimension of philosophy in that\nit fosters critical distance and independent thinking. Such an\nintellectual stance, in turn, is a condition of possibility for\ngenuine intersubjectivity, ultimately also for the republican ideals\nthat Novalis is promoting. Before we get that far, however, we need to\nlook, in more detail, at Novalis’s engagement with the ideals of\nthe Enlightenment and the philosophy of German Idealism. \nNovalis’s philosophical readership, his critics and supporters\nalike, have paid a great deal of attention to his interpretation of\nFichte. For Novalis’s generation, Fichte was seen as the true\nheir of Kant’s critical thinking. In the Athenaeum\nFragments, Schlegel applauds Fichte’s move beyond the\nKantian architecture of reason, and in his Lectures on the History\nof Philosophy Hegel, likewise, suggests that it was Fichte who\nprovided the speculative unity that Kant’s system was lacking.\nBy emphasizing the I’s absolute and immediate positing of\nitself, Fichte, it was claimed, suspended the self-imposed limitations\nof Kantian idealism. He thus succeeded in overcoming the dichotomies\nthat had plagued Kant’s contemporary readers, including the\ndichotomies of reason and sensibility, spontaneity and receptivity,\nfreedom and necessity. With Fichte, philosophy was grounded in one\nultimate and unifying principle: that of the I’s positing of\nitself as absolute and free (that is, in the jargon of the period, of\nthe I positing itself as absolutely self-positing). \nAs Friedrich Schlegel lays out his philosophical-poetic principles in\nthe famous Athenaeum Fragment 216, Fichte’s theory of\nthe I’s absolute self-positing established a sine qua\nnon of the romantic program. If the French Revolution, in its\nearlier phases, had opened up a new space of political action,\nrealizing, in concreto, the principle of the rational\nself-determination of a people, and if Goethe’s Wilhelm\nMeister, crossing genre boundaries by drawing on philosophy,\npoetry, and drama alike, had set a new standard for the modern novel\nas a complete and all-encompassing work of art—a literary\nGesamtkunstwerk—it was Fichte who had led philosophy\nback to the unbound spontaneity of subjectivity, thus realizing the\nimplicit promise of Kant’s transcendental turn. \nIn his aesthetics, Kant had discussed how natural beauty, in\ntriggering a free play between imagination and understanding, gives\nthe disinterested spectator a hint that nature might be designed so as\nto facilitate the work of our cognitive faculties, hence also allowing\nfor the possibility of a system of inductive knowledge and the idea of\na will behind what, from the perspective of the understanding, appears\nas the realm of blind causality. In the aesthetic experience,\ntranscendental imagination is furnished with the regulative function\nof providing human beings with a sense of orientation in the\nworld—a sense of belonging or purpose. Kant also had proposed\nthat man-made beauty, i.e., art, puts forth a sensuous presentation of\nthe ideas of reason. And, finally, he had established a close\nconnection between the work of art and the spontaneous production of\ncreative genius. \nIn Kant’s system, however, the bridge between freedom and\nnecessity is restricted to the realm of the aesthetic judgment. The\npure aesthetic judgment can be ascribed a merely subjective\nuniversality. Fichte, however, brought out the full philosophical\npotential of the Kantian idea of freedom. In Fichte’s theory,\nthe creative spontaneity of imagination is so to speak\nuniversalized—it is turned into the distinctive feature of the\nabsolute, positing I, which is free even to posit its ontological\ncounterpart in the limiting non-I. Hence the cautious “as\nif”-status of the purposiveness of nature in the aesthetic\nexperience is sublated. At a transcendental level, even causally\ndetermined nature is explained in light of the self-positing ego. The\ngap between subjectivity and nature, freedom and necessity,\nspontaneity and receptivity is ultimately bridged. This, thought\nNovalis and many with him, was the achievement of Fichte’s\nphilosophy. \nYet, for all his progress beyond the Kantian framework, Fichte had\nfailed to address the more deep-seated problem of meaning that was\npart of the Kantian agenda: the possibility of there being a will or\nrationality behind the universe as such, a will or rationality that is\nprior to and constitutive of subjectivity, hence granting it a sense\nof meaning and purpose. Whereas Kant had framed this as a question of\nteleology and natural beauty, Novalis and his fellow romantics linked\nit to the experience of art and poetry in particular. I return to\nNovalis’s philosophy of art in the next section. What is\nimportant at this point, however, is to realize how Novalis develops\nhis standpoint in critical response to the philosophical challenges\nposed by Kant and Fichte. \nAllegedly, Hölderlin and Novalis met with Fichte in the home of\nFriedrich Immanuel Niethammer in Jena in 1795. The meeting with\nFichte, it is said (though the historical documentation is scant),\nstrengthened Novalis’s interest in his philosophy and led to the\nwork that would culminate in the Fichte Studies. Nonetheless,\nthe collection was not given its title by Novalis himself but added by\nthe editor, Hans-Joachim Mähl. The Fichte Studies does not\ndeal exclusively with Fichte’s philosophy, but addresses a broad\nrange of philosophical problems, one of which is Novalis’s\nworries with regard to subjective idealism. Other topics include the\nhistory of philosophy, the relationship between art and philosophy,\nand the relationship between art and science. Nonetheless, this\ncollection of notes and observations shelters the most coherent\naccount of Novalis’s interpretation of Fichte. \nAlthough Novalis admires Fichte, he is more cautious in his attitude\nthan many of his contemporaries. In the Fichte Studies he\npolemically asks whether Fichte has not “too arbitrarily packed\neverything into the I” (FS #5). And in Notes for a Romantic\nEncyclopaedia (Das Allgemeine Brouillon), written a few\nyears later, his critique is poignantly articulated in the analogy\nbetween the Fichtean ego and the desolate main character of Daniel\nDefoe’s famous novel: “Fichte’s ego—is a\nRobinson Crusoe—a scientific fiction” (AB\n#717). \nAccording to Novalis—whose thinking at this point converges with\nHölderlin’s response to subjective\nidealism—Fichte’s theory is ultimately rooted in the\nimmediacy of the I’s self-positing, and it presupposes that the\ncapacity for self-reflection can be traced back to a\nnon-representational self-relation or intellectual intuition that\nevades the very structure of reflectivity and hence also the\nsubject-object relationship between the reflecting and the reflected\nego. Novalis maintains that in order to take a reflective stance\ntowards itself, the self needs to represent itself in some form or\nanother. The I’s most original self-relation cannot simply take\nthe form of an original Tathandlung in which the reflecting\nself (the subject pole of the self-reflection) claims immediate\nidentity with itself as reflected (i.e., as the object pole of the\nself-reflection). In Novalis’s view, self-reflection requires\nsome kind of external representation. Such a representation cannot,\nhowever, be deduced from the immediate identity (FS #11). The identity\nof the reflecting and the reflected I is grounded in a feeling (FS\n#11). Thought, however, fails to grasp this feeling. \nNovalis follows Kant in claiming that thought and feeling make up two\nirreducible sources of experience. Given this dual source of\nexperience, philosophy cannot, as Fichte would have it, be rooted in\none single principle. To be sure, the idea of such a principle is\nattractive to the extent that it would aid in undermining the Kantian\ndualism of concept and intuition, and ultimately also guarantee the\nself-determination of rational subjectivity. Yet such a principle\ncannot be given. Instead of adhering to the completely autonomous\nsubjectivity of Fichtean philosophy, Novalis argues that the subject\nis inwardly split, not just between thought and feeling, but\nultimately also between the hubris of believing that thought can in\nfact grasp the basic self-feeling, and the realization that this\nfeeling cannot be conceptually processed as such. The latter point not\nonly involves a modification of the scope of reflexive subjectivity,\nbut also of philosophy itself. As Novalis emphatically puts it,\n“[t]he borders of feeling are the borders of\nphilosophy” (FS #15, emphasis added). \nIf Novalis develops his own philosophical voice through the encounter\nwith Fichte, he also takes a significant step beyond the\nepistemological framework of The Science of Knowledge. Some\nscholars, such as Manfred Frank and Jane Kneller, see the Fichte\nStudies, with its insistence on the two sources of experience, as\ngesturing back to a more Kantian position—a Kantian moderation\nof Fichte’s idealism. Such an interpretation is not only\njustified by reference to Novalis’s critique of Fichte, but also\ngiven historical support in light of Novalis’s relatively close\ncontact with Kantian philosophers such as Karl Leonhard Reinhold and\nCarl Christian Erhard Schmid. Furthermore, on having completed his\nstudies of Fichte, Novalis quickly returns to Kant. In the so-called\nKant Studies, whose scope spans Kant’s practical as\nwell as theoretical philosophy, he speaks of Kant’s\nphilosophizing as scholastic, yet celebrates it as “one of the\nmost remarkable phenomena of the human spirit” (KS, 337). In\ncritically endorsing Kant’s idea of transcendental idealism as\nthe science of philosophy, Novalis, too, wishes to see philosophy as a\nmeta-discipline, a rational account of the boundaries of\nrationality. \nNovalis’s work is neither strictly speaking Kantian nor strictly\nspeaking Fichtean in spirit. On assessing Novalis’s reflections\non transcendental idealism, it is important to keep in mind that when\nhe, in 1797, returns to Kant’s thinking, he views it through the\nlens of Fichte’s philosophy. Furthermore, Fichte’s\nthinking, for Novalis, did not just consist in the various theses of\nThe Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre), but\nalso in a certain way of doing philosophy. “Fichtean philosophy\nis a call to self-activity,” insists Novalis (FS #567). That is,\nit is a mode of philosophizing rather than a given claim about the\nabsolute freedom of the transcendental ego. In this respect,\nFichte’s most important work is not the\nWissenschaftslehre, but his lecture on the scholar’s\nvocation, Über die Bestimmung des Gelehrten, which he\nsupposedly read in Jena in 1794 and which would then be eagerly\nstudied in Jena and Weimar. Even though Novalis had good family\nconnections to Fichte, we do not know for sure whether he had access\nto the unpublished version of this text. However, Novalis’s\nemphasis on intellectual responsibility, self-thinking, and autonomy\nspeaks clearly of a responsiveness to this dimension of Fichte’s\nwork. Novalis’s reflections on these issues culminate in his\nnotion of Bildung. This is also the point at which Novalis\nceases to present himself as a critical commentator of subjective\nidealism and produces an independent philosophical contribution of\nlasting force and value. \nAccording to Novalis, the “academy ought to be a thoroughly\nphilosophical institution—only one faculty—the whole\nestablishment organized—to arouse and exercise the capacity to\nthink [Denkkraft] in a purposive way” (MO #4, trans. modified).\nBy emphasizing the need for independent thinking, Fichte endorsed\nKant’s critical turn and his transformation of philosophy,\npitched as a set of doctrines and principles, into philosophizing,\npictured as a critical activity. Furthermore, Fichte had realized that\nphilosophizing is a call of the self to the self (FS #567). Yet the\nself to which the philosophizing turns is not understood as an empty\nor merely formal capacity for self-positing. True idealism, Novalis\nclaims, is not opposed to realism, but only to formalism. A proper\naccount of the self, in its relation to itself, should consider the\nself’s development in and through history as well as its\nexternalizing of itself in the encounter with other minds and\nnature. \nThe idea of Bildung, education in and through culture,\nremains one of the most significant contributions of late\neighteenth-century philosophy. Even though it is most often associated\nwith Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit (as well as his\nslightly later speech “On Classical Studies”), in which\nthe philosophical mind retrieves its historical-systematic development\nas a succession of various philosophical paradigms and thought models,\nthe notion was widely applied before 1807. We find it in the work of\nHerder, the young Schleiermacher, and, expanding the focus to the\nrealm of literature, the idea of Bildung is operative in\nGoethe’s Wilhelm Meister. Goethe’s work, as the\nsequel commences in the mid 1790s, follows Wilhelm through his\nyouthful adventures and beyond, seeing how the protagonist gradually\nreaches an understanding of his formative experiences and thus gains\nan ever-increasing sense of freedom and self-determination. \nFor Novalis, too, philosophy involves a process of maturity and\nself-understanding (though he would eventually grow more critical of\nGoethe’s work). This is another dimension of his call for a\npractical turn in philosophy. In Novalis’s words: “Whoever\nknows what philosophizing is, also knows what life is” (AB\n#702). Philosophy does not manifest itself in a set of theoretical\ndogmas, but in a capacity to judge. As such, philosophy cannot be\nlearned or passively appropriated, but only triggered by such Socratic\nprovocations as the fragment, irony, the joke, and the essay. Hence\nNovalis’s call for a romanticizing of the world does not involve\nperceiving it through a new or different lens, but the ability to\nraise oneself to a state of critical self-understanding. This aim,\nNovalis emphasizes, cannot be reached through the means of isolated\nsoliloquy, but requires an engagement with the larger community as\nwell as with history, tradition, natural science, and art. It\ninvolves, in short, the realization that the self necessarily belongs\nto a more comprehensive, historically developed, and cross-culturally\nfertilized totality of meaning. In affinity with\nSchleiermacher’s Speeches (which Novalis studied in the\nearly fall of 1799), Novalis makes it clear that individuality proper\nis only developed in interaction with other individuals. If\n“[e]ach human being is a society in miniature” (MO #42),\nit still applies that “[e]very individual is the center of a\nsystem of emanation” (MO #109). \nThe self understands itself as part of a given community, but also as\nthe product of a historical development that spans the arts and the\nsciences alike. Only in this way can the I, in Novalis’s\nparadoxical formulation, be the I of its I (MO #28). In order to see\noneself as situated within a given historical and intersubjective\ncontext, history cannot be fully objectivized: “[w]e are related\nto all parts of the universe—as we are to the future and to\ntimes past” (MO #91). The understanding of history is thus a\nmatter of self-understanding. However, in the enlightenment\ncelebration of novelty and progress, history is reduced to a catalogue\nof mistakes that are left behind in favor of a more mature\ncomprehension of reality past and present. In Novalis’s view,\nphilosophical romanticism must take on the responsibility of\noverthrowing—at a meta-philosophical as well as\nhistorical-empirical level—such an ahistorical concept of\nhistory. Thus the emphasis on Bildung involves a reassessment\nnot only of the self (it involves recognizing that the self is\nfundamentally situated in tradition), but also of the tradition. This\nimplies, first, the view that tradition extends into the present and,\nsecond, the claim that in order to gain understanding of history,\nhence also of the interpreter’s own time, historical expressions\nshould not be judged by the criteria of the present but be seen within\ntheir own context, be it cultural, political, religious, or all of the\nabove. \nFor Novalis, the classical world is so to speak the other of\nmodernity; it is different, yet a fundamental part of it. Furthermore,\nany modern culture—and here we see, again, the traces of\nNovalis’s turn towards the more cosmopolitan spirit of the\nHanseatic League—understands itself in critical interaction with\nother cultures, including those of the non-Western world and the\ntemporally distant parts of the interpreter’s own culture. In\nhis 1798 reflections on Goethe, Novalis writes that spirit by nature\nstrives to absorb and understand its other. This process of expanding\none’s horizon by considering the other’s point of view is,\nat one and the same time, the nature and the ultimate goal of\nBildung. In Kant Studies such an enterprise is\npresented, along the lines of Kantian anthropology, as the theory of\nthe causes and remedies of prejudices (KS 330). \nThe emphasis on understanding others does not involve a relativization\nof history and intercultural understanding. Like Schleiermacher and\nSchlegel, Novalis takes a strong interest in philology and demands\nthat every author and reader must be philologically minded\n(Teplitz Fragments #42). Philology, for the romantic\nphilosopher, is, among other things, about the reader taking into\naccount the original context in which the text was produced. Hence,\naccording to Novalis, “[p]hilologizing is the true\nscholarly occupation. It corresponds to\nexperimenting” (AB #724). Philologizing—and note\nagain, as in the case of philosophizing, the active form\nphilologisiren and the reference to experimenting—is\nabout breaking through illegitimate prejudices, trying to understand a\nsymbolic expression on its own terms rather than reducing it to a\nfamiliar position, which would minimize its capacity to challenge the\nreader’s system of beliefs and values. Conceived in this way,\nphilology challenges every scholastic passing down of authoritative\ninterpretations. It curbs the threat of the dead letter and\ncounteracts the tendency of modern society to steward the tradition in\nsuch a formalistic way that it overlooks the meaning of the\nhieroglyph, as Novalis at one point puts it. In the spirit of the\nEnlightenment, he wishes to challenge and critically reflect on\nprejudices handed down from tradition. But unlike the enlightenment\nphilosophers—at least in their most undialectical championing of\nprogress—Novalis believes that the past can itself offer\nresources for a critical-reflexive discussion of and stance towards\nthe present. In this sense, Novalis can claim that “The theory\nof the future belongs to history” (AB #425). Even if the past\ncannot be immediately retrieved and even if it is neither desirable\nnor rational to long for a revival of times long gone, the past,\nproviding an alternative to the intellectual framework of the present,\ncan aid the philosopher, the artist, the scientist, or the politician\nin developing a critical attitude to the beliefs and assumptions he or\nshe had previously left unanalyzed. The past should in other words be\nreconstructed on its own terms, but precisely such a reconstruction,\nNovalis argues, will ensure its relevance for the present. \nWhile it is entirely crucial to the romantic concept of\nBildung, the idea of philology is related to the return to\nthe classical form of the fragment. At stake in both cases is the\nawareness that there are, in philosophy, two ways to look at things,\nfrom above and downward or from below and upward, roughly\ncorresponding to what Kant in the same period had addressed as\nreflective and determinative judgment or Herder, drawing on the\nresources of Scottish enlightenment philosophy, had seen as the\ndifference between inductive-empirical and deductively-minded\nphilosophy. \nUltimately, Novalis identifies the never-ending process of\nBildung with philosophy itself. Doing philosophy, Novalis\nexplains, is a conversation with oneself (LFI #21), but one that takes\nplace through the encounter with the other. Thus, the decision to\n“do philosophy is a challenge to the real self to reflect, to\nawaken and to be spirit” (LFI #21). Philosophy is about the\nself’s capacity to take responsibility for itself. For, at the\nend of the day, “[l]ife must not be a novel that is given to us,\nbut one that is made by us” (LFI #99). \nBildung and philosophy, as education to self-responsibility,\nare closely related to the realm of art. There are at least two\ndimensions of this relationship. First, Novalis is well aware that\nBildung, the call to self-understanding and autonomy through\nan engagement with tradition and other cultures, cannot proceed by way\nof an appeal to formal methodology. No rule can ever guarantee the\nsuccessful outcome of the individual’s education in culture.\nRather, it is a matter of moving from the particular to the universal,\nbut without a universal at hand by which this move can be justified.\nWhat is required is a context-sensitive judgment. The process of\nBildung is itself an art (Kunst) in the sense that\nit takes tact or reflective judgment (such a use of the term\n“art,” as opposed to merely mechanical processes, was\nfairly common at the time and can also be found in the work of Herder,\nKant, and Schleiermacher). Along these lines, Novalis speaks of the\nwill to Fichtecize artistically (LFI #11), and also criticizes Fichte\nand Kant for being unpoetic (AB #924). The second sense in which art,\nphilosophy, and Bildung are related has to do with art being\none of the media, maybe even the privileged medium, through which\nBildung is achieved. In this context, it is important to keep\nin mind that as far as the philosophy of art goes, Novalis’s\nperiod is one of transition. Around this time, aesthetics, as a\nKantian investigation into the validity-claim of the pure judgment of\ntaste, is established as an autonomous philosophical discipline with\nthe Critique of Judgment. Yet it is nonetheless the case that\nhistorical and intercultural engagement was, until and throughout this\nperiod, largely a matter of studying religious and cultural artefacts\nfrom temporally or geographically distant eras. These objects were not\nnecessarily approached aesthetically—that is, subjected to pure\naesthetic judgment in Kant’s meaning of the term—but also,\nas in the works of Herder and Hegel, viewed as part of the larger\nfabric of the moral sciences. Novalis often leans in this direction,\nand at one point even follows Herder in addressing aesthetics as a\npsychological discipline (AB #423). \nNovalis’s philosophy of art does not only lead to a recognition\nof the value of intertemporal and intercultural understanding. In\nfact, in a work such as Walter Benjamin’s study of the romantic\nnotion of criticism, one encounters the idea that romantic aesthetics\nrepresents a proto-modernist theory of art. \nIn line with his general philosophy of history, Novalis contrasts\nmodern art to the art of ancient cultures. As opposed to ancient art,\nwhich was afforded a direct moral and religious relevance, modern art\nreflects its status as art. Or, stronger still, modern art sees itself\nas art only—yet, precisely as art (only) can it give voice and\nexpression to experiences that cannot be grasped by a\npost-Enlightened, philosophical reason. As part of the Schillerian era\nof sentimentality, modern philosophy mourns the absence of a\npre-subjective, pre-reflexive anchoring of reason. Herein consists the\nso-called homesickness of philosophy (AB #857). Modern philosophy\nlongs for a principle that can shore up thought and subjectivity by\nreference to a dimension of being that is ontologically prior to it.\nGiven its discursive nature, philosophy is constitutively cut-off from\nsuch an absolute grounding. Art, however, can testify to this\ndimension of being; it can express what modern philosophy wants, yet\nis painfully aware that it cannot get. In this sense, “the poet\nis the transcendental physician,” as Novalis provocatively puts\nit (LFI #36). Given its linguistic nature, poetry in particular should\nstrive to realize its own inherent potential rather than imitating\nphilosophy and other discursive forms of expression. \nNovalis’s understanding of art in general and literature in\nparticular is perhaps best articulated—or, rather,\nexemplified—in a novel such as Heinrich von\nOfterdingen. Though unfinished, the novel, which includes ample\nmeta-reflections on aesthetic matters, illustrates the dream-like\natmosphere that has made Novalis’s work the prime example of\nmagical idealism, the romantic prism through which nature itself\noccurs as a work of art, as being expressive of a deeper meaning and\nperfection that defuses the possible tension between necessity and\nfreedom, sensuousness and understanding, and gives human beings a\nsense of belonging and being at home in the world. \nIf there is a relative distinction between poetry and philosophy in\nNovalis’s work—the two need one another, yet answer to\ndifferent human needs and capacities—the situation is more\ncomplicated with regard to art and politics. From Heinrich Heine\nonwards, the aestheticization of politics has been one of the\nstrongest cards played out by the critics of romantic philosophy. And\neven among the most sympathetic readers of Novalis’s work, the\nliberally minded will have a hard time swallowing his attempt to\ncreate a higher union between politics, art, and religion, and his\ntendency to valorize religion over philosophy and art. The same\napplies for the way in which he, for example in a lyrical work such as\n“Hymns to the Night,” written in response to the death of\nhis young fiancée, infuses the erotic yearning for the beloved with a\nlonging for religious redemption. That said, Novalis’s political\nthinking neither can nor should be reduced to these potentially\nreactionary sentiments. Novalis’s idea of a synthesis of art and\npolitics is far more complex than is typically acknowledged by its\ncritics. \nWhile Novalis was always sympathetic to the ideals of the French\nrevolution, he grew increasingly skeptical in his assessment of their\nactual realization in late eighteenth-century France. In his view, the\nproponents of liberté, egalité, and\nfraternité had failed to live up to their celebrated ideals.\nFor all its good intentions, the revolution had resulted in\ninequality, injustice, and terror. It is characteristic of\nNovalis’s political philosophy that he not only offers a\nprincipled discussion of this predicament, but also a historical\ncritique. Novalis sees the revolution in continuity with the\nEnlightenment, and worries that these movements cultivate a notion of\nreason that fails to take historical reality into account. The\nproponents of the revolution had forgotten to ask if the people were\nready to take on the admirable ideals of liberty, equality, and\nsolidarity. Novalis wishes not only to endorse the ideals of the\nrevolution, but also to offer reflections on how the people can be\nbrought to a stage where they can responsibly take on the principles\nof the revolution and make its ideals their own. This is the ultimate\ntask and purpose of Bildung. \nThe first political pamphlet of the romantic movement was\nSchleiermacher’s On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured\nDespisers, and Novalis is thoroughly influenced by this work. In\nOn Religion, Schleiermacher advocates an egalitarian,\norganic, and ecumenical religion, and professes that only such a\nreligious-political system can provide a framework within which the\nindividual can fully grow into and take responsibility for itself. At\nthe same time, such a religion is only possible—it can only be\nrealized in concreto—when the individuals of a given\nsociety have generally reached at least a minimal stage of\nself-understanding and respect for others. Hence there is a close\nconnection between the existence of a broad-spanning group of educated\nand mature individuals and the possibility of introducing a sensible\nreligious and ultimately also political order. The problem, according\nto Schleiermacher, is that modern religion has been dominated by\nphilistines who have placed themselves in between the people and the\ntrue democratic truths of the New Testament. What is needed is a\nrethinking of religious life—and, as part of this, a rethinking\nof the relationship to tradition. This is why On Religion\nanticipates Schleiermacher’s later writings in hermeneutics. And\nthis point, as it is appropriated by Novalis, also establishes a\nconnection between his hermeneutic historicism and his political\nphilosophy. \nNovalis’s political reflections inform the Miscellaneous\nObservations, get more poignantly voiced in Faith and\nLove and the “Political Aphorisms” (written in 1798),\nand find their quasi-religious culmination in Christianity or\nEurope, the 1799-text that even his Athenaeum friends\ndeemed problematic in its call for a new Catholic unity in Europe. In\nspite of Schlegel’s willingness to publish the text, the furore\nit caused amongst Novalis’s peers, including Goethe, Schelling,\nand Schiller, held him back, and Christianity or Europe\nremained unpublished till 1826. \nThere is an overall unity in Novalis’s political writings, as\nthey span almost the entire ten years of his productive period: the\nidea that democracy can only be effectively realized among a people\nthat is historically ready for it, that such readiness takes a\ncapacity for critique and independent thinking, and that\nBildung is the way in which independent thinking is best\nachieved. In combining critical skills, analytic abilities, and the\nmotivational force provided by art and cultured discourse, Novalis is\nhopeful that romantic philosophy will find a way to retain the ideals\nof the revolution without, at the same time, repeating its\nmistakes. \nRomanticism, in his view, aims at preserving the enlightenment\ncommitment to self-determination and freedom without turning it into a\nmerely abstract and alienating discourse. Individuality and\nself-determination can only be achieved in organic communion with\nother self-determining individuals. It needs to be realized as part of\nan ongoing discussion of the ultimate meaning, goals, and\nself-understanding of a given, historical society. A healthy\nintersubjectivity makes up a presupposition for a mature and\nwell-developed personality. Conversely, the organically developed\ncommunity consists of unique, yet mutually recognizing individuals and\ntheir bonds of interaction. Diversity is a condition for the sought\nunity. As such, the ideal society is likened to a work of art. No\nmechanical rules or abstract theories can guarantee the successful\nrealization of the community as a unity in manifold. This is the\nlesson Novalis takes from Schleiermacher, and which serves as the\ndetermining ground for his political theory. This is also the thought\nthat undergirds his lasting commitment to republicanism. \nIn the period between Faith and Love and Christianity or\nEurope, written only two years before Novalis’s death,\nthere is a significant change in Novalis’s views on how a good\nsociety is best achieved. In 1798 Novalis was inspired by the idea of\na democracy from above and connected the idea of education to the\nmotivational force of monarchy. By positing their own lives and\nactions as examples, the king and the queen, representing at one and\nthe same time the community of living individuals and the larger whole\nof the tradition, should inspire the people to strive for\nself-understanding and freedom through education. That is, by setting\nan example of autonomous thinking while, all the same, representing a\ncontinuity with the past, the royal couple would turn the monarchy\ninto a symbol of the democratic state itself. Around 1799, however,\nNovalis’s view changes. He now imagines that this motivational\nforce can only be led back to the unifying power of the church, or,\nmore precisely, that of the papal state. At this point, the democratic\nethos of his thinking is considerably weakened. \nNovalis’s turn to the church is indisputably problematic when\njudged from a 21st century perspective. Yet it is important to see\nthat within his own time, most of his political writing, up until\naround 1798, is representative of the progressive reformist movement\nin Germany. Furthermore, Novalis’s democratic, pluralistic, and\negalitarian ideals should not be dismissed because of his later, more\nconservative sentiments, nor should the connection he sees between\nthese ideals and a commitment to Bildung. It is this notion\nof Bildung, the idea that democracy requires a triad of\nindividual education, societal plurality, and, not least, a capacity\nfor impartial judging, that will remain Novalis’s most valuable\ncontribution to political thought. \nSoon after Novalis’s death, his friends amongst the romantics,\nled by Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel, started spinning the myth about\nthe über-sensitive visionary poet and aesthete, the\nbeautiful soul, forever longing for the unattainable blue flower, the\nsymbol of eternal love and divine grace that would so enthrall the\ncharacter of Heinrich von Ofterdingen. The legend of Novalis as the\narch-romantic author rapidly gained credence, and his literary style\nbecame influential for writers from Georg Büchner, via the\nsymbolists, to Hermann Hesse and the avant-garde movement in France\nand Germany. In the philosophical domain, the reception of Novalis has\nbeen more reluctant. Some of this reluctance must be explained by the\nfact that until the publication of the critical edition, it was\ndifficult to distinguish between the posthumously created image of\nNovalis, on the one hand, and his real philosophical contribution, on\nthe other. This difficulty also colors the harsh judgments of Hegel,\nNovalis’s most rampant critic among his contemporary\nGermans. \nHegel is critical of what he takes to be an undue turn to isolated\nsubjectivity, and in particular its affective and emotional aspects,\nin romantic philosophy. He traces this turn to subjectivity back to\nthe romantic reading of Fichte. The romantics, in his interpretation,\nmisunderstood Fichte’s work. They hypostatized his notion of\nspontaneous self-positing, baking it into a largely aesthetic\nvocabulary of the creative power of imagination. While he places\nNovalis within this framework, Hegel overlooks how he (Novalis) not\nonly draws on but also criticizes Fichte’s philosophy. In\nHegel’s understanding, romanticism in general and\nNovalis’s philosophy in particular leads to a pathological\ncultivation of inwardness, a naïve and otherworldly position that is\nnot only philosophically at fault but also constitutes a genuine\npolitical risk in that it represents an alluring conversion from\ncritical thinking to otherworldly reveries. However, as Otto Pöggeler\ndemonstrates in his 1956 study, as soon as one distinguishes\nphilosophical romanticism proper from its mythological image, it\nbecomes clear that Hegel stands far closer to the romantics than he\nwas ever willing to admit. In Novalis’s case, the philosophy of\nBildung, a notion that features prominently in Hegel’s\nown work, would be an important point of connection. Others would be\nhis philosophy of interpretation and his conception of the\nrelationship between pre-modern and modern thought. \nHegel’s negative assessment proved influential to later times\nand readings of Novalis’s work. Even though Novalis’s\nexperimenting with the philosophical form of the fragment paved the\nway for such stylistically bold and innovative thinkers as Kierkegaard\nand Nietzsche, these figures would, with few exceptions, stage\nthemselves as critics rather than followers of romantic philosophy. In\na wider intellectual context, we find Novalis’s writing attacked\nin Heinrich Heine’s work on recent German literature (1836\n[1995]), Rudolf Haym’s Die romantische Schule (1870),\nArnold Ruge and the young Hegelian philosophy of history (which viewed\nromanticism through the lens of the later Friedrich Schlegel’s\nengagement with Metternich and the restoration), and Karl\nMannheim’s sociological explanation of the rise of German\nconservatism (1925 [1986]).  Whereas the young Georg Lukács\napplauds Novalis’s aesthetics and philosophy of nature, the late\nLukács worries about the irrationalism of post-Enlightenment\nGerman thought. From the other side of the political spectrum, there\nis Carl Schmitt’s 1919 critique of the romantic movement as\neffecting a dangerous occasionalism in modern political life. \nAmong the nineteenth century historians it was Wilhelm Dilthey who, in\nhis grand effort to rehabilitate late eighteenth-century German\nphilosophy, was able to see through the myth of Novalis and call for a\nreassessment of his philosophical work. As is the case with\nDilthey’s return to the young Hegel, his reading of Novalis\nemphasizes the humanistic drive of his thinking as well as his\nphilosophy of art and nature, which gets reinterpreted, in\nDilthey’s lexicon, as a budding philosophy of life. Dilthey,\nhowever, situates Novalis with Goethe and Hölderlin, and ends up,\nquite against his own intention, highlighting the aesthetic rather\nthan critical-intellectual force of his philosophy. \nThe philosophical-literary reception of Novalis’s work first\ntook off with Walter Benjamin’s 1919 study of the romantic\nnotion of literary criticism. In situating the young romantics within\nthe paradigm of Fichte’s philosophy of reflection, Benjamin\nplaces himself well within the traditional reception of their work.\nNonetheless, Benjamin’s interest in philosophy of history, his\nrecognition of philosophers such as Herder, Hamann, and Humboldt, and\nhis general openness towards the late eighteenth-century mindset,\nmakes it possible for him to transcend the framework of traditional\n(Hegelian) prejudices and tease out of the romantic idea of criticism\na pregnant conception of art and subjectivity. Furthermore, because he\nviews modernity as a period of aesthetic reflectivity and\nself-criticism, Benjamin is among the first to see in romantic\nphilosophy a prefiguration of aesthetic modernism and the European\navant-garde. This idea would later fuel the growing interest in German\nromantic philosophy amongst French intellectuals, including\nphilosopher-poets like Maurice Blanchot, George Bataille, and, in the\n1970s and 1980s, the chief proponents of literary deconstruction,\nJacques Derrida and, in an Anglophone context, Paul de Man. \nThe broader literary reception of Novalis’s fragments and\npoetical work across comparative literature departments in Europe and\nNorth America contributed to the recent rediscovery of his philosophy:\na rediscovery, one might hope, that will lead to a greater awareness\nof the breadth of his philosophical contribution and a recognition of\nthe fact that his thinking, though celebrated for its religious-poetic\nsensitivity and aesthetic ambience, encompasses much more than that.\nAlthough it is unlikely that Novalis’s work will ever make it to\nthe front rows of academic philosophy, his contribution deserves to be\nrevisited, reread, and reconsidered by scholars of post-Kantian\nthought. Only in this way is it possible fully to reassess the\nsystematic impact of his theory of Bildung, social\nphilosophy, philosophy of history, and theory of language as well as\nhis contribution to aesthetics and philosophy of art.","contact.mail":"kgjesdal@temple.edu","contact.domain":"temple.edu"}]
