Methodological naturalism states that\nthe only authoritative standards are those of science. Ontological and\nepistemological naturalism respectively state that all entities and\nall valid methods of inquiry are in some sense natural. In philosophy\nof mathematics of the past few decades methodological naturalism has\nreceived the lion's share of the attention, so we concentrate on this.\nOntological and epistemological naturalism in the philosophy of\nmathematics are discussed more briefly in section 6.\n\n\n\nMethodological naturalism has three principal and related senses in\nthe philosophy of mathematics. The first is that the only\nauthoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics are those of\nnatural science (physics, biology, etc.). The second is that the only\nauthoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics are those of\nmathematics itself. The third, an amalgam of the first two, is that\nthe authoritative standards are those of natural science and\nmathematics.  We refer to these three naturalisms\nas scientific,\nmathematical, and mathematical-cum-scientific. Note\nthat throughout this entry ‘science’ and cognate terms encompass only the\nnatural sciences. \n\nNaturalism—‘methodological’ and ‘in the\nphilosophy of mathematics’ hereafter understood—seems to\nhave anti-revisionary consequences for mathematics. The\nmathematician-philosopher L.E.J. Brouwer developed intuitionistic\nmathematics, which sought to overthrow and replace standard\n(‘classical’) mathematics. Brouwer attempted to motivate\nintuitionistic mathematics philosophically with an intuition-based\naccount of mathematical truth. A more recent exponent of\nintuitionistic mathematics is Michael Dummett, who has developed\narguments from the philosophy of language, in particular the theory of\nmeaning, on its behalf. Yet scientific standards arguably condone\nclassical over intuitionistic mathematics: even if present-day science\ncould be entirely recast intuitionistically—a\nbig if—it would be less simple and more cumbersome than\nits current classically-based version. Mathematicians also tend to\nview intuitionistic mathematics as inferior to classical mathematics\nif construed as a rival to it. Hence neither Brouwer nor Dummett's\nintuitionism is apparently sanctioned by scientific or mathematical\nstandards, so naturalism rules them out of court.  Indeed, for\nmany of its adherents, that is precisely naturalism's point. Its\npoint, it is often thought, is to block fanciful attacks on\nestablished disciplines such as mathematics by disciplines with less secure\nmethodologies. \n\nContemporary interest in naturalism stems from Quine, whose naturalism\nis prominent in his later works. A representative quotation is that\nnaturalism is ‘the recognition that it is within science itself,\nand not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be identified and\ndescribed’ (Quine 1981, 21). Another major influence is Hilary Putnam, who articulates his scientific naturalism as follows: \n\nThus from this perspective mathematics is judged by scientific standards because\neverything is. Moreover, Quine and Putnam maintain that these\nstandards sanction platonist mathematics because mathematics and its\nplatonist construal are an indispensable part of our best scientific\ntheories. \n\nAlthough naturalism as a self-conscious position in the philosophy of\nmathematics emerges most fully with Quine there are, as always,\nprecursors. The empiricist tradition in its various guises (logical\npositivism, Mill, Hume, etc.) is the most obvious precursor, though\nthere are significant differences between pre-Quinean empiricists and\ncontemporary naturalists. The rise of scientific naturalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics also coincides with a rise in a broader\nscientific naturalism, also in part attributable to Quine, which sees\nall philosophy—not just philosophy of mathematics—as\ntaking place within natural science. Naturalism also goes hand in hand\nwith a now generally prevalent pessimism about traditional\nphilosophical modes of argumentation. \n\nSome version of naturalism is attractive to virtually all\nphilosophers today. That the methodologies of mathematics and science are the\nbest we have seems a platitude, which philosophy should try to\nacknowledge and build on rather than ignore. The question is how\nexactly to do so. \n\nThe past couple of decades have seen a great surge of interest in\nnaturalism. 1997 was an important year in recent philosophy of\nmathematics, as it saw the publication of four books articulating the\npositions of five leading philosophers of mathematics: John Burgess\nand Gideon Rosen's A Subject with No Object, Penelope\nMaddy's Naturalism in Mathematics, Michael\nResnik's Mathematics as the Science of Patterns, and Stewart\nShapiro's Philosophy of Mathematics.  All four books are to\nvarious degrees and amongst other things naturalistic: the first two\nare naturalist manifestos, the third advocates a Quinean scientific\nnaturalism, and the last, though mainly concerned with other matters,\nis sympathetic to naturalism. John Burgess's naturalism, first set out\nin his (1983) and in the past few years elaborated with his colleague\nGideon Rosen (1997, 2005), is perhaps most naturally construed as a\nversion of mathematical-cum-scientific naturalism (1997,\n211). Penelope Maddy's naturalism is a heterogeneous form of\nnaturalism which distinguishes between mathematics proper and the\nphilosophy of mathematics, embracing mathematical naturalism about the\nformer and scientific naturalism about the latter (section 5). Another\nposition suggested by Maddy (1997) is a thoroughgoing mathematical\nnaturalism that takes mathematical standards as authoritative within\nboth mathematics and its philosophy. \n\nIgnoring qualifications, the main contemporary versions of\nnaturalism, with their representative advocates, may be tabulated as\nfollows: \n\nTo illustrate the difference between statements in mathematics proper\nand the philosophy of mathematics, consider as an example of the\nformer the Green-Tao theorem, proved in 2004, which states that the\nsequence of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic\nprogressions (but of course no infinitely long one); as examples of\nthe latter take the platonist claim that the number two exists and is\nabstract or the claim that because mathematical entities are created\nrather than discovered, impredicative definitions are not permissible.\nFor any given philosopher, the Green-Tao theorem and its proof are to\nbe assessed by the standards of the first column. For example, Quine\naccepts the theorem if and only if it is part of the best\nsystematisation of science (which it is assuming that the principles\nfrom which it is deduced and the logic by which it is deduced from those principles are). Similarly, for any given\nphilosopher, platonism and the stricture regarding impredicativity are\nto be assessed by the standards of the second column. For example,\nQuine accepts platonism because he takes it to be the scientifically\nsanctioned interpretation of mathematics: in his view, the mathematics\ncontained in the best systematisation of science is\nplatonic. \n\nThere are no clear exemplars of the view that mathematical standards\nshould be authoritative in philosophy of mathematics, hence the\nquestion mark. David Lewis flirted with this position in his monograph\non set theory (1991, viii–ix, 54), but by the time of his (1993)\nhad already repudiated it. The position is suggested by remarks in\nMaddy (1997), though as we will see in section 5, Maddy (1997) is more\nnaturally interpreted as advancing a heterogeneous form of\nnaturalism. Several other philosophers of mathematics are also\nprofessed naturalists, notably Alan Baker (2001) and Mark Colyvan\n(2001). \n\nLike many –isms, naturalism is perhaps better thought of as an\norientation with doctrinal implications than as a doctrine per se.\nNevertheless, we may attempt to elucidate it along several\ndimensions. \n\nHow should we understand the claim that some set of standards ought\nto be authoritative in the philosophy of mathematics? We may preserve\ngenerality by referring to X-standards, the instances of interest to us\nbeing ‘scientific’, ‘mathematical’ or\n‘scientific-cum-mathematical’. Here are some\n(non-exhaustive) readings of the authority claim: \n\nThe biconditional reading is the strongest of the four. It expresses\nthe thought that valid standards just are X-standards. In contrast with\nbiconditional naturalism, the trumping version apparently allows that a\nstatement in the philosophy of mathematics may be acceptable even if\nX-standards do not sanction it. For instance, Burgess and Rosen express\ntheir naturalism as follows: \n\nThis is naturally glossed as a trumping version of\nscientific-cum-mathematical naturalism. It seems to allow that if\nmathematics and science do not speak with a firm voice on a question,\nwe may accept the verdict of some other discipline. \n\nEmphasis Naturalism is a vaguer doctrine. Various versions arise depending on\nhow much emphasis is placed on X-standards. A modest version captures the position of naturalistically-inclined but not outright naturalist philosophers. We recover biconditional naturalism when X-standards are emphasised to the point where no others matter. \n\nCompatibility naturalism is not as strong as trumping\nnaturalism. If p is sanctioned by X-standards then\ncompatibility naturalism enjoins the non-acceptance of\n¬p but it does not necessarily enjoin the acceptance\nof p. Non-acceptance of ¬p falls short of\nacceptance of p since there is always the option to suspend judgment on\np. The compatibility view is generally accepted by most contemporary\nphilosophers. To take an example from outside the philosophy of\nmathematics, most philosophers would reject a philosophy of time that\nclashes with the theory of relativity (in this case X = science).\nWithin the philosophy of mathematics, most philosophers would reject a\nphilosophy of mathematics that implies, for instance, that complex\nanalysis should be jettisoned (in this case X could be science,\nmathematics, or mathematics-cum-science). \n\nVarious weaker methodological theses are sometimes labelled\n‘naturalist’, for instance the rejection of Cartesian\nfoundationalism, but here we understand the term more robustly. Which\nof the above variants is the right way to develop naturalism depends\nof course on how naturalism is motivated (section 4). \n\nNaturalism sets up an opposition between X-standards (scientific,\nmathematical or scientific-cum-mathematical) and other types of\nstandards, e.g., astrological, theological, or the standards of common\nsense. Another example of standards that the naturalist sees as\non the wrong side of the tracks are ‘fundamental’\nphilosophical ones. Goodman and Quine (in his pre-naturalist phase)\nonce began an article by declaring that the basis for their nominalism\nwas a fundamental philosophical intuition irreducible to scientific\ngrounds (1947). Naturalists reject appeal to such standards. \n\nAn apparent problem with naturalism is that there do not seem to be\nsharp boundaries between science and non-science and between\nmathematics and non-mathematics. For example, the transition from\nphysics to philosophy of physics to physics-heavy metaphysics to\ncommon-or-garden metaphysics seems to be gradual. When a mathematician\nwrites a research article, an undergraduate textbook, a popular book on\nmathematics, a book expounding his personal philosophy of mathematics\nand his psychological associations with various mathematical theories,\nat what point exactly has he stopped doing mathematics? When research\nmathematicians get together after the seminar and agree over coffee\nthat the Riemann Hypothesis is the most important outstanding problem\nin mathematics, is this a strictly mathematical claim or a personal\njudgement recognised by mathematicians as outside the province of\nmathematics proper? \n\nMany philosophers follow Quine by citing a\nstandard cluster of principles putatively constitutive of scientific\nstandards: empirical adequacy, ontological economy, simplicity,\nfertility, and so on (Quine 1955, 247; Quine and Ullian 1970, chapter\n5). However, lists of this kind are unsatisfactory for several\nreasons.  For one thing, the principles come in different\nversions. Yet it is doubtful whether the general versions are the\nscientifically sanctioned ones. Some writers claim, for example, that\nscientific appeal to ontological parsimony does not extend to the\npostulation of abstract objects (Burgess 1998). Others maintain that\nscientific appeals to simplicity are not best captured by the utterly\ngeneral slogan ‘Prefer any theory T1 to\nany less simple theory T2 (in this respect)’\n(Paseau 2007). Moreover, lists of this kind do not tell us how to\nbalance desiderata against one another. \n\nSince the explosion of science studies in the 1960s, more attention\nis now paid to the nuances of scientific practice. Yet a more\nprecise articulation of scientific standards and their weights remains\nelusive. The existence of an algorithm encapsulating the scientific\nmethod is generally questioned (though many human beings apparently\nmanage to implement the scientific method, so if the method is not\nalgorithmic then neither are our minds). What is not questionable,\nhowever, is that its exhibition currently escapes us. \n\nHaving said that, it is not clear how serious the boundary problem\nis for naturalists. Perhaps they can argue that there is a fairly\nsharp boundary, though one that is hard to define. Perhaps\nmathematicians implicitly know when something counts as a piece of\nmathematics and when it is a non-mathematical commentary on\nmathematics. In any case, naturalism seems to survive the absence of a\nsharp boundary. Naturalism can apparently rest its claims on a set of\nstandards with fuzzy boundaries. \n\nWhat if there are no global scientific standards, but just the\nstandards of this or that part of science (e.g., physics or biology, or\nparticle physics or fluid mechanics), or even just the standards of\nthis or that group of scientists? In that case, scientific naturalism\nwould fragment into several versions (e.g., physics-naturalism or\nbiology-naturalism). If the motivation for scientific naturalism points\nto one of these finer-grained naturalisms over the others (e.g.,\nphysics-naturalism), or if they all return the same verdicts in the\nphilosophy of mathematics, the potential fragmentation is not worrying.\nBut if not, the scientific naturalist is in trouble, as all these\ncompeting naturalisms are by assumption equally valid. So far\nscientific naturalists have tended to assume that science operates with\na single set of standards. Plausible though that assumption is, a rigorous naturalist will want to shore it up with detailed\ncase studies. Similarly for mathematical naturalism and\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalism. \n\nScientific standards sanction propositions to a certain degree\nrather than outright. The latest hypothesis at the research coalface\nadopted tentatively by a few experts does not have the same standing as\na long-entrenched theory. Thus the black-or-white notion of scientific\nstandards sanctioning or not sanctioning p will not do. (This is an idea which Bayesian confirmation theory takes seriously.) It might also be argued that\nthis is also true for mathematical standards, for example by considering non-deductive grounds for belief in mathematical\npropositions. It seems reasonable to see Goldbach's\nConjecture, the claim that every even number greater than 4 is the sum\nof two primes, as supported to a high degree by the non-deductive\nevidence currently available for it. In the absence of a\nproof of Goldbach's Conjecture, however, this degree falls short\nof 1. A more precise statement of the naturalist's creed must\ntherefore issue guidelines for apportioning\ncredence in p in line with the degree and type of commitment\nto p scientific or mathematical standards recommend. \n\nIt would be wrong to equate what X-standards sanction with what\nX-practitioners believe (for X = science or\nmathematics or more generally). For one\nthing, X-practitioners may not have given a particular\nquestion any thought. For another, X-practitioners might all\nbe mistaken. Moreover, X-practitioners might self-consciously\nmaintain the opposite of or at any rate something distinct from\nwhat X-standards sanction. For instance, a scientist may\nbelieve p, perhaps on the basis of a ‘gut\nfeeling’ or on account of some overriding religious convictions\nor for whatever non-scientific reason, whilst still recognising that\nscientific standards support not-p. Or a mathematician may\nbelieve that the number 7 has mystical properties but not believe\nit qua mathematician. A tighter connection between practitioners and standards, then, might\nbe this: what X-standards sanction is\nwhat X-practitioners are disposed to correctly\nbelieve qua X-practitioners. (This is not intended\nas a reductive analysis.) \n\nHaving said that, it takes special pleading to attribute widespread\nerror to the community of X-practitioners regarding\nwhat X-standards sanction. Thus what X-practitioners\nin fact believe usually serves as good, though defeasible, evidence\nfor what X-standards sanction. \n\nScientific naturalism as here defined encompasses only\nnatural science (and likewise for scientific-cum-mathematical\nnaturalism). Broader naturalisms take in not just traditional natural\nscience but also some of the other sciences: perhaps all of social\nscience, perhaps only some of it, perhaps linguistics, perhaps\ncognitive science. Note that in later writings Quine himself adopts a\nbroad version of naturalism (1995, 49). Penelope Maddy has more\nrecently made it clear that the form of scientific naturalism she\nespouses—‘Second Philosophy’ as she now prefers to\ncall it—is very broad indeed, taking in not only the natural\nsciences but also psychology, linguistics, sociology, etc. (2007,\n2). \n\nBroadening scientific or scientific-cum-mathematical naturalism to\ninclude these disciplines has potentially significant consequences for\nthe philosophy of mathematics. For instance, if semantics falls under\nthe naturalist umbrella it may provide a naturalistic sanction for\nmathematical realism or platonism, as the face value semantics for\nmathematics seems to assimilate it to the uncontroversially literal\nparts of language—a point famously made in Benacerraf (1973). \n\nWhether to construe naturalism broadly or narrowly depends on its\nmotivation. The attractions of scientific or mathematical or\nscientific-cum-mathematical naturalism lie in the disciplines'\nincomparable success (on some understanding of what this success comes\nto—see section 4). At this point in time, however, the\nnon-natural sciences are less successful than the natural\nsciences. The less successful one deems the non-natural sciences\ncompared to the natural ones, the less attractive a broader scientific\nor scientific-cum-mathematical naturalism becomes in comparison with a\nstrictly natural-scientific one. \n\nAll naturalists, especially those of the broader variety, have to\nbalance potentially competing standards. A broad naturalist might\ndecide, say, to give the natural sciences 2/3-weighting and semantics\n1/3-weighting. Or she might hold that a proposition in the philosophy\nof mathematics is acceptable if (or even: if and only if) all the\nsciences, natural or non-natural, sanction it—that is to say,\nwhen all the sciences speak with one voice.  These balancing questions\nhave unfortunately not been much addressed by naturalists. Perhaps\nthat is because questions of this kind arise for everyone: whichever\njustificatory standards one accepts, the problem of how to adjudicate\nbetween them arises. But to the extent that naturalism is prescriptive\nand cannot rely on an implicit procedure that is already in place, it\nowes us an articulation of how to balance different sets of\nstandards. \n\nThe balancing issue is particularly pressing for\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalists. A scientific naturalist is in\nprinciple happy to say that if a mathematical theory M is\nscientifically superior but mathematically inferior to another\nmathematical theory M* then M should be\npreferred to M* (the next paragraph contains an\nexample). Mathematical-cum-scientific naturalists, however, may come\ndown on either side, depending on the details of the particular\ntheories: it all depends on whether M's scientific advantages\ncompared to M* are outweighed by its mathematical\ndisadvantages. Now the philosophy of mathematics does not have an\nestablished tradition of weighing mathematical theories' scientific\nand mathematical pros and cons against one another; nor does any other\ndiscipline. So the problem of how to balance mathematical and\nscientific standards is particularly pressing for the\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalist. \n\nTo illustrate this problem, suppose, as many philosophers maintain,\nthat the general principle of ontological economy—posit as few\nentities as possible—is a scientific standard. Suppose also, as\nPenelope Maddy maintains, that a set-theoretic version of ontological\nprofligacy—posit as many sets as possible—is a\nmathematical standard (this is one way of cashing out the\nset-theoretic maxim Maddy calls MAXIMIZE). These two\nstandards clash, as Maddy recognises (1997, 131). Thus given these\nassumptions a predicativist set theory which posits a relatively small\nnumber of sets, say of the kind developed in Hermann Weyl's Das\nKontinuum, might be scientifically superior to ZFC, which posits\nmore sets. Yet ZFC is generally thought to be mathematically superior\nto a predicativist set theory. Perhaps the right diagnosis is\nthat the clash is only superficial, since the correct scientific\nversion of ontological economy is ‘posit as\nfew concrete entities as possible’ and the correct\nmathematical version of ontological profligacy is ‘posit as\nmany abstract entities as possible’. However that may\nbe in this instance, the mathematical-cum-scientific naturalist has to come up with a\ngeneral policy for dealing with potential clashes, or argue that no\nsuch clashes are possible. \n\nOne may simply adopt naturalism without providing an argument or\nmotivation for it. But motivations for naturalism buttress it, making\nit internally stronger, and give it dialectical strength, increasing\nits appeal to non-naturalists. They answer the fundamental question:\nwhy exactly those standards? \n\n(The same goes for naturalisms primarily conceived as approaches or\nstances rather than doctrines. Since the publication of her 1997 book,\nPenelope Maddy has clarified that her version of naturalism is a\nstance (Maddy 2001) or a piecemeal approach/method of inquiry (2007,\nsee e.g., p. 19 fn. 15, p. 403). However, stances and approaches to\ninquiry are attractive to the extent that they are well motivated.) \n\nNaturalism is often thought to be a conservative philosophy of\nmathematics, as we suggested in section 1. But actually things are more\ncomplicated. Each of the three naturalisms of interest is revolutionary in some\nrespect. \n\nOur default view is that mathematical standards decide questions in\nmathematics proper, for example questions such as whether\nFermat's Last Theorem or the Axiom of Choice is true. Scientific\nstandards are thought not to affect this: when Andrew Wiles proved\nFermat's Last Theorem in the mid-1990s, he was not particularly\nconcerned with how his proof would go down in physics departments, or\nmore generally its impact on empirical science. Similarly, the claim\nthat if some large cardinal axiom is not scientifically sanctioned\n(perhaps because it leads to no new empirical consequences) then there\nis no good reason to accept it is, as Maddy points out, ‘out of\nstep with the actual practice of set theory’ (1997, 132), and\nindeed out of step with the actual practice of much philosophy. We\nusually do not judge large cardinal axioms by scientific standards; we\njudge them by mathematical standards. Quine was self-consciously going\nagainst the grain when he rejected the higher flights of set theory on\nscientific grounds (1986, 400). \n\nScientific naturalism about mathematics proper is thus a\nphilosophically revolutionary view, since it advocates a different set\nof standards with which to judge mathematics (scientific ones) from\nthe traditional ones (mathematical). It is also potentially\nrevolutionary about mathematics itself, as it might lead to a revision\nof mathematics. (Notice that even if scientific naturalism does not\nentail a revision of mathematics, it still counts as philosophically\nrevolutionary: advocating the replacement of Y-standards with\nX-standards as the proper arbiters in some domain is\nphilosophically revolutionary even if the Y-standards\nand X-standards happen to endorse the same claims in that\ndomain.) Having said that, recent scientific naturalists have tended\nto be mathematically conservative in temperament and have advocated\nlittle or no revision of mathematics. \n\nThese morals also apply to mathematical-cum-scientific naturalism,\nbut to a lesser extent, as the latter gives some weight to mathematical\nstandards in mathematical justification. \n\nThe third of the three naturalisms of interest, mathematical naturalism, is philosophically\nbut not mathematically revolutionary. Mathematically, it is as\nconservative as can be: no standards other than mathematical ones are\nrelevant to the assessment of mathematical claims. Thus no accepted\nmathematics is overturned from without. Yet mathematical naturalism is\na revolutionary stance in the philosophy of mathematics.  To see this,\nsuppose that platonism is part of standard, accepted mathematical\npractice. In that case, mathematical naturalism entails that there is\nno further question of its truth. Loosely put, simply because\nmathematicians (qua mathematicians) are platonists, platonism\nis the correct philosophy of mathematics. This is clearly out of step\nwith philosophical practice: philosophers look to mathematicians'\nviews (qua mathematicians) as defeasible data for the\nphilosophy of mathematics, not its conclusion. Thus we see that the\nsimple characterisation of mathematical naturalism as conservative is\nnot quite right: though mathematically conservative, it is philosophically\nrevolutionary. \n\nIn sum, scientific, mathematical, and mathematical-cum-scientific\nnaturalism are each revolutionary in some respect and face a\ncorresponding burden of proof. We may now appreciate the sense in which\nthe general claim, expressed in section 1, that naturalism is\nanti-revisionary is true and the sense in which it is not.\n \n\nThis also shows that contemporary naturalism is different from the\nlatter Wittgenstein's superficially similar metaphilosophy.\nWittgenstein's anti-philosophy, like naturalism, bars philosophy\nfrom changing mathematics: “Philosophy may in no way interfere\nwith the actual use of language…It leaves everything as it is.\nIt also leaves mathematics as it is” (1953, §163).\nNaturalism's revolutionary tenor, however, means that it does not\nleave everything as it is. \n\nArguments for naturalism are lacking in the literature. Most\nnaturalists simply posit their naturalism and work downstream from it,\nhoping that its consequences will prove attractive to the susceptible\n(Maddy 2007, 3). Naturalism thus effectively becomes a personal\ncredo with little direct attempt to bring anyone else on board:\nI accept only X-standards in some domain because I\nfind them more credible than others. Now perhaps at the end of the day one cannot do better. But we shouldn't assume that at the outset. That is\nall the more important given naturalism's revolutionary features,\nas explained earlier. A conservative theory of justification might\nsanction naturalism given a broadly naturalist starting point; but our\nstarting point, as we have seen, is not that of trumping\nnaturalism: it is at most compatibility naturalism. So an argument for\nanything more than the mildest version of naturalism would be\nwelcome. \n\nNaturalists are motivated by the thought that scientific or\nmathematical standards are the most successful standards we possess.\nBut what does success come to? Very roughly, the following could be\ntaken to be a mark of a discipline's success: (i) among its\npractitioners, there is a widely shared conception of the\ndiscipline's guiding questions and permissible methodology; and\n(ii) there is progress within the discipline in addressing its guiding\nquestions. One may then try to argue along these lines that physics is\nmore successful than metaphysics, that psychology is more successful\nthan parapsychology, and that astronomy is more successful than\nastrology. \n\nAn approach of this kind faces a twofold problem. If anything goes\nwhen it comes to methodology, all sorts of disciplines can achieve\nsuccess without thereby achieving credibility. Consider Guru-ology, the\ndiscipline that takes its guiding questions to be those enunciated by\nsome guru, and lays down as its methodology that acceptable answers are\nall and only the guru's pronouncements (perhaps assuming\nconsistency—so let us assume for good measure that the guru is\nconsistent and more generally probabilistically coherent). These\nanswers could be as fanciful as you like: we leave it to the\nreader's imagination to devise examples of outlandish claims made\nby the guru. If we suppose that the guru answers each of the questions\nthat he raises, Guru-ology is therefore progressive—it answers\nall the questions it raises—and it is therefore successful. But\nits success speaks nothing of its credibility. \n\nIn general, if the success of any given set of standards S\nis gauged on its own terms, i.e., by using S-standards,\nseveral self-supporting but intuitively unacceptable sets of standards\ncount as successful. This relativism is clearly not what the naturalist\nwants. Likewise for the thought that success is to be determined by how\nwell the standards help us to ‘cope with reality’; several\nnon-scientific and non-mathematical naturalisms likewise self-vindicate\nunder this criterion. Perhaps success should instead be measured by how\nwell the standards explain and predict natural phenomena, i.e., with how\nthey cope with the subject matter of natural science. But adopting our\nusual view of how to judge success in this respect would be\nquestion-begging in favour of scientific naturalism, since scientific\nstandards are precisely the standards we have developed to cope with\nthis portion of reality. Compare an astrological naturalism motivated\nby the idea that success is to be measured by how well the standards\nexplain and predict ‘astrological phenomena’, understood as\nthe astrologers do. So if a naturalist argument based on success is to\nsucceed, some other naturalistically acceptable but non-question\nbegging understanding of ‘success’ must be found. \n\nThe second problem with a success argument is that success in one\nsphere is no indication of success in another. Biology is rather\nsuccessful at explaining and predicting biological phenomena. But why\nshould that give it authority over questions in mathematics or the\nphilosophy of mathematics? Likewise for other natural sciences. As we\nshall see, this point generalises. \n\nTraditional philosophy, a naturalist might say, leads to endless\ndisagreement. Science and mathematics, on the other hand, usually reach\nbroad agreement—often consensus—on questions within\ntheir domain. Hence scientific or mathematical standards are to be\npreferred to others. (Such arguments from disagreement and lack of\nconvergence in opinion have featured prominently in other areas of\nphilosophy, notably meta-ethics.) \n\nHowever, the moral that the naturalist wishes to draw from patterns of\nagreement and disagreement seems unwarranted. Agreement or disagreement\nin a community is a contingent matter. A totalitarian state could\nachieve community-wide agreement with chilling efficacy by imposing\nsome preferred set of standards on its subjects. In general, there are\ncountless non-epistemic reasons for agreement or disagreement. It is\ntherefore not agreement that matters, but rather the explanation of why\nagreement obtains. \n\nA more sophisticated version of this argument might therefore be\nbased on the tractability of disagreement rather than on its mere\npresence. Disagreement is rife in both philosophy and science, but only\nin the latter, it might be said, is disagreement tractable. At the very\nleast, progress can be made and perhaps agreement can in principle\nalways be reached. Actual patterns of agreement and disagreement might\nthen be cited as evidence for the respective tractability or\nintractability of debates umpired by, say, scientific and\nnon-scientific philosophical standards. \n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to assess this more\nsophisticated version of the argument, which in one form or\nanother has recently garnered considerable attention outside the\nphilosophy of mathematics. However, note a couple of prima facie difficulties. \n\nIn order to abstract from the contingencies of our epistemic\nsituation, arguments about tractability usually proceed by considering\nhighly idealised subjects, in particular subjects whose factual, logical, etc.\nknowledge far exceeds ours. But the problem with such idealisations is\nthat they seem question-begging. For example, a theological\nanti-naturalist would maintain that factually highly-informed subjects will\nbe apprised of facts about supernatural reality. Our grip on\nidealised subjects and how disagreement between them is likely to\nresolve itself may therefore be too loose to draw any substantive morals from such\nthought experiments. Either that or such arguments are likely to be question-begging.  \n\nSecond, we may grant that considerations of tractability reveal that\nscientific and mathematical standards are more truth-conducive in their\nrespective spheres. Yet that does not seem to provide a warrant for\nthinking that they will be successful in other spheres. (This is the\nsame point we made in connection with the argument from success.) \n\nPerhaps the most promising argument for naturalism is based on\nhistorical success. Scientific and mathematical standards have a better\ntrack record than others; therefore scientific and mathematical\nstandards should be taken as authoritative, in the philosophy of\nmathematics and elsewhere. Observe that like the previous two arguments, this\nargument for naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics is an argument\nfor global naturalism. \n\nSome naturalists have explicitly relied on this motivation. For\nexample, Lewis uses it to reject structuralism as the correct\nphilosophy of set theory in Parts of Classes (1991,\n58–9) even if he disclaims it as an argument; see also Colyvan\n(2001, 33), Shapiro (1997, 30) and Burgess (1998, 197). There is much\nto say about the argument, explored in Paseau (2005). Here we\ncontent ourselves with two critical observations. \n\nSince philosophers deploy apparently different standards, it is not\nclear what it means to say that philosophy as a whole has a poor\nhistorical track record. Consider the early Popper (1935), who held\nthat no amount of evidence can make an unfalsified theory probable (or at least no\nmore probable than any other unfalsified theory). This is the kind of\nexample David Lewis wields to poke fun at philosophy:\nsurely—surely—the standards that led to this\nconclusion are not trustworthy. The theory of relativity is undoubtedly\nmore probable than the as yet unfalsified hypothesis that the world\nwill end in the year 2525. Yet if I do not share Popper's 1935\nstandards, the fact that his then philosophy of science is from my\npoint of view manifestly wrong does nothing to shake my faith in my own\nphilosophical standards. Similarly, take Thomas Aquinas, whose\nphilosophical standards included consonance with the Bible and more\ngenerally with the tenets of the Christian faith. If I am not a\nChristian, the fact that Aquinas' philosophical theology is from\nmy point of view wrong does nothing to shake my faith in my\nphilosophical standards. Thus, that Sir Karl or St Thomas' standards\nwere, as I see it, no good does not tend to undermine my faith in my\nown. \n\nI may therefore agree with the naturalist that philosophy has a\nworse track record than science and mathematics. But it does not follow\nthat the (non-scientific or non-mathematical) standards that I\nuse have a poor track record. If philosophers have\nconsistently assumed a more or less uniform set of standards over the\ncourse of history, and if I too follow in that tradition by\naccepting them as mine, and furthermore if these standards\ndemonstrably have a poorer track record than scientific or mathematical\nstandards, that would be a reason for me to turn naturalist. But\nthe first assumption is at least questionable, and it is not clear what\nremains of the argument from history if my standards'\nantecedents do not have a poor track record. \n\nA second problem with the argument has to do with its application to\nphilosophical questions. Let us agree that scientific standards have a\ngood track record when it comes to answering scientific questions, that\nmathematical standards have a good track record when it comes to\nanswering mathematical questions, and moreover that these track records\nare better than philosophical standards' track record in\nanswering philosophical questions. These facts, however, do not seem to\nbe relevant to the issue of which standards should be treated as\nauthoritative when it comes to philosophical questions. A good track\nrecord in one sphere is not in itself evidence for truth-conduciveness\nin another. \n\nThis by now familiar objection may be illustrated by\nconsidering the debate between platonists and structuralists in the\nphilosophy of mathematics. Platonists interpret ‘1 + 2 =\n3’ as a claim about abstract objects. Structuralists on the\nother hand interpret ‘1 + 2 = 3’ as a claim about what is\nthe case in any structure that satisfies the axioms of\narithmetic. (Here we are thinking of structuralism as the type of view\noften labelled ‘eliminative structuralism’ following\nCharles Parsons, and whose most sophisticated book-length—and\nmodal—version may be found in Hellman (1989).) Naturalists claim\nthat mathematical standards have been more successful in the past and\nhence should be trusted on this issue. But it is by no means clear\nthat this is the\ntype of question concerning which mathematical standards have\na better track record than philosophical ones. Mathematical standards\nhave a good track record when it comes to questions such as whether 1\n+ 2 is equal to 3, or what the series 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + …\nconverges to, or whether the Poincaré Conjecture (concerning\nthe classification of 3-manifolds) is true; but they do not have a\nproven track record when it comes to questions such as whether these\ntruths are platonist or structuralist. (A related objection to the\nargument is that scientific standards do not speak to questions of\ninterpretation, such as the question of which of platonism or\nstructuralism to prefer.  Cf. Paseau (2007).) \n\nIn sum, the need for naturalists to develop these arguments or to\nproduce better ones remains pressing. \n\nSo far we have considered three uniform types of methodological naturalism relating\nto mathematics: scientific, mathematical, and\nmathematical-cum-scientific. Consider now a heterogeneous methodological naturalism\nthat accepts mathematical standards when it comes to mathematics proper\nbut adopts scientific standards for the philosophy of mathematics and\nfor philosophy more generally. Heterogeneous naturalism has been\nadvanced by Penelope Maddy (1997), whose rich contributions have\nanimated and incomparably influenced the debate on naturalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics over the past twenty years. (Maddy now\nprefers to call her naturalism ‘Second Philosophy’, as in\nthe title of her 2007 book, but here we maintain the label\n‘naturalism’ in keeping with the rest of the entry.) \n\nTo begin with, a representative quotation from Maddy: \n\nIn our terminology, Maddy's heterogeneous naturalism is a\ntrumping thesis. As she puts it, ‘if our philosophical account of\nmathematics comes into conflict with successful mathematical practice,\nit is the philosophy that must give’ (1997, 161). Neither philosophy nor science can overturn mathematics' ‘methodological\nverdicts’ (2007, 361), since they are both extra-mathematical tribunals. However, Maddy takes the philosophy of mathematics as opposed to mathematics\nproper to be a branch of natural science, as she explains in the following passage: \n\nThese and similar passages (especially 1997, 200–203) indicate that Maddy takes the philosophy of mathematics to be answerable\nto (natural-) scientific standards. \n\nThe distinctiveness of heterogeneous naturalism is thus that it\nrecommends one set of standards (mathematical) for settling some\nquestions about mathematics—mathematical ones, such as which\naxioms to choose—and another set of standards (scientific) for\nsettling other questions about mathematics left open by the practice\nitself—philosophical ones, such as how to interpret mathematics.\nThis is in contrast to uniform naturalisms in the philosophy of\nmathematics, for example Quinean scientific naturalism, or Burgessian\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalism, or a uniformly mathematical\nnaturalism (also suggested by Maddy (1997) but in our view ultimately not advocated there). \n\nTo explain how this bivalent attitude might work in practice, take\nMaddy's favourite example: set theory. Suppose that ZFC + LCA is our\ncurrent accepted set theory, where LCA is some collection of large\ncardinal axioms. Given mathematical naturalism about\nmathematics proper, there is no question of rejecting ZFC + LCA in\nfavour of, say, ZFC + the axiom that there are no inaccessibles, or\nsome other set theory, say Quine's New Foundations. Mathematical\nstandards sanction ZFC + LCA, so that is the set theory we must\naccept. But how should we interpret ZFC + LCA? Platonistically, structurally or in some other way? That is a philosophical question, so given scientific naturalism about the philosophy of mathematics (and philosophy more generally) its correct\nanswer is that sanctioned by scientific standards. For example,\nif an overriding scientific criterion of simplicity favours platonism\nover all other interpretations, that must be the correct\ninterpretation of ZFC+LCA. \n\nMaddy motivates her naturalism by appeal to the “fundamental\nspirit that underlies all naturalism: the conviction that a successful\nenterprise, be it science or mathematics, should be understood or\nevaluated on its own terms, that such an enterprise should not be\nsubject to criticism from, and does not stand in need of support from,\nsome external, supposedly higher point of view” (1997, 184).\nOne strained reading of this sentence is that naturalism's fundamental\nconviction by definition applies only to natural science and\nmathematics. A more natural reading is that it applies to any\nsuccessful science whatsoever. Maddy then claims that as a matter of\nfact non-mathematical grounds have not impinged on mathematics. We can\nexpress this as the thesis that mathematics\nis autonomous. \n\nThe assessment of Maddy's heterogeneous naturalism consists\nprincipally in the assessment of the autonomy thesis regarding\nmathematics and its implications. One question is whether the thesis is\ntrue. Another is whether, if true, the thesis supports heterogeneous\nnaturalism. \n\nMaddy claims that the correct model of mathematical justification\nwill vindicate the hypothesis that traditionally scientific or\nphilosophical arguments do not enter into the justification of\nmathematical statements. For example, the French analysts Baire, Borel\nand Lebesgue criticised the Axiom of Choice on the basis of a\ndefinabilist methodology, according to which the existence of an object\ndepends on its definability: functions should be definable rules,\nmembership of a set should given in a definable way, etc. But\ndefinabilism ended up having no influence on the practice of\nmathematics, and its sympathisers were silenced or gave up on it when\nits mathematically undesirable features became clear. For example,\nthe Axiom of Choice allows the taking of maximal ideals in rings and\nother structures; it entails the kinds of maximality principles that even the analysts were\nalready using; it simplifies transfinite arithmetic; and despite its\nsuspicious abstractness it turns out to be equivalent to\n‘concrete’ and ‘mathematical’ statements such\nas the claim that every vector space has a basis. The reasons for\naccepting the Axiom of Choice were in the end purely mathematical. \n\nMaddy also offers an admirably detailed account of the kinds of\nmathematical reasons that militate against the ‘Axiom’ of\nConstructibility, V = L, in particular the fact that its adoption goes\nagainst the set-theoretical maxim MAXIMIZE, which enjoins that\nthe universe of sets should be as expansive as possible (by containing\nas many isomorphism types as possible). \n\nMost commentators have let the descriptive component of\nMaddy's naturalism, the autonomy thesis, pass, focusing criticism\ninstead on its normative implications. Yet the autonomy thesis is very\nradical. The usual picture of the interaction between mathematics and\nphilosophy is of a two-way street. In particular, it is usually thought\nthat philosophy impinges to some degree on mathematical practice.\nIntuitionists for example take the dependence to be profound: they think that all of mathematical practice rests on a false philosophical\nfoundation and that once that foundation is removed, mathematics\ntotters. \n\nMaddy willingly concedes that philosophical doctrines such as\ndefinabilism or realism are important inspirations for mathematical\ndevelopment even if they fall short of justifications (1997, 192).\nAnd she accepts that “theories of mathematical truth or\nexistence or knowledge do in fact appear in most mathematical debates\nover proper methods, alongside more typically mathematical\nconsiderations” (2007, 348). But she maintains that such\ntheories have not in the end played an ‘instrumental role’\n(2007, 359), and that they have racked up a ‘track record of\nirrelevance’ (2007, 366) in the development of mathematics. \n\nSo do philosophical (or more generally\nnon-mathematical) considerations always fall on the side of inspiration\nrather than justification? Well, philosophical considerations are\nhardly ever advanced in mathematical journals or books. And whenever\nthey are Maddy sees them as amounting, when one scratches the surface,\nto ‘intra-mathematical’ arguments (1997, 193), of which a\nnaturalized model of the practice would be ‘purified’,\nbecause of their methodological irrelevance (1997, 197). If she is right, this reply generalises from this particular, rather restricted, type of context to all mathematical contexts. \n\nOne of the implications of this view is that the kinds of\nmaxims Maddy sees as purely internal to mathematics, such as\nMAXIMIZE or UNIFY, are never themselves underlain by\nphilosophical beliefs. UNIFY is a methodological consequence\nof set theory's foundational ambition of providing ‘a\nsingle system in which all objects and structures of mathematics can be\nmodelled or instantiated’ (1997, 208–9). Yet perhaps\nUNIFY and set theory's foundational ambition—the\nfact that as Maddy correctly observes, “set theory is (at least\npartly) designed to provide a foundation for classical\nmathematics” (2007, 355)—are themselves in some small\nway, perhaps to some slight degree, underpinned by set-theoretic\nrealism, i.e., the view that set theory is about a single universe of\nsets. Likewise for the Axiom of Choice, which on the surface owes its\nplace in the set-theoretic canon partly—perhaps only to a small\ndegree—to an ingrained realism about set theory. Several set\ntheorists are on record as making claims to that effect, so the burden\nof proof is on Maddy to explain away these remarks. \n\nMaddy also employs the following problematic style of argument. She\nthinks that the fact that philosophical debates (e.g., about realism)\nare wide open but that mathematics has developed in a particular way\n(e.g., to allow impredicative methods) shows that philosophical debates\nhave not affected the outcome of modern mathematics (e.g., 2007, \n348). But the fact that a debate about realism is wide open in\nphilosophy does not mean that it is wide open in mathematics. Perhaps\nmathematicians have implicitly taken a realist stance, which in part\nunderlies their acceptance of impredicativity, even as philosophers\ncontinue to debate the correctness of realism as a philosophy of\nmathematics. Mathematics may be philosophically parti pris,\nwhich is why it has developed the way it has. \n\nThese points against the autonomy thesis are hardly conclusive. To\nevaluate it, greater clarity is required on where the boundary between\njustification and inspiration lies and what exactly it means to say that something falls on one side or the other. And of course we then need to identify more precisely\nwhich of the factors in the evolution of mathematics are justificationally operative and\nwhich idle. However, even if the autonomy thesis is not true,\nperhaps it is almost true. And perhaps nothing quite as strong as an\nautonomy thesis is required to support trumping as opposed to\nbiconditional naturalism. \n\nThat a statement-issuing practice is as a matter of fact autonomous\ndoes not entail that its statements are thereby acceptable. Practices\nmay be hermetically sealed from outside influence (e.g., astrology,\ndogmatic theology), but that does not in itself make their claims\nacceptable. What makes mathematics different? \n\nMaddy recognises this problem for her position (1997, 203–5;\n2005, 449; 2007, 346–7), which reviews and discussions of her\nwork have seized upon (e.g., Dieterle 1999, Rosen 1999, Roland 2007;\nonly Tappenden (2001) is more sympathetic). She addresses it by making\na distinction between pure and applied disciplines. Taking astrology as\na foil, she notes that applied astrology may be construed as making\nclaims about the empirical world. Using her ordinary scientific\nstandards, the scientific naturalist appreciates that applied astrology\nis false (as it diverges from the accepted scientific story). Hence\napplied astrology does not deserve the naturalist's respect. Pure\nastrology in contrast is astrology interpreted as treating of\n‘certain supernatural vibrations that don't interact\ncausally with ordinary physical phenomena’ (1997, 204).\nHowever, there is no reason to believe in pure astrology, since it does\nnot feature in our best scientific theory of the world. On either\ninterpretation, then, astrology is disanalogous to mathematics. \n\nMaddy seems to want to have her cake and eat it. The reason for\nmathematics' credibility is supposed to be its application in\nscience. But why should the fact that mathematics features in our best\nscience be a reason for believing mathematicians'\nutterances—that is, a reason for taking them to be true? The\nsuspicion is that if featuring in best science is the mark of\ncredibility, it should be scientific standards that ultimately\ndetermine mathematical theories' acceptability. Maddy has indeed\ncited a feature distinguishing mathematics from pure astrology, as she\npoints out (2007, 390); but what still remains unclear is why\nthis feature should make mathematics rather than science\nauthoritative with respect to questions in mathematics proper. Thus it\nseems that she has not explained how one can consistently be a\nmathematical naturalist about mathematical theories but a scientific\nnaturalist about everything else, including the truth and nature of\nmathematics. More generally, given that a practice issues in\ntruth-evaluable statements, it seems that one cannot advocate\nX-standards as the arbiters of these statements' acceptability\nwhile simultaneously advocating a different set of standards, the\nY-standards, as arbiters of whether or not the statements should be\ntaken as true, how they should be interpreted, etc. Notice that this is a problem\nfaced exclusively by heterogeneous as opposed to uniform \nnaturalism. \n\nThe only way to avoid this apparent inconsistency is to suppose that\nto ‘accept’ a statement sanctioned by mathematical\npractice—a statement to which the autonomous practice of\nmathematics gives the thumbs-up—does not amount to taking it as\ntrue. Although suggested by a couple of passages in Maddy (1997), this\ninterpretation is not one that can seriously be put on her\nbook. Besides, it is tantamount to scientific naturalism in all but\nname. It amounts to the claim that whatever mathematicians spend their\ntime saying, doing, and publishing should not be interfered with, but\nthat we should be mindful only to believe those mathematical claims\nsanctioned on scientific grounds, whether or not they are given the\nthumbs-up in mathematicians' language-game. \n\nThis picture has recently been complicated by Maddy's\nclaims that what she calls Arealism—not taking set theory and\nmore generally mathematics to be true—may be just as\nscientifically respectable as Thin Realism—roughly, the view that\nsets have only the properties ascribed to them by set theory (2007,\nIV.4). This entry does not have space to do justice to this twist in\nMaddy's metaphilosophy. Suffice it to note the following. The issues\njust discussed seem to arise for the Thin Realist just as much as any\nother kind of realist. And the Arealist construal seems to transform\nMaddy's position into something quite different from the\nheterogeneous naturalism under consideration here. \n\nTurning away from methodological naturalism, consider now ontological\nnaturalism, the view that all entities are natural. One way to read\nthis is that only the entities posited by the natural sciences\nexist. A second and perhaps more natural reading is that only\nspatiotemporal entities exist. We address both readings briefly in\nthis final section, and take in epistemological naturalism briefly in 6.3. \n\nOn its first reading, ontological naturalism in the philosophy of\nmathematics is a straightforward consequence of methodological\nscientific naturalism. It states that the ontology of mathematics is\nthe mathematical ontology of our best natural science. Scientific\nplatonists claim, following Quine and Putnam, that this ontology is\nplatonist, as do mathematical-cum-scientific platonists (e.g., Burgess\nand Rosen (1997)). Resistance to scientific platonism and the\nassociated indispensability argument has been mounted on several fronts\n(e.g., Field 1980, Sober 1993, Maddy 1997, ch. II.6, Paseau 2007).\nConsult Colyvan (2011) for a detailed discussion. \n\nThe second reading of ontological naturalism, according to which all\nentities are spatiotemporal, amounts to a version of anti-platonism in\nthe philosophy of mathematics. \n\nThe position subdivides. On a reductionist view, mathematics is\ntaken at logico-grammatical face value but its objects (numbers,\nfunctions, sets, etc.) are taken to be spatiotemporal. This view is\nadvocated for sets in Armstrong (1991) and more generally in Bigelow\n(1988). Non-reductionist views are manifold. They include taking\nmathematics as meaningless symbol-manipulation (formalism), or as the\nexploration of what is true in all structures obeying the axioms\n(structuralism), or as the exploration of what is true in all possible\nstructures obeying the axioms (modal-structuralism). Bueno\n(forthcoming) discusses various nominalisms, i.e., views which\ncountenance only spatiotemporal entities. Since many of these\nnominalisms are compatible with non-naturalist as well as ontologically\nnaturalist motivations, we do not discuss them here. We concentrate on\na handful of issues relating mainly to reductionist versions of\nontological realism. \n\nReductionist ontological naturalism and non-modal structuralism about\nset theory face an immediate problem: there are apparently far fewer\nentities in spacetime than there are sets. Even on the most liberal\nassumptions (spacetime points and arbitrary regions thereof exist,\nsome smallish infinity of entities may be collocated at any of these\npoints or regions), the size of spacetime and the objects in it is a\nrelatively low infinite cardinality (surely no more than\nω—even that is generous). Thus there are\nnot enough spatiotemporal entities to interpret set theory literally\nnor to make a structural interpretation of set theory non-vacuously\ntrue, and hence to ensure that set-theoretic falsehoods come out false\nrather than true. See Paseau (2008) for discussion of this and other\nproblems for set-theoretic reductionism. \n\nAnother problem is that even if spacetime were large enough to\nprovide either a model for a literal interpretation of set theory or an\ninstance for its structural interpretation, this would be a contingent\nfact about our universe. Set theory would be true but contingent. Since\nwe typically think of mathematics as necessary, however, this is an\nuntoward consequence for a philosophy of mathematics. Some might even\ncall it a reductio. \n\nVersions of these problems also affect Mill's empiricism\n(1843). For Mill, mathematics and logic are natural sciences, and their\nprinciples are laws of nature. Arithmetic, for instance, is the theory\nof aggregates, i.e., the theory of collections of concrete entities.\nGeometry is the theory of idealised limits of concrete\nentities—lines, points, planes and so on—whose principles\nare “real facts with some of their circumstances exaggerated or\nomitted” (Mill 1843, vol. 1, bk. II, ch.v). Millian philosophy of\nmathematics is susceptible to the cardinality problem just given. (Of\ncourse this is an anachronistic criticism, since infinitary set theory\nhad yet to be developed in Mill's time.) As for the\ncontingency of mathematics, Mill bit the bullet and accepted it. \n\nA related problem for a Millian view, which arises even for the\nmathematics of Mill's day, is a dilemma concerning the existence\nof aggregates of aggregates, aggregates of aggregates of\naggregates…. Higher-order aggregates, if they exist, can only be\nabstract—what else? But if they do not exist—if there are\nonly first-order aggregates—then in particular there are no\nnumbers of numbers, for instance it is meaningless or false to say that\nthere are two primes between 20 and 30. \n\nKitcher (1983) is an attempt to resuscitate Mill's philosophy\nof mathematics by modalising it. It accounts for mathematical truth in\nterms of the operations of a possible but non-actual ideal agent, and\nthus falls under the heading of modalist philosophies of mathematics.\n(Though Kitcher himself is not fond of the label (1983, \n121–2).) \n\nOther apparent problems for reductionist ontological naturalism\ninclude the problem of arbitrariness and the fact that it goes\nprofoundly against mathematical method. Suppose arithmetic is the study\nof some particular spatiotemporal entities. Very well; but which ones?\nSurely it is arbitrary which spatiotemporal entity is chosen as the\nnumber zero. This criticism is a version of a general anti-reductionist\nargument presented in Benacerraf (1965). The response to it is usually\nthat reductionism does not seek to uncover the meaning of number terms\nbut instead proposes a theoretical identification (Paseau 2009).  The charge of contradicting mathematical method is a serious one too. If mathematical objects are\nspatiotemporal, why do mathematicians not perform experiments to\ndiscover their properties? If mathematics were genuinely concerned with\nthe spatiotemporal, surely its methodology would be more\nempirical. \n\nOntological naturalist views of the type discussed are for these and\nrelated reasons seen as problematic, and are consequently\nunpopular. \n\nWhatever their motivation, ontological naturalists are by definition\n(on this second reading of the doctrine) agreed that platonism is\nfalse. Sometimes ontological naturalism is motivated by metaphysical\ndoctrines, for instance by the principle that everything that exists\nhas causal powers. Subscribers to this principle include Armstrong\n(1997) who calls it the Eleatic Principle; for criticism, see Colyvan\n(2001 ch. 3) and Papineau (2009). \n\nThe most popular argument for ontological naturalism is\nepistemological, and consequently ontological naturalism is often\nallied with epistemological naturalism. If there are abstract entities\nthen it seems we cannot know nor form reliable beliefs about them\n(Benacerraf 1973, Field 1989), because of their causal isolation from\nus. Most philosophers take this to be the main problem afflicting\nplatonism. Note that the argument typically leads to agnosticism\nrather than denial of abstract mathematical objects' existence. This\nis not the place to engage with the argument—for more details,\nsee Balaguer (2009)—save to sketch how a platonist who is also a\nscientific or mathematical-cum-scientific naturalist—e.g.,\nQuine—responds to it. \n\nThe naturalist-platonist response is two-pronged (Burgess and Rosen\n1997, 2005; for criticism, see Linnebo 2006, Chihara 2006). The first\nprong is that no simple criterion for knowledge (or reliable belief or\njustified belief) has ever been devised that succeeds in ruling out\nknowledge of the abstract without thereby ruling out types of knowledge\nmost naturalists would accept (Steiner 1975). A couple of examples: (i)\nthe condition that p is a cause of the belief that p\nis too strong, as it rules out knowledge of the future; (ii) as the\nnaturalist-platonist sees it, that abstract mathematical reality is\nthus-and-so is in fact part of the best explanation for the belief that\np; hence an explanatory condition of this kind turns out to be\ncompatible with platonism. Moreover, naturalist-platonists complain\nthat even if a criterion were found that draws the line where the\nnominalist wishes it to be drawn, it would beg the question against\nplatonism. \n\nSecondly, naturalist-platonists run a standard Quinean line by\nconstruing any challenge to the reliability of our beliefs about\nplatonic mathematical objects as a general challenge to the scientific\nmethod's reliability. (This is from the point of view of the\nscientific naturalist; the scientific-cum-mathematical naturalist can\nrun the same line with corresponding adjustments.) However, by our best\nlights—according to our best theory of the world, i.e., natural\nscience, which posits abstract mathematical objects—belief in\nabstract mathematical entities is arrived at by a reliable method,\nnamely the scientific method. This is not simply self-vindication, since the\nscientific method is here being used to explain the reliability of\nmathematical beliefs, albeit holistically. But of course if the\nreliability of the scientific method itself is put into question, the\nnaturalist has no choice but to use the scientific method itself to\nexplain its own reliability. The naturalist-platonist may add that we\ncan do no better, and that anyone who questions the scientific\nmethod's reliability has thereby abandoned the naturalist camp.\nFrom this perspective, then, there is no epistemological problem for\nplatonism once it is settled that platonist mathematics is part of best\nscience."}]
