Attributes furnish Spinoza’s\nsubstance with variety while preventing it from being an ephemeral,\nhomogenous totality—an eleatic “one” of which nothing\ncan be said or known. They constitute variety without dissolving the\ninfinite substance into multiple substances.\n\n\n\nSpinoza defines the term “attribute” in Definition 4 of\nPart One of the Ethics thus: “Per attributum\nintelligo id, quod intellectus de substantia percipit, tanquam ejusdem\nessentiam constituens.” That is, “By attribute I\nunderstand what the intellect perceives of substance as constituting\nits essence.”[1]\n Nonetheless, it is astonishing how little agreement there is among\nscholars as to some of the most basic features of Spinoza’s\ntheory of attributes. For this reason, this article first considers the important\nplaces where Spinoza establishes fundamental characteristics of\nattributes: such as their definition, their real distinction, and their\nidentification with the substance. It then explains the main\nissue on which interpretations diverge and signals in broad terms which\ninterpretative avenues have been taken or are conceptually open\n(without delving too deeply into any one of them). In light of these\nvery different interpretative avenues the article revisits some of the\ncharacteristics explained in the first part and considers how they are\naffected by the different kinds of interpretations. Finally, and\nperhaps most importantly, given the holistic and systematic nature of\nSpinoza’s metaphysics and the central role attributes play in it,\nthe article points out how the different interpretative options on one\nissue bear on others (e.g. the number of attributes and the\nunderstanding of 2P7 and its scholium). The different ways of\nunderstanding Spinoza’s theory of attributes inevitably give rise\nto very different conceptions of Spinoza’s metaphysics as a\nwhole.\n\n\n\nBefore discussing the theory of attributes in the Ethics,\nit will be helpful to keep in mind a rudimentary sketch of the general\nstructure of Spinoza’s\nontology:[2] \n\nThere is only an infinite substance (1P14), that is, there are no\ncreated substances. The infinite substance consists of infinite\nattributes (1D6). Every mode, be it finite or infinite, must be\nconceived through an attribute (1D5, 1P10Schol, 2P6 and 2P6Dem).\nFinally, what other philosophers consider to be “created\nsubstances,” such as my mind (as well as my body), are finite\nmodes for Spinoza\n(1P11).[3] \n\nSpinoza is not the first to furnish his metaphysics with attributes\nand in that he is following a very long tradition. He is, though,\nmostly influenced by Descartes, and in some ways is trying to keep with\nDescartes’ notion of “attribute.” It therefore will\nbe useful to look back and get a sense of what Descartes had in mind\nand thus get a preliminary grasp (which will be revised) of what\nSpinoza means by “attribute.” Descartes states in the\nPrinciples of Philosophy that attributes are the essence of a\nthing, so the essence of mind is thought or thinking, and the\nessence of body is to be extended (Principles, I, §53,\nCSM, I, p. 210, AT 25). To see why this is so, it is worth revisiting\nthe first and second Meditations, even if very briefly. Let us\nbegin with body and Extension. To understand the essence of body, we\ncan look to the famous wax example in Meditation Two\n(CSM, II, p. 20–21, AT 30–32). While sitting by the\nfireplace, Descartes inspects a piece of wax and asks himself what he\nknows of the wax. He begins by listing all the sensory properties of\nthe wax: it is white, has a certain smell, makes a certain sound when\none raps it with one’s finger, is hard, and has a certain taste.\nAfter listing all its sensory properties, he then places the piece of\nwax by the fire and sees how it loses all those properties: it\nchanges color, smell, texture, taste, etc. Descartes concludes, among\nother things, that the essence of the wax, insofar as it is a body, is\nthat it is extended in length, breadth, and depth since that\nis the only thing that remains constant about the wax. In this respect,\nthe piece of wax is no different from any other body—that is, its\nessence is to be extended. Extension, then, according to Descartes, is\nthe essence of body. In the Meditations we also, famously,\ncome to recognize our own essence as thinking things. We realize this\nby recognizing that we cannot doubt that we are doubting while\ndoubting. Furthermore, we realize that doubting in this sense is no\ndifferent from understanding, affirming, denying, willing, unwilling,\nimagining, and having sense perceptions (seeming to see, etc.) (CSM,\nII, p. 19, AT 28). Descartes then reaches the conclusion that the\nessence of the mind is Thought. For these reasons, Descartes claims\nthat Thought and Extension are the principal attributes of mind and\nbody and that they are “really distinct”, that is, they\nexist independently one from the\nother.[4]\n It is important to note\nthat for Descartes, any created substance has only one\nprincipal attribute, as opposed to God who has infinite attributes. \n\nSpinoza adopts some aspects of the Cartesian set up while rejecting\nothers. He agrees that Thought and Extension are attributes (2P1, 2P2)\nand are related to essences (1D4). He agrees they are “really\ndistinct” from each other\n(1P10Schol).[5]\n Furthermore, he agrees\nthat “mind” has to be conceived through Thought, and\n“body” through Extension. (2P5 and its demonstration make\nthe case with regard to ideas and Thought; 2D1 establishes it for\nbodies and Extension. This is also made very clear in 3P2 and its\ndemonstration.) However, he does not agree that they are attributes of\ncreated substances, since he rejects the possibility of\ncreated substances altogether (1P6Cor., 1P8Schol1, 1P14). One way to\nunderstand Spinoza is to see how he can hold both Thought and Extension\n(and other attributes, if there are others) to be divine attributes or\nattributes of one and the same (infinite)\nsubstance.[6] \n\nSpinoza defines the term “attribute” thus:\n“By attribute I understand what the intellect perceives\nof substance as constituting its essence” (1D4). This definition\nis reminiscent of Descartes’ notion of attributes as it appears\nin the Principle of Philosophy insofar as attributes are\nrelated to the essence (or essences) of substance. However, as many\nhave noticed, it is not clear from the definition alone what exactly\nSpinoza means. There are several, by now famous, ambiguities in\nthe\n definition.[7]\n These, together with the different\ninterpretative options, are discussed in\n Section 1.8. \n\nSpinoza makes a very important claim about attributes in the\nScholium to Proposition 10 of Part One: “…although two\nattributes may be conceived to be really distinct (i.e., one may be\nconceived without the aid of the other), we still cannot infer from\nthat that they constitute two beings, or two different\nsubstances.” Spinoza here is explaining something about the\nrelationship among attributes—one may be conceived without the\naid of the other—and about the relation of the attributes to the\nsubstance, namely, that conceiving attributes independently is not\nevidence of the existence of independent substances. \n\nTo understand why this scholium is so important, it is helpful to\nrecall Descartes’ definition of a “real distinction.”\nIn the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes says:\n“Strictly speaking, a real distinction exists only\nbetween two or more substances; and we can perceive that two substances\nare really distinct simply from the fact that we can clearly and\ndistinctly understand one apart from the other”\n(Principles, I, §60, CSM, I, p. 213, AT 28). For\nDescartes, this anchors the strict epistemological and ontological separation between mind and\nbody. One of the things we learn from going through the\nMeditations is that we are capable of clearly and distinctly\nperceiving ourselves without a body—the cogito in the\nSecond Meditation, and we clearly and distinctly perceive body\nwithout thinking in the Fifth Meditation. (Of course, in\nretrospect, we realize that we already did this in a sense with the wax as\nwell). Descartes thus concludes that mind and body are really distinct,\nthat is, one can exist without the other. \n\nOne important implication of this distinction is that it allows for\na fully mechanistic explanation of the physical world. To explain the\ninteraction between two bodies requires alluding only to their physical\nproperties (size, shape and motion) without the need to take recourse\nto any Aristotelian explanation involving\n final causes.\nMaking room for mechanistic explanations, that is, for the\nNew Science, was one of Descartes’ chief motivations for writing\nthe Meditations. Spinoza preserves this aspect of\nCartesian doctrine (cf. appendix to Part One of the Ethics and\ndiscussion in\n Section 1.3.1). \n\nHaving separated the mind so sharply from the body, Descartes is\nleft with having to explain their evident unity. More specifically, he\nis burdened with trying to explain how two really distinct substances\nseem to interact causally. Their causal interaction seems\nproblematic because, according to Descartes, each substance is\nindependent; the infinite substance depends on nothing but itself\n(Principles, I, §51, CSM, I, p. 210, AT 24), while\ncreated substances depend on nothing but God for their\nexistence (Principles, I, §52, CSM I, p. 210, AT 25). If\ndistinct substances interact causally then they seem to depend on one\nanother, and this would go against their nature qua\nsubstances. This is why the union of the mind and body is a\nthorny issue for Descartes, and was and continues to be a source of\nmuch debate (Cf. for example, Hoffman, 1986). For some, a version of\nthis problem translates into Spinoza’s metaphysics (cf.\nSection\n 1.9.4).\nThe issue of the nature of the\n“real distinction” for Spinoza is discussed in the\nsubsequent section. \n\nFor Descartes, then, there is the epistemological claim that\nperceiving Thought does not involve perceiving Extension and vice\nversa. Each is explanatorily independent from the other, (although not\nfrom God). Spinoza adopts this aspect of Cartesian philosophy and\nholds, as well, that there is what Della Rocca calls, “a\nconceptual barrier” between Thought and Extension as Spinoza\nstates in the scholium “i.e., one may be conceived without the\naid of the other” (Della Rocca, 1996, 9–17). Spinoza holds\nThought and Extension to be explanatorily self-contained. Physical\nchanges are to be understood in terms of other physical items, and\nideas are to be understood in terms of other ideas. What is ruled out\nis what can be called “cross attribute explanations.” For\nexample, explaining the movement of my hand by my desire to move my\nhand. According to Spinoza, the movement of my hand is to be explained\npurely physically by alluding to other bodies and their motions, while\nmy desire is to be explained by other desires and ideas. Spinoza makes\nthis very clear in 3P2, its demonstration and scholium: \n\n3P2: The body cannot determine the mind to thinking, and the mind\ncannot determine the body to motion, to rest, or to anything else (if\nthere is anything else). \n\nDem.: All modes of thinking have God for a cause, insofar as he is a\nthinking thing, and not insofar as he is explained by another attribute\n(by 2P6). So what determines the mind to thinking is a mode of thinking\nand not of extension, that is (by 2D1), it is not the body. This was\nthe first thing. \n\nNext, the motion and rest of a body must arise from another\nbody…whatever arises in the body must have arisen from God\ninsofar as he is considered to be affected by some mode of extension,\nand not insofar as he is considered to be affected by some mode of\nthinking (also 2P6), that is, it cannot arise from the mind, which (by\n2P11) is a mode of thinking. This was the second point. Therefore, the\nbody cannot determine the mind, and so on, q.e.d. \n\nAlthough this is reminiscent of Descartes in some respects, there\nis, of course, one crucial difference. For Descartes the fact that one\ncan conceive Thought distinctly from Extension is evidence for the\nexistence of two substances—mind and body. For Spinoza, this is\nnot the case, and this is the point he is making in this central\nproposition (1P10), namely, that although two attributes may be\nconceived independently—one without the other—this does\nnot imply that there are two substances existing separately.\nFor Spinoza there is only one substance with infinite attributes, and\nalthough each attribute is conceived independently from the other/s\nthey still are, nonetheless, all attributes of one and the same\nsubstance. It is possible then to conceive, think, or completely\nexplain the entire universe, or everything that exists, under each one\nof the attributes. That is, we can give a complete physical description\nof everything that exists, or alternatively explain, describe, or\nconceive everything as ideas or thought. Being able to explain the\nentire universe under the attribute of Extension is what allows Spinoza\nto preserve Descartes’ effort of providing room for progress in\nthe New Science (Cf. Appendix to Part One). \n\nSpinoza and Descartes agree about the epistemological separation\nbetween Thought and Extension, but not about the ontological one.\nDescartes calls the distinction between attributes of the same\nsubstance, and between a given attribute and its substance a\n“rational distinction,” (Principles, I, §62,\nCSM, I, p. 214, AT 30) and so, insofar as Thought and Extension belong\nto the same substance for Spinoza, they would be, in Descartes’\nterminology, rationally\n distinct.[8]\n Spinoza however, says\nthat they are “really distinct.” How exactly to\nunderstand the “reality” of the distinction among the\nattributes is a crucial interpretative matter and is discussed in\nSections 1.8.1–1.8.2. \n\nAnother claim that has to be taken into account in an analysis of\nSpinoza’s view on attributes is that God is his\nattributes: 1P4: “Therefore, there is nothing outside the\nintellect through which a number of things can be distinguished from\none another except substance, or what is the same (by 1D4),\ntheir attributes, and their affections” (italics added), 1P19:\n“God is eternal, or [sive] all God’s\nattributes are eternal,” 1P20Cor.: “It follows second, that\nGod, or [sive] all of God’s attributes, are\nimmutable.” Some might consider 1P29Schol to be making an\nidentity claim as well: “But by Natura Naturata I\nunderstand whatever follows from the necessity of God’s nature,\nor [sive] from any of God’s\nattributes…” Spinoza in these places seems to be claiming\nthat there is an identification of the substance with its attributes.\nHowever, this identification can be understood in several ways and in\nvarious degrees of strictness. How one reads this claim depends on\nother considerations discussed in\n Section 1.9.3. \n\nOne of the important things that Spinoza does in the first two parts\nof the Ethics is to establish Extension as a divine attribute\n(elements of this view are evident already in KV I/25). Although\nSpinoza adopts many important aspects of Cartesian metaphysics, he\ncollapses\nthe divide between the infinite and created substances. This\nmeans that principal attributes that were at the “created\nsubstance” level in the Cartesian set-up are “moved\nup”, so to speak, to the infinite substance level for Spinoza.\nOne of these attributes is, of course, Extension. Spinoza has to\nexplain to a resistant audience how Extension can be considered a\ndivine attribute. \n\nThe important steps that will allow Spinoza to claim that Extension\ncan be an attribute of God are the following. He defines God as a\nsubstance consisting of infinite attributes\n (1D6).[9]\n He shows that\nsubstances cannot share attributes (1P5), that every substance is\ninfinite (1D8), that a single substance can have several attributes\n(1P10schol), and that an infinite substance exists (1P11). With an eye\ntowards specifically establishing Extension as a divine attribute, he\nclaims in 1P12: “No attribute of a substance can be truly\nconceived from which it follows that the substance can be\ndivided.” In 1P13, he states: “A substance which is\nabsolutely infinite is indivisible,” and in the corollary, he\nmakes the point especially clear with respect to Extension: “From\nthese propositions it follows that no substance, and consequently\nno corporeal substance, insofar as it is a substance, is\ndivisible.” In 1P14, he establishes that there is only one\nsubstance (or rather, that there are no created substances). Finally in\n1P15 he claims: “Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be\nconceived without God.” With this, the stage is set for Extension\nbeing a divine attribute or applicable to God, if in fact it is a\ngenuine attribute (which is established only in Part Two). \n\nSpinoza is aware that this will be received with great resistance.\nThe possible objection he imagines is that since Extension is divisible\nby its very nature then, if Extension were an attribute of God, God\nwould be divisible. God, of course, cannot be divisible, for then he\nwould not be infinite. In the Scholium to 1P15 he shows the ensuing\ncontradictions if one holds Extension to be by its very nature\ndivisible. It is important for him to show that Extension cannot imply\ndivisibility in answer to possible objectors holding traditional\nviews. Moreover, he has just shown that there is only one\nsubstance, which is indivisible (1P12 and 1P13), and so whatever\nattributes it has, none of them can imply divisibility in the only\nsubstance. Spinoza then shows that if Extension is an attribute, it is\napplicable to God, and there is no danger of that implying any real\ndivision in the substance. One important result of this is that what\nappear to be individuated bodies cannot be really individuated in the\nCartesian sense of implying real distinction and the existence of\nmultiple substances. Rather, what appear to be individuated bodies are\nonly modes of substance under the attribute of\n Extension.[10]\n Only in\nPart Two does Spinoza show that Extension (as well as Thought) are in\nfact attributes of God: “Thought is an attribute of God,\nor [sive] God is a thinking thing” (2P1) and\n“Extension is an attribute of God, or [sive]\nGod is an extended thing” (2P2). \n\nA very important characteristic regarding attributes is established\nin 2P7 and its scholium, which is sometimes referred to in the\nliterature as the “parallelism doctrine.” However, as will\nbe discussed in\n Section 1.9.2,\nthis\nnomenclature is laden with a significant amount of interpretative bias\nand the term is nowhere to be found in the Ethics itself. It\nis thus advisable to stay clear of it and simply refer to it\nas “the 2P7 Doctrine.” 2P7 states: “The order and\nconnection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of\nthings,” (“ordo, & connexio idearum idem est, ac\nordo & connexio rerum”). Spinoza explains this\nproposition in the scholium: \n\nSpinoza is claiming here that a mode X under the attribute of\nThought is one and the same as mode X under\nAttributey. A good way to get some intuitive sense\nof this is to see how this works with respect to ourselves. Under the\nattribute of Thought, I am a finite mode—an idea or mind. Under\nthe attribute of Extension, I am a finite mode, that is, a body. The\nclaim in 2P7 and its scholium is that my mind (a mode of Thought) and\nmy body (a mode of Extension) are one and the same. This is the case\nfor all modes. Furthermore, whatever causal relation my body, say,\nbears to other modes of Extension, my mind will bear to the other\nmodes of Thought. The understanding of this doctrine and its\nimplications in more depth depends, probably more than any other\ndoctrine, on how one construes other central elements of Spinoza’s\ntheory of attributes (e.g. the number of attributes).  In Section\n1.9.2 different directions of interpretation are considered regarding\n2P7 and its scholium. \n\nSpinoza famously claims that we, human minds, only know two\nattributes—Thought and Extension. This can be seen as arising\nfrom the axioms in Part Two: 2A2: “Man thinks,” 2A4:\n“We feel a certain body is affected in many ways,” 2A5:\n“We neither feel nor perceive any singular things, except bodies\nand modes of thinking,” as well as 2P13: “The object of the\nidea constituting the human mind is the body, or [sive] a\ncertain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing\nelse” [italics added] (this is true already in KV, 1/27). In\nLetter 64 Spinoza tries to explain why we can only perceive these two\nattributes, and he does so by referring back to 2P13 and claims in the\nletter: “Therefore, the mind’s power of understanding\nextends only as far as that which this idea of the body contains within\nitself, or which follows therefrom. Now this idea of the body involves\nand expresses no other attributes of God than extension and\nthought.” Although some have found this line of argumentation\nunsatisfying (e.g. Bennett, 1984, 78–79) it is worth noting that\nSpinoza here is relying on axioms. \n\nThe attempt to understand Spinoza’s doctrine regarding the attributes\nhas traditionally led interpreters in two main directions, although\nothers have been proposed (e.g. Lennon, 2005. 12–30; Shein,\n 2009).[11]\n The first is what is known as the “subjective”\ninterpretation which follows Hegel, and is given its paradigmatic\nexpression by Wolfson. More recently, Michael Della Rocca as been\nadvocating a more idealistic interpretation of the attributes, which\nshares certain important features with the subjectivist camp. The\nother, which has become the standard, is the “objective”\ninterpretation. These two principal avenues stem from some important\nambiguities in the definition of “attribute”: “By\nattribute I understand what the intellect perceives of substance as\nconstituting its essence”\n (1D4).[12] \nThe first term that is ambiguous is\n“intellect,” since it can refer either to the finite\nintellect or the infinite one (cf. diagram in Section 1).  The second\nimportant ambiguity lies in the Latin term tanquam, since it\ncan mean either “as if, but not in fact,” or “as in\nfact.” The definition can therefore be read, either as stating\nthat attributes are what the intellect perceives of substance as\nconstituting its actual essence, or that attributes are what the\nintellect perceives only as if they are what constitute the\nessence but are not what in fact constitutes it or them. The\nsubjectivists accordingly claim that attributes are what the finite\nintellect perceives of substance as if constituting its\nessence. The objectivists, by and large, instead claim that it is the\ninfinite intellect that perceives the attribute as in fact\nconstituting the essence of substance. In the following sections the\ndifferent interpretative options are explained a grosso\nmodo. The ways in which the different interpretative avenues\naffect other Spinozistic doctrines are discussed in Sections\n1.9.1–1.9.4. \n\nAs is well known, Hegel, in various respects, considered himself to\nbe modifying Spinoza’s doctrine (“to be a follower of\nSpinoza is the essential commencement of all philosophy”) and his\ninterpretation of Spinoza was extremely\n influential.[13]\n In his Lectures on\nthe History of Philosophy, Hegel says that what has utmost reality\nfor Spinoza is the absolute (or the infinite substance) and that\nanything else (finite modes, in particular) are ways of negating this\nabsolute. He goes on to explain that the understanding [or\n“intellect”] grasps the reality of substance through\nattributes, but “it is only reality in view of the\nunderstanding.” He stresses that understanding in terms of\nattributes is due to the nature of the understanding and not because of\nthe nature of the absolute (or the infinite substance) as such. It is\nclear that he considers the understanding to be the understanding of\nfinite minds, because he goes on to explain that Spinoza’s claim\nthat there are “infinite attributes” has to be interpreted\nas “infinite in character” and not in number and that there\nare only the two attributes known to finite minds—Thought and\nExtension. \n\nWhat is referred to in the literature as the subjectivist reading,\nfollowing Hegel, holds that the intellect perceiving the attributes is\nthe finite intellect and that the attributes are projections of the\nfinite mind onto the infinite substance which it cannot fully\ncomprehend. In other words, according to the subjectivist\ninterpretation, the definition of attribute states that attributes are\nwhat the finite intellect perceives of substance as if (but not in\nfact) constituting its essence. In contrast, the objectivist\nreading takes the intellect in question to be the infinite one, and the\ntanquam to mean “as in fact,” and so it read the\ndefinition as claiming that attributes are what the infinite intellect\nperceives of substance as (in fact) constituting its essence.\nWolfson summarizes the difference between the two positions thus: \n\nOne of the motivations behind Wolfson’s view is that he\nconsiders Spinoza to be the last of the medieval Jewish rationalists,\nand in following with that tradition, Spinoza locates all multiplicity\nnot in the infinite substance (God), but rather in the human mind. That\nis, the fact that God has multiple attributes is explained not by his\nhaving multiple essences, natures, or aspects, but rather because of\nthe nature of the human mind. This is based on the conviction that\nGod’s true nature is simple and any multiplicity is merely\napparent but not real. It is because of the limitations of the finite\nmind that it attributes multiplicity to the infinite substance, when in\nreality the infinite substance is simple. In this view there is a gap\nbetween the attributes and the infinite substance. The infinite\nsubstance as it is in itself, so to speak, is unknowable to the finite\nmind. With respect to the “real distinction,” the\ndistinction between the attributes in this view is grounded in the\ndifferent ways the finite mind has of conceiving the infinite\nsubstance. That is, the distinction between the attributes is not based\non the nature of the infinite substance itself, but it reveals, in a\nway, something about the nature of finite perception. It is in these\nterms that the “reality” of the distinction is to be\nunderstood, i.e., as if but not in fact. \n\nTwo main objections have been brought forth against the subjectivist\ninterpretation. These are considered by most commentators to be\nforceful enough for rejecting subjectivism as a serious contender for\na satisfying interpretation of Spinoza’s theory of attributes. The\nfirst objection to subjectivism is that, finite minds can never have\ntrue knowledge of God, but only knowledge “as if.” All\nknowledge is rendered illusory. The reason for this is quite clear. In\nthe subjectivist interpretation the attributes are projections of the\nfinite mind, therefore the finite mind can never come to know the\ninfinite substance as it is in itself. This seems to contradict\nSpinoza’s claim that the finite mind can have adequate, that is,\nperfect knowledge of God’s essence (2P47). The second objection is\nthat this interpretation seems irreconcilable with those places in the\ntext where Spinoza identifies the attributes and God (cf. 1P4, 1P19\nand 1P20Cor.). Again, as projections of the finite intellect, the\nattributes do not properly pertain to the substance, and therefore\ncannot be identical to it. For these reasons, among others, the\nsubjective interpretation (understood in these terms) has fallen out\nof favor.[14]\nMichael Della Rocca, however, has been advocating more recently that\nattributes (and diversity more generally), are mind-dependent yet not\nillusory. Thus he aims to overcome some of the traditional objections\nto subjectivism (primarily “illusory knowledge” objections)\nwhile insisting on the mind-dependent status of attributes. He takes\nthe mind-dependant nature of diversity (be it of attribute or modes)\nto be an inevitable consequence of Spinoza’s adoption of the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason (cf. Della Rocca, 2012). \n\nIn light of these kinds of criticisms to the subjectivist\ninterpretation, commentators have turned towards what are known as\n“objectivist” accounts. Although the details of these\naccounts are quite diverse, there are a few key elements they\nshare—all related to the fact that they do not wish to be\nsubjectivist. The first of these characteristics is that they hold that\nknowledge in the system cannot be illusory. That is, knowledge through\nattributes must yield true, or adequate, knowledge. One way to do this\nis to claim that it is the infinite intellect that perceives the\nattributes, and so knowledge through attributes is the kind of\nknowledge the infinite intellect has, and therefore is not illusory\n(e.g. Bennett, 1984, 147; Delahunty, 1985, 116; Della Rocca 1996, 157;\nHaserot, 1972, 32–35). Therefore, the tanquam in the\ndefinition is to be read “as in fact” and not “as\nif.” \n\nAs opposed to subjectivism, which does not emphasize the\n“reality” of the distinction between the attributes, or\nrather, does not ground the distinction in the nature of the infinite\nsubstance, objectivist interpretations place ontological weight on the\n“real distinction” between the attributes. In other words,\nfor the multiplicity to have a certain reality and not be illusory, it\nmust somehow be grounded not in the perceiver but in the thing\nperceived, namely, the infinite substance. The danger of this kind of\ninterpretation is that if the distinction is stressed too strongly, the\nunity of the substance is lost. If the infinite substance has\n“really distinct” attributes, and this distinction is\ngrounded in, say, distinct natures or essences of the infinite\nsubstance, then there has to be an explanation of how a multiplicity of\nnatures or essences can be united to form one substance. (This issue is\naddressed in further detail in\n Section 1.9.4\nas it emerges in the discussion of the nature of the union of\nmind and body). \n\nAny interpretation of Spinoza must characterize the relation between\nany given attribute and the substance. As mentioned, in the\nsubjectivist account there is a problematic gap between the substance\nand any given attribute. The alternative is to deny this gap. For\nexample, Bennett claims the following: \n\nAlthough Bennett claims there is an emptiness about the distinction\nbetween the two, he does not consider it an absolute identity either.\nHe finds an identity claim to be irreconcilable with the claim that\nattributes are really distinct. Della Rocca has suggested\nintentionality as a way of denying the gap and treats “…\nis extended” and “… is thinking” as\nreferentially opaque. In other words, what is being picked out by the\ninfinite intellect in either instance is the same, but the way in which\nit is picked out is different. Yet another way of denying the gap is to\nclaim, along with Descartes, that the distinction between an attribute\nand the substance is only a rational distinction. That is, in\nreality there is no distinction, but in the finite mind we can\nseparate, contra natura, the attribute from the substance. Or\nin other words, the finite mind can abstract the attribute from the\nsubstance, but in reality they are not separated. This type of\nview must be supplemented by an account, then, of what is meant by the\n“real distinction” among the attributes. \n\nAlthough Spinoza claims that there are infinite attributes, a\nquestion arises as to how many there are, because\n“infinity” may not necessarily refer to numeric\n infinity.[15]\n Bennett, among others, has made the case that infinity in early modern\nphilosophy means totality (Bennett, 1984, 75–79). Spinoza’s\nclaims, then, that the infinite substance has infinite attributes can\nbe understood as the claim that the infinite substance has all the\nattributes there are to be\n had.[16]\n This is consistent with\nthere being, say, only the two known attributes. There are sections in\nthe text, on the other hand, that seem to suggest that infinity means a\nnumerical infinity, and thus the infinite substance has as attributes\nThought and Extension, as well as infinitely many other unknown\nattributes. The places used as evidence for those wishing to claim\nthere are more than two attributes are the following: \n\n1D6: By God I understand a being absolutely infinite, that is, a\nsubstance consisting of an infinity of attributes, of which each one\nexpresses an eternal and infinite essence. \n\nExp.: I say absolutely infinite, not infinite in its own kind; for\nif something is only infinite in its own kind, we can deny infinite\nattributes of it; but if something is absolutely infinite, whatever\nexpresses essence and involves no negation pertains to its\nessence. \n\n2P7Schol: Therefore whether we conceive Nature under the attribute\nof Extension, or the attribute of Thought, or any other attribute, we\nshall find one and the same order, or one and the same connection of\ncauses, that is the same things follow one another. \n\nLetter 56: To your [Hugo Boxel] question as to whether I have as\nclear an idea of God as of a triangle, I reply in the affirmative. But\nif you ask me whether I have as clear a mental image of God as of a\ntriangle, I reply in the negative. We cannot imagine God, but we can\napprehend him by the intellect. Here it should also be observed that I\ndo not claim to have complete knowledge of God, but that I do\nunderstand some of his attributes—not indeed all of them, or the\ngreater part—and it is certain that my ignorance of very many\nattributes does not prevent me from having knowledge of some of them.\nWhen I was studying Euclid’s Elements, I understood\nearly on that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right\nangles, and I clearly perceived this property of a triangle although I\nwas ignorant of many others. \n\nThis issue can be linked to the previous discussion regarding the\nambiguities in the definition of attribute, although this is not always\ndone. If one holds that it is the infinite intellect that is doing the\nrelevant perceiving, there seems to be no reason to limit the number of\nattributes it perceives. Conversely, it might be claimed that if the\ninfinite intellect perceives only two attributes, there must be a\nsufficient reason why there are only two, and why they are Thought and\nExtension and not other attributes. If, on the other hand, one holds\nthat it is the finite intellect that conceives the attributes, and it\nonly conceives Thought and Extension, then these are the only two\nattributes there are. In the literature, however, this line of\nreasoning is not always followed, and examples can be found of\ninterpreters who hold that it is the infinite intellect that does the\nperceiving, but that there need not be more than two attributes\n(Bennett, 1984, 75–76). At the same time, there are interpreters\nwho claim it is the finite intellect that perceives the attributes\nwhile there are infinitely many attributes (Wolfson, 1934, 226). How\nmany attributes there are affects how one reads another central\ndoctrine in Spinoza’s metaphysics, such as 2P7 and 2P7Schol, to\nwhich we turn next. \n\nA crucial role in Spinoza’s system is played by 2P7 and its\nscholium, since they lay the ground for solving, or rather dissolving,\nthe mind–body problem. Therefore, the understanding of the nature\nof the union of mind and body depends on one’s interpretation of\nSpinoza’s theory of attributes and 2P7 and its scholium in\nparticular. (For a discussion of the issues regarding the union of Mind\nand Body, see\n Section 1.9.4).\nThe\ninterpretation of the metaphysical structure of what is expressed in\n2P7 and its scholium is affected greatly by the number of attributes\none believes there are in Spinoza’s system and how one\nunderstands the relation between the attributes and the substance. The\ngeneral description of 2P7 and its scholium is discussed above in\n Section 1.6. \n\n2P7 and its scholium can be understood in very different ways. In\nwhat follows three types of interpretive directions are described. This\nis not meant to be exhaustive by any means, but it will provide a sense\nof the kinds of options that have been offered by commentators. Let us\nbegin with the simplest option first. If one holds that there are only\ntwo attributes, Thought and Extension, the metaphysical structure of\n2P7 and its scholium is quite straightforward. Every mode under the\nattribute of Thought is associated with a mode in Extension, and\nvice versa and the relations between modes in one attribute\nare mirrored in the other. Those that hold this kind of view must, of\ncourse, provide a convincing argument to the effect that there are only\ntwo attributes. \n\nHowever, if one takes there to be more than two attributes, the\nstructure gets quite a bit more complex. One option that has been\nadvanced is that Thought is a special attribute and encompasses ideas\nof all the modes in all the other attributes (Cf. for example Curley,\n1969, 146; and more recently, Melamed, 2009, Chapters 1–2).\nThought turns out to be “special” in this kind of\ninterpretation because there are many more modes (ideas) or facets of modes in Thought\nthan there are under any other attribute. Another way of expressing\nthis is by saying that 2P7 is not a biconditional. The requirement of\nan associated mode goes only in one direction from any mode in any\nattribute to a mode in Thought. The burden on this type of view is that\nit must account for the favoring of Thought over the other attributes,\nand perhaps also for the relation between all the non-Thought modes in\nthe other attributes. \n\nAnother option (or class of options) that is available is to claim\nthat attributes come in pairs: an object-like attribute coupled with a\nthought-like attribute (Curley entertains this option as well; Curley,\n1969, 146). Under this type of interpretation we would get Thought and\nExtension following the structure of the first alternative, that is,\neach idea in Thought is associated with (one and the same) a mode in\nExtension. Taking there to be more than just two attributes, we also\nget Thoughtx coupled with Extensionx in which\neach ideax is one and the same as bodyx under\nExtensionx, and Thoughty coupled with\nExtensiony, and so on. Letter 66 provides some support for\nthis view. This kind of account has to be supplemented, of course, with\nan account of the relations among these Thought-like / Extension-like\npairs of attributes. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, Spinoza identifies God, or the infinite\nsubstance with the attributes (1P4, 1P19 and 1P20Cor.). The nature of\nthis identification is also affected by one’s interpretative\nstance regarding the attributes. The traditional subjectivist view,\nsince it claims that the attributes are a projection of the finite mind\nonto the substance, cannot hold this identification to be strict.\nObjectivist views, which stress the distinctness of attributes, also\ncannot accept these claims literally (E.g., Bennett, 1984, 64; Curley,\n1988, 13; Gueroult, 1968, 50). The reason for this is as follows: if\nthe substance is strictly identical to any one of its attributes, then\nattributes will be identical to each other (by transitivity), and\ntherefore no longer distinct, as Spinoza claims. Different objectivist\ninterpretations address this issue differently. Curley, for example,\nholds that the identity is not one that holds between any given\nattribute and the substance, but rather between the totality of the\nattributes and the substance (Curley, 1988, 30). Bennett, on the other\nhand, believes Spinoza is simply overstating the case (Bennett, 1984,\n64). \n\nThis identity can be understood strictly if the distinction between\nthe attributes and the substance is taken to be only rationally\ndistinct, that is identical in reality, and at the same time\ntaking the distinction between attributes to be only epistemological\nand not ontological. \n\nAnother doctrine that is heavily affected by how one understands the\nattributes is the union of mind and body. For Descartes, the issue was\nhow to unite two really distinct created substances—uniting minds\nwith bodies. Descartes’ reply is that God unites these two\nsubstances, and we have tools by which to recognize that we are united\nin this way, i.e., sensory experience (Meditation Six).\nSpinoza, of course, cannot allude to God as creator to unite minds and\nbodies, since what is being united are not created substances\nbut finite modes. The possible problem can be\narticulated as follows: How can Spinoza claim, on the one hand, that\nthere are modes of really distinct attributes, e.g., my mind and my\nbody, and therefore there is a real distinction between my mind and my\nbody, and, on the other, claim in the Scholium to 2P7 that my mind and\nbody are one and the same? \n\nThis problem which arises for the objectivist interpretations has been\naddressed in a variety of ways. It is worth noting that this problem\ndoes not arise for subjectivist views. This possible tension in\nSpinoza does not present itself for the subjectivists, since they do\nnot claim that the “real distinction” between the\nattributes has ontological weight. That is, there are no two things\nthat have to be united. Commentators wishing to stress the\n“distinctness” of the attributes find themselves having to\nexplain the sense in which Spinoza can mean that the mind and the body\nare “one and the same.” A common strategy among\ncommentators has been to appeal to a structure that is\nattribute-neutral in order to account for the unity. To better\nunderstand this issue it is useful to consider a few examples. \n\nOne important example is Bennett, who claims that the unity is to be\nunderstood as a unity of properties, but not of the modes\nthemselves: \n\nThat is, Bennett thinks that there is some trans-attribute feature\n(what he calls “differentia F”) such that it can\nbe added to Extension to get extended-F, and added it to\nThought to get thinking-F. Bennett admits that nothing like\nthis is found anywhere in the text, but he believes that this way we\ncan make sense of Spinoza’s holding that the attributes are\n“really distinct” from each other and, at the same time,\nthat thinking-F and extended-F are one and the\nsame. \n\nDella Rocca, while holding a view different from that of Bennett\nregarding Spinoza’s theory of attributes, also finds himself\nhaving to account in some way for the unity of mind and body, and so he\nsuggests that modes are said to be numerically identical when they\nshare all of their neutral properties, where “neutral\nproperties” are those properties which do not involve being\nthought under any particular attributes. This is contrasted with\n“intentional properties” which are attribute-dependent such\nas “being of a certain volume.” As an example of a neutral\nproperty, Della Rocca offers “having five immediate\neffects.” He then claims that if modes share all of their neutral\nproperties, they are identical (that is, one and the same). Therefore,\nsince my mind and my body share all of their neutral properties, they\nare identical (Della Rocca, 1996, 133–38). \n\nThe final example that shall be considered is Gueroult’s\ninterpretation. Gueroult, in order to account for the professed\nidentity between modes of different attributes in 2P7 and its scholium,\nconsiders 1P28 which states: \n\nTo explain this proposition, Gueroult draws a distinction between\n“modes of substance” and “modes of attributes.”\nThe claim is that 1P28 treats only modes of substance and not\nattributes, and is therefore unique. In other words, the identity is\nthen understood in reference to “modes of substance” and\nnot “modes of attributes” (Gueroult, 1968, 338–39).\nAgain, we see an attribute-independent structure—the chain of\nmodes of substance—that is meant to account for the “one\nand the sameness” of modes of different attributes. \n\nIt has been pointed out, however, that this type of solution is not\nwithout serious problems (Shein, 2009). Briefly, the issue is as\nfollows: The main reason for rejecting the subjectivist view is that in\nthat type of interpretation, God, as he is in himself, remains\nunknowable, and this conflicts with Spinoza’s view that adequate\nknowledge is possible. However, as Spinoza makes clear in 1P10Schol,\nnature must be conceived under attributes. In light of this, an\nattribute-independent structure, by its very nature as\n“attribute-independent,” is unknowable as well. Therefore,\nin this view, knowledge of the union or the nature of the identity\nbetween mind and body, is in principle unknowable, and, in that\nrespect, does not provide any advantage over subjectivist views. \n\nAn alternative mentioned above that has been suggested is to deny\nthe gap between the attributes and the substance by claiming that,\nalong with Descartes, Spinoza holds there to be a rational distinction\nbetween them, that is, in reality they are identical (Shein,\n2009). This avoids the kind of problems that are raised for the\nsubjectivist view, since, in this interpretation to know the attributes\nis to know the substance. Since in this view the attributes are only\nrationally distinct from the substance, the “real\ndistinction” between the attributes, that Spinoza states in\n1P10Schol, is understood as being only an epistemological claim, as he\nstates in the text—“i.e., one may be conceived without the\nother” (1P10Schol). That is, it does not carry additional\nontological weight as the objectivists hold. This avoids having to\nimpose onto the Spinozistic system an attribute-independent structure\nto account for the unity which does not seem to fit with his\nepistemology. \n\nIn the Short Treatise Spinoza develops ideas that will come\nto a full articulation later on in the Ethics, such as the\nidea that, strictly speaking, there are only two attributes through\nwhich we can properly come to have knowledge of God—Thought and\nExtension. However, unlike in the Ethics, he does not simply\ndismiss the more traditional attributes such as omnipotence,\neternality, immutability, and infinity. To maintain some sense of these\ntraditional divine attributes, Spinoza explains that they are not\nattributes strictly speaking, but rather propria of God. This\nis stated first clearly in the first footnote to Chapter III\n(“How God is the Cause of All Things”): \n\nSpinoza then, is distinguishing between that which gives us\nknowledge of God, or better yet, through which God can be\nknown—Thought and Extension—and things that can be said of\nGod, that is, adjectival, but give us no knowledge—what he terms\npropria. This is explained most explicitly in Chapter VII of\nthe Short Treatise. The difference Spinoza wishes to draw\nbetween these is that although these traditional divine attributes can\nbe said of God, they do not teach us anything about what God is really\nlike. An analysis of these traditional attributes (propria)\nshows them either to be said of God when considering all of the\nattributes or to be only modes of attributes. For example, Spinoza\nclaims that when statements such as that “God is one,”\n“eternal” and “immutable” are said of God, they\nare said “in consideration of all his attributes.” On the\nother hand, something like “omniscience” is only a mode of\nan attribute, since it is only said of God when he is conceived\nthrough, or considered under, the attribute of Thought. That is, only\nwhen God is thought of as a thinking thing, can he be said to be\nomniscient. Similarly, when God is said to be\n“omnipresent,” it is only when he is conceived of through\nExtension. In the Ethics though, Spinoza does away with the\ntalk of propria and does not accord them really any status as\nsuch. \n\nWith the collapse of the divide between created substances and the\ninfinite substance, attributes play a new role for Spinoza; traditional\ndivine attributes are eliminated while attributes traditionally\nassociated with created substances (Extension in particular) are\nattributed to the infinite substance. Furthermore, with the elimination\nof this divide and the establishment of the infinite substance as the\nonly substance, Spinoza hopes that attributes account for variety in\nthe substance without jeopardizing its unity. All interpreters and\nreaders of Spinoza are forced to wrestle with making sense of this\ndouble role since it sits at the very core of his metaphysics. It is\nvital to realize that this endeavor is necessarily and beautifully\nlinked to other fundamental aspects of Spinoza’s metaphysics such\nas the “real distinction” between the attributes, the\nproclaimed identity of the substance and its attributes, the nature of\nthe conceiving intellect in the definition of ‘attribute’,\nthe nature of this intellect’s conceptions (illusory or not), the\nnumber of attributes, the structure of 2P7 and its scholium, and\nfinally the nature of the union of mind and body. These\ninter-connections are a reflection of the fully systematic nature of\nSpinoza’s metaphysics.","contact.mail":"sheinn@bgu.ac.il","contact.domain":"bgu.ac.il"}]
