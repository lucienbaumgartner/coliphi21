It could contain a link to “moral\nrealism” and stipulate the negation of the view described there.\nAlternatively, it could have links to the entries\n“anti-realism” and “morality” and could\nstipulate the conjunction of the materials contained therein. The fact\nthat neither of these approaches would be adequate—and, more\nstrikingly, that following the two procedures would yield\nsubstantively non-equivalent results—reveals the contentious and\nunsettled nature of the topic.\n\n\n“Anti-realism,” “non-realism,” and\n“irrealism” may for most purposes be treated as\nsynonymous. Occasionally, distinctions have been suggested for local\npedagogic reasons (see, e.g., Wright 1988; Dreier 2004), but no such\ndistinction has generally taken hold. (“Quasi-realism”\ndenotes something very different, to be described below.) All three\nterms are to be defined in opposition to realism, but since there is\nno consensus on how “realism” is to be understood,\n“anti-realism” fares no better. Crispin Wright (1992: 1)\ncomments that “if there ever was a consensus of understanding\nabout ‘realism’, as a philosophical term of art, it has\nundoubtedly been fragmented by the pressures exerted by the various\ndebates—so much so that a philosopher who asserts that she is a\nrealist about theoretical science, for example, or ethics, has\nprobably, for most philosophical audiences, accomplished little more\nthan to clear her throat.” This entry doesn’t purport to\ndo justice to the intricacy and subtlety of the topic of realism; it\nshould be acknowledged at the outset that the fragmentation of which\nWright speaks renders it unlikely that the label “moral\nanti-realism” even succeeds in picking out a definite position.\nYet perhaps we can at least make an advance on clearing our\nthroats.\n\nTraditionally, to hold a realist position with respect to X is to hold\nthat X exists objectively. On this view, moral anti-realism is the\ndenial of the thesis that moral properties—or facts, objects,\nrelations, events, etc. (whatever categories one is willing to\ncountenance)—exist objectively. This could involve either (1)\nthe denial that moral properties exist at all, or (2) the acceptance\nthat they do exist but this existence is (in the relevant sense)\nnon-objective. There are broadly two ways of endorsing (1): moral\nnoncognitivism and moral error theory. Proponents of (2) may be\nvariously thought of as moral non-objectivists, or idealists, or\nconstructivists. So understood, moral anti-realism is the disjunction\nof three theses: \nUsing such labels is not a precise science, nor an uncontroversial\nmatter; here they are employed just to situate ourselves roughly. In\nthis spirit of preliminary imprecision, these views can be initially\ncharacterized as follows: \nMoral noncognitivism holds that our moral judgments\nare not in the business of aiming at truth. So, for example, A.J. Ayer\ndeclared that when we say “Stealing money is wrong” we do\nnot express a proposition that can be true or false, but rather it is\nas if we say “Stealing money!!” with the tone of\nvoice indicating that a special feeling of disapproval is being\nexpressed (Ayer [1936] 1971: 110). Note how the predicate\n“… is wrong” has disappeared in Ayer’s\ntranslation schema; thus the issues of whether the property of\nwrongness exists, and whether that existence is objective, also\ndisappear. \nThe moral error theorist thinks that although our\nmoral judgments aim at the truth, they systematically fail to secure\nit: the world simply doesn’t contain the relevant\n“stuff” to render our moral judgments true. For a more\nfamiliar analogy, compare what an atheist usually claims about\nreligious judgments. On the face of it, religious discourse is\ncognitivist in nature: it would seem that when someone says “God\nexists” or “God loves you” they are usually\nasserting something that purports to be true. However, according to\nthe atheist, the world isn’t furnished with the right kind of\nstuff (gods, afterlife, miracles, etc.) necessary to render these\nassertions true. The moral error theorist claims that when we say\n“Stealing is morally wrong” we are asserting that the act\nof stealing instantiates the property of moral wrongness, but in fact\nthere is no such property, or at least nothing in the world\ninstantiates it, and thus the utterance is untrue. \nNon-objectivism (as it will be called here) allows\nthat moral facts exist but holds that they are non-objective. The\nslogan version comes from Hamlet: “there is nothing either good\nor bad, but thinking makes it so.” For a quick example of a\nnon-objective fact, consider the different properties that a\nparticular diamond might have. It is true that the diamond is made of\ncarbon, and also true that the diamond is worth $1000, say. But the\nstatus of these facts seems different. That the diamond is carbon\nseems an objective fact: it doesn’t depend on what we think of\nthe matter. (We could all be under the impression that it is not\ncarbon, and all be wrong.) That the diamond is worth $1000, by\ncontrast, seems to depend on us. If we all thought that it was worth\nmore (or less), then it would be worth more (or less). \n[This entry uses the label “non-objectivism” instead of\nthe simple “subjectivism” since there is an entrenched\nusage in metaethics for using the latter to denote the thesis that in\nmaking a moral judgment one is reporting (as opposed to expressing)\none’s own mental attitudes (e.g., “Stealing is morally\nwrong” means “I disapprove of stealing”). So\nunderstood, subjectivism is a kind of non-objectivist theory, but\nthere are many other kinds of non-objectivist theory, too.] It is\ntempting to construe this idea of non-objectivity as\n“mind-dependence,” though this, as we will see below, is a\ntricky notion, since something may be mind-independent in one sense\nand mind-dependent in another. Cars, for example, are designed and\nconstructed by creatures with minds, and yet in another sense cars are\nclearly concrete entities whose ongoing existence does not depend on\nour mental activity. Those who feel pessimistic that the notion of\nmind-dependence can be straightened out might prefer to characterize\nmoral realism in a way that makes no reference to objectivity. There\nis also the concern that the objectivity clause threatens to render\nmoral anti-realism trivially true, since there is little room for\ndoubting that the moral status of actions usually (if not always)\ndepends in some manner on mental phenomena, such as the\nintentions with which the action was performed or the episodes of\npleasure and pain that ensue from it. (See Sayre-McCord 1986; also his\nthe entry on  moral realism.)\n Whether such pessimism is warranted is not something to be decided\nhastily. Perhaps the judicious course is to make a terminological\ndistinction between minimal moral realism—which is the\ndenial of noncognitivism and error theory—and robust moral\nrealism—which in addition asserts the objectivity of moral\nfacts. (See Rosen 1994 for this distinction.) In what follows,\nhowever, “moral realism” will continue to be used to\ndenote the traditional robust version. \nIf moral anti-realism is understood in this manner, then there are\nseveral things with which it is important not to confuse it. \nFirst, moral anti-realism is not a form of moral\nskepticism. If we take moral skepticism to be the claim that\nthere is no such thing as moral knowledge, and we take knowledge to be\njustified true belief, then there are three ways of being a moral\nskeptic: one can deny that moral judgments are beliefs, one can\ndeny that moral judgments are ever true, or one can\ndeny that moral judgments are ever justified. The noncognitivist\nmakes the first of these denials, and the error theorist makes the\nsecond, thus noncognitivists and error theorists count as both moral\nanti-realists and moral skeptics. However, since the non-objectivity\nof some fact does not pose a particular problem regarding the\npossibility of one’s knowing it (I might know that a\ncertain diamond is worth $1000, for example), then there is nothing to\nstop the moral non-objectivist from accepting the existence of moral\nknowledge. So moral non-objectivism is a form of moral anti-realism\nthat need not be a form of moral skepticism. Conversely, one might\nmaintain that moral judgments are sometimes objectively\ntrue—thus being a moral realist—while also maintaining\nthat moral judgments always lack justification—thus being a\nmoral skeptic. (See entry for\n moral skepticism.) \nSpeaking more generally, moral anti-realism, as it has been defined\nhere, contains no epistemological clause: it is silent on the question\nof whether we are justified in making moral judgments. This is worth\nnoting since moral realists often want to support a view of morality\nthat would guarantee our justified access to a realm of objective\nmoral facts. But any such epistemic guarantee will need to be argued\nfor separately; it is not implied by realism itself. Indeed, if\nobjective facts are those that do not depend on our mental activity,\nthen they are precisely those facts that we can all be mistaken about,\nand thus it seems reasonable to suppose that the desire for moral\nfacts to be objective and the desire for a guarantee of epistemic\naccess to moral facts are desiderata that are in tension with each\nother. \nSecond, it is worth stating explicitly that moral anti-realism is not\na form of moral relativism—or, perhaps more\nusefully noted: that moral relativism is not a form of moral\nanti-realism. Moral relativism is a form of cognitivism according to\nwhich moral claims contain an indexical element, such that the truth\nof any such claim requires relativization to some individual or\ngroup. According to a simple form of relativism, the claim\n“Stealing is morally wrong” might be true when one person\nutters it, and false when someone else utters it. The important thing\nto note is that this would not necessarily make moral wrongness\nnon-objective. For example, suppose someone were to make the\nrelativistic claim that different moral values, virtues, and duties\napply to different groups of people due to, say, their social\ncaste. If this person were asked in virtue of what these relativistic\nmoral facts obtain, there is nothing to prevent them offering the\nfull-blooded realist answer: “It’s just the way the\nuniverse objectively is.” Relativism does not stand opposite\nobjectivism; it stands opposite absolutism (the form of cognitivism\naccording to which the truth of moral claims does not require\nrelativization to any individual or group). One can be both a moral\nrelativist and a moral objectivist (and thus a moral realist);\nconversely, one can be both a moral non-objectivist (and thus a moral\nanti-realist) and a moral absolutist. (See entries for \nrelativism and \nmoral relativism.) \nOf course, someone could simply stipulate that moral realism includes\nthe denial of moral relativism, and perhaps the philosophical\ncommunity could be persuaded to adopt this definition (in which case\nthis entry would need to be revised). But it seems reasonable to\nsuspect that the common tendency to think that moral realism and moral\nrelativism are opposed to each other is, more often than not, due a\nconfused conflation of the objectivism/non-objectivism distinction and\nthe absolutism/relativism distinction. \nThird and finally, it might be helpful to clarify the relationship\nbetween moral anti-realism and moral naturalism. The\nmoral naturalist believes that moral facts exist and fit within the\nworldview presented by science. (For example, a utilitarian view that\nidentifies moral obligation with the production of happiness will\ncount as a form of moral naturalism, since there is nothing\nparticularly scientifically mysterious about happiness.) A moral\nnaturalist may maintain that moral facts are objective in nature, in\nwhich case this moral naturalist will count as a moral realist. But a\nmoral naturalist may instead maintain that the moral facts are not\nobjective in nature, in which case this moral naturalist will count as\na moral anti-realist. Consider, for example, a simplistic\nnon-objectivist theory that identifies moral goodness (say) with\nwhatever a person approves of. Such a view would be a form of\nanti-realism (in virtue of its non-objectivism), but since the\nphenomenon of people approving of things is something that can be\naccommodated smoothly within a scientific framework, it would also be\na form of moral naturalism. Conversely, if a moral realist maintains\nthat the objective moral facts cannot be accommodated within the\nscientific worldview, then this moral realist will count as a moral\nnon-naturalist. (See entries for\n naturalism\n and\n moral naturalism.) \nThe noncognitivist and the error theorist, it should be noted, count\nas neither moral naturalists nor moral non-naturalists, since they do\nnot believe in moral facts at all. These kinds of moral anti-realist,\nhowever, may well be naturalists in a more general sense: they\nmay maintain that the only items that we should admit into our\nontology are those that fit within the scientific worldview. Indeed,\nit is quite likely that it is their commitment to this more general\nontological naturalism that lies behind the noncognitivist’s and\nthe error theorist’s moral skepticism, since they may deem that\nmoral properties (were they to exist) would have to have\ncharacteristics that cannot be accommodated within a naturalistic\nframework. \nSumming up: Some moral anti-realists will count as moral skeptics, but\nsome may believe in moral knowledge. Some moral anti-realists will be\nrelativists, but some may be moral absolutists (and many are neither).\nSome moral anti-realists will be moral naturalists, but some may be\nmoral non-naturalists, and some will be neither moral naturalists nor\nnon-naturalists. These various positions can be combined into a\npotentially bewildering array of possible complex metaethical\npositions (e.g., non-skeptical, relativistic, non-naturalistic moral\nanti-realism)—though, needless to say, these views may vary\ngreatly in plausibility. \nIt is widely assumed that moral realism enjoys some sort of\npresumption in its favor that the anti-realist has to work to\novercome. Jonathan Dancy writes that “we take moral value to be\npart of the fabric of the world; … and we should take it in the\nabsence of contrary considerations that actions and agents do have the\nsorts of moral properties we experience in them” (1986: 172). In\na similar vein, David McNaughton claims “The realist’s\ncontention is that he has only to rebut the arguments designed to\npersuade us that moral realism is philosophically untenable in order\nto have made out his case” (1988: 40–41). David Brink\nconcurs: “We begin as (tacit) cognitivists and realists about\nethics.… Moral Realism should be our metaethical starting\npoint, and we should give it up only if it does involve unacceptable\nmetaphysical and epistemological commitments” (1989:\n23–24). \nIt may be questioned, however, whether moral realism really does enjoy\nintuitive support, and also questioned whether, if it does, this\nshould burden the anti-realist with extra labor. \nOn the first matter, it may be argued that some of the distinctions\ndrawn in distinguishing moral realism from anti-realism are too\nfine-grained or abstruse for “the folk” to have any\ndeterminate opinion. It is, for example, radically unclear to what\nextent common sense embraces the objectivity of moral\nfacts. There have been some empirical investigations ostensibly\nexamining the extent to which ordinary people endorse moral\nobjectivism (e.g., Goodwin & Darley 2008; Uttich et al. 2014),\nbut, upon examination, many of these studies seem in fact to examine\nthe extent to which ordinary people endorse moral absolutism.\n(See Hopster 2019.) And if even professional researchers struggle to\ngrasp the concept of moral objectivity, it is difficult to maintain\nconfidently that “the folk” have a firm and determinate\nintuition on the subject. Furthermore, even if empirical investigation\nof collective opinion were to locate strong intuitions in favor of a\nmind-independent morality, there may be other equally robust\nintuitions in favor of morality being mind-dependent. (For\nexample, the fact that we seem unwilling to defer to experts when\nforming moral views appears to count against realism; see McGrath\n2011. Similarly, the fact that we do not expect a person necessarily\nto accept others’ reasons for their moral views seems to\nreveal anti-realist tendencies; see Foot 1958 for discussion.) Given\nthe difficulties in deciding and articulating just what kind of\nobjectivity is relevant to the moral realism/anti-realism division,\nand given the range and potential subtlety of options, it might be\nthought rash to claim that common sense has a firm opinion one way or\nthe other on this subject. \nOn the second matter: even if we were to identify a widespread\nunivocal intuition in favor of moral realism, it remains unclear to\nwhat extent we should adopt a methodology that rewards moral realism\nwith a dialectical advantage when it comes to metaethics. By\ncomparison, we do not think that physicists should endeavor to come up\nwith intuitive theories. (There is, for example, a widespread\nerroneous intuition that a fast-moving ball exiting a curved tube will\ncontinue to travel on a curving trajectory (McCloskey et al. 1980).\nThe fact that Newtonian physics predicts that the ball will in fact\ncontinue on a straight trajectory is surely in no sense a mark against\nthe theory.) Moreover, it is important to distinguish between any such\npro-realist intuitions ex ante and ex post. Once\nsomeone has accepted considerations and arguments in favor of moral\nanti-realism, then any counter-intuitiveness that this conclusion\nhas—ex ante—may be considered irrelevant. One noteworthy\ntype of strategy here is the “debunking argument,” which\nseeks to undermine moral intuitions by showing that they are the\nproduct of processes that we have no grounds for thinking\nare reliable indicators of truth. (See Street 2006; O’Neill\n2015; Joyce 2013, 2016.) To the extent that the anti-realist can\nprovide a plausible explanation for why humans would tend to think of\nmorality as objective, even if is not objective, then any\ncounter-intuitiveness in the anti-realist’s failure to\naccommodate objectivity can no longer be raised as an ongoing\nconsideration against moral anti-realism. \nA theory’s clashing with common sense is not the only way in\nwhich it can face a burden of proof. Of two theories, A and B, if A\nexplains a range of observable phenomena more readily than B, then\nproponents of B will have to undertake extra labor of squaring their\ntheory with the available evidence—and this may be the case even\nif B strikes people as the more intuitive theory. For example, perhaps\nNewtonian physics is more intuitive than Einsteinian, but there is\nobservable data—e.g., the results of the famous solar eclipse\nexperiments of 1919—that the latter theory is much better\nequipped to explain. \nWhat is it, then, that metaethical theories are expected to explain?\nThe range of phenomena is ill-defined and open-ended, but is typically\ntaken to include such things as the manifest features of moral\nlanguage, the importance of morality in our lives, moral practices and\ninstitutions, the way moral considerations engage motivation, the\ncharacter of moral disagreement, and the acquisition of moral\nattitudes. \nConsider the first of these explananda: moral language. Here it seems\nreasonable to claim that the noncognitivist shoulders a burden of\nproof. Moral predicates appear to function linguistically like any\nother predicate: Just as the sentence “The cat is brown”\nmay be used as an antecedent of a conditional, as a premise of an\nargument, as the basis of a question (“Is the cat\nbrown?”), have its predicate nominalized (“Brownness is\nhad by the cat”), be embedded in a propositional attitude claim\n(“Mary believes that the cat is brown”), and have the\ntruth predicate applied to it (“‘The cat is brown’\nis true”)—so too can all these things be done, without\nobvious incoherence, with a moral sentence like “Stealing is\nmorally wrong.” This is entirely as the cognitivist would\npredict. By contrast, for a noncognitivist who maintains (as Ayer did)\nthat this moral judgment amounts to nothing more than\n“Stealing!” uttered in a special disapproval-expressing\ntone, all of this linguistic evidence represents a major (and perhaps\ninsurmountable) challenge. \nOther explananda, on the other hand, may reveal that it is the moral\nrealist who has the extra explaining to do. If moral properties are\ntaken to have an essential normativity—in terms of, say, placing\npractical demands upon us—then the realist faces the challenge\nof explaining how any such thing could exist objectively. The\nmoral non-objectivist, by contrast, sees moral normativity as\nsomething that we create—that practical demands arise from our\ndesires, emotions, values, judgments, practices, or institutions. Thus\nthe task of providing a moral ontology that accommodates normativity\nseems a much easier one for the non-objectivist than for the moral\nrealist. (The noncognitivist and the error theorist would seem to have\nan even easier time, since for them there is no moral ontology at\nall.) \nThere remains a great deal of dispute concerning what the phenomena\nare that a metaethical theory should be expected to explain; and even\nwhen some such phenomenon is roughly agreed upon, there is often\nsignificant disagreement over its exact nature. For example, pretty\nmuch everyone agrees that any decent metaethical theory should be able\nto explain the close connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation—but it is a live question whether that connection\nshould be construed as a necessary one, or whether a reliably\ncontingent connection will suffice. (See Svavardóttir 2006;\nRosati 2021.) Even when such disputes can be settled, there remains\nplenty of room for arguing over the importance of the explanandum in\nquestion (relative to other explananda), and for arguing whether a\ngiven theory does indeed adequately explain the phenomenon. \nIn short, attempts to establish the burden of proof are as slippery\nand indecisive in the debate between the moral realist and the moral\nanti-realist as they tend to be generally in philosophy. The matter is\ncomplicated by the fact that there are two kinds of burden-of-proof\ncase that can be pressed, and here they tend to pull against each\nother. On the one hand, it is widely assumed that common sense favors\nthe moral realist. On the other hand, moral realists face a cluster of\nexplanatory challenges concerning the nature of moral facts (how they\nrelate to non-moral facts, how we have access to them, why they have\npractical importance)—challenges that seem much more tractable\nfor the moral non-objectivist and often simply don’t arise for\neither the noncognitivist or the error theorist. This tension between\nwhat is considered to be the intuitive position and what is\nconsidered to be the empirically, metaphysically, and\nepistemologically defensible position, motivates and animates\nmuch of the debate between the moral realist and moral\nanti-realist. \nGiven that moral anti-realism is a disjunction of three views, then\nany argument for any of those views is an argument for moral\nanti-realism. By the same token, any argument against any of the three\nviews can contribute to an argument for moral realism, and if one is\npersuaded by arguments against all three, then one is committed to\nmoral realism. Here is not the place to present such arguments in\ndetail, but offer a flavor of the kinds of considerations that push\nphilosophers to and fro on these matters. \nOn the face of it, when we make a public moral judgment, like\n“That act of stealing was morally wrong,” what we are\ndoing is asserting that the act of stealing in question instantiates a\ncertain property: moral wrongness. This raises a number of extremely\nthorny metaethical questions: What kind of property is moral\nwrongness? How does it relate to the natural properties instantiated\nby the action? How do we have epistemic access to the property? How do\nwe confirm whether something does or does not instantiate the\nproperty? (And so on.) The difficulty of answering such questions may\nlead one to reject the presupposition that prompted them: One might\ndeny that in making a moral judgment we are engaging in the assignment\nof properties at all. Such a rejection is, roughly speaking, the\nnoncognitivist proposal. (See entry for\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.) \nIt is impossible to characterize noncognitivism in a way that will\nplease everyone. Sometimes it is presented as a view about mental\nstates and sometimes about moral language. This is because it is a\nclaim about “moral judgments,” and we can consider moral\njudgments either as private mental acts or as public utterances. If we\nare thinking of moral judgments as mental states, then noncognitivism\nis the claim that moral judgments are not beliefs. If we are thinking\nof moral judgments as speech acts, then noncognitivism is the view\nthat moral judgments do not express beliefs—i.e., it is\nthe view that moral judgments are not assertions. Here, for brevity,\nthe latter formulation will be preferred. \nIf moral judgments are not assertions, then what are they? Here the\ndifferent kinds of answers give rise to different forms of\nnoncognitivism. Ayer, as was mentioned earlier, maintained that when we\nmake a moral judgment we are expressing certain feelings, such as\napproval or disapproval. Another influential kind of noncognitivism\ncalled “prescriptivism” claims that moral judgments are\nreally veiled commands whose true meaning should be captured using the\nimperative mood: Someone who says “Stealing is morally\nwrong” is really saying something like “Don’t\nsteal!” (see Carnap 1935: 24–25). R.M. Hare (1952, 1963)\nrestricted this to commands that one is willing to universalize. \nIf noncognitivism is defined as the negation of cognitivism—as a\ntheory about what moral judgments are not—then the two theories\nare not just contraries but contradictories. However, a degree of\nbenign relaxation of criteria allows for the possibility of\n“mixed” theories. If we consider noncognitivism not as a\npurely negative thesis, but as a range of positive proposals (such as\nthose just mentioned), then it becomes possible that the nature of\nmoral judgments combines both cognitivist and noncognitivist elements.\nFor example, moral judgments (as speech acts) may be two\nthings: They may be assertions and ways of issuing commands.\n(By analogy: To call someone a “kraut” is both to assert\nthat they are German and to express a derogatory attitude toward\npeople of this nationality.) C.L. Stevenson held such a mixed view\n(1944); for modern versions, see Copp 2001; Schroeder 2009; Svoboda\n2011. \nAs mentioned, one of the major attractions of noncognitivism is that\nit is a means of sidestepping a number of thorny puzzles about\nmorality. In addition, there are several features of morality that, it\nhas been argued, the noncognitivist can accommodate more readily than\nthe cognitivist. Here are three. \nFirst, it has often been argued that noncognitivism does a good job of\naccounting for the motivational efficacy of moral judgment. If, when I\nsay “Stealing is morally wrong,” I am expressing my\napproval of stealing, and if approval is a motivation-engaging state,\nthen it seems to follow that when I sincerely judge that stealing is\nmorally wrong, I will also be motivated not to steal. By contrast, if\na Humean view of psychology is accepted, according to which beliefs\nalone can never motivate, then the cognitivist must allow that moral\njudgment alone cannot motivate; it requires the presence of\ncertain desires as well. A number of philosophers have argued that the\ncognitivist view of moral motivation seems inadequate (Smith 1994;\nToppinen 2004; see also Carbonell 2013). See entry for\n moral motivation. \nSecond, it has been argued that moral disagreements have certain\nqualities that are accommodated better by the noncognitivist than the\ncognitivist. The fact that moral disagreements are often both vehement\nand seemingly intractable, for example, might be taken as evidence\nthat what is really going on is a clash of emotional attitudes rather\nthan a clash of beliefs (Stevenson 1948; Gibbard 1992; Blackburn\n1998). \nThird, it has often been observed that we are markedly uncomfortable\nwith the idea that anyone should come to hold a moral view on the\nbasis of having deferred to an expert on morality—in contrast to\nthe way that we are perfectly comfortable with the idea that a person\nshould defer to experts when forming beliefs about, say, plate\ntectonics. This reluctance to defer to experts in forming our moral\nviews would make sense if what we are doing when we make a moral\njudgment is expressing our emotional attitudes on the matter. (See\nMcGrath 2009: 322, 2011; Hills 2011.) \nStanding against these considerations in favor of noncognitivism are a\nnumber of weighty problems. The most well-known challenge for\nnoncognitivism is the so-called Frege-Geach problem. If\n“Stealing is morally wrong” is not even the kind of thing\nthat can be true or false, then how can we make sense of it when it is\nembedded in logically complex contexts (such as “If stealing is\nmorally wrong, then encouraging your brother to steal is morally\nwrong”), and how are we to make sense of it as a premise in a\nvalid argument (since validity is, by definition, a truth-preserving\nrelation)? \nThere have been considerable efforts on behalf of noncognitivism to\nanswer this challenge. Simon Blackburn, for example, has pursued what\nhe calls a “quasi-realist” program (Blackburn 1984, 1993,\n1998). The quasi-realist is someone who endorses an anti-realist\nmetaphysical stance but who seeks, through philosophical maneuvering,\nto earn the right for moral discourse to enjoy all the\ntrappings of realist talk. Such a view may hold that although the\nunderlying logical structure of the sentence “Stealing is\nmorally wrong” is nothing more than “Stealing:\nBoo!”, it is nevertheless legitimate for ordinary speakers to\nsay things like “If stealing is morally wrong, then encouraging\nyour brother to steal is wrong” or “‘Stealing is\nmorally wrong’ is true.” One might, for instance, argue\nthat all that is required to make it acceptable to consider\n“Stealing is morally wrong” true or false (and thus a\nlegitimate antecedent in a conditional) is that it has the appropriate\nsurface propositional grammar (“x is P”); and one might\nmaintain that choosing to employ such grammar to express one’s\nnoncognitive attitudes brings no ontological commitment to any\ntroublesome property of moral wrongness. \nOne of the main challenges for the quasi-realist is to maintain a\ntheoretic distance from the moral realist. If the quasi-realist\nprogram succeeds in vindicating the use of the truth predicate for\nmoral sentences, and if in addition it makes it permissible to say\n“It is a fact that stealing is wrong,” “It is a\nmind-independent fact that stealing is wrong,” “Stealing\nwould be wrong even if our attitude toward it were different,”\nand so on—mimicking all and any of the moral realist’s\nassertions—then in what sense is quasi-realism\nquasi-realism?—Why has it not simply collapsed into the\nrobust moral realism that it set out to oppose? (See Wright 1988;\nDreier 2018.) [A quick note on terminology: Although I have here\npresented Blackburn’s quasi-realism as a potential avenue for\nthe noncognitivist to pursue, it should be noted that Blackburn\nhimself eschews the label “noncognitivism” to describe the\nposition he defends (Blackburn 1996); his preferred term is\n“projectivism.” (For discussion of the relation between\nthe two views—noncognitivism and projectivism—see Joyce\n2009.)] \nThe error theorist is a cognitivist: maintaining that moral judgment\nconsists of beliefs and assertions. However, the error theorist thinks\nthat these beliefs and assertions are never true. (The error theorist\ncontrasts here with what can be called the “success\ntheorist.”) Moral judgments are never true because the\nproperties that would be necessary to render them\ntrue—properties like moral wrongness, moral goodness, virtue,\nevil, etc.—simply don’t exist, or at least are not\ninstantiated. Defenders of moral error theory include Mackie 1977,\nHinckfuss 1987, Joyce 2001, and Olson 2014. \nIf I assert that my dog is a reptile, then I’ve asserted\nsomething false—though in this case there are other things that\nare reptiles. If I assert that my dog is a unicorn then again\nI’ve asserted something false—though in this case\nthere’s nothing in the actual world to which I could attach the\npredicate “… is a unicorn” and end up with a true\nassertion. The error theorist thinks that employing moral discourse is\nrather like talking about unicorns, though in the case of unicorns\nmost people now know that they don’t exist, while in the case of\nmoral properties most people are unaware of the error. To be an error\ntheorist about unicorns doesn’t require that you think unicorns\nare impossible creatures; it’s enough that you think that\nthey simply don’t actually exist. In the same way, to be a moral\nerror theorist doesn’t require that you think that moral\nproperties couldn’t possibly exist; it would be enough to think\nthat they are never actually instantiated. (Note that there may be a\ndifference between saying “Property P is never actually\ninstantiated” and “Property P doesn’t exist,”\nbut that’s a problem for metaphysicians to sort out. Holding\neither view with respect to moral properties is enough to make one a\nmoral error theorist.) \nTo be an error theorist about unicorns does not mean that every\nassertion involving the word “unicorn” is false. There\nwould be no error, for example, in asserting “Unicorns do not\nexist,” “The ancient Greeks believed that unicorns lived\nin India,” or “My dog is not a unicorn.” What\nis distinctive about these three sentences is that one would not, in\nasserting them, be committing oneself to the existence of unicorns.\n(It would be rather troubling if this were not true of the first, in\nparticular!) Similarly, the moral error theorist may allow that\nthe following are true: “Moral wrongness does not exist,”\n“Augustine believed that stealing pears was wrong,”\nand “Stealing is not morally wrong.” \nThe last example (“Stealing is not morally wrong”) calls\nfor an extra comment. In ordinary conversation—where,\npresumably, the possibility of moral error theory is not considered a\nlive option—someone who claims that X is not wrong would be\ntaken to be implying that X is morally good or at least morally\npermissible. And if “X” denotes something awful, like\ntorturing innocent people, then this can be used to make the error\ntheorist look awful. But when we are doing metaethics, and the\npossibility of moral error theory is on the table, then this ordinary\nimplication breaks down. The error theorist doesn’t think that\ntorturing innocent people is morally wrong, but doesn’t think\nthat it is morally good or morally permissible either. It is important\nthat criticisms of the moral error theorist do not trade on\nequivocating between the implications that hold in ordinary contexts\nand the implications that hold in metaethical contexts. \nThe sentence “Unicorns exist” is false, but there are\nnevertheless various contexts where one might have reason to utter the\nsentence: telling a story, joking, acting, speaking metaphorically,\ngiving an example of a two-word sentence, etc. What is distinctive\nabout these contexts is that one would not be asserting the\nsentence, and thus (as before) one would not, in making these\nutterances, be committing oneself to the existence of unicorns.\nSimilarly, the moral error theorist might propose that we carry on\nsaying things like “Stealing is morally wrong” but in a\nmanner that deprives our utterances of ontological commitment to moral\nproperties and, thus, removes the error from our discourse. If\nthe error theorist proposes to accomplish this by modeling moral\nlanguage on a way that familiar engagement with fictions nullifies\ncommitment, then such a moral error theorist is a\nfictionalist. (See entry for\n fictionalism; see also Kalderon 2005; Joyce 2017.)\n Other moral error theorists may think that we would be better off if\nwe pretty much eliminated moral talk from our thoughts and language.\nSuch moral error theorists are known as “abolitionists” or\n“eliminativists.” (I say “pretty much”\nsince presumably even the abolitionist allows that we can carry on\nusing moral language in the context of plays, jokes, etc.) (For debate\nbetween fictionalists and abolitionists, see Garner & Joyce\n2019.) \nError theory is commonly defined as the view that moral judgments are\n(i) truth-evaluable but (ii) always false. But there are various\nreasons for preferring to render (i) as a claim about speech\nacts—that moral judgments aim at the truth (i.e., they\nare assertions)—and (ii) as the broader claim that moral\njudgments are “untrue” rather than “false.”\nOne might, for example, be drawn to error theory because one thinks\nthat there is a sufficient amount of indeterminacy, fragmentation, or\nconfusion surrounding moral concepts that the judgments that employ\nthem, while satisfying the conditions for being beliefs and\nassertions, do not satisfy the conditions for having truth\nvalue. Perhaps, for example, moral concepts are historically derived\nfrom a theistic framework within which they made sense, yet removed\nfrom which they are mere remnants that evoke strong intuitions but,\nupon examination, make no sense. (See Anscombe 1958; MacIntyre 1984.)\nIf this is so, then it may be argued that the concept moral\nwrongness is just so ill-defined that someone who makes the moral\njudgment “Stealing is morally wrong” fails to put forward\na proposition that could be true; but since the speaker and audience\nare presumably unaware of this fact, the judgment should still count\nas an assertion. (One needs to tread carefully here.  The proposal\nthat moral judgments lack truth value is traditionally associated with\nnoncognitivism. But the noncognitivist thinks that moral judgments\nlack truth value because they are not assertions at all. The error\ntheorist, by contrast, thinks that moral judgments are\n(typically) asserted, but that they fail to be true.  Failing to have\na truth value is one way of failing to be true. Being false is the\nother way.) \nMost arguments for moral error theory, however, presuppose that moral\nconcepts do have a reasonably determinate content, but that there is\nsimply nothing in the world to satisfy this content. The traditional\nform of argument for moral error theory, thus, has two steps. First,\nthe error theorist undertakes the conceptual step of\nestablishing that in participating in moral discourse we commit\nourselves to the world being a certain way (that it contains certain\ninstantiated properties, etc.). Then the error theorist undertakes the\nontological step of establishing that the world is not that\nway. The latter may be achieved (in principle, at least) either\nthrough a priori means or through a posteriori\nmethods. \nOne example of an argument with this structure is as follows. First it\nis noted that “S morally ought to φ” is true\nonly if S is a moral agent. The further conceptual steps of the\nargument then seek to establish that in order to be moral agent,\nS must have the capacity to perform actions that are morally\nblameworthy and praiseworthy, and that these capacities presuppose\nthat S has a certain kind of control over their actions. The\nontological step of the argument then seeks to establish that no such\nautonomous control exists in nature; it’s an illusion. (See\nentry for\n skepticism about moral responsibility.)\n A couple of iterations of modus tollens then take us to the\nconclusion that “S morally ought to φ” is never\ntrue. \nThe argument just sketched would locate the moral error in a mistake\nwe make about the kind of creatures we are. The more widely discussed\narguments, however, locate the moral error in a mistake we make about\nthe kind of world we inhabit. John Mackie (who coined the term\n“error theory” in 1977) argues that when we participate in\nmoral discourse we commit ourselves to the existence of objective\nvalues and objective prescriptions, but there are no such things.\nEssentially, Mackie argues that the moral realist is correct about\nmorality conceptually speaking—we are moral\nrealists—but the moral realist is incorrect about how the world\nactually is. Moral facts place demands upon us, but (Mackie asks) how\ncould such demands exist objectively? This would seem to\nrequire rules of conduct somehow written into the fabric of the\nuniverse, and nothing in our understanding of the objective\nnaturalistic world (Mackie goes on) suggests that anything of the kind\nexists. Mackie famously calls such properties “queer” (in\nwhat seems now an increasingly anachronistic use of the term). \nMackie occasionally cashes out his “argument from\nqueerness” in terms of practical reasons. He writes that\n“to say that [objective prescriptions] are intrinsically\naction-guiding [which is one way he sometimes describes the\nnormativity whose existence he denies] is to say that the reasons that\nthey give for doing or for not doing something are independent of that\nagent’s desires or purposes” (Mackie 1982: 115). Surely if\nsomeone is morally required to do something (Mackie thinks), then that\nperson must have a reason to do it. (After all, if one were to deny\nthis, then what kind of “normative teeth” would moral\nproperties have? “Yes, I know that X is morally wrong, but I\nhave no reason to avoid moral wrongness, so the wrongness of X is\nnothing to me” would become, in principle, an acceptable thing\nto say.) But since morality often seems to demand that we do things\nthat we don’t want to do, then morality seems to imply the\nexistence of reasons to do things that we don’t want to do. One\ncould, at this point, simply throw up one’s hands and claim that\nsuch reasons would be too weird to countenance. But one could also go\nbeyond the “argument from queerness” by instead arguing\nmethodically that a Humean (instrumentalist) theory of reasons for\naction—according to which reasons ultimately depend on our\nends—is superior to any form of practical non-instrumentalism.\n(See entry for\n reason for action: internal and external.)\n According to such a view, the practical non-instrumentalist is\ncorrect about morality conceptually speaking—in engaging\nin moral discourse, we commit ourselves to non-instrumentalist\nreasons—but the practical non-instrumentalist is incorrect about\nhow the world actually is: a Humean theory of reasons for action is more\ndefensible. (It is worth noting that endorsing Humean instrumentalism about\nreasons for action does not in any obvious way commit one to the\nendorsement of instrumentalism about other kinds of reasons, such as\nepistemic reasons. See Joyce 2019; Cowie 2019.) \nIf an argument for moral error theory has two steps—the\nconceptual and the ontological—then there are two places to\nobject. If we consider Mackie’s argument, for example, then one\nkind of opponent will agree that objective values and prescriptions\nwould be too weird to countenance, but maintain that it doesn’t\nmatter because moral discourse is not committed to the existence of\nsuch strange creatures. Another kind of opponent will agree with\nMackie that morality is committed to the existence of objective values\nand prescriptions, but maintain that there is nothing particularly\nstrange about them. \nError theorists must be prepared to defend themselves on both fronts.\nThis job is made difficult by the fact that it may be hard to\narticulate precisely what it is that is so troubling about morality.\nThis failure need not be due to a lack of clear thinking or\nimagination on the error theorists’ part, for the thing that is\ntroubling them may be that there is something deeply mysterious about\nmorality. The moral error theorist may, for example, perceive that\nmoral imperatives are imbued with a kind of mystical practical\nauthority—a quality that, being mysterious, of course\ncannot be articulated in terms satisfactory to an analytic\nphilosopher. Such an error theorist is forced to fall back on vague\nmetaphors in presenting their case: Moral properties have a\n“to-be-pursuedness” to them (Mackie 1977: 40), moral facts\nwould require that “the universe takes sides” (Burgess\n[1978] 2007), moral believers are committed to “demands as real\nas trees and as authoritative as orders from headquarters”\n(Garner 1994: 61), and so on. Indeed, it may be the vague, equivocal,\nquasi-mystical, and/or ineliminably metaphorical imponderabilia of\nmoral discourse that so troubles the error theorist. (See Hussain\n2004.) \nEven if the error theorist can articulate a clear and determinate\nproblematic feature of morality, the dispute over whether this quality\nshould count as a “non-negotiable component” of morality\nhas a tendency to lead quickly to impasse, for there is no accepted\nmethodology for deciding when a discourse is “centrally\ncommitted” to a given thesis. What is evidently needed is a\nworkable model of the identity criteria for concepts (allowing us\nconfidently to either affirm or deny such claims as “The concept\nof moral obligation is the concept of an objective\nrequirement”)—but we have no such model, and there is no\nconsensus even on what approximate shape such a model would take. \nIt is also possible that the most reasonable account of conceptual\ncontent will leave many concepts with significantly indistinct\nborders. There may simply be no fact of the matter about whether moral\ndiscourse is committed to the existence of non-instrumental reasons\n(for example). Thinking along these lines, David Lewis makes use of\nthe distinction between speaking strictly and speaking loosely:\n“Strictly speaking, Mackie is right: genuine values would have\nto meet an impossible condition, so it is an error to think there are\nany. Loosely speaking, the name may go to a claimant that deserves it\nimperfectly … What to make of the situation is mainly a matter\nof temperament” (Lewis [1989] 2000: 93).  Lewis’s own\ntemperament leads him to seek to vindicate value discourse, and he\nthinks that this can be done by supporting a dispositional theory of\nvalue (of a kind to be discussed in the next section). But since there\nis no logical or methodological requirement that we should prefer\nspeaking loosely over speaking strictly, or vice versa, then this\nwould leave the the dispute between moral error theorists and success\ntheorists a fundamentally undecidable matter—there may simply be\nno fact of the matter about who is correct. (See Joyce 2012.) \nTo deny both noncognitivism and the moral error theory suffices to\nmake one a minimal moral realist. Traditionally, however, moral\nrealism has required the acceptance of a further thesis: the\nobjectivity of morality. “Moral non-objectivism” denotes\nthe view that moral facts exist and are mind-dependent (in the\nrelevant sense), while “moral objectivism” holds that they\nexist and are mind-independent. (Note that this taxonomy makes the two\ncontraries rather than contradictories; the error theorist and the\nnoncognitivist count as neither objectivists nor non-objectivists. The\nerror theorist may, however, be an objectivist in a different sense:\nin holding that objectivity is a feature of\nmorality conceptually speaking.) Let us say that if one is a\nmoral cognitivist and a moral success theorist and a\nmoral objectivist, then one is a\nrobust moral realist. \nYet this third condition, even more than the first two, introduces a\ngreat deal of messiness into the dialectic, and the line between the\nrealist and the anti-realist becomes obscure (and, one might think,\nless interesting). The basic problem is that there are many\nnon-equivalent ways of understanding the relation of\nmind-(in)dependence, and thus one philosopher’s realism\nbecomes another philosopher’s anti-realism. At least one\nphilosopher, Gideon Rosen, has expressed pessimism that the relevant\nnotion of objectivity can be sharpened to a useful philosophical\npoint: \nAs Rosen says, metaphors to mark non-objectivism from objectivism are\neasy to come by and easy to motivate in the uninitiated. The\nobjectivist about X likens our X-oriented activity to astronomy,\ngeography, or exploration; the non-objectivist likens it to sculpture\nor imaginative writing. (These are Michael Dummett’s metaphors\n(1978: xxv).) The objectivist sees the goal of our inquiries as being\nto “carve the beast of reality at the joints” (as the\npopular paraphrase of Plato’s Phaedrus puts it); the\nnon-objectivist sees our inquiries as the application of a\n“cookie cutter”: imposing a noncompulsory conceptual\nframework onto an undifferentiated reality (to use Hilary\nPutnam’s equally memorable image (1987: 19)). The objectivist\nsees inquiry as a process of detection, our judgments aiming\nto reflect the extension of the truth predicate with respect\nto a certain subject; the non-objectivist sees inquiry as a process of\nprojection, our judgments determining the extension\nof the truth predicate regarding that subject. \nThe claim “X is mind-(in)dependent” is certainly too\ncoarse-grained to do serious work in capturing these powerful\nmetaphors; it is, perhaps, better thought of as a slogan or as a piece\nof shorthand. There are two conspicuous points at which the phrase\nrequires precisification. First, we need to decide what exactly the\nword “mind” stands for. It can be construed strictly and\nliterally, to mean mental activity, or it can be understood\nin a more liberal manner, to include such things as conceptual\nschemes, theories, methods of proof, linguistic practices,\nconventions, sentences, institutions, culture, means of epistemic\naccess, etc. Were the moral facts to depend on any of these\nanthropocentric things, the anti-realist imagery of humans as\ninventors of morality may seem more apt than that of humans as\ndiscoverers. Second, we need to decide what kind of relation is\ndenoted by “(in)dependent.” Consider the following\npossibilities, any of which might form the basis of the claim that\ngoodness depends on mental activity (in this case, for\nsimplicity, Mary’s attitude of approval): \nx is good iff Mary approves of x. \nx is good iff Mary would approve of x (in such-and-such\ncircumstances). \nx is good iff x merits Mary’s approval. \nThe catalog can be made longer, depending on whether the\n“iff” is construed as necessary or contingent, conceptual,\na priori, or a posteriori. To illustrate further the\nubiquity of and variation among mind-dependence relations on the menu\nof moral theories, consider the following: \nIndeed, it is difficult to think of any serious version of moral\nsuccess theory for which the moral facts depend in no way on\nmental activity. Yet to conclude that the distinction between minimal\nand robust realism cannot be upheld would be premature. Many\nmetaethicists who reject noncognitivism and the error theory, and thus\ncount as minimal realists, continue to define their position (often\nunder the label “constructivism”) in contrast to a realist\nview. (See Bagnoli 2002; Ronzoni 2010; Street 2010, 2012. See also the\nentry on\n constructivism in metaethics.)\n The challenge is to pick among the various mind-(in)dependence\nrelations in the hope of drawing a distinction that is philosophically\ninteresting and meshes satisfactorily with our preexisting\nphilosophical taxonomy, such that some success theorists count as\nrealists and some do not. \nElizabeth Tropman (2018) argues that the best way of understanding\nmoral objectivity is as follows: The fact that x is M (where\n“… is M” is some moral predicate) is objective\nif and only if this fact doesn’t depend only on any actual or\nhypothetical agent’s (i) belief or noncognitive attitude about\nx’s being M, or (ii) noncognitive attitude about\nx. According to this view, many of the aforementioned examples\nof moral theories, although making moral facts dependent in various\nways on various kinds of mental phenomena, will not count as\nnon-objective. Consider, for example, the utilitarian view that what\nmakes a particular action, φ, morally obligatory is that it\nproduces maximal happiness. According to this view, although some\nagent’s (or agents’) mental states—in this case,\ntheir happiness—may contribute to φ’s moral status,\nthey do not exclusively determine it. Other factors also contribute to\nφ’s moral status, such as how φ compares with other\npotential actions in terms of happiness production,. Therefore, on\nTropman’s view, this form of utilitarianism would satisfy the\nrequirements for morality to count as objective. \nThe attractions of moral non-objectivism are that it ticks a lot of\nboxes that its competitors fail to tick. Unlike noncognitivism or\nerror theory, moral non-objectivism is a form of moral anti-realism\nthat allows for the existence of moral beliefs, moral facts, and moral\ntruth, and thus also potentially makes conceptual space for such\nthings as moral progress and moral knowledge. Unlike moral realism, by\nmaking the moral facts depend on us, moral non-objectivism seems to\nhave an easier time accounting for a moral ontology that is both\nnaturalistic and normative. \nGiven the wide variety of versions of moral non-objectivity,\nidentifying generic problems is not a straightforward task. One way of\nbringing out some potential worries is to see the non-objectivist as\nfacing a dilemma. Moral objectivism comes in both relativistic and\nabsolutist flavors, and either way one goes poses challenges. \nConsider first an absolutist version on non-objectivism. Here we would\nhave to identify some agent or group of agents whose beliefs or\nnoncognitive attitudes determine the moral facts. Reasonable\ncontenders for this role are not going to be actual particular people.\nIt would not, for example, be a reasonable theory that maintained that\nthe moral facts for everyone throughout all time are determined by\nwhat Richard Joyce thinks on the matter. (The only plausible contender\nfor this role might be God, but such a theory faces its own\narray of problems.) Rather, absolutist non-objectivists are likely to\nplump for idealized hypothetical agents. Roderick Firth (1952), for\nexample, identifies moral properties with dispositions to prompt\nresponsive attitudes in an “ideal observer”—where\nthe ideal observer is defined in terms such as omniscience,\ndisinterestedness, and dispassionateness. (Slightly confusingly for\nour purposes, Firth explicitly characterizes this theory as an\nobjectivist one, but this is because he has in mind a kind of\nexistential mind-dependence relation. The moral status of an\naction, on this view, doesn’t depend on the existence of an\nideal observer’s mental activity; rather, it depends on how such\nan agent counterfactually would respond. We can consider this as\nfurther evidence of the difficulties in nailing down a fixed notion of\nmoral objectivity.) A structurally similar version of\nabsolutist non-objectivism is Ronald Milo’s contractarian\nconstructivism (1995), according to which the moral facts are determined by\nthe choices that would be made by a hypothetical idealized group of\nrational contractors. (See also Scanlon 1998.) \nThe challenge for such theories is to explain why one should\ncare about the moral status of actions. Since the person or\ngroup that determines the moral status of my actions is not me,\nand is not even someone I’ve ever met or necessarily care about,\nthen why should their hypothetical responses matter to me? Any\nparticular proposed action of mine will have an infinity of\ndispositional properties. My proposed action of, say, stealing a\nnewspaper may have the dispositional property that a Firthian ideal\nobserver would disapprove of it, while simultaneously having the\ndispositional property that a Miloesque idealized group of\nrational contractors would choose to refrain from it. But it also has\na myriad of other dispositions to prompt responses in hypothetical\nagents: it may also be such that drunken Vikings would heartily\ncheer it, be such that zealous medieval samurai would think it\ndishonorable, be such that Soviet communists seeking to promote the\nWorkers’ Revolution would regard it as obligatory, and so on.\nThe question is why I, in trying to decide how to act, should care\nabout any of these dispositional properties—or (perhaps more\npointedly) why I should care about one of them very much indeed while\nignoring all the others. Simply labeling one of these dispositional\nproperties “moral wrongness” doesn’t make that\nproperty matter. \nOne response to this challenge is to make the idealized judges, whose\nbeliefs or noncognitive states determine the moral status of\nagents’ actions, versions of the agents themselves (see Carson\n1984). Perhaps I have reason to care about what I would think\nif I were, say, fully informed and had fully reflected on the matter.\nThis brings us back to the other horn of the dilemma: the relativistic\nversion on non-objectivism. The problem is that securing the practical\nsignificance of moral facts in this manner (something that the\nabsolutist version struggles to secure) comes at a price. If you and I\nare quite different people—with different desires, interests,\nand goals—then the idealized version of me may have a different\nresponse to a situation than the idealized version of you would have\n(see Sobel 1999). In this case, the very same action may be morally\nright relative to me and morally wrong relative to you, and\nthat’s all there is to it: there would be no way for you and me\nto settle our moral disagreement. Indeed, there may not even be\na disagreement, since if when I say “X is morally right” I\nmean … relative to idealized me, and when you say\n“No, X is not morally right” you mean … relative\nto idealized you, then we are not really contradicting each other.\n(See entry for\n moral relativism.)\n If relativistic non-objectivism makes moral disagreement disappear,\nthen it very probably also makes the notion of moral progress\ndisappear. If the moral views I held in the past were true relative\nto me then (though false relative to me now), and my current very\ndifferent moral views are true relative to me now (but false relative\nto past me), then the best one could say on behalf of moral progress\nis that there has been progress from my current point of view\n(something that will be seen as moral deterioration from my past point\nof view). To the extent, then, that we do wish to accommodate the\nexistence of moral disagreement and moral progress, relativistic\nnon-objectivism has some explaining to do. (Note that the version of\nrelativistic non-objectivism just discussed is individual-relative,\nbut the same problems concerning disagreement and moral progress would\narise if a culture-oriented version of relativism were examined\ninstead.) \nThe proposal that moral facts are non-objective—that morality is\nsomething created, not discovered—is often rejected in popular\ndiscussion because people have only crude versions of non-objectivism\nin mind, such as views that would make the moral facts for a person be\njust whatever whimsically suits them (e.g., “X is morally\nwrong” = “I disapprove of X”). But no professional\nphilosopher endorses such a view; nobody thinks that the\nnon-objectivity of morality would be like the non-objectivity of\nchoosing your favorite ice cream flavor. Serious forms of moral\nnon-objectivism are sophisticated and subtle. Still, there is a real\nworry that if the non-objectivism is too\nsophisticated—especially if it looks to the responses of highly\nidealized hypothetical agents as being determinative of the moral\nfacts—then the question of why, on this account, morality would\nmatter to non-idealized non-hypothetical agents comes to the\nfore. \nThis entry has not attempted to adjudicate the rich and noisy debate\nbetween the moral realist and moral anti-realist, but rather has\nattempted to clarify just what their debate is about. But even this\nmuch more modest task is doomed to lead to unsatisfactory results, for\nthere is much confusion—perhaps a hopeless\nconfusion—about how the terms of the debate should be drawn up.\nIt is entirely possible that when subjected to acute critical\nexamination, the traditional dialectic between the moral realist and\nthe moral anti-realist will crumble into a bunch of evocative\nmetaphors from which well-formed philosophical theses cannot be\nextracted. If this is true, it would not follow that metaethics is\nbankrupt; far from it—it may be more accurate to think that\nmodern metaethics has prospered to such an extent that the old terms\nno longer fit its complex landscape. \nBut for present, at least, the terms “moral realist” and\n“moral anti-realist” seem firmly entrenched. With so much\nill-defined, however, it would seem close to pointless to conduct\nmetaethical debate under these terms. This latitude means\nthat the terms “moral realist” and “moral\nanti-realist” are free to be bandied with rhetorical\nforce—more as badges of honor or terms of abuse (as the case may\nbe) than as useful descriptive labels. Rather like arguments over\nwhether some avant-garde gallery installation does or does not count\nas “art,” taxonomic bickering over whether a given\nphilosopher is or is not a “moral realist” is an activity\nas tiresome as it is fruitless. \nJust as important as gaining a clear and distinct understanding of\nthese labels is gaining an appreciation of what of real consequence\nturns on the debate. This seems particularly pressing here because a\nnatural suspicion is that much of the opposition to moral anti-realism\ndevelops from a nebulous but nagging practical concern about what\nmight happen—to individuals, to the community, to\nsocial order—if moral anti-realism, in one guise or another,\nwere widely adopted. The embrace of moral anti-realism, it is assumed,\nwill have an insidious influence. This concern presupposes that most\nof the folk are already pretheoretically inclined toward\nmoral realism—an assumption that was queried earlier. But even\nif it is true that most people are naive moral realists, the question\nof what would happen if they ceased to be so is an empirical matter,\nconcerning which neither optimism nor pessimism seems prima facie more\nwarranted than the other. As with the opposition to moral\nnon-objectivism, the more general opposition to moral anti-realism is\nfrequently based on an under-estimation of the resources available to\nthe anti-realist—on an unexamined assumption that the silliest,\ncrudest, or most pernicious version will stand as a good\nrepresentative of a whole range of extremely varied and often\nsophisticated theories.","contact.mail":"richard.joyce@vuw.ac.nz","contact.domain":"vuw.ac.nz"}]
