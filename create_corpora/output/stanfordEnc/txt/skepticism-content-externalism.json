Descartes’ Evil Genius hypothesis is perhaps the\nbest known such hypothesis. Another is the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis,\naccording to which human beings are brains in vats whose mental\nexperiences, although qualitatively the same as in their normal lives,\nare all caused by a supercomputer. The skeptic then argues that many\nof the propositions about the external world that we take for granted\n(such as “Trees are green”) are propositions that we\ndon’t know, since our evidence for such propositions is often\nexactly the same as the evidence we would have in a vat-world in which\nthese propositions are false.\n\n\nHilary Putnam (1981) proposed an interesting and much discussed\nattempt to refute a skeptical argument that is based on one form of\nthe brain-and-a-vat scenario. In turn, Putnam’s attempted\nrefutation is based on content externalism (also known as semantic\nexternalism). On this view, the referents and meanings of various\ntypes of singular and general terms, as well as the propositions\nexpressed by sentences containing such terms, are determined by\naspects of the speaker’s external environment. In this entry, we\nwill consider the basic features of and problems with Putnam’s\noriginal argument, and we will also present and discuss several of the\nmost important attempts to reconstruct or improve upon that\nargument.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cartesian Skeptic describes an alleged logically possible scenario\nin which our mental lives and their histories are precisely the same\nas what they actually are, but where the causes of the facts about our\nmental lives are not the kinds of events in the external world that we\ncommonly think they are. On Descartes’ Evil Genius hypothesis,\nthere is no physical world. Rather you are a disembodied mind, and\nyour entire mental life, with all of its experiences, has been caused\nby an all-powerful, purely spiritual Evil Genius. As a result, your\nbeliefs about the external world, such as that you have a body, or\nthat there are planets in the solar system, are all mistaken. On the\nbrain-in-a-vat hypothesis, a given person is a disembodied brain\nliving in a vat of nutrients. The nerve endings of the brain are\nconnected to a supercomputer, whose program sends electrical impulses\nthat stimulate the brain in the same way that actual brains are\nstimulated when perceiving external objects. If you are a brain in a\nvat, suppose, your conscious experiences are and have been\nqualitatively indistinguishable from the experiences you have had over\nthe entire course of your mental life. But if as the result of your\ncomputer-caused experiences you believe, say, that you have a body,\nthen you are mistaken. \nGiven such an hypothesis as that of the brain-in-a-vat, the skeptic\ncan go on to argue that there are many commonsense beliefs that we\nthink we know, but that we do not in fact know. One common such\nargument is based on the widely endorsed closure principle that\nknowledge is closed under known entailments: \nNow pick any proposition about the external world that you think you\nknow to be true but that is inconsistent with your being a brain in a\nvat, say, the proposition that you have a body. Then the skeptic can\nargue as follows: \nPremise (3) seems justified by the fact that you have the same\nconscious experiences whether you are a normal human in a normal\nphysical world or a brain in a vat. For again, the evidence you have\nfor each alternative is exactly the same. So you don’t know that\nyou’re not a brain in a vat. \nOn Putnam’s version of the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis, the\ncontents of the universe now and always have been relatively few.\nThere have existed and now exist only brains in vats of nutrients and\nthe supercomputers that send and receive messages to and from each\nbrain. Putnam’s hypothesis assumes that each human (and each\nsentient creature) that exists or has ever existed is one of the\nbrains in the vats. The supercomputers are so clever that their\nelectronic interactions with the brains result in exact duplications\nof the mental lives and histories of each person whose brain is in a\nvat. Thus I, you, indeed we (all human beings) are brains in\na vat on this hypothesis. Let us call a brain in a vat of this sort a\n‘BIV’. \nPutnam’s goal is to refute the skeptical argument that is based\non the BIV hypothesis, by providing a counterargument for the\nconclusion that we are not BIVs. Thus, each of us is provided with a\nway of knowing that she is not a BIV, contrary to premise (3)\nof the skeptical argument (SA) above. The crucial move in\nPutnam’s argument is a sub-argument to the effect that that if\none were a BIV, one would not be able to grasp the meanings of various\ngeneral terms, such as ‘tree’, ‘brain’, and\n‘vat’. For in order for an utterance of ‘tree’\nfor example to represent or refer to trees, Putnam maintains, there\nmust be some causal connection between uses of\n‘tree’ and real trees (Putnam 1981 [1999: 37]). Following\nWright (1992: 71), I will call this ‘the causal\nconstraint’. A similar point, Putnam assumes, holds for the\nwords ‘brain’ and ‘vat’, as well as for mental\nutterances of, and the concepts expressed by, such words. It follows\nthat if we are BIVs, then since our uses of ‘brain’ and\n‘vat’ do not bear the right causal relations to actual\nbrains and vats, we cannot so much as think or say\nthat we are brains in a vat (Putnam 1981 [1999: 31]). \nPutnam goes on to suggest that while a BIV cannot think or say that\nshe is a brain in a vat, her utterances of ‘BIV’ could\nrefer to something else. For instance, the utterances could\nrefer to (i) BIVs-in-the-image. That is, the utterances could refer to\nthe succession of experiences as of being a BIV. In this case, the\nBIV’s utterance would just be false, since the computer\nprogram would never allow her to have perceptual experiences as of\nbeing an envatted brain as opposed to being an embodied person. (Of\ncourse, a BIV could only seem to be uttering words. So we\nshould just identify her utterances with her mental\n‘seemings’ to utter. See Putnam 1981 [1999: 31].) \nIn addition to ‘brain-in-a-vat-in-the-image’, Putnam\nsuggests (1981 [1999: 36]) two other possible sorts of things that\n‘brain in a vat’ might refer to for a BIV. It might also\nrefer to (ii) the electronic impulses that cause experiences as of\nbeing a BIV or perhaps to (iii) features of the computer program that\ncause those electronic impulses. I will use the expressions\n‘brain* in a vat*’ and ‘BIV*’ to provide a\nschematic representation of whichever of these three possible meanings\nof ‘BIV’ in vat-English is correct, or if none is correct,\n‘brain* in a vat*’ and ‘BIV*’ represent the\nmeaning of ‘BIV’ in vat-English, whatever it is. \nThe important fact for Putnam’s argument is that whichever of\nthese possible meanings is had in vat-English by ‘I am a brain\nin a vat’, that sentence, as used by a BIV, will be\nfalse. We saw that in sense (i), ‘I am a brain in a\nvat’ would be false in vat-English, since a BIV would never have\n(perceptual) experiences as of being a BIV. Putnam does not explain\nwhy ‘I am a brain in a vat’ would be false in both senses\n(ii) and (iii). Brueckner (2016: 4) suggests that since in sense (iii)\nboth ‘brain’ and ‘vat’ would refer to certain\ncomputer program features, a BIV would not be a BIV in sense (iii): no\nBIV would be a certain computer program feature that is “located\nin” a certain other computer program feature. A similar point\nwould hold for sense (ii). From these considerations, Putnam then\nconcludes: “In short, if we are brains in a vat, then ‘we\nare brains in a vat’ is false. So it is (necessarily)\nfalse” (Putnam 1981 [1999: 37]). Here, Putnam seems to think\nthat he has shown the conclusion that he was aiming to show, namely,\nthat we are not brains in a vat. But in fact, the most he has\nshown so far is that a BIV’s utterance of ‘We are not\nbrains in a vat’ would be true. But this conclusion is simply\nirrelevant to Putnam’s goal, since as Putnam himself points out,\nthe BIV’s utterance does not mean that we are not BIVs\n(see Brueckner 1986: 152 and Forbes 1995 [1999: 63]). \nVarious authors have noted that additional information is needed to\nderive Putnam’s desired conclusion (‘I am not a brain in a\nvat’). One of the earliest and most important of these\nreconstructions was suggested by Anthony Brueckner (1986). He proposed\nthat Putnam’s argument could reasonably be construed as an\ninstance of disjunction elimination (\\(p \\lor q\\), \\(p \\rightarrow\nr\\), \\(q \\rightarrow r \\vdash r\\)) as follows: \nIt is important to note, as Brueckner does, that (7) is not\nPutnam’s desired conclusion (‘I am not a BIV’), nor\ndoes it alone imply this conclusion, since (7) is consistent with the\nspeaker’s being a BIV, in the English sense of\n‘BIV’. \nTo reach Putnam’s conclusion, Brueckner considers use of the\nfollowing disquotation principle: \nNote that (7) implies \nAnd (8) together with (T) apparently yield the desired anti-skeptical\nconclusion: I am not a BIV. \nBut Brueckner persuasively argues (1986: 164–165) that using the\ndisquotational principle (T) in this context is illegitimate. In\neffect, (T) as used in this context is ambiguous (see Folina\n2016: 159). Depending on whether the speaker is or is not a BIV, (T)\nwill provide different truth conditions for the speaker’s\nutterances of ‘I am not a BIV’. If the speaker is not a\nBIV and thus is speaking English in uttering (T), then the truth\ncondition for ‘I am not a BIV’ is just the condition that\nthe speaker is not a BIV. But if the speaker is a BIV, then the truth\ncondition expressed by ‘I am not a BIV’ is the condition\nthat the speaker is not a BIV*, where ‘BIV*’ has the\nvat-English meaning of ‘BIV’, whatever it is (perhaps one\nof the three meanings that Putnam suggests). Note that on this\ninterpretation, the argument’s conclusion (that the speaker is\nnot a BIV*) is simply irrelevant, since Putnam’s\ndesired conclusion is ‘I am not a BIV’ in its\nEnglish sense. \nOn the other hand, if the speaker is assumed to be speaking English in\nusing (T), then (T) together with (8) does imply the desired\nanti-skeptical result ‘I am not a BIV’ in its English\nsense. But, as Brueckner puts it in some later articles (1992, 2016),\nthis use of (T) just begs the question, since for the conclusion\n(‘I am not a BIV’) to be true in English, the speaker must\nbe speaking English in uttering the premise (T), and so must be a\nnon-BIV, which is of course the conclusion to be shown. As Brueckner\nsays, the argument  \n… is epistemically circular in William Alston’s\nsense: knowledge of one of its premises—(T)—requires\nknowledge of its conclusion [Alston 1989]. (Brueckner 2016: 4) \nAnother way to see that the argument based on the English sense of (T)\nwould be question-begging is to ask whether a speaker would have\nwarrant to believe (T) in its English sense, if the speaker did not\nalready have warrant to believe that she was a non-BIV\nspeaking English. Note that if the speaker were a BIV speaking\nvat-English, the speaker would not even understand (T) in its\nEnglish sense, let alone have warrant to believe it in that sense. So\nit surely seems that the speaker could not have warrant to believe (T)\nin its English sense unless she already had warrant to\nbelieve the argument’s conclusion, that is, had warrant to\nbelieve ‘I am not a BIV’ in its English sense. (See\nBrueckner 1986: 164–165 and 2016: 4. The type of\nquestion-begging just described, as well as the type described by\nAlston (1986 [1989]) would seem to be the same as the type identified\nby Crispin Wright and that he describes as failure of warrant to\ntransmit from premise to conclusion. See Wright 1985: 436; 2000:\n141–143; see also Davies 2000: 397–399.) \nThe proper conclusion to draw from Brueckner’s seminal\ndiscussion would thus seem to be that either the argument (B) plus (T)\nhas an irrelevant conclusion (if the speaker is assumed to be a BIV\nspeaking vat-English), or the argument begs the question (if the\nspeaker is assumed to be a non-BIV speaking English). \nIn later work Brueckner 1992 and 2003 seems to raise a problem for the\nquestion-begging charge, when he points out that one can know that a\ngiven disquotational principle expresses a truth whether one is a\nnon-BIV speaker of English or a BIV speaker of vat-English. We will\ndiscuss this issue below in section 6. \nIn later work on Putnam’s anti-skeptical argument, especially in\nhis articles 1992 and 2003, Brueckner seems to have abandoned his\n(1986) objection to uses of disquotation, such as the use of (T), in\nvarious versions of Putnam’s argument. In his 1992 Brueckner\nproposes a general schema in which to formulate specific Putnamian\nanti-skeptical arguments (1992 [1999: 48]): \nBrueckner calls this the semantic argument. As an instance of\nthe disquotational premise II, Brueckner considers (1992 [1999: 53]):\n \nApparently as justification for use of (**) in anti-skeptical\narguments, Brueckner notes: \nThis statement of disquotational truth conditions for my utterances of\n‘I am a BIV’ is guaranteed to express a truth as long as\nthe metalanguage in which (**) is stated contains the object language\nto which my utterance ‘I am a BIV’ belongs. \nSo it seems that Brueckner has changed his mind from his 1986 and at\nthis point no longer believes that the use of disquotation in\nPutnamian anti-skeptical arguments is question-begging. We will return\nto this topic below. \nBut while seeming to accept disquotational premises, Brueckner now\nsees serious problems with instances of the first premise-schema I. He\nconsiders the following instance of I: \nwhere, as Brueckner puts it, “‘I am a BIV*’\nformulates the Putnamian non-disquotational truth conditions, whatever\nthey are”. (As Brueckner had explained earlier (1992 [1999:\n47]), these truth conditions would be\n“non-disquotational”, since the metalanguage in which they\nare stated does not contain the object language to which the the\nrelevant BIV tokens of ‘I am a BIV’ belong.) Now for\n(Cond) to be true, its consequent must be true when evaluated at a\nvat-world. So consider the consequent of (Cond.): \nAccording to Brueckner, since (Cons) is not disquotational, the\nmetalanguage in which it is expressed cannot contain the object\nlanguage to which utterances of ‘I am a BIV’ (as meant in\n(Cons)) belongs. But then, Brueckner argues, (Cons) can express a\ntruth at a vat-world only if its speaker is not in a\nvat-world. Here, Brueckner seems to reason that since the metalanguage\nbeing used to express (Cons) does not contain the object language\nbeing described (vat-English), the metalanguage being used is a\nlanguage spoken only by non-BIVs. Brueckner concludes, “we\napparently cannot, without begging the question, use premise\n(I) of the anti-skeptical semantic argument” (1992 [1999: 55];\nhis italics). \nCrispin Wright (1992: 74) suggested an important reconstruction of\nPutnam’s anti-skeptical argument which, like Brueckner’s\noriginal reconstruction, also essentially depends on disquotation: \nBob Hale (2000: 185) points out that the two premises (i) and (iii)\ninvolving disquotation are both acceptable. Both  \nmight be available to, and warranted for, a proponent of the argument,\nregardless of whether she is or is not a\nbrain-in-a-vat…. (his italics)  \nHowever, Hale argues, provided that the speaker of premise (ii) is not\nmerely contradicting premise (i), she must not be using\n‘brain-in-a-vat’ as a disquotation of\n“’brain-in-a-vat’”, as it occurs earlier in\n(ii). Thus the speaker of (ii) must not be speaking BIVese, and so\nmust be a non-BIV. Hale concludes,  \n… in taking premiss (ii) to be available to him, Putnam is in\neffect assuming that he is not a brain-in-a-vat. Since that\nis just what he is trying to prove, his argument is viciously\ncircular. (2000: 186; his italics) \nClearly, Hale’s point provides a powerful objection to\nWright’s reconstruction of Putnam’s argument. \nBrueckner (2003: 156) considers the following argument: \nIn reply to the objection that use of the disquotational premise (B*)\nbegs the question, Brueckner says that the objector would be right to\nreject a defense of (B*) that is based on the claim that since I know\nthat I’m a normal speaker of English, I also know (B*). Such a\nclaim would indeed beg the question, Brueckner says. But he goes on to\nsuggest that knowledge of such disquotational facts as (B*) need not\nbe based on knowledge that one is a normal English speaker. Rather,\nthe former kind of knowledge “is simply part of understanding my\nown language (whatever it is and whatever I am)” (2003:\n157). \nIn this reply, Brueckner seems to be relying on the fact that one can\nknow that (B*) expresses a truth, whether or not one is a non-BIV\nspeaker of English or a BIV speaking vat-English. That is simply\nbecause, whatever language is being spoken in uttering (B*), the\nmetalanguage being used contains the object language sentence that\nprovides the relevant truth condition. \nBut as Brueckner himself had earlier pointed out (1986: 165; 1995:\n100)), while we can in this manner know that disquotational sentences\nlike (B*) are true, we cannot know which truth is\nbeing expressed until we know which language is being spoken. In this\ncase, if the speaker is a BIV speaking vat-English, then (B*) would\nmean “My utterances of ‘trees are green’ are true\niff trees* are green” (where ‘trees*’ expresses one\nof the three possible types of meanings that Putnam suggests for\n‘tree’ in vat-English). So on the assumption that the\nspeaker is a BIV speaking vat-English, premise (B*) would be true.\nHowever, the conclusion (C) of the argument would then mean ‘I\nam not a BIV*’, and while this conclusion would also be true, it\nis also irrelevant to Putnam’s desired conclusion (in English)\n‘I am not a BIV’. Moreover, note that if understood to be\nin vat-English, the premise (A*) would be false. \nOn the other hand, if we assume that the speaker is a non-BIV speaking\nEnglish, then premises (A*) and (B*) would both be true, as would the\nconclusion (C). However, the argument in question, though sound, would\nblatantly beg the question. For in order for the speaker to have\nwarrant that premises (A*) and (B*) are both true in the relevant\nsenses, warrant must already be available to the speaker of\n(A*) and (B*) that she is a non-BIV speaking English. \nWe should also note that premise (A*) cannot be true if it is spoken\nby a BIV speaking vat-English, since disquotation holds for\nvat-English as well as English. Thus (A*) is true only if spoken by a\nnon-BIV speaking English, and so its use begs the question for the\nsame reason pointed out by Hale (2000) regarding Wright’s (1992)\nreconstruction. \nBrueckner goes on in his 2003 to consider what he would later (2016)\ncall a modified version of Simple Argument 1 or SA1: \nBrueckner (2016) suggests that premise B begs the question, since its\ntruth requires the existence of trees as referents for his word\n‘tree’. So to know that B is true, he would have to know\nthat he is “a non-BIV in a world containing trees, rather than a\nBIV in a treeless vat world” (Brueckner 2016: 5). \nTo avoid this objection, Brueckner suggests the following modification\nof SA1 (2003: 158, 2016: 5): \nBrueckner claims that B* can be true even if there are no trees, so\nthat use of it here does not beg the question. \nHowever, given widely held direct reference views of proper names,\nindexicals, and natural kind terms, views that are strongly suggested\nby the work of Kripke (1972), Kaplan (1977 [1989]), and Putnam (1975),\nit is not obvious that the existential commitments of sentences\ncontaining such terms can be removed by merely conditionalizing or\n‘hedging’ the sentences. (For a useful discussion of\nhedging see Yeakel 2016.) \n‘Tree’ is a natural kind term. As such, it is plausible to\nsuppose that this term’s primary semantic function is that of\npredicating membership in the kind T to which all trees belong. But\nsuppose that there is no such kind T. In this case, the general term\n‘tree’ would have no semantic value, since there simply\nwould be no such property as that of belonging to T. As a consequence,\nBrueckner’s premise B* would express no proposition and would\nhave no truth value, since the term ‘tree’ would make no\nsemantic contribution to what is said by B*. Thus, in order for\npremise B* to express a truth, there must be a natural kind T to which\nall trees belong, and so Brueckner’s claim that B* can be true\neven if there are no trees seems doubtful. \nWe should again note that use of premise (A*) begs the question for\nthe same reason that was pointed out by Hale (2000) regarding\nWright’s (1992) reconstruction. \nSo far, all of the reconstructions of Putnam’s anti-skeptical\nargument that we have considered have involved, in various ways, the\nuse of disquotation. But one remaining type of reconstruction does not\ninvolve the use of disquotation at all. (A major advantage, some might\nsay.) Rather, these arguments depend on the thesis that one can know\na priori that one’s thoughts have a given content, even\nwhen that content has an externalist semantics. Arguments of this sort\nhave the following form: \nArguments of this form have been discussed and defended by Tymoczko\n1989, Warfield 1998, and Brueckner 2003, 2005, 2016. I will rely on\nWarfield’s argument of form (F), which is: \n(Warfield explains that an “otherwise empty world” is\n“a world containing only the brain in a vat and whatever is\nnecessary to sustain the brain in a vat” (1998: 77).) \nWarfield suggests that one major advantage of his argument (W) is that\nit appears to avoid the charge of question-begging that (as\nwe’ve seen) is so often made against other forms of Putnamian\nanti-skeptical argument. (A similar motivation is also suggested by\nBrueckner 2016: 5.) This is because, Warfield says, he can justify a\nclaim to have a priori knowledge of both of the\nargument’s premises: premise 2 on the basis of externalist\nthought experiments by Putnam and others; premise 1 by virtue of the\nprinciple that one can always have a priori knowledge of the\ncontents of one’s thoughts (pp. 78, 80). \nBy ‘a priori knowledge’ Warfield means knowledge\nthat is obtained without either perceptual observation or empirical\ninvestigation (1998: 80; see also McKinsey 1991). Warfield’s\nview then is that one can always have privileged a priori\nknowledge of the propositional contents of one’s thoughts (the\ntraditional principle of privileged access), even when these contents\nare external or wide, in the sense that having a thought with\nthat content logically implies the existence of particular\nobjects or substances that are external to the agent (see the useful\nentry by Gertler 2017 on\n self-knowledge). \nThus Warfield’s attempt to defend the claim that he has a\npriori knowledge of both premises of his anti-skeptical argument\ncommits him to a view that we will call content\ncompatibilism, the view that having privileged access to the\ncontents of one’s thoughts is consistent with some of those\ncontents being externalist, or wide. Other proposals of anti-skeptical\narguments of the form (F), such as those by Tymoczko and Brueckner,\nalso commit their defenders to content compatibilism. \nBut content compatibilism is a controversial view. Some have\ncomplained that it implies that we can have a priori\nknowledge of far too many things (see McKinsey 1991 and 2002).\nConsider for instance the case of Garrison, who thinks that Donald is\nclueless, so that the following thought ascription is true: \nOn the direct reference view of names, (G) ascribes to Garrison a\nthought that has as its wide content the singular proposition that\nDonald is clueless. This content is wide in the sense that (with the\nexception of Donald) anyone’s having a thought with this content\nlogically implies the existence of things or substances that are\nexternal to that person. In this case of course, the relevant external\nobject or substance is Donald. \nNow given the principle of privileged access, Garrison can know a\npriori that he thinks that Donald is clueless. But as we’ve\njust seen, it is a logical consequence of Garrison’s having this\nthought that Donald exists. Hence, Garrison can merely deduce\nthat Donald exists from something he knows a priori, and thus\nhe can know a priori that Donald exists. But this consequence\nis absurd. Surely no one can know that any given other person exists\nwithout perceptual observation or empirical investigation. (A similar\nargument can be given for thought contents expressed by use of\nindexical pronouns and natural kind terms.) \nI take this argument to be a reductio of content\ncompatibilism: one of these two principles, privileged access and\ncontent externalism, must be false. One who endorses content\nexternalism should I think endorse a restricted form of privileged\naccess on which we can have privileged access only to the\nnarrow contents of our thoughts (see McKinsey 2002). \nGiven content externalism, then, Warfield cannot have the desired\na priori knowledge of premise 1 (“I think that water is\nwet”). Does this mean that his use of premise 1 begs the\nquestion? Apparently so. Certainly, from a Putnamian point of view,\nthe question is begged. For on that point of view, one could not have\nwarrant for premise 1 unless one had warrant to believe that (unlike a\nBIV) one had satisfied the causal constraints on having the concept\nwater. Thus it would seem that—absent any a priori\nknowledge of premise 1—one could not have warrant to believe\npremise 1 unless one already had warrant to believe that one is a\nnon-BIV. (McLaughlin 2000 and Steup 2003 also contend that\nWarfield’s argument begs the question.) \nIt is doubtful whether Putnam’s causal constraint alone can be\nused to show, in a manner that does not beg the question, that any\narbitrary person is not a BIV. However, it is possible to show, using\nPutnam’s causal constraint, that the argument (SA) for\nskepticism mentioned above that uses both the BIV scenario and the\nclosure principle (CP) is, in a sense, self defeating. Here,\nrecall, is (SA): \nIn their arguments against skepticism, Putnam and his defenders have\nbeen mainly concerned with providing arguments against premise (3) of\n(SA). But in fact, Premise 1 of the skeptical argument itself may\nprovide the best reason for doubting Premise 3 of that argument. For\nconsider the following anti-skeptical argument (AS): \n(The inference from (1) to (2) here requires two additional, and I\nhope obvious, assumptions: (1a) Knowing a proposition requires having\nthe concepts necessary for thinking the proposition, and (1b) The\nconcept of a BIV is one by which the known proposition is\ngrasped.) \nOf course, the conclusion (4) of (AS) (“You are not a\nBIV”) does not imply that you know that you are not a\nBIV. However, note that all of the other anti-skeptical arguments\nconsidered so far also have this feature; they all have the conclusion\nthat the relevant agent is not a BIV. It is then inferred that the\nagent knows that she is not a brain in a vat by virtue of her\nhaving deduced the conclusion that she is not a BIV from premises that\nshe knows, always including assumed knowledge of the causal\nconstraint. \nIn this manner, any agent to whom the skeptical argument (SA) is\naddressed may also reason through the argument (AS) to the conclusion\nthat she is not a BIV and then to the further conclusion that\nshe knows that she is not a BIV, and hence that premise (3)\nof the skeptical argument is false. Thus in any such case, if the\nrelevant instance of premise (1) of (SA) is true, then the\ncorresponding instance of premise (3) will be false. Thus in any such\ncase, the skeptical argument will be shown to have at least one false\npremise, and the argument (relative to the addressed person) will have\nbeen refuted. \nNote that there can be no issue of question-begging in an\nanti-skeptical argument like this. First, it is not the person to whom\nthe skeptical argument is being addressed who is assuming premise (1)\nof both (SA) and (AS). Rather, it is the skeptic who is\nmaking that assumption. Second, the person being addressed can be\ntaken to be assuming premise (1) merely for the sake of\nconditional proof. That is, she can be taken to be arguing\nmerely for the conclusion that if premise (1) is true then\npremise (3) is false, so that at least one of argument (SA)’s\npremises is false. \nIt would seem, then, that Putnam’s causal constraint, if it is\nin fact true, can be used to refute the skeptical argument that is\nbased on both the BIV scenario and the closure principle (CP). \nWe have looked at a number of attempts to reconstruct a Putnamian\nanti-skeptical argument that uses Putnam’s causal constraint to\nrefute the skeptical argument that is based on both the brain-in-a-vat\nscenario and the closure principle (CP). Most of the anti-skeptical\narguments we looked at used the principle of disquotation in various\nways, and as a result, these arguments begged the question in similar\nways to Brueckner’s original reconstruction of Putnam’s\nargument. Some of these arguments begged the question in a different\nway, pointed out by Hale (2000). \nWe also looked at a class of anti-skeptical arguments that depend on\ncontent compatibilism, the view that one can have a priori\nknowledge of the contents of one’s thoughts, even when those\ncontents are logically wide. I suggested an argument against content\ncompatibilism, the falsity of which opens this style of anti-skeptical\nargument to the charge of question-begging. \nFinally, we saw that Putnam’s causal constraint, if true, does\nin fact raise a serious problem for skeptical arguments of the form\n(SA) that are based on both the BIV scenario and (CP). The problem is\nthat when the skeptical argument is applied to particular persons, the\ncausal constraint provides those persons with the grounds to show that\nthe skeptical argument when applied to them has at least one false\npremise.","contact.mail":"T.M.McKinsey@wayne.edu","contact.domain":"wayne.edu"}]
