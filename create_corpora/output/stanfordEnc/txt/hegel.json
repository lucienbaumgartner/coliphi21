Fichte and, at least in his early work, F.W.J.  von\nSchelling, Hegel (1770–1831) belongs to the period of German\nidealism in the decades following Kant. The most systematic of the\npost-Kantian idealists, Hegel attempted, throughout his published\nwritings as well as in his lectures, to elaborate a comprehensive and\nsystematic philosophy from a purportedly logical starting point. He is\nperhaps most well-known for his teleological account of history, an\naccount that was later taken over by Marx and “inverted”\ninto a materialist theory of an historical development culminating in\ncommunism. While idealist philosophies in Germany post-dated\nHegel (Beiser 2014), the movement commonly known as German idealism\neffectively ended with Hegel’s death. Certainly since the\nrevolutions in logical thought from the turn of the twentieth century,\nthe logical side of Hegel’s thought has been largely forgotten,\nalthough his political and social philosophy and theological views\nhave continued to find interest and support. Since the 1970s, however,\na degree of more general philosophical interest in Hegel’s\nsystematic thought and its logical basis has been revived.\n\nBorn in 1770 in Stuttgart, Hegel spent the years 1788–1793 as\na student in nearby Tübingen, studying first philosophy, and then\ntheology, and forming friendships with fellow students, the future\ngreat romantic poet Friedrich Hölderlin (1770–1843) and\nFriedrich von Schelling (1775–1854), who, like Hegel, would\nbecome one of the major figures of the German philosophical scene in\nthe first half of the nineteenth century. These friendships clearly\nhad a major influence on Hegel’s philosophical development, and\nfor a while the intellectual lives of the three were closely\nintertwined. After graduation Hegel worked as a tutor for families in Bern and\nthen Frankfurt, where he was reunited with Hölderlin. Until\naround 1800, Hegel devoted himself to developing his ideas on\nreligious and social themes, and seemed to have envisaged a future for\nhimself as a type of modernising and reforming educator, in the image\nof figures of the German Enlightenment such as Lessing and\nSchiller. Around the turn of the century, however, under the influence\nof Hölderlin and Schelling, his interests turned more to issues\narising from the critical philosophy initiated by\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) and developed by J.G. Fichte\n(1762–1814). In the 1790s the University of Jena had become a\ncenter for the development of critical philosophy due to the presence\nof K.L.  Reinhold (1757–1823) and then Fichte, who taught there\nfrom 1794 until his dismissal on the grounds of atheism at the end of\nthe decade.  By that time, Schelling, who had first been attracted to\nJena by the presence of Fichte, had become an established figure at\nthe university.  In 1801 Hegel moved to Jena to join Schelling, and in\nsame year published his first philosophical work, The Difference\nbetween Fichte’s and Schelling’s System of\nPhilosophy, in which he argued that Schelling had succeeded where\nFichte had failed in the project of systematizing and thereby\ncompleting Kant’s transcendental idealism. In 1802 and 1803\nHegel and Schelling worked closely together, editing the Critical\nJournal of Philosophy, and on the basis of this association Hegel\ncame to be dogged for many years by the reputation of being a\n“mere” follower of Schelling (who was five years his\njunior). By late 1806 Hegel had completed his first major work,\nthe Phenomenology of Spirit (published 1807), which showed a\ndivergence from his earlier, seemingly more Schellingian, approach.\nSchelling, who had left Jena in 1803, interpreted a barbed criticism\nin the Phenomenology’s preface as aimed at him, and\ntheir friendship abruptly ended. The occupation of Jena by\nNapoleon’s troops as Hegel was completing the manuscript restricted the activities of\nthe university and Hegel departed. Now without a university\nappointment he worked for a short time, apparently very successfully,\nas an editor of a newspaper in Bamberg, and then from 1808–1815\nas the headmaster and philosophy teacher at a gymnasium (high school)\nin Nuremberg. During his time at Nuremberg he married and started a\nfamily, and wrote and published his Science of Logic. In 1816\nhe managed to return to his university career by being appointed to a\nchair in philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, but shortly\nafter, in 1818, he was offered and took up the chair of philosophy at\nthe University of Berlin, the most prestigious position in the German\nphilosophical world. In 1817, while in Heidelberg he published\nthe Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences, a systematic\nwork in which an abbreviated version of the earlier Science of\nLogic (the Encyclopaedia Logic or Lesser\nLogic) was followed by the application of its principles to the\nphilosophy of nature and the philosophy of spirit. In 1821 in Berlin\nHegel published his major work in political philosophy, Elements\nof the Philosophy of Right, based on lectures given at Heidelberg\nbut ultimately grounded in the section of the Encyclopaedia\nPhilosophy of Spirit dealing with objective\nspirit. During the following ten years up to his death in 1831\nHegel enjoyed celebrity at Berlin, and published subsequent versions\nof the Encyclopaedia. After his death versions of his\nlectures on philosophy of history, philosophy of religion, aesthetics,\nand the history of philosophy were published. After Hegel’s death, Schelling, whose reputation had long\nsince been eclipsed by that of Hegel, was invited to take up the chair\nat Berlin, reputedly because the government of the day had wanted to\ncounter the influence that Hegelian philosophy had exerted on a\ngeneration of students. Since the early period of his collaboration\nwith Hegel, Schelling had become more religious in his philosophising\nand criticised the rationalism of Hegel’s\nphilosophy. During this time of Schelling’s tenure at Berlin,\nimportant forms of later critical reaction to Hegelian philosophy\ndeveloped. Hegel himself had been a supporter of progressive but\nnon-revolutionary politics, but his followers divided into factions\nbroadly groupable as those of the left,\nright and centre (Toews\n1985); from\nthe left, Karl Marx was to develop his own purported\nscientific approach to society and history which\nappropriated many Hegelian ideas into a materialistic\noutlook.  (Later, especially in reaction to orthodox Soviet versions\nof Marxism, many so-called Western Marxists re-incorporated\nfurther Hegelian elements back into their forms of Marxist\nphilosophy.) Many of Schelling’s own criticisms of Hegel’s\nrationalism found their way into subsequent\nexistentialist thought, especially via the\nwritings of Kierkegaard, who had attended Schelling’s\nlectures. Furthermore, the interpretation Schelling offered of Hegel\nduring these years itself helped to shape subsequent\ngenerations’ understanding of Hegel, contributing to the\northodox or traditional understanding of Hegel as a metaphysical thinker in the pre-Kantian\ndogmatic sense. In academic philosophy, Hegelian idealism had seemed to collapse\ndramatically after 1848 and the failure of the revolutionary movements\nof that year, but underwent a revival in both Great Britain and the\nUnited States in the last decades of the nineteenth century. In\nBritain, where philosophers such as T.H. Green and F.H. Bradley had\ndeveloped metaphysical ideas which they related back to Hegel’s\nthought, Hegel came to be one of the main targets of attack by the\nfounders of the emerging “analytic” movement, Bertrand\nRussell and G.E. Moore. For Russell, the revolutionary innovations in\nlogic starting in the last decades of the nineteenth century with the\nwork of Frege and Peano had destroyed Hegel’s metaphysics by\noverturning the Aristotelian logic on which, so Russell claimed, it\nwas based, and in line with this dismissal, Hegel came to be seen\nwithin the analytic movement as an historical figure of little genuine\nphilosophical interest. To some degree, analogous things could be said\nof Hegel’s reception from within the twentieth-century\nphenomenological tradition that developed in continental Europe, but\nalthough marginalized within such core areas of mainstream academic\nphilosophy, Hegel nevertheless continued to be a figure of interest\nwithin other philosophical movements such as existentialism and\nMarxism. In France, a version of Hegelianism came to influence a\ngeneration of thinkers, including Jean Hyppolite, Jean-Paul Sartre and\nthe psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, largely through the lectures of\nAlexandre Kojève. However, a later generation of French\nphilosophers coming to prominence in the 1960s tended to react against\nHegel in ways analogous to those in which early analytic philosophers\nhad reacted against the Hegel who had influenced their\npredecessors. In Germany, having lapsed in the second half of the\nnineteenth century, interest in Hegel was revived at the turn of the\ntwentieth with the historical work of Wilhelm Dilthey, and important\nHegelian elements were incorporated within the approaches of thinkers\nof the Frankfurt School, such as Theodor Adorno, and later,\nJürgen Habermas, as well as within the Heidegger-influenced\nhermeneutic approach of H.-G. Gadamer. In Hungary,\nsimilar Hegelian themes were developed by Georg Lukács and\nlater thinkers of the Budapest School. In the 1960s the\nGerman philosopher Klaus Hartmann developed what was termed a\nnon-metaphysical interpretation of Hegel which, together\nwith the work of Dieter Henrich and others, played an important role\nin the revival of interest in Hegel in academic philosophy in the\nsecond half of the century. Within English-speaking philosophy, the\nfinal quarter of the twentieth century saw something of a revival of\nserious interest in Hegel’s philosophy with important works\nappearing such as those by H.S. Harris, Charles Taylor, Robert Pippin\nand Terry Pinkard in North America, and Stephen Houlgate and Robert\nStern in Great Britain. By the close of the twentieth century, even\nwithin core logico-metaphysical areas of analytic philosophy, a number\nof individuals such as Robert Brandom and John McDowell had started to\ntake Hegel seriously as a significant modern philosopher, although\ngenerally within analytic circles a favorable reassessment of Hegel\nhas still a long way to go. Hegel’s own pithy account of the nature of philosophy given\nin the Preface to his Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight captures a characteristic tension in his philosophical\napproach and, in particular, in his approach to the nature and limits\nof human cognition. “Philosophy”, he says there, “is\nits own time comprehended in thoughts” (PR: 21). On the one hand we can clearly see in the phrase “its own\ntime” the suggestion of an historical or cultural\nconditionedness and variability which applies even to the highest form\nof human cognition, philosophy itself. The contents of philosophical\nknowledge, we might suspect, will come from the historically changing\ncontents of its cultural context. On the other, there is the hint of\nsuch contents being raised to some higher level,\npresumably higher than other levels of cognitive functioning such as\nthose based in everyday perceptual experience, for example, or those\ncharacteristic of other areas of culture such as art and\nreligion. This higher level takes the form of conceptually articulated\nthought, a type of cognition commonly taken as capable of\nhaving purportedly eternal contents (think of Plato and Frege, for\nexample, who both have the truths of mathematics in mind). In line\nwith such a conception, Hegel sometimes referred to the task of\nphilosophy as that of recognising the concept (Der\nBegriff) in the mere representations (Vorstellungen) of\neveryday life. This antithetical combination within human cognition of the\ntemporally-conditioned and the eternal, a combination which reflects a\nbroader conception of the human being as what Hegel describes\nelsewhere as a “finite-infinite”, (SL: 114) has led to\nHegel being regarded in different ways by different types of\nphilosophical readers.  For example, an historically-minded pragmatist\nlike Richard Rorty, distrustful of all claims or aspirations to the\nso-called God’s-eye view, could praise Hegel as a\nphilosopher who had introduced this historically reflective dimension\ninto philosophy (and set it on the characteristically\nromantic path which has predominated in modern\ncontinental philosophy) but who had unfortunately still remained\nbogged down in the remnants of the Platonistic idea of the search for\nahistorical truths (Rorty 1982).  Those adopting such an approach to\nHegel tend to have in mind the (relatively) young author of\nthe Phenomenology of Spirit and have tended to dismiss as\n“metaphysical” later and more systematic works like\nthe Science of Logic. In contrast, the British Hegelian\nmovement at the end of the nineteenth century tended to ignore\nthe Phenomenology and the more historicist dimensions of his\nthought, and found in Hegel a systematic metaphysician\nwhose Logic provided the basis for a definitive philosophical\nontology. This latter traditional metaphysical view of\nHegel dominated Hegel reception for most of the twentieth century, but\nfrom the 1980s came to be challenged by scholars who offered an\nalternative non-metaphysical, post-Kantian\nview. By “non-metaphysical” these thinkers had in\nmind metaphysics in the sense that Kant had been critical of, a point\nsometimes missed by critics. But in turn, this post-Kantian reading\nhas been challenged by a revised metaphysical view, critical\nof the purported over-assimilation of Hegel to Kant by the\npost-Kantians. In the revised metaphysical view, appeal is often made\nto Aristotelian or Spinozist conceptual realist features of\nHegel’s thought, as well as to features of recent analytic\nmetaphysics. Before surveying these competing views, however, something needs to\nbe said about the confusing term “idealism”, and about the\nvariety of idealism that is characteristic of Hegel and other German\nidealists. “Idealism” is a term that had been used sporadically by\nLeibniz and his followers to refer to a type of philosophy that was\nopposed to materialism. Thus, for example, Leibniz had\ncontrasted Plato as an idealist with Epicurus as a\nmaterialist. The opposition to materialism here, together with the\nfact that in the English-speaking world the Irish philosopher and\nclergyman George Berkeley (1685–1753) is often taken as a\nprototypical idealist, has given rise to the assumption that idealism\nis necessarily an immaterialist doctrine. This\nassumption, however, is mistaken. With the possible exception of\nLeibniz, the idealism of the Germans was not committed to the type of\ndoctrine found in Berkeley according to which immaterial minds, both\ninfinite (God’s) and finite (those of humans), were the\nultimately real entities, with apparently material things to\nbe understood as reducible to states of such minds—that\nis, to ideas in the sense meant by the British\nempiricists. As Leibniz’s use of Plato to exemplify idealism suggests,\nidealists in the German tradition tended to hold to the reality or\nobjectivity of ideas in the Platonic sense, and for Plato, it would\nseem, such ideas were not conceived as in any mind at\nall—not even the mind of Plato’s god. The type of\npicture found in Berkeley was only to be found in certain late antique\nPlatonists and, especially, early Christian Platonists like Saint\nAugustine, Bishop of Hippo. But especially for the German idealists\nlike Hegel, Plato’s philosophy was understood through the lenses\nof more Aristotelian varieties of neo-Platonism, which pictured the\nthoughts of a divine mind as immanent in\nmatter, and not as contained in some purely immaterial or spiritual\nmind. It thus had features closer to the more pantheistic picture of\ndivine thought found in Spinoza, for example, for whom matter and mind\nwere attributes of the one substance. Even for Leibniz, whose later monadological metaphysics was perhaps\ncloser to Berkeley’s immaterialist philosophy, an opposition to\nmaterialism didn’t necessarily imply immaterialism. Leibniz had\nresisted Descartes’ postulation of distinct spiritual and\nmaterial substances, treating corporeal bodies as inseparable\ncombinations of form and matter after the manner of Aristotle. The\nmaterialists to which he was opposed (mechanistic corpuscularists of\nhis time) conceived of unformed matter as a type of self-subsistent\nsubstance, and it seems to have been that conception to which\nhe was opposed, at least in some periods of his work, not the reality\nof matter per se. Leibniz’s combination of Platonic and\nAristotelian notions played a role in the thought of the later\nidealists, giving their opposition to materialism its distinctive\ncharacter. These anti-immaterialist features of the idealism of the\nGermans became more prominent in the post-Kantian period as they moved\nprogressively away from the more subjectivistic features of\nLeibniz’s thought (Beiser 2002). Given the understanding of Hegel that predominated at the time of\nthe birth of analytic philosophy, together with the fact that early\nanalytic philosophers were rebelling precisely against\nHegelianism so understood, the interpretation of Hegel\nencountered in discussions within analytic philosophy is often that of\nthe late nineteenth-century interpretation. In this picture, Hegel is\nseen as offering a metaphysico-religious view of God qua\nAbsolute Spirit, as the ultimate reality that we can\ncome to know through pure thought processes alone. In short,\nHegel’s philosophy is treated as exemplifying the type of\npre-critical or dogmatic metaphysics against which Kant\nhad reacted in his Critique of Pure Reason, and as a return\nto a more religiously driven conception of philosophy to which Kant\nhad been opposed. There is much that can be found in Hegel’s writings that\nseems to support this view. In his lectures during his Berlin period\none comes across claims such as the one that philosophy “has no\nother object but God and so is essentially rational theology”\n(Aes I: 101). Indeed, Hegel often seems to invoke imagery consistent\nwith the types of neo-Platonic conceptions of the universe that had\nbeen common within Christian mysticism, especially in the German\nstates, in the early modern period. The peculiarity of Hegel’s\nform of idealism, on this account, lies in his idea that the mind of\nGod becomes actual only via its particularization in the minds of\n“his” finite material creatures. Thus, in our\nconsciousness of God, we somehow serve to realize his own\nself-consciousness, and, thereby, his own perfection. In\nEnglish-language interpretations, such a picture is effectively found\nin the work of Charles Taylor (1975) and Michael Rosen\n(1984), for example. With\nits dark mystical roots, and its overtly religious content, it is\nhardly surprising that the philosophy of Hegel so understood has\nrarely been regarded as a live option within the largely\nsecular and scientific conceptions of philosophy that\nhave been dominant in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. An important consequence of Hegel’s metaphysics, so\nunderstood, concerns history and the idea of historical development or\nprogress, and it is as an advocate of an idea concerning the\nlogically-necessitated teleological course of history that Hegel is\nmost often derided. To critics, such as Karl Popper in his popular\npost-war The Open Society and its\nEnemies (1945), Hegel had not only advocated a disastrous political\nconception of the state and the relation of its citizens to it, a\nconception prefiguring twentieth-century totalitarianism, but he had\nalso tried to underpin such advocacy with dubious\ntheo-logico-metaphysical speculations. With his idea of the\ndevelopment of spirit in history, Hegel is seen as\nliteralising a way of talking about different cultures in terms of\ntheir spirits, of constructing a developmental sequence\nof epochs typical of nineteenth-century ideas of linear historical\nprogress, and then enveloping this story of human progress in terms of\none about the developing self-conscious of the cosmos-God itself. As the bottom line of such an account concerned the evolution of\nstates of a mind (God’s), such an account is clearly an idealist\none, but not in the sense, say, of Berkeley. The pantheistic legacy\ninherited by Hegel meant that he had no problem in considering an\nobjective outer world beyond any particular subjective mind.\nBut this objective world itself had to be understood as conceptually\ninformed: it was objectified spirit. Thus in contrast to\nBerkeleian subjective idealism it became common to talk\nof Hegel as incorporating the objective idealism of\nviews, especially common among German historians, in which social life\nand thought were understood in terms of the conceptual or\nspiritual structures that informed them. But in contrast\nto both forms of idealism, Hegel, according to this reading,\npostulated a form of absolute idealism by including both\nsubjective life and the objective cultural practices on which\nsubjective life depended within the dynamics of the development of the\nself-consciousness and self-actualisation of God, the Absolute\nSpirit. Despite this seemingly dominant theological theme, Hegel was still\nseen by many as an important precursor of other more\ncharacteristically secular strands of modern thought such as\nexistentialism and Marxist materialism. Existentialists were thought\nof as taking the idea of the finitude and historical and cultural\ndependence of individual subjects from Hegel, and as leaving out all\npretensions to the Absolute, while Marxists were thought\nof as taking the historical dynamics of the Hegelian picture but\nreinterpreting this in materialist rather than idealist categories. As\nfor understanding Hegel himself, the traditional metaphysical view\nremained the dominant interpretative approach of Hegel scholars\nthroughout much of the twentieth century. In the last quarter of the\ncentury, however, it came to be vigorously questioned, with a variety\nof interpreters putting forward very different accounts of the basic\nnature of Hegel’s philosophical project. While a number of\ninterpretations of Hegel have emerged during this period in an effort\nto acquit him of implausible metaphysico-theological views, one\nprominent tendency has been to stress the continuity of his ideas with\nthe “critical philosophy” of Immanuel Kant. Least controversially, it is often claimed that either\nparticular works, such as the Phenomenology of\nSpirit, or particular areas of Hegel’s philosophy,\nespecially his ethical and political philosophy, can be understood as\nstanding independently of the type of unacceptable metaphysical system\nsketched above. Thus it is commonly asserted that implicit within the\nmetaphysical Hegel is an anti-metaphysical philosopher struggling to\nget out—one potentially capable of beating the critical Kant at\nhis own game. More controversially, one now finds it argued that the traditional\npicture is simply wrong at a more general level, and that Hegel, even\nin his systematic thought, was not committed to the bizarre,\nteleological spirit monism that has been traditionally\nattributed to him because he was free of the type of traditional\nmetaphysical commitments that had been criticized by Kant. Prominent\namong such interpretations has been the so-called\npost-Kantian interpretation advanced by North American\nHegel scholars Robert Pippin (1989, 2008, 2019) and Terry Pinkard\n(1994, 2000, 2012). From an explicitly analytic perspective, broadly\nsimilar views have been put forward by Robert Brandom (2002, 2014,\n2019) and John McDowell (2006, 2018). Thus while the traditional view sees\nHegel as exemplifying the very type of metaphysical speculation that\nKant successfully criticised, the post-Kantian view regards him as\nboth accepting and extending Kant’s critique,\nultimately turning it against the residual dogmatically\nmetaphysical aspects of Kant’s own philosophy. In Hegel, the non-traditionalists argue, one can see the ambition\nto bring together the universalist dimensions of Kant’s\ntranscendental program with the culturally contextualist conceptions\nof his more historically and relativistically-minded contemporaries,\nresulting in his controversial conception of spirit, as\ndeveloped in his Phenomenology of Spirit. With this notion,\nit is claimed, Hegel was essentially attempting to answer the Kantian\nquestion of the conditions of rational human mindedness,\nrather than being concerned with giving an account of the developing\nself-consciousness of God. But while Kant had limited such conditions\nto formal abstractly conceived structures of the mind,\nHegel extended them to include aspects of historically and socially\ndetermined forms of embodied human existence. Not surprisingly, the strong post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel\nhas been resisted by defenders of the more traditional approach, who\nhave argued against the plausibility of attempting to rehabilitate\nHegel’s philosophy by divesting it of any purportedly\nunacceptable metaphysical claims (see, for example, Beiser 2005 and\nHorstmann 2006).  Proponents of the post-Kantian view, it is commonly\nsaid, are guilty of projecting onto Hegel views they\nwould like to find there rather than what is actually to be\nfound. However, the strong post-Kantian interpretation\nhas also been challenged by a somewhat different version of\nthe metaphysical reading by interpreters who, while recognizing the\ninfluence of Kant’s critical philosophy of Hegel, emphasize\nHegel’s critique of Kant and affirm the irreducible role played\nby a form of metaphysics in Hegel’s philosophy.  Nevertheless,\nthey share the post-Kantians’ attempts to separate Hegel’s\nviews from the extravagant views traditionally ascribed\nto him and generally argue for the broad acceptability of\nHegel’s views from the perspective of the present. Here one\ntends to find interpreters attributing to Hegel some type of\nconceptual realism, sometimes appealing to\ncontemporary analytic metaphysics for the legitimacy of\nmetaphysics conceived as inquiry into the fundamental\nfeatures or structures of the world\nitself. Among the interpreters advancing something like this\nrevised metaphysical view might be counted Stephen\nHoulgate (2005b), Robert\nStern (2002, 2009), Kenneth Westphal\n(2003), James Kreines\n(2006, 2008) and Christopher Yeomans (2012). On a number of points, the proponents of the revised conceptual\nrealist metaphysical interpretation will agree with advocates of the\npost-Kantian non-metaphysical approach. First, they tend\nto agree in dismissing much of the extravagant\nmetaphysics traditionally ascribed to Hegel. Generally they\ndon’t find in Hegel the type of classical teleological spirit\nmonism central to, say, Taylor’s interpretation. Next, they\nstress the importance for Hegel of Kant’s critique of\nmetaphysics. Both think that Hegel took Kant’s critique\nseriously, and in turn subjected that critique itself to a\ntelling meta-critique, showing that Kant himself was not free\nfrom the sorts of ungrounded metaphysical assumptions he criticized in\nothers. However, while the post-Kantians interpret Hegel’s\ncriticisms of Kant as suggesting that Hegel thereby realized or\ncompleted Kant’s critical intention, creating a\nform of philosophizing purged of metaphysics, proponents of the\nrevised metaphysical interpretation typically see his criticism of\nKant as involving a rejection of Kant’s anti-metaphysical\nattitude, and as reestablishing, on a new basis, a metaphysical\nprogram originally derived from Aristotle (e.g., Stern) or Spinoza\n(e.g., Houlgate). While it is for the most part clear what sets both post-Kantians\nand conceptual realists against the traditional view, it is still not\nclear which issues dividing them are substantive and which are\nultimately verbal. Brandom, for example, while often classed with the\npost-Kantians, also construes Hegel as a conceptual realist (Brandom\n2019), while Redding, appealing to the earlier work of J. N. Findlay,\nattempts to combine the post-Kantian approach with what he calls\nan actualist rather than a realist interpretation of Hegel\n(Redding 2017). In recent work, both Pippin (2019) and Pinkard (2014),\nthe major representatives of the post-Kantian position, have insisted\nthat their own interpretations are compatible with many of the\nAristotelian features of Hegel to which conceptual realists allude.\n\n In relation to such debates it must be remembered that Kant himself\nwas not critical of metaphysics per se. His claim was that\nexisting (so-called dogmatic) metaphysics was in a state analogous to\nthat in which, say, physics had been in before the scientific\nrevolution of sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Rather than wanting\nto eliminate metaphysics, after the style, say, of Hume or the modern\nlogical positivists, Kant had wanted to put metaphysics itself on a\nsecure scientific basis analogous to what Galileo and Newton had\nachieved for physics. Thus the very idea of an\nHegelian metaphysics is in no way straightforwardly\nincompatible with the project of a post-Kantian\ncompletion of Kant’s critical program. \n\n We may think of there being five different types of work that make\nup Hegel’s published corpus. First, there are Hegel’s two\nmajor stand-alone books written for publication already\nmentioned—Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\nand Science of Logic (1812–18). In the next category\nare works that were published at the time as handbooks for\nuse in student teaching such as the Encyclopaedia of Philosophical\nSciences first published in 1817 while he was teaching at\nHeidelberg and subsequently revised and republished in 1827 and again\nin 1830, and Elements of the Philosophy of Right, effectively\nan expansion of a section of the Encyclopaedia and published\nin 1820 after his move to Berlin. (Transcripts of his earlier lectures\non this topic delivered in Heidelberg have also since been published.)\nAlong with the Encyclopaedia and the Philosophy of\nRight might be added similar teaching-related writings from the\nJena period, prepared as lectures but only published as such much\nlater. The third major category is formed by posthumously published\nlecture courses from his time at the University of Berlin, which,\nafter Hegel’s death, were assembled by editors from his lecture\nnotes and from student transcripts of the lectures as\ndelivered—these include his lectures on the Philosophy\nof Nature, Philosophy of Spirit, Philosophy of\nHistory, Aesthetics, Philosophy of Religion,\nand History of Philosophy.  Next might be considered various\nmiscellaneous essays and short works published during his career, and\nfinally we can count Hegel’s early works, written in the period\nbetween his student years at Tübingen and his move to Jena, and\npredominantly on religious and political themes\n(ETW). Here we will restrict the discussion to the first three\ncategories. The term “phenomenology” had been coined by the Swiss\nmathematician (and Kant correspondent) J.H. Lambert (1728–1777)\nin his The New Organon of 1764, and in a letter to Lambert,\nsent to accompany a copy of his Inaugural Dissertation\n(1770), Kant had proposed his own project of a “general\nphenomenology” as a necessary propaedeutic\npresupposed by the science of metaphysics. Such a phenomenology was\nmeant to determine the “validity and limitations” of what\nhe called the “principles of sensibility”, principles he\nhad (he thought) shown in the accompanying work to be importantly\ndifferent to those of conceptual thought. The term clearly suited Kant\nas he had distinguished the phenomena known through the\nfaculty of sensibility from the noumena known purely\nconceptually. This envisioned phenomenology seems to coincide roughly\nwith what he was to eventually describe as a critique of pure\nreason, although Kant’s thought had gone through\nimportant changes by the time that he came to publish the work of that\nname (1781, second edition 1787). Perhaps because of this he never\nagain used the term “phenomenology” for quite this\npurpose. There is clearly some continuity between Kant’s notion and\nHegel’s project. In a sense Hegel’s phenomenology is a\nstudy of phenomena (although this is not a realm he\nwould contrast with that of noumena) and\nHegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit is likewise to be\nregarded as a type of propaedeutic to philosophy rather\nthan an exercise in or work of philosophy. It is\nmeant to function as an induction or education of the reader to\nthe standpoint of purely conceptual thought from which\nphilosophy can be done. As such, its structure has been compared to\nthat of a Bildungsroman (educational novel), having an\nabstractly conceived protagonist—the bearer of an evolving\nseries of so-called shapes of consciousness or the inhabitant of a\nseries of successive phenomenal worlds—whose progress and\nset-backs the reader follows and learns from. Or at least this is how\nthe work sets out: in the later sections the earlier series of\nshapes of consciousness becomes replaced with what seem\nmore like configurations of human social life, and the work\ncomes to look more like an account of interlinked forms of social\nexistence and thought within which participants in such forms of\nsocial life conceive of themselves and the world. Hegel constructs a\nseries of such shapes that maps onto the history of western European\ncivilization from the Greeks to his own time. The fact that this progression ends in the attainment of what Hegel\nrefers to as Absolute Knowing, the standpoint from which\nreal philosophy gets done, seems to support the traditionalist reading\nin which a triumphalist narrative of the growth of western\ncivilization is combined with the theological interpretation of\nGod’s self-manifestation and self-comprehension. When Kant had\nbroached the idea of a phenomenological propaedeutic to Lambert, he\nhimself had still believed in the project of a purely conceptual\nmetaphysics achievable by the use of the regressive or\nanalytic method, but this project conceived as an\nexercise in theoretical reason was just what Kant in his later\ncritical philosophy had come to disavow. Traditional readers of Hegel\nthus see the Phenomenology’s telos as\nattesting to Hegel’s pre-Kantian (that is, pre-critical)\noutlook, and his embrace of the metaphysical project that Kant\nfamously came to dismiss as illusory.  Supporters of\nthe post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel obviously interpret\nthis work and its telos differently. For example, it has been\nargued (e.g., Pinkard 1994) that what this history tracks is the\ndevelopment of a type of social existence which enables a unique form\nof rationality, in that in such a society all dogmatic bases of\nthought have been gradually replaced by a system in which all claims\nbecome open to rational self-correction, by becoming exposed to\ndemands for conceptually-articulated justifications. As Pinkard had\npointed out in that work, this was a conception of the normatively\nstructured practices of human reason found in the American pragmatist\nWilfrid Sellars, the inspiration behind the Hegelian dimensions of\nanalytic philosophers such as Willem deVries (1988), Robert Brandom\nand John McDowell. Something of Hegel’s phenomenological method may be conveyed\nby the first few chapters, which are perhaps among its more\nconventionally philosophical parts (Westphal 2009). Chapters 1 to 3\neffectively follow a developmental series of distinct shapes of\nconsciousness—jointly epistemological and ontological\nattitudes articulated by criteria which are, regarded from one\ndirection, criteria for certain knowledge, and from the\nother, criteria for the nature of the objects of such\nknowledge. In chapter 1, the attitude of Sense-certainty\ntakes immediately given perceptual simples—the sort of role\nplayed by the so-called sense-data of early\ntwentieth-century analytic epistemology, for example, with which a\nsubject is purportedly acquainted as bare thises—as the\nfundamental objects known. By following this form of\nconsciousness’s attempts to make these implicit\ncriteria explicit, we are meant to appreciate that any such\ncontents, even the apparently most immediate ones, are\nin fact grasped conceptually, and so, in Hegel’s\nterminology, their reception is actually mediated by the\nconcepts with which they are grasped. Hegel is clear that these\ncontents are not merely qualitative simples that are\nimmediately apprehended, but comprehended instances\nof the conceptual determination of singularity\n[Einzelheit] (Phen: §91). Such a simple\nthis, then, can also be understood as an instance of\nwhat the Medievals discussed as thisness—a\ngeneral property of an individual thing’s being\nidentical to itself. One might compare Hegel’s point here to\nthat expressed by Kant in his well known claim from Critique of\nPure Reason (A51/B75), that without general\nconcepts, intuitions (singular [einzeln] purportedly\nimmediate mental representations), are blind. However,\nHegel seems to want to make this point without relying on\nKant’s formal distinction between concepts and\nintuitions as different species of representation. The idea seems to\nbe that for Hegel, the same content can play the roles played\nby both concepts and intuitions in Kant. (The lessons of this chapter\nhave sometimes been likened to those of Wilfrid Sellars’s famous\ncriticism of the empiricist myth of the given.) By the end of this chapter our protagonist consciousness (and by\nimplication, we the audience to this drama) has learnt that the nature\nof consciousness cannot be as originally thought: rather than being\nimmediate and singular, its contents must have some implicit universal\n(conceptual) aspect to them. The general truth that was\nlearned about the apparent qualitative simples in Sense-certainty\n(that they were instances of generals) is now explicitly taken as\nthe truth of the object of Perception\n(Wahrnehmung—in German this term having the\nconnotations of taking (nehmen) to be true\n(wahr)). In contrast to the purported single object of\nSense-certainty the object of Perception is taken as\ninstantiating general properties: it is “a thing with many\nproperties” (Phen: §112). But this can be conceived in a\nvariety of ways: first, as a simple bundle of indifferent\nqualities (a picture associated with Plato), or as an underlying\nsubstrate in which these qualities somehow inhere (a picture\nassociated with Aristotle). Predictably, problems will be revealed in\nthese various different ways of thinking of the nature of those\neveryday objects of our experience. As in the case of Sense-certainty, here in the case of Perception,\nby following the protagonist consciousness’s efforts to make\nthis implicit criterion explicit, we see how the criterion generates\ncontradictions that eventually undermine it as a criterion\nfor certainty. In fact, such collapse into a type of self-generated\nskepticism is typical of all the shapes we follow in the\nwork, and there seems something inherently skeptical about such\nreflexive cognitive processes. But this is not the type of skepticism\nthat is typical of early modern philosophy, such as that used by\nDescartes in his attempt to find some foundation\nof indubitability on which genuine knowledge can be built\n(Forster 1989). As is clear from his treatment of ancient philosophy\nin the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel was\nattracted to the type of dialectic employed by Socrates in\nhis efforts to get his interlocutors thinking about something beyond\nthat given immediately in sensation (LHP II: 51), and implicit in the\nancient form of skepticism that had been employed after Socrates (LHP\nII: 344). For Hegel, the ancient skeptics captured the skeptical\nmoment of thought that is the means by which thought\nprogresses beyond the particular categories that have given\nrise to contradictions. Just as in the way a new shape of\nthought, Perception, had been generated from the internal\ncontradictions that emerged within Sense-certainty, the\ncollapse of any given attitude will be accompanied by the emergence of\nsome new implicit criterion that will be the basis of a new emergent\nattitude. In the case of Perception, the emergent new shape of\nconsciousness, the Understanding, explored in Chapter 3,\nis a shape identified with the type of scientific cognition that,\nrather than remaining on the level of the perceived object, posits\nunderlying forces involved in the production of the\nperceptual episode. The transition from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4, The Truth of\nSelf-Certainty, also marks a more general transition from\nConsciousness to Self-consciousness. It is in the course of\nChapter 4 that we find what is perhaps the most well-known part of\nthe Phenomenology, the account of the struggle of\nrecognition in which Hegel examines the inter-subjective\nconditions which he sees as necessary for any form of consciousness.\nThis is a topic that had first been taken up by Alexandre\nKojève (1969), and which has been appealed to in\nnon-Kojèvean ways recently by a number of non-traditional\ninterpreters in order to give a quite different accounts of\nHegel’s notion of Spirit (Honneth 1995; Ikäheimo\nand Laitinen 2011; Pippin 2008; Williams\n1992, 1997). Like Kant, Hegel thinks that one’s capacity to\nbe conscious of some external object as something distinct\nfrom oneself requires the reflexivity of self-consciousness,\nthat is, it requires one’s awareness of oneself as a\nsubject for whom something distinct, the object, is\npresented as known (a result emerging in Chapter 3). Hegel\ngoes beyond Kant, however, and expanding on an idea found in Fichte,\nmakes this requirement dependent on one’s recognition (or\nacknowledgment—Anerkennung) of other\nself-conscious subjects as self-conscious subjects for\nwhom any object of consciousness will be thought\nas also existing. One’s self-consciousness, in fact,\nwill be dependent on one’s recognition of those others as\nsimilarly recognizing oneself as a self-conscious\nsubject. Such complex patterns of mutual recognition constituting\nobjective spirit thereby provide the social matrix\nwithin which individual self-consciousnesses can exist as such. It is\nin this way that the Phenomenology can change course, the\nearlier tracking of shapes of individual consciousness and\nself-consciousness effectively coming to be replaced by the tracking\nof distinct patterns of mutual recognition between\nsubjects—shapes of spirit—that forms the\nground for the existence of those individual\nconsciousnesses/self-consciousnesses. It is thus that Hegel has effected the transition from a\nphenomenology of the individual’s subjective mind to one\nof objective spirit, thought of as culturally distinct\nobjective patterns of social interaction to be analysed in terms of\nthe patterns of reciprocal recognition they\nembody. (“Geist” can be translated as either\n“mind” or “spirit”, but the latter, allowing a\nmore cultural sense, as in the phrase “spirit of the age”\n(“Zeitgeist”), seems a more suitable rendering for the\ntitle.) But this is only worked out in the text\ngradually. We—the reading or so-called phenomenological\nwe—can see how particular shapes of self-consciousness, such as\nthat of the other-worldly religious self-consciousness (Unhappy\nConsciousness) with which Chapter 4 ends, depend on certain\ninstitutionalised forms of mutual recognition, in this case one\ninvolving a priest who mediates between the self-conscious subject and\nthat subject’s God. But we are seeing this “from the\noutside”, as it were: we still have to learn how actual\nself-consciousnesses could learn this of themselves. So we have to see\nhow the protagonist self-consciousness could achieve this insight. It\nis to this end that we further trace the learning path of\nself-consciousness through the processes of reason (in\nChapter 5) before objective spirit can become the explicit subject\nmatter of Chapter 6 (Spirit). Hegel’s discussion of spirit starts from what he calls\nSittlichkeit (translated as “ethical\norder” or “ethical\nsubstance”—“Sittlichkeit” being a\nnominalization from the adjectival (or adverbial) form\n“sittlich”, “customary”, from the\nstem “Sitte”, “custom” or\n“convention”.) Thus Hegel might be seen as adopting the\nviewpoint that since social life is ordered by customs we can approach\nthe lives of those living in it in terms of the patterns of those\ncustoms or conventions themselves—the conventional practices, as\nit were, constituting specific, shareable forms of life made\nactual in the lives of particular individuals who had in\nturn internalized such general patterns in the process of\nacculturation. It is not surprising then that his account of spirit\nhere starts with a discussion of religious and civic law. Undoubtedly\nit is Hegel’s tendency to nominalise such abstract concepts in\nhis attempt to capture the concrete nature of such patterns\nof conventional life, together with the tendency to\nthen personify them (as in talking about\nspirit becoming self-conscious) that lends plausibility to\nthe traditionalist understanding of Hegel. But for non-traditionalists\nit is not obvious that Hegel, in employing such phrases, is in any way\ncommitted to any metaphysical supra-individual conscious being or\nbeings. To take an example, in the second section of the chapter on\nspirit, Hegel discusses human culture as the\n“world of self-alienated spirit”. The idea seems to be\nthat humans in society not only interact, but that they collectively\ncreate relatively enduring cultural products (repeatable stories,\nstageable dramas, and so forth) within which members of that society\ncan recognise patterns of their own communal life as so reflected. We\nmight find intelligible the metaphor that such products “hold up a\nmirror to society” within which “the society can regard\nitself”, without thinking we are thereby committed to some\nsupra-individual unitary mind achieving\nself-consciousness. Furthermore, such cultural products\nthemselves provide conditions allowing individuals to adopt particular\ncognitive attitudes by appropriating their resources. Thus, for\nexample, the capacity to adopt the type of objective viewpoint\ndemanded by Kantian morality (discussed in the final section of\nSpirit)—the capacity to see things, as it were, from a detached\nor universal point of view—might be enabled by\nengaging with spirit’s “alienations” such as the\nmyths and rituals of a religion professing a universal scope. We might think that if Kant had written\nHegel’s Phenomenology he would have ended it at Chapter\n6 with the modern moral subject as the telos of the\nstory. For Kant, the practical knowledge of morality, orienting one\nwithin the noumenal world, exceeds the scope of theoretical knowledge,\nwhich had been limited to phenomena. Hegel, however, thought that\nphilosophy had to unify theoretical and practical knowledge, and so\nthe Phenomenology has further to go. Again, this is seen\ndifferently by traditionalists and revisionists. For traditionalists,\nChapters 7, Religion and 8, Absolute\nKnowing, testify to Hegel’s disregard for Kant’s\ncritical limitation of theoretical knowledge to empirical\nexperience. Revisionists, on the other hand, tend to see Hegel as\nfurthering the Kantian critique into the very coherence of a\nconception of an in-itself reality that is beyond the\nlimits of our theoretical (but not practical) cognition.  Rather than\nunderstand absolute knowing as the achievement of some\nultimate God’s-eye view of everything, the\nphilosophical analogue to the connection with God sought in religion,\npost-Kantian revisionists see it as the accession to a mode of\nself-critical thought that has finally abandoned all non-questionable\nmythical givens, and which will only countenance\nreason-giving argument as justification. However we understand this,\nabsolute knowing is the standpoint to which Hegel has hoped to bring\nthe reader in this complex work. This is the standpoint of\nscience, the standpoint from which philosophy proper commences,\nand it commences in Hegel’s next book, the Science of\nLogic. Hegel’s Science of Logic is divided into three\nbooks, dealing with the topics of\nbeing, essence, and the concept, which appeared\nin 1812, 1813, and 1816 respectively. For most of the 20th\ncentury it was not received with the enthusiasm that often marked the\nreception of Phenomenology of Spirit. First, as a work\nof logic most have regarded it as radically outdated and\nrelying on an Aristotelian approach that was definitively surpassed in\nthe later nineteenth century—a view promoted especially by\nBertrand Russell in the early years of the twentieth. Thus many\nreaders sympathetic to particular doctrines in Hegel have attempted,\ncontrary to Hegel’s insistence, to quarantine his philosophical\napproach to particular areas from it. Recently, this skepticism has\nstarted to change. Some advocate that the Science of Logic be read as a\nfirst-order ontological doctrine (Doz 1987) or as a category\ntheory that simultaneously represents structures of being and\nthought (Houlgate 2005b), and so as having very little to do with what\nhas traditionally been known as logic. Others argue that\nin contrast to the project of formal (or general) logic,\nit is best understood as a version of what Kant had called\n“transcendental logic” (di Giovanni 2010). In this sense\nit should thereby be thought of as a successor to Kant’s\n“transcendental deduction of the categories” in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason in which Kant attempted to\nderive a list of those non-empirical concepts, the\ncategories, which he believed to be presupposed by all\nempirical judgments made by finite, discursive knowers like ourselves.\nIn short, taking the logic as a category theory opens up two\ngeneral lines of interpretation: should the categories be understood\nas primarily ontological categories, as found in Aristotle,\nor as primarily categories revealing the necessary structure\nof thought, as in Kant? Those, such as the advocates of the\nrevised metaphysical interpretation, interpreting Hegel\nas basically a metaphysician, typically stress the former, while\npost-Kantian interpreters typically stress the\nlatter. A glance at the table of contents of Science of Logic\nreveals the same triadic structuring among the categories or\nthought determinations discussed that has been noted\namong the shapes of consciousness in\nthe Phenomenology. At the highest level of its branching\nstructure there are the three books devoted to the doctrines of\nbeing, essence, and concept,\nwhile in turn, each book has three sections, each section containing\nthree chapters, and so on. In general, each of these individual nodes\ndeals with some particular category. In fact, Hegel’s categorial\ntriads appear to repeat Kant’s own triadic way of\narticulating the categories in the Table of Categories\n(Critique of Pure Reason A80/B106) in which the third term in\nthe triad in some way integrates the first two. (In Hegel’s\nterminology, he would say that the first two were\nsublated [aufgehoben] in the third—while\nthe first two are negated by the third, they continue to work\nwithin the context defined by it.) Hegel’s later treatment\nof the syllogism found in Book 3, in which he follows\nAristotle’s own three-termed schematism of the syllogistic\nstructure, repeats this triadic structure as does his ultimate\nanalysis of its component concepts as the moments of\nuniversality, particularity, and\nsingularity. Reading into the first chapter of Book 1, Being, it\nis quickly seen that the transitions of the Logic\nbroadly repeat those of the first chapters of\nthe Phenomenology, now, however, as between the categories\nthemselves rather than between conceptions of the\nrespective objects of conscious experience. Thus,\nbeing is the thought determination with which the work\ncommences because it at first seems to be the most\nimmediate, fundamental determination that characterises\nany possible thought content at all. (In contrast, being in\nthe Phenomenology’s Sense-certainty chapter\nwas described as the known truth of the purported immediate\nsensory given—the category that it was discovered to\ninstantiate.)  Whatever thought is about, that topic must in some\nsense exist. Like those purported simple sensory\ngivens with which the Phenomenology starts, the\ncategory being looks to have no internal structure or\nconstituents, but again in a parallel to the Phenomenology,\nit is the effort of thought to make this category explicit that both\nundermines it and brings about new ones. Being seems to\nbe both immediate and simple, but it will show itself to be,\nin fact, only something in opposition to something else,\nnothing. The point seems to be that while the categories\nbeing and nothing seem both absolutely\ndistinct and opposed, on reflection (and following Leibniz’s\nprinciple of the identity of indiscernibles) they appear identical as\nno criterion can be invoked which differentiates them. The only way\nout of this paradox is to posit a third category within which they can\ncoexist as negated (Aufgehoben) moments. This\ncategory is becoming, which saves thinking from\nparalysis because it accommodates both\nconcepts. Becoming contains being and\nnothing in the sense that when something\nbecomes it passes, as it were, from nothingness to\nbeing. But these contents cannot be understood apart\nfrom their contributions to the overarching category: this is what it\nis to be negated (aufgehoben) within the new category. In general this is how the Logic proceeds: seeking its\nmost basic and universal determination, thought posits a category to\nbe reflected upon, finds then that this collapses due to a\ncontradiction generated, like that generated by the\ncategory being, and so then seeks a further category with which to\nmake retrospective senses of those contradictory categories. However,\nin turn the new category will generate some further contradictory\nnegation and again the demand will arise for a further\nconcept that can reconcile these opposed concepts by\nincorporating them as moments. The method Hegel employs here, determinate negation, is often\ncompared with Spinoza’s principle that “all determination\nis negation”, but while Hegel’s is related to\nSpinoza’s thought, it cannot be identified with or reduced to\nit.  Spinoza’s top-down determination starts with a single\ncategory (in his case, divine substance) that is then\nprogressively divided by the application of concepts—the model\nbeing Plato’s method of division in which\na genus concept is divided into particular species\nby the presence or absence of some differentiating property. From\nHegel’s point of view, however, this cannot\ncapture individuals as other than parts of that\ngreater whole—a metaphysical picture in relation to Spinoza he\nrefers to as acosmism. So Hegel will\nbalance this type of determination by negation, with a\ndifferent type of negation modeled on that which holds\nbetween incompatible properties of some object (for example,\nred and blue as incompatible colors) and that is reflected in the\nterm negation of Aristotle’s logic. This allows\nHegel to go beyond the determination of something\nas particular (suggesting the part-whole relation) to a more\nrobust sense of singularity [Einzelheit]—the\nsense of the pure thisness seen initially in\nthe Phenomenology’s Sense-certainty chapter, the truth\nof which was then shown to be Aristotle’s idea of an individual\nthing’s substantial form in the Perception\nchapter. It is in terms of this category that we can think, along with\nAristotle, of a thing having an underlying substrate within which\nproperties inhere and which, unlike the properties\nthemselves, cannot be thought in general terms, but only in\nterms of the category of singularity. And yet this will\nencounter a problem for the determinacy of this underlying\nsubstrate—it will have to find determining contrasts\nthat allow it to be determinately conceived. (In Book 2 of\nthe Logic we will learn that the category of singularity will\nrely on particularity just as particularity has been shown to rely on\nsingularlity. Singular substrates or “essences” can only\nbe known in relation to the general properties that constitute their\nappearances.) Attempting to unravel the intricacies of the patterns of dependence\nbetween such categories will be task of this mammoth work, but here a\ngeneral point might be made. If Hegel’s thought here is\nconsidered to be, like Spinoza’s, holistic, it is only\nso at a higher level of abstraction, such that these determinations\nof singularity, particularity\nand universality cannot themselves be understood in isolation\nfrom each other but only via their complex interactions. Hegel\nonly explicitly explores the details of the interactions of\nthese determinations of conceptuality in his discussion of judgments\nand syllogisms in Book 3, The Doctrine of Concept,\nsuggesting that concerns of logic as traditionally\nconceived are not as irrelevant to the Science of Logic as\noften thought. However, the general point separating his approach from\nthat of Spinoza clearly emerges earlier on. Determinate negation is\nnot Spinoza’s principle as Spinoza’s presupposes a whole\nthat precedes its parts, and that all negations are\nnegations of something that is primitively positive. In\ncontrast, Hegel’s negations will be negations of determinations\nthat are already to be conceived as themselves\nnegations. The other basic methodological principle of the Logic will\nbe that this categorical infrastructure of thought is able to be\nunpacked using only the resources available to thought\nitself: the capacity of thought to make its contents determinate (in a\nway somewhat like what Leibniz had thought of as making clear but\nconfused ideas clear and distinct), and its capacity to be consistent\nand avoid contradiction. Again, for some readers, this makes\nHegel’s logic akin to Kant’s transcendental logic that,\nrather than treating the pure form of thought abstracted\nfrom all content, treats thought as already possessing a\ncertain type of self-generated content, (in Kant’s terminology,\n“transcendental content”) that is presupposed by the\nsubsequent acquisition of all empirical content. But if\nHegel’s is akin to Kant’s transcendental logic, it has\nclear differences to it as well. For Kant, transcendental logic was\nthe logic governing the thought of finite thinkers like ourselves,\nwhose cognition was constrained by the necessity of applying general\ndiscursive concepts to the singular contents given in sensory\nintuitions, and he contrasted this with the thought of a type of\nthinker not so constrained—God—a thinker whose thought\ncould directly grasp the world in a type of intellectual\nintuition. While opinions divide as to how Hegel’s approach to\nlogic relates to that of Kant, it is important to grasp that for Hegel\nlogic is not simply a science of the form of our thoughts. It is also\na science of actual content as well, and as such has an\nontological dimension. The thought determinations of Book 1 lead eventually into those of\nBook 2, The Doctrine of Essence. Naturally the logical structures and\nprocesses implicit in essence-thinking are more developed than those\nof being-thinking. Crucially, the contrasting pair essence and\nappearance of Essence-logic allow the thought of some underlying\nreality that manifests itself through a different overlying\nappearance, in the way that the forces posited by the\noperations of the Understanding (explored in\nthe Phenomenology’s Chapter 3) are grasped through the\nappearances they explain. In contrast, the categories of Being-logic\nseem to govern thought processes that are restricted to qualitative\nphenomena and their co-ordinations. But distinction\nbetween essence and appearance must itself\ninstantiate the relation of determinate negation, and the metaphysical\ntendency to think of reality as made up of some underlying substrates\nin contrast to the superficial appearances will itself come to grief\nwith the discovery that the notion of an essence is only meaningful\nin virtue of the appearance that it is meant to explain\naway. (In terms of the ultimate conceptual categories of\nsingularity, particularity and universality, this discovery would be\nequivalent to grasping the idea that the singularity of the\nunderlying, non-perceivable substrate or substantial form is\nmeaningful only in relation to something that can bear\nthe particular qualities that constitutes its worldly\nappearance.) For Hegel it is the complex modern, but pre-Kantian,\nversions of substance metaphysics, like those of Spinoza and Leibniz,\nthat bring out in the most developed way the inherently contradictory\nnature of this form of thought. Book 3, The Doctrine of Concept, effects a shift from\nthe Objective Logic of Books 1 and 2, to\nSubjective Logic, and metaphysically coincides with a\nshift to the modern subject-based category theory of Kant. Just as\nKantian philosophy is founded on a conception of objectivity secured\nby conceptual coherence, Concept-logic commences with the concept of\nconcept itself, with its moments of singularity,\nparticularity and universality. While in the two books of objective\nlogic, the movement had been between particular concepts,\nbeing, nothing, becoming\netc., in the subjective logic, the conceptual relations are grasped at\na meta-level, such that the concept concept treated in\nChapter 1 of section 1 (Subjectivity) passes over into\nthat of judgment in Chapter 2. It is important to grasp\nthe basic contours of Hegel’s treatment of judgment as it\ninforms his subsequent treatment of inference. Reprising an etymological point made by Hölderlin, Hegel notes\nthat a judgment (Urteil) involves a separation\n(Teilung) of parts: in basic terms a predicate is said of\nsome subject giving the judgment the grammatical form “S\nis P”, but in saying\n“S is P”, the judging subject\naffirms the unity existing between the parts. S\nand P are thus meant (1) to be diverse, but (2) to form a\nunity—a situation we are now familiar with in terms of\nthe Aufhebung of parts in a whole. Hegel takes this as\nsignaling two ways of thinking of the relation of subject and\npredicate in the judgment. One can take subject and predicate terms as\nself-subsistent entities that are joined in the judgment, or\none can take the judgment itself as the primary unit\nthat splits into subject and predicate terms.  This in fact\ncoincides with the two different ways in which logical relations have\nbeen conceived in the history of philosophy: the former represents\nthe term-logical approach characteristic of Aristotle, while\nthe latter represents the propositional approach\ncharacteristic of the Stoics and much recent philosophy. From the\nformer point of view one thinks of the subject term as designating a\nsubstance, typically grasped as an instance of a kind, in which\nproperties, designated by predicate terms, inhere. From the\nlatter point of view, one thinks of predicate terms as abstract\nuniversals that subsume or are satisfied by entities to which\nthe subject terms refer, an approach which conceives of the\npropositional content, in Stoic terminology—the\nlecton, the what-is-said—as having a\nprimacy over the parts. Using a distinction from the Medievals, we can\ndescribe the first type of judgments as de re (about things)\nand the second as de dicto (about sayings). These\nalternative joining and splitting approaches can in\nturn be applied to the relationship of judgments\nwithin inferences or syllogisms. While it is more\ncommon for inferences to be thought of as composed of\njudgments which have their own truth values, the judgments\nthemselves can be thought of as gaining their meaning via the role\nthey play in inferences, parallel to the way that the parts\nof the judgment can be thought of as resulting from the\njudgment’s splitting.  Within recent semantic theory,\nRobert Brandom has argued for such an inferentialist\nanalysis and has suggested this way of understanding Hegel’s\nlogic (Brandom 2014), a view that fits with Hegel’s idea that\nthe syllogism is the “truth of the judgment” (SL:\n593). Thought of in terms of the framework of Kant’s\ntranscendental logic, Hegel’s position would be\nakin to allowing inferences—syllogisms—a\nrole in the determination of the transcendental content\nof judgments, a role that is not allowed in Kant. As we have said, Hegel’s logic is meant somehow to generate a\ncontent—to produce a type of ontology—and this\ncomes into explicit focus with Hegel’s puzzling claim in Book 3\nconcerning a syllogism that has become “concrete” and\n“full of content” that thereby has necessary\nexistence (SL: 616–7). In contrast with Kant, Hegel seems to go\nbeyond a transcendental deduction of the formal conditions of\nexperience and thought and to a deduction of their material\nconditions. Traditionalists will here point to Hegel’s allusions\nto the ontological proof (SL: 625) of medieval theology in which\nthe existence of God is seen as necessitated by his\nconcept—an argument undermined by Kant’s criticism of the\ntreatment of existence as a predicate. In Hegel’s\nversion, it is said, the objective existence that God achieves in the\nworld is seen as necessitated by his essential\nself-consciousness. Non-traditional readings, in contrast, would have\nto interpret this aspect of Hegel’s logic very\ndifferently. Brandom’s inferentialist interpretation of Hegel,\nwhen joined to ideas taken from Hegel’s treatment of\nself-consciousness in the Phenomenology, suggests a way\nforward here. The first thing to be emphasized here is that we shouldn’t\nthink of judgments and their contents as something\nlike mental contents—subjective or psychological states\nof a thinker’s mind.  Such a psychologistic\nattitude was opposed by Hegel just as it was opposed by a figure as\ncentral to modern logic as Gottlob Frege. For Frege, thoughts are not\nmental, rather they are abstract entities like\nnumbers, so the problem facing us is not how to go from mental\ncontents to the concrete world, it is how to go from abstract\nto concrete ones. But here we must keep in mind Hegel’s two-fold\nway of thinking about judgments, de dicto and de re,\nand while it is usual to think of the contents of de dicto\njudgments as abstract (here to think of the content\nas propositional is usual), some have thought of the contents\nof de re judgments as including the thing itself\n(the “re”) that the judgment is about.  (In fact\nBertrand Russell had, at points in his career, entertained such an\nidea of propositional content itself.) Thus when Hegel\ncharacterizes some judgment structures (typically perception based\njudgments) as judgments of existence one might take the\nperceived thing itself as straightforwardly part of the\ncontent of the judgment. It is a concrete object, but\nnot grasped as a concrete simple, but grasped in relation to\nwhat is judged of it in the predicate. And to the extent\nthat judgments can be considered components of syllogisms, we\nmight appreciate how syllogisms might have become\ncontentful in a process that has culminated in the concrete syllogism of\nnecessity. If the concrete object of a de re judgment is effectively\nwhat had been under consideration in Chapter 2, Perception, in\nthe Phenomenology (the thing with properties), we now might\nenvisage where Hegel’s thought is headed in these sections of\nthe subjective logic. In the Phenomenology it turned out that\nthe capacity for a subject to entertain objects of consciousness such\nas perceptual ones was that such a subject was capable\nof self-consciousness. It then turned out that to be capable\nof self-consciousness the subject had to exist in a world with other\nembodied subjects whose intentions it could recognize. It is here that\nwe might pick up Robert Brandom’s suggestion, following Sellars,\nthat we should think of the existence of inferential processes or\nprocesses of reasoning as presupposing participation within social\ncommunicative interactions in which the making of an assertion is\nconsidered as a move in a language-game of the “giving and\nasking for reasons”. In short, we may think of Hegel’s\nsyllogism of necessity, which constitutes the ground or\n“truth” of the earlier formal conception of\nsyllogisms, as a type of inter-subjective practice embodying\nthought—a type of syllogising practice that is by\nnecessity inter-subjective and recognitive. Formally considered we\nmight think of this syllogism as the logical schematization of the\nmost developed form of recognition in which thinkers\nacknowledge others as free thinkers. I have suggested that in the syllogism of necessity with which\nHegel’s treatment of inference terminates we get a glimpse of a\ntype of contentful and dynamic rational process unfolding in the midst\nof the recognitive and communicative interactions between finite\nliving and intentional beings. What we see here is a reprise of the\nconception of logos as an objective process running through the world\nas had been conceived by the ancient Stoics and neo-Platonists. But it\nis now embedded not simply in the world as\nsuch—in nature—but in\nobjectivized spirit, in human communities of thinkers. We are\nnow returned to the domain of objectivity that had\ncharacterized Books 1 and 2 of the Science of Logic, but we\nmight expect such a return from subjectivity to have effected\na change in objectivity as earlier understood. To cross straight into a consideration of the objectivity of the\nhuman world of action and thought—spirit—would be to break\nthe developmental pattern of the logic because thought about such a\ncomplex form of objective existence will presuppose thought about\nsimpler forms. And so the starting point for the consideration of\nobjectivity will again be that of the simple object as something\nimmediately grasped by thought. But this object can now be\ndeveloped with that elaborate conceptual apparatus that\nhas emerged in the preceding section. Progression here will be from a\nnaïve and immediate concept of an object as simple\nself-sufficient thing, a thing with its identity centered on itself,\nthrough the more complex idea of an object as grasped from within the\ninterstices of physical and chemical thought, to the models of\nteleological and living systems. The Logic then transitions\ninto a consideration of the “adequate concept, the\nobjectively true, or the true as such” (SL:\n670). This adequate concept is the Idea, which, after tracking through\nconsiderations of the living individual and theoretical and\npractical cognition, emerges as the Absolute Idea. As we have mentioned, Hegel’s Encyclopaedia of\nPhilosophical Sciences was written as a teaching manual, various\nparts of which were later expanded upon in lecture courses devoted to\nspecific parts of the system. The first part of\nthe Encyclopaedia is essentially a condensed version of his\nearlier Science of Logic, considered above. We will pass over\na consideration of this work to the next component of\nthe Encyclopaedia, Hegel’s Philosophy of\nNature. Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature (first published as\nsuch in 1842, and based on §§245–376 from the\n1830 Encyclopaedia, supplemented by material and student\ntranscripts from Hegel’s Berlin lectures) has often been damned\nby the contention that Hegel had simply dismissed the\nactivity of the natural sciences, especially Newtonian science, as\nbased upon the inadequacies of the Understanding, and in\ntheir place had tried to somehow deduce the natural\nworld from philosophical first principles. Recently, however, defenses\nof Hegel’s philosophy of science have started to emerge,\nespecially from the side of Hegel’s reformed\nmetaphysical interpreters. Thus, it has been argued by Westphal\n(2008) for example, that Hegel’s philosophy of nature actually\nrepresents a sophisticated attempt to think through epistemological\nassumptions that are presupposed by the development of Newton’s\ntheory. Defending Hegel’s philosophy of science from a similar\npoint of view, James Kreines (2008) has argued for the relevance of\nHegel’s logical categories for the biological sciences of his\ntimes. We won’t here attempt to present such arguments, but\nbefore any such reassessment of Hegel’s work here could\nbe undertaken, the fundamental criticism raised above of a project\nthat attempts to base a philosophy of nature on his logic rather than\nthe empirical sciences must be addressed. Was not Hegel simply trying\nto pre-empt the work of empirical scientists by somehow attempting to\nanticipate the very contents of their discoveries from\nlogical considerations alone? This objection is often summed up under the slogan of\n“deducing Krug’s pen”, in that in 1801 the\nphilosopher W.T. Krug had accused Schelling’s idealist\nphilosophy of nature of aiming to deduce the nature of all contingent\nphenomena, even that of the pen with which he, Krug, was writing his\ncritique. Hegel responded to Krug’s accusation in the following\nyear, claiming that Krug had made the common mistake of conflating the\nunderstanding with reason, and treating the Absolute as something on\nthe same level as finite things. Hegel was, at this time, closely aligned with Schelling’s\nviews, and would separate his own views from\nSchelling’s in subsequent years leading up to the writing\nof Phenomenology of Spirit. Nevertheless, Hegel clearly\nthought that his point held regardless of the relation of his own\nviews to Schelling’s as he was to make similar points against\nKrug in a remark added to the Philosophy of Nature from the\nHeidelberg and Berlin periods. While logic must not be restricted to\nthe “form” of an externally given “matter”,\nnevertheless, it is the height of pointlessness to demand of the\nconcept that it should explain … construe or deduce these\ncontingent products of nature. (PN: §250, remark. Krug is\nmentioned explicitly in a footnote at this point.)\n \nThe point is expanded upon further when it is\nsaid that it is an error on the part of the philosophy of nature\nto attempt to face up to all phenomena; this is done in the finite\nsciences, where everything has to be reduced to general conceptions\n(hypotheses). In these sciences the empirical element is the sole\nconfirmation of the hypothesis, so that everything has to be\nexplained.  (PN: §270, addition) In keeping with the more general idea that that philosophy attempts\nto discern or recognize concepts in\nrepresentations (Vorstellungen) or empirical appearances, philosophy of\nnature investigates the conceptual structures that are manifest in the\nproducts of the scientific work that is done on the basis of those\nappearances. Traces of conceptual determination will certainly\nsurvive in the most particularized product, although they will not\nexhaust its nature. (PN: §250 remark)\n \nClearly, philosophy of nature is not in competition with the empirical\nnatural sciences; it takes as its subject matter the results of those\nsciences in order to discover within them the particular ways in which\nthe necessary categorial structures deduced in the logic are\nexpressed. In terms of topics treated, the Philosophy of Nature\nlargely coincides with those treated in the third book of\nthe Science of Logic when the logical processes and relations\nin question have returned to objectivity after the\nexcursion into the subjectivity of formal logic at the outset\nof Book 3.  In Mechanism Hegel had reconstructed a\nmovement in thought from a primitive cosmology in which all objects\nare conceived in relation to a central object (the sun) that\nexemplifies objecthood per se, to a system of objects within\nwhich any such self-sufficient center has been\neliminated. In this Newtonian world, that which gives order to the\nwhole now has the ideality of law, but this\nis itself thought of as external to the system\nof objects. After an Introduction, Section One of\nthe Philosophy of Nature, Mechanics, expands on this\nprogression through considerations of space and time, matter\nconsidered as the diversity of individual bodies distributed in space\nand time, and finally the idea of universal gravitation as the\ndeterminate concept of such corporeal matter realized as idea\n(PN: §270). In the Newtonian laws of mechanics, however, the\nunity of matter is still only formal, and in Section\nTwo, Physics, the determinateness of form is now considered\nas immanent within such corporeal matter. Matter has individuality to the extent that it is\ndetermined within itself by having being-for-self developed within\nit. It is through this determination that matter breaks away from\ngravity and manifests itself as implicitly self-determining. (PN:\n§273)\n \nWhile Mechanics clearly reflects the\nmore space-filling conception of matter dominant in\nBritish thought, Physics is consistent with the more\ndynamic continental European conception of matter\noriginating in Leibniz with his idea of living\nforces. Within this framework, Hegel attempts to organize a\nvast array of areas of contemporary physical investigation including\nmeteorology, theories of sound and heat, light and electricity up to\nand including chemical processes which stand on the\nthreshold of Organic Physics, dealt with in Section\nThree. The study of organics represents a return to the consideration\nof the individual body with which Mechanics had\nstarted, but now considered as “infinite process in which\nthe individuality determines itself as the particularity or\nfinitude which it also negates, and returns into itself by\nre-establishing itself at the end of the process as the beginning”. The\nbody is now “an impregnated and negative unity, which\nby relating itself to itself, has become essentially self-centred\nand subjective” (PN: §337). From such a conception,\nthe first body to be considered is that of the earth\nitself, along with its history. Chapter Two moves to a\nconsideration of the plant and Chapter Three, the animal\norganism. From the point of view of the actual content of scientific theories\nand approaches that Hegel summarizes and locates within his system,\nhis Philosophy of Nature is clearly a product of his time.\nNevertheless, many of the underlying philosophical issues dealt with\nare still now far from settled. Thus, while Newtonian physics clearly\nbecame established in ways that made Leibniz’s dynamic physics\nseem obsolete as empirical theory, debate still goes on as to\nwhether conceptions of space-time in post-Newtonian physics is to be\nconceived in Newtonian or Leibnizian ways. In the Encyclopaedia, Philosophy of Nature is\nfollowed by Philosophy of Spirit (Geist).\nHegel’s usual triadic pattern when applied here results in\nsections devoted to the philosophies of subjective spirit, objective\nspirit, and absolute spirit. Philosophy of subjective spirit\nconstitutes what is closest in Hegel’s philosophy to a\nphilosophy of mind in the contemporary sense, while the philosophy\nof objective spirit concerns those objective patterns of\nsocial interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit\nis objectified in patterns of human life we have seen at work\nin Phenomenology of Spirit. Within subjective spirit, we may\nanticipate that the first division, Anthropology, will\nfollow on from topics with which Philosophy of Nature\nends—the animal organism—and so it does. Thus here Hegel\nis concerned with what he terms “Seele”,\n“soul”—which seems to translate more the ancient\nGreek term, “psyche”—and hence\nthe mind-body relation: If soul and body are absolutely opposed to one\nanother as is maintained by the abstractive intellectual consciousness,\n \nHegel comments, then there is no possibility of any community\nbetween them. The community was, however, recognized by ancient\nmetaphysics as an undeniable fact. (PN: § 389\nadd) The Seele of Anthropology should therefore not be\nconfused with the modern subjective conception of mind, as exemplified\nby Descartes and other early modern philosophers. Aristotle had\nconceived of the soul as the form of the body, not as a\nsubstance separate from that of the body, and had attributed lesser\nsouls to animals and even plants. (Again, Aristotle’s notion of\nsubstantial form comes into view.) Concomitantly, in\nthis section Hegel describes spirit as sunk in nature,\nand treats consciousness as largely limited to what now might be\ndescribed as sentient or phenomenal consciousness\nalone—the feeling soul. Consciousness in\nthe sense of the modern subject–object opposition only makes its\nappearance in the following second section, Phenomenology of\nSpirit, which, reprising key moments from the earlier book of\nthat name, raises a problem for how we are to understand the relation\nof phenomenology and systematic philosophy: is it\na path to it or part of it? Given that the\nrecognitive approach to self-consciousness presupposes that\npotential self-consciousnesses are in fact embodied and\nlocated in the world, we would expect the mind as treated\nin Psychology to be no less embodied as the way in which it\nis conceived in Anthropology. What in fact distinguishes the\nmind of Psychology from that of Anthropology is its\nrational capacities, considered in terms that would now be described\nas normative rather than simply naturalistic, and this\nfor Hegel clearly signals a difference in the way in which an actual\npsychological subject relates to his or her own body. The\ntype of abstractive thinking found in Psychology\ndoes not, of course, as in mythical images of metempsychosis—a\nfavorite trope of Platonists—involve the mind leaving\nthe body.  This would count for Hegel as a piece of mythical\npicture thinking—a Vorstellung. Rather,\nit involves a certain capacity of the psychological subject to suspend\nunreflected-upon endorsement of the claims made on behalf of\nhis or her body, for example, to subject the evidence\ngiven by the senses to rational scrutiny. Given the dialectical mode in which Hegel’s texts progress,\nas seen already in both Phenomenology of Spirit\nand Science of Logic, we will expect the capacities examined\nin Psychology to ultimately depend upon those that come under\nconsideration in the context of objective spirit. In this\nsense, we are witnessing within another mode, the type of progression\nseen in the movement in Phenomenology from shapes of\nconsciousness to shapes of spirit. The\ninternal Phenomenology of Spirit seems to play an important\nrole in setting up this transition from Psychology\nto Objective Spirit (Williams 2007), but it might also be\nseen as crucial in relating the more cognitive dimensions\nof Psychology back to the theme of embodiment prominent\nin Anthropology (Nuzzo 2013a).Thus any naturalistic analysis is ultimately\nsurpassed by a social and historical one, which itself cannot\nbe understood as anti-naturalistic. The philosophy of subjective spirit passes over into that\nof objective spirit, which concerns the objective patterns of\nsocial interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit\nis objectified. The book entitled Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight, published in 1821 as a textbook to accompany Hegel’s\nlectures at the University of Berlin, essentially corresponds to a\nmore developed version of the philosophy of objective spirit and will\nbe considered here. The Philosophy of Right (as it is more commonly called)\ncan be read as a political philosophy that stands independently of the\nsystem (Tunick 1992), despite the fact that Hegel intended it to be\nread against the background of the developing conceptual\ndeterminations of the Logic. The text proper starts from the\nconception of a singular willing subject (grasped from the point of\nview of its individual self-consciousness) as the bearer of\nabstract right. While this conception of the individual\nwilling subject possessing some kind of fundamental rights was in fact\nthe starting point of many modern political philosophies (such as that\nof Locke, for example) the fact that Hegel commences here does not\ntestify to any ontological assumption that the consciously willing and\nright-bearing individual is the basic atom from which all society can\nbe understood as constructed—an idea at the heart of standard\nsocial contract theories. Rather, this is simply the\nmost immediate starting point of Hegel’s\npresentation and corresponds to analogous starting places of\nthe Phenomenology and the Logic. Just as the\ncategories of the Logic develop in a way meant to demonstrate\nthat what had at the start been conceived as simple is in fact only\nmade determinate in virtue of its being a functional part of some\nlarger structure or process, here too it is meant to be shown that any\nsimple willing and right-bearing subject only gains its determinacy in\nvirtue of a place it finds for itself in a larger social, and\nultimately historical, structure or process. Thus, even a contractual\nexchange (the minimal social interaction for contract theorists) is\nnot to be thought simply as an occurrence consequent upon the\nexistence of two beings with natural animal wants and some natural\ncalculative rationality, as in Hobbes, say; rather, the system of\ninteraction within which individual exchanges take place (the economy)\nwill be treated holistically as a culturally-shaped form of social\nlife within which the actual wants of individuals as well as their\nreasoning powers are given determinate forms. Hegel is well aware of\nthe distinctive modernity of this form of social-life. Here too it becomes apparent that Hegel, taking up themes from\nthe Phenomenology, follows Fichte in treating property in\nterms of a recognitive analysis of the nature of such a\nright. A contractual exchange of commodities between two individuals\nitself involves an implicit act of recognition in as much as each, in\ngiving something to the other in exchange for what they want, is\nthereby recognizing that other as a proprietor of that thing,\nor, more properly, of the inalienable value attaching to it\n(PR: §§72–81). By contrast, such proprietorship would\nbe denied rather than recognised in fraud or\ntheft—forms of wrong (Unrecht) in which\nright is negated rather than acknowledged or posited\n(§§82–93). Thus what differentiates property from\nmere possession is that it is grounded in a relation of\nreciprocal recognition between two willing subjects (§71 and\nremark). Moreover, it is in the exchange relation that we can see what\nit means for Hegel for individual subjects to share a common\nwill—an idea which will have important implications with\nrespect to the difference of Hegel’s conception of the state\nfrom that of Rousseau. Such an interactive constitution of the common\nwill means that for Hegel that the identity among wills is\nachieved because of not in spite of co-existing\ndifferences between the particular wills of the subjects involved:\nwhile contracting individuals both will the\nsame exchange, at a more concrete level, they do so with\ndifferent ends in mind. Each wants something different from\nthe exchange. Without this difference, the type of\nabsorption of individual subjects into\ncollective substance of the type of Hegel worries about in\nrelation to Spinoza would occur (§258 remark). Hegel passes from the abstractly individualistic frame of\nAbstract Right to the social determinacies of\nSittlichkeit or Ethical Life (PR: §142) via\nconsiderations first of wrong, the negation of right,\n(§§82–96) and the punishment that such wrong entails\nthe negation of wrong, and hence the “negation of the\nnegation” of the original right (§§97–104), and\nthen of morality, conceived more or less as an\ninternalisation of the external legal relations presupposed by\npunishment. Consideration of Hegel’s version of the\nretributivist approach to punishment affords a good example of his use\nof the logic of negation. In punishing the criminal the state makes it\nclear to its members that it is the acknowledgment of right per\nse that is essential to developed social life: the significance\nof acknowledging another’s right in the contractual exchange\ncannot be, as it at first might have appeared to the participants,\nsimply that of an instrumental means by which each gets what he or she\nwants from the other. Hegel’s treatment of punishment also brings out the\ncontinuity of his way of conceiving of the structure and dynamics of\nthe social world with that of Kant, as Kant too, in\nhis Metaphysics of Morals had employed the idea of the\nstate’s punitive action as a negating of the original\ncriminal act. Kant’s idea, conceived on the model of the\nphysical principle of action and reaction, was structured by the\ncategory of community or reciprocal interaction, and was\nconceived as involving what he called real\nopposition. Such an idea of opposed dynamic forces seems to\nform something of a model for Hegel’s idea of contradiction and\nthe starting point for his conception of reciprocal\nrecognition. Nevertheless, clearly Hegel articulates the structures of\nrecognition in more complex ways than those derivable from\nKant’s category of community. First of all, in Hegel’s analysis of Sittlichkeit\nthe type of sociality found in the market-based civil\nsociety is to be understood as dependent upon and in\ncontrastive opposition with the more immediate form found in the\ninstitution of the family: a form of sociality mediated by a\nquasi-natural inter-subjective recognition rooted in sentiment and\nfeeling—love (PR: §§ 158–60). (This dependence\nshows how anthropological determinations do not simply\ndisappear with the development of more psychological\nones—they are preserved as well as\nnegated as in the pattern of what\nis aufgehoben. It also shows the mutual dependence of the\ndeterminations of the singularity of the atomistic subjects\nof civil society and their particularity as members (parts)\nof holistically conceived families.) Here Hegel seems to have extended\nFichte’s legally characterized notion of recognition into the\ntypes of human inter-subjectivity earlier broached by Hölderlin\nand the romantics. In the family the particularity of each individual\ntends to be absorbed into the social unit (one is a part of\none’s family), giving this manifestation\nof Sittlichkeit a one-sidedness that is the inverse of that\nfound in market relations in which participants grasp themselves in\nthe first instance as singular [einzeln]\nself-identical individuals who then enter into relationships\nthat are external to them. These two opposite but interlocking principles of social existence\nprovide the basic structures in terms of which the component parts of\nthe modern state are articulated and understood. As both contribute\nparticular characteristics to the subjects involved in them, part of\nthe problem for the rational state will be to ensure that each of\nthese two principles mediates the other, each thereby mitigating\nthe one-sidedness of the other. Thus, individuals who\nencounter each other in the external relations of the\nmarket place and who have their subjectivity shaped by such relations\nalso belong to families where they are subject to opposed\ninfluences. Moreover, even within the ensemble of production and\nexchange mechanisms of civil society individuals will belong to\nparticular estates (the agricultural estate, that of\ntrade and industry, and the universal estate of civil\nservants (PR: §§199–208)), whose internal forms of\nsociality will show family-like features. Although the actual details of Hegel’s mapping\nof the categorical structures of the Logic onto\nthe Philosophy of Right are far from clear, the general\nmotivation is apparent.  Hegel’s logical categories can be read\nas an attempt to provide a schematic account of the material (rather\nthan formal) conditions required for developed self-consciousness for\nwhom rationality and freedom are maximized. Thus we might regard the\nvarious syllogisms of Hegel’s Subjective\nLogic as attempts to chart the skeletal structures of those\ndifferent types of recognitive inter-subjectivity necessary to sustain\nvarious aspects of rational cognitive and conative functioning\n(self-consciousness). From this perspective, we might\nsee his logical schematisation of the modern\nrational state as a way of displaying just those sorts\nof mediating institutions that a state must provide if it is to answer\nRousseau’s question of the form of association needed for the\nformation and expression of the general will. Concretely, for Hegel it is representation of the estates within\nthe legislative bodies that is to achieve this (PR:\n§§301–14). As the estates of civil society group their\nmembers according to their common interests, and as the deputies\nelected from the estates to the legislative bodies give voice to those\ninterests within the deliberative processes of legislation, the\noutcome of this process might give expression to the general\ninterest. But Hegel’s republicanism is here\nbalanced by his invocation of the familial principle: such\nrepresentative bodies can only provide the content of the\nlegislation to a constitutional monarch who must add to it\nthe form of the royal decree—an individual “I will\n…” (§§275–81). To declare that for Hegel\nthe monarch plays only a symbolic role here is to miss\nthe fundamentally idealist complexion of his political philosophy. The\nexpression of the general will in legislation cannot be thought of as\nan outcome of some quasi-mechanical process: it must\nbe willed. If legislation is to express the general will,\ncitizens must recognize it as expressing their wills; and\nthis means, recognising it as willed. The monarch’s\nexplicit “I will” is thus needed to close this recognitive\ncircle, lest legislation look like a mechanical compromise resulting\nfrom a clash of contingent interests, and so as\nactively willed by nobody. Thus while Hegel is critical of\nstandard social contract theories, his own conception of\nthe state is still clearly a complicated transformation of those of\nRousseau and Kant. Perhaps one of the most influential parts of\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right concerns his analysis of\nthe contradictions of the unfettered capitalist economy. On the one\nhand, Hegel agreed with Adam Smith that the interlinking of productive\nactivities allowed by the modern market meant that “subjective\nselfishness” turned into a “contribution towards the\nsatisfaction of the needs of everyone else” (PR: §199). But\nthis did not mean that he accepted Smith’s idea that this\n“general plenty” produced thereby diffused (or\n“trickled down”) though the rest of society. From within\nthe type of consciousness generated within civil society, in which\nindividuals are grasped as bearers of rights abstracted\nfrom the particular concrete relationships to which they belong,\nSmithean optimism may seem justified. But this simply attests to the\none-sidedness of this type of abstract thought, and the need for it to\nbe mediated by the type of consciousness based in the family in which\nindividuals are grasped in terms of the way they belong to\nthe social body. In fact, the unfettered operation of the\nmarket produces a class caught in a spiral of poverty.\nStarting from this analysis, Marx later used it as evidence of the\nneed to abolish the individual proprietorial rights at the heart of\nHegel’s civil society and socialise the means of\nproduction.  Hegel, however, did not draw this conclusion. His\nconception of the exchange contract as a form of recognition that\nplayed an essential role within the state’s capacity to provide\nthe conditions for the existence of rational and free-willing subjects\nwould certainly prevent such a move. Rather, the economy was to be\ncontained within an over-arching institutional framework of the state,\nand its social effects offset by welfarist intervention. Some of\nHegel’s most telling criticisms of the unmediated effects of\nmodern civil society concern those on the psychological lives of\nindividuals. Recently, an approach to social reality with Hegelian\nprovenance that uses the notion of recognition to articulate such\npathologies has been developed by Axel Honneth (2010),\ntestifying to the continuing relevance of Hegel’s analyses. The final 20 paragraphs of the Philosophy of Right (and\nthe final 5 paragraphs of objective spirit section of\nthe Encyclopaedia) are devoted to world history\n(die Weltgeschichte), and they also coincide with the point\nof transition from objective to absolute spirit. We have\nalready seen the relevance of historical issues for Hegel in the\ncontext of the Phenomenology of Spirit, such that a series of\ndifferent forms of objective spirit can be grasped in terms of the\ndegree to which they enable the development of a universalizable\nself-consciousness capable of rationality and freedom. Hegel was to\nenlarge on these ideas in a lecture series given five times during his\nBerlin period, and it was via the text assembled on the basis\nof these lectures by his son Karl, that many readers would be\nintroduced to Hegel’s ideas after his death. World history is made up of the histories of particular\npeoples within which spirit assumes some “particular principle\non the lines of which it must run through a development of its\nconsciousness and its actuality” (PM: §548). Just the same\ndialectic that we have first seen operative among shapes of\nconsciousness in the Phenomenology and among categories or\nthought-determinations in the Logic can be observed here. An\nhistorical community acts on the principle that informs its\nsocial life, the experience and memory of this action and the\nconsequences it brings—a memory encoded in the stories that\ncirculate in the community—results in this principle becoming\navailable for the self-consciousness of the community, thus breaking\nthe immediacy of its operation. This loss of immediacy brings\nabout the decline of that community but gives rise to the principle of\na new community: in rendering itself objective and making this its\nbeing an object of thought, [spirit] on the one hand destroys the\ndeterminate form of its being, and on the other hand gains a\ncomprehension of the universal element which it involves, and thereby\ngives a new form to its inherent principle … [which] has risen\ninto another, and in fact a higher principle.  (PWH: 81)\n \nThis dialectic linking concrete communities into a\ndevelopmental narrative which shows the path of liberation for the spiritual\nsubstance, the deed by which the absolute final aim of the world is\nrealized in it, and the merely implicit mind achieves consciousness\nand self-consciousness. (PM: §549)\n \nIt is a dialectic, however, which only passes\n through some communities. Hegel’s is a\n clearly Eurocentric account of history. It is thus that “the analysis of the successive grades [of\nuniversal history] in their abstract form belongs to logic”\n(PWH: 56), but once more, it must be stressed that, as with philosophy\nof nature, philosophy of history is not meant to somehow\nmagically deduce actual empirical historical phenomena, like\nKrug’s pen; rather, it takes the results of actual empirical\nhistory as its material and attempts to find exemplified within this\nmaterial the sorts of categorial progressions of the logic. Thus the\nactivity of the philosophical historian presupposes that of\n“original” and “reflective” historians (PWH:\n1–8). The actual world is full of contingencies from which\nempirical historians will have already abstracted in constructing\ntheir narratives, for example, when writing from\nparticular national perspectives. To grasp\nhistory philosophically, however, will be to grasp it\nfrom the perspective of world-history itself, and this\nprovides the transition to absolute spirit, as world history\nwill understood in terms of the manifestation of what from a religious\nperspective is called “God”, or from a philosophical\nperspective, “reason”. Hegel clearly thinks that there is\na way of cognitively relating to history in a way that goes beyond the\nstandpoint of consciousness and the\nunderstanding—the standpoint of what we now think of as\ninforming scientific history. From the perspective of consciousness\nhistory is something that stands over against me qua\nsomething known, but from the standpoint\nof self-consciousness I grasp this history as the history of\nthat which contributes to me, qua rational and free\nbeing. The subject matter of the final 25 paragraphs of\nthe Encyclopaedia Philosophy of Spirit, Absolute\nSpirit, came to be expanded massively into the contents of\nthree different lectures series on philosophy of art, religion, and\nhistory of philosophy given multiple times during Hegel’s decade in\nBerlin. Assembled and published in the years immediately following his\ndeath, these were the works through which Hegel was to become known as\nperhaps the most significant synoptic theorist of these cultural\nphenomena. Rather than to attempt to capture the richness of his\nthought here in a few paragraphs, which would be bound to be futile, I\nwill simply try to allude to how this material is meant to draw upon\nthe conceptual resources noted so far. Hegel was writing in a time of intense development of ideas about\nthe arts. Kant had treated aesthetic experience largely in relation to\nthe experience of the beauty of nature, but for Hegel aesthetics\nbecomes primarily about art. The reason for this is simple:\nart is an objective medium in which a community collectively reflects\nupon itself, and the art of historical peoples is to be understood\nas the attempt to bring before the consciousnesses of its members the\ntotality of what is. It is as art that “consciousness\nof the Absolute first takes shape” (PM: §556). The\npeculiarity of art lie in the sensuousness of the medium in\nwhich its content is objectified. In the 1790s, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Schlegel had given\naesthetics an historical dimension, distinguishing the forms of\nancient and modern art in terms of the contrasts\nnaïve–sentimental and classical–romantic\nrespectively. Hegel adopts Schlegel’s terminology to distinguish\nas classical the art that thrived in the Greek and Roman\nworlds from the romantic art of post-classical\ntimes. Again, the romantic or modern here will be characterized by the\ndepth of a form of individual subjective consciousness that\nis largely missing in antiquity. But those in Greek antiquity,\nwhere psychological determinations were closer\nto anthropological ones, had lived with a comfortable felt\nunity between spirit and body and between the individual and\nsociety. A characteristic of the Greeks was their\nHeimatlichkeit—their collective feeling\nof being at home in the world as they were each\nat home in their bodies. Modern subjectivity is thereby\npurchased as the expense of a sense of abstraction\nand alienation from the actual world and from the\nself—a consequence of the way the modern subject has become\nrelated to his or her body in a different way. Hegel, influenced by the work of a former colleague, the Heidelberg\nphilologist Friedrich Creuzer, adds to Schlegel’s categorization\nof art forms by positing a further category of symbolic\nart, characterizing the material cultures of ancient Eastern\ncivilizations such as Persia, India and Egypt. The symbolic art of\npantheistic religions of the East used natural elements to\nsymbolize the gods of their cultures: Zoroastrianism had taken light,\nfor example, to symbolize the divine (Aes I: 325), and animal worship\nwas found in the Egyptians (Aes I: 357). But such\nactual things had to be distinguished from what was meant to\nbe symbolized by them, so violence had to be done to such natural\nforms in attempts to represent the absolute—such cultural\nproducts thus becoming “bizarre, grotesque, and tasteless”\n(Aes I: 77), This, however, undermined their initial function, and the\nGreeks were able to offer a dialectical solution to this\ncontradiction. They gave expression to the Absolute or\nthe Idea by taking as its material the\nspecifically human form, but only on condition of its being\nrendered “exempt from all the deficiency of the purely sensuous\nand from the contingent finitude of the phenomenal world”. But\neven as idealized in Greek sculpture, say, the represented Greek god\nis still an object of “naïve intuition and sensuous\nimagination” (Aes I: 77–8), and as such the classical gods\ncontained the germ of their own decline as they could not evade the finitudes incidental to anthropomorphism\n[which] pervert the gods into the reverse of what constitutes the\nessence of the substantial and Divine (Aes I: 502–4)\n \nA new form of art will be needed to resolve these contradictions, and\nthis is provided by romantic art. But the material for this\nform will not come from within art itself. While Greek art can be\nunderstood as simultaneously belonging to aesthetic and religious\nrealms, romantic art results from a fission within the symbolic realm\nof what in the Phenomenology Hegel had treated as a single\ncategory, Art-Religion. The transition from classical art to romantic\nart represents both a liberation of art from religion and of religion\nfrom art and the sensuous. Thus Christianity, whose rituals centered\naround the myth of God becoming man in the person of Jesus, had\navoided the type of reliance on the beautiful productions of art in\nthe way that characterized Greek religions. The shift from classical\nto romantic art, then, represents a broader shift between a culture\nwhose final authority was an aesthetic one and a culture in which this\nauthority was handed over to religion, and thus represents a shift in\nthe authoritativeness of different cognitive forms. This loss of\nultimate authority is the meaning of Hegel’s often misunderstood\nthesis of the death of art. For further discussion, see the entry on \nHegel’s aesthetics. It is well known that after Hegel’s death in 1831, his\nfollowers soon split into left, centre and right\nfactions over the issue of religion. A dispute over an\nappropriately Hegelian philosophical attitude to religion had been\nsparked by the publication in 1835–6 of David\nStrauss’s The Life of Jesus Critically\nExamined—the conservative right claiming that\nHegelianism reflected Christian orthodoxy, the left seeing it\nas a humanistic doctrine concerning the historical emancipation of\nmankind. In fact the implications of Hegel’s philosophy for\nreligious belief had been contentious since his rise to prominence in\nthe 1820s. While officially declaring that philosophy and religion had\nthe same content—God—Hegel claimed\nthat the conceptual form of philosophy dealt with this\nconcept in a more developed way than that which was achievable in the\nimagistic representational form of religion. Many opponents were\nsuspicious that the concept of God was emptied of its\nproper meaning in the process of Hegel’s philosophical\ntranslations and Hegel was suspected by some of pantheism or\natheism. Ultimately, then, the source of the corrosive effects of\nHegel’s philosophy on religion indeed could appear to be the\ninsistence that the content of religious belief, like everything else,\nbe grounded on rational, in fact logical,\nconsiderations—the logical coherence of the system of philosophy\nitself—rather than on anything like revelation. In the writings he had produced in the 1790s Hegel had shown a\nclear attraction to the type of folk art-religions of ancient Greece\nin contrast to Christianity, whose other-worldly doctrines did not\nreflect the kind of Heimatlichkeit he valued in\nthe ancient world, and it is common to see Hegel’s later embrace\nof the Christianity he described as “the consummate religion” as an\nexpression of a cultural and political conservatism of his later\nyears. This under-estimates the complexity of Hegel’s evolving\nviews on both philosophy and religion, however. The limitations of\nGreek at-homeness in the world had to do with the inability\nof Greek life and thought to sustain that dimension of human existence\nthat is reflected in the category of singularity of the\nsubject.  The fate of Socrates had thus represented the ultimate\nincompatibility with the Greek form of life itself of the type of\nindividual, reflective individual who could reflectively\nbring any belief into question and take a stand against\nconvention. Similar incompatibilities could be seen reflected in Greek\ntragedies such as Antigone. With the decline of the Greek world and the rise of the Roman one,\nmovements such as Stoicism and Christianity would come to give\nexpression to an individual point of view, but under the social\nconditions of Rome or the Middle Ages such a subjective point of view\ncould only be an alienated one attracted to what, in contrast to Greek\nconcreteness, would be seen as abstractions. Prior to the modern world\nthere would be no real place in either everyday life or in\nphilosophical culture for any non-alienated versions of the\nreflective or subjective position that had first emerged with\nSocrates—no form of life in which this individual dimension of\nhuman subjectivity could be at home. But\nChristianity marked a type of advance over Stoicism in that its\ndoctrines of the nature of a good life had a this\nworldly exemplar. Thus in describing the doctrine of the\nStoic sage, Hegel seemed fond of quoting Cicero’s dictum\nthat nobody can say who this sage is (LHP II: 250–1,\n256). It was the abstractness of the Stoic’s conception of the\ngood man that was answered by the new religious cult centred on the\nlife of the historical Christ. In this sense Christianity marked a definite advance over the more\nintuitively based religious cults to which Hegel had been attracted in\nhis youth, but it would only be in the modern world that the content\nof the core ideas of Christianity could be given proper\nexpression. Thus Hegel treats medieval Catholicism as still caught in\nthe abstractions of a transcendent realm and as caught up in a type of\nliteral reading of this\nreligion’s Vorstellungen—its\npictures. These need to become conceptualized, and this\nhappens under modern Protestantism, and this, for Hegel, requires a\ntype of demythologization of the religious content\nhanded down from the past. Christ must somehow come to stand as an\nexample of the human kind in general, which is the ultimate bearer of\nthe status of being the son of God. Once more, it is the\npurported singularity of the category son of God\nthat must be brought back into relation to the universality\nof the human genus. It is the nature of this result that\ndivided Hegel’s followers into their right and\nleft camps. The understanding of what Hegel means by the\nconcept religion in turn becomes tied to understanding what\nhe means by philosophy. Appropriately the Philosophy of\nReligion thus passes over into the final form of Absolute\nSpirit, Philosophy—a science that is the “unity of\nArt and Religion” (PM: §572). The mere six paragraphs devoted to this\nscience in the Encyclopaedia and dealing almost exclusively\nwith the relation of philosophy to religion were to be expanded into\nthe massive posthumously published three volumes on the\n(philosophical) history of philosophy based on various sources\nincluding student transcripts for his lecture series given in\nBerlin. In Hegel’s time, the idea that philosophy had a\nhistorical development had only recently come into focus. Both Fichte\nand Schelling had discussed the idea of a history of\nreason following Kant’s allusion to such a notion in the\nclosing pages of Critique of Pure Reason, and systematic\napproaches to the history of philosophy had emerged like that of\nW.G. Tennemann, who presupposed a type of Kantian framework. Clearly\nHegel’s history of philosophy would be a present-centered one,\nin which the philosophical narrative would reveal a development up to\nthe point represented by his own philosophy as its\nculmination. It is thus predictably Eurocentric: philosophy\n“commences in the West” because the West is where\n“this freedom of self-consciousness first comes forth”\n(LHP I: 99). There is an important caveat to add here,\nhowever. Philosophy is often identified with the capacity\nfor abstract thought, and this is not confined to Europe and\nits history. Rather, it is typical of eastern cultures like\nthose of India and China. As we have seen in the context\nof art, Hegel identifies Greek culture with a type of\nat-homeness in the world—what we might think of as\nthe opposite of a tendency to abstraction and its typical\nattraction to the transcendent or other-worldly. Greek philosophy, and so philosophy itself, starts with\nThales and Ionian natural philosophy. When Thales\nchoses water as the “the principle and substance of all\nthat is” (LHP I: 175) he has abstracted the concept\nwater from the stuff immediately encountered in puddles and so\non. Subsequent attempts to specify what it is that underlies all\nthings show influences of eastern abstraction as in\nPythagoras’s numericism, which is static and “destitute of\nprocess or dialectic” (LHP I: 212) but later thinkers such as Zeno and\nHeraclitus grasp that which is at the heart of things in more dynamic\nways. This type of dialectical thought which grasps the unity\nof opposites, familiar from the Phenomenology and\nthe Logic, comes to fruition in Plato’s\ndialogue Parmenides (LHP I: 261). What we are witnessing\nhere, of course, is meant to be a progression that in some sense\nmirrors the progression of categories in Hegel’s\nown Logic, but this progression of objective content\ngets joined to another dynamic with the appearance of Socrates.  Socrates was more than a philosopher: he was a\n“world-historical person”—a “main\nturning-point [Hauptwendepunkt] of spirit on itself”\nexhibited itself in his philosophical thought (LHP I: 384). In short,\nSocrates had added a subjective dimension to the otherwise\nnatural moral lives of Athenian citizens, in that he had\nchallenged them to find the principles not of worldly things but\nof their own actions, and challenged them to find these\nwithin the resources of their own individual consciousnesses. In him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of\nconsciousness that in an anthropological way existed in the first\ninstance in him and became later on a usual thing. (LHP I: 391)\n \nWith this we see “moral substance [Sittlichkeit] turn\ninto reflective morality [Moralität]” and\n“the reflection of consciousness into itself”. “The\nspirit of the world here begins to turn, a turn that was later carried\nto its completion” (LHP I: 407). This completion would be only\nachieved in modernity because, as we have seen, Socrates’s\nchallenging of convention in terms of resources taken from individual\nconsciousness itself was incompatible with the immediacy of\nGreek Sittlichkeit. Plato and, especially Aristotle, represent the pinnacle of ancient\nphilosophy, but this philosophy, no matter how great,\nrepresents its time, that is, the time of the Greek form of\nspirit, raised to the level of thought. Neither Plato nor Aristotle\ncan break free in thought from the contradiction between the\nconception of autonomous subjectivity represented by Socrates and the\nessential collectivity of Greek culture. Classical Greek philosophy\nwill succumb in the same way that the Greek polis succumbs to its own\ninternal contradictions, and what will eventually replace it will be a\ntype of philosophizing constrained within the doctrinal constraints of\nthe new religion, Christianity. But Christianity, as we have seen,\ngives representation to a solution to the problem of subjectivity\nencountered in the form of Socrates. Philosophy proper only thrives under conditions of\nat-homeness in the world and such conditions obtained in\nneither the Roman nor medieval world. Hegel then sees both periods of\nphilosophy as effectively marking time, and it is only in the modern\nworld that once more develops. What modern philosophy will reflect is\nthe universalization of the type of subjectivity we have seen\nrepresented by Socrates in the Greek polis and Jesus in the Christian\nreligious community. Strangely, Hegel nominates two very antithetic\nfigures as marking the onset of modern philosophy, Francis Bacon and\nthe German Christian mystic, Jacob Böhme (LHP III:\n170–216).  In the 1825–6 lectures, from there Hegel traces\nthe path of modern philosophy through three phases: a first\nperiod of metaphysics comprising Descartes, Spinoza and\nMalebranche; a second treating Locke, Leibniz and others; and the\nrecent philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Jacobi and\nSchelling. Of course the perspective from which this narrative has\nbeen written is the absent final stage within this\nsequence—that represented by Hegel himself.  Hegel concludes the\nlectures with the claim that he has tried to exhibit their (this series of\nspiritual configurations) necessary procession out of one\nanother, so that each philosophy necessarily presupposes the one\npreceding it. Our standpoint is the cognition of spirit, the knowledge\nof the idea as spirit, as absolute spirit, which as absolute opposes\nitself to another spirit, to the finite spirit. To recognize that\nabsolute spirit can be for it is this finite spirit’s\nprinciple and vocation. (LHP 1825–6, III: 212)","contact.mail":"paul.redding@usyd.edu.au","contact.domain":"usyd.edu.au"}]
