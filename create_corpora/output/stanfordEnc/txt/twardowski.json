He was a student of\n Franz Brentano\n and the founder of the\n Lvov-Warsaw School.\n His main work, On the Content and Object of Presentations\n(1894), established the need for the distinction between the content\nand the object of a presentation within Brentanian theories of the\nintentionality of mental acts. The distinction is a psychological,\nnon-platonistic counterpart of Frege's distinction between sense and\nreference. Other students of Brentano, notably Edmund Husserl and\nAlexius Meinong, integrated the distinction between content and object\nin their works after the appearance of Twardowski's book. Twardowski\nspoke of contradictory objects before Meinong: he was the first\nphilosopher to hold a theory of intentionality, truth, and predication\nin which thinking and speaking about non-existents, including\ncontradictions, involves presenting and naming non-existents,\nincluding contradictory objects. Like Meinong, Twardowski belonged to\na tradition of non-idealistic German-language philosophy that\noriginated with Bernard Bolzano, and that influenced, via G. F. Stout,\nMoore and Russell's transition from idealism to analytic philosophy.\nAfter moving to Lvov (now Lviv) in 1895, Twardowski devoted himself to\nestablishing a tradition of scientific, i.e. rigorous and exact\nphilosophy in Poland inspired by Brentano's views rather than to\npublishing his own ideas. As a result, his published oeuvre,\nwritten in Polish and German, is relatively small. Twardowski's\nunpublished manuscripts, often complete sets of lecture notes,\nconstitute a considerable part of his philosophical corpus. According\nto Roman Ingarden, assessments of Twardowski's achievements and his\nrole in history should be considered incomplete and hypothetical as\nlong as they are based only on his published writings (Ingarden 1948,\n18). Important projects for the edition and dissemination of\nTwardowski's manuscript material have been recently completed or are\ncurrently ongoing in Austria, France, Poland, Italy, and the\n Netherlands.[1]\n \n\nTwardowski was a sharp thinker and a writer of exemplary clarity. He\nwrote on signs, on meaning and reference, and on indexicality and\ntruth, defending a non-platonistic view of time-independent truth; he\nwrote on the metaphysics of parts and wholes, on ethics, on the\nhistory of philosophy, on the relation between philosophy and\npsychology, and, importantly, on metaphilosophy. In Twardowski's times\npsychology was divided roughly in two camps: ‘Wundtian’\nexperimental psychology and ‘Brentanian’ descriptive\npyschology (see the entries on\n Wundt\n and\n Brentano);\n although Twardowski sided mainly with Brentano's way of looking at\npsychology, he lectured on themes from experimental psychology such as\noptical illusion and established the first laboratory of empirical\npsychology in Poland. He developed a judgment-based theory of\nknowledge, and he valued analysis as a fruitful method in philosophy.\nThis notwithstanding, it is a widespread convinction that Twardowski's\nmost tangible success remains his extraordinary work as educator and\ninitiator of philosophical activities in Poland. Indeed, Twardowski\nwas a talented teacher, like Brentano, and he exerted, through his\nteaching, a powerful influence on generations of young Polish\nphilosophers, such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz,\nStanisław Leśniewski (who, in turn, taught Alfred Tarski)\nand Tadeusz Kotarbiński. This influence regarded first of all\nmatters of method: Twardowski laid emphasis on ‘small\nphilosophy’, namely on the detailed, systematic analysis of\nspecific problems—including problems from the history of\nphilosophy—characterised by rigor and clarity, rather than on\nthe edification of whole philosophical systems and comprehensive\nworld-views.\n\nKazimierz (or Kasimir) Jerzy Skrzypna-Twardowski, Ritter von\nOgończyk was born to Polish parents on October 20, 1866 in\nVienna, which was then the capital of the Habsburg Empire. From 1877\nto 1885 he attended the Theresian Academy (Theresianum), the secondary\nschool of Vienna's bourgeoise elite. Like many other high-school\nstudents at the time, his philosophy textbook was the\nPhilosophische Propedaeutik by Robert Zimmermann, Bolzano's\n‘favorite pupil’ (Herzensjunge). The book covered\nempirical psychology, logic, and the introduction to philosophy. \nIn 1885 Twardowski enrolled at the University of Vienna. The year\nafter he became a student of Franz Brentano, for whom he felt\n“the most sincere awe and veneration” and whom he\nremembered as “uncompromising and relentless in his quest for\nrigor in formulation, consistency in expression, and precision in the\nworking out of proofs” (Twardowski 1926, 20). In addition to\nphilosophy, Twardowski also studied history, mathematics, physics, and\nphysiology (with Sigmund Exner, the son of Bolzano's correspondent\nFranz Exner; ibid., 21). While a student, Twardowski was a close\nfriend of Alois Höfler, Christian von Ehrenfels, Josef Klemens\nKreibig, and Hans Schmidkunz—the latter initiated regular\nmeetings between younger and older students of Brentano and founded\nthe Vienna Philosophical Society in 1888. Twardowski defended his\ndoctoral dissertation, Idea and Perception—An Epistemological\nInvestigation of Descartes (published in 1892), in the Fall of\n1891. Since Brentano had resigned from his chair in 1880, Twardowski's\nofficial PhD supervisor was Robert Zimmermann. In 1891–1892\nTwardowski spent time as a researcher both in Leipzig, where he\nfollowed courses by Wilhelm Wundt and Oswald Külpe, and in\nMunich, where he attended the lectures of Carl Stumpf, another pupil\nof Brentano. Between 1892 and 1895 Twardowski earned a living working\nfor an insurance company and writing for German-language and\nPolish-language newspapers about philosophy, literature, and music\nwhile working on his Habilitation thesis, On the Content and Object\nof Presentations—A Psychological Investigation (1894), and\nteaching as Privatdozent at the University of Vienna, where he gave\ncourses in logic, on the immortality of the soul and a\npracticum on Hume's Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding. \nIn 1895 Twardowski, then 29, was appointed as extraordinarius\nat the University of Lvov (then Lemberg, now Lviv, in Polish\nLwów), one of the two Polish-speaking Universities of the\nEmpire. He saw it as his duty to export Brentano's style of\nphilosophizing to Poland and spent most of his time organizing Lvov's\nphilosophical life. He reanimated the Lvov Philosophical Circle and\ngave lectures aimed at a broader public. He organized his teaching in\ngeneral ‘core courses’ in logic, psychology, ethics, and\nthe history of philosophy (given and updated every four years), and\nplaced less emphasis on specialized courses. Further, he inaugurated a\nphilosophical seminar and reading room, where he made his private\nlibrary available to students, with whom he always maintained close\nand frequent personal contacts. Relatively many of Twardowski's\nstudents were women (among others, Izydora Dąmbska, Maria\nLutman-Kokoszyńska, and Seweryna Łuszczewska-Romahnowa, all\nof whom held philosophy chairs later). At a certain point, Twardowski\nhad managed to create three concentric circles of philosophical\ninfluence: there was the Philosophical Circle, open to all university\ndepartments, the Polish Philosophical Society (1904), open to\nprofessional philosophers, and the journal Ruch Filozoficzny,\nconceived as an organ of promotion of philosophy at large and open to\neveryone (1911). Twardowski also established a laboratory of\npsychology in 1907. As he writes, he was waging “a most\naggressive propaganda campaign on behalf of philosophy”\n(Twardowski 1926, 20). The campaign soon resulted in his lectures\nbeing moved to the Great Concert Hall of the Lvov Musical Society when\nthe number of students reached two thousand (in the mid-Twenties he\nlectured in the Apollo movie theater, at 7 a.m. in the summer and 8\na.m. in the winter, without academic quarter). All this amounted to\nthe establishment of a philosophical movement that soon became known\nas a proper school: first, until the First World War, it was known as\nthe Lvov School; then, when the Russian-speaking University of Warsaw\nagain became Polish-speaking, and Twardowski's students starting\ngetting positions and having their own students there, it was known as\nthe Lvov-Warsaw School (see\n Lvov-Warsaw School).\n The name is somewhat inaccurate, for Twardowski's students occupied\nphilosophy chairs in all post-war Polish universities, not only in\nLvov and Warsaw. As has often been pointed out, what all students of\nTwardowski had in common was not a particular set of views, but a\nrather distinctive attitude to philosophical problems informed by\nprecision and clarity that they inherited from Twardowski's general\nconception of methodology, and which he valued most highly. According\nto Jordan, Twardowski led his students \nIn this, Twardowski's students learned what he had learned from\nBrentano, namely  \nTwardowski was convinced that the philosophical way of thinking he\nadvocated, namely precision in thought and writing and rigor in\nargumentation, was directly beneficial to practical life. It was with\nthe idea of proving exactly this point—by way of his personal\nexample—that he accepted to head various kinds of committees\n(among others, the University Lectures Series, the Society for Women\nin Higher Education, the Society for Teachers in High Education, the\nFederation of Austrian Middle-School Teacher Candidates) and to be\nDean twice and Rector three times in a row (though he repeatedly\nrefused to be Minister of Education). All these activities cost him a\nlot of time: in fact, Twardowski's choice to be most of all an\neducator and an organizer left him very little time for academic\nwriting. Besides, as he reports, Twardowski wasn't much interested in\nthe publication of his ideas. Thus, since he placed high demands on\nthe clarity and the logical cogency of philosophical work, he set out\nto publish only when it was required by external circumstances\n(Twardowski 1926, 30). As a consequence, in his Lvov years, Twardowski\npublished little. He officially retired in 1930. \nTwardowski died on February 11, 1938. \nOn Twardowski's life and education in Vienna up to 1895 (as well as\nTwardowski's early activity in Lvov and Vienna's ‘war\nparenthesis’ in 1914-1915) see Brożek 2012; Twardowski's\nheritage and his achievements as an educator and organizer in Lvov,\nsee Czeżowski 1948, Ingarden 1948; Ajdukiewicz 1959,\nKotarbiński 1959 (in Polish: excerpts in English are to be found\nin Brożek 2014), Dąmbska 1978, Woleński 1989, 1997 and\n1998. With special reference to psychology, see Rzepa and Stachowski\n1993. \nTwardowski's main publication in the Vienna period is, next to his\ndoctoral dissertation Idea and Perception (1891), his\nHabilitationsschrift, On the Content and Object of\nPresentations (1894), Twardowski's most influential work.\nAccording to J. N. Findlay, Content and Object is\n“unquestionably one of the most interesting treatises in the\nwhole range of modern philosophy; it is clear, concentrated, and\namazingly rich in ideas” (1963, 8). \nIn Content and Object, Twardowski shares a number of Brentano's\nfundamental theses. Five of them are particularly relevant here.\nAccording to the first and most important thesis, the essential\ncharacteristic of mental phenomena, and what demarcates them from\nphysical phenomena, is intentionality. We can sum it up as\nfollows: \nMental phenomena, also called mental acts, fall into three\nseparate classes (second thesis): presentations\n(Vorstellungen), judgments, and phenomena of love and hate. In\nthe mental act of presentation, an object is presented; in a judgment,\njudged; in love and hate, loved or\n hated.[3]\n Next (third thesis), mental phenomena are either presentations or are\nbased on presentations. We need to present an object in order to judge\nit or appreciate it (though we do not need to judge or appreciate an\nobject that we might just present). Importantly, however (fourth\nthesis), a judgment is not a combination of presentations, but a\nmental act sui generis that accepts or rejects the object given\nby the presentation at its basis (see\n Brentano's Theory of Judgment).\n In keeping with this idea, all judgments (fifth thesis) can be aptly\nexpressed in the existential form ‘A is’ (positive\njudgment) or ‘A is not’ (negative judgment)\n(alternatively, ‘A exists’ or ‘A does\nnot exist’). In both cases, the judgment has a so-called\n‘immanent’ object, given by the presentation, which is\nsimply A. \nBoth the notion of an object ‘immanent’ in a mental act,\nas well as, in all generality, the term ‘object’ in\nBrentano's Thesis, have an ambiguous character. Are the objects of\nmental acts fully inside us or not? To correctly judge that the aether\ndoes not exist means, in Brentanian terms, rejecting the aether which\nis given to one's consciousness by a presentation. But if the aether\nis an object immanent in me, fully inside my consciousness, what does\nit mean, then, that I reject it? Is it some mental entity\ninside my consciousness that I reject? But how could that possibly be\ncorrect? In this case I most certainly have something in my head, and\nthat something exists. So it cannot be correct that I reject\nit—for, if that is the aether I reject, the\njudgment that the aether does not exist cannot be true. The aether\nshould be a physical space-filling substance, outside my\nconsciousness: that is what I am rejecting. But if that is what I\nreject, it seems something must be there for me to be able to affirm\nthat it is not there. This is very puzzling. It was fundamentally due\nto difficulties of this kind that Brentano's theory of judgment was\nsubjected, from 1889 onwards, to continuous objections by philosophers\nsuch as Sigwart and Windelband. Brentano engaged in the debate in his\ndefense, as did his pupils Marty and Hillebrand. It is in this context\nthat Twardowski's Habilitationsschrift was conceived.\nTwardowski saw that notions such as ‘the object of a\npresentation’ and ‘immanent object’ were ambiguous\nbecause in Brentano's writings the object of a presentation was\nidentified with that of content of a presentation (Twardowski 1926,\n10). In Content and Object, Twardowski set out to clarify\nexactly the relationship between the two, with far-reaching\nimplications for Brentano's original position. \nThe distinction between content and object of a presentation was not\nnew in Twardowski's time. It was the most fundamental element of\nBolzano 1837; it was later present in works of Bolzanian inspiration\n(Zimmermann 1853, Kerry 1885–1891; on Zimmermann see Winter\n1975, Morscher 1997, Raspa 1999); and it was also mentioned in works\nof Brentanian inspiration (Höfler and Meinong 1890, Hillebrand\n1891, Marty 1884–1895: article 5, 1894). Nevertheless, the\ndistinction was by no means common lore. In particular, before\nTwardowski, no Brentanian had endorsed the distinction between content\nand object in a way that offered a basis for solving the problems of\nBrentano's theory, nor had anyone among the Brentanians devoted any\nin-depth study to the issue, although the differences between\nBolzano's and Brentano's theories are such that reworking the\ndistinction in a Brentanian framework raises philosophical problems\nthat are by no means trivial. A major difference concerns the role of\nthe content of a presentation and its ontological status, since for a\nBrentanian the content of a presentation can only be something\nactually existing in one's mind. No Brentanian had thus realised in\nfull the implications that reinterpreting the Bolzanian distinction in\na Brentanian key would have. Carrying out this task, and thus helping\nBrentano's theory out of its most pressing troubles, was Twardowski's\noriginal contribution. He drew inspiration from arguments in favor of\nthe content-object distinction present in Bolzano, but he\nreinterpreted them in a Brentanian framework to sustain conclusions\nthat were opposite to Bolzano's and that were new for the Brentanians.\nOne such conclusion, and a major implication of Twardowski's theory of\nintentionality, is that there are no objectless presentations,\npresentations without an object, no matter how strange and improbable\nthat object\n is[4].\n Even presentations of contradictory objects have both content and\nobject. It is this thesis and the conclusions that Twardowski drew\nfrom it that have had a major impact on the development of Brentanian\ntheories of intentionality and that opened the way to ontologies as\nrich as that of Alexius Meinong. On the other hand, this position,\ntogether with Twardowski's identification of meaning with\npsychological content, prompted Husserl's critical reactions and led\nHusserl to the theory of intentionality set out in the Logical\nInvestigations (1900/01) where Twardowski's distinction between\ncontent and object is taken up (on this, see Schuhmann 1993; on\nTwardowski's influence and ‘triggering effect’ on Husserl,\nsee Cavallin 1990, especially 28f). Twardowski's ideas were not only\ninfluential on the continent. Via G. F. Stout, who published an\nanonymous review of Content and Object, in Mind,\nTwardowski's ideas had an influence on Moore and Russell's transition\nfrom idealism to analytic philosophy (van der Schaar 1996). \nThe aim of Content and Object is to distinguish “the\npresented, in one sense, where it means the content, from the\npresented in the other sense, where it is used to designate the\nobject” (Twardowski 1894, 4). Its main thesis is that in every\nmental act a content (Inhalt) and an object (Gegenstand)\nmust be distinguished. This distinction enables Twardowski to clarify\nthat  \nOn the basis of the distinction between content and object, Twardowski\nis in turn able to clarify Brentano's notion of ‘object immanent\n(immanentes Objekt) in a presentation’ by identifying it\nwith the notion of content, and to clarify Brentano's notion of\n‘object of a presentation’ by identifying it with the\nnotion of object. \nThe distinction between the content and the object of a presentation\nrests on a psychological or epistemic difference which is, roughly\nspeaking, the mental counterpart of Frege's distinction between sense\nand reference. The object of a presentation, says Twardowski using\nZimmermann's terminology, is that which is presented in a\npresentation; the content is that through which the object is\npresented. An important argument Twardowski gives in favor of this\ndistinction—and which strengthens the analogy with Frege's\ndistinction—is that we can present the same object in two\ndifferent ways by having two presentations with the same object but\nwith different content. Twardowski calls such presentations\ninterchangeable presentations (Wechselvorstellungen).\nThe presentation of the Roman Juvavum and the presentation of the\nbirthplace of Mozart have the same object, Salzburg; however, their\ncontent differs. To offer a rough analogy, think of an arrow pointing\nat an object: the object is what the arrow is pointing at, the content\nis what in the arrow makes it the arrow it is, that is, its being\ndirected to that object and not to another. The act is just the\n‘being directed towards’ of the arrow. Interchangeable\npresentations are like two arrows pointing at the same object. \nTwardowski thinks of the difference between act, content, and object\nin the following way. An act of presentation is a mental event which\ntakes place in our mind at a certain time. The content is literally\ninside the mind, and exists dependently on the act, as long as the act\ndoes. The object is instead independent of the mental act (1894, 1, 4;\n§7, 36), and, generally speaking, not inside one's mind, although\nin some special cases the object of a presentation might be a mental\nitem. This special case is the case in which the content of some\npresentation plays the role of the object of another presentation.\nThis is not infrequent, because any time we discuss the content of a\npresentation, describing its characteristics and its relations to\nother things, we are presenting it. And for this to be possible, the\ncontent must play the role of object in the presentation(s) we are\nhaving (what we would call second-order presentations). To use the\narrow metaphor once again, second-order presentations, then, are like\nan arrow directed towards another arrow.  \nThe way in which Twardowski relates mind and language makes the\ndistinction between content and object fairly easy to understand.\nNames are the linguistic counterpart of presentations. By\n‘names’ Twardowski means the categorematic terms of\ntraditional logic (‘Barack Obama,’ ‘The President of\nthe United States,’ ‘black,’\n‘man,’‘he’). A name has three functions:\nfirst, a name makes known that in the mind of the person using the\nname an act of presentation is taking place; secondly, a name means\nsomething; thirdly, it names an object. Twardowski takes the meaning\nof a name to be the content of the presentation that, as the name\nmakes known, is taking place in the speaker (§3), that is,\nTwardowski takes meaning to be something mental and individual. This\nholds, mutatis mutandis, also for judgments. In this sense, in\nContent and Object the semantic sphere is dependent on the\nmental sphere. This trait qualifies Twardowski's position as\npsychologistic (see\n Psychologism:\n PA3). Although his position on meaning underwent a development,\nTwardowski never adhered to a platonistic conception of meaning like\nBolzano or Frege did. \nIf all this is intuitive, why are the object and the content of a\npresentation conflated? Twardowski maintains that the reason why\ncontent and object are often identified comes, among others, from a\nlinguistic ambiguity: both the content and the object are said to be\n‘presented’ in a presentation (§4). Twardowski offers\nan analysis of the ambiguity of the term ‘presented’ by\nappealing to the linguistic distinction between modifying and\nattributive (or determining) adjectives, and he illustrates it\nwith an analogy between the act of presenting an object and the act of\npainting a landscape. When a painter paints a landscape, she also\npaints a painting: so we can say that the painting and the landscape\nare both painted. But in this situation ‘painted\nlandscape’ can have two very different meanings. In the first\nmeaning of ‘painted’, a painted landscape is a landscape;\nin the second meaning of ‘painted’ a painted landscape is\nnot a landscape, but a painting (like in Magritte's La trahison des\nimages (1928–9): it is a painted pipe we are looking at, not\na pipe). In the first case, ‘painted’ is used in an\nattributive sense (the landscape is a portion of nature that happens\nto be painted by a painter in a painting); in the second case\n‘painted’ is used in a modifying sense (that in which,\nlooking at the painting in a museum, someone may say: this is a\nlandscape!). The painted landscape in the modifying sense is a\npainting, and thus identical with the painting painted in the\nattributive sense. Analogously, in an act of presentation, the object\ncan be, like the painted landscape, said to be ‘presented’\nin two senses. The object presented in the modifying sense is\nidentical with the content presented in the attributive sense: it is\ndependent on the act of presentation, and it is what we mean by\n‘the object immanent in the act’; the object presented in\nthe attributive sense is the object of the presentation, what happens\nto be presented in a presentation, and what is independent of the act\nof presentation. \nAccording to a Brentanian conception of judgment, when we judge, the\nobject is given to us by an act of presentation. Given this fact,\nTwardowski's analysis of ‘presented’ in terms of modifying\nvs. attributive adjectives is fundamental to understand what is\nexactly ‘judged in a\n judgment.’[5]\n For it is not only in presentations that we can distinguish act,\ncontent and object, but also in judgments. When we pass a judgment, we\neither accept or reject an object through a content. All judgments\nhave a form which can be linguistically expressed as ‘The object\nA exists’ or ‘The object A does not exist.’ The\nobject of judgment (A) is what is judged in a judgment. This object is\nthe object of the presentation at the basis of the judgment, it is not\nthe content of the presentation; it is the object presented in the\nattributive sense, not in the modifying sense. The content of a\njudgment is the existence or non-existence of the object presented. It\nmight seem strange at first to hear Twardowski say that the content of\na judgment is the (non-)existence of the object, but Twardowski has\nsomething like the following in mind: we judge about the object A\nthat it exists (or that it does not exist). Twardowski's\nanalysis clarifies what is going on when we judge, in a Brentanian\ntheory of judgment, that the aether does not exist. Judging that the\naether does not exist means rejecting a physical space-filling\nsubstance outside my consciousness. The object of this judgment is not\nmental. However, this does not mean that there is nothing inside my\nconsciousness: there is a mental content, through which the aether is\npresented and judged as non-existing. That content, present in\nme, however, exists; it is the aether itself that does not exist. \nFor a theory of judgment like the one sketched above to work, the\nobject we judge must be the very object we present. Therefore,\nTwardowski's thesis must be understood in the strong sense that there\nare no presentations which do not have an object: if a presentation\ndid not have an object, we would not have an object to judge as\nexisting or non-existing. It is for this reason that a crucial part of\nContent and Object is devoted to defending this claim, and to\nshowing that, despite appearances, every presentation has an object\n(§5). This is like saying, coming back to our arrow metaphor,\nthat every arrow points at something. Twardowski's strategy is to show\nthat presentations which are normally deemed by others to be\nobjectless—i.e., arrows that do not point to anything—are\nnot such. There exist no presentations without an object: there are\npresentations whose object does not exist. Twardowski gives a number\nof arguments for his position. Of all these arguments, the key one is\nan argument based on the three functions of names in language. \nOn the basis of this reasoning and a linguistic analysis of how\n‘nothing’ functions in language Twardowski rejects\nBolzano's claim that ‘nothing’ is an objectless\npresentation by showing that ‘nothing’ is a\nsyncategorematic expression (like ‘and,’ ‘or,’\nand ‘the’) not a categorematic one. If an expression is\nnot a categorematic expression, it is not a name; but if an expression\nis not a name, it does not need to have three functions. To every name\nthere corresponds a presentation and vice versa; if an expression is\nnot a name, then there is no presentation corresponding to it. If\nthere is no presentation corresponding to ‘nothing’\nbecause ‘nothing’ is not a name, the question of its\nobject does not arise. This argument has been said to anticipate by 37\nyears Carnap's analysis of Heidegger's ‘The nothing itself\nnothings.’ (Woleński 1998, 11). The comparison should\nhowever not make one think that Twardowski shared Carnap's attitude\ntowards metaphysics (see 2.4 below.) \nAnother argument given by Twardowski for the thesis that every\npresentation has an object is based on the different ontological\nstatus of act, content, and object of a presentation. The act and the\ncontent always exist; and, in fact, they always exist together,\nforming a whole in the mind, a unified mental reality, though the\ncontent has a dependent existence on the\n act.[6]\n The object may or may not exist. Suppose you have the following\npresentations: the presentation of Barack Obama, that of a possible\nobject such as the aether, and that of an impossible object, such as a\ndodecahedron with thirteen sides or a round square. The objects of\nthese presentations (namely Barack Obama, the aether, and the round\nsquare) differ greatly, but they are still all objects. Barack Obama\nis an existing object; the aether and the dodecahedron with thirteen\nsides are non-existing objects. When we present an object such as a\ndodecahedron with thirteen sides or a round square, the object, that\nwhich is named, is different from the content because the content\nexists and the object does not. It is the object, not the content,\nthat is rejected in the negative existential judgment ‘the round\nsquare does not exist,’ for it is the object that does not\nexist; the content ‘exists in the truest sense of the\nword’ (§5, 24). \nA third argument rests on the difference between being presented and\nexisting (§5, 24). Those who claim that there are objectless\npresentations, says Twardowski, confuse ‘being presented’\nwith ‘existing.’ To reinforce his point, Twardowski offers\nseveral observations, among others, one resting on the claim that it\nis the object which is the bearer of contradictory properties, not the\ncontent. This claim will be described later by Meinong and Mally as\nthe principle of the independence of Being (existence) from Being-So\n(bearing properties). When we present an object which does not exist\nbecause it is contradictory, i.e. impossible, we need not\nimmediately notice that that object has contradictory\nqualities: it is possible that we discover this successively by\nfurther reasoning. Suppose now that only presentations with possible\nobjects are accepted. Then, Twardowski continues, the presentation of\nsomething contradictory would have an object for as long as we did not\nnotice the contradiction; the moment we discovered it, the\npresentation would cease to have an object. What would then bear the\ncontradictory qualities? Since the content can't be what bears the\ncontradictory qualities, it is the object itself that bears them; but\nthen, this object has to be what is presented.\n [7] \nThe arguments above ultimately rest on the idea that every name has\nthree functions. This assumption can also be seen, in turn, as resting\non an even more basic idea, namely that in all generality\n‘object’ equals ‘being capable to take up the role\nof object in a presentation,’ thus an object is anything that\ncan be presented; and anything that can be named by a name (§3,\n12; §5, 23; §7, 37). Yet, saying that an object is anything\nthat can be named by a name and that a name always has the function of\nnaming are two sides of the same coin, as are the claim that an object\nis anything that can be presented by a presentation and the claim that\na presentation always has an object. This cluster of correlative\nassumptions is the core of the theory. Only when this core is accepted\ncan the other claims put forward by Twardowski (namely (1) that\n‘being presented’ is not the same as\n‘existing’ and (2) that objects can possess properties\neven though they do not exist) become convincing parts of a cogent\ntheory of intentionality. One might note, however, that it is a theory\nfor which there are no non-circular arguments, for the theory is\nacceptable only to those who are already convinced that there are no\nempty names, that all categorematic terms, including ‘round\nsquare,’ ‘aether,’, ‘Pegasus,’ etc. have\nthe function of naming something, not only the function of being\nmeaningful. \nAs is known, the theory, in Meinong's version, will be the critical\ntarget of Russell's ‘On Denoting’ (1905). \nMetaphysics is importantly present in Content and Object, and\nparticularly important are the mereological considerations Twardowski\noffers. According to Ingarden, Content and Object offered\n“the first consistently constructed theory of objects\nmanifesting a certain theoretical unity since the times of\nscholasticism and of the ‘ontology’ of Christian\nWolff” (1948, 258). One cannot literally agree with Ingarden\nconsidering the Leibnizian metaphysics in Bolzano's Athanasia\n(1827)—hidden in the two-thousand pages of the\nWissenschaftslehre—and Brentano's work in mereology.\nNevertheless, if the impact of Content and Object is compared\nwith that of Bolzano's or Brentano's metaphysics, things are\ndifferent. Content and Object was a fundamental contribution to\nthe renaissance of Aristotelian metaphysics—metaphysics\nin the sense of a general theory of objects—which led to both\nMeinong's theory of objects and to Husserl's formal ontology of parts\nand wholes in the Third Logical Investigation. The story continues,\nlater, with Leśniewski's mereology and Ingarden's ontology. The\nheritage of Content and Object also includes the fact that\nTwardowski's pupils had a relation to metaphysics which was vastly\ndifferent from the approach that was typical, for instance, of the\nVienna circle (see Łukasiewicz 1936). In Poland, metaphysics was\nnot rejected as nonsense, but accepted as a respectable area of\ninvestigation to be explored using rigorous methods, including\naxiomatics (see Smith 1988, 315–6; on Twardowski and\nmetaphysics, see Kleszcz 2016) \nLike anyone in pre-set theoretical times, Twardowski has a very broad\nnotion of (proper) part, covering much more than just the pieces of an\nobject. Twardowski distinguishes material and formal parts of an\nobject. The material parts of an object comprise not only the pieces\nof an object, but also anything that can be said to be a component of\nit, such as the series 1, 3, 5 is composed of three numbers (namely,\n1, 3, and 5). Among the material parts of an object are also its\nqualities (Beschaffenheiten) such as extension, weight, color,\netc. (1894, §10, 58). The formal parts of an object are the\nrelations (Beziehungen) obtaining between the object and its\nmaterial parts (primary formal parts) as well as the relations\nobtaining among the material parts themselves (secondary formal parts)\n(1894, §9, 48 and ff.; §10, 51 and ff.).  \nIn keeping with the tradition, Twardowski calls the matter of\nan object the sum of its material parts and the form of an\nobject the sum of its formal parts. A special kind of primary formal\nparts are (relations of) properties (Eigenschaften): these are\nrelations between an object as a whole and one of its material parts,\nconsisting in the whole's having the part at issue (1894, §10,\n56). Since Twardowski accepts that among the parts of an object there\nare the relations in which that object is in, Twardowski's mereology\nis, strictly speaking, an atomless mereology: there are no simples\n(1894, §12, 74). However, we can speak of atoms if we restrict\nourselves to material parts only (for instance, in the case of the\nnumber one, we can say it is a simple object only if we consider the\n(proper) material parts it has, namely zero). \nThe distinction between content and object enables Twardowski to\nclearly distinguish conceptualizations regarding parts of the object\nfrom conceptualizations regarding the parts of the content (as special\ncases of objects). This, in turn, enables Twardowski to offer\nsophisticated considerations, leading him among others to fix clearly\nthe notion of the characteristic mark (Merkmal, nota) of\nan object. Twardowski calls elements the parts of the content\nof a presentation; he calls characteristic marks the parts of\nthe object of a presentation (§8, 46–7); the characteristic\nmarks of the object are presented through the elements of the content.\nThe content of a presentation is the collection of the presentations\nof the characteristic marks of the object of the presentation. The\nnotion of characteristic mark is a relative one because only the parts\nof an object that happen to be actually presented in the content of a\npresentation in someone's mind qualify as its characteristics. \nFor example, one can be presented with a table without thinking of the\nshape of its legs; in this case, the shape of the table legs is a\n(material, metaphysical) constituent (of second order), but not a\ncharacteristic of the table. But if one thinks, while being presented\nwith the table, of the shape of its legs, then the shape had to be\nconsidered a characteristic of the table. (§13, 86; Eng. transl.\n81). \nAccording to Twardowski, it is not possible to present all the parts\nof an object in a presentation. Given that the number of parts of an\nobject is boundless, and that we can only present a finite amount of\ncharacteristics, the number of the elements of the content is\ntherefore lower than that of the parts of the object (§12,\n78–9; on this point Twardowski is again indebted to Bolzano\n(Wissenschaftslehre, §64). It follows that no adequate\npresentation is possible of any object (§13, 83). \nLike Brentano had done, Twardowski distinguishes, with respect to\nmaterial parts, metaphysical from physical and logical parts on the\nbasis of a notion of dependence and\n separability.[8]\n However, differently from Brentano, Twardowski does not construe the\nnotion of dependence in terms of existence of the objects involved.\nHis notion of dependence needs also to be applicable to non-existing\nobjects. Consequently, Twardowski construes the notion of dependence\nof the parts of an object in terms of modes of presentability\nof the parts of an object, i.e. as existence of the parts of the\ncontent of a presentation (which always exists). The inseparability of\na part p1 from a part p2 of an\nobject O is not construed in the sense that it is not possible\nfor p1 to exist without p2\nexisting, but in the sense that in the content of the presentation of\nan object O the part that represents p1\ncannot exist without the part that represents p2\nexisting, that is, both must be elements of the content of the\npresentation of the object O. \nTwo material parts of the content of a presentation of A and\nof B are mutually separable iff A can be presented\nwithout presenting B and vice versa. Mutually separable parts\nare physical parts. For instance, the parts of the content of the\npresentations of the pages and the cover of a book are mutually\nseparable.  \nTwo material parts of the content of a presentation of A and\nof B are one-sidedly separable iff A can be\npresented without B, but not vice versa. Logical parts are\none-sidedly separable: for instance, we can have a presentation of\ncolor without the presentation of red, but not vice versa.  \nTwo material parts of the content of a presentation of A and\nof B are mutually inseparable (but yet distinguishable) iff\nthey are neither mutually nor one-sidedly separable. Metaphysical\nparts are mutually inseparable, e.g. you cannot present separately the\nbeing colored and the being extended of something colored and\nextended, although those parts are in abstracto distinguishable\nin the object. \nOn Twardowski's mereology see Cavallin (1990), Rosiak (1998) and\nSchaar (2015, 68 and ff.) \nContent and Object should be seen as part of a bigger research\naim that Twardowski had set for himself. This included developing a\ntheory of concepts and a theory of judgment. \nIn Content and Object, Twardowski had given a coherent account\nof how judgments such as ‘The aether does not exist’ work\non the basis of the systematization of the notion of ‘object of\na presentation.’ That systematization however had implications\nfor the theory of judgment which went far beyond the account of\njudgments such as ‘The aether does not exist.’ Although\nContent and Object contains little on the theory of judgment,\nTwardowski was well aware of those implications. A letter to Meinong\nis evidence that Twardowski was developing a theory of judgment which\ncontinued the work initiated by Content and Object, whose first\nmain outline can be found in Twardowski's manuscripts Logik\n1894/5 and Logika 1895/6 (Betti & van der Schaar 2004,\nBetti 2005). \nIn his ‘Self-Portrait’ Twardowski also remarks that it was\nthe question of the nature of concepts that brought him to Content\nand Object. The issue ensued from Twardowski's research on a\nparticular concept in his doctoral dissertation, Descartes' concept of\nclear and distinct perception. Since concepts are a species of\npresentations, Twardowski saw that he had first to investigate\npresentations in general, and thus to dispel the ambiguities that the\nnotion of ‘the presented’ carried with itself (Twardowski\n1926, 10). Work on concepts is to be found in the manuscript Logik\n1894/5, where concepts are defined as presentations with\nwell-defined content, in Images and Concepts (1898) and in\nThe Essence of Concepts (1924), where presentations with\nwell-defined content (i.e. fixed by a definition) are called\n‘logical concepts.’ An important role in Twardowski's\ntheory of concepts and definitions is played by the notion of\npresented judgment, i.e. judgments not really passed, but merely\npresented (in the modified sense). Twardowski's investigation of the\nnotion of (logical) concept is important to understand his attitude\ntowards objectivity and unicity of meaning, i.e. his relationship to\npsychologism on the one hand, and the role of the theorizations in\nContent and Object of two notions: that of the object of a\ngeneral presentation (which disappears for instance in Logik\n1894/5) and that of indirect presentations on the other hand. \nAmong the issues that Twardowski only sketched or left open in his\nVienna years and investigated later are, next to theories of truth and\nknowledge (Theory of Knowledge, 1925; see Schaar 2015, Chapter\n5.3), the relationship between time and truth (‘On the So-called\nRelative Truths,’ 1900) and that between linguistic meaning and\nthe content of mental acts (‘Actions and Products,’ 1912).\nParticularly important themes to mention are the relationship between\na priori or deductive sciences, a posteriori or\ninductive sciences and the notion of grounding (‘A Priori and A\nPosteriori Sciences,’ 1923), and the relation between\nphilosophy, psychology and physiology (‘Psychology vs.\nPhysiology and Philosophy’, 1897b). Well worth mentioning are\nTwardowski's writings on issues of philosophical methodology\n(‘On Clear and Obscure Philosophical Style,’ 1919/20;\n‘Symbolomania and Pragmatophobia,’ 1921). He also left a\nrelatively substantial corpus of writings in ethics (‘On Ethical\nSkepticism’, 1905-24). \nTwardowski's publications during his Lvov years are in Polish, but of\nthose writings that Twardowski considered as important academic\npublications we normally also have German versions. Especially\nimportant and influential among these are ‘On the So-Called\nRelative Truths’ (1900) and ‘Actions and Products’\n(1912).  \n‘On the So-Called Relative Truths’ (henceforth:\nRelative Truths) is a work of fundamental importance for the\ndevelopment of the idea of absolute truth in Poland. Scholars have\ndeemed its impact to have reached as far as Tarski's work on truth\n(Wolenski & Simons 1989). It certainly influenced the\n1910–1913 discussion on future contingents which involved\nKotarbiński, Leśniewski, and Łukasiewicz, which served\nlater as metaphysical foundation for Łukasiewicz's three-valued\nlogic (Woleński 1990). Twardowski's position is distinctive and\ninteresting because it is a non-platonistic theory of absolute truth,\nthough it is difficult to say exactly what place it occupies with\nrespect to Leśniewski's nominalistic or to Tarski's platonistic\napproach (for these labels see Simons 2003: section 2.) One of the\nreasons why it was important for Twardowski to defend an\nanti-relativistic notion of truth was that relativism jeopardizes the\npossibility of constructing ethics as a science based on principles\n(on Twardowski's ethics, see Paczkowska-Łagowska 1977). \nThis aspect is important because Twardowski is usually characterized\nnot as a builder of systems, but as championing ‘small\nphilosophy.’ This is correct, in some sense, but it should not\nmake one mistakenly think that there is no unity sought in\nTwardowski's thought, or that his works are separate small occasional\ncontributions without overarching ideas in the background governing\ntheir development. \nIn Relative Truths, Twardowski opposes Brentano's ideas on the\nrelationship between time and truth, and sides instead with Bolzano's\n views.[9]\n By ‘truth,’ Twardowski means a true judgment and by\n‘absolute truth’ he means a judgment true independently of\nany circumstance, time, and place. \nThe main claim of Relative Truths is that every truth (falsity)\nis absolute, i.e. no judgment changes its truth-value relatively to\ncircumstance, time, or place. Although Twardowski's treatment is\ngeneral, and is not confined to the relation between truth and time,\nit is his ideas on the latter that were particularly important for\nlater discussions. We can characterize Twardowski's view in this\nrespect as the view that a judgment is true for ever and\nsince ever, that is:  \nTwardowski's aim is to defend this claim against those who argue that\ntruth is relative on the basis of examples of elliptical sentences\n(such as ‘I don't’), sentences with indexicals (‘my\nfather is called Vincent’), sentences of general form\n(‘radioactivity is good for you’), and sentences about\nethical principles (‘it is wrong to speak against one's own\nconvictions’). Those who argue that truth is relative on this\nbasis, says Twardowski, make a mistake. They confuse judgments, which\nare the real truth-bearers, with the (type) sentences expressing them.\nBut sentences are merely the external expression of judgments, and\noften they do not express everything one has in mind when judging. For\nhuman speech has a purely practical task; it can perfectly serve its\ncommunicative purposes and yet be strictly speaking ambiguous or\nelliptic. \nTwardowski's main point is that we can disambiguate ambiguous\nsentences or integrate elliptic ones in such a way that they become\nthe appropriate means of expression of the judgment that they actually\nand strictly speaking express (Twardowski 1900, 156)—we can make\nsentences eternal, as we would say in our Post-Quinean age. Once we\nshow that eternalization is possible, the confusion on which\nrelativists rely is dispelled. For instance, if standing in Lvov on\nthe High Castle Hill, I assert that it is raining,  \nOne could object that the true sentence ‘it is raining here and\nnow’ is relative because it may become false, i.e. be true when\nuttered in Amsterdam and become false when uttered in the Dry Valley\nin Antarctica. Twardowski observes that this impression is, again,\nonly due to the ambiguity of the indexicals ‘here and now’\nin the sentence. Take thus the sentence \nwhen uttered in Lvov, on 1 March 1900, in accordance with the\nGregorian calendar, at noon, Central European Time, on the High Castle\nHill. That sentence expresses the same judgment as \nAccording to Twardowski, the difference between the two sentences is\nonly in their brevity and their practical use. Take now the\nsentence \nwhen uttered in Krakow on 2 March 1900, in accordance with the\nGregorian calendar, at noon, Central European Time, on the Castle\nHill. That sentence expresses the same judgment as \nIt's not that we have in (i) and (ii) one and the same judgment; we\nhave the same sentence, which expresses two different\njudgments, (i*) and (ii*). Therefore, one cannot argue that the\nsame judgment can turn from true to false. \nIt is apparent that [the judgment expressed by (i) and (i*)], which\n[...] asserts that it is raining, is true not only at a particular\ntime and place, but is always true. (Twardowski 1900, 153) \n[...] Only sentences can be said to be relatively true; yet the truth\nof a sentence depends on the truth of the judgment expressed by that\nsentence; usually a given sentence can express various judgments, some\ntrue, some false, and it is thus relatively true because it expresses\na true judgment only under certain conditions, i.e. if we consider it\nas an expression of a judgment which is true (Twardowski 1900, 169).\n \nNotice that Twardowski is not saying that judgments can be integrated\nor completed: the judgments we formulate in our head, and which\nare true or false, are complete and fully unambiguous. It is\nfor this reason that he can think that the procedure of completing\nsentences as expressions of judgments can be carried out.  \nAn important thing to notice in Relative Truths is that\nTwardowski, differently from what Meinong and Łukasiewicz were to\ndo, did not question the principle of contradiction or the principle\nof the excluded middle.  \nTwardowski's idea that one can have absolute truth in an all-changing\nworld has been recently taken up by Simons (2003).  \nFor quite some time Twardowski thought that logic was dependent on\npsychology\n [10],\n and continued to hold the psychologistic idea of meaning as mental\ncontent from Content and Object. In his\n‘Self-Portrait,’ Twardowski says that he changed his mind\nin an anti-psychologistic sense because of Husserl's Logical\nInvestigations\n (1900/01).[11]\n ‘Actions and Products’ (1912) is the first printed work\nwhere Twardowski favors an ‘Aristotelian’ view of ideal\nmeaning, i.e. of meaning in specie, which he associates with\nthat of Husserl's in the Logical Investigations.  \nIn marking the line of demarcation between logic and psychology on the\nbasis of the distinction act/product which underlies his theory of\nmeaning, Twardowski writes: \nTwardowski's mature theory of meaning is connected with the rigorous\ndefinition of the distinction between actions and\nproducts of actions (while in Relative Truths he speaks\nof judgments as actions or products). On the basis of grammatical\nanalyses, purporting however to show logically salient differences,\nTwardowski establishes a basic distinction between physical,\npsychical (i.e. mental), and psychophysical actions and\ntheir products. The analysis is reminiscent in philosophical style of\nthat of ‘the presented’ in Content and Object,\nthough more general, and a nice example of the method which has become\nnow strongly associated with analytic philosophy. \nThe relationship between an action and what results from it, its\nproduct, is exemplified linguistically in the relationship between a\nverb and the corresponding noun as internal complement (Twardowski\n1912, §1, 10; §8, 107):  \nA psychophysical product (e.g., a speech) differs from a mental\nproduct (e.g., a judgment) because it is perceptible to senses; it\ndiffers from a physical product (e.g., a run) because in the\npsychophysical action which produces it (speaking) a mental action is\nalso involved, which has bearing on the physical action, and thus on\nits product (§10). In some cases, a psychophysical product\nexpresses a mental product; for instance, a sentence is a\npsychophysical product which expresses a mental product, a\njudgment. \nTwardowski points out that the meaning of the noun\n‘judgment,’ like other nouns (‘mistake’), is\nambiguous between action and product. A judgment in the sense of the\naction (a judging) is a judgment in the psychological sense,\nwhile a judgment in the sense of the product is a judgment in the\nlogical sense (§14) (a third meaning of\n‘judgment’ is that of ‘disposition, aptitude to make\ncorrect judgments,’ §15). \nTwardowski points out that he uses ‘judgment’ in the sense\nof ‘judgment in the logical sense,’ i.e. the product of\nthe action of judging, and he clarifies that what he means now by\n‘judgment-product’ is the content of judgment in\nContent and Object (§24, n. 37, 117). Exactly as it was\nthe case there, the judgment exists as long as someone performs the\ncorresponding action of judging; for this reason, it is called a\nnon-enduring product (§23, 116). \nNon-enduring products do not exist in actuality separately from the\ncorresponding actions, but only in conjunction with them; we can only\nanalyze them abstractly apart from these actions. On the other hand,\nenduring products can and do exist in actuality apart from the actions\nowing to which they arise (Twardowski 1912, n. 41, 116). \nEnduring products last longer than the action which produces\nthem; they originate from a transformation or a rearrangement of\npre-existing physical material in the course of the action: footprints\nin the sand are enduring products arising from the change of\nconfiguration of grains of sand (the material) as a product of the\naction of walking applied to that material (Twardowski points out that\nthe product is not the grains of sand arranged in some way, but the\narrangement itself, §26). If actions are processes, non-enduring\nproducts are events whereas enduring products present\nthemselves as things (§ 27). Among enduring products, we\nfind physical products (such as footprints in the sand) and\npsychophysical products (such as paintings). A mental product, such as\na judgment, is never enduring (§29), but it can have its\nexpression in an enduring psychophysical product, such as a\nwritten sentence.  \nThe process of preserving non-enduring products such as judgments in\nenduring products such as written sentences is a complex one\n(§37), and goes in two steps.  \nIn step one a spoken sentence is produced which expresses a judgment,\nin such a way that the judgment is the meaning of the sentence and the\nsentence is the sign of the judgment. The process goes as follows. A\nnon-enduring mental product, a judgment (together with the action of\njudging), which is non-perceptible, gives rise—by being its\n(partial) cause—to a non-enduring psychophysical product, a\nspoken sentence, which is perceptible. In this case, the spoken\nsentence is the expression of the judgment (§30). Now, if\nthe spoken sentence becomes itself a partial cause of another\njudgment, which (we would say) is a token of the same type of the\ninitial judgment (by partially causing an action of judging which\nproduces that other judgment in another person or at a different time\nin the same person), then the spoken sentence can also count as\nthe sign of the judgment, and the judgment as the\nmeaning of the expression (§32, §34). The condition\njust sketched in the antecedent is fundamental: without it, a sentence\np might very well have been an expression of a judgment\nj once (j was a partial cause of p), but no\nmeaning is linked with p: for, if p is incomprehensible,\nnamely it is not a partial cause of another judgment j′,\nthen nothing can be said to be its meaning (§31). \nStep two is to preserve the spoken sentence (a non-enduring\npsychophysical product) in an enduring psychophysical product\ns, a written\n sentence.[12]\n When a judgment is preserved in this way, it has in the sign an\nexistence called potential. This is because the sign may at any\nmoment cause the formation of an identical or similar judgment\n(Twardowski 1912, §34), and it will be able to (partially) cause\njudgments as long as it lasts. In consequence of this,\n‘meaning’ can therefore also mean  \nOnce they are preserved in this two-step way, non-enduring products\nassume not only the illusory appearance of enduring products, but also\nof products which are somehow independent from the actions\nwhich produce them. The appearance of independence is made stronger by\nthe fact that we do as if one and the same judgment-product existed in\nall individuals, although many judgment-products are elicited\nby the written sentence-product. All these many judgments are\ndifferent from each other, but, insofar as we consider a judgment to\nbe the meaning of a sentence which is its sign \nTo this passage, Twardowski appends a note referring to Husserl's\nnotion of ideal meaning. The relationship between Husserl's and\nTwardowski's notion of meaning as well as the status of Twardowski's\nunique meaning has been and remains object of discussion (see\nPaczkowska-Łagowska 1979, Buczyńska-Garewicz 1980, Placek\n1996, Brandl 1998, Schaar 2015, 108). These matters should be\nconsidered as yet unsettled. \nThe introduction of the notion of the unique meaning of a sentence\nleads Twardowski to make a further distinction between substitutive\n(artefacta) and non-substitutive judgments. Substitutive judgments\naren't real judgments, but fictitious ones. The latter are in fact the\npresented judgments of Content and Object; the difference is\nthat in Actions and Products, Twardowski applies the concept of\nsubstitutive judgments explicitly to logic: the sentences uttered or\nwritten by logicians-at-work are not sentences which express or have\nas meanings judgments which are really passed by them, but only\npresented judgments, produced thus by actions of\npresenting—which are different actions from actual judging acts.\nThis happens for instance when a logician constructs a valid syllogism\nmade up of materially false sentences to give examples of formally\nvalid inferences (§44, 130). In this case, the logician does not\nactually judge that all triangles are square, that all squares are\nround, and that all triangles are round, but she merely\npresents the corresponding judgments. The sentences ‘all\ntriangles are square,’ ‘all squares are round,’ and\n‘all triangles are round’ are not real sentences, but\nartificial ones, because they are “expressions of artificial\nproducts that substitute for actual judgments, namely merely\nrepresented judgments” (Ibid.). The meanings of these artificial\nsentences are artificial judgments, because they are merely presented,\nnot passed. These artificial judgments are the subject-matter of logic\n(on this point, Twardowski is again indebted to Bolzano). Operating\nwith surrogate sentences such as ‘all triangles are\nsquare’ constitutes the most extreme example of “making\nmental products independent of the actions owing to which alone they\ncan truly (actually) exist” (§44, 131).  \nTwardowski's distinction between acts and products is presently being\nre-discovered in act-based theories of semantic content, within which\nTwardowski's notion of product is considered an interesting\nalternative to the notion of proposition (as the mind-independent and\nlanguage-independent content of assertions, meaning of sentences,\nprimary truthbearer, and object of propositional attitudes).
