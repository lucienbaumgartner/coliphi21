The same is true of justified\nbeliefs that may fall short of knowledge. These beliefs are justified\non the basis of some evidence, or good reasons, or experiences, or\nmaybe on the basis of the manner in which the beliefs were\nproduced.\n\n\n\nInternalism in the first instance is a thesis about the basis of\neither knowledge or justified belief. This first form of internalism\nholds that a person either does or can have a form of access\nto the basis for knowledge or justified belief. The key idea is that\nthe person either is or can be aware of this basis. Externalists, by\ncontrast, deny that one always can have this sort of access to the\nbasis for one's knowledge and justified belief. A second form of\ninternalism, connected just to justified belief but probably extendable\nto knowledge as well, concerns not access but rather what the basis for\na justified belief really is. Mentalism is the thesis that what\nultimately justifies any belief is some mental state of the epistemic\nagent holding that belief. Externalism on this dimension, then, would\nbe the view that things other than mental states operate as\njustifiers. A third form of internalism concerns the very concept of\njustification, rather than access to or the nature of justifiers. This\nthird form of internalism is the deontological concept of\njustification, whose main idea is that the concept of epistemic\njustification is to be analyzed in terms of fulfilling one's\nintellectual duties or responsibilities. Externalism with respect to\nthe concept of epistemic justification would be the thesis that this\nconcept is to be analyzed in terms other than special duties or\nresponsibilities.\n\n\n\nIn an essay on Descartes, the British philosopher H.A. Prichard said\nthat, \n\nPrichard also characterized the point in terms of knowing by\nreflection: \n\nKnowing by reflection is knowledge one achieves merely by thinking\nabout the matter at hand. Further, even if one reflects a good deal,\nPrichard holds that the knowing thereby achieved is direct knowing,\npresumably because one need make no inferences from one belief to\nanother in the activity of reflecting. \n\nPrichard is here endorsing the KK-thesis, i.e., the thesis that\nknowing implies knowing that one knows. Philosophers who endorse what\nwe can call knowledge internalism accept something akin to what\nPrichard endorses, though their main focus is slightly different. That\nis, knowledge internalism concerns not knowing that one knows, as in\nPrichard, but rather knowing or being aware of that on the basis of\nwhich one knows. For example, imagine that you know that a flock of\nCanada geese has landed in a neighborhood park in your city; and\nsuppose that you came by this piece of knowledge on the basis of and\nas a result of some testimony from another person who has just\nreturned from that park. Then knowledge internalism would be the view\nthat in knowing that the geese are in the park, one also knows or is\naware of that on the basis of which one knows, namely, one is aware of\nthe testimony on the basis of which one has knowledge of the\ngeese. Or, more plausibly, one could become aware merely by reflection\nof that on the basis of which one knows about the geese. \n\nWe can use the term ‘knowledge basis’ for that on the\nbasis of which one knows something. A knowledge basis as here\nunderstood need not be restricted to other pieces of knowledge or\nbeliefs, but could also include experiences a person has had. Using\nthis terminology, we could say that knowledge internalism is the\nthesis that a person either is aware or can be become aware of the\nknowledge basis for each item of knowledge that person may have. \n\nIt is clear that when one is aware of the knowledge basis, or when one\ncan become aware of the knowledge basis, that one thereby has a kind\nof access to the knowledge basis. Accessibility, it is often said, is\nthe core idea behind internalism, and it is also usually supposed that\nthe sort of accessibility one has is pretty much what Prichard spoke\nof, namely a kind of direct awareness that one actually engages in or\ncould engage in merely by reflection. Using these ideas we can\ncharacterize two different forms of access knowledge internalism. \n\nAccessibility KI: One knows some\nproposition p only if one can become aware by reflection of\none's knowledge basis for\np. \n\nHere we assume that the awareness spoken of in Actual Access\nknowledge internalism is the direct sort that Prichard had in mind. It\nis an awareness that is not brought about by any calculation or\nreasoning. \n\nTo illustrate and partly defend Actual Access knowledge internalism,\nimagine that you look at a tree in the park, and thereby come to know\nthat there is a tree there. We can suppose for these illustrative\npurposes that your knowledge basis is the visual experience of the\ntree, and thus that you acquire direct, non-inferential knowledge of\nthe presence of the tree. In this example, when you acquire that\nknowledge, it seems plausible to also think that you are aware that you\nare engaged in seeing, and that the content of the visual event is a\ntree. Moreover, this same sort of point will hold for all manner of\neasily acquired perceptual knowledge, including that acquired by other\nsense modalities. So, for a very wide range of cases all involving, we\nare supposing, non-inferential perceptual knowledge acquisition, actual access\nwill be quite plausible. In those cases it seems right to think that\nyou are aware of the knowledge basis, the specific perceptual\nexperience and its content, in which you engage when the knowledge is\nfirst secured. \n\nEven so, Actual Access knowledge internalism is not plausible when\ntaken in full generality, for these perceptual cases make up only a\nsmall portion of one's knowledge. We need only notice that most of\none's knowledge is stored knowledge, that is, knowledge one gained at\nan earlier time and has since retained. Imagine that a person knows\nthat Illinois was Abraham Lincoln's home state. She acquired this\nknowledge years before, while in elementary school, and has retained\nit ever since. It is most implausible to think that she is now aware\nof her knowledge basis for this knowledge about Lincoln, and this in\ntwo important senses. First, it is hardly likely that she is now aware\nof her original knowledge basis, whatever that may have been back in\nelementary school. Also, second, it is most likely that she has no\ncurrent awareness of her present knowledge basis, presumably something\nto do with ongoing stable memory. Of course, some people will have\nsuch awareness, but we should not let this fact lead us to the\nconclusion that every person with this knowledge of Lincoln's home\nstate will be aware of the workings of memory. We should, thus, reject\nActual Access knowledge internalism as implausible. \n\nMost likely, defenders of internalism about knowledge will be\nunfazed by this rejection. Much more plausible, and also much more\nlikely to be the actual view internalists have in mind, is\nAccessibility knowledge internalism. It requires only that one can\nbecome aware of the knowledge basis, either by easy and quick\nreflection in some cases, or by more difficult and lengthy reflection\nin others. What matters, however, is not the temporal length of the\nreflection, but rather that this is an awareness one can achieve merely\nby reflection. And there is something right about this, because we all\nengage in this sort of activity all the time, often with good success.\nWe can, then, focus attention on Accessibility knowledge\ninternalism. \n\nAccess to a knowledge basis can itself be thought of in two ways.\nOne might be capable of attaining awareness of what is in fact one's\nknowledge basis, but without also being capable of being aware that\nthis item is one's knowledge basis. Or, one might actually be capable\nof attaining awareness that some item is one's knowledge basis. The\ndifference is this: in the first case, one might have an awareness\ndirected at what is in fact a knowledge basis, but without realizing\nthat it is one's knowledge basis; while in the second sort of case,\none's awareness is directed at the fact that some item is one's\nknowledge basis.  \n\nBy making use of this distinction in the knowledge case, we can\nspecify two different versions of Accessibility knowledge internalism\n(AKI), a weak form and a strong form. (Hereafter it will be presumed\nthat we are speaking only of Accessibility knowledge internalism, and\nwe can speak of weak and strong AKI.) \n\nStrong AKI: One knows some\nproposition p only if one can become aware by reflection that\nsome item is one's knowledge basis for p. \n\nIn the geese example, given earlier, the weak version would tell us that one can\nbecome aware by reflection of the fact that someone has testified to\nthe presence of geese. By contrast, the strong version would go beyond\nthis and say that one can become aware by reflection that this\ntestimony counts as one's knowledge basis for one's belief about the\ngeese. \n\nThe two definitions as presently stated may be thought of as\ncomplete knowledge basis versions of knowledge\ninternalism, for they both demand a form of accessibility to all of\none's knowledge basis for any given piece of knowledge. There are,\nhowever, a great many cases where one has a multiplicity of knowledge\nbases for an item of knowledge. For instance, if one comes to know\nthat p as a result of a lengthy piece of reasoning, as in the\nconstruction of a mathematical proof with many steps, then one has\nmany knowledge bases standing behind one's knowledge that\np. Or we can think of perceptual cases where one comes to\nhave knowledge based upon a complex assortment of perceptual cues, all\nof which count as knowledge bases, but only some of which are\naccessible by reflection. It would be much too stringent a requirement\nto insist that a person must be capable of becoming aware by\nreflection of all of her knowledge bases, for every piece of\nknowledge she then possesses. If that were a requirement, then\nprobably neither weak nor strong AKI would have any plausibility at\nall. Hence, the two definitions require some amendment, which we can\neasily provide. \n\nStrong AKI: One knows some\nproposition p only if one can become aware by reflection that\nsome item k is some essential part of one's knowledge basis\nfor p. \n\nWe may think of these two definitions of knowledge internalism as\npartial knowledge basis accounts, for each requires\nonly some form of accessibility to some element or elements of one's\nknowledge basis. We will confine attention to these two partial\nknowledge basis accounts. \n\nThe use of the term ‘essential’ in weak and strong AKI is\nimportant. Imagine that one's knowledge basis for proposition\np is quite complex, including a number of different\nelements. Perhaps one has amassed a good bit of evidence concerning\np, and the cumulative effect is to make up one's knowledge\nbasis for p. It may be that some element in this evidence\nbase is inessential, in the sense that even if one were to\ndelete that element, the remaining evidence would still constitute a\nknowledge basis for p. A case like this might well arise when\none has amassed an over-abundance of evidence, perhaps with the aim of\nbeing especially careful and diligent. Without the use of the term\n‘essential’ in the above definitions, we would allow for\ncases in which a person was capable of becoming aware of what was in\nfact an inessential part of her knowledge basis for\np. This would unfairly saddle the internalist with an\nunnecessarily implausible position, and the use of the term\n‘essential’ is designed to avoid that consequence. \n\nKnowledge externalism, at least with respect to accessibility, is\ngenerally regarded as just the denial of knowledge internalism. If we\nhad rested content with knowledge internalism as we first stated it,\nwhich required some form of accessibility to all of one's\nknowledge basis, then knowledge externalism would just be the denial\nof that internalist position. But that would not be an interesting\nknowledge externalist position. For, denying that one can access by\nreflection all of one's knowledge basis for a proposition p\nis perfectly compatible with one being able to access some of one's\nknowledge basis for p, indeed some essential part of that\nbasis.  Knowledge externalism, however, wants to incorporate the idea\nthat in some cases one cannot access any of one's knowledge\nbasis.  Knowledge externalism, then, aims to deny the partial\nknowledge basis accounts. As we have two of the latter we will\nnaturally expect to find two versions of externalism with respect to\naccessibility. A weak version of accessibility externalism for\nknowledge will deny merely the strong version of AKI, thus: \n\nWeak externalism of this variety is perfectly compatible with one form\nof accessibility internalism concerning knowledge, namely weak\nAKI. Defenders of externalism, however, most likely would be\ninterested in going beyond this weak form to an externalist position\nthat is more wide-ranging. This stronger version of externalism would\nbe this: \n\nThis position is thus denying that the ability to become aware of an\nessential knowledge basis is a necessary condition on having knowledge.\nThe proponent of strong AKE can allow that in some cases one might have\nthis ability. Her denial is that one has it in all cases, for each\npiece of knowledge one happens to possess. \n\nStrong AKE is so called because it rejects even the weak version of\nknowledge internalism. And since weak knowledge internalism is included\nin strong knowledge internalism as a part, as per comments made above\nconcerning statements A and B, we may say that strong AKE also rejects\nstrong knowledge internalism. Put more generally, we can say that\nstrong AKE rejects knowledge internalism across the board. \n\nKnowledge internalism and externalism have been less extensively\ndiscussed in recent literature than justification internalism and\nexternalism. These two opposing theses focus on justified belief\nrather than knowledge, though there are close parallels. Consider\nagain the Canada geese example, and suppose that the testimony you\nreceive from another person produces in you the justified belief that\nthere are geese in the park. We may also suppose that this justified\nbelief falls short of knowledge. We can say that a justifier\nfor this belief is the testimony one has received from the other\nperson. Here a justifier is an analog of what was termed above\na knowledge basis and, as in the latter case, we will allow\nthat justifiers can be other beliefs, or experiences, or facts about\nthe production of the belief. Philosophers take different stances on\nwhat legitimate justifiers may be, so that it is difficult to come up\nwith an account of justifiers that is neutral between competing\ntheories of epistemic justification. It will not do to say that\neverything relevant to a person's justified belief at some time counts\nas a justifier for that belief. For that would count possession of the\nconcepts that are necessary for one to understand a belief that p as\namong the justifiers for that belief, and clearly that would be a\nmistake. Instead, we can say this: The justifiers for a given\njustified belief are those items that make up or constitute the\nperson's justification for that belief at that time. They are those\nitems, whether experiences, states of affairs, or other beliefs, on\nwhich the person's current justification is based. (the term\n‘justifier’ comes from Alston 1989, 189). \n\nWhen one has a justified belief, one is sometimes also aware of the\njustifiers for that belief. And perhaps, for any justified belief and\naccompanying justifiers, one can become aware of the justifiers, and do\nthis merely by reflection. This is the core idea behind justification\ninternalism. As with knowledge internalism, this core idea has to do\nwith a form of access, in this case access to the justifiers. Further,\ncontinuing the parallel with knowledge internalism, justification\ninternalism can be construed as having weak and strong forms: weak and\nstrong accessibility justification internalism. We may here safely\nassume that access internalism concerning justification will\nbe no more plausible that its cousin regarding knowledge, discussed\nabove; hence, access internalism regarding justification will be passed\nover in favor of versions stressing accessibility rather than actual\naccess. \n\nStill, there is the question of whether justification internalism\ndemands accessibility of all of the justifiers for a given\njustified belief or only some of them. Discussions of justification\ninternalism have tended to focus on the former of these. Here are some\npassages that point in this direction. \n\nWe presuppose, second, that the things we know are justified for us in\nthe following sense: we can know what it is, on any occasion, that\nconstitutes our grounds, or reason, or evidence for thinking that we\nknow. (Chisholm 1977, 17; quoted in Alston 1989, 212.) \n\nThe most explicit statement of this view comes from Carl Ginet: \n\nIn line with these sentiments, we could define two concepts of\naccessibility justification internalism, analogous to knowledge\ninternalism that requires accessibility of the complete knowledge\nbasis. We would have these two theses: \n\nStrong AJI: One has a justified belief\nthat p only if one can become aware by reflection that some\nitem j makes up all of one's justification\nfor p. \n\nWith strong AJI as just given, the item j might be a single\njustifier, perhaps a single previously justified belief; or it might\nbe a complex, taking any number of contributing justifiers as\nelements, as would be the case with a complex of many previously\njustified beliefs making up one's evidence for p. What is to\nbe stressed is that in both weak and strong AJI as here defined,\nability to access all of the justifiers is required; this is a demand\nfor accessibility of the complete justification basis, we might say,\non a par with the earlier discussion of a complete knowledge\nbasis. These are, then, complete justifier accounts of weak\nand strong AKI. \n\nIt is unlikely, however, that these two forms of justification\ninternalism will stand up to close scrutiny. To see this, consider a\ncase of rapid acquisition of many justified beliefs at a single moment\nor in a very short and hurried period of time. We need only think of\nsome emergency situation where very swift reactions are needed, and\nwhere the presence of the emergency is based upon a host of sensory\ncues. In such cases a person will often acquire a battery of justified\nbeliefs, all pretty much in an instant of time, and quick action on\nthose beliefs is necessary to avert some disaster or other unwanted\nconsequence. Certainly the person cannot access, at the acquisition\nmoment, all of the justifiers for each of these newly acquired\njustified beliefs; she is too busy taking steps to avert the disaster.\nNor should we think that she will be able to access all of the\njustifiers for those beliefs at a later, and calmer time; for, however\ngood her memory might be, it is just unrealistic to suppose that each\nperson will be able to recall all of those justifiers for every one of\nthose justified beliefs. This would be too great a demand to place on\nmemory in the interests of an epistemological theory. It is better to\ngive up the epistemological theory in favor of something more\nfeasible.  Such a view is easy enough to come by; we simply weaken\nthings to yield partial justifier accounts of justification\ninternalism. \n\nStrong AJI: One has a justified belief that p\nonly if one can become aware that some item j is an essential\njustifier one then has for p. \n\nWe thus see that weak and strong internalism regarding justification\nare straight analogs of weak and strong internalism regarding\nknowledge. Further, these versions of justification internalism are\nmuch more plausible than the complete justifier versions of\njustification internalism. It is, after all, easier for just about any\ncognizer to access some essential justifier in any given case than it\nis to access all of them. \n\nAnother important point concerns the time at which one does or could\nbecome aware of essential justifiers. We have hitherto spoken as\nthough the internalist is demanding that each cognizer have the\nability at any given moment to then become aware of\nessential justfiers for each of her justified beliefs. There is no\nreason why internalism should be understood in this fashion. To see\nthe point, imagine that some essential justifier j, for\nbelief b, itself has five sub-elements, where each of these\nis an essential justifier. Perhaps the cognizer can become aware, by\nreflection, of two of these elements of j at a single time,\nbut become aware of the remaining three only after much reflection\nlasting some period of time. Nothing in the internalist picture should\nrule this out. What is essential is that the awareness be achieved by\ndirect reflection, and not that it all occur at a moment. \nMichael Bergmann (2009) gives a definition that is akin to Strong\nAJI. It is this: \nWhat Bergmann takes as the relevant contributing factor is what was\ncalled in Strong AJI a justifier, though his definition does not\nrequire that the contributing factor be essential to the justification\nfor belief B. Some defenders of access internalism might object that\nthey are not committed to the potential awareness of a contributor to\njustification being relevant to the appropriateness of holding the\ntarget belief, as specified in PDSAR. However, this issue will not be\na factor in what follows. \nExternalism with regard to justification is also analogous to\nknowledge externalism. That is, the weak form of justification\nexternalism is a thesis that merely denies strong AJI, and is\nperfectly compatible with weak AJI. More interesting is strong\njustification externalism, or strong AJE, namely: \n\nThe idea here is that it is false that one is always in a position to\naccess at least one justifier for each one of one's justified beliefs;\nin some cases, one is unable to access by reflection any of the\njustifiers, and this fact does nothing to impugn or weaken one's\njustification for the belief. For an illustration, think again of the\nemergency situation where one gains a number of beliefs nearly all at\nonce, all of them justified by a number of different justifiers. It is\nplausible to think that in some cases of this sort, one is unable to\naccess merely by reflection any of the justifiers, either at the\nmoment of belief acquisition or at any later time. Notice that strong\nAJE does not contend that one is never able to access\nrelevant justifiers. It claims instead that there are some cases where\none cannot become aware by reflection of any of one's justifiers for a\nbelief that p, and that this fact does not undercut one's\njustification for believing that p. \n\nOne way to see the import of the externalist position regarding\njustification is by means of examples. The case described earlier\nwherein one gains a great number of justified perceptual beliefs all in\na short and very compressed time span seems appropriate to this purpose.\nAnother method for getting a sense of the externalist position is by\nconsideration of a theory of epistemic justification that is consistent\nwith it. A simple version of the reliable process theory of\njustification will illustrate the point (see Goldman 1979, for\na classic statement): \n\nIn this illustrative context we may think of the reliability of\nM as the actual frequency with which true beliefs are\nproduced or sustained by M. If more true beliefs have been\nproduced or sustained by M than false beliefs, then\nM is reliable. The main point for present purposes is this:\nbeing so produced or sustained suffices for justification of\nbelief. Nothing more is required, either of the process M or\nthe epistemic agent S. Since this is so, then\nnothing further is required concerning accessibility\nto S of any of her justifiers for belief that\np.  \n\nThis theory is illustrative only. No defender of a reliable process\ntheory of justification is apt to regard reliability as determined\nmerely by the actual frequency of true versus false belief production\nor sustenance. Instead, reliability would be thought of as a\npropensity that a method M has to produce or sustain\nmostly true beliefs. This important point about how to best understand\nreliability, however, will not affect the point just made concerning\nreliable process theories and externalism regarding justification.\nExactly the same argument will apply when reliability is understood as\na propensity. Reliability of that sort as applied to process\nM will suffice for the belief to be justified..\nAccessibility via reflection to any of the justifiers, if present as a\ncapability in S, will not be relevant to her being justified\nin believing p, and neither will the absence of such a\ncapability. So, if the reliable process theory as here depicted is\ncorrect as an account of justified belief, then internalism regarding\njustification would be false. This point about lack of access to\njustifiers is the main contention of the externalist thesis regarding\njustification. (The actual long run frequency and propensity\ninterpretations of reliability were clearly noted in Goldman 1979,\n11. Reference to justifiers is not there made by Goldman; that term\ncame into use about a decade later in work by Alston.  Goldman gives\nmore refined and complex statements of the theory, making use of\nJ-rules, in Goldman 1986, 2009.)  \n\nIt might be thought that one's view as to exactly what sorts of\nthings count as justifiers will also determine whether one is committed\nto justification internalism or justification externalism. This\nquestion is bound up with another way of drawing the distinction\nbetween internalism and externalism, namely, with the view that\nrestricts justifiers to items that are literally internal to the\ncognizer. One version of this position is perspectival\ninternalism, to use a phrase coined by William Alston, which in\none of his formulations comes to this: \n\nThese other justified beliefs, of course, would be the justifiers, and\nsince they are beliefs that the person S has, they count as\ninternal to S in the sense that they are internal to\nS's overall mental framework. \n\nClosely related to perspectival internalism is a somewhat broader\nthesis according to which all justifiers are mental states of\ncognizers. This thesis has been termed “mentalism” by Earl Conee\nand Richard Feldman. Making use of some ideas suggested by Matthias\nSteup, John Pollock, and Ernest Sosa, they say that this version of\ninternalism, \n\nMentalism is broader than PI because it does not restrict the\njustifiers to justified beliefs, nor even to beliefs. So, mentalism but\nnot PI is perfectly compatible with a view that says that sensory\nstates that are themselves not beliefs and not things that can be\nappropriately said to be justified can nonetheless function as\njustifiers. A very simple example that illustrates the difference would\nbe one in which a person acquires a justified belief that there is a\ntomato in front of her on the basis of a perceptual experience of\nsomething looking red and spherical. Mentalism can allow that this very\nexperience of something looking red and spherical is a justifier for\nthe belief that there is a tomato present. For PI, by contrast, if this\nexperience is to contribute to the justified tomato belief, it would\nhave to be because one has a justified belief about something appearing\nred and spherical. In short, mentalism allows that the very experience\nmay count as a justifier, while PI requires that a justified belief,\npresumably about that experience, is the appropriate justifier. \n\nA somewhat weaker form of mentalism would maintain only that for\neach justified belief a person has, some essential justifiers for that\nbelief are mental states of that person, but that other essential\njustifiers for that belief need not be mental states. Such an account\nwould not be a wholly internalist account, of course, in either the\nmentalist sense or the accessibility sense, for these further essential\njustifiers need be neither mental states nor particularly accessible to\nreflective awareness. The account would rather be one that contained\nboth some internalist elements (some essential justifiers are mental\nstates) and some externalist elements (some essential justifiers are\nnot mental states). The result would count, therefore, as a mixed\ntheory, though the theory might be otherwise perfectly viable as a\ngeneral account of justified belief. \n\nSince externalism with respect to justification contrasts with\ninternalism, we should expect there to be an externalist contrast to\nmentalism. The denial of mentalism would simply be the view that holds\nthat something other than mental states of a cognizer can qualify as\ngenuine justifiers. Once again we can illustrate such a position by\nconsidering a reliable process theory of justification. On that theory\nreliability is defined across mental states, so one might think that\nthe theory is either mentalist or that at least it strongly overlaps\nthe mentalist doctrine. That is, the theory directs our attention to\nbelief-formation processes and belief-sustaining processes, and both\nof them take some mental states as inputs and yield other mental\nstates as outputs. The simplest version of the former might be a\nperceptual case in which the inputs are sensory states and the outputs\nare beliefs. Or, if one thinks of the process of reaching a new belief\nthrough reasoning, the inputs are some prior beliefs and the outputs\nare new beliefs. The difference between this theory and mentalism\ncomes in the fact that for reliabilism the inputs and outputs, though\ncertainly mental, are not themselves justifiers. These inputs\nare, of course, highly relevant to the justification of the\nbelief. However, this relevance does not suffice to make the inputs\njustifiers, any more than possession of relevant concepts needed to\nunderstand a belief would count as a justifier for that\nbelief. Rather, it is the reliability of the processes in which these\ninputs and outputs figure that count as appropriate justifiers. So, in\naddition to being an externalist theory with regard to accessibility,\nthe reliable process theory is externalist with regard to whether the\njustifiers for a belief are or have to be mental states. The\nexternalist with regard to this issue insists that they need not\nbe. \n\nThere is one additional view that is often thought of as internalist\nin epistemology, namely the idea that the concept of justification is\na deontological concept. In saying this, what is meant is\nthat being epistemically justified in believing something is bound up\nwith, or to be analyzed in terms of, one's living up to one's\nintellectual duties or responsibilities. We can easily think of cases\nwhere justification and obligation seem to be closely connected. When\na scientist runs an elaborate experiment in the attempt to confirm\nsome hypothesis H, and she gathers more and more evidence\nthat tends to bear on and confirm H, we tend to suppose that\nshe has an intellectual duty or obligation to follow the evidence\nwherever it goes and to believe in accord with that evidence. She\nshould not tailor her beliefs, in other words, to non-evidential\nfactors such as her desire to believe something incompatible with\nH, or her emotional attachment to some proposition\nincompatible with H. Nor should one's religious or political\nbeliefs get in the way; one's intellectual duty is to follow the\nevidence and to believe in accord with it, even in cases where the\nevidence seems to overthrow a proposition one would dearly like to see\nconfirmed. \n\nOne may well wonder why the thesis that the concept of epistemic\njustification is deontological has any connection to internalism. That\nthe justification of a belief is a matter of living up to one's\nintellectual duties, after all, has no obvious bearing on\naccessibility to the justifiers for any given belief, nor to any\nspecial view as to the nature of those justifiers, such as may be\ngiven in mentalism. This question is addressed more fully below. At\nthis point what we can say is that the deontological concept of\njustification has some internalist component because it seems related\nto a kind of control over beliefs that the epistemic agent may be\nthought to have. If one is intellectually obligated to take on a\nbelief given one's evidence, then one must be capable of doing\nso. This point is underwritten by the general principle that Ought\nimplies Can, i.e., one has an obligation to do action A\nonly if one can do A. If one has the ability to take on new\nbeliefs given one's evidence, then one has some form of control over\nbelief formation, a control that is lodged in the epistemic\nagent. This is the sense of “internal” ingredient in the\ndeontological conception of justification, and it is this that makes\nthat concept a species of epistemic internalism. \n\nIt is now easy to see what the corresponding form of externalism\nwith respect to the concept of justification would be. It would be an\naccount of that concept that steers completely clear of talk of\nintellectual duties or responsibilities, but instead analyzes the\nconcept of justification in some other way, perhaps in terms of degree\nof evidential support or in terms of being truth-conducive. \n\nWe have isolated three different forms of internalism regarding\njustification, and it is natural to ask how, if at all, they might be\nrelated to one another. Accessibility internalism, for example, seems\nto be strongly related to mentalism. If we ask, what might qualify as\naccessible by reflection, it is difficult to see what else there might\nbe except for one's own mental states. The relationship between these\ntwo forms of internalism is not apt to be entailment; for, it is at\nleast conceivable that one has access via reflection to some state of\naffairs in the non-mental world. Still, we may safely say that if\naccessibility internalism is true, this is evidence in favor of\nmentalism. \n\nThe evidence is particularly strong if we focus on complete\njustifier versions of accessibility internalism. On that view it\nis held that all of the justifiers for any given belief are\naccessible by reflection. If it is true in fact that\neverything that is accessible by reflection is a mental state, then\nmentalism will follow directly from this fact coupled with complete\njustifier internalism. With a partial justifier account of\naccessibility internalism, which we noted earlier is the more plausible\ninternalist position, matters are different. On that view it is\nrequired that the cognizer merely be able to access by reflection\nsome of the justifiers for any given belief. Hence, this\nposition will permit cases in which the justifiers that are accessible\nby reflection are all mental states, but other inaccessible justifiers\nare not. Mentalism, though, is a view about the character of\nall of the justifiers, to the effect that all justifiers are\nmental states. So, while we can agree that a partial justifier account\nof accessibility internalism is evidence for mentalism, the evidence is\nnot as strong as one might initially expect. \n\nNeither does mentalism entail accessibility internalism. It is a\nfamiliar point that not all of one's mental states are accessible, but\nthat some are only brought to conscious awareness by medical\nprocedures. Moreover, the example used earlier in which one gains a\nmultitude of new justified beliefs in a rapidly changing perceptual\ncontext, all backed by a variety of sensory justifiers, strongly\nsuggests that there will be many justifiers that will not be accessible\nvia reflection even though they are mental states. So mentalism might\nwell be correct even when accessibility internalism is not. \n\nThere would be a tight connection between mentalism and\naccessibility internalism if all of the mental states that are\njustifiers for beliefs were occurrent mental states. That is, if all of\nthese states were attentively before the mind when one held a justified\nbelief, then those states would then be accessible via introspection.\nHere we assume that if some mental state occurrently exists or obtains\nat some time, then one can turn one's attention to that state at that\ntime. However, occurrent justifiers make up but a tiny percentage of\nthe justifiers standing behind the large numbers of justified beliefs\nany person will have at any time. Any adult cognizer, for instance, is\napt to have many thousands of justified beliefs at any moment, with\nvery few if any of them occurrent at a given time, and all of them\nbacked by justifiers. If all of these justifiers are mental states, as\nmentalism contends, most of them would be buried deep in one's mental\nstorehouse, beyond the reach of reflective awareness. \n\nA possible response to this line of thought would be to point out\nthat typically a person can think of a justification for her justified\nbeliefs, even for cases where one's justified beliefs and their\nrespective justifiers have been stored in the mind for a long time.\nConsider again the case of one's justified belief that Illinois was\nLincoln's home state. For most people this belief is justified, but\nhardly ever occurrent, and neither are its justifiers. On an occasion\nwhen the belief is occurrent one may be able to supply a\njustification for it. For instance one might note that one must have\nlearned this fact in elementary school, and that one had entertained\nthis fact on earlier occasions since the belief was first acquired.\nThese are thoughts one has on the present occasion and so are mental\nstates; and they are items of awareness and thus accessible to\nreflective awareness. So even when the justifiers that are mental\nstates are not directly accessible, we might think, some justifiers are\nalways available to reflection, because we can think of what would\nserve to justify current beliefs. So mentalism does after all entail\naccessibility, because one can always provide or think of a\njustification. \n\nIt cannot be denied that people very often can supply justification\nfor their beliefs. It can be wondered, however, whether this is always\nso. Supplying a justification is a fairly sophisticated activity, and\nmany children would be poorly equipped to engage in it. Yet surely\nthese children have justified beliefs. Another perhaps more\nfundamental point is this: it is not clear that the justification one\nwould supply on some occasion constitutes the set of justifiers one\nthen has for that belief. In the case at hand, one is now justified in\nbelieving that Illinois was Lincoln's home state. Further, one has\nbeen justified in believing this for some time, including the time\nperiod immediately before one attempted to supply a\njustification. Hence, prior to making that attempt, one already has,\nor there already are in place, some justifiers for that belief about\nLincoln. The only alternatives to thinking this would be to say either\nthat on this occasion, prior to supplying a justification, nothing\njustifies one's belief about Lincoln, though the belief itself is\njustified nonetheless; or that the belief is not justified, contrary\nto appearances. Neither of these possibilities seems at all plausible,\nhowever, so we need to allow that there are some justifiers for the\nLincoln belief prior to and independently of one's attempt to think up\na justification. Indeed, the most natural thing to say about thesse\ncases of justified beliefs of long standing is that the fact that\nthese beliefs have been stored in memory is what makes up their\njustification.  Thus, even if we presume that every cognizer is always\nin a position to provide a justification, this point does not serve to\nshow that mentalism entails accessibility internalism. (Goldman 2009,\n323, has a good discussion of memory preservation in relation to\ncases like that of the belief that Illinois was Lincoln's home\nstate. Goldman also discusses problems that may arise for the memory\npreservation account.) \n\nThe deontological concept of justification could be conjoined with\neither accessibility internalism or with mentalism. But these latter\ntwo forms of internalism are not logically connected to the\ndeontological concept. Advocates of the deontological concept of\njustification are defending a thesis concerning the meaning of the\nterm ‘justified,’ and by itself this thesis concerning the\nmeaning of the term has no implications for what the actual justifiers\nmay turn out to be. Hence, if it were a fact that the concept of\nepistemic justification is deontological, this fact would not imply\nmentalism.  Nor does mentalism entail the correctness of the\ndeontological concept.  For mentalism is compatible with a concept of\njustification defined in terms of degree of evidential support, or\nadequacy of evidential support, and there is nothing particularly\ndeontic about either of these ideas. Exactly the same may be said of\naccessibility internalism.  It readily conjoins with a concept of\njustification of either of these evidential sorts, and so\naccessibility internalism does not entail that a deontological concept\nof justification is correct. \n\nThe reverse may be true, however. That is, if justification is\nreally a deontological concept, this fact may have implications for\naccessibility. Further, since we saw earlier that accessibility\ninternalism is some evidence for mentalism, the correctness of the\ndeontological concept would also have some bearing on mentalism. This\nline of thought is taken up in the next two sections, where arguments in\nfavor of various forms of internalism are considered. \n\nOne line of argument that can be offered in favor of accessibility\ninternalism, though one that has seldom found explicit expression in the\nliterature, trades on the idea that one is justified in believing\np only if one has justified the belief that\np. (Leite 2003 discusses the connection between being\njustified and justifying.) Justifying a belief, of course, is an\nactivity in which one adduces evidence or reasons in favor of the\nbelief, and when one is engaged in this activity one is actively aware\nof the evidence or reasons brought forward. Of course, if one actually\nis aware of these bits of evidence or reasons, then certainly one can\nbe aware of them. These items of evidence or reasons offered in the\nact of justifying, we may say, are the justifiers for the belief in\nquestion. Hence, if being justified implies having\njustified, then being justified implies that one can be aware of the\njustifiers. So, we might conclude, the mere fact that there are\njustified beliefs implies accessibility internalism. \nThere are, however, two important problems with this argument.\nFirst, the major premise of the argument seems false. A very large\npercentage of one's of justified beliefs were never justified in the\nmanner envisioned. We need only recall the example of rapid acquisition\nof many perceptual beliefs, all of them justified. But none were\njustified by any activity engaged in by the cognizer, either at the\nmoment of acquisition or at any later time. Moreover, second, even if\neach justified belief was at some time justified, this fact implies\nonly that there was some time at which the cognizer could be aware by\nreflection of the relevant justifiers. It hardly follows that the\ncognizer can be reflectively aware of these justifiers at any time she\ncares to try, and it is this sort of accessibility that internalism\nrequires. If accessibility internalism were merely the thesis that for\neach justified belief p, there is some time at which the cognizer can\nbe aware of the essential justifiers for the belief that p, then\naccessibility externalism would become the thesis that there is\nnever a time at which the cognizer can be reflectively aware\nof the relevant justifiers. Yet the externalist position is the much\nmore modest point that there are some cases of justified belief where\nthe cognizer is unable to be reflectively aware of the essential\njustifiers. Defense of accessibility internalism on the grounds that\nbeing justified implies having actually justified would make\nexternalism into far too strong a thesis. \n\nAnother possible argument for accessibility internalism trades on\nbeing able to justify one's belief. The idea is that one is justified\nin believing p only if one can justify the belief that\np. If one were to actually engage in justifying this belief,\nthen at that time one would be aware of the justifiers. So, if one can\njustify the belief that p, it is reasonable to think that one\ncan be reflectively aware of the justifiers for p. \n\nHere, again, we would have to contend with the examples of young\ncognizers who certainly have justified beliefs but are in no position\nintellectually to justify those beliefs. They simply lack the\ncognitive wherewithal to engage in that sort of activity, but this\nfact does not prevent them from having beliefs that are\njustified. Thus, the core idea in this argument for internalism is\nfalse. There is also another problem, even if the core idea could be\nsustained. Any activity of actually justifying a belief is context and\naudience sensitive. What one would say by way of justifying the belief\nthat p in a context of one sort, made up of an audience of\nhighly sophisticated cognizers, is apt to be quite different from what\none would say in a different context and to an audience of quite\nnaïve cognizers. For this reason, it is difficult to say which if\nany of the things one would offer in an activity of justifying would\nactually constitute the set of justifiers for the given belief. What\none would identify as justifiers in such activities would be subject\nto such variability, that it is hard to see how we could select any\nsub-set of such items and safely maintain that they are the\njustifiers. \n\nThe last two arguments, making use of the idea, first, that being\njustified implies having justified, and then second, that being\njustified implies being able to justify, may be taken to show a key\nway that defenders of accessibility internalism may conceive of\njustified belief or knowledge. The paradigm they may have in mind is\nthat being justified in believing that p is a state one\nachieves by working things out, reasoning through some sequence of\nevidentiary steps and then drawing a conclusion that counts as the\njustified belief. When one engages in reasoning of this type one is\naware of the steps through which one reasons and, inter alia,\nalso aware of the justifiers that serve to support one's\nconclusion. Following this line of thought, it is perhaps natural to\nthink that one can recapitulate at a later time the reasoning one went\nthrough enroute to one's justified belief. If this is so, then surely\none can justify one's belief, and thus be reflectively aware of the\njustifiers for that belief. \n\nIt cannot be denied that one often arrives at beliefs, including\njustified ones, in just this fashion. It should also be clear, however,\nthat a great many beliefs, including many justified ones, are not\nacquired or sustained in this manner. We need only remind ourselves of\nhow much knowledge and justified belief is gotten from perceptual\nexperience and we then realize that a great many items of knowledge and\njustified belief are not arrived at via reasoning, however generously\nwe construe that operation. \n\nA general argument for accessibility internalism has been proposed on\nbehalf of the internalist, and this reconstructed argument has the\nmerit of being extendable to mentalism (Goldman 1999; note that\nGoldman is well-known for defending externalism and is thus no friend\nof internalism).  Internalists often adopt a specific deontological\nposition, namely a “belief-guidance” position, or\na guidance deontological concept (GD concept). The idea\nbehind GD is that one ought to guide the formation of one's beliefs by\nthe amount and strength of the evidence one has on hand, and this\ncertainly has a deontological ring to it. This guidance theme is\nslightly different from what we have identified as the deontological\nconcept of justification, for that is a thesis about what ‘being\nepistemically justified’ means. The GD conception, on the other\nhand, is a thesis about how a person ought to go about forming her\nbeliefs. With this distinction drawn, the general argument for\ninternalism is straightforward: \n\nIn the terms that have been used in this paper, what is\ngestured toward in step (3) by saying that “justification must be\na purely internal affair” is just mentalism as we have construed it.\nAnd plainly a form of accessibility internalism is what is being noted\nin (2), though this argument does not distinguish between whether all or only\nsome of the justifiers (determiners) are to be accessible. The\ninference from (2) to (3), however, certainly seems to suppose that\naccessibility internalism implies mentalism, a move that was found\nquestionable earlier in this article. \n\nThe point about complete justifier accounts matters for the evaluation\nof this argument for internalism. As we noted earlier, complete\njustifier accounts of accessibility internalism provide strong support\nfor mentalism. If complete justifier accounts were considered, premise\n(3) would have some ring of plausibility. However, we have seen,\ncomplete justifier versions of accessibility internalism are too\nstrong; and, partial justifier accounts considerably weaken the\nsupport for mentalism. Considering premise (3) in the light\nof partial justifier accounts of accessibility, we would have\nto say at once that (3) is false. Partial justifier accounts do not\neven provide strong support for mentalism, let alone imply it. \n\nThere is also a problem with premise (1), concerning the GD conception\nof justification. While it is true that some philosophers who have\naccepted internalism, of either the accessibility or mentalist\nforms, have also accepted this GD conception, they\nneed not do so. Indeed, some leading internalists explicitly\nreject the GD conception and any deontological concept that is\nproposed as an analysis of the concept of justification, and yet this\nfact has no effect on their one important form of internalism, namely\nmentalism (Conee and Feldman 2001). These comments reinforce the\ncomments made earlier to the effect that the deontological concept of\njustification is really independent of accessibility internalism and\nmentalism. \n\nIf accessibility internalism is not to be defended by means of\nsomething like the general argument presented here, then it is most likely\none would have to fall back on the arguments given earlier concerning\neither actually justifying a belief or being capable of justifying that\nbelief. As we saw, those arguments break down, thereby leaving\naccessibility internalism wholly unsupported. There is another argument for access internalism, one which\nstresses having reasons. This argument is presented as a case against\nexternalist accounts of justification and it utilizes examples of\nsubjects who are clairvoyant. In one such example we have a person,\nNorman, who arrives at his belief that the President is in New York\nCity through some clairvoyance process, and we may presume that this\nbelief is true. Norman's exercise of clairvoyance may generally yield\ntrue beliefs in Norman, not just about the President's whereabouts,\nand so clairvoyance, for him, is a reliable belief-forming process,\nand the externalist would have to count Norman's belief about the\nPresident's location as justified. Even so, one can plausibly say,\nNorman is irrational in “accepting beliefs whose provenance can only\nbe a total mystery to [him], whose status is as far as [he] can tell\nno different from that of a stray hunch or arbitrary conviction”\n(BonJour and Sosa 2003, 32; quoted in Bergmann 2006, 12)  What would make the cognizer's belief rational would be if he or\nshe were to have good reasons for holding the believed proposition to\nbe true. The cognizer may well have reasons for a belief, and these\nreasons may provide some measure of justification for that belief. If\nand maybe only if, the cognizer also has has some awareness of these\njustifying reasons, or the capacity to have such awareness of these\nreasons, will she have some reason to believe the believed proposition\nis true. So, we could conclude that access internalism is quite\nplausible after all, because it is quite plausible to maintain that a\nperson's justification for a belief depends squarely on having reasons\nto believe that the believed proposition is true. Possession of these\nreasons would insure that the belief is not merely a \"stray\nhunch.\" The argument about having reasons for belief is thus both an\nargument against externalism, and also strong support for endorsing\naccess internalism. If we focus just on that aspect of this argument\nthat is aimed at externalism, we have what has been called the\n‘Subject's Perspective Objection’ (SPO), viz., \nNevertheless, despite the great intuitive appeal of the SPO, and the\nsupport it provides for access internalism, a dilemmatic argument\nmay amount to an insurmountable obstacle for any\nform of access internalism (Bergmann 2006). This dilemmatic argument starts by distinguishing between\nnonconceptual awareness in which no concept is applied and no judgment\nmade; and strong awareness, which is conceptual. Strong awareness\ninvolves a knowing that or justifiably believing that something is the\ncase. We can adapt this distinction to the two cases of access\ninternalism distinguished earlier, namely weak and strong AJI. To do\nthis we presume that the awareness spoken of in weak AJI is weak,\nnon-conceptual awareness, and that the awareness noted in strong AJI\nis strong awareness. Then, the dillema for the access internalist, so\nadapted, is this: If the access internalist requires strong awareness\nas in strong AJI, then her position will lead to an infinite\nregress. If, on the other hand, the access internalist settles for\nnon-conceptual awareness, as in weak AJI, then her position will fall\nprey to the SPO, thus undercutting the best case for access\ninternalism. Thus, access internalism should be rejected. This dilemma argument can be aimed at both actual and potential internalism\nawareness, as well as how those might be aligned with either\npropositional or doxastic justification (Bergmann 2006,\nchap. 1). Here we will cover just potential awareness aligned with\ndoxastic justification; that should be enough to show the strength of\nthe dilemma argument. If the access internalism understands awareness as non-conceptual\nawareness, then being aware of a justifier would be an event in which\nno concept is applied and no belief is acquired or judgment made. In\nthat case, the event of being aware of the justifier would be no\ndifferent from the cognizer's point of view from an event such as\nbelief acquisition by means of a reliable process. Thus, from that\ncognizer's standpoint, her true belief would be no more than a \"stray\nhunch or arbitrary conviction.\" In this way, the SPO would itself\nhave force against access internalism, rather than help to provide\nsupport and motivation for access internalism. Given this result, the access internalist should, and no doubt\nwould, opt for strong awareness, encapsulated here in strong\nAJI. Then, if a cognizer has a justified belief that p, she\nwill be capable of knowing that, and so justifiably believing that\nthere is some item j that is a justifier for her belief\nthat p. In turn, this will require that she be capable of\nknowing that, and thus justifiably believing that there is some\nitem, j1, that is a justifier for her belief\nthat j is a justifier for her belief that p. Then her\nbelief that j1 is this sort of justifier will\nrequire that she be capable of knowing that, and so justifiably\nbelieving that there is an item, j2, that is a\njustifier for her belief that j1 is a justifier for\nher belief that j is a justifier for her belief that p.\nThis will then require that she be capable of knowing that, and so\njustifiably believing that, there is an item, j3,\nand so on to infinity. In order to have a single justified belief, the\ncognizer would have to be capable of having an infinite number of\nfurther beliefs concerning justifiers. (Bergmann 2006; Wedgwood 2002,\n352, gives a similar argument, though aimed at rational belief.) This argument may be taken to show that strong AJI, making use of\nstrong awareness, leads to scepticism. More importantly, the argument\nshows that strong AJI requires that a cognizer with a justified belief\nbe capable of holding justified beliefs of \"ever increasing\ncomplexity\" (Bergmann 2006, p. 16) and this is psychologically\nunrealistic, maybe even psychologically impossible. So, strong AJI\nshould be rejected as untenable. Hence, access internalism is\nimplausible and should be rejected, because neither its weak nor its\nstrong form is acceptable. \nThere is a response to the dilemma argument, one that raises\nadditional interesting issues. We focus first on a case of a basic\nbelief. A person has in her visual field a green triangular shape;\nthis is what she experiences. The green triangular shape is the\nexperiential element, and the awareness this cognizer has of that\nelement is \"non-propositional and non-conceptual\" (BonJour 2006,\n744). It thus involves no belief or judgment, and no issue of\njustification arises for this awareness. In such circumstances, a\ncognizer will often form a belief that there is a green triangular\nshape in her visual field. The idea is that first the cognizer will\nentertain the propositional claim that there is a green triangular\nshape in the visual field, and merely by entertaining this\npropositional claim she does not thereby have a belief. Rather, she\ncomes to have a belief once she accepts the propositional claim. This\npoint concerning the transition from merely entertaining the\npropositional claim to actually believing it, interesting though it\nmay be, is one that will not figure in the argument as given here. \n There is a third element to be considered, namely the\ncognizer's direct awareness of \"fit\" between the experiential element\nand the propositional claim. The point can be put this way:  The general thought is not that the experience of the\nexperiential element by itself justifies the belief in the\npropositional claim. What, though, of a position in which the direct\nawareness of the fit or agreement between the two elements does all of\nthe justificatory work?  On this account, the experience of the\nexperiential element taken together with the belief in the\npropositional claim and the fact that there is the relevant fit\nbetween these two elements – all of these things taken together\nprovide no justification for the belief. It is only when the cognizer\ndirectly recognizes the relevant fit that her belief about the green\ntriangular shape is justified. \nThe problem with this interpretation of the argument in response to\nthe dilemma argument is that it would not count as a version of access\ninternalism. The reason should be clear: on the above described\naccount, the cognizer is not aware of any justifiers. So it seems best\nto understand this line of argument to be saying this: the fact that\nthe cognizer has the relevant experience of the green traingular\nshape, plus the fact the fact that there is a fit or agreement between\nthe experiential element and the propositional claim provides some\njustification for the belief in that proposition; and the direct\nrecognition of fit or agreement between those elements serves to\nenhance that degree of justification. In this way, the cognizer will\naccess some justifiers when she directly recognizes a fit or agreement\nbetween the experiential element and the propositional\nclaim. (Bergmann 2006, 35-36, offers a similar interpretation, though\nhe speaks of contributors to justification rather than\njustifiers.)  Thus the general idea is that this account of the justification of a basic\nbelief avoids the dilemma argument. Part of the\nreason for thinking this is that direct recognition of fit between the\nexperiential element and the propositional claim \"…grows out of\n[my] awareness of the content of the claim and of the corresponding\nexperience. To be sure, I must recognize the fit between the two, but\nthis recognition is not a further, cognitively independent judgment,\nwhich would then require further independent justification, but is\ninstead cognitively guided by and based on those experiences\nthemselves\" (BonJour 2006, 745-46). Another reason the regress is\navoided, according to BonJour, is that the direct recognition of fit\nis not strong awareness, something that is needed to initiate and fuel\nthe regress in the dilemma argument. \nPhilosophers who have discussed basic beliefs have often noted that no\nspecial evidence or reasons are needed beyond the having of the\nrelevant experience in order for the belief to count as justified. In\neffect, the response to the dilemma argument is telling us why this is\nis or may be the case. It is not, on this account, because the\nexperience alone justifies the belief, but rather because the\nexperience and the fact that there is a fit between the experiential\ncontent and the proposition believed enables the cognizer to recognize\nthe fit between those elements. This enabling is likely what is meant\nby saying that the direct recognition of fit \"grows out of\" the\nexperience. In that sense, no additional evidence or reasons are\nneeded to effect the justification, and so the regress does not\nbegin. \nThat leaves the direct recognition of fit. We know the regress will\nthreaten if direct recognition of fit is strong awareness. Weak\nawareness will not help, because that will lead straight back to the\nSPO, and in any case weak awareness is ruled out as not what is needed\n(BonJour 2003, 747).  So, direct recognition of fit must be some form\nof awareness that is, so to speak, intermediate between weak and\nstrong awareness. It is something with some conceptual content, but\ndoes not collapse into strong awareness as one might be inclined to\nthink (Bergmann 2006, 35-38). Perhaps the best conclusion to draw at\nthis point is that this intriguing idea of a direct recognition of\nfit, if further developed and clarified, together with the point about\nenabling made above, will suffice to block the regress in the dilemma\nargument. Without that further clarification and development which\nwould differentiate recognition of fit from strong awareness, however,\nthe dilemma argument would seem to have full force against access\ninternalism. \n\nA very strong argument for mentalism has been proposed (Conee and\nFeldman 2001). The argument has two prongs: first, we are given a\nnumber of cases in which the best explanation for why one person has a\nhigher degree of justification than another is that the first person\nhas some specific mental state; and then second, it is argued that the\nmentalist theory can satisfactorily deal with problem cases and\ncriticisms. One of the examples used in the first prong of the\nargument is this: \n\nComment: Bob's justification for the belief was enhanced by his\nexperience of feeling the heat, and thus undergoing a mental change\nwhich so to speak “internalized” the actual\ntemperature. Ray had just the forecast to rely on. (Conee and\nFeldman 2001, p. 236) \n\nThe strength of this argument is that it makes use of something\nindisputable, viz., that Bob's justification is stronger than Ray's;\nand it is hard to think of any other difference between them except\nthat Bob has felt the heat and Ray has not. On the basis of this case\nand a number of similar ones, we can generalize to the\nconclusion that “…every variety of change that brings\nabout or enhances justification either internalizes an external fact or\nmakes a purely internal difference” (ibid., 238). \n\nIt is clear that this argument is not decisive, though neither is it\nclaimed to be. The number of cases it examines is very small, of\ncourse, but that is not the principal limitation. The important point\nis that enhancing one's justification, as in Bob's situation, is\ncompatible with the initial justifiers prior to enhancement being\nelements other than the mental states of the individuals involved. The\nexample of Ray and Bob, and the other examples Conee and Feldman give\nin which justification is enhanced, all assume that some degree of\njustification is already on hand before the enhancement event. Nothing\nin their examples gives us reason to suppose that initial justification\nis supplied by mental states. So, while it may be granted that their\nargument provides some good evidence for mentalism, it does not go far\nenough by itself. \n\nThe second prong of the overall argument for menralism, however, may\nwell make up the difference. In this part of the case for mentalism, a\nnumber of important objections that have been lodged against\ninternalism are addressed, either of the accessibility or the\nmentalist variety, and it is argued that the mentalist position can\naccommodate the points made in the objections. The natural idea is\nthat meeting outstanding objections strengthens the overall argument\nfor mentalism. \n\nOne of these objections and the reply to it brings up what may be\nthe deepest and most fundamental issue dividing mentalist internalists and\nexternalists. First, the objection: \n\nThe problem, in short, is that justifiers other than or in addition\nto mental states are needed if we are to explicate the justification of\nmany beliefs, and that even defenders of mentalism will have to\nrecognize this point. Not all justifiers, therefore, are mental states,\nand so mentalism would have to be either abandoned or modified. \n\nThe important question being raised by this objection is whether the\nlogical or probabilistic support relations are themselves justifiers;\nor are the justifiers confined to the entities over which the support\nrelations are to hold? If we think that these support relations\nholding between one's evidence and the beliefs are themselves\njustifiers, then mentalism is compromised (though the mixed mentalist\ntheory cited earlier as a possibility is not thereby affected). A way\nout of the difficulty would be to impose a “higher order\nrequirement” according to which one need be aware of these\nsupport relations. Then, one could say that being aware of these\nrelations is a justifier, as are the mental states making up one's\nevidence; and, of course, awareness is a mental state. Taking this\noption, however, leads to worries about whether all cognizers will be\nin a position to meet the high-order requirement. Recognition of\nlogical and probabilistic support relations, after all, is a fairly\nsophisticated act. \nA reply to this argument defends the higher-order requirement. This\nhigher order requirement,\n \n\nMany will think, however, that even this awareness of some support\nrelation vaguely characterized is beyond the grasp of some cognizers,\nsuch as young children, who nonetheless have perfectly justified\nbeliefs.  The other alternative would be to deny that the logical and\nprobabilistic support relations are themselves justifiers. This would\nprotect mentalism from criticism concerning logical and probabilistic\nrelations; the only justifiers would be the mental states\nthemselves. Justification for a belief supported by evidence would\n“grow out of” that evidence with no need for awareness of\nthe support connections.Here is a suggestion for how this might work\nfor very simple cases. \n\nThe key idea here is what it is to understand a proposition\np. The suggestion is that in very simple cases, where the\nlogical connection between p and q is immediate,\npart of one's understanding of p is to also believe\nq. \n\nThis line of argument depends squarely on a concept of understanding a\nproposition, and its prospect for success awaits development of a\ntheory of understanding. Even if this can be developed in a promising\nway, however, it will work only for very simple logical connections.\nFor more complex logical relations and probabilistic ones holding\nbetween one's evidence and one's belief, the only available mentalist\nalternative would be to embrace the idea of awareness of the support\nrelations. This higher order requirement does not seem to be satisfied\nin all the remaining cases where the support relations have any degree\nof complexity. \n\nThe deontological concept of justification has not been supported by\nextensive argumentation, unlike the other internalist positions. But\nsome support for this concept can be provided, particularly from a\nclose examination of cases in which a person does not live up to\nsomething we regard as a norm, and with the result that justification\nis lacking. A striking example of just this sort concerns a\nclairvoyant named Maud. \n\nThe original aim in presenting this case, and other similar ones, is to\ncriticize a reliabilist account of justification and knowledge. For\npresent purposes, interest in this example centers on a\ndiagnosis of what has gone wrong with Maud's belief. The example indicates \nthat Maud is being both irrational and irresponsible in maintaining\nbelief in her clairvoyance when she has such powerful evidence to the\ncontrary. What Maud has done is to disregard evidence that she has on\nhand and that she either is or can easily be aware of, and it is this\nfact that leads us to the intuitively supported conviction that Maud's\nbelief about the President's whereabouts is not justified. It fails to\nbe justified precisely because Maud has been intellectually\nirresponsible in her belief formation. \n\nThis important example, and another concerning an individual,\nSamantha, who is also clairvoyant but who disregards a lot of evidence\nthat she has on hand to the effect that the President is not in New\nYork City (BonJour 1980), makes a strong case for the idea that there\nis some deontological component to the concept of epistemic\njustification. This deontological component may not be all there is to\nthe concept of justification, as defenders of the deontological\nconcept sometimes allege; but, these and related examples do strongly\nsupport the view that there is some deontological ingredient\nin our concept of justification. \n\nWe have seen that externalism is generally the denial of some\ninternalist position, typically regarding accessibility or mentalism\nas accounts of justifiers. It is not surprising, then, that major\narguments for externalism are, first, the failure or weakness in\narguments for either accessibility internalism or for mentalism.\nExternalism fares best on this count in regard to accessibility\ninternalism, since the arguments for that doctrine that we have\nconsidered are hardly compelling. Arguments for mentalism are in\nsomewhat better shape, for in many contexts it does appear that a\ndifference in mental states best explains a difference in the degree\nof justification for a belief. The support provided to mentalism by\nthis explanatory argument is limited, mainly because explaining a\ndifference in degree of justification falls short of\nestablishing that it is plausible to hold that all justifiers are\nmental items. But it cannot be denied that the explanatory argument\nconsidered earlier goes some way in this direction. \n\nExternalism is also supported to varying degrees by any cogent\ncriticisms that have been devised against internalism. On this score,\ntoo, it is accessibility internalism that is especially vulnerable,\nparticularly in the face of the perceptual examples already considered\nin which many justified beliefs are received either simultaneously or\nin rapid order.Further, there is the dilemma argument which poses a\nparticularly forceful challenge to access internalism. Mentalism is\nonly marginally better off in this regard, because as we noted\nearlier, the evidential support relations that obtain between\njustifiers and resulting beliefs seem themselves to be justifiers\nthough they are not mental states. Even if we allow that in simple\ncases one's justification for a belief that follows immediately from\none's understanding of simple premises from which the believed\nproposition follows, this sort of strategy will only work in a small\nclass of cases. Wherever the evidential support relations are more\ncomplex, mere understanding of the propositional content of the\njustifiers will not suffice to issue in justification for a resulting\nbelief. In other words, the above-discussed criticism of the mentalist\nposition concerning probabilistic relations, while perhaps not wholly\neffective, nonetheless has force against all but the simplest of\ncases, and to that extent the case for externalism is strengthened by\nthe weakening of the support for mentalism. \n\nExternalism is also supported by any general defense of theories\nwhich incorporate or imply it, such as the reliable process theory.\nThis sort of defense of externalism, of course, is quite independent of\ncriticisms of accessibility internalism and of mentalism, and also\nindependent of critical attacks on arguments that support those\ninternalist positions. There is, further, an important general argument for\nexternalism (Goldman 2009).  There is general agreement that certain\nepistemic principles concerning perception are correct. One such\nprinciple might be, We then ask: Why do so many examples of noninferential J-principles\n(justification principles) center on perceptual experience...?\nBecause these are cases in which beliefs formed in accordance with\nthese experiences are usually true (Goldman 2009, 335). This\nperception-based principle is just one among many, such as those we\nmight adduce concerning memory, for example. In all of these cases,\nGoldman says, “I claim that the underlying appeal of these\nJ-principles is a tacit recognition that they are truth conducive\n…” (ibid.).  If this is correct, we are tacitly\nrecognizing a close connection between justification and truth\nconduciveness, which is a central tenet of the reliable process theory\nof justified belief. That theory thus provides a good explanation of\nwhy we regard such J-principles as correct, and this fact amounts to a\npositive argument in favor of the reliable process theory. That, in\nturn, is a positive argument in favor of externalism regarding\njustification.  This line of argument, especially when extended to\ncases of inferentially justified beliefs, is of special significance,\nthen, because it is independent of arguments that criticize either\naccess internalism or mentalism. Externalism regarding justification,\nthus, need not be thought of as a perspective one “backs\ninto” once one recognizes the shortcomings of internalist\npositions, but can be seen to stand on its own.","contact.mail":"pappas.1@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
