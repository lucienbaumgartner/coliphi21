His life-long effort was to\nreform and unite the universal and Roman Church, whether as canon law\nexpert at the Council of Basel and after, as legate to Constantinople\nand later to German dioceses and houses of religion, as bishop in his\nown diocese of Brixen, and as advisor in the papal curia. His active\nlife as a Church administrator and bishop found written expression in\nseveral hundred Latin sermons and more theoretical background in his\nwritings on ecclesiology, ecumenism, mathematics, philosophy and\ntheology. Cusanus had an open and curious mind. He was learned and\nsteeped in the Neoplatonic tradition, well aware of both humanist and\nscholastic learning, yet mostly self-taught in philosophy and\ntheology. Nicholas anticipated many later ideas in mathematics,\ncosmology, astronomy and experimental science while constructing his\nown original version of systematic Neoplatonism. A whole range of\nearlier medieval writers, such as Thierry of Chartre, Ramon Llull and\nAlbert the Great, influenced Nicholas, but his important intellectual\nroots are in Proclus and Dionysius the Areopagite. In spite of his\nsignificance few later thinkers, apart from Giordano Bruno, understood\nor were influenced by him until the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n\nNicholas of Cusa (Nikolaus Cryfftz or Krebs in German, then Nicolaus\nCusanus in Latin) was born in 1401 in Kues (now Bernkastel-Kues) on the\nMoselle River between Koblenz and Trier. He was one of four\nchildren in a bourgeois family. His father, Johan Cryfftz, was a\nprosperous merchant who became one of the landed gentry in Trier. The\nfirst record we have of Nicholas’ early education comes from his\nstudy of the liberal arts at University of Heidelburg in 1416–17.\nHe then moved to the University of Padua where he studied canon law,\nreceiving his Doctor of Canon Law in 1423. In Padua he met the\nphysician and mathematician Paolo Toscanelli, the canonist Giuliano\nCaesarini, and the humanists Guarino da Verona and Vittorino da\nFeltre. \n\nIn 1425 he entered the service of the archbishop of Trier and, as his\nsecretary, received income from several benefices. By 1426 he was\nin Cologne where he may have lectured on canon law, studied philosophy\nand theology, and began researches into original source material and\ninto the annals of German law. There he was able to prove that\nthe Donation of Constantine was an eighth-century forgery, and he found\nmanuscripts of Pliny’s Natural History and of\nPlautus’ comedies. In Cologne he met Heimerich of Campo,\nwho introduced him to the writings of Ramon Llull, Albert the Great and\nhis commentary on Dionysius, and Proclus’ commentary on\nPlato’s Parmenides. In 1428 and 1435 Nicholas was\noffered positions teaching canon law at the University of Louvain, but\nhe turned them down to remain in church administration. \n\nOrdained a priest sometime during the 1430s, Nicholas first gained\nwider notice for his work as a conciliarist at the Council of\nBasel. There he wrote De concordantia catholica (1433),\narguing for the authority of the council over that of the pope and\nstressing the notions of consent and representation. After the turmoil\nat Basel split the council, Nicholas ultimately sided with the papal\nparty and left the conciliarists. In 1437 he was part of an embassy\nsent to Constantinople to seek reconciliation of the Greek Church with\nRome. He reported that, during the voyage home, the insights of De\ndocta ignorantia (1440) came to him as a kind of divine\nrevelation. He continued as a papal legate to Germany from\n1438–48. Named cardinal in 1446 by Eugenius IV, Cusanus was\nelevated to that position in 1448 by Nicholas V and was sent to\nGermany in 1451 as papal legate to reform the church. \n\nNicholas’ most important philosophical works were written in the\ntwenty-four years between the appearance of De docta\nignorantia and his death. De coniecturis\n(1442–43), De dato patris luminum (1445), Apologia doctae\nignorantiae (1449), Idiota de sapientia, Idiota de mente,\nIdiota de staticis experimentis (all 1450) were among important\nworks of the decade from 1440–1450, as were many sermons and works on\nmathematics. The final fourteen years of his life saw the\nappearance of De visione Dei (1453), De beryllo\n(1458), De possest (1460), De li non aliud (1461),\nDe ludo globi (1462–63), De venatione sapientiae\n(1462), Compendium (1464) and De apice theoriae\n(1464), more works on mathematics and many more sermons. Of particular\nnote are two works he wrote during these years that reached out to\nother religions, especially Islam, De Pace Fidei (1453) and\nCribatio Alchorani (1461). \n\nIn 1450 he was named bishop of Brixen in the Tirol. In 1452 he\nbegan active administration in Brixen, but his attempts at reform led\nto threats and clashes with Sigismund, the count of Tirol. Many\nof his over two hundred sermons date from this time in Brixen, though\nhis reform efforts there and earlier in Germany mostly\nfailed. Nicholas finally retreated from the conflict in\nBrixen to Rome, where he remained in the papal curia advising Pius\nII. He died in 1464 in Todi on his way from Rome to Ancona.\nHis remains were buried in his titular Church, St Peter in Chains, at\nRome; his heart was sent to Kues and buried in the chapel of the\nhospice for elderly men there that he endowed in his will. The\nhospice survives and his remarkable library is housed there today. \n\nNicholas of Cusa may arguably be best understood as employing a\nChristian Neoplatonic framework to construct his own synthesis of\ninherited ideas. His thought witnesses to his own reading in a\nvariety of predecessors, while side-stepping the methods of the\nmedieval scholastic summae and their typical controversies and\narguments. Trained as a canon lawyer, Nicholas is mostly\nself-taught in theology and philosophy; both his ideas and his language\nmay present some difficulties to contemporary readers. His\nthought has to be viewed as a whole, for it works more by\ncorrespondences and parallels between the domains he is interested in\nexpounding than in a linear fashion or by direct argument. What\nis noteworthy are the flexible metaphors he uses as he moves across\nwhat we designate today as ontology, philosophy of mind and\nepistemology, and philosophical theology. His metaphors provide\nsome methodological clue to understanding how Nicholas proposes that we\nshould think God and creatures together. It is not just that God\nexceeds our conceptual reach and grasp as well as our literal\nlanguage. The asymmetry between God and creatures also provides a\nmeasure or norm for the appropriateness of any metaphor exploring or\nattempting to explain their relationship. \n\nNicholas of Cusa’s most complete set of proposals about what is\nreal occurs in his best-known work of 1440, De docta\nignorantia: On Learned Ignorance. Here Cusanus\naddresses the four categorical realities traditionally found in\nChristian thought: God, the natural universe, Christ and human\nbeings. On Learned Ignorance devotes its first book to\nGod, the second to the universe and a third to the God-man, Jesus\nChrist. While its order mirrors the outflow from God and return\nto him, this book does not distinguish philosophy and theology as\ncontemporary thinkers might, but unites them in a single overview of\nNeoplatonic Christian reality. \n\nNicholas begins with a single trope or symbol to lay out the parallels\nbetween his teachings in the three books, that of the\n“maximum.” God is the absolute Maximum; the universe is a\ncreated image of God, the “contracted” or restricted\nmaximum. Christ unites the first two as the Maximum at once\nabsolute-and-contracted. “Contraction” is a metaphor for the finite\nstatus of creatures, all of whom are limited images of God.\n“Absolute” is used in its etymological sense of “free from”\n(ab-solutus) to characterize God’s infinity. As absolute\nmaximum God is both unlimited and transcendent, unreachable by human\nconceptions that measure the limited or contracted realm of more and\nless. Once Cusanus conceptualizes human knowing as measuring, he\nproposes that our knowledge also cannot measure exactly the essence of\nany limited thing. A fortiori, when it comes to the unlimited God,\nNicholas asserts that “there is no proportion between finite and\ninfinite.” The infinite God remains beyond our ken. Human\nefforts to understand the depth and implications of this assertion are\nwhat will render our ignorance “learn-ed.” \n\nAs so often in Christian thinking, this sort of apophatic preamble does\nnot prevent Cusanus from spending a whole book proposing how we might\ncomprehend the incomprehensible God\n“incomprehensibly.” His first proposal is that God is\nthe “coincidence of opposites.” This turns out to be\na way both of recalling the negative theology to be found in Dionysius\nthe Areopagite and his other predecessors and at the same time of going\nbeyond it. Put in the language of the “maximum,” in\nGod both maximum and minimum coincide in the divine infinite Oneness,\nfor both take the mind beyond the measurable created domain of more and\nless and end up meaning just the “superlative” or\ntranscendent. The implication, in other words, is that\nGod’s reality lies beyond any familiar domain where the principle\nof contradiction holds sway. \n\nAt the same time this “coincidence” underlines the divine\nOneness that comprehends all else in undifferentiated and unlimited\nunity. It is not that creatures coincide with God or God with\ncreatures, but that in God all else coincides as nothing else than\nGod. As so often in negative and apophatic\n“theology,” we are not only told what God is not but led to\nreflect explicitly on what God must be, even if we have no conceptual\nclarity about what we assert. The result is a kind of\nsecond-order language about the ways in which we are forced to think\nand talk about divinity. \n\nNicholas then proposes some geometrical “exercises” to\nprovide his readers some object lessons designed to teach how we might\nreach for the unlimited even while we are aware that we cannot grasp\nwhat the infinite God may be. For instance, we are to imagine a\ncircle and a straight line or tangent that meets the circle. From\na certain perspective, as the diameter or circumference of the circle\nincreases, its circumference approaches the straight line and appears\nless and less curved. If we then imagine and extrapolate\nthe circumference to the infinite, we can almost\n“see” that both straight tangent and curved\ncircumference should coincide—a kind of “coincidence of\nopposites” that is a figure of how we may think beyond limited\nthings toward the transcendent One. All this is mathematically\nimpossible, of course, but it demonstrates some metaphorical steps for\nmoving beyond the finite toward the infinite that might be transferred\nfrom geometrical figures to created beings and their\nCreator. \n\nIn Book II of On Learned Ignorance Cusanus deals with the\ncreated universe. The natural universe counts as the limited or\ncontracted maximum that is the image of the absolute Maximum.  Here\nNicholas introduces another central metaphor to capture the\nrelationship between God and creatures, the metaphor of enfolding and\nunfolding (complicatio/explicatio). He expands the “folding”\nmetaphor he inherited from the twelfth-century school of Chartres.\nWhile all beings are “enfolded” in the undifferentiated\noneness of their Divine Source, they are at the same time an\n“unfolding” of God in time and space. “Insofar as He\nis the unfolding,” Nicholas writes, “in all things He is\nthat which they are, just as in an image the reality itself\n[veritas] is present” (II.3, Hopkins translation). In\nNeoplatonic terms, one must think the unfolded universe we experience\nand all that is real in it as at once enfolded in the Creator on whom\nit depends.  God encompasses every thing created in a dialectical\noutflow and return to God without any creatures ever being identified\nwith the God on whom they depend, that One who remains both present to\nthem yet ever absent and beyond. What the\n“unfolding/enfolding” couple captures is the dynamic\nrelationship between divine Original and created image. \n\nThe natural universe, then, is the whole or contracted maximum\ncollectively constituted by the many beings in space and\ntime. Nicholas proposes the quasi-Anaxagorean slogan that\n“each thing is in each thing: quodlibet in\nquolibet” to emphasize that the individual beings or parts\nare no less “contracted” images of the whole created\nuniverse. Just as God is present to each creature that stands as\na contracted image of the divine, so the universe as a macrocosm is\npresent to each creature or constitutive part as microcosm. In that\nway, each natural thing is an image of the collective whole. But\nsince this collectivity is made up of interrelated parts, each thing is\nalso the totality of its connections with everything else.\n“Each thing is in each thing” because each is an image\nreflecting the oneness of the whole and thus of all other individuals\nthat are the interrelated parts of that whole. \n\nNicholas also recognizes in Book Two that the natural universe is\ncharacterized by change or motion; it is not static in time and\nspace. But finite change and motion, ontologically speaking, are also\nmatters of more and less and have no fixed maximum or minimum. This\n“ontological relativity” leads Cusanus to some remarkable\nconclusions about the earth and the physical universe, based not on\nempirical observation but on metaphysical grounds. The earth is not\nfixed in place at some given point because nothing is utterly at rest;\nnor can it be the exact physical center of the natural universe, even\nif it seems nearer the center than “the fixed stars.”\nBecause the universe is in motion without fixed center or boundaries,\nnone of the spheres of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic world picture\nare exactly spherical. None of them has an exact center, and the\n“outermost sphere” is not a boundary. The universe is\ntherefore “infinite,” in the sense of physically unbounded. Cusanus\nthus shifts the typical medieval picture of the created universe\ntoward later views, but on ontological grounds. \n\nFor Nicholas, the exact center and circumference of the created\nuniverse are to be found only in God. What we take to be\ncenter and outer limits depends on our viewpoint. If we change\nperspectives, say to that from another planet (which might indeed be\ninhabited) and take it to be center, then earth might be zenith. In\nthis way we come to realize that what is taken as fixed or central can\nbe altered to be moving and at the zenith, depending on the location of\nthe standpoint we pick in the unbounded universe. The reason, Cusanus\nwrites, is that there is no exactness outside of God, and only\n“God, who is everywhere and nowhere, is its [the\nuniverse’s] circumference and center”\n(II.12, Hopkins translation). \n\nIn this way learned ignorance recognizes that the natural universe\nitself, as a contracted image of God, has a physical center that can be\nanywhere and a circumference that is nowhere. That is why\nNicholas characterized the natural universe as a contracted maximum or\n“privative” infinite while God remains the\n“negative” infinite or absolute maximum. This means\nthat the universe merely lacks set physical bounds or limits, while God\nhas no ontological limits in being all that can possibly be. This\nenables the “infinite” universe, as the whole constituted by all creatures, to be\nan image of the divine oneness, but only in a contracted or attenuated\nfashion. \n\nNowhere is the Christian bearing of On Learned Ignorance more\nobvious than in Book III, where Nicholas treats of the God-man, Jesus\nChrist, as a third “maximum,” the Maximum at once\nabsolute-and-contracted. Once again, however, Cusanus uses the\northodox teaching of early Christian councils such as Chalcedon more as\na background guide than as providing a straightforward Christology or\ntext for exposition. He returns to the contrast between absolute\nGod and contracted creatures that he used throughout Books I and II to\ninterpret and contrast the relation between infinite God and finite\ncreatures, even though there is no real proportion between\nthem. \n\nGod was construed as the absolute maximum and divine infinite Oneness,\nwhile Nicholas viewed the natural universe as a contracted maximum\nwhose unity-in-multiplicity and lack of physical limits\n“reflected” God’s positively unlimited oneness.\nNicholas now entertains a third possibility, an anomalous joining of\nabsolute and contracted in the God-man. He reviews, borrowing\nfrom Aristotle, the ordered universe of things belonging to natural\ntypes (genera and species), then modifies it by extending to\nindividuals his idea of contraction or limitation. Individual\nspecimens are all that exist, but not only are they contracted images\nof God’s oneness, but also contracted images of their types\ninsofar as each more or less fulfills the possibilities of its\nnature. \n\nCusanus thereupon asks a hypothetical question. What would happen\nwere a perfect specimen, an individual fulfillment of its type, to\nactually exist? In his language of maximality, it would be\nanother maximum contracted to a unique individual of a given\nkind. But what would make such a maximum individual possible in a\nuniverse of more or less? Only its unique union with God, the\nabsolute divine Maximum that is the source of every contracted reality,\na union signaled in the traditional “hypostatic\nunion.” The whole of this maximal yet finite human nature\nis created and united with the absolute God so that God remains\ntranscendent, yet inseparable from this one human creature. In\nterms of enfolding and unfolding, this unique unfolding in a human\nbeing is at the same time to reveal the God enfolding Jesus\nChrist. Jesus is an image of God so utterly transparent as\nto remain opaque except to the eyes of faith. \n\nCusanus relies on the traditional microcosm/macrocosm trope to explain\nwhy human nature would be the contracted nature best suited for union\nwith the divine Absolute. Human nature is the created nature\n“more common to the totality of beings” (III.3, Hopkins\ntranslation) because the intermediate status of human beings between\nangels and all other bodily creatures provides common ties to the\nwhole range of created things. These ties are based on its capacities\nas “what is highest of the lower and what is lowest of the\nhigher” natures (ibid.), so that it stands as\nrepresentative microcosm of the created macrocosm. The upshot is that\nthe historical Jesus Christ is human in such a way as to be\ndivine and divine in such a way as to be human, the Maximum\nat once contracted and absolute, the human image who is\nsimultaneously the divine Original. Because the divine Word is one\nwith Jesus’ human nature, that nature is perfect of its kind, at the\nsame time contracted and maximal. Learned ignorance may thus press the\nCusan metaphors and ideas to the limit in dealing with Jesus Christ,\nbecause the hypostatic oneness of the incarnate God will always elude\nfull human understanding. \n\nThis third book realigns the order of Christian metaphysics so that the\nGod-man stands between God and the rest of creation, for it is through\nthe mediation of the Incarnate Word that creatures are made and\ncreatures return to their source. In Book I, Nicholas proposed\nthat there is no proportion or measure between the infinite and the\nfinite that will enable us to grasp the Infinite God or even\nGod’s contracted image in the natural universe. This is\nwhat learned ignorance establishes for and contributes to human\nwisdom. Yet the historic reality of Jesus Christ has a\ntheoretical role to play in interpreting Nicholas’ metaphysical\nvision. The Cusan Christ stands as a more adequate norm and\nmeasure for theory and practice. Jesus Christ is the historical human image of the\nAbsolute One beyond our ken and thus the paradigm that reveals our\ncreaturely connection with the infinite God. Christ is the disclosure in time of\nwhat God is. In this way learned ignorance points to Jesus Christ\nas the medium, the measure and mediator between finite and\ninfinite, and, as well, the concrete norm for what human beings may\nbecome. \n\nThe three books of On Learned Ignorance thus represent a\nseries of powerful proposals for reinterpreting Christian\nreality. Throughout Nicholas uses metaphors such as the\ncoincidence of opposites, absolute/contracted and enfolding/unfolding\nto relate God and creation. His proposals are established by\nseeking out parallels between the infinite divine Original and limited\ncreated images and by drawing out the implications of these\nparallels. This book is neither medieval Aristotelian scholastic\ndisputation nor later Cartesian rationalism, but its own kind of\nChristian Neoplatonic speculation that teases the philosophical\nimagination as much as it may frustrate any contemporary philosophical\nsearch for arguments or proofs. It is the coherence of the\nparallels or correspondences within the overall view of reality that\ngives Cusan metaphysics and Cusan metaphors their persuasive power. \n\nNicholas of Cusa does not neatly divide ontology from epistemology any\nmore than he separates faith and reason, so it seems fitting that his\nideas on human knowing emphasize the metaphor of mind as measure\n(mens/mensura) already mentioned in On Learned\nIgnorance. This becomes the significant way that human\nminds are images of the divine mind. In his 1450 dialogue,\nIdiota de mente: The Layman: About Mind, the first\n“definition” proposed for mind may fit the divine mind\nbetter than the human: “Mind is the limit and measure of all\nthings” (c.1). Cusanus proceeds to employ the quasi-technical\nmetaphor from On Learned Ignorance,\n“enfolding/unfolding—complicatio/explicatio,”\nto spell out just how our minds are images of God’s mind. These moves\nalready separate his ideas about human knowing from those of both his\nscholastic predecessors and his post-Renaissance successors. He\nwrites: \n\nThis extension of the metaphor used in metaphysics to capture how\nthings simultaneously proceed from and return to God spells out where\nhuman knowledge stands. God’s utterly simple divine mind enfolds the\ntrue natures of all the actual things “unfolded” from it\nin the created universe. The human mind is a parallel though limited\noneness that can enfold or encompass the concepts of all it knows\nwhile unfolding them in a conceptual universe. While divine knowing\namounts to the creating of beings, human knowing amounts to the\ncreating of concepts that are “the assimilation of\nbeings.” The idiota/layman continues: \n\nTwo points here are essential. First, the conceptual content of\nour knowledge is tied to the things God created as to their epistemic\nlikenesses. Nicholas thus stands in the tradition of Christian\nrealism. Second, the correspondences between divine mind and\nhuman mind are severely modified by the fact that God’s purported\n“concepts,” the “exemplars” of things, are\nreally nothing else in God but God’s undifferentiated\noneness. Oneness is primary in God’s knowledge,\n“manyness” and “otherness” characterize our\nconceptual domain. At best we humans are unitary sources of\nour own knowledge and can give our ideas an overall oneness as a more\nor less organized whole—a quite imperfect and faint mirroring of\nGod’s mind. \n\nNicholas’ second major treatise (1442–43) that again explains his\nvision of all there is in Neoplatonic Christian terms is entitled\nDe coniecturis: On Conjectures. Here he employs the\ncontrasting terms of unitas/alteritas: oneness/otherness, as\nwell as enfolding/unfolding to propose how we might understand from a\nsomewhat different viewpoint God, the universe and human beings.\nOneness is characteristic of God, while otherness stands for the\ncontingent plurality and variety of limited created things. In\nthis work Nicholas also introduces an explicit contrast between the\nhuman capacities of ratio and intellectus.\nRatio or discursive reason is our capacity for thinking, using\nconcepts and judgments. Intellectus, by contrast, is a\ndirect intellectual vision. Nicholas parallels the way our plural\ncapacities for reason, imagination and sensation are founded in\n“intellectus” as their single source to the simultaneous\noutflow and return of the plurality of creatures to their single divine\nSource. (Ratio and intellectus may recall in some\nways dianoia and noesis in Plato’s famous image\nof the divided line.) \n\nThe title, On Conjectures, is also intriguing because here\nCusanus makes explicit the limits of human knowing only hinted at in\nOn Learned Ignorance and in his later The Layman: On\nMind. As his Prologue puts it, “You have seen that the\nexactness of truth cannot be attained. The consequence is that every\npositive human assertion of the truth is a conjecture….  And\nso the unattainable Oneness of truth is known in conjectural otherness\nand the conjecture of otherness is itself known in the most simple\nOneness of truth.” Here the Neoplatonic dialectical principle\nthat insists we never think anything apart from the First is applied\neven to human knowing. And such knowing is conjecturing. \n\nCusan “conjecture” is not to be taken as what we normally\nmean by the word in contemporary English where it covers the range from a\nguess or hunch to a typical surmise to a provisional proposal to be\ninvestigated or checked against usually empirical evidence.\nNicholas only considers “true” conjectures and believes\nthat our conceptual and judgmental knowledge is conjectural or\nprovisional because human reason never grasps the essence of anything\nprecisely as it is. This does not mean we cannot improve our\nunderstanding or that we are simply making things up; rather, it\nfollows from the fact that our knowledge is a likeness of actual things and\nreal characteristics whose complete and “true” natures are only\nknown to their Creator. To quote the Prologue again, “while\nour actual knowledge is incommensurable with the greatest knowledge,\nsomething humanly unattainable, the unsure falling away of our weak\napprehension from the purity of truth makes our assertions of what is\ntrue conjecture.” \n\nNicholas composed On Conjectures as a letter treatise\naddressed to Cardinal Cesarini. In chapter 11 of Book One he\nproposes a scenario where the cardinal views the pope. This scenario leads\ninto his sole explicit description of coniectura. This\nexample of visual perception lets us recognize that we readily make\nperceptual assertions about what we see or hear. And when we\nreflect on these perceptual judgments we realize that we go beyond what\nsensation alone delivers, for we use reason to interpret and make sense\nof what we see. Reason and sense operate inseparably in our\nperceptual experience. Reason discriminates, recognizes and may\nexplicitly formulate in language or thought what the experience comes\nto, for instance, “There’s the pope.” \n\nFurther reflection enables us to realize that what visual perception\ndelivers is limited, that is, partial and perspectival, because our\nperceptual judgments reflect at least the constraints of the\nperceiver’s bodiliness. These constraints include what\nphysical eyes can see, as well as one’s physical location and\nviewpoint. Nicholas terms this a twofold “otherness”\nthat conditions and limits all sensory perception, limitations that we\nare implicitly aware of in making perceptual judgments. So\nNicholas’ description of coniectura reflects the\n“otherness” of our finite human estate. As he writes,\n“A conjecture, then, is a positive assertion that participates in\ntruth as it is, but in otherness.” (Bk. I, c. 11) “Truth as\nit is” refers, of course, to what is enfolded in the divine\nMind. What is unfolded in our concepts and assertions shares that\ntruth but only approximately, “in otherness.” \n\nTwo other sources of “otherness” besides bodiliness\nunderlie the limitations on perceptual knowledge. One is the fact\nthat the objects of perception are themselves limited. The\ncardinal’s sight of the pope has to be conjectural because\nanything extended can show, as it were, but one side of itself to\nanother embodied viewer. A second “otherness” in perception\nis due to the “otherness” of the mental and linguistic signs,\nimages, and symbols we use to think and talk about what we\nperceive. These differ from both our mental capacities and what\nwe are looking at or listening to. This means the terms in which\nperceptual judgments are expressed reflect the broader historical\nbackground and interests of the perceiver as well as his or her\nlinguistic community. \n\nGiven all these constraints we may wonder why Nicholas believes that\nconjectural knowledge “participates in the truth as it\nis.” Fundamentally, he is convinced that our status as\nimages of God’s mind and its oneness secures the cognitive\nvalidity of what we know. Our knowledge is\n“conjectural” in contrast to God’s knowledge, for\ndivine knowledge is complete and exact, both aperspectival and\nomniperspectival, where knower and known coincide in infinite\nOneness. Our recognition of the limits in our own knowing and its\ncontents can keep us in touch, at least implicitly, with what is beyond\nour ken in that ideal oneness of knower and known. The separation\nof the human mind from the universe of knowable things is at the same\ntime a connection that results in conjectural knowledge. Just so,\nconjectural knowledge is also an outcome of the separation and\nconnection of the human mind and the divine Mind, of image and\nOriginal. \n\nRecall once more the Cusan “definition” of mind already\nalluded to in The Layman: About Mind: Mind is “that from\nwhich comes the limit and measure of all things.” (c.1) If we set\nthis beside the comment quoted above that “conception in the\nhuman mind is the assimilation of beings,” it is clear that\n“assimilating” and “measuring” are the dominant\nmetaphors Nicholas uses to understand what we do as knowers. As\nknowers we measure the things we know and we also are\nassimilated or likened in some way to the objects of\nknowledge. Along with the “horizontal” notion of our\nconcepts being images of things as well as of the mind’s own\noneness, assimilatio also has a “vertical”\ndimension because in knowing we liken ourselves to our divine\nOriginal. \n\nWhat is at issue is the connection and tension between the two\nmetaphors. Supposedly complementary, assimilatio and\nmensura give no obvious answer to what provides the measure\nfor the content and validity of our knowledge—is it the things\nknown or our knowing minds? Nicholas never questioned that the\nvaried things we discover in the natural universe and fashion ourselves\nin the social and cultural milieu exist independently of our minds (if\nnot of God’s). But the question here is whether our\nknowledge is derived from what is independent of mind or is in whole or\npart the result of the linguistic and conceptual measures we learn,\nconstruct and employ in dealing with reality. If knowing is\ncreative or productive, solely a matter of our “measuring,”\nit is easy to see how it is an image of God’s creating, but not\nhow it is a likening to extra-mental things. If things outside\nmeasure and cause what we know, we can see why human knowledge is a\nlikening to things, but not how it is an image of God’s creative\nmind. The two metaphors may well run counter to each other. \n\nBecause Nicholas himself does not frame the question in this way, he\nprovides ample evidence for both answers. Some interpreters, such\nas J. Hopkins (1996), see his use of medieval scholastic language for\nthe powers and activities of the mind as placing him mainly in the\nmedieval Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of critical realism, while\nemphasizing anew the active character of knowing at all levels and thus\nstressing that the mind is an active power. Those interpreters\nwhose proclivities are more Kantian, for instance, K. Flasch (1998) and\nK. Kremer (1978, 2000), find in his texts gestures towards what would\nin Kant become “the transcendental unity of apperception”\nand “a priori” concepts of the understanding, not to\nmention the stress on active judgment. The view of the present\nauthor is that both of these interpretations may miss the Neoplatonic\ncontext in which Nicholas discusses human knowledge and may\nunderestimate how important philosophical theology is to the Cusan\nexposition of knowing. \n\nWhat are the clues we need to connect the metaphors of likening and\nmeasuring in a complementary way? We must return to\nNicholas’ underlying conviction that our minds are images of\nGod’s mind and that this connection between them is constant and\nthoroughgoing and thus should never be overlooked. Then we may\nbegin to understand that just as God’s creative measuring sets\nthe ontological limits of everything God creates, so our corresponding\nmeasuring can at best be assimilative of the mind-independent things we\nwish to know but do not create or place in reality, and yet be creative\nin measuring and adjudicating the conceptual domain that results from\nour knowing them. \n\nBoth of these strands can seen to be operative in chapter 7 of The\nLayman: About Mind. There Cusanus gives a somewhat more\ndetailed account of how he sees the mind’s cognitive functions\noperating at the levels of sensation, imagination, reasoning and\nintellectual vision or intuition. Here, as in his later work\nentitled Compendium, we find that Nicholas inherited a\ntechnical vocabulary and conceptual framework for human knowing that\nembodies the medieval Aristotelian view that natural things are the\ncauses and measures of perceptual and conceptual human knowledge.\nOn that view, what we understand is to correspond to the intelligible\naspects of things that are mind-independent so that an identity in\nintelligibility between mind and thing results—the mind is\nmeasured by things. While Nicholas insists that the active, self-moving\nmind directs and integrates the joint operation of our knowing\ncapacities, he also agrees that the mind has no innate ideas and that\nmental life has to be awakened or stimulated by direct contact with the\nperceptible world. He never questions that the perceptible world\n(“the plurality of things”) exists and is independent of\nour minds and our knowledge. \n\nIt is the mind’s power to discriminate and make sense of what we\nperceive, imagine or remember that Cusanus emphasizes. He writes,\nspeaking of imagination, “When sensible things are not present,\nit [imagination] conforms itself to things in a confused way and\nwithout discriminating one condition from another. But [when]\nfunctioning with thinking imagination conforms itself to things while\ndiscriminating one condition from another.” (Idiota de\nmente, c.7) \n\nTo help us understand the mind’s engagement in perceptual\n“assimilation,” Nicholas turns to the work of sculptors and\ncraftsmen who use wax or clay to make an impression of some shape so\nthey can work from that likeness. When it is a matter of planning\nsomething to do or make, it is easy to see our minds as active.\nWhat about perceptual experiences where what we encounter is not up to\nus? Nicholas returns to the wax, asking us to imagine wax\ninformed by mind in the way mind informs our capacities for sensing and\nproposing that mind so imagined could “form the wax to every\nshape presented to it.” (c.7) Nicholas is saying, in\neffect, that “assimilation” in perception is indeed a\nmatter of reason’s active selecting and managing the deliverances\nof sense and imagination that result from our encounters with\nperceptible things. We are not mere passive recipients of colors,\nsounds, textures and so on, but our minds differentiate and connect\nperceptions and images in order to form concepts based on the\ndiscriminations of reason. \n\nNicholas avers that our knowledge of the natural and cultural world\nembodied in and made systematic in the technical and mechanical and\nliberal arts will remain “conjectural.” The reason is\nthat we are not dealing with the true reality of mind-independent\nthings whose true forms are one with God. We only encounter the\nphysically located temporal realities that are images of the really\nreal. As he remarks, “the notions that are attained through\nthe assimilations of reason are uncertain, because they are in accord\nwith the images of forms rather than with their true [forms].”\n(ibid., c.7) Only the concepts of mathematics are not\nconjectural because we fashion or construct these ideas\nourselves. Consequently our conceptions of them can be precise\nand certain, for as conceptual entities they escape the sorts of change\nand bodily limits characteristic of the physical world. \n\nBut this sketch of our knowing powers as assimilative does not settle\nwhat is normative for human knowing or what it means to take the mind\nas a measure. Nicholas takes up this explicitly a bit later in\nchapter 9 of The Layman: About Mind. When he is\nquestioned how the mind can be a measure adequate to such a variety of\nthings, the layman responds somewhat cryptically: \n\nEarlier the layman had described the human mind as a measure that\nsets limits, conceptual and linguistic boundaries, to all that it\nknows. What this presupposes are the requirements of any\nmeasuring, quantitative or qualitative: (1) something measurable\nto be ascertained, (2) a measure, that is a criterion or norm embodying\nstandard units, (3) the actual measuring that employs the norm, (4) the\nresults of the process, the measure taken. \n\nAll these requirements can be found in the passage above. What we\nwant to know counts as the cognitively measurable (“such a variety of\nthings”). These knowables span items in the natural world\nand the cultural sphere and their features, as well as concepts in the\nrealm of thought itself. The “concept, measure, or\nexemplar” is the qualitative norm the mind employs and of which\nit is the source. The mind does the actual measuring\n(“measures by itself”) and “makes itself a\nmeasure” or norm in judging and taking the measure of each item across the\nrange of things it knows. What results is the knowledge we obtain\nwhen the mind becomes “equal to such a variety of things” and\n“attains itself in everything.” Our knowledge\nincludes what we gain from everyday experience in society, from the\nnatural and human sciences, and from literature and the other arts. \n\nWhat does the reference to “absolute face” in the passage\nquoted come to? “Absolute” is a term Cusanus usually\nreserved for God as the infinite One free from every limitation and\nrestriction. Here it is transferred to our minds as images of\nGod. Our minds are not limited to quantitative measures and thus\ncan determine the conceptual measures or “units” that best\nfit or are adequate to the different sorts of things we want to\nknow. We can answer questions of “what sort,” not\njust of “how much.” Our concepts and judgments are\nassimilative or actively likened to what we know because we construct\nthe conceptual measures appropriate, if never wholly adequate, to what\nwe are investigating or thinking about. As thus relatively\nunrestricted or “absolute,” our minds can be conformed to\nwhatever is knowable in whatever way we can grasp it. Just as the\nabsolute divine “face” or mind is the infinite measure of\nall the creaturely minds that are its images, so the human mind\nmeasures the determinate conceptual realities that reflect its own finite\nunity or oneness. \n\nHuman concepts are measures insofar they involve choice and\nconstruction, application and interpretation, whether quantitative or\nqualitative. The use of a given group of concepts or a particular\nscheme of ideas or interpretative framework is a matter of human\ncreating. If we recognize some mind-independent phenomena we want\nto explore and come to know, whether in nature or in culture, we should\nalso recognize that it is up to us to construct and employ the\nappropriate cognitive measures in order to “take the\nmeasure” of the state of affairs in question. Being\nintroduced to some cognitive domain or area of practice we are\nunfamiliar with involves learning “a new vocabulary” and\nset of ideas already utilized and standard in that area.\nUnless and until we can understand the concepts and language in\nquestion, we cannot make sense out of what we perceive and continue to\nunderstand in our previous terms. \n\nThat Nicholas is using “measuring” in this sense is brought\nhome to us by the metaphor he employs in the passage quoted above from\nchapter 9 where he says the mind is “a living compass that\nmeasures by itself.” In contrast with a fixed or non-adjustable\nstraight ruler, a compass or caliper can be adjusted to fit a range of\nsizes and shapes. Cusanus’ fanciful “living”\ncompass reminds us that as knowers we can actively accommodate our\nideas to what we want to know. As a compass can be adjusted to\nfind the quantitative measure of a variety of sizes and shapes, so our\nminds are able to fashion, adopt, modify and utilize both the literal\nand the symbolic ideas and concepts available to us for exploring and\nunderstanding the natural, social and conceptual worlds we inherit and\nextend. \n\nThis may help us understand why Nicholas’ sketch of mens\ninvolves both the mind-independent things and the mind itself as\nnormative measures of the assimilation that is human cognition.\nWe become like the knowable features of the things we know and we\nfashion the conceptual and judgmental measures whereby we take them\ninto ourselves as known. The full determinate intelligibility of\nmind-independent things and states of affairs provides a kind of ideal\nlimit that we acknowledge in recognizing the inadequacy and\nshortcomings of what we do know about them. That is why Nicholas\ndeems our knowledge “conjectural.” \n\nAlong with providing this ideal limit to what we know, things outside\nthe mind also stand as referents that themselves measure our cognitive\nassimilating. Recognizing that they exist, we also acknowledge\nthat they are what our knowledge is about. And we constantly\nreturn to what we seek to understand to assess the adequacy of our\nconceptions and to correct any mistakes or misinterpretations in our\ninterpretations. Deprived of these independent measures, our\nknowledge has no reference outside the mind and no standard for\nrevising or improving our conceptual measures as more or less adequate\nto what we are trying to understand. \n\nThe Cusan answer, then, to the question of whether mind or the\nmind-independent realities are the “measures” of what we\nknow may thus be seen as an attempt to have it both ways. We are\nboth measured by the things we know and we construct the concepts and\nconceptual frameworks whereby we measure them, however\n“conjecturally.” There are situations and realities\nwe want to understand that challenge us to adjust to what we perceive,\nexamine, and experience. So, too, there are situations and\nrealities that require us to modify our ideas and concepts and symbols\nso that they will be consistent one with another and with the rest of\nour beliefs. \n\nNicholas of Cusa thus combines the metaphors of assimilatio\nand mensuratio in his account of what provides the cognitive\nnorms or criteria for human knowing. We cannot resolve the\ntension between the two that we find in what he says, but must hold\nonto it. The reason is that, as God’s images, we do not\ncreate but must recognize what God has created as independent of human\nknowledge. We may fashion the interpretative measures whereby we\nknow created things, but we do this while acknowledging that the full\nintelligibility of each determinate reality is ultimately identical\nwith God’s unknowable Oneness. We may aspire to full\nintelligibility but can reach it only in mathematics. That is why\nour best knowledge, even of the mind itself, remains conjectural,\nsharing God’s truth but limited to human ways of knowing. \n\nThe relationship between On Learned Ignorance and On\nConjectures sets a pattern for the many shorter theoretical works\nNicholas was to write in the two decades that followed. The basic\ninsights and the framework laid out in On Learned Ignorance\nis never discarded and never substantively modified. Instead Nicholas’\ndialogues and briefer treatises can be read as proposing many\ndifferent metaphors or symbols for understanding his teaching about\nthe relationship between God and creatures. Three examples of these\nmetaphors may give some idea of the power and freshness of his\nspeculative imagining. The first is his use of the icon and the wall\nin The Vision of God (1453); the second his attempt to\ncapture the God-creature connection by describing God as “Not\nOther” in the dialogue by that name (On the Not Other,\n1461); the third his fascination with mathematics and its symbolic\npotential. While Cusanus never surrenders his initial insight that\nthere is no proportion between infinite and finite, thinking through\nthese later symbols and neologisms lets us see how these indirect\nmeans enable some movement of mind and heart towards the divine\nMystery with whom we are ever connected. \n\nCusanus wrote The Vision of God in the form of a prayer,\nresponding to the request of the Benedictines of Tegernsee for a\ntreatise on mystical theology. With it he sent them an\n“all-seeing” icon and proposed an exercise for its use to\ngive them some understanding of God’s seeing their attempts to\nsee God. The icon was probably a “Veronica” or image\nof the face of the suffering Jesus in which the eyes were portrayed as\nlooking out of the picture plane. As a result, from whatever\nstandpoint one looked at the painting, it seemed the eyes of Jesus\nlooked directly into the viewer’s own eyes. Thus it could\nsymbolize at once both God’s vision of us and our vision of God\n(the combined objective and subjective senses of visio\nDei). \n\nNicholas begins by warning that “Whatever is apparent with regard\nto the icon of God’s sight is truer with regard to God’s\ntrue sight.”(c. 1) And what does appear when we place\nourselves with the monks viewing the painting and reflect? Since\nit is a painting we see, what we seem to experience as we look into the\neyes of Jesus is not really taking place. The face portrayed\nneither looks at nor sees anyone; in fact, the viewer’s gaze is\nthe norm for this experience of a face-to-face encounter. Yet\nbecause of the spatial and temporal simultaneity the apparent gaze of\nthe icon invites the viewer to enter into the world of the painting and\ntends to privilege what is portrayed, namely Jesus gazing at me.\nI move back and forth from my customary reactions when eyes are looking\ninto my eyes to the realization that this eye contact is\nillusory. \n\nBut the illusory image in this case is of Christ suffering and looking\nat me. If this painting is to mediate between my reality and what\nit portrays, it obviously invites me to look beyond, since this is an\nimage of the One who is the image of the Father. Twice\nremoved from the actual divine seeing and being seen it is supposed to\nsymbolize, Nicholas’ use of this icon lets us understand how far\nwe stand from God’s own seeing. Yet Nicholas’ initial\nwarning also reminds us that what is symbolized here by the painting is\nall the more so in reality. We are in truth preceded and embraced\nby Christ’s seeing us. \n\nIn seeing we are seen—this mutual relatedness is at least what\nthe icon symbolizes. But Nicholas goes further, proposing that\nGod’s seeing and God’s being seen are identical: \n\nIn this way God seen is identically God seeing. The reason is\nthat for God to be seen by any creature is nothing else than for God to\n“see” that creature gazing. But the icon also reminds\nus of our distance from seeing God. I can see the depicted eyes\nof Jesus even though no real eyes are present. But I cannot see\nthe divine face or its vision even though God’s reality is\npresent and “sees” me. The dialectic of divine\npresence and absence, of human seeing and not seeing that I experience\nwith the icon is thus turned inside out. When I look at the icon\nof Christ, what seems present, its seeing, is really absent, yet\nGod’s seeing is really present though it seems absent. \n\nWhat the icon thus symbolizes is the experienced simultaneous\nconnection of different levels of reality. Indeed, I have\nseparate reality as a contracted image of God only through my relation\nto my divine Source. What is telling about Nicholas’\nversion of seeing God is neither what vision discerns nor what\npractices one must follow in order to gain the correct standpoint for\nsuch seeing. Rather he revises the meaning of “seeing\nGod” so that God is both subject and object of our purported\nvision of God. \n\nYet this vision of God is merely purported. Cusanus leads us\nthrough a series of reflections on seeing and on the face of God only\nto let us realize that, whatever ratio or discursive reason\ncomes to realize, God is located beyond both imaginative exercise and\nconceptual understanding. Nicholas symbolizes our approach to\nthis beyond by encouraging us to enter “into a certain secret and\nhidden silence wherein there is no knowledge or concept of a\nface,” characterizing it as an “obscuring mist, haze,\ndarkness or ignorance.” (c.6) He invokes the\ncoincidence of opposites from On Learned Ignorance and, in\nchapter 9 of The Vision of God, proposes his second central\nmetaphor: the wall of paradise. God dwells inside this\nwall, and the wall also symbolizes the coincidence of opposites and\nthus the defeat of discursive reason and the principle of\ncontradiction. \n\nJust how are we to think through the coincidence of opposites and\nattempt to move beyond the wall to some sort of “seeing”\nGod? Nicholas proposes that three locations in relation to the wall\nmap three stages in the mystical quest, using the metaphorical couple\nof “enfolding/unfolding” from On Learned\nIgnorance. Reason can understand things enfolded in or identical\nwith God as different from the same things unfolded in the created\nuniverse. At this first stage we are outside the wall. The second\nstage is at the wall itself, where Nicholas places us with Christ at\nthe door or threshold of an entrance in the wall. Here enfolding and\nunfolding coincide and we encounter the barrier of the coincidence of\nopposites. At best we acknowledge that creating and being created are\none and the same in God. A third stage is beyond the entrance and\ninside the wall where enfolding/unfolding fall away and Cusanus points\nto God’s silent presence and utter transcendence, “free from\nwhatever can be spoken of or thought of” (c.11) The third stage\ninvolves recognition that God’s infinity remains unknowable to us in\nconceptual terms. \n\nCusanus proposes some possible indirect routes that will give us no\npositive insight or conceptual grasp of the divine Essence. For\ninstance, if we look to the very oppositions and contradictions that\nplague our normal thinking about God, we may do more justice to the\nunique relation between God and creatures. In his words,\n“the oppositeness of opposites is oppositeness without\noppositeness.” (c.13) He identifies the infinite God with\nthis “oppositeness of opposites.” Now the\n“opposites” in question are the ordinary things of our\nexperience that are separate and distinct and that may have opposed or\nmutually exclusive properties. \n\nDesignating God as the Oppositeness of such opposites can take us from\nthe distinctions and oppositions with which we are familiar to the One\nwho is responsible for there being such oppositions. God is\ndistinct from these oppositions and differences but only in a way that\nestablishes their reality. Yet God’s oppositeness is\n“without oppositeness” since God’s distinctiveness is\nunlimited and beyond familiar oppositions. In fact, God’s\noppositeness encompasses or enfolds all opposites in God as identically\nGod and encompasses or unfolds all opposites in creation by\nconstituting them as what they are in all their determinate, finite\ndifferences. We are to think together both the way\nfinite things are opposed and God’s transcendent\noppositeness that is “opposed” to those opposites, not as\nthey are to one another, but so as to be ontologically responsible for\nthe oppositions with which we are familiar. \n\nIn De li Non Aliud/On the Not Other (1462) Nicholas returns\nto the ancient Platonic categories of the One and the Other in order to\nre-construe in novel language what Christians believe about the\ndependence of creatures on their Creator. Several of\nCusanus’ later works use verbal coinages or Latin neologisms as\n“names” or characterizations of God that are original with\nhim, though they have earlier echoes in Christian Neoplatonism.\nIn this dialogue he uses the expression “the not other” as\na substantive for God as the divine Not-Other, even though we are more\nfamiliar with the phrase in comparative expressions that are negative\nways of stating self-identity. For instance, “the tree is\nnot other than (= the same as, identical with) the\ntree.” \n\nWhen we use reason to recognize differences and to make distinctions,\nwe are attempting to do justice to the plurality and variety of the\nnatural and cultural realms with which we are most familiar. Even\nthings of the same kind are different numerically, and speaking and\nthinking clearly about things and their features requires our\ndifferentiating what is determinate about them. We expect them to\nstay the same as they are and to remain different from other things and\nwe reflect this in our language of identity and difference when we\ndescribe and define what we perceive and understand. \n\nNicholas is attempting to capitalize on the way we differentiate\ncreated things to signal and symbolize their divine Creator.\nWhile each created thing is not other than itself, so to speak, it\ncertainly is other or different from other things. And\ncreated things are different from God as well. But Nicholas is\nproposing a way of “naming” God that will underline how\nGod’s difference from God’s creatures is not even close to\none creature’s difference from another creature.\nGod’s difference is categorially different, so to speak, from one\ncreature’s otherness from a second creature. Cusanus can\nthus paradoxically assert that God is “not other” than\nanything God has created and is sustaining in being. Indeed, we\ndo well to think of God as “the Not-Other.” \n\nHere is what Nicholas writes: \n\nWe may paraphrase this rather cryptic passage as follows. The\ndivine Not-Other is simply not one of the things we are familiar with\nin the world we inhabit, where all is multiplicity and difference,\nwhere each thing or state of affairs is other than or different from\nevery other existent thing or situation that obtains. Nicholas\nterms the multiple things we deal with “others” because\neach one of them, each “other,” is distinct from every\nother thing. Nicholas also proposes that such finite things\npossess and lack what things different from them possess—to be\nother or distinct is precisely not to be one or any of the finite\nothers. Our language and thought busy themselves in finding and\nmaking further distinctions and divisions between things and parts of\nthings, between one condition and another, between one state of affairs\nand another. So we come to know that one thing is other than or\nseparate from another thing or that we find it in another that is\nrelated to, yet different from, something else. \n\nNicholas’ central point is that the divine Not-Other is nothing\nlike all the finite, limited others of our experience. Nicholas\nwrites, “Not Other does not lack anything.” Even in\ncommon sense terms, any given thing is “plenty lacking,” to\nspeak colloquially. No matter what it has, it arguably is lacking\nsome of what it should have as a specimen of its type, and it certainly\nlacks what other things not of its kind possess. One way to think of\nthe finite things with which we are familiar is to consider that their\nbeing limited means that they are just so much and not more. But this\nis exactly how we should not think of God, who “does not lack\nanything” and outside of whom nothing can exist. As\nNicholas says, “But God is Not-Other because God is not other\nthan other, even though ‘not other’ and ‘other’\nseem opposed. But other is not opposed to God from whom it has that it\nis other.” (c.6) \n\nThe opposition in this case is entirely different because, though\ncreatures are dependent functions of God and may be interdependent\nfunctions of one another, God is not a dependent function of\ncreatures. God is precisely not any of the others and so is not\nother or different in the way creatures are. We thus have two\nsorts of differentiation or otherness, the opposition between distinct\ncreatures and the opposition between creatures and God. The\n“Not” in “Not-Other” differentiates God from\ncreatures but does not exclude the divine Not-Other since the Not-Other\nontologically determines creatures. Thinking God as Not-Other\nrequires a characteristic Cusan dialectical thinking, not simply\naffirming or denying difference. We are to recognize and\nacknowledge that the divine Not-Other is both not one of the\nothers and at once not other than any or all of them. \n\nTo put this more formally, the difference or opposition between created\nthings is both symmetrical and transitive. The basis for their\ndistinction is their identity: their symmetrical otherness is the\nresult of their substantial not-otherness, so to speak. But\ncreated things’ difference from God is asymmetrical and\nintransitive. True, the divine Not-Other is not one of the\ncreatures, but in a different way than they are different from one\nanother. Cusanus gives expression to this important difference\nbetween finite and Infinite when he asserts that the divine Not-Other\nis not other than any created other. Negatively, the\nNot-Other is not finite as the others are; positively, the reflexivity\ncharacteristic of a limited thing’s self-identity also\ncharacterizes the Not-Other’s relation with it. \n\nJust as any creature is not other than itself so it is not other than\nthe divine Not-Other. The divine Not-Other both is and is not\nevery finite other. The reason is that distinct created things\npossess their very status as beings, and thus their otherness, from and\nthrough God. God, the divine Not-Other, is causally responsible\nfor things’ existing as separate and self-identical\nothers. For Nicholas, nothing can have being outside of\nGod. Recent publications, and in particular,\nD.Albertson’s Mathematical Theologies(2014), have\nhighlighted another key theme and its attendant metaphors in Nicholas’\nworks: mathematics and number. Cusanus believes that no knowledge we\nhave is more certain than mathematics, given that it is the\nconstruction of our own minds.  Mathematical ideas are the paradigm of\nhow the human mind unfolds a conceptual universe that parallels and\nforms an image of God’s unfolding of the created world. Number here\nrefers primarily to arithmetic and geometry, to the whole numbers and\nto plane and solid figures. The latter are often imagined as in\nmovement or constructing other figures.  Nicholas joins\nenfolding/unfolding and the certainty of mathematics to the Christian\ntradition that everything is created in the divine word or Logos. \n\nGeometrical figures are used early in Book 1 of On Learned\nIgnorance to illustrate how our knowledge of created things is\nonly approximative.  A bit later we are led to extrapolate straight\nand curved lines as an aid to understanding the coincidence of\nopposites and to moving human thought towards the God who is\nunknowable by reason. Book 2 uses number to illustrate enfolding and\nunfolding—as the number series unfolds what is enfolded in the unit,\nso God unfolds all created things.  Nicholas later introduces the\ngeometrical image of the sphere whose center is everywhere and whose\ncircumference is nowhere to explain how the physical universe’s lack\nof boundaries is an image of God’s infinity. Book 2 also opens and\ncloses with reflection on the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music\nand astronomy. Book 3 returns to the image of the infinite sphere for\nthe combination of absolute and contracted reality in the God-man. \n\nOn Conjectures moves directly into arithmetic and geometry\nwith its conjectural reflections on the decade’s embracing all number\nand with its ordering of reality’s oneness and otherness using the\nspatial diagrams P and U that employ cones and spheres.  Just as the\nnumber series unfolds the unit, so the created universe unfolds God’s\ncreating, and human concepts (such as numbers and geometric figures)\nunfold the oneness of the human mind.  In this way a human being is\ntruly a “second God.” \n\nNicholas’ later works of the 1450s extend the notion of number and of\nenfolding/unfolding that he inherited from Boethius and the\ntwelfth-century school of Chartres.  Number and size (multitudo et\nmagnitudo) are central to The Layman: On Mind where\nmeasuring is proposed as the layman’s definition of the human mind.\nMeasuring is then used directly in The Layman: Experiments with\nWeights. Nicholas proposes that the Divine Word in whom all\nthings are created or unfolded in time is to be thought together with\nhuman measuring as the closest sign or image of the Divine Oneness. In\nthe background stands the saying from the Book of Wisdom11.21\nthat in creating God ordered “all things in measure, number and\nweight.”  This way number and mathematical ideas take on more than\ntheir usual employment for human ends and become a way to the Creator\nalways present to creaturely unfoldings in human thought.  \n\nThe Vision of God (1453) proposes an exercise for the monks\nbased on the center and circumference of circle wherein seeing from\nthe circumference and being seen from the center collapse into a\nfigure of mystical oneness: being seen seeing.  In the same year\nNicholas composes Complementary Theological Considerations (De\ntheologicis complementis). There he features God as a\nmathematician who creates in the Equality of the Divine\nWord—unfolding as well human beings whose quadrivial mathematics is\nan image of the divine creativity. God is now named “infinite angle”\nthat unites maximal and minimal angles and the non-quantitative number\nof everything. Nicholas thus brings together his theological and\nmathematical concepts from the 1440s and unites number,\nenfolding/unfolding and the Divine Word. \n\nHow does Nicholas’ Neoplatonism aid his thinking about\nGod? One advantage is that Nicholas can take the basic asymmetry\nbetween paradigmatic Platonic Forms and the perceptible realm of\nparticular things that are images of the Forms and apply that asymmetry\nto the way the First Principle, God, is related to all other created\nrealities. In working out this relationship, Plato proposed that\nwhat results for individual Forms is that all particulars\n“participate” in the relevant Form just the way an image\nreflects and depends on its original. That is to say, the Form\ndoes not require the particulars but is prior ontologically. The\nrelation between Form and particulars is not one of reciprocal\ndependence. Applied to the first ontological principle, or to the\nChristian God, the result is to let all the multiple, complex creatures\nparticipate in their ultimate Source while the divine Creator remains\nsimple, unparticipated and unchanged. As Christian medieval\nthinkers (even the Aristotelians agreed on this point) were accustomed\nto express it, creatures depend on God while God is not at all\ndependent on creatures. All the dependence is one-way. \n\nAnd that dependence is interpreted in Platonic and Biblical terms,\nas the dependence of creaturely images on a divine Original.\nWhile the total reality of an image requires the influence of the\noriginal, there is nothing about the latter that is ontologically in\nneed of the image. In Platonism this effectively means there is\n“separation” of the intelligible and perceptible realms,\nfor in fact the perceptible cannot exist without the very intelligible\nthat abides unaffected by the realm of multiplicity and change. While\nnot being themselves Forms, perceptible things are not really separate\nfrom the intelligible Forms on which they depend. No less than\nForm and perceptible thing in Platonism and Neoplatonism, in Christian\nNeoplatonism Creator and creature are bound together in a parallel\nasymmetry. \n\nIf this asymmetry is rethought in terms of the presence required for\nthe creatures to be all that they are by nature, it will turn out that\nGod (or the One in non-Christian Neoplatonisms), the greater and prior\nreality, must always be there if creaturely reality is to be\nforthcoming and to continue. Now creatures as created images can\nstand for manifestation and reflection of (and for Christian thinkers,\nlikeness to) as well as for dependence on God, for the divine presence penetrates\nand encompasses each and all creatures without ever being limited or\ncaptured by any of them. While Plato’s Forms play a\ndefinitive role in the perceptible realm as responsible for the\ndeterminate characteristics of things, they count as a kind of present\nabsence. No less determinative is the ongoing presence of the\nChristian God and that, too, has become a kind of absence. How\nshould we attempt to understand this? \n\nOur conceptions of the absence or presence of one thing to another are\ntaken originally from and remain most at home in the realm of limited\nphysical beings. Here presence to or absence from another involves the\nsame sort of mutuality or reciprocity that the same corporeal realm of\nlimited things must always manifest. If body A is present to or absent\nfrom body B, B is present to or absent from A and vice versa. The\nother sorts of important presence or absence we are familiar\nwith—presence in thought, in memory and imagination and\naffection, for instance—are metaphorical to some degree and are\nextensions from and find their source in our experience of some prior\nphysical presence, whether merely perceived and understood, or hoped\nfor, or feared. So too with the kinds of metaphorical absence we\nrecognize when some present person is, as we say, “just not\nthere.” And absence, whether indifferent, bad or good,\npresupposes presence. Such metaphorical presences and absences of\nlimited things to one another might thus be understood as absent\npresences or present absences. \n\nAnd so we are able to speculate about the case of a non-finite\npresence-in-absence by starting with but moving beyond the limits of\nthe presence and absence we are familiar with in the realm of limited\nthings. Now we turn to the presence of the unfamiliar infinite One as\nwhat is finally required, even if not obviously experienced, to keep\nthe creaturely image present and real. In this case, we may think that\nabsence becomes what is metaphorical and the presence of the First is\nin truth ineluctably and literally necessary to explain the reality of\nanything and everything. But God’s presence is hardly like that of one\nphysical thing to another. \n\nThis means that the presence of God and God’s identity with\nthings is not to be thought as the kind of reciprocity, say, that two\ncreated physical things have that are present to one another, let alone\nsimilar or identical to each other. What is distinctive about Christian Neoplatonism is\nits ability to hold together dialectically in thought the insight it\nprovides about this asymmetrical, non-reciprocal ontological connection\nbetween God and creatures. God penetrates and surpasses or\nexceeds each thing God creates and encompasses. Creatures are thus\nthemselves real with the limited sort of independence they manifest,\nyet they are at once in God and indeed one with God without being\nthemselves divine. \n\nBut what has all this to do with Nicholas of Cusa’s having a\nNeoplatonism of his own? What is characteristic of his thought, I want\nto propose, is that in key passages of major works he proposes this\nsame kind of dialectical thinking to enable our grasping the general\nrelationship between God and creatures. But the thinking is supposed to\nreflect an ontological dialectic, that is to say, a relationship that\nis real whether we acknowledge it or not. The dialectical\nrelation between God and creatures is something towards which we mostly\ngesture in our efforts to do it justice in thought and speech.\nBut is this not merely Proclus or Dionysius or Eriugena or Eckhart\nrevisited in the fifteenth century? The answer is both yes and\nno. \n\nYes, the dialectical reality envisioned by Nicholas should be little\ndifferent than that pointed to by earlier Christian\nNeoplatonists. Neither Plato’s Forms nor the Christian God\ndid or could change over the centuries nor did the need of particulars\nand creatures for their intelligible and divine originals. But\nalso, no, for Cusanus gives the dialectical relation his own expression\nin a series of novel metaphors for the connection between God and\ncreatures. Some of his original metaphors, such as the\ncoincidence of opposites, enfolding/unfolding, God as the Not Other,\nand as the Oppositeness of opposites, are controlled by and witness to\nthat same asymmetrical relationship, yet lead our speculative\nimaginations in some new directions that would otherwise remain\nunexplored. \n\nIf only God can bespeak Godself in literal terms, then we humans are\ngraced with metaphors. What Cusanus provides in his metaphorical forays\nis not simply imaginative originality, but a series of metaphors\ndesigned to remind us that there is no proportion between creatures and\ncreator; that indeed there is an asymmetry between them.\nMoreover, our best ways of conceiving and asserting this necessary lack\nof reciprocal dependence should be built into the metaphors we\nchoose. This is why one may not need a theory of metaphor to do\njustice to the Cusan project of philosophical theology. Rather,\nthe Cusan project is Neoplatonic and has its own traditional strictures\non any metaphors he chooses: the ontology determines the metaphors, the\nmetaphors do not determine the ontology. What makes\nNicholas’ thought a Neoplatonism of his own is precisely the\ngrasp his metaphors demonstrate of those ontological strictures, as\nwell as the speculative imagination he evinces in the range,\noriginality and variety of metaphors for what we can and cannot\nunderstand about God’s connection with creatures. Nicholas of Cusa has attracted frequent notice in the history of\npolitical ideas because of his early work, The Catholic\nConcordance/De Concordantia Catholica (1433–34).  This lengthy\nwork in three books is aimed first of all at an ecclesiatical audience\nat the Council of Basel and only secondarily, in Book 3, at the Holy\nRoman Empire and its electors of the emperor.  Nicholas’ ideas stand\nsquarely in the conciliarist tradition following proposals from the\nCouncil of Constance (1414–18), and thus privilege the council’s\nauthority above the pope’s. In Book 1 he expounds a hierarchical view\nof creation and of the church, following Dionysius the Areopagite.\nThen he uses both canon law and historical documents from and about\nthe early church councils to undergird his view of council and papacy.\nYet he never denies the importance of the positions of pope and\nemperor. Throughout Nicholas works to harmonize\n(=concordantia) the many different strands in church law and\npolitical theory. \n\nOver the last century scholars of political history have singled out\nchapters, particularly in Book 2, where Nicholas discusses consent as\na prerequisite for legitimate law and government.  Going beyond\ntradition and canon law, he argues on the basis of people’s natural\nfreedom (“men are by nature equal in power and equally free”) that all\ngovernance comes from the consent of the subjects.  This argument to\nexplicitly institutionalize consent is Nicholas’ original\ncontribution.  He follows it with proposals on representation that\nmove from representation as virtual impersonation to representation as\ndelegation based on those represented selecting their\nrepresentatives. This is one of the first explicit statements in the\nWest of the institutional limits to be placed on rulers and of the\nidea that people must consent to their representative\ninstitutions. \n\nEven after he changed allegiance to the side of papal supremacy,\nNicholas used his ideas to argue in later brief writings that Basel\nwas not truly representative and that consent was embodied in the\ncollege of cardinals.  In the following centuries, secular parliaments\nreturned to ideas of consent and representation (though not directly\nto Nicholas’ book) in attempting to restrict the power of monarchs.\nIn the church itself, tradition continued to outweigh innovation, and\nthe idea of conciliar superiority to the pope seemed dead for\ncenturies. Some twentieth-century thinking in the Roman Catholic\nChurch has returned to and enlivened ideas about council and papacy\npropounded by Nicholas of Cusa.","contact.mail":"clyde.miller@stonybrook.edu","contact.domain":"stonybrook.edu"}]
