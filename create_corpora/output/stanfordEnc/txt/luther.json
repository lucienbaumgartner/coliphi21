Whilst he is primarily seen as a theologian,\nthe philosophical interest and impact of his ideas is also\nsignificant, so that he arguably deserves to be ranked as highly\nwithin philosophy as other theologians in the Christian tradition,\nsuch as Augustine or Aquinas. Nonetheless, in Luther’s case this\nmay seem more problematic, as his attitude to philosophy and indeed\nreason can be hostile and dismissive. On closer inspection, however,\nit is clear that his position is more nuanced than that, and requires\ncontextualisation: for his objection is only to reason put to certain\ntheological ends, while his own thought is deeply steeped in the\nphilosophical tradition, and contributed to it. At the same time,\nLuther’s ideas had a fundamental influence on northern European\nphilosophers who came after him, such as Leibniz, Kant, Hegel,\nSchelling, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Feuerbach, and Heidegger, all of\nwhom worked within a broadly Lutheran context, and against the\nbackground of central Lutheran assumptions, often inculcated in them\nthrough their upbringing and\n education.[1]\n \n\nSeveral key issues in Luther’s work make him of interest to\nphilosophers and not just theologians or Reformation historians, and\nwill be covered in this entry: his conception of the relation between\ntheology and philosophy, and the place of reason in that relation; his\nnegative conception of Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition, and\nhis relation to the nominalist alternative; his conception of divine\nand human freedom; and his conception of ethics and of social and\npolitical life. Luther’s influence on subsequent philosophers in\nthe Lutheran tradition is considered in more detail in the\nseparate entry on \n Luther’s influence on philosophy.\n\nLuther lived an interesting life in interesting times—where to a\nsignificant degree those times were made interesting by his\nlife’s impact upon them. This impact began with the publication\nof his Ninety-Five Theses on 31 October 1517, in which as a\nyoung professor at Wittenberg he attacked the Church’s sale of\nindulgences; this was then followed by various further disputations\nand disputes as well as published works that defended his increasingly\nradical position, leading to his excommunication in 1521 and his\nfamously defiant appearance at the Diet of Worms. Managing to escape\ncapture under the protection of Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony,\nand after a period of seclusion at Wartburg castle, Luther returned to\nWittenberg, where he continued his teaching, writing and translating;\nmarried; and engaged with the complex and fraught swirl of forces\nunleashed by his work at various levels—in theology, in the\nChurch, in politics, and in society at large. While he had fathered\nthe Reformation, as it has become known, he did not set out to divide\nthe Christian Church, and the movement quickly took on a momentum that\nhe could not control, but which still in certain fundamental ways\nbears the stamp of his thought. \nLuther was born on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben in the Holy Roman\nEmpire, not into the peasantry as he liked to claim, but into a\nrelatively prosperous mining\n family.[2]\n His father, Hans, gave him a good education, intending for him to\nbecome a lawyer and thus assist the family business. In 1501 Luther\nwent from school to the University of Erfurt, where in 1505 he became\na Master of Arts, a degree which included the study and teaching of\nAristotle, while he was also exposed to nominalism and to humanism.\nHowever, rather than continuing with his legal training, later in the\nsame year Luther chose instead to enter the Augustinian monastery at\nErfurt, much to the annoyance of his father—and as Luther\nexplained it later, on the basis of a vow made in a violent thunder\nstorm to St Anna (the patron saint of miners), that this is what he\nwould do if he was spared. Whatever the truth in this story, in his\nown mind at least Luther seems to have understood his change of\ndirection as a kind of conversion experience, and the entry into a new\ntype of spiritual life. \nHowever, Luther did not find this life an easy one, later recalling\nthat while he tried to live without reproach and made full use of\nconfession, he still felt that he “was a sinner before God with\nan extremely disturbed conscience” (“Preface to the\nComplete Edition of Luther’s Latin Writings”, 1545, WA\n54:185/LW 34:336), in spite of the reassurances given him by his\nmentor Johann von Staupitz (1468–1524), then vicar-general of\nthe observant wing of the Augustinians. This anxiety and fear meant\nthe Luther underwent what he termed Anfechtungen, spiritual\ntrials or temptations, as fears about his salvation could lead him to\nturn against God, while in later years he felt he was struggling with\nthe devil. Luther was further disturbed by his father’s response\nwhen attending the first Mass at which his son officiated upon being\nordained in 1507: his father suggested that Luther’s vow to St\nAnna may have been forced out of him by the devil, causing him to\nbreak the commandment to obey one’s parents. Some commentators\nhave speculated that these two difficult relationships with father\nfigures are not unconnected (for a classic but controversial study,\nsee Erikson 1958; see also Roper 2016: 48–49). \nAs a monk in the monastery at Erfurt and as a temporary lecturer at\nWittenberg, Luther’s education continued under his teachers\nJodocus Trutfetter (1460–1519) and Bartholomaeus Arnoldi of\nUsingen (1465–1532), as he followed a theology curriculum\ndominated by Ockhamism, studying central texts such as Peter\nLombard’s Sentences and commentaries on them by Gabriel\nBiel and Pierre d’Ailly, Aristotle’s works with\nOckham’s commentaries, and major works by Augustine, while also\nlecturing on some of them. In 1512 Luther replaced Staupitz at the\nuniversity in Wittenberg as professor of the Bible, a position he was\nto hold until his\n death.[3]\n Earlier in the same year, Luther made his only excursion beyond\nGerman lands, travelling to Rome on behalf of Staupitz; he was later\nto present this as an experience that began to turn him against the\nreligious rituals and practices he found there, including that of\nindulgences. \nIt was this issue of indulgences that in 1517 led Luther to write\nninety-five theses intended for debate or disputation on the topic,\ncriticising this widespread practice as selling the remission of sins;\nthis practice had been intensified by the efforts of Pope Leo X to\nraise funds for a new basilica of St Peter in Rome, efforts that were\nspearheaded locally by a Dominican friar Johann Tetzel. While\naccording to legend Luther nailed the text of the theses to the church\ndoor, in reality it seems he merely sent them to Archbishop Albrecht\nof Mainz, and perhaps they were posted up on the door by someone else;\nbut it was thanks to printed versions that they soon began to\ncirculate more widely. This condemnation of indulgences was an act of\nsome defiance within the politics of the Church, as was the criticism\nof the authority of the power of the Pope which Luther associated with\nit; but earlier in the same year Luther had taken a step of a more\nintellectually radical kind with another set of theses, that have come\nto be called his Disputation Against Scholastic Theology, and\nwhich grew out of his lectures and reading in previous years,\nparticularly his engagement with Psalms, Paul’s letters, and the\nworks of Augustine and the latter’s attacks on Pelagianism. In\nthis disputation, written with characteristic vehemence, Luther\nsketched out what may be called an uncompromising Augustinianism in\nopposition to what are portrayed as the more Pelagian positions of\nfigures such as Scotus, Ockham, and Biel, behind which was said to\nstand the malign influence of Aristotle. At the heart of this dispute,\nas we shall see, is the key issue of grace, and whether this can be\nattained and earned through our efforts by “doing what in us\nlies” (facere quod in se est). This question raised in\nthe context of scholastic theology also provides the intellectual\nbackground to Luther’s argument against indulgences in the\nNinety-Five Theses, which to him were in effect just another\ndubious method of gaining merit. \nIt was against this background that around this time Luther had his\nso-called “tower experience”, which like the thunder\nstorm, was later portrayed by Luther as a life-changing moment in a\nway that may be more myth than fact, and is named after the tower of\nthe monastery in Wittenberg where it is said to have occurred (1532,\nWA TR 3 no 3232a–c/LW 54:193–4). In recounting the event,\nLuther explains that he came to radically re-think how it is that\njustification and hence salvation is possible for us at all: namely\nnot through our attempts to conform to God’s law, but through\nfaith as a form of “passive righteousness”. From this\nrealization, Luther later claimed (in his preface to the edition of\nhis works published in his life time) that he was freed from his anger\nagainst an accusing God, and the anxiety that no such God could ever\nbe known to be placated; instead he now recognised God’s\ngratuitous love and salvation, bestowed on us through divine grace\n(1545, WA 54:186/LW 34:336–7). \nLuther was able to develop this new position further in another\ndisputation, this time held in Heidelberg in 1518, where thanks to the\ncontroversy unleashed by the Ninety-five Theses, he was\ninvited by Staupitz to present his theological ideas to the triennial\nassembly of the German Augustinians. In this Heidelberg\nDisputation, Luther continued his assault on “works\nrighteousness”, and developed further an associated attack on\nfree will, while he also presented a contrast that was to prove\nfundamental to his thinking, between a “theology of glory”\nand a “theology of the cross”. He associated the former\nwith his opponents, and himself with the latter, arguing that it is\nonly through despair at our failure to gain salvation for ourselves\nthat we are truly made ready to be given salvation through grace. It\nnow became clear to his audience that Luther (who to mark this change\nin perspective had just previously started signing himself\n“Luther” in short for “eleutherios”\nor the “freed one”, instead of his family’s actual\nname of “Luder”) was attempting not merely to confront\nthe Church on the issue of indulgences, but also to question what he\nperceived to be its misguided theological outlook. \nLuther’s position on indulgences, and his challenge to the Pope,\nhad now begun to draw the attention of higher authorities in the\nChurch, and in 1518 he was summoned to Augsburg to meet with the papal\nlegate Cardinal Tommaso de Vio, known as Cajetan, who was\ninvestigating the matter. He tried to get Luther to recant, but he\nrefused to back down in any way. In 1519, Luther travelled to Leipzig\nfor another disputation, this time with Johann Eck, a theologian who\nhad earlier criticised his Ninety-Five Theses. The\nconfrontation was a highly charged affair, also conducted in printed\npamphlets and associated satirical texts written by supporters, in\nwhich Luther again vehemently defended his ground. Eck then travelled\nto Rome to make his case, hence contributing to the papal decision to\nissue the bull Exsurge Domine on 15 June 1520, which\nthreatened to excommunicate this troublesome opponent. \nLuther’s response was characteristically defiant, later that\nyear burning the bull in front of his supporters in Wittenberg, while\nhimself accusing the Pope of heresy and worse in his reposts which\nincluded Against the Cursed Bull of the Antichrist. Having\njust published his Treatise on Good Works in which he set out\nhis fundamental position on the relation between grace and works,\nLuther responded to this new situation in three significant writings\nalso published in 1520: Address to the Christian Nobility of the\nGerman Nation, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church,\nand The Freedom of a Christian. The first two texts argue his\ncase against the Pope and key practices of the Church, and the third\nreflects on how freedom is possible for human beings trapped in sin.\nUnsurprisingly, given his recalcitrance, Luther’s formal\nexcommunication followed on 3 January 1521, in the bull Decet\nRomanum Pontificem. This was followed by a summons from Charles\nV, the recently elected head of the Holy Roman Empire, for Luther to\nattend the Diet, or regular imperial assembly, at Worms. Choosing to\naccept the summons despite the great personal risks involved, knowing\nthat in rather similar circumstances the Czech theologian Jan Hus (c.\n1372–1415) had been burnt at the stake for heresy, Luther was\nonce more asked to recant, and once more he refused. It is again\ndoubtful whether he actually uttered the famous words “here I\nstand, I cannot do otherwise”, but he is recorded as summarizing\nhis position by saying:  \nUnless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear\nreason (for I do not trust either in the Pope or in councils alone,\nsince it is well known that they often erred and contradicted\nthemselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my\nconscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not\nretract anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against\nconscience. (1521, WA 7:838/LW 32:112) \nFearing for his safety after this defiant performance, which did\nindeed lead to the Edict of Worms declaring him a heretic and an\noutlaw, Luther was spirited away to the Wartburg castle under the\nprotection of the Elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise. Barring a\nbrief secret visit back to Wittenberg in December 1521, he was based\nthere until he could return openly to the city on 6 March 1522. While\nat the Wartburg he began his German translation of the New Testament,\nwhich would be followed (in serialised fashion) by the Old Testament,\nand eventually the landmark Luther Bible of 1534/1545. He also\nresponded to criticism in support of the Pope by a Louvain theologian\nin Against Latomus (1522), re-iterating key elements of his\nposition concerning the relation between sin and grace in forceful\nlanguage.  \nAs well as responding to attacks from the Catholic Church, in this\nperiod Luther began to face increasing challenges from his “own \npeople” within the reform movement \n itself.[4]\n Upon returning to Wittenberg from his relative\nseclusion, Luther found himself embroiled in controversies over the\ndirection being taken by other figures such as Andreas Bodenstein von\nKarlstadt (1486–1541) and Thomas Müntzer (c.\n1489–1525), and was caught up in associated theological\ndisputes, while also facing growing political opposition. Luther\npreached the Invocavit (Lenten) Sermons which restored order to the\ncity, and responded to his fellow reformers in A Sincere\nAdmonition by Martin Luther to all Christians to Guard against\nInsurrection and Rebellion (1522), and to some of these political\ndifficulties in his pamphlet On Temporal [or secular: weltlicher] Authority: To What Extent it\nShould be Obeyed (1523), in which he drew a distinction between\ntwo kingdoms or empires (die zwei Reiche) in an attempt to\nmake clear where he took the limits of the power of princes to lie.\nNow no longer a monk, he published On the Estate of Marriage\nin 1522, and himself married Katharina von Bora in 1525, after she had\nleft her convent with other nuns, convinced by Luther’s\narguments against monasticism. The marriage was a successful and happy one, and they were to have six children\ntogether, of whom two daughters were to die young, affecting Luther greatly. Meanwhile, theological and doctrinal disputes\nwere to persist for the rest of Luther’s career, on issues such\nas the Eucharist (or Lord's Supper: Heiliges Adendmahl) and baptism, both within the evangelical movement\ninvolving figures such as the sacramentarian Karlstadt, and the Swiss\nreformers Ulrich Zwingli (1484–1531) and Johannes Oecolampadius\n(1482–1531), and outside it with the Anabaptists. On both\nissues, Luther resisted the accounts of these sacraments as having a\nmere symbolic value, often arguing that this viewpoint comes from an\nurge to put reason above the authority of scripture (see, for example,\nAgainst the Heavenly Prophets (1525, WA 18:62–125,\n134–214/LW 40:79–223), That These Words of Christ,\n“This is My Body”, Etc., Still Stand Firm Against the\nFanatics (1527, WA 23:38–320/LW 37:3–150), and\nConcerning Rebaptism (1528, WA 26:144–74/LW\n40:229–62)).  \nIn 1524, Luther faced criticism from a different quarter, as the\nleading Christian humanist Desiderius Erasmus was finally persuaded to\nengage with Luther’s position in print, and despite\nLuther’s earlier hopes for his\n endorsement,[5]\n chose instead to focus critically on the latter’s view of\nfreedom which had been initially expressed in the thirteenth of\nLuther’s theses from the Heidelberg Disputation (1518)\nand further underlined in Luther’s response to the bull of Leo X\n (1520).[6]\n Erasmus replied to the latter in his A Diatribe or Discussion on\nFree Will (De libero arbitrio diatribe sive\ncollatio)—where “diatribe” here is used not in\nthe modern sense, but in the earlier sense of looking for a consensus\non probable opinion through discussion. Luther, however, responded a\nyear later to Erasmus’s intentionally measured and urbane effort with what\namounts to a diatribe in the modern form, entitled De servo\narbitrio, which may be translated “On the bondage [or\nslavery] of the will [or free choice]”. Luther’s invective\nshocked and offended Erasmus, who replied with his two volume\nProtector of the Diatribe (Hyperaspistes\n diatribae)[7]\n in 1526 and 1527, in which Erasmus’s language is almost as\nintemperate as Luther’s own. As Luther emphasised, at the heart\nof this dispute lay issues that were central to his thinking,\nconcerning grace, human agency, and divine knowledge and power, played\nout against the background of Augustine’s earlier disputes with\nPelagianism, of which Luther insistently accused Erasmus, much to the\nlatter’s frustration. \nLuther was also drawn into controversy of a more political and social\nkind, as he sought to respond to the events known as the\n“Peasants’ War” or “Peasants’\nRevolt” (Bauernkrieg), when in 1525 large areas of\ncentral Europe saw agrarian grievances lead to more general disorder,\npartly fuelled by appeal to reformation ideas, and partly by an appeal\nto scripture which Luther himself had seemed to champion. Luther first\nresponded with relative moderation in his Admonition to\nPeace, in which after criticising both the rulers and the peasants, he urged dialogue between the two parties. But the\non-going violence led him to take sides with the secular authorities,\nas the title of his next work made clear: Against the Thieving,\nMurderous Hordes of Peasants. The vehement tone of this text shocked even Luther’s supporters, and led him to attempt to clarify his position further in An Open Letter on the Harsh Book Against the Peasants, though his basic stance was not much changed, and by then the damage was done. That stance was perhaps\npolitically expedient to ensure continuing support from the princes\nfor his reformation, but it nonetheless continues to raise questions\nregarding the integrity of his political judgement, and more generally\nfor the significance of his social and political thought. In the same\nperiod, Luther sought to instill his form of theology and religious\npractice on the growing reformed communities through his German\nMass (1526) and his catechisms (1529). \nIn 1530, Luther was drawn into a further Diet, this time at Augsburg\nbut, fearing for his safety, Luther himself remained in Coburg, while\nhis position was represented by his gifted younger\nprotégé Philip Melanchthon (1497–1560), who had\nfirst joined Luther in Wittenberg in 1518. The aim of the Diet, to be\nattended by the Emperor Charles V, was to achieve some reconciliation\nbetween the Catholic and reformed positions. Luther forwarded his\nstrongly worded suggestions as to how the latter should be represented\nin his “exhortation”, but Melanchthon opted instead to\npresent a more moderate position to the Diet, in 28 articles later\nknown as the Augsburg Confession. This was part of a process\nthrough which Melanchthon sought to mediate and in some respects\nsoften Luther’s own views, not always to the liking of the\nlatter, though their close relationship remained largely intact. The\nDiet ended in failure and, fearing suppression from imperial forces,\nLuther wrote his Warning to his Dear German People (1531), in\nwhich now he sanctioned armed resistance, arguing that defence of the\ngospel overrode civil obedience. Instead, however, the list of\nLutheran territories continued to grow, forming the League of\nSmalcalden in 1531. It was a Diet of this League held in 1537 which\nLuther was to address with his Smalcald Articles; published\nin 1538, these contain his last word on confessional and doctrinal\nissues. He also argued against a council called by the Pope in The\nCouncils and the Church (1539). While still at Coburg, Luther defended some of his practices on translation against critics in On Translating: An Open Letter (1530), particularly the accusation that in Romans 3:28, in the key phrase “faith alone,” the word “alone” is not in Paul’s text. When back in Wittenberg after the\nDiet of Augsburg, Luther was to lecture on Galatians in 1531, lectures\nwhich were published in 1535 and 1538. \nIn his last years, Luther continued to fight for his legacy, which\nincluded his mock-reluctant acceptance of an edition of his collected\nworks to which he contributed an only partially reliable preface on\nwhich (as we have seen) some colourful but probably fictional stories\nof his life were to draw—though for all that it remains a\nrevealing document. These years are marred by his vitriolic attacks on\nboth Turks (and thus Islam) and Jews, in a marked change of tone from\nhis earlier more considered and appreciative reflections, which had\nincluded That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew\n(1523)—although his positive remarks are based on hopes of Jewish conversion, while many of his comments in his unpublished lectures\non Psalms had been hostile; partly because those hopes did not materialise, by 1538 Luther was writing Against the\nSabbatarians, a polemic which he was to continue to the end of\nhis life in further anti-Jewish\n texts.[8] \nThe end of that life was to come on 18 February 1546, in the town of\nEisleben where he had been born. At the burial ceremony in Wittenberg,\nMelanchthon spoke the eulogy. He noted that while he could not deny\nthe complaint that “Luther displayed too much severity” in\ndealing with his opponents, nonetheless he cited one of those\nopponents in response:  \nBut I answer in the language of Erasmus, “Because of the\nmagnitude of the disorders, God gave this age a violent\nphysician”. (1546 [1834–60: 729–730]; the reference is to Erasmus 1529 [1999: 100]) \nWhilst there is no doubt that Luther saw himself primarily as a\ntheologian, as we have seen his education also involved significant\nphilosophical aspects, whilst he engaged with philosophical issues and\ndebates throughout his career. Nonetheless, he was concerned to\ndemarcate clearly between the two disciplines, which for him also\ninvolved becoming clear about the limitations of reason in relation to\nmatters of faith. In some contexts, this led him to polemicizing\nagainst reason and philosophy (most notoriously in his assertion that\n“reason is the devil’s whore” as it “can do\nnothing else but slander and dishonour what God does and says”\n(Against the Heavenly Prophets, 1525, WA 18:164/LW 40:175));\nbut as many would now argue, it would be wrong to take such remarks in\nisolation and out of context, and to thereby characterise his position\nas “irrationalist” in a broad sense. Rather, it would be\nmore accurate to say that he was keen to keep reason within its proper\nboundaries and under the right tutelage. \nOne text that brings out some of the complexities of Luther’s\nposition on these issues is Disputatio de homine (“The\nDisputation Concerning Man”, 1536). Comprising 40 theses, the\nfirst 9 present the view of human beings and our relation to the world\nproposed by “philosophy or human wisdom”, which is then\ncontrasted with the view taken by theology (see Ebeling 1977, 1982,\n1989; but cf. White 1994: 60–81\nfor criticisms of Ebeling). The position of philosophy is not rejected\nentirely, but shown to be severely truncated in the light of theology.\nAccording to philosophy, a human being is an embodied animal equipped\nwith a reason that relies on sensations or experience; it thus\nconceives of us in merely mortal terms and in relation to the world\naround us. Luther agrees that in this context philosophy is right to\nview reason as  \nthe most important and the highest in rank among all things and, in\ncomparison with other things of this life, the best and something\ndivine,  \nfor in this realm  \nit is the inventor and guide of all the arts, medicine, law, and of\nwhatever wisdom, power, virtue, and glory human beings possess in this\nlife. (1536, WA 39.I:175/LW 34:137)  \nLuther thus also agrees that it is reason that makes the fundamental\ndifference between human beings and animals, by virtue of which we are\ngiven dominion over the latter, so that reason is “a sun and a\nkind of god appointed to administer these things in this life”\n(ibid.). And Luther also asserts that even after the Fall, God did not\ntake away this role for reason, but continued to uphold it, so in this\ncontext it remains a divine gift and a fundamental way in which we fit\ninto God’s creation. Thus, set within a worldly arena, Luther\nhere and\n elsewhere[9]\n is happy to affirm the value and function of reason, and\nphilosophy’s high estimate of its significance. \nHowever, Luther then goes on to argue that precisely because\nphilosophy is confined to reason that operates within empirical\n constraints,[10]\n and is unaided by revelation, faith, and scripture, it cannot hope to\ntell us the whole story about human beings and the world, for which\nthe extra resources available to theology are required, which can\nthereby put all this in relation to God and so define “the whole\nand perfect human being” (1536, WA 39.I: 176/LW 34:138). This\nmeans that theology can not only treat God as fundamental in its\naccount of efficient and of final causes (as creator, and as the\nsource of eternal happiness and salvation respectively), but it also\nsees human beings in the light of the Fall and also of grace and\nsalvation, in a way that reason without theology cannot\nfathom—and if it tries to do so, will distort in a fundamental\nway. \nA contemporary empiricist or naturalistic philosopher might have\nlittle cause to challenge Luther’s assumptions concerning the\nnature of reason, and so accept this demarcation between philosophy\nand theology. However, a more rationalistic philosopher might question\nwhether Luther underestimates the a priori capacities of reason, thus\ngiving reason more of a role within the theological realm when it\ncomes to our knowledge of God. In response, Luther makes several\nrelated claims. First, while he does not reject such a priori\nknowledge altogether (which he takes to be innate), he stresses it is\nseverely limited, partly because it can only bring us a rather general\nknowledge of\n God,[11]\n and partly because it can never lead to the kind of certainty\nregarding God which can be found through faith and taking seriously\nhis promise to us, particularly when it comes to matters of\n salvation.[12]\n Second, he has theological reasons connected not just to the Fall\nitself but also to his conception of the “hiddenness” of\nGod, to question the scope of such rational capacities, so that reason\nknows “that there is a God, but it does not know who or which is\nthe true God” (Lectures on Jonah (1526, WA 19:206/LW\n19:54–55). Third, in attributing these capacities to ourselves,\nthere is the danger of a kind of theological pride which will\ndisastrously distort our proper relation to God. Fourth, to take\nreason to be capable of more than helping us navigate the world is to\nmisunderstand its function in our epistemic economy, an economy which\ncan ultimately be traced back to God’s\n design.[13]\n Finally, and perhaps most importantly, reason must struggle to make\nsense of the sheer gratuitousness of God’s forgiveness of our\nsins, which transcend its sense of justice and fairness, and will as a\nresult lead us to question and doubt that forgiveness, with disastrous\n consequences.[14] \nFor Luther, these limitations of reason can be felt within theology in\nthe kind of puzzlement and perplexity which reason feels when\nconfronted by the scriptures and faith, where such puzzlement combined\nwith an undue estimation of reason can lead to the overthrow of the\nlatter by the former. But viewed from Luther’s perspective, this\nis clearly unwarranted, as within theology this puzzlement is\nprecisely to be expected and even predicted, given the hiddenness of\nGod on the one hand and the effects of the Fall on the other, as well\nas God’s desire to humble\n us.[15]\n Luther is thus happy to revel in the apparently paradoxical nature of\nreligious belief, on some accounts going as far as accepting a\ndoctrine of “double truth”: namely that the same\nproposition might be true in theology and false in philosophy, and\nvice versa. That he held this view may seem supported by\nThesis 4 of the Disputation Concerning the Passage: “The\nWord Was Made Flesh” (John 1:14)’ of 1539, which\nstates:  \nThe Sorbonne, the mother of errors, very badly laid down that the same\nthing is true in philosophy and in theology. (WA 39.2:3/LW 38:239)\n \nHowever, it is more commonly held that in making this claim, Luther\nhas something more moderate in mind, which is suggested by Thesis 1 of\nthis Disputation:  \nAlthough the saying “Every truth is in agreement with every\nother truth” is to be upheld, nevertheless, what is true in one\nfield of learning [professionibus] is not always true in\nother fields of learning. (ibid)  \nThis can be interpreted as holding that realms of truth are diverse,\nin the sense that some truth can only be stated in certain fields but\nnot others, but nonetheless all truths are consonant with one another\n(see Gerrish 1962: 53–4; White 1994: Chapter 3; Dieter 2009; Luy\n2017: 15–16; and\nsee Bianchi 2008 for a history of this issue). \nNonetheless, even this more modest position means that Luther can\nclaim that there are truths in theology that philosophy cannot grasp\nor properly articulate in its own terms, and when it tries to do so,\nwill generate what in philosophy appear to be absurdities or\naporia—such as the doctrine of the Trinity, or of the Eucharist,\nboth of which require different ways of thinking than is available to\nphilosophers, who can aspire to no more than “creaturely\nthought” (The Promotions disputation of Erasmus\nAlberus, 1543, WA 39.2:254/Appendix to Bielfeldt, Mattox, &\nHinlicky 2008: 191–197,\n 194).[16]\n It is in this context that Luther can speak of the language of\ntheology needing to be “new” because it behaves\ndifferently from that of the “old” language of philosophy,\nthough not necessarily from the language of ordinary life, which can\nbe more flexible than that of philosophy in certain respects (cf.\nWhite 1994: 332–48,\nBielfeldt 2002b). Likewise, because the philosopher operates with\nformal systems of syllogistic logic, which do not sufficiently take\ninto account the special nature of the objects of faith, such logics\nwill also break down when dealing with theological\n matters.[17]\n To philosophy, these problems will wrongly suggest that theology is\nnonsensical or is grasping at falsehoods, while instead Luther argues\nit just highlights the limitations of philosophical concepts and\nmethods when dealing with the subject-matter of theology (see White\n1994 for more extensive\ndiscussion of these issues). As Luther puts it in Disputation\nConcerning the Passage: “The Word Was Made Flesh”:\n \nSt. Ambrose has rightly said that the dialecticians have to give way\nwhere the apostolic fishermen are to be trusted. (1539, WA 39.2:4/LW\n38:239) \nHowever, having marked out a hierarchy between philosophy and theology\nin this manner, Luther does not entirely reject a role for reason\nwithin theology, when properly understood, and when thereby\nilluminated by faith so that it becomes “right reason”\n(recta\n ratio).[18]\n Thus, as Gerrish has argued in relation to Luther’s famous\nstatement when asked to recant at the Diet of Worms, that he refused\nto do so unless “convinced by the testimony of Scripture or\nplain reason”, Luther did not mean here to set up reason\nalongside scripture, but rather to accept the evidential\nauthority of rational inferences from it (Gerrish 1962:\n 24–5).[19]\n Likewise, while his doctrine of putting scripture first as the basis\nfor faith (sola scriptura) means he has a correspondingly dim\nview of theological debates carried out at a purely philosophical\nlevel, Luther nonetheless accepts the importance of reason to the\ninterpreter and translator of the scriptural texts such as himself.\nIndeed, part of his grounds for rejecting Erasmus’s humanistic\nappeal to authority and tradition in matters of interpretation lies in\nLuther’s confidence in the capacity of reason to make the Bible\nclear, when properly coupled with faith and the “understanding\nof the heart” (see Grosshans 2017: 15–17). However, Luther\nwas himself to face the challenge of those (such as the Anabaptists\nand the Sacramentarians at the Colloquy of Marburg in 1529) who\ninterpreted scripture in different ways, and for whom conscience\nguided by “right reason” was to counsel different\nresponses to such key passages as “For this is my body”,\nleaving little agreed common ground on which to adjudicate these\ndisputes; some see this situation as ironically generating a kind of\nscepticism which is the very converse of the certainty which Luther\nhimself craved and claimed to make\n possible.[20] \nLuther’s conception of the relation between theology and\nphilosophy, faith and reason, may also be seen to influence his\ncorresponding assessment of mysticism. On the one hand, against the\nperceived rationalism of the scholastics, Luther was clearly attracted\nto the need for inner experience, and spoke of achieving a kind of\nunion with or participation in God, while attaching great merit to\nsome writings in the mystical tradition, particularly the\nTheologia deutsch, a late fourteenth-century work which he\ndiscovered and twice edited, in 1516 and 1518, wrongly attributing it\nto Johann Tauler (c. 1300–1361), though it is influenced by the\nlatter’s ideas. At the same time, Luther also distanced himself\nfrom mystical writers such as Dionysius, whose theology (like that of the so-called “Zwickau Prophets”) he accused of making the mediating role for Christ redundant (cf. 1537, First Disputation Against the Antinomians, WA 39.1:389–91, translated in Sonntag (ed. and trans.), Only the Decalogue is Eternal, 55–57), while it is debatable whether\nLuther’s emphasis on the authority of scripture is compatible\nwith a mystical approach (for further discussion, see Oberman 1992:\n126–54, and Leppin 2017b). \nTo the extent that Luther is critical of philosophy and of reason,\nthis hostility is often directed at Aristotle and the Aristotelian\ntradition in particular; and in general, Luther’s departure from\nAristotle marks one of the most philosophically distinctive and\ninteresting aspects of his thinking. As with Luther’s critique\nof reason, however, some of his more notoriously negative\njudgements—such as his claim in the Disputation Against\nScholastic Theology that “the whole Aristotle is to\ntheology as darkness is to light” (1517, WA 1:226/LW\n31:12)—need to be balanced against other more positive\njudgements, and set in context. Part of that context is the reception\nof Aristotle’s work itself, as it was interpreted in its own\nterms, and also placed against the background of Christian thought\nwithin the scholastic tradition, where it can be a complex matter to\nplace Luther himself into these debates (see Andreatta 1996, White 1996, Dieter 2001\n(discussed in Wicks 2007), Dieter 2017). \nBroadly speaking, there are three levels in Luther’s critical\nengagement with Aristotle and his influence: objections at the\ninstitutional level, at the level of general Christian theology, and\nat the level of Luther’s own theological outlook. \nAt the institutional level, Luther’s concern was over the place\nof Aristotle within the universities, which had been cemented through\nthe decision in 1255 of the faculty of liberal arts in Paris to\ninclude all Aristotle’s known works within the curriculum. This\nis the context of Luther’s assertion, in To the Christian\nNobility of 1520, that in the universities “the blind pagan\nteacher, Aristotle, is of more consequence than Christ”, so that\nthe universities “need a good, thorough reformation” (WA\n6:457/LW 44:200) in order to replace the centrality of\nAristotle’s works with the study of scripture and of the\nChristian faith—and Luther was not alone in having this concern.\nHe thus argues that Aristotle’s Physics,\nMetaphysics, De anima, and Ethics should\nall be removed from the curriculum, while his Logic,\nRhetoric and Poetics should be retained in an\nabridged form without commentary, as aids to speaking and preaching.\nIn this way, Luther clearly hoped, rather than “labouring with\npersistent industry to comprehend only Aristotle”\n(Explanations of the Ninety-Five Theses 1518, WA 1:611/LW\n1:222), students would have time to devote themselves to the more\nworthwhile study of the Bible\n instead.[21] \nLuther’s choice of works to set aside also reveals what he took\nto be theologically problematic about the content of Aristotle’s\nphilosophy at the second level. In commenting on De anima,\nLuther objects that it contradicts Christian teaching on the\nimmortality of the soul. He also says that the Physics is\nfundamentally flawed, elsewhere arguing that this is because Aristotle\nhas no conception of the Biblical account of creation (Lectures on\nGenesis, 1535–1545, WA 42:63/LW 1:84). In both areas,\nAristotle is hampered by his hylomorphism, his view that matter and\nform are interrelated, so that in this respect Luther favours Plato\nover Aristotle. \nMore interesting, however, is the third level of Luther’s\nengagement with Aristotle, where his critique focuses on issues\ncentral to Luther’s own theology. In To the Christian\nNobility, this can be seen in Luther’s response to\nAristotle’s Ethics, which is described as being\n“the worst of all books” as it  \nflatly opposes divine grace and all Christian virtues, and yet it is\nconsidered one of his best works. Away with such books! Keep them away\nfrom Christians. (1520, WA 6:458/LW 44:201)  \nLuther is here contrasting his own account of justification through\nfaith with the idea of justification through works, which he\nassociates with the Aristotelian tradition and traces back to\nAristotle’s Ethics. For here, Luther argued, one can\nfind the idea that virtue is something to be developed through our own\nefforts and instilled in us through habituation, thus making the idea\nof good works central to the idea of moral improvement. While perhaps\nplausible in a secular context, once this idea is transposed into\nunderstanding our relation to God, Luther took it to be disastrous as\nit led to the view both that we could act rightly without God’s\ngrace, and that we could to some extent earn his good judgement by\ndoing so, without seeing this grace as unmerited. This, however, is to\ngenerate a sense of pride in our own abilities which precisely negates\nthe possibility of good action, for reasons we will consider further\nin the next section. Luther thus sets his own view in opposition to\nthe Aristotelian one in the Disputation Against Scholastic\nPhilosophy when he writes that “We do not become righteous\nby doing righteous deeds but, having been made righteous, we do\nrighteous deeds”, so that as a result “Virtually the\nentire Ethics of Aristotle is the worst enemy of grace”\n(1517, WA 1:226/LW 1:12). Luther’s criticisms of Duns Scotus,\nGabriel Biel and William of Ockham on these issues elsewhere in the\nDisputation make clear how he sees them as relating to this\nfundamental Aristotelian error, while his reference to\nAugustine’s anti-Pelagianism in the first two theses equally\nmakes clear the theological mistake that Luther sees in all such\nviews. And while Luther does not mention him explicitly in the\nDisputation, not surprisingly he elsewhere occasionally but\nstrongly criticizes Aquinas for also falling under the baleful\ninfluence of Aristotle on this\n issue.[22] \nIt has also been argued by commentators that this radical critique of\nAristotle from the perspective of his view of justification and grace\nalso results in a departure not only from Aristotle’s ethics of\nthe virtues, but also some fundamental assumptions of Aristotelian\nmetaphysics, and its commitment to the substance/attribute model. This\nchange in outlook is said to arise out of Luther’s conception of\ngrace as unmerited, so that in attributing righteousness to a person,\nthis is extrinsic to them, a matter of God’s verdict and hence\nforensic assessment, and so grounded in his relation to the person\nrather than in the attributes of the person themselves, which from\nanother perspective remain that of the sinner. Viewed in this\nrelational way, the Christian is thus “both justified and\nsinner” (simul iustus et peccator), in a manner that is\nhard to capture on a traditional Aristotelian substance/attribute\n model.[23]\n However, the so-called “Finnish interpretation” of\nLuther, which challenges this purely forensic and relational approach\nto justification, correspondingly makes Luther’s challenge to\ntraditional Aristotelian ontology less radical. On the Finnish\ninterpretation, justification involves actual participation in the\ndivine life, and thus has ontological implications for the justified\n individual.[24] \nLuther also felt dissatisfied with the Aristotelian framework of\nsubstance and accidents, and matter and form, in relation to his\ndistinctive views concerning other aspects of Christian doctrine,\nparticularly concerning the Eucharist, where for example in The\nBabylonian Captivity of the Church, Luther argues strongly that\nthe Aristotelian assumptions which had structured much of the debate\non these matters were wrongly used to support the “babble”\nof transubstantiation rather than his preferred view of real presence\n(1520, WA 6:510–511/LW\n 36:32–4)[25]—though\n he also accuses Aquinas of causing difficulties through his\nmisinterpretation of Aristotle, rather than just blaming Aristotle\nhimself (1520, WA 6:508/LW 36:29). In general, Luther’s approach\nhere is that we should take literally the word of scripture which he\nthinks support his view, rather than fall for using a pre-Christian\nphilosophy which may seem to make the Eucharist more comprehensible,\nbut which really does not, and which anyway is not appropriate goal\nfor what should remain a mystery and a matter of faith. \nThrough Luther’s engagement with Aristotle, it is also\nintriguing to try to locate him in the complex patchwork of disputing\nschools that arose in this late medieval period concerning the proper\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s work, and the challenges it faced.\nOne such challenge was from Ockham’s nominalism or (to use the\nmore contemporary label) “termism”; and Luther was to\npresent himself as belonging to this\n position.[26]\n However, this issue is merely one of a broad spectrum of debates that\nshaped the wider dispute between the so-called via antiqua\nand via moderna, where the latter has links to (but cannot be\nidentified with) nominalist approaches. This has led to a considerable\namount of scholarly discussion and research, which has brought out how\nLuther’s education came through the via moderna, but\nthat he also occupied a position that was independent of any\n school.[27] \nJust as Luther’s distinctive conception of justification and\ngrace plays a crucial role in his debates over the value of Aristotle,\nso similar issues play a crucial role in his discussion of a related\nphilosophical issue, namely the value and nature of freedom, both\nhuman and divine. The central text here is of course The Bondage\nof the Will, in which as we have seen Luther engages with Erasmus\non precisely this issue. \nThe structure of Luther’s response to Erasmus is largely\ndetermined by the structure of Erasmus’s De libero\narbitrio, as it attempts to reply to Erasmus point by point.\nErasmus’s work begins with a preface and introduction, and ends\nwith a brief epilogue, while in between it has three parts: the first\ndealing with scriptural texts that Erasmus takes to support free\nchoice; the second dealing with texts that might seem to oppose it;\nand the third a part which examines Luther’s earlier arguments\nagainst free choice in his response to the papal condemnation of 1520.\nThis text is Luther’s Assertio omnium articulorum\npublished in December of that year, in which (following John Wyclif (1324–1384))\nhe defended and went beyond the claim from the Heidelberg\nDisputation which had been condemned, namely that “Free\nwill, after the Fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what\nit is able to do, it commits a mortal sin” (WA 1:354/LW\n 31:40).[28]\n Correspondingly, Luther’s reply to Erasmus has a brief\nintroduction, and then five main parts: the first two discuss\nErasmus’s preface and introduction; a third part which questions\nErasmus’s use of scriptural passages in support of free choice,\nand a fourth which uses scriptural passages against it; and a fifth\npart which challenges Erasmus’s arguments against the position\nLuther defended in the Assertio, while the final part\nmarshals Luther’s general argument against free choice. \nIn an introduction heavy with irony and sarcasm (which sets the\nrhetorical tone for much of the rest of the book, and which so\noffended the urbane Erasmus), Luther apologies for his delay in\nreplying to Erasmus’s Diatribe, but says that the cause\nwas “neither pressure of work, nor the difficulty of the task,\nnor your great eloquence, nor any fear of you”, but rather\n“sheer disgust, anger, and contempt” at the quality of\nErasmus’s work, and its “evasive and equivocal\nnature”:  \nyou fancy yourself steering more cautiously than Ulysses between\nScylla and Charybdis as you assert nothing while appearing to assert\nsomething. (WA 18:601–2/LW 33:17)  \nNonetheless, Luther declares, he has seen that he really ought to\novercome this aversion and respond to those who have entreated him to\nreply to Erasmus, as in expressing his views he may succeed in winning\nover a reader to the truth and the Spirit that informs Luther’s\nworks, where that reader might even be Erasmus himself. \nIn the first main part, which focuses on Erasmus’s preface,\nLuther begins by picking up on Erasmus’s statement that outside\n“the Holy Scripture…and the decrees of the Church”\n(Erasmus 1524 [1969: 37]), he is cautious in making assertions, and\neven would prefer the attitude of the Sceptics, who suspend judgement\non complex matters such as free will. In response, Luther rises to the\nbait, where on the one hand Erasmus was clearly contrasting his more\nmodest position with Luther’s own Assertio and sense of\nconviction more generally, as well as on the other hand making a point of referring to\nthe authority of the Church alongside scripture. Against Erasmus,\nLuther argues that scepticism is not an appropriate outlook for\nChristians who are called on to assert their faith as trust in God,\nwhile also criticising him for putting any weight on the decrees of\nthe Church, rather than on scripture alone, which Luther insists is\nclear enough in its essentials and what it tells us, even though the\nmind of God himself may be harder to fathom, and it may be difficult\nfor us to make philosophical sense of doctrines such as the Trinity.\nMoreover, Luther criticises Erasmus for his suggestion that it is not\nin fact necessary for the Christian to try to settle matters relating\nto free will, particularly given the dangers that attach to\nspeculating on such questions. In response, Luther argues that this\nissue cannot be avoided and is central, for  \nas long as [Christians] are ignorant of what and how much they can do,\nthey will not know what they should do; and being ignorant of what\nthey should do, they cannot repent if they do wrong; and impenitence\nis an unforgivable sin…[so] if we do not know these things, we shall know nothing at all of things\nChristian, and shall be worse than any heathen. (WA 18:614/LW 33:35) \nLikewise, Luther argues, the question of divine foreknowledge and of\nwhether everything happens necessarily is also an issue which cannot\nbe avoided:  \nFor if you doubt or disdain to know that God foreknows all things, not\ncontingently, but necessarily and immutably, how can you believe his\npromises and place a sure trust and reliance on them?… [T]his\nis the one supreme consolation of Christians in all adversities, to\nknow that God does not lie, but does all things immutably, and that\nhis will can neither be resisted nor changed nor hindered. (WA\n18:619/LW 33:42–3)  \nLuther then goes on to criticise Erasmus’s suggestion that\ndiscussion of these issues should be kept from common ears, for fear\nof leading people astray and causing strife, responding that the Word\nof God is not to be supressed, and anyway tumult is to be expected from a\ndoctrine as radical as Christianity. Luther also challenges\nErasmus’s claim that the Lutheran position on free will, even if\nit were true, if widely broadcast would have deleterious effects on\nthe life of the believer, making them more likely to give up any\nattempts to combat their evil, and to no longer believe in a God who\npunishes them for what they cannot control. For Luther, however, this\nis simply to beg the question, as living a better life and believing\nin God are not things we can bring about in ourselves, but only occur\nthrough God. Moreover, on Luther’s account, it is only by\nrecognizing our impotence in these respects, and being thereby humbled\nregarding what we can do and what we can understand, that we have any\nchance of standing in the right relation to God at all. \nFinally in this part, Luther turns to consider Erasmus’s\ncontention that there is a fundamental paradox in the idea that\n“whatever is done by us is done not by free choice but of sheer\nnecessity” (WA 18:139/LW 33:64; cf. Erasmus 1524 [1969: 41]),\nwhere he makes several key claims that will be developed further in\nwhat follows. First, he argues that this is entailed once we accept\nthat our salvation is the work of God, from which it follows that if\nwe do good it is a result of his agency, while if that agency is not\npresent all we can do is what is bad, so that we lack any power of\nchoice in this matter. However, secondly Luther stresses that this\ndoes not mean we are compelled or forced to act as we do, so that  \nby “necessarily” I do not mean “compulsorily”\n[coacte], but by the necessity of immutability (as they say)\nand not of compulsion,  \nso that  \nwhen a man is without the Spirit of God he does not do evil against\nhis will [nolens], as if he were taken by the scruff of the\nneck and forced to it, like a thief or a robber carried off against\nhis will to punishment, but he does it of his own accord and with a\nready will [libenti voluntate]. (WA 18:634/LW 33:64)  \nThus, though we lack free choice, we do not lack free will, understood\nas a force that leads us to act, a force that grows stronger the more\nit is resisted. At this point, Luther makes his famous use of the\ntraditional simile, that the human will is like a horse that can fall\nunder two riders, Satan or God, who will determine which way it goes,\nbut like a horse it follows either perfectly willingly:  \nIf God rides it, it wills and goes where God wills, as the psalm says:\n“I am become as a beast [before thee] and I am always with\nthee” [Psalms 73:22–23]. If Satan rides it, it wills and\ngoes where Satan will; nor can it choose to run to either of the two\nriders or to seek him out, but the riders themselves contend for the\npossession and control of it. (WA 18:635/LW 33:65–6)  \nLuther further argues that as Erasmus himself allows that free choice\nwithout the grace of God is “entirely ineffective”\n(Erasmus 1524 [1969: 41), he does not really disagree with Luther’s\nposition, as  \nto say that free choice exists, and has indeed some power, but that it\nis only an ineffective power, is what the Sophists call oppositum\nin adjecto [a contradiction in terms]. (WA 18:636/LW 33:66)  \nThe only being with genuine free choice, Luther asserts, is God, and\nit is misleading to apply the term to us, so that it would be best if\nwe did not attach it to human beings at all—or if we must\ncontinue to use it, to do so only in relation “to what is\nbeneath him and not what is above him”, where it makes some\nsense to speak of free choice in a limited sense:  \nThat is to say, a man should know that with regard to his faculties\nand possessions he has the right to use, to do, or to leave undone,\naccording to his own free choice, though even this is controlled by\nthe free choice of God alone, who acts in whatever way he pleases. On\nthe other hand in relation to God, or in matters pertaining to\nsalvation or damnation, a man has no free choice, but is a captive,\nsubject and slave either of the will of God or the will of Satan. (WA\n18:638/LW 33:70) \nIn the second part of his text, Luther turns to Erasmus’s\nintroduction, where Erasmus had questioned Luther’s position on\nthe grounds that few of the saints, Church fathers, and scriptural\nauthorities have adopted a view of this sort. Luther’s response\nis that while these authorities may have said there is free\nchoice, in their actions they have not shown they possess it,\nwhile they also have all conceived of it in rather different ways, so\nit is not clear that there is any consensus here at all—and at\nthe same time, Luther argues that the all-important figure of\nAugustine is on his side, not Erasmus’s as the latter had\nclaimed. Given this confused picture, Luther concludes that as a\nresult, the matter must be settled by appeal to scripture alone, and\nnot by appeal to the authority of previous commentators, or of the\nChurch. Luther thus proceeds to the first main part of Erasmus’s\ntext, in which Erasmus had offered a number of biblical passages that\nhe claimed to support the idea of free choice. \nAt the beginning of Part Three of his own work, before getting on to\nthese passages, Luther begins with an important critique of the\ndefinition of free choice with which Erasmus had started his\ndiscussion:  \nBy free choice in this place we mean a power of the human will by\nwhich a man can apply himself to the things which lead to eternal\nsalvation, or turn away from them. (WA 18:661–2/LW\n33:102–3, citing Erasmus 1524 [1969: 47])  \nLuther raises various objections to Erasmus’s definition (for Erasmus’s replies, see 1529 [1999: 261–91]). First,\nhe points out that as free choice applies to God and angels, Erasmus\nis wrong to define it as applying only to human will. Second, he\nargues it is misleading to apply the term “free” to human\nchoice, as this would wrongly imply that a human being “can do\nand does, in relation to God, whatever it pleases, uninhibited by any\nlaw or any sovereign authority”, which Luther takes for granted\nis not what Erasmus has in mind. The human will clearly cannot simply\ndo as it pleases when it comes to matters of eternal salvation, as if\nit operated in a normative vacuum. Rather, the will is obliged by God\nto act in different ways, so it is only free insofar as it fails to do\nso because it is “vertible” or “mutable”, by\nfailing to do what is required of it by being turned away from the\ngood, which is hardly a form of freedom to be admired, as Augustine\nand others have noted. Thus, while Erasmus’s attempted\ndefinition confuses matters, Luther argues that the question at issue\nis therefore whether human beings have the capacity to actively and\nlegitimately turn their will to follow or not follow what God has made\nit right to do—so Luther says that when he uses “free\nchoice” in what comes next, he will be using it in this way. \nLuther’s third objection is that even when we get clear what we\nare trying to define, Erasmus’s definition is itself unclear,\nparticularly the terms “to apply”, “to the things\nwhich lead” and “to turn away”. The only way to\nunderstand “to apply” and “to turn away”,\nLuther argues, is to think that the will is not merely a power that\ngives rise to action, but at the same time stands between that willing\nand action, as a capacity for deciding how the will is to be\nexercised, as a  \ncapacity or faculty or ability or aptitude for willing, unwilling,\nselecting, neglecting, approving, rejecting, and whatever other\nactions of the will there are. (WA 18:662–3/LW 33:105)  \nHowever, this then means, Luther argues, that on Erasmus’s\naccount, if a human being does “the things which lead” to\neternal salvation, this is not just because they have willed these\nthings, but rather have chosen to act on them through exercising this\ncapacity for choice—which is enough to make him a semi-Pelagian,\nwho believes in this capacity for choice even though he disagrees with\nPelagius himself over our ability to also know unaided the matters of\nsalvation and thus the good concerning which we are said to choose.\nMoreover, Luther argues, this view contradicts what Erasmus himself\nhad said previously, namely that “in those who lack grace”\nthe power of the will is “unable to perform the good”\n(Erasmus 1524 [1969: 49]) and is thus (as Luther puts it)\n“incapacitated without grace” (WA 18:665/LW 33:108), and\nso not able to “apply itself” to such matters at all.\nLuther thus poses a question to Erasmus which he thinks could also be\nposed to the Scholastics (who are labelled as Sophists throughout this\ntext):  \nIf anyone told you that a thing was free which could operate by its\nown power only in one direction (the bad one), while in the other (the\ngood one) it could of course operate, though not by its own power, but\nonly by the help of another—would you be able to keep a straight\nface my friend? (WA 18:665/LW 33:109) \nLuther then turns to consider Erasmus’s treatment of the effect\nof the Fall on the human will, in which Erasmus had distinguished\nthree views on where this left free choice once the Pelagian option is set aside: those that hold human\nbeings can choose to strive towards the good but cannot attain it\nwithout grace (co-operative grace); those who hold that left to\nourselves we only choose to sin, so that grace alone can enable us to\nattain the good; and those who hold there is no free choice at all,\nwhich is thus said to be “an empty” name—where\nErasmus calls this view “the hardest of all”, and is of\ncourse the one put forward by Luther himself (as well as John Wyclif in his early work, who Erasmus associated with\nLuther, an association the latter was happy to \n accept).[29]\n Luther’s\nstrategy in response is to argue that by conceding that human beings\nwithout grace cannot will the good, Erasmus has already ruled out the\nfirst option even though he is clearly attracted by it, while Luther\nargues that the second must collapse into the third, as if free choice\nin humans is always for sin, it always goes in one direction and so is\nnot really choice at all. Luther also makes a diagnostic point, that\nunderlying Erasmus’s confusion here is the idea that while the\nwill cannot will the good unaided, it is not necessarily therefore\ncommitted to willing the bad but still has some choice, as it could\nremain in a “neutral” position between the two; but Luther\nrejects this picture, as once the will has turned away from the good,\nit is willing the bad, rather than being in some “middle”\nor “unqualified” state. \nLuther then returns to the passage from Ecclesiasticus 15:14–17\nwith which Erasmus had prefaced his discussion, to consider how\nErasmus uses it to support his view. Luther first considers the\nopening line, which says that “God… left [man] in the\nhands of his own counsel”, which might suggest that we are left\nfree to choose; but Luther counters that this only means we are given\ndominion over the rest of the creatures on earth, while beyond this we\nremain bound by the commandments of God which are referred to in the\nnext line of the biblical text. However, Luther then considers one of\nErasmus’s key arguments, namely that talk of such commandments\nhere and in many other passages also implies we have free choice, for\notherwise they would make no sense, and nor would the punishment\nattached to failing to act on them be warranted, thus raising the\nproblem for Luther of “ought implies can”, and of\nimputation (cf. Erasmus 1524 [1969: 50]). \nIn response to the first issue of “ought implies can”,\nLuther uses this as an occasion to bring out the folly of reason when\nit considers such matters, because reason thinks it can appeal to our\nordinary use of words like “ought” and “must”\nto infer “can”—but Luther thinks that in fact even\nin ordinary practice, we can intelligibly tell someone they ought or\nmust do something, knowing full well they cannot, as when a parent\ndoes so in order to demonstrate to a child the limitations of their\nability, or a doctor in order to demonstrate such limitations to their\npatient. Luther argues that Scripture, unlike Erasmus, takes our human\nlimitations very seriously, so it is therefore not surprising that\nsuch uses of command language abound, where Luther deals with many\nsimilar passages in the same way:  \nThe words of the law are spoken, therefore, not to affirm the power of\nthe will, but to enlighten blind reason and make it see that its own\nlight is no light and that the virtue of the will is no virtue,  \nand he cites Paul as being on his side:  \n“Through the law”, says Paul, “comes knowledge of\nsin” [Romans 3:20]; he does not say the “abolition”\nor “avoidance” of sin. (WA 18:677/LW 33:127)  \nIn response to Erasmus on this issue, Luther thus offers what has been\ncalled his “convicting” view of the law, which is designed\nto reveal our impotence to us, thus provoking the kind of despair and\nsense of helplessness that can open us up to grace, in accordance with\nthe “theology of the cross”—a process Erasmus would\nforestall if we took him seriously, and inferred instead that because\nwe fall under the law, we can take steps to follow it through our own\nchoice (cf. WA 18:680–1/LW 33:133). \nLuther also deals with the problem of imputation and divine\npunishment, which seems to arise if we lack free choice: for how can\nour sins be imputed to us, and how can God allow us to be punished\nwhen we cannot do otherwise and he could remove the defect in our will\nwhich means we are not saved but are punished? Here Luther appeals to\nthe inscrutability of God’s plans and purposes, into which we\nare not entitled to probe:  \n[W]hy that majesty of his does not remove or change this defect of our\nwill in all men, since it is not in man’s power to do so, or why\nhe imputes this defect to man, when man cannot help having it, we have\nno right to inquire; and though you may do a lot of inquiring, you\nwill never find out. It is as Paul says in Romans 11 [sic; the\ncorrect reference is 9:20]: “Who are you, to answer back to\nGod?” (WA 18:686/LW 33:140)  \nLikewise, Luther goes on to argue that when it comes to rewards, these\nare similarly unearned, where to think otherwise will only lead to a\nkind of works righteousness. \nFinally, in the concluding discussion of this third part of his text,\nLuther repeats a claim he has made at several previous points: namely,\nthat if Erasmus’s arguments prove anything, they prove too much,\nby establishing the full-blown Pelagianism Erasmus thinks he can\navoid. For, if the arguments from “ought implies can” and\nfrom imputation are taken seriously at all, then they would establish\nthat we are not merely free to the limited degree Erasmus claims, but\nare fully free to do the good, so that “if anything is proved,\ncomplete freedom of choice is proved with it”—but this is\n“a complete subversion” of what Erasmus wanted to show, as\nhe tried instead to argue for the more moderate view that “such\na free choice can do nothing good and is in bondage to sin” (WA\n18:696/LW 33:156). Luther claims, therefore, that Erasmus’s\nposition undermines itself. \nIn the fourth part, Luther now considers Erasmus’s arguments\nchallenging those scriptural passages which seem to count against free\nchoice, such as Exodus 9:12: “The Lord hardened the heart of\nPharaoh”. Luther criticises not only Erasmus’s various\ninterpretative suggestions, but also his motives in offering them,\nwhich is to try to make God’s actions morally comprehensible to\nour reason, rather than simply accepting the goodness of God (WA\n18:707–8/LW 33:173–4). He goes on to suggest that for our\nreason to ask for more than this, and to insist that God is\nconstrained by certain moral norms, is to violate God’s\nomnipotence, thus leading Luther to take clear sides on the so-called\nEuthyphro dilemma, in adopting a form of voluntarism that may be\ntraced back to Duns Scotus and to Ockham:  \nHe is God, and for his will there is no cause or reason that can be\nlaid down as a rule or measure for it, since there is nothing equal or\nsuperior to it, but it is itself the rule of all things. For if there\nwere any rule or standard for it, either as cause or reason, it could\nno longer be the will of God. For it is not because he is or was\nobliged so to will that what he wills is right, but on the contrary,\nbecause he himself so wills, therefore what happens must be right.\nCause and reason can be assigned for a creature’s will, but not\nfor the will of the Creator, unless you set up over him another\ncreator. (WA 18:712/LW 33:181) \nLuther then follows Erasmus’s discussion, in turning from this\ntext to Paul’s discussion of it in Romans 9:15–18, which\nraises the issue of divine foreknowledge, and how that relates to free\nchoice in human beings. In considering this issue, Erasmus had made\nuse of the scholastic distinction between the necessity of the\nconsequence and the necessity of the consequent, arguing that while it\nmay be that if God wills something it happens necessarily (necessity\nof the consequence), it does not follow that this happening is\nnecessary (necessity of the consequent), thus leaving space for free\nchoice (Erasmus 1524 [1969: 66–8]). In response, Luther argues\nthat divine foreknowledge makes this distinction moot: for if we allow\nthis foreknowledge, then what God knows must happen necessarily\notherwise he could not know it infallibly in advance; and if God did\nnot have this knowledge,  \nyou take away faith and fear of God, make havoc of all the divine\npromises and threatenings, and thus deny his very divinity. (WA\n18:715/LW 33:186)  \nLuther thus rejects Erasmus’s attempt to leave any space for\nfree choice, given divine foreknowledge (for Erasmus’s response, see Erasmus 1527 [1999: 493–520]):  \nIf God foreknows that Judas will turn traitor, or that he will change\nhis will to betray, whichever God has foreknown will necessarily come\nabout, or else God will be mistaken in his foreknowing and predicting,\nwhich is impossible. (WA 18:722/LW 33:194–5) \nAfter the discussion of some other relevant scriptural passages,\nLuther returns to consider Erasmus’s motives in resisting what\nLuther takes to be the plain meaning of these texts in his conclusion\nof this fourth part—which is that Erasmus wishes to constrain\nGod within the bounds of what is comprehensible to human reason, and\nso refuses to let God be God. In response, Luther writes: \nHuman nature [caro] does not think fit to give God such glory\nas to believe him just and good when he speaks and acts above and\nbeyond what the Code of Justinian has laid down, or the fifth book of\nAristotle’s Ethics. The Majesty that is the creator of\nall must bow down to one of the dregs of his creation, and the famed\nCorycian cavern must reverse its role and stand in awe of the\nspectators!… [W]hat becomes of the potter’s power to make\nwhat he likes, if he is subjected to merits and laws and not allowed\nto make what he likes, but required to make what he ought? (WA\n18:729–30/LW 33:206–7) \nFurthermore, Luther argues, if we did try to hold God to human norms\nof justice, we should be as critical of divine grace and forgiveness,\nwhich also violates these norms—or if it does not, and God\nrewards only those who deserve it, then in the case of someone who\nreceives this reward in full, their goodness must be wholly due to\ntheir will, thus denying a role for grace at all (WA 33:733/LW\n33:211). Luther argues once again, therefore, that Erasmus’s\nargument overshoots and so undermines itself. \nIn the fifth part of his text, Luther moves on to discussing\nErasmus’s arguments over the scriptural passages which Luther\nhad used to challenge free choice in his Assertio. In\nresponse and in defending his own interpretation of those passages,\nLuther makes a number of similar points to those used in previous\nparts, such as: Erasmus ignores the convicting sense of the law (WA\n18:736/LW 33:216); he confuses lack of free choice with coercion (WA\n18:747/LW 33:233); he treats free choice as if it could occupy\nnormatively neutral ground (WA 18:750/LW 33:237); and his argument\novershoots, so that if followed consistently it results in Pelagianism\n(WA 18:755/LW 33:245). Likewise, in the sixth part, when offering\nfurther passages against free choice, Luther again reiterates his\nearlier arguments, particularly that works in accordance with the law\ndo not justify (WA 18:764/LW 33:258); that the role of the law is to\nbring knowledge of sin (WA 18:766/LW 33:261); that Erasmus’s\nposition is an unstable form of semi-Pelagianism (WA\n18:769–70/LW 33:267–8); that divine foreknowledge and\npredestination leave no room for free choice (WA 18:772–3/LW\n33:272); that free choice is not in a neutral space between good and\nevil (WA 18:779/LW 33:281–2); and that our dominion over\ncreation does not entail that we have free choice in relation to God\n(WA 18:281/LW 33:284–5). In the concluding pages, Luther makes\nvividly clear the underlying spiritual concerns which motivate his\nposition: namely that for salvation to be dependent on the properly\nused free choice of the believer is to leave the believer in the sort\nof uncertainty regarding salvation which had plagued Luther’s\nown earlier spiritual life, and which he was now thankful to have\nescaped, once he saw that “God has taken my salvation out of my\nhands into his, making it dependent on his choice and not mine”\n(WA 18:783/LW 33:289). Moreover, he adds the Christological argument:\nif human beings had the capacity to save themselves through their\nchoices, Christ would have died in vain. \nLuther’s rethinking of these issues of grace and salvation were\nnot seen by him as merely concerning the individual’s relation\nto God, but also to have wider ethical and social implications\nconcerning the relation of individuals to one another, and of\nindividuals to the community to which they belong. It is thus clear\nthroughout his writings that Luther saw his transition from\n“justification through works” to “justification\nthrough faith” as having a major impact on his conception of\nethics and social philosophy. \nAt the centre of Christian ethics is the commandment to love\none’s neighbour; but Luther thinks this is only properly\nunderstood and made possible on his account of our relation to God,\nfor a variety of reasons. First, if justification it to be earned\nthrough works, our justification remains uncertain in a way that fuels\nthe kind of introspective anxiety that makes it impossible to love the\nneighbour, by instead turning us in on\n ourselves.[30]\n Second, these works become instrumental in earning our own salvation,\nthus no longer involving genuine concern for our neighbour but only\nfor our own\n well-being.[31]\n Third, the works that will be our primary focus are religious works\nsuch as penance, and thus not ethical ones that concern the\n neighbour.[32]\n Fourth, if we think we can achieve good works without a prior act of\ngrace, this will fuel a pride and sense of self-cultivated\nvirtuousness which will cause us to look down on the neighbour rather\nthan love them, a difficulty that leads Luther to be critical of the\nkind of virtue ethics associated with the Aristotelian\n tradition.[33]\n Thus, by starting with justification through works we will be unable\nto truly love the neighbour, for as we have seen, this love will be\nblocked by a mixture of anxiety about our own salvation and pride at\nour own achievements, so finally the most we will be able manage in\nrelation to the neighbour is a kind of dutiful obedience of the\ncommandment as a law, which itself gets in the way of a genuine\nattitude of love. \nBy contrast, Luther argues, once we move from justification through\nworks to justification through faith, love of the neighbour becomes\npossible as these obstacles are removed. Instead of feeling both\nanxious and prideful, the believer is released from this anxiety\nthrough the promise of a grace that does not have to be earned, and\nfrom their pride by realising that this grace is unmerited. This frees\nthe individual from their self-absorption which had turned them in on\nthemselves, and enables them to face outwards towards the neighbour,\nwho they no longer view as an instrument to their own salvation. In\nexperiencing God’s love of us through grace, and of\nChrist’s giving of himself for us, we then turn to express this\nlove not only to God, but also to pass on this gift to the neighbour,\nthereby doing the good works we ought to do in a spontaneous way\nrather than feeling compelled to act in an imperatival\n manner.[34]\n This shift in perspective is captured by Luther’s famously\ndialectical claim in The Freedom of the Christian: “A\nChristian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none”, in\nso far as the Christian is freed from following the law in an\ninstrumental manner and out of fear for its penalties; on the other\nhand “A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject\nto all” (WA 7:21 (German), 7:49 (Latin)/LW 31:344), as the\nChristian feels a gratitude to God and to Christ that also opens them\nup to their neighbour, who they serve in\n love.[35]\n Luther thus insists that works still play a fundamental role in the\nChristian life, but a role that takes a different and healthier\nform. \nLikewise, as Luther made particularly clear towards the end of his life in his dispute with Johann\nAgricola (1494–1566) in his open letter Against the Antinomians (1539) and associated Disputations (1537–40), whilst the\nfreedom of the Christian means that they are freed from a kind of\nsubjection to the law and fulfilling it plays no role in\ntheir salvation, this does not mean that they are somehow outside or\nbeyond the law, and nor does this mean that the preaching of the law\nshould play no part in the life of the Church. As regards the latter\npoint, we have already seen that consciousness of law can play an\nimportant “convicting” role in leading to the kind of\ndespair that opens us up to grace. And as regards the former point,\nwhile the Christian qua Christian will not feel the law as a\nconstraint or as a vehicle for salvation, this does not mean that the\nlaw does not apply to them. Luther also presents himself as\noccupying a similar middle position when it comes to ceremonial laws\n(cf. The Freedom of the Christian WA 7:70–3/LW\n 31:375–77).[36] \nMoreover, Luther’s theological anthropology of course recognizes\nthat we are not just Christian, but also have to deal with\nthe “outer man” or “fallen man” who still\nrequires control, so that the Christian who is also human will find it\nhard not to see the law as something before which they are required to\nsubmit, though they will do so willingly. Likewise and more generally,\nthe Christian lives in a society in which not all are good, so that\nlaws are required in order to constrain the behaviour of the\nwicked—which alongside its “convicting” use, is the\nother function of the law in Luther’s\n account.[37]\n Such laws will require authority in those who institute and enforce\nthem, an authority grounded in the important role that these public\nbodies play in enabling fallen human beings to live together, and thus\nin fulfilling God’s purposes for the world. \nIn recognizing how far law and the legitimacy of public authorities\nand social structures rest on the role of both in furthering the ends\nof God’s creation, there is an important connection between\nLuther’s ethics and social philosophy and the theistic natural\nlaw tradition. Moreover, Luther forms part of this tradition in\nfrequently arguing on the basis of Paul’s statement in Romans\n2:15, that this natural law “is written in the depth of the\nheart and cannot be erased” (Against the Antinomians WA\n50:471/LW 47:110), so that human beings are naturally born with a\nknowledge of fundamental moral precepts, which are accessible to us\nthrough reason and felt through conscience. However, the Fall has\nimpacted on this knowledge, which is why there can also be a place for\na law that is revealed to us, as Moses did to the people of Israel,\nand preached on that basis, though in doing so what is revealed does\nnot provide us with a new law, but reawakens our awareness of the law\nthat is written on our\n hearts.[38]\n Furthermore, while the decalogue is fundamental and\n eternal,[39]\n other aspects of the law of Moses are more context specific and\nrequire further\n elaboration.[40]\n In some discussions, however, Luther distinguishes between the\nnatural law which applies and is known to all and which “even\nthe heathen, Turks, and Jews have to keep if there is to be any peace\nor order in the world”, and “the law of Christ, and of the\ngospel, which is not binding on the heathen”, and which requires\nmore than the former law, such as love of the enemy and the\nwillingness “to give up life and property, and let whoever takes\nit have it”, and thus if necessary to set aside temporal goods\n(Admonition to Peace, 1525, WA 18:307–311/LW\n46:27–29). \nThis distinction reflects a wider distinction in Luther’s ethics\nand social philosophy, between the structures necessary to enable the\nflourishing of fallen human beings as parts of God’s creation,\nand a concern with our spiritual lives to which different\nconsiderations apply. This distinction is reflected in Luther’s\nwell-known but complex and evolving distinction between “two\nkingdoms” [die zwei Reiche] and the related distinction\nbetween “two governments” (or “regiments”)\n[die zwei Regimente]. The worldly or temporal kingdom is\nwhere human beings live within the world, which is structured by God\nto make this possible into three “orders” or\n“hierarchies” or “estates”, which were the\npolitia or civitas, the oeconomia, and the\necclesia, namely government and state, the household and\neconomic human interactions more generally, and the Church. The\nindividual then has an office or calling or station within these\nvarious orders, which because these are divinely ordained are a way\nfor individuals within their station to serve God, and may give some\nindividuals in certain offices authority over others. Within the\nworldly kingdom, therefore, there are also worldly authorities\noperating at the political and social level (including within the\nChurch), who should exercise that authority with a view to enabling\nfallen human beings within God’s creation to live together as\nwell as they can; they therefore do not get that authority from the\nworld, or exercise it on their own behalf, so that in this sense they\nalso fall under divine authority and are subordinated to God’s\nspiritual kingdom, while nonetheless remaining distinguishable from it\nin terms of their primary focus, which is “life and property and\nexternal affairs on earth” (Temporal Authority, 1523,\nWA 11:265–6/LW 45:111–2). By contrast,  \n[t]he spiritual government or authority [Regiment oder Amt]\npointed Christians above itself, towards God, to do right and find\nsalvation. (WA 51:241/LW 13:197)  \nAs this is the kingdom of grace, and God’s grace is present in\nChrist, it is ruled by Christ who brings the gospel and grace to human\nbeings, in conjunction with the Holy Spirit. As a spiritual being who\nis also a citizen of the world, the Christian therefore lives under\nboth governments, as well as a two-fold law, reflected in the\ndistinction between the natural and Christian law outlined\n above.[41] \nThis complex structure obviously raises the question of how these two\naspects of the Christian life can be related, and whether they can\ncome into conflict. Luther’s position here is nuanced, as while\nhe distinguishes between these aspects in the way we have seen, he\ndoes not treat them dualistically as is sometimes suggested, by\nseparating off the this-worldly from the other-worldly, the temporal\nfrom the spiritual, the outer from the inner, or social life from the\nindividual’s relation to God. Rather, in On Temporal\nAuthority, Luther argues that while “no one can become\nrighteous in the sight of God by means of the temporal\ngovernment” (1523, WA 11:252/LW 45:92), and while Christians who\nhave the Holy Spirit in their heart have no need of such a government\nto constrain them (1523, WA 11:249–50/LW 45:88–9),\nnonetheless the Christian who is enabled by God’s love to love\nthe neighbour will thereby be engaged with what this requires of them\nin the world as a result of this neighbour love, including occupying\nits various offices and upholding its laws, which can include if\nnecessary exercising force over\n others.[42]\n The Christian will not adopt these practices for their own good, or\nthink that following them counts as a route to their own salvation;\nbut they will see that these practices can be necessary for the good\nof the neighbour, and that love for the neighbour will therefore\ninvolve not withdrawing from the world into spiritual\nother-worldliness and isolation, but engaging with it. \nHowever, this approach of course gives rise to a further question:\nnamely, under what conditions should the Christian be committed to\nsupporting the secular authorities, particularly when their power is\nmade greater through Luther’s downgrading of the authority of\nthe Church in temporal matters. This issue was made vivid for Luther\nin the context of the Peasants’ Revolt discussed above. On the\none hand, Luther places limits on political obedience, as princes have\nno absolute authority but are merely the “masks” or\nlarvae of God, and so are themselves constrained to act as\nGod ordained, and so for the good of their people and in accordance\nwith God’s word; the people of a prince who does wrong in these\nterms are therefore not required to obey\n him.[43]\n Moreover, such princes are not to compel their citizens on matters of\nfaith, which do not fall under their\n jurisdiction.[44]\n On the other hand, as the individual Christian should ultimately have\nlittle concern for their own temporal interests, if the secular power\nacts against those interests, the Christian will not see this as\ngiving them a right to rebel and overthrow the secular\n power,[45]\n while only God can act as its judge and inflict punishment upon those\nwho\n rule.[46]\n It remains a matter of dispute whether Luther succeeded in striking a\nstable balance here, as on other issues discussed above. \nLuther’s thinking exerted a considerable influence not only on\nhis own time and on his immediate contemporaries, but also on those\nwho have come after him. While his most significant impact has of\ncourse been in theology, and while it would be wrong to suggest that\nthere is anything like a Lutheran school in philosophy, nonetheless\nLuther has played an important role for a range of key philosophical\nfigures from Hobbes and Leibniz, to Heidegger. This impact is\nconsidered in more detail in a separate entry, as well as his\ninfluence on “modernity” more broadly.","contact.mail":"r.stern@sheffield.ac.uk","contact.domain":"sheffield.ac.uk"}]
