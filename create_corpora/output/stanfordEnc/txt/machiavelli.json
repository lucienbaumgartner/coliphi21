That question might naturally and legitimately occur\nto anyone encountering an entry about him in an encyclopedia of\nphilosophy. Certainly, Machiavelli contributed to a large number of\nimportant discourses in Western thought—political theory most\nnotably, but also history and historiography, Italian literature, the\nprinciples of warfare, and diplomacy. But Machiavelli never seems to\nhave considered himself a philosopher—indeed, he often overtly\nrejected philosophical inquiry as beside the point—nor do his\ncredentials suggest that he fits comfortably into standard models of\nacademic philosophy. His writings are maddeningly and notoriously\nunsystematic, inconsistent and sometimes self-contradictory. He tends\nto appeal to experience and example in the place of rigorous logical\nanalysis. Yet there are good reasons to include Machiavelli among the\ngreatest of political philosophers, some of which are internal to his\nwritings. In spite of the temptation to emphasize his political\npragmatism, a lively scholarly debate rages about the presence of a\ncoherent and original philosophy, addressed to topics of concern to\nphilosophers, at the core of his thought (Benner 2009; Zuckert 2017,\n2018; Baluch 2018).\n\n\nMoreover, succeeding thinkers who more obviously qualify as\nphilosophers of the first rank did (and still do) feel compelled to\nengage with his ideas, either to dispute them or to incorporate his\ninsights into their own teachings. Even if Machiavelli grazed at the\nfringes of philosophy, the impact of his extensive musings has been\nwidespread and lasting. The terms “Machiavellian” or\n“Machiavellism” find regular purchase among philosophers\nconcerned with a range of ethical, political, and psychological\nphenomena, regardless of whether or not Machiavelli himself invented\n“Machiavellism” or was in fact a\n“Machiavellian” in the sense commonly ascribed to him.\nMachiavelli's critique of utopian philosophical schemes (such as those\nof Plato) challenges an entire tradition of political philosophy in a\nmanner that that commands attention and demands consideration and\nresponse. Finally, a new generation of so-called\n“neo-Roman” political theorists (such as Philip Pettit\n[1997], Quentin Skinner [1998] and Maurizio Viroli [1999 [2002]])\nfinds inspiration in Machiavelli’s version of republicanism.\nThus, Machiavelli deserves a place at the table in any comprehensive\nsurvey of political philosophy.\n\n\nRelatively little is known for certain about Machiavelli's early life\nin comparison with many important figures of the Italian Renaissance\n(the following section draws on Capponi 2010; Vivanti 2013; Celenza\n2015) He was born 3 May 1469 in Florence and at a young age became a\npupil of a renowned Latin teacher, Paolo da Ronciglione. It is\nspeculated that he attended the University of Florence, and even a\ncursory glance at his corpus reveals that he received an excellent\nhumanist education. It is only with his entrance into public view,\nwith his appointment in 1498 as the Second Chancellor of the Republic\nof Florence, however, that we begin to acquire a full and accurate\npicture of his life. For the next fourteen years, Machiavelli engaged\nin a flurry of diplomatic activity on behalf of Florence, traveling to\nthe major centers of Italy as well as to the royal court of France and\nto the imperial curia of Maximilian. A large body of extant letters,\ndispatches, and occasional writings testify to his political\nassignments as well as to his acute talent for the analysis of\npersonalities and institutions. \nFlorence had been under a republican government since 1494, when the\nleading Medici family and its supporters had been driven from power.\nDuring this time, Machiavelli thrived under the patronage of the\nFlorentine gonfaloniere (or chief administrator for life)\nPiero Soderini. In 1512, however, with the assistance of papal troops,\nthe Medici defeated the republic's armed forces and dissolved the\ngovernment. Machiavelli was a direct victim of the regime change: he\nwas initially placed in a form of internal exile and, when he was\n(wrongly) suspected of conspiring against the Medici in 1513, he was\nimprisoned and tortured for several weeks. His retirement thereafter\nto his farm outside of Florence afforded the occasion and the impetus\nfor him to turn to literary pursuits. \nThe first of his writings in a more reflective vein was also\nultimately the one most commonly associated with his name, The\nPrince. Written at the end of 1513 (and perhaps early 1514), but\nonly formally published posthumously in 1532, The Prince was\ncomposed in great haste by an author who was, among other things,\nseeking to regain his status in Florentine political affairs. (Many of\nhis colleagues in the republican government were quickly rehabilitated\nand returned to service under the Medici.) Originally written for\npresentation to Giuliano de'Medici (who may well have appreciated it),\nthe dedication was changed, upon Giuliano's death, to Lorenzo\nde'Medici, who almost certainly did not read it when it came into his\nhands in 1516. \nMeanwhile, Machiavelli's enforced retirement led him to other literary\nactivities. He wrote verse, plays, and short prose, penned a study of\nThe Art of War (published in 1521), and produced biographical\nand historical sketches. Most importantly, he composed his other major\ncontribution to political thought, the Discourses on the Ten Books\nof Titus Livy, an exposition of the principles of republican rule\nmasquerading as a commentary on the work of the famous historian of\nthe Roman Republic. Unlike The Prince, the\nDiscourses was authored over a long period of time\n(commencing perhaps in 1514 or 1515 and completed in 1518 or 1519,\nalthough again only published posthumously in 1531). The book may have\nbeen shaped by informal discussions attended by Machiavelli among some\nof the leading Florentine intellectual and political figures under the\nsponsorship of Cosimo Rucellai. \nNear the end of his life, and probably as a result of the aid of\nwell-connected friends whom he never stopped badgering for\nintervention, Machiavelli began to return to the favor of the Medici\nfamily. In 1520, he was commissioned by Cardinal Giulio de'Medici to\ncompose a History of Florence, an assignment completed in\n1525 and presented to the Cardinal, who had since ascended to the\npapal throne as Clement VII, in Rome. Other small tasks were\nforthcoming from the Medici government, but before he could achieve a\nfull rehabilitation, he died on 21 June 1527. \nIt has been a common view among political philosophers that there\nexists a special relationship between moral goodness and legitimate\nauthority. Many authors (especially those who composed\nmirror-of-princes books or royal advice books during the Middle Ages\nand Renaissance) believed that the use of political power was only\nrightful if it was exercised by a ruler whose personal moral character\nwas strictly virtuous. Thus rulers were counseled that if they wanted\nto succeed—that is, if they desired a long and peaceful reign\nand aimed to pass their office down to their offspring—they must\nbe sure to behave in accordance with conventional standards of ethical\ngoodness. In a sense, it was thought that rulers did well when they\ndid good; they earned the right to be obeyed and respected inasmuch as\nthey showed themselves to be virtuous and morally upright (see Briggs\nand Nederman forthcoming). \nMachiavelli criticizes at length precisely this moralistic view of\nauthority in his best-known treatise, The Prince. For\nMachiavelli, there is no moral basis on which to judge the difference\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate uses of power. Rather, authority\nand power are essentially coequal: whoever has power has the right to\ncommand; but goodness does not ensure power and the good person has no\nmore authority by virtue of being good. Thus, in direct opposition to\na moralistic theory of politics, Machiavelli says that the only real\nconcern of the political ruler is the acquisition and maintenance of\npower (although he talks less about power per se than about\n“maintaining the state”.) In this sense, Machiavelli\npresents a trenchant criticism of the concept of authority by arguing\nthat the notion of legitimate rights of rulership adds nothing to the\nactual possession of power. The Prince purports to reflect\nthe self-conscious political realism of an author who is fully\naware—on the basis of direct experience with the Florentine\ngovernment—that goodness and right are not sufficient to win and\nmaintain political office. Machiavelli thus seeks to learn and teach\nthe rules of political power. For Machiavelli, power\ncharacteristically defines political activity, and hence it is\nnecessary for any successful ruler to know how power is to be used.\nOnly by means of the proper application of power, Machiavelli\nbelieves, can individuals be brought to obey and will the ruler be\nable to maintain the state in safety and security. \nMachiavelli's political theory, then, represents a concerted effort to\nexclude issues of authority and legitimacy from consideration in the\ndiscussion of political decision-making and political judgment.\nNowhere does this come out more clearly than in his treatment of the\nrelationship between law and force. Machiavelli acknowledges that good\nlaws and good arms constitute the dual foundations of a well-ordered\npolitical system. But he immediately adds that since coercion creates\nlegality, he will concentrate his attention on force. He says,\n“Since there cannot be good laws without good arms, I will not\nconsider laws but speak of arms” (Prince CW 47). In\nother words, the legitimacy of law rests entirely upon the threat of\ncoercive force; authority is impossible for Machiavelli as a right\napart from the power to enforce it. Consequently, Machiavelli is led\nto conclude that fear is always preferable to affection in subjects,\njust as violence and deception are superior to legality in effectively\ncontrolling them. Machiavelli observes that  \none can say this in general of men: they are ungrateful, disloyal,\ninsincere and deceitful, timid of danger and avid of profit….\nLove is a bond of obligation which these miserable creatures break\nwhenever it suits them to do so; but fear holds them fast by a dread\nof punishment that never passes. (Prince CW 62; translation\nrevised)  \nAs a result, Machiavelli cannot really be said to have a theory of\nobligation separate from the imposition of power; people obey only\nbecause they fear the consequences of not doing so, whether the loss\nof life or of privileges. And of course, power alone cannot obligate\none, inasmuch as obligation assumes that one cannot meaningfully do\notherwise. \nConcomitantly, a Machiavellian perspective directly attacks the notion\nof any grounding for authority independent of the sheer possession of\npower. For Machiavelli, people are compelled to obey purely in\ndeference to the superior power of the state. If I think that I should\nnot obey a particular law, what eventually leads me to submit to that\nlaw will be either a fear of the power of the state or the actual\nexercise of that power. It is power which in the final instance is\nnecessary for the enforcement of conflicting views of what I ought to\ndo; I can only choose not to obey if I possess the power to resist the\ndemands of the state or if I am willing to accept the consequences of\nthe state's superiority of coercive force. Machiavelli's argument in\nThe Prince is designed to demonstrate that politics can only\ncoherently be defined in terms of the supremacy of coercive power;\nauthority as a right to command has no independent status. He\nsubstantiates this assertion by reference to the observable realities\nof political affairs and public life as well as by arguments revealing\nthe self-interested nature of all human conduct. For Machiavelli it is\nmeaningless and futile to speak of any claim to authority and the\nright to command which is detached from the possession of superior\npolitical power. The ruler who lives by his rights alone will surely\nwither and die by those same rights, because in the rough-and-tumble\nof political conflict those who prefer power to authority are more\nlikely to succeed. Without exception the authority of states and their\nlaws will never be acknowledged when they are not supported by a show\nof power which renders obedience inescapable. The methods for\nachieving obedience are varied, and depend heavily upon the foresight\nthat the prince exercises. Hence, the successful ruler needs special\ntraining. \nMachiavelli presents to his readers a vision of political rule\nallegedly purged of extraneous moralizing influences and fully aware\nof the foundations of politics in the effective exercise of power. The\nterm that best captures Machiavelli's vision of the requirements of\npower politics is virtù. While the Italian word would\nnormally be translated into English as “virtue”, and would\nordinarily convey the conventional connotation of moral goodness,\nMachiavelli obviously means something very different when he refers to\nthe virtù of the prince. In particular, Machiavelli\nemploys the concept of virtù to refer to the range of\npersonal qualities that the prince will find it necessary to acquire\nin order to “maintain his state” and to “achieve\ngreat things”, the two standard markers of power for him. This\nmakes it brutally clear there can be no equivalence between the\nconventional virtues and Machiavellian virtù.\nMachiavelli's sense of what it is to be a person of\nvirtù can thus be summarized by his recommendation\nthat the prince above all else must possess a “flexible\ndisposition”. That ruler is best suited for office, on\nMachiavelli's account, who is capable of varying her/his conduct from\ngood to evil and back again “as fortune and circumstances\ndictate” (Prince CW 66; see Nederman and Bogiaris\n2018). \nNot coincidentally, Machiavelli also uses the term\nvirtù in his book The Art of War in order to\ndescribe the strategic prowess of the general who adapts to different\nbattlefield conditions as the situation dictates. Machiavelli sees\npolitics to be a sort of a battlefield on a different scale. Hence,\nthe prince just like the general needs to be in possession of\nvirtù, that is, to know which strategies and\ntechniques are appropriate to what particular circumstances (Wood\n1967). Thus, virtù winds up being closely connected to\nMachiavelli's notion of the power. The ruler of virtù\nis bound to be competent in the application of power; to possess\nvirtù is indeed to have mastered all the rules\nconnected with the effective application of power.\nVirtù is to power politics what conventional virtue is\nto those thinkers who suppose that moral goodness is sufficient to be\na legitimate ruler: it is the touchstone of political success. \nWhat is the conceptual link between virtù and the\neffective exercise of power for Machiavelli? The answer lies with\nanother central Machiavellian concept, Fortuna (usually\ntranslated as “fortune”). Fortuna is the enemy of\npolitical order, the ultimate threat to the safety and security of the\nstate. Machiavelli's use of the concept has been widely debated\nwithout a very satisfactory resolution. Suffice it to say that, as\nwith virtù, Fortuna is employed by him in a\ndistinctive way. Where conventional representations treated\nFortuna as a mostly benign, if fickle, goddess, who is the\nsource of human goods as well as evils, Machiavelli's fortune is a\nmalevolent and uncompromising fount of human misery, affliction, and\ndisaster. While human Fortuna may be responsible for such\nsuccess as human beings achieve, no man can act effectively when\ndirectly opposed by the goddess (Discourses CW\n407–408). \nMachiavelli's most famous discussion of Fortuna occurs in\nChapter 25 of The Prince, in which he proposes two analogies\nfor understanding the human situation in the face of events.\nInitially, he asserts that fortune resembles  \none of our destructive rivers which, when it is angry, turns the\nplains into lakes, throws down the trees and buildings, takes earth\nfrom one spot, puts it in another; everyone flees before the flood;\neveryone yields to its fury and nowhere can repel it.  \nYet the furor of a raging river does not mean that its depredations\nare beyond human control: before the rains come, it is possible to\ntake precautions to divert the worst consequences of the natural\nelements. “The same things happen about Fortuna”,\nMachiavelli observes,  \nShe shows her power where virtù and wisdom do not\nprepare to resist her, and directs her fury where she knows that no\ndykes or embankments are ready to hold her. (Prince CW 90)\n \nFortune may be resisted by human beings, but only in those\ncircumstances where “virtù and wisdom”\nhave already prepared for her inevitable arrival. \nMachiavelli reinforces the association of Fortuna with the\nblind strength of nature by explaining that political success depends\nupon appreciation of the operational principles of Fortuna.\nHis own experience has taught him that  \nit is better to be impetuous than cautious, because Fortuna\nis a woman and it is necessary, in order to keep her under, to beat\nand maul her.  \nIn other words, Fortuna demands a violent response of those\nwho would control her. “She more often lets herself be overcome\nby men using such methods than by those who proceed coldly”,\nMachiavelli continues, “therefore always, like a woman, she is\nthe friend of young men, because they are less cautious, more\nspirited, and with more boldness master her” (Prince CW\n92). The wanton behavior of Fortuna demands an aggressive,\neven violent response, lest she take advantage of those men who are\ntoo retiring or “effeminate” to dominate her. \nMachiavelli's remarks point toward several salient conclusions about\nFortuna and her place in his intellectual universe.\nThroughout his corpus, Fortuna is depicted as a primal source\nof violence (especially as directed against humanity) and as\nantithetical to reason. Thus, Machiavelli realizes that only\npreparation to pose an extreme response to the vicissitudes of\nFortuna will ensure victory against her. This is what\nvirtù provides: the ability to respond to fortune at\nany time and in any way that is necessary. \nThese basic building blocks of Machiavelli's thought have induced\nconsiderable controversy among his readers going back to the sixteenth\ncentury, when he was denounced as an apostle of the Devil, but also\nwas read and applied sympathetically by authors (and politicians)\nenunciating the doctrine of “reason of state” (Meinecke\n1924 [1957]). The main source of dispute concerned Machiavelli's\nattitude toward conventional moral and religious standards of human\nconduct, mainly in connection with The Prince. For many, his\nteaching endorses immoralism or, at least, amoralism. The most extreme\nversions of this reading find Machiavelli to be a “teacher of\nevil”, in the famous words of Leo Strauss (1958: 9–10), on\nthe grounds that he counsels leaders to avoid the common values of\njustice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and love of their people in\npreference to the use of cruelty, violence, fear, and deception. A\nmore moderate school of thought, associated with the name of Benedetto\nCroce (1925), views Machiavelli as simply a “realist” or a\n“pragmatist” advocating the suspension of commonplace\nethics in matters of politics. Moral values have no place in the sorts\nof decisions that political leaders must make, and it is a category\nerror of the gravest sort to think otherwise. Perhaps the mildest\nversion of the amoral hypothesis has been proposed by Quentin Skinner\n(1978), who claims that the ruler's commission of acts deemed vicious\nby convention is a “last best” option. Concentrating on\nthe claim in The Prince that a head of state ought to do good\nif he can, but must be prepared to commit evil if he must\n(Prince CW 58), Skinner argues that Machiavelli prefers\nconformity to moral virtue ceteris paribus. \nDisinterest in ethical concerns also permeates the claim, popular in\nthe early- and mid-twentieth century, that Machiavelli simply adopts\nthe stance of a scientist—a kind of “Galileo of\npolitics”—in distinguishing between the\n“facts” of political life and the “values” of\nmoral judgment (Olschki 1945; Cassirer 1946; Prezzolini 1954 [1967[). He is\nthereby set into the context of the scientific revolution more\ngenerally. The point of Machiavellian “science” is not to\ndistinguish between “just” and “unjust” forms\nof government, but to explain how politicians deploy power for their\nown gain. Thus, Machiavelli rises to the mantle of the founder of\n“modern” political science, in contrast with Aristotle's\nclassical norm-laden vision of a political science of virtue. More\nrecently, the Machiavelli-as-scientist interpretation has largely gone\nout of favor, although some have recently found merit in a revised\nversion of the thesis (e.g., Dyer and Nederman 2016). \nOther of Machiavelli's readers have found no taint of immoralism in\nhis thought whatsoever. Jean-Jacques Rousseau long ago held that the\nreal lesson of The Prince is to teach the people the truth\nabout how princes behave and thus to expose, rather than celebrate,\nthe immorality at the core of one-man rule. Various versions of this\nthesis have been disseminated more recently. Some scholars, such as\nGarrett Mattingly (1958), have pronounced Machiavelli the supreme\nsatirist, pointing out the foibles of princes and their advisors. The\nfact that Machiavelli later wrote biting popular stage comedies is\ncited as evidence in support of his strong satirical bent. Thus, we\nshould take nothing Machiavelli says about moral conduct at face\nvalue, but instead should understand his remarks as sharply humorous\ncommentary on public affairs. Alternatively, Mary Deitz (1986) asserts\nthat Machiavelli's agenda was driven by a desire to “trap”\nthe prince by offering carefully crafted advice (such as arming the\npeople) designed to undo the ruler if taken seriously and\nfollowed. \nA similar range of opinions exists in connection with Machiavelli's\nattitude toward religion in general, and Christianity in particular.\nMachiavelli was no friend of the institutionalized Christian Church as\nhe knew it. The Discourses makes clear that conventional\nChristianity saps from human beings the vigor required for active\ncivil life (CW 228–229, 330–331). And The Prince\nspeaks with equal parts disdain and admiration about the contemporary\ncondition of the Church and its Pope (CW 29, 44–46, 65,\n91–92). Many scholars have taken such evidence to indicate that\nMachiavelli was himself profoundly anti-Christian, preferring the\npagan civil religions of ancient societies such as Rome, which he\nregarded to be more suitable for a city endowed with\nvirtù. Anthony Parel (1992) argues that Machiavelli's\ncosmos, governed by the movements of the stars and the balance of the\nhumors, takes on an essentially pagan and pre-Christian cast. For\nothers, Machiavelli may best be described as a man of conventional, if\nunenthusiastic, piety, prepared to bow to the externalities of worship\nbut not deeply devoted in either soul or mind to the tenets of\nChristian faith. A few dissenting voices, most notably Sebastian de\nGrazia (1989) and Maurizio Viroli (2006 [2010]), have attempted to\nrescue Machiavelli's reputation from those who view him as hostile or\nindifferent to Christianity. Grazia demonstrates how central biblical\nthemes run throughout Machiavelli's writings, finding there a coherent\nconception of a divinely-centered and ordered cosmos in which other\nforces (“the heavens”, “fortune”, and the\nlike) are subsumed under a divine will and plan. Cary Nederman (2009:\n28–49) extends and systematizes Grazia's insights by showing how\nsuch central Christian theological doctrines as grace and free will\nform important elements of Machiavelli's conceptual structure. Viroli\nconsiders, by contrast, the historical attitudes toward the Christian\nreligion as manifested in the Florentine republic of Machiavelli's\nday. \nMachiavelli has also been credited (most recently by Skinner 1978)\nwith formulating for the first time the “modern concept of the\nstate”, understood in the broadly Weberian sense of an\nimpersonal form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority\nwithin a set territorial boundary. Certainly, the term lo\nstato appears widely in Machiavelli's writings, especially in\nThe Prince, in connection with the acquisition and\napplication of power in a coercive sense, which renders its meaning\ndistinct from the Latin term status (condition or station)\nfrom which it is derived. Moreover, scholars cite Machiavelli's\ninfluence in shaping the early modern debates surrounding\n“reason of state”—the doctrine that the good of the\nstate itself takes precedence over all other considerations, whether\nmorality or the good of citizens—as evidence that he was\nreceived by his near-contemporaries as a theorist of the state\n(Meineke 1924 [1957]). Machiavelli's name and doctrines were widely\ninvoked to justify the priority of the interests of the state in the\nage of absolutism. \nYet, as Harvey Mansfield (1996) has shown, a careful reading of\nMachiavelli's use of lo stato in The Prince and\nelsewhere does not support this interpretation. Machiavelli's\n“state” remains a personal patrimony, a possession more in\nline with the medieval conception of dominium as the\nfoundation of rule. (Dominium is a Latin term that may be\ntranslated with equal force as “private property” and as\n“political dominion”.) Thus, the “state” is\nliterally owned by whichever prince happens to have control of it.\nMoreover, the character of governance is determined by the personal\nqualities and traits of the ruler—hence, Machiavelli's emphasis\non virtù as indispensable for the prince's success.\nThese aspects of the deployment of lo stato in The\nPrince mitigate against the “modernity” of his idea.\nMachiavelli is at best a transitional figure in the process by which\nthe language of the state emerged in early modern Europe, as Mansfield\nconcludes. \nAnother factor that must be kept in mind when evaluating the general\napplicability of Machiavelli's theory in The Prince stems\nfrom the very situation in which his prince of virtù\noperates. Such a ruler comes to power not by dynastic inheritance or\non the back of popular support, but purely as a result of his own\ninitiative, skill, talent, and/or strength (all words that are English\nequivalents for virtù, dependent upon where it occurs\nin the text). Thus, the Machiavellian prince can count on no\npre-existing structures of legitimation, as discussed above. In order\nto “maintain his state”, then, he can only rely upon his\nown fount of personal characteristics to direct the use of power and\nestablish his claim on rulership. This is a precarious position, since\nMachiavelli insists that the throes of fortune and the conspiracies of\nother men render the prince constantly vulnerable to the loss of his\nstate. The idea of a stable constitutional regime that reflects the\ntenor of modern political thought (and practice) is nowhere to be seen\nin Machiavelli's conception of princely government. \nIndeed, one might wonder whether Machiavelli, for all of his alleged\nrealism, actually believed that a prince of complete\nvirtù could in fact exist. He sometimes seems to\nimagine that a successful prince would have to develop a psychology\nentirely different from that known hitherto to mankind, inasmuch as\nthis “new” prince is  \nprepared to vary his conduct as the winds of fortune and changing\ncircumstances constrain him and … not deviate from right\nconduct if possible, but be capable of entering upon the path of\nwrongdoing when this becomes necessary. (MP 62)  \nThis flexibility yields the core of the “practical” advice\nthat Machiavelli offers to the ruler seeking to maintain his state:\nexclude no course of action out of hand, but be ready always to\nperform whatever acts are required by political circumstance. Yet\nMachiavelli himself apparently harbored severe doubts about whether\nhuman beings were psychologically capable of generating such flexible\ndispositions within themselves. In spite of the great number of his\nhistorical examples, Machiavelli can point in The Prince to\nno single ruler who evinced the sort of variable virtù\nthat he deems necessary for the complete control of fortune. Rather,\nhis case studies of successful rulers repeatedly point to the\nsituation of a prince whose characteristics suited his times but whose\nconsistency of conduct (as in the case of Pope Julius II) “would\nhave brought about his downfall” if circumstances had changed\n(Prince CW 92). Even the Emperor Severus, whose techniques\nMachiavelli lauds, succeeded because he employed “the courses of\naction that are necessary for establishing himself in power”; he\nis not, however, to be imitated universally (Prince CW 73).\nMachiavelli's evaluation of the chances for creating a new,\npsychologically flexible type of character is extremely guarded, and\ntends to be worded in conditional form and in the subjective mood:\n“If it were possible to change one's nature to suit the times\nand circumstances, one would always be successful”\n(Prince CW 91, translation revised). Such observations must make\nus wonder whether Machiavelli's advice that princes acquire\ndispositions which vary according to circumstance was so\n“practical” (even in his own mind) as he had asserted. \nWhile The Prince is doubtless the most widely read of his\nworks, the Discourses on the Ten Books of Titus Livy perhaps\nmost honestly expresses Machiavelli's personal political beliefs and\ncommitments, in particular, his republican sympathies. The\nDiscourses certainly draw upon the same reservoir of language\nand concepts that flowed into The Prince, but the former\ntreatise leads us to draw conclusions quite different from—many\nscholars have said contradictory to—the latter. In particular,\nacross the two works, Machiavelli consistently and clearly\ndistinguishes between a minimal and a full conception of\n“political” or “civil” order, and thus\nconstructs a hierarchy of ends within his general account of communal\nlife. A minimal constitutional order is one in which subjects live\nsecurely (vivere sicuro), ruled by a strong\ngovernment which holds in check the aspirations of both nobility and\npeople, but is in turn balanced by other legal and institutional\nmechanisms. In a fully constitutional regime, however, the goal of the\npolitical order is the freedom of the community (vivere\nlibero), created by the active participation of, and\ncontention between, the nobility and the people. As Quentin Skinner\n(2002, 189–212) has argued, liberty forms a value that anchors\nMachiavelli's political theory and guides his evaluations of the\nworthiness of different types of regimes. Only in a republic, for\nwhich Machiavelli expresses a distinct preference, may this goal be\nattained. \nMachiavelli adopted this position on both pragmatic and principled\ngrounds. During his career as a secretary and diplomat in the\nFlorentine republic, he came to acquire vast experience of the inner\nworkings of French government, which became his model for the\n“secure” (but not free) polity. Although Machiavelli makes\nrelatively little comment about the French monarchy in The\nPrince, he devotes a great deal of attention to France in the\nDiscourses. \nWhy would Machiavelli effusively praise (let alone even analyze) a\nhereditary monarchy in a work supposedly designed to promote the\nsuperiority of republics? The answer stems from Machiavelli's aim to\ncontrast the best case scenario of a monarchic regime with the\ninstitutions and organization of a republic. Even the most excellent\nmonarchy, in Machiavelli's view, lacks certain salient qualities that\nare endemic to properly constituted republican government and that\nmake the latter constitution more desirable than the former. \nMachiavelli asserts that the greatest virtue of the French kingdom and\nits king is the dedication to law. “The kingdom of France is\nmoderated more by laws than any other kingdom of which at our time we\nhave knowledge”, Machiavelli declares (Discourses CW\n314, translation revised). The explanation for this situation Machiavelli\nrefers to the function of the Parlement. “The kingdom of\nFrance”, he states,  \nlives under laws and orders more than any other kingdom. These laws\nand orders are maintained by Parlements, notably that of Paris: by it\nthey are renewed any time it acts against a prince of the kingdom or\nin its sentences condemns the king. And up to now it has maintained\nitself by having been a persistent executor against that nobility.\n(Discourses CW 422, translation revised)  \nThese passages of the Discourses seem to suggest that\nMachiavelli has great admiration for the institutional arrangements\nthat obtain in France. Specifically, the French king and the nobles,\nwhose power is such that they would be able to oppress the populace,\nare checked by the laws of the realm which are enforced by the\nindependent authority of the Parlement. Thus, opportunities for\nunbridled tyrannical conduct are largely eliminated, rendering the\nmonarchy temperate and “civil”. \nYet such a regime, no matter how well ordered and law-abiding, remains\nincompatible with vivere libero. Discussing the\nability of a monarch to meet the people's wish for liberty,\nMachiavelli comments that  \nas far as the … popular desire of recovering their liberty, the\nprince, not being able to satisfy them, must examine what the reasons\nare that make them desire being free. (Discourses CW 237).\n \nHe concludes that a few individuals want freedom simply in order to\ncommand others; these, he believes, are of sufficiently small number\nthat they can either be eradicated or bought off with honors. By\ncontrast, the vast majority of people confuse liberty with security,\nimagining that the former is identical to the latter: “But all\nthe others, who are infinite, desire liberty in order to live securely\n(vivere sicuro)” (Discourses CW 237.\nAlthough the king cannot give such liberty to the masses, he can\nprovide the security that they crave: \nAs for the rest, for whom it is enough to live securely\n(vivere sicuro), they are easily satisfied by making\norders and laws that, along with the power of the king, comprehend\neveryone's security. And once a prince does this, and the people see\nthat he never breaks such laws, they will shortly begin to live\nsecurely (vivere sicuro) and contentedly\n(Discourses CW 237). \nMachiavelli then applies this general principle directly to the case\nof France, remarking that  \nthe people live securely (vivere sicuro) for no\nother reason than that its kings are bound to infinite laws in which\nthe security of all their people is comprehended. (Discourses\nCW 237)  \nThe law-abiding character of the French regime ensures security, but\nthat security, while desirable, ought never to be confused with\nliberty. This is the limit of monarchic rule: even the best kingdom\ncan do no better than to guarantee to its people tranquil and orderly\ngovernment. \nMachiavelli holds that one of the consequences of such vivere\nsicuro is the disarmament of the people. He comments that\nregardless of “how great his kingdom is”, the king of\nFrance “lives as a tributary” to foreign mercenaries. \nThis all comes from having disarmed his people and having preferred\n… to enjoy the immediate profit of being able to plunder the\npeople and of avoiding an imaginary rather than a real danger, instead\nof doing things that would assure them and make their states\nperpetually happy. This disorder, if it produces some quiet times, is\nin time the cause of straitened circumstances, damage and irreparable\nruin (Discourses CW 410). \nA state that makes security a priority cannot afford to arm its\npopulace, for fear that the masses will employ their weapons against\nthe nobility (or perhaps the crown). Yet at the same time, such a\nregime is weakened irredeemably, since it must depend upon foreigners\nto fight on its behalf. In this sense, any government that takes\nvivere sicuro as its goal generates a passive and\nimpotent populace as an inescapable result. By definition, such a\nsociety can never be free in Machiavelli's sense of vivere\nlibero, and hence is only minimally, rather than completely,\npolitical or civil. \nConfirmation of this interpretation of the limits of monarchy for\nMachiavelli may be found in his further discussion of the disarmament\nof the people, and its effects, in The Art of War. Addressing\nthe question of whether a citizen army is to be preferred to a\nmercenary one, he insists that the liberty of a state is contingent\nupon the military preparedness of its subjects. Acknowledging that\n“the king [of France] has disarmed his people in order to be\nable to command them more easily”, Machiavelli still concludes\n“that such a policy is … a defect in that kingdom, for\nfailure to attend to this matter is the one thing that makes her\nweak” (Art CW 584, 586–587). In his view,\nwhatever benefits may accrue to a state by denying a military role to\nthe people are of less importance than the absence of liberty that\nnecessarily accompanies such disarmament. The problem is not merely\nthat the ruler of a disarmed nation is in thrall to the military\nprowess of foreigners. More crucially, Machiavelli believes, a\nweapons-bearing citizen militia remains the ultimate assurance that\nneither the government nor some usurper will tyrannize the populace:\n“So Rome was free four hundred years and was armed; Sparta,\neight hundred; many other cities have been unarmed and free less than\nforty years” (Art CW 585). Machiavelli is confident\nthat citizens will always fight for their liberty—against\ninternal as well as external oppressors. Indeed, this is precisely why\nsuccessive French monarchs have left their people disarmed: they\nsought to maintain public security and order, which for them meant the\nelimination of any opportunities for their subjects to wield arms. The\nFrench regime, because it seeks security above all else (for the\npeople as well as for their rulers), cannot permit what Machiavelli\ntakes to be a primary means of promoting liberty. \nThe case of disarmament is an illustration of a larger difference\nbetween minimally constitutional systems such as France and fully\npolitical communities such as the Roman Republic, namely, the status\nof the classes within the society. In France, the people are entirely\npassive and the nobility is largely dependent upon the king, according\nto Machiavelli's own observations. By contrast, in a fully developed\nrepublic such as Rome's, where the actualization of liberty is\nparamount, both the people and the nobility take an active (and\nsometimes clashing) role in self-government (McCormick 2011; Holman\n2018). The liberty of the whole, for Machiavelli, depends upon the\nliberty of its component parts. In his famous discussion of this\nsubject in the Discourses, he remarks, \nTo me those who condemn the tumults between the Nobles and the Plebs\nseem to be caviling at the very thing that was the primary cause of\nRome's retention of liberty…. And they do not realize that in\nevery republic there are two different dispositions, that of the\npeople and that of the great men, and that all legislation favoring\nliberty is brought about by their dissension (Discourses CW\n202–203). \nMachiavelli knows that he is adopting an unusual perspective here,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. But\nMachiavelli holds that precisely the same conflicts generated a\n“creative tension” that was the source of Roman liberty.\nFor “those very tumults that so many inconsiderately\ncondemn” directly generated the good laws of Rome and the\nvirtuous conduct of its citizens (Discourses CW 202). Hence,\n \nEnmities between the people and the Senate should, therefore, be\nlooked upon as an inconvenience which it is necessary to put up with\nin order to arrive at the greatness of Rome. (Discourses CW\n211)  \nMachiavelli thinks that other republican models (such as those adopted\nby Sparta or Venice) will produce weaker and less successful political\nsystems, ones that are either stagnant or prone to decay when\ncircumstances change. \nMachiavelli evinces particular confidence in the capacity of the\npeople to contribute to the promotion of communal liberty. In the\nDiscourses, he ascribes to the masses a quite extensive\ncompetence to judge and act for the public good in various settings,\nexplicitly contrasting the “prudence and stability” of\nordinary citizens with the unsound discretion of the prince. Simply\nstated, “A people is more prudent, more stable, and of better\njudgment than a prince” (Discourses CW 316). This is\nnot an arbitrary expression of personal preference on Machiavelli's\npart. He maintains that the people are more concerned about, and more\nwilling to defend, liberty than either princes or nobles\n(Discourses CW 204–205). Where the latter tend to\nconfuse their liberty with their ability to dominate and control their\nfellows, the masses are more concerned with protecting themselves\nagainst oppression and consider themselves “free” when\nthey are not abused by the more powerful or threatened with such abuse\n(Discourses CW 203). In turn, when they fear the onset of\nsuch oppression, ordinary citizens are more inclined to object and to\ndefend the common liberty. Such an active role for the people, while\nnecessary for the maintenance of vital public liberty, is\nfundamentally antithetical to the hierarchical structure of\nsubordination-and-rule on which monarchic vivere\nsicuro rests. The preconditions of vivere\nlibero simply do not favor the security that is the aim of\nconstitutional monarchy. \nOne of the main reasons that security and liberty remain, in the end,\nincompatible for Machiavelli—and that the latter is to be\npreferred—may surely be traced to the “rhetorical”\ncharacter of his republicanism. Machiavelli clearly views speech as\nthe method most appropriate to the resolution of conflict in the\nrepublican public sphere; throughout the Discourses, debate\nis elevated as the best means for the people to determine the wisest\ncourse of action and the most qualified leaders. The tradition of\nclassical rhetoric, with which he was evidently familiar, directly\nassociated public speaking with contention: the proper application of\nspeech in the realms of forensic and deliberative genres of rhetoric\nis an adversarial setting, with each speaker seeking to convince his\naudience of the validity of his own position and the unworthiness of\nhis opponents'. This theme was taken up, in turn, by late medieval\nItalian practitioners and theorists of rhetoric, who emphasized that\nthe subject matter of the art was lite (conflict). Thus,\nMachiavelli's insistence upon contention as a prerequisite of liberty\nalso reflects his rhetorical predilections (Viroli 1998). By contrast,\nmonarchic regimes—even the most secure constitutional monarchies\nsuch as France—exclude or limit public discourse, thereby\nplacing themselves at a distinct disadvantage. It is far easier to\nconvince a single ruler to undertake a disastrous or ill-conceived\ncourse of action than a multitude of people. The apparent\n“tumult” induced by the uncertain liberty of public\ndiscussion eventually renders more likely a decision conducive to the\ncommon good than does the closed conversation of the royal court. \nThis connects to the claim in the Discourses that the popular\nelements within the community form the best safeguard of civic liberty\nas well as the most reliable source of decision-making about the\npublic good. Machiavelli's praise for the role of the people in\nsecuring the republic is supported by his confidence in the generally\nilluminating effects of public speech upon the citizen body. Near the\nbeginning of the first Discourses, he notes that some may\nobject to the extensive freedom enjoyed by the Roman people to\nassemble, to protest, and to veto laws and policies. But he responds\nthat the Romans were able to \nmaintain liberty and order because of the people's ability to discern\nthe common good when it was shown to them. At times when ordinary\nRoman citizens wrongly supposed that a law or institution was designed\nto oppress them, they could be persuaded that their beliefs are\nmistaken … [through] the remedy of assemblies, in which some\nman of influence gets up and makes a speech showing them how they are\ndeceiving themselves. And as Tully says, the people, although they may\nbe ignorant, can grasp the truth, and yield easily when told what is\ntrue by a trustworthy man (Discourses CW 203). \nThe reference to Cicero (one of the few in the Discourses)\nconfirms that Machiavelli has in mind here a key feature of classical\nrepublicanism: the competence of the people to respond to and support\nthe words of the gifted orator when he speaks truly about the public\nwelfare. \nMachiavelli returns to this theme and treats it more extensively at\nthe end of the first Discourse. In a chapter intended to demonstrate\nthe superiority of popular over princely government, he argues that\nthe people are well ordered, and hence “prudent, stable and\ngrateful”, so long as room is made for public speech and\ndeliberation within the community. Citing the formula vox\npopuli, vox dei, Machiavelli insists that \npublic opinion is remarkably accurate in its prognostications….\nWith regard to its judgment, when two speakers of equal skill are\nheard advocating different alternatives, very rarely does one find the\npeople failing to adopt the better view or incapable of appreciating\nthe truth of what it hears (Discourses CW 316). \nNot only are the people competent to discern the best course of action\nwhen orators lay out competing plans, but they are in fact better\nqualified to make decisions, in Machiavelli's view, than are princes.\nFor example,  \nthe people can never be persuaded that it is good to appoint to an\noffice a man of infamous or corrupt habits, whereas a prince may\neasily and in a vast variety of ways be persuaded to do this.\n(Discourses CW 316)  \nLikewise, should the people depart from the law-abiding path, they may\nreadily be convinced to restore order:  \nFor an uncontrolled and tumultuous people can be spoken to by a good\nman and easily led back into a good way. But no one can speak to a\nwicked prince, and the only remedy is steel…. To cure the\nmalady of the people words are enough. (Discourses CW 317)\n \nThe contrast Machiavelli draws is stark. The republic governed by\nwords and persuasion—in sum, ruled by public speech—is\nalmost sure to realize the common good of its citizens; and even\nshould it err, recourse is always open to further discourse.\nNon-republican regimes, because they exclude or limit discursive\npractices, ultimately rest upon coercive domination and can only be\ncorrected by violent means. \nMachiavelli's arguments in favor of republican regimes also appeal to\nhis skeptical stance toward the acquisition of virtù\nby any single individual, and hence the implication that a truly\nstable principality may never be attainable. The effect of the\nMachiavellian dichotomy between the need for flexibility and the\ninescapable constancy of character is to demonstrate an inherent\npractical limitation in single-ruler regimes. For the reader is\nreadily led to the conclusion that, just because human conduct is\nrooted in a firm and invariant character, the rule of a single man is\nintrinsically unstable and precarious. In the Discourses,\nMachiavelli provides a psychological case that the realities of human\ncharacter tends to favor a republic over a principality, since the\nformer “is better able to adapt itself to diverse circumstances\nthan a prince owing to the diversity found among its citizens”\n(Discourses CW 253). \nMachiavelli illustrates this claim by reference to the evolution of\nRoman military strategy against Hannibal. After the first flush of the\nCarthaginian general's victories in Italy, the circumstances of the\nRoman required a circumspect and cautious leader who would not commit\nthe legions to aggressive military action for which they were not\nprepared. Such leadership emerged in the person of Fabius Maximus,\n“a general who by his slowness and his caution held the enemy at\nbay. Nor could he have met with circumstances more suited to his\nways” (Discourses CW 452). Yet when a more offensive\nstance was demanded to defeat Hannibal, the Roman Republic was able to\nturn to the leadership of Scipio, whose personal qualities were more\nfitted to the times. Neither Fabius nor Scipio was able to escape\n“his ways and habits” (Discourses CW 452), but\nthe fact that Rome could call on each at the appropriate moment\nsuggests to Machiavelli an inherent strength of the republican\nsystem. \nIf Fabius had been king of Rome, he might easily have lost this war,\nsince he was incapable of altering his methods according as\ncircumstance changed. Since, however, he was born in a republic where\nthere were diverse citizens with diverse dispositions, it came about\nthat, just as it had a Fabius, who was the best man to keep the war\ngoing when circumstances required it, so later it had a Scipio at a\ntime suited to its victorious consummation (Discourses CW\n452). \nChanging events require flexibility of response, and since it is\npsychologically implausible for human character to change with the\ntimes, the republic offers a viable alternative: people of different\nqualities fit different exigencies. The diversity characteristic of\ncivic regimes, which was so reviled by Machiavelli's predecessors,\nproves to be an abiding advantage of republics over\nprincipalities. \nThis does not mean that Machiavelli's confidence in the capacity of\nrepublican government to redress the political shortcomings of human\ncharacter was unbridled. After all, he gives us no real indication of\nhow republics manage to identify and authorize the leaders whose\nqualities are suited to the circumstances. It is one thing to observe\nthat such variability has occurred within republics, quite another to\ndemonstrate that this is a necessary or essential feature of the\nrepublican system. At best, then, Machiavelli offers us a kind of\nempirical generalization, the theoretical foundations of which he\nleaves unexplored. And the Discourses points out that\nrepublics have their own intrinsic limitation in regard to the\nflexibility of response needed to conquer fortune. For just as with\nindividual human beings, it is difficult (if not impossible) to change\ntheir personal characteristics, so  \ninstitutions in republics do not change with the times … but\nchange very slowly because it is more painful to change them since it\nis necessary to wait until the whole republic is in a state of\nupheaval; and for this it is not enough that one man alone should\nchange his own procedure. (Discourses CW 453)  \nIf the downfall of principalities is the fixed structure of human\ncharacter, then the failing of republics is a devotion to the\nperpetuation of institutional arrangements whose time has passed.\nWhether it is any more plausible to hold out hope for the creation of\nmore responsive republican institutions than to demand flexibility in\nthe personal qualities of princes is not directly examined by the\nDiscourses. \nMachiavelli thus seems to adhere to a genuinely republican position.\nBut how are we to square this with his statements in The\nPrince? It is tempting to dismiss The Prince as an\ninauthentic expression of Machiavelli's “real” views and\npreferences, written over a short period in order to prove his\npolitical value to the returned Medici masters of Florence. (This is\ncontrasted with the lengthy composition process of the\nDiscourses.) Yet Machiavelli never repudiated The\nPrince, and indeed refers to it in the Discourses in a\nway that suggests he viewed the former as a companion to the latter.\nAlthough there has been much debate about whether Machiavelli was\ntruly a friend of princes and tyrants or of republics, and hence\nwhether we should dismiss one or another facet of his writing as\nancillary or peripheral, the questions seems irresolvable. Mark\nHulliung's suggestion that “both” Machiavellis need to be\nlent equal weight thus enjoys a certain plausibility (Hulliung\n1983). \nWhat is “modern” or “original” in\nMachiavelli's thought? What is Machiavelli's “place” in\nthe history of Western ideas? The body of literature debating this\nquestion, especially in connection with The Prince and\nDiscourses, has grown to truly staggering proportions. John\nPocock (1975), for example, has traced the diffusion of Machiavelli's\nrepublican thought throughout the so-called Atlantic world and,\nspecifically, into the ideas that guided the framers of the American\nconstitution. Paul Rahe (2008) argues for a similar set of influences,\nbut with an intellectual substance and significance different than\nPocock. For Pocock, Machiavelli's republicanism is of a civic humanist\nvariety whose roots are to be found in classical antiquity; for Rahe,\nMachiavelli's republicanism is entirely novel and modern. The\n“neo-Roman” thinkers (most prominently, Pettit, Skinner\nand Viroli) appropriate Machiavelli as a source of their principle of\n“freedom as non-domination”, while he has also been put to\nwork in the defense of democratic precepts and values. Likewise, cases\nhave been made for Machiavelli's political morality, his conception of\nthe state, his religious views, and many other features of his work as\nthe distinctive basis for the originality of his contribution. \nYet few firm conclusions have emerged within scholarship. (The\nunsettled state of play in current research on Machiavelli is well\nrepresented in Johnston et al. 2017.) One plausible explanation for\nthe inability to resolve these issues of “modernity” and\n“originality” is that Machiavelli was in a sense trapped\nbetween innovation and tradition, between via antiqua and\nvia moderna (to adopt the usage of Janet Coleman 1995), in a\nway that generated internal conceptual tensions within his thought as\na whole and even within individual texts. This historical ambiguity\npermits scholars to make equally convincing cases for contradictory\nclaims about his fundamental stance without appearing to commit\negregious violence to his doctrines. This point differs from the\naccusation made by certain scholars that Machiavelli was fundamentally\n“inconsistent” (see Skinner 1978) or simply driven by\n“local” agendas (Celenza 2015). Rather, salient features\nof the distinctively Machiavellian approach to politics should be\ncredited to an incongruity between historical circumstance and\nintellectual possibility. What makes Machiavelli a troubling yet\nstimulating thinker is that, in his attempt to draw different\nconclusions from the commonplace expectations of his audience, he\nstill incorporated important features of precisely the conventions he\nwas challenging. In spite of his repeated assertion of his own\noriginality (for instance, Prince CW 10, 57–58), his\ncareful attention to preexisting traditions meant that he was never\nfully able to escape his intellectual confines. Thus, Machiavelli\nought not really to be classified as either purely an\n“ancient” or a “modern”, but instead deserves\nto be located in the interstices between the two.","contact.mail":"nederman@polisci.tamu.edu","contact.domain":"polisci.tamu.edu"}]
