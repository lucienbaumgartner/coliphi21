It is a central value in the Kantian\ntradition of moral philosophy but it is also given fundamental status\nin John Stuart Mill’s version of utilitarian liberalism (Kant\n1785/1983, Mill 1859/1975, ch. III). Examination of the concept of\nautonomy also figures centrally in debates over education policy,\nbiomedical ethics, various legal freedoms and rights (such as freedom\nof speech and the right to privacy), as well as moral and political\ntheory more broadly. In the realm of moral theory, seeing autonomy as\na central value can be contrasted with alternative frameworks such an\nethic of care, utilitarianism of some kinds, and an ethic of virtue.\nAutonomy has traditionally been thought to connote independence and\nhence to reflect assumptions of individualism in both moral thinking\nand designations of political status. For this reason, certain\nphilosophical movements, such as certain strains of feminism, have\nresisted seeing autonomy as a value (Jaggar 1983, chap. 3). However,\nin recent decades, theorists have increasingly tried to structure the\nconcept so as to sever its ties to this brand of individualism. \n\n\nIn all such discussions the concept of autonomy is the focus of much\ncontroversy and debate, disputes which focus attention on the\nfundamentals of moral and political philosophy and the Enlightenment\nconception of the person more generally.\n\nIn the western tradition, the view that individual autonomy is a basic\nmoral and political value is very much a modern development. Putting\nmoral weight on an individual’s ability to govern herself,\nindependent of her place in a metaphysical order or her role in social\nstructures and political institutions is very much the product of the\nmodernist humanism of which much contemporary moral and political\nphilosophy is an offshoot. (For historical discussions of autonomy,\nsee Schneewind 1988, Swain 2016 and Rosich 2019). As such, it bears\nthe weight of the controversies that this legacy has attracted. The\nidea that moral principles and obligations, as well as the legitimacy\nof political authority, should be grounded in the self-governing\nindividual, considered apart from various contingencies of place,\nculture, and social relations, invites skeptics from several quarters.\nAutonomy, then, is very much at the vortex of the complex\n(re)consideration of modernity. \nPut most simply, to be autonomous is to govern oneself, to be directed\nby considerations, desires, conditions, and characteristics that are\nnot simply imposed externally upon one, but are part of what can\nsomehow be considered one’s authentic self. Autonomy in this\nsense seems an irrefutable value, especially since its opposite\n— being guided by forces external to the self and which one\ncannot authentically embrace — seems to mark the height of\noppression. But specifying more precisely the conditions of autonomy\ninevitably sparks controversy and invites skepticism about the claim\nthat autonomy is an unqualified value for all people. \nAutonomy plays various roles in theoretical accounts of persons,\nconceptions of moral obligation and responsibility, the justification\nof social policies and in numerous aspects of political theory. It\nforms the core of the Kantian conception of practical reason (see,\ne.g, Korsgaard 1996, Hill 1989) and, relatedly, connects to questions\nof moral responsibility (see Wolff 1970, 12–19). It is also seen\nas the aspect of persons that prevents or ought to prevent\npaternalistic interventions in their lives (Dworkin 1988,\n121–29). It plays a role in education theory and policy, on some\nviews specifying the core goal of liberal education generally (Gutmann\n1987, Cuypers and Haji 2008; for discussion, see Brighouse 2000,\n65–111). Also, despite many feminists’ reservations\nconcerning the ideal of autonomy, it is sometimes seen as a valuable\nconceptual element in some feminist ideals, such as the identification\nand elimination of social conditions that victimize women and other\n(potentially) vulnerable people (Friedman 1997, Meyers 1987, Christman\n1995. Veltman and Piper 2014)). \nSeveral distinctions must be made to zero in on the kind of autonomy\nthat is of greatest interest to moral and political theory.\n“Moral autonomy” refers to the capacity to impose the\n(putatively objective) moral law on oneself, and, following Kant, it\nis claimed as a fundamental organizing principle of all morality (Hill\n1989). On the other hand, what can be called “personal\nautonomy” is meant as a trait that individuals can exhibit\nrelative to any aspects of their lives, not limited to questions of\nmoral obligation (Dworkin 1988, 34–47). \nPersonal (or individual) autonomy should also be distinguished from\nfreedom, although again, there are many renderings of these\nconcepts, and certainly some conceptions of positive freedom will be\nequivalent to what is often meant by autonomy (Berlin 1969,\n131–34). Generally, one can distinguish autonomy from freedom in\nthat the latter concerns the ability to act, without external or\ninternal constraints and also (on some conceptions) with sufficient\nresources and power to make one’s desires effective (Berlin\n1969, Crocker 1980, MacCallum 1967). Autonomy concerns the\nindependence and authenticity of the desires (values, emotions, etc.)\nthat move one to act in the first place. Some distinguish autonomy\nfrom freedom by insisting that freedom concerns particular acts while\nautonomy is a more global notion, referring to states of a person\n(Dworkin 1988, 13–15, 19–20). But autonomy can be used to\nrefer both to the global condition (autonomous personhood) and as a\nmore local notion (autonomous relative to a particular trait, motive,\nvalue, or social condition). Addicted smokers for example are\nautonomous persons in a general sense but (for some) helplessly unable\nto control their behavior regarding this one activity (Christman 1989,\n13–14; cf. Meyers 1987, 66–67). \nIn addition, we must keep separate the idea of basic autonomy, the\nminimal status of being responsible, independent and able to speak for\noneself, from ideal autonomy, an achievement that serves as a goal to\nwhich we might aspire and according to which a person is maximally\nauthentic and free of manipulative, self-distorting influences. Any\nplausible conceptualization of basic autonomy must, among other\nthings, imply that most adults who are not suffering from debilitating\npathologies or are under oppressive and constricting conditions count\nas autonomous. Autonomy as an ideal, on the other hand, may well be\nenjoyed by very few if any individuals, for it functions as a goal to\nbe attained. \nThe reason to construe basic autonomy broadly enough to include most\nadults is that autonomy connects with other status designators which\napply (or, it is claimed, should apply) in this sweeping manner.\nAutonomy is connected, for example, to moral and legal responsibility,\non some views (e.g., Ripstein 1999); autonomous agency is seen as\nnecessary (and for some sufficient) for the condition of equal\npolitical standing; moreover, being autonomous stands as a barrier to\nunchecked paternalism, both in the personal, informal spheres and in\nlegal arenas (Feinberg 1986). Lacking autonomy, as young children do,\nis a condition which allows or invites sympathy, care, paternalism and\npossibly pity. Therefore, a guiding consideration in evaluating\nparticular conceptions of autonomy (though hardly a hard and fast\ntest) will be whether it connects properly to these ancillary\njudgments (for discussion of “formal conditions” of a\nconcept of autonomy, see Dworkin 1988, 7–10). \nThe variety of contexts in which the concept of autonomy functions has\nsuggested to many that there are simply a number of different\nconceptions, and that the word simply refers to different elements in\neach of those contexts (Arpaly 2004). Others have claimed that while\nthere may be a single over-arching concept of autonomy, we should\nthink in terms of separable dimensions of it rather than an all or\nnothing idea (Mackenzei 2014 and Killmister 2017). Feinberg has\nclaimed that there are at least four different meanings of\n“autonomy” in moral and political philosophy: the capacity\nto govern oneself, the actual condition of self-government, a personal\nideal, and a set of rights expressive of one’s sovereignty over\noneself (Feinberg 1989). One might argue that central to all of these\nuses is a conception of the person able to act, reflect, and choose on\nthe basis of factors that are somehow her own (authentic in some\nsense). Nevertheless, it is clear that formulating a\n“theory” of the concept will involve more than merely\nuncovering the obscure details of the idea’s essence, for\nautonomy, like many concepts central to contentious moral or political\ndebate is itself essentially contested. So a theory of autonomy is\nsimply a conceptual model aimed at capturing the general sense of\n“self-rule” or “self-government” (ideas which\nobviously admit of their own vagaries) and which can be used to\nsupport principles or policies the theory attempts to justify. \nThe idea of self-rule contains two components: the independence of\none’s deliberation and choice from manipulation by others, and\nthe capacity to rule oneself (see Dworkin 1989, 61f and Arneson 1991).\nHowever, the ability to rule oneself will lie at the core of the\nconcept, since a full account of that capability will surely entail\nthe freedom from external manipulation characteristic of independence.\nIndeed, it could be claimed that independence per se has no\nfixed meaning or necessary connection with self-government unless we\nknow what kinds of independence is required for self-rule (cf.,\nhowever Raz 1986, 373–78).  \nFocusing, then, on the requirements of self rule, it can be claimed\nthat to govern oneself one must be in a position to act competently\nbased on desires (values, conditions, etc.) that are in some sense\none’s own. This picks out the two families of conditions often\nproffered in conceptions of autonomy: competency conditions and\nauthenticity conditions. Competency includes various capacities for\nrational thought, self-control, and freedom from debilitating\npathologies, systematic self-deception, and so on. (Different accounts\ninclude different conditions: see, for example, Berofsky 1995, R.\nYoung 1991, Haworth 1986, Meyers 1989.) \nAuthenticity conditions often include the capacity to reflect upon and\nendorse (or identify with) one’s desires, values, and so on. The\nmost influential models of authenticity in this vein claim that\nautonomy requires second-order identification with first order\ndesires. For Frankfurt, for instance, such second-order desires must\nactually have the structure of a volition: wanting that the first\norder desires issue in action, that they comprise one’s will.\nMoreover, such identification, on his view, must be\n“wholehearted” for the resulting action to count as free\n (autonomous).[1] \nThis overall approach to autonomy has been very influential, and\nseveral writers have developed variations of it and defended it\nagainst objections. The most prominent objections concern, on the one\nhand, the fatal ambiguities of the concept of\n“identification” and, on the other, the threat of an\ninfinite regress of conditions. The first problem surrounds the\ndifferent ways that one can be said to “identify” with a\ndesire, each of which render the view conceptually suspect. Either one\nidentifies with an aspect of oneself in the sense of simply\nacknowledging it (without judgment) or one identifies with a desire in\nan aspirational, approving sense of that term. In the first case,\nhowever, identification would clearly not be a consistent mark of\nautonomy, for one could easily identify as part of oneself any manner\nof addictive, constricting, or imposed aspects of one’s make-up.\nBut approving of a trait is also problematic as a requirement of\nautonomy, for there are many perfectly authentic aspects of myself\n(ones for which I can and should be held fully responsible for\nexample) which I do not fully approve of. I’m not perfect, but\ndoes that mean that I am thereby not autonomous? (Cf. Watson 1989,\nBerofsky 1995,\n 99–102).[2] \nThis model stresses internal self-reflection and procedural\nindependence. However, the view includes no stipulations about the\ncontent of the desires, values, and so on, in virtue of which one is\nconsidered autonomous, specifically there is no requirement that one\nact from desires independently of others. Were there to be such a\nrequirement, it would involve what is called “substantive\nindependence”. Some writers have insisted that the autonomous\nperson must enjoy substantive independence as well as procedural\nindependence (e.g., Stoljar 2000, Benson 1987, 2005, Oshana 2006). The\nmotivation for such a position is the idea a person under constrained\nlife situations should not be considered autonomous no matter how\n“voluntary” (or autonomous) was the choice that put her in\nthat position (cf. Meyers 2000). This claim, however, threatens to rob\nthe attribution of autonomy of any claim to value neutrality it may\notherwise carry, for if, conceptually, one is not autonomous when one\n(freely, rationally, without manipulation) chooses to enter conditions\nof severely limited choice, then the concept is reserved to only those\nlifestyles and value pursuits that are seen as acceptable from a\nparticular political or theoretical point of view. I will return to\nthis line of thought in a moment. In rejoinder, it has been claimed\nthat such procedural neutrality could not capture the value autonomy\nhas for people, and moreover, a “weakly substantive” view\ncan be compatible with a political form of liberalism as long as the\nvalues inherent in the concept could be accepted by reasonable persons\nin an overlapping consensus (see Freyenhagen 2017).  \nOne variation on the internal self-reflection model focuses on the\nimportance of the personal history of the agent as an element of her\nautonomy (Christman 1991, Mele 1993; cf. Fisher & Ravizza 1998;\ncf. also Raz 1986, 371). On these views, the question of whether a\nperson is autonomous at a time depends on the processes by which she\ncame to be the way she is. It is not clear that such a focus will be\nable to avoid the problems raised about internal reflection models\n(see Mele 1991, Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b, 16–17), but such\na move attempts to embrace a conception of the self of self-government\nwhich is not only social but diachronically structured (see, e.g.,\nCuypers 2001). \nFor those who are wary of the postulate of reflective self\nendorsement, an alternative approach is to equate autonomy with simply\na set of competences, such as the capacity to choose deliberatively,\nrationally, and, as Berofsky claims, “objectively” (see\nBerofsky 1995, Meyers 1989). This locates autonomy in the general\ncapacity to respond to reasons, and not, for example, in acts of\ninternal self-identification. However, even in these accounts, the\ncapacity to think critically and reflectively is necessary for\nautonomy as one of the competences in question, even though the\nreflective thought required need not refer to external values or\nideals (Berofsky 1995, ch. 5). \nFurther difficulties have been raised with the requirement of second\norder self-appraisal for autonomy. For it is unclear that such higher\nlevel judgments have any greater claim to authenticity than their\nfirst order cousins. Clearly if a person is manipulated or oppressed\n(and hence non-autonomous), it could well be that the reflective\njudgments she makes about herself are just as tainted by that\noppression as are her ground-level decisions (Thalberg 1989, Friedman\n1986, Meyers 1989, 25–41, Noggle 2005), and often our second\norder reflective voices are merely rationalizations and acts of\nself-deception rather than true and settled aspects of our character\n(for general discussion see the essays in Veltman and Piper 2014).\nThis has led to the charge that models of autonomy which demand\nsecond-order endorsement merely introduce an infinite regress: for\nsecond-level judgments must be tested for their authenticity in the\nsame way as first order desires are, but if that is so, then ever\nhigher levels of endorsement would be called for. Various responses to\nthis problem have been made, for the most part involving the addition\nof conditions concerning the manner in which such reflection must be\nmade, for example that it must be free of certain distorting factors\nitself, it must reflect an adequate causal history, and the like\n(Christman 1991, Mele 1995). \nOther aspects of the inner reflection model should be noted. As just\nmentioned, this view of autonomy is often stated as requiring critical\nself reflection (see, e.g., Haworth 1986). This has been understood as\ninvolving a rational appraisal of one’s desires, testing them\nfor internal consistency, their relation to reliable beliefs, and the\nlike. But an overly narrow concentration on rational\nassessment exposes such conceptions to charges of hyper\nintellectualism, painting a picture of the autonomous person as a\ncold, detached calculator (see Meyers 2004, 111–37). Connections\nto values, desires, and personal traits are often grounded in\nemotional and affective responses, ones connected with care,\ncommitment, and relations to others (see Friedman 1998, MacKenzie\n& Stoljar 2000b, Meyers 1989, de Calleja, Mirja Perez 2019). For\nparallel reasons, some theorists have noted that concentration on only\ndesires as the focal point of autonomy is overly narrow, as\npeople can (fail to) exhibit self-government relative to a wide range\nof personal characteristics, such as values, physical traits,\nrelations to others, and so on (see Double 1992, 66).  \nAutonomy is central in certain moral frameworks, both as a model of\nthe moral person — the feature of the person by virtue of which\nshe is morally obligated — and as the aspect of persons which\ngrounds others’ obligations to her or him. For Kant, the\nself-imposition of universal moral law is the ground of both moral\nobligation generally and the respect others owe to us (and we owe\nourselves). In short, practical reason — our ability to use\nreasons to choose our own actions — presupposes that we\nunderstand ourselves as free. Freedom means lacking barriers to our\naction that are in any way external to our will, though it also\nrequires that we utilize a law to guide our decisions, a law that can\ncome to us only by an act of our own will (for further discussion see\nHill 1989; for doubts about this reading, see Kleingeld and Willaschek\n2019). This self-imposition of the moral law is autonomy. And since\nthis law must have no content provided by sense or desire, or any\nother contingent aspect of our situation, it must be universal. Hence\nwe have the (first formulation of the) Categorical Imperative, that by\nvirtue of our being autonomous we must act only on those maxims that\nwe can consistently will as a universal law. \nThe story continues, however: for the claim is that this capacity (to\nimpose upon ourselves the moral law) is the ultimate source of all\nmoral value — for to value anything (instrumentally or\nintrinsically) implies the ability to make value judgments generally,\nthe most fundamental of which is the determination of what is\nmorally valuable. Some theorists who are not (self-described)\nKantians have made this inference central to their views of autonomy.\nPaul Benson, for example, has argued that being autonomous implies a\nmeasure of self-worth in that we must be in a position to trust our\ndecision-making capacities to put ourselves in a position of\nresponsibility (Benson 1994; cf. also Grovier 1993, Lehrer 1997, and\nWestlund 2014). But the Kantian position is that such self-regard is\nnot a contingent psychological fact about us, but an unavoidable\nimplication of the exercise of practical reason (cf. Taylor 2005). \nSo we owe to ourselves moral respect in virtue of our autonomy. But\ninsofar as this capacity depends in no way on anything particular or\ncontingent about ourselves, we owe similar respect to all other\npersons in virtue of their capacity. Hence (via the second formulation\nof the Categorical Imperative), we are obliged to act out of\nfundamental respect for other persons in virtue of their autonomy. In\nthis way, autonomy serves as both a model of practical reason in the\ndetermination of moral obligation and as the feature of other persons\ndeserving moral respect from us. (For further discussion, see\nImmanual Kant and moral philosophy.) \nRecent discussions of Kantian autonomy have downplayed the\ntranscendental nature of practical reason in this account (see, for\nexample, Herman 1993 and Hill 1991). For example, Christine Korsgaard\nfollows Kant in seeing our capacity for self-reflection as both the\nobject of respect and the seat of normativity generally. On her view,\nwe are all guided by what she calls a “practical\nidentity”, a point of view which orients reflection on values\nand manifests an aspect of our self concept. But unlike Kant,\nKorsgaard argues that we have different practical identities that are\nthe source of our normative commitments, and not all of them are of\nfundamental moral worth. But the most general of such identities\n— that which makes us members of a kingdom of ends — is\nour moral identity, which yields universal duties and obligations\nindependent of contingent factors. Autonomy is the source of all\nobligations, whether moral or non-moral, since it is the capacity to\nimpose upon ourselves, by virtue of our practical identities,\nobligations to act (Korsgaard 1996). \nTraditional critiques of autonomy-based moral views, and Kant’s\nin particular, have been mounted along various lines. I mention two\nhere, as they connect with issues concerning autonomy in social and\npolitical theory. The first concerns the way in which autonomy-based\nmoral theory grounds obligation in our cognitive abilities\nrather than in our emotions and affective connections (see, e.g.,\nWilliams 1985, Stocker 1976). The claim is that Kantian morality\nleaves too little room for the kinds of emotional reactions that are\nconstitutive of moral response in many situations: the obligations of\nparents for example concern not only what they do but the passions and\ncare they bring forth in doing it. To view obligation as arising from\nautonomy but understanding autonomy in a purely cognitive manner makes\nsuch an account vulnerable to this kind of charge. \nThe difficulty this criticism points to resides in the ambiguities of\nthe self-description that we might utilize in valuing our\n“humanity” — our capacity to obligate ourselves. For\nwe can reflect upon our decision-making capacities and value this\npositively (and fundamentally) but regard that “self”\nengaging the capacity in different ways. The Kantian model of such a\nself is of a pure cognizer — a reflective agent engaged in\npractical reason. But also involved in decision-making are our\npassions — emotions, desires, felt commitments, senses of\nattraction and aversion, alienation and comfort. These are both the\nobjects of our judgement and partly constitutive of them — to\npassionately embrace an option is different from cooly determining it\nto be best. Judgment is involved with all such passions when decisions\nare made. And it (judgment) need not be understood apart from them,\nbut as an ability to engage in those actions whose passionate and\nreasoned support we muster up. So when the optimal decision for me is\nan impassioned one, I must value my ability to engage in the right\npassions, not merely in the ability to cold-heartedly reflect and\nchoose. Putting the passions outside the scope of reasoned reflection,\nas merely an ancillary quality of the action — to consider how\nto do something not merely what we are doing — is to make one\nkind of decision. Putting passions inside that scope — saying\nthat what it is right to do now is to act with a certain affect or\npassion — is another. When we generalize from our ability to\nmake the latter sort of decisions, we must value not only the ability\nto weigh options and universalize them but also the ability to engage\nthe right affect, emotion, etc. Therefore, we value ourselves and\nothers as passionate reasoners not merely reasoners per se. \nThe implication of this observation is that in generalizing our\njudgments in the manner Korsgaard (following Kant) says we must, we\nneed not commit ourselves to valuing only the cognitive capacities of\nhumanity but also its (relatively) subjective elements.  \nA second question is this: since the reflection that is involved in\nautonomy (and which, according to this view, is the source of\nnormativity) need only be hypothetical reflection upon\none’s desires and mental capacities, then the question arises:\nunder what conditions is this hypothetical reflection meant to take\nplace? If the capacity for reflection is the seat of obligation, then\nwe must ask if the conditions under which such hypothetical reflection\ntakes place are idealized in any sense — if they are assumed to\nbe reasonable for example. Are we considering merely the reflections\nthe (actual) person would make were she to turn her attention to the\nquestion, no matter how unreasonable such reflections might be? If so,\nwhy should we think this grounds obligations? If we assume they are\nreasonable, then under some conditions moral obligations are not\nimposed by the actual self but rather by an idealized, more rational\nself. This implies that morality is not literally self-imposed if by\n“self” one means the actual set of judgments made by the\nagent in question. Indeed, a Platonist/realist about moral value could\nclaim that the objective values which (according to the theory) apply\nto all agents independent of choice are in fact\n“self-imposed” in this idealized sense: they would be\nimposed were the person to reflect on the matter, acting as a\nperfectly reasonable agent. This shows the complex and potentially\nproblematic implications of this ambiguity. \nThis points to the question of whether autonomy can be the seat of\nmoral obligation and respect if autonomy is conceived in a purely\nprocedural manner. If no substantive commitments or value orientations\nare included in the conceptual specification of autonomy, then it is\nunclear how this capacity grounds any particular substantive value\ncommitments. On the other hand, if autonomy includes a specification\nof particular values in its conditions — that the autonomous\nperson must value her own freedom for example — then it turns\nout that moral obligation (and respect) attaches only to those already\ncommitted in this way, and not more generally to all rational agents\nas such (as traditionally advertised by the view). This echoes, of\ncourse, Hegel’s critique of Kant. \nThese difficulties point to ambiguities in autonomy-based moral views,\nones which may well be clarified in further developments of those\ntheories. They also pick up on traditional problems with Kantian\nethics (though there are many other such difficulties not mentioned\nhere). Before leaving moral philosophy, we should consider ethical\nviews which focus on autonomy but which do not depend directly on a\nKantian framework. \nAutonomy can play a role in moral theory without that theory being\nfully Kantian in structure. For example, it is possible to argue that\npersonal autonomy has intrinsic value independent of a fully worked\nout view of practical reason. Following John Stuart Mill, for example,\none can claim that autonomy is “one of the elements of\nwell-being” (Mill 1859/1975, ch. III). Viewing autonomy as an\nintrinsic value or as a constitutive element in personal well-being in\nthis way opens the door to a generally consequentialist moral\nframework while paying heed to the importance of self-government to a\nfulfilling life (for discussion see Sumner 1996). \nIt may also be unclear why autonomy — viewed here as the\ncapacity to reflect on and endorse one’s values, character and\ncommitments — should have value independent of the results of\nexercising that capacity. Why is one person’s autonomy\nintrinsically valuable when she uses it to, say, harm herself or make\nrash or morally skewed choices? More generally, how can we take\naccount of the systematic biases and distortions that plague typical\nhuman reasoning in valuing people’s capacity to make decisions\nfor themselves (see, e.g., Conly 2013)? This question becomes more\nacute as we consider ways that autonomy can obtain in degrees, for\nthen it is unclear why personal autonomy should be seen as equally\nvaluable in persons who display different levels of it (or different\nlevels of those abilities that are its conditions, such as\nrationality). \nIndeed, autonomy is often cited as the ground of treating all\nindividuals equally from a moral point of view. But if autonomy is not\nan all-or-nothing characteristic, this commitment to moral equality\nbecomes problematic (Arneson 1999). It can be argued that insofar as\nthe abilities required for autonomy, such as rational reflectiveness,\ncompetences in carrying out one’s decisions, and the like, vary\nacross individuals (within or between species as well), then it is\ndifficult to maintain that all autonomous beings have equal moral\nstatus or that their interests deserve the same weight in considering\ndecisions that affect them. \nThe move that must be made here, I think, picks up on\nKorsgaard’s gloss on Kantianism and the argument that our\nreflective capacities ultimately ground our obligations to others and,\nin turn, others’ obligations to regard us as moral equals.\nArneson argues, however, that people surely vary in this capacity as\nwell — the ability to reflectively consider options and choose\nsensibly from among them. Recall what we said above concerning the\nambiguities of Korsgaard’s account concerning the degree to\nwhich the self-reflection that grounds obligation is idealized at all.\nIf it is, then it is not the everyday capacity to look within\nourselves and make a choice that gives us moral status but the more\nrarified ability to do so rationally, in some full sense. But we\nsurely vary in our ability to reach that ideal, so why should our\nautonomy be regarded as equally worthy? \nThe answer may be that our normative commitments do not arise from our\nactual capacities to reflect and to choose (though we must have such\ncapacities to some minimal degree), but rather from the way in which\nwe must view ourselves as having these capacities. We give\nspecial weight to our own present and past decisions, so that we\ncontinue on with projects and plans we make because (all other things\nbeing equal) we made them, they are ours, at least when we do\nthem after some reflective deliberation. The pull that our own\ndecisions have on our ongoing projects and actions can only be\nexplained by the assumption that we confer status and value on\ndecisions simply because we reflectively made them (perhaps, though,\nin light of external, objective considerations). This is an\nall-or-nothing capacity and hence may be enough to ground our equal\nstatus even if perhaps, in real life, we exercise this capacity to\nvarying\n degrees.[3]\n Much has been written about conceptions of well being that rehearse\nthese worries (see Sumner 1996, Griffin 1988). Such a view might be\nbuttressed with the idea that the attribution of autonomous agency,\nand the respect that purportedly goes with it, is itself a normative\nstance, not a mere observation of how a person actually thinks and\nacts (for discussion of this position see Christman 2009, chap. 10 and\nKorsgaard 2014) \nAutonomy is the aspect of persons that undue paternalism offends\nagainst. Paternalistic interventions can be both interpersonal\n(governed by social and moral norms) and a matter of policy (mediated\nby formal or legal rules). Such interventions are identified not by\nthe kind of acts they involve but by the justification given for them,\nso that paternalism involves interference with a person’s\nactions or knowledge against that person’s will for the purpose\nof advancing that person’s good. Respect for autonomy is meant\nto prohibit such interventions because they involve a judgment that\nthe person is not able to decide for herself how best to pursue her\nown good. Autonomy is the ability to so decide, so for the autonomous\nsubject of such interventions paternalism involves a lack of respect\nfor autonomy. See also Paternalism. \nBut as our discussion of the nature of autonomy indicated, it is often\nunclear exactly what that characteristic involves. Important in this\ncontext is whether autonomy can be manifested in degrees —\nwhether the abilities and capacities that constitute autonomy obtain\nall at once or progressively, or I can enjoy sufficient autonomy in\nsome areas of my life but not in others. If autonomy is a matter of\ndegree in any of these ways, then it is unclear that a blanket\nprohibition against paternalism is warranted. Some people will be less\nable to judge for themselves what their own good is and hence be more\nsusceptible to (justified) paternalistic intervention (Conly 2013; see\nalso Killmister 2017, chap. 7). \nOften such an obligation toward another person requires us to treat\nher as autonomous, independent of the extent to which she is so\nconcerning the choice in question. At least this is the case when a\nperson is autonomous above a certain threshold: she is an adult, not\nunder the influence of debilitating factors, and so on. I might know\nthat a person is to some degree under the sway of external pressures\nthat are severely limiting her ability to govern her life and make\nindependent choices. But as long as she has not lost the basic ability\nto reflectively consider her options and make choices, if I intervene\nagainst her will (for her own good), I show less respect for her as a\nperson than if I allow her to make her own mistakes. (Which is not to\nsay, of course, that intervention in such cases might not, in the end,\nbe justified; only that something is lost when it is engaged in, and\nwhat is lost is a degree of interpersonal respect we owe each\nother.) \nHowever, as we saw in the last section, this move depends on the\ndetermination of basic autonomy and an argument that such a threshold\nis non-arbitrary. Also relevant here is the question of procedural\nversus substantive autonomy as the ground of the prohibition of\npaternalism. For if by “autonomy” we mean the ability to\ngovern oneself no matter how depraved or morally worthless are the\noptions being exercised, it is unclear that the bar to paternalism\n(and respect for persons generally) retains its normative force. As I\nmentioned above, the response to this challenge must be that the\ndecision making capacity itself is of non-derivative value,\nindependent of the content of those decisions, at least if one wishes\nto avoid the difficulties of positing a substantive (and hence\nnon-neutral) conception of autonomy as the basis for interpersonal\nrespect. \nThis is merely a sampling of some of the central ways that the idea of\nautonomy figures in moral philosophy. Not discussed here are areas of\napplied ethics, for example in medical ethics, where respect for\nautonomy grounds such principles as that of informed consent. Such\ncontexts illustrate the fundamental value that autonomy generally is\nthought to represent as expressive of one of the fundamentals of moral\npersonhood.  \nThe conception of the autonomous person plays a variety of roles in\nvarious constructions of liberal political theory (for recent\ndiscussion, see, e.g., Coburn 2010, Christman 2015 and the essays in\nChristman and Anderson, eds. 2005). Principally, it serves as the\nmodel of the person whose perspective is used to formulate and justify\npolitical principles, as in social contract models of principles of\njustice (Rawls 1971). Also (and correspondingly) it serves as the\nmodel of the citizen whose basic interests are reflected in those\nprinciples, such as in the claim that basic liberties, opportunities,\nand other primary goods are fundamental to flourishing lives no matter\nwhat moral commitments, life plans, or other particulars of the person\nmight obtain (Kymlicka 1989, 10–19, Waldron 1993:\n 155–6).[4]\n Moreover, autonomy is ascribed to persons (or projected as an ideal)\nin order to delineate and critique oppressive social conditions,\nliberation from which is considered a fundamental goal of justice\n(whether or not those critiques are described as within the liberal\ntradition or as a specific alternative to it) (cf. Keornahan 1999,\nCornell 1998, Young 1990, Gould 1988; cf. also Hirschmann 2002,\n1–29). \nFor our purposes here, liberalism refers generally to that approach to\npolitical power and social justice that determines principles of right\n(justice) prior to, and largely independent of, determination of\nconceptions of the good (though see Liberalism; see also\nChristman 2017, ch. 4). This implies that the liberal conception of\njustice, and the legitimation of political power more generally, can\nbe specified and justified without crucial reference to controversial\nconceptions of value and moral principles (what Rawls calls\n“comprehensive moral conceptions” (Rawls 1993,\n13–15). The fact of permanent pluralism of such moral\nconceptions is therefore central to\n liberalism.[5] \nOne manner in which debates concerning autonomy directly connect to\ncontroversies within and about liberalism concerns the role that state\nneutrality is to play in the justification and application of\nprinciples of justice. Neutrality is a controversial standard, of\ncourse, and the precise way in which liberal theory is committed to a\nrequirement of neutrality is complex and controversial (see Raz 1986,\n110–64, Waldron 1993, 143–67). The question to be asked\nhere is whether the conception of autonomy utilized in liberal\ntheories must itself attempt to be neutral concerning various\nconceptions of morality and value, or, alternatively, does the\nreliance on autonomy in the justification and specification of liberal\ntheories of justice render them non-neutral simply because of this\nreliance (no matter how “neutral” the conception of\nautonomy utilized turns out to be) (Christman 2015). \nLet us consider this first question and in so doing revisit the issue\nof whether the independence implicit in autonomy should best be\nconceived in a purely “procedural” manner or more\nsubstantively. Recall that some theorists view autonomy as requiring\nminimal competence (or rationality) along with authenticity, where the\nlatter condition is fleshed out in terms of the capacity to\nreflectively accept motivational aspects of oneself. This view can be\ncalled “proceduralist” because it demands that the\nprocedure by which a person comes to identify a desire (or trait) as\nher own is what is crucial in the determination of its authenticity\nand hence autonomy. This conception of autonomy is adopted, according\nto its defenders, because doing so is the only way to ensure that\nautonomy is neutral toward all conceptions of value and the good that\nreasonable adults may come to internalize (Dworkin 1989, Freyenhage\n2017). \nCritics of this view have pointed to cases where it is imagined that\npersons adopt what we all would call oppressive and overly restrictive\nlife situations but in a way that meets the minimal conditions of\nautonomy on proceduralist accounts, so that on such accounts they\ncount as autonomous because of the self-governing processes by which\nthey entered such oppressive conditions. These critics argue that any\nconception of autonomy that ascribes that trait to such people is\nwrongly conceived (Benson 1987, MacKenzie & Stoljar 2001b and\n2017, Waller 1993, and Oshana 1998). On the basis of such a judgment,\nthey argue that normatively substantive conditions should be added to\nthe requirements of autonomy, conditions such as the ability to\nrecognize and follow certain moral or political norms (See Benson\n1987, Wolf 1980; for criticism, see Berofsky 1995, ch. 7). This\ncriticism suggests that considerations concerning the autonomous self\ncannot avoid questions of identity and hence whether the self of\nself-government can be understood independently of the (perhaps\nsocially defined) values in terms of which people conceive of\nthemselves; this is a subject to which we now turn.  \nAutonomy, as we have been describing it, certainly attaches\nparadigmatically to individual persons; it is not (in this usage) a\nproperty of groups or peoples. So the autonomy that grounds basic\nrights and which connects to moral responsibility, as this concept is\nthought to do, is assigned to persons without essential reference to\nother people, institutions, or traditions within which they may live\nand act. Critics claim, however, that such a view runs counter to the\nmanner in which most of us (or all of us in some ways) define\nourselves, and hence diverges problematically from the aspects of\nidentity that motivate action, ground moral commitments, and by which\npeople formulate life plans. Autonomy, it is argued, implies the\nability to reflect wholly on oneself, to accept or reject one’s\nvalues, connections, and self-defining features, and change such\nelements of one’s life at will. But we are all not only deeply\nenmeshed in social relations and cultural patterns, we are also\ndefined by such relations, some claim(Sandel 1982, 15–65). For\nexample, we use language to engage in reflection but language is\nitself a social product and deeply tied to various cultural forms. In\nany number of ways we are constituted by factors that lie beyond our\nreflective control but which nonetheless structure our values,\nthoughts, and motivations (Taylor 1991, 33f; for discussion see Bell\n1993, 24–54). To say that we are autonomous (and hence morally\nresponsible, bear moral rights, etc.) only when we can step back from\nall such connections and critically appraise and possibly alter them\nflies in the face of these psychological and metaphysical\n realities.[6] \nIn a different manner, critics have claimed that the liberal\nconception of the person, reflected in standard models of autonomy,\nunder-emphasizes the deep identity-constituting connections we have\nwith gender, race, culture, and religion, among other things. Such\n“thick” identities are not central to the understanding of\nthe self-governing person who, according to standard liberal models,\nis fully able to abstract from such elements of her self-concept and\nto either identify with or to reject such them. But such an ideal too\nnarrowly valorizes the life of the cosmopolitan “man”\n— the world traveler who freely chooses whether to settle into\nthis or that community, identify with this or that group, and so on\n(see Young 1991, Alcoff 2006 and Appiah 2010; for discussion, see\nMeyers, 2000b).  \nThese challenges have also focused on the relation of the self to its\nculture (Margalit and Raz, 1990, Tamir 1993). What is at issue from a\npolicy perspective is that emphasis on the individual’s\nself-government, with the cosmopolitan perspective that this entails,\nmakes it difficult if not impossible to ground rights to the\nprotection and internal self- government of traditional cultures\nthemselves (Kymlicka, 1995). This is problematic in that it excludes\nfrom the direct protection of liberal policies those individuals and\ngroups whose self-conceptions and value commitments are deeply\nconstituted by cultural factors. Or, conversely, the assumption that\nthe autonomous person is able to separate himself from all cultural\ncommitments forestalls moves to provide state protection for cultural\nforms themselves, insofar as such state policies rest on the value of\nautonomy.  \nThere have been many responses to these charges on behalf of a liberal\noutlook (e.g., Kymlicka, 1989, Gutman, 1985, Appiah 2005; for a\ngeneral response to question of cultural identities see Kymlicka\n1997). The most powerful response is that autonomy need not require\nthat people be in a position to step away from all of their\nconnections and values and to critically appraise them. Mere piecemeal\nreflection is all that is required. As Kymlicka puts it: “No\nparticular task is set for us by society, and no particular cultural\npractice has authority that is beyond individual judgement and\npossible rejection” (Kymlicka, 1989:, 50).  \nThere is a clarification that is needed in this exchange, however. For\ninsofar as defenders of liberal principles (based on the value of\nautonomy) claim that all aspects of a person’s self-concept be\nsubject to alteration in order to manifest autonomy, they needlessly\nexaggerate the commitments of the liberal position. For such a view is\nopen to the charge that liberal conceptions fail to take seriously the\npermanent and unalterable aspects of the self and its social position\n(Young, 1990, 46). Our embodiment, for example, is often not something\nwhich we can alter other than marginally, and numerous other\nself-defining factors such as sexual orientation (for some), native\nlanguage, culture and race, are not readily subject to our\nmanipulation and transformation, even in a piecemeal manner. To say\nthat we are heteronomous because of this is therefore deeply\nproblematic. What must be claimed by the defender of autonomy-based\nliberalism is that the ability in question is to change those aspects\nof oneself from which one is deeply alienated (or with which one does\nnot identify, etc.). For in those cases where, upon reflection, one\nexperiences one’s body, culture, race, or sexuality as an\nexternal burden constricting one’s more settled and authentic\nnature, and still one cannot alter that factor, then one lacks\nautonomy relative to it (see Christman,2009 ch. 6). But if one feels\nfully at home within those unalterable parameters one does not lack\nautonomy because of that unalterability (for a different way of\napproach this issue see Mahmoud 2005 and Khader 2011).  \nAs we said, several writers have claimed that proceduralist accounts\nof autonomy would wrongly attribute autonomy to those whose restricted\nsocialization and stultifying life conditions pressure them into\ninternalizing oppressive values and norms, for example women who have\ninternalized the belief in the social authority of husbands, or that\nonly by having and raising children are their lives truly complete,\nand the like. If such women reflect on these values they may well\nendorse them, even if doing so is free of any specific\nreflection-inhibiting conditions. But such women surely lack autonomy,\nit is claimed; so only if autonomy includes a requirement that one be\nable to recognize basic value claims (such as the person’s own\nequal moral standing) will that concept be useful in describing the\noppressive conditions of a patriarchal society (see, e.g., Oshana,\n1998, Stoljar, 2000; for discussion see Christman 2009 chap. 8,\nBenson, 1990, Friedman, 2000, Meyers, 1987,\n 1989).[7] \nThese and related considerations have sparked some to develop an\nalternative conception of autonomy meant to replace allegedly overly\nindividualistic notions. This replacement has been called\n“relational autonomy” (MacKenzie and Stoljar, 2000a).\nSpurred by feminist critiques of traditional conceptions of autonomy\nand rights (Nedelsky, 1989, Code, 1991), relational conceptions of\nautonomy stress the ineliminable role that relatedness plays in both\npersons’ self- conceptions, relative to which autonomy must be\ndefined, and the dynamics of deliberation and reasoning. These views\noffer a provocative alternative to traditional models of the\nautonomous individual, but it must be made clear what position is\nbeing taken on the issue: on the one hand, relational accounts can be\ntaken as resting on a non-individualist conception of the person and\nthen claim that insofar as autonomy is self-government and the self is\nconstituted by relations with others, then autonomy is relational; or\nthese accounts may be understood as claiming that whatever selves turn\nout to be, autonomy fundamentally involves social relations rather\nthan individual traits (Oshana, 2006). Some such views also waiver\nbetween claiming that social and personal relations play a crucial\ncausal role in the development and enjoyment of autonomy and claiming\nthat such relations constitute autonomy (for discussion see Mackenzie\nand Stoljar, 2000b, 21–26; for a recent overview, see Mackenzie\n2014). \nAnother relational element to autonomy that has been developed\nconnects social support and recognition of the person’s status\nto her capacities for self-trust, self-esteem, and self-respect. The\ncore argument in these approaches is that autonomy requires the\nability to act effectively on one’s own values (either as an\nindividual or member of a social group), but that oppressive social\nconditions of various kinds threaten those abilities by removing\none’s sense of self-confidence required for effective agency.\nSocial recognition and/or support for this self-trusting status is\nrequired for the full enjoyment of these abilities (see Anderson and\nHonneth 2005, Grovier 1993, Benson 2005, McCleod and Sherwin 2005, and\nWestlund 2014). \nThese claims often are accompanied with a rejection of purportedly\nvalue-neutral, proceduralist accounts of autonomy, even those that\nattempt to accommodate a fully social conception of the self. One\nquestion that arises with relational views connected to self-trust in\nthis way: why, exactly are such relations seen as conceptually\nconstitutive of autonomy rather than contributory to it (and its\ndevelopment), where the self-confidence or self-trust in question is\nthe core element to which these sorts of social relations are an\nimportant (albeit contingent) contributor. Another question to be\nconsidered arises from those cases where self-trust is established\ndespite lack of social recognition, as when runaway slaves manage to\nheroically push on with their quest for freedom while facing violent\ndenials from surrounding others (and surrounding social structures)\nthat they enjoy the status of a full human being capable of authentic\ndecision making. Finally, self-trust is not always merited: consider\nthe brash teenager who insists on exercising social independence based\non her unwarranted confidence in her abilities to make good judgments\n(see Mackenzie 2008, n. 36). \nNevertheless, these approaches have all importantly shifted\nphilosophical attention concerning autonomy to the social and\ninterpersonal dynamics that shape its enjoyment, connecting ideas\nabout autonomy with broader issues of social justice, recognition, and\nsocial practices. This brings us back, then, to considerations of the\nliberal project and its potential limitations, where autonomy remains\ncentral. \nAs noted earlier, there are various versions of liberal political\nphilosophy. All of them, however, are committed to a conception of\npolitical legitimacy in which political power and authority is\njustified only if such authority is acceptable to all citizens bound\nby it (see Rawls 1993, 144–50). This connects to a broader view\nof the foundations of value that at least some liberal theorists\npresent as central to that tradition. That is the claim that values\nare valid for a person only if those values are or can be reasonably\nendorsed by the person in question. By extension, principles guiding\nthe operation of institutions of social and political power —\nwhat Rawls calls the institutions of the basic structure (Rawls 1993,\n258) — are legitimate only if they can be endorsed in this way\nby those subject to them. In this way, liberalism (in most of its\nforms) is committed to what some have called the “endorsement\nconstraint” (Kymlicka 1989, 12f, R. Dworkin 2000,\n216–18). \nModels of autonomy considered above include a condition that mirrors\nthis constraint, in that a person is autonomous relative to some\naction-guiding norm or value only if, upon critical reflection of that\nvalue, she identifies with it, approves of it, or does not feel deeply\nalienated from it. Combining this view with the endorsement\nconstraint, liberalism carries the implication that autonomy is\nrespected only when guiding values or principles in a society can be\nembraced in some way by those governed by them. This will connect\ndirectly to the liberal theory of legitimacy to be discussed\nbelow. \nPerfectionists reject this set of claims. Perfectionism is the view\nthat there are values valid for an individual or a population even\nwhen, from the subjective point of view of those agents or groups,\nthat value is not endorsed or accepted (Wall 1998, Sumner 1996,\n45–80, Hurka 1993, Sher 1997; see also Perfectionism). In\nshort, it is the view that there are entirely objective values. While\nthere are perfectionist liberals, this view generally resists the\nliberal claim that the autonomous acceptance of the central components\nof political principles is a necessary condition for the legitimacy of\nthose principles. Moreover, perfectionists question the liberal\ncommitment to neutrality in the formulation and application of\npolitical principles (Hurka 1993, 158–60). \nPerfectionists specifically target the liberal connection between\nrespect for autonomy and neutrality of political principles (Wall\n1998, 125–204). For many, liberalism rests on the value of\nindividual autonomy, but this reliance either assumes that respect for\nautonomy is merely one value among others in the liberal view, or\nautonomy has overriding value. In either case, however, neutrality is\nnot supported. If autonomy is merely one value among others, for\nexample, then there will clearly be times when state support of those\nother values will override respect for autonomy (paternalistic\nrestrictions imposed to promote citizen safety, for example) (Sher\n1997, 45–105, Hurka 1993, 158–60, Conly 2013). On the\nother hand, autonomy could be seen as an absolute constraint on the\npromotion of values, or, more plausibly, as a constitutive condition\nof the validity of all values for a person, as the endorsement\nconstraint implies. Perfectionists reply, however, that this is itself\na controversial value position, one that may not find unqualified\ngeneral support (Hurka 1993, 148–52, Sher 1997, 58–60,\nSumner 1996, 174–83; cf. Griffin 1986, 135– 36). To answer\nthese objections, one must turn to consideration of the liberal\nprinciple of legitimacy. For the claim that liberals make concerning\nthe limits of state promotion of the good — a limit set by\nrespect for autonomy — depends heavily on their view about the\nultimate ground of political power. \nLiberalism is generally understood to arise historically out of the\nsocial contract tradition of political philosophy and hence rests on\nthe idea of popular sovereignty. The concept of autonomy, then,\nfigures centrally in at least one dominant strand in this tradition,\nthe strand the runs through the work of Kant. The major alternative\nversion of the liberal tradition sees popular sovereignty as basically\na collective expression of rational choice and that the principles of\nthe basic institutions of political power are merely instrumental in\nthe maximization of aggregate citizen welfare (or, as with Mill, a\nconstitutive element of welfare broadly considered).  \nBut it is the Kantian brand of liberalism that places autonomy of\npersons at center stage. Rawls’s Theory of Justice was\nseen as the contemporary manifestation of this Kantian approach to\njustice, where justice was conceived as those principles that would be\nchosen under conditions of unbiased rational decision-making (from\nbehind the veil of ignorance). The original position where such\nprinciples would be chosen was said by Rawls to mirror Kant’s\nCategorical Imperative. That is, it is a device in which persons can\nchoose principles to impose upon themselves in a way which is\nindependent of contingencies of social position, race, sex, or\nconception of the good (Rawls 1971, 221–27). But as is well\nknown, the Kantian foundations of Rawls’s theory of justice\nrendered it vulnerable to the charge that it was inapplicable to those\npopulations (all modern populations in fact) where deep moral\npluralism abounds. For under such conditions, no theory of justice\nwhich rests on a metaphysically grounded conception of the person\ncould claim full allegiance from members of a population whose deep\ndiversity causes them to disagree about metaphysics itself, as well as\nabout moral frameworks and conceptions of value related to it. For\nthis reason, Rawls developed a new (or further developed)\nunderstanding of the foundations of his version of liberalism, a\npolitical conception (Rawls 1993). \nUnder political liberalism, autonomy of persons is postulated, not as\na metaphysically grounded “fact” about moral personality\nor practical reason as such, but rather as one of several\n“device[s] of representation” under which diverse citizens\ncan focus on the methods of derivation (such as the original position)\nfor substantive principles of justice (Rawls 1999, 303–58).\nJustice is achieved only when an overlapping consensus among people\nmoved by deeply divergent but reasonable comprehensive moral views can\nbe attained, a consensus in which such citizens can affirm principles\nof justice from within those comprehensive views. \nPolitical Liberalism shifts the focus from a philosophical conception\nof justice, formulated abstractly and meant to apply universally, to a\npractical conception of legitimacy where consensus is reached without\npretension of deep metaphysical roots for the principles in question.\nMore than merely a “modus vivendi” for the participating\nparties, justice must be affirmed in a way that finds a moral basis\nfor all participating citizens, albeit from different frameworks of\nvalue and moral obligation. The operation of public reason, then,\nserves as the means by which such a consensus might be established,\nand hence public discussion and democratic institutions must be seen\nas a constitutive part of the justification of principles of justice\nrather than merely a mechanism for the collective determination of the\nsocial good. \nBut the role of autonomy in the specification of this picture should\nnot be under- emphasized (or the controversies it invites ignored).\nFor such a consensus counts as legitimate only when achieved under\nconditions of free and authentic affirmation of shared principles.\nOnly if the citizens see themselves as fully able to reflectively\nendorse or reject such shared principles, and to do so competently and\nwith adequate information and range of options, can the overlapping\npolitical consensus step beyond the purely strategic dynamics of a\nmodus vivendi and ground legitimate institutions of political\npower. \nIndeed, the assumption that all those subject to political authority\nenjoy the developed capacity to reflectively accept their life path\nand the values inherent in it invokes a level of idealization that\nbelies the conditions of many victims of past and ongoing oppression.\nThis virtually ensures that such structural conditions of society as\nracial domination, profound inequality of power, and patterns of\nexclusion of groups from equal standing in social space will be\nassumed away as irrelevant to the question of legitimacy (Mills\n2005). \nTherefore, social conditions that hamper the equal enjoyment of\ncapacities to reflectively consider and (if necessary) reject\nprinciples of social justice, due, say, to extreme poverty,\ndisability, ongoing injustice and inequality, or the like, restrict\nthe establishment of just principles. Autonomy, then, insofar as that\nconcept picks out the free reflective choice operating in the\nestablishment of legitimacy, is basic to, and presupposed by, even\nsuch non-foundational (political) conceptions of justice. \nCritics of political liberalism arise from several quarters. However,\namong the objections to it that focus on autonomy are those that\nquestion whether a political conception of legitimacy that rests on\nshared values can be sustained without the validity of those values\nbeing seen as somehow objective or fundamental, a position that\nclashes with the purported pluralism of political liberalism.\nOtherwise, citizens with deeply conflicting worldviews could not be\nexpected to affirm the value of autonomy except as a mere modus\nvivendi (see, e.g., Wall 2009; cf. also Larmore 2008,\n146–6). A line of response to this worry that could be pursued\nwould be one that claimed that values that amount to autonomy (in some\nconceptualization of that idea) are already functional in the social\nstructures and cultural practices of otherwise defensible democratic\npractices (as well as some critical projects that emphasize oppression\nand domination, as we saw above). This point raises the issue, to\nwhich we now turn, of the connection between autonomy, political\nliberalism, and democracy. \nIn closing, we should add a word about the implications of political\nliberalism for the traditional division between liberal justice and\ndemocratic theory. I say “division” here, but different\nviews of justice and democracy will convey very different conceptions\nof the relation between the two (see Christiano 1996, Lakoff 1996).\nBut traditionally, liberal conceptions of justice have viewed\ndemocratic mechanisms of collective choice as essential but highly\ncircumscribed by the constitutional provisions that principles of\njustice support. Individual rights and freedoms, equality before the\nlaw, and various privileges and protections associated with citizen\nautonomy are protected by principles of justice and hence not subject\nto democratic review, on this approach (Gutmann 1993). \nHowever, liberal conceptions of justice have themselves evolved (in\nsome strains at least) to include reference to collective discussion\nand debate (public reason) among the constitutive conditions of\nlegitimacy. It could be claimed, then, that basic assumptions about\ncitizens’ capacities for reflective deliberation and choice\n— autonomy — must be part of the background conditions\nagainst which an overlapping consensus or other sort of political\nagreement concerning principles of justice is to operate. \nSome thinkers have made the connection between individual or\n“private” autonomy and collective or “public”\nlegitimacy — prominent, most notably Habermas (Habermas 1994).\nOn this view, legitimacy and justice cannot be established in advance\nthrough philosophical construction and argument, as was thought to be\nthe case in natural law traditions in which classical social contract\ntheory flourished and which is inherited (in different form) in\ncontemporary perfectionist liberal views. Rather, justice amounts to\nthat set of principles that are established in practice and rendered\nlegitimate by the actual support of affected citizens (and\ntheir representatives) in a process of collective discourse and\ndeliberation (see e.g., Fraser 1997, 11–40 and Young 2000).\nSystems of rights and protections (private, individual autonomy) will\nnecessarily be protected in order to institutionalize frameworks of\npublic deliberation (and, more specifically, legislation and\nconstitutional interpretation) that render principles of social\njustice acceptable to all affected (in consultation with others)\n(Habermas 1994, 111). \nThis view of justice, if at all acceptable, provides an indirect\ndefense of the protection of autonomy and, in particular,\nconceptualizing autonomy in a way that assumes reflective self-\nevaluation. For only if citizen participants in the public discourse\nthat underlies justice are assumed to have (and provided the basic\nresources for having) capacities for competent self- reflection, can\nthe public defense and discussion of competing conceptions of justice\ntake place (cf. Gaus 1996, Parts II and III, Gaus 2011). Insofar as\nautonomy is necessary for a functioning democracy (considered very\nbroadly), and the latter is a constitutive element of just political\ninstitutions, then autonomy must be seen as reflective self-appraisal\n(and, I would add, non-alienation from central aspects of one’s\nperson) (see Cohen 2002, Richardson 2003, Christman 2015). \nThis approach to justice and autonomy, spelled out here in rough and\ngeneral form, has certainly faced criticism. In particular, those\ntheorists concerned with the multi-dimensional nature of social and\ncultural “difference” have stressed how the conception of\nthe autonomous person assumed in such principles (as well as criteria\nfor rational discourse and public deliberation) is a contestable ideal\nnot internalized by all participants in contemporary political life\n(see, e.g., Brown 1995, Benhabib 1992). Others motivated by\npost-modern considerations concerning the nature of the self,\nrationality, language, and identity, are also suspicious of the manner\nin which the basic concepts operative in liberal theories of justice\n(“autonomy” for example) are understood as fixed,\ntransparent, and without their own political presuppositions (see,\ne.g., Butler 1990; for general discussion see White 1990). \nThese charges are stated here much too generally to give an adequate\nresponse in this context. But the challenge remains for any theory of\njustice which rests on a presumption of the normative centrality of\nautonomy. To be plausible in a variously pluralistic social setting,\none marked by ongoing histories of oppressive practices and\ninstitutions, such a view must avoid the twin evils of forcibly\nimposing a (reasonably) contested value on resistant citizens, on the\none hand, and simply abandoning all normative conceptions of social\norder in favor of open ended struggle for power on the other. The view\nthat individuals ought to be treated as, and given the resources to\nbecome, autonomous in one of the minimal senses outlined here will, I\nsubmit, be a central element in any political view that steers between\nthe Scylla of oppressive forms of perfectionism and the Charybdis of\ninterest-group power politics.","contact.mail":"jpc11@psu.edu","contact.domain":"psu.edu"}]
