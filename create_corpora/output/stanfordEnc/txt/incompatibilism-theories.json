When an\nagent acts freely—when she exercises free will—it is up to\nher whether she does one thing or another on that occasion. A\nplurality of alternatives is open to her, and she determines which she\npursues. When she does, she is an ultimate source or origin of her\naction. So runs a familiar conception of free will.\n\n\nIncompatibilists hold that we act freely in this sense only if\ndeterminism is false. Some say little more about what, besides\nindeterminism, free will requires. And, indeed, the task of providing\nan incompatibilist account is not an easy one. If the truth of\ndeterminism would preclude free will, it is far from obvious how\nindeterminism would help.\n\n\nThe incompatibilist theories that have been offered fall into three\nmain groups, depending on which type of indeterminism (uncaused\nevents, nondeterministically caused events, agent- [or substance-]\ncaused events) they require. Further variations among accounts concern\nwhere in the processes leading to decisions or other actions they\nrequire indeterminism and what other conditions besides indeterminism\nthey require. The first three sections below examine recent versions\nof each of the three main types of incompatibilist view. The fourth\nsection considers the evidence regarding whether in fact there exists\nwhat any of these accounts requires.\n\nSome incompatibilist accounts require neither that a free action be\ncaused by anything nor that it have any internal causal structure.\nSome views of this type require that a free action be uncaused; others\nallow that it may be caused as long as it is not deterministically\ncaused. Since any such account imposes no positive causal requirement\non free action, we may call views of this type\n“noncausal.” \nCarl Ginet (1989, 1990, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2014, and 2016) and\nHugh McCann (1998 and 2012) have set out the most fully developed\nnoncausal theories of free will. Other recent accounts of this type\nare advanced by Stewart Goetz (1988, 1997, and 2000), E. J. Lowe\n(2008: chs. 6–9 and 2013), Storrs McCall (1994: ch. 9), David\nPalmer (2016), and Thomas Pink (2004: chs. 7–8).. \nProponents of noncausal accounts generally hold that each intentional\naction is or begins with a basic mental action. A decision or a choice\nis commonly said to be such a basic action. An overt bodily action,\nsuch as raising one's arm, is held to be a nonbasic, complex action\nthat is constituted by a basic mental action's bringing about a\ncertain motion of one's body. The basic action in this case is often\ncalled a volition, which is said to be the agent's willing, trying, or\nendeavoring to move a certain part of her body in a certain way. \nBasic actions are said to be intrinsically active doings and to have\nan intrinsic purposiveness or intentionality. According to McCann\n(1998: 163–64), when one makes a decision, intrinsic to the\ndecision is one's intending to make that very decision. (For example,\nwhen one decides to A, one intends to decide to A.)\nOne's so intending is not a matter of the content of the intention\nthat is formed in deciding, nor is it a matter of one's having any\nfurther intention in addition to the one formed in making the\ndecision. Rather, McCann holds, it is a matter of a decision's being,\nby its very nature, an act that one means to be performing. Ginet\nemphasizes what he calls the “actish phenomenal quality”\nof basic actions, which he describes (1990: 13) as its seeming to the\nagent as if she is directly producing, making happen, or determining\nthe event that has this quality. \nAs is characteristic of proponents of noncausal accounts, neither\nGinet nor McCann places any additional positive requirements on free\naction; the further requirements are instead that certain conditions\nbe absent. Both require that the action not be causally determined; as\nGinet sees it, a free action must be entirely uncaused. Ginet\nrequires, further, that in performing the action, the agent not be\nsubject to irresistible compulsion. \nTwo main problems arise for noncausal accounts of free will; both are\nproblems, in the first instance, for noncausal accounts of intentional\naction. The first concerns control. Performing an action—even\nacting unfreely—is exercising active control over what one does;\nacting freely is exercising an especially valuable variety of such\ncontrol. An account of free will ought to say what this latter variety\nof control is or in what its exercise consists. A common objection is\nthat noncausal accounts fail to meet this requirement. \nThe second (and related) problem concerns acting for a reason.\nIntentional actions can be (and commonly are) things done for reasons.\nAn action performed for a reason is something for which there is a\ntrue reason-explanation. Again, it is often objected that noncausal\ntheories of action and free will cannot provide an adequate account of\nthis phenomenon. \nA further challenge may be raised to the requirement (on some\nnon-causal theories) that free actions be entirely uncaused.\nIncompatibilists often contend that determinism precludes the\nalternative possibilities or the ultimate sourcehood that (they\nallege) is required for free will. But an action's being\nnon-deterministically caused, it has been argued, is consistent with\nthese requirements being satisfied. If so, it is unclear why free\nactions must be completely uncaused (Capes forthcoming). \nAccounts of active control often appeal to causation. An agent's\nexercising such control when she acts, it is said, consists in her\ncausing some event (her action, or an event internal to that action).\nIt might be further held that this causation by the agent consists\nentirely in causation by mental events or states of certain kinds,\nsuch as the agent's desiring, believing, or intending something in\nparticular. Of course, noncausal theories reject any such view; let us\nconsider the alternatives. \nOn Ginet's view, each basic action is characterized by an actish\nphenomenal quality, its seeming to the agent as if she is directly\nmaking happen the event that is her basic action. Ginet stresses the\n“as if” nature of this appearance; it does not, he says,\nliterally represent to the agent that she is causing the event in\nquestion. And in fact, he holds, it cannot be true that we really are\nagent-causes of what we do, and it need not be the case that any\nevents involving us cause our actions.  \nMight the actish feel of some occurrence itself constitute that\nevent's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control? Can an\nevent's seeming to oneself to be one's performing an action suffice\nfor its being so? This seems doubtful. As Ginet (1990: 9) allows, an\nevent with the indicated intrinsic quality might be brought about by\ndirect stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant\ndesire or intention on the part of that person. An occurrence produced\nin this way and in these circumstances would hardly seem to be an\nexercise of the subject's agency. \nMcCann (1998: 180) holds that an agent's exercise of active control\nhas two aspects: any basic action is a spontaneous, creative\nundertaking on the part of the agent, and it is intrinsically\nintentional. Again, the intentionality of a basic action is said not\nto require any internal causal structure or external causal relation.\nIt may be doubted that something's being done intentionally can be\naltogether divorced in this way from causation. Further, supposing\nthat such intrinsic intentionality is possible, it would seem possible\nfor an event with this feature to be brought about in the manner and\nin roughly the circumstances (in the absence of any relevant desire or\nprior intention) just considered in discussing Ginet's view.\nAgain, such an occurrence, even if intrinsically something the\nindividual undergoing which means to be an exercise of agency, hardly\nseems to be that. \nThe other aspect of the control that is said to be exercised in basic\naction—the spontaneity or activeness of such an\noccurrence—thus appears to be the crucial one. This aspect, too,\nMcCann holds, is intrinsic to basic actions, and he maintains that\n“it has a certain sui generis character that renders it\nincapable of being reduced to anything else” (1998: 185). \nOther proponents of noncausal theories of intentional action (e.g.,\nPink 2004: ch. 8) likewise take the exercise of active control to be\nan ontologically fundamental or irreducible thing. Whether it could be\nis perhaps best addressed by considering the phenomenon of acting for\na reason. For active control is typically exercised in response to\nreasons for action. \nAgain, accounts of acting for a reason and of reason-explanation often\nappeal to causation. An agent acts for a certain reason, it is said,\nonly if the agent's recognizing that reason causes, in an appropriate\nway, the agent's behavior; and citing a reason contributes to a (true)\nreason-explanation of an action only if the agent's recognizing that\nreason caused, in an appropriate way, the action. Proponents of\nnoncausal theories generally go for one or another of two\nalternatives, appealing either to the content of an intention that the\nagent is said to have concurrently with performing the action in\nquestion, or to the intentional content of the action itself. \nTo examine the first of these strategies, suppose that S\nwants her glasses, which she has left in her friend T's room,\nwhere he is now sleeping. S also wants to wake T,\nbecause she desires his company, but she knows that T needs\nsome sleep, and hence she desires, too, not to wake him. S\ndecides to enter T's room and does so, believing as she does\nthat her action will contribute to the satisfaction of both the desire\nto get her glasses and the desire to wake T. (The example is\nadapted from Ginet 1990: 145.) What further facts about the situation\ncould make it the case that, in entering the room, S acts on\nher desire to get her glasses, and that citing that desire provides a\ntrue reason-explanation of her action, while she does not act on her\ndesire to wake T, and citing this latter desire does not give\nus a true reason-explanation of what she is doing? \nGinet's account of reason-explanations that cite antecedent desires\n(1990: 143) implies that the following conditions suffice for the\ntruth of the explanation that cites S's desire to get her\nglasses: \n(b) concurrently with entering the room, S remembers that\nprior desire and intends of her entering the room that it satisfy (or\ncontribute to satisfying) that desire. \nGiven the indicated circumstances, citing S's desire to wake\nT will fail to give us a true reason-explanation, Ginet\nholds, just in case S does not intend of her action that it\nsatisfy (or contribute to satisfying) that desire. \nSeveral objections may be raised against this account. Suppose that,\nalthough conditions (a) and (b) are fulfilled as S enters the\nroom, her desire to get her glasses plays no role at all in bringing\nabout (causing) her entry, while her desire to wake T, of\nwhich she is fully aware when she acts, does play such a role.\nCausalists (e.g., Mele 1992: ch. 13) will then deny that S\nreally acts on her desire to get her glasses and that citing it truly\nexplains her action. Indeed, even some noncausalists deny that having\na concurrent intention of the sort required by Ginet (together with\nawareness of the antecedent desire) suffices for acting for the reason\nin question. As McCann (1998: 163) suggests, one might have such an\nintention but fail to carry it out. An account that requires a\nconcurrent intention of this sort, then, will need to provide for its\nimplementation. \nFurther problems attend the concurrent intention that is required.\nFirst, the required intention is a second-order attitude, an attitude\nabout (among other things) another of the agent's own attitudes (a\ncertain desire of hers). But it seems that S might act on her\ndesire to get her glasses even if her only intention when she enters\nthe room is to retrieve her glasses. Second, intention-acquisitions\nthemselves can be explained by citing reasons. Since Ginet's account\nof the reason-explanation of an action appeals to an intention, the\nquestion arises what can be said about the reason-explanation of the\nacquisition of that intention. Repeating the same sort of account here\nwould generate a regress. \nMcCann (1998: ch. 8 and 2012) takes a different approach. On his view,\nan agent decides for a certain reason, and citing that reason explains\nthe decision, just in case, in cognizance of that reason, and in an\nintrinsically intentional act of intention formation, the agent forms\nan intention the content of which reflects the very goals presented in\nthat reason. When S decides to enter T's room, for\nexample, she decides for the reason of getting her glasses only if the\nintention that she forms in making that decision is an intention to\nenter for the sake of getting her glasses. (Ginet [2008] offers a\nsimilar account of reasons-explanations of decisions.) \nHere, again, there will be a clash of intuitions between causalists\nand noncausalists, with the former maintaining that if S's\ndesire to get her glasses plays no role at all in bringing about her\ndecision, then even if the content of her decision is to enter for the\nsake of getting her glasses, she does not really decide for that\nreason and citing it does not truly explain her decision. One does\nnot, the objection goes, make it so just by intending it to be so, not\neven by intrinsically intentionally intending it to be so. \nFurther, the proposed account threatens a regress. Suppose that an\nagent decides to A. Presumably the decision is made for some\nreason; let us say that it is made for reason R1. On the\naccount under consideration, the decision is not simply a decision to\nA; it is a decision to A for R1. But,\npresumably, the decision to A for R1 is made for a\nreason. Let us say that it is made for reason R2. Then, on\nthe account under consideration, the decision that is made is a\ndecision to A for R1 for R2. And presumably\nthis decision is made for a reason. And so on. \nIn fact, the required correspondence between the reasons for which one\ndecides and the content of one's decision may be thought\nunnecessary. Sometimes prior to making a decision, an agent\nconsiders a large number and variety of factors. Her decision might\nthen be made for many different reasons. It is implausible that each\nand every one of the reasons for which she makes her decision must\nenter into the content of the intention that she forms in making that\ndecision. (For the same objection to a similar account of\nreason-explanation, see Mele 2003: 42–43.) \nWe have considered problems for noncausal accounts of action.\nHowever, since the noncausal views examined here place no positive\nrequirements on free action beyond those that are placed on\naction, if they fail as adequate accounts of action, then a\nfortiori they fail as adequate accounts of free action. \nSome proponents of non-causal theories insist that free actions not\nonly may but must be entirely uncaused. One argument\nadvanced for this claim is an argument from luck. The idea, in brief,\nis that if an action is caused (even nondeterministically) by prior\nevents, then it cannot have been up to the agent whether that action\nwas performed. If the causation is nondeterministic, it will simply be\na matter of luck, a matter of nature's “role of the dice”\n(Ginet 2014: 24) whether the action occurs. \nSuch an argument from luck poses a problem for event-causal\nlibertarian theories, and agent-causal libertarian theories face a\nsimilar problem. We shall discuss responses available in defense of\nthese theories below, in sections 2.3, 2.4, and 3.2. \nCompatibilist accounts of free action are typically event-causal\nviews, invoking event-causal accounts of action. The simplest\nevent-causal incompatibilist theory takes the requirements of a good\ncompatibilist account and adds that certain agent-involving events\nthat cause the action must nondeterministically cause it. When these\nconditions are satisfied, it is held, the agent exercises in\nperforming her action a certain variety of active control (which is\nsaid to consist in the action's being caused, in an appropriate way,\nby those agent-involving events), the action is performed for a\nreason, and there remains, until she acts, a chance of the agent's not\nperforming that action. (It might be required that there remains,\nuntil the action is performed, a chance that the agent will perform a\ndifferent action instead right then.) It is thus said to be open to\nthe agent to do otherwise, even given that (it is claimed) its being\nso open is incompatible with the truth of determinism. \nOne common objection against such a view is that the indeterminism\nthat it requires is destructive, that it would diminish the control\nwith which an agent acts to the extent that responsibility would be\nundermined. A second common objection is that the required\nindeterminism is superfluous, that it adds nothing of value that could\nnot exist in a deterministic world. We shall examine these objections\nbelow. First, let us consider a type of event-causal incompatibilist\naccount that is advocated by writers who accept a qualified version of\nthe first of these objections. \nSome writers accept that indeterminism located in the immediate\ncausation of a decision or other action would diminish the agent's\ncontrol but hold that indeterminism confined to earlier stages in the\nprocess leading to a decision need not do so. Laura Ekstrom (2000: ch.\n4 and 2003) and Alfred Mele (1995: ch. 12, 1996, 1999b, and 2006:\n9–14) have advanced the most fully developed accounts of this\nsort. Such views have also been sketched by Daniel Dennett (1978) and\nJohn Martin Fischer (1995). \nOvert action is sometimes preceded by a decision, and decision is\nsometimes preceded by a deliberative process in which the agent\nconsiders reasons for and against alternatives and makes an evaluative\njudgment concerning which alternative is best (or better or good\nenough). Focusing on decisions that follow such deliberation, Mele\nadvances a view that allows (but does not require) the deterministic\ncausation of the decision by the making of the judgment, and of the\novert action by the decision. Indeterminism is required only at an\nearlier stage of the deliberative process. For example, the account is\nsatisfied when it is undetermined which of a certain subset of the\nagent's nonoccurrent beliefs come to mind in the process of\ndeliberation, where their coming to mind combines with other events to\nbring about the agent's evaluative judgment. (The subset in question\nconsists of “beliefs whose coming or not coming to mind is not\nsomething that one would control even if determinism were true”\n[1995: 216].) \nMele argues that indeterminism of the sort required here does not\ndiminish (at least not to any significant extent) what he calls\n“proximal control,” a variety of control constituted by\nthe relatively direct causation of behavior, and one that is\ncompatible with determinism. The required indeterminism nevertheless\nsuffices, he holds, to provide the agent with “ultimate\ncontrol” over her decision, which an agent has only if at no\ntime prior to the decision is there any causally sufficient condition\nfor the agent's making that decision that consists entirely of events\nor states external to the agent. \nEkstrom's account emphasizes preference rather than evaluative\njudgment. A preference, as she understands it, is a desire\n“formed by a process of critical evaluation with respect to\none's conception of the good” (2000: 106). The formation of a\npreference, she maintains, is an action. She requires indeterminism\nonly in the production of these preferences. A decision or other\naction is free, on her view, just in case it is brought about, in an\nappropriate way, by an active formation of a preference (favoring that\ndecision or action), which preference-formation is in turn the result\nof an uncoerced exercise of the agent's evaluative faculty, the inputs\nto which nondeterministically cause that preference-formation. \nEkstrom holds that an agent is her preferences and\nacceptances (reflectively held beliefs), together with her faculty of\nforming these by reflective evaluation. When the formation of a\npreference is nondeterministically caused and it deterministically\ncauses a decision and subsequent action, then a preference that partly\nconstitutes the agent, one that is generated by an evaluative faculty\nthat partly constitutes the agent, and one that the agent could have\nprevented (by not forming that preference) causally determines the\ndecision and subsequent action. What the agent does is then, Ekstrom\nholds, up to her. \nBoth Mele's and Ekstrom's deliberative theories allow that a decision\nor other action can be free even if it is causally determined by\nevents none of which is a free action, and to none of which has the\nagent contributed by performing any prior free action. Indeed, given\nthe basic features of these accounts, both of them must (on pain of\nregress) allow this. Incompatibilists do not typically allow such a\nthing. \nIf an event is not itself a free action, and if no free action by the\nagent in question contributed to that event, then, we may say, it is\nnot up to the agent whether that event occurs. Incompatibilists\ngenerally hold that if one event determines another, then it is not up\nto anybody whether if the first event occurs then the second event\noccurs. And arguments for incompatibilism often employ a principle\nlike the following: if it is not up to a given agent whether a certain\nevent occurs, and it is not up to that agent whether if that event\noccurs then the agent performs a certain action, then it is not up to\nthe agent whether she performs that action. Given this principle, it\nwill have to be said of certain decisions that deliberative theorists\ncount as free that it is not up to us whether we make those decisions.\nDeliberative theorists, then, apparently reject this principle; but\nthe rejection raises the question whether their incompatibilism is\nwell motivated.  \nEvent-causal accounts of a more typical sort require that at least\nsome free actions be nondeterministically caused by their immediate\ncausal antecedents. Since these views require indeterminism centered\non the production of free actions themselves, we may call them\n“centered accounts.” The most widely discussed such view\nis that advanced by Robert Kane (1985, 1989, 1994, 1996a, 1996b,\n1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2002, 2004, 2005: chs. 11–12,\n2007a, 2007b, 2011, 2014a, 2014b, 2016, and forthcoming). (It should\nbe noted that Kane now rejects the event-causal label, insisting the\nthere is no event-causal reduction of agency; however, it is not clear\nthat he denies that agency is always fully realized in causation by\nevents, and his view focuses on causation by events in exercises of\nagency.) Other accounts of this type are proposed by Mark Balaguer\n(1999 and 2004), Laura Ekstrom (forthcoming), Christopher Franklin\n(2011a and 2011b), David Hodgson (2012), Alfred Mele (2006: ch. 5),\nRobert Nozick (1981:294–316), Richard Sorabji (1980: chs. 2 and\n14), Peter van Inwagen (1983: 137–50), and David Wiggins (1973).\nJohn Searle (2001: ch. 9) endorses a view of this sort as best\ncapturing our experience of acting. \nConsider an illustration of a simple centered incompatibilist theory.\nSuppose that Elena is considering whether to A or to\nB. She recognizes what she regards as fairly strong reasons\nto A, and she recognizes what she regards as somewhat weaker\nreasons to B. At a certain time, t, she decides to\nA. The account requires that the prior deliberative events\n(such as Elena's recognizing the reasons to A and judging\nthem to be stronger) that cause the decision to A\nnondeterministically cause it, and that until Elena makes that\ndecision, there remains a chance that she not make that decision then.\n(We may imagine that there remains a chance that, instead, she decides\nat t to B, in which case prior deliberative events,\nsuch as her recognizing the reasons to B, will have\nnondeterministically caused this alternative decision). \nAccounts of this sort are widely thought to be vulnerable to the\nfollowing argument from luck. If a decision is nondeterministically\ncaused, and if there remains until it occurs a chance that the agent\nwill instead (at that moment) make a different decision, then there is\na possible world that is exactly the same as the actual world up until\nthe time of the decision, but in which the agent makes the alternative\ndecision then. There is, then, nothing about the agent prior to the\ndecision—indeed, there is nothing about the world prior\nto that time—that accounts for the difference between her making\none decision and her making the other. This difference, then, is just\na matter of luck. And if the difference between the agent's making one\ndecision and her instead making another is just a matter of luck, she\ncannot be responsible for the decision that she makes. (Arguments of\nthis sort are advanced by Almeida and Bernstein [2003], Ekstrom [2000:\n105], Haji [1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, and 2001], Levy [2011:\nch. 3], and Strawson [1994]. Mele [1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2005, and 2006:\nchs 1 and 5] discusses the argument but rejects its conclusion.) \nSome proponents of centered incompatibilist theories have added to the\nrequirements of the rather simple view we have been considering, with\nthe aim of rebutting this argument. We shall examine here the account\nadvanced by Robert Kane. \nKane holds that a free decision or other free action is one for which\nthe agent is “ultimately responsible” (1996b: 35).\nUltimate responsibility for an action requires either that the action\nnot be causally determined or, if the action is causally determined,\nthat any determining cause of it either be or result (at least in\npart) from some action by that agent that was not causally determined\n(and for which the agent was ultimately responsible). Thus, on Kane's\nview, an agent can be ultimately responsible for a decision that is\ncausally determined by her possessing certain character traits. But\nsomewhere among the events that contributed (however indirectly) to\nher having those traits, and thus to her decision, there must have\nbeen some free actions by her that were not causally determined. Kane\ncalls such “regress-stopping” actions “self-forming\nactions” (74). All self-forming actions, he argues, are acts of\nwill; they are mental actions. He thus calls them “self-forming\nwillings” (125), or SFWs. \nKane identifies six different types of SFW, giving the most detailed\ntreatment to what he calls moral choices or decisions and prudential\nchoices or decisions. We shall focus here on the former; the two are\nsufficiently similar that the points made can be easily transferred to\nthe latter. \nIn a case of moral choice, there is a motivational conflict within the\nagent. She believes that a certain type of thing morally ought to be\ndone (and she is motivated to do that), but she also has a\nself-interested desire to perform an action of a type that is, in the\ncircumstances, incompatible with her doing what she believes she ought\nto do. Given her commitment to her moral belief, she makes an effort\nof will to resist temptation, an effort “to get [her] ends or\npurposes sorted out” (1996b: 126). If the choice is to be an\nSFW, then it is required that the strength of this effort be\nindeterminate; Kane likens its indeterminacy to that of the position\nor momentum of a microphysical particle. And the effort's\nindeterminacy is held to be the source of the required indeterminism\nin the causal production of the choice. Again an analogy is drawn with\nan indeterministic understanding of microphysics. Just as whether a\nparticle will penetrate a barrier might be undetermined because the\nparticle does not have both a determinate position and a determinate\nmomentum, so “[t]he choice one way or the other is\nundetermined because the process preceding and potentially\nterminating in it (i.e., the effort of will to overcome temptation) is\nindeterminate” (128). \nKane further requires that any choice that is an SFW satisfy three\nplurality conditions. These require that the choice be made for a\nreason (which Kane takes to consist partly in the choice's being\ncaused by the agent's recognizing that reason) and that it not be a\nresult of coercion or compulsion. Each plurality condition also\nrequires that, when the agent makes the choice, she wants more to act\non the reason for which she makes that choice than she wants to act on\nany competing reasons. An agent wants more to act on a certain reason,\nhe holds, when her desire to act on that reason has greater\nmotivational strength than have any desires she has to act on\ncompeting reasons, and when it is settled in the agent's mind that\nthat reason, rather than her reasons for doing otherwise, is the one\nthat she will now and in the future act on. This wanting more to act\non a certain reason is, on Kane's view, brought about by the choice in\nquestion. Finally, the plurality conditions require that, whichever\nchoice is made, there must have been at least one alternative choice\nthat the agent was able to make such that, had she made it, it too\nwould have satisfied the previously stated conditions. \nIn a situation of moral conflict, Kane maintains, the requirements for\nbeing an SFW can be satisfied by either choice that is made—the\nchoice to do what one believes one ought to do or the choice to do\nwhat one is tempted to do. Where this is so, whichever choice the\nagent makes, she has chosen for the reason that she wants more to act\non, free from coercion and compulsion. If she has chosen to do what\nshe believes she ought to do, then her choice is the result of her\neffort. If she has chosen to do what she was tempted to do, then she\nhas not allowed her effort to succeed. Whichever choice she has made,\nshe could have made the other. She is then ultimately responsible for\nthe choice she has made. \nWhat, then, of the argument from luck? Kane offers a complex response\nto this problem. First (1996b: 171–72), he counters that with\nindeterminate events, exact sameness is not defined. If an agent's\neffort of will was indeterminate, then it cannot be that in the actual\nworld and in some other possible world she made exactly the same\neffort. An objection that assumes that such exact sameness is\npossible, he holds, does not apply to his view. Kane infers from this\npoint that free will requires a form of indeterminism in which there\nis chance as well as indeterminacy, with the former stemming from the\nlatter. (He calls worlds with such indeterminism\n“non-Epicurean.”) The chance in an Epicurean world (an\nindeterministic world without indeterminacy), he implies, would\nconstitute control-diminishing luck. \nKane's claim that indeterminacy precludes exact sameness has been\ncontested (see Clarke 1999, 2002, 2003a, and 2003b: 86–87, and\nO'Connor 1996). Moreover, Ishtiyaque Haji (1999a) and Alfred Mele\n(1999a and 1999b) contend that the argument from luck is just as\neffective if we consider an agent in worlds that are as similar as can\nbe until the moment of choice, given the indeterminacy of efforts.\nIndeed, the argument might be advanced without any appeal at all to\nother worlds: given that nothing prior to the choice accounts for the\ndifference between the agent's choosing one way and her choosing\nanother, it may be said, this difference is just a matter of luck. \nA further response by Kane to the argument from luck appeals to the\nactive nature of efforts of will. When an agent in a case of moral\nconflict makes an effort to resist temptation, he says, she is trying\nto make the choice to do what she believes she ought to do. If the\nagent then makes that choice, she succeeds, despite the indeterminism,\nat doing what she was actively trying to do. And Kane points out that\ntypically, when someone so succeeds, indeterminism of this sort will\nnot undermine responsibility (and hence it will not so diminish the\nagent's control that there is not enough for responsibility). He\ndescribes a case (1999b: 227) in which a man hits a glass tabletop\nattempting to shatter it. Even if it is undetermined whether his\neffort will succeed, Kane notes, if the man does succeed, he may well\nbe responsible for breaking the tabletop. \nIf left here, the reply would fail to address the problem of luck in a\ncase in which the agent chooses to do what she is tempted to do rather\nthan what she believes she ought to do. In response to this\nshortcoming, Kane (1999a, 1999b, 2000b, 2000c, 2002, 2005: ch. 12,\n2007, and 2011) has proposed a “doubling” of effort in\ncases of moral conflict. In such a case, he holds, the agent makes\ntwo, simultaneous efforts of will, both indeterminate in strength. The\nagent tries to make the moral choice, and at the same time she tries\nto make the self-interested choice. Whichever choice she makes, then,\nshe succeeds, despite the indeterminism, at doing something that she\nwas actively trying to do. \nAlthough it is common to try to make a choice whether to do something\nor not—for example, to try to decide whether to\nA—it is unclear what sense can be made of trying to\nmake some specific choice—e.g., trying to decide to A.\nFurther, supposing that sense can be made of this, it would not seem\nto be rational to try, at one time, to make each of two obviously\nincompatible choices. \nA more fundamental problem concerns the efficacy of the appeal to the\nactive nature of such efforts. In the case of the man who breaks the\ntabletop, his breaking the tabletop is free (if it is) not\njust because it results from an active effort to break the tabletop,\nbut because it results (we are to presume) from a free effort\nto break the tabletop. A successful effort to make a certain choice\ncan contribute in an analogous way to the choice's being free, then,\nonly if the effort itself is free. If the appeal to these efforts is\nto accomplish anything, then, what is needed is an account of the\nfreedom with which the agent acts in making these efforts of will\n(Clarke 2002, 2003a, and 2003b: 89–92; Mele 2006:\n51–52). \nIn recent work, Kane (e.g., at 2007b: 174–75) accepts that\nresponsibility for choices that are SFWs requires that we be\nresponsible for the efforts of will that produce these choices. We\ngenerally are responsible for these efforts, he maintains, because\nthey are influenced by character and motives resulting from our prior\nfree choices, and because we generally endorse the outcome of such an\neffort when it succeeds—the resulting choice. The second of\nthese observations seems not to the point, since one's responsibility\nfor an action cannot depend on whether, subsequent to that action, one\nendorses one of its results. The first observation raises a regress\nproblem: what about an agent's earliest SFWs, in which case no prior\nfree choices have influenced the efforts of will preceding the SFWs?\nKane says that we are responsible for the efforts in these cases as\nwell. But aside from appealing to our endorsement of the resulting\nchoices, he does not explain how this can be so. \nKane's appeal to indeterminate efforts of will, and the appeal thereby\nto non-Epicurean indeterminism, do not appear to help meet the luck\nobjection. (Neither does it appear that help comes from his\nrequirement that, in making a choice that is an SFW, the agent comes\nto want more to act on the reason for which she makes that choice.\nFor, on Kane's view, this wanting more is brought about by the choice.\nAnd if an event-causal view is on the right track, the agent's control\nover the making of the choice is a matter of the production of the\nchoice, not of what the choice produces.) A simpler centered\nincompatibilist account, then, may fare just as well against the\nargument from luck. \nHow might a simpler theory be defended against that argument? Mele\n(2006: 117–33) has responded to it by invoking an agent's\ninfluence, by way of her past actions, on which options are currently\nopen to her and what their respective probabilities are. Given her\nresponsibility for those past actions, the agent might be responsible\nfor the current probabilities of her pursuing these alternatives. For\nexample, Elena might be responsible for the present chance that she\nwill decide contrary to her ranking of her reasons, because she is\nresponsible for past actions that led to her now having\nfeatures—character traits, desires, and so forth—that\nground that chance. An agent might, in this fashion, accumulate over\nthe course of her lifetime greater responsibility for what she does,\nby increasingly shaping the probabilities of her acting in various\nways. \nOf course, the manuever raises a question about how the agent could be\nresponsible for her earlier actions, given that the account in\nquestion will require that some of these, too, were\nnondeterministically caused. Ultimately, we must consider how an agent\ncan be responsible, on such a view, for her earliest free\ndecisions. \nThese earliest free decisions, Mele observes, will be those of a\nrelatively young child. Responsibility comes in degrees, and any\nresponsibility such a child has for what she does will be slight. The\nargument from luck might seem threatening if we think that full\nresponsibility is in question, but it loses its bite, Mele suggests,\nwhen we consider a case in which only a small degree of responsibility\nis at issue. It is implausible, for example, to say that a young boy\nwho decides not to snatch away his sister's toy deserves no credit at\nall for making the right decision, just because there remained until\nhe so decided a chance that he would instead decide to take the toy.\nKane (e.g., at 2007b: 174–75) makes a similar appeal to the\nbuild-up of responsibility stemming from slight responsibility for\none's earliest free choices. \nIf this strategy succeeds in showing that the required indeterminism\nwould not undermine responsibility, it leaves unaddressed the charge\nthat the requirement is superfluous, that it secures nothing of value\nthat could not exist in a deterministic world. And it is hard to see\nhow this charge can be answered. \nRecall Elena's decision. She deliberates about whether to A or\nto B. She recognizes reasons favoring each alternative and\njudges those favoring A-ing to be stronger. She decides to\nA, and prior deliberative events, including her judging the\nreasons for A-ing to be stronger, nondeterministically cause\nher decision. Until she decides to A, there remains a chance\nthat she will instead decide to B (in which case prior\ndeliberative events, including her recognizing reasons favoring that\nalternative, will nondeterministically cause that decision). \nSuppose that, as incompatibilists might hold, had the causes of\nElena's decision determined that outcome, it would not have\nbeen up to Elena whether she decided to A. It is puzzling how\nthe introduction of the required indeterminism can make a difference\nhere, such that now with that indeterminism, it is up to Elena\nwhether she makes this decision. \nOn the view of agency in play here, Elena's decision is an exercise of\nactive control in virtue of being caused by prior mental events, such\nas her recognizing certain reasons. It is an exercise of such control\nwhether these prior events cause it deterministically or\nnondeterministically. Granted, if the causation of the decision is\nundetermined as we are now imagining, then there is (until the\ndecision is made) a chance that different prior mental events will\ncause a different decision. But this indeterministic picture seems to\ngive us just an actual exercise of active control of a sort we could\nhave on a deterministic picture, plus the chance that this same kind\nof control would be exercised differently, in making the alternative\ndecision. If it is not up to Elena on the deterministic picture\nwhether she decides to A, adding just this chance does not seem\nto leave this any more up to her. \nAn event-causal incompatibilist might respond that Elena exercises a\ndifferent kind of active control on the indeterministic picture: she\nexercises plural—in this case, dual—control, a control\nthat can be exercised in either of two different ways, whereas on the\ndeterministic picture the agent's control can be exercised in only one\nway (Kane 1996: 109–11). But the “can” here seems to\nbe just a matter of chance: Elena actually exercises active control\none way, and there remains, until she does, a chance that she will\nexercise such control a different way. The required indeterminism does\nnot seem to render it any more up to her whether she exercises that\ncontrol one way or exercises it the other. \nA similar doubt arises concerning moral responsibility. The causes of\nthe decision on this indeterministic picture are the same things that\nmight be said to cause it on a deterministic picture. The difference\nis just that although, on the deterministic picture, these prior\nmental events deterministically cause the decision, now we are to\nsuppose that they cause it but there was a chance that other mental\nantecedents would cause a different decision instead. How is this\nsupposed to make a difference to whether the agent can be morally\nresponsible for making the decision? \nIf the required indeterminism does not hurt, it is not clear that it\nhelps, either. \nA number of incompatibilists have maintained that a free decision (or\nsome event internal to such a decision) must be caused by the agent,\nand it must not be the case that either what the agent causes or the\nagent's causing that event is causally determined by prior events. On\nwhat are called agent-causal views, causation by an agent is held not\nto consist in causation by events (such as the agent's recognizing\ncertain reasons). An agent, it is said, is a persisting substance;\ncausation by an agent is causation by such a substance. Since a\nsubstance is not the kind of thing that can itself be an effect\n(though various events involving it can be), on these accounts an\nagent is in a strict and literal sense an originator of her free\ndecisions, an uncaused cause of them. This combination of\nindeterminism and origination is thought to capture best the idea\nthat, when we act freely, a plurality of alternatives is open to us\nand we determine, ourselves, which of these we pursue, and to secure\nthe kind of freedom needed for moral responsibility. \nGeorge Berkeley ([1710] 1998) and Thomas Reid ([1788] 1969) held views\nof this type in the early modern period. In recent years, agent-causal\naccounts have been advanced by Roderick Chisholm (1966, 1971, 1976a,\n1976b, and 1978), Randolph Clarke (1993 and 1996), Alan Donagan\n(1987), Meghan Griffith (2005, 2007, and 2010), Jonathan Jacobs and\nTimothy O'Connor (2013), T. J. Mawson (2011), Timothy O'Connor (1995,\n1996, 2000a, 2000b, 2002, 2005, 2009a and 2009b), William Rowe (1991,\n2000, 2003, and 2006), Helen Steward (2012), Richard Taylor (1966 and\n1992), John Thorp (1980), and Michael Zimmerman (1984). Derk Pereboom\n(2001, 2004, 2007, and 2014) has argued that only if we are\nagent-causes can we have free will, but that the evidence is against\nthe existence of agent causaton. \nSetting aside (for the moment) the question of evidence, agent-causal\ntheories face three main problems. One concerns acting freely for a\nreason and the reason-explanation of free actions; the second is the\nproblem of luck; the last concerns the intelligibility of the notion\nof agent causation and whether causation by an agent (where this is\nunderstood to be causation by a substance) is possible. \nWe saw in section 1.2 that difficulties confront accounts of acting\nfor a reason and of reason-explanation that do not appeal to the\ncausation of action by the agent's recognizing certain reasons.\nStandard agent-causal views deny that events such as the agent's\nrecognizing certain reasons cause any free action (or whatever event\nthe agent directly causes when she acts freely). Such views must,\nthen, offer some alternative account of the phenomenon in\nquestion. \nThe most sophisticated such proposal is that advanced by Timothy\nO'Connor (2000b: ch. 5). At the core of the proposal is an account of\nthe reason-explanation of free decisions. As O'Connor sees it, agents\ndo not cause free decisions; rather, a free decision is a causally\ncomplex event, consisting of the agent's causing her coming to have a\ncertain intention. (Such a causally complex event is, in turn, a\ncomponent of any free overt action, such as one's freely raising one's\narm.) \nSuppose, then, that someone freely decides to A right now.\nThe decision can be explained by citing an antecedent desire, O'Connor\nmaintains, if \n(a) prior to making that decision, the agent had the desire in\nquestion and believed that A-ing would satisfy (or contribute\nto satisfying) that desire; and  \n(b) the intention to A that the agent comes to have in making\nthe decision is caused by the agent and is an intention to A\nhere and now in order to satisfy the desire in question (adapted from\nO'Connor 2000b: 86). \nOne objection to such a view (raised by Feldman and Buckareff [2003])\nis that it appeals to something that is not necessary for the truth of\nthe kind of explanation we are considering. One can decide on the\nbasis of a certain desire, and citing that desire can yield a true\nreason-explanation of one's decision, even if the intention that one\nforms in deciding is not a second-order attitude, an attitude that is\nabout (in part) another of one's attitudes (a certain desire).\nO'Connor might accept this point and propose that we will have a true\nreason-explanation as well if the intention that is acquired\nrepresents, not the desire in question, but rather the object of that\ndesire. The proposal would then resemble McCann's account of\nreason-explanation. However, it might be objected that one can decide\non the basis of a desire even if the intention that one forms in\nmaking that decision does not represent, in its content, the object of\nthat desire. As was observed in examining McCann's view, an agent\nsometimes makes a decision for many reasons, and it is implausible\nthat each and every one of the reasons for which a decision is made\nmust enter into the content of that decision. \nA further objection is that O'Connor's account of reason-explanation\ncommits him to an implausible view of the explanation of causally\ncomplex events. As he has it, whether an explanation citing a state of\nan agent truly explains the agent's causing her acquisition of a\ncertain intention depends crucially on whether the effect component of\nthis causally complex event has a certain feature, and the truth of\nthe explanation does not require that the agent's being in the cited\nstate cause either the causally complex event, the cause component of\nthat event, or the effect component of that event. But we do not find\nthis sort of thing to be so in cases of any other kinds of causally\ncomplex event. \nConsider a case that is in important respects analogous to what we are\nexamining here. Suppose that a flash of lightning has caused a brush\nfire. A drought, let us say, had left the brush dry, and had this not\nbeen so, the lightning flash would not have caused the fire, or at\nleast would have been less likely to do so. Now suppose that the\ndryness of the brush is cited as an explanation of the flash's causing\nthe fire. Does the truth of the proffered explanation hinge on whether\nthe fire has a certain feature, and can the explanation be true even\nif the brush's being dry did not cause either the flash, the fire, or\nthe flash's causing the fire? Apparently not. \nThe difficulty here stems from O'Connor's requirement, like that\nimposed by most proponents of agent-causal views, that only the agent\ncause what is directly agent-caused in a free action. On an\nalternative account, it is required that a free action be caused by\nthe agent and nondeterministically caused by certain\nagent-involving events, such as the agent's recognizing certain\nreasons and having a certain intention. Such a view, it is said, can\nprovide the same accounts of acting for a reason and of\nreason-explanation as can event-causal theories of free will. And\nsince the event causation that is posited is required to be\nnondeterministic, the view secures the openness of alternatives, even\non the assumption that this openness is incompatible with determinism.\nFinally, the required agent causation itself is still held to be\ndistinct from causation by any events, and so this view may be said to\nsecure the origination of free actions that seemed an appealing\nfeature of standard agent-causal accounts (Clarke 1993, 1996, 2003b:\nch. 8, and 2011; Mawson [2011: ch. 5] and Steward [2012:\n217–219] also allow that events can play a [nondeterministic]\ncausal role in the production of free actions in additional to the\ncausal role played by the agent). \nHere is a brief illustration of a freely made decision, as this type\nof view would have it. Suppose that on some occasion a certain\nindividual, Leo, is deliberating about whether to tell the truth or to\nlie. He recognizes reasons favoring each alternative and has an\nintention to make up his mind now. Suppose that there is a nonzero\nprobability that Leo's recognizing the reasons favoring telling the\ntruth (together with his having the indicated intention) will\nnondeterministically cause his deciding to tell the truth; and suppose\nthat there is, as well, a nonzero probability that his recognizing the\nreasons favoring lying (together with his having the intention) will\ninstead nondeterministically cause his deciding to lie. Then, given\nall prior conditions, it is open to Leo to make the former decision\nand open to him to make the latter one instead. Now suppose that, as a\nmatter of nomological necessity, in the circumstances, whichever of\nthe open decisions Leo makes, that decision will be made, and it will\nbe caused by his recognizing the reasons that favor it, only if\nLeo—the agent—causes that decision. Finally, suppose that,\nin fact, Leo decides to tell the truth. His decision is caused by him,\nand it is nondeterministically caused by his recognizing reasons\nfavoring the action decided upon (and his having the intention to make\nup his mind). He would make that decision only if he caused it. On\nthis view, Leo's exercising control over which decision he\nmakes—his determining which of the open decisions he\nmakes—consists in his decision's being (appropriately) caused by\nhim and by these mental events involving him. \nIt is a matter of some dispute whether event causation and agent\ncausation can be combined in this fashion and, if they can be, whether\nthe combination would provide what incompatibilists think necessary\nfor free will. (For discussion of these points, see Clarke 2003b:\n144–48 and 2011; Ginet 2002; O'Connor 2000b: 76–70; and\nO'Connor and Churchill 2004.) \nWhile the appeal to agent causation might be thought to solve the\nproblem of luck, the objection has been raised that in fact it does\nnot help at all (Haji 2004; Mele 2005 and 2006: ch. 3; van Inwagen\n1983: 145 and 2000). Consider Leo. At a certain moment he agent-causes\na decision to tell the truth, and until he does there remains a chance\nthat he will instead, at that moment, agent-cause a decision to lie.\nThere is, then, a possible world that is exactly like the actual world\nup until the time at which Leo agent-causes his decision but in which,\nat that moment, Leo agent-causes a decision to lie. Nothing about the\nworld prior to the moment of the agent-causing accounts for the\ndifference between Leo's causing one decision and his causing the\nother. This difference, then, is just a matter of luck. And if this\ndifference is just a matter of luck, Leo cannot be responsible for his\ndecision. \nIf in fact Leo's causing his decision constitutes his exercising free\nwill, then the difference between his causing a decision to tell the\ntruth and his causing a decision to lie is not just a matter\nof luck; it is a matter of how Leo exercises his free will. But what\ncan be said to support the claim that an agent's causing a decision is\nhis exercising free will? Recall the familiar conception of free will\nwith which we began. When one exercises free will, it is up to oneself\nwhether one does one thing or another. A plurality of alternatives is\nopen to one, and one determines, oneself, which alternative one\npursues. When one does, one is an ultimate source or origin of one's\naction. An agent-causal account may be said to nicely realize this\nfamiliar conception of free will. On the assumption that\nincompatibilism is correct, the account's requirement of indeterminism\nis needed to secure the openness of alternatives. And its requirement\nof agent causation may be thought to secure the agent's determining,\nherself, which alternative she pursues, as well as her originating her\naction. (Unlike what we have with any event-causal view, with an\nagent-causal account, the agent is quite literally an ultimate source\nor origin of her action.) If the account satisfactorily realizes this\nfamiliar conception, then it may be credibly claimed that the\ndifference in question between worlds is a matter of Leo's exercising\nhis free will differently. \nAll theorists who accept a causal construal of agents' control over\nwhat they do—and this includes most compatibilists as well as\nmany incompatibilists—can accept that agents cause their free\nactions (or events internal to these actions). After all, we accept\nthat the sun causes sunburn and that, when water dissolves sugar, it\ncauses the sugar to dissolve. However, it is widely thought that\ncausation by such things is reducible to, or consists wholly in,\ncausation by states of these things or events involving them, and this\nis precisely what is denied with respect to the agent causation that\nis invoked by agent-causal theories of free will. The denial raises\nthe question whether any intelligible account of agent causation can\nbe given. Even some proponents of agent-causal views (e.g., Taylor\n1992: 53) seem doubtful about this, declaring agent causation to be\nstrange or even mysterious. \nSuch doubts may be viewed in light of the widely held presumption\nthat, free will (or perhaps, more broadly, purposive agency) aside,\ncausation throughout nature is, fundamentally, causation by events or\nstates. Until recently, even most proponents of agent-causal theories\nhave accepted this view. And with this view granted, an appeal to\nagent causation in a theory of free will may strike us an implausible\nclaim of metaphysical exceptionalism. \nHowever, in the last couple of decades, a growing number of\nphilosophers have argued that causation by substances is ontologically\nfundamental. Some (e.g., Jacobs and O'Connor 2013; Lowe 2008: 143-46;\nO'Connor 2014; and Swinburne 1997 and 2006) hold that, fundamentally,\nall causation is substance causation. Others (e.g., Alvarez\nand Hyman 1998; Hyman 2015: 40-42; Mayr 2011: 229-30; and Steward\n2012: 207-16) advance causal pluralism, on which entities of a variety\nof different categories—the list includes substances, events,\nproperties, features, aspects, and facts—cause things, and\ncausation by each of these kinds of thing is equally fundamental. The\npluralist picture is not one of competition but of interdependence; as\nit may be put, events cause things only when the substances in which\nthese events are changes cause those things, and substances cause\nthings only when changes in those substances cause those things.\n(Hyman [2015: 41] suggests a similar view.) \nOften such views are advanced on grounds that are entirely independent\nof free will or purposive agency, having to do with the nature of\ncausation and causal powers generally. Substance causation that is\nontologically fundamental is held to be pervasive, constituting the\nactivity of substances animate and inanimate, macro and micro.\nRejection of the view that causation by events or states is uniquely\nfundamental often stems from a turn away from of a broadly Humean\naccount of causation toward a neo-Aristotelian view, one that takes\ncausal powers to be irreducible features of the world. \nIn the context of a view of this kind, an appeal to causation by\nagents that is ontologically fundamental is no claim of metaphysical\nexceptionalism. Further, on a causal pluralist view, an agent-causal\ntheorist can help herself to an understanding of acting for a reason\nin terms of causation by one's recognition of reasons. For it may be\nsaid that a free action is caused by the agent and caused by\ncertain states of the agent, with causation by each of these things\ninterdependent and equally fundamental. The verdict on such a view\nhinges on the tenability of its general account of causation. \nAt the same time, if the activity of every substance—an\nelectron, an oak tree—consists in fundamental substance\ncausation, the worry arises whether agent causation can provide what\nfree-will theorists who appeal to it have thought it could provide:\norigination, and the agent's determining, herself, which of several\nopen alternatives she pursues. After all, on the view in question, an\nelectron, too, may be an undetermined determinant of what it does. \nOur assessment of incompatibilist accounts has focused so far on\nwhether they satisfactorily characterize what free will would be, if\nthere is such a thing. However, even if one or another of these views\ncharacterizes well the freedom that we value, the question remains\nwhether there is good evidence that what is posited by that account\nactually exists.  \nIncompatibilist accounts require, first, that determinism be false.\nBut more than this, they require that there be indeterminism of a\ncertain sort (e.g., with some events entirely uncaused, or\nnondeterministically caused, or caused by agents and not\ndeterministically caused by events) and that this indeterminism be\nlocated in specific places (generally, in the occurrence of decisions\nand other actions). What is our evidence with regard to these\nrequirements' being satisfied? \nIt is sometimes claimed (e.g., by Campbell 1957: 168–70 and\nO'Connor 1995: 196–97) that our experience when we make\ndecisions and act constitutes evidence that there is indeterminism of\nthe required sort in the required place. We can distinguish two parts\nof this claim: one, that in deciding and acting, things appear to us\nto be the way that one or another incompatibilist account says they\nare, and two, that this appearance is evidence that things are in fact\nthat way. Some writers (e.g., Mele 1995: 135–37) deny the first\npart. But even if this first part is correct, the second part seems\ndubious. If things are to be the way they are said to be by some\nlibertarian account, then the laws of nature—laws of physics,\nchemistry, and biology—must be a certain way. (This is so for\novert, bodily actions regardless of the relation between mind and\nbody, and it is so for decisions and other mental actions barring a\ncomplete independence of mental events from physical, chemical, and\nbiological events.) And many find it incredible that how things seem\nto us when we act gives us insight into the laws of nature. \nThe scientific evidence for quantum mechanics is sometimes said to\nshow that determinism is false. Quantum theory is indeed very well\nconfirmed. However, there is nothing approaching a consensus on how to\ninterpret it, on what it shows us with respect to how things are in\nthe world. Indeterministic as well as deterministic interpretations\nhave been developed, but it is far from clear whether any of the\nexisting interpretations is correct. Perhaps the best that can be said\nhere is that there is currently no good evidence that determinism is\ntrue. \nThe evidence is even less decisive with respect to whether there is\nthe kind of indeterminism located in exactly the places required by\none or another incompatibilist account. Unless there is a complete\nindependence of mental events from physical events, then even for free\ndecisions there has to be indeterminism of a specific sort at specific\njunctures in certain brain processes. There are some interesting\nspeculations in the works of some incompatibilists about how this\nmight be so (see, e.g., Kane 1996b: 128–30, 137–42, and\nthe sources cited there); but our current understanding of the brain\ngives us little evidence one way or the other about whether it is in\nfact so. At best, it seems we must remain, for the time being,\nagnostic about this matter. \nIf free will requires agent causation that is ontologically\nfundamental, then the metaphysics of causation would seem to be our\nbest guide to whether this requirement is met. It is sometimes argued,\nfurther, that the required agent causation must be anomic, not subject\nto any laws of nature, and that on our best evidence this requirement\nis not met (Pereboom 2001: ch. 3 and 2014: 65-69). However, claim that\nfree will requires such lawlessness is contested (Clarke 2010). \nSome incompatibilists (e.g., van Inwagen 1983: 204–13) hold\nthat, although we lack good evidence that we have free will, we\nnevertheless have good reason to believe that we have it. We have good\nreason to believe that we are morally responsible, it is said, and\nthat moral responsibility requires free will. However, lacking good\nevidence for the required indeterminism, if we justifiably believe\nthat responsibility requires free will and free will requires\nindeterminism, then we have a good reason not to treat each other as\nmorally responsible. For if indeterminism of a certain sort and in a\ncertain location is required for responsibility and we lack evidence\nfor the required indeterminism, then we risk injustice whenever we\ntreat someone as responsible.","contact.mail":"justincapes@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
