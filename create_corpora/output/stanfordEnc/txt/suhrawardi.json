Since none of his works was translated into Latin, he\nremained unknown in the West. However, a number of philosophical\ncircles in the Islamic East studied his works from the 13th\ncentury onwards. Around the mid-20th century, Henry Corbin\nworked relentlessly to edit and publish Suhrawardi’s works,\nefforts that generated much interest in his novel philosophical\nsystem, which a new generation of scholars rekindled in the 1990s.\n\n\nSuhrawardi provides an original Platonic critique of the dominant\nAvicennan Peripateticism of the time in the fields of logic, physics,\nepistemology, psychology, and metaphysics. In so doing, he elaborates\nhis own epistemological (logic and psychology) and metaphysical\n(ontology and cosmology) ishraqi notions, concepts and\ntheories. He divided logic into three-parts, rejecting\nAvicenna’s Peripatetic essentialist definition, and reducing the\nnumber of forms of the syllogism. In physics, he rejected\nAvicenna’s hylomorphism, while bodies became magnitude with\naccidents.\n\n\nHis new epistemological perspective led him to critique the Avicennan\nPeripatetic theory of definition, to introduce a theory of\n‘presential’ knowledge (mirroring mystical intuition), to\nelaborate a complex ontology of lights, and to add a fourth\nontological ‘world of images’ where imagination plays an\ninnovative eschatological function, expanding on insightful allusions\nmade by Avicenna. \n\nBiographical data on the life of Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi, the\n‘Master of Illumination’ (shaykh al-ishraq), is\nscarce. Born in the northwestern Iranian village of Suhraward around\n1154, he pursued his education in nearby Maraghah with Majd al-Din\nal-Jili, one of the teachers of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210). He then\ntraveled to Isfahan, where he studied with the logician Zahir (al-Din)\nal-Farisi (or Qari) with whom he read the Nasiri\nObservations, a text on logic penned by ‘Umar Ibn Sahlan\nal-Sawi (or Sawaji) (d.ca.1158). Suhrawardi then embarked on a journey\nin search of knowledge. According to Shams al-Din al-Shahrazuri\n(d.ca.1288), he would have traveled extensively throughout Anatolia\nand befriended Sufi masters, such as Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini (d.1198)\n(who also taught medicine and Avicennan works), seemingly seeking\nspiritual guidance and experiences, Suhrawardi leading himself the\nlife of a wondering ascetic (retreats, ascetic practices) (Shahrazuri,\n1988). The putative classical Sufi spiritual lineage put forward by\nbiographers and Suhrawardi himself partake of Suhrawardi’s\nclaims to revive the intellectual heritage of a long intitiatic chain\nof transmitters who possessed ‘true’ knowledge, that of\nthe Ancients (Husrawaniyyun) (Landolt, 2008, 240–242).\nLike most scholars of the time, Suhrawardi was also seeking patrons\nduring his travels among the local Anatolian rulers. \nIn 1183, Suhrawardi arrived in Aleppo, the year the Ayyubid ruler,\nSaladin (d.1193), conquered the city and handed it over to his son\nal-Zahir (d.1216). A Shafi‘i Sunni, Suhrawardi made a name for\nhimself among the religious scholars of the city (Marcotte, 2001,\n399–400). He eventually managed to secure an audience at the\npalace, and to befriend al-Zahir. In 1186, he completed his most\nimportant work, the Philosophy of Illumination (hereafter\n PI),[1]\n at the age of thirty-three. Sometime in 1189 or soon therafter,\n‘Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi met Suhrawardi in Aleppo, probably\nafter having come across Suhrawardi’s Intimations,\nFlashes of Light (al-Lamahat) and Ascending\nSteps (al-Ma‘arij) while in Mosul, works he did\nnot find useful, most probably because Suhrawardi (that\n‘imbecile’) had rejected foundamental elements of\nPeripateticism of which he was fond (Martini Bonadeo, 2015, 2013,\n124–125). And there is a possibly apcryphal meeting Suhrawardi\nhad with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (Nasr and Aminrazavi, 2010, 185).  \nA combination of religious and political factors led to\nSuhrawardi’s downfall, namely the fact that he succeeded in\nalienating the powerful religious elite of Aleppo, on whom the\nAyyubids depended for the legitimacy of their rule over the city, by\nalways gaining the upper hand when he debated with the learned of the\ncity, none of whom were able to keep up intellectually with him, and\nseemingly behaving in such a manner as to display a condescending\narrogance for the scholars of Aleppo (Marcotte, 2001, 400–401).\nOn the one hand, he was accused of holding heretical beliefs, a vague\ncharge easily supported with the pre-Islamic Persian names and symbols\nthat some of his works contained, his claim to divine-like\ninspiration, and his questioning, in light of God’s omnipotence,\nthe logical finality of Prophethood. On the other hand, his\nassociation with al-Zahir, the Ayyubid ruler, and his earlier\nrelationships with the recently conquered Artuqids, one of the local\nrulers of southwest Anatolia to whom his Tablets to\n‘Imad (written in Aleppo) was dedicated, may have been\ninterpreted as political intrigue or, at worst, holding Isma‘ili\nviews: Suhrawardi’s views regarding the ‘Caliph of God on\nEarth’; the hierarchical conception of being structured around\nthe ‘victorial domination (qahr)’ relation of\n‘irridiations’ (shuruq) of light in terms similar\nto the Arabic ‘Empedoclean’ views found in the works of\nSijistani (d. after 971) or the Ikhwan al-Safa’, etc. (Landolt,\n2008, 242–244).  \nIn the end, Suhrawardi’s fate was sealed with accusations of\nheresy (rather than treason). Biographers and historians remained at\nodds over the exact charges and course of events that led to his\nexecution at the end of 1191 (or early1192) (Marcotte 2001a).  \nVarious classifications exist of Suhrawardi’s works, with either\nthree (Massigon), four (Corbin, Walbridge and Ziai), five (Nasr 1964,\n58–9) or six (Kadivar 2011, 297–8) categories (Suh. 1993a,\nvii–xvii, xviii–xx). Although very few of his works can be\ndated, Walbridge (2017, 257–8), guided by indications found in\nhis works, established the following classification that takes into\naccount the overlapping redaction of some of the texts: (i)\njuvenilia (before ca. 1180), such as Temples of\nLight (Suh. 1996), his allegories (many in Persian) depicting the\njourney of the soul (Suh. 1976, 1993c, 1999b, 2001, 2007), but also a\ntranslation into Persian of Avicenna’s Treatise of the\nBird, a commentary of the latter’s Pointers and\nReminders, and his take on the latter’s Treatise on\nLove; (ii) mature Peripatetic works (from 1180 to 1186), like\nFlashes of Light and Intimations (completed before\nPI), a précis of Avicennan Peripatetic theses\n(Suh. 1993a, 1–121 [metaphysics], 2009a [logic, physics,\nmetaphysics]; cf. Ibn Kammuna 2003, 2009); (iii) Philosophy of\nIllumination (completed in 1186) in which he details the main\nrules, principles and arguments of his ishraqi) philosophical\nsystem, the symbolism of Light resting at the heart of his\nreconfiguration of a number of cosmological and ontological\nPeripatetic theses put forward by Avicenna ; (iv) other Peripatetic\nworks (completed by 1186): Paths and Havens (completed when\nhe was almost 30; probably early 1180s) (Suh. 1993a, 194–506\n[metaphysics], 2006 [logic], 2015 [physics]), and Opposites\n(Suh. 1993a, 124–92 [metaphysics], cf. 2009b), revisiting issues\ndiscussed in the Philosophy of Illumination; and (v) other\nshort works (from 1180 to 1185), such as Tablets for ‘Imad (Suh.\n2001, 31–98 [Ar.], 1993c, 110–95 [Pers.], 1976,\n99–116 [Corbin]), and his shorter Book of Hours-like\nArabic prayers, supplications (du‘a) and intimate\ndevotions (munajat), ‘occult invocations’\n(prayers to celestial bodies) (Walbridge 2011; Suh., 1976),\ncommentaries on some verses of the Qur’an (Nurbakhsh 2007), and\npoetry (Suh. 2005).  \nCorbin (d.1978) noted that there might not have been a purely\nPeripatetic intellectual period, though Suhrawardi asserts he defended\nthe approach in his youth (PI, §166), if, indeed, he\ncomposed most of his treatises over a very short span of time,\nprobably during the course of about ten years. Moreover, a number of\nhis works expound both Peripatetic and ishraqi principles,\nlike Tablets to ‘Imad (written after PI,\nduring the last five years of his life) and Temples of Light\n(Suh. 1996, 1976, 139–47). Likewise, although\nIntimations is said to be written according to the\nPeripatetic tradition (PI, §3) whose principles\nSuhrawardi’s reexamined (Suh. 1993a, 2), it prepares the ground\nfor some of the Philosophy of Illumination’s more\ndistinctive Illuminationist positions (Suh. 1993a, 70–8,\n105–21; (Walbridge 2017, 256–9).  \nThus, one must take into account the interrelations between\nSuhrawardi’s five major philosophical works, which contain\ncross-references, to grasp fully his system as a whole. Walbridge\n(2017, 258) proposes the following order of Suhrawardi’s majors\nworks: (i) Intimations (completed before PI); (ii)\nPhilosophy of Illumination (completed in 1186); (iii)\nPaths and Havens and Flashes of Light (written\nsimultaneously with PI, but completed later, cf. Suh. 1991,\n142.10, 146.14 [Najafquli ed., 175.19-20], cf. 1988, 207.5, 215.6,\n2001, 241.2-4); and (iv) Opposites (written after the\ncompletion of PI and Paths and Havens) (cf.\nSuhrawardi’s order: Intimations, then\nOpposites, followed by Paths and Havens, and ending\nwith PI).  \nIn his quest to revive the intellectual heritage of all those who had\nmastered ‘true’ knowledge, i.e. that of the Ancients for\nthe East and the West, Suhrawardi tapped into an experiential-like\ntype of knowledge. In his ’s Philosophy of\nIllumination, he mentioned that the work was written with the\nobjective of disclosing what he says he “obtained through my\nintuition during my retreats and visions. […] the present work has\nanother method and provides a shorter path to knowledge […] I did\nnot first arrive at it through cogitation; rather, it was acquired\nthrough something else. Subsenquently I sought proof for it, so that,\nshould I cease contemplating the proof, nothing would make me fall\ninto doubt. In all that I have said about the science of lights and\nthat which is and is not based upon it, I have been assisted by those\nwho have traveled the path of God. This science is the very intuition\nof the inspired and illumined Plato, the guide and master of\nphilosophy”, and those who came before and after him\n(PI, §§2–4). This is the ishraqi\nmethod, with all its principles and rules, that builds upon, modifies\nand complements the principles at the heart of the Peripatetic method\n(notably Avicenna’s). It seems reasonable to cast\nSuhrawardi’s project as a critique of Avicenna’s Plato and\nNeoplatonizing brand of Peripateticism, similar to the various\ncritiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1142), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and al-Ghazali\n(d.1111), etc. \nSuhrawardi’s works circulated mainly within traditional circles\nof learning in the Islamic East. At the beginning of the\n20th century and in the wake of the works of Bernard Carra\nde Vaux (1902), Max Horten (1912), Otto Spies and Sarfaraz K. Khatak\n(1935), and Helmut Ritter (1938), the French Iranologist, Henry Corbin\nbegan to study Suhrawardi’s works after having received, from\nLouis Massigion, a copy of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi’s commentary\non the Philosophy of Illumination. Corbin embarked on a\nlifelong project of edition, translation and study of\nSuhrawardi’s works. A first volume, published in Istanbul in\n1945 (Suh. 1993a), contained the metaphysics of three major Arabic\nworks of Suhrawardi. Corbin then edited, in 1952, the Arabic\nmagnum opus, the Philosophy of Illumination (Suh.\n1993b, 1999a, 1986), together with two minor works. He went on to\nwrite a number of translations and studies, namely Suhrawardi et\nles platoniciens de Perse (Corbin 1971; cf. Abu Rayyan 1969; Suh.\n1999b). In 1970, Hossein Nasr edited fourteen of his Persian texts\n(two attributed to him), many allegorical or mystical in nature (Suh.\n1976, 1993c, 1999b).  \nMapping Suhrawardi’s intellectual trajectory and identifying the\nsources he may have used proves difficult, notably because he states\nhe was first a ‘zealous’ defender of the Peripatetic\ntradition, and was later assisted by those who “have travelled\nthe path of God” and mastered the ‘science of\nintuition’, the likes of “the inspired and illuminated\nPlato”, Hermes, Empedocles, Pythagoras, etc. among the Greeks\nand Jamasp, Frashostar, Bozorgmehr, etc. among the Ancient Persians\n(PI, §3; cf. Suh. 1993a, 502–4). His philosophical\nproject sought to revive the wisdom (hikma) of the Ancients,\ntapping into this double (Eastern/Western) initiatic genealogy of\nSages and from the Greek and Arab philosophers who threaded the\n‘path of God’. \nInstructed in the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition, Suhrawardi studied\nthe views of Aristotle, Plato, the Neoplatonists, and later\nphilosophers (falasifa) who wrote in Arabic, notably\nAvicenna’s (d.1037) whose major works remained central. Work is\nstill needed to assess the nature of the influence exerted on him by\nAvicenna’s other works, for instance, his Discussions\n(1992) and Notes on Aristotle’s De anima\n(1984), and by post-Avicennan philosophers, particularly Abu\nal-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), the original yet eclectic critic\nof Avicenna’s logic, psychology and metaphysics, Fakhr al-Din\nal-Razi (d.1210), and the the innovative Ibn Sahlan al-Sawi (the\nlogician) (d.ca. 1158). \nCharting Suhrawardi’s intellectual journey and encounters with\nmysticism, ancient Greek Gnosticism and Hermeticism, or ancient\nPersian Zoroastrian traditions, to whose symbols he often appeals,\nremains exceedingly difficult (Muwahhid 1995). Some have attempted to\ntrace the Greek influences of such figures as Empedocles, Pythagoras,\nHermes, etc. in his work, an exercise that has, for example, rendered\nhim a ‘Pythagoreanizing Neoplatonist’ (Walbridge 2000,\n2001) with more or less success (Gutas 2003, 308).  \nSuhrawardi frequently appeals to the authority of Plato. This includes\nmaterial from the Arabic (pseudo)Theology of Aristotle (a\nparaphrase of parts of Books IV-VI of Plotinus’\nEnneads) that he attributes to Plato, perhaps because the\nlatter is mentioned more than once at the end of the first chapter\n(D’Ancona 2004). This is evidenced where Suhrawardi quotes or\nalludes to a passage from the (pseudo)Theology of Aristotle\n(I.21–26; cf. Enneads 4.8.1) that he ascribes to Plato\n(PI, §171; cf. Suh. 1993a, ), a passage to which he\nagain alludes (PI, §171), and again in summary form in\nhis Intimations (Talwihat) (Suh. 1993a, 112; cf.\nWalbridge, 2000, 134–137; (for a number of specific overlaps,\nsee Arnzen, 2011, 119–150 and Sinai, 2011 [commentary on\n§§ 4, 94, 109, 129 and 171]). Shahrazuri seems to have known\nthe work as the Kitab al-Mimar (the Arabic term of the\ndivision headings of the work). Moreover, the Theology\ncontains passages (Enneads IV, 8.1) that mention many\nphilosophers of the Greek tradition to which Suhrawardi states being\nthe heir. Why Suhrawardi “presented himself as\nfollowing these ancient philosophers, and especially Plato, rather\nthan Avicenna” has yet to be elucidated and adequately explained\n(Gutas 2003, 308–9).  \nIn addition, possible influences of Ismailism or Sufism have yet to be\nfully explored: some elements of his ishraqidoctrine may have\nmore affinity with Ismaili thought (such as the hierarchical notion of\nbeing in the works of 10th century Abu Ya‘qub\nal-Sijistani) than with the doctrines of classical Sufis whom he\nclaims to be following (Landolt 1987), although similarities with\ncertain Sufi theories have been identified (Landolt 2008,\nforthcoming). Medieval biographers, on the other hand, readily\nreported Suhrawardi’s mystical inclination, his association with\nmystics, his ascetic practices and (hagiographic) wondrous deeds. He\nhimself considered spiritual exercises a necessary preparation for the\nadvent of ‘presential’ (huduri) knowledge and\nvision of the Lights.  \nSuhrawardi also appeals to ancient Zoroastrian motifs, terminology and\nmythical figures, even Mazdean theology, for example, in his\nInvocations and Prayers (Suh. 1976; Mo‘in 1950; cf.\nGaffari 2001, 375–85; see the occult and devotional works\nunearthed by Walbridge 2011). For some, his appeal to angels as\nembodiments of intellective light principles has been likened to\nancient Zoroastrian (Corbin 1971, 111–3, 124–5) or Mazdean\n(Nasr 1964, 71) angelology; for others, it echoes the angels found in\nAbu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi’s al-Mu‘tabar\n(What Has Been Established Through Personal Reflection)\n(1939, vol. 2, 157; cf. Pines 1979, 253–5), the latter being\ndevoid of any ancient Persian symbolism. Without any clear historical\nfiliations to particular textual traditions, one can only rely on\nSuhrawardi’s own claims to have intended to provide a synthesis\nof those ancient Western and Eastern intellectual traditions.  \nVery little has been written about Suhrawardi’s logical\ntreatises or his logic in general, namely because most of his logical\nworks remain unedited, and few scholars of Islamic philosophy delve\ninto logic. Hussein Ziai (1990) provides perhaps the only general\noverview of his logic, his criticisms of Peripatetic\n(Aristotelian/Avicennan) essentialist definitions and his\nishraqi theory of definition. While Suhrawardi includes\nlogical discussions in his major Arabic works, in the Philosophy\nof Illumination, he criticizes and restructures some elements of\nPeripatetic logic. For Shahrazuri (1988), his works bear the marks of\nextensive study of the Nasiri Observations of Ibn Sahlan\nal-Sawi (1988, 378), a non-Aristotelian Persian Logician who\nreorganized the content of the Organon. The work may have\ninspired Suhrawardi’s restructuring of the logic, in\nIntimations, into expository propositions, wherein definition\nand description become part of his semantic theory, and theory of\nproofs (hujaj) (Ziai 1990, 45, 51–6). Noteworthy is\nZiai’s reconceptualization of Suhrawardi’s pragmatic use\nof logic into three parts: semantics, formal logic and techniques, and\nmaterial logic (Ziai, 1990, 73–75). \nThe Philosophy of Illumination does not follow the customary\ntripartite logic, physics, and metaphysics division of many\nPost-Avicennan Peripatetic works. It is divided into two main parts.\nThe first part, divided into three ‘discourses’,\nintroduces ‘Rules of Thought’ that cover not only logic,\nbut also some elements of physics and metaphysics (PI,\n§§7–106). The seven rules of the first discourse are\non knowledge and definition (see 2.2 below) (PI,\n§§7–15). The first five rules pertain to logic and\ndeal with subject matter found in the Isagoge and derived\nfrom the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition (Ziai 1990, 58–67).\nFirst, Suhrawardi introduces elements of semantics, where are\ndiscussed problems of meaning, the distinction between conception and\nassent, and on the nature, definition and description of\n‘reality’ (haqiqa), the latter being equated by\nQutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311) with quiddity (mahiyya). Then,\nhe discusses accidents, universals (his nominalist ontology), and the\ninnate (fitriyya) and acquired nature of human knowledge\n(intuition, personal revelation, and inspiration being prior in\nessence, while logic being applicable only to the latter) (Mousavian\n2014a, 478; cf. Walbridge 2014; Mousavian 2014b).  \nThe seven sections of the second discourse pertain to proofs and their\nprinciples (PI, §§16–33). Suhrawardi\nintroduces short discussions to describe propositions and syllogisms,\nthe classes and the modalities in propositions. He proposes to reduce\nall types of propositions to necessary affirmative propositions. He\ncriticizes the Peripatetics’ understanding of negation and\ndiscusses the differences between the Peripatetics and his novel views\nregarding a number of sophisms, for example, reducing the second and\nthird figures to the first figure, and reducing modal propositions to\none form. Street (2008, 165, 175) also showed that Suhrawardi\n“reduces all his modal propositions to the appropriate\ndefinitely necessary version” in accord with Avicenna’s\nsyllogistic; this enables him “to express the truths of\nessentialism” befitting for his “essentialist\nmetaphysics”, thus making him a “defender and\nexpositor” Avicenna’s modal logic. He also discusses\ncontradiction, conversion, conditionals, demonstrative syllogisms, and\nreductio ad absurdum, the latter also discussed in the third\ndiscourse (Ziai 1990, 67–72). In Intimations, he\ndescribes the distinct syllogistic forms used in dialectics, rhetoric,\nand poetics, for example, the non-demonstrative syllogism of poetry\ndue to its imagined and non-scientific premises (Ziai 1990, 54).  \nThe third discourse presents sophistical refutations of errors\nuncovered in the formal and material logic of Peripatetic logic (an\nepitome of the Sophistical Refutations of the Organon)\n(PI, §§34–106). The third section deals with\na number of his ishraqi judgements against a number of\nPeripatetic issues of physics and metaphysics (see 3. and 4.). It also\nserves to establish certain “technical terms” (substance\nand accident, necessity and contingency, cause, and possible and\nimpossible infinities) (PI, §52–5), and on\n‘beings of reason’ (i‘tibarat\n‘aqliyya) (existence, necessity, etc.) (PI,\n56–68). Suhrawardi also revisits the classical theory of the\ncategories, adopting a reduced non-Peripatetic classification of five\ncategories: ‘substance’ (jawhar),\n‘quantity’, ‘quality’, ‘relation’\n(similar to Stoic reduction of categories to those four, cf. Walbridge\n1996, 527), to which he adds ‘motion’ (absent in Ibn\nSahlan), the latter four being accidental categories (PI,\n§71; Suh. 1993a, 4–12, 284–93; Ziai 1990, 72 n.2, 73\nn.3; Beidokhti 2018, 394–400). An ‘intensity’ (or\nperfection) is predicated of those five categories, such that the\ndegree of intensity (with its corollary ‘weakness’) of\nlight becomes a property of substances as well as of accidents (Ziai\n1990, 73–5).  \nRule seven of the first discourse is dedicated to the notion of\ndefinition, its conditions and reconfiguration into an\nishraqi principle (PI, §§13–5; Ziai\n1990, 77–114). Suhrawardi begins by rejecting the Peripatetic\ntheory of definition that he criticizes for the inductive approach it\nadvocates as a foundation for scientific knowledge and demonstration.\nHe uses logical and semantic arguments to question its\n‘essentialist’ definition (Aristotelian) on which\nAvicenna’s own ‘complete definition’ depends. He\nrejects the claims that it is possible to obtain a complete definition\nable to encompass all the essential constituents needed to lead to the\nknowledge of that which is previously unknown and in need of a\ndefinition. Suhrawardi writes that “it is clear that it is\nimpossible for a human being to construct an essential definition in\nthe way the Peripatetics require—a difficulty which even their\nmaster [Aristotle or Avicenna] admits. Therefore, we have definition\nonly by means of things that specify by conjunction”\n(PI, §15). Suhrawardi insists that a definition should\nenumerate, in some kind of unitary formula, all the essential\nconstituents of the described object. Therefore, he includes elements\nof definition by extension (enumeration of members of a\n‘class’) and of definition by intension (enumeration of\ndefining property or properties), for example, that “the essence\nof man (which is the truth underlying the symbol ‘man’),\nis a thing which is only recoverable […] in the\nsubject. This act of ‘recovery’ is the translation of the\nsymbol to its equivalent in the consciousness or the self of the\nsubject” (Ziai 1990, 127). For Street (2008, 178), what he calls\nhis ‘anti-essentialism’, or the inability to graps\nessences discursively, as he accepts the Platonic forms, does not rest\non his logic. Suhrawardi explains his ‘conceptualist’\nnotion of definition at greater length in his Paths and\nHavens (Suh. 2006, 83, 90–100). His epistemological\ncritique of the Peripatetic theory of definition is undoubtedly\ninspired by Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi’s own critical evaluation\nof the Isagoge which was developed in his\nal-Mu‘tabar (1939, vol. 1, 55–7; cf. Ziai 1990,\n183–4), but also by Suhrawardi’s own understanding of the\nepistemic role of self-knowledge as presence.  \nIn the Philosophy of Illumination, Suhrawardi introduces his\nishraqi theory of definition that signals what some have\nidentified as a ‘Platonic’ or ‘Neoplatonic’\nturn (Ziai 1990, 114–128). Now, only direct experience\nguarantees acquisition of true knowledge, such that epistemological\nconsiderations are at the heart of his reconceptualization of the\ndefinition. Suhrawardi’s theory of definition thus builds on a\nPlatonic (perhaps even Neoplatonic) epistemology. Knowledge of the\nreality of things occurs through the direct apprehension of the\nintrinsic light-nature (the thing as it is) of all entities\n(see 4.). Direct knowledge occurs through\n‘vision-illumination’, as a person realizes that what is\nto be defined becomes available to one’s self through\nself-consciousness. At such time, the soul becomes directly\naware of the reality of that which is to be defined. The soul is then\nable to grasp directly those essences whose elements can then be\ntranslated using proofs and demonstrations to develop a discursive\ntype of knowledge about that original apperception of reality.  \nIn his Paths and Havens, Suhrawardi notes that to define\nsomething is to actually ‘see’ the thing as it really is\n(Ziai 1990, 104–14). Suhrawardi opens the second part of his\nPhilosophy of Illumination with the following principle:\n“anything in existence that requires no definition or\nexplanation is evident. Since there is nothing more evident than\nlight, there is nothing less in need of definition”\n(PI, §107). Light, in and of itself, is not in need of\nany definition, because in and of itself it is self-evident. Here,\nSuhrawardi posits the epistemological and ontological centrality of\nthe concept of light. He argues that only direct intuitive experience\ncan lead to knowledge of the reality (haqiqa) of things,\nwhich definitions can only attempt to describe and explain via a\nposteriori rational investigations or demonstrations (Ziai 1990,\n81). Qutb al-Din Shirazi notes that ishraqi epistemology\nrelies on this type of personal and intuitive knowledge, itself not in\nneed of any definition (Ziai 1990, 133). \nSuhrawardi’s Intimations, Paths and Havens,\nOpposites and Flashes of Light all contain sections\non physics, although they have remained unstudied. Of those, only the\nphysics of the Flashes of Light (2001, 185–209; 1991\n[Najafquli ed.]) and of Intimations have been edited, the\nlatter together with a commentary by Ibn Kammuna (2003). In the third\ndiscourse of the Philosophy of Illumination, and in Paths\nand Havens (though not in Flashes of Light or\nIntimations), Suhrawardi reviews some general principles of\nphysics (albeit not in detail). Like Avicenna before him, he rejects\nthe atomism of the theologians (PI, §89), as well as the\nidea of a vacuum (PI, §§89–90). He also\ncriticizes and rejects (Aristotelian) Peripatetic hylomorphic division\nof bodies into matter and form, rejecting the notion of prime matter.\nShurawardi provides a number of arguments for his rejection of\nhylomorphism (PI, §72–88). One of them relies on\nhis theory of bodies that now consist of “self-subsistent\nmagnitude with accidents” (Walbridge 2017, 266–7), a\n“compound of extension and properties just as Simplicius”.\nIn addition, he needed “that accidents be able to constitute\ncauses, for it is the causality of accidents that makes it possible to\nexplain the existence of the Platonic Forms and ultimately to explain\nthe diversity of the celestial and sublunary reals”. Moreover,\nhe held that “entities that cannot be perceived either by\nphysical senses or by nonsensible intuition”, for example\n‘forms’, “cannot be known, and if they exist, it is\nonly as mental constructs”. These are important critiques and\nreformulations of physics to assist him in his reformulation of his\nmetaphysics. Bodies become ‘barriers’ or “things\nthat acquire properties from the lights” that differ in\n‘intensity’ (Walbridge, 2005, 240–242). Hylomorphism\nbecomes incompatible with the possibility of knowing real essences,\nthe ‘ontic’ luminous essence, of all entities, that of\nimmaterial lights and of ’s own self, which cannot be known via\na postulated ‘form’ (Ziai 1990, 131, 151–2). The\ndetermination of different bodies now “depends on the\nmulti-aspect movement and internal relationships of strong and weak\nlights”, intensity becoming the ontological discriminating\ncriterion (Arslan 2014, 150; PI, §74).  \nWith his philosophy of lights, he manages, nonetheless, to reconfigure\nsome elements of physics. For instance, immaterial entities and\nmaterial bodies are composed of varying degrees of intensity of light.\nThe physical world is composed of dusky substances with dark\naccidents, while self-subsistent magnitude appears to replace prime\nmatter which, like a number of traditional physical notions, becomes a\nmere mental concept that has no reality outside the mind. It is no\nlonger the perception of the form of objects, but their constitutive\nlights that becomes the true object of knowledge (Walbridge 2000,\n22–3).  \nSuhrawardi revisits Avicenna’s psychology, the framework out of\nwhich he elaborates his original ishraqi psychology. While he\nfinds inadequate the Peripatetic proofs for the immortality of the\nsoul (PI, §§91–3),the soul remains an\nimmaterial, self-subsisting, living, knowing substance, capable of\nruling over the body. However, he defines its substance in terms of\nthe intensity of its individual luminosity. Thereupon, a relation of\ndominion (qahr) and love (mahabba) or desire\n(‘ishq) is established between the luminous substance\nof the soul and the tenebrous substance of the body (PI,\n§§147–8). Between the two, the subtle substance of the\n(psychic) pneuma (ruh) functions as an intermediary\nthat enables the reception of images, forms or ‘icons’ of\nmetaphysical realities that it then reflects and manifests onto the\nsoul (PI, §§216–7).  \nVision remains the most important sense. It rests at the heart of\nSuhrawardi’s ishraqi theory of vision that provides,\nonce redefined, a mode of apprehension upon which can be modelled his\ntheory of knowledge by presence. He criticizes and rejects the\nmaterialist implications of the imprinting of forms in the material\nsubstratum of the eye implied in the prevalent\n‘extramissive’ and ‘intromissive’ theories of\nvision. Although mediated by a physical organ, vision remains instead\nprimarily an activity of the human (light) soul, whereby the soul\naccesses directly the reality of the objects of vision (PI,\n§§101–4). In the Philosophy of Illumination,\nthe vision of physical objects requires, first, a\n‘presential’ face-to-face encounter of that which\nperceives, both the physical organ and the human soul, and the\nilluminated object; second, the absence of obstacles between subject\nand object, often described in mystical terms as the absence of veils,\nwhereby the soul becomes illuminated by the (substantial or\naccidental) light of the object; and, finally, the presence of light,\nthe necessary condition for the establishment of this ishraqi\nrelation. Vision thus unfolds simultaneously on two different planes,\nphysical visual perception being reduced to the soul’s\nperception or awareness of the intrinsic and essential light possessed\nby the object, with which it shares a light reality. Therefore, true\nvision does not require the acquisition and transmission of forms, but\noccurs through the soul’s ability to be aware of the essential\nlight-reality of the object. Hence, physics and metaphysics merge, as\nvisible objects have the ability to receive and emit light, though\nonly in an accidental manner, light being precisely what the managing\n(mudabbira) light-soul, the Isfahbad-light, is able to\nperceive, whether it be through the senses, the soul/intellect,\nintuition, or dreams (PI, §§145–6). A certain\ntype of intuitive (innate) knowledge of the light rests at the heart\nof vision (PI, §226) and upon which discursive knowledge\nmay subsequently validate rationally through demonstrations\n(Ha’iri Yazdi 1992; Dinani 1985).  \nSuhrawardi also criticizes the localization of the internal faculties\nin different parts of the brain, since localizing them in a material\norgan again naturalizes the process of representation. Internal\nfaculties now become shadows (or functions) of the soul, lumped\ntogether into a single faculty responsible for representation. The\nIsfahbad-light principle accesses the dominating (qahira)\nlights, rules over the active imagination, and reflects onto it the\nlights it receives and grasps. The faculty of representation perceives\nparticulars, while the governing (mudabbira) light, the\nIsfahbad-light principle that guarantees the unity of the soul, can\nperceive universals and immaterial entities. The emphasis on the\nwholeness of the soul, as the main perceiving entity, and the\nreduction of the Avicennan faculties traditionally responsible for\nrepresentation to a single faculty could find their origin in Abu\nal-Barakat al-Baghdadi’s al-Mu‘tabar (1939, vol.\n2, 318–24; cf. Pines 1979, 227–31). As for recollection,\nSuhrawardi defines it in a rather Platonic manner, whereby it becomes\nthe retrieval of images (or concepts) whose existence lies in the\n‘world of memorial’, accessible only to the luminous part\nof the soul, though not in the manner of the Platonic theory of\nknowledge by recollection of the soul’s prior knowledge it\npossessed before its temporal origination with its body.  \nFor Suhrawardi, illumination becomes a metaphor for the intellective\nprocess. Illuminative relations take place between metaphysical active\nlight principles and the human soul (Marcotte forthcoming). Whereas\nonly the (rational) Isfahbad-light part of the soul is immortal,\nSuhrawardi, nevertheless, notes the possibility for the imaginative\nfaculty of souls that have not yet achieved perfection to\n“escape to the world of suspended images, whose locus is one of\nthe celestial barriers” that would function as an\n‘astral’ body, bringing “images into being”\n(PI, §§244–6). While perfect souls have\ndirect access to the (intelligible) immaterial lights (PI,\n§250), the survival of human imagination would be required for\nthe experiencing of divine retribution and the perfecting of imperfect\nsouls in the afterlife.  \nThe spheres of Ether and Zamharir, both situated below the sphere of\nthe Moon and associated with the world of elements, are identified as\npossible spiritual/‘pneumatic’ substrata for the\nposthumous activities of the imaginative faculties of those souls\n(Suh. 1993c, 245); although, it has been suggested that it could\n“simply be read as one of the celestial bodies, Moon, Mercury,\nVenus, and so on” (van Lit 2017, 47). Suhrawardi postulates the\nexistence of this independent eschatological realm with the assistance\nof which sensitive perceptions can occur in the form of imaginable\nrepresentations (PI, §244–8; Suh. 1992a, 90;\nMarcotte 2011; cf. Kutubi 2015, 93–6). Suhrawardi’s\n‘world of images’ provides a solution to Avicenna’s\nattempt to explain posthumous felicity of souls in the Hereafter, in\nthe form of posthumous ‘imaginable’ experience of\npleasures and pains (see section 4.3) and to explain the ethics\neschatology nexus (see section 5).  \nFinally, while Suhrawardi denies metempsychosis in his Peripatetic\nworks (namely Flashes of Light and Intimations), he\nwould seems more sympathetic to the idea in the Philosophy of\nIllumination. In this work, he reviews arguments for and against\nmetempsychosis that remain inconclusive, such that he does not appear\nto reject completely the possibility of some kind of transmigration of\nsouls (cf. Plotinus’ Enneads), especially for imperfect\n(miserable) souls. However, some commentators, like Shahrazuri, were\nof the opinion that he upheld metempsychosis (PI,\n§§229–45; Schmidtke 1999; Walbridge 2017,\n271–73).  \nAt the heart of Suhrawardi’s epistemological concerns lie two\nimportant components of his ishraqi philosophy of lights: the\nconcepts of ‘self-awareness’ (shu‘ur\nbi-l-dhat) and ‘knowledge by presence’\n(‘ilm huduri) (PI, §§114–7).\nWhat is at stake is the nature of the acquisition of knowledge and its\nontological underpinning. He begins by exploring and questioning some\nof the issues raised by the hypothetical thought experiment of the\n‘flying’ or ‘suspended’ person found in\nAvicenna’s Discussions and his Notes on\nAristotle’s De anima, and his treatments of the soul in\nthe Cure and Salvation. In Intimations, for\ninstance, he criticizes and then rejects Avicenna’s Peripatetic\n‘representational’ epistemology that conceives acquisition\nof knowledge by means of a ‘representation’ or a\n‘form’ of what is known in the knower (Kaukua 2015,\n106–17). He rejects it as a proof for the existence of the\nimmaterial soul, claiming that the relation enjoyed by the (material)\nbody/(immaterial) soul is a “more intimate relationship of\n‘presence’ (hudur)”, since\n‘presence’ now connects (immaterial) intellection and\ninternal (material/brain) senses activities. This experiential\nevidence would serve as proof for the existence of the soul \nIn his Philosophy of Illumination, he deals primarily with\n‘apperception’ (which now replaces representation or\nform). He analyzes the notions of apperception and self-awareness as\nhe explores this pre-logical mode of perception distinct from\nintellection. He discusses the primary awareness of the soul’s\nexistence, its self-identity, the unmediated character of this\nparticular type of knowledge and issues of individuation. He develops\nhis epistemological theory by providing various arguments to\ndemonstrate the existence of a type of knowledge that is self-evident,\ninnate and unmediated through any type of abstraction or\nrepresentation of forms, whether it be through an image, a form, a\nnotion or an attribute of the self (Marcotte 2006). \nThe perception of pain becomes paradigmatic of the type of\napperception or awareness he envisions when discussion self- awareness\nas unmediated perception, i.e., a non-discursive, non-conceptual and\nnon-propositional type of knowledge that, nonetheless, constitutes a\nmode of knowing distinct from discursive knowledge. Similar to pain,\nself-awareness provides yet another illustration of this type of\nepistemic process. In this manner, Suhrawardi is able to explain the\nknowledge of both an individual self-awareness of its self and the\nawareness of other external objects of knowledge. The unmediated\nnature of this process characterizes both the soul’s\nself-awareness and the soul’s awareness or knowledge of external\nobjects of knowledge, such as dominating (intelligible)\nlight-entities, and even provides the conditions for possible glimpses\nof the Light of Lights, God, it may catch (Suh. 1993a, 72–3,\n487–9; cf. Kaukua 2015, 130–1).  \nThe concept of self-awareness informs the epistemological and\nontological aspects of Suhrawardi’s metaphysic of lights.\nBuilding upon a basic type of self-awareness found in Avicenna (but\nwithout its inference to the substantiality of the human soul) and the\nselfhood (of the contemplative soul) of the Arabic Plotinus,\nSuhrawardi introduces a pre-cognitive level of self-consciousness or\nself-awareness, logically prior to any distinction between subject and\nobject (Kaukua 2011, 141–4). Self-awareness of human beings is\nequated with the self-awareness that incorporeal lights possess and\nshare. Suhrawardi writes, “It has been shown that your ego\n(ana’iyya) is an incorporeal light, that it is\nself-conscious, and that the incorporeal lights do not differ in their\nrealities. Thus, all the incorporeal lights must apprehend their own\nessences (dhat), since that which is necessarily true of a\nthing must also be true of that which has the same reality”\n(PI, §127; cf. Kaukua 2011, 150). He thus distinguishes\nthe ‘object of cognition’ from the ‘subject’,\nthe latter embodied in the ‘I-ness’\n(ana’iyya) coined by Suhrawardi to identify the\n“mode of being proper to a cognitive subject”;\nself-awareness, as mere apprehension and existence, is now\ndistinguished from the awareness of separate objects (Kaukua 2015,\n113; Marcotte 2006).  \nIt is upon self-awareness that Suhrawardi builds his\n“revisionist concept of knowledge as presence” (Kaukua\n2015, 125–42). In his Intimations, the\n‘Plotinian’ (cf. Enneads V 3.6) Aristotle figure\nof Suhrawardi’s famous ‘dream-vision ‘ provides an\nillustrious example of what constitutes real knowledge based on\nimmediate and intuitive knowledge: “return to your self\n(nafs)” (1993a, 70), that is, knowledge one obtains\nthrough one’s own soul. This Aristotle continues to explain how\none knows, introducing intellection as “the presence\n(hudur) of a thing for a self (dhat)”,\npresence (hudur) or appearance (zuhur) being a\n“function of luminosity”. These passages of\nIntimations introduce central elements of Suhrawardi’s\nknowledge by presence (Suh. 1993a, 71–4; cf. Walbridge 2000,\n225–9; Eichner 2001, 127–40; Kaukua 2013, 310–7,\n2015, 127–33; Fanaei Eshkevari, 1996).  \nIn Suhrawardi’s ‘science of lights’, the object of\napperception — light — cannot be known discursively, but\nonly through an immediate presence or awareness of its luminosity, as\nnot to fall into reification. Mystical vision and contemplation\noperate through this intuitive process of knowing metaphysical lights.\nIndividuals achieve such states through spiritual and ascetic\npractices that enable them to detach themselves from the darknesses of\nthe world in their quest for the apperception of those lights.\nIntuitive knowledge (dhawq) thus constitutes a superior means\nof accessing the luminous reality and the divine realm of metaphysical\ntruths.  \nSuhrawardi appears to spiritualize Avicenna’s Peripatetic\nepistemology with a notably Platonic reading, now that the access to\nthe ultimate reality is guaranteed through divine photic illumination.\nHis classification of learned men according to their respective merits\nin discursive (philosophy) and intuitive (mystical) knowledge is\nrevealing. For some, like Qutb al-Din Shirazi, whereas the\nPeripatetics had extolled intellection, Suhrawardi brings direct\nintuition (dhawq) or mystical contemplation (heightened by\nascetic components) to the forefront, as an alternative — albeit\nmore reliable — foundation of certainty, where this presence can\nbe achieved through intuitive apprehension or contemplative vision\n(mushahada) in order to access true reality, following\ncontinuous practice of spiritual exercises.  \nDirect intuition (dhawq) or mystical contemplation plays a\npredominant role, even for prophets. Prophetic knowledge relies on the\nfunctions of the faculty of imagination, i.e., its mimetic function\nand its role in the particularization of universal truths. Prophecy\nbecomes the ‘direct’ experience of the world of lights.\nSuhrawardi also introduces an independent ‘world of\nimages’ to account for the ability of prophets and other gifted\nindividuals to access divine metaphysical realms where imaginable\nforms already exist. Such individuals are either commissioned or\nuncommissioned to receive and transmit God’s message, the\nprophets being those who are among the privileged commissioned. Direct\nintuition lies at the heart of Suhrawardi’s prophetology,\ninasmuch as only the most perfect sage (hakim) with intuitive\nphilosophy (muta’allih) who witnesses those truths,\nwhether he be a prophet or not, deserves God’s viceregency\n(khilafa), by being either a living proof or in occultation.\nIndividuals who have access to those metaphysical lights can be\ninvested with this viceregency, depending on the degree of their\nreceptivity and the purity of their hearts (PI, §5).\n \nOn the whole, however, the epistemic process by which mystics such as\nAbu Yazid al-Bistami (d.874), Sahl al-Tustari (d.896) and Hallaj\n(d.912), sages such as Zarathustra and Empedocles, philosophers such\nas Pythagoras and Plato, or Suhrawardi himself have all had access to\nthose metaphysical truths and divine realms remains quite similar to\nthe process by which prophets have accessed the same divine and\nmetaphysical truths. Liberated from the enslavement of the material\nworld, their Isfahbad-light souls become receptive to illumination and\nperceive truths similar to those perceived by prophets. Prophetic and\nmystical knowledge only occur once the human soul is able to conjoin\nwith those metaphysical lights. The soul is able to acquire a luminous\nand theurgic power, mediated by the active imagination which\nexistentiates images and forms that have been reflected, in a\nmirror-like manner, onto it (Sinai 2015). It can imitate and reproduce\nforms that it has received from non-sensible realms, as it\nshort-circuits all incoming external and sensible data. The faculty of\nactive imagination then projects those matters onto the ‘common\nsense’ that provides a sensible form to those divine\nmetaphysical realities that they did not originally possess.  \nIn the Philosophy of Illumination, Suhrawardi develops a\ncomplex metaphysic of ‘divine’ lights. Light, the lynchpin\nof his metaphysics, structures his ontology and cosmology at the heart\nof which lies a spectrum of light and darkness that shapes the whole\nof reality. In his Intimations (Suh. 1993a, 2–3),\nphilosophy is divided into theoretical and practical components, where\nthe tripartite division of the practical encompasses the standard\nperitatetic disciplines of ethics (khuluqiyya), economics\n(manziliyya) and politics (madaniyya), while the\ntheoretical is concerned with immaterial realities, the highest\ntheoretical component being concerned with absolute being\n(wujud).  \nSuhraward’s concept of light manages to ‘disrupt’\nthe classical Peripatetic ontology by rendering obsolete the Avicennan\ndistinction between ‘essence’ and ‘existence’\nin contingent beings (Rizvi 2000). Perhaps following Aristotle,\nAvicenna favored the primacy of essence over existence, the latter\nbeing considered an abstract concept. Suhrawardi criticized and\nrejected the Peripatetic logical distinction between the two concepts,\ninsisting that the concept of existence is added to quiddity in\nre, such that the general extension of the concept of existence\nremains a mental predicate, not a real one. Concepts such as being,\nthingness, etc. that Peripatetics considered a priori and\nreal are, for Suhrawardi, ‘beings of reason’\n(i‘tibar ‘aqli), i.e. “merely mental\nconsiderations (i‘tibari) with no corresponding\nreality” (Rizvi 1999, 222; PI, §68, 56; Suh.\n1993a, 175–6). This is what some have labeled Suhrawardi’s\n‘conceptualist’ position, essence and existence being\ndistinct only in the mind, and his ‘anti-realist’ approach\nto existence, a notion predicated only of concepts in the mind\n(Benevich 2017, 206, 251), a possible later Nasir al-Din al-Tusi\ninspired reading.  \nThe primacy of light signals a shift in the understanding of the very\nnature of the ‘essence’ of things. The respective degree\nor intensity of light of essences makes them distinct from one\nanother, although they all share in the same light whose origin\nremains with the Light of Lights. Everything partakes in and\nof light, in an almost infinite manner. The distinction\nbetween essence and existence no longer becomes appropriate to assert\ncontingency and only remains notional, since the difference between\nnecessary and contingent beings depends now on whether a being\npossesses light in itself or light for other than\nitself (Rizvi 1999, 223; PI, §68). In the\nPhilosophy of Illumination (§121), Suhrawardi writes,\n“Light is divided into light of itself and in itself and light\nof itself but in another. You know that accidental light is light in\nanother. Thus, it is not a light in itself although it is a\nlight of itself”.  \nRizvi (1999, 224) showed how later philosophers ascribed the\nontological primacy of essence (or quiddity) thesis to Suhrawardi who\n“clearly states that quiddity/essence in itself is a conceptual\nand unreal a notion as existence”, Suhrawardi noting that\n“the quiddity of luminosity [i.e., the same as light] is a\nmental universal” (PI, §141). But it is also true\nthat Suhrawardi’s “phenomenological epistemology of\neidetic vision” could easily imply a primacy of essence\n(Rizvi 1999, 224). The position is eminently nominalist, now that both\nexistence and essence are considered mere mental concepts, reality\nhaving been redefined with the new primacy of light. Likewise, his\ntheory of knowledge by presence remains “deeply nominalist and\nempiricist” (viz. mystical experience) (Walbridge 2000, 169).\nHowever, light and essence cannot be synonymous. Both light and\ndarkness exist: “light is the being of things as their\ninstantiating principle in concreto and not their\nessences” (ibid.). Likewise, light is not identical\nwith substance, since both dark substances and accidental lights exist\n(Walbridge 2000, 24). Rizvi (1999, 224) notes that entities grasped as\nessences through presential knowledge are “apparent aspects of\nwhat one might regard as ‘light monads’”, an idea\nwhose source appears to be highly Platonic or Neoplatonic (Proclus).\n \nFor Suhrawardi (PI, §§111–3), being is\ngrasped through the (non-sensible) vision of lights that lie beyond\nthe essences, as even the existence of bodies depends upon incorporeal\nlights: “Nothing that has an essence (dhat) of which it\nis not unconscious is dusky, for its essence is evident\n(zuhur) to it. It cannot be a dark state (hay’a\nzulmaniyya) in something else, since even the luminous state\n(hay’a nuriyya) is not a self-subsistent light (nur\nli-dhati-ha), let alone the dark state. Therefore, it is\nnonspatial pure incorporeal (nur mahd) light”\n(PI, §114). Access to this ultimate reality of beings is\nachieved through the direct experience of its ontic light reality,\nrendering intuitive and non-discursive knowledge (logically) prior to\nany other type of knowledge.  \nSuhrawardi’s criticism of the essence-existence distinction had\nan impact on later discussions, namely those of Ibn Kammuna (d.1284)\n(Eichner 2010), Athir al-Din al-Abhari (d.ca.1265) and al-Katibi\nal-Qazwini (d.ca.1276) (Eichner 2012). Later, Mulla Sadra (d.1636)\nnotes Suhrawardi’s confusion between the concept of existence\nand the reality of existence and replaces his notion of light with the\nnotion of being, blending Avicenna’s ontology of contingency\nwith his ishraqi hierarchy of lights (Rizvi 1999, 225).  \nIn the second part of the Philosophy of Illumination,\nSuhrawardi lays out his light ontology. While some parallels can be\ndrawn with the mystical light epistemology of Muhammad al-Ghazali\n(d.1111) in his Niche of Lights (1998) (cf. PI,\n§171; Sinai 2016), Suhrawardi develops a distinctly original\ntheory of light. Light and its manifestation are fundamental\nontological principles of his complex metaphysics wherein the\ncontinuous irradiation from the Light of Lights creates and sustains\nthe unity of reality.  \nThe nature of light, its various manifestations and their\ninterconnectedness determine what exists. All existing things can are\ndivided into four classes of existents (from which Suhrawardi’s\ncosmology is derived). The first category of entities consists of\nself-subsistent ‘pure’ or ‘immaterial lights’\nthat are strikingly similar to Leibniz’s\nmonads (Walbridge 2005: 244), those that are associated with the\nPeripatetic intellects. These lights manifest to themselves are aware\nof both themselves and what is other than them. These are causally\nprimary, in terms of existence and of efficiency, though they\n“can differ in intensity and in luminous and dark\naccidents” (aspects of their individuation). In addition, they\nare now endowed with the capacity to create and to be “manifest\nto other immaterial lights”. The second category consists of\n‘dark barriers’, bodies whose existence depends on\naccidental light to make them manifest (as “the effects of\nlights”) and that are “known only by incorporeal\nlights”. The third category consists of ‘accidental\nlights’, inhering in another, such as physical lights, and the\n“luminous accidents” occurring “in both barriers and\nin immaterial lights”. The last category consists of ‘dark\naccidents’, the “qualities of physical things that are not\nmanifest in themselves”, but inhering in another (Walbridge\n1992, 49–51, 2004, 213–4; PI,\n§§107–13, 121). Thus, what distinguishes quiddities is\nthe degree of their luminous intensity within the ontological\nhierarchies or ‘grades’ (more or less) of light, from the\nnoblest of light, the Light of Lights (God) to the absence of it\n(matter).  \nSuhrawardi adopts a familiar ‘pyramidal structure of levels of\nlight being’, from the Light of lights to the sublunary world.\nHe appeals to two (Peripatetic) principles to uphold the existence of\na first necessary cause — the Light of Lights — and all\nthe basic classes of beings (light and darkness, substance and state,\nindependent and dependent beings). A first principle, Walbridge notes,\n“is a form of the principle of sufficient reason, ‘the\nprinciple of the most noble contingency’ […] which\nasserts that nothing can exist without a cause of higher ontological\nlevel” (PI, §§164–73; cf. Paths and\nHavens for Aristotle’s views in On the Heavens;\nSuh. 1993a, 434–5). This first principle of ‘nobler\ncontingency’ (imkan ashraf), central for\nSuhrawardi’s demonstration of the existence of a Light of Light\nthat is ontologically discinct from, though partaking in the\ncontingent of which it is the first cause. A second principle\ncorresponds to the Aristotelian “impossibility of an ordered,\nactual infinity” which, with the first principle, guarantees\nthat “there cannot be an infinite number of levels of being and\nthat there must be one being whose existence is necessary in itself\n— Avicenna’s ‘Necessary of Existence’\n(wajib al-wujud)” — and for Suhrawardi, the Light\nof Lights (Walbridge 2000, 24–5, 1992, 56–61; PI,\n§§129–38, 55). Mayer (2001) showed that this second\nprinciple was certainly not central to Avicenna’s\ncosmological/ontological argument of the existence of God. From the\nbeing of the One, the Light of Lights, can emanate all the existents\nand the cosmos via a complex interconnected irradiation of light\nintensity (PI, §150–4), varying light intensity\nbringing to life the different ‘degrees’ of contingent\nimmaterial and material beings, a monist-like ontology of lights that\naccommodates the contingency of all existents irradiated, but\ndistinct, from Light of Lights (cf. Rizvi, 2019, and 2009, ch.2).  \nWhile light always remains in itself identical, its proximity or\ndistance from the Light of Lights determines the ontic light reality\nof all beings. Their ontological statuses, qualities and influences\nare determined by the different degrees of intensity of light. The\ndistinguishing characteristic is the scale of lights coming into being\nthrough the radiance of light: the greater its radiance, the greater\nits ontological perfection. Reality proceeds from the Light of Lights\nand unfolds via the First Light and all the subsequent dominating and\nmanaging lights whose exponential interactions bring about the\nexistence of all existents. As each new light interacts with other\nexisting lights, more light and dark substances are generated. Light\nproduces both immaterial and substantial lights, such as immaterial\nintellects (angels), human and animal souls. Light produces dusky\nsubstances, such as bodies. In fact, light generates both luminous\naccidents, such as those in immaterial lights, physical lights or\nrays, and dark accidents, whether it be in immaterial lights or in\nbodies (PI, §§109–10).  \nAlong with the notion of varying degrees of intensity of light,\nSuhrawardi introduces two hierarchies of immaterial lights: a vertical\norder and a horizontal order. The first vertical order of lights\nproceeds from the Light of Lights. These are the pure and incorporeal\n(mujarrada) dominating (qahira) lights. From the\nLight of Lights proceeds an incorporeal First Light — following\nthe Neoplatonic principle ex uno non fit nisi unum, i.e.\n‘from the one, in so far as it is one, comes only one’\n(principle at the heart of Avicenna’s emanationist\n(fayd) cosmology, cf. Lizzini, 2016, sect. 5.4) — thus\nassuring ontological dependency of all that comes into existence upon\nthe Light of Lights. From this First Light proceeds a Second Light and\nthe all-encompassing barzakh (highest heaven); from the\nsecond proceeds a Third Light and a second barzakh, or the\nSphere of fixed stars; and so forth (PI, §141–3,\n151–2). This vertical order of incorporeal lights is further\ndivided into two classes: the loftier dominating lights — the\nAvicennan Peripatetic immaterial intellects — and the managing\n(mudabbira) lights — the Avicennan Peripatetic\nimmaterial souls of the spheres associated with the various bodies\n(barazikh), as well as the managing Isfahbad light that rules\nover human souls (PI, §155). Light operates at all\nlevels and hierarchies of reality: irradiation proceeds from higher\ndominating (qahira a‘la) lights, whereas the lower\nlights desire the higher ones (PI, §147). There is a\ncorrelative relation of dominance (qahr) and yearning or love\n(mahabba) between the higher incorporeal lights and the lower\naccidental lights (PI, §156).  \nThis vertical hierarchy of lights mirrors the Avicennan Neoplatonic\nprocess of emanation of intellects. Suhrawardi, however, increases the\nnumber of active principles (the Peripatetics immaterial intellects,\nsomething Averroes denounced in Avicenna’s Neoplatonic\nontology). Each of level of immaterial dominating lights is associated\nwith a celestial sphere. They are no longer limited to\nal-Farabi’s (d.950) nine spheres or to those and their\n“varying number of subordinate spherical bodies” Avicenna\nsuggested with his “second kinematic model” (Janos 2011,\n172–9). This development may have inspired Suhrawardi’s\nindefinite, though not infinite, number of immaterial dominating\n(qahira) lights that are more “than ten, or twenty, or\none hundred, or […], or a hundred thousand”, lights that\nare, in fact, as numerous as the stars in the fixed heavens\n(PI, §151; Arslan 2014, 138–9).  \nThe vertical hierarchy of immaterial dominating lights interacts with\na second horizontal order of dominating lights. Some are equal to\nothers, “because the higher lights possess many luminous aspects\nor interact with each other, the existence of other equal dominating\nlights may occur from them […]. Thus, among the dominating\nlights are mother-lights (ummahat) — the fundamental\nvertical lights with few and substantial intermediaries — while\nother are lights horizontal in their ranks from intermediate\nrays” (PI, §183, 154–5). This second\nhorizontal hierarchy of dominating (qawahir) lights is, at\ntimes, associated with ‘managing angels’ (PI,\n§248, 259, 269–70) (perhaps equal in number to celestial\nbodies; at times, referring to ancient Semitic angelic hierarchies and\nZoroastrian mythology).  \nBut more importantly, some of the horizontal self-subsisting and\nincorporeal dominating lights are identified as formal dominating\nlights, as ‘Lords of Species’ (archetypes) or\n‘idols’ (arbab al-asnam): “though they are\nnot imprinted in the barriers (bodies), they occur from each master of\nan idol in its barrier shadow with respect to some exalted luminous\naspect” (PI, 155). These are, at times, labelled the\nPlatonic Forms (muthul Aflatun) (located perhaps at the lower\nthreshold of the world of souls), which Suhrawardi incorporates into\nhis metaphysics, over which rules the Light of Lights (PI,\n§§246–8; Suh. 1999, 111). Each of those eternal,\nunchanging and pure luminous lights can differ in kind without\ndiffering in ontological level. They are “lights of equal\nstrength” that “differ from others of the same strength by\nluminous and dark accidents”, some of the lights of this\nhorizontal order being “the efficient, not the formal, causes of\nnatural kinds” (Walbridge 2017, 270; Suh. 1993a, 67–8;\nPI, §§94–5, 164–71). The function of\nthose Platonic Forms is analogous to the archetypal Forms of Plato,\nbut only in so far as they govern various species whose exemplars they\nexistentiate (rather than being mere universals), such as the species\nof bodies that move the celestial spheres and being the cosmological\nefficient causes of all sublunar matters, including human souls\n(Walbridge 1992, 61–6, 2017, 270–1).  \nOut of the interaction of the irradiations of the vertical and the\nhorizontal lights, the bodies of the lower world are generated. These\ntwo hierarchies of lights are structurally interrelated through the\nprinciple domination (qahr) that the higher lights have over\nthe lower ones and the principle of desire and love (mahabba)\nthat the lower lights have for the higher lights (PI,\n§§152–6). The increase of dominating immaterial lights\nand the introduction of a second order of horizontal lights (the\nPlatonic Forms) enabled the possibility of simple effects from\ncomposite causes (PI, §§94–5). The two\ndimensional hierarchy of lights introduces a new nonlinear and\ncomposite notion of metaphysical causation. The multiplication of\nmetaphysical entities increases the ontological distance that exists\nbetween the Light of Lights and the sublunar world, while\nsimultaneously providing a greater holistic view of reality, since\nlight lies at its core. Notions of intensity and gradation of light,\ntogether with notions of presence and self-manifestation, are thus\ncentral to Suhrawardi’s metaphysics. The intensity of light\ncorresponds to the degree of the lights self-awareness. Similarly, the\nself-awareness of the Light of Lights encompasses, with varying\ndegrees of intensity, all the other constitutive lights of reality.\nLater, Mulla Sadra (d.1636) will take up Suhrawardi’s insight\nabout the gradation and intensity of light and develop an ontology\ngrounded in the gradation of existence (rather than light) of all\nbeings, somehow reversing Suhrawardi’s ontology with his primacy\nof existence and his understanding of essence as a mental concept.\n \nWith his metaphysic of lights, Suhrawardi proposes what he may have\ndeemed a more satisfying argument for the difficult philosophical and\ntheological problem of God’s knowledge of particulars. The\nconcepts of self-knowledge and knowledge by presence, at the heart of\nthe knowledge by presence of all light-beings, provides a means to\nexplain God’s self-awareness, as the Light of Lights, as well as\nIts self-knowledge and It’s knowledge of all things other than\nitself (creation), such as particulars. Knowledge by presence serves\nto explain the presence of God’s knowledge of Itself to Itself,\nas it does for the self-knowledge of all beings of light: “Its\nknowledge of Its essence is Its being a light in Its essence and\nevident to Its essence”. At the same time, God is able to be\naware of what is other than It, such that “Its knowledge of\nthings is their being evident to It, either in themselves or in their\nconnections” (PI, §162). Hence, God’s\nknowledge by presence is now conceived in terms of the\n“existence of a ‘relation’ (idafa) between\nit and whatever is known to it”, whereby this “purely\nrelational” nature of God’s knowledge enables the Light of\nLight to know material particulars without there being any changes or\neffects on its light substance (Sinai 2013, 320–1, 2016,\n288–93; Eichner 2001, 137–9). For a good overview of\nSuhrawardi’s light ontology, see Walbridge (1992, 40–78,\n2004, 212–6).  \nAbout half a century earlier than Ibn ‘Arabi (d.1240),\nSuhrawardi introduces an independent ‘world of images’\n– what Corbin labelled the mundus imaginalis, a fourth\nontological level (later rejected by Mulla Sadra, see Landolt 2017).\nVan Lit (2017, 7) prefers the translation ‘world of\nimages’ (or ’imaginable world’) over Corbin’s\n‘imaginal world’ to render Suhrawardi’s concept of\n‘ alam al-mithal. This fourth world lies alongside the\nthree worlds (i) of the intelligible or of the dominating\n(qahira) lights, (ii) of the spiritual, i.e. a soul\nassociated with a body, either human or celestial, or the managing\n(mudabbira) lights, and (iii) of the material or the\n‘barriers’ (barzakhiyan) (PI,\n§246). This independent ‘world of immaterial shapes’\n(ashbah murajjada) or images (suwar) operates like\nan ‘isthmus’ or an ‘intermediary realm’ of\n“dark and illuminated suspended images (suwar\nmu‘allaqa)”. It lies somewhere between the physical\nworld of darkness and the world of the ‘Lords of the\nspecies’ (arbab al-anwa‘), i.e. the world of the\nPlatonic Forms of ‘pure Lights’ (horizontal lights). This\nfourth ‘world of images’ is where new entities – the\n‘suspended forms’ (muthul mu‘allaqa)\n– exist and which post-mortem souls grasp with their\nimagination. Suhrawardi actually expands on Avicenna’s\nsuggestion that imagination has an important eschatological function\nto explain the fate of souls in the Afterlife (cf. van Lit, 2017,\n20–47).  \nWith the introduction of this ‘world of images’ ,\nSuhrawardi sought to account for entities that possess an existence of\ntheir own (some, prior to their coming into existence in this world).\nThe ‘world of images’ contains ‘suspended\nforms’ that are not embedded in matter, this world being\nconceived as a plane of “ghosts, of the forms in mirrors,\ndreams, and worlds of wonder beyond our own” which light can\nexistentiate (Walbridge 2000, 26). The ‘world of images’\nprovides the material for mystical visions and the miraculous.  \nIt is where those “who have attained an intermediate bliss and\nthe ascetics […] may escape”, a place where they\n“can and do bring images into beings”, where\neschatological forms and images will be existentiated for the souls of\nthe deceased so that they may continue to perfect their souls, where\n“all the promises of prophecies find their reality through\nit” (PI, §§244–8), as well as where\nelements not fitting conveniently into the Aristotelian scheme of\nforms in matter are found.  \nThe world of ‘suspended images’ is distinct from the Forms\nof Plato (muthul Aflatun) that are “are luminous, while\nsome of the suspended forms are dark and others illuminated”\n(PI, §246). The ‘world of images’ is where\nimages and suspended forms are found that are perceived by the\nsoul’s imaginative power (PI, §225). Suhrawardi\nnotes, “Whoever sees that station knows with certainty the\nexistence of a world other than that of barriers (barazikh;\ni.e. bodies). In it are self-subsistent [lit.: suspended] images\n(muthul mu‘allaqa)” (PI, §259),\nalthough those suspended forms “are in neither a place nor a\nlocus” (PI, §225; see van Lit 2017). More\nimportantly, Suhrawardi’s ‘world of images’ and\nsuspended forms plays a novel eschatological function, ensuring that\nimperfect souls may experience posthumously the pains and pleasures of\ndivine retribution by providing an ‘objective’ status to\nthose ‘real’ experiences. (PI, §§\n244–6; Sinai 2015, 280–1; van Lit 2017, 37–78) (see\n3.1). Suhrawardi did not conceptualize systematically his ‘world\nof images’ and ‘suspended forms’. Hence, from the\nthirteen century up to the twenty-first century, quite a few\ncommentators have delved deeper into the matter (van Lit 2017,\n142–75).  \nSuhrawardi’s Philosophy of Illumination carries a\npolitical dimension. Ziai (1992) provides an overview of what he calls\nhis ‘Illuminationist political doctrine’: it establishes a\nconnection between political authority, just rule, and the\nruler’s access to divine light. For instance, in Tablets to\n‘Imad (Suh. 1993c, 186–8 [Pers.]), Suhrawardi\nintroduces two Zoroastrian terms kharrah (xwarrah)\nand farrah (Avesta/Pahlavi) to allude to the divine/regal\nlight that was bestowed upon ancient kings; in the Book of\nRadiance, it is the Light of Lights that bestows upon them\nluminous glory and power (kharra-yi kayani) (Suh. 1998,\n84–5, cf. 1993c, 81; Gnoli 1999); and in the Philosophy of\nIllumination, it corresponds to the light of the Kingdom of Power\n(malakut) that Kay Khusraw and Zarathustra were able to\nbehold (PI, §§165–6; cf. 1993a, 502–5).\n \nThis political ‘doctrines’ provides indications of the\nconditions able to guarantee the reign of the just rule, thus\nproviding elements of an Illuminationist political ethic of the\nSage-ruler. However, the general framework of the ethics underlying\nSuhrawardi’s ishraqi system requires further\ninvestigation. His particularly Platonic understanding of the mystic\nqua ruler and his political role, coupled with the role of intuitive\nor ‘mystical’ access to the ‘divine’ lights by\nprophets, mystics and sages might, however, not leave Suhrawardi\nimmune to the same criticism Popper leveled against Plato.  \nSuhrawardi may, in fact, appeal to a somewhat\n‘mythological’ genealogy of the transmission of ancient\nIllumination/ishraqi philosophies from the Greek/West and the\nIranian/East which he claims to revive. Ziai (1992, 337; cf. Walbridge\n2000, 201–10) speculates that he tried to put into practice the\npolitical dimension (i.e. a ‘new’ political doctrine) of\nhis ishraqi philosophy, based mainly on passages from his\nworks and considering the possible circumstances of his demise and\nexecution. Historical data supporting the thesis, Suhrawardi’s\nrelationship with his many patrons and the purpose of passages\nrelating to these Illuminationist political doctrines need further\nexamination to confirm the claim (Marcotte 2001a, 415–6).  \nSuhrawardi’s eschatology — the Return — and his\ndiscussions on the fate of the soul in the afterlife offers a glimpse\nof what might constitute a ‘good’ and ethical life in this\nworld. In line with Avicenna’s classification of souls in the\nhereafter according to their worldly acquisition of practical and\ntheoretical knowledge, the moral qualities developed in this life\ndetermine the fate of souls in the afterlife (PI,\n§§244–8). In search of felicity, souls must attempt to\ndetach themselves from their tenebrous bodies and all that is worldly\nand material and seek to access the world of immaterial lights. Souls\nengrossed in matter in this life partially determine their fate in the\nafterlife. In this respect, Suhrawardi does not depart greatly from\nAvicenna’s Peripatetic eschatology (see 4.3).  \nProphets, saints and exceptionally gifted mystics are the ones best\nable to achieve conjunction with the world of pure lights. Ascetic\npractices in this life can become a means to attain self-consciousness\nof the ontic light reality of the soul. Some of Suhrawardi’s\nallegorical and mystical treatises, like The Treatise of the\nBird, A Tale of Occidental Exile or A Day with a\nGroup of Sufis (Suh. 1993b, 274–97, 1999b, 2001, 1976),\nprovide examples of the pedagogical role and instruction of the guide\nfigure, of the Lord of the human species, or of spiritual entities to\nthe novice in his or her quest for the immaterial world of lights in\nwhich salvation lies. The posthumous life of individual souls and\ntheir ability to perceive the promised other-worldly rewards and\npunishments become conditions for divine retribution.  \nSuhrawardi’s tragic end marked the beginning of a long history\nof commentaries by both proponents and detractors of his novel\nreassessment of the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition. By the end of the\n13th century, at least two of his works were readily\navailable and studied in the major centers of learning of Syria\n(Damascus and Aleppo), Iraq (Baghdad) and Iran (Maraghah), some of\nwhich circulating most probably before his death. Two major trends\nwithin the commentarial tradition of the 13th century were\nto shape later developments: one wass exemplified by Ibn Kammuna\n(d.1284) who emphasizes the “purely discursive and the more\nsystematically philosophical” aspects of Suhrawardi’s\nworks, and the other was exemplified by Shahrazuri (d.ca.1288) who\nfocuses on, and expands the symbolic and the allegorical aspects of\nwhat came to be known as the ishraqi tradition (Ziai 2003,\n473–87).  \nIbn Kammuna, a Jewish philosopher greatly influenced by both Avicenna\nand Suhrawardi, is the first commentator (Langermann 2005,\n297–301; Pourjavady and Schmidtke 2006, 23–32; Eichner\n2010) who, while in Baghdad, completes in 1268 his commentary on the\nlogic, physics and the metaphysics of Intimations (Ibn\nKammuna 2003, 2009). Having resided in Aleppo, he could well be, with\nsuch works as The Revealer, completed in 1278 (2008;\nLangermann 2005), the link between Suhrawardi and Shahrazuri who\nwrites the earliest commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (ca. 1286), after having written a commentary on\nIntimations (Shahrazuri 1993; cf. Marcotte 2002).\nShahrazuri’s encyclopedic Metaphysical Tree, also\nwritten before his commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shahrazuri, 2004 and 2005 [a better edition]),\nwould contain some ishraqi elements, although it remains to\nbe ascertained whether his Divine Symbols and Proverbs does\n(Privot\n 2004).[2] \nMore work is needed to determine the extent and the nature of\nShahrazuri’s contribution to what came to be known as an\n‘Illuminationist’ tradition. Van Lit (2017, 79–112)\nprovides a good example of how focussing on a particular doctrinal\nelement can yield much insight into Shahrazuri’s contribution,\nnamely giving expression and stabalising the name of the ‘world\nof images’, its location and topography, the means to access it,\nits reality, etc. (see also Marcotte 2001b, 2002). In 1295, Qutb\nal-Din Shirazi completes his own commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shirazi 2001; Suh. 1986), which supplanted\nShahrazuri’s commentary (Walbridge 1992).  \nAuthors that incorporated or commented and discussed isharaqi\nideas include (Isma‘il ibn) Muhammad Ibn Rizi (fl.ca.1280), in\nhis Life of Souls (Marcotte 2004); Athir al-Din al-Abhari\n(d.1242) in a number of his works (Eichner 2012); ‘Allamah Hilli\n(d.1325), who pens a commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (now lost), and solutions to issues raised in\nSuhrawardi’s Intimations (completed before 1293) and\nOpposites; Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani (d.1414) writes a\ncommentary on the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290–2); Ibn Abi Jumhur Ahsa’i (d.1501) (Schmidtke 2000);\nNajm al-Din Mahmud al-Nayrizi (d.ca.1526), a critic of Suhrawardi,\ncompletes in 1526 his commentary on Tablets to ‘Imad\n(Pourjavady 2011, 131–6, 137–52); the two theologians\nJalal al-Din al-Dawani (d.1501) and Ghiyath al-Din al-Dashtaki\n(d.1542) write commentaries on his Temples of Light (Dawani\n1953; Dashtaki 2003; Suh. 1996); and ‘Abd al-Razzaq (Fayyaz)\nLahiji (d.1667), one of Mulla Sadra’s students, would have also\nwritten a commentary on Temples of Light.  \nMulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi) (d.1636), who was most interested\nin Suhrawardi’s critique of Avicennan Peripateticism (existence\nas a being of reason, the Platonic forms, knowledge by presence,\neschatology), writes marginal glosses on the Philosophy of\nIllumination and on Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi’s commentary on\nthe work (Mulla Sadra 2010; cf. Suh. 1986; Landolt 2017). Mulla Sadra,\nlike Hadi Sabzawari (d.1873), upholds the principality of existence\n(wujud), in opposition to what he understood to be\nSuhrawardi’s view that quiddity was primary over existence, a\nview shared by Mir Damad (d.1631) (cf. his Spiritual\nAttractions [2001] and Divine Embers [2001]).  \nDuring the same period, Suhrawardi’s works enter the Turkish\nOttoman and Persian Indian philosophical traditions. In the Ottoman\nworld, Isma‘il Ankaravi (d.1631), a member of the Mevlevi Sufi\norder, translates and comments Temples of Light in his\nElucidation of Wisdoms (Kuspinar 1996). During the\n17th century, the enigmatic Ahmad Ibn al-Harawi (probably\nfrom Herat), who lived in the Indian subcontinent, translates the\nPhilosophy of Illumination into Persian on which he writes a\ncommentary (Harawi 1979). Azar Kayvan (d.ca.1615), a Zoroastrian high\npriest from Fars, who emigrated to Gujurat in Mughal India during the\nreign of Emperor Akbar (r.1556–1605), starts a Zoroastrian\nishraqi school (Walbridge 2001, 91–3). Muhammad\n‘Ali Hazin Lahiji (d.1667) writes a commentary on\nSuhrawardi’s Words of Sufism (Suh. 2001, 101–39;\n1993d), along with glosses and notes on three other of his works,\nincluding the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290–2). Even thinkers of the 20th century, such as\nMuhammad Kazim ‘Assar (d.1975) and his discussion of\n“equivocal being”, have been influenced by\nishraqielements (Ziai 2003, 472). Van Lit provides a\nchronological sketch of eighteen commentators on Suhrawardi, including\nlesser-known ones (2018, 548–53). Cataloguing and making\naccessible hundreds of philosophical works in Arabic and Persian from\nthe 12th–19th century, like the recent\npublication of the Persian Inner Light (2012) of Shihab\nal-Din Kumijani (d.1895), are bound to shed new light on\nSuhrawardi’s legacy.  \nAlthough very little has been written on the history of the\nphilosophical legacy of Suhrawardi’s novel ishraqi\nideas and doctrines, how is one to understand claims made about the\nexistence of a truly original and distinct ‘Illuminationist\ntradition’? Some are more cautious in their assessment of\nSuhrawardi’s project and legacy. Van Lit (2017, 2–3,\n6–7), for example, questions Corbin and others who have deemed\nwhat is often labelled the ‘Illuminationist’ or\nisraqi tradition a ‘school of thought’, and offer\na corrective assessment with his detailed study on the notion of\n– suspended images – and the ‘world of image’.\nLandolt (2008, 235) also nuanced such claims, like those of Ziai\namongst others, regarding the existence of a truly Suhrawardian\n‘Illuninationist’ tradition conceived as a philosohpical\n(hikma) system radically different from Avicenna’s\nPeripateticism. Suhrawardi’s project needs to be recast as a\ncritique of the latter’s brand of Peripateticism, similar to the\nvarious critiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and\nal-Ghazali(d.1111), etc.  \nTwo main schools of thought dominate the historiography of the\nIlluminationist tradition. The first, more prevalent and older school,\nviews Suhrawardi as the founder of a mystical, or\n‘theosophical’ tradition. Henry Corbin, the father of\ncontemporary Suhrawardiana studies, introduced this paradigm\n(Gutas 2002, 16–9).  \nHis interest in the Shaykh al-ishraq rested primarily with\nthe latter’s hikmat al-ishraq, Corbin’s\n‘Oriental theosophy’ — the lost mythological\ntraditions of the Ancient sages of the West and the East —\nSuhrawardi was reviving, also with his Persian allegories, (views\nshared by Nasr). Interested mainly in his mystical views and\nmetaphysics of light and irradiation, he saw little interest in\nediting Suhrawardi’s works on logic and physics. These\n‘gnostic’/‘mystic’,\n‘esoteric’/‘theosophical’ wisdom, or even\npre-Aristotelian philosophia perennis or universalis\n(Nasr 1964, 60–3) approaches to Suhrawardi’s works often\noveremphasize the mystical and the theosophical at the expense of the\nphilosophical, and thus blur the distinction between philosophy,\ntheology and mysticism (cf. Pourjavady 2013). Proponents of this\napproach highlight Suhrawardi’s aim to expound on\nAvicenna’s incomplete project to develop an\n‘Eastern’ (mashriqiyya) (not\n‘illuminative’) philosophy of Khurasan, in spite of the\nfact that Avicenna’s ‘Eastern’ philosophy was not a\nmystical enterprise; rather, it aimed at developing a philosophical\ntradition distinct from the ‘Western’ philosophical school\nof Baghdad (Gutas 2000). Many scholars often overlook the fact that\nSuhrawardi’s major works are largely devoted to technical\nphilosophical questions and theories of which even his allegorical or\nminor works are not devoid. More generally, the proponents of the\nmystical approach interpret Suhrawardi’s ishraqiviews\nas a break or a departure from the philosophical tradition. Some, like\nFakhry (1982), go so far as to question the originality of the\nisharqi elements of his work, deeming it a mere transposition\nof Avicennan philosophy into a light terminology.  \nThe second, more recent school, views the novel elements of\nSuhrawardi’s ishraqi system as an original\nphilosophical ‘critique’ — in the wake of the\nreassessments of Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and\nal-Ghazali — a reconfiguration of Avicennan Peripateticism, an\ninterpretation adopted by a great many of his medieval commentators.\nSome contemporary commentators, like Izutsu (1971), explore the\nanalytical aspect of Suhrawardi’s work; others, like Mehdi\nHa’iri Yazdi (1992) and Jalal al-Din Ashtiyani, propose\n‘Neo-Avicennan’ interpretations of the ishraqi\ntradition (Amin Razavi 2013, xvii–xix). Ziai (1990) focuses\nprimarily on his logic; whereas Walbridge (1992) studied, first, the\nwork of Qutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311), and then the philosophical\nheritage of Ancient sages and wisdoms (Greeks, Stoic, Platonic, etc.;\npre-Socratics; Persians, etc.) of Suhrawardi’s ishraqi\nsystem (2000, 2001, etc.).  \nWhile some, like Corbin (1971), Nasr (1964) and Mohammad Mo’in\n(1948, 1950), view Suhrawardi as the reviver of some ancient form of\nPersian philosophy; some, like Shahab Ahmed (d. 2015) have\noveremphasized his role within the Islamic\n East[3];\n still others are more skeptical. For example, Ziai (2003, 484) notes\nthe absence of an independent textual Persian philosophical tradition,\nalthough he believes that the Islamic ishraqi philosophical\ntradition incorporated “Mazdayasnian sentiments kept alive in\npopular and oral traditions and in poetic, epic and mystical\ncompositions”. Gutas (2003) also notes the lack of any textual\nevidence to support claims that Suhrawardi attempted to revive ancient\nWestern Greek, Gnostic, and Hermetic traditions and suggests focusing\nresearch on the reasons why Suhrawardi appeals to the authority of the\n‘Ancients’, East and West, rather than trying to find\n‘real’ historical filiations to sources to which he\nmight have had access.  \nSince the 1990s, interest in Suhrawardi’s work and\nishraqi philosophical system and its reception was rekindled\n(Ziai 1990; Walbridge 1992, 2000, 2001; Amin Razavi 2004). However,\nalthough some recent scholarship has focused on his critique of\nAvicennan Peripatetic views, as well as explored a number of more\nspecific logical, physical, psychological, epistemological,\nontological, and metaphysical issues of Suhrawardi’s major\nArabic works, further studies is still needed to add to our knowledge\nof the influence of Avicenna’s major works (Cure,\nPointers and Reminders, even Discussions),\nas well as the influence of the Arabic Platonic and Neoplatonic\ntraditions in the form they would have been available to him. Eichner\n(2011, 140) suggests any “interpretation of Suhrawardian texts\nmust avoid simply assuming that they were rendered correctly by later\ninterpretations, which sought to present a unified and coherent\naccount of his system and the relation of that system to\nPeripateticism”. This methodological principle would help\nrevisit Suhrawardi’s work, and to produce much-needed studies on\nthe works of authors who belonged to, or were influenced by various\nand novel ishraqi elements (cf. Gheissari et al.\n2018), to chart the complex historical and philosophical developments\nof what was to become known as a novel ‘Illuminationist’\ntradition. This would undoubtedly provide new insights into his\ndistinctly Platonic reworking of Avicennan Peripateticism, what Gutas\n(2002) has identified as Suhrawardi’s ‘Illuminationist\nAvicennism’.","contact.mail":"marcotte.roxanne@uqam.ca","contact.domain":"uqam.ca"}]
