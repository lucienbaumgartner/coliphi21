The\nmind in question is typically taken to be supernatural.\nPhilosophically inclined thinkers have both historically and at\npresent labored to shape the relevant intuition into a more formal,\nlogically rigorous inference. The resultant theistic arguments, in\ntheir various logical forms, share a focus on plan, purpose,\nintention, and design, and are thus classified as teleological\narguments (or, frequently, as arguments from or to design).\n\n\nAlthough enjoying some prominent defenders over the centuries, such\narguments have also attracted serious criticisms from major historical\nand contemporary thinkers. Both critics and advocates are found not\nonly among philosophers, but come from scientific and other\ndisciplines as well. In the following discussion, major variant forms\nof teleological arguments will be distinguished and explored,\ntraditional philosophical and other criticisms will be discussed, and\nthe most prominent contemporary turns (cosmic fine tuning arguments,\nmany-worlds theories, and the Intelligent Design debate) will be\ntracked. Discussion will conclude with a brief look at one\nhistorically important non-inferential approach to the issue.\n\nIt is not uncommon for humans to find themselves with the intuition\nthat random, unplanned, unexplained accident just\ncouldn’t produce the order, beauty, elegance, and\nseeming purpose that we experience in the natural world around us. As\nHume’s interlocutor Cleanthes put it, we seem to see “the\nimage of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects” in\nnature. (Hume 1779 [1998], 35). And many people find themselves\nconvinced that no explanation for that mind-resonance which\nfails to acknowledge a causal role for intelligence, intent and\npurpose in nature can be seriously plausible. \nCosmological arguments often begin with the bare fact that there are\ncontingently existing things and end with conclusions concerning the\nexistence of a cause with the power to account for the\nexistence of those contingent things. Others reason from the\npremise that the universe has not always existed to a cause that\nbrought it into being. Teleological arguments (or arguments from\ndesign) by contrast begin with a much more specialized catalogue\nof properties and end with a conclusion concerning the existence of a\ndesigner with the intellectual properties (knowledge,\npurpose, understanding, foresight, wisdom, intention) necessary to\ndesign the things exhibiting the special properties in\nquestion. In broad outline, then, teleological arguments focus upon\nfinding and identifying various traces of the operation of a mind in\nnature’s temporal and physical structures, behaviors and paths.\nOrder of some significant type is usually the starting point\nof design arguments.  \nDesign-type arguments are largely unproblematic when based upon things\nnature clearly could not or would not produce (e.g.,\nmost human artifacts), or when the intelligent agency is itself\n‘natural’ (human, alien, etc.). Identifying designed\ntraces of ‘lost’ human civilizations or even non-human\ncivilizations (via SETI) could in principle be uncontroversial.\nObjections to design inferences typically arise only when the posited\ndesigner is something more exotic or perhaps supernatural.  \nBut despite the variety of spirited critical attacks they have\nelicited, design arguments have historically had and continue to have\nwidespread intuitive appeal—indeed, it is sometimes claimed that\ndesign arguments are the most persuasive of all purely philosophical\ntheistic arguments. Note that while design arguments have\ntraditionally been employed to support theism over metaphysical\nnaturalism, some might also be relevant for panentheism, panpsychism,\nand other views involving irreducible teleology. \nThe historical arguments of interest are precisely the potentially\nproblematic ones—inferences beginning with some empirical\nfeatures of nature and concluding with the existence of a designer. A\nstandard but separable second step—the natural theology\nstep—involves identifying the designer as God, often via\nparticular properties and powers required by the designing in\nquestion. Although the argument wielded its greatest intellectual\ninfluence during the 18th and early 19th centuries, it goes back at\nleast to the Greeks and in extremely clipped form comprises one of\nAquinas’s Five Ways. It was given a fuller and quite nice early\nstatement by Hume’s interlocutor Cleanthes (1779 [1998],\n15). \nThe question remains, however, about the formal structure of such\narguments. What sort of logic is being employed? As it turns out, that\nquestion does not have just a single answer. Several distinct answers\nare canvassed in the following sections. \nDesign arguments are routinely classed as analogical\narguments—various parallels between human artifacts and certain\nnatural entities being taken as supporting parallel conclusions\nconcerning operative causation in each case. The standardly ascribed\nschema is roughly thus: \nSchema 1: \nTherefore \n(The relevant respects and properties R are referred to\nvariously as teleological properties or as marks or\nsigns of design, and objects having such properties are\nsometimes referred to as teleological objects. For simplicity\nand uniformity of discussion, I shall simply talk in terms of\n“Rs”.) \nThis general argument form was criticized quite vigorously by Hume, at\nseveral key steps. (Hume’s primary critical discussion is\ncontained in (Hume 1779 [1998]). Hume’s responses are widely\ntaken as the paradigm philosophical refutation of traditional design\narguments.) Against (1), Hume argued that the analogy is not very\ngood—that nature and the various things in it are not\nvery like human artifacts and exhibit substantial differences\nfrom them—e.g., living vs. not, self-sustaining vs. not. Indeed,\nwhereas advocates of design arguments frequently cited similarities\nbetween the cosmos on the one hand and human machines on the other,\nHume suggested (tongue perhaps only partly in cheek) that the cosmos\nmuch more closely resembled a living organism than a machine. But if\nthe alleged resemblance is in relevant respects distant, then the\ninference in question will be logically fragile. And while (2) may be\ntrue in specific cases of human artifacts a, that fact is\nonly made relevant to natural phenomena e via (3), which\nunderpins the transfer of the key attribution. Against (3), Hume\nargued that any number of alternative possible explanations could be\ngiven of allegedly designed entities in nature—chance, for\ninstance. Thus, even were (1) true and even were there\nimportant resemblances, the argument might confer little probabilistic\nforce onto the conclusion. \nMore generally, Hume also argued that even if something like the\nstated conclusion (4) were established, that left the arguer far from\nanything like a traditional conception of God. For instance, natural\nevils or apparently suboptimal designs might suggest e.g., an amateur\ndesigner or a committee of designers. And if phenomena instrumental to\nthe production of natural evils (e.g., disease microorganisms)\nexhibited various of the Rs, then they would presumably have\nto be laid at the designer’s door, further eroding the\ndesigner’s resemblance to the wholly good deity of tradition.\nAnd even the most impressive empirical data could properly establish\nonly finite (although perhaps enormous) power and wisdom, rather than\nthe infinite power and wisdom usually associated with divinity. But\neven were one to concede some substance to the design argument’s\nconclusion, that would, Hume suggested, merely set up a regress. The\ndesigning agent would itself demand explanation, requiring ultimately\na sequence of prior analogous intelligences producing intelligences.\nAnd even were the existence of a designer of material things\nestablished, that did not yet automatically establish the existence of\na creator of the matter so shaped. And since analogical\narguments are a type of induction (see the entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning),\n the conclusion even if established would be established only to some,\nperhaps insignificant, degree of probability. Furthermore, we could\nnot ground any induction concerning the cosmos itself upon a requisite\nfund of experiences of other cosmoi found to be both deliberately\ndesigned and very like ours in relevant respects—for\nthe simple reason that this universe is our only sample. And finally\nthe fraction of this one cosmos (both spatially and temporally)\navailable to our inspection is extraordinarily small—not a\npromising basis for a cosmically general conclusion. Hume concluded\nthat while the argument might constitute some limited grounds for\nthinking that “the cause or causes of order in the universe\nprobably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence”\n(Hume 1779 [1998], 88) Hume’s emphasis)—and that is not a\ntrivial implication—it established nothing else whatever. \nHistorically, not everyone agreed that Hume had fatally damaged the\nargument. It is simply not true that explanatory inferences cannot\nproperly extend beyond merely what is required for known effects. As a\nvery general example, based on the few observations which humans had\nmade during a cosmically brief period in a spatially tiny part of the\ncosmos, Newton theorized that all bits of matter at\nall times and in all places attracted all\nother bits of matter. There was nothing whatever logically suspect\nhere. Indeed, simplicity and uniformity considerations—which\nhave considerable well-earned scientific clout—push in the\ndirection of such generalizations. \nBut Hume certainly identified important places within the argument to\nprobe. First, any two (groups of) things have infinitely many\nproperties in common and also differ in infinitely many respects.\nWhether or not artifacts and natural objects are alike in ways that\nwould support transfer of design attributions from the former to the\nlatter depends upon exactly what the relevant Rs are. Second,\nwhether there really are alternative means of producing Rs\nindependent of any mind input is often an empirical matter, which\ncannot be settled either way by simple stipulation. On the other hand,\nwhether some of Hume’s own remarks are to the point depends upon\nwhether or not the strongest design arguments are analogical. And\nwhether Hume’s suggestions are correct concerning the uncertain\ncharacter of any designer inferred will depend upon the specific\nRs and upon what can or cannot be definitively said\nconcerning requirements for their production. \nKey questions, then, include: what are the relevant Rs\ntypically cited? do those Rs genuinely signal purpose and\ndesign? how does one show that either way? are there viable\nalternative accounts of the Rs requiring no reference to\nminds? how does one show that either way? The specific\nRs in question are obviously central to design argument\nefforts. Although the underlying general category is, again, some\nspecial type of orderliness, the specifics have ranged rather widely\nhistorically. Among the more straightforwardly empirical are inter\nalia uniformity, contrivance, adjustment of means to ends,\nparticularly exquisite complexity, particular types of functionality,\ndelicacy, integration of natural laws, improbability, and the fitness\n(fine-tuning) of the inorganic realm for supporting life. Several\nproblematic proposals that are empirically further removed and have\naxiological overtones have also been advanced, including the\nintelligibility of nature, the directionality of evolutionary\nprocesses, aesthetic characteristics (beauty, elegance, and the like),\napparent purpose and value (including the aptness of our world for the\nexistence of moral value and practice) and just the sheer niftiness of\nmany of the things we find in nature. \nMany of the specific Rs advanced historically were vulnerable\nto substantive critiques, often increasingly so as time went on.\nSpecifically, while it was clearly evident that various\na’s had the R character they did in virtue of\ntheir (human) intentional production, it was much more difficult\nestablishing that any or all other occurrences of R likely\nowed their existence to intention as well. As the standard story has\nit, science increasingly acquired understandings of how nature unaided\nby deliberate intent and planning could produce virtually any\nR proposed, and thus while (2) might continue to hold for\nvirtually any human artifact a having any intended R\none might please, (3)—and the inference to (4)—became\nprogressively less defensible. Design, on this telling, might\ngradually be explained away. \nBut some advocates of design arguments had been reaching for a deeper\nintuition. The intuition they were attempting to capture involved\nproperties that in and of themselves constituted some degree of\nevidence for design—properties that were not merely constantly\nconjoined, for whatever reason, with instances of design. The specific\nRs were singled out not just because such properties happened\nto be often or even only produced by designing agents. (Garbage heaps\nfit that description.) Advocates were convinced that the\nappropriate Rs in question were in their own right directly\nreflective of and redolent of cognition, that this directly suggested\nmind, that we could see nearly directly that they were the\ngeneral sort of thing that a mind might or even\nwould generate, and that consequently they did not depend for\ntheir evidential force upon previously established constant\nconjunctions or other associations with known instances of design.\nWhen we see a text version of the Gettysburg Address, that text says\nmind to us in a way totally unrelated to any\ninduction or analogy from past encounters with\nwritten texts. It was that type of testimony to mind, to design, that\nsome historical advocates of design arguments believed that they found\nin some Rs observed in nature—a testimony having no\ndependency on induction or analogy. Beauty, purpose and in general\nvalue especially when conjoined with delicate complexity were\npopular underlying intuitive marks. Intricate, dynamic, stable,\nfunctioning order of the sort we encounter in nature was frequently\nplaced in this category. Such order was taken to be suggestive of\nminds in that it seemed nearly self-evidently the sort of thing minds,\nand so far as was definitively known, only minds were prone to\nproduce. It was a property whose mind-resonating character we\ncould unhesitatingly attribute to intent. \nDespite Hume’s earlier demurs that things in nature are not\nreally very like artifacts such as machines, most people (including\nopponents of design arguments) who are most familiar with\nnature’s dazzling intricacies freely admit that nature abounds\nwith things that look designed—that are\nintention-shaped. For instance, Francis Crick (no fan of\ndesign) issued a warning to his fellow biologists: \nAlong with this perception of mind-suggestiveness went a further\nprinciple—that the mind-suggestive or intention-shaped (the\ndesign-like) characteristics in question were too palpable to\nhave been generated by non-intentional means. \nThat allows specification of a second design inference pattern: \nSchema 2: \nTherefore \nNotice that explicit reference to human artifacts has dropped\nout of the argument, and that the argument is no longer comparative\nbut has become essentially deductive. Some arguments were historically\nintended as arguments of that type. Consider the widely reproduced\nopening passages of William Paley’s 1802 Natural\n Theology:[1] \nAlthough Paley’s argument is routinely construed as analogical,\nit in fact contains an informal statement of the above variant\nargument type. Paley goes on for two chapters discussing the watch,\ndiscussing the properties in it which evince design, destroying\npotential objections to concluding design in the watch, and discussing\nwhat can and cannot be concluded about the watch’s designer. It\nis only then that entities in nature—e.g., the eye—come\nonto the horizon at all. Obviously, Paley isn’t making such\nheavy weather to persuade his readers to concede that the watch really\nis designed and has a designer. He is, in fact, teasing out the bases\nand procedures from and by which we should and should not reason about\ndesign and designers. Thus Paley’s use of the term\n‘inference’ in connection with the watch’s\n designer.[2] \nOnce having acquired the relevant principles, then in Chapter 3 of\nNatural Theology—“Application of the\nArgument”—Paley applies the same\nargument (vs. presenting us with the other half of the analogical\nargument) to things in nature. The cases of human artifacts and nature\nrepresent two separate inference instances: \nBut the instances are instances of the same inferential\nmove: \nThe watch does play an obvious and crucial role—but as a\nparadigmatic instance of design inferences rather than as the\nanalogical foundation for an inferential comparison. \nSchema 2, not being analogically structured, would not be vulnerable\nto the ills of\n analogy,[3]\n and not being inductive would claim more than mere probability for\nits conclusion. That is not accidental. Indeed, it has been argued\nthat Paley was aware of Hume’s earlier attacks on analogical\ndesign arguments, and deliberately structured his argument to avoid\nthe relevant pitfalls (Gillispie 1990, 214–229). \nFirst, how are we to assess the premises required by this schema?\nPremise (5), at least, is not particularly controversial even now.\nCrick’s earlier warning to biologists would have been pointless\nwere there no temptation toward design attributions, and even as\nimplacable a contemporary opponent of design arguments as Richard\nDawkins characterized biology as: \nDay-to-day contemporary biology is rife with terms like\n‘design’, ‘machine’, ‘purpose’ and\nallied terms. As historian of science Timothy Lenoir has remarked: \nWhether or not particular biological phenomena are designed, they are\nfrequently enough design-like to make design language not\nonly fit living systems extraordinarily well, but to undergird\ngeneration of fruitful theoretical conceptions as\n well.[4]\n Advocates of design arguments claim that the reason why theorizing\nas if organisms are designed meets with such success is that\norganisms are in fact designed. Those opposed would say that\nall teleological concepts in biology must, in one way or another, be\nreduced to natural selection. \nHowever principle (6) (that the relevant design-like properties are\nnot producible by unguided natural means) will be more problematic in\nevolutionary biology. What might be the rational justification for\n(6)? There are two broad possibilities. \n1. Empirical: induction. Induction essentially involves\nestablishing that some principle holds within the realm of our\nknowledge/experience (the sample cases), and then, subject to\ncertain constraints, generalizing the principle to encompass relevant\nareas beyond that realm (the test cases). The attempt to\nestablish the universality of a connection between having relevant\nRs and being a product of mind on the basis of an observed\nconsistent connection between having relevant Rs and being a\nproduct of mind within all (most) of the cases where both R\nwas exhibited and we knew whether or not the phenomenon in\nquestion was a product of mind, would constitute an inductive\ngeneralization. \nThis approach would suffer from a variety of weaknesses. The\nR-exhibiting things concerning which we knew whether they\nwere designed would be almost without exception human artifacts,\nwhereas the phenomena to which the generalization was being extended\nwould be almost without exception things in a very different\ncategory—things in nature. And, of course, the generalization in\nquestion could establish at best a probability, and a fairly modest\none at that. \n2. Conceptual. It might be held that (6) is known in the same\nconceptual, nearly a priori way in which we know\nthat textbooks are not producible by natural processes unaided by\nmind. And our conviction here is not based on any mere induction from\nprior experiences of texts. Texts carry with them essential marks of\nmind, and indeed in understanding a text we see at least partway into\nthe mind(s) involved. Various alien artifacts (if any)—of which\nwe have had no prior experience whatever—could fall into this\ncategory as well. Similarly, it has been held that we sometimes\nimmediately recognize that order of the requisite sort just\nis a sign of mind and intent. \nAlternatively, it could be argued that although there is a genuine\nconceptual link between appropriate Rs and mind, design,\nintent, etc., that typically our recognition of that link is\ntriggered by specific experiences with artifacts, or that our seeing\nthe connections in depth is best elicited by considerations involving\nartifacts. (Both Aristotle and Galileo held a correlate of this view\nconcerning our acquiring knowledge of the general principles governing\nnature.) On this view, once the truth of (6) became manifest to us\nthrough experiences of artifacts, the appropriateness of its more\ngeneral application would be clear. That might explain why so many\nadvocates of design arguments—both historical and\ncurrent—seem to believe that they must only display a\nfew cases and raise their eyebrows to gain assent to design. \nEither way, principle (6), or something like it, would be something\nwith which relevant design inferences would begin. Further\ninvestigation of (6) requires taking a closer look at the Rs\nwhich (6) involves. \nOne thing complicating general assessments of design arguments is that\nthe evidential force of specific Rs is affected by the\ncontext of their occurrence. Specifically, properties which seem\nclearly to constitute marks of design in known artifacts often seem to\nhave significantly less evidential import outside that context. For\ninstance, we typically construe enormous complexity in something known\nto be a manufactured artifact as a deliberately intended and produced\ncharacteristic. But mere complexity in contexts not taken to involve\nartifacts (the precise arrangement of pine needles on a forest floor,\nfor instance) does not seem to have that same force. In the case of\nnatural objects with evident artifactuality absent, it is less clear\nthat such complexity—as well as the other traditional empirical\nRs—bespeaks intention, plan and purpose. Similarly,\nabsolutely straight lines in an artifact are typically results of\ndeliberate intention. That straight lines traveled by light rays is so\nwould seem to many to be less obvious. \nFurthermore, even within those two contexts—artifact and\nnature—the various Rs exhibit varying degrees of\nevidential force. For instance, even in an artifact, mere complexity\nof whatever degree speaks less clearly of intent than does an engraved\nsentence. As most critics of design arguments point out, the examples\nfound in nature are not of the “engraved sentence”\nsort. \nThere are two crucial upshots. First, if complexity alone is cited,\nthat complexity may not clearly speak of intent. Second, although the\nexhibiting of genuine purpose and value might constitute persuasive\nevidence of a designer, establishing that the empirical\ncharacteristics in question really do betoken genuine purpose and\nvalue—and not just, say, functionality—seems to many to be\ndifficult if not\n impossible.[5] \nEvidential ambiguity would virtually disappear if it became clear that\nthere is no plausible means of producing some R independent\nof deliberate intent. Part of the persuasiveness of (6) historically\ncame from absence of any known plausible non-intentional alternative\ncausal account of the traditional Rs. Such cases are often\nlinked to alleged gaps in nature—phenomena for which, it is\nclaimed, there can be no purely natural explanation, there being a gap\nbetween nature’s production capabilities and the phenomenon in\nquestion. (For example, nature’s unaided capabilities fall short\nof those capabilities required for producing a radio. Thus, when we\nsee a radio we know that something else—human agency—was\ninvolved in its production.) Design cases resting upon nature’s\nalleged inability to produce some relevant ‘natural’\nphenomenon are generally assumed to explicitly or implicitly appeal to\nsupernatural agency, and are typically described as\n“God-of-the-gaps” arguments—a description usually\nintended to be pejorative. \nBut evidence of design in nature does not automatically imply gaps.\nDesign built or “front-loaded” into nature from the very\nbeginning would require no further interventions within the historical\nflow of nature and therefore no gaps. But since the artifact/nature\ndivide parallels the gap/non-gap divide, one way the implausibility of\nalternative means of production could become exceptionally clear was\nif R were associated with a gap in nature’s\ncapabilities—if the unaided course of nature genuinely could not\nor would not produce R, yet we see R in\n‘nature’. In such a case, the appeal to agency would be\nvirtually inevitable.  \nThe position that there are gaps in nature is not inherently\nirrational—and would seem to be a legitimate empirical question.\nBut although gaps would profoundly strengthen design arguments, they\nhave their own suite of difficulties. Gaps are usually easy to spot in\ncases of artifactuality, but although they may be present in nature,\nestablishing their existence there can usually be done (by\nscience, at least) only indirectly—via probability\nconsiderations, purported limitations on nature’s abilities,\netc. \nSeveral possible snags lurk. Gaps in nature would, again, suggest\nsupernatural agency, and some take science to operate under an\nobligatory exclusion of such. This prohibition—commonly known as\nmethodological naturalism—is often claimed (mistakenly,\nsome argue) to be definitive of genuine\n science.[6]\n ‘Established’ limitations both on science and on nature\ncan and have been overturned in the past. The possibility of discovery\n(or postulation) of alternative ‘natural’ means of\nproduction would constitute a standing threat to any argument resting\nin part on a perceived absence of such means. And the spotty track\nrecord of alleged gaps provides at least a cautionary note. Such\nconsiderations will complicate attempts to very firmly establish\ndesign empirically on the basis of the types of properties we usually\nfind in nature. \nThe way that alleged gaps typically disappear is, of course, through\nnew proposed scientific theories postulating means of natural\nproduction of phenomena previously thought to be beyond nature’s\ncapabilities. The most obvious example of that is, of course,\nDarwin’s evolutionary theory and its descendants. \nSome philosophers of science claim that in a wide variety of\nscientific cases we employ an “inference to the best\nexplanation”\n (IBE).[7]\n The basic idea is that if one among a number of competing candidate\nexplanations is overall superior to others in significant\nrespects—enhanced likelihood, explanatory power and scope,\ncausal adequacy, plausibility, evidential support, fit with\nalready-accepted theories, predictiveness, fruitfulness, precision,\nunifying power, and the like—then we are warranted in\n(provisionally) accepting that candidate as the right explanation\ngiven the evidence in question (Lipton 1991, 58). Some advocates see\ndesign arguments as inferences to the best explanation, taking design\nexplanations—whatever their weaknesses—as prima\nfacie superior to chance, necessity, chance-driven evolution, or\nwhatever. \nA general schema deployed in the current case would give us the\nfollowing: \nSchema 3: \nTherefore (probably) \nIn arguments of this type, superior explanatory virtues of a theory\nare taken as constituting decisive epistemic support for theory\nacceptability, warranted belief of the theory, and likely truth of the\ntheory. There are, of course, multitudes of purported explanatory,\nepistemic virtues, including the incomplete list a couple paragraphs\nback (and lists of such have evolved over time). Assessing hypotheses\nin terms of such virtues is frequently contentious, depending, as it\ndoes, on perceptions of ill-defined characteristics, differences in\nbackground conceptual stances, and the like. Still, in general we\nfrequently manage rough and ready resolutions. \nOne key underlying structure in this context is typically traced to\nPeirce’s notion of abduction. Suppose that some\notherwise surprising fact e would be a reasonably expectable\noccurrence were hypothesis h true. That, Peirce\nargued, would constitute at least some provisional reason for thinking\nthat h might actually be true. Peirce’s own\ncharacterization was as follows (Peirce 1955, 151): \nSchema 3: \nHence, \nThe measure of C being a ‘matter of course’ given\nA is frequently described as the degree to which C could\nbe expected were A in fact true. This intuition is\nsometimes—though explicitly not by Peirce\nhimself—formalized in terms of likelihood, defined as\nfollows: \nThe likelihood of h is the probability of finding evidence\ne given that the hypothesis h is true. In cases of\ncompeting explanatory hypotheses—say h1 and\nh2—the comparative likelihoods on specified\nevidence can be taken to indicate which of the competitors specific\npieces of evidence differentially support, i.e.: \nHigher likelihood of h1 than h2 on\nspecific evidence does not automatically imply that\nh1 should be accepted, is likely to be true, or is\nbetter in some overall sense than is h2.\nh1 might, in fact, be a completely lunatic theory\nwhich nonetheless entails e, giving h1 as\nhigh a likelihood as possible. Such maximal likelihood relative to\ne would not necessarily alter h1’s\nlunacy. Likelihood thus does not automatically translate into a\nmeasure of how strongly some specific evidence e supports the\nhypothesis h1 in question (Jantzen 2014a, Chap.\n11). \nThis, then, leads directly to Bayesian probability theory. While the\nBayesian approach is undoubtedly more rigorous than appeals to IBE,\nfew teleological arguments are presented in these terms. For a\ncontrast between IBE and Bayesianism, see\n abduction.\n For an important recent critique of theistic design arguments in\nBayesian terms, see (Sober 2009), and the reply by (Kotzen (2012), and\nJantzen’s response (2014b). \nWhatever one’s view of Bayesianism, IBEs have their own\nshortcomings. The assessment of ‘best’ is not only a\nvalue-tinged judgment, but is notoriously tricky (especially given the\nambiguous and hard to pinpoint import of the Rs in the\npresent case). There is also the very deep question of why we should\nthink that features which we humans find attractive in proposed\nexplanations should be thought to be truth-tracking. What sort of\njustification might be available here? Furthermore, taking design to\nbe the best explanation for something requires prior identification of\nthe appropriate properties as design-relevant, and that recognition\nmust have a different\n basis.[8]\n And again, substantive comparison can only involve known\nalternatives, which at any point represent a vanishingly small\nfraction of the possible alternatives. Choosing the best of the known\nmay be the best we can do, but many would insist that without some\nfurther suppressed and significant assumptions, being the best (as\nhumans see it) of the (humanly known) restricted group does not\nwarrant ascription of truth, or anything like it. \nThere are other potential issues here as well. Sober argues that\nwithout additional very specific assumptions about the putative\ndesigner we could specify no particular value for P(e | h)—e.g., the likelihood that a designer would\nproduce vertebrate eyes with the specific features we observe them to\nhave: and that depending on the specific assumptions made we could\ncome up with any value from 0 to 1 (e.g., Sober 2003, 38). \nThere is also the potential problem of new, previously unconsidered\nhypotheses all lumped together in the catch-all basket. Without\nknowing the details of what specific unconsidered hypotheses might\nlook like, there is simply no plausible way to anticipate the apparent\nlikelihood of a novel new hypothesis—let alone its other\npotential explanatory virtues. This, on some views, is essentially\nwhat happened with traditional design arguments—such arguments\nwere the most reasonable available until Darwinian evolution provided\na plausible (or better) alternative the details and likelihood of\nwhich were not previously anticipatable.  \nWithout going into the familiar details, Darwinian processes fueled by\nundesigned, unplanned, chance variations that are in turn conserved or\neliminated by way of natural selection would, it is argued, over time\nproduce organisms exquisitely adapted to their environmental\n niches.[9]\n And since many of the characteristics traditionally cited as\nevidences of design just were various adaptations, evolution\nwould thus produce entities exactly fitting traditional criteria of\ndesign. Natural selection, then, unaided by intention or intervention\ncould account for the existence of many (perhaps all) of the\nRs which we in fact find in biology. (A parallel debate can\nbe found between those who believe that life itself requires a design\nexplanation (Meyer 2009) and those proposing naturalistic explanations\n(see the entry on\n life.) \nThat was—and is—widely taken as meaning that design\narguments depending upon specific biological gaps would be\nweakened—perhaps fatally. \nPremise (10)—not to mention the earlier (6)—would thus\nlook to simply be false. What had earlier appeared to be\npurpose (requiring intent) was now apparently revealed as\nmere unintended but successful and preserved function. \nOf course, relevant premises being false merely undercuts the relevant\nschemas in present form—it does not necessarily refute either\nthe basic design intuition or other forms of design arguments. But\nsome critics take a much stronger line here. Richard Dawkins, for\ninstance, subtitles one of his books: “Why the evidence of\nevolution reveals a universe without design” (Dawkins, 1987).\nTypically underlying claims of this sort is the belief that Darwinian\nevolution, by providing a relevant account of the origin and\ndevelopment of adaptation, diversity, and the like, has explained away\nthe alleged design in the biological realm—and an attendant\ndesigner—in much the same way that kinetic theory has explained\naway caloric. Indeed, this is a dominant idea underlying current\nresponses to design arguments. However, undercutting and explaining\naway are not necessarily the same thing, and exactly what explaining\naway might mean, and what a successful explaining away might require\nare typically not clearly specified. So before continuing, we need\nclarity concerning some relevant conceptual landscape. \nThat an alleged explanatory factor α is provisionally explained\naway requires that there be an alternative explanation Σ meeting\nthese conditions: \nHowever, (a) – (d) are incomplete in a way directly relevant to\nthe present discussion. Here is a very simple case. Suppose that an\nelderly uncle dies in suspicious circumstances, and a number of the\nrelatives believe that the correct explanation is the direct agency of\na niece who is primary heir, via deliberately and directly\nadministering poison. However, forensic investigation establishes that\nthe cause of death was a mix-up among medications the uncle was\ntaking—an unfortunate confusion. The suspicious relatives,\nhowever, without missing an explanatory beat shift the niece’s\nagency back one level, proposing that the mix-up itself was\norchestrated by the niece—switching contents of prescription\nbottles, no doubt. And that might very well turn out to be the\ntruth. \nIn that sort of case, the α in question (e.g., niecely agency)\nis no longer directly appealed to in the relevant initial explanatory\nlevel, but is not removed from all explanatory relevance to the\nphenomenon in question. In general, then, for α to be explained\naway in the sense of banished from all explanatory relevance the\nfollowing condition must also be met: \nRoughly this means that Σ does not depend essentially on any\npart β of any prior explanation where α is essential to\nβ. There are some additional possible technical qualifications\nrequired, but the general intuition should be clear.  \nThus, e.g., whereas there was no need to appeal to caloric at some\nprior or deeper level, with design, according to various design\nadvocates, there is still an explanatory lacuna (or implicit\npromissory note) requiring reference to design at some explanatory\nlevel prior to Darwinian evolution. Indeed, as some see it (and as\nPaley himself suggested), there are phenomena requiring explanation in\ndesign terms which cannot be explained away at any prior explanatory\nlevel (short of the ultimate level). \nThat some phenomenon α has been explained away can be taken to\nmean two very different things—either as  \nor as  \n(And often, of course, both.)  \nFor instance, few would assert that there is still an extant rational\ncase for belief in phlogiston—any explanatory work it did at the\nproximate level seems to have ceased, and deeper explanatory uses for\nit have never subsequently materialized. Perhaps its non-existence was\nnot positively established immediately, but removal of rational\njustification for belief in some entity can morph into a case for\nnon-existence as the evidence for a rival hypothesis increases over\ntime. \nPurported explanations can be informally divided into two broad\ncategories—those involving agents, agency, intention, and the\nlike; and those involving mechanism, physical causality, natural\nprocesses, and the like. The distinction is not, of course, a clean\none (functioning artifacts typically involve both), but is useful\nenough in a rough and ready way, and in what follows agent\nexplanations and mechanical explanations respectively will be used as\nconvenient handles. Nothing pernicious is built into either the broad\ndistinction or the specified terminology. \nThere are some instructive patterns that emerge in explanatory\nlevel-shifting attempts, and in what immediately follows some of the\nmore basic patterns will be identified. \nIntention, intervention, and other agency components of explanations\ncan very frequently be pushed back to prior levels—much as many\ndefenders of teleological arguments claim. The earlier case of the\nalleged poisoning of the rich uncle by the niece is a simple example\nof this. \nBut in some cases, the specifics of the agent explanation in question\nmay make appeal to some prior level less plausible or sensible. For\nexample, suppose that one held the view that crop circles were to be\nexplained in terms of direct alien activity. One could, upon getting\nirrefutable video proof of human production of crop circles, still\nmaintain that aliens were from a distance controlling the brains of\nthe humans in question, and that thus the responsibility for crop\ncircles did still lie with alien activity. While this retreat of\nlevels preserves the basic explanation, it of course comes with a\nsignificant cost in inherent implausibility. \nAnd in some cases, pushing specific agency back a level seems nearly\nunworkable. Suppose that the standard explanation of global warming\nwas human activity, but that subsequently a complete, completely\nadequate, nailed down explanation in terms of solar cycles emerged.\nThat would seem to explain away the alleged human causation, and in\nthis sort of case it would be difficult to retreat back one level and\nmake the case that human agency and activity were actually driving the\nsolar cycles.  \nStill the level-changing possibility is as a general rule available\nwith proposed agent explanations. And design typically is, of course,\nan agent explanation. \nPushing specific explanatory factors back to a prior level often works\nless smoothly in cases of purely mechanical/physical explanations than\nin intentional/agency explanations. In many attempted mechanistic\nrelocation cases, it is difficult to see how the specific relocated\nexplanatory factor is even supposed to work, much less generate any\nnew explanatory traction. Exactly what would caloric do if pushed back\none level, for instance?  \nAlthough level shifting of specific explanatory factors seems to work\nless easily within purely physical explanations, relocation attempts\ninvolving broad physical principles can sometimes avoid such\ndifficulties. For instance, for centuries determinism was a basic\nbackground component of scientific explanations (apparently stochastic\nprocesses being explained away epistemically). Then, early in the 20th\ncentury physics was largely converted to a quantum mechanical picture\nof nature as involving an irreducible indeterminism at a fundamental\nlevel—apparently deterministic phenomena now being what was\nexplained away. However, DeBroglie, Bohm and others (even for a time\nEinstein) tried to reinstate determinism by moving it back to an even\ndeeper fundamental level via hidden variable theories. Although the\nhidden variable attempt is generally thought not to be successful, its\nfailure is not a failure of principle. \nHow one assesses the legitimacy, plausibility, or likelihood of the\nspecific counter-explanation will bear substantial weight here, and\nthat in turn will depend significantly on among other things\nbackground beliefs, commitments, metaphysical dispositions, and the\nlike. If one has a prior commitment to some key α (e.g., to\ntheism, atheism, naturalism, determinism, materialism, or teleology),\nor assigns a high prior to that α, the plausibility of taking\nthe proposed (new) explanation as undercutting, defeating, or refuting\nα (and/or Σ) will be deeply affected, at least\ninitially. \nTilting the conceptual landscape via prior commitments is both an\nequal opportunity epistemic necessity and a potential pitfall\nhere. Insisting on pushing an explanatory factor back a level is often\nan indication of a strong prior commitment of some sort. Disagreement\nover deeper philosophical or other principles will frequently generate\ndivergence over when something has or has not been explained away. One\nside, committed to the principle, will accept a level change as\nembodying a deeper insight into the relevant phenomenon. The other,\nrejecting the principle, will see an ad hoc retreat to defend an\nα which has in fact been explained away.  \nReturning to the present issue, design argument advocates will of\ncourse reject the claim that design, teleology, agency and the like\nhave been explained away either by science generally or by Darwinian\nevolution in particular. Reasons will vary. Some will see any\nscience—Darwinian evolution included—as incompetent to say\nanything of ultimate design relevance, pro or con. (Many on\nboth sides of the design issue fit here.) Some will see Darwinian\nevolution as failing condition (a), (b) and/or (c), claiming that\nDarwinian evolution is not explanatorily adequate to selected\nα’s, is inadequately supported by the evidence, and is far\nfrom superior to agency explanations of relevant phenomena.\n(Creationists and some—not all—‘intelligent\ndesign’ advocates fit here.) Some will argue that a Darwinian\nfailure occurs at (d), citing e.g., a concept of information\nclaimed to be both essential to evolution and freighted with agency.\n(Some intelligent design advocates (e.g., Dembski, 2002 and Meyer,\n1998) fit here.) However, the major contention of present interest\ninvolves (e). \nHistorically, design cases were in fact widely understood to allow for\nindirect intelligent agent design and causation, the very\ncausal structures producing the relevant phenomena being themselves\ndeliberately designed for the purpose of producing those\n phenomena.[11]\n For instance, it was typically believed that God could have initiated\nspecial conditions and processes at the instant of creation which\noperating entirely on their own could produce organisms and other\nintended (and designed) results with no subsequent agent intervention\nrequired. Paley himself, the authors of the Bridgewater\nTreatises and others were explicitly clear that whether or not\nsomething was designed was an issue largely separable from the means\nof production in question. Historically it was insisted that design in\nnature did track back eventually to intelligent agency\nsomewhere and that any design we find in nature would\nnot—and could not—have been there had there ultimately\nbeen no mind involved. But commentators (including many scientists) at\nleast from the early 17th century on (e.g., Francis Bacon and Robert\nBoyle) very clearly distinguished the creative initiating of nature\nitself from interventions within the path of nature once initiated.\nFor instance, over two centuries before Darwin, Bacon wrote: \nIndeed, if the Rs in question did directly indicate the\ninfluence of a mind, then means of production—whether unbroken\ncausation or gappy—would be of minimal evidential importance.\nThus, the frequent contemporary claim that design arguments all\ninvolve appeal to special divine intervention during the course of\nnature’s history—that in short design arguments are\n“God-of-the-gaps” arguments—represents serious\nhistorical (and present) inaccuracy (e.g., Behe, 1996). \nHowever, if Rs result from gapless chains of natural causal\nprocesses, the evidential impact of those Rs again threatens\nto become problematic and ambiguous, since there will a\nfortiori be at the immediate level a full natural causal account\nfor\n them.[12]\n Design will, in such cases, play no immediate mechanistic explanatory\nrole, suggesting its superfluousness. But even if such conceptions\nwere explanatorily and scientifically superfluous at that level, that\ndoes not entail that they are conceptually, alethically, inferential,\nor otherwise superfluous in general. The role of mind might be\nindirect, deeply buried, or at several levels of remove from the\nimmediate production mechanism but would still have to be present at\nsome level. In short, on the above picture Darwinian evolution will\nnot meet condition (e) for explaining away design, which is not itself\na shortcoming of Darwinian evolution. \nBut any gap-free argument will depend crucially upon the Rs\nin question being ultimately dependent for their eventual\noccurrence upon agent activity. That issue could be integrated back\ninto an altered Schema 2 by replacing (6) with: \nThe focus must now become whether or not the laws and conditions\nrequired for the indirect production of life, intelligent life, etc.,\ncould themselves be independent of intention, design and mind at some\ndeep (perhaps primordial, pre-cosmic) point. In recent decades,\nexactly that question has arisen increasingly insistently from within\nthe scientific community. \nIntuitively, if the laws of physics were different, the evolution of\nlife would not have taken the same path. If gravity were stronger, for\nexample, then flying insects and giraffes would most likely not exist.\nThe truth is far more dramatic. Even an extraordinarily small change\nin one of many key parameters in the laws of physics would have made\nlife impossible anywhere in the universe. Consider two examples: \nThe expansion rate of the universe is represented by the cosmological\nconstant Λ. If Λ were slighter greater, there would be\nno energy sources, such as stars. If it were slightly less, the Big\nBang would have quickly led to a Big Crunch in which the universe\ncollapsed back onto itself. For life to be possible, Λ cannot\nvary more than one part in 1053 (Collins 2003) \nLife depends on, among other things, a balance of carbon and oxygen in\nthe universe. If the strong nuclear force were different by 0.4%,\nthere would not be enough of one or the other for life to exist\n(Oberhummer, Csótó, and Schlattl 2000). Varying this\nconstant either way “would destroy almost all carbon or almost\nall oxygen in every star” (Barrow 2002, 155).  \nMany examples of fine-tuning have to do with star formation. Stars are\nimportant since life requires a variety of elements: oxygen, carbon,\nhydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Stars contain the only\nknown mechanism for producing large quantities of these elements and\nare therefore necessary for life. Lee Smolin estimates that when all\nof the fine-tuning examples are considered, the chance of stars\nexisting in the universe is 1 in 10229. “In my\nopinion, a probability this tiny is not something we can let go\nunexplained. Luck will certainly not do here; we need some rational\nexplanation of how something this unlikely turned out to be the\ncase” (Smolin 1999, 45). Smolin is not merely claiming that all\nimprobable events require an explanation, but some improbable events\nare special. (In poker, every set of five cards dealt to the dealer\nhas the same probability, assuming that the cards are shuffled\nsufficiently. If the dealer is dealt a pair on three successive hands,\nno special explanation is required. If the dealer is dealt a royal\nflush on three successive hands, an explanation would rightly be\ndemanded, and the improbability of this case isn’t even close to the\nmagnitude of the improbability that Smolin mentioned.)  Physicists who\nhave written on fine-tuning agree with Smolin that it cries out for an\nexplanation. One explanation is that the universe appears to be\nfine-tuned for the existence of life because it literally has been\nconstructed for life by an intelligent\nagent. \nThere are two other types of responses to fine-tuning: (i) it does\nnot, in fact, require a special explanation, and (ii) there are\nalternative explanations to theistic design. Let’s briefly\nconsider these (also see the entry on\n fine-tuning). \nThree approaches have been taken to undermine the demand for\nexplanation presented by fine-tuning. \nIn a sense, it is necessary for the fine-tuned constants to have\nvalues in the life-permitting range: If those values were not within\nthat range, people would not exist. The fine-tuned constants\nmust take on the values that they have in order for\nscientists to be surprised by their discovery in the first place. As a\nmatter of fact, they could not have discovered anything else.\nAccording to the weak anthropic principle, we ought not be surprised\nby having made such a discovery, since no other observation was\npossible. But if we should not have been surprised to have made such a\ndiscovery, then there is nothing unusual here that requires a special\nexplanation. The demand for explanation is simply misplaced. \nSober gives a related but stronger argument based on observational\nselection effects (Sober 2009, 77–80). Say that Jones nets a\nlarge number of fish from a local lake, all of which are over 10\ninches long. Let hall= ‘all of the fish in the lake\nare over 10 inches long’ and h1/2= ‘Half of the\nfish in the lake are over 10 inches long’. The evidence e is\nsuch that P(e | hall) >\nP(e | h1/2). Now say that Jones discovers\nthat his net is covered with 10 inch holes, preventing him from\ncapturing any smaller fish. In that case, e does not favor one\nhypothesis over the other. The evidence e is an artifact of the net\nitself, not a random sample of the fish in the lake.  \nWhen it comes to fine-tuning, Sober considers\nhdesign=‘the constants have been set in place by an\nintelligence, specifically God’, and\nhchance=‘the constants are what they are as a matter\nof mindless random chance’. While intuitively \none has to consider the role of the observer, who is analogous to the\nnet in the fishing example. Since human observers could only detect\nconstants in the life-permitting range, Sober argues, the correct\nprobabilities are \nGiven this equality, fine-tuning does not favor hdesign\nover hchance. The selection effect prevents any\nconfirmation of design.  \nSober’s analysis is critiqued in (Monton 2006) and (Kotzen\n2012). Also see (Jantzen 2014a, sec. 18.4). We should note that if\nSober is correct, then the naturalistic explanations for fine-tuning\nconsidered below (4.1.2) are likewise misguided. \nLet C stand for a fine-tuned parameter with physically\npossible values in the range [0, ∞. If we assume that nature is\nnot biased toward one value of C rather than another, then\neach unit subinterval in this range should be assigned equal\nprobability. Fine-tuning is surprising insofar as the life-permitting\nrange of C is tiny compared to the full interval, which\ncorresponds to a very small probability.  \nAs McGrew, McGrew, and Vestrup argue (2001), there is a problem here\nin that, strictly speaking, mathematical probabilities do not apply in\nthese circumstances. When a probability distribution is defined over a\nspace of possible outcomes, it must add up to exactly 1. But for any\nuniform distribution over an infinitely large space, the sum of the\nprobabilities will grow arbitrarily large as each unit interval is\nadded up. Since the range of C is infinite, McGrew et al.\nconclude that there is no sense in which life-friendly universes are\nimprobable; the probabilities are mathematically undefined.  \nOne solution to this problem is to truncate the interval of possible\nvalues. Instead of allowing C to range from [0, ∞), one\ncould form a finite interval [0, N], where N is very\nlarge relative to the life-permitting range of C. A\nprobability distribution could then be defined over the truncated\nrange. \nA more rigorous solution employs measure theory. Measure is sometimes\nused in physics as a surrogate for probability. For example, there are\nmany more irrational numbers than rational ones. In measure theoretic\nterms, almost all real numbers are irrational, where\n“almost all” means all but a set of zero measure. In\nphysics, a property found for almost all of the solutions to an\nequation requires no explanation; it’s what one should expect.\nIt’s not unusual, for instance, for a pin balancing on its tip\nto fall over. Falling over is to be expected. In contrast, if a\nproperty that has zero measure in the relevant space were actually\nobserved to be the case, like the pin continuing to balance on its\ntip, that would demand a special explanation. Assuming one’s\nmodel for the system is correct, nature appears to be strongly biased\nagainst such behavior (Gibbons, Hawking, and Stewart 1987, 736). The\nargument for fine-tuning can thus be recast such that almost all\nvalues of C are outside of the life-permitting range. The\nfact that our universe is life-permitting is therefore in need of\nexplanation. \nThe question of whether probabilities either do not apply or have been\nimproperly applied to cosmological fine-tuning continues to draw\ninterest. For more, see (Davies 1992), (Callender 2004), (Holder\n2004), (Koperski 2005), (Manson 2009), (Jantzen 2014a, sec. 18.3), and\n(Sober 2019, sec. 5.1). Manson (2018) argues that neither theism nor\nnaturalism provides a better explanation for fine-tuning. \nAssuming that fine-tuning does require an explanation, there are\nseveral approaches one might take (Koperski 2015, section 2.4). \nThat the universe is fine-tuned for life is based on current science.\nBut, just as many other anomalies have eventually been explained, so\nmight fine-tuning. Science may one day find a naturalistic answer,\neliminating the need for design. For suggestions along these lines,\nsee (Harnik, Kribs, and Perez 2006) and (Loeb 2014). \nWhile this is a popular stance, it is, of course, a promissory note\nrather than an explanation. The appeal to what might yet be discovered\nis not itself a rival hypothesis. \nIt’s conceivable that life could exist in a universe with\nparameter values that we do not typically believe are life-permitting.\nIn other words, there may be exotic forms of life that could survive\nin a very different sort of universe. If so, then perhaps the\nparameter intervals that are in fact life-permitting are not\nfine-tuned after all.  \nThe main difficulty with this suggestion is that all life requires a\nmeans for overcoming the second law of thermodynamics. Life requires\nthe extraction of energy from the environment. Any life-form\nimaginable must therefore have systems that allow for something like\nmetabolism and respiration, which in turn require a minimal amount of\ncomplexity (e.g., there can be no single-molecule life forms). Many\nexamples of fine-tuning do not allow for such complexity, however. If\nthere were no stars, for example, then there would be no stable\nsources of energy and no mechanism for producing the heavier elements\nin the periodic table. Such a universe would lack the chemical\nbuilding blocks needed for a living entity to extract energy from the\nenvironment and thereby resist the pull of entropy. \nWhile the odds of winning a national lottery are low, your odds would\nobviously increase if you were to buy several million tickets. The\nsame idea applies to the most popular explanation for fine-tuning: a\nmultiverse. Perhaps physical reality consists of a massive array of\nuniverses each with a different set of values for the relevant\nconstants. If there are many—perhaps infinitely\nmany—universes, then the odds of a life-permitting universe\nbeing produced would seem to be much greater. While most of the\nuniverses in the multiverse would be unfit for life, so the argument\ngoes, ours is one of the few where all of the constants have the\nrequired values.  \nWhile the philosophical literature on the multiverse continues to grow\n(see (Collins 2009, 2012) and (Kraay 2014)), many of the arguments\nagainst it share a common premise: a multiverse would not, by itself,\nbe a sufficient explanation of fine-tuning. More would have to be\nknown about the way in which universes are produced. By analogy, just\nbecause a roulette wheel has 38 spaces does not guarantee that the\nprobability of Red 25 is 1/38. If the wheel is rigged in some\nway—by using magnets for example—to prevent that outcome,\nthen the probability might be extremely small. If the table were\nrigged and yet Red 25 was the actual winner, that would\nrequire a special explanation. Likewise, if a property has zero\nmeasure in the space of possible universes, and yet that property is\nobserved, its existence would still require an explanation (Earman\n1987, 315). This is true regardless of whether the space of universes\nis finitely or infinitely large. In order to explain fine-tuning, the\nmultiverse proponent would still have to show that the life-permitting\nuniverses do not have zero measure in the space of all universes\n(Koperski 2005, 307–09).  \nA high-profile development in design arguments over the past 20 years\nor so involves what has come to be known as Intelligent Design (ID).\nAlthough there are variants, it generally involves efforts to\nconstruct design arguments taking cognizance of various contemporary\nscientific developments (primarily in biology, biochemistry, and\ncosmology)—developments which, as most ID advocates see it, both\nreveal the inadequacy of mainstream explanatory accounts (condition\n(a)) and offer compelling evidence for design in nature at some level\n(condition (e) again). \nID advocates propose two specialized Rs—irreducible\ncomplexity (Behe 1996) and specified complex information\n(Dembski 1998,\n 2002).[13]\n Although distinctions are sometimes blurred here, while ID arguments\ninvolving each of those Rs tend to be gap arguments,\nan additional focus on mind-reflective aspects of nature is typically\nmore visible in ID arguments citing specified complexity than in\narguments citing irreducible complexity. \nThe movement has elicited vociferous criticism and opposition.\nOpponents have pressed a number of objections against ID including,\ninter alia contentions that ID advocates have simply gotten\nthe relevant science wrong, that even where the science is right the\nempirical evidences cited by design advocates do not constitute\nsubstantive grounds for design conclusions, that the existence of\ndemonstrably superior alternative explanations for the phenomena cited\nundercuts the cogency of ID cases, and that design theories are not\nlegitimate science, but are just disguised creationism,\nGod-of-the-gaps arguments, religiously motivated, etc. \nWe will not pursue that dispute here except to note that even if the\ncase is made that ID could not count as proper science, which is\n controversial,[14]\n that would not in itself demonstrate a defect in design arguments as\nsuch. Science need not be seen as exhausting the space of legitimate\nconclusions from empirical data. In any case, the floods of vitriol in\nthe current ID discussion suggest that much more than the propriety of\nselected inferences from particular empirical evidences is at\nissue. \nThat question is: why do design arguments remain so durable if\nempirical evidence is inferentially ambiguous, the arguments logically\ncontroversial, and the conclusions vociferously disputed? One\npossibility is that they really are better arguments than most\nphilosophical critics concede. Another possibility is that design\nintuitions do not rest upon inferences at all. The situation\nmay parallel that of the existence of an external world, the existence\nof other minds, and a number of other familiar matters. The 18th\ncentury Scottish Common Sense philosopher Thomas Reid (and his\ncontemporary followers) argued that we are simply so constructed that\nin certain normally-realized experiential circumstances we simply\nfind that we in fact have involuntary convictions about such\na world, about other minds, and so forth. That would explain why\nhistorical philosophical attempts to reconstruct the\narguments by which such beliefs either arose or were justified were\nsuch notorious failures—failures in the face of which ordinary\nbelief nonetheless proceeded happily and helplessly onward. If a\nsimilar involuntary belief-producing mechanism operated with respect\nto intuitions of design, that would similarly explain why\nargumentative attempts have been less than universally compelling but\nyet why design ideas fail to disappear despite the purported failure\nof such arguments. \nA number of prominent figures historically in fact held that we could\ndetermine more or less perceptually that various things in nature were\ncandidates for design attributions—that they were in the\nrequisite respects design-like. Some, like William Whewell,\nheld that we could perceptually identify some things as more than mere\ncandidates for design (Whewell 1834, 344). Thomas Reid also held a\nview in this \nregion,[15] \nand Hume’s Cleanthes made suggestions in this direction. \nIf something like that were the operative process, then ID, in trying\nto forge a scientific link to design in the sense of\ninferences from empirically determined evidences would be\nmisconstructing the actual basis for design belief, as would be design\narguments more generally. It is perhaps telling, in this regard, that\nscientific theorizing typically involves substantial creativity and\nthat the resultant theories are typically novel and unexpected. Design\nintuitions, however, do not seem to emerge as novel construals from\ncreative grappling with data, but are embedded in our thinking nearly\nnaturally—so much so that, again, Crick thinks that biologists\nhave to be immunized against it.  \nPerception and appreciation of the incredible intricacy and the beauty\nof things in nature—whether biological or cosmic—has\ncertainly inclined many toward thoughts of purpose and design in\nnature, and has constituted important moments of affirmation for those\nwho already accept design positions. The status of the corresponding\narguments of course, is not only a matter of current dispute,\nbut the temperature of the dispute seems to be on the rise. And\nregardless of what one thinks of the arguments at this point, so long\nas nature has the power to move us (as even Kant admitted that the\n‘starry heavens above’ did), design convictions and\narguments are unlikely to disappear quietly.","contact.mail":"koperski@svsu.edu","contact.domain":"svsu.edu"}]
