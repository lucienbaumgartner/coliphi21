Conceptions of maximal\ngreatness differ but theists believe that a maximally great reality\nmust be a maximally great person or God. Theists largely\nagree that a maximally great person would be omnipresent, omnipotent,\nomniscient, and all good. They do not agree on a number of God's other\nattributes, however. We will illustrate this by examining the debate\nover God's impassibility in western theism and a dispute over God's\nrelation to the space-time world in Indian theism. The entry concludes\nby examining some concepts of limited deities.\n\n\n\nPaul Tillich believed that the essence of religious attitudes is\n“ultimate concern.” Ultimate concern is\n“total.” Its object is experienced as numinous or holy,\ndistinct from all profane and ordinary realities. It is also\nexperienced as overwhelmingly real and valuable—indeed, so real\nand so valuable that, in comparison, all other things appear empty and\nworthless. As such, it demands total surrender and promises total\nfulfillment.[1] \n\nTillich's claim is not self-evident. For one thing, it is doubtful\nthat ultimate concern is either a necessary or a sufficient condition\nof a religious attitude. A late pagan's attitude towards his gods was\noften too casual to be described as ultimate in Tillich's sense and\nyet was surely religious. Moreover, Tillich himself believed that a\ncommitment to one's nation or party could be ultimate in his sense\n(although he thought that if one's concern were to take this form, it\nwould be “idolatrous”).  Whether the Nazi's attitude\ntowards his nation and party can be properly described as religious is\ndoubtful, however. Strictly speaking, then, Tillich's claim is\nprobably false. Nevertheless, ultimate concern does appear to\nbe a distinctive feature of the religious attitudes of devout members\nof the major religious traditions. \n\nThese attitudes seem fully appropriate only if their object is\nmaximally great—so perfect and splendid that nothing greater is\nconceivable. And, in fact, the major religious traditions have (if\nonly implicitly) construed the object of their devotion in precisely\nthese terms. The nature of maximal perfection is controversial,\nhowever. \n\nFor one thing, the form a religious community's ultimate\nconcern takes (and the conception of its object with which it is bound\nup) varies from one religious community to another.  Ultimate concern\nmay take the form of worship, and involve praise, love, gratitude,\nsupplication, confession, petition, and the like. But it can also take\nthe form of a quest for the ultimate good. The object of the quest is\nan existentially appropriated knowledge of the ultimate good or a\nunion with it that transforms us and overcomes our wrongness. The two\nforms of ultimate concern may be combined or exist separately.\nChristianity and theistic Hinduism combine both. In Theravada Buddhism\nand Taoism, on the other hand, ultimate concern typically takes the\nsecond form but not the first. \n\nIn practice, a religious community's conception of the divine is\nlargely determined by its conviction that the object of its devotion\nis maximally great, by the spoken or oral texts it regards as\nauthoritative, and by metaphysical assumptions and valuations widely\nshared by the community's members. Of course these sources aren't\nindependent of each other. The form ultimate concern takes in a\ncommunity incorporates its most fundamental evaluations, and\nthe authoritative texts which express and shape its ultimate concern\npresent pictures of the world and our place in it which include\nexplicit or implicit metaphysical claims. The Buddhist's picture, for\nexample, expresses the vision of a world in constant flux—devoid\nof fixity or any kind of permanent substance. \n\nSince the form ultimate concern takes, the texts regarded as\nauthoritative, and the metaphysical assumptions and evaluations\ninextricably bound up with these forms and texts vary from one\nreligious community to another, it is hardly surprising that\nconceptions of maximal greatness vary as well. \n\nThe most striking disagreement is between those who regard the divine\nreality as personal and those who do not. Theists believe that even\nthough the object of their ultimate concern transcends all finite\nrealities it is more like a person than anything else with which we\nare ordinarily familiar, and typically conceptualize it as a maximally\nperfect person. Persons are rational agents, however—beings who\nhave beliefs about themselves and the world and act on the basis of\nthem. The major theistic traditions have therefore described ultimate\nreality as an omniscient mind and an omnipotent will. Other religious\ntraditions are non-theistic. Advaita Vedanta is an important\nexample. \n\nAdvaita Vedanta's rejection of theism is a consequence of its\ninsistence that “Brahman [ultimate reality] is without parts or\nattributes…one without a second.” (Shankara [traditional\nattribution], second half of the 8th century: 101) If the Brahman has\nno properties, it necessarily lacks the properties of\nomniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and personhood, and cannot\ntherefore be understood as God.  \n\nThe rejection of theism also follows from Advaita's conviction that\nBrahman contains no internal diversity (“is without\nparts”) and is identical with the whole of reality (”is\none without a second”). If Brahman is all there is, for\nexample,then there is nothing outside Brahman that could serve as an\nobject of its knowledge. And if it is devoid of internal diversity,\nthere can be no self-knowledge either, for self-knowledge involves an\ninternal differentiation between the self as knower and the self as\nknown. Nor can the Brahman be a causal agent. If Brahman is maximally\nperfect, it must be unlimited. But it is limited if something\nexists outside it. The Brahman must therefore be all there is. If the\nBrahman is identical with the whole of reality, though, and Brahman\ncontains no plurality, then reality as a whole is an undifferentiated\nunity. The space-time world with its distinctions between times,\nplaces, and events is consequently unreal. Real causal\nrelations are relations between two real things, however. So Brahman\nis neither the cause of the space-time world as a whole nor of the\nevents in it, and is thus neither the space-time world's creator nor\nits ruler. It follows from these considerations that Brahman is\nneither an omniscient mind nor an omnipotent and active will. It\ncannot be a maximally perfect person, therefore, and so\ncannot be God. \n\nAdvaita does contain what might be called “theistic\nelements.” For example, it distinguishes the nirguna from the\nsaguna Brahman.  The former is the Brahman without attributes. The\nlatter is the Brahman with attributes, and is roughly described in the\nway that theists describe God.  The nirguna Brahman is the\nBrahman as it really is, however, while the saguna Brahman is\nultimately illusory. The concept of the saguna Brahman is a useful\ntool for those who are still on their spiritual journey but is finally\ncast aside by the fully enlightened. Yet even though Advaita believes\nthat, like all conceptualizations of the Brahman, the idea of an\nomnipotent, omniscient, and all good cause of the space-time world is\nultimately false, they regard it as superior to others. Furthermore,\nAdvaita describes the real Brahman as an infinite, joyous\nconsciousness (albeit a consciousness that has no objects or contents\nand is thus “empty”). Because Advaita refuses to ascribe\neither knowledge or activity to ultimate reality, though, it is\nessentially non-theistic. Its maximally perfect reality isn't the God\nof the theistic traditions—all powerful, all knowing, all good,\nthe sovereign lord of heaven and earth. It is instead an\n“infinite ocean” of joyous empty\nconsciousness—impersonal, inactive, and anonymous. \n\nSome schools of Vedanta are theistic, however, and their response to\nAdvaita is instructive. Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, for example,\nmaintains that Brahman is personal and, indeed, the supreme\nperson (paramatman)—creator and lord (ishvara) who leads the\nworld's creatures to salvation. Far from being devoid of attributes,\nBrahman (which Vishishtadvaita identifies with Vishnu) is the sum of\nall “noble” attributes—omniscient,\nomnipotent, omnipresent, and all merciful. \n\nWhat accounts for this difference?  In part, the suspicion that the\nAdvaitin account of a maximally great reality is incoherent.  Ramanuja\n(1017?-1137?), for instance, argued that Advaita's conception of the\nBrahman is logically incoherent because it conceives of Brahman as a\nsubstance without properties whereas, by definition, a\nsubstance is what has or underlies\nproperties. Furthermore, because cognitively grasping something\ninvolves classifying or identifying it as a thing of a certain kind,\nand things are classified or identified on the basis of their\nproperties, one can't cognitively grasp a thing without properties. It\nfollows that the Advaitin's Brahman can't be known, and that Advaita\nitself thus doesn't know it. Finally, Ramanuja argued that the denial\nof the reality of distinctions undercuts Advaita's appeal to\nscripture. If the scriptures are valid, then some language accurately\ndescribes reality (for scriptural language does so). But language\nnecessarily involves distinctions (between subject and verb, noun and\nadjective, and the like) and so, if any language accurately describes\nreality, some distinctions must be real. Therefore, if distinctions\naren't real (as Advaita maintains), the scriptures it appeals\nto aren't valid. \n\nAdvaitins aren't without recourse, of course. For example, they will\ndeny that they are construing Brahman as a substance without\nproperties. Since, in their view, no concept applies to the\nBrahman, neither the concept of a property nor the concept of\nsubstance applies to it. Again, even if conceptual cognition\nnecessarily involves classification or identification, Advaitins will\ninsist that not all cognition is conceptual. The fact that Brahman\ncan't be conceptually cognized thus doesn't entail that it can't be\nknown.  The important point in the present connection however, is that\nthe Vishishtadvaitin's and Advaitin's disagreements on these issues\nare rooted in basic differences in metaphysics and\nepistemology—whether a reality without properties is possible,\nfor instance, and whether cognition involves at least some conceptual\ncontent. \n\nOther differences are even more fundamental. All the Vedantin schools\nprofess to elucidate the true meaning of a common set of\nscriptures—the Brahma Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita and,\npreeminently, the Vedas (especially their last part, the\nUpanishads). In practice, though, both theistic and non-theistic\nVedantins privilege some texts over others. Advaitins, privilege the\nIsha and other non-theistic Upanishads and interpret theistic sounding\ntexts in their light. Theistic Vedantins, on the other hand, privilege\nthe Bhagavad Gita and theistic Upanishads such as the Shvetashvatara\nUpanishad, taking these texts pretty much at face value, and then\nexplaining away apparent inconsistencies between their privileged\ntexts and others which, on their face, seem clearly non-theistic. \n\nThese differences are themselves rooted in fundamental differences in\nspiritual practice.  \n\nAdvaitins, for example, emphasize ascetic practices designed to\nexistentially appropriate the truth of the “great words”of\nscripture such as “Thou art that [you are the Brahman],”\n“All that is is one only,” or “All is one without\ndistinction,” and place a high value on “monistic”\nmystical experiences—joyous states of consciousness in which the\nmind is emptied of contents and distinctions disappear. While these\nexperiences aren't the aim of the Advaitin's quest, they are more or\nless explicitly regarded as a model of the unifying and transfiguring\nBrahman-knowledge that is the goal of their religious\njourney. Theistic Vedantins, on the other hand, were Vaishnavas\n(devotees of Vishnu), and their attitudes, outlook, and actions were\nprofoundly shaped by devotional practices designed to express and\ncultivate love of, and surrender to, Vishnu. While theistic Vedantins\ndid not deny the reality of monistic mystical consciousness, they\ndownplayed its significance for, in their view, the ultimate aim of\nthe religious life is an ecstatic and permanent loving union with God\n(Vishnu). \n\nIn short, while Advaitins and theistic Vedantins agree that the proper\nobject of ultimate concern is maximally great, they disagree on just\nhow maximal greatness should be construed. This disagreement, in turn,\nis rooted in metaphysical and epistemological disagreements, in\ndifferences in scriptural interpretation, and in differences in\nreligious practice and aspiration. The most fundamental difference,\nhowever, is, arguably, a difference in evaluation. Theistic Vedantins\nprize love in a way in which Advaitins do not. Since love is a\nrelation between persons, it is not surprising that, in their view,\nmaximal greatness necessarily includes personhood. \n\nBut while theists agree that a maximally great reality must be a\ntranscendently great person, they sometimes disagree over just what\nother attributes maximal greatness includes. Most theists do think\nthat God is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, and all good,\nalthough there are disagreements over just how these attributes should\nbe construed. Other differences are more radical. I will illustrate\nthis point by examining the debate over God's impassibility in western\ntheism and a dispute over God's relation to the space-time world in\nIndian theism. \n\nMost theists agree that God is (in Ramanuja's words) the\n“supreme self” or person—omniscient, omnipotent, and\nall good. But classical Christian theists have also ascribed\nfour “metaphysical attributes” to God—simplicity,\ntimelessness, immutability, and impassibility. The doctrine of\nsimplicity states that each of God's real or intrinsic properties is\nidentical with his other real or intrinsic properties, and with his\nbeing or nature.  God's knowledge is identical with his power, for\nexample, and both are identical with his being. Just as “Thomas\nJefferson” and “the third president of the United\nStates” have different meanings but refer to the same person, so\n“the knowledge of God” and “the power of God,”\nalthough differing in meaning, refer to the same reality, namely, the\ninfinitely perfect divine life or activity. \n\nMany classical western theists have also thought that God is\ntimeless—altogether outside of time. God resembles abstract\nobjects like numbers or propositions in having no temporal location or\nextension. God isn't an abstract object, of course, but an infinitely\nperfect life or activity. One shouldn't think of this life and\nactivity as being in time, however—not even as everlasting. Thus\nGod timelessly knows and wills that conscious life will emerge on\nearth after certain events and before others.  But while temporality\nis a property of what God knows and wills, it isn't a\nproperty of God's act of knowledge or will. The objects of\nGod's knowledge and act of will are in time but God himself and his\nactivity are not. \n\nGod is also believed to be immutable. Something is immutable if its\nreal properties can't change. Immutability follows from God's\nsimplicity. An object undergoes real change when it loses one real\nproperty and/or acquires another. Real change thus entails that some\nof the object's real properties aren't identical. (If P,\nQ, and R are real properties, and x retains\nP through a change but loses Q and acquires\nR, then P, Q, and R are different\nproperties.)  So if God is simple, he can't undergo real change. God's\nimmutability also follows from his timelessness since change entails a\ntemporal transition from one state to another. \n\nFinally, classical western theists have thought that God is\nimpassible. God creates, sustains, and governs the world.  It depends\non him both for its being and for its qualities. But nothing acts on\nGod or causally affects him. While the world is affected by God, God\nis not affected by it. \n\nWhy think that the metaphysical attributes are perfections?  For\nseveral reasons. Most religious traditions stress the imperfections of\nthe temporal order. The space-time world is a world in constant\nflux. Nothing in it is permanent or secure. All temporal values are\nthreatened and ultimately lost. In human experience, complexity, time,\nchange, and dependency are bound up with loss and imperfection. It\nthus isn't surprising that religiously sensitive people often conclude\nthat a maximally perfect reality must be free from them.  Moreover,\nthis conclusion is reinforced by the experiences of Christian and\nother mystics who claim to have glimpsed a divine reality exhibiting\nthe metaphysical attributes—a holy unity transcending\ndistinctions and time and change, wholly active and never passive, and\nupon which they and everything else are absolutely dependent. \n\nThere are obvious tensions between these themes and other strands of\nthe Christian tradition, however. Even though the Bible asserts that\nGod is beginningless and endless, for example, he is depicted as if he\nwere in time. He is also depicted as changing (although his existence\nand character are said to remain constant). In addition, the God of\nthe Bible not only acts upon his creatures, he is affected by\nthem—pitying their distress, being angered by their sin,\nresponding to their petitions, and the like. These considerations\naren't conclusive of course since even the most scripturally centered\ntheists agree that not everything in the Biblical pictures can be\ntaken literally. God isn't literally jealous, for instance, nor does\nhe literally repent of his former actions. So perhaps those features\nof the Biblical picture of God which seem inconsistent with God's\npossessing metaphysical attributes can also be interpreted as\nmetaphors or analogies or symbols. Other difficulties are more\nserious, however.  God's personality is essential to theism, and many\nwonder whether personhood is compatible with simplicity, timelessness,\nimmutability, and impassibility. One may also wonder whether a God\nwith these attributes is the God of popular devotion. We will explore\nthis question by examining the attribute of impassibility in more\ndepth. \n\nAccording to the doctrine of impassibility, God is not affected by his\ncreatures. Everything other than God depends upon him for both its\nexistence and qualities. God himself, though, depends upon\nnothing. Critics think this has two unacceptable consequences. \n\nIn the first place, impassibility seems inconsistent with God's\nknowledge of the world. Knowledge relates two terms, the knower and\nthe object he or she knows. Typical instances of the relation exhibit\ntwo important features. First, the act of knowledge involves a real\nmodification of the knower but not of the object he or she knows. And,\nsecond, the act of knowledge depends on its object while the object of\nknowledge does not depend on the subject's knowledge of it. I know,\nfor example, that the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Superbowl in\n2006. But while my knowledge that the Steelers won is a real property\nof mine, it is not a real property of the Steelers' victory. Knowing\nthat the Steelers won the Superbowl really modifies me (I am\ninternally different than I would have been if I did not know that\nthey had won); it does not modify or make a real difference to the\nSteelers' winning. Moreover, my knowledge that the Steelers won\ndepends on the Steelers having won whereas the Steelers' winning does\nnot depend on my knowledge of it. \n\nBut if God is impassible, his knowledge of the world can't be like\nthat. For the doctrine of impassibility implies that God's real\nproperties depend on nothing other than himself.  So if God's\nknowledge of the world is a real property of God (as theists have\nusually thought), it cannot depend on its object and is thus very\ndifferent from paradigmatic instances of knowledge like the one\ndiscussed in the previous paragraph.  \n\nOne way of handling this difficulty is to claim that everything other\nthan God is determined by him. Many theists believe that it is. Madhva\n(whom we will discuss later), orthodox Muslims, Augustine, Luther,\nCalvin, and some Thomists are examples. In their view, God knows that\nthe Steelers won the Superbowl in 2006 because he eternally decreed\nthat they would. God's knowledge of their victory is an aspect or\nconsequence of his willing it and thus doesn't depend on it. \n\nHowever, other theists believe that God does not fully determine\neverything. In their view some of our actions are free in the\nmetaphysical libertarian's sense. They lack sufficient causes, and\nthus aren't determined either by antecedent natural conditions\nor by God's decrees. If they aren't, God can't know them in\nknowing his decrees.  So, in this case at least, God's knowledge\nappears to depend upon its object. But if it does, God cannot be\nimpassible. (It should be noted that this difficulty can't be evaded\nby appealing to the doctrine of middle knowledge.\n  \n For even though God's knowledge of our free actions does not depend\nupon those actions on this view, it does depend upon his\nknowledge of what creatures would freely do in various circumstances\nin which he might place them, and the truth of subjunctive\nconditionals like “If Adam were placed in the Garden of Eden, he\nwould freely sin,” while contingent, is not determined by\nGod.) \n\nThe second and more pressing problem for the doctrine of divine\nimpassibility, however, is this. All theists describe God as\ncompassionate. Each chapter of the Quran, for instance,\nbegins with the words “In the name of Allah, the compassionate\nand merciful.” Yet if God really is compassionate, then it would\nseem that his knowledge of free actions isn't the only divine property\nthat depends upon the world, for his affective states do so as\nwell. God isn't aloof or unmoved by our distress but shares our griefs\nas we share those of people we love. His joy is thus tempered by\nsympathetic sorrow. The degree and quality of God's happiness is\npartly determined by the state of sentient creatures. \n\nCharles Hartshorne, for instance, has argued that while certain forms\nof independence are admirable others are not. “One should not\nsimply agree to every whim of [one's] child,” for example,\n“but neither should one try to act and think and feel just as\none would have acted or thought or felt had the child's joy been\nsorrow, or her sorrow joy…” Nor is there anything\nadmirable about a happiness that is unaffected by the sorrows of\nothers. We don't admire people who “can be equally happy and\nserene and joyous regardless of how men and women suffer around”\nthem. (Hartshorne: 43–44) Human sympathies are\nnecessarily limited, of course. But a perfect being would be\nmaximally responsive to the joys and sufferings of other. If\nit is, it could not be impassible. \n\nClassical Christian theology provides several attempts to reconcile\nGod's compassion with his impassibility. Thus, Anselm argued that\nwhile God acts as if he were compassionate, he does not\nexperience compassion. “For when You look upon us in\nour misery it is we who feel the effect of Your mercy, but You do not\nexperience the feeling. Therefore you are both merciful because You\nsave the sorrowful and pardon sinners against You; and You are not\nmerciful because You do not experience any feeling of compassion for\nmisery.” (Anselm: chapter viii) This seems unsatisfactory,\nhowever, for a compassion without feeling isn't real compassion. A\nrecognition of this may have led Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas\nAquinas to offer their own, rather different, solutions. \n\nBernard claimed that while God neither suffers nor experiences\ncompassion in his own nature, he does suffer and experience\ncompassion in the human nature that he assumes at the Incarnation. God\nbecame man so that he might “learn by his own experience how to\ncommiserate and sympathize with those who are…suffering and\ntempted.” (Bernard: chapter 3). Bernard's solution is superior\nto Anselm's because it implicitly recognizes that compassion\nnecessarily includes feeling or emotion. It isn't available to\nnon-Christian theists, however, and fails to locate compassion in the\ndivine nature itself. \n\nThomas Aquinas's solution does so. Some emotions can be literally\n(albeit analogically) ascribed to God. Love and joy are\nexamples. Other emotions such as anger and sorrow cannot.  What\naccounts for this difference?  Love and joy are “pure\nperfections” (good-making properties that entail no\nimperfection). As such they can be literally ascribed to God although\nthe mode in which God experiences them differs from that in which we\ndo so. (God's love and joy are purely active emotions, qualifications\nof his will. Our love and joy, on the other hand, are both actions\nand passions, partly voluntary and partly involuntary\nreactions of our animal nature.) \n\nAnger and sorrow can be appropriate, and hence good-making, qualities\nof the person who experiences them. But they are not pure\nperfections because they entail perturbation and suffering. They\ncannot, then, be literally ascribed to God.  Even so, compassionate\nsorrow differs from anger. When God acts as a justifiably angry person\nwould we can ascribe anger to God metaphorically. But nothing\nin God (no internal modification of God) corresponds to the\nfeeling or emotion of anger in us. By contrast, “God is said to\nbe saddened in so far as certain things take place contrary to what He\nloves and approves.” (Aquinas: Book One, chapter 7, #17) Hence,\nwhile God doesn't literally grieve with us, there is something\nin God that we apprehend as sorrow, namely, his love.  For\nAquinas, “God is compassionate” not only entails that God\nacts as a compassionate person would (as it does for Anselm), it also\nentails that those actions are expressions of a divine emotion or\n“feeling state”—an emotion or feeling state which\nqualifies the divine nature itself, and not just the assumed\nhuman nature (as Bernard thought). \n\nWhile Aquinas's solution is superior to those of Anselm and Bernard,\nit does have problems. Aquinas's distinction between anger and\ncompassion may be specious, since it seems that both could be treated\nin the same way. Since God's righteousness or love of justice is a\npure perfection we can ascribe it to God literally. God's anger can\nthen be interpreted as the way God's righteousness is apprehended by\nthose who have rejected him or recognize that he has been\nrejected. God not only acts as a justifiably angry person would act,\nthose acts are the expression of an internal modification (namely, his\nlove of justice) which is a real property of God's own being. A more\nimportant problem, though, may be the fact that the emotion or feeling\nstate which grounds God's acts of compassion, according to Aquinas,\nisn't literally tinged with sorrow. For it is at least doubtful that a\n“compassion” that doesn't include sympathetic\nsuffering is really compassion. \n\nThe most important point in the present connection, however, is\nthis. The debate between modern theists like Hartshorne, on the one\nhand, and classical theists like Aquinas, on the other, revolves\naround the following question: Can a maximally perfect being be\ntouched by suffering? Hartshorne thinks it must since a maximally\nperfect being would be maximally responsive to the joys and sorrows of\nothers, and would therefore grieve with all who grieve. Friedrich von\nHügel, on the other hand, speaks for the tradition when he says\nthat not only is suffering intrinsically evil, it is inconsistent with\nunalloyed goodness and perfect joy. God is “Perfect Love,\nUnmixed Joy, Entire Delectation…We will not admit the presence\nof any Evil, be it sin or even only sorrow, be they actual or even\nonly potential, in Him Who thus dwarfs for us all our little human\ngoodness and earthly joy by his utter Sanctity and sheer\nBeatitude.” (von Hügel: 208–09) The controversy over\nGod's impassibility is thus ultimately rooted in a clash of value\nintuitions, a deep disagreement over what properties God must have to\nbe unqualifiedly admirable and worthy of worship. \n\nOur second example of how a dispute over what constitutes maximal\ngreatness can affect one's concept of God is furnished by a\ndisagreement between the great Vishishtadvaitin, Ramanuja, and the\nfounder of the Dvaita school of Vedanta, Madhva (1197–1276). \n\nVishishtadvaita maintains that God is related to the world as the soul\n(jivatman) is related to its body. According to Ramanuja, bodies are\n“absolutely dependent” upon their souls. A soul-body\nrelationship is a relation between (1) support and thing supported\n(bodies are incapable of separate existence), (2) controller and thing\ncontrolled, and (3) “principal” (sheshin) and\n“accessory” (shesha). (“The accessory is that whose\n[whole] nature is…to render due glory to…the\nprincipal.” [Ramanuja, quoted in Lipner: 131], that which can\nfulfill itself only in serving its principal. Examples of\nprincipal-accessory relationships are the relation between an owner\nand his or her disposable property and the relation between a master\nand “born servant.”) The point of saying that bodies are\nrelated to souls as supported to support and controlled to controller\nis that bodies are ontologically and epistemically dependent on\nsouls. They can neither exist nor act apart from them, and they can\nonly be understood in relation to them. The point of saying that\nbodies are related to souls as accessory to principal is that bodies\nare also evaluatively dependent on their souls—they\nhave no worth apart from their relation to them. \n\nTo say that the world is God's body, then, is to say that God is the\nworld's support, controller, and principal. Just as bodies are\nabsolutely dependent on their souls, so the world is absolutely\ndependent on God. And, in fact, the dependence in the latter case is\neven more complete than it is in the former. For souls need bodies to\naccomplish their purposes whereas God does not need the\nworld. (In support of this contention, Ramanuja quotes the Bhagavad\nGita: “I am the supporter of all beings; they are of no help to\nme at any time.” [Lott: 49]) Moreover, human bodies enjoy a\ncertain temporary and limited independence when death separates them\nfrom their souls. The world's dependence on God, on the other hand, is\ncomplete.  The upshot is that the body-soul relation is only fully\nexemplified by the world-God relation. The world is absolutely\ndependent on God; God in no way depends upon it. (It is worth noting\nthat classical western theism's principal objections to the claim that\nthe world is God's body—that it makes God dependent on the world\nand subject to its imperfections—aren't relevant to Ramanuja's\nposition. For, in the latter's view, not only does the dependence\nrelation run only one way [from body to soul and not vice versa], but\nthe body's defects do not affect the soul.) \n\nRamanuja and Madhva were both theists, both Vedantins, and both\nVaishnavas (that is, both identified God with Vishnu), sharing a\ncommon allegiance to the same set of scriptures and engaging in\nsimilar religious practices. Yet in spite of these similarities, the\nflavor of their views is quite different. The central motif of\nMadhva's theology is God's infinite majesty, utter transcendence, and\nabsolute sovereignty: “What is incompatible with the divine\nsovereignty should be rejected. Inconsistency with the divine majesty\nis itself the criterion of what is unworthy of acceptance.”\n(Madhva, quoted in Lott: 58) This motif works itself out in a number\nof ways. For example, while Ramanuja has a very strong doctrine of\ngrace, he appears to allow some room for libertarian free will. Madhva\ndoes not. From eternity souls have different qualities or\npotentialities (different “aptitudes”). Because of the\neternal difference in their qualities and potentialities, souls have\ndifferent destinies. Some (those with “an innate aptitude for\ngood”) are destined for various levels of bliss. Others (those\nwith “an innate aptitude for evil”) are destined for\ndifferent levels of suffering. (Thus Dvaita is one of the few Hindu\nschools with something like a doctrine of eternal damnation. Some\nsouls are permanently bound to this world with its endless cycle of\nbirths and rebirths.)  The important point is that these differences\nin the souls' qualities and potentialities (“aptitudes”)\nare determined by God's will.  Hence, says Madhva, “The Lord is\nthe real doer, and the cause of the soul's activity.” (Quoted in\nLott: 114) Everything depends upon the divine will, and salvation is\nthrough grace alone. (It should be noted that Madhva's view was\nmodified by some of his followers. Thus Vyasa Raya [1460–1539]\ninsisted that because innate aptitudes for good or for evil are\nbeginningless, they are not caused by God.) \n\nMadhva's most striking departure from Ramanuja, however, is his\nabsolute rejection of the notion that the world is God's body. In\nMadhva's opinion, the Vishishtadvaitin view compromises God's\ntranscendence and independence. The relation between God and the world\nisn't a relation between a soul and its body but between a sovereign\nwill and its effect.  “He is the supreme Lord by whose grace\nexist matter, action (karma), time, nature and souls, and by\nwhose displeasure all these cease to exist.” (Quoted in Lott:\n111) However, surprisingly (from a western perspective at least),\nMadhva thinks that while prakriti (the material or stuff out of which\nthe space-time world is composed), time, space, and souls derive their\nqualities from God, they don't derive their\nexistence or substantial being from him. God's being and\nactivity explain why spatio-temporal things have the properties they\ndo but doesn't explain why they exist in the first place. \n\nRamanuja, by contrast, thinks that it does. Because bodies depend upon\nsouls for their existence, and the world is God's body, the world\ndepends upon God for its being as well as for its qualities. The\nworld's dependence upon God is thus more complete in Ramanuja's\ntheology than it is in Madhva's. \n\nWhat accounts for this difference?  Why, in particular, does Madhva\nadopt a position which seems inconsistent with his emphasis on God's\nabsolute sovereignty?  The answer appears to Madhva's equally emphatic\ninsistence on God's transcendence and independence. \n\nIndian thought tended to assume that the cause of a thing's being or\nexistence must be a kind of material or substratum (a “material\ncause”) which is then shaped or formed to make it an existent\nbeing of a particular sort—an existent elephant, for example, or\nan existent earth or water atom. The substratum is the cause of a\nthing's being or existence; the process of shaping or forming is the\ncause of its being a particular kind of being or existent,\nthat is, of its having one set of qualities rather than\nanother. (Thus, the potter's activity causes the clay to be a\npot; but the clay gives the pot its being or existence.)  If\nGod were the cause of the existence of the world as well as the cause\nof its qualities (that is, if he were its material as well as its\nefficient cause), then God would be the world's substratum. (As he in\na sense is for Ramanuja. Prakriti is the world's substratum, and\nprakriti, according to Ramanuja, is an aspect of God's body.)  But\nthis is inconsistent with God's transcendence and independence of the\nworld. If God is truly perfect, then, he cannot be the cause of the\nworld's existence. \n\nThis example is particularly instructive because it illustrates how an\nemphasis on different aspects of God's perfection (the absolute\ndependence of everything other than God on God, on the one hand, and\nGod's transcendence and independence, on the other) can cause\ntheologians with otherwise quite similar views to draw very different\nconclusions about God. \n\nAre limited deities counter examples to this entry's claim that\nreligious consciousness tends to construe ultimate reality as\nmaximally perfect?  Most apparent counter examples are merely\napparent. The limited deity is either not thought to be ultimate or it\nisn't really believed to be limited (that is, less perfect than a\nbeing could possibly be). The following two examples illustrate these\npossibilities. \n\nPlato introduced the concept of the demiurge (from the Greek\ndemiourgos, meaning “artisan” or\n“craftsman”) in his Timaeus. Being perfectly\ngood, the demiurge wishes to communicate his own goodness. Using the\nForms as a model, he shapes the initial chaos into the best possible\nimage of these eternal and immutable archetypes. The visible world is\nthe result. The demiurge is the highest god and the best of causes. He\nis nonetheless limited. For the material he shapes isn't created by\nhim and, because it is disorderly and indeterminate, partially resists\nhis ordering. The demiurge is not ultimate, however, since his\nontological and axiological status is lower than that of the Forms,\nespecially the Form of the Good. Plato's concept of the demiurge thus\nisn't a counter example to the thesis that religious consciousness\ntends to construe ultimate reality as maximally perfect. \n\nThe God of process philosophy illustrates the second\npossibility. While differences among process philosophers make\ngeneralizations difficult, its critics accuse its God of being a mere\ndemiurge, one power among others who, while influencing everything,\ncontrols nothing. Whether God, rather than the process of becoming of\nwhich God is a part, is ultimate in this system is a moot point. More\nimportant for our purposes, however, is the fact that the God of the\nmost theologically interesting process philosopher is thought\nto be maximally perfect. Charles Hartshorne agrees that God's power\nand knowledge are limited. While God influences everything that\ntranspires he neither determines nor controls it. Nor does God know\nwith any certainty just what the future holds in store.  But\nHartshorne denies that these “limitations” are\nimperfections. In his view, persuasion or influence is a better or\nmore perfect form of power than control, and knowledge of the\ncontingent future is metaphysically impossible. Although God's power\nand knowledge are limited, they are as perfect as power and\nknowledge could possibly be. If a maximally perfect being is the most\nperfect possible being, then God is maximally\nperfect. \n\nJohn Stuart Mill's picture of God, on the other hand, may constitute a\ngenuine counter example to the thesis that conceptions of God are\nattempts to articulate the concept of a maximally great ultimate\nreality. Mill believes that there is some evidence for the existence\nof a “demiourgos” of enormous power and intelligence, and\nsome benevolence. But because nature's contrivances are imperfect,\nbecause omnipotence could altogether dispense with contrivances,\nand because organisms are principally contrived for the mere persistence\nof the individual or species and not for pleasure or happiness,\nthe evidence not only fails to point to a being of unlimited\npower, intelligence, and benevolence, it is actually\nincompatible with it. Still, the evidence is\ncompatible with the existence of a being of limited power and/or\nintelligence but unlimited benevolence. Furthermore, there are good\npragmatic reasons for imaginatively dwelling on the possibility that\nsuch a being exists, and for hoping that it does. For if the\ndemiurge's benevolence is infinite then, given its enormous power and\nintelligence, there is some reason to think that death will not have\nthe last word and that good will eventually get the upper hand over\nevil. And “the beneficial effect” of this “hope with\nregard to the government of the universe and the destiny of man after\ndeath…is far from trifling. It makes life and human nature a\nfar greater thing to the feelings and gives greater strength as well\nas a great solemnity to all” our nobler sentiments and to our\nresolve to “cultivate the improvement of character up to the end\nof life.” Furthermore, “there is another and a most\nimportant exercise of the imagination which…has been kept up\nprincipally by means of religious belief” which reinforces the\nfirst, and which Mill not only countenances but endorses since\n“human excellence greatly depends upon the sufficiency of the\nprovision made for it”—“the idealization of our\nstandard of excellence in a person.” (Mill: 81–82) \n\nDoes Mill's position provide a counter example to our thesis?  The\nanswer isn't entirely straightforward. On the one hand, Mill doesn't\nbegin with the idea of a maximally great reality as mature\nreligious consciousness normally does, and then—given his\nmetaphysical, empirical, and evaluative commitments—ask\nhow maximal greatness should be construed On the other hand,\nMill's reflections on religion are shaped from their\nbeginning by his conceptions of value—of what is truly\n“God-befitting” or worthy of admiration and\nemulation. But, for Mill what matters for humankind's spiritual growth\nand development are ideals of moral, not metaphysical\nperfection.  It isn't surprising, then, that in spite of the fact that\nMill's divinity isn't maximally perfect tout court, it is\nmaximally morally perfect. In short, while Mill's reflections\non God aren't driven by a concept of maximal perfection simpliciter,\nthey are importantly driven by a concept of maximal moral\nperfection."}]
