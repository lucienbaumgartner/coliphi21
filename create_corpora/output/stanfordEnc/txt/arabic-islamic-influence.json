The\nimpact of Arabic philosophers such as al-Fārābī,\nAvicenna and Averroes on Western philosophy was particularly strong in\nnatural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics, but also extended to\nlogic and ethics.\n\n\nAmong the influential Arabic theories are: the logical distinction\nbetween first and second intentions; the intension and remission of\nelementary forms; the soul’s faculty of estimation and its\nobject, the intentions; the conjunction between human intellect and\nseparate active intellect; the unicity of the material intellect\n(Averroism); naturalistic theories of miracles and prophecy; the\neternity of the world and the concept of eternal creation; the active\nintellect as giver of forms; the first cause as necessary being in\nitself; the emanation of intelligences from the first cause; the\ndistinction between essence and existence; the theory of primary\nconcepts; the concept of human happiness as resulting from perfect\nconjunction of the human intellect with the active intellect.\n\nArabic Philosophy was known in the Latin West through translations,\nand, to a small degree, through personal contacts between Christians\nand Muslims, as in the case of Frederick II Hohenstaufen, who was\ndirectly acquainted with a number of Muslim scholars. A small number\nof Christian scholars, such as Ramón Martí and\nRamón Llull, knew Arabic themselves and drew on Arabic sources\nwhen composing Latin works. Translations, however, were far more\ninfluential. The first Arabic-Latin translations to transport\nphilosophical material into Latin Europe were the translations of\ntexts on medicine and natural philosophy produced towards the end of\nthe eleventh century in Italy, most of them by the translator\nConstantine the African, who, in contrast to later translators, tried\nto disguise the Arabic origin of his texts (Burnett 2006,\n22–24). In Spain, in the first half of the twelfth century,\nseveral important astrological texts were translated, such as\nAlbumasar’s Great Introduction to Astrology, which\nincorporated much material of the Aristotelian tradition (Lemay\n1962). \nThe translations of philosophical texts proper, such as by\nal-Kindī, by the anonymous author of the Liber de\ncausis, by al-Fārābī, Isaac Israeli,\nal-Ghazālī and Avicenna, but also of Greek works transmitted\nin Arabic, assumed full pace in Toledo in the second half of the\ntwelfth century, where two very prolific translators worked: Gerard of\nCremona and Dominicus Gundisalvi. It is likely that\nal-Fārābī’s treatise Enumeration of the\nSciences, translated twice, by Gerard and Gundisalvi, served as a\nmodel for a coherent translation program. An indication of this is\nthat later Toledan translators such as Alfred of Shareshill, Michael\nScot and Hermannus Alemannus filled in gaps in\nal-Fārābī’s list of disciplines which the earlier\ntranslators had not covered (Burnett 2001). The translation movement\nwas also influenced by the philosophical preferences of Jewish\nscholars. Gundisalvi worked together with the Jewish scholar Avendauth\nwhen translating Avicenna’s De anima, which Avendauth\nhad recommended for translation, and Gundisalvi’s other\ntranslations may also go back to such recommendations. The impressive\nSpanish translation movement was motivated and fostered by several\nfactors: the personal interest of individual translators; the demand\nfor scientific texts by the French schools; the availability of Arabic\nmanuscripts in cities newly conquered by the Christians; the patronage\nof the archbishop of Toledo; and by clerical interests in promoting\nLatin scientific culture in an Arabic-speaking Christian environment\n(Hasse 2006, 79–84). \nThe next important phase of the transmission were the translations\nmade in Sicily and southern Italy by several translators associated\nwith the Hohenstaufen or the papal court, the most productive of which\nwere the Averroes translators Michael Scot and William of Luna. It was\nonly about thirty years after Averroes’ death in 1198 that Latin\nAverroes translations became available in the newly developing\nuniversities (Gauthier 1982b). In 1255, the statutes of the Parisian\narts faculty declared all known works of Aristotle mandatory reading\nfor the students – a very influential move, which much\ncontributed to the rise of Averroes’ commentaries as the\nprincipal secondary literature of Latin university culture. \nAfter about 1300, Arabic-Latin translation activities ceased almost\nentirely, to resume again after 1480. The Renaissance translations\nwere mostly produced by Italian Jews from Hebrew versions of Arabic\ntexts, an exception being Andrea Alpago’s Avicenna translations\nfrom Arabic, which were produced in Damascus (Tamani 1992; Burnett\n1999; Hasse 2016, ch. 3). The social context of these translations was\nthe vibrant philosophical culture of Italian universities and\nespecially of Padua, and the patronage of Italian scholars belonging\nto the Italian nobility, who had been educated in these universities. The impact of these Renaissance translations, which is\nweaker than that of the medieval translations, remains largely\nunexplored. It has aleady been shown that the new translations\ninfluenced the logical and zoological discussions of the sixteenth\ncentury (Perfetti 2000, 106–109; Perfetti 2004,\nXVII–XVIII; Burnett 2013). In the second half of the sixteenth\ncentury, interest in Arabic philosophy and sciences declined, and with\nit the Arabic-(Hebrew-)Latin translation movement. At the same time,\nthe new academic study of Arabic culture developed, which was\nmotivated primarily by historical and philological, but not by\nphilosophical interests. From the seventeenth century onwards,\ntranslations into vernacular languages gradually replaced Latin\ntranslations from Arabic (Bobzin 1992). \nThe corpus of Arabic philosophical texts translated into Latin was\nsubstantial: A recent publication lists 131 textual items (Burnett\n2005; see Kischlat 2000, 53–54, 196–198 for manuscript\ndistribution; on Avicenna translations see Bertolacci 2011 and 2013b;\non translator attribution see Hasse & Büttner 2018). The\nintroduction of Arabic philosophy into Latin Europe led to the\ntransformation of almost all philosophical disciplines. The influence\nis particularly dominant in natural philosophy, psychology and\nmetaphysics, but is also felt in logic and ethics. The Arabic impact\nis particularly strong in the thirteenth century, but some Arabic\ntraditions, such as Averroes’ intellect theory, reach the high\npoint of their influence in Latin Europe as late as around 1500 (The\ninfluence of Jewish philosophers writing in Arabic, such as Ibn\nGabirol and Maimonides, is not covered in this article). \nArabic divisions of the sciences influenced the Latin West mainly\nthrough Dominicus Gundisalvi’ treatise Division of\nPhilosophy (De divisione philosophiae). In this text,\nGundisalvi reuses much material from his own abbreviating translation\nof al-Fārābī’s Enumeration of the\nSciences (Iḥṣāʾ\nal-ʿulūm), of which a second, more literal translation\nwas produced by Gerard of Cremona. But it was Gundisalvi’s own\nArabicized treatise which was the main channel of\nal-Fārābī’s influence. The mostly anonymous\nintroductory literature for artes students of the thirteenth\ncentury draws amply on Gundisalvi’s treatise, sometimes\nreferring to Gundisalvi as “Alpharabius” (Lafleur 1988,\n341n). The translator Michael Scot also writes his own Division of\nphilosophy, in which he adopts substantial material from Gundisalvi,\nbut arranges it according to his own scheme (Burnett 1997). \nGundisalvi adopts central principles for the division of the sciences\nfrom Avicenna: that the principal criterion of division between the\nsciences is their subject matter; that a science cannot demonstrate\nthe existence of its own subject matter; and that there are two kinds\nof subordination of a science: either as a part (pars) of\nanother science, when it studies a part of its subject matter, or as a\nspecies (species) of another science, when it studies the\nsubject matter in a specific respect (Hugonnard-Roche 1984;\nFidora & Werner 2007, 24–35). \nAl-Fārābī’s influence is particularly obvious in\nthe enumeration of the seven parts of grammar, the eight parts of\nnatural science (covering the spectrum of Aristotle’s libri\nnaturales), and the seven parts of mathematics: arithmetic,\nmusic, geometry, optics, astrology, astronomy, the science of weights,\nthe science of technical devices (ingenia) (see the tables in\nBouyges 1923, 65–69). As to the discipline of logic, Gundisalvi\nexplicitly embraces al-Fārābī’s division into\neight parts, following the tradition which makes Aristotle’s\nRhetoric and Poetic parts of logic. The Farabian\ndivision of logic into eight parts reappears, for example, in Roger\nBacon (Maierù 1987) and in Arnoul de Provence’s\nDivision of the Sciences (ca. 1250); Arnoul remarks that\nneither Aristotle nor common usage includes Rhetoric and\nPoetic among the parts of logic (Lafleur 1988, 342).\nGundisalvi further distinguishes with al-Fārābī between\nfive kinds of syllogistic reasoning, of which demonstration is the\nhighest. Al-Fārābī’s emphasis on demonstration as\nthe pivotal means for the acquisition of certain knowledge is an\nimportant innovation of Arabic philosophy, which reached the Latin\nWest via Gundisalvi (Fidora 2007). \nThe influence of al-Fārābī’s Enumeration of\nthe Sciences extends also to specific areas such as music (Farmer\n1934, 31–34). In general, al-Fārābī’s and\nGundisalvi’s works were instrumental in disseminating a\nsystematic division of the sciences which integrated the full range of\nAristotle’s works and a broad spectrum of sciences, many of\nwhich were new to the Latin West (Burnett 2011). \nThe Arabic influence in logic is thinner than in other disciplines\n(apart from ethics), because only a few works of Arabic logic were\ntranslated into Latin. The most influential translations were the\nIsagoge part of Avicenna’s summa The Healing\n(al-Shifāʾ) and al-Ghazālī’s\nIntentions of the Philosophers, the first part of which is a\nreworking of Avicennian logic. Ramón Llull produced an Arabic\ncompendium of al-Ghazālī’s text, which he himself\ntranslated into Latin (Lohr 1965). To these sources one may add\nal-Fārābī’s Enumeration of the Sciences,\nwhich transmitted much material on logical disciplines. Hermannus\nAlemannus’ translation of Averroes’ commentary on the\nPoetics was important because it remained the only source on\nAristotelian poetics available in the Middle Ages and had a rich\nmanuscript transmission (for its influence on Petrarch’s\nnegative judgement about Arabic poetry see Burnett 1997). Other\ntranslated texts remained largely uninfluential, such as William of\nLuna’s translations of five commentaries by Averroes on\nAristotle’s logical works, or the Averroes translations made\nfrom Hebrew in the Renaissance. In sum, this means that the Latin West\nwas not aware of the more innovative parts of Arabic logic, such as in\nsyllogistics and modal logic (Street 2005). \nSeveral particular doctrines of Arabic logic, however, were very\ninfluential. Among them was Avicenna’s theory of the subject\nmatter of logic, with its related doctrine of first and second\nintentions. Avicenna’s basic claim is that logic deals with\nsecond-order concepts. This is discussed in the logic part of The\nHealing, but spelled out in technical vocabulary in the\nmetaphysics part (Metaphysics I,2): “The subject matter\nof logic is the secondary intelligible concepts\n(al-maʿānī al-maʿqūla\nal-thāniyya, intentiones intellectae secundo),\nwhich depend on the primary intelligible concepts with respect to the\nmanner by which one arrives through them at the unknown from the\nknown”. In this sentence, “concept”\n(maʿnan) is rendered in Latin with the term\nintentio. \nA brief note on this term is at place: In Arabic-Latin translation\nliterature, intentio is very often used to render\nma´nan, with the consequence that the term\nintentio took on a similarly broad semantic range as its\nArabic counterpart. In the writings of Avicenna, maʿnan\nmay mean “concept”, but also “meaning” of a\nword, or something “intelligible” by the intellect, or\n“perceptible” by estimation but not by the external senses\n(on estimation see section 5.1). In Averroes’ epistemology, the\nterm maʿnan has a specific meaning as the object of\nmemory and a broader meaning as the abstracted content of sensory,\nimaginative or intelligible forms (Black 1996, 166). \nIn Avicenna’s theory of logic, second intentions are defined as\nthe properties of concepts which these concepts acquire when used in\nattaining knowledge, for example: being a subject or being a\npredicate, being a premise or being a syllogism. Avicenna thus\nconfirms that logic has a proper subject matter, and hence becomes a\nfull-fledged part of philosophy, and not only a tool for the\nphilosophical disciplines (Sabra 1980, 752–753).\nAvicenna’s definition of logic appears already in Dominicus\nGundisalvi (De divisione philosophiae 150). Further Latin\nwriters to adopt Avicenna’s thesis that the subject matter of\nlogic is second intentions are Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas,\nfollowed by many subsequent authors such as Pseudo-Robert Kilwardby,\nRadulphus Brito, Hervaeus Natalis, Peter Aureoli, Duns Scotus and\nWilliam of Ockham (Knudsen 1982; Maierù 1987; Perler 1994). \nIt was a matter of dispute how first and second intentions differ,\nwhat they refer to and what their ontological status is, a dispute\nbordering on epistemology and the philosophy of mind. Important\nparticipants in this discussion are Roger Bacon, who defines\nintentions as intelligible species, that is, mental likenesses of\nthings, and Hervaeus Natalis and Peter Aureoli, who (apart from\ndisagreeing on many issues) both hold that intentions are neither\nidentical with extramental things nor with qualities of the intellect;\nthey have their own “intentional being” (esse\nintentionale), which is the result of a cognitive act (Perler\n1994). This position was criticized both by nominalists and realists:\nthe nominalist William of Ockham objected against the reification of\nintentions and held that intentions are always natural signs in the\nmind; second intentions are natural signs which signify other natural\nsigns (Summa logicae I.12); the realist author Walter Burley\nrejects the idea of a special being of intentions and argues that\nsecond intentions are part of extramental reality (Knudsen 1982).\nLogic as the science of second intentions continued to be a\nphilosophical topic well into the sixteenth century, especially among\nThomists and Scotist authors. \nNatural philosophy is the field with the greatest number of\nArabic-Latin translations. In this discipline, Arabic philosophers had\nbeen particularly active, and Latin philosophers were particularly\ninterested. Arabic natural philosophy reached the Latin West earlier\nthan the other philosophical disciplines. The medical and astrological\ntranslations of the late eleventh and early twelfth century\ntransported much philosophical material of the Graeco-Arabic tradition\nto the Latin world. Under the influence of these Arabic sources, Latin\nauthors of the twelfth century explained natural phenomena by recourse\nto the four elements, the four qualities, the four humours, the three\nspiritus (natural, spiritual, animal) and their organs, the\nlocalization of the soul’s faculties in different cavities of\nthe brain, the distinction between the sublunar and the heavenly\nuniverse, the circular movement of the heavenly spheres, and by using\nAristotelian concepts such as matter and form, action and passion,\ncause and effect. While many Latin writers of the twelfth century\ncontinued to understand nature in terms of the Latin Christian\ntradition, others, in the context of the so-called “school of\nChartres”, such as William of Conches, Adelard of Bath, Hermann\nof Carinthia and Bernardus Silvestris, drew amply on the new medical\nand astrological sources, often combining them with the doctrines of\nPlato’s Timaeus (Burnett 1982, introduction; cf. also\nLemay 1962). Sometimes they did this by openly dividing their\npresentation into a section according to the church fathers and a\nsection according to the philosophers and natural scientists\n(physici), which integrated material from the Latin and\nArabic philosophical traditions (e.g. the treatises\nPhilosophia by William of Conches and De natura corporis\net animae by William of St.-Thierry). \nThe influence of Arabic in natural philosophy in the later Middle\nAges, that is, after the translations of Avicenna and Averroes, is\nparticularly strong in psychology (section 5 below). But other\ndisciplines, such as physics, cosmology, meteorology, or zoology, are\nalso influenced by Arabic sources (see Mandosio 2018 on meteorology),\nin particular by Averroes’ commentaries and by his criticisms of\nAvicenna (listed in Cerami 2018). Several theses from Averroes’\nlong commentaries on Physics and De caelo influenced\nthe history of medieval Latin physics and cosmology: the explanation\nof projectile motion (e.g. of a thrown stone) as the successive motion\nof the medium; the thesis that motion and time differ in reality, but\nonly with respect to the numbering soul; and the theory that the\nheavenly sphere is in a place only accidentally, insofar as it moves\naround the earth at its center (Maier 1951; Wood 2010; Trifogli 2000;\nTrifogli 2010). \nOne issue on which Avicenna and Averroes disagreed was the “form\nof bodiliness” (ṣūra jismiyya, forma\ncorporeitatis), which, Avicenna argued, is the common form of\nprime matter that underlies all individual bodily forms, whereas\nAverroes denied that the “form of corporeality” is a form\nin the category of substance; it is only an accident, to be identified\nwith indeterminate three-dimensionality (Hyman 1965). Thomas Aquinas\nrejected the idea that prior to the intellective soul there exists a\nsubstantial form in matter (Summa theol. Ia q. 76 a. 4, a.\n6). The Avicennian concept was adopted by others, such as Henry of\nGhent and Duns Scotus, and thus served the theory of the plurality of\nsubstantial forms. That prime matter has its own actuality became a\nprinciple identifying the Franciscan party in the doctrinal struggles\nwith the Dominicans. The discussion of the concept of forma\ncorporeitatis continued well into the sixteenth century (Des\nChene 2000, 81–93). \nThree prominent topics of natural philosophy are here singled out for\ncloser treatment: the eternity of the world, the persistence of\nelements in a compound and spontaneous generation. \nThe Greek theory of the eternity of the world was a challenge to the\nChristian world view, a challenge increased by the fact that the\ntheory was supported by Arabic sources: by Avicenna, who combined it\nwith a metaphysical concept of God as the “necessary being in\nitself”, which is the eternal efficient cause of the existence\nof the heavenly and sublunar world (see section 6.4 on the first\ncause), and by Averroes, who combined it with a conception of God as\nthe prime mover, whose existence is proved in natural philosophy. In\nGiles of Rome’ Errors of the Philosophers, Avicenna and\nAverroes are accused of many “errors”, but the eternity of\nthe world figures most prominently. Averroes, in particular, is\nattacked for opposing “even more vehemently than did the\nPhilosopher (Aristotle) those who held that the world had had a\nbeginning” (Giles of Rome 1944, 15). The eternity of the world\nand related theses were condemned as heretical in 1270 and 1277 by the\nParisian bishop Étienne Tempier (art. 87, 90, 99, 184)\n(Piché 1999). \nIn the thirteenth century and beyond, the issue was widely discussed\nby the scholastics, who arrived at a variety of positions, but\nunanimously held that the world was created in time by God, which\nmeans that they never fully shared Avicenna’s or Averroes’\nposition. Many arguments of the scholastic discussion were drawn from\nArabic authorities, in particular from Averroes’ long\ncommentaries on De caelo and Physics and from\nAvicenna’s Metaphysics. First traces of Arabic\ninfluence can be found in Philip the Chancellor’s Summa de\nbono (dating 1225–8). Thomas of York, for instance, takes\nover Averroes’ exposition of the four principal views on the\nissue (Comm. magnum De caelo I.102; Dales 1990, 81). Passages\ndrawn from Arabic texts were not only employed to defend, but also to\nattack the eternity thesis. One particularly often quoted argument\ncomes from al-Ghazālī’s Intentions of the\nPhilosophers: If the world was eternal, an infinite number of\n(immortal) souls would now exist, which is impossible (Dales 1990, 44,\n256). Another very influential source of the Latin debate was\nMaimonides’ Guide for the Perplexed\n(II.13–28); Maimonides argued that both eternity and\nnon-eternity are possible philosophically. \nThomas Aquinas’ Commentary on the Sentences (II, d.1\nq.1 a.5) is a good example of the impact of Arabic sources. Among the\narguments cited from Averroes in favour of eternity are that there is\nalways another moment in time before a moment in time; that only\nmotion can be the cause of a change from rest to motion; that if the\nworld had a beginning, a vacuum would precede the world (Comm.\nmagnum De caelo III.29, Comm. magnum Phys.\nVIII.8,9,11,15). Avicenna is cited by Thomas as holding that\nGod’s will is unchangeable and never starts anew (an argument\nadvanced also by Averroes), and that it is impossible that God\nprecedes the world in duration, because this implies that time existed\nbefore the world and before movement (Metaphysics IX.1).\nThese arguments clearly influenced Thomas’ conclusion that the\neternity thesis is the most probable in philosophical terms. However,\njust like creation, eternity escapes full demonstration. From the\nstandpoint of faith, the eternity of the world is false and heretical.\nIn his treatise On the Eternity of the World, Thomas Aquinas,\nin contrast to most of his contemporaries, defends the possibility of\nan eternal creation, thus approaching the position of Avicenna and\nother Neoplatonic thinkers. \nPositions on the eternity of the world by some masters of arts were in\nsome cases very provocative. In the eyes of Siger of Brabant, the\nnatural philosopher cannot but conclude that the world is eternally\ncreated, whereas the metaphysician concedes that God’s will is\ninscrutable and that hence there is no certainty about eternity or\nnon-eternity (De aeternitate mundi; Quaest. in tertium De\nanima q.2). For Boethius of Dacia, the natural philosopher has to\ninfer the eternity of movement from the principles of natural\nphilosophy, but the metaphysician, even though he can demonstrate the\nexistence of a first cause, is unable to demonstrate whether the world\nis coeternal with the first cause or non-eternal, given the\ninscrutability of God’s will (De aeternitate mundi).\nBoth authors share the conviction that the natural philosopher is\nforced to conclude that the world is eternal, thus provoking\ntheological opposition. The arguments for this conclusion were largely\nfurnished by Arabic sources. \nIn the Latin West, Avicenna and Averroes were known as the principal\nadversaries on a much-discussed question of element theory, especially\nin the fourteenth century. Given that all physical substances (apart\nfrom the elements themselves) are mixtures of elements, how do the\nelements exist in them? (Maier 1952; Grant 1974, §77, Eichner\n2005, 139–145). Avicenna’s answer is that the substantial\nforms of the elements remain unaltered when a compound is formed; only\nthe qualities of the elements are altered and unite to a mean quality\n(qualitas media), or complexion (complexio). The\ncomplexion disposes the matter to receive the substantial form of the\ncompound from the active intellect, the giver of forms (dator\nformarum) (The Healing: Physics I.10, On\ngeneration 6). The problem with this position, as many\nscholastics saw, is that several bodies are combined in one, which do\nnot form a true mixture. Averroes rejects Avicenna’s theory and\nargues that the substantial forms of the elements are diminished in\nthe compound (Comm. magnum De caelo III.67). The form of the\ncompound is “composed” of the elementary forms (Comm.\nmagnum Metaph. XII.22). In order not to violate Aristotle’s\nprinciple that substantial forms cannot be diminished or augmented (a\nman is not more man than another), Averroes argued that elementary\nforms are not substantial forms in the full sense. \nA third influential alternative was proposed by Thomas Aquinas. Thomas\nargued that the substantial forms of the elements are destroyed and\nthat only the qualities contribute to the mixture. Thomas shares\nAvicenna’s conviction that every form presupposes a certain\nmaterial disposition, which is the mean quality characteristic of the\ncompound. But he deviates from Avicenna in that the forms of the\nelements are not preserved; they are only virtually present in the\ncompound, in that their powers survive (De mixtione\nelementorum, cf. Summa theol. Ia q. 76 a. 4).\nThomas’ position found many adherents. Its problem is that\nphysical bodies cannot truly be called mixtures of elements. \nAvicenna’s theory of the permanence of substantial forms was\noften mentioned, but rarely accepted in the Latin West.\nAverroes’ position, that the elementary forms can be diminished\nand augmented, found many supporters, among them Henry of Ghent,\nPetrus Johannes Olivi, Richard of Middleton, John of Jandun and\nseveral members of the Merton school of the fourteenth century (Maier\n1952, 36–46). Many authors accept Averroes’ position with\nmodifications, especially by reinterpreting the thesis of the\nintension and remission of elementary forms. Henry Bate and Dietrich\nof Freiberg argue that the diminished forms assume the character of\npotential forms and thus join the matter of the compound; the form of\nthe compound is a form added to these diminished forms. For Averroes,\nin contrast, the combination of the diminished forms was identical\nwith the new form of the compound. In the Renaissance, the issue\ncontinued to be discussed. There was disagreement even among the\nfollowers of Averroes. Some, as Marcantonio Zimara, held that the form\nof the compound was added to the other forms, others, as Jacopo\nZabarella, argued against such addition (Maier 1952, 46–69). \nSpontaneous generation, that is, the generation of life without their\nbeing any parents, as when worms grow in decay, is a much discussed\nissue of medieval physics and metaphysics. The conflicting\nexplanations of the phenomenon by Avicenna and Averroes much\ndetermined the Latin discussion until the sixteenth century. While\nAvicenna holds that spontaneous generation depends upon ever more\nrefined mixtures of elementary qualities which trigger the emanation\nof forms from the active intellect, the giver of forms (The\nHealing: Meteorology II.6: On Floods), Averroes explains\nit with the influence of certain celestial constellations which\nactualize potential forms in water or earth. Avicenna and Averroes\nalso disagree about the special case of the spontaneous generation of\nhuman beings, which Avicenna finds possible, whereas Averroes does\nnot. For Averroes, all spontaneously created animals are not true, but\nabnormal, monstrous animals (Comm. magnum Metaph. II.15,\nVII.31, XII.13,18) (Bertolacci 2013a). \nIn the Latin West, Averroes’ explanation dominated the\ndiscussion for several centuries (Hasse 2007a). Thomas Aquinas argues that there is\nno need to assume the existence of an Avicennian giver of forms to\nexplain spontaneous generation, since the celestial power suffices for\nproducing ordinary animals from matter. More complex beings, however,\nsuch as horses and human beings, cannot be produced by the celestial\npower alone without the formative power of the semen (Quaest. de\npotentia, qu. 3 a. 8,9,11). Thomas’ position was called the\nmedia via by later authors, that is, the middle way between\nAvicenna and Averroes, since Thomas rejected Avicenna’s theory,\nbut also modified Averroes’ position in treating spontaneous\ngeneration as a natural, and not a miraculous phenomenon. \nAverroes’ theory of celestial influence and Thomas\nAquinas’ media via became mainstream in the Latin\nmiddle ages. A few authors, however, followed Avicenna in allowing for\nthe spontaneous generation of human beings, among them Albertus\nMagnus, Blasius of Parma, and, in the Renaissance, Pietro Pomponazzi,\nPaolo Ricci and Tiberio Russiliano. Pomponazzi makes the spontaneous\ngeneration of human beings dependent upon the conjunction of the\nsuperior planets Jupiter and Saturn, and thus introduces another\nArabic theory into the discussion: Albumasar’s astrological\ntheory of the great conjunctions (Nardi 1965). \nA modified version of Avicenna’s theory of the giver of forms\nappears in John Buridan, who deviates from the dominant position that\nthe form of human beings comes from without, i.e. from God, whereas\nthat of animals is educed from matter. In contrast, Buridan holds that\nall forms are given by a separate incorporeal substance,\nwhich he calls God. The phenomenon of spontaneous generation supports\nthis view, since it cannot be explained with the influence of the\nstars, which is too weak and imperfect to generate animals (In\nMetaphysicen Aristotelis lib. 8 q. 9). What does not appear in\nBuridan, is Avicenna’s theory of the subsequent mixtures of\nelementary qualities. \nIn Latin psychology, the influence of Arabic works is particularly\nstrong and lasted well into the sixteenth century. Avicenna and\nAverroes, the most influential philosophers, presented the West with a\nfaculty psychology in the tradition of Aristotle and enriched by\nGraeco-Arabic medical doctrines, such as about the cavities of the\nbrain, the nerves, and the spirits which transport information in the\nbody. From about 1220 onwards, the full range of Avicennian faculties\n(vegetative, external and internal senses, the motive faculties,\npractical and theoretical intellect) appears in Latin treatises by\nmasters of arts and theologians. This system of faculties remains, by\nand large, standard for a long time in philosophical handbooks, from\nthe anonymous Philosophy of the Simple (Philosophia\npauperum) and Vincent of Beauvais’ Mirror of\nNature (Speculum naturale) in the thirteenth century up\nto the Philosophic Pearl (Margarita philosophica) of\nthe 1490s. Also influential was Avicenna’s definition of the\nsoul as a separate substance (Hasse 2008) and his thought experiment of the\n“Flying Man” (Hasse 2000, 80–92). \nAverroes disagreed with Avicenna on a number of topics concerning\nfaculty psychology, for example: on the organ and medium of touch, on\nthe material or immaterial transmission of odors, and on whether human\nbeings have an estimative faculty or not. These controversies were\ncontinued in the Latin tradition. The most influential pieces of\npsychological doctrine imported from the Arabs probably were\nAvicenna’s theory of estimation (wahm), his theory of\npotential, acquired and active intellects, and Averroes’ thesis\nthat there is one intellect for all human beings. \nAvicenna had argued in his On the Soul (the De anima\npart of The Healing I.5 and IV.3) that human beings and\nanimals share an internal sense called estimation (wahm,\naestimatio), which perceives so-called\n“intentions” (maʿānin,\nintentiones) in an object, such as hostility and\nfriendliness: The sheep perceives hostility in the wolf and judges\nthat the wolf is to be fled from. The basic ingredients of this theory\nwere adopted by many scholastic writers. There was disagreement,\nhowever, over several issues: Firstly, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas (in\ncontrast to Avicenna, Albertus Magnus and others) argued that\nestimation existed in animals only, but not in human beings. To\nexplain instinctive reactions in human beings, it is not necessary,\nthey argue, to assume the existence of a faculty besides the\ncogitative faculty, or ratio particularis, as Thomas calls it\n(Summa theologiae Ia 81.3c). Secondly, scholastic writers\nwere divided over whether the intentions are perceived in the object,\nas Avicenna and Thomas Aquinas say (cf. also John Blund, Tractatus\nde anima, ch. 19), or abstracted from sensory forms, as for\ninstance Albertus Magnus and John Buridan argue (Albertus, De\nanima II.4.7; Buridan, Quaestiones de anima II.22)\n(Black 2000; Hasse 2000, 141–153; cf. also Black 2011). Thirdly,\nthere was disagreement about the notion of “animal\njudgement” propagated by Avicenna. Nominalists such as Adam\nWodeham argue that judgements always involve the formation of a\ncomplex sentence, which presupposes linguistic capabilities; animals,\ntherefore, never truly judge (Perler 2006). \nTypical for Arabic intellect theory is the distinction between several\ndegrees or levels of intellect, from an entirely potential intellect\nup to a perpetually active intellect, and the assumption, taken over\nfrom later Greek philosophers, that the active intellect is an entity\nseparate from the human being. Al-Fārābī, Avicenna and\nAverroes identify the active intellect with the lowest of the\ncosmological intelligences, and argue that the human intellect is able\nto conjoin with the active intellect. The great majority of scholastic\nwriters teach that potential and active intellect are parts of the\nsoul, but there also existed a current adopting the Arabic idea of a\nseparate active intellect (e.g. Dominicus Gundisalvi and Petrus\nHispanus). Several scholastic authors identify the active intellect\nwith God on the authority of Avicenna and Augustine – a position\nwhich modern scholars have labeled “Augustinisme\navicennisant” (Gilson 1926/27, 102). Among the earliest\nexponents of the doctrine is Jean de la Rochelle, whose psychological\nworks were written in the 1230s. He teaches that the term\n“active intellect” refers either to God or to the\nangels’ intellect or to the internal light of human beings,\ndepending upon which intellectual objects are grasped by the human\nintellect (Summa de anima 116). This doctrine reappears in\nthe 1240s in the Summa fratris Alexandri, and in Vincent of\nBeauvais. Later adherents are Roger Bacon, John Pecham, Roger Marston,\nVital du Four, and also Henry of Ghent (though only in parts of his\nwork). But other scholastics disagree. Adam of Buckfield, Bonaventure\nand Thomas Aquinas criticize unnamed theologians for identifying the\nactive intellect with God. As philological evidence shows, they refer\nto the above-mentioned current which begins with Jean de la\nRochelle. Thomas rejects the thesis because he interprets it in\nilluminationist terms and finds it incompatible with his own\nepistemology of abstraction (Summa contra gentiles\nII.74). One should note, however, that Avicenna’s epistemology\ncombines both abstractionist and emanationist aspects and that his\ntheory of abstraction also attracted Latin readers (Hasse 2001, but\ncf. McGinnis 2007, and Black 2014). \nAvicenna distinguishes four different states of the human intellect,\nwhich are not different faculties of the soul, but different phases of\nintellection: three potential intellects, called material, in\nhabitu, in effectu, and one actually thinking intellect,\nthe “acquired intellect” (al-ʿaql\nal-mustafād, intellectus adeptus). The first\npotential intellect is pure potentiality to know anything; the second\npotential intellect knows axioms such as “The whole is bigger\nthan the part”; the third has already acquired conclusions\nthrough syllogistic reasoning and the intuition of middle terms, but\ndoes not consider them at the moment; the “acquired\nintellect” comes about when the human intellect connects with\nthe active intellect (De anima I.5). This theory exerted a\nprofound influence on scholastic intellect theory, especially in the\nperiod from Dominicus Gundisalvi to Albertus Magnus. The scholastics\ninherited from Avicenna the principal idea that the activity of the\nhuman intellect can be differentiated into different phases of gradual\ndevelopment and into different acts of syllogistic reasoning (Hasse\n2000, ch. II.6). \nAn important step in the reception of the doctrine is the anonymous\ntreatise De anima et de potentiis eius by a Parisian master\nof arts of ca. 1225 (Gauthier 1982a, 53). This author adopts from\nAvicenna the first three levels of intellect, the first being pure\npotentiality, the second knowing first propositions, the third\nconclusions, and combines it with teachings from Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics (I.3 and II.19) about the intellect\nknowing axioms and principles. Jean de la Rochelle continues this line\nand calls the second intellect intellectus principiorum, the\nthird intellectus conclusionum, and uses a Boethian term for\nthe axioms of the second intellect: “common notion of the\nmind” (communis animi conceptio), thus combining the\nAvicennian doctrine with Latin axiomatic theory (Tractatus de\ndivisione multiplici potentiarum animae II.18). \nIn the writings of Albertus Magnus, the influence of Avicenna is\ncombined with that of Averroes, who distinguishes two intellects apart\nfrom the separate active intellect: the material intellect, which is\npure potentiality (and unique, see section 5.4 below) and the\nspeculative intellect, which is the actuality of the grasped\nintelligible. Averroes and Avicenna both teach that the human and\nactive intellect conjoin in the moment of intellection. Averroes, in\nparticular, claims that a perfect conjunction with the active\nintellect results in God-like knowledge and that such a conjunction is\npossible in this life (Comm. magnum De anima III.5 and\nIII.36). \nAlbertus Magnus, in his early De homine (qu. 56 a. 3), adopts\nthe Avicennian doctrine of three potential intellects in his\nscholastic reformulation, but in his later works, under the influence\nof Averroes, transforms it into a theory of intellectual ascension.\nThe highest level of the human intellect is called “acquired\nintellect” (intellectus adeptus) and results from the\nconjunction between the potential and the active intellect, both parts\nof the human soul. In this stage, the intellect is able to grasp all\nintellectual knowledge, and does not need to have recourse to the\nsenses again. In virtue of this intellect, a human being becomes\nGod-like (De anima 3.3.11) (de\nLibera 2005, 325–327). Thomas Aquinas sharply disagrees. The\nintellect can never dispense with the senses, since it needs the\nphantasms for conceiving an intellectual form. This is why perfect\nintellectual knowledge is not possible in this life (Summa\ntheol. Ia q. 84 a. 7). \nAverroes’ best known philosophical doctrine holds that there is\nonly one intellect for all human beings. The doctrine is sometimes\nlabelled “monopsychism”, but this is a problematic term,\nsince Averroes’ unicity thesis concerns the intellect, not the\nsoul. Averroes’ theory has an epistemological and an ontological\npurpose. On the one hand, Averroes wants to explain how universal\nintelligibles can be known, on the other hand, he wants to account for\nAristotle’s claim that the intellect is pure potentiality and\nunmixed with the body (Comm. magnum De anima III.5). Many\nscholastic readers were troubled by the problem of whether the\nmaterial (or potential) intellect, if it is one, can be the form of\nthe body. This problem was not directly addressed by Averroes himself,\nbut by many of his Latin partisans. \nModern scholarship is still divided about the significance of the\ncurrent of Averroism in the thirteenth century (for the more recent\ndiscussion see Imbach 1991; Hayoun/de Libera 1991; Bianchi 1993;\nNiewöhner/Sturlese 1994; Kuksewicz 1997; Brenet 2003,\n21–22; Coccia 2005, 20–53; Hasse 2007b; Martin 2007; Calma\n2010, 11–20, 367–373; Martin 2013; Akasoy & Giglioni 2013).\nIt was argued, for instance, that the “radical\nAristotelians” of the thirteenth century were not\n“Averroists” in a strict sense (Van Steenberghen 1974,\n531–534). But that much is clear: there existed at least four\ngroups of authors who explicitly adopted the unicity thesis in one of\ntheir writings: Siger of Brabant and possibly other masters of arts in\nlater thirteenth-century Paris; a second Parisian group in the early\nfourteenth century around Thomas Wilton, John of Jandun and John\nBaconthorpe; several Italian masters of arts at Bologna university in\nthe fourteenth century; and a larger group of authors in Renaissance\nItaly and especially in Padua. \nWhen the medievals used the Latin term averroista, they\nreferred to authors belonging to these groups. The term\naverroista came into use in the later thirteenth century, but\non rare occasions. The first appearance, as we can see today, is in\nThomas Aquinas’ treatise On the Unicity of the\nIntellect (De unitate intellectus). The additional title\nphrase contra averroistas appears only in the later\nmanuscript tradition and is unlikely to be authentic. It was in the\ndecades around 1500 that the term was used most frequently.\nAverroistae were associated mainly with the unicity thesis,\nbut also with theories about the eternity of the world, God’s\nknowledge of the world, prime matter and happiness (Kuksewicz 1997,\n93–96; Calma 2010). In the\nRenaissance, averroista was also used, with a positive\nconnotation, to refer to experts on Averroes (Martin 2007; Martin\n2013). A sensible historiographical usage of the term\n“Averroism” should be tied to the medieval and Renaissance\nusages. In particular, two senses of the term “Averroism”\nseem historically legitimate: as meaning a current of followers of\nAverroes who hold theologically controversional doctrines, or as\nmeaning a current of experts on Averroes. The first sense has a longer\ntradition in the Middle Ages and in modern scholarship and is\ntherefore to be preferred generally. Some modern historians use the\nterm “Averroism” in a much broader sense for all\ninfluences of Averroes’ thought (e.g. Gauthier 1982,\n334–335; Calma 2010, 368–369); so-called\n“Averroisms” would then be found, for instance, in almost\nall Latin Aristotle commentaries of the later Middle Ages. This usage,\nhowever, ignores the historical roots of the meaning of the term. \nSiger of Brabant (d. 1284) and John of Jandun (d. 1328) were the best\nknown and most influential Averroists. Siger, in his first and most\nexplicitly Averroistic work on the soul, argues that the separate and\neternal intellect is united to the body only in an operational union\nand that the true form of the body is the sensitive soul (Quaest.\nin tertium de anima, esp. q. 3 and 9). Under the influence of\nThomas Aquinas and others, Siger later revised his position. For John\nof Jandun, the intellective soul, which in itself is one and separate,\noperates within the body. It is united to the body only through the\nassistance of the phantasmata (Brenet 2003). The Renaissance\nAverroists Agostino Nifo and Luca Prassicio argued that Siger and John\nof Jandun professed conflicting views: they interpreted Siger as\nholding that the unique intellect can be united to the body as form\nand John of Jandun that it cannot. Another influential Averroist was\nJohn Baconthorpe (d. 1345/48): He developed the theory of the\nso-called “double conjunction” (copulatio\nbifaria) between intellect and bodily phantasms: one\nepistemological, one ontological. The ontological conjunction\npresupposes a union of unique intellect and human being in a way that\nthe intellect becomes a human faculty (Etzwiler 1971, 266–269).\nAmong the most explicit and outspoken Averroists of the Renaissance\nwere Nicoletto Vernia (d. 1499) and Luca Prassicio (d. 1533). The\nunicity thesis was successful among Latin authors not only because\nAverroes as the commentator had become an exceptional\nauthority of university education, but also because it was attractive\nphilosophically: it explained the possibility of the knowledge of\nuniversals and it ensured that the intellective soul, as demanded by\nAristotle (De anima III.4, 429a22–25), was not mixed\nwith the body. \nThe unicity thesis was included among the doctrines condemned in 1270\nand 1277 in Paris (art. 32) and in 1489 in Padua by the local bishops.\nFrom a theological vantage point, its main drawback was its conflict\nwith the doctrine of individual immortality. The principal\nphilosophical counter-argument, first presented by Averroes himself\n(Comm. magnum De anima, 393) and powerfully formulated by\nThomas Aquinas, was that the unicity thesis could not account for the\nfact that “this individual man thinks”, as Thomas puts it\n(“hic homo singularis intelligit”, De unitate\nintellectus III) (Black 2004). The standard reply by Averroes and\nhis followers was that the intelligible form is joined to the\nindividual human being through the actualized imaginative form, which\nis particular. This way, individual knowledge of universal forms is\npossible. \nThe decades around 1500 saw the high tide of the Averroist current, as\nfar as we can discern today (Schmitt 1979; Akasoy & Giglioni\n2013). This is indicated by several pieces of evidence: the frequent\nusage of the term averroista; the significant number of\nauthors who adopt the unicity thesis in one of their works; the\ncomposition of super-commentaries on Averroes’ commentaries;\nand, finally, the fact that the correct interpretation of\nAverroes’ philosophical position became a matter of dispute\namong his partisans (e.g. between Nifo, Trombetta, Zimara, Pomponazzi\nand Prassicio). The unicity thesis lost its appeal as late as in the\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, with the advent of new trends of\nAristotelianism that gave alternative explanations of universal\nintellection (e.g. by Melanchthon, Zabarella and Suarez) (Hasse 2016,\nch. 5). \nThe philosophical interpretation of prophecy and miracles is a typical\nfeature of Arabic philosophy. The Latin West was not acquainted with\nal-Fārābī’s concept of the philosopher-prophet,\nthe leader of the excellent city, but with parts of\nal-Kindī’s and Avicenna’s theories. The general line\nof Avicenna’s naturalistic theory of prophecy, which describes\nprophecy as resulting from extraordinary faculties of the soul, was\ncriticized by Thomas Aquinas. Thomas admits that there is also\n“natural prophecy” which results from the contact of human\nimagination and intellect with the celestial bodies and angels, but\n“divine prophecy” is entirely dependent upon God, and not\nupon the preparedness of the human soul (Quaest. de veritate,\nq. 12, a. 1 and 3). \nAmong the specifics of prophecy theory, the working of miracles\nreceived most attention in the Latin West. al-Kindī’s and\nAvicenna’s explanation of miracles is naturalistic in the sense\nthat neither theory involves divine factors. al-Kindī argues in\nOn Rays (De radiis, extant only in Latin) that if a\nperson conceives a corporeal image in his imagination, the image\nassumes a material existence in the spiritus that belongs to\nthe faculty. The spiritus in turn sends out rays, which alter\nobjects in the external world (d’Alverny & Hudry 1975,\n230–1). An alternative to this extramission theory is formulated\nby Avicenna, who claims that persons who have perfected their body and\nsoul are able to affect directly the external matter of the world and\nmay produce rain, fertile seasons, and the like – by sheer power\nof the will. Avicenna arrives at this conclusion by generalizing the\nprinciple that there are psychic causes for material effects (De\nanima IV.4). \nAlbertus Magnus rejects Avicenna’s long-distance theory because\nit breaks with the Aristotelian rule that there is no efficient\ncausation without material contact (De sensu et sensato\n1.10). Thomas Aquinas follows a third alternative: that psychic powers\ncan move the intervening medium, and so indirectly act on external\nobjects, which explains the damage caused by an evil eye. Thomas\nborrows from a passage in Aristotle’s On Dreams, in\nwhich air is moved and affected by the eyes of menstruating women\n(459b23–60a24). True miracles, however, are always produced by\nGod (Summa theol. Ia q.117 a. 3). In the later Middle Ages,\nthe Aristotelian theory of the movable medium proved more successful\nthan the extramission and action-at-a-distance theories of\nal-Kindī and Avicenna. An exception is Roger Bacon, who teaches\nthat some persons are able to send out “powers, forms, and\nheat” in order to alter bodies outside. Bacon employs\nal-Kindī’s theory of extramission in order to explain magic\nas a purely natural phenomenon (in De secretis operibus artis et\nnaturae). \nThe high time for Arabic theories of miracles came in the Renaissance\n(Hasse 2007c, 121–125). Marsilio Ficino in his Platonic\nTheology (Theologia platonica XIII.4.8–9) explains\nlong-distance effects such as the evil eye with an extramission model\nreminiscent of al-Kindī: The evil eye is explained with vapors\nbeing emitted from the sorcerer’s eyes which reach and afflict\nthe victim. True miracles, however, cannot be achieved without\nGod’s assistence. Andrea Cattani (d. 1506) explicitly adopts\nAvicenna’s theory that noble souls are able to influence the\nexternal world without mediation, but ties this extraordinary capacity\nto inspiration by the Holy Ghost. Such reservations do not appear in\nadoption of the theory by Pietro Bairo (d. 1558). Pietro Pomponazzi\n(d. 1525) discusses Avicenna’s position, but favours an\nextramission theory: He explains a contemporary miracle in the town of\nAquila with the transmission of vapors which are issued from the eyes\nof the observers (in De naturalium effectuum causis sive de\nincantationibus, 237–8). \nThe two most important Arabic sources of medieval Latin metaphysics\nare the metaphysics part (Ilāhiyyāt) of\nAvicenna’s philosophical summa The Healing\n(al-Shifāʾ), here referred to as his\nMetaphysics (Hasse & Bertolacci 2012) and Averroes’\nLong Commentary on the Metaphysics (Bertolacci 2009).\nAvicenna’s treatise presented metaphysics as a fully systematic\ndiscipline and combined Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions.\nAverroes’ commentary proved an indispensible tool for\nunderstanding Aristotle’s text and offered an alternative to\nAvicenna’s position on several important issues.\nAl-Ghazālī’s Intentions of the Philosophers\nalso contributed much to the dissemination of Avicennian metaphysics\nin the Latin West (Minnema 2014; Minnema 2017). Another very\ninfluential text was the Discourse on the Pure Good (Kalām\nfī maḥḍ al-khayr, Liber de pura\nbonitate), known in Latin also as The Book of Causes (Liber\nde causis). The anonymous Arabic author of the treatise\nrearranged passages from Proclus’ Elements of Theology\nfrom a monotheistic, creationist and Plotinian perspective, and\ncombined them with doctrines from Plotinian and Aristotelian sources.\nIn 1255, the Latin text became part of the required curriculum of\nstudy in the Faculty of Arts in Paris, together with the works of\nAristotle, with the effect that the text received many commentaries\nand enjoyed an extraordinary transmission in more than 237 manuscripts\n(Taylor 1983). The Liber de causis was long considered to be\nan authentic text by Aristotle. When William of Moerbeke in 1268\ntranslated Proclus’ Elements of Theology into Latin,\nThomas Aquinas was able to identify Proclus as the main source of the\ntext. The Liber de causis remained popular, however. At least\n74 commentaries from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries testify to its\ngreat influence (d’Ancona Costa 1995, 195–258;\nFidora/Niederberger 2001, 205–247; Calma 2016, I,\n20–21). \nIt was well known among the scholastics that Avicenna and Averroes\ndisagreed about the subject matter of metaphysics. In the two opening\nchapters of his Metaphysics, Avicenna argues that no science\ncan demonstrate the existence of its proper subject, and that hence\nGod, whose existence is proven in metaphysics, cannot be its proper\nsubject. The subject (mawḍūʿ, subiectum) of\nmetaphysics is being as being. What is sought after\n(maṭlūb, quaesitum) in metaphysics, is\nthat which unconditionally accompanies being: such as the causes of\nbeing, among which God is the first. Averroes countered that the\nexistence of the first principle cannot be demonstrated in\nmetaphysics, since such a proof can only begin with God’s\neffects and with movement in particular. This is why the proof of God\nbelongs to physics. The subject matter of metaphysics is separable\nbeings, among which counts God, as Averroes argues in the Long\nCommentary on the Physics (ch. I.83, but in other works he\nassigns this function to being as being; see Bertolacci 2007). \nMost scholastic authors favoured Avicenna’s position over\nAverroes’s, but within this mainstream position there was\ndisagreement about the manner in which God relates to the subject of\nmetaphysics, being as being. Albertus Magnus defends Avicenna against\nAverroes’ criticism. Being as being is the subject of\nmetaphysics, whereas the divisions and accidents (passiones)\nof being are what is sought after, among them God and the separate\ndivine beings (Metaph. I.2, Phys. I.3.18). Thomas\nAquinas’ position is again much influenced by Avicenna: The\nsubject of metaphysics is being as being (or ens commune),\nwhereas God is that which is aimed at in this science, insofar as he\nis the cause of all being (In Metaph., prooem.). But, other\nthan Avicenna, Thomas argues that God is the proper subject of a\ndifferent science, the principles of which are given in revelation:\ntheology (Summa theol. Ia q.1). \nThere were three principal positions on the issue in the Latin West\n(Zimmermann 1998): Albertus and Thomas make God a subject of\nmetaphysics only as cause of the subject; a second group, among them\nRoger Bacon and Giles of Rome, holds that God is one of several\nsubjects of metaphysics; a third group argues that God is part of the\nsubject of metaphysics. The latter position was influentially\nformulated by Henry of Ghent (Pickavé 2007), and taken up by\nmany other authors, among them Duns Scotus. Scotus develops his own\nstandpoint against the authorities of Avicenna, Averroes and Henry of\nGhent. He agrees with Avicenna that being as being is the subject and\nthat the notion of being includes all being, be it material or\nimmaterial. For Scotus, this notion of being explicitly includes God\nwithin the subject of metaphysics (Zimmermann 1998,\n294–329). \nIn chapter I.5 of his Metaphysics, Avicenna argues that just\nas there are first and self-evident sentences, there are also\nfundamental, first known, self-evident concepts, which are common to\nall beings: “the existent”, “the thing”,\n“the necessary”. It was due to Avicenna that the\nprimum cognitum, the first object of knowledge became a\ncentral topic of medieval Latin metaphysics. The question of the\nprimum cognitum was variously answered. For Guibert of\nTournai, Bonaventure and Henry of Ghent, God is the primum\ncognitum (Goris 1999), for Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus being\n(ens), for Berthold of Moosburg the good (bonum). An\nexample of a primum cognitum theory influenced by Avicenna is\nThomas Aquinas’. There cannot be an infinite regress, neither in\nthe order of demonstration, nor in the order of definition, Thomas\nargues. This is why there is a first concept: “being”. It\nis what is first grasped by the mind, and it is unrestrictedly\nuniversal. It is specific for Thomas, however, that the order of\ndefinition and of demonstration are not on the same level. The\nprinciple of contradiction rests (fundatur) on a conceptual\nbasis, since it can be reduced to the terms out of which it is\ncomposed, among which “being” is the first (In\nMetaph. IV.6; Aertsen 1996, 146–151). \nAvicenna’s theory of primary concepts was an important source\nfor the theory of transcendental concepts, which scholastic\nphilosophers developed in the thirteenth century, taking their cue\nfrom Aristotle, Avicenna and the Dionysian tradition (Aertsen 2008;\nAertsen 2012; Pini 2012). Avicenna bequeathed to the discussion of the\ntranscendentals not only specific teachings about the notions\n“being”, “one” and “thing”, but\nalso the general idea that, ontologically, the primary concepts are\nmost common since they are true of everything, and that,\nepistemologically, they are first known since they are self-evident\nand not reducable to prior concepts. \nAmong the most influential philosophical doctrines of Arabic origin is\nthe distinction between essence (māhiyya,\nessentia) and existence (wujūd, ens),\nwhich the Latin West got to know from Avicenna’s\nMetaphysics, chapters I.5 and V.1–2. The distinction\nwas very influential historically: it found adherents among\nphilosophers and theologians of the Arabic, Hebrew and Latin\ncultures. The essence-existence distinction was used by Avicenna in\nseveral metaphysical contexts, i.e., in the discussion of primary\nconcepts, of universals and of the first cause. The following\npresentation focuses on the context of universals. Avicenna’s\ncore idea was to differentiate between two components of universals:\nessence and universality. The essence of “horseness”, to\nuse Avicenna’s example (Metaphysics V.1), is in itself\nneither universal nor particular. Only existence, which in itself is\ndistinct from essence, adds universality or particularity, depending\nupon whether “horseness” exists in the mind, that is, as a\nuniversal, or in the exernal world, that is, as a particular. In some\nof his writings, Avicenna emphasizes that there is universality only\nif the essence is found in several objects in the external world\n(Marmura 1979, 49). \nThomas Aquinas adopts Avicenna’s distinction already in his\nearly On Being and Essence (De ente et essentia IV).\nEssence can be considered either in itself or with respect to its\nexistence in the soul or in the particular things. Universality and\nparticularity are accidents of essence, which in itself is neither\nuniversal nor particular. Thomas Aquins adopts the expression\n“accidents of essence” from Averroes (Comm. magnum\nMetaph. IV.3). The universal, according to Thomas, is a\nnatura communis, which has existence only in the intellect.\nIndividuals are essences individuated by matter with quantitative\ndimensions, but only at the time of their origin; later individuation\nis due to the form. In later writings, Thomas develops his concept of\nessence and existence so that existence is that which actualizes\nessence (Summa theol. Ia q. 3 a. 4) (Wippel 1990; Black\n1999). \nAn influential defender of the real distinction between essence and\nexistence was Giles of Rome. Since he uses the terminology of\n“thing” (res) for both concepts, he was\ncriticized for turning “existence” into a thing, which\nitself exists only if another thing “existence” is added,\nand so on ad infinitum. This argument was voiced against the real\ndistinction by Siger of Brabant and Godfrey of Fontaines (Wippel\n1982), but it originally comes from Averroes, who flatly rejects\nAvicenna’s distinction in his Long Commentary on the\nMetaphysics (IV.3). \nWhile some authors take the extreme position that there is only a\nmental distinction between essence and existence, Henry of Ghent\ndevelops a modified version of Avicenna’s theory. He\ndistinguishes between essence in itself and as existing, that is,\nexisting in the mind or in the external world. But he attributes a\nspecific kind of existence to the essence in itself\n(Quodlibet I, 9 and III, 9): esse essentiae\n(“essential being”), which is the essence’s eternal\nrelation to God as its cause. The esse existentiae, in\ncontrast, is the essence’s actual existence. Henry thus develops\na theory of how essences exist prior to their actual existence in the\nmind or in the world, enlarging on a brief and tentative reference in\nAvicenna’s Metaphysics I.5 to the “proper\nexistence” (esse proprium) of the essences. \nDuns Scotus is also inspired by the Avicennian idea that the common\nnature (natura communis), as Scotus calls it, is neither\ntruly universal nor truly particular in itself and that it is\nuniversal only as an object of the intellect. But Scotus’\naccount of individuation differs: The common nature is particular only\nbecause of a second “reality” in the object, a principle\nof individuation or contracting difference, which by later authors was\ncalled haecceitas (“thisness”). The distinction\nbetween the two “realities” nature and thisness is not\nreal, but formal in the sense that the two are different, but never\nexist apart from each other (Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q.\n6). \nThe influence of Arabic metaphysics is much more extensive than these\nbrief references to a few well-known thinkers suggest. The influence\nof Avicenna and Averroes, especially on the subject of metaphysics and\non essence and existence, extends to many authors and over many\ncenturies, up to sixteenth-century Jesuit authors such as Benedictus\nPereira, Pedro da Fonseca and Francisco Suárez (Leinsle 1985,\nch. 2) \nThe influence of Avicenna’s concept of the first cause as the\nonly necessary being in itself (wājib al-wujūd\nbi-ḏātihī, necesse esse per se) and of\nhis theory of emanation is apparent already in the twelfth century.\nDominicus Gundisalvi, the Avicenna translator, distinguishes in his\nProcession of the World (De processione mundi)\nbetween the first cause, which is the “necessary being”\n(necesse esse), and the created beings, which in themselves\nare only possible beings. The entire universe proceeds from the first\ncause. The principles first created, however, are not the\nintelligences, as in Avicenna’s metaphysics, but the material\nand formal principles of the things (Jolivet 1988, 138–140;\nPolloni 2017, 532–538). \nThe anonymous author of The Book of First and Second Causes (Liber\nde causis primis et secundis), which dates from the turn of the\nthirteenth century, does not adopt the distinction between necessary\nand possible beings, but describes the process of emanation in\nstrongly Avicennian terms: From the first cause issues a first created\nbeing, an intellect. From this intellect, in turn, emanates a series\nof intelligences, the lowest of which is the active intellect.\nEmanation happens in triads: From an intelligence emanates, in virtue\nof its intellectual activity, the form of a celestial sphere, the body\nof a sphere, and another intelligence (ch. 4). The anonymous author\nalso draws on the Book of Causes (see the beginning of\nsection 6 above), for instance when describing the hierarchy of\nintelligences as a decrease in power and unity (ch. 6). \nWilliam of Auvergne (d. 1249) is much attracted by Arabic metaphysical\nand pyschological theories (which he often indiscriminately attributes\nto “Aristotle and his followers”) and discusses them at\nlength, but often rejects them in the end as conflicting with\nChristian faith. In On the Universe (De universo\nII.1), William discusses and rejects the Avicennian emanation system:\nthe necessity of causation through the first cause; the emanation of\nthe intelligences from the first intelligence down to the active\nintellect; the active intellect as the efficient cause of human souls.\nHe nevertheless tacitly adopts the metaphysical principle “From\none arises only one” (de uno non nisi unum) from\nAvicenna (Teske 1993), in particular within the context of Trinitarian\ntheology (Fischer 2015), and describes the first cause as the\n“being necessary through itself” (Teske 2002, Fischer\n2018). \nThomas Aquinas adopts from Avicenna the description of God as the\nnecessary being, whose essence is its own existence (Summa contra\ngentiles I.22). Avicenna’s influence is also apparent in a\nwell-known passage: the “five ways” (quinque\nviae) of proving God’s existence in the Summa\ntheologiae (Ia q. 2 a. 3). The third proof advances via\n“the possible and the necessary”: It establishes the\nexistence of something necessary in virtue of itself. The proof is\nmuch coloured by Avicennian metaphysics, but its direct source is\nMaimonides’ Guide for the Perplexed (II.1), from which\nit deviates only in minor respects. A conspicuous element of\nMaimonides’ and Thomas’ proof is the premise, not\nexplicitly formulated by Avicenna, that, in an eternal world, every\npossibility is eventually realized, which is a version of the\nso-called “principle of plenitude” (Davidson 1987,\n378–388). Thomas, however, rejects the Avicennian theory of\nemanation. The creation of the world is not a necessary process, and\nit does not occur through intermediaries, that is, intelligences or\nangels. He also rejects Avicenna’s theory of a separate active\nintellect as the giver of the forms of the sublunar world and as the\nontological place of the intelligibles, a theory against which Thomas\nadvances epistemological arguments in the first place (Summa\ncontra gentiles II.42 and II.76). Albertus Magnus, in contrast,\ntacitly adopts much of the dator formarum theory in several\nof his writings, even though he often voices his criticism of it\n(Hasse 2012). \nThe attraction of Avicenna’s position is evident in the work of\nSiger of Brabant. In some of his writings, Siger teaches that God as\nthe first being creates only one being immediately, the first\nimmaterial substance, from which emanate the other intelligences, the\ncelestial spheres and finally the sublunar world, in an eternal and\nnecessary process. The necessity is not universal, however, but finds\nits limits in the contingency and in the free will which exists in the\nsublunar world (De necessitate et contingentia causarum; Van\nSteenberghen 1991, 346). Duns Scotus, in contrast, is very critical of\nAvicenna’s theory of necessary causation through the first\ncause. He advances several reasons against it, the most important\nbeing that there can only be contingency in the world if the first\ncause does not act by necessity (Ordinatio I d. 8 p. 2 q.\nun). \nSeveral theses on the first cause and the intelligences which are\ninspired by Avicenna are condemned by the Parisian bishop in 1277,\namong them: that God is the first necessary cause of the first\nintelligence and of the celestial movements (art. 58 and 59), that God\ndoes necessarily what is immediately produced by him (art. 53), that\nthe active intellect is a substance separate from the human intellect\n(art. 123), that the rational souls are created by the intelligences\n(art. 30). Avicenna’s theory of the first cause nevertheless\ncontinued to influence the scholastic discussion. This is true, for\ninstance, of the proof for the existence of God, which had been cited\nby Thomas Aquinas. Peter of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent and Duns Scotus\ntoo draw on Avicenna’s argument from the possible and necessary\nbeing (Druart 2002; Janssens 2003; Pickavé 2007, ch. 6). \nThe 1270 and 1277 condemnations were also directed against another\ntheory based on Arabic sources: astrological determinism (art. 143,\n161, 167, 195, 206, 207). The condemnations do not testify to the\ninfluence of Arabic philosophers proper: Avicenna was critical of\nastrology for epistemological reasons and Averroes embedded\nastrological doctrines in Peripatetic mainstream theories about the\ninfluence of the stars. Rather, the condemnations indicate that Arabic\nastrologers such as Albumasar and Alcabitius were very influential in\nthe Latin West already in the thireenth century. \nThe influence of Arabic ethical and political writings is thin, partly\nbecause Arabic philosophers were less productive in these fields, and\npartly because important works were not translated at all (such as\nal-Fārābī’s Principles of the Citizens of the\nPerfect State) or as late as in the sixteenth century (such as\nAverroes’ Commentary on Plato’s Republic).\nNevertheless, Arabic philosophers, via their teaching on the\nintellect, exerted an important influence on the border area between\nethics and psychology, and on the discussion of human happiness in\nparticular. \nAl-Fārābī, Avicenna and Averroes share the view that\nhappiness is reached through the conjunction of the human intellect\nwith the separate active intellect. They also share an epistemological\noptimism that for specifically gifted people, which they described as\nphilosophers or philosopher-prophets, a perfect conjunction is\npossible in this life. Albertus Magnus’s theory of happiness is\nmuch influenced by these Arabic theories. As was mentioned above, he\nadopted from Avicenna and Averroes the concept of an “acquired\nintellect” (intellectus adeptus) as the highest level\nof conjunction between possible and active intellect. Only in this\nstage, a human being truly becomes a human being. Through the\nconjunction with the active intellect the human intellect contemplates\nthe separate substances, and in this consists the “theoretical\nhappiness” of man (felicitas contemplativa), a\nhappiness which is possible in this life (De anima III.3.12)\n(Müller 2006; on Albertus’ influence see de Libera 2005,\n329–361). Thomas Aquinas disagrees with the epistemological\npremisses and the ethical conclusion of this position: Since human\nknowledge is bound to the senses, knowledge of the immaterial\nsubstances is not possible in this life, and neither is perfect human\nhappiness (Summa theol. Ia IIae q.3 a.2). But Thomas, when\nexplaining beatific vision and human happiness in the afterlife,\nadopts from Averroes the idea that a separate substance is conjoined\nwith the human intellect as its form (Comm. on the Sentences\nIV, d.49 q.2 a.1; see Taylor 2012) \nIn 1277, several philosophical theses concerning human happiness and\nthe good life were condemned: that happiness is to be had in this life\nand not in another (art. 176), that there is no better state (of life)\nthan studying philosophy (art. 40). These articles were apparently\ndirected at masters of arts at the university of Paris, among them\nSiger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia. As we know from fragments of\nSiger’s treatise On Happiness (De felicitate),\nhe embraces Averroes’ thesis that all intellects are made\nblessed through the conjunction with the active intellect. In\nSiger’s interpretation, human beings in such a state think God\nby an intellection which is God himself. There are many indications\nthat Siger was convinced that the knowledge of the separate substances\nand thus the attaining of human happiness is possible in this life\n(Steel 2001, 227–231). Boethius of Dacia is also convinced that\nhuman happiness can be reached in this life, which is a happiness\nproportioned to human capacities, whereas the highest kind of\nhappiness as such is reserved to the afterlife (in his treatise De\nsummo bono). Boethius appears to be inspired by Arabic theories\nof intellectual ascension, but does not endorse a theory of\nconjunction, as does Siger. His conviction that the\nphilosopher’s life is the only true life echoes the very\nself-confident and elitist stance taken by the major Arabic\nphilosophers.","contact.mail":"dag-nikolaus.hasse@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de","contact.domain":"mail.uni-wuerzburg.de"}]
