Once termed “the conscience of\n Israel”[1]\n by his childhood contemporary from Riga, Sir Isaiah Berlin,\nLeibowitz’s thought is founded on a far-reaching theocentrism\nthat allows him to combine a commitment to Orthodox Jewish practice\nwith a stripped-down definition of Jewish faith that yields a\nradically naturalistic theology – if, indeed, what is left can\nbear the burden of the term “theology” at all. But the\ninfluence of this theocentric commitment spreads far beyond the\nconfines of his views on religious faith. It is the ultimate source of\nhis unyielding criticism of the rabbinic establishment in Israel, and\nwhat – “in the face of so much pressure to be sensible, to\nbe realistic, not to let the side down” as Berlin (1983, 18) put\nit – was seen at the time as a highly controversial stance\nregarding Israeli policy towards the territories occupied since the\nSix Day war.\n\nBorn to an observant Jewish family in Riga in 1903, Leibowitz gained\nhis education at the Gymnasium, with concurrent\nhome-schooling for his Jewish studies, before the family fled Russia\nin 1919 for Berlin. At the University of Berlin, Leibowitz studied\nchemistry and philosophy, receiving his doctorate in the former in\n1924. After studying at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute from\n1926–1928, Leibowitz went onto study medicine in Koln and\nHeidelberg, though with the Nazis gaining power he would gain his\nformal medical degree in Basel. In 1935 he moved to Palestine,\ninitially as professor of biochemistry at the Hebrew University, going\non to be appointed as head of biological and organic chemistry and\nprofessor of neurophysiology at the Medical School, as well as\nlecturing on the history and philosophy of science. Yet these formal\nacademic appointments formed but one side of his work, and far from\nthe most public, for in addition Leibowitz taught Jewish thought,\nwhether in an academic context, in small study groups, or on\ntelevision and radio, with a number of these broadcasts and\nstudy-group notes having since been published. But aside from these\nactivities and his being editor in chief of several volumes of the\nEncyclopedia Hebraica, it was for his political interventions\nthat Leibowitz would gain most notoriety on the Israeli public scene,\nwhether in his criticism of the religious parties as the “kept\nmistress” (Judaism, 115) of the Israeli government, his\nargument as early as 1968 that Israel should withdraw from the\nnewly-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip, or his public call for\nconscientious objectors from the time of the Lebanon war of 1982 and\nsubsequently in the Palestinian territories. Leibowitz’s ability\nto stir up public controversy was in evidence as late as 1993, the\nyear before he died, in a speech to the Israel Council for\nIsraeli-Palestinian Peace, where he reiterated his call on soldiers to\nrefuse to serve in the Territories, using, not for the first time,\nhighly provocative language comparing special units of the Israeli\narmy to the SS. The speech followed the announcement that he was to\nreceive the Israel prize – the country’s most prestigious\ncivilian award – in recognition of his life’s work, a move\nthat precipitated an appeal to the Supreme Court, and a threat to\nboycott the ceremony by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Leibowitz,\nhowever, saved everyone further embarrassment by declining the\naward. \nLeibowitz’s philosophy found expression in numerous essays that\nfirst appeared in Hebrew periodicals and were subsequently collated,\nwith some overlap, into a handful of volumes published at irregular\nintervals, most significantly Torah u-Mitzvot ba-Zeman ha-Zeh\n[Torah and Commandments in Our Time] (1954); Yahadut, Am Yehudi\nu-Medinat Yisrael [Judaism, Jewish People, and the State of\nIsrael] (1975); and Emunah, Historiah, va-Arakhim [Faith,\nHistory, and Values] (1982). 1982 also saw the publication of the\ntranscripts of his study-group on Maimonides’ Shemoneh\nPerakim – the section of Maimonides’ Commentary to\nthe Mishnah that serves as an introduction to Tractate\nAvot (generally known in English as the Ethics of the\nFathers). A number of his contributions to Israeli television and\nradio also appeared in print – including series on the philosophy\nof Maimonides and on the weekly Torah reading – and continue to do\nso posthumously, along with transcripts of further study-group\ndiscussions. Though far better known in Israel than in the\nEnglish-speaking world, the publication in English translation of a\ncollection of his writings in 1992 – Judaism, Human Values,\nand the Jewish State – opened the way to a growing critical\nengagement with his thought beyond those oft disputed borders. While\nas recently as 2015 it was possible for one scholar to state that his\n“original and unique concept of Jewish religiosity has hardly\nbeen adopted by other Jewish thinkers and practitioners, in Israel and\nabroad” (Benbassat 2015, 141), one now finds a broadening of\nLeibowitz scholarship beyond exclusively Jewish concerns and the\nKantian comparisons that were the staple of early critical work, to a\nclutch of recent attempts to place his work in proximity to that of\nEmmanuel Levinas, whose work Leibowitz held in high\n regard,[2]\n and Søren Kierkegaard. His radio broadcasts on Maimonides and on the\nweekly Torah reading of 1985–1986 are now also available in\nEnglish. \nIn the 1953 piece “Mitzvot Ma’asiyot” (a\nlater version of which was translated as “Religious\nPraxis,” in Judaism), at once the most succinct\nstatement of his philosophy and his most expansive essay that\nforeshadows much of what he would go on to write throughout his\ncareer, Leibowitz tells us that he is not concerned to\n“elaborate a philosophic justification or rationale for the\nMitzvoth [commandments],” but instead to expand on “their\nmeaning for Jewish religion as we live it” (Judaism,\n4). Indeed, while some of Leibowitz’s ideas are certainly drawn\nfrom (and relevant to) the philosophy of religion more generally, his\nwritings are very specifically directed to giving a philosophical\nexposition of Judaism, and in particular of the mitzvoth that are at\nits heart. “Exposition” may, however, appear to be a\nmisleading term to use given that the earliest published Hebrew\nversion of this piece opens with some introductory methodological\nremarks “designed to guide the argument,” in which he\nstates that argument “and not exposition – should\nbe the main point of our discussion,” (Torah u-Mitzvot,\n 9).[3]\n Leibowitz’s mixed signals here – talk of expanding on\n“meaning” suggests a more hermeneutical and expository\napproach, and yet he wishes to eschew “exposition” for\nargument – indicate important limits on what Leibowitz sets out to\nachieve. \nGiven his scientific training, Leibowitz “argues” on the\nbasis of empirical (most often historical) evidence for certain\nfactual claims regarding, for example, the centrality of mitzvoth in\nJudaism to the exclusion of mysticism, philosophy, or dogma. Yet, on\nthe very same positivistic grounds, he is not willing to launch\nparallel “arguments” in order to justify specific\npractices or indeed Jewish practice as a whole (though this is a topic\nto which we will have cause to return). Leibowitz helps himself to a\nstark fact/value distinction, insisting that “Values are not\nanchored in reality” (Judaism, 139); that there is\n“no relation of connection or mutual dependence between\nscientific cognition and evaluative decision” (Mada,\n7). Thus, if one is expecting to find an argument justifying the\nhalakhic way of life through syllogistic reasoning from foundational\nprinciples, or justifications of the commandments in the manner of the\ngreat medieval Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, one is likely to\nbe disappointed. What we do find, in line with much contemporary\nJewish philosophy, is an insider’s account of the meaning of\nfaith in Judaism as understood from within that tradition, albeit with\nimplications beyond those boundaries. And for Leibowitz, such\n“meaning” is aligned with the purposes and values we\nespouse, such that at times he uses the expression “value and\nmeaning”, or some variation of it, as if it were a single\nsyntactic unit (see Judaism, 135–138, for example) As\nLeibowitz notes when discussing Aristotelian science, two people\nlooking at the same things and agreed on all of the material facts and\n“efficient causes” can nonetheless attach very different\nmeanings to the phenomena in question when they introduce the\nperspective of their final causes (Mada, 27). So while facts\nare relevant to his factual claims about the nature of Judaism, it is\nto values and purposes that we must turn if we are to fully understand\nmeaning, and the meaning of the faith of Judaism cannot therefore be\njustified by appeal to the world of scientific cognition. At the same\ntime, in contrast to some of the best-known twentieth century Jewish\nphilosophers, Leibowitz is also wary of any appeal to religious\nexperience to further his account of the meaning of Jewish faith.\n“Most characteristic of the Halakhah,” he tells us,\n“is its lack of pathos” (Judaism, 13). The only\nreliable tools that we can use in order to investigate the meaning of\nthis evaluative notion of faith, therefore, remain those of discursive\nreasoning. Thus we generally find Leibowitz using the tools of\nrational philosophical discourse to trace the implications of his\nfoundational positions to their logical conclusions. \nRather than setting out his philosophy comprehensively in the form of\na system based on foundational premises, Leibowitz generally wrote\nshort articles devoted to specific topics. It is nonetheless fair to\nsay that there is a single axis around which his philosophy of Judaism\nrevolves and to which many of his views can ultimately be\ntraced – the radical transcendence of God. In what follows we will\nbegin with Leibowitz’s understanding of God’s\ntranscendence, which will enable us to proceed to his conceptions of\ntheology, Scripture, Jewish faith, ethics, and briefly politics, all\nof which ultimately wend their way back to that fundamental idea.\nWhile occasionally developments and changes in his thought will be\nnoted, particularly in the political section, on the whole we will be\ndealing with his mature views since, as Hannah Kasher has argued, in\nthe 1992 English translations to which most readers of this will have\naccess, even the earlier essays have been translated in a manner that\noften reflects the later views (Kasher, 2000, 54). \nAccording to Leibowitz, the central idea of Jewish monotheism is the\nradical transcendence of God, a view that has previously been given\nits starkest exposition by his philosophical hero, Maimonides.\nPostponing discussion of its precise logical status for Leibowitz, and\nprovisionally accepting that “God is radically\ntranscendent” is a cognitive statement, a rough first\nformulation of its meaning would be that God is an existent entity\nthat is absolutely incomparable to any other form of reality that we\ncan possibly encounter. \nFollowing Maimonides’ negative theology, Leibowitz claims that\nwe are unable to make any meaningful statements that purport to\ndescribe God. Any attempt to speak of God’s properties or\ncharacteristics transcend the limits of human thought and language. In\ngood Kantian, or even positivist fashion, human categories of thought\nonly get any purchase in the human context within which they are\nformulated. They cannot be assumed to retain their meaning when\napplied beyond the boundaries of possible human experience. Of course,\nthis depends on the further assertion that God is not a possible\nobject of such human experience, a point to which Leibowitz swiftly\nproceeds. For a thoroughgoing commitment to the idea of the radical\ntranscendence of God yields a number of important ontological\nconclusions that go beyond the semantic point made thus far. For\nLeibowitz, the idea of radical transcendence, if taken seriously,\nimplies that God cannot be “contained” within any reality\nthat we encounter. Nature is nature, history is history – and if\nGod is truly transcendent neither are God or are related to God in any\ndirect sense. Thus, in a self-aware, if not self-deprecating moment,\nLeibowitz sets out his “heresy” (his description, not\nmine) thus: “God did not reveal himself in nature or in\nhistory.” (Yahadut, 240) Were things otherwise, then\nnature and history would be “Godly” – and thus would\nbe perfect and worthy of worship themselves. There would be “no\nroom for ‘the holy God’ who transcends natural reality,\nsince then reality itself is divine and man himself is God”\n(Judaism, 25). \nFor Leibowitz, the only alternative to this view is a form of\npantheism – the attribution of divinity in some sense to natural\nobjects – an idea that he admits finds “echoes … in\nJewish mysticism,” which to that extent is therefore\n“incompatible with halakhic Judaism” (Judaism,\n26). The idea that any material object can be holy is something that,\nin Leibowitz’s eyes, is the ultimate definition of idolatry,\npotentially leading to the worship of people, objects,\nor – significantly for his brand of Zionism – land. In\ncontrast, though it might seem ironic at first glance given his view\nof pantheism, Leibowitz here takes up an almost Spinozan approach to\nnature. For Leibowitz, taking God’s transcendence seriously\nentails the elimination of superstitious beliefs in holy entities with\nsupernatural endowments, and thus he endorses a Spinozan\ndemythologization of the natural\n world.[4]\n But while Spinoza is willing to speak of “God or nature,”\nfor Leibowitz, the natural world must be purified of any\ntrace of divinity; divinity – or holiness – is a notion that\nLeibowitz retains as a term to be used in connection with the God who\nradically transcends nature, with no\n remainder.[5] \nDenuding the world of divinity does not stop for Leibowitz at the\nnatural world. History, as the story of humankind in the natural\nworld, can no more carry divine significance than can a material\nobject. The idea that there is some divine purpose in history, that\nGod exerts some form of providence over humankind, would similarly\ncontradict the idea of God’s transcendence and is thus a\nbaseless notion for Leibowitz for whom “an unbiased examination\nof the history of humankind and of the Jews as related in the Bible\nwill not reveal in the entire process … any design or definite\ndirection, or gradual approach to a specific goal”\n(Judaism, 102). \nOn the basis of these remarks, one immediately sees that\nLeibowitz’s thought will be devoid of much that passes for\ntraditional Jewish or general theology. Faith cannot be formulated\naround propositions that speak of God and his providential\nrelationship to the universe. Holiness is confined to God and cannot\nbe predicated of anything that exists in the world (which also,\nincidentally, explains his opposition to any ethnocentric\ninterpretation of the idea of Chosen-ness based on some intrinsic\n“property” of holiness that Jews inherit). Any attribution\nof holiness to objects that might be found in Jewish texts is to be\nunderstood as attributing functional rather than essential holiness to\nthe object in\n question.[6] \nLeibowitz’s God is not a providential God; history has no\nteleology; and we find no attempts at theodicy in Leibowitz. In\ncontrast to many contemporary Jewish philosophers, the holocaust\nmerits barely a mention in his philosophical writings, other than to\ndismiss it from theological discussion. The holocaust, as a historical\nevent, can have no religious meaning for Leibowitz given his\nthoroughgoing commitment to divine transcendence that does not allow\nfor a God who is involved in human\n affairs.[7]\n Those who would question, indeed those who lost their faith in God as\na result of Auschwitz “never believed in God but in God’s\nhelp… [for] one who believes in God … does not relate\nthis to belief in God’s help” (Accepting the\nYoke, 21). \nFor Leibowitz, this is a direct result of taking one’s\ncommitment to the radical transcendence of God to its logical\nconclusion. It is one thing, Leibowitz might say, to pay lip service\nto the idea of God’s transcendence. But if God is to be truly\ntranscendent, then we cannot associate our reality at any level with\nthat of God. The one statement that we can make regarding\nGod – that he is radically transcendent – can only be fleshed\nout further by clarifying how God is not anything that we can\nencounter in ordinary, or for that matter extraordinary, human\nexperience. That Leibowitz here goes beyond even Maimonides is clear\ninasmuch as for Maimonides, though we cannot speak of God’s\nintrinsic properties, we can speak of his “actions,” which\nis to speak of the course of nature, of which God is the first cause.\nAnd yet for Leibowitz, even this would transgress the limits to which\nthe notion of radical transcendence binds us. To say that nature\nreflects God’s actions renders God immanent in nature, and thus\nno longer transcendent. From both a semantic and ontological\nperspective, therefore, Leibowitz takes the notion of God’s\ntranscendence further than even his own philosophical\n“idol” (see Statman 2005), leaving us with a Judaism that\nas Avi Sagi notes, is empty of both “theology and\n‘religious facts’” (Sagi 1997a, 206).  \nLeibowitz begins with a definition of God and draws out its\nimplications for how we are to conceive of the world from a Jewish\nperspective. But where does he find this starting point? Textually\nspeaking, one might claim to find grounding for the radical\ntranscendence of God in various biblical verses and statements drawn\nfrom the Jewish tradition more generally, but no less than one can\nfind quotes to question this account of God’s relationship with\nnature and with history – as Leibowitz himself often\n acknowledges.[8]\n Indeed, any plain reading of Jewish Scripture would seem to suggest a\nGod very closely involved with history and nature. Leibowitz’s\nreading of Jewish Scripture is therefore based on a very particular\nhermeneutic approach to the Tanakh (the acronym used to refer\nto Jewish Scripture, based on the three works of which is\ncomposed – Torah, (lit. instruction),\nNevi’im (Prophets), and Ketuvim\n(Writings)). \nLeibowitz’s definition of the Tanakh as Holy Scripture\nwould appear atypically to place him in uncontroversial territory.\nBut, what, for Leibowitz, does it mean to accord it this status and\nhow is it to be interpreted? For simplicity’s sake, we will\nfocus in what follows on the Torah, the founding constitution of\nJudaism and the most authoritative part of the Tanakh.\nTraditionally, it was believed that: 1) The Torah is the word of God\nas dictated to Moses; and 2) it contains both the history of ancient\nIsrael and the eternally valid laws that bind the Jewish\npeople – the mitzvoth. Though both claims are contested in\ncontemporary denominations of Judaism, Leibowitz is highly critical of\nsuch denominations, identifying himself with Orthodox Judaism within\nwhich these would usually remain fundamental tenets. Yet his view of\nScripture is some distance from the traditional picture. \nWhile many traditionalists would read the Torah as containing the\nprehistory of Judaism – if not of the world – and thus as\nbeing full of factual statements teaching such information, Leibowitz\ncannot accept this to be the case. Beginning with a basic\nepistemological point, as noted earlier Leibowitz’s scientific\ntraining and vocation led him to take a positivistic approach to\nknowledge claims. Thus he writes that “our source of information\nis science. To the extent that we possess any real knowledge it is by\nway of scientific cognition” (Judaism, 136). But, given\nGod’s transcendence, there can be nothing holy about history or\nnature, or the information it provides. So were the Torah a history\nbook or a scientific tract detailing the science of the\nuniverse – and it is of course often read as at least giving an\naccount of the origins of the universe – “it would be\ndifficult to see where [its] sacredness resided”\n(Judaism, 140). The Torah cannot be a holy book if it is\nteaching us information that is by (Leibowitz’s) definition\n profane.[9] \nBut this means that the prima facie factual assertions that\nwe encounter must be read as nothing of the sort. The Torah is not a\nwork of fact containing truths that we can obtain through standard\nepistemic procedures. It is rather, a sacred work, a work that is\nconcerned with the realm of the religious. Not for Leibowitz therefore\nthe time-honoured medieval conundrum regarding faith and reason. While\nfor his medieval Jewish forbears reason and revelation were competing\nfor the same territory – raising the question of the relevance of\nthe latter for those enamoured of the former – Leibowitz is happy\nto give reason its due without worrying about its encroachment into\nthe territory of revelation, and vice versa. The Torah as a\nsacred work is dealing in the realm of the sacred and is not supposed\nto be a repository of the propositional truths of history or science.\nWhat it provides instead is “the demand made of man to worship\nGod” (Judaism, 136). As noted earlier, Leibowitz has no\ntruck with the idea that there could be “religious facts”\nand the idea that belief in creation, for example, could be a\nreligious demand would conflate facts and values. The Torah is the\nsource of the commandments – the mitzvoth – which are the\nmanner in which Jews are to serve God.  \nIn one sense, this hermeneutic serves Leibowitz well, allowing him to\nbypass textual objections to his anti-providential reading of the\nTorah by claiming that the apparent references to God’s role in\nnature or history are no longer to be understood factually, but rather\nas expressing something about the nature of our obligation to God.\nSimilarly, stories of individuals are not to be mined for their\nhistorical content but for what they teach regarding the nature of\nreligious obligation. At the same time, it demands a far from\nintuitive reading of much of Scripture, especially the stories of\nindividuals that are certainly presented as if they are in some sense\nhistorical, and that in the later books of the Prophets that are also\npart of Holy Scripture surely are historical in part. Yet\nLeibowitz insists that in attempting the impossible – speaking of\nGod – the Torah necessarily uses various literary forms amenable\nto human comprehension, but that nonetheless “from the\nstandpoint of religious faith, the Torah and the entirety of Holy\nScripture must be conceived as a demand which transcends the\nrange of human cognition … a demand conveyed in various forms\nof human expression: prescriptions, vision, poetry, prayer, thought,\nand narrative” (Judaism, 140). \nThis does not rule out in principle the possibility of the narratives\nhappening to contain historical information in part. Scripture’s\nnarratives could at times coincide with historical facts, though\nwhether or not this is the case would be subject to independent\nverification of these purported historical facts by standard epistemic\ncriteria. But even allowing for this possibility, the historical\nmeaning would be merely accidental. Such facts would not take on any\nsacred meaning in virtue of that facticity, but rather on account of\nimparting an ahistorical sacred message. The Torah, qua Holy\nScripture, cannot be read as a repository of historical fact. To read\nit “from the standpoint of religious faith,” is to read it\nfor the demands it places upon us. \nNonetheless, given Leibowitz’s views on God’s\ntranscendence, it is clear that the sacred and historical\ninterpretations of the text are mutually exclusive when it\ncomes to references to God’s “intervention” in\nhistory or nature. Maintaining God’s transcendence demands that\nthere can be no such incursions of holiness into the world of the\nprofane, and Leibowitz’s hermeneutic allows him to police these\nboundaries and deny that the Torah teaches us anything about\nGod’s actual intervention in nature or his directing of history.\nApparently factual statements to this end in the Torah are not to be\nconstrued as such, but rather in terms of the normative messages that\nthey carry. Here, the priority that Leibowitz gives to his\nunderstanding of God’s transcendence appears forcefully,\nconstraining him to take this hermeneutic stance. It does, however,\nraise the question of Leibowitz’s understanding of the divine\nstatus of the Torah. For, if we cannot speak of it being revealed by\nGod in any historical sense, whence its divinity? Leibowitz, fully\naware of the problem, maintains that it is the Oral Torah that\nestablishes the divinity of the Written Torah. \nTraditional Jewish teaching maintained that at the same time as he\ntransmitted the Written Torah, God transmitted an oral teaching to\nMoses that was not to be written down. This Oral teaching developed\ninto the multi-layered work that was eventually written down as the\nTalmud by the end of the sixth century and that was the source of the\ncomplex practical system of law – halakhah – that governed\nJewish life until the nineteenth century and continues to structure\nthe life of contemporary Orthodox Jews. Leibowitz maintains that\n“religiously and from a logical and causal standpoint the Oral\nLaw, the Halakhah, is prior to the Written Teaching”\n(Judaism, 12), and thus it is the Oral Torah that grants\ndivine status to the Written Torah: \nThe decision about which books to accept as Scripture was not\nmade behind the veil of mythology or pre-history, but took place in\nthe full light of history and in the course of halakhic\nnegotiation…. Scripture is one of the institutions of the\nreligion of Israel. (Judaism, 12) \nThis, Leibowitz admits, yields an inescapably circular account whereby\nthe divinity of the Written Torah is established by the Oral Torah,\nwhich only gains its own authority on the basis of the Written Torah\nthat it is being used to support. More significantly Leibowitz\nemphasizes time and again that the Oral Torah is a human product. Thus\nwe end up with human beings stipulating that the Written Torah is\ndivine, a stipulation, however, that only has authority based upon the\nWritten Torah’s own statements to the effect that one must\nfollow the words of the human\n sages.[10]\n Reinforcing the circularity, this way of reading of the relevant\nverses in the Torah itself depends on interpretation by the sages. \nLeibowitz maintains, then, that we can say one thing about\nGod – that he is radically transcendent, a statement the content\nof which is exhausted in the denial of any element of divinity to any\nother reality. Allowing for this denial of any positive theology that\nwould relate God to history or nature, we still find one thing to\nwhich we can attach divinity, and that is Scripture. However, the most\nbasic question regarding whether or not God revealed the Torah in any\nhistorical sense must be answered negatively by Leibowitz, as noted in\nStatman 2005 (60) and Sagi 1997a (213), leaving him with an account of\nthe divinity of Scripture that is circular, and that ultimately seems\nunable to escape its reliance on human decision. \nThe “top-down” approach to Leibowitz’s theology\ntaken so far places extreme limits on what one can say or know about\nGod but does not yield a constructive account of the nature of Jewish\nfaith. His positive formulation therefore proceeds from an altogether\ndifferent direction. Taking a more “bottom-up” approach\nmethodologically speaking, Leibowitz utilizes a historical argument in\ndefining Jewish faith, arguing that throughout history, at least until\nthe emancipation of European Jewry beginning at the end of the\neighteenth century, Judaism was defined through adherence to Jewish\npractice, to the commandments of the Torah itself, and the subsequent\ndevelopment of these commandments into the all encompassing system of\nJewish law, or Halakhah. Any definition of Jewish faith must therefore\ncentre upon Jewish practice, on the mitzvoth that governed the\neveryday life of Jews until modern times. Moreover, Leibowitz’s\nhistorical account of faith makes no allowances for any theological\naccretions, be they mystical or philosophical, which would purport to\ndefine it. Jewish theology through the ages has always adapted itself\nto prevailing philosophical or mystical winds, and is seen by\nLeibowitz as “episodic and fleeting” (Judaism,\n8). Whether the conceptual scaffolding was kabbalah or rationalist\nphilosophy, Judaism “was never dependent upon some specific\nphilosophy, ethic, world view, or theology” (Judaism,\n8–9), though it is mysticism and not rationalism which, along\nwith Reform Judaism, he classifies one of “the two great\ndistortions of Jewish faith” (Judaism, 111). \nThis historical account also melds with Leibowitz’s theological\nstarting point. Given God’s transcendence, we know that the\nrealm of natural or historical fact cannot be holy. Faith cannot\ntherefore be “a conclusion a person may come to after pondering\ncertain facts about the world,” and instead is “an\nevaluative decision that one makes, and, like all\nevaluations, it does not result from any information one has acquired,\nbut is a commitment to which one binds himself”\n(Judaism, 37, emphasis added). Jewish faith, therefore, since\nit cannot consist of propositional beliefs concerning God upon which\nhalakhic observance is based, is instead founded upon the evaluative\ndecision to commit to that very system of observance. For Leibowitz it\nis the mitzvoth themselves “which demarcate the realm of the\nsacred … [and] anything outside that realm lacks sanctity and\nis unworthy of religious adoration” (Judaism, 25). \nThis assertion of the primacy of practice is not unique to Leibowitz,\nreaching back in modern Jewish philosophy to Moses Mendelssohn and\nresurrected in recent decades by scholars such as Menachem Kellner\n(2006) and Kenneth Seeskin (1990). Steven Schwarzschild memorably\ntermed this “the Jewish twist” (Schwarzschild 1977, 139)\nthat in his view Jewish thinkers had applied since time immemorial to\nthe systems of thought with which they grappled. Leibowitz, however,\ngives this idea its most extreme formulation. \nOrdinarily one might assume that the commitment to the practice of the\nhalakhic way of life is an independently specifiable mental act and\ncertain statements that Leibowitz makes in his earlier writings,\nvestiges of which remain in some less careful later formulations,\nmight still appear to suggest\n this.[11]\n Yet for Leibowitz, faith is not an independently specifiable\npsychological state that can be defined in isolation from its\npractical fruits. Indeed he castigates those who “wish to\ndistinguish a specific psychological-conceptual content of the\nreligious consciousness from its concrete institutionalized\nembodiment” (Judaism, 38). Leibowitz will not allow us\nto pinpoint a particular psychological state that constitutes this\ncommitment, and correlatively is highly critical of mystical\napproaches to Judaism that revolve around putative religious\nexperiences. A religion devoted to halakhic practice “does not\ndepend upon the incidence of religious experience”\n(Judaism, 13), which is a mere “embellishment” to\nhalakhic practice. Indeed, “the aim of proximity to God is\nunattainable” (Judaism, 16). \nClearly for Leibowitz, the problem with specifying some psychological\nbasis for this commitment is defining what the content of this mental\nact would be. To what am I committed? The natural answer is that we\nare committed to worshipping God. But any attempt to unpack that\nstatement further will lead us to transgress the previously noted\nboundaries of human cognition. The proposition “I am committed\nto God” is not open to further elaboration if God is beyond our\ncategories of language and thought. Belief in God for Leibowitz, which\ncannot be formulated propositionally, can only then be embodied in a\ncommitment to a particular way of life, which is expressed by\nsubordination to the actual practical regime of halakhic practice.\nThus, we are thrust back to the practice itself as the\ncontent of our faith rather than the symptom of some\nindependently specifiable form of faith as psychological commitment.\nIt turns out then that, “[Jewish] faith is nothing but its\nsystem of mitzvoth, which was the embodiment of Judaism”\n(Judaism, 38, emphasis added). Obviously, it is almost a\ntruism that Jewish faith understood this way must involve\nsome form of mental state as the causal motivator of halakhic\naction. Moreover, as we will see presently, the nature of this mental\nstate does make a difference to one’s faith; it is only when\nintended as “worship of God” that such acts are to be\nunderstood as full expressions of faith. But ultimately, in the\nabsence of the practical fruits, one has nothing for Leibowitz. Much\nas “belief in” (in contradistinction to “belief\nthat”) is incorrectly attributed to someone who consistently\nfails to act in accordance with that mental attitude, for Leibowitz\nJewish faith cannot be correctly attributed to a mere psychological\nstate in the absence of actual adherence to the halakhic system.\nJewish faith is therefore equivalent to the observance of mitzvoth\nintended as acts of worship; the concept is exhausted by such\nintentional performance of mitzvoth. \nThis contraction of faith to an almost behavioural definition,\nhowever, means that halakhic observance itself constitutes\nthe faith upon which it is usually thought to be based, and this faith\ncannot be identified independently of this practice, which Leibowitz\nconcedes might create the appearance of paradox: \nHalakhah is founded on faith, yet at the same time constitutes\nthis faith. In other words, Judaism as a living religion creates the\nfaith upon which it is founded. This is a logical paradox but not a\nreligious paradox. (Judaism, 11) \nAsa Kasher, a neo-Leibowitzian, has argued that Leibowitz here does\nnot present a paradox at all, but instead a circle that is related to\nthe one discussed earlier in section 3. Kasher contends that Leibowitz\nis arguing that halakhah creates its faith through its designation of\nthe institutions of Judaism, primarily the divinity of Scripture, with\nits demand to serve God, while Scripture designates the halakhic\nsystem as the way in which such divine service is realized. (A.\nKasher, 1976, 239–40). Leibowitz in response concedes to Kasher\nthat there is no paradox, but stresses that no matter how many times\none goes around the circle, the ultimate commitment to the life of\nmitzvoth must come from beyond the circle, from a conative – rather \nthan cognitive – commitment that is beyond reason (see\n“Responses,” 277–278). \nAs a justificatory argument for engaging in the practice, this might\nindeed create an impression of circularity – though circular\narguments are neither formally invalid, nor paradoxical, but\n“merely” unpersuasive. Leibowitz, however, emphasizes time\nand again that he is not attempting to “justify” the\ncommandments. Medieval Jewish thinkers believed that it was possible\nto “justify” Judaism by appeal to universal standards.\nThus, to take Maimonides for example, if truth is the standard, then\nJudaism is clearly the most rational religion since it is a superior\nexemplar of, or means to attaining the truth, relative to the other\nmonotheistic alternatives. If one were to begin from a neutral\nperspective, a rational being insofar as he is rational, could, in\nprinciple, be convinced of the superiority of Judaism. But this idea\nof a neutral rational starting point from which we can assess\naxiological alternatives is one that Leibowitz rejects. \nHere we again see evidence of Leibowitz’s strict fact/value\ndistinction, and the corresponding limits it places on rationalism\nwhen it is understood as the metaphysical thesis that the world is\nintelligible “all the way down.” The world and in\nparticular our evaluative commitments within it are not\nrational all the way down. The fiction that as fully formed rational\nbeings we cast our eye without prejudice over the various modes of\npractical evaluation and decide in favor of the most rational is\ndismissed by Leibowitz. Once we have certain commitments, as\nevery person does at the time at which he begins to reflect on them,\nour rational faculties can indeed be used as tools for exploring them,\nbut not in the expectation that such reflection can be expected to\nproduce a justification or meaning that will convince all rational\nbeings to commit themselves to such a practice. And if we do ask\n“why commit?” in the expectation of some such answer, we\nare assuming the factual or theoretical stance towards faith that\nLeibowitz contends is rejected by Judaism. When it comes to faith, in\nLeibowitz’s words: \nI know of no ways to faith other than faith itself….\n[It] cannot be taught. One can only present it in all its might and\npower. (Judaism, 37) \nWhile Leibowitz’s very bare account of faith seems hardly robust\nenough as an account of religious commitment, there is more to be said\nfor Leibowitz’s account than first might seem. \nThe claim ultimately for Leibowitz – that the practice of\nhalakhah constitutes faith, while faith is the basis for practice\n– can be broken down into the following two claims: \nClaim 1:\n\nFaith is defined as, or constituted by halakhic practice. \nClaim 2:\n\nFaith, defined as halakhic practice, is founded on that practice. \nClaim 1 can initially be understood as the simple\nempirical/theological claim discussed at the beginning of section 4.\nIn Claim 2, Leibowitz’s point appears to be\nthat while one may wish to argue that one’s practice is founded\non some independently specifiable faith such as the belief that God\ngave these commandments to the Jewish people, given that belief in God\nhas no meaning other than one’s committed practice, in fact\none’s commitment to halakhic practice cannot but be founded on\nthe practice itself. \nThe first thing to note here is that as a matter of empirical fact,\nClaim 2 is more often than not true. It is indeed\nusually the case that halakhic practice precedes belief in God, such\nthat one’s initial practice is not based on that belief in any\nmeaningful sense. At the point at which we are beings who are able to\nreflect thoughtfully about our commitment to our practices and the\norigins of that commitment, we are already implicated in and formed by\nthem. Thus, practice is generally not based on an initial belief in\nGod, but on practice itself, passed down through parents or others. It\nis only subsequent to being committed to the practice that we reflect,\nanalyse, and even formulate the very idea that we are practicing out\nof a commitment to God. Talk of God thus supervenes on the commitment\nto the practice rather than being a justification for it. Jewish\nfaith, Leibowitz tells us, “cannot be understood at all if the\nTorah and its precepts are not construed as data preceding recognition\nof the Giver of the Torah” (Judaism, 5). \nThis goes on to yield an important sense in which Leibowitz’s\ncircle is a virtuous one. Over time if we are good Leibowitzians who\nobserve the mitzvoth, presumably including that of study of Torah\nitself, we will come to understand that this very practice in fact\ndefines the nature of Jewish faith altogether. Thus Claim\n1, initially understood as a historical definition, takes on\nepistemic meaning for the person who practices mitzvoth. One will\nunderstand that faith is indeed this commitment to practice and\nnothing else – for Leibowitz “the purpose of the mitzvoth\nis to educate man to recognize that knowing God and cleaving to him\nconsist in the practice of these very precepts”\n(Judaism, 27). What one comes to realize is that the faith\ncommitment cannot be cashed out other than in terms of that practice\nitself. One might thus read Claim 2 as saying that\nfaith is founded on mitzvoth, in the sense both of being acquired and\nmaintained through practice, and also by creating the understanding of\nfaith spoken of in Claim 1, as over time one comes to\nunderstand that Jewish faith can indeed only be defined\npractically. Much as Aristotle believed that virtuous action precedes\nthe true acquisition of the virtues – the latter involves that\nwe know what we are doing – our commitment to the mitzvoth and\nknowledge of their definitive role within Jewish faith (Claim\n1), or at least the conscious commitment that we make to this\nas reflective beings, is founded on or created by participation in\nthose very halakhic practices (Claim\n 2).[12]\n Just as for Aristotle it is only once we have acquired the virtues\nthat those same acts becomes truly virtuous, in the same way halakhic\nactions only latterly become true acts of religious faith, in which\none is conscious of the manner in which they constitute faith. \nOne might therefore argue that the virtue of the circle is that\ncontinued practice reinforces faith – the practical circle\nis persuasive as a way of reinforcing faith (i.e., practice\nof the mitzvoth) in a way that the circle of logical justification is\nnot. In the original version of this entry, this idea was used to\nargue that Leibowitz could in this way be seen as offering a\nquasi-justificatory phenomenology of faith, whereby the meaning of\nmitzvoth is revealed to its adherents through practice in a manner\nthat simply cannot be presented in discursive terms. As Leibowitz\nwrites in homage to Wittgenstein: “That which cannot be said, is\nsaid by the religion of the Torah and the Mitzvoth,”\n(Yahadut, 343) – or at least by a commitment to them\nthat cannot be given a specification independent of their practice.\nYonatan Brafman, however, correctly points out that “if\none’s commitment to halakhic norms stems from habituation to\ntheir practice, then one has not adopted service of God as a\nvalue” (Brafman, 2014, 82–83); as we noted earlier, it is\nonly if intended as worship of God that an act is a genuine act of\nreligious faith. At the same time, if “service of God” can\nonly be specified in terms of practice, the extent to which such\nhabituation differs from this “service of God” is not\nentirely clear. \nUltimately then, the central problem that Brafman’s critique\nhighlights is that of the difficulty Leibowitz has in specifying any\ncontent for the intent to serve God beyond the commitment to the\npractice. First, what meaning can Leibowitz give to the idea that God\nexists as the object of our worship? It would appear that Leibowitz\nmust at least retain an ontological commitment to there being an\nentity that we can call God, to whom halakhic practices are directed,\nsuch that “God is radically transcendent” remains a\ncognitive statement. But beyond that, there is nothing more that can\nbe said. Of possibly greater concern though is the related question of\nhow the mitzvoth can be seen to be God’s commands. The mitzvoth\nare only “holy” inasmuch as they constitute holiness\nthrough being God’s commands. It is in this way that\nthis practice can constitute faith. Otherwise his model renders\nany commitment to a value system an expression of faith, at\nleast in the sense of being a conative leap that cannot be a result of\nrational\n reflection.[13]\n What then marks this out as Jewish faith is simply that it\nis the Jewish form of life, one that derives from specifically Jewish\nsources and has a specifically Jewish history. But as noted\npreviously, Leibowitz cannot construe statements in the Torah\nregarding the event of revelation at Sinai as historical statements.\nSo the problem remains of how a people could have actually been\ncommanded if it is not the case that at some point in history the\ncommandments were revealed by God. That they could not have been on\nLeibowitz’s theology, renders problematic the idea that they are\nGod’s commands in any meaningful sense, and that our practice is\nthus divine worship. \nThe problem here for Leibowitz is that mitzvoth are indeed enacted by\nhuman beings and thus play a role in the natural world. As a result,\nthey must have a history. At the very least we can say that\nat some point they made their incursion into history. But how? If not\nthrough some miraculous revelatory event – a possibility that\nLeibowitz excludes – then it must have been through some form of\nhuman initiative. Thus, in parallel to the attribution of divinity to\nScripture, as Sagi notes, “the system is made religiously\nmeaningful by the believers’ perception of it as concerned with\nthe worship of God,” while God collapses into a formal\nrequirement of the system, “the supreme concept, uniting the\nsystem and endowing it with religious significance” (Sagi 1997a,\n213). Though it is not clear that this would concern Leibowitz, one\nought to note that the mere institutional decision to categorize the\nmitzvoth as holy is hardly a firm basis for recovering their divinity\nin any sense that would satisfy most of the religious adherents the\nnature of whose faith he is attempting to delineate. \nLeibowitz’s exclusion of God from history thus leaves him\napparently unable to account for the divinity of the commandments in a\nmanner that would render their performance acts of commitment to\nGod in the ordinary sense. Indeed, when asked directly whether\nthe statement “I believe in God” is meaningful,\nLeibowitz’s response was: “I do not understand these words\nif they are divorced from the obligations that derive from them\n… faith in God is not what I know about God, but what I know\nabout my obligations to God” (Sihot, 97). Talk of\ndivinity should not be understood cognitively but in terms of the\nnormative demands it imposes. Even talk of the revelation at Sinai is\nto be construed along these lines – “The meaning of the\nrevelation at Sinai is the recognition of the command that we have\nbeen commanded” (Emunah, 154). Again, whether this\nyields a system that can genuinely be termed divine rather than one\nthat is merely designated as such by humans, who after all, for\nLeibowitz, cannot themselves be a locus of holiness, is brought into\nquestion. \nLeibowitz cannot make sense of the divinity of the mitzvoth by\nclaiming that God is their source in any straightforward sense. Having\nreduced all meaningful discourse about God and faith to halakhic\npractice, one might thus look to the meaning of the practice for some\nsuch mark of divinity. As we have noted earlier, talk of\n“meaning” for Leibowitz is bound up with that of value and\npurpose, so it is to these that we must look for the meaning of the\ndivinity of the mitzvoth, and Leibowitz has much to say about the\npurpose of the mitzvoth, particularly as they relate (or not) to human\nvalues, based on a basic Talmudic distinction between two forms of\nreligious worship – worship that is\n“lishmah,” or “for its own sake,” and\nworship that is “Not-lishmah,” or “not for\nits own sake.” \nWorship that is “Not-lishmah” Leibowitz characterizes in\nteleological terms. It begins with a set of human values and beliefs,\nand understands religion as the instrument for the realization of\nthese values. Thus religious acts will be derived from this set of\nvalues, as the acts that best achieve them. These values, therefore,\nare prior to the religious act, much in the way utilitarian ethical\ntheory prioritizes a definition of the good and defines right action\nin terms of what maximizes that good. Religious action then is at base\nmotivated by human needs and the problem with such worship for\nLeibowitz is that it renders God the servant of man. It is what he\nterms “an endowing religion – a means of satisfying\nman’s spiritual needs and of assuaging his mental conflicts. Its\nend is man, and God offers his services to man”\n(Judaism, 14). \nReflecting an ambivalence that runs through statements in the Jewish\ntradition regarding such worship, Leibowitz vacillates between\nrecognizing worship “Not-lishmah” as a genuine if flawed\nform of worship and as not seeing it as worship at all – indeed,\nseeing it as idolatrous in its reduction of worship of God to worship\nof man, thus implying that man is\n holy.[14]\n Philosophically speaking, his negative attitude can again be traced\nback to his strictly scientific approach to the world and his views\nconcerning God’s transcendence. Regarding the former, Leibowitz\ndismisses the idea that human beings exist at some supra-natural\nlevel. As creatures of flesh and blood, we are governed by the same\nnatural laws as the rest of nature. Human beings have no special\nendowment that transcends their physical nature. Given that this is\nthe case, human needs cannot be sacred, and thus the service of human\nneed cannot be the purpose of the mitzvoth. Coming from the opposite\ndirection, given that God is transcendent and cannot be related to any\nform of concrete reality, including human reality, how could the\nservice of our own needs, which are a function of our humanity,\nconstitute worship of God? God must be the exclusive locus of\nreligious value, to the exclusion of human values. Man, in comparison,\nis but human, and a part of nature. Thus, while Medieval Jewish\nphilosophers usually take the statement at Genesis 1:27 that man was\ncreated “in the image of God” as placing man on a pedestal\nby somehow comparing him to God, for Leibowitz, the verse should be\ntaken to indicate that man is a mere “image” in its more\nprosaic, if not pejorative Platonic sense (Judaism, 90). \nIn marked contrast to all of this, Leibowitz presents the idea of\nworship “lishmah,” which is the mark of a\ndemanding religion. Here, the religious act is prior to any set of\nhuman needs or values. It is characterized by acts of worship demanded\nby God, where the demands made, and the motivations for serving, are\nsimply that – they are Gods’ demands. Here man is\n“an instrument for the realization of an end which transcends\nman … [who] serves his God lishmah – because He is worthy\nof worship” (Judaism, 14). Essentially, Judaism is a\nreligion that demands that man serve God, not that God serve man.\nMitzvoth, for Leibowitz, are not therefore based on human needs and\ndesires since that would subordinate God to human values, rendering\nGod a slave to humanity, and placing humanity at the pinnacle of all\nvalue. Most mitzvoth for Leibowitz must therefore “be\nmeaningless except as expressions of worship. They have no utility in\nterms of satisfaction of human needs” (Judaism, 16).\nRelatedly, he therefore sees much of halakhah as constitutive of\nreligious “reality” rather than as regulating a\npre-existing reality. The dietary laws, to take an obvious example,\nare not there to regulate some form of pre-existing sacred reality.\nReality is equivalent to physical reality and the dietary laws are\nnothing more (nor less) than requirements of worship constituting a\nhalakhic “reality,” which is a reality that has no\nreferent beyond itself. \nThis sui generis understanding of halakhah is important if we\nare to understand Leibowitz’s retreat from facts to values in\nthe realm of faith. We have seen that to speak of any factual reality\nas divine impugns God’s transcendence for Leibowitz. But one\nmight ask why speaking of God as a source of values within our world\nis any less of an intrusion upon his transcendence. Leibowitz’s\npoint is that God is not a source of values within our world,\nsince halakhah is not a function of any human values, indeed not a\nfunction of any set of values to which we have any independent access.\nIn this way Leibowitz retains the transcendence of God in the\nevaluative realm of faith commitments in a way that is not possible in\nthe realm of facts. Nonetheless, the question of how such transcendent\nvalues entered human history, in essence, the problem of revelation\ndiscussed at the end of the previous section, rears its head once\nmore. It is impossible to claim that mitzvoth were literally revealed\nby God given His radical transcendence, yet if we simply regard them\nas human, whence their divinity? \nIt is noteworthy that here a Kierkegaardian interpretation could offer\na solution. While one can find comparisons with Kierkegaard in Sigad\n1977, Harvey 2002, and scattered throughout Sagi 2009 (to name but a\nfew such sources), it is Roi Benbassat who argues for a\n“fundamental analogy between the two thinkers” such that\nhe sees Leibowitz’s “religious position as a variation of\nKierkegaard’s faith in the absurd developed from the same\ntypical existentialist conception of ethics” (2015, 143). We\nwill investigate the specifically ethical bent of Benbassat’s\nclaim presently, but we here note that when we remarked earlier that\nLeibowitz retreated from his claim that Jewish faith was based on a\nparadox, he may have spoken too soon. For what, other than a paradox,\ncould account for the actual divinity of mitzvoth in the absence of\nany possibility of divine incursion into the human arena? According to\nBenbassat, “to claim there is no paradox is to disregard the\nvery essence of Leibowitz’s position” (Benbassat 2015,\n151), and it might be that only a paradox will allow the ultimate\nconative commitment that is Leibowitzian faith to truly be worship of\nGod. Whether this picture can indeed be assimilated to that drawn by\nLeibowitz – and his strong scientific grounding certainly leaves\nroom for doubt – it does, at this stage, seem to be the only way\nfor him to maintain that performance of mitzvoth constitutes genuinely\ndivine service.  \nLeibowitz’s view of mitzvoth has important implications for the\nrelationship between ethics and religion in general and more\nspecifically for the relationship between ethics and halakhah.\nLeibowitz does not deny that there is a genuine realm of ethical\nvalue, writing that both the theocentric (religious) and\nanthropocentric (Kantian) conceptions of value are\n“legitimate” (Judaism, 208). Leibowitz certainly\nrecognizes that beyond the realm of halakhah “flourish many good\ndeeds and events of grandeur and sublimity” (Judaism,\n25). Generally for Leibowitz, halakhah is not all-encompassing and\ndoes not govern all behavior, as he makes explicit in his interviews\nwith Michael Shashar where he asks rhetorically whether Judaism has a\nperspective on the decision whether to build a bridge over a\nparticular river (Sihot, 91). For Leibowitz then, there are\nclearly other aspects of human life that are necessary, indeed\nvaluable, and that need not be dedicated to the worship of God. If,\ntherefore, one is acting for the sake of one’s fellow man, one\nmust simply recognize that this is the performance of a noble ethical\nact, not a holy religious act. What Leibowitz stresses is the\nimportance of not confusing the one with the other. \nSo religion, it might be argued, must be the highest value for\nLeibowitz to which all others are subordinated in times of conflict;\nit need not be the only value. Religious values just cannot be\nsubordinated to ethical values which, since dictated by human\ninterests for Leibowitz, are profane by definition. Ethics, as\nLeibowitz notes, is the “atheistic category par\nexcellence” (Judaism, 18), placing man at the apex of\nour values in place of God. In contrast: \nThe Torah does not recognize moral imperatives stemming from\nknowledge of natural reality or from awareness of man’s duty to\nhis fellow man. All it recognizes are Mitzvot, divine\nimperatives. (Judaism, 18) \nUnsurprisingly given the above, much has been made of the formal\nsimilarities between Leibowitz’s approach to mitzvoth and\nKantian ethics. Both stress “worship lishmah”\n– or the categorical nature of both the ethical and halakhic\nimperative, neither of which can be instrumental means to ends beyond\nthe respective duties themselves. It is just that Kantian ethics\n“worships” man “lishmah,” or as an\nend in himself, while religion worships God. Moreover, as with Kantian\nmoral imperatives, the upshot of acting on religious imperatives for\nLeibowitz is autonomy. But while ethical action is autonomous for Kant\ninasmuch as it is a deliverance of our own practical reason, that very\nfact means that for Leibowitz ethical action is not an\nexpression of human autonomy, but of our enslavement to our own\nnature. Recalling that for Leibowitz man is simply a part of nature\nlike any other, when acting in accordance with that nature, man is\n“in effect, nothing but a robot activated by the forces of\nnature, just like the cattle grazing in the pasture, which are also\n‘free from the Torah and Mitzvoth’; that is, from any law\nexternally imposed” (Judaism, 21). \nThough perhaps his rhetoric gets the better of him in comparing man\nacting on his own nature to an animal acting on its own nature,\nLeibowitz’s central and apparently incompatibilist point is that\nfreedom cannot be a function of acting according to one’s own\nnature if man’s nature “is only the last link in a causal\nchain of the forces of inorganic and organic nature which act upon him\nand within him” (ibid.). If this is the case, then the ethical\ndictates of human reason no more render man autonomous than do the\n‘acts’ of his digestive system. Man is only “free\nfrom the bondage of nature because he lives a life that is contrary to\nnature,” and thus “emancipation from the bondage of nature\ncan only be brought about by the religion of the Mitzvoth”\n(Judaism, 22). \nYet this contrast with Kant actually betrays a deeper similarity. Kant\nsees ethical action as the route to autonomy precisely because it is\nthrough practical reason that we transcend our own nature and make\ncontact with the noumenal realm. In effect therefore, and despite\nKant’s wish to keep religion and ethics apart from a\nmotivational perspective, Kant and Leibowitz are in agreement that\nhuman autonomy requires that man transcend his phenomenal nature. The\ndifference is that while for Kant ethics is, in a certain sense,\ntranscendent – at least transcending man’s empirical if\nnot his rational nature – for Leibowitz ethics remains a\nfunction of human nature and therefore mired in the\n“phenomenal” realm destined never to escape.\nLeibowitz’s view of autonomy appears to depend again on his\nthoroughgoing “naturalism” in regard to the physical and\nhuman world. Only the realm of mitzvoth can effect the sort of\nLeibowitzian “transcendence” that yields autonomy. \nNotably, Brafman argues that this idea enables Leibowitz to\n“offer an argument to the effect that service of God is actually\nthe most fitting value for an individual to adopt” (Brafman,\n2015, 157). For Brafman, Leibowitz can argue that at least at the\naxiological level, one can proclaim the superiority of service of God\nto all other axiological choices. In brief, precisely because\npractical reason (correctly applied) “coerces” us to a\nsingle conclusion, for Leibowitz it cannot be the seat of autonomy\nthat Kant claims it to be. Only a choice that is not rational, one\ndevoid of any humanly understood value, can be truly autonomous. And\nas we have seen above, for Leibowitz, it is service of God alone that\nmeets this standard. Thus, the only truly free act, and thus the only\nact that is fully value-bearing, is that of serving God through\nhalakhah since “halakhic norms satisfy no natural or rational\nhuman concern” (ibid., 160). If we wish then to base the\ndivinity of the mitzvoth on their meaning as opposed to any historical\nevent of revelation, the meaning of the mitzvoth that marks them out\nas divine is, in a sense, their very\n“meaninglessness.” \nIt is this total lack of rationality, however, that leads to\nBenbassat’s aforementioned Kierkegaardian reading of Leibowitz.\nFor Benbassat, Leibowitz’s view of halakhic practice cannot be\ndeontological since that would require “an objective foundation\nof duty that allows it to be recognized as valid regardless of\nend-determinations” (2015, 148). Kant provides that objective\nfoundation through his account of practical reason. Leibowitz,\nhowever, presents halakahic practice as a groundless conative\ncommitment, the basis for the validity of which is simply faith,\nunderstood as “a purely subjective positing of a superior\nend” (ibid, 149), that end being the worship of God.\nNonetheless, this “end-determination” does not render\nLeibowitz’s view teleological, since his view of faith, and\nindeed of divine worship does not “posit an end separate from\nduty … [but rather] posits duty itself as an end” (ibid,\n150). While the earlier discussion of Kierkegaardian paradox may have\nappeared counter to Leibowitz’s scientific background, on this\noccasion his radical take on human autonomy does seem to lend itself\nmore naturally to an existentialist reading. \nThe flipside of this understanding of service of God in terms of\nradical human autonomy is that halakhah must be understood as\nexpressing a form of primordial divine heteronomy. This yields a\nfertile area of comparison to Levinas in Fagenblat 2004, though as\nFagenblat notes, for Levinas the realm of the ethical itself\nis a realm of transcendence beyond discursive human rationality.\nUnlike Leibowitz, for Levinas we need not go as far as mitzvoth to\nfind the realm of\n transcendence.[15]\n Either way, whether Leibowitz’s views on the distinction\nbetween religion and ethics hold up depends in large part on 1)\nwhether one can indeed justify morality on rational or naturalistic\nfoundations, or whether it does in some way transcend human nature;\nand 2) the viability of his radicalized notion of freedom as the seat\nof ultimate\n value.[16] \nAs we have noted, much as Kant does for moral value, Leibowitz locates\nthe religious value of our acts in our intentions. Holiness, he tells\nus, “is nothing but halakhic observance; the specific\nintentional acts dedicated to the service of God”\n(Judaism, 24, emphasis added). Presumably then, mitzvoth\ncould be performed for the sake of worshipping God and yet have\nincidental benefit to us. As long as the motivation is the worship of\nGod, any incidental benefits would surely be legitimate, or at least\nnot rule out the act as religiously worthy. What matters here is the\nhierarchy of values – observance of mitzvoth cannot be\nsubordinated to ethical values. Leibowitz’s\nintentionalism dictates that religious acts, even if they incidentally\nsatisfy certain human needs, would still not be ethical acts given\ntheir religious motivation. \nThe idea of ethical mitzvoth, however, now becomes an oxymoron for\nLeibowitz. An act is either religious or ethical. Even “You\nshall love your neighbor as yourself,” is to be regarded as a\nmitzvah, not as an ethical precept. The key phrase in the verse\ncontaining this commandment for Leibowitz is that which follows\nimmediately to end the verse: “I am God.” It is a duty\ntowards one’s neighbor that is based on man’s position\nbefore God, not his position before his fellow man. \nOne of Leibowitz’s concerns is that for imperatives to be truly\ncategorical, they must draw their authority from something other than\nhuman needs and values, which are too weak a foundation to ground\ncategorical imperatives. One can always excuse oneself with the claim\nthat other people’s needs are not overriding in any given\nsituation. There is no escape, however, from the authority of a divine\ndemand, so locating ethical imperatives within a religious system\ngives them the necessary foundation. Their position as commandments\ntransforms them from “mere good counsel, a noble aspiration, or\na sublime ideal,” and instead gives them “the reality of\nlaw, something one is compelled to take seriously as one must take a\npolice ordinance seriously” (Judaism, 19). Yet given\nhis intentionalism, for Leibowitz this must simultaneously deprive an\nact of its ethical character. Acting for noble ideals, while\nlegitimate, would still render acts ethical, not religious. \nThis raises a problem for Leibowitz, since it is not clear that it can\ndo justice to the ethical prescriptions of the Torah qua ethical\nprescriptions. Ought I to act justly towards my neighbor out of my\nconcern for him, or out of concern for God? While it seems clear that\nLeibowitz could only see the latter as a religious act, it is not\nclear that this sits comfortably with our ethical intuitions –\nthough presumably Leibowitz would simply retort that this is precisely\nwhat it means to subordinate human interest to the ultimate value that\nis the worship of God. While a Levinasian squaring of the circle would\nallow that our ethical concern for the other is itself a mark\nof transcendence, for Leibowitz, a religious act, even if it may serve\none’s fellow man incidentally, can neither be motivated by such\na goal, nor allow such goals to play a role in our understanding of it\nas a mitzvah, since this would render God the slave of human\ninterests. \nThe question that arises, however, is whether in the case of ethically\nmotivated acts that coincide with mitzvoth, a Jew ought to have\ninstead performed the act for religious reasons – a position\nthat would not leave much room for a religious person to perform an\nethical action. Indeed, it would seem that if one wishes to\nperform the mitzvah of, for example, “loving one’s\nneighbor,” one ought not to be acting based on ethical\nmotives. As such, it is not clear what becomes of the legitimacy of\nthe ethical realm for a religious Jew, since every ethically motivated\nact constitutes a missed opportunity for the worship of God. Each act\nought to be religiously rather than ethically motivated, even when the\nmere act itself would be the same. While it is not as if one who is\nethically motivated can sincerely transform that ethical motivation\ninto a religious one, it seems as if becoming the type of person who\nnaturally acts religiously in such cases would have to be the ultimate\naim for Leibowitz. This would not deny all value to ethically\nmotivated acts, but it certainly seems to problematize those that\ncoincide with specific mitzvoth for Jews qua Jews. Though\nhappily the demands of the two realms often coincided,\nLeibowitz’s picture, it seems, leads to the problematic\nconclusion that ultimately a Jew ought not to be ethical, but instead\nreligious. \nLeibowitz’s account of halakhah is not uni-dimensional. His\nclaim that most of the mitzvoth are meaningless according to\nhuman conceptions of value (Judaism, 16) leaves an important\ngap that he exploits elsewhere in his writings, particularly in a\nshort late piece on the status of women in Judaism, where he\ndistinguishes between two types of mitzvoth in a manner that renders\nthe picture considerably more complex. \nThus on the one hand, we have the ritual commandments required of men\nand not required of women. These mitzvoth are indeed\n“meaningless,” having no intrinsic value beyond their\nstatus as mitzvoth that God requires of men and not women. They do not\nreflect any exalted status for men or yield access to some sort of\nreligious experience beyond the mere burden of performance. Given\nthis, the desire of women to take on such practices in the name of\nequality reflects a fundamental misunderstanding – or at least a\nnon-Leibowitzian understanding – of the nature of these\ncommandments. And yet, when it comes to the highest levels of Torah\nstudy and access to public office, both of which had traditionally\nbeen halakhically forbidden to women, Leibowitz takes a very different\nview. Barring women access to the study of Torah “is not to\nexempt them from a duty … but is to deprive them of a basic\nJewish right … [that] renders their Jewishness inferior to that\nof men” (Judaism, 129). The original restriction, as\nwell as that regarding attaining public office, reflected the\nprevailing socio-cultural norms of the surrounding society rather than\nany essential halakhic determinations. Thus Leibowitz wishes to\ndistinguish between \nabsolute demands reflecting acceptance of the ‘yoke of\nthe kingdom of heaven’ that are not amenable to adjustment to\nnatural or social factors, [and] practices which reflect given\ncircumstances and the views shaped by them; in other words, between\nunconditional prescriptions and proscriptions and norms reflecting a\ngiven sociocultural milieu and its prejudices.\n(Judaism, 131) \nWe find, therefore, a realm of mitzvoth that do appear to be\nsubservient to human values and societal change. That Leibowitz\nbelieves in such a category, independently of the highly charged\ngender question, is clear from the following: \nConsider the proscription of ploughing with an ox and an ass\nyoked together. Does this imply a duty to base agriculture on animal\npower and to create the opportunity for fulfilling the prohibition?\nReversing the terms, is mechanized agriculture, which obviates the use\nof animals as a source of energy forbidden because it removes all\nopportunity for observing this mitzvah? Or is it permissible to assume\na hypothetical imperative: in the event that animals are used, avoid\nploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together?\n(Judaism, 149) \nThe Torah clearly contains laws or commandments that react to\npolitical and social institutions already in place – hence laws\nconcerning slavery for example. Thus it turns out that there are two\ncategories of mitzvoth for Leibowitz: type1 acts without\nintrinsic meaning that are constitutive of a halakhic reality and not\namenable to change; and type2 acts where the halakhic\ncommunity has responsibility for regulating a pre-existing reality.\nThese halakhic acts can change depending on the general sociocultural\nnorms governing that particular aspect of reality, be it agriculture,\nor gender equality. Indeed, Leibowitz often notes explicitly that\nJudaism is not to be identified with the specific laws with which it\nbegan, but with the “recognition of a system of precepts as\nbinding, even if their specifics were often only determined with\ntime” (Judaism, 4). \nWhat is one to make of this concession? While there might be strong\narguments for drawing such a distinction on both textual and common\nsense grounds, the question is whether Leibowitz’s system can\nconsistently allow such external concerns to intrude upon religion\nwithout usurping it. The meta-halakhic issue, as Leibowitz terms it,\nregarding the status of women in the Jewish community, drives specific\nhalakhic changes. And ultimately what appears to be driving these\nchanges is an ethical assumption regarding unjustified gender\ninequalities. But if one is allowing religious norms to be\nsubordinated to human values, then by Leibowitz’s standards one\nis serving man rather than God – if the motivation here is\nethical or more broadly social, then surely by his intentional\ndefinition of mitzvoth, they cease to be religious acts. \nIn the particular case of gender equality, however, there are broader\nconcerns that come into play – the survival of Judaism. While\nthis is not explicit in everything that Leibowitz writes, he makes\nprecisely this claim regarding the gender issue in an interview with\nMichael Shashar – “the future of Judaism depends on\nit” (Sihot, 110). One might argue therefore that our\nbeing responsive to the ethical concerns presented in these cases has\nreligious significance since it is subsumed under the overriding\nreligious concern to maintain the existence of Judaism. Thus\nthese acts would retain their religious significance given the more\ngeneral religious motivation for the changes. One might think of them\nas having religious value in a secondary sense, given that they serve\nthe end of maintaining the halakhic system, while straightforward\nmitzvoth or halakhic demands have religious value in the primary\nsense. \nIt is very difficult, however, to escape the feeling that Leibowitz is\ndriven here by his ethical impulses, and more significantly it is\nclear that all manner of halakhic decisions are motivated by explicit\nconsideration of ethical issues that impinge on the halakhic decision\nmaking process. One could argue that given that such principles as\n“the ways of pleasantness” or “doing the right and\nthe good” are internal to the halakhic system, Leibowitz could\ncontend that one need not go beyond the structures of the system in\norder to make the changes that he endorses. One might thus consider\nthese as “principles” in the Dworkinian sense, as fully\npart of the legal system and the bearers of “weight” when\nit comes to deciding halakhic questions (Dworkin, 1977, 22ff).\nLeibowitz’s conception of the halakhic system seems, however, to\nbe more akin to legal positivism (see Brafman 2014, 101ff), as befits\na scientist, and it seems as if the above response would require\nLeibowitz to reject a straightforward positivist\nunderstanding of the halakhic system. On such an understanding,\nethical principles are seen as external to the system, even if able to\ndetermine what the halakhah “ought to be” – but such\na view would entirely undermine the halakhic validity of any decisions\ngiven that they would be serving human needs. The involvement of\nprinciples in this manner though, need not necessarily undermine a\npositivist reading of Leibowitz, but could instead render his account\na form of inclusive legal positivism. Of course there are those who\nwould argue that this would undermine his positivism since\ninclusive legal positivism is incoherent, but this is a debate that\nwould take us too far afield. \nRegardless of these jurisprudential issues, vague principles such as\nthose mentioned are not going to decide the question of whether\nspecific changes actually do advance the “ways of\npleasantness”. De facto it is surely almost impossible\nto insulate such considerations from human interests, which would of\ncourse disqualify them as considerations that should determine\nreligious acts on Leibowitz’s intentional model. Moreover, one\nmight even question the very idea that the mitzvoth should serve the\nclearly human purpose of the continued existence of Judaism, since it\nundercuts Leibowitz’s notion that the only purpose of the\nmitzvoth is the knowledge that service of God consists in their\nperformance. Then again, Leibowitz could presumably respond by appeal\nto his identification of the performance of mitzvoth with faith in\nGod. This means that in the absence of the continued existence of the\nJewish people, the performance of mitzvoth would cease. Thus the\ncontinued existence of the people is indeed only a\n“purpose” inasmuch as its own purpose is the performance\nof mitzvoth, i.e., service of God. Leibowitz, then, could possibly\nfind a way of ensuring that all changes are ultimately directed\ntowards the service of God as his system demands. As a good positivist\nthough, he may balk at this ability to make almost any act into an act\nof divine worship, since his original sharp and well-defined\ndistinction between acts of worship and acts that answer to human or\nsocial needs will likely now suffer Anthony Flew’s “death\nby a thousand qualifications” (Flew, 1950). \nUnless then Leibowitz is going to allow ethical motivation for certain\nhalakhic decisions and problematize his system, or gerrymander his\ndescriptions of those decisions so as to force them into his religious\nstraitjacket, it appears as if these areas of decision and action\ncannot be deemed religious in the strict sense. Leibowitz certainly\nrecognizes that halakhic decisions are “grounded either in the\nHalakhah itself or in the conditions necessary for halakhic\nobservance” (Judaism, 4), and thus it may be that these\nethical halakhic decisions are “enablers” rather than\ndirect loci of religious worship. By contracting the religious sphere\nin this way, Leibowitz could maintain some indirect religious value\nfor the ethically motivated acts of a religious Jew. But the\ncontraction that such a move necessitates would relegate enormous\ntracts of the Talmud to this lesser status, which seems problematic.\nAnd again to counter that all decisions are taken by the halakhic\nauthorities with the general motivation of “serving God,”\nwould make it difficult to retain any form of distinction between\nreligion and ethics of the form that Leibowitz clearly wishes to\nmaintain. Of course many of these problems hang on the thread of\nLeibowitz’s concept of intention – one that assumes that\nintentions can be clearly and exclusively identified as\n“ethical” or “religious.” Melzer (1976, 261),\nhowever, among others, has argued that Leibowitz’s concept of\nintention is impoverished. \nSetting aside the problems just identified, Leibowitz’s\ndistinction remains problematic in the context of his overall system.\nHe explicitly categorizes the realm of synagogue ritual to\ntype1 acts. Yet in much of contemporary orthodoxy, this is\none of the most fought over issues, and one in which the inequalities\nfor women are understood by some as tantamount to the denial of\n“a basic Jewish right … [that] renders their Jewishness\ninferior to that of men” (Judaism, 129). Should women\nfeel so marginalized by this particular inequality that it threatens\nthe future of Judaism, leading to sanctioning the participation of\nwomen in certain rituals, Leibowitz’s type1 mitzvoth\nwould have to be recategorized as type2 mitzvoth and we\nwould have to conclude that the categories are fluid and that\ncommandments can move between categories. But then the question of how\nwe categorize the commandments seems to become dependent on human\nperception and values, which would once again be problematic for\nLeibowitz. \nUltimately then, Leibowitz struggles to maintain God’s radical\ntranscendence and his intentional account of religious worship in its\nmost pristine form. Neither history, nor nature, including human\nnature, are sources of religious value. God’s prescriptions\nalone are holy and Jewish worship, indeed Jewish faith, is simply the\ncommitment to this behavioral regime. But while he begins with a tidy\ndefinition of religious acts as absolute commands performed with the\nintention of serving God, as acts that cannot be motivated by human\nconcerns or interests, the fact that life involves other given civil\nand social settings requires that we deal with such interests. This\nyields type2 acts, with resulting questions regarding\nwhether or not these mitzvoth can be understood as such without\nLeibowitz’s theocentrism folding into a form of\nanthropocentrism. The distinction necessary to prevent this amongst\nhalakhic decisors – that between the intention of\n“realizing the Torah” and the intention to “adapt\nHalakhah to a variety of human needs” (Judaism, 4)\n– is difficult to maintain, and, one imagines, could very easily\nfall victim to self-deception. In general, it seems as if\nLeibowitz’s system simply cannot take the strain of maintaining\nits pristine religious intentionalism while dealing with ongoing\nhalakhic questions in a functioning society. \nLeibowitz was an unabashed Zionist. However, Zionism for Leibowitz was\ndefined simply as “the endeavor to liberate Jews from being\nruled by the Gentiles” (Judaism, 214), an endeavor that\nthe state of Israel “completely satisfies.” Thus, despite\nbeing a religious Jew, Leibowitz’s Zionism is avowedly secular,\nand his secular version of Zionism flows directly from the central\ntenets of his philosophy. Firstly, it is dictated by his intentional\napproach to religious action – the motivation for setting up the\nstate was political and nationalistic rather than religious. Indeed,\nZionism was initially a secular Jewish revolution, a political\nmovement with nationalist aspirations. Secondly, it is directly\nimplied by his view that the service of human needs and interests\ncannot be equated with the service of God. For Leibowitz, the state\nachieves a perfectly noble political purpose, serving human needs. But\nagain this should not be confused with its having religious\nvalue in itself: \nCounterfeit religion identifies national interests with the\nservice of God and imputes to the state – which is only an\ninstrument serving human needs – supreme value from a religious\nstandpoint. (Judaism, 226–227) \nThus, it would seem as if religion and state cannot possibly be\nlinked, and this indeed was a position that Leibowitz would take. Here\nthough, it seems as if Leibowitz’s thought, or at least his\nattitude towards what constitutes meaningful discourse, underwent\nsignificant development. \nIn his earliest writings of the early 1930s, written while still in\nGermany, Leibowitz was aligned with the religious Zionism of the\nMizrachi movement. For Leibowitz, the contraction of the halakhic\nsystem over almost two thousand years of exile had led to its\ndisfigurement. Confined to the private sphere as a result of\nJudaism’s exilic reality over this period, in combination then\n(and now) with the secularization wrought by modernity, the halakhic\nsystem had never had to deal with the challenge of nationhood. With\nthe advent of Zionism, Leibowitz writes “we are presented with\nthe opportunity and the task of realizing through and within the land\nof Israel the concealed power of Torah” (Ratziti, 327),\nthrough the application, indeed restoration, of the system of Jewish\nlaw to its original nation-building purpose whereby it might produce a\nstate that could run according to Jewish law; that could accommodate,\nfor example, the needs of a country to have a fully working police\nforce and electrical system on the Sabbath without being parasitic on\nJews who do not observe the laws forbidding such action on the\nSabbath. For Leibowitz, “a specific and detailed halakhic code\nfor administering the full panoply of state functions is called for\n… [to give] a clear picture of how the religious parties would\nrun the state if and when they came to power” (Judaism,\n170–171). \nInitially, this “role of enacting new halakhic\nlegislation” was assigned by Leibowitz “to the religious\npublic as a whole” (Torah u-Mitzvot, 73). During this\nearly period, as Moshe Hellinger points out, Leibowitz presents a\n“participatory democratic model” (Hellinger, 2008, 257),\nthat yields a radical form of democratic halakhic Judaism. As early as\n1947, however, Leibowitz is noting how “the sector of the\nreligious public organized as a political movement lacks a religious\nprogram for the conduct of the state” (Judaism, 154),\nleading him instead to look to the religious rabbinic establishment to\ntake the courageous steps necessary to provide a vision for such a\n“halakhic state.” \nThis nation-building vision would have necessitated a halakhic\nrevolution, utilizing innovative and creative techniques of Jewish\nlegal interpretation and application. But instead, in\nLeibowitz’s eyes the religious parties prostituted themselves to\nthe state to protect their own brand of religious sectarianism,\nsubordinating religion to the machinery of the secular government.\nLeibowitz’s initial radicalism thus came up against the halakhic\nconservatism of his fellow religious Zionists, which, together with\nwhat he saw as the moral corruption of its rabbinic leadership, led to\nhis disillusionment with religious Zionism, disillusion that was\nfurther exacerbated by the Kibiyeh affair (see Hellinger 2008, 275ff),\nwhich served to reinforce his view regarding the pernicious\nconsequences of “applying the religious category of holiness to\nsocial, national, and political values” (Judaism, 189).\nThus, by 1959, in recognition of this reality, Leibowitz changed his\ntune, presenting a call for the separation of religion and state as\nthe only program “that would be in the religious interest in the\nexisting situation” (Judaism, 175). \nStill, at this point, while reality has bitten, there is no statement\nthat in principle religion and state must remain separate. A\ndecade later, however, Leibowitz seems to espouse such a view, stating\nthat “no state whatsoever, in the past, present, or any\nforeseeable future, in any society, in any era, in any culture,\nincluding the Jewish culture, ever was or will ever be anything but a\nsecular institution” (Judaism, 215–216). \nOn the one hand, this should come as no surprise given that politics\nis concerned with human institutions that serve human needs, and\nLeibowitz cannot allow for acts of religious worship that are directed\ntowards human needs. On the other hand, it does clearly represent a\nshift in his thought, from a de facto to a de jure\nrejection of the religious Zionist dream. Nonetheless, in noting that\nthe state “sets the ground for the struggle for religion, which\nis by its very nature an eternal struggle that will never end in\nvictory” (Judaism, 215–216), he does appear to\nleave open the possibility of political action having some form of\nreligious import. Indeed, he goes on to say that the reason that\nIsrael has no religious significance is precisely “because no\nsuch struggle is being conducted in it” (ibid.), which appears\nto imply the possibility of a state having such significance were it\nto provide for such a struggle, though at this stage the idea that\nthis could eventuate in any form of democratic religious polity has\nbeen replaced by a vision of the state as maximally “a mere\nplatform for struggles in the spirit of liberal ideas that celebrate\nthe neutrality of statehood” (Hellinger, 2008, 279). \nIt remains the case then that Judaism qua Judaism cannot, for\nLeibowitz, present any specific form of political organization, since\npolitical acts cannot themselves be halakhic acts. But as mentioned\nearlier, Leibowitz speaks of “conditions necessary for halakhic\nobservance” (Judaism, 4), essential conditions for\nindividuals to worship God that would include human social and\npolitical organization. Politics is the scaffolding without which\nindividuals would not have the capacity to engage in their individual\n“religious struggles,” and this presumably yields the\nlesser category of “religious significance” to the\npolitical state. Given his intentionalism though, mere political\norganization can have no religious significance in itself for\nLeibowitz; presumably, once again, it could only have such\nsignificance if political action is driven by the intention\nthat the state be an enabling condition for religious worship. And\nwhile many modern liberal states do indeed thus enable religious\nworship, this is certainly not their primary intent, and they could\nnot therefore be seen to have any substantive “religious\nsignificance” to speak of. \nNone of this is to say that religion cannot be relevant to the state\nin any way, even today. Though he does not wish to speak of how\nreligion can serve the state, since this inverts the correct\nhierarchical relationship between the two, religion can nonetheless\nhave a “function” within the state for Leibowitz as a\n“critical friend” that can “check the influence of\npolitical values and … restrain the patriotism and\nnationalistic enthusiasm” (Judaism, 209–210).\nThus “if religion has a function, it is to place man’s\nlimited values in a true perspective” (Judaism,\n210–211). Indeed, the mistaken religious significance that\npeople do impute either to the land or to the state is nothing short\nof scandalous for Leibowitz, both religiously and morally. \nIt seems, therefore, that as time moved on, Leibowitz’s liberal\nand moral leanings prevent him from being willing to engage in what is\nultimately utopian speculation concerning a halakhic vision for the\nstate. The earlier program is a mere pipedream when the state is\ncatering to a nation that has no interest in Jewish observance, and\ncould thus only become a halakhic state through the totalitarian\nimposition of religious observance. Were the entire population\nunanimously in favor of such observance, Leibowitz might once again\ntake up the cause, though given the freedom of thought that could lead\nthat population to then change its mind, this seems unlikely. But\nLeibowitz is unwilling to engage in such idealistic guesswork, which\ngiven his positivistic leanings he dismisses as meaningless, claiming\nfundamentally not to understand how one is to relate seriously to such\nideals (Sihot, 92). The possibility that a state might have\nreligious significance “in principle” is not a discussion\nthat can have any political purchase. Political action simply cannot\nbe religious action. In reality then – and present reality is the\nonly reality he is willing to recognize by this point – Leibowitz\nwishes to keep political questions separate from religion, which in\nthe contemporary state must once again contract itself to the private\nsphere. \nThe views described above have further significant ramifications for\nLeibowitz’s Zionism. Religiously speaking, a physical land\nsimply cannot be holy for Leibowitz: “The idea that a specific\ncountry or location has an intrinsic ‘holiness’ is an\nindubitably idolatrous idea.” (Judaism, 226–227).\nThus, the claim that a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\nproblem cannot be countenanced because the land is holy to Jews is\nabsurd in Leibowitz’s eyes. Moreover, given his hermeneutic of\nScripture, attempts to base the Jewish “right” to the land\non the basis of historical claims in the Torah are just as baseless.\nIndeed, without quite using the term “nonsense on stilts”\nLeibowitz nonetheless evinces a Benthamite scepticism to the notion\nthat any nation has a legal right to a land – “talk\nof rights is pure nonsense. No nation has a right to any land”\n(Judaism, 241). Rights to land for Leibowitz are a matter of\nhistorical consciousness. And the problem for Israel and the\nPalestinians is that both tell a story that stakes a claim on this\nbasis such that “in consequence of centuries of history, members\nof each feel passionately that this is their land”\n(Judaism, 241). \nMoreover, imputing religious significance to the state (as opposed to\nthe land) is no less a form of “idolatry.” It yields\nviolence and injustice in the name of religion that is in truth the\nsheer willingness to commit moral atrocities in the name of the state,\nwhile hiding behind an illusory cloak of religious piety. \nLeibowitz’s moral critique of the actions of the state and the\nIsraeli army, which rose to a new pitch subsequent to the Lebanon War\nof 1982, gives a clear indication of the significance of morality qua\nmorality for Leibowitz in a manner that is entirely consistent with\nthe view discussed earlier that morality must be subordinated to\nreligion and not vice versa. It is precisely because people mistakenly\nimpute religious value to objects or institutions that they commit\nmoral atrocities in the name of religion for Leibowitz. And it is\nprecisely the understanding of the state as a secular\ninstitution that for Leibowitz would prevent such actions, since we\nwill then judge these actions correctly – i.e., morally,\nnot religiously. And by ethical standards, Leibowitz clearly\nbelieves that the act of occupation cannot be justified. Yet again, it\nis the ascription of holiness to profane things, to the natural world\nand our human needs and interests within it, that is at the root of\nall that he decries in religion and that has dire political and moral\nconsequences in the contemporary political sphere. While one might\ndisagree with his political assessment on political grounds, he would\nargue that it is only on such grounds that one can disagree, and that\nis a dispute for a political, not theological forum.","contact.mail":"rynhold@yu.edu","contact.domain":"yu.edu"}]
