He developed the Aristotelian idea of the\nautonomy of each domain of knowledge in a way that could justify\nAristotelian-style natural science and ethics in spite of\ndisagreements with revealed truth. He also made a major contribution\nto the linguistic theory now known as modism.\n\n\n\n\nBoethius of Dacia, in Latin Boethius de Dacia or Boethius Dacus\n(“B. from Denmark / the Dane”) was a master of arts at the\nuniversity of Paris in the early 1270s, and probably already in the\nlate 1260s. Nothing is known about his background except his\nnationality. His Latinized name is likely to have rendered the Danish\nname “Bo”. Some twentieth-century scholars refer to him as\n“Boethius of Sweden”, but this rests on a misunderstanding\nof the evidence, as shown by Jensen (1963). \nAccording to near-contemporary evidence, Boethius was, along with\nSiger of Brabant, one of the main targets of the great condemnation of\nMarch 1277 when bishop Stephen Tempier of Paris issued a list of 219\ntheses the teaching of which he prohibited (Hisette 1977: 11f.).\nModern research has, indeed, confirmed that several items of the list\nreflect passages in works by Boethius (Hisette 1977; Piché\n1999). It is unknown whether Boethius was still alive in 1277; he may\nhave either died or left France some time before, for when in November\n1276, as a prelude to the condemnation, Simon du Val, inquisitor for\nFrance, cited some arts masters to appear before him, Siger was\nincluded, but Boethius was not. A fourteenth-century bibliography of\nworks by Dominican writers (“The Stams Catalogue”)\nincludes Boethius, so it is possible that after his career in the arts\nfaculty he became a friar. \nBoethius is a very independent thinker, and self-consciously so.\nExcept for one unclear reference to Albert the Great, Boethius never\nnames contemporaries or close predecessors, and so far only one source\nof influence has been identified with certainty: Albert the Great.\nHowever, Albert’s influence is only noticeable in the questions\non Meteorology IV (see Fioravanti 1979), and only regards\nmatters of little philosophical importance. Some passages in the\nremaining œuvre may indicate influence from Thomas Aquinas\n(Summa contra gentiles, Summa theologiae), but there is no\nscholarly consensus on this issue. \nIn much of modern historiography Boethius has been labelled\n“Averroist” or “radical” or “heterodox\nAristotelian”, and has shared those labels with Siger of\nBrabant. The “Averroist” label has little to recommend it.\nLike all his contemporaries, Boethius respected and used Averroes, but\nhe did not accord him any special status among authoritative authors\n(cf. Bianchi 2017). In particular, there is no sign that he defended\nthe doctrine of a pan-human material intellect that was considered\nAverroes’ signature theory, and in his treatise on dreams he\nparts company with all known near-contemporaries by totally neglecting\nAverroes’ optimistic views about the prognostic value of dreams.\nThe epithet “heterodox” or “radical\nAristotelian” comes with the tacitly understood counterpart\n“orthodox and moderate like Aquinas”, and thus only makes\nsense from a certain religious point of view. Boethius was very much\nan Aristotelian, but, as was normal at the time, his Aristotelianism\ncontained elements originating in Avicenna and the neo-Platonic\nLiber de causis. Siger and Boethius were contemporaries and\ntaught the same authoritative books, so they inevitably shared some\nstandard assumptions and topics of discussion, but philosophically\nthey were not particularly close to each other. \nBoethius produced question commentaries on Priscian’s\nauthoritative Latin grammar and on several of Aristotle’s works,\nall of them presumably composed in connection with university courses\nand first presented orally to his students. In addition, there are two\nbig sophismata, which are redacted reports of university disputations,\nand at least three opuscula (items\n 20,\n 23, and\n 26\n on the list below) that do not directly reflect university teaching.\nThe majority of his attested works are no longer extant, but what\nremains suffices to reveal some main features of his thought. \nIn the following list an asterisk (*) indicates that the work is still\nextant; an obelus (†) that it is referred to by Boethius\nhimself in one of the extant works, and a paragraph sign (§) that\nit is mentioned in the fourteenth-century “Stams\ncatalogue”. All extant works have been edited in Corpus\nPhilosophorum Danicorum Medii Aevi (“CPhD”), vols.\nIV–VI, VIII–IX, and XIV, Copenhagen 1969–2020. A few\nhave also appeared in earlier editions, which cannot, however, be\ntrusted. \nFrom the neo-Platonic On Causes (Liber de causis)\nBoethius borrowed the term fixio. To be “fixed”\nis to have a place in reality. The First Cause is fixed entirely by\nitself, lower entities (separate substances, material substances,\nmatter, accidents) all need the support of the First Cause, and, as\none descends the hierarchy, increasingly more support from elsewhere.\nThe relation between the First Cause and other beings is also called\nfactio, “making”, but this does not imply\ncreation in the traditional sense; it does, however, mean that\neverything “made” is existentially dependent on the First\nCause and thus fundamentally contingent (Ebbesen 2005, Donati\n2017). \nBoethius may be classified as a moderate realist.  \nEvery being (ens) is either a thing (res) or a mode\nof a thing (modus rei). […] Among things, some are\nnatural, others mathematical, and a third group divine. […]\nEvery mode of a thing is reducible to the thing itself as its cause\nand has been derived from it, for it cannot be a pure figment of the\nintellect. (Quaest. Top., 3–4)  \nBoethius operates with “things” (res) on such a\nhigh level of abstraction that, like Avicennian quiddities or common\nnatures, they are undetermined as to particularity or universality,\nbut have modes or ways of being (modi essendi) either this or\nthat; thus the concrete term album “(something)\nwhite” and the abstract albedo “whiteness”\nsignify the same, though in different ways, reflecting two different\nmodes of being of that “thing” (Ebbesen 1988). On the\nother hand, he is clear that the fundamental furniture of the world\nconsists of particulars, and while believing in essences, he refuses\nto hypostatize them: he rejects the notion that existence\n(esse) is accidental to essence and that an uninstantiated\nuniversal can function as a verifier of a proposition by virtue of\nsome “essential being” (esse essentiale), as some\nof his contemporaries claimed. \nOrdinary things, including humans, are compounds of matter and a form.\nThe human form, the soul, has several functions, but it is not a\ncompound of several forms—one like that of inorganic things, one\nlike that of plants, one like that of irrational animals and, finally,\nan intellect:—it is one and the same formal entity that takes\ncare of the different functions that some of Boethius’\ncontemporaries assigned to semi-independent parts of the whole soul.\nOn this point he agrees with Thomas Aquinas. He also holds that the\nintellect is an eternal substance and can be separated from the body,\nbut, he says, then it ceases to be a form and a soul. Hence, in\nwhichever sense somebody’s intellect continues to exist as a\nsubstance after the person’s death, it would seem that it ceases\nto be human. Boethius does not, in his preserved writings, expand on\nhow to understand the continued existence of the human intellect after\ndeath, but whatever he thought about this matter, his theory can\nhardly have made room for a bodily resurrection of human individuals,\nwhich, by his own lights, was all right (see\n §3.3.2,\n below). That had to be left to faith. (For the questions treated in\nthis paragraph, see in particular Wielockx 2009: 50–55. The\nunity of the human form is strongly defended in the sophisma Omnis\nhomo &c.). \nBoethius is a towering figure among the so-called\n“modists”, the thinkers in whose linguistic theory\nmodus significandi “mode/way of signifying” is a\ncentral concept. On modism and Boethius’ linguistic theory in\ngeneral, the fundamental works are Pinborg 1967, Rosier\n(Rosier-Catach) 1983, and Marmo 1994. Also important is Beuerle\n2010. \nThere is no clear starting date for modism, and it only gradually\ndisappears in the late Middle Ages, but the height of creativity was\nreached in the last third of the thirteenth century. The basic idea is\nsimple: the verb “to run” and the noun “a run”\nsignify the same “thing”, but in different ways. This\ncould be generalized to cover cases like the concrete\n“white” and the abstract “whiteness”, as well\nas other parts of speech than just nouns and verbs: “a\npain” “it hurts” “hurting”\n“painfully” “ouch!” could all be seen as\nhaving a common significate, only signified in different ways.\nSimilarly, the different cases of a noun, or the different tenses or\npersons of a verb could be described as different ways of signifying\n(modi significandi) the same, and in general all grammatical\ncategories could be understood to be based on different modi\nsignificandi. Add to this (a) a series of rules about how two\nwords may be construed with each other in a sentence depending on\nwhich modes of signifying they possess, and (b) the assumption that at\nbottom all languages share the same grammar with the same repertoire\nof modes of signifying, and you have a fairly strong linguistic\ntheory. \nThe claim about the identity of grammar across languages is based on\nthe assumption that (1) all humans conceptualize external reality in\nthe same way, even though they express their concepts in ways that are\nculture dependent (as taught by Aristotle in De\ninterpretatione 1); and (2) that this conceptualization does not\nonly result in core concepts like run, pain but also in an awareness\nof different modifications of the core things underlying the concepts,\ndifferent modi essendi “modes of being”. This\nawareness, in turn, means that we harbor different corresponding\nmodi intelligendi “ways of understanding”, that\nwe can then encode in sound, creating words with different modi\nsignificandi. How this encoding is done, is a matter of\nconvention, as Boethius repeatedly stresses. What one language\nexpresses by means of case endings, e.g., may be lexicalized in\nanother; the difference is only skin-deep (“accidental”),\nhe holds. He may have held that all languages actually have the\nresources for expressing all reality-based modes of signifying; at\nleast he held that all languages hold the potential for so doing. One\nof the consequences of Boethius’ views is that although grammar\nmaps the ways in which words may signify, it does not allow one to\npredict what any actual word in any language means, and whatever some\nword means is irrelevant for its grammatical categorization:\n“chimera” and “nothing” are nouns as truly as\n“horse” and “thing”, for grammar is about\nhow, not what, words signify. Boethius’\nconception of grammar as a science of linguistic structure, not\ncontent, was matched by a similar conception of logic (Ebbesen\n2016). \nSome of Boethius’ contemporaries considered the step from modes\nof being to modes of understanding to be so automatic that they\nclaimed that the two types of mode were fundamentally identical.\nBoethius disagreed. According to him, there is not an exact one-to-one\ncorrespondence between features of external things and their\nreflections in the intellect. The intellect has a certain degree of\nfreedom. It can grasp the same mode of being in two slightly different\nways. Thus the same real property (mode of being) can give rise to the\nmode of understanding that results in the mode of signifying of a\nproper name and to the “intention” (concept) of a\nparticular; and similarly with the mode of signifying of an\nappellative name and the intention of a universal. The intentions, in\nturn, are the basis for “local habitudes” (habitudines\nlocales), i.e., relationships between them, such as that between\nthe particular and the universal, which can be fleshed out in rules\nabout inferences. Thus, in some cases the same feature of reality may\nbe reflected in grammar and in logic, but somewhat differently (more\ndetails in Ebbesen 2016 and Green-Pedersen 1984: 228–30). \nWhile holding that the signification of words reflects our concepts,\nBoethius rejected the time-honoured notion that words signify concepts\ndirectly and things indirectly. In his view, they directly signify\nwhatever the corresponding concepts are concepts of\n(Mora-Márquez 2014, 2015). \nIn what follows “knowledge”, “science” and\n“scientific knowledge” all represent the Latin\nscientia, which fundamentally means the sort of knowledge\nabout things and their causes that finds expression in the theorems of\na particular science. Also, it should be noted that in accordance with\nmedieval practice “proposition” is used indiscriminately\nfor what we now call a proposition and its linguistic counterpart (a\nsentence). \nEvidence for Boethius’ views about scientia is found in\nall of his works. The relation between scientia and faith\n(fides) is a central theme in De aeternitate mundi\nand De summo bono. The present account follows the\ninterpretation of Boethius’ theory presented in Pinborg 1974 and\nEbbesen 2000, 2002, and 2005 (cf. also Donati 2017). For a different\ninterpretation, see Schick 2013. \nBoethius’ theory of scientific knowledge and science is\nfundamentally Aristotelian. Any particular science is an axiomatic\nsystem with its own primitive terms, primitive propositions (axioms,\n“principles” in medieval terminology), and deduced\ntheorems (“conclusions”). All of a science’s\npropositions are universal and necessary, and thus can only be grasped\nby the intellect. Yet, the primitive terms and propositions have their\norigin in sense-perception, and the truth of an affirmative\nproposition of the form “Every S is P”\ndepends on the instantiation in reality of the composition of subject\nand predicate that it signifies, and thus requires that the subject\nterm have at least one individual referent. Several particular\nsciences may form a cluster subordinated to a superior science, whose\nprimitive terms and propositions they may use, but they each add their\nown set of primitives. \nBoethius is keen to stress the autonomy of each branch of science.\n \nNo specialist (artifex) can grant or deny anything except on\nthe basis of the principles of his own science,  \nhe says time and again. This means, for instance, that a grammarian\nqua grammarian must abstract from whatever knowledge he may\nhave about the meaning of particular words. Knowing that\n“donkey” means donkey, and what a donkey is, is none of\nthe grammarian’s business. “Donkey” is a primitive\nterm in zoology, and if the grammarian happens to be also a zoologist,\nhe should be careful not to mix the two sciences he masters. Boethius\neven reprimands the great authority in grammar, Priscian, for\nintroducing non-grammatical considerations into his work (Modi\nsign., 47). \nAristotle’s description of scientific procedure in the\nPosterior Analytics is couched in disputational language, and\nin Boethius’ own age disputations were a very important part of\nuniversity teaching and, indeed, of philosophical research, some of\nthem being genuine debates with several participants, others fictive\nones in the form of quaestiones with the teacher presenting\nboth the arguments pro and con and the solution. In\nBoethius’ trademark formulation of the autonomy of each science,\nthe expression “grant or deny” (concedere vel\nnegare) belongs in the context of a disputation where a\nquestioner puts forward propositions of the form “Is S\nP ?” and a respondent typically answers “I grant\nit” or “I deny it”. Boethius seems to have conceived\nof scientific activity as fundamentally similar to participating in a\ndisputation, and keeping within the limits of a particular science as\nbeing similar to obeying the rules of a particular type of\ndisputation. Hardly by chance, he describes an unusual variant of the\ndisputational exercise called ars obligatoria. In his\nversion, an opponent puts forward a number of propositions to a\nrespondent, who must grant them all, irrespective of their\ntruth-value, rejecting only such as are incompatible with something he\nhas already granted. After some time, the disputation passes to a\nsecond stage, in which the opponent puts forward further propositions,\nbut this time the respondent is allowed and obliged to grant only such\nas follow from what he had granted in stage 1. The opponent’s\njob is to try to force him to contradict himself (Quaest.\nTop., 329–30; cf. Yrjönsuuri 1994, 31–35). This\nexercise imitates the gathering of a tentative set of axioms of a\nscience, followed by a test of the set’s consistency. \nWithin a university disputation, what counted as a “true”\nanswer depended on the rules of the particular sort of disputation. In\na dialectical one, the respondent should only grant a proposition if\nit is probable; in that context, granting an improbable proposition\namounts to speaking untruly (mentiri) even if in reality it\nis as the proposition states (Quaest. Top., 139). The\nanalogous situation within a specific science is granting a\nproposition that is at odds with the principles of the science in\ncase. It is a fundamental principle of (Aristotelian) physics that\nevery movement presupposes a previous movement, hence the claim that\nthere once was a first movement must count as false in physics. \nThis means that even if Christian theology, or “faith”, as\nBoethius usually says, were a science, some of its dogmas could not be\nincorporated in any of the natural sciences. A temporal beginning of\nthe world (creation) cannot, and similarly the notion of a first human\nbeing coming into existence without being generated. Nor do the\nsciences have room for the resurrection of the flesh, for in\nscientific language that means that an individual may perish\n(“be corrupted”) and later return numerically the same,\nand this is not compatible with the Aristotelian science of generation\nand corruption (cf.\n §3.4,\n below). \nAs a matter of fact, faith is not science (knowledge)—fides\nnon est scientia (De aetern., 366)—and no\ncomprehensive science of the divine is possible. Metaphysics might be\na candidate, for all sciences are subordinated to metaphysics, and\nqua metaphysician a philosopher will know that there is a\nFirst Cause (like all of his contemporaries, Boethius held that causal\nchains cannot be infinite). However, knowing that there is a\nFirst Cause does not imply knowing it to a degree that one can capture\nit in a definition that delimits its possible effects and can be used\nas a premise in an Aristotelian demonstration—that would require\nit to have causes through which it could be known. No such knowledge\nis possible, it would amount to knowing the divine will, which is not\naccessible to rational investigation. Hence, as the First Cause is\nfundamentally inscrutable, it is not possible to simply deduce the\naxioms of lower sciences as theorems of metaphysics. \nSciences must be built the Aristotelian way, and their theorems must\nbe accepted as true. We have no alternative. But they are only as true\nas their axioms, which may be imperfect approximations to reality as\nthey are not derived from a total understanding of the First Cause,\nand have a built-in presupposition that the sort of things they\nmention are instantiated in reality (see\n §3.3.3,\n below). \nThe fact that certain religious tenets have no place in the sciences\ndoes not, however, mean that a scientist cannot be a believer. The\nanalysis of the causal system showed that the First Cause may have\ninexplicable effects, and one may believe that any such effects\nclaimed by faith are real, for all their being inexplicable and in\nconflict with science. The information about them that revelation\nprovides must be accepted as brute facts. To the believing scientist\nthe truths of faith are truths unconditionally, scientific truths are\nso only conditionally. But we still need science to make sense of our\nworld. \nAn important test for a thirteenth-century philosopher’s theory\nof truth and knowledge was how well it could handle the sophisma\n“Every man by necessity is an animal” (Omnis homo de\nnecessitate est animal), and in particular how it would evaluate\nthe truth-value of the sophisma in the supposed situation that no man\nexists.\n Item 12\n in the above list of Boethius’ works is one of more than thirty\ntreatments of this sophisma from his century. Two major ones by other\nauthors have been published and commented on (Libera 2002; Libera\n& Gazziero 2008; see also Ebbesen & Pinborg 1970). \nBoethius asks (a) whether  \nis true if  \n(b) whether the destruction of the object of some piece of knowledge\nimplies the destruction of the relevant knowledge, and (c) whether the\ndestruction of the things signified by a term implies that it loses\nits meaning (“falls from its significate” is the\nformulation). Similar discussions occur in several near-contemporary\ntexts, but Boethius’ answers are not standard ones. \nSome of Boethius’ contemporaries rejected the thought-experiment\ninvolved in the sophisma because in an Aristotelian sempiternal world\nthe presupposed state of affairs, Ø, cannot occur, as\nno natural species is ever uninstantiated. Others held that (1) is\ntrue because man can neither be nor be conceived of without animal\nbeing or being conceived of. Many held that the destruction of the\nindividuals of a species would not imply the destruction of their\nessence, and so the essence of man would still be around to be the\nsignificate of “man”, an object of knowledge and the\ntruth-maker of (1). \nBoethius, for his part, held that Ø is a possible state\nof affairs, human beings are contingent beings, and so the necessity\noperator in (1) makes the proposition false in all circumstances, and\nthe argument that man cannot possibly be or be conceived of without\nanimal fails because it is not necessary for man to be or to be\nconceived of at all. Boethius agrees that in a world that does contain\nat least one human, the human essence is the cause of the inherence of\nthe predicate animal in man, and hence of the truth of  \nbut if Ø were to obtain, (1*) would also be false,\nbecause essences presuppose existent carriers. He rejects the claim\nthat “existence is accidental to an essence”\n(essentiae accidit esse); prior to the generation of a human\nbeing its essence was nothing, he says, and after the\nindividual’s destruction it again is nothing. In short: if no\nhuman exists, there is no human essence and no composition in reality\nof man and animal as required for (1*) to be true. He further holds\nthat in a world void of men \nis false, with the consequence that  \nbecomes true, because the truth-maker of a negative proposition is the\nnon-occurrence in reality of the composition signified by the\ncorresponding affirmative. Most of Boethius’ contemporaries\nwould defend (2) with the claim that “No proposition is truer\nthan one in which something is predicated of itself”. \nBoethius’ solution to question (a) makes the status of\nscientific axioms and theorems problematic, because according to\nAristotle they are necessary. Moreover, some axioms regard phenomena\nlike eclipses and rainbows that are not always instantiated even in a\nsempiternal Aristotelian world. \nIn his answer to question (b) Boethius claims that while the object of\nknowledge must be extant in order for us to acquire knowledge about\nit, we need not lose that knowledge if it ceases to exist, only it can\nno longer be knowledge that the object has a certain\npredicate, but knowledge about precisely which causes such a thing\nwill have if it comes into being. As for (c), he similarly holds that\na word does not become meaningless by losing its referents, because it\nis still possible to entertain the corresponding concept. So, we can\nretain a concept of such a thing just as we can keep our\nknowledge of such a thing even when there is no longer such a\nthing. Boethius’ answer to (b) combined with remarks elsewhere\nsuggests that he took causal structures to remain in place in all\ncircumstances and scientific theorems of the form “Every\nS is P” to be necessary in the weak sense that\nif some S exists, and no superior cause\nunaccounted for in the relevant science intervenes, then\nS cannot fail to have the predicate P. \nBoethius’ On the Eternity of the World is not about\neternity in the theological a-temporal sense, but about sempiternity,\nexistence in a time that neither had any beginning nor will have any\nend. The crucial question is “Does the notion of a temporal\nbeginning, a creation, make philosophical sense”. Boethius holds\nthat there is no way to definitely prove or disprove that the world is\n“new”, i.e., that it has come into existence a definite\ntime ago. He refutes arguments purporting to show the actual\nsempiternity of the world, but not arguments adduced to show that such\nsempiternity is possible, while he characterizes traditional\nwould-be proofs of a temporal beginning as invalid\n(“sophistic”). \nThe central piece of the work is a demonstration that no branch of\nphilosophy can prove the “newness” of the world. The\nnatural scientist cannot, because that would require relying on an\nassumption that is not included in the principles of his science and\nwould make them an inconsistent set if included. The natural scientist\ncan explain how something comes into being by some pre-existing matter\nacquiring a form, but that is generation, not creation, and nature\nonly produces new things through generation. Hence, the natural\nscientist can neither, qua natural scientist, assume the\ncreation of the world and the existence of a first man nor the reality\nof the future resurrection; indeed, he must deny all three. To the\nmathematical sciences it simply does not matter whether the world is\nnew or sempiternal. Neither can a metaphysician deliver the desired\nproof. In the first place, the metaphysician cannot demonstrate that\nan effect may be delayed in relation to its sufficient cause; i.e.,\nmetaphysics presupposes the principle “If a sufficient cause is\nposited, so is its effect” (posita causa sufficiente ponitur\neffectus). Second, there is no way a metaphysician may prove that\nthe world is not coeternal with the divine will, for that would\nrequire an insight into the divine will that is not accessible to\nhumans; claiming to have such insight amounts to madness, Boethius\nsays. \nSo, the upshot of the discussion is that when doing natural science\none should stick to Aristotelian principles, but remember that\nqua scientist one is limited to dealing with what is\naccessible to human reason, so that while conceding the necessity of a\nconclusion deduced from natural causes one may still concede that\nthings may be factually different due to the First Cause. \nAt the end of the treatise Boethius lashes out at people like bishop\nTempier, who cannot understand how it is possible to be a Christian\nand a philosopher at the same time:  \nIf someone, whether enjoying a position of dignity or not, cannot\nunderstand such difficult matters, then let him obey the wise man and\nlet him believe in the Christian Law, (Wippel’s trl. [1987: 67])\n \nbut, he adds, “faith is not knowledge/science”. \nLike all his contemporaries, Boethius believed in astral influence,\nand he seems to have believed in the “great year”, i.e.,\nthat every so many years (some said 36,000) all heavenly bodies are\naligned in the same way, meaning that if everything happening on Earth\ndepended on celestial causality, history would be cyclical. Yet, he\npoints out that such a cyclical view of history is unwarranted, for\nthere is at least one independent causal factor that can override the\ncelestial influence: human free will (Quaest. Ph.,\n247–253). The thesis about the great year and the exact\nrepetition of history was condemned in 1277; perhaps bishop\nTempier’s men found it defended by some other master, perhaps\nthey just read Boethius too superficially. \nAristotle in his De divinatione per somnum (“On\nProphesy in Sleep”) rejects the common assumption of his\ncontemporaries that gods may send dreams that inform about future\nevents.Agreement between dream content and a later event is either (1)\ndue to the fact that the dream reflects a bodily affection of the\ndreamer’s such as an incipient fever that stands in a known\ncausal relationship to a later event such as the unfolding of a\ndisease, or (2) because having had the dream makes the dreamer do what\nit suggested, or (3) mere coincidence. In De somniis\n(“On Dreams”) Boethius follows Aristotle in this, and in\nso doing deviates sharply from all known near-contemporary\ncommentators on De divinatione, who—encouraged\nby Averroes, among others—left more room for supernatural\nintervention in dreams or, at the very least, left plenty of room for\ninformation about the future conveyed by celestial influence, a view\nfor which they believed they could find support in Aristotle’s\ntext (Ebbesen, forthcoming). In his treatise Boethius mocks\n“stupid people” who for entirely physiological reasons\ndream of dark persons or white angels and on waking up claim they have\nseen devils or that in a rapture they have seen genuine angels. He\npiously adds that he will not deny that by divine will a devil or an\nangel may appear to someone, but this looks like a subterfuge, and was\ntaken as such by the men behind the 1277 condemnation, which features\nthe proposition “That raptures and visions do not take place\nexcept through nature”. \nBoethius’ lost Quaestiones morales was probably a\nquestion commentary on Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics.\nThere he must have discussed human free will, because elsewhere he\nsays that topic belongs to ethics. But in particular, he is likely to\nhave concentrated on the nature of the supreme good (= happiness), to\nwhich he (later, presumably) dedicated a small treatise. \nDe summo bono (“On the Supreme Good”) is a\npassionate defense of the thesis that the ideal life is that of an\nintellectual, a philosopher, who spends his life in the pursuit of\ntruth. It is a rhetorical masterpiece, containing one of the longest\nperiods in all of Latin literature that keeps the reader in suspense\nfor about two pages. According to Boethius, the supreme good possible\nfor man consists in “knowing the true, doing the good, and\ntaking delight in both”. By concentrating on the quest for\ntruth, the philosopher comes to act in a morally correct way (a)\nbecause of the insight he has gained in what is base and what is\nnoble, (b) because being absorbed in theoretical work and enjoying it\nhe will not be tempted by sensual pleasures, and (c) because, as\nopposed to other activities, theorizing cannot be overdone. So, the\nphilosopher “lives as man was born to live”. \nSpecial attention is paid to the philosopher’s quest for\nknowledge about the First Cause, alias God, but what Boethius claims\nwe can know is actually just that it/he is the cause of the\n“production” of all beings, of their mutual order in the\nchain of being, and of their conservation (cf.\n §3.1,\n above). \nBoethius’ argumentation is primarily based on the Aristotelian\nergon argument: the highest good for a human being is to\ndevelop to the full the capability that is specific to humans, i.e.,\nour rationality or intellect, and there are many echoes of\nNicomachean Ethics X, but his explanation of why the\nphilosopher will act virtuously is not easily compatible with the\nAristotelian insistence that ethics is not a theoretical science and\nthat habituation is central to making people virtuous. \nThe happiness that Boethius is concerned with is entirely\nthis-worldly. A future life is only mentioned once, in an ambiguous\nremark to the effect that the more one manages to obtain the happiness\nthat reason tells us is possible in this life, the closer one is to\nthe happiness that faith makes us expect in a/the life to come. It\ncould mean that virtuous behavior betters one’s chances on\ndoomsday, but it could also just mean that the philosopher’s\nhappy contemplative life is the closest approximation to the bliss of\nthe beatific vision. \nOne of the theses condemned in 1277 is a slightly altered, but\nbasically correct quotation of a passage in De summo bono. It\nsays:  \nThat there is no more excellent state [of life] (status) than\nto dedicate oneself to philosophy.  \nNo reason is given why it is wrong, but the bishop and his men\nprobably thought that a life in holy orders or as a theologian ought\nto be considered a more excellent status. \nIn the 1290s the wealthy scholar Geoffrey of Fontaines personally\nwrote down abridgments of Boethius’ Modi Significandi,\nthe questions on Topics and De anima I–II, as\nwell as the opuscula (see the introductions to the\neditions). \nModi significandi had a considerable diffusion, evidenced by\nsix extant copies from the thirteenth, five from the fourteenth, and\ntwo from the fifteenth century. Strong influence from Boethius has\nbeen detected in the anonymous question commentary on Priscian\nMinor known as Innata est nobis, where he is referred to\nas “a famous man” (Pinborg 1967: 93–4). The\nSumma grammatica of John of Dacia (1280), while more\ndependent on Martin of Dacia’s Modi significandi, also\nowes a considerable debt to Boethius (Pinborg 1967: 87). According to\nPinborg (1967: 91–2), Boethius further left his mark on Michael\nof Marbais’ Summa de modis significandi, but this has\nbeen called in doubt (Kelly 1995: XLV). \nQuestions on the Topics had a fair number of readers for a\nlong time, surviving in eleven manuscripts from the thirteenth to the\nfifteenth centuries plus Geoffrey’s abridgement, and being\nquoted as late as the fifteenth century (Green-Pedersen 1984:\n388–9). \nThe commentaries on Physics, On Generation and Corruption\n(“GC”), Meteorology and De\nanima are only preserved in one manuscript each, and so,\npresumably, had little impact. Those on Physics and\nGC, which are transmitted in the same manuscript, repeatedly\ndeal with controversial matters like the eternity of the world. The\nlast question on GC has been rendered almost entirely\nunreadable by overlining, presumably the owner’s reaction to the\n1277 condemnation, for the title of the question was “Whether\nthe first movement can be perpetual” and from what remains of\nthe question it is clear that Boethius argued that, scientifically\nspeaking, the world cannot be “new”, although according to\nfaith it is so. Other copies of the two works must have existed, but\nfear of being denounced to ecclesiastical authorities may have stopped\nthe production of new ones after the condemnation. \nTraces of Boethius’ lost questions on the Metaphysics\nhave been discovered in an anonymous set of questions that may be from\nthe 1270’s (Fioravanti 2009). Only a handful of manuscripts\ntransmit De aeternitate mundi and the same is true of De\nsomniis, whereas there is a score of text witnesses to De\nsummo bono, whose success was helped by a common misattribution\nto the famous sixth-century Roman Manlius Boethius, and in some\nmanuscripts to Thomas Aquinas. Finally, only one manuscript carries\nthe sophisma Syllogizantem, while Omnis homo\n… is found in two, but in one of them the text has been\nrevised and enlarged by a slightly later scholar. \nThe 1277 condemnation did not make arts masters stop praising the\nphilosopher’s life in the introductory lecture with which they\nhabitually began every question course on an authoritative book, and\nin practice most kept Boethius’ distinction between science and\nfaith, though without his provocative formulations. \nThere is no book-length study of the philosophy of Boethius of Dacia.\nA comprehensive treatment is found in Ebbesen 2002, but, being in\nDanish, it is accessible to rather few. A good short introduction is\nfound in Pinborg 1974; see also Ebbesen 1998: 282–6. The main\nfeatures of his thought are covered in Lanza and Toste 2011 and in\nDonati 2017.
