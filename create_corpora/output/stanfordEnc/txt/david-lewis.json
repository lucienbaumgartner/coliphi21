He made significant contributions to philosophy of \nlanguage, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, decision \ntheory, epistemology, meta-ethics and aesthetics. In most of these \nfields he is essential reading; in many of them he is among the most \nimportant figures of recent decades. And this list leaves out his two\nmost significant contributions.\n\n\n\nIn philosophy of mind, Lewis developed and defended at length a new \nversion of materialism (see the entry on \n physicalism).\n He started by showing how the motivations driving the identity theory\nof mind and \n functionalism\n could be reconciled in his theory of mind. He called this an \nidentity theory, though his theory motivated the position now known as \n analytic functionalism.\n And he developed detailed accounts of mental content (building on \nDavidson's \n interpretationism)\n and phenomenal knowledge (building on Nemirow's \n ability hypothesis)\n that are consistent with his materialism. The synthesis Lewis ended \nup with is one of the central positions in contemporary debates in \nphilosophy of mind.\n\n\n\nBut his largest contributions were in metaphysics. One branch of his\nmetaphysics was his Hume-inspired reductionism about the\nnomological. He developed a position he called “Humean\nsupervenience”, the theory that said that there was nothing to\nreality except the spatio-temporal distribution of local natural\nproperties. And he did this by showing in detail how\n laws, chances,\n counterfactual dependence,\n causation,\n dispositions and colours could be located within this Humean mosaic.\nThe other branch of his metaphysics was his \n modal realism.\n Lewis held that the best theory of modality posited concrete possible\nworlds. A proposition is possible if and only if it is true at one of these \nworlds. Lewis defended this view in his most significant book, On\nthe Plurality of Worlds. Alongside this, Lewis developed a new \naccount of how to think about modal properties of individuals, namely\n counterpart theory,\n and showed how this theory resolved several long-standing puzzles \nabout modal properties.\n\n\n\nAs we've already seen, part of Lewis's significance came from the \nbreadth of subject matter on which he made major \ncontributions. It is hard to think of a philosopher since Hume who \nhas contributed so much to so many fields. And in all of these cases,\nLewis's contributions involved defending, or in many cases \narticulating, a big picture theory of the subject matter, as well as \nan account of how the details worked. Because of all his work on the \ndetails of various subjects, his writings were a font of ideas even \nfor those who didn't agree with the bigger picture. And he was almost\ninvariably clear about which details were relevant only to his \nparticular big picture, and which were relevant to anyone who worked \non the subject. \n\nLewis was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1941, to two academics. He was an \nundergraduate at Swarthmore College. During his undergraduate years, \nhis interest in philosophy was stimulated by a year abroad in Oxford,\nwhere he heard J. L. Austin's final series of lectures, and was \ntutored by Iris Murdoch. He returned to Swarthmore as a philosophy \nmajor, and never looked back. He studied at Harvard for his Ph.D., \nwriting a dissertation under the supervision of W. V. O. Quine that \nbecame his first book, Convention. In 1966 he was hired at \nUCLA, where he worked until 1970, when he moved to Princeton. He \nremained at Princeton until his death in 2001. While at Harvard he \nmet his wife Stephanie. They remained married throughout Lewis's \nlife, jointly attended numerous conferences, and co-authored three \npapers. Lewis visited Australia in 1971, 1975, every year from 1979 \nto 1999, and again shortly before his death in 2001. \n\nLewis was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a \nCorresponding Fellow of the British Academy, and an Honorary Fellow \nof the Australian Academy of the Humanities. He received honorary \ndoctorates from the University of Melbourne, the University of York \nin England, and Cambridge University. His Erdös number was 3. \n\nLewis published four books: Convention (1969), \nCounterfactuals (1973), On the Plurality of Worlds \n(1986) and Parts of Classes (1991). His numerous papers have\nbeen largely collected in five volumes: Philosophical Papers Vol.\nI (1983), Philosophical Papers Vol. II (1986), \nPapers in Philosophical Logic (1998), Papers in \nMetaphysics and Epistemology (1999) and Papers in Social \nPhilosophy (2000). This entry starts with a discussion of \nLewis's first two books, then looks at his contributions to \nphilosophy of mind. Sections 5 and 6 are on his metaphysics, looking \nin turn at Humean Supervenience and modal realism. Section 7 looks \nvery briefly at some of the many works that aren't been covered in \nthe previous five categories. \n\nDavid Lewis's first book was Convention (1969a; note that all\ncitations are to works by David Lewis, unless explicitly stated\notherwise). It was based on his Harvard Ph. D. thesis, and published\nin 1969. The book was an extended argument that language could be\nentirely grounded in convention. There is a simple argument that this\ncould not be so. Conventions are formed by agreement, agreements are\nmade in language, so language must precede convention, not be grounded\nin convention. (In the foreward Quine contributes\nto Convention, Quine appears to express some sympathy for\nthis argument.) Lewis's response is to deny that conventions require\nanything like an agreement. Rather, on his view, conventions are\nregularities in action that solve co-ordination problems. We can\nstumble into such a regularity without ever agreeing to do so. And\nsuch a regularity can persist simply because it is in everyone's best\ninterest that it persist. \n\nLewis viewed conventions as solutions to co-ordination problems\n (see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  convention).\n His thinking about these problems was heavily influenced by Thomas \nSchelling's work on co-operative games in The Strategy of \nConflict (Schelling 1960). Many of the key ideas in Lewis's book\ncome from game theory. \n\nThe simplest cases in which conventions arise are ones where we are \nrepeatedly playing a game that is purely co-operative, i.e. the \npayoffs to each agent are the same, and there are multiple \nequilibria. In such a case, we may well hope for the equilibrium to \npersist. At the very least, we will prefer the persistence of the \nequilibrium to any one person deviating from it. And we will have \nthis preference even if we would prefer, all things considered, to be\nin some other equilibrium state. In such a case, there may well be a \npractice of continuing to play one's part in the equilibrium that has\nbeen reached. This is a regularity in action—it involves making \nmoves in the repeated game. Given that everyone else is following the\nregularity, each agent has a reason to follow the regularity; \notherwise it wouldn't be an equilibrium. But if other agents acted \ndifferently, agents would not be interested in following the \nregularity, since there are alternative equilibria. Because these \nthree conditions are met, Lewis argued that the practice is really a \nconvention, even if there was never any explicit agreement to \ncontinue it. \n\nThe case we started with was restricted in two important ways. First,\nthe case involved games that were perfectly repeated. Second, it \ninvolved games where the payoffs were perfectly symmetric. Lewis's \ntheory of convention involved getting rid of both restrictions. \n\nInstead of focussing on repeated co-ordination problems, Lewis just \nfocussed on repeated situations which collectively constitute a \nco-ordination problem. Lewis does not identify situations with games.\nA repeated situation may come in different ‘versions’, \neach of which is represented by a different game. For example, it may\nbe that the costs of performing some kind of action differ on \ndifferent occasions, so the formal game will be different, but the \ndifferences are small enough that it makes sense to have a common \npractice. And Lewis does not require that there be identity of \ninterests. In Convention he does require that there be large\noverlap of interests, but this requirement does not do much work, and\nis abandoned in later writing. With those requirements weakened, we \nget the following definition of convention. \n\nwhere R′ is some possible regularity in the behaviour \nof members of P in S, such that almost no one in \nalmost any instance of S among members of P could \nconform to both R′ and to R. (Lewis 1969: 78) \n\nThis is clearly a vague definition, with many ‘almost’s \nscattered throughout. But Lewis, characteristically, thought this was\na feature not a bug of the view. Our intuitive notion of a convention\nis vague, and any analysis of it should capture the vagueness. The \nidea that analyses of imprecise folk concepts should be imprecise \nrecurs throughout Lewis's career. \n\nThe notion of ‘common knowledge’ that Lewis is working \nwith here is not the standard modern notion. Lewis does not require \nthat everyone know that everyone know etc., that all of these \nconditions hold. Rather, when Lewis says that it is common knowledge \nthat p, he means that everyone has a reason to believe that \np, and everyone has a reason to believe everyone has a \nreason to believe that p, and everyone has a reason to \nbelieve that everyone has a reason to believe everyone has a reason \nto believe that p, and so on. That people act on these \nreasons, or are known to act on these reasons, to form beliefs is \nunnecessary. And that the beliefs people would get if they acted on \ntheir reasons are true is also not part of the view. Hence it is \nnecessary to specify truth as well as common belief in the \ndefinition. \n\nLewis argues that this definition captures many of our ordinary \nconventions, such as the convention of driving on the right side of \nthe road in the United States, the convention of taking certain \npieces of paper as payments for debts, and, most importantly, the \nconventions governing the use of language. \n\nIn the final chapter of Convention, Lewis gives his theory \nof what it is for a community to speak a language\n (see the section on conventional theories of meaning in the entry on \n convention),\n i.e., for a community to have adopted one language as their language \nby convention. Lewis individuates languages largely by the truth \nconditions they assign to sentences. And his account of truth \nconditions is given in terms of possible worlds. So the truth \ncondition of an indicative sentence is the set of possible worlds in \nwhich it is true. Somewhat more abnormally, Lewis takes the truth \ncondition for an imperative to be the set of possible worlds in which\nthe imperative is obeyed. (The account of language in \nConvention covers many different moods, but we will focus \nhere on the account of indicatives.) \n\nThe focus on truth conditions is not because Lewis thinks truth \nconditions are all that there are to languages. He acknowledges that \nlanguages also have ‘grammars’. A grammar, in Lewis's \nsense, is a lexicon (i.e. a set of elementary constituents, along \nwith their interpretation), a generative component (i.e. rules for \ncombining constituents into larger constituents), and a representing \ncomponent (i.e. rules for verbally expressing constituents). Lewis's \npreferred interpretations are functions from possible worlds to \nextensions. So we can sensibly talk about the meaning of a \nnon-sentential constituent of the language, but these meanings are \nderived from the truth conditions of sentences, rather than \ndetermining the meanings of sentences. That's because, as we'll see, \nwhat the conventions of language establish in the first instance are \ntruth conditions for entire messages, i.e., sentences. \n\nGiven this understanding of what a language is, Lewis goes on to say \nwhat it is for a population to speak a language. One natural approach\nwould be to say that speakers and hearers face a co-ordination \nproblem, and settling on one language to communicate in would be a \nsolution to that problem. When Lewis is analysing signalling, that is\nthe approach he takes. But he doesn't think it will work for language\nin general. The reason is that he takes conventions to be \nregularities in action, and it is hard to say in general what actions\nare taken by hearers. \n\nSo instead Lewis says that a population P speaks a language \nL if and only if there is a convention of speaking truthfully in \nL that persists amongst P. The parties to the \nco-ordination problem (and the convention that solves it) are the \ndifferent people who want to communicate in P. They solve \ntheir problem by speaking truthfully (on the whole) in L. \n\nIt might be wondered whether it could really be a convention to speak\ntruthfully in L. After all, there is no obvious alternative \nto speaking truthfully. As Lewis points out, however, there are many \nnatural alternatives to speaking truthfully in L; we could \nspeak truthfully in L′ instead. The existence of \nalternative languages makes our use of L conventional. And \nthe convention can be established, and persist, without anyone \nagreeing to it. \n\nIn “Languages and Language” (1975b), Lewis makes two \nmajor revisions to the picture presented in Convention. He \nchanges the account of what a convention is, and he changes the \naccount of just what convention must obtain in order for a population\nto speak a language. \n\nThere are two changes to the account of convention. First, Lewis now \nsays that conventions may be regularities in action and belief, \nrather than just in action. Second, he weakens the third condition, \nwhich was approximate sameness of preferences, to the condition that \n(almost) each agent has a reason to conform when they believe others \nconform. The reason in question may be a practical reason, when \nconformity requires action, or an epistemic reason, when convention \nrequires belief. \n\nIn Convention, the conventions that sustained language were\nregularities amongst speakers. As we noted, it would be more natural\nto say that the conventions solved co-ordination problems between\nspeakers of a language and their hearers. That is what the new account\nof what it is for a population to speak a language does. The\npopulation P speaks the language L iff there are\nconventions of truthfulness and trust in L. Speakers are\ntruthful in L if and only if they only utter sentences they\nbelieve are true sentences of L. Hearers are trusting\nin L if and only if they take the sentences they hear to be\n(generally) true sentences of L. \n\nThe old account took linguistic conventions to be grounded in \nco-ordination between speakers generally. We each communicate in \nEnglish because we think we'll be understood that way given everyone \nelse communicates that way, and we want to be understood. In the new \naccount there is still this kind of many-way co-ordination between \nall the speakers of a language, but the most basic kind of \nco-ordination is a two-way co-ordination between individual speakers,\nwho want to be understood, and hearers, who want to understand. This \nseems like a more natural starting point. The new account also makes \nit possible for someone to be part of a population that uses a \nlanguage even if they don't say anything because they don't have \nanything to say. As long as they are trusting in L, they are\npart of the population that conforms to the linguistic regularity. \n\nJohn Hawthorne (1990) argued that Lewis's account cannot explain the \nintuitive meaning of very long sentences. While not accepting all of \nHawthorne's reasons as to why very long sentences are a problem, in \n“Meaning Without Use: Reply to Hawthorne” (1992a) Lewis \nagreed that such sentences pose a problem to his view. To see the \nproblem, let L be the function from each sentence of English\nto its intuitive truth condition, and let L* be the \nrestriction of that function to sentences that aren't very long. \nArguably we do not trust speakers who utter very long sentences to \nhave uttered truths, under the ordinary English interpretation of \ntheir sentences. We think, as Lewis said, that such speakers are \n“trying to win a bet or set a record, or feigning madness or \nraving for real, or doing it to annoy, or filibustering, or making an\nexperiment to test the limits of what it is humanly possible to say \nand mean.” (Lewis 1992a: 108) That means that while there may \nbe a convention of truthfulness and trust in L*, there is no\nconvention of trust in L in its full generality. So the \n“Languages and Language” theory implies that we speak \nL*, not L, which is wrong. \n\nLewis's solution to this puzzle relies on his theory of natural\nproperties, described below in Section 4.6. He argues that some\ngrammars (in the above sense of grammar) are more natural than\nothers. By default, we speak a language with a natural grammar. Since\nL has a natural grammar, and L* doesn't, other \nthings being equal, we should be interpreted as speaking L \nrather than L*. Even if other things are not quite equal, \ni.e. we don't naturally trust speakers of very long sentences, if \nthere is a convention of truthfulness and trust in L in the \nvast majority of verbal interactions, and there is no other language \nwith a natural grammar in which there is a convention of truthfulness\nand truth, then the theory will hold, correctly, that we do speak \nL. \n\nDavid Lewis's second book was Counterfactuals (1973a). \nCounterfactual conditionals were important to Lewis for several \nreasons. Most obviously, they are a distinctive part of natural \nlanguage and it is philosophically interesting to figure out how they\nwork. But counterfactuals would play a large role in Lewis's \nmetaphysics. Many of Lewis's attempted reductions of nomic or mental \nconcepts would be either directly in terms of counterfactuals, or in \nterms of concepts (such as causation) that he in turn defined in \nterms of counterfactuals. And the analysis of counterfactuals, which \nuses possible worlds, would in turn provide motivation for believing \nin possible worlds. We will look at these two metaphysical \nmotivations in more detail in section 4, where we discuss the \nrelationship between counterfactuals and laws, causation and other \nhigh-level concepts, and in section 5, where we discuss the \nmotivations for Lewis's modal metaphysics. \n\nTo the extent that there was a mid-century orthodoxy about \ncounterfactual conditionals, it was given by the proposal in Nelson \nGoodman (1955). Goodman proposed that counterfactual conditionals \nwere a particular variety of strict conditional. To a first \napproximation, If it were the case that p, it would be the \ncase that q (hereafter p □→ q) \nis true just in case Necessarily, either p is false or \nq is true, i.e. □(p ⊃ q).\nGoodman realised that this wouldn't work if the modal\n‘necessarily’ was interpreted unrestrictedly. He first\nsuggested that we needed to restrict attention to those possibilities\nwhere all facts ‘co-tenable’ with p were\ntrue. More formally, if S is the conjunction of all the co-tenable\nfacts, then p □→ q is true if and only\nif □((p ∧ S) ⊃ q). \n\nLewis argued that this could not be the correct set of truth \nconditions for p □→ q in general. His \nargument was that strict conditionals were in a certain sense \nindefeasible. If a strict conditional is true, then adding more \nconjuncts to the antecedent cannot make it false. But intuitively, \nadding conjuncts to the antecedent of a counterfactual can change it \nfrom being true to false. Indeed, intuitively we can have long \nsequences of counterfactuals of ever increasing strength in the \nantecedent, but with the same consequent, that alternate in truth \nvalue. So we can imagine that (3.1) and (3.3) are true, while (3.2) \nand (3.4) are false. \n\n(3.2) If Smith gets the most votes but is disqualified due to \nelectoral fraud, he will be the next mayor. \n\n(3.3) If Smith gets the most votes, but is disqualified due to \nelectoral fraud, then launches a military coup that overtakes the \ncity government, he will be the next mayor. \n\n(3.4) If Smith gets the most votes, but is disqualified due to \nelectoral fraud, then launches a military coup that overtakes the \ncity government, but dies during the coup, he will be the next mayor. \n\nIf we are to regard p □→ q as true if and\nonly if □((p ∧ S) ⊃ q), then the S\nmust vary for different values of p. More seriously, we have\nto say something about how S varies with variation\nin p.  Goodman's own attempts to resolve this problem had\ngenerally been regarded as unsuccessful, for reasons discussed in\nBennett (1984). So a new solution was needed. \n\nThe basic idea behind the alternative analysis was similar to that\nproposed by Robert Stalnaker (1968). Let's say that\nan A-world is simply a possible world where A is\ntrue. Stalnaker had proposed that p □→ q\nwas true just in case the most similar\np-world to the actual world is also a q-world. \nLewis offered a nice graphic way of thinking about this. He proposed \nthat we think of similarity between worlds as a kind of metric, with \nthe worlds arranged in some large-dimensional space, and more similar\nworlds being closer to each other than more dissimilar worlds. Then \nStalnaker's idea is that the closest p-world has to be a \nq-world for p □→ q to be true. \nLewis considered several ways of filling out the details of this \nproposal, three of which will be significant here. \n\nFirst, he rejected Stalnaker's presupposition that there is a most \nsimilar p-world to actuality. He thought there might be many\nworlds which are equally similar to actuality, with no \np-world being more similar. Using the metric analogy\nsuggested above, these worlds all fall on a common\n‘sphere’ of worlds, where the centre of this sphere is the\nactual world. In such a case, Lewis held that p\n□→ q is true if and only if all\nthe p-worlds on this sphere are q-worlds. One\nimmediate consequence of this is that Conditional Excluded Middle,\ni.e., (p □→\nq) ∨ (p □→ ~q) is not a \ntheorem of counterfactual logic for Lewis, as it was for Stalnaker. \n\nSecond, he rejected the idea that there must even be a sphere of\nclosest p-worlds. There might, he thought, be closer and\ncloser p-worlds without limit. He called the assumption that\nthere was a sphere of closest worlds the “Limit\nAssumption”, and noted that we could do without it. The new\ntruth conditions are that p □→ q is true\nat w if and only if there is a p\n∧ q-world closer to w than any p ∧\n¬q-world. \n\nThird, he considered dropping the assumption that w is closer to \nitself than any other world, or even the assumption that w is among \nthe worlds that are closest to it. When we think in terms of \nsimilarity (or indeed of metrics) these assumptions seem perfectly \nnatural, but some philosophers have held that they have bad proof \ntheoretic consequences. Given the truth conditions Lewis adopts, the \nassumption that w is closer to itself than any other world is \nequivalent to the claim that p ∧ q entails \np □→ q, and the assumption that w is \namong the worlds that are closest to it is equivalent to the claim \nthat p □→ q and p entail \nq. The first of these entailments in particular has been \nthought to be implausible. But Lewis ultimately decided to endorse \nit, in large part because of the semantic model he was using. When we\ndon't think about entailments, and instead simply ask ourselves \nwhether any other world could be as similar to w as w is to itself, \nthe answer seems clearly to be no. \n\nAs well as offering these semantic models for counterfactuals, in the\nbook Lewis offers an axiomatisation of the counterfactual logic he prefers\n (see the section on the Logic of Ontic Conditionals in the entry the\n  logic of conditionals),\n as well as axiomatisations for several other logics that make \ndifferent choices about some of the assumptions we've discussed here.\nAnd he has proofs that these axiomatisations are sound and complete \nwith respect to the described semantics. \n\nHe also notes that his preferred counterfactual logic invalidates \nseveral familiar implications involving conditionals. We already \nmentioned that strengthening the antecedent, the implication of \n(p ∧ r) □→ q by p \n□→ q, is invalid on Lewis's theory, and gave some\nnatural language examples that suggest that it should be invalid. \nLewis also shows that contraposition, the implication of ~q \n□→ ~p by p □→ q, and\nconditional syllogism, the implication of p □→ \nr by p □→ q and q \n□→ r, are invalid on his model, and gives \narguments that they should be considered invalid. \n\nIn Counterfactuals, Lewis does not say a lot about \nsimilarity of worlds. He has some short arguments that we can make \nsense of the notion of two worlds being similar. And he notes that on\ndifferent occasions we may wish to use different notions of \nsimilarity, suggesting a kind of context dependency of \ncounterfactuals. But the notion is not spelled out in much more \ndetail. \n\nSome reactions to the book showed that Lewis needed to say more here.\nKit Fine (1975) argued that given what Lewis had said to date, (3.5) \nwould be false, when it should be true. \n\n(‘The button’ in question is the button designed to \nlaunch nuclear missiles.) The reason it would be false is that a \nworld in which the mechanisms of nuclear warfare spontaneously failed\nbut then life went on as usual, would be more similar, all things \nconsidered, to actuality than a world in which the future consisted \nentirely of a post-nuclear apocalypse. \n\nIn “Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow” (1979c), \nLewis responded by saying more about the notion of similarity. In \nparticular, he offered an algorithm for determining similarity in \nstandard contexts. He still held that the particular measure of \nsimilarity in use on an occasion is context-sensitive, so there is no\none true measure of similarity. Nevertheless there is, he thought, a \ndefault measure that we use unless there is a reason to avoid it. \nHere is how Lewis expressed this default measure. \n\nLewis argues that by this measure, worlds in which the mechanisms of \nnuclear warfare spontaneously fail will be less similar to the actual\nworld than the post-nuclear apocalypse. That's because the failure of\nthose mechanisms will either lead to divergence from the actual world\n(if they fail partially) or widespread, diverse violations of law (if\nthey fail completely). In the former case, there's a violation of law\nthat isn't made up for in an increase in how much spatio-temporal \nmatch we get. In the latter case the gain we get in similarity is \nonly an expansion of the spatio-temporal region throughout which \nperfect match of particular fact prevails, but that doesn't help in \ngetting us closer to actuality if we've added a big miracle. So in \nfact the nearest worlds are ones where a nuclear war occurs, and \n(3.5) is true. \n\nOne way to see the effects of Lewis's ordering is to work through its\nimplication for an important class of cases. When the antecedent of a\ncounterfactual is about the occurrence or non-occurrence of a \nparticular event E at time t, the effect of these \nrules is to say that the nearest worlds are the worlds where the \nfollowing claims all hold, with t* being as late as \npossible. \n\nSo we find a point just before t where we can make the \nantecedent true by making a small law violation, and let the laws \ntake over from there. There is something intuitively plausible about \nthis way of viewing counterfactuals; often we do aim to talk about \nwhat would have happened if things had gone on in accordance with the\nlaws, given a starting point slightly different from the one that \nactually obtained. \n\nJonathan Bennett (2003) notes that when the antecedent of a\nconditional is not about a particular event, Lewis's conditions\nprovide the wrong results. For instance, if the antecedent is of the\nform If one of these events had not happened, then Lewis's\nrules say that the nearest world where the antecedent is true is\nalways the world where the most recent such event did not happen. But\nthis does not seem to provide intuitively correct truth conditions for\nsuch conditionals. This need not bother Lewis's larger project.  For\none thing, Lewis was not committed to there being a uniform similarity\nmetric for all counterfactuals. Lewis could say that his default\nmetric was only meant to apply to cases where the antecedent was about\nthe happening or non-happening of a particular event at a particular\ntime, and it wouldn't have seriously undermined his larger\nproject. Indeed, as we'll see in Section 5.2 below, the\ncounterfactuals he was most interested in, and for which these\ncriteria of similarity were devised, did have antecedents concerning\nspecific events. \n\nIn “Reduction of Mind” (1994b), David Lewis separates his\ncontributions to philosophy of mind into two broad categories. The \nfirst category is his reductionist metaphysics. From his first \npublished philosophy paper, “An Argument for the Identity \nTheory” (1966a), Lewis defended a version of the \nmind-brain identity theory (see the entry on the \n identity theory of mind).\n As he makes clear in “Reduction of Mind”, this became an \nimportant part of his global reductionism. We'll look at his \nmetaphysics of mind in sections 4.1–4.3. \n\nThe second category is his interpretationist theory of mental content.\nFollowing Donald Davidson in broad outlines, Lewis held that the\ncontents of a person's mental states are those contents that a radical\ninterpreter would interpret them as having, assuming the interpreter\nwent about their task in the right way. Lewis had some disagreements\nwith Davidson (and others) over the details of interpretationism, but\nwe won't focus on those here. What we will look at are two\ncontributions that are of interest well beyond interpretationism,\nindeed beyond theories of mental content. Lewis held that mental\ncontents are typically properties, not\npropositions. And he held that a theory of mental content \nrequires an inegalitarian theory of properties. We'll look \nat his theory of content in sections 4.4–4.6. \n\nThe logical positivists faced a hard dilemma when trying to make sense\nof science. On the one hand, they thought that all meaningful talk was\nultimately talk about observables. On the other hand, they respected\nscience enough to deny that talk of unobservables was meaningless. The\nsolution was to ‘locate’ the unobservables in the\nobservation language; in other words, to find a way to reduce talk of\nunobservables to talk about observables. \n\nLewis didn't think much of the broader positivist project, but he was\nhappy to take over some of their technical advances in solving this \nlocation problem. Lewis noted that this formal project, the project \nof trying to define theoretical terms in an already understood \nlanguage, was independent of the particular use we make of it. All \nthat really matters is that we have some terms introduced by a new \ntheory, and that the new theory is introduced in a language that is \ngenerally understood. In any such case it is an interesting question \nwhether we can extract the denotation of an introduced term from the \ntheory used to introduce it. \n\nThe term-introducing theory could be a scientific theory, such as the\ntheory that introduces terms like ‘electron’, and the \nlanguage of the theory could be observation language. Or, more \ninterestingly, the term-introducing theory could be folk psychology, \nand the language of the theory could be the language of physics. If \nwe have a tool for deriving the denotations of terms introduced by a \ntheory, and we have a way of treating \n folk psychology as a theory\n (i.e., a conjunction of sentences to which folk wisdom is committed),\nwe can derive the denotations of terms like ‘belief’, \n‘pain’, and so on using this theory. Some of Lewis's \nimportant early work on the metaphysics of mind was concerned with \nsystematising the progress positivists, especially Ramsey and Carnap,\nhad made on just this problem. The procedure is introduced in \n“An Argument for the Identity Theory”, \n“Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications” (1972a) \nand “How to Define Theoretical Terms” (1970c). There are \nimportant later discussions of it in “Reduction of Mind” \nand “Naming the Colours” (1997c), among many others. \n\nIn the simplest case, where we have a theory T that introduces one \nnew name t, Lewis says that t denotes the \nx such that T[x], where T[x] is the \nsentence we get by (a) converting T to a single sentence, perhaps a \nsingle long conjunction, and (b) replacing all occurrences of \nt with the variable x. That is, if there is a \nunique x such that T[x], t denotes it, and\nt is denotationless otherwise. (Note that it isn't \nmeaningless, but it is denotationless.) \n\nThe simplest case is not fully general in a few respects. First, \ntheories often introduce many terms simultaneously, not just one. So \nthe theory might introduce new terms t1, \nt2, …, tn. No problem,\nwe can just quantify over n-tuples, where n is the \nnumber of new terms introduced. So instead of looking at \n∃1x T[x], where \n∃1 means ‘exists a unique’ and \nx is an individual variable, we look at \n∃1x T[x], where x is a variable\nthat ranges over n-tuples, and T[x] is the sentence \nyou get by replacing t1 with the first member of \nx, t2 with the second member of x, \n…, and tn with the nth \nmember of x. Although this is philosophically very important, \nfor simplicity I'll focus here on the case where a single theoretical\nterm is to be introduced. \n\nThe simplest case is not general in another, more important, respect.\nNot all theoretical terms are names, so it isn't obvious that we can \nquantify over them. Lewis's response, at least in the early papers, \nis to say we can always replace them with names that amount \nto the same thing. So if T says that all Fs are Gs,\nand we are interested in the term ‘G’, then we'll rewrite\nT so that it now says Gness is a property of all \nFs. In the early papers, Lewis says that this is a harmless\nrestatement of T, but this isn't correct. Indeed, in later papers such\nas “Void and Object” (2004d) and “Tensing the\nCopula” (2002a) Lewis notes that some predicates don't\ncorrespond to properties or relations. There is no property of being\nnon-self-instantiating, for instance, though we can predicate that of\nmany things. In those cases the rewriting will not be possible. But in\nmany cases, we can rewrite T, and then we can quantify into it. \n\nThe procedure here is often called Ramsification, or\nRamseyfication. (Both spellings have occurred in print. The first is\nin the title of Braddon-Mitchell and Nola (1997), the second in the\ntitle of Melia and Saatsi (2006).) The effect of the procedure is that\nif we had a theory T which was largely expressed in the language O,\nexcept for a few terms t1,\nt2, …, tn, then we end\nup with a theory expressed entirely in the O-language, but which, \nsays Lewis, has much the same content. Moreover, if the converted \ntheory is true, then the T-terms can be defined as the substitutends \nthat make the converted sentence true. This could be used as a way of\neliminating theoretical terms from an observation language, if O is \nthe observation language. Or it could be a way of understanding \ntheoretical terms in terms of natural language, if O is the old \nlanguage we had before the theory was developed. \n\nIn cases where there is a unique x such that T[x], \nLewis says that t denotes that x. What if there are\nmany such x? Lewis's official view in the early papers is \nthat in such a case t does not have a denotation. In \n“Reduction of Mind”, Lewis retracted this, and said that \nin such a case t is indeterminate between the many values. \nIn “Naming the Colours” he partially retracts the \nretraction, and says that t is indeterminate if the \ndifferent values of x are sufficiently similar, and lacks a \ndenotation otherwise. \n\nA more important complication is the case where there is no realiser \nof the theory. Here it is important to distinguish two cases. First, \nthere is the case where the theory is very nearly realised. That is, \na theory that contains enough of the essential features of the \noriginal theory turns out to be true. In that case we still want to \nsay that the theory manages to provide denotations for its new terms.\nSecond, there are cases where the theory is a long way from the \ntruth. The scientific theory of phlogiston, and the folk theory of \nwitchcraft, are examples of this. In this case we want to say that \nthe terms of the theory do not denote. \n\nAs it stands, the formal theory does not have the resources to make \nthis distinction. But this is easy to fix. Just replace the theory T \nwith a theory T*, which is a long disjunction of various important \nconjuncts of T. So if T consisted of three claims, \np1p2 and \np3, and it is close enough to true if two of them\nare true, then T* would be the disjunction (p1 \n∧ p2) ∨ (p1 ∧ \np3) ∨ (p2 ∧ \np3). Lewis endorses this method in \n“Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications” The \ndisjuncts are propositions that are true in states that would count \nas close enough to the world as described by T that T's terms denote.\nNote that in a real-world case, some parts of T will be more \nimportant than others, so we won't be able to just ‘count the \nconjuncts’. Still, we should be able to generate a plausible T*\nfrom T. And the rule in general is that we apply the above strategy \nto T* rather than T to determine the denotation of the terms. \n\nLewis's first, and most important, use of Ramsification was to argue\nfor the mind-brain identity theory, in “An Argument for the\nIdentity Theory”. Lewis claims in this paper that his argument\ndoes not rely on parsimony considerations. The orthodox argument for\nthe identity theory at the time, as in e.g. J. J. C. Smart (1959),\nturned on parsimony. The identity theory and dualism explain the same\ndata, but the dualist explanation involves more ontology than the\nidentity theory explanation. So the identity theory is\npreferable. Lewis says that this abductive step is unnecessary.  (He\neven evinces concern that it is unsound.) Lewis offers instead an\nargument from the causal efficacy of experience. The argument is\nsomething like the following. (I've given the argument that pains are\nphysical, a similar argument can be given for any other kind of\nexperience.) \n\nThe first premise is analytically true; it follows from the way we \ndefine theoretical terms. The second premise is something we learn \nfrom modern physics. (It isn't clear, by the way, that we can avoid \nSmart's parsimony argument if we really want to argue for premise 2.)\nSo the conclusion is contingent, since modern physics is contingent, \nbut it is well-grounded. Indeed, if we change the second premise a \nlittle, drawing on neurology rather than physics, we can draw a \nstronger conclusion, one that Lewis draws in “Psychophysical \nand Theoretical Identifications”. \n\nSo, at least in the second argument, Lewis is defending a kind of \nidentity theory. Pains just are instances of neural states. I'll \nfinish up this survey of Lewis's metaphysics of mind with a look at \ntwo complications to this theory. \n\nPain is defined by its causal role. Central to that role is that we \nare averse to pain, and try to avoid it. But not all of us do. Some \nof us seek out pain. Call them madmen. A good theory of pain should \naccount for the possibility of madmen. \n\nThe simplest way to account for madmen would be to simply identify \npain with a neural state. So Lewis's identity theory is well-placed \nto deal with them. But there is a complication. Not every creature in\nthe universe who is in pain has the same neural states as us. It is \nat least possible that there are creatures in which some silicon \nstate S plays the pain role. That is, the creatures are averse to S, \nthey take S to be an indicator of bodily damage, and so on. Those \ncreatures are in pain whenever they are in state S. Call any such \ncreature a Martian. A simple identification of pain with neural state\nN will stipulate that there couldn't be any Martians. That would be a\nbad stipulation to make. \n\nThe possibility of madmen pushes us away from a simple functional\ndefinition of pain. Some creatures have pains that do not play the\npain role. The possibility of Martians pushes us away from a purely\nneural definition of pains. Some creatures have pains that are not\nlike our neural pain states. Indeed, some of them might have pains\nwithout having any neural states at all. Lewis's way of threading this\nneedle is to say that pains, like all mental states, are defined for\nkinds of creatures. Pains in humans are certain neural states.  They\nare the neural states that (typically, in humans) have the functional\nrole that we associate with pain. In other kinds of creatures pains\nare other states that (typically, in those creatures) play the pain\nrole. The details of these views are worked out in “Mad Pain and\nMartian Pain” (1980c). \n\nIn a recent Philosophical Review paper, J. Robert G. \nWilliams describes the theory of content that Lewis endorses as \n‘interpretationist’ (Williams 2007). It is a good name. \nIt's a platitude that the content of someone's mental states is the \ninterpretation of those states that a good interpreter would make. If\nit were otherwise, the interpreter wouldn't be good. What's \ndistinctive about interpretationism is the direction of explanatory \npriority. What makes a person's states have the content they do is \nthat a good interpreter would interpret them that way. This is the \ncore of Lewis's theory of mental content. \n\nPut this broadly, Lewis's position is obviously indebted to Donald\nDavidson's work, and Lewis frequently acknowledges the debt. But Lewis\ndiffers from Davidson in several respects. I'll briefly mention four\nof them here, then look at two substantial changes in the next two\nsections. (The primary sources for the discussion in this section are\n“Radical Interpretation” (1974c) and especially its\nappendices in Philosophical Papers: Volume I (1983a), and\n“Reduction of Mind”.) \n\nFirst, Lewis does not think that part of being a good interpreter is \nthat we interpret the subject so that as many of their beliefs as \npossible come out true. Rather, he thinks we should interpret someone\nso that as many of their beliefs as possible come out rational. If \nthe subject is surrounded by misleading evidence, we should interpret\nher as having false beliefs rather than lucky guesses. \n\nSecond, Lewis does not give a particularly special place to the \nsubject's verbal behaviour in interpreting them. In particular, we \ndon't try to (radically) interpret the subject's language and then \nuse that to interpret their mind. Rather, Lewis follows \nGrice (among others) in taking mental content to be metaphysically primary,\nand linguistic content to be determined by mental states (see the\nsection on meaning in the entry on \n Grice). \n\nThird, Lewis believes in \n narrow content.\n Indeed, there is a sense in which he thinks narrow content is \nprimary. He disagrees with Davidson, and several others, when he \nholds that \n Swampman\n has contentful states. And he thinks that we share many beliefs (most\nclearly metalinguistic beliefs) with denizens of \n Twin Earth.\n  \n\nFinally, Lewis's theory of mental content, like his theory of mind in\ngeneral, is anti-individualistic. What matters is the functional role\nthat a state typically has in creatures of a certain kind, not what\nrole it has in this creature. So there might be a madman who does not\nattempt to get what they desire. A pure functionalist may say that\nsuch a person has no desires, since desires, by definition, are states\nthat agents attempt to satisfy. Lewis says that as long as this state\ntypically leads to satisfaction-attempts in creatures of this kind, it\nis a desire. Indeed, if it typically leads to attempts to\nget X, it is a desire for X, even if little about\nthe role the state plays in this agent would suggest it is a desire\nfor X. \n\nSome of our beliefs and desires are about specific individuals. I\nmight, for instance, believe that BW is a crook and desire that he be\npunished. Some of our beliefs and desires are self-directed. I might,\nfor instance, believe that I am not a crook and desire that I not be\npunished. If I know that I am BW, then I should not have all of those\nbeliefs and desires. But I might be ignorant of this. In some\ncircumstances (e.g., amnesia, or receiving deceptive information about\nyour identity) it is no sign of irrationality to not know who you\nare. And if you don't know you are X, you may ascribe\ndifferent properties to yourself and to X. \n\nLewis's way of handling this problem was exceedingly simple. His \noriginal version of interpretationism had it that belief-states were \nultimately probability distributions over possible worlds, and \ndesire-states were ultimately utility functions, again defined over \npossible worlds. In “Attitude De Dicto and De \nSe” (1979b), he argued that this isn't correct. Beliefs \nand desires are, at the end of the day, probability and utility \nfunctions. (Or at least they are approximations to those functions.) \nBut they are not defined over possible worlds. Rather, they are \ndefined over possible individuals. \n\nWhat that means for belief and desire is easiest to express using the\nlanguage of possible worlds. The standard view is that propositions \nare (or at least determine) sets of possible worlds, and that the \ncontent of a belief is a proposition. To believe something then is to\nlocate yourself within a class of possible worlds; to believe that \nyou inhabit one of the worlds at which the proposition is true. \nLewis's view is that properties are (or at least determine) sets of \npossible individuals, and that the content of a belief is a property.\nTo believe something then is to locate yourself within a class of \npossible individuals; to believe that you are one of the individuals \nwith the property. More simply, beliefs are the self-ascriptions of \nproperties. \n\nWithin this framework, it is easy to resolve the puzzles we addressed\nat the top of the section. If I believe that BW is a crook, I\nself-ascribe the property of inhabiting a world in which BW is a\ncrook. (On Lewis's theory, beliefs that are not explicitly\nself-locating will be beliefs about which world one is in.) If I\nbelieve I am not a crook, I self-ascribe the property of not being a\ncrook. Since there are possible individuals who are (a) not crooks but\n(b) in worlds where BW is a crook, this is a consistent\nself-ascription. Indeed, I may even have strong evidence that I have\nboth of these properties. So there is no threat of inconsistency, or\neven irrationality here. \n\nLewis's suggestion about how to think of self-locating mental states \nhas recently been very influential in a variety of areas. Adam Elga \n(2001, 2004) has extensively investigated the consequences of Lewis's\napproach for decision theory. Andy Egan (2007) has developed a novel \nform of semantic relativism using Lewis's approach as a model. Daniel\nNolan (2007) has recently argued that Lewis's approach is less \nplausible for desire than for belief, and Robert Stalnaker (2008) \nargues that the view makes the wrong judgments about sameness and \ndifference of belief across agents and times. \n\nOne classic problem for interpretationism is that our dispositions \nmassively underdetermine contents. I believe that (healthy) grass is \ngreen. But for some interpretations of \n ‘grue’,\n ascribing to me the belief that grass is grue will fit my \ndispositions just as well. As Lewis points out towards the end of \n“New Work For a Theory of Universals” (1983e), if we are \nallowed to change the interpretations of my beliefs and desires at \nthe same time, the fit can be made even better. This looks like a \nproblem for interpretationism. \n\nThe problem is of course quite familiar. In different guises it is \n Goodman's grue/green problem,\n Kripkenstein's plus/quus problem, Quine's \n gavagai\n problem, and \n Putnam's puzzle \n of the brain in a vat with true beliefs\n (Goodman 1955, Wittgenstein 1953, Kripke 1982, Quine 1960, Putnam \n1981). One way or another it has to be solved. \n\nLewis's solution turns on a metaphysical posit. Some properties, he\nsays, are more natural than others. The natural properties\nare those that, to use an ancient phrase, carve nature at the joints.\nThey make for objective resemblance amongst the objects that have\nthem, and objective dissimilarity between things that have them and\nthose that lack them. The natural properties, but not in general the\nunnatural properties, are relevant to the causal powers of things.\nAlthough science is in the business of discovering which natural\nproperties are instantiated, when Lewis talks about natural properties\nhe doesn't mean properties given a special role by nature.  It is not\na contingent matter which properties are natural, because it isn't a\ncontingent matter which properties make for objective similarity. \n\nSome properties are perfectly natural. Other properties are less \nnatural, but not all unnatural properties are alike. Green things are\na diverse and heterogeneous bunch, but they are more alike than the \ngrue things are. And the grue things are more alike than some other \neven more disjunctive bunches. So as well as positing perfectly \nnatural properties, Lewis posits a relation of more and less natural \non properties. He suggests that we just need to take the perfectly \nnatural as primitive, and we can define the naturalness of other \nproperties in terms of it. The idea is that the naturalness of a \nproperty is a function of the complexity of that property's \ndefinition in terms of perfectly natural properties. It isn't at all \nobvious that this suggestion will capture the intuitive idea, and \nLewis does not defend it at any length. \n\nNatural properties will play a major role for Lewis. We've already \nseen one place where it turns out they are needed; namely, in saying \nwhat it is for two worlds to have an ‘exact match’ of \nspatiotemporal regions. What Lewis means by that is that the regions \nare intrinsic duplicates. And the way he analyses intrinsic \nduplication in (1983e) is that two things are duplicates if they have\nthe same intrinsic properties. We will see many other uses of natural\nproperties as we go along, particularly in the discussion of Humean \nsupervenience in section 5. \n\nBut as Lewis (1983e) makes clear, natural properties play many more\nroles in his larger philosophy, including in the theory of\nrationality, the theory of mental content, the theory of linguistic\ncontent, and the theory of laws. It is rational to have a belief with\na more natural rather than a less natural content. If two different\nassignments of beliefs and desires would make equally good sense of an\nagent's dispositions, the more natural assignment is the correct\none. If two different interpretations of the words of a public\nlanguage would make equally good sense of speakers' practices, the\nmore natural interpretation is the correct one. And laws are simple\ngeneralisations, where simplicity is defined in part in terms of\nnaturalness. There is some scholarly dispute about the relationship between the\nfour theses set out in the last four sentences of the preceding\nparagraph. Williams (2007) argues that the thesis about laws is\nexplanatorily prior to some of the theses about rationality and\ncontent. Sider (2001) argues that the third thesis is a standalone\npart of Lewis's theory. Schwarz (2014), however, argues that it isn't\neven a part of Lewis's theory. Weatherson (2003) endorses Sider's\nview, but later Weatherson (2013) endorses Schwarz's critique of\nSider's interpretation, while arguing that a qualified version of the\nthird thesis can nevertheless be derived from the first two. (A\nversion of Schwarz's paper had been in circulation since 2006, so it\nwell precedes Weatherson's 2013 paper, despite the slightly later\npublication date.) \n\nThis topic, natural properties, was one of very few topics where \nLewis had a serious change of view over the course of his career. Of \ncourse, Lewis changed the details of many of his views, in response \nto criticism and further thought. But the idea that some properties \ncould be natural, could make for objective similarity, in ways that \nmost sets of possibilia do not, is notably absent from his writings \nbefore “New Work”. Indeed, as late as \n“Individuation by Acquaintance and by Stipulation” \n(1983c), he was rather dismissive of the idea. But natural properties\ncame to play central roles in his metaphysics and, as we see here, \nhis theory of mind. As Lewis notes in “New Work”, much of\nthe impetus for his change of view came from discussions with D. M. \nArmstrong, and from the arguments in favour of universals that \nArmstrong presented in his (1978). \n\nMany of David Lewis's papers in metaphysics were devoted to setting \nout, and defending, a doctrine he called “Humean \nSupervenience”. Here is Lewis's succinct statement of the view. \n\nThe doctrine can be factored into two distinct theses. The first is \nthe thesis that, in John Bigelow's words, “truth supervenes on \nbeing”. That is, all the truths about a world \n supervene\n on the distribution of perfectly natural properties and relations in \nthat world. The second is the thesis that the perfectly natural \nproperties and relations in this world are \n intrinsic properties\n of point-sized objects, and spatiotemporal relations. Lewis held that\nthe first of these was necessary and a priori. (See, for instance, \n“Parts of Classes” (1991a), “Reduction of \nMind”, “Truthmaking and Difference-making” \n(2001d).) The second is contingently true if true at all. Indeed, \nmodern physics suggests that it is not true (Maudlin 2007: Ch. 2). \nLewis was aware of this. His aim in defending Humean supervenience \nwas to defend, as he put it, its “tenability” (1986a: \nxi). We will return at the end of this section to the question of why\nhe might have wanted to do this. For now, we will focus on how he \nwent about this project. \n\nThe primary challenge to Humean supervenience comes from those who \nhold that providing a subvenient basis for all the truths of this \nworld requires more than intrinsic properties of point-sized objects \nand spatiotemporal relations. Some of these challenges come from \ntheorists who think best physics will need non-spatiotemporal \nrelations in order to explain \n Bell's Theorem.\n But more commonly it comes from those who think that grounding the \nmodal, the nomic or the mental requires adding properties and \nrelations to any Humean mosaic constructed from properties found in \nfundamental physics. (I'm using ‘mental’ here to cover \nall the properties that Lewis considered mental, broadly construed. \nThis includes contents, since Lewis thought content was grounded in \nmental content, and value, since he thought values were grounded in \nidealised desires. So it's a fairly broad category, and there is a \nlot that isn't obviously reducible to fundamental physics. As we'll \nsee, Lewis attempts to reduce it all step-by-step.) \n\nWe've discussed in the previous section how Lewis aimed to reduce the\nmental to the nomic. (Or at least much of it; we'll return to the \nquestion of value in section 7.5.) We'll discuss in the next section \nhis distinctive modal metaphysics. In this section we'll look at how \nhe attempted to locate the nomic in the Humean mosaic. Lewis's aim \nwas to show that nomic properties and relations could be located in \nthe Humean mosaic by locating them as precisely and as explicitly as \nhe could. So the location project revealed a lot about these nomic \nfeatures. We'll spend the next two subsections looking at the two \nimportant parts of this project. Notably, they are two parts where \nLewis refined his views several times on the details of the location. \n\nLewis's reductionist project starts with \n laws of nature.\n Building on some scattered remarks by Ramsey and Mill, Lewis proposed\na version of the ‘best-system’ theory of laws of nature. \nThere is no paper devoted to this view, but it is discussed in \nsection 3.3 of Counterfactuals, in “New Work For a \nTheory of Universals”, extensively in Postscript C to the \nreprint of “A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance” \nin (1986b), and in “Humean Supervenience Debugged” \n(1994a). \n\nThe simple version of the theory is that the laws are the winners of \na ‘competition’ among all collections of truths. Some \ntruths are simple, e.g. the truth that this table is brown. Some \ntruths are strong; they tell us a lot about the world. For example, \nthe conjunction of every truth in this Encyclopedia rules out a large\nchunk of modal space. Typically, these are exclusive categories; \nsimple truths are not strong, and strong truths are not simple. But \nthere are some exceptions. The truth that any two objects are \nattracted to one another, with a force proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them,\nis relatively simple, but also quite strong in that it tells us a lot\nabout the forces between many distinct objects. The laws, says Lewis,\nare these simple but strong truths. \n\nTwo qualifications are needed before we get to Lewis's 1973 view of \nlaws. It is collections of truths, not individual truths, that are \nmeasured and compared for simplicity and strength. And it is not \nevery truth in the winning collection (or best system), but only the \ngeneralisations within it, that are laws. So even if the best system \nincludes particular facts about the Big Bang or its immediate \naftermath, e.g. that the early universe was a low entropy state, \nthose facts are not laws on Lewis's view. \n\nIn “New Work For a Theory of Universals”, Lewis notes \nanother restriction that is needed. If we measure the simplicity of \nsome truths by the length of their statement in an arbitrarily chosen\nlanguage, then any truth at all can be made simple. Let Fx \nbe true if and only if x is in a world where every truth in this \nEncyclopedia is true. Then Everything is F is simply \nstateable in a language containing F, and is presumably \nstrong. So Everything is F will be a law. But this kind of \nconstruction would clearly trivialise the theory of laws. Lewis's \nsolution is to say that we measure the simplicity of a claim by how \neasily stateable it is in a language where all predicates denote \nperfectly natural properties. He notes that this move \nrequires that the natural properties are specified prior to \nspecifying the laws, which means that we can't reductively specify \nnaturalness in terms of laws. (In any case, since Lewis holds that \nlaws are contingent (1986a: 91) but which properties are natural is \nnot contingent (1986a: 60n), this approach would not be open to \nLewis.) \n\nIn “Humean Supervenience Debugged”, Lewis notes how to \nextend this theory to indeterministic worlds. Some laws don't say \nwhat will happen, but what will have a chance of happening. If the \nchances of events could be determined antecedently to the laws being \ndetermined, we could let facts about chances be treated more or less \nlike any other fact for the purposes of our \n‘competition’. But, as we'll see, Lewis doesn't think the\nprospects for doing this are very promising. So instead he aims to \nreduce laws and chances simultaneously to distributions of \nproperties. \n\nInstead of ranking collections of truths by two measures, strength \nand simplicity, we will rank them by three, strength, simplicity and \nfit. A collection of truths that entails that what does happen has \n(at earlier times) a higher chance of happening has better fit than a\ncollection that entails that what happens had a lower chance of \nhappening. The laws are those generalisations in the collection of \ntruths that do the best by these three measures of strength, \nsimplicity and fit. The collection will entail various \n‘history-to-chance’ conditionals. These are conditionals \nof the form If Ht then Pt(A) = x, \nwhere Ht is a proposition about the history of \nthe world to t, and Pt is the function \nfrom propositions to their chance at t. The chance of \nA at t in w is x if and only if\nthere is some such conditional If Ht then\nPt(A) = x, where Ht is the history\nof w to\nt. \n\nThe position that I've sketched here is the position that Lewis says \nthat he originally was drawn towards in 1975, and that he endorsed in\nprint in 1994. (The dates are from his own description of the \nevolution of his views in (1994a).) But in between, in both (1980a) \nand Postscript C to its reprinting in (1986b), he rejected this \nposition because he thought it conflicted with a non-negotiable \nconceptual truth about chance. This truth was what he called the \n“Principal Principle”. \n\nThe Principal Principle says that a rational agent conforms their \ncredences to the chances. More precisely, it says the following is \ntrue. Assume we have a number x, proposition A, time t,\nrational agent whose evidence is entirely about times up to and including \nt, and a proposition E that (a) is about times \nup to and including t and (b) entails that the chance of \nA at t is x. In any such case, \nthe agent's credence in A given E is x. \n\nAn agent who knows what happens after t need not be guided \nby chances at t. If I've seen the coin land heads, that its \nchance of landing heads was 0.5 at some earlier time is no reason to \nhave my credence in heads be 0.5. Conversely, if all I know is that \nthe chance is 0.5, that's no reason for my conditional credence in \nheads to be 0.5 conditional on anything at all. Conditional on it \nlanding heads, my credence in heads is 1, for instance. But given \nthese two restrictions, the Principal Principle seems like a good \nconstraint. Lewis calls evidence about times after t \n‘inadmissible’, which lets us give a slightly more \nconcise summary of what the Principal Principle says. For agents with\nno inadmissible evidence, the rational credence in A, \nconditional on the chance of A being x, combined \nwith any admissible evidence, is x. \n\nThe problem Lewis faced in the 1980s papers is that the best systems \naccount of chance makes the Principal Principle either useless or \nfalse. Here is a somewhat stylised example. (I make no claims about \nthe physical plausibility of this setup; more plausible examples \nwould be more complicated, but would make much the same point.) Let \nt be some time before any particle has decayed. Let \nA be the proposition that every radioactive particle will \ndecay before it reaches its actual half-life. At t, \nA has a positive chance of occurring. Indeed, its chance is \n1 in 2n, where n is the number of \nradioactive particles in the world. (Assume, again for the sake of \nour stylised example, that n is finite.) But if A \noccurred, the best system of the world would be different from how it\nactually is. It would improve fit, for instance, to say that the \nchance of decay within the actual half-life would be 1. So someone \nwho knows that the chance of A is 1 in \n2n knows that A won't happen. \n\nLewis called A an ‘undermining’ future; it has a\nchance of happening, but if it happens the chances are different. The\nproblem with underminers is that they conflict with the Principal \nPrinciple. Someone who knows the chance of A should, by the \nPrincipal Principle, have credence 1 in 2n that \nA will happen. But given the chance of A, it is \npossible to deduce ~A, and hence have credence  in \nA. This looks like an inconsistency, so like any principle \nthat implies a contradiction, the Principal Principle must be false. \nThe most obvious way out is to say that information about the chance \nof A is inadmissible, since it reveals something about the \nfuture, namely that A doesn't occur. But to say that chances\nare inadmissible is to make the Principal Principle useless. So given\nthe best systems theory of laws and chances, the Principal Principle \nis either false or useless. Since the Principal Principle is neither \nfalse nor useless, Lewis concluded in these 1980s papers that the \nbest systems theory of laws and chances was false. \n\nThe problem with this was that it wasn't clear what could replace the\nbest systems theory. Lewis floated two approaches in the postscripts \nto the reprinting of (1980a), one based on primitive chances, and the\nother based on history-to-chance conditionals being necessary. But \nneither seemed metaphysically plausible, and although each was \nconsistent with the Principal Principle, they made it either \nmysterious (in the first case) or implausible (in the second). A \nbetter response, as set out in “Humean Supervenience \nDebugged”, was to qualify the Principal Principle. Lewis said \nthat what was really true was the “New Principle”. His \nproposal was based on ideas developed by Ned Hall (1994) and Michael \nThau (1994). \n\nWe'll explain the New Principle by starting with a special case of \nthe old Principle. Let T be the ‘theory of \nchance’ for the world, the conjunction of all history-to-chance\nconditionals. And let H be the history of the world to \nt. Assuming T is admissible, the old Principal \nPrinciple says that the credence in A given H ∧ \nT should be the chance of A at t. The New \nPrinciple says that the credence in A given H ∧ \nT should be the chance of A given T at \nt. That is, where C is the agent's credence \nfunction, and P is the chance function, and the agent has no\ninadmissible evidence, it should be that C(A | \nH ∧ T) = P(A | T). This \ncompares to the old principle, which held that C(A \n| H ∧ T) = P(A). \n\nThat's the special case of the New Principle for an agent with no\ninadmissible evidence. The general case follows from this special\ncase. In general, assuming the agent has no inadmissible evidence, the\nrational credence in A given E is the expected\nvalue, given E, of the chance of A given H\n∧ T. That is, where C is the agent's credence\nfunction, and P is the chance function, it should be the sum\nacross all possible combinations of H and T of\nC(H ∧ T | E)P(A | \nH ∧ T). \n\nThe New Principle is, Lewis argues, consistent with the best systems \ntheory of laws and chances. Lewis had originally thought that any \nspecification of chance had to be consistent with the Principal \nPrinciple. But in later works he argued that the New Principle was a \nclose enough approximation to the Principal Principle that a theory \nof chances consistent with it was close enough to our pre-theoretic \nnotion of chance to deserve the name. So he could, and did, happily \nendorse the best systems theory of laws and chance. \n\nIn “Causation” (1973b), Lewis put forward an analysis of \n causation in terms of counterfactual dependence.\n The idea was that event B was counterfactually dependent on\nevent A if and only if the counterfactual Had A not\noccurred, B would not have occurred was true. Then\nevent C causes event E if and only if there is a\nchain C, D1,\n…, Dn, E such that each member in\nthe chain (except C) is counterfactually dependent on the\nevent before it. In summary, causation is the ancestral of\ncounterfactual dependence. \n\nThe reasoning about chains helped Lewis sidestep a problem that many\nthought unavoidable for a counterfactual theory of causation, namely\nthe problem of pre-empting causes.  Imagine that Suzy throws a rock,\nthe rock hits a window and the window shatters. Suzy's throw caused\nthe window to shatter. But there is a backup thrower—Billy. Had\nSuzy not thrown, Billy would have thrown another rock and broken the\nwindow. So the window breaking is not counterfactually dependent on\nSuzy's throw. Lewis's solution was to posit an event of the rock\nflying towards the window. Had Suzy not thrown, the rock would not\nhave been flying towards the window. And had the rock not been flying\ntowards the window, the window would have not shattered. Lewis's\nthought here is that it is Suzy's throwing that causes Billy to not\nthrow; once she has thrown Billy is out of the picture and the\nwindow's shattering depends only on what Suzy's rock does. So we avoid\nthis problem of pre-empters. \n\nMuch of the argumentation in “Causation” concerns the \nsuperiority of the counterfactual analysis to deductive-nomological \ntheories. These arguments were so successful that from a contemporary\nperspective they seem somewhat quaint. There are so few supporters of\ndeductive-nomological theories in contemporary metaphysics that a \nmodern paper would not spend nearly so much time on them. \n\nAfter “Causation” the focus, at least of those interested\nin reductive theories, moved to counterfactual theories. And it became\nclear that Lewis had a bit of work left to do. He needed to say more\nabout the details of the notion of counterfactual dependence. He did\nthis in “Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow”\n(1979c), as discussed in section 2. He needed to say more about the\nnature of events. In “Events” (1986g) he said that they\nwere natural properties of regions of space-time. (At this stage he\nassumed that events were the relata of the causal relation. This\nassumption is criticised by L. A. Paul (2000), and in (2004d) Lewis\ndrops it.)  And prodded by Jaegwon Kim (1973), he needed to add\nthat A and B had to be wholly distinct events\nfor B to counterfactually depend on A. The\nalternative would be to say that an event's happening is caused by any\nessential part of the event, which is absurd. \n\nBut the biggest problem concerned what became known as “late \npre-emption”. In the rock throwing example above, we assumed \nthat Billy decided not to throw when he saw Suzy throwing. But we can\nimagine a variant of the case where Billy waits to see whether Suzy's\nrock hits, and only then decides not to throw. In such a case, it is \nthe window's shattering, not anything prior to this, that causes \nBilly not to throw. That means that there is no event between Suzy's \nthrow and the window's shattering on which the shattering is \ncounterfactually dependent. \n\nLewis addressed this issue in “Redundant Causation”, one\nof the six postscripts to the reprinting of “Causation” in\n(1986b). He started by introducing a new concept:\nquasi-dependence. B quasi-depends on A if and only\nif there is a process starting with A*, and ending\nwith B* , and B* counterfactually depends\non A*, and the process from A* to B* is an\nintrinsic duplicate of the process from A to B, and the laws\ngoverning the process from A* to B* (i.e. the laws\nof the world in which\nA* and B* happen) are the same as the laws \ngoverning the process from A to B. In short, \nquasi-dependence is the relation you get if you start with \ndependence, then add all of the duplicates of dependent processes. \nCausation is then the ancestral of quasi-dependence. Although the \nwindow's shattering does not depend on Suzy's throw, it does \nquasi-depend on it. That's because there is a world, with the same \nlaws, with a duplicate of Suzy's throw, but Billy determined not to \nthrow, and in that world the window shatters in just the same way, \nand depends on Suzy's throw. \n\nEventually, Lewis became unsatisfied with the quasi-dependence based \ntheory. In “Causation as Influence” (2000a, 2004a) he set\nout several reasons for being unhappy with it, and a new theory to \nsupersede it. \n\nOne argument against it is that it makes causation intrinsic to the \npair C and E, but some cases, especially cases of \ndouble prevention, show that causation is extrinsic. Double\nprevention occurs when an event, call it C, prevents\nsomething that would have prevented E from\nhappening. Intuitively, these are cases of causation. Indeed, when we\nlook at the details we find that many everyday cases of causation have\nthis pattern. But that C causes E does not depend on\nthe intrinsic natures of C and E. Rather, it depends\non there being some threat to E, a threat that C\nprevents, and the existence of threats is typically extrinsic to\nevents. \n\nAnother argument is that quasi-dependence cannot account for what \ncame to be known as ‘trumping pre-emption’. Lewis \nillustrated this idea with an example from Jonathan Schaffer (2000). \nThe troops are disposed to obey all orders from either the Sergeant \nor the Major. But they give priority to the Major's orders, due to \nthe Major's higher rank. Both the Major and the Sergeant order the \ntroops to advance, and they do advance. Intuitively, it is the Major,\nnot the Sergeant, who caused the advance, since the Major's orders \nhave priority. But the advance does quasi-depend on the Sergeant's \norders, since in a world where the Major doesn't make an order, the \nadvance does depend on the Sergeant. \n\nLewis's alternative theory relied on changing the definition of \ncounterfactual dependence. The theory in “Causation” was \nbased on what he came to call ‘whether-whether’ \ndependence. What's crucial is that whether B \nhappens depends counterfactually on whether A \nhappens. The new theory was based on what we might call \n‘how-how’ dependence. Lewis says that B depends \non A if there are large families of counterfactuals of the \nform If A had happened in this way, then B \nwould have happened in that way, and the ways in which \nB would happen are systematically dependent on the ways in \nwhich A happens. How much A influences B \ndepends on how big this family is, how much variation there is in the\nway B changes, and how systematic the influence of \nA on B is. He then defines causation as the \nancestral of this notion of counterfactual dependence. \n\nOn this new theory, causation is a degree concept, rather than an \n‘all-or-nothing’ concept, since counterfactual dependence\ncomes in degrees. Sometimes Lewis says we properly ignore small \namounts of causation. For instance, the location of nearby parked \ncars influences the smashing of a window by a rock in virtue of small\ngravitational effects of the cars on the flight of the rock. But it's\nvery little influence, and we properly ignore it most of the time. \n\nThere are two other notable features of “Causation as \nInfluence”. It contains Lewis's most comprehensive defence of \nthe transitivity of causation.\n This principle was central to Lewis's theory of causation from the \nearliest days, but had come under sustained attack over the years. \nAnd the paper has a brief attack on non-Humean theories that take \ncausation to be a primitive. Lewis says that these theories can't \nexplain the variety of causal relations that we perceive and can \nthink about. These passages mark an interesting change in what Lewis \ntook to be the primary alternatives to his counterfactuals based \nreductionism. In 1973 the opponents were other kinds of \nreductionists; in 2000 they were the non-reductionists. \n\nGiven these concepts, a number of other concepts fall into place. \n Dispositions\n are reduced to counterfactual dependencies, though as is made clear \nin “Finkish Dispositions” (1997b), the reduction is not \nas simple as it might have seemed. Perception is reduced to \ndispositions and causes. (See, for instance, “Veridical \nHallucination and Prosthetic Vision” (1980d).) We discussed the\nreduction of mental content to dispositions and causes in section 4. \nAnd we discussed the reduction of linguistic content to mental \ncontent in section 1. Values are reduced to mental states in \n“Dispositional Theories of Value” (1989b). \n\nBut we might worry about the very foundation of the project. We\nstarted with the assumption that our subvenient base consists of\nintrinsic properties of point-sized objects and spatiotemporal\nrelations. But Bell's inequality suggests that modern physics\nrequires, as primitive, other relations between objects. (Or it\nrequires intrinsic properties of dispersed objects.) So Humean\nsupervenience fails in this world. \n\nLewis's response is somewhat disarming. Writing in 1986, part of his \nresponse is scepticism about the state of quantum mechanics. (There \nis notably less scepticism in “How Many Lives Has \nSchrödinger's Cat” (2004b).) But the larger part of his \nresponse is to suggest that scientific challenges to Humean \nsupervenience are outside his responsibility. \n\nWe might wonder why Lewis found this such an interesting \nproject. If physics teaches that Humean supervenience is false, why \ncare whether there are also philosophical objections to it? There are\ntwo (related) reasons why we might care. \n\nRecall that we said that Humean supervenience is a conjunction of \nseveral theses. One of these is a thesis about which perfectly \nnatural properties are instantiated in this world, namely local ones.\nThat thesis is threatened by modern physics. But the rest of the \npackage, arguably, is not. In particular, the thesis that all facts \nsupervene on the distribution of perfectly natural properties and \nrelations does not appear to be threatened. (Though see Maudlin \n(2007: Ch. 2) for a dissenting view.) Nor is the thesis that \nperfectly natural properties and relations satisfy a principle of \nrecombination threatened by modern physics. The rough idea of the \nprinciple of recombination is that any distribution of perfectly \nnatural properties is possible. This thesis is Lewis's version of the\nHumean principle that there are no necessary connections between \ndistinct existences, and Lewis is determined to preserve as strong a \nversion of it as he can. \n\nAlthough physics does not seem to challenge these two theses, several\nphilosophers do challenge them on distinctively philosophical \ngrounds. Some of them suggest that the nomic, the intensional, or the\nnormative do not supervene on the distribution of perfectly natural \nproperties. Others suggest that the nomic, \n intentional,\n or normative properties are perfectly natural, and as a consequence \nperfectly natural properties are not freely recombinable. The \nphilosophical arguments in favour of such positions rarely turn on \nthe precise constitution of the Humean's preferred subvenient base. \nIf Lewis can show that such arguments fail in the setting of \nclassical physics, then he'll have refuted all of the arguments \nagainst Humean superveience that don't rely on the details of modern \nphysics. In practice that means he'll have refuted many, though not \nquite all, of the objections to Humean supervenience. \n\nA broader reason for Lewis to care about Humean supervenience comes \nfrom looking at his overall approach to metaphysics. When faced with \nsomething metaphysically problematic, say \n free will,\n there are three broad approaches. Some philosophers will argue that \nfree will can't be located in a scientific world-view, so it should \nbe eliminated. Call these ‘the eliminativists’. Some \nphilosophers will agree that free will can't be located in the \nscientific world-view, so that's a reason to expand our metaphysical \npicture to include free will, perhaps as a new primitive. Call these \n‘the expansionists’. And some philosophers will reject \nthe common assumption of an incompatibility. Instead they will argue \nthat we can have free will without believing in anything that isn't \nin the scientific picture. Call these ‘the \ncompatibilists’. \n\nAs the above quote makes clear, Lewis was a compatibilist about most\nquestions in metaphysics. He certainly was one about free will.\n(“Are We Free to Break the Laws?” (1981a).) And he was a\ncompatibilist about most nomic, intentional and normative concepts.\nThis wasn't because he had a global argument for compatibilism.\nIndeed, he was an eliminativist about religion (“Anselm and\nActuality” (1970a), “Divine Evil” (2007)). And in\nsome sense he was an expansionist about modality. Lewis may have\ncontested this; he thought introducing more worlds did not increase\nthe number of kinds of things in our ontology, because we are already\ncommitted to there being at least one world. As Melia (1992: 192)\npoints out though, the inhabitants of those worlds include all kinds\nof things not found in, or reducible to, fundamental physics. They\ninclude spirits, gods, trolls and every other consistent beast\nimaginable. So at least when it came to what there is, as opposed to\nwhat there actually is, Lewis's ontology was rather expansionist. \n\nFor all that, Lewis's default attitude was to accept that much of our\ncommon-sense thinking about the nomic, the intentional and the \nnormative was correct, and that this was perfectly compatible with \nthis world containing nothing more than is found in science, indeed \nthan is found in fundamental physics. \n\nCompatibilists should solve what Frank Jackson calls ‘the \nlocation problem’ (Jackson 1998). If you think that there are, \nsay, beliefs, and you think that having beliefs in one's metaphysics \ndoesn't commit you to having anything in your ontology beyond \nfundamental physics, then you should, as Jackson puts it, be able to \nlocate beliefs in the world described by fundamental \nphysics. More generally, for whatever you accept, you should be able \nto locate it in the picture of the world you accept. \n\nThis was certainly the methodology that Lewis accepted. And since he \nthought that so much of our common sense worldview was compatible \nwith fundamental physics, he had many versions of the location \nproblem to solve. One way to go about this would be to find exactly \nwhat the correct scientific theory is, and locate all the relevant \nproperties in that picture. But this method has some shortcomings. \nFor one thing, it might mean having to throw out your metaphysical \nwork whenever the scientific theories change. For another, it means \nhaving your metaphysics caught up in debates about the best \nscientific theories, and about their interpretation. So Lewis took a \nsomewhat different approach. \n\nWhat Lewis's defence of Humean supervenience gives us is a recipe for\nlocating the nomic, intentional and normative properties in a \nphysical world. And it is a recipe that uses remarkably few \ningredients; just intrinsic properties of point-sized objects, and \nspatio-temporal relations. It is likely that ideal physics will have \nmore in it than that. For instance, it might have entanglement \nrelations, as are needed to explain Bell's inequality. But it is \nunlikely to have less. And the more there is in fundamental physics, \nthe easier it is to solve the location problem, because the \nwould-be locator has more resources to work with. \n\nThe upshot of all this is that a philosophical defence of Humean \nsupervenience, especially a defence like Lewis's that shows us \nexplicitly how to locate various folk properties in classical \nphysics, is likely to show us how to locate those properties in more \nup-to-date physics. So Lewis's defence of Humean supervenience then \ngeneralises into a defence of the compatibility of large swathes of \nfolk theory with ideal physics. And the defence is consistent with \nthe realist principle that truth supervenes on being, and with the \nHumean denial of necessary connections between distinct existences. \nAnd that, quite clearly, is a philosophically interesting project. \n\nThis entry has been stressing Lewis's many and diverse contributions \nto philosophy. But there is one thesis with which he is associated \nabove all others: modal realism. Lewis held that this world was just \none among many like it. A proposition, p is possibly true if\nand only if p is true in one of these worlds. Relatedly, he \nheld that individuals like you or I (or this computer) only exist in \none possible world. So what it is for a proposition like You are \nhappy to be true in another world is not for you to be happy in \nthat world; you aren't in that world. Rather, it is for your \ncounterpart to be happy in that world. \n\nLewis wrote about modal realism in many places. As early as \nCounterfactuals he wrote this famous passage. \n\nAnd Lewis used counterpart theory throughout his career to resolve \nmetaphysical puzzles in fields stretching from \n personal identity\n (“Counterparts of Persons and Their Bodies” (1971c)) to \n truthmaker theory\n (“Things qua Truthmakers” (2003b)). Indeed, Lewis's \noriginal statement of counterpart theory is in one of his first \npublished metaphysics papers (“Counterpart Theory and \nQuantified Modal Logic” (1968)). \n\nBut the canonical statement and defence of both modal realism and \ncounterpart theory is in On the Plurality of Worlds (1986a),\nthe book that grew out of his 1984 John Locke lectures. This section \nwill follow the structure of that book. \n\nThe little ‘argument by paraphrase’ from \nCounterfactuals is a long way from an argument for Lewis's \nform of modal realism. For one thing, the argument relies on taking a\nfolksy paraphrase as metaphysically revealing; perhaps we would be \nbetter off treating this as just a careless manner of speaking. For \nanother, the folksy paraphrase Lewis uses isn't obviously innocuous; \nlike many other abstraction principles it could be hiding a \ncontradiction. And the argument does little to show that other \npossible worlds are concreta; talking of them as ways things could be\nmakes them sound like properties, which are arguably abstracta if \nthey exist at all. The first three chapters of Plurality \naddress these three issues. The fourth chapter is an extended \ndiscussion of the place of individuals in modal realism. We'll look \nat these chapters in order. \n\nThe short argument from Counterfactuals that I quoted seems \ndeeply unQuinean. Rather than saying that possible worlds exist \nbecause they are quantified over in the best paraphrase of our \ntheories, Lewis says they exist because they are quantified over in \njust one \n paraphrase\n of our theories. To be sure, he says this is a permissible \nparaphrase. On the other hand, there is vanishingly little defence of\nits permissibility. \n\nIn the first chapter of Plurality Lewis takes a much more \nQuinean orthodox line. He argues, at great length, that the best \nversion of many philosophical theories requires quantification over \npossibilities. In traditional terms, he offers an extended \n indispensability argument\n for unactualised possibilities. But traditional terms are perhaps \nmisleading here. Lewis does not say that possibilities are absolutely\nindispensable, only that they make our philosophical theories so much\nbetter that we have sufficient reason to accept them. \n\nThere are four areas in which Lewis thinks that possible worlds earn \ntheir keep. \n\nAfter arguing that we are best off in all these areas of philosophy \nif we accept unactualised possibilities, Lewis spends the rest of \nchapter 1 saying what possible worlds are on his view. He isn't yet \narguing for this way of thinking about possible worlds; that will \ncome in chapter 3. For now he is just describing what he takes to be \nthe best theory of possible worlds. He holds that possible worlds are\nisolated; no part of one is spatio-temporally related to any other \nworld. Indeed, he holds that lack of spatio-temporal relation (or \nsomething like it) is what marks individuals as being in different \nworlds. So his theory has the somewhat odd consequence that there \ncould not have been two parts of the world that aren't \nspatio-temporally connected. He holds that worlds are concrete, \nthough spelling out just what the abstract/concrete distinction comes\nto in this context isn't a trivial task. And he holds that worlds are\nplenitudinous. There is a world for every way things could be. And \nworlds satisfy a principle of recombination: shape and size \npermitting, any number of duplicates of any number of possible things\ncan co-exist or fail to co-exist. \n\nChapter 2 deals with several objections to modal realism. Some of \nthese objections claim that modal realism leads to paradox. Other \nobjections claim that it undermines our ordinary practice. We will \nlook at two examples of each. \n\nPeter Forrest and D. M. Armstrong (1984) argue that modal realism \nleads to problems given the principle of recombination. An \nunrestricted principle of recombination says that for any things that\ncould exist, there is a world in which there is a duplicate of all of\nthem. Forrest and Armstrong apply the principle by taking the things \nto be the different possible worlds. A world containing a duplicate \nof all the worlds would, they show, be bigger than any world. But by \nthe principle it would also be a world. Contradiction. Lewis' reply \nis to deny the unrestricted version of the principle. He insists that\nthere is independent reason to qualify the principle to those things \nwhose size and shape permits them to be fit into a single world. \nWithout an unrestricted principle of recombination, there is no way \nto create the large world that's at the heart of Forrest and \nArmstrong's paradox. \n\nDavid Kaplan argued that there could be no cardinality of the worlds.\nKaplan did not publish this argument, so Lewis replies to the version\npresented by Martin Davies (1981: 262). On Lewis's theory, every set \nof worlds is a proposition. For any proposition, says Kaplan, that \nproposition might be the only proposition being thought by a person \nat location l at time t. So for each proposition, \nthere is a world where it (alone) is thought by a person at location \nl at time t. That means there is a one-one \ncorrespondence between the sets of worlds and a subset of the worlds.\nContradiction. Lewis's reply is to deny that every proposition can be\nthought. He claims that functionalism about belief, plus the \nrequirement that beliefs latch onto relatively natural properties, \nmean that most propositions cannot be thought, and this blocks the \nparadox. \n\nPeter Forrest (1982) argues that modal realism leads to inductive \nscepticism. According to modal realism, there are other thinkers very\nmuch like us who are deceived by their surroundings. Given this, we \nshould doubt our inductive inferences. Lewis's reply is that modal \nrealism does not make inductive challenges any worse than they were \nbefore. It is common ground that inductive inference is fallible. \nThat is, it is common ground that these inferences could fail. \nThinking of the possibilities of failure as concrete individuals \nmight focus the mind on them, and hence make us less confident, but \ndoes not seem to change the inference's justificatory status. Lewis's\nargument seems hard to dispute here. Given the mutually agreed upon \nfact that the inference could fail, it's hard to see what \nepistemological cost is incurred by agreeing that it does fail for \nsomeone kind of like the inferrer in a distant possible world. \n\nRobert Adams (1974) argues that modal realism leads to surprising \nresults in moral philosophy. The modal realist says that the way \nthings are, in the broadest possible sense, is not a contingent \nmatter, since we can't change the nature of the pluriverse. Hence we \ncannot do anything about it. So if moral requirements flow from a \nrequirement to improve the way things are, in this broadest possible \nsense, then there are no moral requirements. Lewis rejects the \nantecedent of this conditional as something that only an extreme \nutilitarian could accept. What is crucial about morality is that \nwe not do evil. Even if their actions won't make a \ndifference to the nature of the pluriverse, a virtuous agent will not\nwant to, for instance, cause suffering. By rejecting the view that in\nour moral deliberations we should care about everyone, possible and \nactual, equally, Lewis avoids the problem. \n\nIn chapter 3 Lewis looks at the alternatives to his kind of modal \nrealism. He takes himself to have established that we need to have \npossible worlds of some kind in our ontology, but not that these \npossible worlds must be concrete. In particular, they can be \nabstract, or what he calls “ersatz” possible worlds. \nLewis does not have a single knock-down argument against all forms of\nersatzism. Instead he divides the space of possible ersatzist \npositions into three, and launches different attacks against \ndifferent ones. \n\nLewis starts with what he calls “linguistic ersatzism”. \nThis is the view that ersatz possible worlds are representations, and\nthe way they represent possibilities is something like the way that \nlanguage represents possibilities. In particular, they represent \npossibilities without resembling possibilities, but instead in virtue\nof structural features of the representation. \n\nHe levels three main objections to linguistic ersatzism. First, it \ntakes modality as a primitive, rather than reducing modality to \nsomething simpler (like concrete possible worlds). Second, it can't \ndistinguish qualitatively similar individuals in other possible \nworlds. Lewis argues that will mean that we can't always quantify \nover possibilia, as we can in his theory. Third, it can't allow as \nfull a range of ‘alien’, i.e. uninstantiated, natural \nproperties as we would like. Sider (2002) has replied that some of \nthese challenges can be met, or at least reduced in intensity, if we \ntake the pluriverse (i.e. the plurality of worlds) to be what is \nrepresented, rather than the individual worlds. \n\nThe second theory he considers is what he calls “pictoral \nersatzism”. This is the view that ersatz possible worlds are \nrepresentations, and the way they represent possibilities is \nsomething like the way that pictures or models represent \npossibilities. That is, they represent by being similar, in a crucial\nrespect, to what they are representing. The pictoral ersatzist, says \nLewis, is caught in something of a bind. If the representations are \nnot detailed enough, they will not give us enough possibilities to do\nthe job that possible worlds need to do. If they are detailed enough \nto do that job, and they represent by resembling possibilities, then \narguably they will contain as much problematic ontology as Lewisian \nconcrete possible worlds. So they have the costs of Lewis's theory \nwithout any obvious advantage. \n\nThe final theory he considers is what he calls “magical \nersatzism”. Unlike the previous two theories, this theory is \ndefined negatively. The magical ersatzist is defined by their denial \nthat possible worlds represent, or at least that they represent in \neither of the two ways (linguistic and pictoral) that we are familiar\nwith. And Lewis's primary complaint is that this kind of theory is \nmysterious, and that it could only seem attractive if it hides from \nview the parts of the theory that are doing the philosophical work. \nLewis argues that as soon as we ask simple questions about the \nrelationship that holds between a possibility and actuality if that \npossibility is actualised, such as whether this is an internal or \nexternal relation, we find the magical ersatzist saying things that \nare either implausible or mysterious. \n\nIt isn't clear just who is a magical ersatzist. Lewis wrote that at \nthe time he wrote Plurality no one explicitly endorsed this \ntheory. This was perhaps unfair to various primitivists \nabout modality, such as Adams (1974), Plantinga (1974) and Stalnaker \n(1976). Given the negative definition of magical ersatzism, and given\nthe fact that primitivists do not think that possible worlds \nrepresent possibilities via any familiar mechanism, it seems the \nprimitivists should count as magical ersatzists, or, as Lewis calls \nthem, “magicians”. In any case, if magical ersatzism, in \nall its varieties, is objectionably mysterious, that suggests \nersatzism is in trouble, and hence if we want the benefits of \npossible worlds, we have to pay for them by accepting concrete \npossible worlds. \n\nThe last chapter of Plurality changes tack somewhat. Instead\nof focussing on different ways the world could be, Lewis's focus \nbecomes different ways things could be. The chapter defends, and \nexpands upon, Lewis's counterpart theory. \n\nCounterpart theory was first introduced by Lewis in “Counterpart\nTheory and Quantified Modal Logic” (1968) as a way of making\nmodal discourse extensional.  Instead of worrying just what a name\ninside the scope of a modal operator might mean, we translate the\nlanguage of quantified modal logic into a language without operators,\nbut with quantifiers over worlds and other non-actual individuals. So\ninstead of saying □Fa, we say\n∀w∀x ((Ww ∧ Ixw\n∧ Cxa) ⊃\nFx). That is, for all w and x, if \nw is a world, and x is in w, and \nx is a counterpart of a, then Fx. Or, more\nintuitively, all of a's counterparts are F. The \npaper shows how we can extend this intuitive idea into a complete \ntranslation from the language of quantfied modal logic to the \nlanguage of counterpart theory. In “Tensions” (1974a) \nLewis retracts the claim that it is an advantage of counterpart \ntheory over quantified modal logic that it is extensional rather than\nintensional, largely because he finds the distinction between these \ntwo notions much more elusive than he had thought. But he still \nthought counterpart theory had a lot of advantages, and these were \npressed in chapter 4. \n\nThe intuitive idea behind counterpart theory was that individuals, at\nleast ordinary individuals of the kind we regularly talk about, are \nworld-bound. That is, they exist in only one world. But they do not \nhave all of their properties essentially. We can truly say of a \nnon-contender, say Malloy, that he could have been a contender. In \nthe language of possible worlds, there is a possible world w\nsuch that, according to it, Malloy is a contender. But what in turn \ndoes this mean? Does it mean that Malloy himself is in w? \nNot really, according to counterpart theory. Rather, a counterpart of\nMalloy's is a contender in w. And Malloy himself has the \nmodal property could have been a contender in virtue of \nhaving a counterpart in w who is a contender. This way of \nthinking about modal properties of individuals has, claims Lewis, a \nnumber of advantages. \n\nFor one thing, it avoids an odd kind of inconsistency. Malloy might \nnot only have been a contender, he might have been 6 inches taller. \nIf we think that is because there is a world in which Malloy himself \nis 6 inches taller, then it seems like we're saying that Malloy can \nhave two heights, his actual height and one 6 inches taller. And that\nlooks inconsistent. The obvious way out of this is to say that he \nbears one height in relation to this world, and another to another \nworld. But that turns height from an intrinsic property into a \nrelation, and that seems like a mistake. Lewis thinks this problem, \nwhat he dubs the ‘problem of accidental intrinsics’, is a\nreason to deny that Malloy himself is in multiple worlds. \n\nFor another, it allows us a kind of inconstancy in our modal\npredications. Could Malloy have been brought by a stork, or must\nhe have had the parents he actually had? In some moods we think one,\nin other moods we think another. Lewis thinks that counterpart theory\ncan reflect our indecision. There is a world with someone brought by a\nstork who has a life much like Malloy's. Is he one of Malloy's\ncounterparts? Well, he is according to some counterpart relations, and\nnot according to others. When one of the former relations is\ncontextually salient, it's true to say that Malloy could have been\nbrought by a stork. When more demanding counterpart relations are\nsalient, he isn't one of Malloy's counterparts, and indeed all of\nMalloy's counterparts share his parents. (More precisely, all of his\ncounterparts have parents who are counterparts of Malloy's actual\nparents.) In those contexts, it is true to say that one's parentage is\nessential. Throughout his career, Lewis uses this inconstancy of the\ncounterpart relation to resolve all manner of metaphysical puzzles,\nfrom puzzles about personal identity (1971c) to puzzles about\ntruthmakers (2003b). The final section of Plurality is Lewis's\nmost extended argument that this variability of the counterpart\nrelation is a strength, not a weakness, of the theory. \n\nLewis wrote a lot that isn't covered by the broad categories we've \ndiscussed so far. The point of this section is to provide a sample of\nthat material. It isn't close to being comprehensive. It doesn't \ninclude his treatment of \n qualia\n in (1988h) and (1995b). It doesn't include his contributions to \n causal decision theory\n in (1979e) and (1981b). It goes very quickly over his many papers in\nethics. And it skips his contributions to debates about non-classical\nlogics, such as (1982c) and (1990). We've tried to restrict attention\nto those areas where Lewis's contributions were groundbreaking,\ninfluential, and set out a new positive theory.  Shockingly, there is\na lot to cover that meets those constraints, and is not included in\nthe above survey of the major themes of his philosophy. \n\nParts of Classes (1991a) and “Mathematics is \nMegethology” (1993d) consider the distinctive philosophical \nproblems raised by \n set theory.\n As Lewis notes, it is widely held that all of mathematics reduces to \nset theory. But there is little consensus about what the metaphysics \nof set theory is. Lewis puts forward two proposals that might, \ncollectively, help to clarify matters. \n\nThe first proposal is what he calls the Main Thesis:\n“The parts of a class are all and only its subclasses”\n(1991a: 7). By ‘class’ here, Lewis does not mean\n‘set’.  Classes are things with members. Some classes are\nproper classes, and hence not sets. And one set, the null set, has no\nmembers, so is not a class. Individuals, for Lewis, are things without\nmembers. Since the null set has no members, it is an individual. But\nthe overlap between the sets and the classes is large; most sets we\nthink about are classes. \n\nThe big payoff of the Main Thesis is that it reduces the mysteries of\nset theory to a single mystery. Any class is a \n fusion of singletons,\n i.e., sets with one member. If we understand what a singleton is, and\nwe understand what fusions are, then we understand all there is to \nknow about classes, and about sets. That's because any set is just \nthe fusion of the singletons of its members. \n\nBut singletons are deeply mysterious. The usual metaphors that are\nused to introduce sets, metaphors about combining or collecting or\ngathering multiple things into one are less than useless when it comes\nto understanding the relationship between a singleton and its\nmember. In (1993d), Lewis settles for a structuralist understanding of\nsingletons. He also says that he “argued (somewhat reluctantly)\nfor a structuralist’ approach to the theory of singleton\nfunctions” in (1991a), though on page 54 of (1991a) he appears\nto offer qualified resistance to structuralism. \n\nOne of the technical advances of (1991a) and (1993d) was that they \nshowed how a structuralist account of set theory was even possible. \nThis part of the work was co-authored with John P. Burgess and A. P. \nHazen. Given a large enough universe (i.e., that the cardinality of \nthe mereological atoms is an \n inaccessible cardinal),\n and given plural quantification, we can say exactly what constraints a\nfunction must satisfy for it to do the work we want the singleton\nfunction to do. (By ‘the singleton function’ I mean the\nfunction that maps anything that has a singleton onto its singleton.\nSince proper classes don't have singletons, and nor do fusions of sets\nand objects, this will be a partial function.) Given that, we can\nunderstand mathematical claims made in terms of sets/classes as\nquantifications over singleton functions. That is, we can understand\nany claim that would previous have used ‘the’ singleton\nfunction as a claim of the form for all s:\n…s…s…, where the terms s\ngo where we would previously have referred to ‘the’\nsingleton function. It is provable that this translation won't\nintroduce any inconsistency into mathematics (since there are values\nfor s), or any indeterminacy (since the embedded sentence\n…s…s… has the same truth value\nfor any eligible value for s). \n\nShould we then adopt this structuralist account, and say that we have\nremoved the mysteries of mathematics? As noted above, Lewis is \nuncharacteristically equivocal on this point, and seemed to change \nhis mind about whether structuralism was, all things considered, a \ngood or a bad deal. His equivocation comes from two sources. One \nworry is that when we work through the details, some of the mysteries\nof set theory seem to have been relocated rather than solved. For \ninstance, if we antecedently understood the singleton function, we \nmight have thought it could be used to explain why the set theoretic \nuniverse is so large. Now we have to simply posit a very large \nuniverse. Another is that the proposal is in some way revisionary, \nsince it takes ordinary mathematical talk to be surreptitiously \nquantificational. Parts of Classes contains some famous \ninvective directed against philosophers who seek to overturn \nestablished science on philosophical grounds. \n\nAnd yet Lewis's positive theory here is somewhat revisionary. It \ndoesn't revise the truth value of any mathematical claim, but it does\nrevise the understanding of them. Is even this too much revision to \nmake on philosophical grounds? Perhaps not, but it is worrying enough\nfor Lewis to conclude merely that the theory he proposes seems better\nthan the alternatives, not that there is a compelling positive case \nfor its truth. \n\nLewis's major contribution to formal semantics was his theory of \ncounterfactual conditionals. But there were several other \ncontributions that he made, both on specific topics in formal \nsemantics, and on the role of semantic theory. \n\nIn “Adverbs of Quantification” (1975a), Lewis notes \nseveral difficulties in translating sentences involving \n“usually”, “frequently”, “rarely”\nor related adverbs into first-order logic or some similar formal \nsystem. Lewis's solution to the puzzles raised involves two formal \nadvances. First, he treats the adverbs as unselective \nquantifiers, binding all free variables in their scope. The \nsecond advance concerns the if-clauses in sentences like Usually,\nif a team plays well, they win. It is difficult for various \nreasons to take the structure of this sentence to involve a \nquantifier over a compound sentence with a conditional connective. \nLewis's second advance is to say that these if-clauses are simply \ndomain restrictors. The ‘if’ is no more a sentential \nconnective than the ‘and’ in New York is between \nBoston and Washington. Instead, the if-clause restricts what \nthings the quantifier denoted by ‘usually’ ranges over. \n\nThis paper is not widely read by philosophers, but it has been very \ninfluential among linguists, especially semanticists. Indeed, its \nuptake by semanticists has made it the fourth most cited paper of \nLewis's on \n Google Scholar.\n His most cited paper on Google Scholar is also in philosophy of \nlanguage; it is “Scorekeeping in a Language Game” \n(1979f). \n\nThat paper is about conversational dynamics. Lewis develops an \nextended analogy between the role of context in a conversation and \nthe role of score in a baseball game. One central role of the score \nis to keep a record of what has already happened. In that way, score \nis influenced by what happens on the field, or in the conversation. \nBut the causal influence runs in the other way as well. Some events \non the field are influenced by the score. You're only out after the \nthird strike, for example. Similarly, Lewis holds that \ncontext (or the conversational score) can influence, or even be \npartially constitutive of, what happens in the conversation. If I say\n“None of the cats are afraid of Barney”, which cats I've \nmanaged to talk about depends on which cats are conversationally \nsalient. And in saying this, I've made Barney salient, so the score \nchanges in that respect. That change matters; now I can denote Barney\nby “he”. \n\nLewis argues that this model can make sense of a number of otherwise \npuzzling features of language. One notable example of this involves \nquantification. Most quantifiers we use do not range over the entire \nuniverse. We quantify only over a restricted range. Lewis says that \nit is the salient objects. He also says that this happens not just \nwhen we explicitly quantify, but also when we use terms that have a \nquantificational analysis. He mentions in passing that \n“knows” might be one such term. \n\nThis idea is developed more fully in “Elusive Knowledge”\n(1996b). Lewis argues that S knows that p is true\niff S is in a position to rule out all possibilities\nin which p is false. But when we say S knows that p,\nwe don't mean to quantify over all possibilities there are, only over\nthe salient possibilities. The big advantage of Lewis's approach is\nthat it lets him explain the appeal of scepticism. When the sceptic\nstarts talking about fantastic possibilities of error, she makes those\npossibilities salient. Since we can't rule them out, when we're\ntalking to the sceptic we can't say we know very much. But since those\npossibilities aren't usually salient, we are usually correct in our\nknowledge-ascriptions. So Lewis lets the sceptic win any debate they\nare in, without conceding that ordinary knowledge-ascriptions are\nfalse. \n\nThe kind of position Lewis defends here, which came to be known as \n contextualism,\n has been a central focus of inquiry in epistemology for the last \nfifteen years. “Elusive Knowledge”, along with papers \nsuch as Cohen (1986) and DeRose (1995) founded this research program. \n\nThis subsection is largely about two pairs of papers: \n“Probabilities of Conditionals and Conditional \nProbabilities” (1976b) and its sequel (1986h), and \n“Desire as Belief” (1988b) and its sequel (1996a). The \npapers have more in common than merely having a common naming \nconvention. (They're not even Lewis's only sequels; “Lucas \nAgainst Mechanism” (1969b) also has a sequel (1979d).) In both \ncases Lewis aims to defend orthodox\n Bayesian epistemology\n against some challenges. And in both cases the argument turns on \nprinciples to do with updating. Lewis was throughout his career a \nBayesian; he frequently said that the ideal epistemic agent was a \nBayesian conditionaliser and expected utility maximiser. And he defended this \nposition with some gusto. \n\nThe conditionals papers concern a position that was gaining \npopularity before Lewis showed it was untenable. The position in \nquestion starts with the idea that a speaker can properly say \nProbably, if p, q if and only if their\nsubjective probability of q given p is high. And the\nposition then offers an explanation of this purported fact. The\nEnglish word ‘if’ is a binary connective which forms a\nsentence to be written as p → q, and it is true\nin virtue of the meaning of this connective\nthat Pr(q | p) = Pr(p\n→ q). So, assuming ‘probably’ means\nsomething like subjective probability Probably, if\np, q means that the subjective probability of p\n→\nq, and, assuming the agent is coherent, that is true just in\ncase the subjective probability of q given p is \nhigh. \n\nLewis doubted several aspects of this story. He briefly notes in\n“Adverbs of Quantification” that he didn't think the\n‘if’ in Probably, if p, q is a\nbinary connective. But the more telling objection was his proof that\nthere could not be a connective → such that for all p,\nq,\nPr(q | p) = Pr(p → \nq). Lewis first argued for this in (1976b), and showed how \nto weaken some of the assumptions of the argument in (1986h). The \neffect of Lewis's position was to essentially end the hope of \nanalysing English ‘if’ in terms of a binary connective with \nthese probabilistic properties. \n\nThe desire papers (1988a, 1996b) are also about the Humean view that \nmotivation requires both a belief and a desire. Lewis aims to attack \nthe anti-Humean position that some beliefs, in particular beliefs \nthat a certain thing is good, can play the functional roles of both \nbeliefs and desires. He argues that this is not, in general, \npossible. And the argument is that beliefs and desires update in \ndifferent ways. Or, at least, that anyone who updates their beliefs \nby conditionalisation and updates their valuation functions in a \nplausible way, will not be able to preserve a perfect correlation between \ntheir desire for a proposition being true and their belief in that proposition's \ngoodness. \n\nBoth of these papers rely on the idea that conditionalisation is a\ngood way to update beliefs. Neither, by the way, rely on the idea that\nconditionalisation is the only rational way to update beliefs; the\narguments go through given merely the permissibility of\nconditionalising. Many Bayesians hold something stronger, namely that\nconditionalisation is the way to update beliefs. One widely\nused argument in favour of this position is a so-called ‘Dutch\nBook’ argument. This argument shows that if you plan to follow\nany strategy for revising beliefs other than conditionalisation, and\nyou do follow that strategy, then someone who knows the strategy that\nyou're going to follow can produce a series of bets that will seem\nfavourable to you when each is offered, but which will collectively\nlead to a sure loss. It is also true that if you do update by\nconditionalisation, there is no similar Dutch Book that can be made,\nbut Lewis did not prove this. (It is Theorem V in Skyrms (1987).) The\nDutch Book argument for conditionalisation was introduced to the\nliterature by Paul Teller (1976), who credited it to Lewis. Lewis's\nown version of the argument did not appear until 1999, in Papers\nin Metaphysics and Epistemology, under the title “Why\nConditionalize?” (1999b). This was something he had written as a\ncourse handout in 1972, and which had been very widely circulated,\nand, via Teller's paper, very influential on the development of\nBayesian epistemology. \n\nLewis was an early proponent of one of the two major views about the\nSleeping Beauty puzzle, which is nicely described in Sorensen 2009: \nThe puzzle was introduced to the philosophical community\nby Adam Elga (2000), who argued that when Beauty woke up, her credence\nin Heads should be\n1⁄3. Lewis argued that the correct answer\nwas 1⁄2. The core of his argument was \nthat before Beauty went to sleep, her credence in Heads should be \n1⁄2. That was agreed on all sides. \nMoreover, nothing happened that surprised Beauty. Indeed, everything \nhappened exactly as she expected it would. Lewis argued that \n“Only new relevant evidence, centred or uncentred, produces a \nchange in credence” (2001c: 174), and that Beauty got no new \nevidence. This idea has featured heavily in subsequent work defending\nthe 1⁄2 answer to the Sleeping Beauty \npuzzle. \n\nThe Sleeping Beauty puzzle is important for another reason. As the \nquote above indicates, the puzzle is usually set up in terms of sets \nof centered worlds, following the work of Lewis we described in \nsection 4.5. The work generated by the puzzle has been one of the \nreasons that that work, in particular (1979b), has received a large \namount of attention in recent years. \n\nIn “Anselm and Actuality” (1970a), Lewis tries to give as\ngood a formulation of the \n ontological argument\nas can be made in modal realist terms. This is a good framework for\ndiscussing the ontological argument, since on one interpretation, the\nargument rests crucially on cross-world comparisons of greatness and\nthe modal realist can make sense of that kind of talk better than\nviews that reject possible objects. Lewis argues that the principle\n“A being than which nothing greater can be conceived is\npossible” is crucially ambiguous. One kind of reading is that\nthe imagined being's greatness in its world is greater than the\ngreatness of any other being in that being's world. That may be true,\nbut it doesn't imply that the being actually exists. Another kind of\nreading focusses on the imagined being's greatness in this world. It\nsays that there (actually) is a being whose actual greatness is\ngreater than the greatness of any possible being. That entails the\nconclusion, but is not plausibly true. The broader conclusion here,\nthat the ontological argument derives its persuasive force from an\nequivocation, is one that has been widely adopted since Lewis's\npaper. \n\nIn “Evil for Freedom's Sake” (1993b), Lewis reflects at \nlength on the \n free will defence\n to the \n problem of evil.\n Lewis argues that for the defence to work, God must make quite \ndifferent trade-offs between freedom and welfare than we are usually \ndisposed to make, and our understanding of what freedom consists in, \nand what divine foreknowledge consists in, must be different to what \nthey currently are. \n\nIn “Do We Believe in Penal Substitution?” (1997a), Lewis \nnotes that we only sometimes accept that one person can be properly \npunished for another's misdeeds. He uses this to raise an interesting\ndifficulty for the Christian idea that Christ died for our sins, \nsuggesting this may not be a form of penal substitution that is \nnormally acceptable. \n\nIn “Divine Evil” (2007), Lewis suggests that proponents \nof the problem of evil should not focus on what God fails to prevent,\nbut on what God does. In orthodox forms of theism, particularly \nChristianity and Islam, God is presented as perpetrating great evil \nagainst sinners of various stripes in the form of extreme punishments\nin the afterlife. Lewis suggests that a God that does would be so \nevil that we should not only reject Him, but we may regard those who \nendorse the divine punishments as themselves somewhat culpable for \ndivine evil. (The published version of this paper was composed by \nPhillip Kitcher after Lewis's death from notes Lewis made, and \nconversations Kitcher had with Lewis.) \n\nLewis is obviously not as well known for his work in ethics as for \nhis work in other areas of philosophy. It was something of a surprise\nwhen one of the volumes of his collected papers was called Papers\nin Ethics and Social Philosophy (2000a). On the other hand, the \nexistence of this volume indicates that there is a large body of work\nthat Lewis put together in moral philosophy, very broadly construed. \nThe best guide to this work is chapter 8 of Nolan (2005), and I'll \nfollow Nolan very closely here. \n\nAs Nolan suggests, the least inaccurate summary of Lewis's ethical \npositions is that he was a \n virtue ethicist.\n Indeed, a focus on virtue, as opposed to consequences, plays a role \nin his defence of modal realism, as we saw in section 6.4. Nolan also\nnotes that this position is somewhat surprising. Most philosophers \nwho accept views related to Lewis's about psychology and \ndecision-making (in particular, who accept a Humean story about \nbeliefs and desires being the basis for motivation, and who accept \nsome or other version of expected utility maximisation as the basis \nfor rational decision) have broadly consequentialist positions. But \nnot Lewis. \n\nLewis was also a \n value pluralist\n (1984a, 1989b, 1993b). Indeed, this was part of his objection to \nconsequentialism. He rejected the idea that there was one summary\njudgment we could make about the moral value of a person. In\n“Reply to McMichael” (1978a) he complains about the\nutilitarian assumption that “any sort or amount of evil can be\nneutralized, as if it had never been, by enough countervailing good\n—and that the balancing evil and good may be entirely\nunrelated” (1978a: 85). \n\nIn meta-ethics, Lewis defended a variety of \n subjectivism\n (1989b). Like many subjectivists, Lewis held that something is \nvaluable for us if and only if  we would value it under ideal circumstances. And \nhe held, following Frankfurt (1971), that valuing something is simply\ndesiring to desire it. What is distinctive about Lewis's position is \nhis view about what ideal circumstances are. He thinks they are \ncircumstances of “full imaginative acquaintance”. This \nhas some interesting consequences. In particular, it allows Lewis to \nsay that different goods have different conditions of full \nimaginative acquaintance. It might, he suggests, be impossible to \nproperly imagine instantiating several different values at once. And \nthat in turn lets him argue that his value pluralism is consistent \nwith this kind of subjectivism, in a way that it might not be \nconsistent with other varieties of subjectivism. \n\nLewis also wrote several more papers in applied ethics. In two \ninteresting papers on \n tolerance\n (1989a, 1989d), he suggests that one reason for being tolerant, and \nespecially of being tolerant of speech we disapprove of, comes from \ngame-theoretic considerations. In particular, he thinks our \nmotivation for tolerance comes from forming a ‘tacit \ntreaty’ with those with differing views. If we agree not to \npress our numerical superiority to repress them when we are in the \nmajority, they will do the same. So tolerating opposing views may be \nan optimal strategy for anyone who isn't sure that they will be in \nthe majority indefinitely. In these works it is easy to see the \nlegacies of Lewis's early work on philosophical lessons to be drawn \nfrom game theory, and especially from the work of Thomas Schelling. \n\nThere's much more that could be said about Lewis's contributions to \nphilosophy, but we'll end with a discussion of two wonderful pieces \nof applied metaphysics. \n\nIn “The Paradoxes of Time Travel” (1976d), Lewis \ndiscusses the many complicated philosophical issues about \n time travel.\n He discusses \n temporal parts,\n personal identity, causation and causal loops, free will, and the \ncomplications arising from our many different modal concepts. In some\ncases he uses the canvas provided to illustrate his own take on the \nmetaphysical issues that arise. But in some cases he notes that the \nproblems that arise are problems for everyone. \n\n“Holes” (Lewis and Lewis 1970) was co-written with \nStephanie Lewis. In it they discuss, in dialog form, some of the \nmetaphysical issues that holes generate. One of the characters, \nArgle, wants to eliminate holes from his ontology, and the paper goes\nover what costs must be met to make this form of \n nominalism\n work. The other character, Bargle, pushes Argle to clarify his \ncommitments, and in doing so draws out many details of the nominalist\nframework. The case is of some interest in itself, but it is also, as\nthe authors note at the end, a useful case-study in the kind of moves\nnominalists can make in eliminating unwanted ontology, and the costs \nof those moves. \n\nEach paper can be, and indeed often has been, used for introducing \ncomplicated metaphysical issues to students. The papers are, like \nmany of Lewis's papers, widely anthologised. They are both excellent \nillustrations of the fact that, as well as being a wonderful \nphilosopher, Lewis was one of the best philosophical writers of his \ntime.","contact.mail":"brian@weatherson.org","contact.domain":"weatherson.org"}]
