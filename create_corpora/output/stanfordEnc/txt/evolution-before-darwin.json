The latter has been split into two separate\nentries.]\n\n\n\n“Evolution” in contemporary discussions denotes the theory\nof the change of organic species over time. Prior to the second half\nof the nineteenth century, the term was used primarily, if not\nexclusively, in an embryological sense to designate the development of\nthe individual embryo. These same ambiguities of usage also surround\nthe German term “Entwicklungsgeschichte” which\noriginally was used in an embryological context. In 1852 the English\nphilosopher Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) used the term to denote\nboth cosmic and biological changes from “homogeneity” to\n“heterogeneity”, and spoke there of a “theory of\nevolution”. In the 1860s the term was used in some contexts to\ndesignate species change (Bowler 1975). Darwin himself did not use\nthis specific term for his theory until the Descent of Man\n(1871). Since this article will survey the broad history of these\ntheories prior to the Origin of Species, the term\n“transformism”, a term that came into common use in French\nbiological sources around 1835, will generally be used in this article\nto designate the theory of species change prior to the shift in\nmeaning in the 1860s. Since Darwin’s work, the designator\n“evolution” has been typically, if not exclusively, linked\nwith the theory of natural selection as the primary cause by which\nsuch species change has occurred over historical time.\n\n\nThis entry gives a broad historical review of the topic up to the\n“Darwinian Revolution”. The Darwinian period will be\ntreated in the separate entry\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man.\n The issues will be examined under the following headings:\n\n\nIn many respects, the general idea of the possibility of species\nchange is an old concept. The reflections of Empedocles (ca.\n495–35 BCE) and the views of the Greek Atomists among the\nPresocratic nature philosophers formed a Classical heritage on which\nlater speculations could be developed. These Presocratic speculations\ncombined naturalistic myths of origins with reflections on the\nworkings of chance-like processes to create a naturalistic account of\nthe origins of existing forms of life (see the entry\n ancient atomism).\n Particularly as the Presocratic Atomist speculations were restated by\nthe Roman poet Titus Lucretius (ca. 99–50 BCE) in book five of\nhis On the Nature of Things (Lucretius [RN]), a source was\navailable in Antiquity that set out a speculative account of the\ngradual origin of living beings from an initial atomic chaos through\nan undirected process that sorts out the best adapted forms and\neliminates those not suited to their conditions. \nThe speculative accounts of the early atomists were, however, opposed\non several levels by the subsequent mainstream Platonic, Neo-Platonic,\nAristotelian, and Stoic philosophical traditions. The writings of\nPlato (427–327 BCE), particularly his long creation myth,\nTimaeus— the only Platonic dialogue available\ncontinuously in the Latin Western tradition—provided an\ninfluential non-Biblical source for arguments against the Atomist\ntradition. This dialogue serves as the locus classicus for\nthe notion of an externally-imposed origin of living beings through\nthe action of an intelligent Craftsman (demiurgos) who orders\na mathematically-conceived matter into a rational cosmos that includes\nliving beings in accord with eternal archetypes or forms, realizing\nthrough this activity both aesthetic and rational ends. Plato’s\naccount initiated the long tradition of reflection that was continued\nin Neo-Platonism and in aspects of Stoicism to form the foundation of\nthe argument that organic beings could not be explained by chance-like\nprocesses either in their origins or in their complex design.\nParticularly as developed in the influential writings of the Greek\nphysician Claudius Galenus (129–200 CE), a long heritage in the\nlife sciences relied upon anatomy as evidence of rational design.\nThese interpretations of “teleological design” interacted\nin complex ways with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Biblical concepts\nof creation (Sedley 2007). One common meaning of\n“teleology” frequently encountered in discussions of\nevolution since Darwin—that of externally imposed design by an\nintelligent agency (demiurge, nature, God) on pre-existing\nmatter— originates in these ancient discussions and is not\naccurately identified with the Biblical concept of creatio ex\nnihilo (Carroll 2015). \nIn Aristotle’s (384–322 BCE) seminal biological writings,\nthe external teleology of a designer-creator was replaced by an\ninternal teleological purposiveness associated with the immanent\naction of an internal cause—in living beings their informing\nsoul (psuche)— which functioned as the formal, final\nand efficient cause of life (Aristotle, De Anima II: 415b,\n10–30). Aristotle also did not endorse the concept of an\nhistorical origin of the world, affirming instead the eternity of the\nworld order (Physics, I: 192a, 25–34). At least this\nwas how he was understood by a later tradition (Dales and Argerami\n1991). \nAnother issue that Aristotle treated extensively with relevance to the\nconception of species—embryogenesis—also had important\nimplications for later discussions. In the traditions indebted in some\nway to Aristotle’s natural philosophy, sexual generation and the\nsubsequent embryological development of the individual from primordial\nmatter, is a sequential process that occurs in time under the\nteleological action of the soul (psuche). In\nAristotle’s own account, this soul-as-form is typically derived\nfrom the male parent, but it could also be derived even from the sun,\nas employed in his explanation of the origin of\nspontaneously-generated forms (Aristotle, De generatione\nanimalium, III: 762a, 20–35). \nThis theory of the passing on of soul-as-substantial form in\ngeneration also formed the basis of one meaning of\n“species” (eidos) in Aristotle’s biological\nworks—as the individualized enmattered form-as-soul that is\nperpetuated in generation eternally. Although connected by a complex\ntheory of mental abstraction to the universal in thought and language,\na “species” in this biological sense is not a universal,\nbut an eternal serial sequence of one individual generating another\nindividual (De Anima, II: 415b, 1–10). The importance\nof this meaning of “species” as distinct from the meaning\nof “species-as-universal” bears on several issues explored\nin Sections\n 3.3\n and\n 3.4\n below. One interpretive issue in the exegesis of Aristotle’s\nconception of species concerns the degree to which he was committed to\nasserting anything beyond the eternity of the three main groups\n(gene)—plants, animals and humans—rather than the\neternity of each individual kind (eidos) (De generatione\nanimalium, II: 731b, 32–732a5). \nThe implications of Aristotle’s complex thought for subsequent\ndiscussions of species, generated by the recovery of his writings in\nthe Latin West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were varied.\nOn one hand, Aristotle’s apparent metaphysical requirement that\nthe soul-as-form (eidos) be permanent and enduring through\nthe process of the generation of “like by like” seemed for\nmuch of the tradition to amount to a denial of the possibility that\nnatural species could change over time in their essential properties,\neven though local adaptation in “accidental” properties\nwas fully possible. Since individual beings were considered to be\ndynamic composites of a material substrate and an immaterial and\neternal form, the accidental differentiation of the substantial form\nin individuals did not affect the metaphysical endurance of the\nspecies. It also made species extinction metaphysically impossible. In\nliving beings, the soul-as-form is serially passed on through time in\nthe act of generation to create an eternal continuity of the form.\nThis supplied a metaphysical foundation for the notion of species\npermanence without reliance on an external creative agency. \nIn the background of the discussion of the high middle ages was also\nthe theory of divine creation endorsed in inherited Jewish, Christian\nand Islamic thought. This required a distinction between the first\norigin of species in historical time, and the normal generation of the\nindividual. If the origin of species was attributed to divine action,\nthe temporal emergence of these species was not necessarily\ninstantaneous. Such a doctrine was the basis of Augustine of\nHippo’s (354–430) theory of the original creation of\nprimordial seeds (rationes seminales) of each species at an\noriginal moment in time, but with the emergence of species in\nhistorical time a possibility (Augustine, VI.13.23–25, [GL,\n175–76]). This theory of a temporalized creation, put forth\nexplicitly in detail in his treatise The Literal Interpretation of\nGenesis, allowed Augustine to argue that species emerged\nsequentially in historical time rather than all at once. \nThe great textual recoveries in the Latin West of Greek science,\nmedicine and philosophy of the twelfth through the fifteenth\ncenturies, generally accompanied by Islamic commentaries, introduced\nthese texts into a theological context that had been strongly defined\nby Augustinianism and neo-Platonism. The interplay between this\npre-existent tradition with new philosophical views defined a complex\nperiod of intellectual ferment that defined much of the subsequent\nintellectual and scientific history of the West (Gaukroger 2006: chp.\n2). The sustained efforts of major synthesizers, such as Thomas\nAquinas (1225–1274), to bring the massive body of\nnewly-recovered Aristotelian works into dialogue with Christian\nNeo-Platonism and Augustinianism, demanded new insights into the\nconception of the soul-body relation, the autonomy of the natural\norder and the role of secondary causes in the creation of the\nworld. \nConcerning the issue of species-permanence and origin, Aquinas treated\nthis in dialogue with Augustine’s theory of serial creation. As\nhe comments in his major synthesis, the Summa Theologiae:\n“New species, if they appear, pre-exist in certain active\npowers” (Pars I, Qu. 73, Rep Obj. 3). This claim suggests a\nreading of Aristotle that assumed the essential fixity of each\ndefinable substantial form, and the eternity of each species since\ncreation. But this conclusion must be read in the context of\nAquinas’s complex theory of creation and the discussions of the\nproblem of universals in late Scholastic philosophy (see the entry\n medieval problem of universals,\n and Wilkins 2009: Ch. 3). This context prevents any simple picture of\nScholastic thought concerning the issue of species permanence, and it\ncannot be claimed that either Aristotle or later Scholastics such as\nAquinas are responsible for the strong “essentialist”\nposition often attributed to them in the literature (R.A. Richards\n2010: chp. 2). As developed below, it can be argued that the species\nconcept was “hardened” only in the early modern period\nwith the rise of the mechanical philosophy and its attendant\npreformationist embryology. The “strong essentialist”\nposition often attributed to Aristotle and Scholasticism (Hull, 1992),\nis demonstrably a product of later historical developments (R.A.\nRichards 2010; Wilkins 2009; Oderberg 2007: chp. 9; Winsor 2006;\nLennox 1985, 1987). \nThe re-introduction of Greek and Roman atomism in the Renaissance,\nwith the recovery (1417) and printing (1473) of Lucretius’\nphilosophical poem On the Nature of Things, introduced to a\nliterate European audience a series of influential cosmological\nspeculations that included a naturalistic account of the origin of\nspecies integrated into a non-teleological materialist cosmology that\ncontrasted markedly with the received Scholastic, Aristotelian, and\nAugustinian-Platonic traditions. Into the eighteenth century, these\nspeculations, and those drawn from other atomist sources (see the\nentry on\n natural philosophy in the Renaissance),\n were often in the background of novel early modern reflections on\nspecies origins and their possible transformation in time throughout\nthe eighteenth century (Bowler 2003: chp. 2; Oldroyd 1996; Greene\n1959). \nA new starting point in systematic reflections on the origin of the\nearth and living beings, showing both some similarity and also major\ndifferences from atomist speculations, dates specifically from the\nsynthesis of natural philosophy and metaphysics put forth by\nRené Descartes (1596–1650) in his Principia\nphilosophiae (1st ed. 1644; 2nd ed. 1647). This treatise expanded\nand summarized issues he had developed earlier in Le Monde\n(The World, or Treatise on Light), a work published only\nposthumously in 1664, with an improved edition appearing in 1677. \nIt is important for understanding the subsequent reflections on the\n“history” of nature to recognize that these Cartesian\nspeculations on the history of the earth and solar system were\nintroduced in the form of a counter-factual hypothesis that explicitly\nsought to avoid conflict with accepted theological interpretations of\norigin (Descartes 1647 [1983: 181]). In the hypothetical account\noffered in the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes derived\nthe earth from a cooled star “formerly…like the\nSun” (ibid.). By its gradual solidification in a great celestial\nvortex, the Earth took form. Subsequent drying and cracking formed the\nocean basins, the continents and the mountain ranges. \nAn outstanding lacuna in Descartes’s account, however, was his\nfailure to incorporate the origins of living beings into his\nnaturalistic story of creation by natural laws. Although manuscripts\ndisplay the degree to which Descartes attempted on several occasions\nto work out some linkage between his general natural philosophy and\nthe embryological formation of living beings, these reflections did\nnot appear in print during his lifetime (Aucante 2006). The\nPrinciples simply skips over the issue of a naturalistic\naccount of the origins of life and the origin of individual species.\nInstead in Part IV, devoted generally to the origin and physical\nproperties of the Earth, he jumps (Proposition 188) from a discussion\nof magnetism to a brief allusion to projected Parts V and VI of his\nPrinciples that would deal with animals and humans (Descartes\n1647 [1983: 275–276]). But the Principles only offers a\nbrief discussion of the various senses and body-soul interaction\nsimilar to that put forth in his early unpublished Treatise on\nMan (1st Latin ed. 1662, 2nd French ed. 1664). These speculations\nwere grounded on the concept of a hypothetical statue-machine created\ndirectly by divine action, and possessed immediately of all human\nfunctions and structures (Descartes 1664 [1972: 1–5]). \nDescartes’s speculations conveyed to his successors at least two\nissues relevant to the origin and history of living species. First, by\npresenting the historical account of the origin of the solar system\nand the world as a counterfactual hypothesis, a means of understanding\nthe history of nature that was adapted to the limitations of the human\nmind, rather than as a literally true account, Descartes provided the\noption of a purely fictionalist reading of historical science that\npersisted into the nineteenth century (Sloan 2006a). Second, the\nintegration of living beings into the new natural philosophy of\nmechanistic naturalism was left unresolved. If anything,\nDescartes’s reflections accentuated the problem of providing a\nnaturalistic explanation of the origins of living beings. \nTwo traditions can be traced in the wake of Descartes’s\nreflections. Beginning with the De solido intra solidum\nnaturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus of 1669 by the\nDanish Cartesian Nicholas Steno (1638–86), efforts commenced to\ndraw the historical origins of living beings into the Cartesian\ncosmology, in this case primarily by granting that fossils were the\nremains of once existing organisms on an earth that had formed\nhistorically. There was, however, no effort made to account for the\norigins of these beings on Cartesian principles (Rudwick 1972). \nA second tradition established a series of published reflections in\nthe later seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that came to be\nknown in subsequent literature as “theories of the earth”.\nThis tradition commenced with the Telluris theoria sacra,\npublished in 1681 (English edition 1684) by the English clergyman,\nThomas Burnet (1635–1715). Burnet sought to reconcile a\nCartesian-derived historical account of the origins of the Earth with\nthe creation account of the Mosaic tradition. In Burnet’s\naccount, the Earth began from an original chaos fashioned by divine\naction into the existing Earth through a series of changes that\ninvolved the gradual separation of the continents, the reversal of the\npoles, and the Mosaic flood. To explain the origin of living beings,\nBurnet relied on the “spontaneous fruitfulness of the\nground” in the primeval Edenic world, rather than on the direct\ncreation of forms through divine action (Burnet 1684: bk 2, chp. 2,\npara. 4, p. 187 [1965: 141]). By connecting this account to the\nBiblical story of the first chapter of Genesis, Burnet broke\nwith Cartesian counterfactualism, offering for the first time a\npresumably literal interpretation of a Cartesian-style developmental\nhistory of nature that also included the origins of living forms. \nThe various accounts offered in the subsequent “theory of the\nearth” tradition, as they were amplified by such natural\nphilosophers as John Ray (1627–1705), John Woodward\n(1665–1728), and William Whiston (1667–1752), failed to\nachieve a consensus position on the question of a naturalistic\nexplanation of the origins of organisms (Rudwick 1972, 2005). New\nreflections on the embryological origin of the individual organism in\nthe seventeenth-century provided a particular point of focus, and the\nreflections on this issue were closely tied to speculations about\nspecies origins. \nIn its seventeenth-century context, the issue of species origins also\ninvolved debates over the possibility of the spontaneous generation of\nforms (Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 2]). The experimental refutations by\nFrancesco Redi (1626–67) of theories of origin relying on\nabiogenesis, such as those proposed by Thomas Burnet, weakened, but\ndid not destroy, the belief in spontaneous generation. Evidence for\nspontaneous generation could always be explained by appeal to\nAugustine’s theory of the pre-existent “seeds” or\n“germs”. \nThe extensive empirical researches on the generation of birds and\nmammals carried out by William Harvey (1578–1657), and published\nlate in his life in his Exercitationes de generatione\nanimalium (Observations on the Generation of Animals) in\n1651, proved to be a bombshell in this discussion. Harvey’s\ncareful studies claimed to refute on empirical grounds both the\nAristotelian form-matter theory of sexual generation as well as the\nrival “two-seeds” theory based on the assumption of\nequivalent male and female semen. This latter theory had been embraced\nby ancient atomists, by Galenic and Hippocratic medical theorists, and\nby the majority of Renaissance physicians. The two-seeds theory had\nalso been accepted by early-modern atomists such as Pierre Gassendi\n(1592–1655) and Nathaniel Highmore (1613–85) (Fisher\n2006). As a consequence, when Descartes’s own speculations on\nembryonic formation were finally published posthumously in 1677, in\nwhich he had also relied on the combination of male and female\nsemina organized by laws of nature and the vortex theory,\nthey commonly met with derision (see quote from Garden below).\nHarvey’s detailed embryological enquiries of 1651 had already\nseriously undermined the empirical bases of these claims. It is\ndifficult to find any author who endorsed the solution as offered by\nDescartes. \nThese empirical difficulties with both the main inherited theories of\ngeneration as well as with the new “mechanistic”\nalternative accounts of embryogenesis of Gassendi, Highmore, and\nDescartes produced a conceptual crisis within the program of universal\nmechanism that suggested that universal mechanism could not deal\ncausally with one of the most important issues in the philosophy of\nnature. Another solution needed to be found. \nAs a consequence of the failure of “mechanistic”\nepigenesis, post-Cartesian mechanists resolved this issue with the\ntheory of “preexistence”. Scientific foundations of this\ncan be traced to the work of the microscopist Jan Swammerdam\n(1637–80) in the late 1660s on the basis of his microscopic\nobservations on developing insects. The philosophical development of\nthis theory was made by the French Oratorian priest Nicholas\nMalebranche (1638–1715), whose influential Recherche de la\nvérité of 1674 recast many Cartesian principles\ninto a framework of “theistic” universal mechanism\n(Gaukroger 2010: chp.2). In this work Malebranche offered a novel\ntheory of generation which is most accurately termed a\n“preexistence” theory. On this view, the new organism is\nnot generated in secular time, but has pre-existed since the original\ncreation of the world. This theory, often supported by appeals to\nAugustine’s theory of the creation of original seeds (see above\n Section 1.2),\n was to become the paradigmatic theory for nearly a century, and was\nclosely associated with some version of the mechanical philosophy.\nVarious expressions of the preexistence theory can be traced into the\npublic teaching and published works of such influential expositors of\nacademic medicine as Hermann Boerhaave (1668–1738) of the\nUniversity of Leyden. The theory is also endorsed in numerous\nscientific treatises of the early eighteenth century. The question of\nboth individual and species origin was by this theory removed to\ndivine action at the first creation of the world (Pyle 2006; Roger\n1963 [1997: chp. 6]). \nAt least three variants of the theory of pre-existence can be\ndistinguished. Two of these assumed the pre-existence of forms in\nminiature, either encased in the ovaries of the female (Ovism), the\noriginal version, or after the discovery of spermatozoa by Anton van\nLeeuwenhoek in 1677, in the testes of the male (Vermism). These two\nversions of “preformationism” generally became the main\noptions one finds expressed in the professional medical and\ngynecological literature of the 1670–1740 period. A third\nalternative, which had few followers in the seventeenth and early\neighteenth century, but which became particularly popular by the\n1770s, was the theory of pre-formed “germs”, given its\nfirst clear statement by Claude Perrault (1608–80). This\nPerrault theory, which closely resembled the Augustinian account, held\nthat the first primordia of organisms were formed at the original\ncreation as seeds dispersed in the soil, from which they were taken in\nwith food. Under the proper conditions and within the correct\norganisms, these “germs” became implanted in the ovaries\nfrom which they then developed in response to fertilization. In all\nthree accounts, the act of fertilization provided the occasion, and\nnot the cause, of the development of organisms in time. \nThe theory of pre-existence was seen to solve many problems. First, it\nexplained the intimate interrelation of structure and function that\nseemed to require the existence of parts of the organism in an\nintegrated system. The heart presumably could not beat without\nennervation, and the nerves could not exist without the heart.\nConsequently, as the argument went, the entire organism must\npre-exist. The existence of such integrated systems seemed otherwise\ndifficult to explain by the sequential development of parts, as\nimplied in Aristotelian and other “epigenetic” theories of\ndevelopment. Second, this account was easily harmonized with\ntheological developments in the seventeenth century, particularly on\nthe Continent, where the strong influence of Augustinian theology on\nCalvinism (Protestant) and Jansenism (Catholic) was most in evidence.\nAs an example, it provided for the transmission of Original Sin. The\nsolution that emerged was a “theistic” mechanism that\nemphasized God’s omnipotence and the corresponding passivity of\nnature (Deason 1986; Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 6]). A third advantage of\nthe theory of preexistence, at least in the versions that embraced the\n“ preformed germs” interpretation, was that it allowed for\nthe appearance of life in secular time, which seemed to be suggested\nby the existence of fossil forms. At the same time no versions of\npreexistence theory implied any change of species or development of\none species from another in time. Finally, some version of a theory of\nthe preformation of the embryo could be reconciled with the best\nmicroscopic observations of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth\ncenturies, as these were reported by such experts on this instrument\nas Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723), Jan Swammerdam, Marcello\nMalpighi (1628–1694), and Henry Baker (1690–1774). \nThese preexistence theories of embryological origin directly affected\nthe question of species transformism. First, they effectively removed\nthe organism from the effects of local circumstance and environmental\nconditions. Second, they all placed the origin of species, as well as\nthat of at least the primordia of the individual organism, at a moment\nin the original divine creation. A quotation from a contemporary\nreview article illustrates several aspects of the thesis of\npreexistence: \nAnd indeed all the Laws of Motion which are as yet discovered, can\ngive but a very lame account of the forming of a Plant or Animal. We\nsee how wretchedly Des Cartes came off when he began to apply\nthem to this subject; they are form’d by Laws yet unknown to\nMankind, and it seems most probable that the Stamina of all\nthe Plants and Animals that have ever been, or ever shall be in the\nWorld, have been formed ab Origine Mundi [from the foundation\nof the world] by the Almighty Creator within the first of each\nrespective kind. (Garden 1691: 476–477) \nThe immediate consequence of this theory was a new rigidity given to\nthe concept of species that it had not possessed in the Aristotelian\nand Scholastic traditions. Preexistence theory reinforced a sharp\ndistinction between “essential” and\n“accidental” properties to a degree not implied by the\nprior tradition. At the same time, preexistence theory made it\ndifficult to explain obvious empirical phenomena, such as monstrosity,\nthe regeneration of lost parts, the resemblances of offspring to both\nparents, evidence for geographical variation, racial differences, and\nthe existence of hybrid forms such as the mule. It seemed necessary to\nattribute these anomalies to divine action at an original creation.\nThese difficulties in the theory resulted in a variety of criticisms\nthat were eventually to lead to the downfall of preexistence theory in\nits original form, although the theory was to have a long subsequent\nhistory through a modification of the “germ” theory\n(Detlefsen 2006; Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 7]; Roe 1981). \nThe dominance of some form of pre-existence theory of generation\nbetween roughly 1670 and the 1740s provides some explanation for the\nlack of efforts among natural philosophers to develop transformist\ntheories of species origins in the same period. A notable exception to\nthis claim was the Epicurean cosmology resembling some aspects of\nLucretius’s poem, developed by the French philosophe\nBenôit de Maillet (1656–1738) in his privately circulated\nmanuscript Telliamed that was known in French circles for ten\nyears before its publication in 1748. In this work de Maillet offered\nbold speculations on how sea creatures developed into land forms over\ntime. Nonetheless, the period before the middle of the eighteenth\ncentury was dominated by a theory of organic generation that\neffectively precluded the naturalistic development of species. The\ndevelopment of scientific transformism can be seen to be intimately\ntied to new theories of generation, and also to the development of\n“active” rather than “passive” conceptions of\nmatter. \nThe introduction of Newtonian natural philosophy into this discussion\nhad ambiguous consequences depending on the interpretations given to\nNewton’s natural philosophy. Newton’s\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\n(Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) of 1687, with\nsubsequent revised editions in 1713 and 1726, developed a fundamental\ncritique of Cartesianism, and also introduced the concept of\n“attraction at a distance” into physical explanations.\nExtending the concept of “active powers” to the\nmicro-level in the Opticks of 1704 (English), with important\nrevisions in editions of 1706 (Latin), 1717, 1721, and 1730, Newton\nintroduced into biological discussions new issues that played out in\ncomplex ways in the subsequent decades. \nOn one reading of Newton, his conception of active forces introduced\nback into life science a concept of “dynamic” matter that\ncould be used as a warrant for a new vitalistic embryology and even a\nnon-mechanistic conception of nature possessed of intrinsic powers\n(Schofield 1970: chp. 9). This option was followed out by many French\nmedical writers who used Newtonian arguments to ground a\n“vitalistic” medical theory, an interpretation\nparticularly developed at the University of Montpellier in the early\ndecades of the eighteenth century (Wolfe 2014; Gaukroger 2010: chps.\n10–11). \nBut in the more “mechanistic” interpretation of\nNewtonianism, this retained the inert character of matter and endorsed\nmany of the main features of Cartesian biomechanism, but with the\naddition of mathematical quantification and some use of attractive and\nrepulsive microforces (Schofield 1970: chp. 1). In this tradition of\ninterpretation, one finds a commitment to mechanistic preformationism\nand even strong “preexistence” theory. This can be\nfollowed in the medical theories of Hermann Boerhaave, Archibald\nPitcairne (1652–1713), Richard Mead (1673–1754), and other\nNewtonian iatromechanists who typically had contact with the great\nDutch medical schools (Guerrini 1987). \nNewton had also argued in the long thirty-first Query to the\nOpticks against “World-Building” of the Cartesian\nform, as discussed above. Newton saw this as claiming that the world\n“might arise out of a Chaos by the mere Laws of Nature”\n(Newton 1730: 378), and condemned this as\n“unphilosophical” (ibid., 401). Revival of\nrealistically interpreted historical cosmology in the eighteenth\ncentury involved a clear break with these Newtonian strictures. This\nshift will be developed in the following section. \nThe development of new conceptualizations of the relation of organic\nbeings to the history of the world, and the relation of species\npermanence to this history, was achieved in the eighteenth century.\nThis included the breakdown of universal mechanism, the introduction\nof dynamic theories of matter, new theories of embryological\nformation, and a reconceptualization of the relation of time to the\nmaterial world. It also involved the formulation of progressive and\ndevelopmental, rather than “degenerating”, conceptions of\nthe history of life. The following discussion will selectively examine\naspects of these developments. The reader is referred to major recent\nhistorical syntheses for further development of the more general\nintellectual and scientific context (Zammito 2018a; Gaukroger 2010;\nReill 2005; Rudwick 2005). \nIn several respects these developments are connected in some way to\nthe introduction of more dynamic conceptions of matter that emerged in\nthe interplay between Newtonianism and Leibnizianism in the early\ndecades of the eighteenth century, particularly in French discussions\n(Shank 2008). As described in the previous section, Newton’s\nintroduction in the Queries to the Opticks of the concept of\nactive microforces that could explain microchemical and electrical\nphenomena opened up this discussion. The other great natural\nphilosophy developed on the Continent by Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646–1716) and systematized and expanded into an influential\nsystematic philosophical program by Christian Wolff (1679–1754),\nelaborated a more complex theory of matter that distinguished between\nthe properties of phenomenal “matter” as conceived by\nNewton, and those of more fundamental active and\nteleologically-directed “substance”, grounded in force\n(vis). In physics this development played out on the\nContinent in the vis viva controversy, which was concerned\ninitially with the conservation of force in collisions. It was then\nextended to more fundamental metaphysical issues that had a complex\neffect on the life sciences. \nIn the life sciences, these issues were manifest in debates over the\nrole of vital powers in the explanation of living properties, as these\nwere developed particularly in French discussions in the complex\ninteractions of Newtonian and Leibnizian-Wolffian natural\nphilosophies. An influential example of this synthesis is\nÉmilie Du Châtelet’s (1706–1749)\nInstitutions de Physique (first ed. 1740, second ed. 1742).\nThese hybrid Leibnizian-Newtonian syntheses, bringing together aspects\nof Newton’s “active” forces with the monad\nand substance theory of Leibnizianism, were subsequently extended into\ndiscussions of embryology by Pierre de Maupertuis (1698–1759),\nand as will be developed in the next section, by Georges-Louis\nLeClerc, Comte de Buffon (1707–88) in the 1740s. \nIt is in these discussions that we encounter the first early modern\nsystematic speculations connecting naturalistic theories of earth\nhistory, embryological development, and changes of organic species in\nresponse to external changes of conditions of life. These connections\ndevelop directly out of critiques of the preexistence theory of\ngeneration by Maupertuis and Buffon, who in different but related ways\nreformulated the “mechanistic” epigenetic embryology\npreviously advocated by Descartes and Atomist theorists. Similar to\nthese discarded theories (see above,\n Section 2.2),\n the existence of equivalent male and female “seeds” was\npostulated, which were then assumed to combine in sexual generation to\nform the embryo. The new eighteenth-century versions supplemented\nthese seventeenth-century accounts with a novel role for dynamic\nconceptions of matter and inherent organizing forces. In the case of\nBuffon, these claims were supported by controversial microscopic\nobservations that presumably refuted the opposing claims made by\nWilliam Harvey a century earlier. \nWe can conveniently date these developments from the speculations of\nPierre de Maupertuis, put forth in two treatises, the better known the\nPhysical Venus (Vénus physique) published in\n1745. To deal with the difficulty of explaining how atomistic seeds\nderived from the male and female could be formed into the complexity\nof the embryo, Maupertuis drew upon a kind of Newtonian attraction\ninherent in these seeds which also included elements of Leibnizian\nmonad theory. In his last formulation of 1751 he expanded on this with\nthe claim that the particles themselves were endowed with an internal\nprinciple that led them to arrange themselves to form specific parts\nof the fetus. Maupertuis’ dynamic “epigenesis”\nincorporated both mechanism and dynamic materialism (Terrall 2002:\nchp. 7; Hoffheimer 1982). \nThere are at least three ways in which the change in embryological\ntheory instituted by Maupertuis, and subsequently elaborated by\nBuffon, proved to be relevant to the broader question of the\nhistorical transformation of species. First, this new account of the\nembryological origin of the individual organism meant that it actually\nis organized in historical time rather than pre-existing and simply\nunfolding at an opportune moment. Second, it involved a theory of\nmaterial inheritance that explained the passing on of physical traits\nfrom one generation to the next through the transmission of particles\nof matter. Third, the conservation of the identity of the species is\nguaranteed only by the accurate transmission of this material\ninheritance. If this transmission is affected by external\ncircumstances in any way, significant historical change in the lineage\nof ancestor and descendant is possible. These options, opened up by\nMaupertuis’s speculations, were subsequently developed within an\ninstitutional setting by Buffon. \nThe complex set of issues described in the preceding section two were\nall brought together in the work of Buffon. In a remarkable career\ntransition in 1739 in which he moved from his position as a pensioned\nmathematician in the Paris Royal Academy of Sciences, to a royal\nappointment to the Directorship of the King’s Garden and Natural\nHistory Cabinet (Jardin du Roi) in Paris, Buffon brought with\nhim to the domain of natural history and to his reflection on issues\nin biology his deep familiarity with the major theoretical debates\ndividing Newtonians, Cartesians, and Leibnizians in his era. He was\nalso intimately acquainted through his friend Maupertuis with the\ndebates over generation theory and theories of the earth. He fashioned\nthese ingredients into a set of new perspectives that were to define\nhis novel approach to the life sciences over the last half-century of\nthe Bourbon monarchy. In the interpretation of this article, Buffon is\nthe major figure to put together a set of issues that formed the\npre-conditions for transformism in biology, although he would never\nhimself move into this theoretical region. Through his immensely\npopular writings, which were translated into all major European\nlanguages, he exerted an influence on discussions that ranged from St.\nPetersburg in Russia to Virginia in the American colonies. \nBuffon was able to exert such influence through the concrete\ninstitutional basis provided by the Jardin du Roi, with its\nattendant large Cabinet of specimens collected from all over\nthe world. Under his leadership was created a preeminent center of\nresearch into comparative anatomy, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, and\nbiogeographical study (Spary 2000). By providing an institutional\nsetting for these inquiries, the speculations and theoretical\nreflections of eighteenth-century natural historians could be\nsubjected to organized critique and specialized examination in a\ncontext not found elsewhere in the natural-historical sciences of the\nperiod. Buffon’s theoretical vision provided a concrete\nframework against which those immediately associated with the\nJardin were able to develop further reflections on such\nissues as the nature and duration of species, the significance of\ncomparative anatomical studies, the historical relationships of forms,\nthe meaning of fossils, and the systematic relations of living beings\nto one another. Only Buffon’s contemporary, Carolus Linnaeus\n(1707–1778), Professor of Medicine and Botany at the University\nof Uppsala in Sweden after 1741, had similar authority in the domain\nof natural history, and Linnaeus did not have the resources and the\ninstitutional authority that characterized the Jardin in the\nlast days of the Bourbon monarchy. \nThis simultaneous emergence of these two major figures in the natural\nhistorical sciences of the middle Enlightenment created a major\nrivalry of traditions of inquiry that would play out on several\nfronts. In Buffon, one had the model of the grand and eloquent\ntheoretician of nature who developed major themes in Enlightenment\nnatural philosophy and applied these to biological topics. In\nLinnaeus, one had a pious systematizer of the natural world of his\nera, whose monumental System of Nature (first edition 1735),\nalong with numerous other works, formed the basis for modern\nbiological classification. Their different approaches set the stage\nfor a major theoretical conflict of traditions in natural historical\nscience that would eventually be synthesized in the nineteenth century\n(Hoquet 2007). \nBuffon’s development of a broad theoretical inquiry into natural\nscience within the framework of a state-sponsored institutional\nstructure warrants the special attention given here to his\ncontribution in the history of evolutionary theory. These included:\n(1) his methodological revolution in the epistemology of the\nnatural-historical sciences; (2) his analysis and proposed solution to\nthe problem of animal and plant generation; (3) his\nreconceptualization of the concept of biological species; (4) his\nbio-geographical approach to the issues of animal distribution and\nvariation; (5) his renewed theoretical attention to issues of\ncosmology and the “theory of the earth;” and finally (6),\nhis concluding synthesis of earth and life history in the grand\nnaturalistic account publishes as his monumental Les\n(originally Des) Époques de la Nature\n(Epochs of Nature) of 1778–9, which provided a model\nfor similar syntheses of the nineteenth century. Through this\ncombination of several lines of earlier inquiry, Buffon posed a series\nof theoretical questions that were further explored by important\nsuccessors associated with the Paris Museum in the nineteenth century\nand in natural history more generally. \nIn his position as a natural philosopher, in dialogue with the works\nof Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, Clairaut, the French\nEncyclopedists, and major English philosophers of his period,\nBuffon explored foundational methodological and philosophical\nquestions of the Enlightenment in combination with his analysis of\nempirical questions. One expression of this wider vision was the\nunusual way in which he sought to validate the inquiry into natural\nhistory in relation to a naturalized epistemology that scholars have\nseen as novel for its time (Hoquet 2005; Sloan 2006b; Roger 1963\n[1997: chp. 9], 1989 [1997: chp. 6]). In developing a new\nmethodological approach to natural history, Buffon claimed to ground\nhis arguments on a form of empirical certitude—“physical\ntruth” [verité physique]—attained through\ninquiries into the concrete relations of beings in their material\nrelations. This he opposed to the “abstractions” of\nmathematical physics, extending, it seems, the Leibnizian-inspired\nargument against Newton as developed in Émilie Du\nChâtelet’s (1706–1749) Institutions de\nPhysique, a work Buffon is known to have read and admired as he\nmade his transition into his career in natural history (Sloan 2019).\nDeveloping this argument in a long “Discourse on Method”\nthat opened the first volume of his Histoire Naturelle\n(Natural History) (1749), Buffon argued that a science based\non repeated observation of concrete material relations of bodies can\nachieve a degree of epistemic certitude that surpasses that available\nfrom the mathematical analysis of nature (Hoquet 2005; Grene &\nDepew 2004; Roger 1989 [1997: chp. 6]; Sloan 2006b). On the basis of\nthis novel epistemological framework, oriented to the search for\n“physical” truth, Buffon thus directed natural history\naway from a primarily classificatory project. The latter project,\nexemplified by the work of his contemporary Linnaeus, Buffon\ncriticized for imposing “abstract” categories on nature.\nIn its place, Buffon sought to analyze living beings in relation to\ntheir material conditions of existence. This was to be focused on\ntheir reproductive relationships, biogeographical distribution, and in\nhis later work, on their connections to cosmology and historical\ngeology. \nThese insights were developed in Buffon’s major work, the\nHistoire naturelle, générale et particulière,\navec la description du cabinet du roi (Buffon [HN]). In these\ndiscussions Buffon dealt both with issues in the foundational\nepistemology and methodology of the natural-historical sciences as\nwell as with the generalities and specifics of organic beings. The\nwork was originally intended as a survey of the entire range of\nanimals, plants, and minerals. In its actual realization, it was more\nlimited. The first series of fourteen volumes appeared between 1749\nand 1767 and dealt with the genesis of the solar system and the earth,\nthe generation of animals, the varieties of the human species, and the\nnatural history of the primary quadrupeds and apes. The main quadruped\nvolumes of the first series, beginning in 1753, were written in\ncollaboration with the comparative anatomist Marie-Louis Daubenton\n(1716–1800). A series of seven volumes of Supplements\n(1774–89) offered additional reflections and additions to these\narticles and expanded on his views on the history of the earth, the\nquadrupeds, and anthropology. These also reported on experiments on\nthe strength of wood and the cooling of metals that he applied to\ndating the age of the earth. In the fifth supplementary volume (1778),\nBuffon presented his grand synthesis of cosmology, earth history, and\nthe history of life, the Les (subsequently Des)\nÉpoques de la nature. An additional five volumes\n(1783–88) dealt with issues of mineralogy, chemistry, fire, and\nthe main forces of nature, especially electricity and magnetism.  \nThe Epochs of Nature, which was separately printed (1779) and\ntranslated into German in 1781, offered a grand synthesis of\nhistorical cosmology, the history of the earth, and the history of\nlife which was influential on several subsequent syntheses developed\nin German (Herder, Schelling), French (Lacépède) and\npossibly English (Chambers) natural history. Continuations of the\nspecial inquiries into animal groups after his death were made by his\nunderstudy Bernard de Lacépède (1756–1825), who\nextended Buffon’s general approach to the reptiles\n(1788–89), fishes (1798–1803) and cetaceans (1804). The\n“age of Buffon” became a defining era in natural history\nand established the King’s garden and its Revolutionary\nsuccessor, the Muséum national d’histoire\nnaturelle, as the foremost institutional center of\nnatural-historical inquiry through the nineteenth century (Spary 2000:\nchp. 1; Blanckaert et al. (eds) 1997; Corsi 1983 [1988], 2001). \nIn addressing the history of the earth, Buffon also broke with the\n“counter-factual” tradition of Descartes. In its place he\noffered a secular and scientifically literal account of the origins of\nthe earth and its life forms. Buffon’s new style of\nnatural-historical inquiry also disconnected it from its long\nassociation with providential design-contrivance natural theology\ndeveloped particularly by British natural historians after John Ray\n(1627–1705). This was another feature differentiating his style\nof natural history from that of Linnaeus. If he was not alone\nresponsible for “bursting the limits of time”, he was\nnonetheless one of the major figures in the “time\nrevolution” of the latter eighteenth century (Rudwick 2005).\nEven though all these points were offered before the Epochs\nof 1778–9 in fragmentary form, and often without satisfactory\ndevelopment from a general philosophical point of view, their\npresentation in Buffon’s widely influential work profoundly\naffected the subsequent tradition of natural history. \nThe concrete manifestation of Buffon’s combination of novel\nmethodology and empirical inquiry is first displayed by his treatment\nof embryological generation in the second volume of his Natural\nHistory (1749). These principles also underlie his unusual\nanalysis of the meaning of “species” in natural history.\nIn both instances, the notion of epistemic certitude gained from a\n“constant recurrence” of events seems to have played a\nfundamental role in his reflections. Following the lead of his friend\nMaupertuis, Buffon also endorsed the theory of the male and female\nseeds to explain sexual generation, deriving the origin of the embryo\nfrom the mechanical mixture of these ingredients. Amplifying upon\nMaupertuis’s prior speculations (see above\n Section 2.4),\n he explained the organization of the particles of these two seeds\ninto a structured whole through microforces closely identified with\nNewtonian attractive forces that formed an organizing force-field, an\n“internal mold”, that assimilated matter in the proper\norder for embryological development. Viewed in longer historical\nperspective, Buffon’s theory of the internal mold functioned in\na way similar to Aristotle’s notion of an immanent substantial\nform, and was likely influenced by Aristotle’s discussions in\nDe generatione animalium (see above\n Section 1.1).\n This “mold” serves as an immanent principle of\norganization that acts in company with matter to structure the unified\norganism by gradual development. The internal mold also guaranteed the\nperpetuation of like by like over time. Unlike Aristotle’s\nsubstantial form, however, Buffon’s internal mold is without an\ninternal finality in its action. It is also not a principle of\nvitalization. \nFor this reason, Buffon was conceptually required to attribute some\nnew powers to matter to account for vital action. In pursuing this\noption, he broke with universal mechanism and the assumption of the\npassivity of matter that was an intrinsic component of the mechanical\nphilosophy and some interpretations of Newtonianism (see above\n Section 2.3).\n There are also important similarities of his new\n“vitalism” to that found in Leibnizian discussions such as\nwas expounded in the Institutions de Physique of\nÉmilie Du Châtelet in 1740 (Sloan 2019). To give a\nplausible account of embryological formation, vital properties\ntherefore had to be attributed to a specific kind of matter confined\nto living beings, the organic molecules, which had their own\ninherent dynamic and specifying properties. \nThe introduction of the concept of “vital” matter by\nBuffon, even with restrictions on its actions, represents an important\ndevelopment in the history of the life sciences of this period. It\nbroke with the uniformity of matter assumed by the Newtonian,\nGassendist, and Cartesian traditions, and in a limited way it\npositioned Buffon at the opening of the “vitalist”\nrevolution which initiated the first reflections on genuine species\ntransformism, even though Buffon himself never moved into this new\ndomain (Reill 2005: chp. 1). \nIn his original presentations, Buffon conceptualized these internal\nmolds and specifying organic molecules to have originated from divine\ncreation. As the Natural History progressed, however, Buffon\nincreasingly viewed the organic molecules to be formed from an\noriginal undifferentiated “brute” matter, and the internal\nmolds themselves were seen to arise spontaneously, obtaining their\nspecificity of action purely from the differential forces of\nattraction between different shapes of organic particles (Buffon\n“De la Nature. Seconde vue”, 1765, [OP, 38–41]). \nIt was following upon his proposed solution to the issue of organic\ngeneration that Buffon then addressed the issue of organic species and\ntheir permanence. In the fourth volume of the Natural History\n(1753), devoted to the large domestic quadrupeds, Buffon first raised\nthe option of species transformism, only to reject it. In the article\n“The Ass”, devoted to the domestic donkey, Buffon drew\nattention to the close anatomical similarity between the horse and the\nass, as revealed by his collaborator Daubenton’s anatomical\ndescriptions. This similarity strongly suggested an underlying unity\nof plan of all the quadrupeds, a similarity raising the possibility\nthat all quadrupeds might have been derived in historical time from a\nsingle stem (souche) which “in the succession of time,\nhas produced, by perfection and degeneration, all the other\nanimals” (Buffon 1753, [OP, 355]). In a move that has confused\ncommentators every since, Buffon then rejected this possibility and\ninstead argued that because of the infertility of hybrids, species\nmust have been distinct from the beginning. \nThe explanation of Buffon’s initial 1753 rejection of\ntransformism, and his subsequent development of proto-evolutionary\nviews as the Natural History progressed, has taken many forms\n(Bowler 2003: chp. 3; Lovejoy 1911 [1959]). The argument of this\narticle is that both Buffon’s initial rejection of transformism,\nand his subsequent development toward the acceptance of historical\nspecies change reflect a coherent and consistent development of his\nconcept of “physical truth” (see above\n Section 3.1).\n Drawing on his emphasis on serial recurrence as the foundation of\nphysical truth, the species is maintained in time and given its\nontological reality by the recurring passing on of the internal mold\nwhich shapes the organic molecules into a new organism in time. \nThis analysis implied for Buffon a significant redefinition of the\nconcept of an organic species, a redefinition that has affected the\ntradition of natural history and biology since the 1750s. Buffon\nexplicitly rejected the long-accepted meaning of ‘species’\nas a universal— or, in modern parlance, a class concept,\nconstituted by a set of individuals on the basis of possession of\nexplicit defining properties . This was the meaning implicit in the\nLinnaean classification of his time. This concept Buffon criticized as\nan “abstract” meaning of species. By contrast, Buffon\ndefined a species in natural history exclusively as the historical\nsuccession of ancestor and descendant linked by material connection\nthrough generation. Such a species is  \n… neither the number nor the collection of similar individuals\nwhich forms the species; it is the constant succession and\nuninterrupted renewal of these individuals which constitutes it.\n(Buffon 1753, [OP, 355])  \nThe empirical sign of this essential unity of the species over time is\nthe ability of its members to interbreed and produce fertile\noffspring, a criterion that takes precedence over similarities of\nanatomy or habits of life. The horse and ass must be two different\nspecies because they cannot interbreed and produce fertile offspring,\nwhatever may be their anatomical resemblances. The dogs, on the other\nhand, must, in spite of great morphological differences between\nbreeds, constitute one species because of their interfertility. \nIn setting forth this new meaning of ‘species’ in natural\nhistory, and distinguishing it from the alternative meaning of species\nas a logical universal, Buffon was doing more than distinguishing the\n“category” from the “taxon” as these terms\nhave come to be understood in contemporary philosophy of biology. In\nan important sense, Buffon introduced an opposition between\nthese two meanings of “species” found in the tradition\nreaching back to Aristotle (see\n Section 1.1\n above), granting “reality” in biology only to species\nconceived as material successions of individuals sharing in the same\ninternal mold spread out in time. By contrast, Buffon considered the\nunderstanding of species in the sense of a universal class concept as\n“abstract” and “artificial”. \nThis explicit opposition of two meanings of\n“species”introduced by Buffon, contrasting concepts\npreviously linked together by a complex relation of thought and world\nwithin the Aristotelian and Scholastic discussions, has been seen by\nsome commentators as marking the introduction of a fundamental\nconfusion over the conception of species in subsequent discussions in\nthe biological literature. This is at least one of the underlying\ncauses of the so-called “species problem”. In their\nhistorical extension, these issues continue to generate contemporary\ndisputes that oppose conceptions of “species as sets” to\nthose of “species as spatio-temporal individuals”\n(Dupré 1993; Ereshefsky (ed.) 1992; Ghiselin 1997; Hull 1999;\nR.A. Richards 2010; Sloan 2013; Stamos 2003; Wheeler & Meier (eds)\n2000; Wilkins 2009; R.A. Wilson (ed.) 1999; and the entry on\n species\n in this encyclopedia). \nThe subsequent developments in Buffon’s thought toward what an\nolder tradition of scholarship mistakenly interpreted to be\n“evolutionism”, involved the gradual broadening of his\nnatural-historical or “physical” species to include wider\nand wider degrees of material relationship. This expansion of his\noriginal species concept Buffon expressed in the language of a\n“degeneration” of forms in time in response to\nenvironmental conditions. \nThe encounter with a wide body of new data from the colonies and\nexploratory voyages returned to Paris during the course of the writing\nof the Natural History impressed Buffon with the degree to\nwhich species seemed to be affected by external circumstances such\nthat from a single source numerous “degenerations” could\narise in some groups. This formed the conceptual basis for his concept\nof a race as distinguished from a Linnaean Variety.\nA “race” in the Buffonian sense was a historical\ndegeneration from a common ancestor that maintained material and\nhistorical connection to this common source form. But this lineage\ncould undergo substantial and quasi-permanent hereditary\ndifferentiation into different lineages, with the cause of these\ndegenerations explained by slight changes in the organic molecules\nproduced by varying environmental circumstances as a given physical\nspecies migrates to new environments. These slight changes in turn\naffected the internal mold. Developed in greatest detail in his long\narticle, “On the Degeneration of Animals” in volume XIV\n(1766) of the Natural History, Buffon’s theory of the\ndegeneration of species extended so far as to allow the lumping of the\nquadrupeds of both the Old and New worlds into a limited number of\nprimary “families” (familles) and\n“genera” (genres) that from points of origin in\nthe Northern European hemisphere, degenerated in time in response to\nmigration to new locales. By including human beings in this\nnaturalistic scenario in his later writings, and assuming that human\nlineages underwent similar degenerative changes as they migrated from\ntheir postulated point of origin of human beings in the Caucasus,\nBuffon’s theory played a major role in the development of\nEnlightenment racial theory (Sloan 1973, 2014). \nBuffon subsequently made some steps toward combining the thesis of the\nhistorical degeneration of species with his theory of historical\ncosmology in Les (subsequently Des)\nÉpoques de la Nature, first published as a supplement\nto the Natural History in 1778. In this treatise he reworked\nhis earlier speculations on the “theory of the earth”,\nfirst set out in 1749, adding to this a historical chronology of the\nage of the earth determined experimentally in the 1770s by\nquantitative studies on cooling spheres of metal. In this imaginative\nsynthesis, and drawing on an allegorical reading of Genesis\n1, Buffon combined a history of the Earth with a historical sequence\nof the emergence of living forms (Buffon 1779). In doing so he\nexpanded the time scale of earth history considerably beyond the\naccepted “Mosaic” chronology of less than 10,000 years\nfrom the beginning of the world to the present, to an estimate of\napproximately 75,000 years in the published version, and over two\nmillion years in his draft manuscript. In this treatise Buffon offered\na naturalistic solution to the two inherited Cartesian dilemmas.\nFirst, his schema was offered as a realistic account. The Cartesian\nlanguage of counterfactualism has disappeared. Second, he integrated\nthe history of living forms into this comprehensive history of the\nworld. Further naturalizing his theory of the internal molds and\norganic molecules, both were now seen to arise by natural laws from\nthe natural attraction of different shapes of matter and from the\nchanges in matter as the earth cooled from its origin in matter cast\noff by the sun. Animals first originated by the spontaneous clumping\ntogether of these organic molecules on the cooling earth (Buffon 1779:\nFifth Epoch). \nThe Epochs also offered a schema for a historical sequence of\nforms in a series of six major “epochs” that were given\nprecise dates of duration. This begins with the origin of the earth\nfrom a cooled star, and then describes the beginning of living nature\nwith marine life and plants in the early stages of the earth’s\nhistory, terminating with present forms His account even suggested a\nnaturalistic origin of human beings, although this issue is left\nvague. Humankind appears, without explanation in the text, in a\nnon-paradisal state in the northern latitudes of Eurasia, surrounded\nby ferocious animals, earthquakes and floods, and in a primitive\nsocial condition that required collaboration for survival.\nBuffon’s liberal use of a form of spontaneous generation that\nallowed for the origin of even major animal groups from the clumping\ntogether of organic molecules as the earth cooled, rendered the actual\nderivation of forms from previous forms unnecessary. In several\nrespects, the development of genuine transformist theories by\nBuffon’s successors required a much more restricted use of the\npossibility of spontaneous generation. \nBeyond the confines of the Paris Jardin, the reflections\ninspired by Buffon in wider discussions of the late Enlightenment were\ncomplex. The reception of Buffon’s Des Époques de la\nNature, for example, was uneven (Roger “Introduction”\nin Buffon 1779, [1988, cxxiv]). The work was never translated into\nEnglish until recently (2018), and it seems to have played an\ninsignificant role in anglophone discussions, in contrast, for\nexample, to the major impact of the works of Linnaeus, which received\na wide British exposition and translation. The boldly speculative\ncharacter of the Epochs was also at odds with the new\nprofessionalized inquiries into geology and natural history undertaken\nby a younger generation of naturalists who may have adopted\nBuffon’s naturalism and extension of geochronology, but not his\ngrand rhetorical style (Rudwick 2005: chp. 3). \nHistorical research has shown, however, that the Epochs had\nan influential history in the Germanies (Schmitt, 2019). The treatise\nwas quickly (1781) translated into German at St. Petersburg and it\nseems to have played an important role in the development of German\nhistoricism (Reill 1992). Although linkages are in need of further\nscholarly research, the impact of Buffon’s Epochs on\nthe historical transformism sketched out a few years later by Johann\nGottfried Herder (1744–1803) in the first volume of his\nmagisterial Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der\nMenschheit (1784–91) is suggested by several lines of\nevidence (Zammito 2018a: 180–185, 2018b). \nHerder departed markedly from Buffon, however, in developing his own\nhistorical theory of the cosmos and the development of life, and\neventually of human culture, on a framework of teleological progress\nbased on a “vital” theory of matter. For Herder, not only\nthe individual organism, but nature as a whole develops under the\ncausation of an internal organic force that leads it to develop higher\nand higher stages of life, eventually resulting in the ultimate\ndevelopment of humankind in history. \nBy the early nineteenth century, one can follow several lines of\nreflection admitting some form of species transformism. In the\nGermanies, Herder’s reflections formed a major ingredient in the\ndevelopment of German Naturphilosophie and\n“Romantic” science that was expanded in the writings of\nJohann Goethe (1749–1832), Friederich Schelling\n(1775–1854), Gottfried Treviranus (1776–1837) and several\nothers who advocated some version of a historically progressive\nphilosophy of nature with at least the “development” if\nnot actual transformism of species in time (Zammito 2018a: chps.\n8,9,11; R. J. Richards 2002: chps. 2,3,8). In the British Isles in the\nsame period, the reflections in the second volume of his Zoonomia,\nor the Laws of Organic Life (1794–1796) of Erasmus Darwin\n(1731–1802), grandfather of Charles Darwin, offered a theory of\nspecies development based on a concept of dynamic living matter. With\nthe acknowledgment of these multiple lines of reflection on the\nissues, each of which can be followed out in detail, the institutional\ndevelopment of these discussions of species transformism in relation\nto geological history is most easily followed through their French\ndiscussions, and these French reflections were particularly important\nfor the early formation of Charles Darwin’s own theoretical\ndevelopments. \nBuffon’s leadership of the Jardin ended with his death\nin April of 1788 on the edge of the massive social, political and\nscientific changes that were to overtake France a year later. As the\nonly major scientific organization to survive the dismantling of all\nother institutions of privilege by the Convention in the summer of\n1793, the restructured Muséum national d’histoire\nnaturelle continued as the post-Revolutionary successor to the\nJardin du Roi (Blanckaert et al. (eds) 1997). In this new\nform, it provided an institutional context in which several aspects of\nBuffon’s grand undertaking in natural history were pursued in\nthe decades following his death (Corsi 1983 [1988: chp. 1]). In the\nRevolutionary context of the new Republic, the Muséum\nalso incorporated a new appreciation of the work of Linnaeus and the\nclassificatory enterprise he had inspired. Linnaeus had been admired\nand popularized by Jean Jacques Rousseau, and for Republican French\nbiology, Linnaeus and his descriptive approach to biology was often\nseen in favorable contrast to that of Buffon, which was viewed as a\nsymbol of the Ancien régime. The two leaders of\nnatural history in effect became for the French naturalists what\nGeorge Cuvier (1769–1832) later described as “two\nfounts” from which they jointly drew their inspiration. \nThe Revolutionary reorganization of the Jardin also created a\nnew kind of specialization of research within what had previously been\nconceived of as “natural history”. The reorganization of\n1793 established within the Muséum twelve separate\nChairs of equal status that gave specific individuals control over\nportions of the collections and the research work done within these\ndivisions, and in doing so instituted new disciplinary divisions into\nnatural history. “Mammals and Birds” were placed under\nEtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844). “Reptiles and\nFishes” were assigned to Buffon’s understudy Bernard de\nLacépède (1756–1825). “Human Anatomy”\nwas given to Antoine Portal (1742–1832). The creation of a new\nChair of Comparative Anatomy, with an attendant separate museum\nestablished in 1802, provided the position for the young Alsatian\nzoologist Georges Cuvier. The large conglomerate of forms, known\npreviously only as “Worms”, were placed under the control\nof Buffon’s one-time understudy Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de\nMonet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1744–1829). Other chairs in botany,\npaleontology, comparative physiology, and anthropology were\nestablished, or would be developed in the nineteenth century. All\nthese new institutional structures subdivided traditional\n“natural history”, and facilitated professionalized\ninquiries into specific areas of life science that related to the\nnature of species, the interpretations of the classificatory systems,\nand the history and biogeography of the earth (Corsi 1983 [1988: chp.\n1]; Appel 1987). \nIt is in this context, and through his position as the first holder of\nthe Chair of “Worms” (Vers) that Jean Baptiste de\nLamarck developed during his tenure the first coherent theory of\nspecies change over historical time, eventually known by the new\nterm—transformisme. Lamarck in many respects warrants\nthe claim to be the first genuine evolutionary thinker situated within\na professional scientific institution. \nLamarck’s theory of species transformism emerged gradually in\nhis annual Muséum lectures on the “animals\nwithout vertebrae” that commenced in 1794. As the new occupant\nof the Chair dedicated to this vast array of forms, Lamarck undertook\nin 1794 a massive reorganization of the Muséum\ncollections of these animals. To accomplish this, he adapted for their\ntaxonomic organization the method of arrangement of the plant groups\nhe had developed in his earlier work on French botany (1778), created\nduring his formative years when he worked in the Jardin as a\nbotanist. In this early botanical work he had ordered groups serially\nfrom most complex to most simple. Lamarck then adopted a similar\nmethod for his initial arrangement of the invertebrate groups of\nanimals. \nThis linear form of rearrangement of the classification of the\ninvertebrates then provided him with an empirical base from which his\ntransformist theory was developed (Burkhardt 1977). Expounded though\nhis annual Muséum lectures, Lamarck was able to\ndevelop these arguments against the wide array of collections of\ninvertebrate animals at the Muséum. \nIn view of the many interpretations of Lamarck’s views that have\nemerged since the most developed presentation of his theory in his\n1809 Philosophie Zoologique (Zoological Philosophy),\nthe primary features of Lamarck’s reflections need to be\ncarefully detailed. In most fundamental terms, his theory of species\nchange was tied to his reversal of the taxonomic ordering of\nforms originally presented in his early systematic arrangements. In\nhis original classifications, these groups were ordered in a linear\nseries that began with the most complex invertebrates forms\n(cephalopods) and terminated in the least organized (infusorians). By\n1800, Lamarck decided that this ordering was artificial, and that the\n“natural” arrangement was from simple to complex. The\nevolutionary theory he subsequently developed involved the claim that\nthis new order of arrangement was also the historical\nsequence by which forms had been generated one from another over\ntime. \nThese novel conclusions were first presented in the\nMuséum lectures of 1800, and then were developed in\nmore detail in print in his Recherches sur l’organisation\ndes corps organisés (1802), with the full exposition in\nhis Philosophie zoologique (1809). His theoretical\nconclusions were also concretely displayed in the arrangement of\nspecimens in the main zoology gallery of the Muséum\nover which he had primary control. Some further significant\nelaborations of his ideas were then expressed in his many articles for\nthe second edition of Joseph Virey’s Nouveau dictionnaire\nd’histoire naturelle (extracted in Lamarck 1817–19\n[1991]), and in the long introductory discourse to his major work of\ntaxonomic revision of the invertebrates, the Histoire naturelle\ndes animaux sans vertèbres (1815–22). The following\nclaims formed the core of his mature theory: \nRevisions of the third point constitute the most significant change in\nthese five points after 1809, although the connection of these changes\nto Lamarck’s original theory of transformism remains unclear.\nBoth in the diagram supplied as an Appendix to Part I of the\nPhilosophie Zoologique (1809) and in the Introductory\nDiscourse to the later Histoire naturelle des animaux sans\nvertèbres (1815), Lamarck presented a branching image of\ngroup development. Likely responding to criticisms by his younger\ncolleague Georges Cuvier that were directed at the concept of linear\nrelationships of groups (see below), Lamarck admitted a more complex\nbranching pattern of group relations, with some showing independent\nlineages and even different points of origin. This issue was not,\nhowever, developed in any theoretical elaboration by Lamarck himself,\nand has not had significant impact on the historical understanding of\nLamarckianism. Some of these elements in Lamarck’s later theory\ndid, however, have some impact on British readings (Sloan 1997). \nWithin the confines of the Muséum, parallel, if not\nimmediately continuous, developments of related issues bearing on\nspecies transformism were made by Lamarck’s younger colleague\nand holder of the chair of Mammals and Birds, the comparative\nanatomist Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire (1772–1844). Less\nconcerned with the issue of species transformism than with the\nimplications of comparative anatomy for the relations of forms,\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire explored the anatomical “unity of\ntype”—the remarkable resemblance of anatomical structure\nbetween organisms revealed by comparative anatomy. Pursuing this issue\nin his Muséum lectures and in several papers, Geoffroy\nSt. Hilaire proceeded to work out the implications of the inner\nanatomical similarities of vertebrates. Based upon two main\nprinciples, the “principle of connection” and the\n“law of balance”, Geoffroy St. Hilaire drew attention to\nthe implications of comparative anatomy for the unity of the animal\nkingdom. In the mid-1820s, Geoffroy St. Hilaire developed a more\nhistorical position on the relation of the unity of type to issues of\nthe fossil record and to the development of life (Le Guyader 1998\n[2004: chp. 4]). \nBy 1823, Geoffroy St. Hilaire had extended his theory of the\n“unity of type” to the claim that even the invertebrates\nshared a common plan with the vertebrates, and by 1825 he had embraced\na limited version of transformism. This led him into direct opposition\nto the claims of his one-time friend and colleague, Georges Cuvier,\nholder of the chair of Comparative Anatomy. Cuvier’s researches\nin comparative anatomy and paleontology led him to conclude that\nanimals were formed on a series of four distinct and autonomous body\nplans (embranchments) that may display some unity of type\nwithin the embranchments, but not between these plans. This\nwas the mainstay of Cuvier’s opposition to transformism, and it\nserved as a powerful source of opposition to transformism into the\nDarwinian era. \nThese conflicts over the “unity of type” underlie the\n“great debate” that broke out in French life science in\nthe late 1820s between Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier and their\nrespective disciples (Appel 1987). This debate also forms one of the\nhistoric encounters between differing conceptions of biology that\naffected many aspects of nineteenth-century life science. It drew\ndivision lines within French, and even British, biology over the\nrelation of organisms to history, and it directly engaged the\npossibility of species change. This debate also served to focus issues\nwithin French life science in a way that significantly affected the\nlater negative French reception of Darwin’s work. This debate\neventually was to involve issues of paleontology, comparative anatomy,\ntransformism of species, and the relation of form to function. \nCuvier’s arguments, reinforced by the authority he carried in\nFrench comparative anatomy and science generally, resulted in the\ndominance of his positions within the Paris Académie des\nsciences. Nonetheless, the tradition of Geoffroy St. Hilaire\nremained a strong current within the Muséum. It was\ncontinued by such individuals as Antoine Etienne Serres\n(1786–1868), whose arguments for a historical sequence of forms,\nbacked by embryological evidence, were canonized in morphological\ncircles as the Meckel-Serres law of recapitulation (Gould 1977: chp.\n3). Outside official Academic French science, Geoffroy Saint\nHilaire’s theories had broad appeal to those who saw the\nrelevance of developmental embryology for issues of group\nrelationship, an issue that Cuvier, as a moderate preformationist, had\nignored. Present interest in the relationship between evolution and\ndevelopmental biology—commonly termed\n“evo-devo”— has stimulated new attention to Geoffroy\nSt. Hilaire’s views (Le Guyader 1998 [2004]). \nDiscussions of transformism in the British Isles in the pre-Darwinian\nperiod were influenced particularly by the French reflections and the\nFrench debates taking place at the Muséum, following\nthe cessation of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814–15 when extensive\nnew contacts developed between French and British scientists. In\naddition to French reflections, there were also important\nintroductions of German progressive developmentalism that entered\nBritish science in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The\nrecognition of these Continental transportations to the British Isles,\nparticularly in medical contexts, has supplied a new framework for\nunderstanding the reflections on species change in Britain in the\nperiod before the advent of Darwin’s work (Rupke 2009; R.J.\nRichards 2002; Sloan 2007, 2003, 1992; Desmond 1989). \nThe Edinburgh comparative anatomist, Robert Edmond Grant\n(1793–1874), played an important role in introducing the French\ndiscussions into the British Isles. He would also serve as Charles\nDarwin’s first mentor in science when Darwin was a young medical\nstudent at the University of Edinburgh (1825–27). Grant was\ndirectly engaged with the issues being debated at the time between\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, Cuvier and Lamarck, and he advocated a variant\nof a Lamarckian-Geoffroyean transformism in his writings, themes\nexpounded in his lectures on comparative anatomy at the new University\nCollege, London where he became the first professor of comparative\nanatomy in 1827 (Desmond 1989). \nTo this Grantian tradition was also added a strong input of German\nphilosophy of nature which entered British discussions in the 1820s,\nexpounded particularly in the Hunterian Lectures in Comparative\nAnatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons, delivered by the British\nsurgeon Joseph Henry Green (1791–1863). Green imported into his\nlectures several dimensions of Schelling’s\nNaturphilosophie which he used to develop a dynamic theory of\nspecies relation which synthesized the work of Lamarck, Cuvier, and\nthe University of Göttingen medical theorist Johann Blumenbach\n(1752–1840 (Sloan 2007). These themes would be continued in the\nmajor series of lectures delivered by Green’s\nprotégé at the College of Surgeons, the comparative\nanatomist, Richard Owen (1804–92), holder of the prestigious\nHunterian Chair in Comparative Anatomy from 1837 to 1856 (Rupke 1994,\n1993; Sloan (ed.) 1992). Owen’s widely-attended lectures between\n1837 and 1856 brought many of the issues of anatomy, biology, and\nembryology to bear on the questions of species relationship and\nchange. \nIn these lectures and his published writings, Owen developed a\nreinterpretation of the significance of the Cuvier-Geoffroy dispute\nand brought it to bear on the issues of the historical development of\nforms. It is also in these lectures that Owen posed the theory of the\narchetypal vertebrate in his Hunterian lectures in 1845, a theme he\nelaborated in an important set of publications in 1847 and 1848.\nEmploying aspects of William Whewell’s philosophy of science to\ndevelop these arguments, Owen expounded the theory of the unity of\ntype in relation to Cuvierian form and function through the positing\nof an ideal archetypal form. This abstraction functioned for Owen both\nas a transcendental idealization similar to a Platonic form, and also\nas an immanent law working in matter, conceived on the analogy of a\nNewtonian law, which governed the development of forms in time (Sloan\n2003; R. J. Richards 2002: chp. 14; Rupke 1993). By means of this\ntheory, Owen claimed he could coherently explain both the deep\nresemblance of forms in their internal anatomy— the theme\nemphasized by Geoffroy St. Hilaire—, and also the close fitting\nof structure and function to the organism’s “conditions of\nexistence”, the insight emphasized by Cuvier. \nTo distinguish these two meanings of relationship, Owen introduced\ninto the literature a crucial distinction between resemblances of\n“homology”, meaning the presence of the “same”\nparts in every variety of form and function—Geoffroyean\nrelationships—and those of “analogy”, denoting\nsolely the similarity of parts in their functional\nadaptations—Cuvierian relationships. Developing this concept of\nhomology in relation to his theory of the archetype, Owen claimed he\ncould at last give a coherent meaning to the concept of\n“sameness” in anatomical relationships. Furthermore, as\nOwen developed this theory in relation to his work on the fossil\nrecord, the theory of the archetype, conceived also as an immanent law\nworking in history, led Owen to embrace a concept of branching and\ndiversifying relations of forms as divergences from this ideal\narchetypal form over time. Owen thus broke with the linear historical\nprogressionism from simple to complex assumed in transformist theories\nlike those of Lamarck, particularly in Lamarck’s writings before\n1815. He also distinguished this kind of historical relationship from\nthat advocated by some of the German proto-transformists who developed\ntheir ideas on linear models. \nOn the other hand, Owen’s model cannot be considered genuine\nspecies transformism—species do not change historically one into\nanother and the archetype exists in one sense as a quasi-Newtonian\n“law” governing development in time rather than as an\nactual historical form. Nonetheless, his integration of comparative\nanatomy, paleontology, and even embryology into this framework set out\na sophisticated model of relationship that was later reinterpreted by\nDarwin from the viewpoint of his theory of material derivation from\ncommon historical ancestors. \nOn a more popular level, species transformism was broadly popularized\nin pre-Darwinian Anglophone discussions by the appearance in 1844 of\nthe grand evolutionary cosmology put forth anonymously by the Scottish\npublisher Robert Chambers (1802–71) in his immensely popular\nVestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a work which in\nmany respects prepared Victorian society in England, as well as\npre-Civil War America, for Darwin’s more restricted theory of\n1859 (Secord 2000). More similar to Buffon’s Epochs of\nNature and to speculations of Herder than to the writings of\nLamarck, Chambers proposed an evolutionary schema that began with the\nnebular beginnings of the cosmos and moved in a teleological direction\nup to humanity, with a broad evolution of species up the chain of\nbeing. In this grand schema he incorporated insights from French\nzoology and geological progressionism, with all of this working under\nthe actions of one great unifying natural law. This vision was further\npopularized by its incorporation into Alfred Lord Tennyson’s\nepic poem In Memoriam (1850). In spite of the popularity of\nChamber’s work, which went through eleven editions by the end of\nthe nineteenth century and sold more copies than Darwin’s\nOrigin of Species, the British scientific community was\nessentially unanimous in its rejection of Chamber’s\nspeculations. In many ways this opposition to the Vestiges by\nleading members of the Victorian scientific establishment formed one\nprimary source of professional resistance to the later Darwinian\ntheory (see entry on\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man,\n Section 3). \nA more philosophically influential developmental evolutionism was also\nadvocated in pre-Darwinian England by the British railway engineer and\npublic intellectual, Herbert Spencer (1820–1903). Influenced\nboth by the expositions of Lamarckianism by Charles Lyell in the\nsecond volume of his Principles of Geology (1830–33),\nby the writings of Karl Ernst von Baer on embryological development,\nand also by Richard Owen’s Hunterian Lectures on the osteology\nof the vertebrate skeleton, which Spencer attended in 1851 (Rupke\n1994: 206), Spencer entered the British discussions of transformism in\n1852 with his endorsement of the “development hypothesis”\n(Spencer 1852). This initiated his broad reflections on the\nlaw-governed evolution of society and humanity, developed in detail in\nsuch works as First Principles, published in 1862 (Haines\n1988). Prior to the use of the term by Darwin, Spencer spoke of the\n“evolution” of life and the cosmos from material\nbeginnings, with species changing as a result of the operation of\nnatural forces. It was also from Spencer that Darwin borrowed the\ndesignator “survival of the fittest” as a synonym for his\nown “natural selection” in the fifth edition of the\nOrigin of Species in 1869. Although Spencer’s First\nPrinciples appeared after the publication of Darwin’s\nOrigin, Spencer’s transformism was developed generally\nindependently of Darwin’s work and shows closest affinity with\nthe reflections of Lamarck, Chambers, and the historical\ndevelopmentalism of Owen. \nSpencer, rather than Darwin, has often been seen as the primary\ntheoretician of “social” Darwinism in the late nineteenth\nand early twentieth centuries (Hofstadter 1944 [1955]; see also the\nentry on\n Herbert Spencer).\n Spencer’s world-wide influence even made his works a vehicle by\nwhich Darwinism was first introduced into non-Western discussions (Jin\n2019; Lightman (ed.) 2016; Elshakry 2013; Pusey 1983). This unusual\njuxtapositioning of Spencer and Darwin is explored in the entry\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man\n (Section 3.1). \nThe long historical scenario summarized in the present entry has\nsought to display the complexity of transformism in biology in the\nperiod prior to the advent of Darwinism. It was against this complex\nbackground that Darwin would develop his own theory on the origin and\ndiversification of forms. He would draw in many ways on these\npre-existing discussions in French and even German sources. Further\nexploration of this will be made in the entry\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man.","contact.mail":"sloan.1@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
