The negative dialectics of the Middle Way\n(madhyamaka) is the centerpiece of the Geluk intellectual\ntradition and is the philosophy that is commonly held in Tibet to\nrepresent the highest view. The Middle Way, a philosophy systematized\nin the second century by Nāgārjuna, seeks to chart a\n“middle way” between the extremes of essentialism and\nnihilism with the notion of two truths: the ultimate truth of\nemptiness and the relative truth of dependent existence. The Geluk\nschool’s unique presentation of the Consequence School\n(prāsaṅgika) of the Middle Way—a\ntradition that does not build foundational epistemological systems,\nbut affirms existence merely in terms of transactional usage –\nis a hallmark of its philosophy.\n\n\n\nThe Geluk interpretation of the Middle Way offers a unique\npresentation of the Buddhist doctrine of two truths: the ultimate\ntruth and conventional (or relative) truth. Geluk philosophy primarily\naims to overcome reifications of the ultimate truth and denials of\nconventional truths, as conventional existence and ultimate\nnonexistence are intimately bound together. In this tradition, the\nrelationship between the two truths is said to be “essentially\nthe same but conceptually distinct” (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa\ntha dad). That is, the two truths are not really different, but\ncan be distinguished conceptually, like an impermanent phenomenon and\na product. The following two claims characterize the Geluk\nschool’s distinctive interpretation of the two truths: (1) to\nexist is to be empty and (2) to exist is to exist conventionally (see\nChangkya in Cozort 1998, 429). \n\nThe ultimate truth has no positive content in the Geluk tradition;\nit is simply the lack of essence in any phenomena: “The ultimate\ntruth is posited as solely the negation of truth [that is, inherent\nexistence] upon a subject that is a basis of negation…”\n(Tsongkhapa, 396). Thus, no ultimate truth is affirmed (or rather,\nnothing is claimed to exist ultimately). This lack of essence in phenomena, or\n“emptiness,” does not annul their appearance. Rather,\nemptiness is held to be the condition for the possibility for any\nappearance. To be empty means to arise dependently—to lack\nindependent, real existence. Since nothing can be found to be\nindependent, everything is said to be empty. Thus, in the Geluk\ntradition, emptiness is the nature of all phenomena (or their\nlack of independent nature), and all phenomena are necessarily\nempty. \n\nThe ultimate truth is said to be emptiness because things are not\nfound to exist separate from their parts, causes, or designations; this\nnon-finding itself is the meaning of emptiness. Emptiness, too, is not\n“found” when sought (emptiness is empty, too). To be found\n(when an ultimate essence is sought) is to be intrinsically or\nultimately real, and nothing has this status for the Geluk tradition,\nnot even emptiness. \n\nEmptiness is interpreted in the Geluk tradition as a non-implicative\nnegation (med dgag). As opposed to a negation that implies\nsomething else, a non-implicative negation is simply an absence, such\nas a lack of true existence. This mere lack or absence, as a negation\nof essence that implies nothing, is the meaning of the ultimate truth\nin the Geluk tradition. Nevertheless, the claim that there is nothing\nultimately true—or that the ultimate truth is\n“emptiness,” a null set—is a (conventional) truth,\nnot a truth ultimately, because nothing is ultimately true. Thus,\nconventional truths are the only types of affirmative truths there are\n(other than the absence of true existence) (Jinpa 2002, 46–48). \n\nThe summit of Geluk philosophy is the Consequence School. The\nConsequence School is a branch of the Middle Way tradition that\nradically undermines any and all foundations. The Consequence School\ngets its name from the form of reductio argument used to\ndemonstrate emptiness, in contrast to formal (autonomous)\narguments. According to Tsongkhapa, a formal argument for emptiness is\nnot able to convey the meaning of emptiness (to someone who has not\nunderstood it) because formal arguments presuppose essences. That is,\na formal argument presumes that a subject matter is objective or\ngiven, and this cannot be the case, particularly when an anti-realist\n(who understands emptiness) and a realist (who lacks an understanding\nof emptiness) engage in dialogue (Changkya in Cozort 1998, 451). This is\nbecause a proponent of the Consequence School consents to no such\ngiven, objective facts. \n\nFor the Consequence School, a valid argument for emptiness, like\n“the table is empty because it is dependent,” is not an\nobjective truth. The reason for this is simply because there are no\nobjective truths; there is nothing given. That is, the rules of logic,\neven when followed, are just rules without any intrinsic reality or\nobjective status to ground their truth outside those rules (Jinpa 2002,\n63–69). Moreover, perception is not foundational in this system.\nNeither perception nor inference is foundational in the Middle Way:\nperceptions validate inferences and inferences validate perceptions;\nneither has priority as both simply function to sustain a consensual\nreality. \n\nBy invoking consensus as the mark of (conventional) reality, the Geluk\nschool’s coherence theory of truth anticipates some of the insights of\nthe later Wittgenstein (see Thurman 1980). There are no foundations in\nthe Geluk tradition, neither ultimate nor conventional; there is only\ntransactional usage—“what is renowned in the world.”\nThus, unlike some other Middle Way philosophies, like the Autonomy\nSchool (svātantrika), there is no “correct”\nor “incorrect” relative truth, for no independent means\nexists that could verify a truth claim to be a “correct”\nrelative truth. “What works” is the criterion; that is,\nwhat conforms to the ways of the world is a conventional truth in the\nway that a game works when you subscribe to its rules. Any further\nnotion of a “correct” relative implicates a foundation, an\nessentialist presumption about the way things are (Changkya 1998, 321;\nBötrül 2011, 141). Therefore, the measure of what is correct is\nsimply what conforms to the world rather than based on any other\nwarrant that would serve as a deeper structure or more fundamental\nlayer of reality beyond what is simply conventional (Cozort 1998, 52). \n\nA key point to Tsongkhapa’s Consequence School is that nothing exists\non its own even conventionally (Tsongkhapa 1988, 585). Thereby, there\nis no need to ground conventions in any deeper foundation. Without the\nneed for conventional foundations—like a foundational\nconsciousness or self-awareness—there is no need for ultimate\nfoundations, either, as if a real ultimate were needed to ground\nunreal conventions. When there is nothing but groundless\nconventions—all the way up and all the way down—the\nultimate and the conventional are no longer separate; the two truths\nare none other than two aspects of the same thing. Thereby, the two\ntruths are not only without contradiction, but are mutually\nsupportive, and this is a key to Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of the\nConsequence School of the Middle Way. \n\nAnother essential point of Tsongkhapa’s Consequence School is that\ndistinctions within the conventional—between truth and falsity,\nexistence and non-existence, real and unreal—are not objective;\nthat is, they are not determined from objects themselves. Conventional\ndistinctions between what is real and unreal are made in terms of the\nworld. That is to say, these distinctions are not made based on any\nreal differences in objects themselves; rather, what constitutes what\nis real and unreal is intersubjective. Significantly, what is\nintersubjective necessarily incorporates a subjective dimension. \n\nOne might think that if objective distinctions are not accepted in the\nConsequence School, then this position would be not different from the\nsubjective idealism of the reviled “Mind-Only”\nschool. Rather than claim that the mind is independently real in\ncontrast to unreal external objects, like a subjective idealist, a\nproponent of the Middle Way explicitly affirms the interdependency of\nminds and objects. Following Candrakīrti, a nineteenth-century\nscholar, Künzang Sönam (1823–1905), unpacks\nTsongkhapa’s interpretation when he describes how minds and\nexternal objects are equally existent in worldly convention (and in\nAbhidharma) and equally nonexistent when their nature is sought in\nanalysis (and in a sublime being’s meditative equipoise). He goes on\nto show how external objects are accepted conventionally in the\nConsequence School because the coextensive presence and absence of\nobjects and cognitions undermines the claim that even conventionally\nthere are no external objects. That is, when there are external\nobjects, there are internal cognitions, and when there are internal\ncognitions, there are external objects; cognitions and objects are\npaired and thus rise and fall together. He reiterates this point by\nsaying that not only does no conventional analysis negate external\nobjects, but that conventional analysis undermines the absence of\nexternality (Künzang 2007, 706-707). \n\nElaborating on the difference between the Middle Way and Mind-Only,\nKünzang Sönam says that “the distinction of whether or\nnot external objects are asserted or not conventionally comes down to\nthe acceptance of something existing on its own (rang mtshan gyis\ngrub pa).” This is the main issue for Tsongkhapa’s\nunique interpretation of the Consequence and undergirds his claims. He\nargues that proponents of Mind-Only are not satisfied with assenting\nto the external world as it is proclaimed by the world; they think\nthat if there were external objects, they would have to be the types\nof things that would be findable upon analysis, and existing\nseparately from cognition. Yet since there are no such things, they\ndeny them. The Consequence School, in contrast, asserts external\nobjects without these criteria, namely, without there being any\nobjective basis of designation for these claims. Thus, proponents of\nthe Consequence School simply assent to external objects in accord\nwith the ways of the world, and this is due to the fact that they do\nnot accept anything existing on its own (rang mtshan gyis grub\npa), neither an external or an internal world, even\nconventionally (Künzang 2007, 707). \n\nKünzang Sönam clarifies Tsongkhapa’s claim that\nexternal objects are asserted in the Consequence School by arguing\nthat it is not at all like the assertions of those who come to affirm\nexternal objects based on ontological analysis. This is because the\nConsequence School rejects the kind of realism that is implicated by\nthe acceptance of an analytically determined external world. Rather,\nexternal objects are simply accepted (conventionally) in the\nConsequence School in accord with the ways of the world, without\n(ontological) analysis (Künzang 2007, 707). \n\nThere is a subtle distinction to be made here that can easily be\noverlooked.  One might think that since the external world is affirmed\nin the Consequence School, then it is one that accepts external\nrealism. Perhaps some in the Geluk tradition may fall into this camp,\nbut this need not be the case when the affirmation of an external\nworld is understood as an assertion that is made from her own\nperspective as to the status of an external world in reality. Rather,\nit is simply a claim that conforms to intersubjective agreement\ndetermined by mundane convention. In any case, ultimately there is no\nexternal world for the Consequence School, so while they may not be\nidealists, they are certainly not external realists, either.  That is,\nproponents of the Consequence School are not external realists despite\nclaiming the reality of an external world because they acknowledge\nthat the external world does not stand on its own, even\nconventionally; like minds and objects, an external world rises and\nfalls together with an internal world. \n\nWhile the “foundational consciousness” (kun gzhi rnam\nshes) and self-awareness (rang rig) are keystones for\nidealist systems of Buddhist philosophy to get beyond what is merely\nconventional, the Consequence School does not follow suit. In fact,\nfoundationalists and idealists that deny the reality of an external\nworld are targets of the Consequence School. The Consequence School\nsquarely rejects idealism. It does not assent to any independent means\nto verify the claims of idealism (or physicalism for that\nmatter). Rather than denying an external world, external objects are\nacknowledged to exist as long as internal minds are counterposed with\nthem. Thus, neither objects nor minds have a privileged status in this\ntradition. \n\nSelf-awareness (rang rig), as distinct from\nobject-awareness (gzhan rig), ascribes to the mental a unique\nway that a mind knows itself, a way that is different from the way a\nmind knows any other object. Geluk scholars deny any special status to\nself-awareness; the mind is simply a dependently arisen phenomenon,\njust like any other one. Moreover, nothing appears the way it really is\nto an ordinary being (Jamyang Zhepa in Hopkins 2003, 930). For this\nreason, this philosophy does not partake in ordinary phenomenology.\nInstead, it is primarily concerned with critical ontology, or what we\ncould call a form of “ontological deflationism,” in that it\naims to undermine the foundations of the entire ontological project\n(MacKenzie 2008, 197).  \n\nIn the Geluk tradition, self-awareness is rejected as a notion that\nattributes to the mind a special status as an independently existent\nentity, and this idea is seen as one that hypostasizes the mind. One\nreason for this is that a unique, first-personal access to\nself-awareness, being simply given in experience, presumes that there\nare grounds for immediate access to truth, and nothing has that status\nfor Tsongkhapa. For his Geluk tradition, conventional truths are always\nmediated and contingent. Geluk scholars argue that self-awareness,\nunderstood as a form of epistemologically primary, private knowledge,\nis not necessary to account for mind and memory. They do not entertain\nthe notion of self-awareness understood phenomenologically either, as\nsome sort of nonthetic, intransitive cognition, as this concept is seen\nas simply another reification.  Moreover, such a notion offers no\nexplanatory power in the realms of either the conventional or ultimate\ntruth.  \n\nNot only does Tsongkhapa deny the existence of self-awareness, but\nalso the notion of a “foundational consciousness” separate\nfrom mental consciousness. The foundational consciousness is another\nBuddhist concept that often serves as a substrate for the self, one\nthat reifies personal identity. The notion of the foundational\nconsciousness is an attempt for Buddhists to account for personal\ncausality without affirming a real self. Tsongkhapa dispenses with this\nnotion of a substrate consciousness and sees it as simply another\nreification, another conceptually constructed essence that masquerades\nas the primary reality of the self. Instead of a foundational\nconsciousness, Tsongkhapa posits “the entity of\ndisintegration” (zhig pa’i dngos po) to account for\ncausality (Hopkins 2003, 934–35). The “entity of\ndisintegration” is his attempt to offer a coherent causal process\nin the absence of real entities. \n\nThe impetus for the theory of the entity of disintegration, or so it\nseems, is to provide an account for causality in the absence of\nfoundations. That is, disintegration is said to function like other\nentities in the absence of real entities. With no real entities, an\nentity’s disintegration—which is typically held within Buddhist\nphilosophical systems to be a non-entity—is thus attributed with\nthe same status as an efficacious entity (nominal). That is, both an\nentity and its disintegration are nothing more than nominal\ndesignations. While injecting disintegration with causal power is an\nattempt to preserve a nominalist theory of causality, this theory\ninvites other problems, such as the reification of absence (i.e.,\ntreating emptiness as a “thing”), which has been a\nfrequent target for critics of the Geluk tradition.\n\n \n\nAlong with positing the entity of disintegration, among the unique\nfeatures of the Consequence School are that the foundational\nconsciousness and self-awareness are not only denied ultimate\nexistence, but are held to not exist even conventionally.\nConventional truths are always subject to rational analysis; when their\nconventional status is analyzed, no such self-awareness or foundational\nconsciousness is analytically found, and when analyzed in terms of\ntheir ultimate status, they are found to be groundless like every other\nphenomenon. Tsongkhapa claims that the denial of true existence\neven conventionally is a unique feature of the Consequence School\n(Cozort 1998, 60). This is because he holds that the claim to uncover a\ndeeper foundation of conventional existence beyond transactional truth\nis a back door to essentialist ultimate presuppositions. Thus,\nnot only ultimate foundations, but even conventional\nfoundational theories are repudiated in his Consequence School. \n\nDespite the important role of absence in the Geluk tradition,\nemptiness—the absence of essence—does not refer to total negation,\nbut refers in particular to the negation of the ultimate\nstatus of a phenomenon. That is, conventional phenomena are denied\nexistence ultimately, not conventionally. Significantly, the denial of\nself, too, does not mean the denial of the “mere self”\n(bdag tsam), or the conventionally existent self (Jinpa 2002, 71).\nThe mere self (trimmed away of metaphysical baggage or conceptual\nreification) is unapologetically affirmed by the Geluk tradition. That\nis, the characteristically Buddhist denial of self is interpreted to\nrefer only to mistaken conceptions of self – such as that of a\npermanent, singular, or truly existing entity – not the self\nsimpliciter. The mere self, like the mere table or\nchair (i.e., the table or chair apprehended without the overlay of true\nexistence), is unequivocally claimed to exist. Conventional\nexistence, what undeniably functions within the transactional world, is\nnot negated. Rather, it is reification or true existence that is\ndenied. \n\nThe Geluk tradition’s unapologetic affirmation of conventional\nreality, including the self, is a point of contention with other\nschools, who argue that their philosophy simply affirms the status quo\nand thus cannot accommodate a means to revise or transform the world or\none’s relation to it. Yet the Geluk tradition holds that it is\nprecisely the denial of essences, which are superimposed on the\nconventional world or elsewhere, that leads to true transformation and\nliberation. \n\nIt is important to recognize how Geluk philosophy is embedded within a\ndistinctively Buddhist soteriology. That is, the truth of no-self is\nliberating because understanding this is held to free one from the\nmistaken idea of a self that binds one to suffering. Knowledge of\nemptiness is key to this emancipatory process, as Tsongkhapa claims,\nfor one must realize the emptiness of the Consequence School, the lack\nof true essence, to be free from the subtle sense of self and achieve\nnirvāṇa (Cozort 1998, 316). For the Geluk tradition, there is no\nhigher view than just the emptiness in the Consequence School, and\nthis view is also maintained to be a prerequisite for the esoteric\npractices of tantra. Tantra is an important part of the path to\nliberation in the Geluk tradition. It is a path to liberation that is\nheld to involve distinct, esoteric methods, but without diverging from\nthe philosophical view of emptiness, which is indispensible. For this\nreason, Geluk philosophy is located squarely within the exoteric\ndomain of discourse: the intersubjective spaces of dialogue and\ndebate. \n\nTherefore, rather than overcoming mistaken concepts by circumventing\nthem in a mystical flash of insight or an ecstatic experience of union,\nthe Geluk tradition offers a more sober way to overcome misconceptions,\none based on clear, rational analysis. That is, this tradition holds\nreasoned analysis to be necessary to understand the nature of phenomena\n(or rather, their lack of nature). This is because an\nascertainment of the lack of true existence is held to be necessary to\ncounteract the directly opposed notion – the apprehension of true\nexistence—which is the misinterpretation of reality (as more than\nsimply conventionally existing) that binds one to suffering. To do\nthis, it is not sufficient to simply “let be,” stare into\nspace, or ignore the cause of misinterpretation in some tranquil\n“nonconceptual” meditation; rather, one must have insight\ninduced by reason that counteracts the habit of holding onto true\nexistence. \n\nThus, in Geluk philosophy, we can say that meaning is limited to\nintelligibility. That is, insight into reality is not held to be beyond\nthought, or attributed to some third category beyond the world that is\nneither existent nor nonexistent, but is simply insight into a world\nthat is neither (ultimately) existent nor (conventionally) nonexistent.\nEven though Geluk scholars consent to the fact that emptiness can be\nperceived nonconceptually—in the rarified case of a highly developed\nmeditation – they maintain that the emptiness that is known\nnonconceptually is no different from the emptiness that is conceptually\nknown. It is the conceptual ascertainment of emptiness that is\nthe principal element of the Geluk school’s philosophy. Moreover,\ntheir emphasis on the practice of insight is not based on an appeal to\na direct, unmediated access to what is beyond concepts, but to\nreason. Reason is also given priority over scriptural authority,\nwhich is subjected to the scrutiny of analysis and is adjudicated by\nreason (Tsongkhapa in Hopkins 1999, 71). \n\nFollowing Tsongkhapa, the Geluk tradition came to establish large\nmonastic institutions that set the standard for scholastic education\nin Tibet. The curriculum at Geluk monastic institutions involves five\nprimary topics: metaphysics (abhidharma), epistemology\n(pramāṇa), negative dialectics\n(madhyamaka), path structure\n(Abhisamayālaṃkāra), and ethics\n(vinaya). Buddhist metaphysics instills the contours of a\nBuddhist view, including causality, impermanence, and an\nevent-metaphysics that ties these two together. The path structure\nalso plays a central role in traditional Buddhist philosophy: it\nprovides the philosophy with a telos, a narrative arch toward\nliberation and complete enlightenment. Ethics, too, is integral to\nthis path and to Buddhist philosophy in general, but the most\ndistinctive and interesting features of Geluk philosophy are found in\nits epistemology, and in particular, negative dialectics.  \n\nGeluk monks who train in philosophy study epistemology early in\ntheir careers, and debate is a primary means by which this tradition is\ninternalized and enacted. Buddhist epistemology, as codified in\nDharmakīrti’s Commentary on Valid Cognition\n(Pramāṇavārttika), lays out a systematic\npresentation of the means of knowledge and the rules for valid\ninference.  Dharmakīrti’s epistemology can be said to\nbe antirealist or conceptualist, in that he denies that language\ndirectly relates to the contents of perception, which are ineffable\nparticulars. Yet to account for the relationship between real\nparticulars and unreal universals, the Geluk tradition develops what\nhas been dubbed a “semi-realist” position, whereby it\nasserts that there are universals that are real entities in contrast to\nthe anti-realism that denies that universals are entities (Dreyfus 1997,\n173).  \n\nStraddling the delicate line between a realist view that affirms the\nreality of universals and an antirealist one that denies the reality of\nconcepts, a Geluk account of epistemology holds that universals are\nreal, but that they do not exists separately from their particular\ninstances. For instance, the universal “cow” and the\nparticular instances of cow are held to be not utterly distinct, as\nantirealists would have it, nor are they held to be the same, as a\nstrict realist would claim, but are rather said to be\n“essentially the same but conceptually distinct” (Dreyfus 1997,\n174–78). This relationship – of neither complete identity nor\nutter difference—is an important part of the way the Geluk account\nfor the relationship between the two truths, as we saw above in their\ndescription of the negative dialectics of the Middle Way. In the\nepistemological context, articulating this relationship is an attempt\nto account for the efficacy of concepts without giving universals an\nautonomous existence apart from their instances.   Yet since\nthe Geluk tradition claims that Dharmakīrti’s\nepistemological project represents an inferior philosophical position,\narguably studied for didactic purposes, we need not dwell further on\nthis thorny, scholastic topic. It is the nominalism of what Geluk\nauthors consider their own tradition—the view of the Consequence\nSchool of the Middle Way—that is the hallmark of their\nphilosophy.","contact.mail":"douglas.duckworth@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
