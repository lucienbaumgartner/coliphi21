One question is central to his theoretical philosophy.\nIt arises from the metaphysical assertions of earlier\n“rationalist” philosophers, especially Leibniz and\nDescartes. Which claims can reason hope to establish securely? A\nsecond question is central to his practical philosophy. It arises from\nthe subservient role accorded to reason by the British\nempiricists—above all Hume, who declared, “Reason is\nwholly inactive, and can never be the source of so active a principle\nas conscience, or a sense of morals” (Treatise,\n3.1.1.11; see also the entry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism).\n What sort of practical relevance can reason claim? These questions\nare reflected in the titles of two key works: the monumental\nCritique of Pure Reason, and the Critique of Practical\nReason that is middle point of his great trio of moral writings\n(between the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and\nThe Metaphysics of Morals).\n\n\nIt is clear that practical reason is the foundation of Kant’s moral\nphilosophy. It is less clear what role reason plays in his theoretical\nphilosophy. Kant insists that “metaphysics is utterly\nimpossible, or at best a disorderly and bungling endeavor” if we\ndo not separate “ideas of reason” from “concepts of\nthe understanding” (Prolegomena §41, 4:329). But\nwhile he emphasizes the solidity of empirical knowledge gained through\nthe understanding, reason and its “ideas” often appear as\nmere sources of error and illusion. (This is especially so for the\nmost-read sections of the first Critique—the Aesthetic,\nAnalytic and Dialectic.) But if this were all that Kant meant to say,\nthe status of philosophical reasoning would stand in grave doubt. In\naddition, we might note that Kant rarely discusses reason as such.\nThis leaves a difficult interpretative task: just what is Kant’s\ngeneral and positive account of reason?\n\n\nThis entry has the following structure. The first section sets out the\nrole that reason plays in Kant’s account of knowledge and metaphysics\nin the first Critique. The second section examines key\naspects of reason in the moral philosophy, with special reference to\nthe second Critique. Reflecting Kant’s canonical texts and\nthe bulk of the secondary literature, these discussions of theoretical\nand practical reason are relatively independent of one another. The\nthird section therefore considers how Kant’s views of theoretical and\npractical reason may be related. It emphasizes the most prominent\ncontemporary interpretation of Kantian reason, that of Onora O’Neill.\nThe concluding remarks underline the philosophical interest of a\nunified interpretation of Kant’s account of reason.\n\nThe first half of the Critique of Pure Reason argues that we\ncan only obtain substantive knowledge of the world via sensibility and\nunderstanding. Very roughly, our capacities of sense experience and\nconcept formation cooperate so that we can form empirical judgments.\nThe next large section—the “Transcendental\nDialectic”—demolishes reason’s pretensions to offer\nknowledge of a “transcendent” world, that is, a world\nbeyond that revealed by the senses. “Dialectic,” says\nKant, is “a logic of illusion” (A293): so in his\nvocabulary, a dialectical idea is empty or false. \nHowever, the Critique of Pure Reason should not be read as a\ndemolition of reason’s cognitive role. Kant certainly wants to delimit\nthe bounds of reason, but this is not the same as arguing that it has\nno role in our knowledge. Three points are crucial: (§1.1) the\nrelation of reason to empirical truth; (§1.2) reason’s role in\nscientific enquiry; and (§1.3) the positive gains that come from\nappreciating reason’s\n limits.[1]\n In addition, sound philosophical reasoning requires that reason gain\nknowledge of itself—a task that the first Critique\nbegins, but does not complete (§1.4). \nThe first thing to note is Kant’s bold claim that reason is the\narbiter of truth in all judgments—empirical as well as\nmetaphysical. Unfortunately, he barely develops this thought, and the\nissue has attracted surprisingly little attention in the literature.\n(But cf. Walker 1989: Ch. 4; Guyer and Walker 1990;\n Kant’s theory of judgment,\n §§1.3,\n 1.4).[2]\n However, some basic points are clear from the text. We form judgments\nabout the world around us all the time, without a second thought. We\nsee a hand in front of us and judge it to exist; after a dream, we\njudge ourselves to have been dreaming and the dream’s contents to be\nillusory; we see the sun rise and assume that it orbits the earth.\nKant devotes great philosophical efforts to show that all these\njudgments rely on categories, such as cause and effect, that must\norder our sensory impressions. A belief that conforms to these\nconditions meets the “formal” conditions of truth.\nHowever, unless we are fundamentally confused about something, all our\nbeliefs meet these\n conditions.[3])\n So there is a further question: which of our beliefs are\n“materially” true, and which erroneous? \nCorresponding to the fundamental priority that he ascribes to\njudgment, Kant begins with the observation that only once there is\njudgment can there be error: “It is correctly said that the\nsenses do not err; yet not because they always judge correctly, but\nbecause they do not judge at all” (A293). For example, there is\nno error involved in the impressions of a dream, however confused or\nfantastical they may be. But if someone were to get confused about her\ndreamed experience, and suppose that it had really happened, then she\nwould be making a judgment—and a false one too. So Kant claims,\n“error is only effected through the unnoticed influence of\nsensibility on understanding, through which it happens that the\nsubjective grounds of the judgment join with the objective ones”\n(A294). In the example, someone confuses a subjective ground of\njudgment (“I had this dream”) with an objective\none (“these events took place”). As Kant puts it\nin the Prolegomena: “The difference between truth and\ndream… is not decided through the quality of the\nrepresentations that are referred to objects, for they are the same in\nboth, but through their connection according to rules that determine\nthe combination of representations in the concept of an object, and\nhow far they can or cannot stand together in one experience.”\n(4:290) \nHow does reason enter the matter? In the famous “Refutation of\nIdealism,” Kant says the following: “Whether this or that\nputative experience is not mere imagination [or dream or delusion,\netc.] must be ascertained according to its particular determinations\nand through its coherence with the criteria of all actual\nexperience” (B279). To see what Kant means, consider a simple\nexample. Suppose that our dreamer believes she has won a lottery, but\nthen starts to examine this belief. To decide its truth, she must ask\nhow far it connects up with her other judgments, and those of other\n people.[4]\n If it fails to connect up (she checks the winning numbers, say, and\nsees no match with her actual ticket), she must conclude that the\nbelief was false. Otherwise, she would contradict a fundamental law of\npossible experience, that it be capable of being unified. As Kant\nsummarizes his position: “ the law of reason to seek unity is\nnecessary, since without it we would have no reason, and without that,\nno coherent use of the understanding, and, lacking that, no sufficient\nmark of empirical truth…”\n (A651/B679).[5] \nIn sum, what separates material error from true cognition for Kant is\nthat true cognitions must find a definite place within a single,\nunified experience of the world.  Since reason is an important source\nof the unifying structure of experience, it proves essential as an\narbiter of empirical truth. \nThe same principle of reasoned unity also applies to judgments that\nare not readily decided by everyday experience. Why are we sure that\nthe sun does not orbit the earth, despite all appearances? To answer\nsuch questions, we need to consider reason’s role in scientific\nknowledge. Kant claims that reason is “the origin of certain\nconcepts and principles” (A299/B355) independent from those of\nsensibility and understanding.  Kant refers to these as\n“transcendental ideas” (A311/B368) or “ideas of\n[pure] reason” (A669/B697). And he now defines reason as a\n“faculty of principles” (A299/B356) or the “faculty\nof the unity of the rules of understanding under principles”\n(A303/B358). The problem is how to justify these concepts and\nprinciples. This problem is acute because Kant also argues that they\noften lead us into error and contradiction. \nApart from ideas about objects that lie beyond sensory experience,\nsuch as God or the soul, we also form transcendental ideas about\nentities that are meant to form the ultimate basis of everything that\nexists, such as the universe as a whole: Kant speaks of “world\nwholes” or cosmological ideas. As discussed in a moment\n(§1.3), claims to objective knowledge about these cosmological\nideas, such as the claim that the universe has a beginning in time or\nthe opposing claim that it does not, lead us into contradictions or\n“antinomies.”  \nYet science assumes that the world forms a well-ordered, systematic\nunity where all events can be subsumed under causal laws. As just\nindicated, we rely on a basic version of this principle when we judge\nthat some impressions are illusions or dreams. It should also be clear\nthat, however coherent our experiences might be, they are bound to be\nfinite in extent. That is, we could never experience enough to justify\nthis apparently cosmological claim that every object and event\nconforms to causal laws—let alone that these laws will continue\nto hold in the\n future.[6]\n Nonetheless, Kant argues that reason is justified in adopting these\nprinciples (among others), so long as it does not treat these as\nknowledge claims. This is his distinction between the\n“constitutive” and “regulative” use of ideas.\n(See, e.g., Buchdahl 1992; Friedman 1992c;\n Kant’s theory of judgment,\n §4.2.) \nFor Kant, the “constitutive” use of our faculties helps to\nconstitute the objects of knowledge, by providing their form as\nobjects of possible experience. Constitutive principles thereby have a\nstrong objective standing—the paradigm case being the categories\nof the understanding. Regulative principles, by contrast, govern our\ntheoretical activities but offer no (constitutive) guarantees about\nthe objects under investigation. As Kant puts it, activities must have\ngoals if they are not to degenerate into merely random groping (cf.\nBvii, A834/B862). Science aims to discover the greatest possible\ncompleteness and systematicity (cf. Guyer 1989 & 2006, Abela 2006,\nMudd 2017), subsuming objects and events under the most\nall-encompassing laws. When Kant speaks of the “unity of\nreason” in the first Critique, he means that reason gives\n“unity a priori through concepts to the understanding’s manifold\ncognitions” (A302/B359; cf. A665/B693, A680/B780).  \nAs indicated, this unity must be a priori since it cannot be given\nthrough any set of experiences. Nor can we know in advance how far\nscience will succeed, or that nature is wholly law-like. So the\nprinciple of seeking unity forms (what Kant calls) a\n“maxim” or regulative principle of reason\n(A666/B694; see Mudd 2016 for recent discussion of this principle and\nits practical nature). By contrast, the claim that such unity\ndoes exist would represent a “constitutive\nprinciple,” the sort of “cosmological” knowledge\nclaim that we cannot justify. \nOur judgment that the earth orbits the sun (and not vice versa)\nprovides a simple illustration. The opposite claim seems more\ncompelling to common sense, and consistency in observations is\ngenerally sufficient to confirm everyday knowledge. But scientific\nknowledge aspires to law-like completeness. It is not just that\nGalileo’s observations with the telescope suggest that everyday\nappearances are misleading. For Kant, more important is how reason\nunifies these observations through laws of gravity, momentum and so\nforth. By compassing the motion of all heavenly objects, and not only\nthe movement of the sun relative to the earth, Newton provides the\nproper confirmation of Copernicus’ heliocentric hypothesis (Bxxii n;\ncf. §1.4 below). The extension and modification of Newton’s laws\nby general relativity gives one indication of the open-ended,\n“regulative” nature of this quest; so too does the as-yet\nunsatisfied ambition to integrate general relativity with quantum\n mechanics.[7] \nKant’s account of science, and especially the role of\n“teleological” or purposive judgment, is further developed\nin the Critique of Judgment. See Guyer 1990, Freudiger 1996,\nand Nuzzo 2005, as well as\n Kant’s aesthetics and teleology, §3.\n On Kant’s account of science more generally, see Wartenberg 1992,\nBuchdahl 1992, Friedman 1992b & 2013, and Breitenbach\n[forthcoming]. On reason and science, see Neiman 1994: Ch. 2 and Grier\n2001: Ch. 8. The entry on\n Kant’s philosophy of science\n considers Kant’s view of the natural sciences, especially\nphysics. \nThe third point is the most well-known, and is considered in detail in\nthe entry on\n Kant’s critique of metaphysics.\n Kant demolishes a series of supposed proofs of the existence of God\n(“The Ideal of Pure Reason”) and the soul (“The\nParalogisms”). He also demonstrates that it is equally possible\nto prove some judgments about “world wholes” as it is to\nprove their opposites, such as the claims that space must be unbounded\nand that it must be bounded (“The Antinomies,”\nincluding the idea of an absolutely first cause: the problem of\nfreedom as it is posed in the famous “Third Antinomy”).\nThese sections have always been regarded as among the most convincing\nparts of the first Critique. Mendelssohn spoke for many of\nKant’s contemporaries in calling him the “all destroyer,”\nfor devastating reason’s pretenses to transcendent insight. \nIn establishing these limits on metaphysical knowledge, Kant’s\nintentions are not merely destructive. Not only does the exercise\ndeliver self-knowledge of reason (§1.4); in addition, Kant sees\nthat the failures of metaphysics to establish secure\nground—as to what we can know—has been more\ndamaging than any critique. In the hands of theologians and\nmetaphysicians, reason has claimed knowledge that it cannot have,\nleading to empty battles that invite outright skepticism. By contrast,\nKant’s critique aims to clear the ground for rational claims\nthat can be justified. These include both the claims discussed in\n§1.1 and §1.2 above, and the practical claims of reason\ndiscussed below in §2. (Gava & Willaschek [forthcoming]\nusefully stress this aspect of the first Critique.) \nAt the beginning of the Doctrine of Method (the last, least-read part\nof the first Critique) Kant alludes to the biblical story of\n Babel.[8]\n God punished the attempt to build “a tower that would reach the\nheavens” (A707/B735) with a confusion of languages, leaving\npeople unable to understand one another and unable to cooperate in\nsuch hubristic\n ventures.[9]\n Again and again, reason returns to some very simple ideas with\ntowering implications—the immortal soul, God, freedom; what is\nmore, it cooks\n up[10]\n more or less convincing proofs of these. Without the acid test of\nexperience of a common world, people are bound to come up with\nconflicting versions of these ideas (unless, perhaps, they emptily ape\none another’s words without real understanding). Then they will either\ntalk past one another, or fall into conflict—or, one of Kant’s\nabiding fears, be forced to submit to an unreasoned authority. In\nmetaphysics, Kant refers to “the ridiculous despotism of the\nschools”\n (Bxxxv).[11]\n When we turn to the practical sphere, however, despotism is far from\nridiculous: it is the last, brutal resort for securing coexistence\namong people who insist on conflicting doctrines. Thus Kant often\nalludes to Hobbes, on whose theory order is only possible if an\nunaccountable sovereign overawes all the members of\n society.[12]\n Saner 1967, O’Neill 1989, and Neiman 1994 all offer interpretations\nthat see Kantian reason as securing intersubjective order and\novercoming threats of Babel-like hubris, conflict and despotism. \nOne of the most famous lines of the first Critique occurs in\nthe second edition’s Preface, where Kant says, “I had to deny\nknowledge in order to make room for faith”\n(Bxxx). Knowledge of the world as a whole, or of entities that\ntranscend this world (the immortal soul or God) is not humanly\npossible: it is not possible via experience, and reason has no power\nto supply knowledge in its place. However, as indicated in §1.2,\nKant argues that science is entitled to rely on certain principles\nthat regulate its project, without being known as objects. In\nthe final section of the Critique, Kant argues that knowledge\nis not the only or even the primary end of reason: in its practical\nuse, reason addresses our role within the world. So Kant\ndescribes his conception of philosophy as ‘cosmic’ (ein\nWeltbegriff, literally “world concept”) rather than\n‘scholastic’ (A838/B866; cf. Ypi 2013 and Ferrarin 2015). \nIn line with this conception, Kant proposes three questions that\nanswer “all the interest of my reason”: “What can I\nknow?” “What must I do?” and “What may I\nhope?” (A805/B833). We have seen his answer to the first\nquestion: I can know this world as revealed through the senses, but I\ncannot know the total sum of all that exists, nor a world beyond this\none (a supersensible world). Kant does not answer the second question\nuntil the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, four years\nlater. (Arguably, he sees no need to answer the question in this form,\nsince he is confident that people have long known what their duties\nconsist\n in.[13])\n But the first Critique does include some observations on\nhope—that is, faith in God and a future world. We certainly fall\ninto error if we think reason can know a world beyond the\nsenses. Indeed, Kant insists that such knowledge would corrupt\npractical reasoning, by imposing an external incentive for moral\naction—fear of eternal punishment and hope of heavenly reward,\nwhat he will later call “heteronomy.” Nonetheless, human\nreason still has an inescapable interest in belief in God,\nimmortality and freedom. Kant develops this claim more systematically\nin the second Critique, as discussed below (§2.3). \nKant’s idea that reason has “interests,” or even\n“needs,” may seem strange, and is discussed by Kleingeld\n1998a and Ferrarin 2015: Ch. 1. For finite beings, reason is not\ntransparently or infallibly given to consciousness (as some\nrationalist philosophers seemed to think), just as it cannot deliver\ntranscendent truths. Thus reason “needs to present itself to\nitself in the process of gaining clarity about its own workings”\n(Kleingeld 1998a: 97)—above all, the principles that it must\ngive to itself. As the next section discusses, this means that Kant\nviews reason as essentially self-reflexive. \nThe first Critique argues that there has hitherto been no\nreal progress in metaphysics. In the second edition Preface, Kant\nproudly proclaims that his book has finally put metaphysics on\n“the sure path of a science” (Bvii; cf. Axiii). What,\nthen, is the relation of metaphysics—or philosophical reasoning\nmore generally—to those areas of human enquiry that do seem to\ngenerate certainty (geometry and mathematics) and the expansion of\nknowledge (science in general)? \nKant had long insisted that mathematics could provide no model for\n philosophizing.[14]\n “Mathematics gives the most resplendent example of pure reason\nhappily expanding itself without assistance from experience”\n(A712/B740). But metaphysics cannot follow its course. This is not\nsimply a rhetorical point, since many of Kant’s predecessors had tried\nto do exactly this—Spinoza’s Ethics is one example,\nChristian Wolff’s philosophy another (see Gava [forthcoming]). Kant’s\nbasic argument against such efforts is that mathematicians are\njustified in constructing objects or axioms a priori, because\nthey can work with pure intuitions (albeit very abstract ones: a line\nor the form of a triangle, say), rather than being restricted to\nanalysis of concepts alone. (See the entry on\n Kant’s philosophy of mathematics.)\n This sort of procedure is not available to philosophers, who have no\nright to assume any a priori intuitions or axioms about metaphysical\nentities. Attempts that rely on such claims have only produced\n“so many houses of cards” (A727/B755). \nBut if mathematics does not provide a model for a genuinely scientific\nmetaphysics, the relation between metaphysics and the empirical\nsciences is also unpromising. In the first place, Kant has argued that\nexperience cannot reveal metaphysical entities. We could never\nknow, for instance, that we are free: like everything else we\ncan know, human conduct is in principle open to fully determinate\ncausal explanation. Second, experience cannot generate the sort of\nnecessity Kant associates with metaphysical conclusions. (This is a\nlong-standing bone of contention between Humean and Kantian accounts\nof knowledge—for instance, as regards causation. See the entry\non\n Kant and Hume on causality.)\n That is, our investigation of the world, no matter how systematic or\nscientific, only reveals contingent facts: it cannot show\nthat such-and-such must be the case. To hold that scientific\nlaws have the quality of necessity—so that they really are\nlaws, and not mere generalizations or rules of thumb—is\na metaphysical rather than an empirical claim. \nNeither point, however, deters Kant from using the imagery of science\nand experiment to describe his own philosophical endeavors. Such\nmetaphors are especially prominent in the Preface to the second\nedition of the Critique, where he writes: \nIn other words, reason, as “[self-]appointed judge,” does\nnot sit by and merely observe whatever comes along. It actively\nproposes principled accounts of the phenomenon it\ninvestigates—that is, law-like hypotheses. Then it\ndevises experiments to confirm or disprove these. \nAs a characterization of philosophical reasoning, this prompts Kant to\noptimism, but it may puzzle his readers. Kant is optimistic, because\nwhat philosophy has to investigate is not the infinite scope of the\nempirical world, but rather “what reason brings forth entirely\nout of itself… as soon as [its] common principle has been\ndiscovered” (Axx). (One application of this idea is found in the\nTranscendental Dialectic of the first Critique, where Kant\ninsists that there are only three transcendental ideas—the\nthinking subject, the world as a whole, and a being of all\nbeings—so that it is possible to catalogue exhaustively the\nillusions to which reason is subject.) But there is also much room for\npuzzlement. Kant is suggesting that reason conduct an experiment upon\nitself—an idea that comes close to paradox. He also suggests\nthat reason has a “common principle”—but nowhere in\nthe first Critique does he explain what this consists in. \nHow Kant’s “experiment” functions with regard to our\neveryday knowledge is well-known. His Copernican hypothesis (Bxvi f)\nis that experience is relative to the standpoint and capacities of the\nobserver. Only on this basis, Kant contends, can we find an\nexplanation for the a priori structure of that experience (for\nexample, its temporality or causal connectedness). The alternative,\nthat we take a “single standpoint” and do not distinguish\nbetween objects of experience and those that are “merely\nthought… beyond the bounds of experience” (i.e.,\nthings-in-themselves), fails because it results in “an\nunavoidable conflict of reason with itself” (Bxviii n)—for\nexample, in the Antimonies mentioned above (§1.3), Kant argues\nthat the failure to separate appearances (everyday items of\nexperience) from things-in-themselves (metaphysical entities that lie\nbeyond experience) leads us to dramatically contradictory\nconclusions. \nHowever, this still leaves awkward questions about philosophical\nknowledge, and reasoning more generally. Kant’s philosophical task is\nnot just a matter of “compelling” sensibility and\nunderstanding to act as “witnesses”: reason stands before\nits own tribunal, too, and must give account of itself. (This metaphor\nis investigated by Stoddard 1988; Kant’s juridical and political\nmetaphors are given a central philosophical role by Saner 1967 and\nO’Neill 1989.) When reason decides to act as judge and jury in its own\ncase, how can we expect the results to stand up to scrutiny? \nSection 3 discusses the most thorough reply to this question in the\nliterature, that offered by Onora O’Neill. To anticipate briefly: The\ngeneral problem hinted at by Kant’s metaphors—of reason’s\nexperiment upon itself, or compelling itself to give\ntestimony—is that of reason’s self-knowledge (cf. Axi\nf). Kant assumes that we have a capacity of reason; but “reason\ngrants [respect] only to that which has been able to withstand its\nfree and public examination” (Axi n). We cannot, therefore,\ndogmatically assert the authority of this capacity:\n“reason… has no dictatorial authority” (A738/B766).\nThis point is especially compelling given how fallible reason has\nproven in metaphysics: “how little cause have we to place trust\nin our reason if in one of the most important parts of our desire for\nknowledge it does not merely forsake us but even entices us with\ndelusions and in the end betrays us!” (Bxv). Kant’s question,\nthen, is how we might defend reason from various doubts and\n worries[15]\n and how we might discipline it without begging\nquestions— for instance, by invoking claims or premises that\nthemselves are open to doubt (cf. O’Neill 1989: Ch. 1, 1992, 2004\n& 2015). This is then the central task of critique (cf.\nBxxxv): reason’s self-reflexive examination of itself, which\nestablishes its limits and its “common principle,” and\nvindicates its authority. \nIn the first Critique there are only hints as to the form\nKant’s moral theory would\n take.[16]\n The account of practical reason in the Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals (1785) and Critique of Practical\nReason (1788) is radically new. Kant now claims to have\ndiscovered the supreme principle of practical reason, which he calls\nthe Categorical Imperative. (More precisely, this principle is an\nimperative for finite beings like us, who have needs and inclinations\nand are not perfectly rational.) Notoriously, Kant offers several\ndifferent formulations of this principle, the first of which runs as\nfollows: “act only in accordance with that maxim through which\nyou can at the same time will that it become a universal law”\n(4:421). (On the different versions of the Imperative, which Kant\nclaims are equivalent, see\n Kant’s moral philosophy, §§5-9.)\n Kant holds this principle to be implicit in common human reason: when\nwe make moral judgments, we rely on this criterion, although\ninvariably we do not articulate it as such. \nThe Categorical Imperative is not the only principle of practical\nreason that Kant endorses. At nearly the same level of generality is\nthe principle underlying all “hypothetical imperatives.”\n(See\n Kant’s moral philosophy, §4.)\n Imperatives of skill and prudence rely on the principle:\n“Whoever wills the end also wills (insofar as reason has\ndecisive influence on his actions) the indispensable necessary means\nto it that are within his power” (4:417f; cf.\n 5:19f[17]).\n Following Hume, many philosophers hold that practical reasoning is\nessentially instrumental. They therefore see all practical demands as\nultimately hypothetical, that is, conditional upon our having\nparticular ends or inclinations (cf.\n Kant and Hume on morality,\n §3). Kant, however, sees the principle of hypothetical\nimperatives as subordinate to the Categorical Imperative (cf.\nKorsgaard 1997). Reason can also be the source of unconditional\ndemands, that is, demands that do not presuppose any particular ends\nor inclinations. Kant’s claim can be put even more strongly: reason is\nthe only source of unconditional demands that human beings\ncan ever have access to. \nAlongside the derivation of his supreme moral principle, the most\ndifficult questions about Kant’s view of practical reason center on\nits relation to freedom. Although the broad outlines are consistent,\nKant’s views on this topic seem to shift more than usual across his\ncritical writings. (See\n Kant’s moral philosophy,\n §10, for a brief sketch, and Allison 1990 for a masterful,\nthough not uncontroversial, account.) This and the following\nsub-section focus on Kant’s central, radical claim that “freedom\nand unconditional practical law [that is, for any finite being, the\nCategorical Imperative] reciprocally imply each other” (5:29f).\nOn the one hand, freedom implies that practical reason can be pure\n(non-instrumental, unconditional), and hence that we are subject to\nthe demands of the Categorical Imperative. On the other, our\nsubjection to morality implies that we must be free. \nKant’s argument from freedom to the Categorical Imperative is very\nshort indeed (see Critique of Practical Reason,\n5:19–30). If I am free to step back from all inclinations, those\ninclinations do not provide a compelling reason to act in any\nparticular way. All that is left to determine my way of acting (my\nmaxim, in Kant’s terminology) is “the mere form of\ngiving universal law” (5:27). By the “mere form of…\nlaw” Kant means that there must be some principle, some overall\npolicy or structure, determining what I do—otherwise my actions\nwould be merely random, and hence unintelligible: no-one would be able\nto follow them (not even me). More than this, no principle is truly\nlaw-like unless it abstracts from an agent’s particular motivations\nand situation, so as to be followable by all. Only then can it be\ncapable of “giving universal law.” \nAlthough Kant sometimes writes as if it were difficult to see what\npractical reason requires (for instance, in his comments about\npractical wisdom: §3.2 below), he usually assumes that everyone\nreadily grasps the fundamental principles which all can follow. That\nis, he is remarkably optimistic about people’s capacity for\nindependent moral insight. In the recent literature there is some\nconsensus that Kant failed to recognize the complexity and difficulty\nof moral reasoning (cf. Herman 1993: Ch. 4 & 2007; O’Neill 1996).\nBut judging what the Categorical Imperative requires only poses\nserious difficulties if Kant has adequately justified it. In\nparticular, his equation of mere law-likeness with principles that all\ncan follow may seem much too quick. To see what Kant means, it helps\nto consider some other principles that may sound stable or law-like\nbut go beyond the “mere form of law”—and thereby\nfail to be justifiable.  \nTo illustrate, take two of the six candidates he discusses in the\nsecond Critique (5:39ff). One possibility would be a policy\nof following my inclinations wherever they might lead (Kant identifies\nthis view with Epicurus). This is a policy of sorts, and indeed one\nthat a free agent could adopt. But it goes beyond the “form of\nlaw” by taking substantive guidance from merely subjective\nfactors. In doing so, it abandons law-likeness and intersubjective\nvalidity. Apart from the fact that my inclinations will surely change\nand clash, it is not a policy that everyone can follow: if they did,\nthe results would be chaotic and defeat anyone’s attempts to satisfy\ntheir inclinations. (That is, it is non-universalizable in the sense\nthat it leads to a “contradiction in the will.” While we\ncan conceive of a world of such agents, we cannot consistently\nwill such a world. See\n Kant’s moral philosophy,\n §5.) More abstractly, such a policy gives weight to the\nparticular conditions of one particular agent. But those conditions\ncan hardly claim the authority to guide others’ thought or action. So\nKant says: \nA second possibility—in some respects, an inversion of the\nprevious one—would be to disregard my own inclinations and\nsubmit to another’s dictates, or perhaps the laws and customs of my\ncommunity. Kant mentions Mandeville, but\n Hobbes’\n solution to the “state of nature” offers a more familiar\nexample. This requires everyone to submit to a single sovereign, and\nnot to judge for himself what he should do. There are many problems\nwith this solution, but for Kant the most fundamental one is that to\nsubmit to another’s dictates is to give up the demand that those\ndictates be justified in their turn. However “benevolent”\nor “enlightened” the authority, its instructions would be\nunjustified in the fundamental sense that reasons are no longer\nrelevant to those who submit. (Of course, one could submit insofar as\none finds an authority justified. This may be perfectly reasonable,\nbut it is not genuine submission. It is actually a sort of\ncooperation, where we continue to use our own judgment about whom to\nrely on. We often do this when we believe someone else is better able\nto judge a particular issue—when we accept “doctor’s\norders,” for example.) \nThere is a common difficulty underlying all the untenable alternatives\nKant considers. They look for substantive guidance from outside of\nreason itself—just as hypothetical imperatives only guide action\nif some end is taken for granted. Kant calls this\nheteronomy—that is, reasoning directed from the\noutside, by an authority that is merely assumed or imposed. The\nproblem is to find ways of acting and thinking that are\nauthoritative—that is, are entitled to guide everyone’s\nacting and thinking. To gain this entitlement, they must be\nautonomous—that is, not dependent on an authority that\nitself refuses justification. \nKant’s injunction to look to the mere form of law at first appears to\nprovide no guidance at all, and has often been reproached on this\nbasis. Defenders of Kant’s ethics argue that it represents a\nsubstantial constraint: to avoid all those ways of thinking and acting\nthat cannot be followed by all. (For discussion see inter\nalia O’Neill 1989: Ch. 5; Herman 1993; Allison 1990: Ch. 10\n§II.) If so, the autonomy of reason can point to the positive\nsense of freedom at the heart of Kant’s practical philosophy (cf.\nBrandom 1979). This is the possibility of acting in ways that do\nnot rely on “contingent, subjective conditions that\ndistinguish one rational being from another” (5:21), and hence\ndo not fall foul of others’ demands for justification. \nIn addition to claiming that freedom implies subjection to the\nCategorical Imperative, Kant also holds that moral obligation implies\nfreedom. Throughout the critical writings, Kant argues that\n“nothing in appearances can be explained by the concept of\nfreedom” (5:30). So he frequently insists that morality\n“exists in the sensible world [the world as known through the\nsenses and by science] but without infringing on its laws”\n(5:43). Every action, considered as an event in the world of\nappearances, must be considered as caused (whether we think of\nexplanations given by neuroscience or physics or perhaps even\npsychology). Experience of the objective world therefore gives us no\nwarrant for assuming freedom. Instead it is to our consciousness or\nsubjectivity that Kant turns: \nAs Kant also says, “the moral law, and with it practical reason,\n[have] come in and forced this concept [freedom] upon us”\n(5:30). In the next section, Kant introduces this idea in notorious\nterms, as a “fact of reason”: “Consciousness of this\nfundamental law may be called a fact of reason because one cannot\nreason it out from antecedent data of reason” (5:31; cf. 5: 6,\n42f, 47, 55, 91, 104). \nThis “fact” has caused considerable controversy among\ncommentators. This is partly because Kant is not altogether clear\nabout what he takes this fact to demonstrate. It is also because he\nhas repeatedly argued that morality cannot be based on facts about\nhuman beings, and must be revealed a priori, independently of\nexperience. (In this regard it is significant that Kant also uses the\nLatin word factum, meaning deed. In other words, we\nare dealing with an act of reason and its result, rather than\na merely given fact. See Kleingeld 2010.) Moreover, Kant speaks of\n“cognizing the moral law,” when he is well aware that no\nauthor before him has formulated this law as he has. A final source of\ndifficulty is that this “fact, as it were” does not\nfeature in his earlier treatise, the Groundwork, and does not\nappear again. \nOne school of thought—which includes many influential Kant\nscholars, and is sympathetically represented in Allison 1990 (Chs. 12\nand 13)—sees a fundamental change in Kant’s thought here.\nWhereas Part III of the Groundwork seems to give a\n“deduction” (justification) of freedom, in the second\nCritique Kant sees that this project is impossible on his own\npremises. So he stops argument short by appealing to a supposedly\nindubitable fact. Others emphasize the clear continuities between the\ntwo works—in particular, Kant’s continued reliance on common\nmoral consciousness. For example, Łuków 1993 emphasizes\nthe parallel between the role played by Achtung\n(“respect” or “reverence” for morality) and\nthe fact of reason. Kant refers to reverence in all his ethical\nwritings: it is the only “feeling self-wrought by a rational\nconcept [= the moral law]” (4:401n). As such, it clearly\nparallels what he now calls “the sole fact of pure reason”\n(5:31). (See also O’Neill 2002 and Timmermann 2010.) \nThere are serious difficulties at issue in this scholarly dispute. But\nKant’s line of thought in the long passage just quoted is relatively\nclear: We all (most of us) recognize that there are situations where\nwe ought to do something, even though it will cost us something that\nis very dear to us (i.e., we feel ourselves subject to an\nunconditional moral imperative). So far as we really acknowledge this\n“ought,” we commit ourselves to believing that it will be\npossible for us to do this (i.e., that we are free). This reveals\nsomething that we could hardly be certain of except on the basis of\nthis encounter with our own activity of moral reasoning (cf. Kleingeld\n2010). \nClearly, this line of thought is not immune to criticism. Our feeling\nof moral constraint might be explained in terms of a Freudian\nsuper-ego, for instance. But it enables us to see why Kant thought\nthat moral awareness—unlike any other sort of\nexperience—gives us a practical certainty of our freedom, being\n“a fact in which pure reason in us proves itself actually\npractical” (5:42). (“Practical certainty” because it\nis not knowledge of the same sort as empirical and scientific\nknowledge.) At the same time, if Kant is right that only the\nCategorical Imperative reveals those ways of acting that we can\njustify to others, then we can see why he claims, “freedom and\nunconditional practical law reciprocally imply each other”\n(5:29f). \nKant does not give a complete account of the relation of practical\nreason to theoretical reason in the Groundwork or any later\nworks. However, the second Critique does include an important\nsection that bears on this question: “On the primacy of pure\npractical reason in its connection with speculative reason”\n(5:119–121). (See Gardner 2006 and Willaschek 2010.) At the most\ngeneral level, Kant’s notion of autonomy already implied some sort of\nprimacy for pure practical reason. Against various stripes of\nrationalism, Kant denies that theoretical reason can have any insight\ninto the supersensible. So reason has no possible access to a\ntranscendent authority that could issue commands for thought or\naction. Against Hume, Kant denies normative authority to the\ninclinations. These points rule out the only ways that theoretical or\ninstrumental reasoning could supply authoritative reasons to act. If\nthere are such reasons—as the “fact of reason”\npronounces —then only pure practical reason is left to\nsupply them. Now, however, Kant argues that pure practical reason has\n“primacy” even on the home turf of theoretical reason.\nThat is, pure practical reason should guide some of our\nbeliefs, as well as our actions. \nKant defines primacy as “the prerogative of the interest of one\ninsofar as the interests of others is subordinated to it”\n(5:119). He gives two reasons for thinking that practical reason has\nthis\n “prerogative.”[18]\n First, practical reason can be “pure” or independent from\n“pathological conditions,” that is, our inclinations. So\nit is not conditioned by anything else—for instance, by a desire\nfor happiness or subjective wishes. In other words, (pure) practical\nreason is independent from our inclinations. By contrast, theoretical\nreason falls into error if it claims independence from the\ndeliverances of sensibility and understanding—for example, in\nattempting to prove the existence of God. Second, Kant argues that we\ncannot leave the question of primacy undecided, because practical\nreason would otherwise come into conflict with theoretical reason. The\ninterest of theoretical reason consists in expanding our knowledge and\navoiding error—which means suspending all claims to knowledge\nbeyond the bounds of experience. However, insofar as theoretical\nreason has interests at all, this is itself a practical matter,\n“since all interest is ultimately practical.” So Kant\nwrites: \nKant’s basic claim is not prima facie\nimplausible—“all interest is ultimately practical and even\nthat of speculative reason is only conditional and is complete in\npractical use alone” (5:121). But what he means by this,\nexactly, is a difficult matter of interpretation. (Cf. Neiman 1994:\nCh. 3; Guyer 1997; Rauscher 1998.) Moreover, the uses to which Kant\nputs this argument are as controversial as any question in his\nphilosophy, since he here reinstates—as items of faith rather\nthan knowledge—the very ideas that the first Critique\nhad argued to lie beyond human insight. (See further the entry on\n Kant’s philosophy of religion.) \nTo this end, Kant introduces the idea of a “postulate,”\ndefined as “a theoretical proposition, though one not\ndemonstrable as such, insofar as it is attached inseparably to an a\npriori unconditionally valid practical law” (5:122).\n“These postulates are those of immortality, of freedom\nconsidered positively (as the causality of a being insofar as it\nbelongs to the intelligible world), and of the existence of God”\n (5:132).[19]\n The law to which they “attach” is, of course, the moral\nlaw. It enjoins us to act for the sake of duty, with no assurances\nthat anything will follow from this for our own happiness or that of\n others.[20]\n This creates a “dialectic” or conflict between happiness\nand morality. While morality is, for Kant, the sole unconditional good\nfor human beings, he certainly does not deny that happiness is an\nimportant good, and indeed the natural and necessary end of every\nhuman being (cf. 4:415). This leads him to the concept of “the\nhighest\n good”:[21] \nKant’s argument is bold but dubious. He holds that we must think of\nmoral activity as really resulting in happiness. Yet human agency is\nnowhere near adequate to this task: “I [or indeed we]\ncannot hope to produce this [highest good] except by the harmony of my\nwill with that of a holy and beneficent author of the world”\n(5:129). So, Kant argues, we must postulate God’s existence. We must\nalso postulate immortality, since this enables us to hope that we will\ncome closer to virtue so as to be worthy of happiness. (Reath 1988\nargues that Kant sometimes also deploys a more defensible,\n“secular” or this-worldly, notion of the highest good.\nFurther recent discussion includes Kleingeld 1995 and Guyer 2000a\n& 2000b.) \nWe have seen one way in which Kant links theoretical and practical\nreason. In answer to the question, “What may I hope?” Kant\ninvokes the primacy of practical reason, so that theoretical reason\nmay accept the postulates of God, freedom and immortality “as a\nforeign possession handed over to it” (5:120). While Kant’s\nargument for freedom may be more compelling, the other arguments find\nlittle favor among contemporary authors, although they have been taken\nup in some commentary on Kant’s account of teleology (both in the\nCritique of Judgment (Guyer 1989, Freudiger 1996; see also\n Kant’s aesthetics and teleology,\n §3) and outside that work (Wood 1970, Kleingeld 1998b)). Jens\nTimmermann, for example, emphasizes that Kant never doubted that\npractical and theoretical reason represent the same faculty, and\ntrenchantly claims that “the principle that unifies the spheres\nof theoretical and practical reason… is the assumption of a\nwise and benevolent God who has created a teleological world that\ncoheres with morality” (2009: 197; cf. Kleingeld 1998b: 336).\nWhatever Kant’s own beliefs, however, such a position lacks wider\nphilosophical resonance. Most contemporary philosophers assume that\nthe world does not “harmonize with” morality in this\nway—or, at any rate, that to create such harmony is a human\ntask, and not a matter of divine agency. (Again, cf. Reath 1988, and\nsee also Guyer 2000b & 2006.) \nThe principal attempt to uncover the unity of Kantian reason and to\nrelate it to contemporary philosophical concerns is due to Onora\nO’Neill (1989 and subsequent essays). This section will focus on her\ncentral claim concerning the unifying role of the Categorical\nImperative, and the main bases for this claim in Kant’s texts.\nAlthough O’Neill’s interpretation of Kantian reason enjoys\nconsiderable respect among Kant scholars, it should be added that it\nhas not yet attracted a significant critical literature. (Among early\nreviews, see Engstrom 1992 and Wood 1992; for recent endorsement and\nrestatement, see Korsgaard 2008: 12 and Westphal\n 2011.)[22] \nIn the original Preface to the first Critique, Kant had\nraised the idea of reason’s “common principle”:\n“Nothing here can escape us, because what reason brings forth\nentirely out of itself cannot be hidden, but is brought to light by\nreason itself as soon as reason’s common principle\n(gemeinschaftliches Prinzip) has been discovered”\n(Axx). Unfortunately, neither edition of the Critique\nconsiders what this principle might be. \nThis question is raised in the works on practical reason, but then\npostponed and never clearly answered. In the Preface to the\nGroundwork, Kant explains why the book is not entitled a\nCritique of Pure Practical Reason: \nIn the second Critique, Kant compares the book’s structure\nwith the first Critique and comments: “such comparisons\n[are] gratifying; for they rightly occasion the expectation of being\nable some day to attain insight into the unity of the whole rational\nfaculty (theoretical as well as practical) and to derive everything\nfrom one principle—the undeniable need of human reason, which\nfinds complete satisfaction only in a complete systematic unity of its\ncognitions” (5:91). Kant’s tone is confident, but the fact is\nthat “insight into the unity of the whole rational\nfaculty” has once more been postponed. (Prauss 1981 argues that\nKant failed to achieve this insight, in part because he did not\nappreciate how cognitive success is a fundamentally practical goal.\nFörster 1992 discusses Kant’s reflections on this topic in his\nfinal manuscript, the Opus Postumum.) \nHowever, as Onora O’Neill points out in a celebrated essay (1989: Ch.\n1), the claims Kant has now made about practical reason actually\ncommit him to a third claim concerning reason’s “common\nprinciple.” Kant has argued that the Categorical Imperative is\nthe supreme principle of practical reason. He has also argued that\npractical reason has primacy over theoretical reason. It follows,\ntherefore, that the Categorical Imperative is the supreme principle of\nreason.—To be sure, Kant never states this conclusion\nexplicitly. But there are reasons for thinking that this ought to have\nbeen his view, and in some places he comes very close to such a claim.\n(Rescher 2000 (Ch. 9) similarly emphasizes the\n“isomorphism” of theoretical and practical reason.\nRauscher 1998 notes that Kant’s own use of the “primacy”\nof practical reason is more limited than O’Neill’s, while endorsing\nO’Neill’s overall case.) \nDirect textual evidence for O’Neill’s reading is slight. The clearest\npassage is a footnote (!) to Kant’s essay “What is it to Orient\nOneself in Thinking?” (1786): \nThe parallel with the first formulation of the Categorical\nImperative—“act only in accordance with that maxim through\nwhich you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw” (4:421)—hardly needs spelling out. Kant now says:\nthink only in accordance with that maxim that could be a\nuniversal\n law.[23]\n Differently put: thinking is an activity, and if the Categorical\nImperative is indeed “categorical” then it applies to\nall our activities. \nOther strands of Kant’s thought also support this interpretation. The\ntwo that have attracted the most attention are Kant’s “maxims of\ncommon human understanding” and his well-known account of the\n“public use of reason.” \nKant sets out three “maxims of common human understanding”\n[= reason] which are closely related to the Categorical\nImperative. They appear twice in his published writings, in relation\nto both acting and\n thinking.[24]\n The maxims are discussed by O’Neill 1989: Ch. 2 & 1992, and by\nNeiman 1994: Ch. 5. \nIn his last published work, the Anthropology, Kant presents\nthe maxims in a practical context, as guidelines for\nachieving some degree of wisdom: \nThe maxims also appear in the Critique of Judgment, where\nthey are closely related to the theoretical use of reason.\nThis occurs in a famous section on the sensus communis or\n“community sense,” which Kant describes as: \nThat is, the maxims are precepts for judging in accordance with\n“reason as a whole” and avoiding the distortions that can\narise from “subjective private conditions.” \nTo think for oneself Kant describes as the maxim of\nunprejudiced thought; its opposite is passivity or heteronomy\nin thought, leading to prejudice and\n superstition.[25]\n To think in the place of everyone else is the maxim of\nenlarged or broad-minded thought. And always to\nthink in accord with oneself is the maxim of consistent\nthought (5:294). Although the last maxim sounds more straightforward,\nKant is careful to emphasize its difficulty: it “can only be\nachieved through the combination of the first two and after frequent\nobservance of them has made them automatic” (5:295). Consistency\ndoes not just involve getting rid of obvious contradictions in our\nexplicit beliefs. It also requires consistency with regard to all the\nimplications of our beliefs—and these are often not apparent to\nus. To achieve this sort of law-likeness in thought depends\nboth on the genuine attempt to judge for oneself and the determination\nto expose one’s judgments to the scrutiny of others. In other words,\nit involves regarding oneself, first, as the genuine author of one’s\njudgments, and second, as accountable to others. As we might also say,\nit represents a determination to take responsibility for\none’s judgments. \nThe maxims support the thesis that theoretical and practical reasoning\nhave a unified structure, and flesh out the implications of the\nCategorical Imperative. As a matter of thought, to reason is to\ndiscipline one’s judgments so that others can follow them. As a matter\nof practical wisdom, it is to discipline one’s actions so that others\ncan adopt the same principles. \nKant’s famous essay, “What is Enlightenment?” (1784), has\nbeen of particular importance to commentators concerned with Kantian\nreason and politics. (See O’Neill 1989: Ch. 2, 1990 & 2015: Ch. 3;\nVelkley 1989; Deligiorgi 2005; Patrone 2008.) Kant’s second maxim,\n“to think into the place of others,” shows that he regards\ncommunication as essential to making valid judgments and to acting\nwisely and well. Thus Kant writes: “…how much and how\ncorrectly would we think if we did not communicate with others to whom\nwe communicate our thoughts, and who communicate theirs with\n us!”[26]\n Kant also describes the first maxim as the way to achieve\n“liberation from superstition,” which he equates with\n“enlightenment” (5:294). \nIn “What is Enlightenment?” Kant articulates both these\nthoughts in a political context, demanding that we “have the\ncourage to use our own reason”: \nHere, Kant is not primarily concerned with enlightenment as the\nactivity or condition of an individual—rather, as something that\nhuman beings must work towards together. For this, he says,\n“nothing is required but… the least harmful…\nfreedom: namely, freedom to make public use of one’s reason\nin all matters” (8:36). This is not the freedom to act\npolitically. Instead, it is what we now call freedom of the\npen—in Kant’s words, the use of reason “as a\nscholar before the entire public of the world of\nreaders” (8:37). \nKant’s contrast is with the reasoning someone undertakes as an\nemployee: as a civil servant or military officer or cleric of an\nestablished church. In each case, the employee is bound to fulfill the\ndictates of a given leader or organization, at least so long as he can\n“in conscience hold his office” (8:38). In doing so, he\nuses his reason to decide the best way of achieving ends that have\nbeen laid down by others. (There is a loose parallel with instrumental\nreasoning, which decides the best means to achieve ends laid down by\ninclination. In Kant’s terms, both are\nheteronomous—“directed by another.”) Although this\nsort of reasoning is often undertaken in what we now call\n“public offices”—as a state employee, for\ninstance—Kant describes such uses of reason as\nprivate—that is, deprived of freedom and\naccountable only to a particular authority. By contrast, the public\nuse of reason is not bound to any given ends and is accountable to\nall: a person speaks as a member of “the society of citizens of\nthe world” (8:37). Outside of his post, in a capacity he shares\nwith all other human beings, the civil servant or cleric may reason\nfreely, offering critical scrutiny of government policies or religious\nteachings. Nonetheless, he must continue to enact these in his\nemployment, as a “passive member” (8:37) of the\ncommonwealth. \nSome commentators find Kant’s emphasis on freedom of the pen elitist,\nand regret his emphasis on the importance of obedience. (See also\n Kant’s social and political philosophy,\n §§4, 6.) Taken together, these two points imply a clear\ngulf between the practical and the theoretical—or at any rate,\nbetween what citizens do and what they believe ought to be done.\nNonetheless, the essay makes clear how Kant equates reason with the\naspiration to full publicity. “To use one’s own\nreason” is to be engaged in the quest to address all\n“citizens of the world.” Our judgments and principles are\nonly reasonable to the extent that they can be accepted by\nall. Among other things, this means that they cannot assume the\nauthority of any particular organization or leader. In fact, Kant had\nalready said this, in a famous passage from the Critique of Pure\nReason: \nIn the term used by several contemporary Kantians (Herman 2007: Ch.\n10, Korsgaard 2008, Reath 2013), this procedure constitutes\nreason. It makes reason the only unconditional (that is,\nnon-heteronomous) form of authority for our thinking and acting.  \nKant’s discussions of theoretical reason are not obviously connected\nto his account of practical reason. His accounts of truth, scientific\nmethod and the limited insights of theoretical reason are complex, as\nis his view of practical reason and morality. No one doubts that\nknowledge and scientific enquiry, no less than action, are subject to\ndemands of rationality. However, if Kant’s account of reason is\nbased—as O’Neill above all has argued—in avoiding\nprinciples of enquiry and of action that others cannot also adopt, it\nwould be possible to see the underlying unity of these demands. We\nwould understand, for example, why Kant so strenuously resists claims\nto transcendent insight. To give authority to such claims—those\nof revelation and religious authority, for example—would be\nirrational insofar as they rest on principles of belief that cannot be\nadopted by all. \nUnderlying the difficulty of synthesizing and interpreting Kant’s\naccount of reason is, of course, the enormous question of what reason\nis. Many philosophers—both contemporary and historical\nfigures—proceed as if this were already clear. However, once\nthis question is raised—the question of reason’s self-knowledge,\nas Kant puts it—it is difficult to see grounds for such\nconfidence. While the secondary literature discussing her proposal\nremains limited, O’Neill’s interpretation of Kant represents an\nambitious and distinctive answer to this question.  \nO’Neill (2000) situates the Kantian account of reason against three\nalternatives, which she labels the instrumental, the communitarian,\nand the perfectionist. The first remains very widespread: with Hume,\nit regards instrumental reasoning as fundamental (cf.\n practical reason, §4;\n reasons for action: internal vs. external). \n The second sees reason as embedded within complex\ntraditions: rationality is what a given tradition or community takes\nit to consist in (cf. MacIntyre 1988;\n communitarianism).\n A third option, akin to the forms of rationalism that Kant opposed,\nis to see reason as an individual capacity to discern or intuit\nnormative truths (cf.\n moral non-naturalism, §3).\n Arguably, all three accounts fail in providing reasoned justification\nto some audiences. The instrumental reasoner is accountable to\nno-one—in fact, to nothing apart from whatever desires or ends\nhe happens to have. Someone who takes her particular tradition to\ndefine what beliefs and practices count as reasonable can have little\nto say to those who stand outside it. And the person who believes he\ncan intuit what is good or true will be mute—or worse—in\nthe face of those with different\n intuitions.[27] \nOn the interpretations advanced by Saner, O’Neill, Neiman and others,\nKant was aware of all these options and rejected each. We saw above\n(§1.4) that Kant characterizes reason in terms of a\nself-reflexive procedure. Reason is autonomous and submits to no\nexternal authority; it gains authority from submitting itself to\ncritique; and critique involves rejecting any mode of thinking or\nacting that cannot be adopted by all. In less abstract terms, the\nself-scrutiny of reason is scrutiny by all those who demand\njustification for any particular mode of thought or action. Such a\nview does not assume that we are necessarily bound to our interests\nand inclinations (as the instrumental account does). It does not ask\nus to rely on what others do accept (as the communitarian\naccount does). It does not involve the fantasy that we already know or\nintuit what everyone should accept (as the perfectionist\naccount does). It proposes, instead, a vision of human beings who are\nable to step back from their particular inclinations, habits and\nintuitions, and who are willing to use this ability to seek terms that\nall can accept—to construct an intersubjective order of\nco-existence, communication and cooperation on terms that all can\naccept.  \nSuch an account depends on a particular interpretation of Kant’s\ntexts, and is both ambitious and highly complex in its ramifications.\nNonetheless, if successful, it captures two powerful attractions of\nKant’s philosophizing: a universalism that transcends\nself-centeredness and community boundaries, and a modesty that\nrespects the limits of human insight.","contact.mail":"g.d.williams@lancaster.ac.uk","contact.domain":"lancaster.ac.uk"}]
