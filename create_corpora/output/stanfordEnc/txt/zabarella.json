Known most of all for his writings on logic and\nmethodology, Zabarella was an alumnus of the University of Padua,\nwhere he received his Ph.D. in philosophy. Throughout his teaching\ncareer at his native university, he also taught philosophy of nature\nand science of the soul (De anima). Among his main works are\nthe collected logical works Opera logica (1578) and writings\non natural philosophy, De rebus naturalibus (1590). Zabarella\nwas an orthodox Aristotelian seeking to defend the scientific status\nof theoretical natural philosophy against the pressures emanating from\nthe practical disciplines, i.e., the art of medicine and anatomy. He\ndeveloped the regressus method, which the Renaissance\nAristotelians regarded as the proper method for obtaining knowledge in\nthe theoretical sciences. At the turn of the seventeenth century\nZabarella’s writings were reprinted in Germany, where his\nphilosophy had a notable following, especially among Protestant\nAristotelian authors.\n\n\n\nGiacomo (or Jacopo) Zabarella was born into an old and noble Paduan\nfamily on the 5th of September in 1533. From his father\nGiulio Zabarella he inherited the title of palatine count. Zabarella\nenjoyed a humanist education and entered the University of Padua,\nwhere he received the doctorate in 1553. Zabarella had many famous\nteachers, like Francesco Robortello in the humanities, Bernardino\nTomitano in logic, Marcantonio Genua in physics and metaphysics, and\nPietro Catena in mathematics. Unlike most of his contemporaries who\nhad studied natural philosophy, Zabarella never took a degree in\nmedicine. His entire teaching career was spent at his native\nuniversity. He began his career in 1564 when he obtained the first\nchair (or professorship) of logic succeeding Bernardino Tomitano. Five\nyears later he moved to the more prestigious and more lucrative second\nchair of the extraordinary professor of natural philosophy. In 1577 he\nwas promoted to the first extraordinary chair of natural\nphilosophy. Finally, in 1585, Zabarella obtained the second ordinary\nchair of natural philosophy, which he held until his death. The\nstatutes of the University of Padua prevented him, as a native Paduan,\nfrom obtaining the first ordinary chair in natural\nphilosophy. Zabarella died at the age of 56 on the 15th of\nOctober in 1589. \n\nThe publications of Zabarella reflect his teaching in the Aristotelian\ntradition. The first of his publications was Opera logica,\nwhich appeared in Venice in 1578. Zabarella had time to write this\ncollection of logical works in 1576, when a plague raged in Veneto\nsending Zabarella into the countryside with his family.  This was one\nof the very few times in his life when he left the city of\nPadua. Zabarella’s next published work, Tabula logicae, came\nout two years later and his commentary on Aristotle’s Posterior\nAnalytics appeared in 1582. De doctrinae ordine\napologia, which appeared in 1584, was a reply to Francesco\nPiccolomini who had criticised Zabarella’s ideas on logic. The first\nof Zabarella’s works in natural philosophy, De naturalis scientiae\nconstitutione, came out in 1586. This introduction to the field\nwas connected to his major opus in natural philosophy, De rebus\nnaturalibus, the first edition of which was published\nposthumously in 1590. It contained 30 different treatises on\nAristotelian natural philosophy and Zabarella wrote the introduction\nof the book only few weeks before his death. Zabarella’s two sons\nedited his two incomplete commentaries on Aristotle’s texts, which\nwere also published posthumously: the commentary on Physics\n(1601) and the commentary on On the Soul (1605) (Mikkeli\n1992, p. 19). \n\nGiacomo Zabarella followed a very systematic style of writing in his\npublications. His idea was to build a coherent body of Aristotelian\nlogic and natural philosophy. Therefore he was also interested in the\nclassification of the disciplines and the relationships between\nvarious areas of academic learning. His use of Aristotle and other\nauthorities was both eclectic and critical. Zabarella’s sources thus\nincluded newly recovered Greek commentators such as Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Philoponus, Simplicius and Themistius, as well as\nmedieval commentators such as Thomas Aquinas, Walter Burley and\nAverroes. In Zabarella’s view, Averroes, unlike his followers,\naccurately understood Aristotle’s philosophy despite not knowing the\nthe original texts or even the Greek language (Martin 2007,\np. 15). Zabarella himself read Greek and could therefore consult the\nGreek text of Aristotle and the commentators. He devoted much effort\nto presenting what he considered to be the true meaning of Aristotle’s\ntexts. However, he resisted the tendency of the humanists to expunge\nall medieval barbarisms, preferring philosophical precision to\nclassical elegance (W.R. Laird 2000, p. 695). \n\nThe Aristotelian distinction between arts (artes) and\nsciences (scientiae) serves as the starting-point for\nZabarella’s philosophical system. At the beginning of his Opera\nlogica, Zabarella draws a distinction between the eternal world\nof nature and the contingent human world. From this distinction he\nproceeds to two corresponding kinds of knowledge, and two distinct\nmethods of defining them. Zabarella maintained that, properly\nspeaking, sciences are concerned with the eternal world of nature and\nthus are contemplative disciplines, whereas arts are concerned with\nthe contingent world of human beings and thus are non-contemplative,\nbeing productive instead. The sciences in the proper sense of that\nterm, as pertaining to demonstrative knowledge, are limited to those\ndisciplines that deal with the necessary and eternal or with what can\nbe deduced from necessary principles. Zabarella notes that Aristotle\nrequires two kinds of certainty from science. One is in the knowable\nthings, which are necessary as such (simpliciter); the other\nis in the mind of the scientist, who must be absolutely sure that\nthings cannot be otherwise. The necessity involved is therefore both\nontological, with respects to the objects known, and cognitive, with\nrespect to the knowing subject (Kessler 1998, p. 837). \n\nThe hierarchy of different disciplines was a widely debated topic in\nRenaissance philosophy. Also Zabarella emphasized the hierarchical\nnature of the division between different disciplines; the whole of\nactive philosophy aiming ultimately at the higher sphere of\ncontemplation. According to Zabarella, both in Plato and Aristotle\nhappiness in the active life is not the ultimate goal for a human\nbeing. Instead it is contemplation, which is man’s finest objective\nthat may lead to total perfection. In Zabarella’s view the purpose of\nactive philosophy is to remove hindrance to the acquisition of\nknowledge and therefore contemplative philosophy is the ultimate end\nand master of all active philosophy. In productive disciplines (i.e.,\narts) it is not necessary to define the objects under production as\nstrictly as in the contemplative sciences, because the productive arts\ndo not aim at knowledge, and thus the knowledge they need do not have\nto be perfect. \n\nZabarella identifies therefore the basic difference between arts and\nsciences. Science deals with what already exists, but art is concerned\nwith creation. The subject-matter of a science is immutable, but the\nsubject-matter of an art is the formation of things as yet\nnon-existent, but which can be made by human being. The contemplative\nphilosopher is not interested in initiating anything, but rather wants\nto comprehend and arrange the forms of existing, eternal things.\nMoreover, the ultimate purpose of the contemplative science is the\npursuit of knowledge for its own sake, but in the productive arts the\nend-result is an actual product (Mikkeli 1997, pp. 212–213). \n\nHowever, Zabarella was not concerned solely with the separation\nbetween the theoretical sciences and the practical and productive\ndisciplines, but dealt also with the relationships and hierarchy among\nthe theoretical sciences themselves. The contemplative or speculative\nsciences, for Zabarella, are in Aristotelian manner only three in\nnumber: divine science, also called metaphysics, mathematics, and\nnatural philosophy. Zabarella presents these contemplative sciences as\nbeing the only defenders of true knowledge. Zabarella emphasised in\nmany instances that each speculative science should demonstrate their\nown principles and not borrow them from metaphysics. According to\nZabarella, each discipline can be distinguished from others either\nwith respect to the object considered (res considerata) or\nwith respect to the way of considering (modus considerandi)\n(Pozzo 1998).  Natural philosophy, which deals with corporeal beings\nthat have an inner principle of movement, differs from metaphysics\n(which contemplates being as being) and from mathematics (which deals\nwith abstracted beings) in both ways. As a result, natural philosophy\nis autonomous and independent of both the other contemplative\nsciences. \n\nZabarella also developed a theory of the middle (or mixed) sciences\nthat, contrary to the prevailing view, afforded sciences such as\nastronomy and optics full demonstrative status despite their borrowing\nprinciples from pure mathematics. Nevertheless, Zabarella’s approach\nto the study of nature remained causal and qualitative in the\ntraditional Aristotelian vein rather than mathematical. Therefore he\ngave little attention to the possible uses of mathematics as a tool\nfor understanding the physical world (Laird 1983, Ch. 8). \n\nZabarella’s introductory treatise on the nature of logic, De\nnatura logicae, is basic to his teaching in logic. He defines\nlogic as being neither a science nor an art, but, in keeping with the\ntraditional meaning of the word organon, just an instrument\n(instrumentum) of the arts and sciences. As an instrumental\ndiscipline it furnishes a useful tool of inquiry for all the arts and\nsciences. Logic does not have a real subject of its own, but deals\nwith concepts, which stand for real beings. In this it is comparable\nto grammar. The difference between grammar and logic is that the\nformer is concerned with the perfect verbal expression of concepts,\nand hence is a linguistic discipline, while the latter invents second\nnotions (notiones secundae) or second intentions, that are\nable to create order among concepts. Therefore logic serves to\nrecognize the truth and distinguish it from falsehood in every\ninstance. Logic is thus a rational discipline (disciplina\nrationalis) that is not itself philosophy, but springs from\nphilosophy and is devoted to philosophical ends (Vasoli 2011). \n\nZabarella followed Averroes in dividing logic into two parts:\nuniversal logic, which is common to all subjects; and particular\nlogic, which is specific to particular subjects. The first three books\nof Aristotle’s Organon, the Categories, On Interpretation and\nthe Prior Analytics constitute the universal part of logic.\nAristotle’s Posterior Analytics, Topics and Sophistical\nRefutations are said to deal with particular logic as much as\nthey deal respectively with the demonstrative syllogism, the\ndialectical syllogism and the sophistical syllogism.  Following the\nNeoplatonic commentators (above all Simplicius), Zabarella also\nincluded Aristotle’s Rhetoric and Poetics within\nlogic. The former is included because it teaches the use of the\nrhetorical syllogism or enthymeme, and rhetorical induction or\nexample; the latter because it also teaches the use of example, not to\npersuasive ends, but for imitation. \n\nSince logic, viewed as the universal instrument for distinguishing\nbetween the true and the false, differs according to the objects to\nwhich it is applied and the ends for which it is used, its nature\ndepends on the realm of possible objects and ends. Rhetoric and\npoetics are special cases because they deal not with knowledge but\nwith the political disciplines in so far as they are concerned with\nthe good of the people. Sophistical syllogistic is another special\ncase, because it is directed towards deception and prefers to use\nfalsehood as its material. Dialectic and demonstration, however, are\ndirected towards the expression of truth. Dialectic is aimed at the\nproduction of opinion, and deals with probable and contingent\nmaterial; demonstration is dedicated to the acquisition of truth, and\nso it is exclusively occupied with necessary, true objects (Kessler\n1998, p. 837). \n\nFor Zabarella method also serves to differentiate the sciences from\nthe arts. The term can be understood in two ways, either in a wide\nsense as a method of presenting existing knowledge, which he prefers\nto call an order (ordo) of presentation, or in a narrow sense\nas a method of discovering knowledge, for which he reserves method\n(methodus) in its proper understanding. According to\nZabarella, ordo is an instrumental habitus through\nwhich we are prepared so to dispose the parts of each discipline so\nthat the discipline may be taught as well and easily as possible. \n\nAs regards these methods of presentation, Zabarella denies Galen’s\nview that these are four in number. Zabarella himself recognizes only\ntwo orders, the compositive and the resolutive. The order starts with\nwhat is either necessary or useful for teaching and learning. In the\ncontemplative (or theoretical) sciences, which aim at perfect\nknowledge, order of presentation follows the so-called way of\ncomposition (compositio) from general principles to\nparticular beings; in moral philosophy and in the arts, which aim at\naction or production, order follows the so-called way of resolution\n(resolutio) from the desired end to its first principles. \n\nFor Zabarella the methods in the strict sense of the word are\nintellectual instruments proceeding from the known to produce\nknowledge of the unknown. Such methods have argumentative force and\nthey deal with specific problems of the disciplines instead of\narranging the contents of a whole discipline, as do the orders of\npresentation. As with orders, Zabarella denied the possibility of more\nthan two methods.  He shows that other procedures, like the\ncomposition and division used in the hunt of definitions as well as\nthe so-called dialectical syllogisms are not genuinely productive of\nknowledge and therefore not methods in the proper sense of the\nterm. \n\nTherefore he recognized only two methods, which he labeled\ndemonstrative and resolutive. Demonstrative method (or composition)\nproceeds from cause to effect and involves demonstration “of the\nreasoned fact” or “most powerful” demonstration,\nbest exemplified in the mathematical sciences. Resolutive method (or\nresolution) proceeds from effect to cause and, despite its name, also\ninvolves demonstration, but of an inferior kind, that is called\ndemonstration “of the fact” or “from a sign”.\nRelated to this alter type of demonstration is the process of\ninduction (inductio), which is helpful for discovering\nprinciples that are known naturally but are not immediately\nevident. Zabarella believes that, by the force of induction, human\nintellect is capable of distinguishing the universal, which is hidden\nin particulars.  Induction, or resolutive method makes up the first\nphase in the regressus-method, which was, in his opinion, the\nonly proper method for natural philosophy. \n\nIt is this very distinction between the method of inquiry and the\norder of teaching that led Zabarella to a bitter controversy with his\nPaduan college Francesco Piccolomini (1523–1607). They both agreed\nthat ethical inquiry must proceed by deduction from an understanding\nof the end. In Zabarella’s view all the disciplines whose end is\naction should be explained in this same way. But Piccolomini could\nnot bring himself to admit that the order of teaching, in ethics as well\nas in in other practical disciplines, should follow this order of\napprehension.  Thus the fundamental question embedded in this dispute\nis the following: Is the order of teaching a particular discipline\nnecessary or contingent? Zabarella argued for the former: both in\ndiscovery and in teaching, one should follow the synthetic order in\nthe sciences and the analytic order in the arts. By making a sharp\ndistinction between the method of discovery and the order of teaching,\nPiccolomini instead embraced a contingent view of pedagogical\nmethod. Wishing to teach others, Piccolomini saw his duty as that of\nstarting out from first principles (a primis principiis). In\nsuch a case it is better to begin with the simpler matters and\nprogress toward the end or goal.  (Lines 2002, pp. 254–263) \n\nThrough their rival claims about ordo doctrinae Zabarella and\nPiccolomini revealed as well very different perceptions of academic\nand civil order, and very different ways of conceiving and pursuing\nthe office of philosopher within that order. Zabarella wholeheartedly\nendorsed the purely contemplative nature of philosophy and the\nsuperiority of the contemplative life (Mikkeli 1992, pp. 25–35). He\nalso was frequently dismissive in his treatment of the disciplines he\nregarded as active or operative, for example law, medicine, ethics,\npolitics and mechanics. Piccolomini’s position was sharply\nopposed. For him, philosophy is, indeed, crucial for the spiritual\nperfection of man. However, in the form of scientia civilis\nit is also the key to the this-wordly perfection that can be attained\nin the just administration of the Venetian republic (Jardine\n1997). \n\nThe so-called regressus-method is a model for combining\ncomposition and resolution: the idea of this combinatory process is\nfound in the Aristotelian tradition from Averroes on, and it was\nvitally revived among the Italian Aristotelians and medical authors.\nAccording to this method, the natural philosopher should first infer\nfrom the known effect the existence of the cause of this very effect.\nSometimes he may use induction, but usually resolution, which was also\ncalled demonstratio quia or demonstration from the fact. Then\nin the second step, in the so-called demonstratio propter\nquid or demonstration from the reasoned fact (or composition),\nthe natural philosopher should infer from the cause to the effect. The\neffect is now known through its cause, and hence in a scientific\nmanner (Risse 1983). The crucial problem with this procedure is how to\navoid mere circular reasoning, or rather, how to make sure that the\ncause, whose existence is demonstrated in the first step, is indeed\nthe cause of this very effect. From the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury, it had become clear that it was necessary to introduce a\nthird, intermediary step, which involved some kind of intellectual\nconsideration (negotiatio intellectus) (Kessler 1998,\np. 838). \n\nZabarella also had to face the question, how the intellect in fact\nmade this mental consideration. He solves the problem in terms of his\npsychology of knowledge and calls this third step a mental examination\n(examen mentale). Since for him the task of this intermediary\nstep is to make distinct the confused knowledge of the cause that was\nacquired through the first step, he refers to his work on the agent\nmind (Liber de mente agente) in which he develops an account\nof the transformation of confused into distinct knowledge through the\nanalysis of a given whole in terms of its parts. He presents this\nprocess as the specific ability of the human mind. Thus once more\nmethod as a means of acquiring knowledge is based on the cognitive\nstructure of knowing subject rather than on the ontological structure\nof the object of knowledge. In his commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics Zabarella identified Aristotle’s proofs that the\nplanets are near and that the moon is a sphere as instances of the\nregressus-method. Other examples of the same method he\nanalyzed are Aristotle’s proof of the existence of “first\nmatter” (materia prima) from substantial change and his\nproof of an “eternal first mover” (primus motor\naeternus) from local motion (Wallace 1999, p. 338). \n\nThe interminable discussion of the methodology of arts and sciences in\nthe sixteenth century may be seen as an attempt to defend the\nscientific status of either the recently found autonomous sciences,\nlike natural philosophy, or, on the other hand, the empirically based\nproductive arts. The discussions of orders and methods, resolutions,\ncompositions and the regressus-method are, therefore, not\nmerely further elaborations of an old Aristotelian tradition, but also\nexpressions of opinions in a lively debate concerning the changing\nrelationships between various arts and sciences in sixteenth-century\nItalian universities (Mikkeli 1997, p. 228). \n\nThe most influential section in the Aristotelian tradition, where the\nrelationship between the theoretical or speculative sciences is dealt\nwith, is the beginning of Aristotle’s treatise On the Soul.\nAristotle gives two criteria for the hierarchy: the dignity of their\nsubject-matter and the exactness of their demonstrations. In his\nposthumous commentary on De anima Zabarella raises the\nquestion of the hierarchy of the sciences. In most cases, in\nZabarella’s view, the science with a nobler subject-matter can be\nconsidered superior, but not always. All human knowledge can be\ncompared and there are no grounds for giving either of these criteria\nabsolute priority. In the contemplative sciences the nobility of the\nsubject-matter should be considered superior to the causality of\nknowledge. In logic, however, where the instruments of science are\nconsidered, the nobler instrument is the one that is more precise and\nproduces more certain knowledge. \n\nZabarella, then, did not give one decisive criterion according to\nwhich all arts and sciences could be arranged into one single\nhierarchy. However, when dealing with the place of the science of the\nsoul among the other sciences, Zabarella gives an description of the\nnobility of this part of natural philosophy. Zabarella opposed the\ndefinition of the science of the soul as a middle discipline between\nphysics and metaphysics. He states that Aristotle did not only wish to\ncompare the science of the soul with other sciences, but to compare it\nwith other parts of natural science. In Zabarella’s view it is obvious\nthat the science of the soul is the most noble part of natural\nphilosophy, the king and emperor of every other part, which are all\ndependent upon it, because it shows the first cause and the sum of\neverything that is in animals and in plants. The science of the soul\nis more exquisite and certain than all the parts of natural\nphilosophy, because the causes of the science of the soul are more\nexact, not only to us, but also according to nature (Mikkeli 1997,\np. 220). \n\nZabarella’s position here can be interpreted as an attempt to raise\nthe status of an independent natural philosophy by emphasizing the\nnobility of the science of the soul. In fact, it seems that he wanted\nto elevate the status of De anima to that of a special\nscience among other natural disciplines that is the noblest and most\nprecise of all natural sciences on which all the other parts of\nnatural philosophy could rely. What in the medieval times had perhaps\nbeen considered to be part of metaphysics was now the most valuable\npart of natural philosophy. Following the Alexandrian tradition,\nZabarella himself left the question of the immortality of the soul to\nthe theologians, because it did not belong to natural philosophy, and\nsince Aristotle, as a natural philosopher, had not been explicit about\nit (Kessler 2011, p. 52). It is, in fact, hard to be sure, whether\nZabarella himself thought that the soul was mortal. However, in his\ncommentary on Aristotle’s treatise On the Soul Zabarella\ntried at least to prove that Aristotle himself did not consider it\nimmortal (Mitrovic 2009; Valverde 2012). \n\nZabarella reconstructed the process of intellection on the lines of\nsense-perception, that is that the intelligible species,\nproduced concurrently by the phantasma and the illuminating\nagent intellect, moved the possible intellect into cognition. To be\nknown, the phantasma, which was gained by sense-perception,\nhad to undergo a double process. Itself material and consequently\ncontaining the universal structure needed in science only in a\nconfused and unintelligible way, it had to be illuminated by the agent\nintellect, so that the universal in the individual was rendered\ndistinct and intelligible. Since the illumination was generally\nrequired for any act of knowledge in the same way, its agent did not\nhave to be an individual operating individually in the different acts\nof intellection, but rather could be an universal one, which rendered\nreality in general intelligible, thus serving as an all-embracing\nguarantee of intelligibility. The agent intellect could therefore be\nidentified with God himself as the principle of intelligibility. When\nidentifying the active intellect with God as the first cause of all\nthat exists and can be known, Zabarella has clearly in his mind that\nthe active intellect does no longer play a substantial role in this\nnaturalistic philosophy of nature after this initial act of intellection (Kessler 2011, pp. 56–57). \n\nTherefore with the metaphysical requirements of intellection taken for\ngranted, the main epistemological problem shifted to the manner in\nwhich the intelligible species was turned into a known\nobject.  Zabarella, considering the agent intellect as the divine\ncause of general intelligibility, could renounce innate principles and\nretain the Aristotelian teaching of the inductive acquisition of the\nfirst principles themselves. But Zabarella had instead the problem of\nrestoring to the human mind an active faculty which would account for\nthe act of judgement. Therefore he redefined the possible intellect as\nan active faculty as well. This equally active and passive human\nintellect (which Zabarella called patibilis instead of\npossibilis) considered all that was offered to it by the\nilluminated phantasma, contemplated whatever it wanted to,\nand in doing so selected and abstracted those structures it wished to\nknow and through judging understood them and became itself the object\nof knowledge. For Zabarella intellection therefore was not a process\nautomatically determined whenever an exterior impulse was given, but\nrather depended essentially on human will and intention. In\nZabarella’s view, the science of the soul was concerned with what was\nnecessary and therefore always equally present in any human mind, even\nif unconsciously. Methodology, on the other hand, was concerned with\nthe use a human being made of these natural faculties. Since this use\ncould be true or false, better or worse, truth and error depended\nentirely on whether or not the correct method was being used (Kessler\n1988, pp. 530–534). \n\nNatural philosophy has to know and teach the very essence of natural\nbeings. First, it has to deal with their basic principles, such as\nmatter and motion, which are not natural beings themselves. These\nprinciples of natural philosophy are discussed in Aristotle’s\nPhysics. Moreover, natural philosophy has to deal with the\naccidents of natural beings understood through their causes. These are\nthe subject of Aristotle’s other writings on nature, from On the\nHeavens to On the Soul (on Zabarella’s ideas\non Physics, see Biard 2005). \n\nIn De naturalis scientiae constitutione, the first treatise\nin his collected works on natural philosophy (De rebus\nnaturalibus), Zabarella deals in detail with the questions of the\norder and perfection of the natural sciences. He claims, for example,\nthat the book on minerals is necessary because the natural philosophy\nwould otherwise be incomplete. The place of the book on minerals in\nAristotelian corpus on natural philosophy is immediately\nafter the book On Meteorology. Whether Aristotle himself\nwrote on minerals is questionable, but he at least recognized the\nimportance of the subject. However, later both Theophrastus and\nAlbertus Magnus wrote on this important subject. Thus Zabarella did\nnot consider Aristotle’s works as a complete corpus to which\nnothing could be added. In De methodis Zabarella states that\nAristotle wrote on subjects of his own choice, but it would be an\nexaggeration to claim that he was incapable of making\nmistakes. Aristotle was not infallible and it would be erroneous to\ninsist that he knew the truth of everything he wrote. Nevertheless, he\nwas an outstanding scholar in Zabarella’s view, who, for example,\nturned the study of logic into a discipline. \n\nIn the last chapter of De naturalis scientiae constitutione\nZabarella discusses the question of the perfection of the natural\nsciences (De perfectione scientiae naturalis ac de eius\nordine). Zabarella states that Aristotle’s philosophy of nature\nmay be perfect in structure and form, but it is incomplete in terms of\nits reference to natural beings. There is much Aristotle did not\ndiscuss at all and indeed much that was outside his cognisance.\nAlthough he dealt comparatively little with plants and animals, it is\nnot difficult to pinpoint their proper palces in the Aristotelian\nsystem of the natural sciences. Therefore Zabarella emphasizes that\nAristotle’s philosophy of nature is complete at least in theory.\nZabarella compares Aristotle’s works on natural philosophy to the\ngeometry and arithmetic of Euclid. There are many theorems which can\nbe demonstrated from his works even if he did not himself actually\nwrite them. For Zabarella this is no reason to judge Euclid’s geometry\nor arithmetic defective or incomplete. If Euclid had wished, he could\nhave demonstrated all the particular cases, but his book would have\nbecome so enormous that it surely would have daunted the reader.\nZabarella suggests that this is exactly why Euclid entitled his book\nThe Elements, and from this foundation all the other theorems\ncan be demonstrated. \n\nIn parallel view Zabarella thinks that Aristotle’s natural philosophy\ncan be called perfect, since it deals with all the knowledge that is\npossible for human intellect to obtain, either in practice or at least\nin theory. Also in his logical works Zabarella emphasizes the idea of\na perfect natural philosophy, which consists of a perfect and distinct\nknowledge of natural beings through their causes. Zabarella reminds\nthat scientific knowledge can never be called confused or\nimperfect. Therefore the scientific ideal Zabarella presents is\nprofoundly different from the modern view of a scientist making new\ndiscoveries. According to Zabarella, science can be “new”\nonly in a restricted sense; the work of a scientist is more like\ncorrecting the mistakes and filling the gaps in a ready-made\nAristotelian world-system (Mikkeli 1992; 1997, pp. 214–215; 2010,\np. 189) \n\nAmong the Paduan Aristotelians Zabarella was probably the author who\ndiscussed most thoroughly the relationship between the philosophy of\nnature and medical art. While in subject-matter these disciplines were\nclose to each other, in their essence and methodology they were far\napart. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Zabarella did not consider\nmedicine to subalternated to the philosophy of nature. Nor did he see\nthe distinction between theoretical and practical medicine as\naccidental; instead he wanted to consider the whole art of medicine as\noperational. In spite of medicine’s prominent place among the arts;\nZabarella sharply denied its scientific status, and insisted that\nwriters who claim that medicine is a science are mistaken. Neither the\nart of medicine nor its singular parts can be considered as science.\nFor him it was enough to admit that it is the noblest of all arts. \n\nIn his De natura logicae (part of the Opera logica)\nZabarella attacks writers who put medicine alongside the philosophy of\nnature among the sciences. Contemplative philosophy appropriates\nnothing from the productive arts, but instead the arts adopt\neverything from philosophy. No matter how valuable and precise\nmedicine may be, it could never be a science because it is practised\nnot for the sake of knowledge, but for an end product: that is, the\nmaintenance or restoration of health. If knowledge of the human body\nis considered purely for its own sake, rather than for curative\npurposes, it should be called natural philosophy rather than\nmedicine. Even if it were admitted that medicine could be practised\nfor the sake of knowledge, it could not be called a pure science,\nbecause it does not explain the first causes, and without this\ncomprehension the other causes cannot be clearly apprehended. Health\ncannot be fully comprehended and the goal of medicine cannot be\nachieved, if a physician does not comprehend all the parst of a human\nbody and their nature, composition, purpose, and function. \n\nZabarella recognizes two different ways in which a physician can know\nthe parts of a human body. First, he may learn them through perceptive\nknowledge and anatomical observations, thereby assimilating the matter\nof his discipline without understanding its rationale. A physician can\nalso become familiar with the parts of human body through philosophy\nof nature where he may learn the reasons, which lie behind what he\nactually sees. Zabarella thinks Aristotle made the same distinction in\nhis books the History of Animals and the Parts of\nAnimals. In the first he relies on sense perception to classify\nthe different parts of animals. In the second, he offers causal\nexplanations for what he is considering. In Zabarella’s opinion this\norder of understanding results from our own inability to comprehend\neverything at once. It is thus better to progress gradually from\nconfuse to distinct knowledge. In De rebus naturalibus\nZabarella points out that the art of medicine adopts the physiological\npart from the philosophy of nature. If medical writers want to know\nthe anatomy of the human body, they must therefore follow Aristotle\nmethodologically. Therefore they should not study the History of\nAnimals, but instead the Parts of Animals, which shows\nus the functions of different parts of the bodies in question. The\nsubject-matter of medicine involves maintaining or recovering health\nonly in human beings, not in other animals. Since the whole discipline\ndeals only with the human body, it cannot be a science in Zabarella’s\nview. What a natural philosopher writes about animals, a medical\nwriter should apply to human beings. \n\nZabarella moves from the universal and scientific discussion of\nnatural philosophy to a consideration of its particular aspects from\nthe standpoint of operation, not knowledge. Moreover, Zabarella\nbelieved that natural philosophy and medicine differ not only in their\naims and subject-matters, but also in their methods. The resolutive\nmethod is proper to medicine and the compositive method to the\nphilosophy of nature. A physician does not use demonstrations, and if\nhe does, he borrows them from natural philosophy. In medical art the\nresolutive order of presentation proceeds from knowledge to cure. The\nend, that is maintaining or recovering health, is broken down into\nprinciples, on which the operation is then based. In the order of\npresentation Zabarella wants to differentiate between the presentation\nof a whole discipline and that of a part of it. For example, the first\npart of the art of medicine, physiology, has a compositive order as\nagainst the medicine as a whole, which is arranged according to a\nresolutive order. In Zabarella’s view this shows that physiology\ndoes not really belong to medicine at all, but to natural philosophy,\nbecause in physiology the nature of a human body is studied apart from\noperation. \n\nZabarella’s conclusion about the relationship between the art\nof medicine and natural philosophy is that the latter must consider the\nuniversal qualities of health and sickness, while the former\nconcentrates on finding remedies for particular diseases. Zabarella\nsuggests that Aristotle wrote a book of health and sickness of which\nnothing but a small fragment remains. These fragments are on the\nborderline of these two disciplines. Zabarella sums this up: where the\nphilosopher ends, there the physician begins (ubi desinit\nphilosophus, ibi incipit medicus). From the universal\nconsideration of sickness and health the physician descends to the\ntreatment of all particular diseases and to knowledge of their causes.\nWhile discussing the principles of medical art Zabarella compares\nanatomical principles with principles derived from natural philosophy.\nIn his view, only the philosophy of nature, not anatomy, can provide a\nsolid basis for medical practioners (Mikkeli 1997, pp. 221–225). \n\nFrom the things considered above, it becomes clear that Zabarella\ncannot be considered as a precursor of modern experimental science. In\nspite of its empirical basis, Zabarella’s natural philosophy is not\nconcerned with anything akin to experiment. Indeed, if experiments\nwere to be developed, they would find their place in the productive\narts rather than in natural philosophy. Zabarella did not use\nexperiments in order to verify or falsify theories in the modern\nsense.  (Schmitt 1969) However, he made observations of natural\nthings, but they were just made to exemplify and illustrate the\ndemonstrative reasoning used in the theoretical natural\nphilosophy (Rossi 1983, p. 146). \n\nDuring the past decades Zabarella’s name has been linked to modern\nscience. John Herman Randall published already in 1940 (and again in\n1961) his famous idea on “the School of Padua” that would\nhave been the precursor of modern science. Following Ernst Cassirer,\nRandall referred to the Renaissance discussions of\nregressus-method up to Zabarella as a preparation for Galileo\nGalilei’s new method of natural science. However, the Aristotelian\nterminology and doctrines that Zabarella and Galileo share, seem for\nthe most part to have been commonplaces of late medieval and\nRenaissance thought. Galileo may have known Zabarella’s writings, but\nfar more important source for Galileo was the Jesuit scholars, above\nall Paolo della Valle, working at the Collegio Romano at\nRome (Wallace 1999, p. 338). \n\nInstead of overemphasizing the connection between Zabarella and\nGalileo, it should be noted that Zabarella’s thought had a large\nimpact among Protestant Aristotelians in Germany and in the Low\nCountries during the late sixteenth century and first part of the\nseventeenth century (Backus 1989; Maclean 2002). Zabarella’s books\nwere known even in the remote Scandinavian countries surprisingly\nearly already at the turn of the seventeenth-century (Mikkeli\n2002). Zabarella’s clear and systematic interpretation of Aristotle’s\nlogic and natural philosophy was used as a basis for numerous\nAristotelian textbooks printed in Germany. Moreover, the Protestant\nacademics found Zabarella’s instrumentalist view of logic useful for\ntheir theological purposes (Kusukawa 2002). Also in the British Isles\nthe Scholastic revival of the early seventeenth century owed much to\nZabarella’s writings (Sgarbi 2012; Sgarbi 2013, 53–78). Recently\nthere has been some considerations whether Zabarella’s distinction\nbetween the objects of science (res considerata) and the way\nof considering (modus considerandi) had an impact on the\ndistinction between matter and form in Immanuel Kant’s philosophy\n(Sgarbi 2010). Even some modern scholars of Aristotle have still\nconsulted his commentaries with profit.","contact.mail":"heikki.mikkeli@helsinki.fi","contact.domain":"helsinki.fi"}]
