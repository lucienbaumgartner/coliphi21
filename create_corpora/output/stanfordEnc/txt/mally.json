Though he is best\nknown for his work on Meinong’s theory of objects (Gegenstandstheorie)\nand for his development of deontic logic, he has also gained some\nnotoriety for his German-nationalist convictions and his support of\nNational Socialist ideology. On the one hand, Mally’s contribution to\nMeinong’s theory of objects is not a mere extension of his teacher’s\nwork, but rather a real alternative that, in turn, influenced Meinong’s\nown conceptions. Moreover, he was the first philosopher to establish a\nformal system of deontic logic (see the entry on\n Mally’s deontic logic),\n and though, according to most philosophers, it was\nseriously flawed, it was a major undertaking and only recently received\nthe attention it was due. On the other hand, some of Mally’s later\nwritings were particularly influenced by his sympathies for National\nSocialism. In what follows, we will identify and outline the various\nstrands of his thought, and also address the delicate question of\nwhether and how his sympathies for National Socialism affected his\nlater philosophical work.\n\n\n\nErnst Mally was born October 11, 1879 in Krainburg, then a town of\nthe Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and today Kranj in Slovenia. After the\ndeath of his father in 1888, the family moved to Laibach, today\nLjubljana, the capital of Slovenia. There, Mally attended the Gymnasium\nfrom 1890 to 1898. At this time, Mally already formed a nationalist\nattitude, becoming a supporter of Georg Ritter von Schönerer, the\nleader of the Austrian “deutschnationale Bewegung”, a\nGerman national, anti-semitic, anti-liberal and anti-catholic group\nthat demanded the “Anschluss” (annexation) of Austria to\nGermany even before the First World War. During his years in the\nGymnasium, Mally developed a serious interest in philosophy, and in\n1898, he started studying philosophy with Alexius Meinong at the\nUniversity of Graz, Austria. There he also studied mathematics and\nphysics, for he felt that this would enable him to achieve greater\nprecision in his philosophical thinking and writings. During this time,\nMally developed a special interest in formal logic. \n\nMally earned his philosophical doctorate in 1903, with the\ndissertation Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie des\nMessens (Investigations in the Object Theory of\nMeasurement), which was published in 1904. Alexius Meinong was\nhis supervisor. In 1906, he started teaching at a Gymnasium in Graz,\nyet stayed in contact with the university, especially with Meinong and\nthe then already famous Laboratory for Experimental Psychology, which\nhad been founded by Meinong in 1894. In 1913, Mally became Dozent with\nhis Habilitation thesis, which was titled Gegenstandstheoretische\nGrundlagen der Logik und Logistik (Object-theoretic\nFoundations for Logics and Logistics) and published in\n1912. Again, Alexius Meinong was his supervisor.  During World War I,\nMally served in the Austrian Army from 1915 to 1918. In this period,\nMally contracted “a serious disease called rheumatoid arthritis,\n[resulting] in a 70% invalidity that led to a growing and painful\nimmobility” (Wolf 1971: 3), lasting for the rest of his\nlife. After the end of the war, he started teaching at the University\nof Graz, where he eventually succeeded to Meinong’s Chair in 1925. He\nstayed there until 1942. After his retirement, he moved to Schwanberg,\nStyria, where he lived two more years and died rather unexpectedly\nMarch 8, 1944. For an extended biography of Mally in German, see\nRoschitz 2016a, and also Roschitz 2016b, ch.3, 15–44. \n\nMally was trained not only in philosophy but also in mathematics,\nand was influenced by Ernst Schröder, and later, of course, by\nWhitehead and Russell. He therefore learned how to apply modern logical\nmethods to philosophical theories, and in particular to the theory of\nobjects (Gegenstandstheorie) developed by his teacher Alexius Meinong\nas well as to the theory of norms in his development of deontic logic.\nAmong the Austrian philosophers, Mally was one of the pioneers of\nformal methods in discussing philosophical problems. Note that Mally’s\ndisciple Hans Mokre was the first to translate the introductory\nchapters to Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica into German,\nwith Mally’s assistance (Russell/Whitehead 1932). Mally had originally\nplanned to translate the complete Principia himself. \n\nSince many of the problems giving rise to the theories of objects\nare covered elsewhere in this encyclopedia, we restrict ourselves to a\nvery short sketch of what led to Mally’s contribution to that field.\nOne of the main impulses for the development of theories of objects\nwere the problems that arose in connection with\n intentionality.\nMally’s teacher Meinong followed Brentano in concluding that the\ndistinctive and defining feature of intentional mental acts is that\nthey are always directed towards something. That is, thinking,\nbelieving, intending, etc., all involve thinking, believing, or\nintending something. Meinong took this a step further by believing that\nwe have to be ontologically generous when analyzing intentional mental\nacts: every such act is directed towards an object, even if sometimes\nthat object does not or cannot exist. So, when we search for the\nfountain of youth or think about the round square (and conclude that\nthe latter is impossible), Meinong required that there be such objects\nlike the fountain of youth and the round square. According to Meinong,\nthe former is an object (the waters of which confer everlasting life\nbut) which doesn’t exist, while the latter is an object which is round,\nsquare, and which couldn’t exist. (For a more complete discussion of\nMeinong’s theory of nonexistent objects, see the entry on\n nonexistent objects.) \n\nThis ontologically generous attitude commits us to the acceptance of\ncontradictory and incomplete objects: if we accept contradictory\nobjects then we are at least dangerously close to tolerating\ncontradictions (unless we take appropriate precautions), and if we\naccept incomplete objects, we deny the intuitively plausible Law of\nExcluded Middle, namely, that for any property P, an object either has\nP or fails to have P (tertium non\ndatur). Meinong adopted one of Mally’s distinctions for solving\nthe first of these problems, namely, the distinction between nuclear\n(formal/konstitutorisch) and extra-nuclear\n(außerformal/außerkonstitutorisch)\nproperties (see Meinong 1915: 176; Findlay 1963: 176; as well as\nsection 4.4.3 of the entry on Alexius Meinong). But later, Mally\ndeveloped an even more profound distinction with which he was able to\ncope with the incompleteness problem as well. \n\nMally’s first work on Meinong’s theory of objects is the published\nversion of his dissertation (Mally 1904). His own, mature theory of\nobjects can be found in the published version of his Habilitation\nthesis (Mally 1912). (For a detailed comparison of the two theories,\nsee Poli 1998.) Mally addressed the topic also in his later works,\ntaking a critical point of view with respect to Meinong’s as well as\nhis own theory (Mally 1935, 1938b, 1971). Since Mally’s\ntheory of objects is one of his most interesting and most influential\ncontributions to philosophy, we want to provide a more detailed account\nof the theory itself as well as of the problems it seems to be able to\nsolve, in the following section. \n\nMally’s most important distinction was between an object’s being\ndetermined (determiniert sein) by a property and an object’s satisfying\n(erfüllen) a property. This distinction allowed Mally to speak of\nobjects that are neither contradictory nor incomplete (with respect to\nsatisfaction), although they may be contradictory or incomplete with\nrespect to determination: \nEvery object satisfies a complete complex of objectives and is thus\n“complete” with respect to its actual determinations. But\nthere are objects that are mere formdeterminates of certain (defining)\nobjectives (without satisfying these objectives): such an object is\nonly incompletely determined by its defining objective (which is an\nincomplete complex of objectives), and thus it has to be called\n“incomplete” with respect to its formal determination.\nNevertheless, according to the first statement, it is complete with\nrespect to the objectives it satisfies: since it satisfies the\nobjective to be the formdeterminate of its definition, and it also\nsatisfies everything implied by this objective. (Mally 1912: 76; this\ntranslation, and all subsequent translations, by the authors) \n\nIt would help to reread this passage with the following interpretative\nsuggestions in mind. First, following Zalta (1983), we want to\ninterpret Mally’s notion of objectives (Objektive) in terms\nof the modern notion of a property, though the notion of\nattribute would also be appropriate. The linguistic expressions which\nsignify objectives are just open formulas like\n‘Px’, ‘Rxy’, etc. Therefore,\nin what follows, we use ‘property’ instead of\n‘objective’. Second, we can understand Mally’s notion of\nsatisfying an objective in terms of the modern notion\nof instantiating or exemplifying a property. Finally, let us\nreplace Mally’s talk of ‘formdeterminates’ by the talk of\n‘conceptual objects’. In contrast to ordinary\nobjects, the characteristic form of conceptual objects is determined\nby certain properties rather than by the properties it may\ninstantiate.  Although we have made these terminological substitutions\nfor interpreting Mally, we hope that the new terminology is close to\nMally’s original intent. So, using our modern terminology, we would\nsay that conceptual objects are determined by a certain group of\nproperties and don’t necessarily instantiate the properties that\ndetermine them.  Moreover, the property of being a conceptual object\nis one which implies that the objects which instantiate it are\nabstract entities. For an alternative interpretation of Mally’s\nconcept of determination, understood as encoding, see Linsky 2014. \n\nWith Zalta’s interpretation in mind, we can understand the above\npassage from Mally as follows. According to Mally, a group of\nproperties determines a conceptual object and thereby ensures that\nthere is such an object. E.g., the property of being triangular (alone)\ndetermines the conceptual object we might identify as the triangle.\nThis object is conceptual because it is not the case that it is a\nspecific triangle in the ordinary sense of the verb ‘to be’\n(understood as a copula). Mally would say the triangle does not\ninstantiate the property of being triangular. But since every object is\ncomplete with respect to instantiation, the triangle instantiates the\nproperty of being non-triangular. Indeed, this latter property is\nimplied by the property of being a conceptual object. Or, to put it in\na different way: the property of being triangular is excluded by the\nproperty of being a conceptual object—conceptual objects have\nno shape at all. (For the concept of inclusion (Einschließung),\nsee Mally 1912: 4 ff.) This results in the claim that the triangle is\nnon-triangular, which is perfectly understandable if we understand\n‘is’ in the sense of ‘instantiates’.\nAdditionally, Mally offers us an algebra of properties that ensures\nthat for each given property F there is an property non-F, i.e., its\nnegation, which behaves in the usual manner (see Mally 1912: 14 ff.).\nFor example, he implicitly assumes that instantiating non-F is\nmaterially equivalent to not instantiating F: x instantiates non-F iff x does not instantiate F. \n\nNow, if there were objects incomplete with respect to instantiation\nproblems would arise, since the law tertium non datur would be\nviolated. For example, if we ask the question, is the triangle\nright-angled, then the Law of Excluded Middle tells us that either it\nis right-angled or it is not. Although the conceptual object identified\nabove as the triangle neither is determined by being right-angled nor\nis it determined by being non-right-angled, it nevertheless\ninstantiates the property of being non-right-angled. So, according to\nMally, for every property F and every object x, the following\nholds: x instantiates F or x instantiates non-F. \n\nEach object, whether it is conceptual or not, either instantiates a\nproperty or its negation. The triangle instantiates the property of\nbeing abstract, but not its negation; it does not instantiate the\nproperty of being triangular, but it instantiates its negation. There\nis, of course, no object that instantiates both a property F and its\nnegation non-F, since this would clearly be a contradiction. \n\nOn the other hand, there are objects, namely, conceptual ones, that\nare incomplete with respect to determination. So the following is a\nconsequence of Mally’s theory: \nThere is an x and there is an F such that x is\nnot determined by F and x is not determined by\nnon-F. \n\nNote that this consequence of Mally’s theory does not violate any\nlogical principle because (a) being determined by F does not imply\ninstantiating F, and (b) not being determined by F does not imply being\ndetermined by non-F. There are objects that are not determined by a\nproperty F, but which are also not determined by non-F; as noted above,\nthe triangle is not determined by being right-angled, but it is also\nnot determined by being non-right-angled; the triangle is only\ndetermined by being triangular. \n\nThere are even objects that are determined by contradictory\nproperties; Mally would assert the following: \nThere is an x and there is an F such that x is\ndetermined by F and x is determined by non-F. \n\nThe non-square square may be seen as such an object. But, again, no\nlogical principles are being violated, because being determined by\nnon-F does not imply not being determined by F, nor does its being\ndetermined by these properties imply that it instantiates them. \n\nAs is well known, Bertrand Russell criticized Meinong’s theory\nof objects in “On Denoting” (Russell 1905: 482–484).\n(See also the entry on\nnonexistent objects\n (section 4), as well as the\nentry on Alexius Meinong, section 4.4.) According to Russell, Meinong\nhas to accept entities like the round square: \nthe round square\nis round, and also not round […]. But this is intolerable; and\nif any theory can be found to avoid this result, it is surely to be\npreferred. (Russell 1905: 438) \nAs we have already seen above,\nMally’s theory of objects is a theory that avoids this result. For\nMally, it holds that there is an x such that x is determined by\nroundness and x is determined by non-roundness. But we have already\nshown above that this is no problem, because it does not violate any\nlogical law. \n\nConceptual objects can be incomplete and even contradictory with\nrespect to the properties that determine them, but neither of these\ncircumstances violates a logical law. Like ordinary objects, conceptual\nobjects are always complete and consistent with respect to\ninstantiation, and thus the laws of logic are respected. Now, these\nconceptual objects serve as the content of intentionally directed acts.\nMally says that there may be no object that is instantiated by the\nproperties we posit (setzen) in our judgments, but there is always a\nconceptual object that is determined by these properties. Intentional\nacts will never be deprived of their content. \n\nWe want to stress that ordinary concrete objects are not determined\nby any property, they merely instantiate properties. So, the current\nPope, e.g., instantiates the properties of being human, being Catholic,\netc., but there is no property that determines the current Pope. On the\nother hand, there is the conceptual object which we could call\n‘the Pope’ which is determined by being Pope. Indeed,\nMally’s view also allows us to talk about the Pope*, which is\ndetermined by all the properties implied by (included in) being the\nPope. Understood this way, the Pope and the Pope* are neither human nor\nCatholic nor do they instantiate any other “ordinary”\nproperty. These conceptual objects are abstract, and are determined by\nbeing Pope, being human, being Catholic, etc. The Pope is, like the\ntriangle, a conceptual object (Begriffsgegenstand), while the (current)\nPope is concrete and a living human being. (Note that we use the verb\n‘to be’ in the sense of ‘to instantiate’,\nbecause we think that this suits best the everyday intuitions about the\nmeaning of ‘to be’, understood as a copula.) Mally says,\n“we grasp through the conceptual object at the object which\ninstantiates a set of determinations” (Findlay 1963: 183). In our\nexample, we apprehend the current Pope by way of the abstract\nconceptual object the Pope*, which is determined by all the properties\nimplied by being the current Pope. \n\nWe see from the above that the existence of conceptual objects\ndepends on which properties are accepted. If we assume with Mally that\nwe have a full Boolean Algebra of properties then the only question\nleft to be answered, is: what are the primitive properties? We can only\nmake a suggestion inspired by the theory of intentionality here: the\nprimitive properties are all the non-complex properties that can be\nposited by the subject(s). (For other English translations of crucial\npassages of Mally’s work on his theory of objects, as well as a summary\nof Mally’s theory of conceptual objects, see Zalta 1998.) \n\nMally’s theory of objects has been acknowledged and validated in Zalta\n1983 and 1988 (see also Rapaport 1978, for an informal development of\nsomething like Mally’s view, though the ideas developed there are\ntraced to Meinong, not Mally). Zalta utilizes Mally’s ideas and\nconceptions in order to establish a full-fledged axiomatic theory of\nabstract objects that ensures the existence of these objects with the\nhelp of comprehension principles. Zalta also translated Mally’s\nterminology into modern terms by formulating the distinction between\nan object x instantiating and being determined by a property\nF in terms of the distinction between x’s exemplifying\nproperty F (‘Fx’) and x’s encoding\nproperty F (‘xF’). Zalta calls exemplifying\nand encoding two (different) “modes of predication”. But\nthere is some controversy as to whether Mally’s distinction in two\nmodes of predication can be reduced to the distinction between nuclear\nand extranuclear properties (recall, this is a distinction introduced\nby Mally but adopted by Meinong in his work). Dale Jacquette calls\nMally’s introduction of these two modes of predication “Mally’s\nheresy” (see Jacquette 1989: 3). He tried to show that the\ndistinction between nuclear and extranuclear properties is “more\nfundamental” than the distinction between two modes of\npredication in the sense that there is a reduction of the latter to\nthe former but not vice versa (see Jacquette 1989: 5).  However, Zalta\nshowed (1992) that a reduction of two modes of predication to two\nkinds of property has not yet been developed.  Moreover, Mally’s\ntheory (in modern guise) can cope at least with all the problems\nMeinong’s theory can solve. Along these lines, Mally’s student Findlay\nwrote,  \n[Mally’s theory] removes many\ndifficulties in Meinong’s theory, without abandoning the general\nstandpoint of the theory of objects. (Findlay 1963: 110) \n\nMally therefore established a real alternative to Meinong’s theory\nof objects; his theory avoided different modes of being (such as\nMeinong’s famous Außersein) as well as the duplication required\nby the distinction between nuclear and extranuclear properties. (In\nreconstructions of Meinong’s theory, e.g., Parsons 1980, every\npredicate has both a nuclear and an extranuclear version, and this is\navoided in Mally’s theory.) Mally’s theory, however, requires an\nontology with a sufficient number of properties—enough to\njointly determine all the conceptual objects we might use to cognize\nand conceptualize ordinary everyday objects. And, of course, it also\npresupposes a kind of comprehension principle that guarantees the\n(abstract) existence of these conceptual objects determined by its\nproperties. \n\nWe have seen in detail now that even in his earlier ontological\nwritings Mally developed viable alternatives to Meinong’s theory of\nobjects. Later he distanced himself from Meinong’s philosophy. In\nunpublished letters to Hans Pichler, Mally writes: \n\nI realized that the theory of objects is based on a big mistake; it\ncan be described as a mix-up of intending and grasping. […]\nMeinong’s fundamental error is his mistaking the (objective) meaning\nand content of a thought for an object (or the object) of the thought.\n[…] Once you have realized this, you are done with the theory of\nobjects, and with the foundations of Meinong’s philosophy as well.\n(Mally 1934a, January 5 1934) \n\nIt may well be that you [Hans Pichler] are already caught by\nMeinong’s thoughts like by an infection, which has to take effect in\norder for its antidote to develop. That is how I experienced it. (Mally\n1934a, January 6 1934) \n\nMally’s critical stance towards Meinong’s philosophy paved the way\nto his new ontological conceptions, which we want to discuss in the\nnext section. \n\nIn his later works, Mally criticized Meinong’s “static\nconception” of objects (Mally 1935, 1938b, 1971).\nMeinong and many other philosophers shared and still share the belief\nthat the world is constituted by completely determined elements or\ncompletely determined individual things and processes which taken\ntogether make up the universe. Christian von Ehrenfels\n(1859–1932), a student and friend of Meinong, doubted this view\nby pointing to the Gestaltproblem: when we consider a definite shape or\nGestalt, the parts of the shape are determined by the whole. For\nexample, the colored parts of the shape, when considered in their\nenvironment, differ from what they appear to be when each single part\nis presented to a spectator in isolation. Mally was influenced by this\nobservation and added that such colored parts, in isolation, are no\nlonger genuine elements of the whole, no longer determined objects.\nThus, whatever we can experience is—as a whole—only\nvaguely determined: the borderlines of things become more or less\nblurred; sometimes they appear sharper as in the case of tools,\nsometimes more hazy as in the case of clouds. \n\nAccording to Mally, reality objectively tends to a separation of\nindividual things, but this separation can or will never fully be\nreached, but only approximated. In other words, ours is a world without\nexact individual things; instead it is a world with a dynamic nature,\nwith many tendencies or strivings (Strebungen). In Mally 1935, there\nare many examples from everyday life with which he wants show that\nsubjects do not primarily apprehend rigid or static individual things,\nbut rather tendencies of events. For example, a portrait painting does\nnot show how a person looks at a given point of time and place, it\nrather expresses a certain tendency by indicating a direction to which\nthe painting “idealizes” the given status. Or, a plane\nsurface of a lake reminds us of the geometrical concept of a plane\nfigure, but actually the lake is only approximately plane. In this\nsense, even the so-called natural laws are precise expressions of\nnatural tendencies which are never fully realized. Mally writes, \nNo longer material elements, but probabilities (this is the\ntendency) of describable forms of happenings are the final\napprehensible which can be met by researching reality. (Mally\n1938b: 11; translation by the authors) \n\nWe conclude this section by noting again that Mally developed the\nfirst formal logical system of deontic logic, in Mally 1926. This\nsystem is described and analyzed in some detail in the entry\n Mally’s deontic logic.\n This entry explains how Mally introduced an operator (!) to\nform statements of the form ‘It ought to be the case that\nA’ (‘!A’), and how the logical axioms of his system\nimplied the following, problematic claim: !A ↔ A \n\nThis scheme states that something is obligatory if and only if it is\nthe case. In other words, in Mally’s system, the obligatory and the\nfactual collapse. This, of course, is unacceptable. The first one to\nshow this was Karl Menger in 1939. Further discussion of Mally’s\ndeontic logic can be found in Morscher 1998, as well as in the entry\ncited above, i.e., Lokhorst 2013a. We would like to reiterate\nLokhorst’s claim that despite the flaw in Mally’s deontic logic, his\n“pioneering effort deserves rehabilitation rather than\ncontempt”. See also Lokhorst’s papers on an intuitionistic\nreformulation of Mally’s deontic logic, where he tries to capture\nMally’s basic ideas whilst avoiding the collapse referred to above\n(Lokhorst 2013b and 2015). \n\nIt is to be noted, however, that a proper understanding and analysis\nof Mally’s deontic logic can only be reached through his\nparticular meta-ethical view. This will be sketched in \nsection 3, and it is also touched \nby Mally 1940 in his paper on\n“objective truth”. Yet not even the most recent study of\nthe critical work on Mally’s deontic logic (Krickler 2008) seems\nto be aware of Mally’s philosophy of values and its peculiar\ndescription of value (Wert) and ought\n (Sollen): “Value and ought\ncan only be understood via emotional presentation” (Mally 1926:\n74 or Mally 1971: 312). Much more about that will be explained in the\nfollowing section, especially at the end of\n section 3.3.3 below. \n\nMally’s entire philosophical oeuvre shows three tendencies\nthat indicate the philosophical heritage of Brentano and Meinong: 1.\nThe rehabilitation of the emotional versus the widespread\nintellectualism of his time, 2. the emphasis of what is objectively\ngiven versus subjectivism and 3. the philosophical re-discovery of the\nunity of reality and value versus all forms of dualism (Wolf 1952a:\n169). \n\nNew research on Mally’s philosophy in general, ethics, and\nlogic of norms has brought forward so far unknown material.\nMally’s unpublished work in the Library Archives of the\nUniversity of Graz contains a number of philosophical texts and\npersonal documents as well as private letters. Some lecture notes by\nMally himself seem to be of particular relevance, partly laid down in\nillegible shorthand. Yet some lecture notes have been edited by his\nstudents in manuscript form, especially the lecture notes of some\nVorlesungen between 1926 and 1938. It is to be expected that\nmore research work in the years to come will shed more light onto\nMally’s philosophical work and development. There are new indications\ncontained in those manuscripts that promise a deeper understanding of\nMally’s post-Meinongian philosophy, in particular his ethics and\ndeontic logic. Recently, Markus Roschitz published a book on Mally’s\npost-Meinongian philosophy (Roschitz 2016b). He mainly discusses Mally\n1935 (Erlebnis und Wirklichkeit), which Mally himself called\n“Zauberbuch” (“magical book”).\nRoschitz (2016b, Chapter 5) describes Mally’s four parts of a new\nontology and epistemology: (1) forms of objects and thinking, (2)\nreality and empirical knowledge, (3) sense and spirit, and (4) the\nlife of the soul. Mally’s three key notions for his ontological\ndiscussion of everything there is, concrete as well as abstract, are:\nform, striving, and fulfillment (see Roschitz 2016b, 177 ff.).\nRoschitz presents (Chapter 8) a summary and critical discussion of\nMally’s Wirklichkeitsphilosophie. In particular, he discusses\nMally’s concept of a magical experience and points out that Mally’s\ndoes not provide a rational criterion for distinguishing those magical\nexperiences from pure superstition (see Roschitz 2016b, 164 ff.). \n\nSo far, some of these texts have been studied to find a better\nanswer to the question to what degree Mally’s philosophy was influenced\nby National Socialism (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008). Among the aforementioned\nlecture manuscripts we find the following: “Ernst Mally: Value\nTheory and Ethics”. This is a lecture delivered by Mally at the\nUniversity of Graz, winter semester 1926/27, elaborated and typed by\nHans Mokre in 1927. \n\nIt seems justified to distinguish three phases of Mally’s work on\nvalue theory and ethics: \n\n(1) The early period until 1923 is influenced and coined by\nMeinong’s philosophy. Two years after Meinong’s death, Mally edited\nMeinong’s On the Foundation of a General Theory of Values (Meinong\n1923a). In his short preface to this volume, Mally points out that he\ndoes not see any reason to change or complement Meinong’s text. In\nother words, this ethical point of view is molded by Meinong’s value\nobjectivism: values exist independently of value experiences. Just as\nsensations are the basis of perceptual judgments, evaluations are the\nbasis of value judgments. The value of an object triggers, via\nemotional presentation (Meinong), a certain value experience or value\nfeeling in the subject. Mally accepted not only Meinong’s distinction\nbetween object and objective but also the distinction between\ndignitative (object based on feeling) and desiderative (object based on\nwilling). To the class of dignitatives, Meinong counted the classical\ntriad of true, good and beautiful (maybe even pleasant) (Meinong 1923b,\n120; see also the excellent summary of Meinong’s value philosophy from\na modern point of view in Reicher 2009: 114 ff.). Mally continued his\ninvestigations in value theory on this foundation of the\n natural law tradition in ethics\n (Wolf 1952b; see also below 3.3.1). \n\n(2) Mally has then developed his own views on value theory and ethics,\npartly based on Meinong but also with reference to his contemporaries,\nethicists like Max Scheler and Nicolai Hartmann. He offered his views\nin a lecture on “Value Theory and Ethics” in 1924/25 and\nthen again in a reviewed and expanded version in 1926/27. This seems\nto be of central importance for Mally’s work on deontic logic which he\nelaborated at the same time, most probably between 1924 and 1926\n(Mally 1926). It was Melanie Sagheb-Oehlinger who looked through the\nunpublished work of Ernst Mally. She retyped and edited this lecture\nmanuscript—originally typed by Mokre (1927)—as an\nAppendix to her master’s thesis (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008).  It\noffers an extensive outline of Mally’s philosophical approach to value\ntheory and ethics, of course in the broad tradition of Franz Brentano\nand Alexius Meinong. What is described below is mainly based on this\nAppendix. \n\n(3) In the 1930s, Mally further developed his philosophy of reality\n(Mally 1935). Although it seems he had some ethical consequences of\nthis “realistic approach” in mind, he did not elaborate\nthem beyond this book. He even mentioned explicitly in his article on\ntruth (Mally 1940) that he has left aside questions of the\nnormative. \n\nThe lecture notes by Hans Mokre of “Ernst Mally: Value Theory\nand Ethics” contain four chapters (many references below refer to\nthe re-typed version in Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008, Appendix,\nwhich will be cited as SOM): \n\nThis is the central ethical hypothesis of Mally: “Whatever has\n(objective) value ought to be” (SOM: 49). Moral values are not values\nfor somebody, but are values of the act of the human person herself. It\nis difficult to see, he maintains, that the moral value of an act does\nnot collapse with the intended utility value of that act. A moral value\nis logically prior to its utility value, because moral values cannot be\nwillingly or consciously intended. Moral values are not assigned to\nobjects of reality but are inherent to them (SOM: 51). \n\nIn the tradition of Brentano and Meinong, Mally asserts that moral\nvalues can be perceived emotionally. This conception roots even further\nin the classical tradition of the convergence of being and value from\nAristotle to Leibniz (Mokre 1971: 20): esse et verum et bonum\nconvertuntur. Mally refers to the triad of the true, the good and the\nbeautiful two times in his lecture (SOM: 10; also 44 where he mentions\n“primary values” in regard to what is true, good and\nbeautiful for which we humans seem to possess a sort of “natural\nevidence”). But it is questionable to him if a supreme value\nexists at all, like pleasure for Epicurus, lawlike duty for Kant or\nlove for Christians. He rather suggests that the order of moral values\nis infinite—upwards as well as downwards. Since we grasp the\nobjects of reality with our sense perception and then form an\nintellectual judgment, at the same time we experience a particular\nvalue feeling that is our emotional response to the inherent value of\nevery object of reality. For example, when we look at a clock and judge\nthat it is working correctly, then at the same time we experience this\nfact as something positive, pleasant—through our value feeling,\nalthough we don’t perceive anything like “the pleasure of\nthe clock being in time”. Mally even asserts:  If an object is valuable\n(wertvoll)—emotionally felt correctly by one\nperson—then it should be valuable to all people. (SOM:\n46) \n\nMally emphasizes again: “Every value corresponds to an (at\nleast relative) ought” (SOM: 53). The foundation of moral values is\nthe value of life: “All moral life is connected to the animalist\n‘vital sphere’” (SOM: 56). E.g., a small amount of water\nis of particular utility value for the human being to preserve his life\n(15). Particular utility values of this kind are more important than a\ngiven quantity of value institutions like art, legal order, state,\ngovernment or literature. Only through subjective acting on the\nindividual’s part can utility values be created—of course\nwithin the framework of those institutions (SOM: 55). Therefore, Mally\ncontends, there is no such thing as a universal law of morality like\nImmanuel Kant’s Categorical Imperative. The reason for this lies\nin the fact that the individual creates utility values. In the complex\nvariety of life situations, no single rule can cover the total quantity\nof culture, science, religion etc. (SOM: 55). \n\nAs internal utility values, Mally lists the value of life, the value\nof consciousness, of conscious activity, of suffering: “To open\nour eyes for many and even for the highest values, suffering is\nunavoidably necessary” (57); the assertion that the experience of\nsuffering is “unavoidably necessary” for the grasping of\nmoral values has to do with Mally’s own painful and handicapped living\nconditions (see section 1). Furthermore he lists the values of power\nand the value of freedom that is the basic value of all moral acting.\nForeseeing is another precondition because it is necessary for our\nwilling. Finally, we act teleologically (= directed towards a purpose)\nwhich is equally necessary in order to reach a goal. \n\nExternal utility values are natural goods like air, water etc. as\npreconditions for our moral life. The causal order of reality enables\nus to purposeful planning whereas the concrete situation of each act is\nof particular value. Concrete situations make up the whole of moral\nlife. Other external values are power, luck and goods like wealth,\nriches but also social communities like family, society, all of\nhumankind and whatever constitutes them or keeps them together like\nlaw, language, culture, traffic, etc. (SOM: 61) \n\nMoral values are categorized by Mally into basic values and values\nof virtue. The most general moral basic value is “the\ngood”, not meaning “good for something” or\n“good for somebody”. “We signify as good the free\nintention to(wards) objective values” and “evil is the\nintention towards disvalues or the intention against values”\n(SOM: 62). Essential for the moral good is the fact that preferring the\nhigher value is not done through intellectual weighing of alternatives\nbut through our immediate value feeling (SOM: 62). Mally asserts a special\nsense for the varying degree of values\n(“Werthöhensinn”). This special value sense works in a\nperson’s conscience and makes us immediately feel the right and\nthe wrong behavior. In addition he uses a metaphysical hypothesis that\nhelps building a transition from this subjective value feeling to the\nobjective value: \nWhatever is in accordance with the innermost\nessence of reality is objectively valuable and at the same time the\nessence-related most probable. (SOM: 62)  \nThe latter is not\nnecessarily the empirically most probable, i.e., not what probably will\nbe realized in the individual case but what ought to be realized (or\nwhat is worthy to be realized). Objective values are an a priori given\nessence relatedness in our value feeling (SOM: 63). \nThe values\nthemselves are ideal forms (Gebilde) which exist timelessly and\nunchangeably. (SOM: 74) \n Yet the value behavior of humans following\nthem is changing, mainly because it loses the immediate emotional\ncontact (feeling) to the values. Instead of this immediate value\nfeeling and its ensuing insight humans accept the value tradition of\nsociety. Moreover, Mally talks about “value forms”\n(Wertgestalten) which can be seen as ideal types of personality (SOM: 75).\nOne of the many value forms (depending on value perspectives and value\nhierarchies) corresponds to each individual human being: in her\nempirical character we find the ethical norm of her value form. This\nethical norm occurs in that character as essence-directed tendency\ntowards the value form. Mally adds that this assertion corresponds to\nthe above mentioned metaphysical hypothesis “that only the\nobjectively valuable exists in the essence of reality” (SOM: 76). The\nmoral task of each individual consists in the fulfillment of his\npersonal ethical norm. The way to find that norm will be shown to him\nby his conscience. \n\nIn other words: to Mally, the concept of a subjective value\nconstituted by the feeling or willing of the individual is untenable.\nRather, in her feeling and understanding the person corresponds to\nvarious objective values in reality. With her willing, she responds to\nthe ought that is dwelling in the objects of reality. Karl Wolf\nsummarizes Mally’s central point: \nIn her feeling the human\nbeing responds adequately to various value qualities of reality; in her\nwilling she corresponds to the ought that is contained in the\n‘objects’. (Wolf 1971: 12, translation by the\nauthors) \nThe problem of different value experiences by different\npeople is explained by Mally with the hierarchy of ranks of\nperspectives. Each concrete situation conveys an objective value as\nwell as a value perspective of that particular reality to the person\n(see the reflection of this view in Mally’s deontic logic in the\nnext paragraph). Since each situation is different depending on the\ntemperament, the mood, the age, etc. of the beholder, as well as the\nzeitgeist reflected by him, each result of such a personal situation\nexperience is genuine, i.e., indubitable. This is the reason why there\ncannot be a general moral norm to act in certain situations in a\ncertain moral way (SOM: 76). Yet there is a hierarchy of experienced\nperspectives. Some are better because they make more distinctions, some\nare worse because the particular feeling experience is not adequately\ncorresponding to the situation. The main tendency of a person’s\nstriving should be towards the total value of the life of that person\n(SOM: 49). Moral behavior that supports a striving towards this total value\nis better than the pursuit of other strivings that miss this total\nvalue (Wolf 1971: 12–13). \n\nAt this point, a short remark about the consequences of Mally’s value\ntheory in regard to his deontic logic seems to be in order. His\ndeontic axiom III is seen at least as “problematic” by all\nknown critics so far. This axiom states the equivalence of the factual\nwith the obligatory. This has been judged as problematic or even\nabsurd because in modern meta-ethical discourse the is-ought gap is\naccepted as logical basis for all ethical deliberations, and,\nmoreover, the collapse would mean that our actual world is a morally\n“ideal” one. Mally, however, broadens this view. To him,\nthe ought is contained in the objects of reality. With\n‘objects’ he does not refer to sensually perceived\nentities but to the more complex essence of objects (on Meinong’s\nobject-theoretic basis). According to Meinong’s view on dignitatives\n(an expression not used by Mally, who refers to them as\n“Forderungen” in Mally 1926: 12, or Mally 1971:\n243), a value constitutes an object of higher order. This value is\ncomplex and can only emotionally be grasped but it cannot be defined,\nnor even propositionally characterized. E.g., a donation to a\ncharitable fund can be understood or felt as a morally good deed\n(Marek 2008: ch. 6.2).  Although this would not be a sensory\nperception of an object, to Mally it is the emotional impression or\nfeeling that reveals the “essence of the object”\nconsidered. It is interesting to note that Mally must have been aware\nof some of the criticisms of his controversial axiom III (by Laird\n1926 or Menger 1939), but it is not known if he ever defended it or at\nleast tried to clarify his underlying value theoretical viewpoint. \n\nAlthough Mally denies the possibility of a universal moral principle\n(Mally 1935: 75), he emphasizes the important role of our moral\nresponsibility. Our responsibility must be exemplified through moral\ndecisions: “Morality is always the striving after the most\nperfect meaning and its best exemplification” (Mally 1935: 77).\nThere is, however, a formal moral duty, “Follow your\nconscience”, or more precisely, “Act in the way that you\nrecognize as right according to the best of your knowledge and\nconscience” (Mally 1938a: 27). \n\nUltimately, morality is connected with the divine. For the\nreligiously inspired person, morality is a matter of religion, because\nreligion is necessarily linked to morality. For the philosophically\noriented person, morality is the supreme task of her character to\ntranscend her ego. This striving beyond one’s own person is again\na kind of meaning exemplification of the dynamic structure of reality.\nAs a sort of moral behavior, it is always related to fellow humans.\nDoing the right thing is not only a private matter for oneself and\none’s neighbors. No human belongs to himself or to some other\npeople next to him. He belongs to everyone, foremost to the community,\nMally asserts, and to the reality of the world: “The world is\nbeautiful in him, just like a tree blossoms in each of its\nflowers” (Mally 1935: 77). Pursuing this responsibility makes the\nperson a microcosmos, an image of a deity (Gottheit). And: \nthe\nmost original feature of a human being and her deepest personality\nmagically shine through in the case of love, a loved person is always\nexperienced as a miracle. (Mally 1935: 62) \n\nMally’s dynamistic-holistic world-view with its central notion\nof strivings (Strebungen) has further been developed and applied to a\nnumber of moral issues by his student Karl Wolf (1947). In chapter 11\nof Realistic Ethics, Wolf asserts, \nEvery tendency is basically\ngood when it remains within the order of the whole, and every tendency,\neven the most ideal, becomes evil, when it transgresses the\norder. (Wolf 1947: 78) \nThus, a balance is morally required with\na view to the dynamic order of the whole. Compromise as a rule of\nnature justifies the power of the stronger, because the stronger is\nmore capable of guaranteeing a balance in conflicts than the weaker.\nThis idea is also applicable to education: the stronger parent helps\nthe weaker child, thereby creating a balance within the whole of\nstrivings of both people involved. More detailed discussions by Wolf\nare elaborated in the collection of his essays (Rothbucher/Zecha\n2012). \n\nAfter the end of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy 1918, Mally became a\nmember of the Großdeutsche Volkspartei, a German\nnational and mostly anti-semitic party in the Austrian parliament,\nwhich agitated, like Schönerer and his followers, for Austria’s\nannexation to Germany. In February 1938, Mally joined\nthe Volkspolitisches Referat, an organisation with the goal\nto unite all Austrian nationalist movements (including the National\nSocialists). The same year he also entered the NS Lehrerbund\n(National Socialist Teachers’ Association).  Two months after the\nannexation of Austria by Germany in March 1938, Mally became a member\nof the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party), i.e., the Nazi\nparty. Given all this political involvement in Austria’s and later\nGermany’s national movements, the question has been legitimately\nraised whether and how his political attitude influenced his\nphilosophical work. It seems to be appropriate to pursue this question\nand some answers to it in its historical development. \n\nFirst, it is interesting how the Nazis themselves classified Mally’s\nphilosophical work with respect to their ideology.  According to their\njudgment of the political reliability of philosophy professors in\nGermany (then including Austria) by the\nReichssicherheitsdienst of the Reichsführer SS,\nthere were six groups: \n\nMally was ranked in group 2 and thus categorized as\n“liberal”, which here meant “neither national\nsocialist nor system dependent” according to Korotin (2007:\n8). The term ‘liberal’ was used by the Nazis for German\nnationalists who were not considered to be National Socialists. \n\nSecond, after World War II, no one seemed to have serious concerns\nabout Mally’s philosophical work (or even just parts of it) in view of\nhis political attitude. In 1971, a collection of essays (including\nGroßes Logikfragment and Grundgesetze des\nSollens) was edited by Karl Wolf and Paul Weingartner, with\nintroductory comments by the editors as well as by Hans Mokre. It was\nonly in the 1990s when a critical and serious discussion of the\nquestion how Mally’s political views influenced his philosophical work\nbegan. \n\nThird, Sauer 1998 claimed that Mally’s National Socialist views\nclearly shaped his philosophical writings. Sauer provides a number of\nquotes from, and references to, Mally’s writings and private\ncorrespondence, as well as a critical evaluation. He condemns Mally’s\nentire later philosophical work as not being worthy of any further\ninvestigation. Thus Sauer challenged the philosophical community to\nseriously investigate all of Mally’s work, including some of his\nunpublished manuscripts and personal correspondence. Schönafinger 1994\ncomes to similar results, based on previously unpublished work by\nSauer and referencing to personal documents and lecture notes in the\narchives of the Graz University Library. In 2008, Sagheb-Oehlinger\ndevoted her entire master’s thesis to this problem. She analyzed\nthoroughly all “later” philosophical writings of Mally by\nproviding ten categories like racism, anti-semitism, cult of\nthe Führer, anti-democratic, National Socialist education,\netc. In addition she studied Mally’s private correspondence with his\nphilosophical “soulmate” and pen friend, Gertraud Laurin,\nwhich extended over a period of ten years\n(1934–1944). Sagheb-Oehlinger’s final result can be summed up\nthe following way: Mally cannot clearly be seen a “National\nSocialist philosopher”, but there is no doubt about the national\nsocialist ideological content of his Anfangsgründe der\nPhilosophie (1938a) (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008: 143). This is\ndifferent from what Sauer (1998) had concluded. To give just one\nexample, in his description of Anfangsgründe der Philosophie\n(Mally 1938a) Sauer names the two National Socialist main values\nemphasized in Mally’s book, the “basic value of blood” and\nthe “duty to keep the race clean and breed it higher”\n(Sauer 1998: 184). He then continues: \nWith one brief word, the\nphilosophical placet is granted to the whole barbaric madness of the\nracist legislation and racist separation, of the legislation of\nhereditary health and the forced sterilization in huge numbers of\ninsane people (or what was identified as such) and social\nnonconformists. (Sauer 1998: 184) \n Whilst it is correct that Mally (in\nMally 1938a) certainly supported this ideology that led to these\natrocities, Sauer’s general conclusion that all of Mally’s late\nphilosophy stands in one row with the works of all the other Nazi\nphilosophers is questionable. Also his concluding question whether\nthere remains anything of Mally’s philosophy worth to be saved finds\nits positive answer in the preceding sections. For more details see the\nfollowing paragraphs. \n\nFinally, considering these opposing views, we want to give our own\nadditional assessment of Mally’s philosophical writings with respect to\nhis national socialist involvement. Though Mally was an analytic,\nscientifically oriented philosopher who produced original contributions\nin various fields of philosophy, it is a fact that National Socialist\nideas and principles inspired some of his later philosophical works. He\npresents us with a case where, in certain parts of his work, it is not\neasy to separate his private political convictions from the content.\nNevertheless, it is important to stress that many of Mally’s works are\nfree from any untoward political influences, and their philosophical\nvalue should in no way be diminished by his political views. But, of\ncourse, there are works that do contain National Socialist ideology. We\nwill outline the grades of National Socialist involvement in Mally’s\nwork below, but first we present a short sketch of Mally’s central\nNationalist Socialist (NS) theses. \n\nIn NS ideology, the concept of das Volk (the people),\nespecially das deutsche Volk (the German people), plays a\ncentral role. From the early 1930s on, Mally tried to provide a\nphilosophical justification for the value judgments (1) that das\nVolk is more important than its individual members, and (2) that\nthe Germans constitute the dominant people. He further stated an\nanti-reduction thesis, namely, that the concept of das Volk\ncannot be reduced to the concepts of each of its members (the\nindividual persons). He thus wanted to \n“fight against\nsubjectivist, Jewish-positivist and related doctrines … and\nreplace them by something healthier”. (From Mally’s curriculum\nvitæ, dated September 23, 1938, six months after the Anschluss;\nunpublished, University of Graz Library/Nachlass-Sammlung. This is,\nhowever, not a philosophical work but can rather be seen as an\nopportunistic self-description). \nThis fact also explains why Mally saw himself in opposition to the\nVienna Circle and the logical positivists, who he thought of as being\nthe prime exponents of the “individualist\nideology”—an ideology which (according to Mally) tries to\ndeprive the world of its meaning (Sinn).  Mally saw das\nVolk as a “quasi-person”, having a body, a mind, and\na soul; das Volk cannot be completely rationally\ncomprehended, it rather has to be experienced (erlebt). He\nmaintains that the “essential reality” of das\nVolk is revealed through this experience, i.e., its meaning, and\nthus, the meaning of its “dynamic development” is\nrevealed. Furthermore, different Völker (peoples) have\ndifferent properties, depending on their origin, their development,\nculture, etc. These properties allegedly yield a significantly moral\ndifference: the German people are supposed to rank among the peoples\nwith the highest value and have therefore to be kept\n“pure”. External influences have to be eliminated, so that\ndas deutsche Volk can be “bred” to even higher\nstates of development, and thus gradually strive towards a state where\nits meaning can be totally fulfilled (see Mally 1934b, 1935 and\n1938a).  From any reasonable perspective today, all his NS\n“theses” are either barely understandable, or simply\nfalse.  Obviously, his allegations reflect Nazi ideology. In any case,\nmuch of what we find in the writings just described has nothing to do\nwith serious and solid philosophy. If we summarize the NS involvement\nin Mally’s writings between 1904 and 1944, we may distinguish three\ndifferent grades, not in chronological order. Grade 1 is\n“NS-ideology free”. These are purely philosophical\nwritings such as Mally 1904, 1912, 1923, 1926, and 1938b.  In grade 2,\nwe count philosophical writings partially interpretable by, and\napplicable to, Nazi ideology, such as Mally 1935 and 1940.  Finally,\nwe can count as grade 3 the pure Nazi propaganda in articles or\npamphlets such as Mally 1934b and 1938a. For an assessment of Mally’s\nphilosophical involvement in NS-ideology, see also Roschitz 2016b,\nch.7, 143–157. \n\nAs we have shown above, Mally’s logical as well as ontological\nideas, concepts and theories are still being discussed in contemporary\nphilosophical research. His value theory and ethical philosophy,\nhowever, are largely unknown and deserve widespread attention as his\nviews are diametrically opposed to what is generally accepted today.\nMoreover, this short overview should make clear that there are many\nparts in Mally’s writings that deserve serious further philosophical\ninvestigation.","contact.mail":"Alexander.Hieke@sbg.ac.at","contact.domain":"sbg.ac.at"}]
