Although\nsome philosophers have thought that there is no difference between\nknowledge and certainty, it has become increasingly common to\ndistinguish them. On this conception, then, certainty is either\nthe highest form of knowledge or is the only epistemic property\nsuperior to knowledge. One of the primary motivations for\nallowing kinds of knowledge less than certainty is the widespread sense\nthat skeptical arguments are successful in showing that we rarely or\nnever have beliefs that are certain (see Unger 1975 for this kind of\nskeptical argument) but do not succeed in showing that our beliefs are\naltogether without epistemic worth (see, for example, Lehrer 1974,\nWilliams 1999, and Feldman 2003; see Fumerton 1995 for an argument that\nskepticism undermines every epistemic status a belief might have; and\nsee Klein 1981 for the argument that knowledge requires certainty,\nwhich we are capable of having).\n\n\n\nAs with knowledge, it is difficult to provide an uncontentious\nanalysis of certainty. There are several reasons for this.\nOne is that there are different kinds of certainty, which are easy to\nconflate. Another is that the full value of certainty is\nsurprisingly hard to capture. A third reason is that there are\ntwo dimensions to certainty: a belief can be certain at a moment or\nover some greater length of time.\n\n\n\nThere are various kinds of certainty. A belief is\npsychologically certain when the subject who has it is\nsupremely convinced of its truth. Certainty in this sense is\nsimilar to incorrigibility, which is the property a belief has\nof being such that the subject is incapable of giving it up. But\npsychological certainty is not the same thing as incorrigibility.\nA belief can be certain in this sense without being incorrigible; this\nmay happen, for example, when the subject receives a very compelling\nbit of counterevidence to the (previously) certain belief and gives it\nup for that reason. Moreover, a belief can be incorrigible\nwithout being psychologically certain. For example, a mother may\nbe incapable of giving up the belief that her son did not commit a\ngruesome murder, and yet, compatible with that inextinguishable belief,\nshe may be tortured by doubt. \n\nA second kind of certainty is epistemic. Roughly\ncharacterized, a belief is certain in this sense when it has the\nhighest possible epistemic status. Epistemic certainty is often\naccompanied by psychological certainty, but it need not be. It is\npossible that a subject may have a belief that enjoys the highest\npossible epistemic status and yet be unaware that it does. (More\ngenerally, a subject's being certain that p does not\nentail that she is certain that she is certain that p; on this\npoint, see Van Cleve 1979, and see Alston 1980 on level confusions in\nepistemology.) In such a case, the subject may feel less than the\nfull confidence that her epistemic position warrants. I will say\nmore below about the analysis of epistemic certainty and its relation\nto psychological certainty. \n\nSome philosophers also make use of the notion of moral\ncertainty (see Markie 1986). For example, in the Latin version of\nPart IV of the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes says that\n“some things are considered as morally certain, that is, as\nhaving sufficient certainty for application to ordinary life, even\nthough they may be uncertain in relation to the absolute power of\nGod” (PW 1, pp. 289-90). Thus characterized, moral\ncertainty appears to be epistemic in nature, though it is a lesser\nstatus than epistemic certainty. In the French version of this\npassage, however, Descartes says that “moral certainty is\ncertainty which is sufficient to regulate our behaviour, or which\nmeasures up to the certainty we have on matters relating to the conduct\nof life which we never normally doubt, though we know that it is\npossible, absolutely speaking, that they may be false” (PW 1, p.\n289 n. 2). Understood in this way, it does not appear to be a\nspecies of knowledge, given that a belief can be morally certain and\nyet false (contra Markie 1986, p. 36). Rather, on this view, for\na belief to be morally certain is for it to be subjectively rational to\na high degree. \n\nAlthough all three kinds of certainty are philosophically\ninteresting, it is epistemic certainty that has traditionally been of\ncentral importance. In what follows, then, I shall focus mainly\non this kind of certainty. \n\nThere have been many different conceptions of certainty. Each\nof them captures some central part of our intuitive understanding of\ncertainty, but, as we shall see, none of them is free from\nproblems. \n\nCertainty is often explicated in terms of\nindubitability. This has been done in a variety of\nways. One prominent account of certainty is suggested by\nDescartes's presentation of his famous Archimedean point, the\ncogito (I am thinking, therefore I exist). In the Second\nMeditation, Descartes reviews the extensive doubts of the First\nMeditation before saying that even if “there is a deceiver of\nsupreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving\nme,” still “he will never bring it about that I am nothing\nso long as I am something” (PW 2, p. 17). Descartes then\nconcludes that the proposition that he himself exists is true whenever\nhe considers it. It is often thought that the cogito has\na unique epistemic status in virtue of its ability to resist even the\n“hyperbolic” doubts raised in the First Meditation (see\nMarkie 1992 and Broughton 2002). However, even if Descartes took\nthis view of the certainty of the cogito, he did not accept\nthe general claim that certainty is grounded in indubitability.\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes says that he is certain that he is a\nthinking thing, and he explains the certainty of this “first item\nof knowledge” (it is unclear whether he regards it as distinct\nfrom the cogito) as resulting from the fact that it is a clear\nand distinct perception (PW 2, p. 24). (Matters are complicated,\nhowever, by the fact that Descartes also says in the Third Meditation\nthat certainty depends on knowing that God exists and is not a\ndeceiver.) \n\nLudwig Wittgenstein also seems to connect certainty with\nindubitability. He says that “If you tried to doubt\neverything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The\ngame of doubting itself presupposes certainty” (1969,\n§115). What makes possible doubting is “the fact that\nsome propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on\nwhich those turn” (1969, §341). Although\nWittgenstein's view is sometimes taken to be—or to provide\nthe basis for—an epistemically satisfying response to skepticism\n(see, e.g., Wright 2003 and 2004), it is hard to see the kind of\ncertainty he has characterized as being epistemic, rather than merely\npsychological, in nature (on this point, see Pritchard 2005).\nThus, when Wittgenstein says, “The difficulty is to realize the\ngroundlessness of our believing” (1969, §166) it seems clear\nthat the so-called hinge propositions are ones that we are\npsychologically incapable of calling into question. This is, of\ncourse, compatible with their being false. \n\nIn general, every indubitability account of certainty will face a\nsimilar problem. The problem may be posed as a dilemma: when the\nsubject finds herself incapable of doubting one of her beliefs, either\nshe has good reasons for being incapable of doubting it, or she does\nnot. If she does not have good reasons for being unable to doubt\nthe belief, the type of certainty in question can be only\npsychological, not epistemic, in nature. On the other hand, if\nthe subject does have good reasons for being unable to doubt the\nbelief, the belief may be epistemically certain. But, in this\ncase, what grounds the certainty of the belief will be the\nsubject's reasons for holding it, and not the fact that the\nbelief is indubitable. \n\nA second problem for indubitability accounts of certainty is that,\nin one sense, even beliefs that are epistemically certain can be\nreasonably doubted. I shall say more about this in §3\nbelow. \n\nAccording to a second conception, a subject's belief is\ncertain just in case it could not have been\nmistaken—i.e., false (see, e.g., Lewis 1929).\nAlternatively, the subject's belief is certain when it is\nguaranteed to be true. This is what Roderick Firth calls\nthe “truth-evaluating” sense of certainty (1967, pp.\n7-8). As with knowing that p, being certain that\np entails that it is true that p. Certainty is,\nhowever, significantly stronger than lesser forms of knowledge.\nIn cases where the subject knows without being certain that p,\nit is actually true that p, though it could have been\nfalse. But, where the subject is certain that p, it does\nnot merely turn out to be true that p—in some sense it\ncould not have been otherwise. \n\nThe difficulty for this conception of certainty is specifying the\nprecise sense in which the belief could not have been false. What\nis meant cannot be what is called metaphysical or broadly logical\nimpossibility. Although some of the paradigmatically certain\nbeliefs are necessarily true in this sense, many others are not.\nFor example, though I am certain of the truth of the cogito,\nit is not necessarily true (in the metaphysical sense) that I\nexist. That is, it is possible that I might not have\nexisted. We might attempt to solve this difficulty by saying that\nthe belief is guaranteed to be true by the subject's grounds for\nit (see, e.g., Audi 1998, pp. 218-9). But this opens up two\nfurther problems for this conception of certainty. First, if the\ntruth of the belief is guaranteed by the subject's grounds for\nholding it, then it looks as though the certainty of the belief ought\nto be attributed to those grounds as well. That is to say, the\nbelief would be certain, not in virtue of the fact that it is\nguaranteed to be true, but rather in virtue of its relation to the\ngrounds that make that guarantee possible. This would be so\nbecause the grounds would provide a deeper explanation for the\ncertainty of the belief than would the fact that the belief is\nguaranteed to be true. \n\nThe second problem is very similar to one that arises for\nphilosophers attempting to provide an account of fallibilistic\nknowledge (i.e., knowledge that is less than certain). According\nto the standard account, the subject has fallibilistic knowledge that\np when she knows that p on the basis of some\njustification j, and yet the subject's belief could have\nbeen false while still held on the basis of j (see, e.g.,\nBonJour 1985, p. 26, and Lehrer 1990, p. 45). Alternatively, the\nsubject knows that p on the basis of some justification\nj, but j does not entail the truth that p\n(see, e.g., Cohen 1988, p. 91; Fogelin 1994, pp. 88-9; and Jeshion\n2000, pp. 334-5). The problem with the standard account, in\neither version, is that it does not allow for fallibilistic knowledge\nof necessary truths. If it is necessarily true that p,\nthen the subject's belief that p could not have been\nfalse, regardless of what her justification for it may be like.\nAnd, if it is necessarily true that p, then\neverything—including the subject's justification for her\nbelief—will entail or guarantee that p. Our\nattempt to account for certainty encounters the opposite problem: it\ndoes not allow for a subject to have a belief regarding a necessary\ntruth that does not count as certain. If the belief is\nnecessarily true, it cannot be false—even when the subject has\ncome to hold the belief for a very bad reason (say, as the result of\nguessing or wishful thinking). And, given that the beliefs are\nnecessarily true, even these bad grounds for holding the belief will\nentail or guarantee that it is true. \n\nThe best way to solve the problem for the analysis of fallibilistic\nknowledge is to focus, not on the entailment relation, but rather on\nthe probabilistic relation holding between the subject's\njustification and the proposition believed (see Reed 2002). When\nthe subject knows that p on the basis of justification\nj, and P(p/j) is less than 1, the\nsubject's knowledge is fallibilistic. (Although\nepistemologists will disagree about what the appropriate conception of\nprobability is, here is a crude example of how probability may figure\nin a fallibilistic epistemology. A basic historical reliabilist\nwill say that a belief is justified just in case it has been produced\nby a process that has yielded a preponderance of true beliefs.\nSo, if the process has yielded a true belief, say, 90% of the time, the\nprobability that the next belief will be true is 90%; this is so even\nif the belief in question is necessarily true and has been logically\ndeduced from a set of beliefs, each of which is necessarily\ntrue.) Adapting this solution to the problem for certainty, we\ncan say that the subject is certain that p when\nP(p/j) = 1, where j is the\njustification or grounds for the belief (see Van Cleve 1977 and Lewis\n1952). However, in order for j to impart a probability\nof 1 to p, it must also be the case that\nP(j) = 1. That is to say, j must be\ncertain for the subject before it can make anything else certain.\nBut, if we are to explain the certainty that p by appeal to\nthe certainty that j, we fall into a vicious regress.\nThe only way to stop it is to allow that some beliefs may have an\nintrinsic probability of 1 (see Russell 1948, p. 396, and Van Cleve\n1977). It is, however, difficult to see how intrinsic probability\nof this sort is possible (barring, of course, a subjectivist account of\nprobability, which could, in any case, capture only psychological\ncertainty). \n\nAccording to a third conception of certainty, a subject's\nbelief that p is certain when it is justified in the highest\ndegree. This is what Firth calls the\n“warrant-evaluating” sense of certainty (1967, pp.\n8-12). Thus, Bertrand Russell says that “A proposition is\ncertain when it has the highest degree of credibility, either\nintrinsically or as a result of argument” (1948, p. 396).\nThere are various ways to understand what it means for a belief to be\ncredible or justified in the highest degree. It could mean simply\nthat the belief in question is justified as highly as any belief the\nsubject happens to hold. But, in cases where the subject does not\nhave any beliefs that are highly justified, this will imply that even a\nbelief with relatively low justification is epistemically\ncertain. Perhaps we could say instead that a belief is justified\nto the highest degree when it is justified as highly as any belief that\nanyone happens to hold. But this, too, leaves open the\npossibility that a belief with relatively low justification is\nepistemically certain: if all the subjects in existence are in a\ncondition of universal ignorance, all of their beliefs—including\nthe best of them—will have only a low level of\njustification. Perhaps, then, we should say that a belief is\njustified in the highest degree when it has the highest level of\njustification possible. But even this account is\nunsatisfactory. Suppose that global skepticism is necessarily\ntrue: it is a necessary truth that no subject is capable of having much\njustification for any of her beliefs; although it may seem to us as\nthough a significant degree of justification is possible, this in fact\nis incorrect. It would then be intuitively correct to say that\nevery belief falls far short of certainty, though this would not be\npermitted by the account of certainty under consideration. We may\nof course doubt that skepticism of this strong variety is correct;\nnevertheless, it should not be simply ruled out as a matter of\ndefinition. \n\nRoderick Chisholm offers a variation on the above approach.\nAccording to his first definition of certainty (where h,\nS, and t are variables for propositions, subjects,\nand times, respectively): \n\nClause (i) ensures that the subject has some measure of positive\njustification for h—if she had no justification for it,\nit would be more reasonable for her to withhold with respect to\nh. Clause (ii) then says that those beliefs of the\nsubject are certain which are at the highest levels of justification\nfor her. However, this still leaves open the following\npossibility: h is the most highly justified belief the subject\nhas, but it is still not very highly justified (e.g., it may not even\nbe sufficiently justified to count as knowledge). \n\nPerhaps for this reason, Chisholm later offered a different\ndefinition of certainty: \n\nThis definition still has the equivalent of clause (ii) above, and\ntherefore requires the belief that is certain for the subject be the\none that is most highly justified for her. But the second\ndefinition appears to be more successful in requiring that p\nbe justified to a significant degree. Now, believing that\np must not only be more justified for the subject than\nwithholding p, it must also be more justified than withholding\nwith respect to any other proposition. There are many\npropositions that we are capable of entertaining—e.g., the\nproposition that the number of people alive at this precise moment is\neven—where there is not the slightest reason for thinking them to\nbe either true or false (though, of course, they must be one or the\nother). In fact, given the perfect lack of evidence with respect\nto propositions of this sort, Chisholm's definition may set the\nstandard for certainty too high, for it is hard to see how\nthere could be any proposition one is more justified in\nbelieving than one is in withholding belief regarding, say, the parity\nof the number of people alive at this very moment. \n\nIt should be noted, however, that Chisholm's definition works\nonly by implicitly relying on what is a contingent feature of our\nepistemic situation. It so happens that we find ourselves in a\nposition of total ignorance with respect to some propositions.\nBut that need not have been the case. We could have ended up in a\nworld where there is a moderate amount of evidence either for or\nagainst every proposition. If one of a subject's beliefs\nthen happened to have slightly more justification than any of the\nothers, it would meet Chisholm's definition of certainty, though\nit might still have what we would intuitively take to be a less than\nideal level of justification. \n\nThere is one further problem with both of Chisholm's\ndefinitions. Because they both relativize certainty to a\nparticular subject, they make possible the following situation.\nTwo subjects each believe that p, and in each case the\nbelief is justified to degree n. For the first subject,\nthe belief counts as certain because none of her other beliefs have a\nhigher level of justification. But, for the second subject, the\nbelief in question is not certain because she does have another belief\nthat is slightly more justified. If certainty really is grounded\nin epistemic justification, though, this should not be possible.\nIf a given justification makes a belief certain for one subject, it\nshould do so for everyone. \n\nThere is another approach that Chisholm might take. According\nto particularism, his favored method in epistemology, we\nshould use particular instances of knowledge and justification as our\nguide in formulating an epistemology (Chisholm 1973 and 1989, pp.\n6-7). (By contrast, methodism begins with criteria for\nknowledge and justification and then attempts to ascertain whether, on\nthese criteria, we actually have any knowledge or justified\nbeliefs.) Adapting this approach to our present concern, the\nsuggestion is that we formulate an account of certainty in light of\nparadigmatic instances of beliefs held with certainty. Thus,\nafter giving the second definition above, Chisholm says that the\nconcept of certainty is illustrated by propositions about what he calls\n“self-presenting” mental states and by some logical and\nmetaphysical axioms (1989, p. 12). \n\nAlthough this particularist approach probably is the way in which\nmost philosophers think of certainty, it faces several\ndifficulties. One is that the epistemology of the a\npriori is far from clear. Given that we do not, apparently,\ncausally interact with necessary truths, it is hard to see how our\nminds can have access to them. A second difficulty has to do with\nknowledge of our own mental states—sometimes referred to as\nknowledge by acquaintance. According to the\n“speckled hen” problem, there are aspects of our mental\nstates, such as the rich detail of one's present visual\nexperience, that we are not capable of knowing—e.g., if one is\nlooking at a speckled hen, there will be a determinate number of\nspeckles in one's visual experience, which one will not be able\nto know just in virtue of having the experience (Ayer 1940, Chisholm\n1989, Fumerton 2005). But those aspects we cannot know merely by\nbeing conscious of them are part of our conscious experience in just\nthe same way as those aspects we are supposed to be able to\nknow; the difficulty is specifying a principled difference between the\ntwo. Much more could be said about the first two problems, but\nthey lie beyond the scope of this article. A third difficulty is\nthat, at least prima facie, knowledge of one's mental\nstates seems to be of a fairly different kind from knowledge of\nnecessary truths. It is not clear, at the outset, that we are\nwarranted in taking them to be paradigmatic instances of a genuine\nepistemological kind. \n\nAccording to a fourth conception of certainty, defended by Peter\nKlein, a belief “is absolutely certain just in case it is\nsubjectively and objectively immune to doubt”\n(1992, p. 63). He explicates this in the following way: \n\nKlein says that the second condition is what makes the belief\nsubjectively immune to doubt, presumably because it is the beliefs and\nexperiences that constitute S's subjective perspective\nthat render her warranted in denying all propositions that would reduce\nthe warrant for p. However, S's belief\nsystem might contain false beliefs that could warrant her in denying\nevery g relevant to p—even, in some cases,\nwhere the g in question is itself true—and so her belief\nthat p might meet condition (2) and yet still be false.\nCondition (3) is meant to prevent this situation; if p is\nfalse, the true belief that ~p can be added to\nS's belief system, thereby reducing the warrant\nS has for p. In requiring both (2) and (3),\nthen, the account focuses on beliefs where the subject's\nsubjective situation is in a sense properly aligned with an objective\nstructure of reasons (for a similar view, see Pollock 1986). \n\nThere are two major difficulties facing a view of this sort.\nFirst, it is not clear how one belief is supposed to reduce the warrant\nfor another. Suppose that I correctly believe that I have a\nheadache and that my belief is, in an intuitive sense, absolutely\ncertain. The first condition of Klein's account is\nsatisfied: the belief is warranted in virtue of my experiencing the\nheadache. But is the second condition also satisfied? That\nis, would I be warranted in denying, say, the proposition that I do not\nin fact have a headache? If this were to be a belief added to my\nbelief system, I would of course have contradictory beliefs.\nWould that entail that the warrant for both beliefs should be\ndiminished? If the answer is yes, then my belief that I have a\nheadache is not absolutely certain. Moreover, it is hard to see\nhow any belief could then be absolutely certain, given that we\ncan always add to our belief systems the contradictory of any of our\nbeliefs. If the answer is no, however, there should be some\nexplanation for why the proposition that I do not have a headache can\nbe denied. Presumably, the explanation would have something to do\nwith my experiencing the headache. But then what explains the\ncertainty of the belief is the fact that it is grounded in the\nexperience; the belief's being subjectively immune to doubt is\nmerely a consequence of its certainty, and not the explanation for\nit. This would mean that the focus of the view has shifted from\nsubjective immunity to doubt to some sort of special warrant. How\nthere could be such a special warrant, though, would need an\naccount. To see the point more clearly, notice that subjective\nimmunity to doubt will be possible only in cases where the\nsubject's belief is (intuitively) absolutely certain. For\nany belief b that is less than certain, the following belief\ncould be added to the subject's belief system: the warrant for\nb could be misleading. That belief would reduce the\nsubject's warrant for b (even if only slightly) were it\nto be added to her belief system, but it is not a proposition the\nsubject can deny without being absolutely certain that b is\ntrue. The upshot, then, is that subjective immunity to doubt is\nnot well-suited to playing a role in an account of certainty.\nInstead, it looks as though our understanding of subjective immunity to\ndoubt depends on a prior grasp of what certainty is. \n\nThe second difficulty has to do with condition (3), which is\nsupposed to secure objective immunity to doubt. Although it is\nundeniable that a subject for whom condition (3) is satisfied would be\nin a desirable situation, it does not seem to be attributable to her in\nthe right sort of way—and, especially, not in the way that we\nexpect certainty to be attributable to the person who is certain.\nTo see this, suppose that my warrant for the belief that p is\nonly moderately good. Nevertheless, my guardian angel protects my\nbelief by making sure that any proposition such that, if it were true,\nwould (when added to my belief system) reduce my warrant for\np, is false. That is, my guardian angel makes sure that\nall potential defeaters for my belief are removed. Suppose, for\nexample, that I see from a great distance what looks like a hawk.\nMy guardian angel immediately annihilates all non-hawk flying objects\nin the area; the potential defeater, that there are flying objects\nindistinguishable from a hawk in the vicinity, has thus been rendered\nfalse. Although this would make my belief that p\nobjectively immune to doubt, insofar as (3) is satisfied, it does not\nseem as though it would carry my belief any closer to certainty.\nThe fact that the warrant for my belief is only moderately good renders\nirrelevant the work my guardian angel does in the world outside of my\nbeliefs. (Nor would the situation be helped if we stipulated that\ncondition (2) is also satisfied. Given that my belief system\ncould contain many false beliefs that might warrant me in rejecting all\npotential defeaters, my belief might be both subjectively and\nobjectively immune to doubt—and yet still have a relatively low\ndegree of warrant.) \n\nIt may be that one of the four conceptions of certainty discussed\nabove could be improved so as to answer all objections. But,\nuntil that happens, it is safe to say that there is at present no\ncompletely satisfactory conception of certainty. \n\nTypically, epistemologists are concerned with the conditions under\nwhich a subject may know or be certain that p at a particular\nmoment. Interestingly, however, somewhat different issues arise\nfor certainty over time. As this was a primary concern for\nDescartes, who tells us in the First Meditation that he wants to\nestablish something “in the sciences that was stable and likely\nto last,” we can best see how those issues arise in the context\nof Descartes's epistemology (PW 2, p. 12). \n\nIn the Second Set of Objections, Mersenne poses the following\nproblem: although Descartes has argued that our ability to know\nanything depends on our first knowing that God exists and is not a\ndeceiver, it seems clear that an atheist mathematician can have the\nsame sort of mathematical knowledge as a theist. In response,\nDescartes allows that the atheist does have a clear awareness\n(cognitio) of simple mathematical truths, but he denies that\nthis clear awareness is “true knowledge\n[scientia]” (PW 2, p. 101). At first glance, it\nseems that Descartes draws the distinction between cognitio\nand scientia precisely so he can deny certainty to the atheist\nmathematician. But there is good reason to think that this is not\nwhat he has in mind. \n\nTo see this, notice that, if Descartes does not allow the atheist to\nbe able to acquire knowledge through clear and distinct perception, he\nwill fall into the so-called Cartesian Circle. This problem,\nfirst identified by Arnauld in the Fourth Set of Objections, arises if\nDescartes holds both of the following claims: (i) I can know that my\nclear and distinct perceptions are true only if I first know that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, and (ii) I can know that a non-deceiving God\nexists only if I first know that my clear and distinct perceptions are\ntrue. Because knowing one thing is a precondition for knowing the\nother, and vice versa, I cannot know either of them. In\nfact, however, it does not look as though Descartes does fall into the\ncircle. Although it is pretty clear that he is committed to\n(1)—in the Third Meditation, he says that, “if I do not\nknow [whether there is a non-deceiving God], it seems that I can never\nbe quite certain about anything else” (PW 2, p. 25)—there\nis no reason to take him to be committed to (ii). Descartes is\nwilling to permit the meditator to use clear and distinct perceptions\nbefore knowing that they are generally true. The clearest\nexample, of course, is the cogito; the meditator first comes\nto know that he exists as a thinking thing and only later comes to know\nthat his knowledge of the cogito is grounded in its clarity\nand distinctness. The same, then, can be said for the\nmeditator's knowledge—grounded in some clearly and\ndistinctly perceived causal principles—that God exists. In\nusing those principles, the meditator does not first need to have the\ngeneral knowledge that clear and distinct perceptions are true (see Van\nCleve 1979). \n\nStill, some philosophers might object that the meditator has no\nbusiness using principles that he does not know to be true.  Descartes\nwould not be sympathetic to this objection. As he says in his\nconversation with Burman, so long as the meditator is using the causal\nprinciples, “he is actually paying attention to them. And for as\nlong as he does pay attention to them, he is certain that he is not\nbeing deceived, and he is compelled to give his assent to them”\n(PW 3, p. 334; see also PW 2, pp. 25, 48; see also Cottingham 1986,\np. 67). So, the doubt that Descartes raises with respect to clear and\ndistinct perceptions does not extend to the moments at which one is\nactually enjoying them. Rather, it is a doubt that, in\ngeneral, clear and distinct perception may not be a reliable\nsource of beliefs (Kenny 1968, p. 194). When Descartes introduces the\nevil demon hypothesis in the First Meditation, it is meant to\nencapsulate his ignorance of his own origin—and, in particular,\nignorance of the construction of his own mind.  Without knowing that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, it is possible for the meditator that his\nmind works in such a way that it falls into error even when it is\ncontemplating the simplest questions. This doubt is chased away when\nhe actually does contemplate such a question, but it can\neasily return at a later time when his thoughts are turned\nelsewhere. This is the sense in which the atheist mathematician's\ncognitio, or clear awareness, is imperfect. Although it is\ncertain at the time the atheist has the perception, it can always be\nrendered doubtful at another time.  The theist has no\nadvantage over the atheist at the time each enjoys a clear and\ndistinct perception. Rather, the theist's advantage lies in the fact\nthat, armed with the certainty that a non-deceiving God exists, she\nwill always remain free from doubt (Descartes PW 2, p. 48;\nsee also Kenny 1968, p.  193). Consequently, she will be able to\nconstruct her scientific theories without ever falling prey to worries\nabout whether her work has value, and—perhaps even more\nimportantly—she will be in a position to definitively put an end\nto theoretical disagreements with others. (The Stoics make a similar\ndistinction; see Cicero On Academic Scepticism, p. 84.) \n\nGiven this account of Descartes's epistemology, we can now see\nthat both cognitio and scientia are varieties of, not\nonly knowledge, but certainty as well. This is an important point\nto note, for it means that certainty cannot be straightforwardly\ncharacterized in terms of indubitability. For a belief known with\ncertainty to be immune to doubt—not merely at a moment but\nabsolutely—it must be embedded in a coherent system of beliefs,\nall of which are known with certainty (for a similar account of\nDescartes's epistemology, see Sosa 1997, though Sosa takes\ncognitio to be a lower grade of knowledge than\nscientia; also, see Loeb 1992 on the importance of stability\nfor Descartes's epistemology). Scientia, or\nsystematic certainty, represents an admirable, but probably\nunattainable, goal. If humans are capable of certainty at all, it\nis surely of the sort that is capable of mixing with doubts.","contact.mail":"b-reed@northwestern.edu","contact.domain":"northwestern.edu"}]
