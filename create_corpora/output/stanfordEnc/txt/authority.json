This is one of the\nfundamental questions of political philosophy.  Depending on how one\nunderstands political authority this question may be the same as, when\nis coercion by the state legitimate?  Or, when do we have duties to\nobey the state?  Or, when and who has a right to rule through the\nstate? \n\nThis entry is concerned with the philosophical issues that arise in\nthe justification of political authority.  First, this entry will\nexamine some of the main conceptual issues that arise relating to\npolitical authority.  What do we mean by political authority?  This\nentry distinguishes political authority from political power, and the\nidea of morally legitimate political authority from descriptive ideas\nof authority.  It also distinguishes between authority in the sense of\nmorally justified coercion and authority in the sense of capacity to\nimpose duties on others and finally from authority as right to rule.\nFurther distinctions concern the nature of the duties that political\nauthority imposes on subjects. \n\nThe main part of the entry (section\n 4) \n concerns the nature and merits of different accounts of the\nlegitimacy of political authority.  Under what conditions is political\nauthority legitimate?  This entry discusses five different views of\nthe legitimacy of political authority.  It discusses the\ninstrumentalist theory according to which authority is legitimate to\nthe extent that it gets people to do what they already have a duty to\ndo.  It discusses the consent theory of authority according to which\nauthority is legitimate only if the subjects have consented to it.  It\ndiscusses the theory advanced by John Rawls that authority is\nlegitimate if and only if it acts in accord with principles the\nsubjects agree to.  It discusses Ronald Dworkin's view according to\nwhich legitimate political authority is akin to the basis of\nobligations to friendships, families and other associations.  Finally\nit discusses the democratic conception of authority according to which\nthe democratic assembly has legitimate political authority within\ncertains limits because it treats every citizen as an equal in the\nprocess of making law.\n\n\n\nLet us start with the distinctions between political authority as a\nnormative notion (or morally legitimate authority) and political\nauthority as a non-normative notion (or de facto authority)\nand between political authority in either of these senses and political\npower. To say that a state has authority in the normative sense is to\nsay something normative about the relationship between the state and\nits subjects. This is the relationship that we will concentrate on in\nwhat follows. \n\nFor most contemporary theorists to say that the state has authority in\nthe descriptive sense is to say that the state maintains public order\nand that it issues commands and makes rules that are generally obeyed\nby subjects because many of them (or some important subset of them\nsuch as the officials of the state) think of it as having authority in\nthe normative sense (Hart 1961) (Some thinkers have understood the\nidea of legitimate authority in this descriptive sense as well (Weber\n1970); in what follows, we will use the term “legitimate\nauthority” in a normative sense only.) We should note here that\nthe attitudinal component of de facto authority is not\naccepted by everyone. For both Thomas Hobbes and John Austin,\npolitical authority in the de facto sense simply amounts to\nthe capacity of a person or group of persons to maintain public order\nand secure the obedience of most people by issuing commands backed by\nsanctions.  Subjects need not think of the authority as a legitimate\nauthority, on this account. \n\nAlso, the distinction between de facto and morally\nlegitimate authority is not universally accepted or at least it is not\naccepted that the distinction makes a difference. Hobbes insists that\nany entity capable of performing the function of de facto\nauthority is necessarily justified and deserves the obedience of the\nde facto subjects (Hobbes 1668). But most have argued that\nthere is an important distinction between de facto authority\nand legitimate authority. We will explore in what follows the\nconceptions political and legal philosophers have had of legitimate\npolitical authority. \n\nDe facto authority, on anyone's account, is distinct from\npolitical power. The latter is concerned with the state's or any\nagent's ability to get others to act in ways that they desire even when\nthe subject does not want to do what the agent wants him to do.\nPolitical power does not require any kind of pro attitude toward the\nagent on the part of the subject, nor does it require that the state is\nactually successful at securing public order. It operates completely in\nthe realm of threats and offers. No doubt for the state to have de\nfacto authority or legitimate authority requires that the state\nhave the power to compel those subjects who do not wish to go along.\nThis is necessary for the state's ability to maintain public order and\nto assure those who do see it as an authority that it will be able to\ndo what it is supposed to do. \n\nThe rubric under which the normative notion of political authority\nis normally known is the idea of legitimate political authority. In\nthis section, we will review a number of different ideas that have been\nunderstood to come under this idea of legitimate political\nauthority. \n\nIt is important here to note the distinction between theoretical and\npractical authority. A theoretical authority in some area of\nintellectual inquiry is one that is an expert in that area. Theoretical\nauthorities operate primarily by giving advice to the layman, which\nadvice the layman is free to take or not. The judgments of theoretical\nauthorities give people reasons for belief while the judgments of\npolitical authorities are normally thought to give people reasons for\naction. Theoretical authorities do not normally impose duties on\nothers, although they might give advice on what a person's duty is. \n\nMost theorists of political authority view it as a species of\npractical authority rather than theoretical authority, though this\nview is not held by all . Those who hold that political authority is a\nspecies of practical authority maintain that political authorities\nissue directives that give people reasons for action and not reason\nfor belief. The thought is that political authorities impose duties on\ntheir subjects and thereby give them reasons for action. These\ntheorists argue that it is the function of political authorities to\nget people to act in certain ways so as to solve various collective\naction problems such as a variety of different types of coordination\nproblems, assurance problems and free rider problems. There have been\nsome dissenting views on this of late. Some have argued that the\naccount of practical reason required by the idea that political\nauthority is a practical authority is incoherent and so they have\nopted for the idea that political authorities, when legitimate, are\ntheoretical authorities regarding the existence and nature of the\nduties and reasons for action that people have (Hurd 2001). Since this\nview is unusual this entry will concentrate on conceptions of\npolitical authority that treat it as a species of practical\nauthority. \n\nThe rest of this section will discuss a number of different analyses\nof political authority. There are three basic types of conceptual\naccount of legitimate political authority: legitimate political\nauthority as justified coercion, legitimate political authority as the\ncapacity to impose duties, and legitimate political authority as the\nright to rule. First, many people have understood legitimate political\nauthority as a political authority that is justified in coercing the\nsubjects of its authority. The notion of justification here is a moral\none. The thought is that a political authority might have moral\njustification in coercing those who come under its authority. This is\na particularly thin conception of legitimate authority. For instance,\na state can have this kind of authority when it legitimately occupies\na territory as a result of a just war. It is morally justified in\ncoercing the inhabitants of the occupied territory. \n\nThe moral justification of a group of people in coercing others may\nbe more or less systematic. For instance, a group of people may be\nmorally justified in engaging in just a few actions of coercing others.\nOr a group may be morally justified in engaging in coercion more\ngenerally as in the case of a morally justified military\noccupation. \n\nThis notion of authority need not involve duties on the part of the\npopulation that is being coerced. Indeed, they may be justified in\ntrying to escape coercion. This could be the case in a military\noccupation of a country that is justified on the grounds that it is\nnecessary to stop a third country from engaging in morally indefensible\naggression. This conception of morally justified coercion therefore\ninvolves no conception of a moral community among persons. In this\nfirst conception of authority as justified coercion, the authority may\nnot even issue commands let alone make laws. It may simply justifiably\nissue threats and offers. The difference between legitimate and\nillegitimate political authority on this account is that the actions of\nthe illegitimate political authority are not morally justified while\nthe coercive actions of the legitimate authority are justified. \n\nA second conceptual account of legitimate political authority\nimplies that those over whom authority is exercised have some kind of\nduty with regard to the authority. Or the authority has the moral power to\nimpose duties on the subjects. This duty can be merely a duty not to\ninterfere with the activities of the political authority. Or it can\ninvolve the more significant duty to obey the authority. This\nconception of authority involves the authority and the subjects in a\nweak kind of moral relationship. The authority is justified in issuing\nthe commands and attempting to force people to comply with the commands\nwhile the subjects have some kind of duty not to interfere with these\nactivities or comply with the commands. \n\nThe duty of the subjects need not be owed to the authority. It may\nmerely be that the subjects have a duty to obey where that duty is not\nowed to anyone in particular or where that duty is owed ultimately to\npeople who are not the authority. For instance, if one thinks that one\nis likely better to respect others' rights by complying with the\nauthority's directives, the action is ultimately owed to those\nothers. \n\nSome have stressed the idea that the holding of justified political\nauthority may only involve a duty on the part of others not to\ninterfere with the political authority and they argue that the duty of\nnon-interference is much weaker than a duty to obey (Morris 1998). It\nis not clear how great the difference between these two duties is in\npractice at least as far as citizens are concerned. For many cases of\nfailing to obey an authority are cases of interference with the\nauthority. An analogy may be helpful here. If one is playing a game of\nbaseball with an umpire and one refuses to comply with the directives\nof the umpire, one is in effect interfering with the umpire's carrying\nout of his duties by not complying with the directives of the\numpire. \n\nWhile a duty to obey seems to imply a duty not to interfere, there\nare cases of duties of non-interference that are not duties to obey,\nsuch as the duties of foreign powers not to interfere in the activities\nof a legitimate state. Furthermore, the duty to obey is clearly the\nmore contentious issue in the question of authority since it requires\nthat one make one's actions conform to the specific directives of the\nauthority. \n\nA third conceptual account of authority or set of conceptions of\nlegitimate authority involves the idea that the authority has a right\nto rule. Strictly speaking, an authority can have a right to rule\nwithout the subjects having a duty to comply. The authority may have a\n“justification” right to rule (Ladenson 1980). This means\nthat the authority has a permission to issue commands and make rules\nand coerce others to comply and its possession of this right is\njustified on moral grounds. This “justification right” is\nnot much more than the first notion we discussed above. \n\nA more robust right to rule includes a duty owed to the authority on\nthe part of the subjects not to interfere with the activities of the\nauthority. The subjects owe it to the authority not to interfere with\nit. This is connected with the right of the authority to rule. Finally,\nan authority can have a right to rule in the sense that it may issue\ncommands and make rules and require subjects to comply with these rules\nand commands and the subjects have duties, which they owe to the\nauthority, to comply with the rules and commands. \n\nThe distinction between a right to rule that is correlated with a\nduty not to interfere and one that is correlated with a duty to comply\ncomes in handy when we consider the difference between the duties owed\nto a legitimate political authority by the subjects of that authority\nand the duties owed to it by other states and persons who are not\nsubject to that authority. A state with a right to rule in the\nstrongest sense may be owed obedience by its subjects but it is usually\nowed only a duty of non-interference by those who are not a part of the\nstate such as other states and persons in other states. It is\nworthwhile drawing a distinction here between internal legitimacy and\nexternal legitimacy (Buchanan 2004). \n\nIt is not a useful aim of philosophers or political thinkers to\ndetermine which one of these conceptual accounts of political\nauthority is the right one. Each one of them grasps a kind of\nlegitimacy of political authority that is worth taking into account\nand distinguishing from the others. The idea of legitimate authority\nas justified coercive power is a suitable way of getting at the\nauthority of hostile but justified occupation powers. And the idea of\nlegitimate authority as an authority that has a right to rule over\nsubjects who owe obedience to the authority and that has a right not\nto be interfered with by foreigners is surely an importantly distinct\nand perhaps ideal type of authority, which is rarely implemented. The\nkind of legitimacy that is merely correlated with duties to obey or\nnot to interfere is a useful intermediate category between those\ntwo. \n\nWhat is worth noting is that the idea of legitimate authority as a\nright to rule in the strong sense described above does describe a kind\nof ideal of political community. The idea of legitimate authority as a\nright to rule to which citizens owe obedience gives each citizen a\nmoral duty to obey, which it owes to the authority. So this form of\nlegitimacy is grounded in a moral relationship between the parties that\ngoes beyond the fact that they are fellow human beings. The\nestablishment of a robust right to rule depends on the fact that each\ncitizen rightly takes as a reason for obedience that it has a moral\nduty owed to the authority. Since a legitimate political authority with\na right to rule is predicated on the fact that citizens have moral\nreasons grounded in the right to rule to obey it, the right to rule\nengages citizens at a deep moral level. The exercise of political power\nis founded in a moral relationship between moral persons that\nrecognizes and affirms the moral personality of each citizen. \n\nBy contrast, a society in which it is merely the case that\ncoercion is justified is one in which the subjects are permissibly\ntreated as means to morally defensible purposes. The subjects do not\nowe anything to the authority or have any duties to obey it. So, in the\ncase of an authority as merely justified coercion, the subjects'\nreasons for obedience are merely their desires to avoid punishment. And\nthat is the level at which the authority deals with them. Such a\nsociety does not engage the subjects as moral persons, it merely\nattempts to administer the activities of persons so as to bring about\nin a morally justified way a desirable outcome. At the extreme, a\nprisoner of war camp or even a hostile but justified military\noccupation gives the authorities justification for coercion. The people\nwho are subjected to that treatment often have no duties to obey and\nthey do not regard each other or the authorities as members of a\nunified political community. They are merely fellow human beings. To\nthe extent that a political society is best when it involves the mutual\nrecognition and affirmation of the moral status of each person, the\nkind of society that involves merely justified coercion of some by\nothers is a pale shadow. \n\nAnd the intermediate form of political authority is incomplete in\nthe respect in which the exercise of political power involves the\nmutual recognition and affirmation of the status of each person. It is\nthe case that subjects have duties but those duties are not essentially\nconnected to anything in the authority. The subjects instead act more\nin accordance with reasons that are independent of the authority when\nthey obey the authority. So to the extent that a society ruled by an\nauthority that has the right to rule is an ideal of a moral community,\nthe other types of authority are lesser forms of a morally ideal\npolitical community. \n\nTo the extent that a duty of obedience is included in the concept of\npolitical authority, there can be different forms of obedience on the\npart of subjects. This implies a very distinct dimension of political\nauthority. When a political authority issues a command and the subject\nhas a duty to obey, what is the nature of this duty? One might have a\nduty to obey a command merely because it commands the subject to do\nsomething that is just and any alternative action would be unjust. Here\nthe duty to obey would depend on the content of the command. Commands\nthat are unjust or perhaps even commands that require actions that are\nnot exclusively just may not involve duties at all. \n\nThe commands of a legitimate political authority are usually thought\nto involve something more than this. The duty of the subject is\ngrounded not in the content of the command itself but in the nature of\nthe source issuing the command. The duty to obey is then automatically\ngenerated when the command is issued by the appropriate authority and\nwhen it has the right form and provenance. In this respect, the duty to\nobey is content independent or independent of the content of the\nparticular command. One must obey because one has been commanded and\nnot because of the particular content of the command. One must do it\nbecause one has been told to do it. This kind of duty seems to be the\nmost central kind of duty involved in the duty to obey. It is the idea\nthat one must obey the authority because it is the authority. It does\nnot imply of itself that one owes the duty of obedience to the\nauthority so it does not imply that there is a right to rule on the\npart of the authority. \n\nHere we must distinguish a duty that is owed to the authority and a\nduty that is merely the result of the authoritative command. The duty\nthat is owed to the authority is grounded in the fact that the\nauthority possesses a feature that gives it a right to command and that\nit is in virtue of that right that one owes obedience. The idea is that\nthere is something just in itself that the authority be obeyed. \n\nOne other distinction that is worth making in this connection is the\ndistinction between a preemptive duty to obey and a duty that is not\npreemptive. A preemptive duty is one that replaces other duties. It\nputs other duties out of play when it comes into play. A preemptive\nduty is not weighed against other duties that might relate to what one\nis thinking of doing. Of course, a preemptive duty may not preempt all\nother considerations, its preemption may operate only with a limited\nscope and thus preempt only some limited set of considerations. \n\nAn example of a preemptive duty is the case of a promissory\nobligation. If I have agreed to do something for you and I suddenly see\nsome pleasurable alternative to fulfilling my obligation, most people\nwould think that I ought to exclude the consideration of pleasure\naltogether from my deliberations even though the pleasure would be a\nconsideration had I made no promise. It is simply not something that I\ncan legitimately weigh in the balance against the promissory\nobligation. So if an authority issues a command and the duty to obey is\na preemptive duty, then the subject does not weigh the other duties\nthat might otherwise apply to him in the balance with the preemptive\nduty. The preemptive duty simply excludes the other duties. By\ncontrast, if a duty is not preemptive, then when it comes time to\ncomply with it, one must balance it with other duties that weigh for\nand against acting in accord with the duty. \n\nMost think that the duties associated with authority are content\nindependent in the sense that one must do what one is told even if one\nis skeptical about the merits of the command. There is some\nskepticism, however, about the claim that legitimate political\nauthorities impose preemptive duties on subjects. These people have\nquestioned the rationality of preemptive duties or reasons for\naction. Surely, there are times when what appear to be preempted\nconsiderations all add up to a consideration that outweighs the\npreempting consideration. How can this be understood on the preemption\nmodel? Some have argued that authoritative commands simply give\nespecially weighty content independent duties, which can be balanced\nagainst other duties (Shapiro 2002). The discussion of instrumentalism\nwill say a bit more about these criticisms below. \n\nThe most demanding notion of authority is the idea of a political\nauthority that has a right to rule that correlates with a duty to obey\nthat is owed to the authority and that is a content independent and\npreemptive duty. \n\nMost who think of legitimate authority as a kind of moral power to\nchange the moral situation of others think of it as creating duties in\nothers.  And this is certainly the most prominent and striking\nexercise of authority.  But political authorities do not only create\nduties in others in and some cases do not purport to create such\nduties at all.  The most prominent instances of this can be found in\ninternational institutions.  The Security Council of the United\nNations exercises authority in a variety of ways: sometimes acting as\na kind of legislative body and sometimes acting as a kind of executive\nbody.  Its executive authority is its traditional role in\ninternational law.  But this executive authority is quite distinct\nfrom the kind of executive authority we see in the state.  The\nSecurity Council exercises its executive authority primarily by\nauthorizing actions and not by carrying them out by itself or by\nrequiring them.  One way to describe the moral power of the Security\nCouncil is that it gives a liberty to states to prosecute wars.  It\ndoes this against a background of a general prohibition of all war\nexcept in the case of self-defense.  It suspends that prohibition for\ncertain states.  It does not require them to act, it only permits them\nto act in a warlike way.  This is because the agent of enforcement in\nthe international system is a decentralized one. \n\nFurthermore the Dispute Settlement Mechanism of the World Trade\nOrganization functions in very much the same way.  The dispute\nsettlement system first determines whether a state has in fact\nviolated its agreements on trade and tariffs with another state.  And\nwhen it determines this, it permits the plaintiff state to act in a\nway that would normally be in violation of its agreements.  It permits\nretaliation through the system of tariffs and non-tariff barriers.  It\ncannot require this retaliation.   \n\nHence the two most effective and authoritative institutions in the\ninternational system do not impose duties at all in many cases, they\nexercise a moral power to alter the moral situation of states but the\nalteration is from duty to permission in many cases.  To be sure, they\ndo this against the background of treaties and agreements that have a\nkind of legislative force and that do purport to impose genuine\nduties.  And there are duties not to interfere with the authorized\nactivity, but the point remains that the primary exercise is one of\nchanging duties to permissions.  This may confirm Applebaum's idea\nthat authority need not impose duties. \n\nOne reason for keeping our minds open to different accounts of\npolitical authority is that there are different kinds of political\nauthority.  Different accounts may be suitable to different kinds of\nauthority.  Indeed, different principles grounding authority may be\nsuitable to different kinds of authority.  One thing that is not often\nenough discussed in treatments of political authority is the fact that\nthere are very different kinds of political authority.  Within the\nstate alone there is legislative authority, executive authority,\njudicial authority, and administrative authority; these different\nkinds of authority can have distinct sub-branches of authority.  And\nthere are political authorities outside of the modern state, namely\ninternational institutions.  These have a very distinct kind of\nauthority at least in the contemporary world and the authority of\nthese different agencies is grounded in different principles. \n\nAs an illustration of different forms of authority for different\npolitical entities consider the different parts of the modern state.\nWe might think that a democratic legislative assembly has a genuine\nright to rule in the sense that citizens owe obedience to it.  They\nmight owe this obedience because the assembly pools all the democratic\nrights of all the citizens and so citizens treat each other as equals\nby complying with the assembly's directives.  But citizens do not owe\nit to courts to respect their judgments about the law.  The courts may\ncreate duties but the duties are not owed to them.  The same\npresumably goes for policemen and adminstrators as well.  They seem to\nhave moral powers to create duties but these duties are not owed to\nthem.  Furthermore, the grounds of authority might be distinct for\nthese two kinds of entities.  The democratic conception might provide\nthe basis of the authority of the assembly while the authority of\ncourts and administrators may be more instrumentally grounded. \n\nFew theorists after Thomas Hobbes and David Hume have argued that\nthere is a general duty to obey the law or that political authority is\ngenerally legitimate (Hobbes 1668; Hume 1965). Most theorists have\nargued that the legitimacy of political authority is one that holds\nonly when the political authority satisfies certain normatively\nimportant conditions. What we will review here are some of the main\ntheories that attempt to explain when a political authority has\nlegitimacy. \n\nGeneral theories are theories that identify general properties that\nvirtually any kind of political regime can have that gives them\nlegitimacy. Special theories are ones that mark off particular classes\nof regimes that have legitimacy or that have a particularly high level\nof legitimacy. There are really four types of general theory of\npolitical authority and then there are a variety of special theories of\npolitical authority. The four types of general theory of legitimacy are\nconsent theories, reasonable consensus theories, associative obligation\ntheories and instrumentalist theories. The two historically important\nforms of special theory in the West have been the Divine Right of Kings\ntheories and democratic theories. \n\nAt the root of all contemporary discussions of the legitimacy of\nauthority is the problem posed by Robert Paul Wolff concerning the\nincompatibility of moral autonomy and political authority. The problem\nis really only connected with the kinds of political authority that\nimply content independent duties to comply with authoritative commands.\nThe basic idea is that it is incompatible for a subject to comply with\nthe commands of an authority merely because it is the command of the\nauthority and for the subject to be acting morally autonomously. Wolff\nthinks that each person has a duty to act on the basis of his own moral\nassessment of right and wrong and has the duty to reflect on what is\nright and wrong in each particular instance of action. Such a person\nwould be violating his duty to act autonomously if he complies with\nauthoritative commands on grounds that are independent of the content\nof the commands. So the duty of autonomy is incompatible with the duty\nof obeying political authority. This is the challenge of philosophical\nanarchism (Wolff 1970). \n\nThe worry is that authority is never legitimate because the kind of\nobedience associated with authority is inconsistent with the autonomy\nof the subject. We can see, however, that this worry applies only to\ncertain accounts of authority, which imply duties to obey on the part\nof the subjects. The account of authority as justified coercion is not\naffected by this argument nor is the account of legitimate authority\nconsisting of a justification right affected by this worry. Still, most\naccounts of the nature of authority do imply content independent duties\non the part of the subjects. We can see that any content independent\nduty, whether it is a duty not to interfere with the authority's\ncommand or it is a duty to obey the authority, is called into question\nby this argument. \n\nOne can see different accounts of the legitimacy of political\nauthority as responses to the anarchist challenge. Let us start with\nthe instrumentalist account of legitimacy. The canonical statement of\nthis notion of legitimate authority is provided by Joseph Raz. He calls\nit the Normal Justification Thesis. It asserts that “the normal\nway to establish that a person has authority over another person\ninvolves showing that the alleged subject is likely better to comply\nwith reasons which apply to him (other than the alleged authoritative\ndirectives) if he accepts the directives of the alleged authority as\nauthoritatively binding and tries to follow them, rather than by trying\nto follow the reasons which apply to him directly.” (Raz\n1986) \n\nThis conception of the legitimacy of authority flows from the idea\nthat “authoritative directives should be based on reasons which\nalready independently apply to the subjects of the directives and are\nrelevant to their action in the circumstances covered by the\ndirective” (Raz 1986.) According to Raz, what should guide\ngovernment decisions about what commands to give subjects is what the\nsubjects already have reason to do. For instance, subjects already have\nreason to give a fair share of resources for the common good.\nAuthorities merely help them comply with these reasons by establishing\nan efficient and fair system of taxation. Subjects have reason to\ndefend their fellow countrymen and authorities help them do this by\nestablishing an army in an efficient and fair way. Authorities do these\nthings by issuing commands to subjects that are meant to replace the\nreasons that already apply to the subjects. Instead of the subject\ntrying to figure out exactly how much he owes and who to give it to by\ncoordinating it with many other people, the authority simply takes over\nthese tasks, determines what the subject has reason to do and expects\nthe subject to take its authoritative command as a reason instead of\nthe reasons that directly apply to the action. An authority does its\njob well and is therefore legitimate when it enables subjects to act\nbetter on the reasons that apply to them when they take the commands as\ngiving them preemptive reasons. \n\nAn instrumentalist attempts to meet Wolff's challenge by saying that\nan authority is legitimate when one complies better with one's duty\noverall by submission to authority than by trying to act on the basis\nof one's own assessments of what is right and wrong in each instance.\nThis amounts to a rejection of the duty of autonomy that is central to\nthe anarchist idea. Or at least it is a rejection of the idea that the\nduty of autonomy is the most fundamental duty. But it does get at\nsomething important. Wolff's challenge states in a rather general way\nthe worry that there is something immoral about failing to critically\nreflect about what one ought to do in each instance of action. And he\nstates that submitting to the commands of the state is precisely a case\nof failing to act on one's critical assessment of a situation. The\ninstrumentalist suggests a way in which it is not immoral to fail to\ncritically reflect on one's prospective actions in each instance.\nIndeed, the instrumentalist can argue that it is sometimes immoral to\ninsist on critically reflecting and acting autonomously when one may\nactually act worse as a result of consistently critically reflecting.\nWe frequently act on the basis of rules of action, without considering\nall the details of the circumstances in which we act on the grounds\nthat trying to take all the details of each situation into account for\neach action would produce bad decisions. The instrumentalist argues\nthat we ought to take this kind of attitude to the commands of the\nstate when we will better act in accordance with our duty overall by\ndoing so than by attempting to make independent assessments of the\nworth of our actions in every case (see Raz 1986, ch. 3.) \n\nThis response to the philosophical anarchist challenge establishes\nonly a piecemeal duty to obey the state. The instrumentalist argues\nthat some states some of the time issue commands that we (or at least\nsome individuals) ought to submit to without critical reflection on\neach command. It does not imply that the duty to obey the state extends\nto all commands of the state and to all subjects. It only applies when\nthe subject would likely better comply with duties overall by treating\nthe commands as authoritative (i.e. establishing content independent\nand preemptive duties to obey the commands) than by acting on the basis\nof an independent assessment of the rightness of each action. Whether\nthe commands impose duties or not depends on features of the subject\nsuch as his or her knowledge of the issues related to the commands and\nso forth. \n\nOf course, it is important to note that not every act of obedience\nwill ensure better compliance with reason, there will be cases when the\ncommands of the state do not accord with the best reasons. Raz's\nconception of authority depends for its cogency on the thought that as\nlong as the subject does better by reason overall by obeying certain\nclasses of commands, the subject has a duty to obey every one of the\ncommands: the correct as well as the incorrect. In some sense, the\nobedience to the commands has a greater likelihood of ensuring\nconformity with reason. Finally, this particular account of the duty to\nobey does not assert that the discharging of the duties is owed to the\nstate. This account does not establish any fundamental right to rule on\nthe part of the state. \n\nThe power of this account of political authority and the duty to\nobey depends essentially on the account of practical reasoning that\nlies at its base. Many have argued that this conception of practical\nreasoning is flawed. They have worried that the indirect form of\npractical reasoning that it requires is not legitimate. The worry can\nbe stated fairly easily. The form of practical reasoning this account\nof authority includes requires that we ignore the reasons that apply\ndirectly to the action we are about to undertake even though sometimes\nthose reasons will count against the action. The question arises, when\nare the reasons that directly apply to the action so strongly opposed\nto the action that we must override the preemptive reason? \n\nIn the case of rule following, we sometimes encounter particular\ninstances in which following the rule is counterproductive. How do we\ndetermine when we ought to follow the rule and when we ought not to\nfollow the rule? Does such determination involve the very deliberation\nabout particular instances that was meant to be excluded by the rule?\nSome have argued that rule following cannot be rational since it cannot\nbe rational to ignore the particular facts of each case (Hurd\n2001). \n\nRaz's main response to this criticism has been to say that we look\nfor clear cases in which the rule is to be overridden and ignore the\nother cases and that only by doing this do we best comply with reason.\nLimiting exceptions to the rule to clear cases obviates the need for\ndeliberation in every case. \n\nAnother version of the philosophical anarchist challenge may seem to\navoid the critical edge of the above approach. This approach, defended\nby A. John Simmons (Simmons 2001) and Leslie Green (Green 1989) asserts\nthat each person has a right not to be bound by the state's commands.\nThis thesis is quite different from the kind of anarchism defended by\nWolff. The latter asserts that each individual has a duty to be\nautonomous. The present theory asserts merely that a person has a right\nnot be subjected to another's imposition of duties. The philosophical\nanarchist then argues that only if a person consents to being bound to\nthe political authority can the person actually be bound. The final\npremise in the philosophical anarchist argument is that it is either\npractically impossible or at least actually untrue that states can be\nset up in such a way that they can demand the obedience of all and only\nthose who have consented to their authority. So, the anarchist\nconcludes, no state is legitimate and perhaps no state can ever be\nlegitimate. \n\nIt is important to note that this view does not imply that one must\nnever obey the state. It merely implies that one does not have content\nindependent duties to obey the state and that the state does not have a\nright to rule. A reasonably just state will command one to do things\nthat are reasonably just and in many cases one must obey those commands\nbecause they are just. What one is not required to do on the\nphilosophical anarchist view is obey any state just because it has\ncommanded one to do certain things. \n\nTo discuss this view, we will first discuss the arguments people\nhave given for the consent theory of political authority. We will also\ndiscuss some counterarguments. Then we will discuss a popular\nmodification of the consent theory that is designed to avoid\nphilosophical anarchism. \n\nThe consent theory of political authority states only a necessary\ncondition of the legitimacy of political authority. It states that a\npolitical authority is legitimate only if it has the consent of those\nwho are subject to its commands. Many have argued that in addition to\nconsent, a state must be minimally just for it to be legitimate (Locke\n1990). \n\nA number of arguments have been presented in favor of this view.\nLocke's argument is that each person has an equal natural right to\nfreedom and that this implies that at the age of maturity no one may be\nsubordinated to anyone else's commands by nature (Locke 1990). Let us\ncall this the natural right argument. Such subordination would\nviolate the equal freedom of the subordinated person. To the extent\nthat political authority involves issuing commands and requiring others\nto follow the commands, it seems to involve subordinating one person to\nthe commands of another and thus violates the natural right to freedom\nof the subordinated person. \n\nA natural objection to this line of reasoning is to state that\npolitical authority is actually necessary to protecting each person's\nequal freedom. Locke himself argued that the state of nature would be\nquite threatening to each person's ability to live freely because there\nare likely to be many disagreements about what rights each person has\nand so people are likely to trespass on each other's rights.\nFurthermore he argued that when there is such disagreement, we need an\nimpartial judge to determine when rights have been violated. And\nagainst criminals we need a police power to enforce the rights that\npeople have. Locke argues that only by establishing political society\nwith a legislature that makes known and settled laws and establishing a\njudiciary that resolves remaining controversies between people and\nhaving an executive power that enforces the laws can people's rights\nand freedoms be protected. \n\nOnce we have the above argument in mind, it is hard to see the force\nof the natural right argument for no political authority without\nconsent. We might think that the very liberty that is being invoked to\nsupport the case for the necessity of consent is better protected by a\nreasonably just political authority. The instrumentalist can then argue\nthat one protects the liberty of each and every person better by\ninstituting political authority and by treating its commands as\nauthoritative. And so the instrumentalist could argue that insofar as\nliberty is a fundamental value, it would be immoral not to support a\nreasonably just political authority and treat its commands as\nauthoritative. \n\nThe natural right theorist might argue in response that the above\nargument seems to involve a kind of utilitarianism of rights. Such a\nview says that it is justified to violate one person's right in order\nto protect the rights of others. But, such a theorist might say, the\nnatural rights of persons are side constraints against actions; they\nare not to be violated even if others' rights are better protected as\na consequence. This entry will not go into the many issues that arise\nin the discussion of deontology and consequentialism here. We will\nreturn to the issue of side constraints after the discussion of the\nnext argument. \n\nSome have proposed what this entry will call the options\nargument against the kind of considerations the instrumentalist\nadduces. The instrumentalist argues that I have natural duties of\njustice to promote just institutions and that these duties are best\nsatisfied by complying with the authority of a reasonably just\nstate. But the philosophical anarchist could argue that though I may\nhave a duty of justice, it does not entail that I must obey any\nparticular institution for promoting justice. The idea here is that\njust as Amnesty International may not require me to pay dues to it\nregardless of my membership even though these dues would clearly\nadvance the protection of human rights throughout the world, so the\nstate may not require me to comply with its commands even though such\ncompliance would advance the purposes of justice in the world. Let us\nsuppose that the reasons clearly favor my support of Amnesty\nInternational. Intuitively, it still may not require me to lend it\nsupport. Only if I have voluntarily joined and voluntarily remain in\nAmnesty do I have a duty to do what the conditions of membership\nrequire. And I am under no obligation to join Amnesty; I may join\nother organizations to fulfill whatever duties of aid that I have. So\nwhether I ought to join Amnesty and be subject to membership dues is\nup to me. The consent theorist seems to think that, in the same way,\nonly if I voluntarily transact to obligate myself to comply with the\nstate's commands can I be said to have a duty to comply with the\nstate. I must somehow enlist myself in the project of promoting the\ngood causes that the state promotes (Simmons 2001). \n\nThis argument may miss a central idea in the instrumentalist account\nof authority. The instrumentalist account is premised on the view that\nnot only does the state help one discharge one's duties of justice; it\nasserts that compliance with the state is necessary to the discharge of\none's duties. Hence, one acts unjustly if one fails to comply with the\nstate's commands. \n\nTo understand this, we need to introduce another concept. The idea\nis that the state does not only promote justice, it\nestablishes justice. What does this mean? It means that for a\nparticular community, the state determines what justice requires in the\nrelations between individuals. It does this by defining the relations\nof property and exchange as well as the institutions of the criminal\nlaw and tort law. To say that the state's legislative activity\nestablishes justice is not the same as saying that the state's activity\nconstitutes justice. Justice is still an independent standard of\nassessment on this account. \n\nThe reason for saying that the state establishes justice is that, in\nJoseph Raz's words, justice and morality more generally, underdetermine\nthe legislation necessary to bring about justice in a community. This\nmeans that one can implement the same principles of justice by means of\nmany different sets of rules. But one can treat others justly only if\none is on the same page as the others. So what is just in a particular\ncircumstance will depend in part on the set of rules that the others\nare acting on. To the extent that the state determines the basic\nframework of rules, it determines which actions are just and which are\nnot. One does not act justly, on this account, by deciding not to\ncomply with the state one lives in and sending money to another state\nor association. If one fails to comply with the rules of property or\nthe rules of exchange, one treats others unjustly. The options argument\nsuggests that somehow there is a way that one can discharge one's duty\nto others by doing something other than obeying the law. Instead of\nobeying the law of property of the society in which I live, I may\nsimply decide to send money to another part of the world where property\nrights are enforced. But this argument fails to appreciate the central\nimportance of law to defining justice among persons. Though not all\nlaws are just, justice among persons in any even moderately complex\nsociety requires law and obedience to law. \n\nOne argument for consent theory essayed by Simmons asserts that a\nperson ought to be free to act on the basis of personal reasons as\nopposed to impersonal reasons. So even if the state does help each\nperson act more on the basis of impersonal reasons that apply to them\nindependent of the state, a person may refuse, on the basis of personal\nreasons, to accept the directives of the state. And so, it is argued,\nthe state's imposition of duties on the individual may occur only if\nthe individual has consented to the state's authority (Simmons\n2001). \n\nThe idea that one can have personal reasons not to obey the commands\nof a reasonably just state is unclear. It might be referring to the\nidea that each person has a kind of personal prerogative that permits\nhim to avoid the demands of morality generally. This idea was proposed\nby critics of utilitarianism as a way to avoid the excessive\ndemandingness of utilitarianism while keeping most of the view intact.\nUtilitarianism supplies exclusively impersonal reasons for action to\nindividuals. These seem to undermine the personal projects and\ninterests of individuals. Some have proposed that utilitarianism be\nmodified to accommodate the projects of individuals by including a\npersonal prerogative to act on the basis of personal reasons. Others\nhave argued that there ought to be a personal prerogative to ignore the\nimpersonal reasons of any set of moral requirements. \n\nBut this role for personal reasons does not seem to provide much in\nthe way of defense of the consent theory. One reason for this is that\nthese are reasons to avoid some of the demands of morality. But the\nissue at stake in the justification of authority is whether morality\ndemands obedience or not. If we think of these personal reasons as part\nof the structure of morality, on the other hand, then it would seem\nthat these personal reasons are best protected by a reasonably just\nstate that protects individual freedom. So the response to the claim\nthat individuals have personal reasons to evade the commands of the\nstate seems to fall prey to the same argument that undermines the\nnatural right approach. \n\nThere is another way to think of this personal reasons criticism of\ninstrumentalist approaches to political authority. The instrumentalist\napproach seems to be committed to the idea that an authority can be\nlegitimate even if most of the members of the society do not agree with\nwhat it is doing. As long as the state is requiring people to act as\nthey should act, the subjects have a duty to obey, even if they do not\nsee that they have this duty. Now one can see how this may be true in\nsome circumstances, where the members are deeply immoral or irrational.\nBut it seems perverse to think that whether the state has legitimate\nauthority is completely independent of the considered opinions of its\nsubjects. Here is the reason behind the appearance. The state, being a\ngroup of people, owes the subjects some kind of duty of respect for the\njudgments of those members. This duty of respect requires at least some\ndegree of responsiveness on the part of the state in making decisions.\nFurthermore the state, in part, is an institution that is grounded in\nthe need for decisions against a background of disagreement about what\nought to be done. For the state to make decisions against this\nbackground that completely ignores the views of the many dissenters\nseems a particularly egregious violation of the duty to accord some\nrespect to the opinions of reasonable adult human beings. \n\nConsent theories, reasonable consensus theories, associative\nobligation theories and democratic theories make these observations\npart of the foundation of their accounts of the legitimacy of\nauthority. The consent theory of political authority requires that for\nthe state to have authority over any person, the state must have the\nconsent of the person to that authority. Consent, on this account, is a\nnecessary condition of the legitimacy of authority though it need not\nbe a sufficient condition. The consent theory clearly makes an attempt\nto make political authority compatible with a due respect for the\nopinions of subjects. \n\nBut we might wonder if it doesn't go too far. For if consent is a\ngenuinely necessary condition of political authority, then it appears\nthat individuals may have the option of not obeying a perfectly just\nstate that has jurisdiction over the area in which they live. And they\nmay do this on perverse grounds or they may simply wish to free ride on\nthe benefits that the state confers without having to undertake any of\nthe burdens. How can this be legitimate and how can it undermine the\nauthority of a just state? It seems that in the effort to express\nrespect for the reasonable opinions of people, consent theory seems to\nhave gone too far in giving respect to immoral, irrational and\nunprincipled failures of consent (Raz 1986). \n\nThe consent theorist could respond to this difficulty with the claim\nthat it is only the state's claim to authority that is being held\nhostage, not the state's just activities. For if it is the case that\nthe person is merely free riding on desirable activities and that this\nis unjust then the person is acting wrongly. Hence, the justice of the\nactions of the state may be sufficient to condemn the actions of the\nfree rider and this can be done without attributing the right to rule\nto the state. \n\nBut now the instrumentalist could argue that obedience to the\nauthoritative commands of the state may be necessary to acting justly\nin many instances. The thought is that only if people treat the\ncommands of the state as providing content independent reasons for\nobedience can a reasonably just state actually perform the tasks that\nmake it just. If people are constantly second guessing the state's\ndecisions, the central roles of coordination, collective action and\nassurance in the establishment of justice by the state will be\nundermined. These are collective effects of second guessing. But the\ninstrumentalist will also argue that individuals will often act less in\naccordance with the reasons that apply to them if they fail to take the\ncommands of a reasonably just state as offering content independent\nreasons because only the state's commands can clue them in to what the\nrules that establish justice are in their particular community. The\ninstrumentalist may then argue that it is therefore wrong for the\nperson not to take the commands of the state as authoritative, at least\nin many circumstances. \n\nLocke, in part desiring to avoid these obvious difficulties or\nirrational and immoral failures of consent, introduced the notion of\ntacit consent (Locke 1990). The possibility of tacit consent allows\nthat one may consent without having to go through the usual motions\nassociated with expression of consent. For example, at a board meeting,\none consents tacitly to the chairman's scheduling a meeting if one says\nnothing when the chair asks for objections to the proposal. And that\ntacit consent is valid to the extent that the failure to object is\nunderstood as a kind of consent and is voluntary. \n\nThe main problem with tacit consent is the problem of\ninterpretation. How does one interpret the actions of another so as to\nthink of them as consenting though they did not explicitly do so?\nTheorists differ on the constraints that must be placed on the\ninterpretation of the behaviors of others. Simmons argues that for\nbehavior to count as tacit consent it the behavior must be explicitly\nunderstood by all to be a kind of consent, it must be clear how when to\nperform the act or omission that constitutes tacit consent, it is not\ndifficult to consent and the costs of dissent are not prohibitive. But\nit is not obvious that Locke had this in mind. Locke thought that the\nmere residing in a territory and voluntarily benefiting from the\nactions of a minimally just state were sufficient conditions of tacit\nconsent. One might think that Locke thought the following. If a person\nvoluntarily resides in a territory over which the state has\njurisdiction and that person benefits from the establishment of the\nrule of law and all the other amenities the state provides then that\nperson must know or ought to know that the state's provision of these\nbenefits depends on the obedience of the members of the society. But if\nthe person now continues to reside voluntarily in the state, that\nperson must know that others expect obedience from him unless he is\nunder some special exemption. He must know or ought to know, in other\nwords, that others can reasonably interpret his voluntary residence as\ncommitting him to obedience to the laws of the state. So, we have\nadequate reason to interpret a person's continued voluntary residence\nas a form of consenting to abide by the laws of the state. \n\nDavid Hume criticized this interpretive move (Hume 1965). He argued\nthat given the extraordinary costs to most people of moving out of the\ncountry of their birth, no one can sensibly interpret the voluntary\ncontinued residence of a person in a state as a case of tacit consent.\nHe draws an analogy with a person who has been carried involuntarily\nonto a ship by others and who now finds himself on the ship subject to\nthe commands of the captain and whose only alternative is to throw\nhimself into a stormy sea. Hume argues that such a person's remaining\non the ship can not be interpreted to be consenting to the authority of\nthe captain. The person is merely attempting to avoid the terrible cost\nof getting off the ship. \n\nBut it is not clear why Hume's argument is supposed to work. It\nsounds like the argument challenges the voluntariness of the consent.\nBut this cannot be a conclusive argument here. After all, many people\nconsent to things in order to avoid the terrible costs of not\nconsenting. People consent to pay their insurance premiums in order not\nto end up without health care when the time comes that they need it.\nPromises made on the battlefield to lay down arms on the condition that\nthe opponent will not harm one are also made under severe duress. But\nwe do not think that these promises are invalid or that they fail to\nobligate. So the fact that the alternative would be terrible is not a\nreason to think that those who choose to remain in a state are not\nthereby bound. \n\nOf course, Hume's example includes the fact that the person was\ncarried forcibly onto the ship. This may be doing more work that it\nshould be. For few people would say that the state has necessarily done\nsomething wrong by imposing its jurisdiction over a territory on which\na person is born. We need, then, to change Hume's example so that the\nperson who is on the boat is on it through no fault of anyone on the\nboat, though he may have ended up there involuntarily. \n\nOne possibility is that Hume thinks that we cannot interpret the\ncontinuing residence of a person in a state as a case of consent to the\nauthority of the state because we have no reason to think that the\ncontinuing residence was chosen as a result of reflection on whether it\nconstituted consent. The impoverished person who remains in the state\nin which he finds himself gave no thought whatsoever to any\nconsideration other than that to move would be highly costly or\notherwise unpleasant. We have no reason to think that he gave any\nthought to the question of consent and so it is illegitimate to\ninterpret his behavior in that way. \n\nBut it is not obvious that this reasoning succeeds. If a person\nbenefits by residing in a territory and everyone knows that the\nbenefit only arises because of the obedience to law of the members,\nshouldn't it be clear to this person that his compliance is expected\nof him if he remains in the territory? And does his remaining in the\nterritory thereby imply that he consents to the authority of the\nterritory? \n\nOf course it is true of any particular person that his\ncompliance is not necessary to the maintenance of the benefits of\npublic order. But at the same time it is clear that unless there is\nsome special reason for this person not to be subject to the rules\neveryone else is subject to, elementary norms of fairness will suggest\nto him and everyone else that compliance is expected of him just as it\nis of everyone else. \n\nThis would seem to be a basis for interpreting the person's behavior\nas a case of consent. Anyone can see that the compliance of each person\nis expected of those who reside in a territory as long as the law is\nreasonably just. If someone has not considered these facts, perhaps he\nshould be held responsible for consenting anyway. After all, if we look\nat Simmons's central board room case we might have the same reaction to\nsomeone who, having been told that failure to object implies consent to\na policy, fails to object but only because he doesn't want to anger his\ngirlfriend in the group and really gives no thought to the question of\nconsent. Surely he has tacitly consented, despite his irresponsible\nattitude. So why not think that the person who continues to reside\nvoluntarily in a reasonably just state? \n\nAn important objection to the idea of tacit consent is that it begs\nthe question about how a state gets its authority. Some argue that a\ngroup of persons that has no authority to issue commands in the first\nplace cannot require people submit to their commands or leave a piece\nof territory they are falsely claim as under their jurisdiction\n(Brilmayer 1989; Wellman 2001). In a variation on the boardroom example\ndescribed above, Brilmayer imagines that instead of the chairman\nproposing a date for a meeting, a window washer swings in and makes the\nsame proposal and asks for objections. Clearly in that case, failure to\nregister objections would not constitute consent to the proposed\nschedule. The reason for this is that only a duly constituted authority\ncan have the right to make such a proposal. But, the claim to authority\nis precisely what tacit consent is supposed to support. So as an\naccount of authority the tacit consent view seems to beg the\nquestion. \n\nThis criticism is right as far as it goes. But there are four points\nto note about it. First, it applies to explicit consent as well as\ntacit consent. My consent to a person's doing something does not\nlegitimate that person's doing it nor does it obligate me to respect\nhis doing it unless he already has a right to make the proposal. In the\ncase of political authorities, my consent to someone's issuing commands\nover a piece of territory that she has no right to rule over does not\nlegitimate her commands nor does it obligate me. \n\nSecond, it is not a criticism of Locke since he clearly thinks that\ntacit consent only legitimates and obligates under conditions where\nthere is a duly constituted authority. Locke thinks that the right to\nrule of an authority must be traced back to an original act of consent\nin the state of nature (where there is no prior political authority) to\nform a political body. That political body then confers, by the consent\nof all the members, authority on a particular institutional arrangement\n(as long as it is minimally just). The function of tacit consent as\nwell as the consent of new members is simply to renew this already\ncreated authority. \n\nThird, if Locke is right and consent can create authority out of the\nstate of nature, it may be possible for tacit consent to do the same.\nWe can imagine a state of nature scenario where a highly persuasive\nperson gets up amid the chaos and makes a proposal to create the\ninitial political body from the state of nature and then states very\nclearly that if there are objections, they should be raised without\nfear. And we can imagine the very same person making a proposal to\ncreate the particular structure of authority over the political body\nand calling for objections in the same way as before. There is no\nobvious reason why this could not work. Locke did not suggest this but\nit does not seem impossible. \n\nThese last two points defeat the argument that tacit consent\nrequires a prior duly constituted authority. What Locke's picture\nsuggests is that valid consent or tacit consent do not require that the\nconsented to proposal be made by someone already in authority; they can\nbe valid as long as the proposal is made when there is no authority\nalready in place. The proposals can be drawn up by someone who has the\nright to make the proposal. In the state of nature, anyone presumably\nhas this right. \n\nFourth, even if tacit consent cannot establish authority it may\nstill be a necessary condition on the legitimacy of authority. For if a\npolitical authority is duly constituted in the way Locke describes but\nfails to offer its citizens a right of exit or imposes severe burdens\non people who wish to exit, it will become illegitimate over time,\naccording to Locke. \n\nStill, this criticism is quite important because it shows that\nneither consent nor tacit consent can stand alone as bases of political\nlegitimacy. An exclusively consent based theory of political authority\nseems to require that the original consent take place in a state of\nnature prior to political authority. And this further requirement seems\nto weaken the plausibility of the view. \n\nWhat is worrisome about this kind of approach from the standpoint of\nconsent theory is that it seems to ignore all the particular reasons\nthat people may have for not consenting. Indeed, it seems to rely on\nthe premise that anyone should see that if they reside within the\nterritory of a reasonably just state, they are properly expected to\ncomply with the law, at least insofar as it is reasonably just. Consent\ntheory, by contrast, seems to rely on the thought that individuals may\nproperly reject these kinds of obligations for purely personal\nreasons. \n\nWe can see a dilemma that arises from the above considerations. If\ntacit consent genuinely arises from voluntary residence in a\nreasonably just state, then it appears that the interpretation of the\nperson's residence does not take account of what many consent\ntheorists have thought was essential to consent theory, namely the\npersonal reasons of the subject in deciding whether to consent or\nnot. On the other hand, if those personal reasons are ones that the\nsubject may properly take into account in deciding whether to consent,\nthen the interpretive move required for voluntary residence to\ngenerate obligations in all subjects of a reasonably just state cannot\nwork. It cannot work because subjects may have personal reasons for\nnot consenting, which voluntary residence does not rule out. \n\nHence, it appears that tacit consent theory cannot conform to what\nmany have taken to be the highly individualistic spirit of consent\ntheory. So fans of consent theory are not likely to agree to the idea\nthat people generally tacitly consent to the state's authority when\nthey voluntarily reside in its territory. Critics of consent theory are\nlikely, however, to question that highly individualistic approach in\nthe manner sketched above. \n\nDavid Estlund has tentatively advanced a new and intriguing suggestion\nfor shoring up an essentially voluntarist account of\nauthority. Estlund argues that even in the absence of explicit or\ntacit consent in some cases persons may be said to have consented to\npolitical authority.  He describes this as “normative\nconsent”.  The idea is motivated in the following way.  Estlund\nnotes that actual explicit cases of consenting can fail to produce\nobligations if what is consented to is seriously immoral.  The consent\nis nullified (in its obligation producing effect) by the evident\nimmorality of its content.  Estlund then enquires as to whether the\nlack of consent under certain circumstances mightn't similarly be\nnullified in cases where it is plainly wrong not to consent.  Why\naren't these symmetrical he asks?  Estlund envisions a case in which a\npassenger airplane has crashed and in which there is still a\nsignificant chance of saving many passengers through a very well\ncoordinated effort.  As it happens an airline attendant stands up and\n“takes control” by giving commands to various people thus\norganizing the relief effort.  Let us suppose that this is evidently\nreasonably successful but that it really does require the cooperation\nof (nearly) everyone to whom the airline attendant chooses to give\ndirectives. And let us suppose that the attendant is not giving any\nclearly immoral commands.  Estlund notes that it would be clearly\nimmoral for someone in a position to give essential help not to agree\nto go along with the attendant's commands.  Now suppose that someone\nin such a situation refuses to consent to the arrangement.  Estlund\nasks whether their non-consent isn't nullified in the light of the\nfact that it is immoral not to consent.  And if the non-consent is\nnullified, then its normal effect in preserving the liberty of the\nagent is not produced.  In this case the person is no longer free to\nact independent of the purported authority.  Since his non-consent is\nnullified, he has, in effect, consented and he is therefore under an\nobligation to the authority.  This is normative consent. \n\nEstlund is anxious to distinguish this idea from hypothetical consent\nor what you would have consented to had you been a better person.  Yet\nhe does want to say that this normative consent has a genuine\nconnection to the will. \n\nOne might wonder here if there is any genuine connection to the will\nof the normative consenter and so whether this really does shore up\nthe voluntarist view.  But a further issue that might be raised here\nis whether Estlund has genuinely identified the fallback point of\ninvalidated consent and non-consent.  Perhaps the proper description\nof the fall back point is neither consent nor non-consent. A person\nwho has consented to something deeply immoral doesn't thereby refuse\nconsent to that action, the person simply has failed to do anything\nmorally productive.  Perhaps the idea in the case of the seriously\nimmoral non-consent is that the person has simply not done anything\nmorally productive. What happens in both cases is that the previous\nmoral situation of the agent remains in place.  In the nullified\nconsent case you still have an obligation not to do what you consented\nto do and in the nullified non-consent case you still have an\nobligation to do what you refuse to consent to do. This would suggest\nthat the decision between consent and non-consent has here no\nnormative effect: whatever the agent decides, the previous moral\nsituation remains in place.  Hence there is a kind of symmetry that\nholds here between the two cases.  It is just that the default\nposition is neither consent nor non-consent.  The one implication this\nmight have is that one may ask the person again until he agrees,\nwhereas normally if a person refuses to consent to something you must\nleave them alone.  \n\nReasonable consensus views of political authority attempt to find a\nkind of mean between the extreme individualism of consent theory and\nthe lack of respect for people's opinions of the instrumentalist views.\nJohn Rawls argues that the liberal principle of political legitimacy\nrequires that coercive institutions be so structured that they accord\nwith the reasonable views of the members of the society. As long as\nthey do so they have the right to impose duties on their members. The\nmembers may not demur on the basis of unreasonable views. Furthermore,\nit is not necessary on this view that the persons over whom authority\nis wielded have voluntarily acted or given any sign of agreement. All\nthat need be the case is that the basic principles that regulate the\ncoercive institutions be ones that the reasonable members can agree to\n(Rawls 1996). \n\nThis view seems to be a kind of middle position between consent\ntheory and the instrumentalist views. It does not allow individuals to\ndivest themselves of obligations on spurious or merely self-interested\nbases because it specifies what is and is not a reasonable basis for\nagreement to the basic principles of the society. At the same time it\nevinces a respect for the opinions of the members of society since it\nrequires that the basic principles that regulate the society accord\nwith the reasonable views of the members. \n\nThis account of legitimacy is based on an adherence to a principle of\nreasonableness. The basic principle asserts that reasonable persons\nwill propose fair terms of cooperation with other reasonable persons\nonly on condition that the terms can be justified to those others on\nthe basis of premises that they can reasonably accept. There has been\nmuch discussion of this principle and its underpinnings but this entry\nwill focus on a central worry concerning this idea. \n\nA number of criticisms have been made against this kind of view.\nMany have argued that the relevant notion of reasonableness is likely\nto be very difficult to specify in a way that is both plausible and\ncompatible with possible consensus. The key difficulty with reasonable\nconsensus theories is that they rely on the possibility of consensus on\nat least a sufficient number of basic norms to say that there is\nconsensus on the basic principles that regulate a society. So if one\nattempts to come up with a notion of reasonableness that is\nsufficiently robust to generate agreement of this sort, then one is\nlikely to have a notion that is quite controversial. And then the view\ndoes not seem to take a sufficiently respectful view of the opinions of\nthe members of society since so many are likely to disagree with the\nconception of the reasonable. On the other hand, if one elaborates a\nconception of the reasonable that is sufficiently weak for most persons\nin the society to satisfy it, then one is not likely to generate\nagreement on the basic principles of the society. \n\nThe main worry is that the idea demands a level of consensus among\nmembers of society that is incompatible with the ordinary conditions of\npolitical societies (Christiano 1996; Waldron 1999). The principle\ndemands that there be a kind of consensus among citizens on the basic\nprinciples that underpin the operation of political society. \n\nThis consensus seems to be unattainable under the conditions of\nmodern society. One way, however, in which Rawls has argued in favor of\nthe attainability of the consensus is to say that it need only be an\noverlapping consensus. The idea here is that citizens do not have to\nagree on everything but only on those principles that apply to the\nbasic structure of society. And even here, when citizens disagree on\nsome issue of social justice, the opposing views are taken off the\ntable. So citizens can disagree on what the nature of the good life is\nand on religious questions and even different issues relating to social\njustice. As long as there are certain principles that everyone agrees\nto, which apply to the basic structure of society, full consensus is\nnot necessary. Hence, the consensus need only be an overlapping\none. \n\nThough this idea goes some way towards alleviating the worry that\ntoo much consensus is required by Rawls's theory, it does not go nearly\nfar enough. There is one main way in which the overlapping consensus\nfails to provide the kind of consensus that Rawls requires. If a group\nof citizens agrees on a set of principles for regulating society and\nsome of the citizens also think that some other principles apply, the\noverlapping consensus idea is that the citizens who hold the\nidiosyncratic views must take those particular demands off the table\nand must argue only on the basis of the shared principles. The idea is\nthat everyone appeals only to those principles that lie in the overlap\nand not to those that do not lie in the overlap. A legitimate exercise\nof political power is one that is grounded only in those principles\nthat lie in the overlap. This seems to diminish the amount of agreement\nnecessary to make a society legitimate. \n\nBut this appearance is an illusion. To see this we need only think\nof those people who hold idiosyncratic views. If the society they live\nin is exclusively grounded in principles that lie in the overlap of\nprinciples, then these people will have reason to complain that the\nsociety is unjust to the extent that the idiosyncratic principles are\nignored. For instance, if someone holds the idiosyncratic view that\npeople ought to receive in accordance with their desert then a society\nthat does not act to make sure that this principle is respected is one\nthat will be considered unjust by that person. They will live in a\nsociety that is unacceptable to them in a certain important respect\nrelevant to justice. \n\nOf course, if the desert principle is used to ground the basic\ninstitutions of society even though it does not lie in the overlap then\nthose who think that desert is not a proper principle of justice will\nlikely think that they are living in a society that they regard as\nunjust. The principle of legitimacy will imply in this context that the\nbasic institutions of society are illegitimate because they are not\nbased on principles everyone accepts. But surely the same can be said\nof those who hold the idiosyncratic principles. They can complain that\nthey are required to go along with institutions that are unjust by\ntheir lights. The imposition on them implied by the basic institutions\nthat fail to distribute in accordance with desert is as great as would\nbe the imposition on the others implied by institutions that do\ndistribute goods in accordance with desert. There is a complete\nsymmetry here. Indeed, one way to put this point is to say that those\nwho hold that desert is not a genuine principle of justice are\nthemselves holding an idiosyncratic view when we take into account the\nfact that many think that desert is a genuine principle of justice. \n\nAs a consequence of these considerations, only a complete consensus\nof political principles will satisfy the principle of legitimacy that\nRawls defends. But complete consensus on political principles is\nimpossible to achieve given the conditions of ordinary political\nsocieties. And so to the extent that this principle of legitimacy is\nunsatisfiable in ordinary political societies, it appears to be an\nunacceptably utopian principle. In particular, it seems to be an\nunacceptable principle of political legitimacy because a principle of\npolitical legitimacy is partly framed for the purpose of according\nmoral credentials to a society in the circumstances of political\ndisagreement. \n\nOne classical account of political authority has modeled political\nauthority and the attendant obligations on the obligations of family\nand the authority of the parents. Plato gives this account of authority\nand obligation among others in the Crito (Plato 1948). A recent attempt\nto ground the legitimacy of political authority in this way is Ronald\nDworkin's (Dworkin 1986). This view is meant to capture the idea that a\npolitical society can have legitimate authority even if it is not a\nvoluntary association and even if there is disagreement on many\npolitical principles. \n\nIf we take the family as a model here, we can see that children\nacquire obligations to obey their parents and to love and support their\nparents and siblings without having voluntarily entered into the\nrelationships. And there may be some relation of authority between\nparents and children at least till the latter reach the age of\nmaturity. Another model Dworkin invokes is that of friendship. He\nargues that though friendship does have an important voluntary\ncomponent, it is not the case that people voluntarily agree to the\nterms of a friendship. They find themselves acquiring obligations of\nfriendship as the friendship grows. Of course there is little in the\nway of authority in friendship and even in the family there is little\nauthority once the children reach maturity. \n\nThe analogy between obligations of family, friendship and political\nsociety is grounded in the idea that in all three of these, individuals\nare obligated to abide by the rules or norms of the community. Dworkin\nargues that legitimate political authority arises as a consequence of\nthe acquisition on the part of members of a political society of\nobligations to obey the rules of a genuine associative community. This\ngives the putative authority justification for coercing the members\ninto obedience of the rules, which is the key element of authority on\nDworkin's account. \n\nDworkin attempts to discern the basis of obligation in friendships\nand families by the process of interpretation of these social\npractices. His thesis is that communities that satisfy four conditions\nfor being genuine communities thereby generate obligations to go along\nwith the terms of the association. The four conditions are: one, each\nmember of the community sees herself as having special obligations to\nthe other members; two, they see the obligations as owed to each of the\nothers personally; three, these obligations are understood to flow from\na concern for the well being of each of the members; and four, the\nobligations are understood as flowing from a plausible version of equal\nconcern for all the members. Any community that satisfies these four\nconditions is a genuine community and thereby generates obligations in\neach of the members to comply with the terms of the association. \n\nDworkin thinks that families and friendships satisfy these\nconstraints in many cases and that only when they satisfy them do they\ngenerate obligations. He also thinks that a certain kind of political\nsociety can satisfy these conditions, which he calls a community of\nprinciple, i.e., a community wherein each member sees himself or\nherself as bound by common principles to all the others. \n\nOne might worry that a political society cannot be expected to\ngenerate the kinds of emotional bonds people have towards one another\nin families or friendships (Simmons 2001). And one might think that in\nthe absence of such bonds, the four conditions will not be satisfied.\nDworkin denies this. He agrees that political societies do not generate\nthese kinds of emotional bonds, but he asserts that emotional bonds are\nnot necessary either causally or conceptually to the satisfaction of\nthe four conditions. \n\nDworkin argues that the attribution of the four conditions to a\nrelationship occurs through an interpretation of that relationship so\nit need not be the case that each person is aware of satisfying any of\nthe four conditions when they do. Consider a person who appeals to his\nfellow citizens on the basis of a principle of freedom of speech on the\ngrounds that it is part of their constitution. This person is committed\nto legal principles that he shares with other citizens. He will be\ncommitted to the principles underlying the other elements of the\nconstitution and the legal history of his country. He will be committed\nto a principle of equality to the extent that it is part of the\nconstitution. We can interpret this person's behavior and the similar\nbehavior of others as committed to special obligations to their fellow\ncountrymen to the extent that it is the shared constitution they are\nappealing to. We can interpret this person as expressing a kind of\nequal concern for his fellow countrymen to the extent that he is\nappealing to legal principles that protect all. And we can interpret\nhim in this way even if he himself would not have asserted it. And to\nthe extent that people conform to this kind of practice more generally,\nwe can interpret their behavior generally as satisfying the four\nconditions of associative obligation. \n\nThe community of principle satisfies the four conditions. Dworkin\nattempts to show how a political community can generate special\nobligations of citizens to each other. A community of principle is\nregulated by principles that have been elaborated in a distinctive way\nin the particular community. Citizens see themselves as obligated to\nabide by those principles only in relation to the others who have\nparticipated in elaborating them. The principles do require that\neveryone be included and that everyone's well being counts and counts\nequally. \n\nThe idea of a community of principle is meant to accommodate\nsignificant disagreement in the society in two ways. First, people may\nnot think that the principles in the society are the best ones. They\nmay simply be the best interpretation of their shared legal culture and\nhistory. So people may try to advance their own conceptions of the best\nprinciples. Second, people will disagree about the best interpretations\nof the shared legal culture and thus may think that the society is\ngrounded in different principles. \n\nBut surely, the satisfaction of some of the conditions must depend\non exactly what principles are in the community. Principles that are\nfocused on liberty and that avoid any reference to well being, such as\nKant would require of political principles, presumably would not\nsatisfy the last two conditions. Principles that are not egalitarian,\nsuch as those that governed the United States during the first century\nof its existence and probably longer, would not satisfy the last\ncondition. So it is not clear that being a community of principle is a\nsufficient condition for satisfying the four conditions. \n\nIt is also not obvious that it is necessary that a community be a\ncommunity of principle in order for it to satisfy the four conditions\nin Dworkin's sense. For one can imagine a community in which\nindividuals are committed to democratic resolution of the disagreements\non justice that arise and thereby are committed to the equal importance\nof the well being of each member. They attempt to advance opposing\nprinciples of justice and conceptions of the common good and make\ncompromises when they cannot secure sufficient majorities for these.\nIndeed, this seems much closer to the character of modern democracies\nthan Dworkin's view. Such a society would satisfy the four conditions\nbut it is not clear that it is a community of principle. \n\nDworkin's idea that modern political societies can be seen as\ncommunities of principle is grounded in his emphasis on judicial\ninstitutions as the core institutions of modern political societies and\nhis account of legal interpretation. His view is that judges interpret\nthe law by creating a coherent account of as much of the black letter\nlaw as possible and by interpreting that black letter law in terms of\nprinciples that make the law be the best that it can be. Hence, judges\naim at producing a coherent account of the law overall by grounding it\nin the best basic moral principles that it can be grounded in. From\nthis he thinks of modern societies as being concerned to elaborate\ncommon principles by which the society can be guided. \n\nBut his emphasis on judicial decision making seems excessive. In the\ndemocratic legislative process, citizens often do not see themselves as\nbeing guided by common principles. They see themselves as disagreeing\nwith each other about what principles the society ought to be guided\nby. They also often see themselves as disagreeing with and trying to\nchange the principles they see embodied in the law. They may look at\nthe legislation in their community as negotiated compromises between\ndifferent principles and not as deriving from a common set of\nprinciples. And yet they do see themselves as members of a common\ndemocratic community. This aspect of democratic rivalry does not seem\nto be very well accommodated by Dworkin's view of modern societies as\ncommunities of principle. \n\nThe basic idea behind the democratic conception of legitimate\nauthority is that when there are disagreements among persons about how\nto structure their shared world together and it is important to\nstructure that world together, the way to choose the shared aspects of\nsociety is by means of a decision making process that is fair to the\ninterests and opinions of each of the members. When there is\ndisagreement about how to organize the shared system of law, property,\npublic education and the provision of public goods, no one can have his\nway entirely in this context without someone else not getting her way.\nEach person thinks that the ideas about justice and the common good\nwith which the others wish to organize their shared world are mistaken\nin some way. Yet there is a need for collective action. The only way to\ndo this that is reasonably fair to all the members is to make the\ndecision democratically. \n\nThe thought is that when an outcome is democratically chosen and\nsome people disagree with the outcome, as some inevitably will, they\nstill have a duty to go along with the decision because otherwise they\nwould be treating the others unfairly. If they refuse to go along and\ndisrupt the democratically chosen arrangements, they are assuming for\nthemselves a right to determine how things should go that overrides the\nequal rights of all the others. They are, in Peter Singer's words,\nassuming the positions of dictators in relation to the others. For if\nthey turned out to be in the majority, they would demand the compliance\nof the others. \n\nThe idea of fairness that underpins the democratic process is\ngrounded in different ways in different theories. The basic idea of\nequality is shared by most democratic theorists. Some argue that there\nis a fundamental duty of equal respect for the opinions of others that\ngrounds democratic decision making in the context of pervasive\ndisagreement (Singer 1974; Waldron 1999). Others wish to ground this\nduty of respect for the opinions of others in a deeper principle of\nequal concern for the interests of each member of society (Christiano\n1996). \n\nOn this kind of view the democratic assembly has a right to rule and\nto the obedience of its members. This right of the democratic assembly\nis grounded in the right of each member of the assembly to be accorded\nequal respect. The duty of equal respect requires that the collective\ndecision process gives each a vote in a broadly majoritarian process\nand a robustly equal opportunity to participate in the deliberations\nand negotiations leading to decisions. The equal rights of each of the\nmembers are in effect pooled in the democratic assembly so that because\none owes each person equal respect, and the democratic way of making\ndecisions embodies this equal respect, one owes the democratic assembly\nrespect. \n\nThe democratic assembly can be understood as the assembly of all\nadult citizens or better as the assembly of all the democratically\nchosen representatives of citizens. A conception of a democratic\nassembly requires, on this view, an account of the appropriate form of\ndemocratic representation (Christiano 1996). In addition, the\ndemocratic assembly is only one part of the complete system of\ngovernment. It is concerned with legislation only. In addition to this\na government requires executive and judicial functions whose legitimacy\nmay depend in part on other factors better grasped by the\ninstrumentalist view. \n\nThe duties that are owed the democratic assembly are content\nindependent and preemptive duties. They are content independent duties\nbecause each member has the duty, with a class of exceptions we will\nreview in a moment, just because the assembly has made a decision. The\nduties are preemptive because the citizen must put aside the\nconsiderations she initially planned on acting on in order to treat the\nrest of her fellow citizens with proper respect. The idea of equal\nrespect requires, on this account, deference to the decision of the\nmajority and not acting on one's own judgment when the majority\ndisagrees. So the decision of the majority gives a reason to obey that\npreempts or replaces the considerations one might act on were there no\nmajority decision. \n\nIt is important to note that this conception of authority is what was\ndescribed as a special conception above. The fact that democratic\nassemblies have authority does not imply that all other forms of\nregime never have authority. One might go along with a regime on the\nbasis of the instrumentalist conception of authority or even the\nconsent approach even if it is not democratic. It is clear\nnevertheless that democratic assemblies have a special kind of\nauthority. \n\nDemocratic decision making on this account can be evaluated from two\nvery different angles. On the one hand, one can evaluate a democratic\ndecision in terms of the justice or efficiency of the outcome of the\ndecision. One can ask whether the legislation is just or for the common\ngood. This is the standpoint of the citizen who argues in favor of\nlegislation and against others and tries to put together a coalition of\nlike minded people to advance the legislation. On the other hand,\ndemocratic decision making can be evaluated in terms of the way in\nwhich the decision was made. Did the process of decision making treat\nall of its members fairly or with equal respect? Are the institutions\nof legislative representation and of campaign finance, among others,\nfair? \n\nBut why should the equality embodied in the democratic assembly trump\nother considerations of justice? The democratic conception of\nauthority requires each person to submit issues to a democratic vote.\nSo if they advocate some policy on the grounds that it conforms with\nwhat they take to be the correct principle of justice J, and\nthe majority chooses a different policy on the grounds of an\nincompatible principle L, the democratic theory says that\nthey ought to accept the policy that is grounded in L because\nonly in this way do they accord the proper equal respect to their\nfellow citizens. \n\nBut someone might ask, why should the principle of equal respect take\nprecedence over the principle J? They are both principles of\njustice so we need some reason for favoring the equal respect\nprinciple in general over the others. \n\nOne answer to this is to say that social justice demands that\nprinciples of justice be public in the sense that they involve\nprinciples that can be shown to be implemented to everyone who is\nreasonably conscientious and aware of some basic facts of political\nlife (such as disagreement, fallibility and cognitive bias). This is a\nversion of the basic maxim of justice that justice must not only be\ndone, it must be seen to be done. The thought then is that to the\nextent that there is significant disagreement about the substantive\nprinciples of justice in play when policy is being decided, a just\nsociety requires some way in which publicly to embody the equal\ntreatment of all the individuals in society. The controversial\nprinciples guiding the formulation of policy do not generally satisfy\nthis constraint of publicity. Indeed, given the controversies over\njustice, individuals will think that the policies do not accord with\ntheir favored conception of equality. The democratic process does seem\npublicly to embody the equal standing of all citizens and the equal\nworth of their interests against the background of disagreement and\nfallibility and all the facts that attend these phenomena. So the\ndemocratic process seems uniquely capable of publicly embodying the\nprinciple of the equal importance of each person and the equal\nimportance of the advancement of their interests (Christiano 2004). \n\nCritics of this view might still take issue with the thesis that\nsocial justice requires that principles be public and that this gives\npriority to the principles that underpin democracy over those that\nunderpin substantive policy proposals. The question must be, why is\npublicity, in the sense sketched above, so important? \n\nThe question that arises for a democratic theory of authority is,\nwhen do the considerations of the justice or injustice of the outcome\noverride the considerations connected with the fairness of the process\nof decision making? \n\nThe claim that a democratic assembly has a right to rule is not\nincompatible with the idea that there are limits to that right. Indeed,\ntheorists have argued that the very same principle that grounds\ndemocratic authority also ground limits to that authority (Christiano\n2004.) The principle of public equality on which the argument for\ndemocracy is founded also grounds a set of liberal rights (freedom of\nconscience, association, speech and private pursuits). The reason for\nthis is that democratic assembly that fundamentally denied these\nliberal rights to individuals would publicly violate the duty of equal\nrespect to those individuals. Those who violate the basic liberal\nrights of others are publicly treating them as inferiors. To the extent\nthat the democratic assembly's claim of authority is grounded in the\npublic realization of the principle of equal respect, the authority\nwould run out when the democratic assembly makes law that undermines\nequal respect. This establishes, at least for one conception of\ndemocratic authority, a substantive set of limits to that\nauthority. \n\nInternational Institutions have acquired political authority over the\nlast half century or so.  They are quite diverse in character.  For\nsome, their authority has a somewhat different form than the authority\nassociated with the organs of the state.  And the grounds of the\nauthority of international institutions may be distinct as\nwell. Overall, these are complex institutions with a number of parts\nand so different principles may apply to the different parts.  For\nexample, with regard to the World Trade Organization, some principle\nof state consent may be the ultimate basis of the legitimacy of its\nlaw making function, while a very different kind of standard would be\nrelevant to judging the legitimacy of the dispute settlement\nmechanism. \n\nBecause global institutions operate in the context of a lack of\noverarching and centralized political power, the form and grounds of\nauthority are likely often to be distinct.  As I noted above, some of\nthe most powerful global institutions have powers to create\npermissions rather than duties as in Security Council of the United\nNations authorizations of the use of force. Another example is when\nthe World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism rules that\na state may restrict trade with another state in what would normally\nbe a violation of their agreements in order to retaliate against a\nstate that has violated the trade agreements. \n\nAnother interesting feature of international institutions is that\nstate consent appears to be a possible basis for the legitimacy of\ninternational institutions.  To be sure many would argue that\ninternational institutions ought to be evaluated solely on an\ninstrumental basis and others would argue that only democratic\ninternational institutions can be legitimate.  But state consent does\nhave a fighting chance of playing a large role in underpinning these\ninstitutions.  The international system is highly decentralized and\nstates are by far the most important instruments for making power\naccountable to persons that we know of. \n\nTo be sure, the state consent doctrine raises many questions.  For one\nthing, we must ask whether the consent of states that do not represent\ntheir peoples is a genuinely legitimating act.  Second, we must ask\nabout the fairness of the conditions under which consent is given.  If\nthe conditions are unfair and more powerful states take advantage of\nthe vulnerabilities of the weaker state, what impact does this have on\nthe legitimacy of the state?  Third, what normative weight, if any,\nattaches to a state's refusal of consent when it's cooperation is\nnecessary to the achievement of morally mandatory aims such as the\nprevention or mitigation of global warming?","contact.mail":"thomasc@u.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"u.arizona.edu"}]
