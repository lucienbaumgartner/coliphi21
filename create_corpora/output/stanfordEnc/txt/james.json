His twelve-hundred page\nmasterwork, The Principles of Psychology (1890), is a rich\nblend of physiology, psychology, philosophy, and personal reflection\nthat has given us such ideas as “the stream of thought”\nand the baby’s impression of the world “as one great blooming,\nbuzzing confusion” (PP 462). It contains seeds of pragmatism and\nphenomenology, and influenced generations of thinkers in Europe and\nAmerica, including Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, and\nLudwig Wittgenstein. James studied at Harvard’s Lawrence Scientific\nSchool and the School of Medicine, but his writings were from the\noutset as much philosophical as scientific. “Some Remarks on\nSpencer’s Notion of Mind as Correspondence” (1878) and\n“The Sentiment of Rationality” (1879, 1882) presage his\nfuture pragmatism and pluralism, and contain the first statements of\nhis view that philosophical theories are reflections of a\nphilosopher’s temperament.\n\n\n\nJames hints at his religious concerns in his earliest essays and\nin The Principles, but they become more explicit in The\nWill to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy\n(1897), Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the\nDoctrine (1898), The Varieties of Religious Experience\n(1902) and A Pluralistic Universe (1909). James oscillated\nbetween thinking that a “study in human nature” such\nas Varieties could contribute to a “Science of\nReligion” and the belief that religious experience involves an\naltogether supernatural domain, somehow inaccessible to science but\naccessible to the individual human subject. \n\n\n\nJames made some of his most important philosophical contributions in\nthe last decade of his life. In a burst of writing in 1904–5\n(collected in  Essays in Radical Empiricism (1912)) he set\nout the metaphysical view most commonly known as “neutral\nmonism,” according to which there is one fundamental\n“stuff” that is neither material nor mental.  In\n“A Pluralistic Universe” he defends the mystical and\nanti-pragmatic view that concepts distort rather than reveal reality,\nand in his influential Pragmatism (1907), he presents\nsystematically a set of views about truth, knowledge, reality,\nreligion, and philosophy that permeate his writings from the late\n1870s onwards.\n\n\n\nAlthough he was officially a professor of psychology when he published\nit, James’s discussion of Herbert Spencer broaches characteristic\nthemes of his philosophy: the importance of religion and the passions,\nthe variety of human responses to life, and the idea that we help to\n“create” the truths that we “register” (E 21). Taking up Spencer’s\nview that the adjustment of the organism to the environment is the\nbasic feature of mental evolution, James charges that Spencer projects\nhis own vision of what ought to be onto the phenomena he claims to\ndescribe. Survival, James asserts, is merely one of many interests\nhuman beings have: “The social affections, all the various forms of\nplay, the thrilling intimations of art, the delights of philosophic\ncontemplation, the rest of religious emotion, the joy of moral\nself-approbation, the charm of fancy and of wit—some or all of\nthese are absolutely required to make the notion of mere existence\ntolerable;…” (E 13). We are all teleological creatures at base,\nJames holds, each with a set of a priori values and\ncategories. Spencer “merely takes sides with the telos he\nhappens to prefer” (E 18). \n\nJames’s characteristic empiricism appears in his claim that values and\ncategories fight it out in the course of human experience, and that\ntheir conflicts “can only be solved ambulando, and not by any\na priori definition.” The “formula which proves to have the\nmost massive destiny,” he concludes, “will be the true one” (E\n17). Yet James wishes to defend his sense that any such formulation\nwill be determined as much by a freely-acting human mind as by the\nworld, a position he later (in Pragmatism) calls “humanism”:\n“there belongs to mind, from its birth upward, a spontaneity, a\nvote. It is in the game, and not a mere looker-on; and its judgments\nof the should-be, its ideals, cannot be peeled off from the body of\nthe cogitandum as if they were excrescences…” (E 21). \n\nThe substance of this essay was first published in Mind in\n1879 and in the Princeton Review in 1882, and then\nrepublished in The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular\nPhilosophy in 1897. Although he never quite says that rationality\nis a sentiment, James holds that a sentiment—really a set of\nsentiments—is a “mark” of rationality. The philosopher, James\nwrites, will recognize the rationality of a conception “as he\nrecognizes everything else, by certain subjective marks with which it\naffects him. When he gets the marks, he may know that he has got the\nrationality.” These marks include a “strong feeling of ease, peace,\nrest” (WB 57), and a “feeling of the sufficiency of the present\nmoment, of its absoluteness” (WB 58). There is also a “passion for\nparsimony” (WB 58) that is felt in grasping theoretical unifications,\nas well as a passion for distinguishing, a “loyalty to clearness and\nintegrity of perception, dislike of blurred outlines, of vague\nidentifications” (WB 59). The ideal philosopher, James holds, blends\nthese two passions of rationality, and even some great philosophers go\ntoo far in one direction or another: Spinoza’s unity of all things in\none substance is “barren,” as is Hume’s “‘looseness and\nseparateness’ of everything…” (WB 60). \n\nSentiments of rationality operate not just in logic or science, but in\nordinary life. When we first move into a room, for example, “we do not\nknow what draughts may blow in upon our back, what doors may open,\nwhat forms may enter, what interesting objects may be found in\ncupboards and corners.” These minor uncertainties act as “mental\nirritant[s],” which disappear when we come to know our way\naround the room, to “feel at home” there (WB 67–8). \n\nJames begins the second part of his essay by considering the case when\n“two conceptions [are] equally fit to satisfy the logical demand” for\nfluency or unification. At this point, he holds, one must consider a\n“practical” component of rationality.  The conception that “awakens\nthe active impulses, or satisfies other aesthetic demands better than\nthe other, will be accounted the more rational conception, and will\ndeservedly prevail” (WB 66). James puts the point both as one of\npsychology—a prediction of what will occur—and as one\nof judgment, for he holds that it will prevail “deservedly.”  \n\nAs in his essay on Spencer, James explores the relations between\ntemperaments and philosophical theorizing.  Idealism, he holds,\n“will be chosen by a man of one emotional constitution,\nmaterialism by another.” Idealism offers a sense of intimacy\nwith the universe, the feeling that ultimately I “am all.”\nBut materialists find in idealism “a narrow, close, sick-room\nair,” and prefer to conceive of an uncertain, dangerous and wild\nuniverse that has “no respect for our ego.” Let “the\ntides flow,” the materialist thinks, “even though they\nflow over us” (WB 76).  James is sympathetic both to the idea\nthat the universe is something we can be intimate with and to the idea\nthat it is wild and unpredictable.  If he criticizes idealism for its\n“sick-room air,” he criticizes reductive forms of\nmaterialism for denying to “our most intimate powers…all\nrelevancy in universal affairs” (WB 71). The intimacy and the\nwildness portrayed in these contrasting philosophies answer to\npropensities, passions, and powers in human beings, and the\n“strife” of these two forms of “mental\ntemper,” James predicts, will always be seen in philosophy (WB\n76). Certainly it is always seen in the philosophy of William\nJames.  \n In 1878, James agreed to write a psychology textbook for the American\npublisher Henry Holt, but it took him twelve years to produce the\nmanuscript, and when he did he described it to Holt as “a\nloathsome, distended, tumefied, bloated, dropsical mass, testifying to\nnothing but two facts: 1st, that there is no such thing as\na science of psychology, and 2nd, that W. J. is an\nincapable” (The Letters of William James, ed. Henry\nJames. (Boston: Little, Brown, 1926, pp. 393–4). Nevertheless,\nthis thousand page volume of psychology, physiology and philosophy has\nproved to be James’s masterwork, containing early statements of his\nmain philosophical ideas in extraordinarily rich chapters on\n“The Stream of Thought,” “The Consciousness of\nSelf,” “Emotion,” “Will,” and many other\ntopics. \n\nJames tells us that he will follow the psychological method of\nintrospection in The Principles, which he defines as “the\nlooking into our own minds and reporting what we there discover” (PP\n185). In fact he takes a number of methodological approaches in the\nbook.  Early on, he includes chapters on “The Functions of the Brain”\nand “On Some General Conditions of Brain Activity” that reflect his\nyears as a lecturer in anatomy and physiology at Harvard, and he\nargues for the reductive and materialist thesis that habit is “at\nbottom a physical principle” (PP 110).  As the book moves along, he\ninvolves himself in discussions with philosophers—for example\nwith Hume and Kant in his hundred-page chapter on the self, and he\nfinds himself making metaphysical claims that anticipate his later\npragmatism, as when he writes: “There is no property ABSOLUTELY\nessential to any one thing.  The same property which figures as\nthe essence of a thing on one occasion becomes a very inessential\nfeature on the other” (PP 959). \n\nEven “introspection” covers a range of reports.  James discusses the\nexperiments that his contemporaries Wundt, Stumpf and Fechner were\nperforming in their laboratories, which led them to results such as\nthat “sounds are less delicately discriminated in intensity than\nlights” (PP 513).  But many of James’s most important and\nmemorable introspective observations come from his own life. For\nexample: \n Our father and mother, our wife and babes, are bone of our bone and\nflesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our very selves is\ngone. If they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If they are\ninsulted, our anger flashes forth as readily as if we stood in their\nplace. (PP 280). \n There is an excitement during the crying fit which is not without a\ncertain pungent pleasure of its own; but it would take a genius for\nfelicity to discover any dash of redeeming quality in the feeling of\ndry and shrunken sorrow (PP 1061). \n “Will you or won’t you have it so?” is the most probing\nquestion we are ever asked; we are asked it every hour of the day, and\nabout the largest as well as the smallest, the most theoretical as\nwell as the most practical, things. We answer by consents or\nnon-consents and not by words. What wonder that these dumb\nresponses should seem our deepest organs of communication with the\nnature of things! (PP, p. 1182).   \n\nIn this last quotation, James tackles a philosophical problem from a\npsychological perspective. Although he refrains from answering\nthe question of whether these “responses” are in fact deep organs of\ncommunication with the nature of things—reporting only that they\nseem to us to be so—in his later writings, such as Varieties\nof Religious Experience and A Pluralistic Universe, he\nconfesses, and to some degree defends, his belief that the question\nshould be answered affirmatively.  \n\nIn the deservedly famous chapter on “The Stream of Thought” James\ntakes himself to be offering a richer account of experience than those\nof traditional empiricists such as Hume. He believes relations, vague\nfringes, and tendencies are experienced directly (a view he would\nlater defend as part of his “radical empiricism.”) James finds\nconsciousness to be a stream rather than a succession of “ideas.”  Its\nwaters blend, and our individual consciousness—or, as he\nprefers to call it sometimes, our “sciousness”—is “steeped and\ndyed” in the waters of sciousness or thought that surround it. Our\npsychic life has rhythm: it is a series of transitions and\nresting-places, of “flights and perchings” (PP 236). We rest when we\nremember the name we have been searching for; and we are off again\nwhen we hear a noise that might be the baby waking from her nap. \n\nInterest—and its close relative, attention—is a major\ncomponent not only of James’s psychology, but of the epistemology and\nmetaphysics that seep into his discussion. A thing, James states in\n“The Stream of Thought,” is a group of qualities\n“which happen practically or aesthetically to interest us, to\nwhich we therefore give substantive names…”. (PP\n274). And reality “means simply relation to our emotional\nand active life…whatever excites and stimulates our interest is\nreal” (PP 924).  Our capacity for attention to one thing\nrather than another is for James the sign of an “active\nelement in all consciousness,…a spiritual\nsomething…which seems to go out to meet these qualities and\ncontents, whilst they seem to come in to be received by it.” (PP\n285). Faced with the tension between scientific determinism and our\nbelief in our own freedom or autonomy, James—speaking not as a\npsychologist but as the philosopher he had become—argues that\nscience “must be constantly reminded that her purposes are not\nthe only purposes, and that the order of uniform causation which she\nhas use for, and is therefore right in postulating, may be enveloped\nin a wider order, on which she has no claims at all” (PP\n1179). \n\nIn his discussions of consciousness James appears at various times to\nbe a reductive materialist, a dualist, a proto-phenomenologist, and a\nneutral psychologist who wouldn’t dare to consider philosophical\nquestions. One of the most original layers of The Principles\nlies in James’s pursuit of a “pure” description of the stream of\nthought that does not presuppose it to be either mental or material, a\npursuit that anticipates not only his own later “radical empiricism,”\nbut Husserl’s phenomenology.  In his chapter on “Sensation,” for\nexample, James is at pains to deny that sensations are “in the mind”\nand then “by a special act on our part ‘extradited’ or\n‘projected’ so as to appear located in an outer world” (PP\n678). He argues that our original experiences are objective, that\n“only as reflection becomes developed do we become aware of an inner\nworld at all” (PP 679).  However, the objective world originally\nexperienced is not the world of spatial relations that we think:\n  \n\nJames’s chapter on “Habit,” early in the book, begins with\nhabit as a physical matter but ends by considering its ethical\nimplications.  James argues that the laws of nature are themselves\nhabits, “nothing but the immutable habits which the different\nelementary sorts of matter follow in their actions and reactions upon\neach other” (PP 109).  In our brains, habits are paths of\nnervous energy, as rivers and streams are the paths of water’s flow.\nAt skin level, even a scar is a kind of habit, “more likely to\nbe abraded, inflamed, to suffer pain and cold, than are the\nneighboring parts” (PP 111).  On the psychological level as\nwell, “any sequence of mental action which has been frequently\nrepeated, tends to perpetuate itself ...” (PP 116).  Habits are\nuseful in diminishing the attention that we have to devote to our\nactions, thereby allowing us to develop “our higher powers of\nmind” (PP 126).  On the social level, habit is “the\nenormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative agent.\nIt alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of ordinance, and\nsaves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the\npoor” (PP 125).  The “ethical implications of the law of\nhabit,” (PP 124) as James sees them, concern which habits we\nchoose to develop, and when.  Many habits must begin early in life:\n“Hardly ever is a language learned after twenty spoken without a\nforeign accent” (PP 126).  We should strive to make our\n“nervous system our ally instead of our enemy” by forming\nas many good habits as we can, as early in life as we can.  Even later\nin life, we are to keep our capacity for resolution in shape by every\nday or two doing “something for no other reason than that you\nwould rather not do it” (PP 130). \n\n Two noteworthy chapters late in The Principles are “The\nEmotions” and “Will.” The first sets out the theory—also\nenunciated by the Danish physiologist Carl Lange—that emotion\nfollows, rather than causes, its bodily expression: “Common-sense\nsays, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are\nfrightened and run; we are insulted by a rival, are angry and\nstrike. The hypothesis here to be defended says that this order of\nsequence is incorrect…that we feel sorry because we cry, angry\nbecause we strike, afraid because we tremble…” (PP\n 1065–6). The significance of this view, according to James, is\nthat our emotions are tied in with our bodily expressions. What, he\nasks, would grief be “without its tears, its sobs, its suffocation of\nthe heart, its pang in the breast-bone?” Not an emotion, James\nanswers, for a “purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity” (PP\n1068). \n\nIn his chapter on “Will” James opposes the theory of his\ncontemporary Wilhelm Wundt that there is one special feeling—a\n“feeling of innervation”—present in all\nintentional action.  In his survey of a range of cases, James\nfinds that some actions involve an act of resolve or of outgoing\nnervous energy, but others do not. For example: \n\nThe chapter on “Will” also contains striking passages that\nanticipate the concerns of The Varieties of Religious\nExperience:  about moods, “changes of heart,”\nand “awakenings of conscience.”  These, James\nobserves, may affect the “whole scale of values of our motives\nand impulses” (PP 1140).  \n\nJames’s popular and influential, The Will to Believe and Other\nEssays in Popular Philosophy, published in 1897, collects\npreviously published essays from the previous nineteen years,\nincluding “The Sentiment of Rationality” (discussed\nabove), “The Dilemma of Determinism,” “Great Men and\nTheir Environment” and “The Moral Philosopher and the\nMoral Life.” The title essay—published just two years\nearlier—proved to be controversial for seeming to recommend\nirresponsible or irrationally held beliefs.  James later wrote that he\nshould have called the essay “the right to\nbelieve,” to indicate his intent to justify holding\ncertain beliefs in certain circumstances, not to claim that\nwe can (or should) believe things simply by an act of will. \n\nIn science, James notes, we can afford to await the outcome of\ninvestigation before coming to a belief, but in other cases we\nare “forced,” in that we must come to some belief even if all the\nrelevant evidence is not in. If I am on an isolated mountain trail,\nfaced with an icy ledge to cross, and do not know whether I can make\nit, I may be forced to consider the question whether I can or should\nbelieve that I can cross the ledge. This question is not only forced,\nit is “momentous”: if I am wrong I may fall to my death, and if I\nbelieve rightly that I can cross the ledge, my holding of the belief\nmay itself contribute to my success. In such a case, James asserts, I\nhave the “right to believe”—precisely because such a belief\nmay help bring about the fact believed in. This is a case “where a\nfact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its\ncoming” (WB, 25). \n\nJames applies his analysis to religious belief, particularly to the\npossible case in which one’s salvation depends on believing in God in\nadvance of any proof that God exists. In such a case the belief may be\njustified by the outcome to which having the belief leads.  He\nextends his analysis beyond the religious domain, however, to a wide\nrange of secular human life: \nMoral questions too are both momentous and unlikely to be sustained by\n“sensible proof.” They are not matters of science but of\n“what Pascal calls our heart” (WB 22).  James defends our\nright to believe in certain answers to these questions anyway. \n\nAnother essay in the collection, “Reflex Action and\nTheism,” attempts a reconciliation of science and\nreligion. James’s expression “reflex action” alludes to\nthe biological picture of the organism as responding to sensations\nwith a series of actions. In the higher animals a theoretical or\nthinking stage intervenes between sensation and action, and this is\nwhere, in human beings, the thought of God arises. James maintains\nthat this thought is a natural human response to the universe,\nindependent of any proof that God exists, and he predicts that God\nwill be the “centre of gravity of all attempts to solve the\nriddle of life” (WB, 116).  He ends the essay by advocating a\n“theism” that posits “an ultimate opacity in things,\na dimension of being which escapes our theoretic control” (WB\n143). \n\nThe Will to Believe also contains James’s most developed\naccount of morality, “The Moral Philosopher and the Moral\nLife.”  Morality for James rests on \nsentience—without it there are no moral claims and no moral obligations. But\nonce sentience exists, a claim is made, and morality gets “a\nfoothold in the universe” (WB 198). Although James insists that\nthere is no common essence to morality, he does find a guiding\nprinciple for ethical philosophy in the principle that we\n“satisfy at all times as many demands as we can” (WB\n205). This satisfaction is to be achieved by working towards a\n“richer universe…the good which seems most organizable,\nmost fit to enter into complex combinations, most apt to be a member\nof a more inclusive whole” (WB 210). This work proceeds by a\nseries of experiments, by means of which we have learned to live (for\nthe most part) without “polygamy and slavery, private warfare\nand liberty to kill, judicial torture and arbitrary royal\npower.” (WB 205) . However, James holds that there is\n“nothing final in any actually given equilibrium of human\nideals, [so that] as our present laws and customs have fought and\nconquered other past ones, so they will in their turn be overthrown by\nany newly discovered order which will hush up the complaints that they\nstill give rise to, without producing others louder still” (WB\n206). \n\nJames’s essay “On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings,”\npublished in his Talks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students\non Some of Life’s Ideals in 1899, illustrates another important\nelement of James’s moral outlook.  The blindness to which James draws\nattention is that of one human being to another, a blindness he\nillustrates with a story from his own life.  Riding in the mountains\nof North Carolina he comes upon a devastated landscape, with no trees,\nscars in the earth, here and there a patch of corn growing in the\nsunlight.  But after talking to the settlers who had cleared the\nforest to make room for their farm, James comes to see it their way\n(at least temporarily): not as devastation but as a manifestation of\n“duty, struggle, and success.” James concludes: “I\nhad been as blind to the peculiar ideality of their conditions as they\ncertainly would also have been to the ideality of mine, had they had a\npeep at my strange indoor academic ways of life at Cambridge”\n(TT 233–4).  James portrays a plurality of outlooks in the essay\nto which he attaches both a metaphysical/epistemological and an\nethical import.  This plurality, he writes: \n\nAlthough “On a Certain Blindness” is about toleration and the\nappreciation of different points of view, James sets out his own\nromantic point of view in his choice of heroes in the essay:\nWordsworth and Shelley, Emerson, and W. H. Hudson, all of whom are\nsaid to have a sense of the “limitless significance in natural things”\n(TT 244).  Even in the city, there is “unfathomable significance and\nimportance” (TT 254) in the daily events of the streets, the river,\nand the crowds of people. James praises Walt Whitman, “a hoary\nloafer,” for knowing how to profit by life’s common opportunities:\nafter a morning of writing and a bath, Whitman rides the omnibus down\nBroadway from 23rd street to Bowling Green and back, just for the\npleasure and the spectacle of it.  “[W]ho knows the more of truth,”\nJames asks, “Whitman on his omnibus-top, full of the inner joy with\nwhich the spectacle inspires him, or you, full of the disdain which\nthe futility of his occupation excites?” (TT 252).  James’s interest\nin the inner lives of others, and in writers like Tolstoy who share\nhis understanding of their “mysterious ebbs and flows” (TT 255), leads\nhim to the prolonged study of human religious experience that he\npresented as the Gifford Lectures in 1901–2, published as The\nVarieties of Religious Experience in 1902. \n\nLike The Principles of Psychology, Varieties is “A\nStudy in Human Nature,” as its subtitle says. But at some five hundred\npages it is only half the length of The Principles of\nPsychology, befitting its more restricted, if still large,\nscope. For James studies that part of human nature that is, or is\nrelated to, religious experience.  His interest is not in religious\ninstitutions, ritual, or, even for the most part, religious ideas, but\nin “the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their\nsolitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to\nwhatever they may consider the divine” (V 31). \n\nJames sets out a central distinction of the book in early chapters on\n“The Religion of Healthy-Mindedness” and “The Sick\nSoul.” The healthy-minded religious person—Walt Whitman\nis one of James’s main examples—has a deep sense of “the\ngoodness of life,” (V 79) and a soul of “sky-blue\ntint” (V 80). Healthy-mindedness can be involuntary, just\nnatural to someone, but often comes in more willful forms. Liberal\nChristianity, for example, represents the triumph of a resolute\ndevotion to healthy-mindedness over a morbid “old hell-fire\ntheology” (V 91). James also cites the “mind-cure\nmovement” of Mary Baker Eddy, for whom “evil is simply a\nlie, and any one who mentions it is a liar” (V 107). For\n“The Sick Soul,” in contrast, “radical evil gets its\ninnings” (V 163). No matter how secure one may feel, the sick\nsoul finds that “[u]nsuspectedly from the bottom of every\nfountain of pleasure, as the old poet said, something bitter rises up:\na touch of nausea, a falling dead of the delight, a whiff of\nmelancholy….” These states are not simply unpleasant\nsensations, for they bring “a feeling of coming from a deeper\nregion and often have an appalling convincingness” (V\n136).  James’s main examples are Leo Tolstoy’s “My\nConfession,” John Bunyan’s autobiography, and a report of\nterrifying “dread”—allegedly from a French\ncorrespondent but actually from James himself. Some sick souls never\nget well, while others recover or even triumph: these are the\n“twice-born.” In chapters on “The Divided Self, and\nthe Process of Its Unification” and on “Conversion,”\nJames discusses St. Augustine, Henry Alline, Bunyan, Tolstoy, and a\nrange of popular evangelists, focusing on what he calls “the\nstate of assurance” (V 247) they achieve. Central to this state\nis “the loss of all the worry, the sense that all is ultimately\nwell with one, the peace, the harmony, the willingness to be,\neven though the outer conditions should remain the same” (V\n248). \nVarieties’ classic chapter on “Mysticism” offers\n“four marks which, when an experience has them, may justify us\nin calling it mystical…” (V 380). The first is\nineffability: “it defies expression…its quality must be\ndirectly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to\nothers.” Second is a “noetic quality”: mystical\nstates present themselves as states of knowledge. Thirdly, mystical\nstates are transient; and, fourth, subjects are passive with respect\nto them: they cannot control their coming and going. Are these states,\nJames ends the chapter by asking, “windows through which the\nmind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive world[?]” (V\n428). \n\nIn chapters entitled “Philosophy”—devoted in large part to\npragmatism—and “Conclusions,” James finds that religious\nexperience is on the whole useful, even “amongst the most important\nbiological functions of mankind,” but he concedes that this does not\nmake it true. Nevertheless, James articulates his own \nbelief—which he does not claim to prove—that religious experiences\nconnect us with a greater, or further, reality not accessible in our\nnormal cognitive relations to the world: “The further limits of our\nbeing plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of\nexistence from the sensible and merely ‘understandable’\nworld” (V 515). \n\nJames first announced his commitment to pragmatism in a lecture at\nBerkeley in 1898, entitled “Philosophical Conceptions and Practical\nResults.” Later sources for Pragmatism were lectures at\nWellesley College in 1905, and at the Lowell Institute and Columbia\nUniversity in 1906 and 1907. Pragmatism emerges in James’s book as six\nthings: a philosophical temperament, a theory of truth, a theory of\nmeaning, a holistic account of knowledge, a metaphysical view, and a\nmethod of resolving philosophical disputes. \n\nThe pragmatic temperament appears in the book’s opening chapter, where\n(following a method he first set out in “Remarks on Spencer’s\nDefinition of Mind as Correspondence”) James classifies philosophers\naccording to their temperaments: in this case “tough-minded” or\n“tender-minded.” The pragmatist is the mediator between these\nextremes, someone, like James himself, with “scientific loyalty to\nfacts,” but also “the old confidence in human values and the resultant\nspontaneity, whether of the religious or romantic type” (P 17). The\nmethod of resolving disputes and the theory of meaning are on display\nin James’s discussion of an argument about whether a man chasing a\nsquirrel around a tree goes around the squirrel too. Taking meaning as\nthe  “conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may\ninvolve,” the pragmatist philosopher finds that two “practical”\nmeanings of “go around” are in play: either the man goes North, East,\nSouth, and West of the squirrel, or he faces first the squirrel’s\nhead, then one of his sides, then his tail, then his other side. “Make\nthe distinction,” James writes, “and there is no occasion for any\nfurther dispute.” \n\nThe pragmatic theory of truth is the subject of the book’s sixth (and\nto some degree its second) chapter. Truth, James holds, is “a species\nof the good,” like health. Truths are goods because we can “ride” on\nthem into the future without being unpleasantly surprised. They “lead\nus into useful verbal and conceptual quarters as well as directly up\nto useful sensible termini. They lead to consistency, stability and\nflowing human intercourse.  They lead away from excentricity and\nisolation, from foiled and barren thinking” (103). Although James\nholds that truths are “made” (104) in the course of human\nexperience, and that for the most part they live “on a credit system”\nin that they are not currently being verified, he also holds the\nempiricistic view that “beliefs verified concretely by\nsomebody are the posts of the whole superstructure” (P\n100). \n\nJames’s chapter on “Pragmatism and Humanism” sets out his\nvoluntaristic epistemology. “We carve out everything,”\nJames states, “just as we carve out constellations, to serve our\nhuman purposes” (P, 100). Nevertheless, he recognizes\n“resisting factors in every experience of truth-making”\n(P, 117), including not only our present sensations or experiences but\nthe whole body of our prior beliefs. James holds neither that we\ncreate our truths out of nothing, nor that truth is entirely\nindependent of humanity. He embraces “the humanistic principle:\nyou can’t weed out the human contribution” (P, 122).  He also\nembraces a metaphysics of process in the claim that “for\npragmatism [reality] is still in the making,” whereas for\n“rationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all\neternity” (P 123). Pragmatism’s final chapter on\n“Pragmatism and Religion” follows James’s line\nin Varieties in attacking “transcendental\nabsolutism” for its unverifiable account of God, and in\ndefending a “pluralistic and moralistic religion”\n(144)based on human experience. “On pragmatistic\nprinciples,” James writes, “if the hypothesis of God works\nsatisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true”\n(143). \n\nOriginally delivered in Oxford as a set of lectures “On the\nPresent Situation in Philosophy,” James begins his book, as he\nhad begun Pragmatism, with a discussion of the temperamental\ndetermination of philosophical theories, which, James states,\n“are just so many visions, modes of feeling the whole push\n… forced on one by one’s total character and experience, and on\nthe whole preferred—there is no other truthful\nword—as one’s best working attitude” (PU 15). Maintaining\nthat a philosopher’s “vision” is “the important\nthing” about him (PU 3), James condemns the\n“over-technicality and consequent dreariness of the younger\ndisciples at our American universities…” (PU 13). \n  \nJames passes from critical discussions of Josiah Royce’s idealism and\nthe “vicious intellectualism” of Hegel to philosophers\nwhose visions he admires: Gustav Fechner and Henri Bergson. He praises\nFechner for holding that “the whole universe in its different\nspans and wave-lengths, exclusions and developments, is everywhere\nalive and conscious” (PU, 70), and he seeks to refine and\njustify Fechner’s idea that separate human, animal and vegetable\nconsciousnesses meet or merge in a “consciousness of still wider\nscope” (72). James employs Henri Bergson’s critique of\n“intellectualism” to argue that the “concrete pulses\nof experience appear pent in by no such definite limits as our\nconceptual substitutes are confined by. They run into one another\ncontinuously and seem to interpenetrate” (PU 127). James\nconcludes by embracing a position that he had more tentatively set\nforth in The Varieties of Religious Experience: that\nreligious experiences “point with reasonable probability to the\ncontinuity of our consciousness with a wider spiritual environment\nfrom which the ordinary prudential man (who is the only man that\nscientific psychology, so called, takes cognizance of) is shut\noff” (PU 135). Whereas in Pragmatism James subsumes\nthe religious within the pragmatic (as yet another way of successfully\nmaking one’s way through the world), in A Pluralistic\nUniverse he suggests that the religious offers a superior\nrelation to the universe. \n\nThis posthumous collection includes James’s groundbreaking essays on\n“pure experience,” originally published in 1904–5.\nJames’s fundamental idea is that mind and matter are both aspects of,\nor structures formed from, a more fundamental stuff—pure\nexperience—that (despite being called\n“experience”) is neither mental nor physical. Pure\nexperience, James explains, is “the immediate flux of life which\nfurnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual\ncategories… a that which is not yet any definite \nwhat, tho’ ready to be all sorts of whats…” (ERE\n46).  That “whats” pure experience may be are minds and\nbodies, people and material objects, but this depends not on a\nfundamental ontological difference among these “pure\nexperiences,” but on the relations into which they\nenter.  Certain sequences of pure experiences constitute physical\nobjects, and others constitute persons; but one pure experience (say\nthe perception of a chair) may be part both of the sequence\nconstituting the chair and of the sequence constituting a person.\nIndeed, one pure experience might be part of two distinct minds, as\nJames explains in a chapter entitled “How Two Minds Can Know One\nThing.” \n\nJames’s “radical empiricism” is distinct from his\n“pure experience” metaphysics. It is never precisely\ndefined in the Essays, and is best explicated by a passage\nfrom The Meaning of Truth where James states that radical\nempiricism consists of a postulate, a statement of fact, and a\nconclusion. The postulate is that “the only things that shall be\ndebatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn\nfrom experience,” the  fact is that relations are just as\ndirectly experienced as the things they relate, and the conclusion is\nthat “the parts of experience hold together from next to next by\nrelations that are themselves parts of experience” (MT,\n6–7). \n\nJames was still working on objections to his “pure\nexperience” doctrine, replying to critics\nof Pragmatism, and writing an introduction to philosophical\nproblems when he died in 1910.  His legacy extends into psychology and\nthe study of religion, and in philosophy not only throughout the\npragmatist tradition that he founded (along with Charles Peirce), but\ninto phenomenology and analytic philosophy. Edmund Husserl incorporated James’s notions of the “fringe” and “halo” into his phenomenology (Moran, pp. 276–80), Bertrand Russell’s The\nAnalysis of Mind is indebted to James’s doctrine of “pure\nexperience,” (Russell, 1921, pp. 22–6), Ludwig Wittgenstein learned about “the\nabsence of the will act” from James’s\nPsychology (Goodman, Wittgenstein and William James,\np. 81), and the versions of “neopragmatism” set out by\nNelson Goodman, Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam are saturated with\nJames’s ideas. James is one of the most attractive and endearing of\nphilosophers: for his vision of a “wild,”\n“open” universe that is nevertheless shaped by our human\npowers and answers to some of our deepest needs, but also, as\nRussell observed in his obituary, because of the “large\ntolerance and … humanity” with which he sets that vision\nout.
