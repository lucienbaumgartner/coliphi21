Insatiably curious and mordantly funny, he constructed\na naturalistic account of the various forms of government, and of the\ncauses that made them what they were and that advanced or constrained\ntheir development. He used this account to explain how governments\nmight be preserved from corruption. He saw despotism, in particular,\nas a standing danger for any government not already despotic, and\nargued that it could best be prevented by a system in which different\nbodies exercised legislative, executive, and judicial power, and in\nwhich all those bodies were bound by the rule of law. This theory of\nthe separation of powers had an enormous impact on liberal political\ntheory, and on the framers of the constitution of the United States of\nAmerica.\n\n\n\nCharles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu,\nwas born on January 19th, 1689 at La Brède, near Bordeaux, to a\nnoble and prosperous family. He was educated at the Oratorian\nCollège de Juilly, received a law degree from the University of\nBordeaux in 1708, and went to Paris to continue his legal studies. On\nthe death of his father in 1713 he returned to La Brède to\nmanage the estates he inherited, and in 1715 he married Jeanne de\nLartigue, a practicing Protestant, with whom he had a son and two\ndaughters. In 1716 he inherited from his uncle the title Baron de La\nBrède et de Montesquieu and the office of Président\nà Mortier in the Parlement of Bordeaux, which was at the time\nchiefly a judicial and administrative body. For the next eleven years\nhe presided over the Tournelle, the Parlement's criminal division, in\nwhich capacity he heard legal proceedings, supervised prisons, and\nadministered various punishments including torture. During this time\nhe was also active in the Academy of Bordeaux, where he kept abreast\nof scientific developments, and gave papers on topics ranging from the\ncauses of echoes to the motives that should lead us to pursue the\nsciences. \n In 1721 Montesquieu published the Persian Letters, which was\nan instant success and made Montesquieu a literary celebrity. (He\npublished the Persian Letters anonymously, but his authorship\nwas an open secret.) He began to spend more time in Paris, where he\nfrequented salons and acted on behalf of the Parlement and the Academy\nof Bordeaux. During this period he wrote several minor works:\nDialogue de Sylla et d'Eucrate (1724), Réflexions sur\nla Monarchie Universelle (1724), and Le Temple de Gnide\n(1725). In 1725 he sold his life interest in his office and resigned\nfrom the Parlement. In 1728 he was elected to the Académie\nFrançaise, despite some religious opposition, and shortly\nthereafter left France to travel abroad. After visiting Italy,\nGermany, Austria, and other countries, he went to England, where he\nlived for two years. He was greatly impressed with the English\npolitical system, and drew on his observations of it in his later\nwork. \n On his return to France in 1731, troubled by failing eyesight,\nMontesquieu returned to La Brède and began work on his\nmasterpiece, The Spirit of the Laws. During this time he also\nwrote Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans\nand of their Decline, which he published anonymously in 1734. In\nthis book he tried to work out the application of his views to the\nparticular case of Rome, and in so doing to discourage the use of Rome\nas a model for contemporary governments. Parts of\nConsiderations were incorporated into The Spirit of the\nLaws, which he published in 1748. Like the Persian Letters,\nThe Spirit of the Laws was both controversial and immensely\nsuccessful. Two years later he published a Defense of the Spirit of\nthe Laws to answer his various critics. Despite this effort, the\nRoman Catholic Church placed The Spirit of the Laws on the\nIndex of Forbidden Books in 1751. In 1755, Montesquieu died of a fever\nin Paris, leaving behind an unfinished essay on taste for the\nEncyclopédie of Diderot and D'Alembert. \n\nMontesquieu's two most important works are the Persian Letters\nand The Spirit of the Laws. While these works share certain\nthemes -- most notably a fascination with non-European societies and a\nhorror of despotism -- they are quite different from one another, and\nwill be treated separately. \n\nThe Persian Letters is an epistolary novel consisting of\nletters sent to and from two fictional Persians, Usbek and Rica, who\nset out for Europe in 1711 and remain there at least until 1720, when\nthe novel ends. When Montesquieu wrote the Persian Letters,\ntravellers' accounts of their journeys to hitherto unknown parts of\nthe world, and of the peculiar customs they found there, were very\npopular in Europe. While Montesquieu was not the first writer to try\nto imagine how European culture might look to travellers from\nnon-European countries, he used that device with particular\nbrilliance. \n Many of the letters are brief descriptions of scenes or\ncharacters. At first their humor derives mostly from the fact that\nUsbek and Rica misinterpret what they see. Thus, for instance, Rica\nwrites that the Pope is a magician who can \"make the king believe that\nthree are only one, or else that the bread one eats is not bread, or\nthat the wine one drinks is not wine, and a thousand other things of\nthe same kind\" (Letter 24); when Rica goes to the theater, he\nconcludes that the spectators he sees in private boxes are actors\nenacting dramatic tableaux for the entertainment of the audience. In\nlater letters, Usbek and Rica no longer misinterpret what they see;\nhowever, they find the actions of Europeans no less\nincomprehensible. They describe people who are so consumed by vanity\nthat they become ridiculous, scholars whose concern for the minutiae\nof texts blinds them to the world around them, and a scientist who\nnearly freezes to death because lighting a fire in his room would\ninterfere with his attempt to obtain exact measurements of its\ntemperature. \n Interspersed among these descriptive letters are the Persians'\nreflections on what they see. Usbek is particularly given to such\nmusings, and he shares many of Montesquieu's own preoccupations: with\nthe contrast between European and non-European societies, the\nadvantages and disadvantages of different systems of government, the\nnature of political authority, and the proper role of law. He also\nseems to share many of Montesquieu's views. The best government, he\nsays, is that \"which attains its purpose with the least trouble\", and\n\"controls men in the manner best adapted to their inclinations and\ndesires\" (Letter 80). He notes that the French are moved by a love of\nhonor to obey their king, and quotes approvingly the claim that this\n\"makes a Frenchman, willingly and with pleasure, do things that your\nSultan can only get out of his subjects by ceaseless exhortation with\nrewards and punishments\" (Letter 89). While he is vividly aware of the\nimportance of just laws, he regards legal reform as a dangerous task\nto be attempted \"only in fear and trembling\" (Letter 129). He favors\nreligious toleration, and regards attempts to compel religious belief\nas both unwise and inhumane. In these reflections Usbek seems to be a\nthoughtful and enlightened observer with a deep commitment to justice. \n However, one of the great themes of the Persian Letters is the\nvirtual impossibility of self-knowledge, and Usbek is its most fully\nrealized illustration. Usbek has left behind a harem in Persia, in\nwhich his wives are kept prisoner by eunuchs who are among his\nslaves. Both his wives and his slaves can be beaten, mutilated, or\nkilled at his command, as can any outsider unfortunate enough to lay\neyes on them. Usbek is, in other words, a despot in his home. From the\noutset he is tortured by the thought of his wives' infidelity. It is\nnot, he writes, that he loves his wives, but that \"from my very lack\nof feeling has come a secret jealousy which is devouring me\" (Letter\n6). As time goes on problems develop in the seraglio: Usbek's wives\nfeud with each other, and the eunuchs find it increasingly difficult\nto keep order. Eventually discipline breaks down altogether; the Chief\nEunuch reports this to Usbek and then abruptly dies. His replacement\nis clearly obedient not to Usbek but to his wives: he contrives not to\nreceive any of Usbek's letters, and when a young man is found in the\nseraglio he writes: \"I got up, examined the matter, and found that it\nwas a vision\" (Letter 149). Usbek orders another eunuch to restore\norder: \"leave pity and tenderness behind. ... Make my seraglio what it\nwas when I left it; but begin by expiation: exterminate the criminals,\nand strike dread into those who contemplated becoming so. There is\nnothing that you cannot hope to receive from your master for such an\noutstanding service\" (Letter 153). His orders are obeyed, and \"horror,\ndarkness, and dread rule the seraglio\" (Letter 156). Finally, Roxana,\nUsbek's favorite wife and the only one whose virtue he trusted, is\nfound with another man; her lover is killed, and she commits suicide\nafter writing Usbek a scathing letter in which she asks: \"How could\nyou have thought me credulous enough to imagine that I was in the\nworld only in order to worship your caprices? that while you allowed\nyourself everything, you had the right to thwart all my desires? No: I\nmay have lived in servitude, but I have always been free. I have\namended your laws according to the laws of nature, and my mind has\nalways remained independent\" (Letter 161). With this letter the novel\nends. \n The Persian Letters is both one of the funniest books written\nby a major philosopher, and one of the bleakest. It presents both\nvirtue and self-knowledge as almost unattainable. Almost all the\nEuropeans in the Persian Letters are ridiculous; most of those\nwho are not appear only to serve as a mouthpiece for Montesquieu's own\nviews. Rica is amiable and good-natured, but this is largely due to\nthe fact that, since he has no responsibilities, his virtue has never\nbeen seriously tested. For all Usbek's apparent enlightenment and\nhumanity, he turns out to be a monster whose cruelty does not bring\nhim happiness, as he himself recognizes even as he decides to inflict\nit. His eunuchs, unable to hope for either freedom or happiness, learn\nto enjoy tormenting their charges, and his wives, for the most part,\nprofess love while plotting intrigues. The only admirable character in\nthe novel is Roxana, but the social institutions of Persia make her\nlife intolerable: she is separated from the man she loves and forced\nto live in slavery. Her suicide is presented as a noble act, but also\nas an indictment of the despotic institutions that make it necessary. \n\nMontesquieu's aim in The Spirit of the Laws is to explain human\nlaws and social institutions. This might seem like an impossible\nproject: unlike physical laws, which are, according to Montesquieu,\ninstituted and sustained by God, positive laws and social institutions\nare created by fallible human beings who are \"subject ... to ignorance\nand error, [and] hurried away by a thousand impetuous passions\" (SL\n1.1). One might therefore expect our laws and institutions to be no\nmore comprehensible than any other catalog of human follies, an\nexpectation which the extraordinary diversity of laws adopted by\ndifferent societies would seem to confirm. \n Nonetheless, Montesquieu believes that this apparent chaos is much\nmore comprehensible than one might think. On his view, the key to\nunderstanding different laws and social systems is to recognize that\nthey should be adapted to a variety of different factors, and cannot\nbe properly understood unless one considers them in this\nlight. Specifically, laws should be adapted \"to the people for whom\nthey are framed..., to the nature and principle of each government,\n... to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its\nsituation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives,\nwhether husbandmen, huntsmen or shepherds: they should have relation\nto the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the\nreligion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers,\ncommerce, manners, and customs. In fine, they have relations to each\nother, as also to their origin, to the intent of the legislator, and\nto the order of things on which they are established; in all of which\ndifferent lights they ought to be considered\" (SL 1.3). When we\nconsider legal and social systems in relation to these various\nfactors, Montesquieu believes, we will find that many laws and\ninstitutions that had seemed puzzling or even perverse are in fact\nquite comprehensible. \n Understanding why we have the laws we do is important in\nitself. However, it also serves practical purposes. Most importantly,\nit will discourage misguided attempts at reform. Montesquieu is not a\nutopian, either by temperament or conviction. He believes that to live\nunder a stable, non-despotic government that leaves its law-abiding\ncitizens more or less free to live their lives is a great good, and\nthat no such government should be lightly tampered with. If we\nunderstand our system of government, and the ways in which it is\nadapted to the conditions of our country and its people, we will see\nthat many of its apparently irrational features actually make sense,\nand that to 'reform' these features would actually weaken it. Thus,\nfor instance, one might think that a monarchical government would be\nstrengthened by weakening the nobility, thereby giving more power to\nthe monarch. On Montesquieu's view, this is false: to weaken those\ngroups or institutions which check a monarch's power is to risk\ntransforming monarchy into despotism, a form of government that is\nboth abhorrent and unstable. \n Understanding our laws will also help us to see which aspects of them\nare genuinely in need of reform, and how these reforms might be\naccomplished. For instance, Montesquieu believes that the laws of many\ncountries can be made be more liberal and more humane, and that they\ncan often be applied less arbitrarily, with less scope for the\nunpredictable and oppressive use of state power. Likewise, religious\npersecution and slavery can be abolished, and commerce can be\nencouraged. These reforms would generally strengthen monarchical\ngovernments, since they enhance the freedom and dignity of\ncitizens. If lawmakers understand the relations between laws on the\none hand and conditions of their countries and the principles of their\ngovernments on the other, they will be in a better position to carry\nout such reforms without undermining the governments they seek to\nimprove. \n\nMontesquieu holds that there are three types of governments:\nrepublican governments, which can take either democratic or\naristocratic forms; monarchies; and despotisms. Unlike, for instance,\nAristotle, Montesquieu does not distinguish forms of government on the\nbasis of the virtue of the sovereign. The distinction between monarchy\nand despotism, for instance, depends not on the virtue of the monarch,\nbut on whether or not he governs \"by fixed and established laws\" (SL\n2.1). Each form of government has a principle, a set of \"human\npassions which set it in motion\" (SL 3.1); and each can be corrupted\nif its principle is undermined or destroyed. \n In a democracy, the people are sovereign. They may govern through\nministers, or be advised by a senate, but they must have the power of\nchoosing their ministers and senators for themselves. The principle of\ndemocracy is political virtue, by which Montesquieu means \"the love of\nthe laws and of our country\" (SL 4.5), including its democratic\nconstitution. The form of a democratic government makes the laws\ngoverning suffrage and voting fundamental. The need to protect its\nprinciple, however, imposes far more extensive requirements. On\nMontesquieu's view, the virtue required by a functioning democracy is\nnot natural. It requires \"a constant preference of public to private\ninterest\" (SL 4.5); it \"limits ambition to the sole desire, to the\nsole happiness, of doing greater services to our country than the rest\nof our fellow citizens\" (SL 5.3); and it \"is a self-renunciation,\nwhich is ever arduous and painful\" (SL 4.5). Montesquieu compares it\nto monks' love for their order: \"their rule debars them from all those\nthings by which the ordinary passions are fed; there remains therefore\nonly this passion for the very rule that torments them. ... the more\nit curbs their inclinations, the more force it gives to the only\npassion left them\" (SL 5.2). To produce this unnatural\nself-renunciation, \"the whole power of education is required\" (SL\n4.5). A democracy must educate its citizens to identify their\ninterests with the interests of their country, and should have censors\nto preserve its mores. It should seek to establish frugality by law,\nso as to prevent its citizens from being tempted to advance their own\nprivate interests at the expense of the public good; for the same\nreason, the laws by which property is transferred should aim to\npreserve an equal distribution of property among citizens. Its\nterritory should be small, so that it is easy for citizens to identify\nwith it, and more difficult for extensive private interests to\nemerge. \n Democracies can be corrupted in two ways: by what Montesquieu calls\n\"the spirit of inequality\" and \"the spirit of extreme equality\" (SL\n8.2). The spirit of inequality arises when citizens no longer identify\ntheir interests with the interests of their country, and therefore\nseek both to advance their own private interests at the expense of\ntheir fellow citizens, and to acquire political power over them. The\nspirit of extreme equality arises when the people are no longer\ncontent to be equal as citizens, but want to be equal in every\nrespect. In a functioning democracy, the people choose magistrates to\nexercise executive power, and they respect and obey the magistrates\nthey have chosen. If those magistrates forfeit their respect, they\nreplace them. When the spirit of extreme equality takes root, however,\nthe citizens neither respect nor obey any magistrate. They \"want to\nmanage everything themselves, to debate for the senate, to execute for\nthe magistrate, and to decide for the judges\" (SL 8.2). Eventually the\ngovernment will cease to function, the last remnants of virtue will\ndisappear, and democracy will be replaced by despotism. \n In an aristocracy, one part of the people governs the rest. The\nprinciple of an aristocratic government is moderation, the virtue\nwhich leads those who govern in an aristocracy to restrain themselves\nboth from oppressing the people and from trying to acquire excessive\npower over one another. In an aristocracy, the laws should be designed\nto instill and protect this spirit of moderation. To do so, they must\ndo three things. First, the laws must prevent the nobility from\nabusing the people. The power of the nobility makes such abuse a\nstanding temptation in an aristocracy; to avoid it, the laws should\ndeny the nobility some powers, like the power to tax, which would make\nthis temptation all but irresistible, and should try to foster\nresponsible and moderate administration. Second, the laws should\ndisguise as much as possible the difference between the nobility and\nthe people, so that the people feel their lack of power as little as\npossible. Thus the nobility should have modest and simple manners,\nsince if they do not attempt to distinguish themselves from the people\n\"the people are apt to forget their subjection and weakness\" (SL 5.8).\nFinally, the laws should try to ensure equality among the nobles\nthemselves, and among noble families. When they fail to do so, the\nnobility will lose its spirit of moderation, and the government will\nbe corrupted. \n In a monarchy, one person governs \"by fixed and established laws\"\n(SL 2.1). According to Montesquieu, these laws \"necessarily suppose the\nintermediate channels through which (the monarch's) power flows: for\nif there be only the momentary and capricious will of a single person\nto govern the state, nothing can be fixed, and, of course, there is no\nfundamental law\" (SL 2.4). These 'intermediate channels' are such\nsubordinate institutions as the nobility and an independent judiciary;\nand the laws of a monarchy should therefore be designed to preserve\ntheir power. The principle of monarchical government is honor. Unlike\nthe virtue required by republican governments, the desire to win honor\nand distinction comes naturally to us. For this reason education has a\nless difficult task in a monarchy than in a republic: it need only\nheighten our ambitions and our sense of our own worth, provide us with\nan ideal of honor worth aspiring to, and cultivate in us the\npoliteness needed to live with others whose sense of their worth\nmatches our own. The chief task of the laws in a monarchy is to\nprotect the subordinate institutions that distinguish monarchy from\ndespotism. To this end, they should make it easy to preserve large\nestates undivided, protect the rights and privileges of the nobility,\nand promote the rule of law. They should also encourage the\nproliferation of distinctions and of rewards for honorable conduct,\nincluding luxuries.  \n A monarchy is corrupted when the monarch either destroys the\nsubordinate institutions that constrain his will, or decides to rule\narbitrarily, without regard to the basic laws of his country, or\ndebases the honors at which his citizens might aim, so that \"men are\ncapable of being loaded at the very same time with infamy and with\ndignities\" (SL 8.7). The first two forms of corruption destroy the\nchecks on the sovereign's will that separate monarchy from despotism;\nthe third severs the connection between honorable conduct and its\nproper rewards. In a functioning monarchy, personal ambition and a\nsense of honor work together. This is monarchy's great strength and\nthe source of its extraordinary stability: whether its citizens act\nfrom genuine virtue, a sense of their own worth, a desire to serve\ntheir king, or personal ambition, they will be led to act in ways that\nserve their country. A monarch who rules arbitrarily, or who rewards\nservility and ignoble conduct instead of genuine honor, severs this\nconnection and corrupts his government. \n In despotic states \"a single person directs everything by his own\nwill and caprice\" (SL 2.1). Without laws to check him, and with no\nneed to attend to anyone who does not agree with him, a despot can do\nwhatever he likes, however ill-advised or reprehensible. His subjects\nare no better than slaves, and he can dispose of them as he sees\nfit. The principle of despotism is fear. This fear is easily\nmaintained, since the situation of a despot's subjects is genuinely\nterrifying. Education is unnecessary in a despotism; if it exists at\nall, it should be designed to debase the mind and break the\nspirit. Such ideas as honor and virtue should not occur to a despot's\nsubjects, since \"persons capable of setting a value on themselves\nwould be likely to create disturbances. Fear must therefore depress\ntheir spirits, and extinguish even the least sense of ambition\" (SL\n3.9). Their \"portion here, like that of beasts, is instinct,\ncompliance, and punishment\" (SL 3.10), and any higher aspirations\nshould be brutally discouraged. \n Montesquieu writes that \"the principle of despotic government is\nsubject to a continual corruption, because it is even in its nature\ncorrupt\" (SL 8.10). This is true in several senses. First, despotic\ngovernments undermine themselves. Because property is not secure in a\ndespotic state, commerce will not flourish, and the state will be\npoor. The people must be kept in a state of fear by the threat of\npunishment; however, over time the punishments needed to keep them in\nline will tend to become more and more severe, until further threats\nlose their force. Most importantly, however, the despot's character is\nlikely to prevent him from ruling effectively. Since a despot's every\nwhim is granted, he \"has no occasion to deliberate, to doubt, to\nreason; he has only to will\" (SL 4.3). For this reason he is never\nforced to develop anything like intelligence, character, or\nresolution. Instead, he is \"naturally lazy, voluptuous, and ignorant\"\n(SL 2.5), and has no interest in actually governing his people. He\nwill therefore choose a vizier to govern for him, and retire to his\nseraglio to pursue pleasure. In his absence, however, intrigues\nagainst him will multiply, especially since his rule is necessarily\nodious to his subjects, and since they have so little to lose if their\nplots against him fail. He cannot rely on his army to protect him,\nsince the more power they have, the greater the likelihood that his\ngenerals will themselves try to seize power. For this reason the ruler\nin a despotic state has no more security than his people. \n Second, monarchical and republican governments involve specific\ngovernmental structures, and require that their citizens have specific\nsorts of motivation. When these structures crumble, or these\nmotivations fail, monarchical and republican governments are\ncorrupted, and the result of their corruption is that they fall into\ndespotism. But when a particular despotic government falls, it is not\ngenerally replaced by a monarchy or a republic. The creation of a\nstable monarchy or republic is extremely difficult: \"a masterpiece of\nlegislation, rarely produced by hazard, and seldom attained by\nprudence\" (SL 5.14). It is particularly difficult when those who would\nhave both to frame the laws of such a government and to live by them\nhave previously been brutalized and degraded by despotism. Producing a\ndespotic government, by contrast, is relatively straightforward. A\ndespotism requires no powers to be carefully balanced against one\nanother, no institutions to be created and maintained in existence, no\ncomplicated motivations to be fostered, and no restraints on power to\nbe kept in place. One need only terrify one's fellow citizens enough\nto allow one to impose one's will on them; and this, Montesquieu\nclaims, \"is what every capacity may reach\" (SL 5.14). For these\nreasons despotism necessarily stands in a different relation to\ncorruption than other forms of government: while they are liable to\ncorruption, despotism is its embodiment. \n\nMontesquieu is among the greatest philosophers of liberalism, but his\nis what Shklar has called \"a liberalism of fear\" (Shklar,\nMontesquieu, p. 89). According to Montesquieu, political\nliberty is \"a tranquillity of mind arising from the opinion each\nperson has of his safety\" (SL 11.6). Liberty is not the freedom to do\nwhatever we want: if we have the freedom to harm others, for instance,\nothers will also have the freedom to harm us, and we will have no\nconfidence in our own safety. Liberty involves living under laws that\nprotect us from harm while leaving us free to do as much as possible,\nand that enable us to feel the greatest possible confidence that if we\nobey those laws, the power of the state will not be directed against\nus. \n If it is to provide its citizens with the greatest possible liberty,\na government must have certain features. First, since \"constant\nexperience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse\nit ... it is necessary from the very nature of things that power\nshould be a check to power\" (SL 11.4). This is achieved through the\nseparation of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers of\ngovernment. If different persons or bodies exercise these powers, then\neach can check the others if they try to abuse their powers. But if\none person or body holds several or all of these powers, then nothing\nprevents that person or body from acting tyrannically; and the people\nwill have no confidence in their own security. \n Certain arrangements make it easier for the three powers to check one\nanother. Montesquieu argues that the legislative power alone should\nhave the power to tax, since it can then deprive the executive of\nfunding if the latter attempts to impose its will\narbitrarily. Likewise, the executive power should have the right to\nveto acts of the legislature, and the legislature should be composed\nof two houses, each of which can prevent acts of the other from\nbecoming law. The judiciary should be independent of both the\nlegislature and the executive, and should restrict itself to applying\nthe laws to particular cases in a fixed and consistent manner, so that\n\"the judicial power, so terrible to mankind, … becomes, as it were,\ninvisible\", and people \"fear the office, but not the magistrate\" (SL\n11.6). \n Liberty also requires that the laws concern only threats to public\norder and security, since such laws will protect us from harm while\nleaving us free to do as many other things as possible. Thus, for\ninstance, the laws should not concern offenses against God, since He\ndoes not require their protection. They should not prohibit what they\ndo not need to prohibit: \"all punishment which is not derived from\nnecessity is tyrannical. The law is not a mere act of power; things in\ntheir own nature indifferent are not within its province\" (SL 19.14).\nThe laws should be constructed to make it as easy as possible for\ncitizens to protect themselves from punishment by not committing\ncrimes. They should not be vague, since if they were, we might never\nbe sure whether or not some particular action was a crime. Nor should\nthey prohibit things we might do inadvertently, like bumping into a\nstatue of the emperor, or involuntarily, like doubting the wisdom of\none of his decrees; if such actions were crimes, no amount of effort\nto abide by the laws of our country would justify confidence that we\nwould succeed, and therefore we could never feel safe from criminal\nprosecution. Finally, the laws should make it as easy as possible for\nan innocent person to prove his or her innocence. They should concern\noutward conduct, not (for instance) our thoughts and dreams, since\nwhile we can try to prove that we did not perform some action, we\ncannot prove that we never had some thought. The laws should not\ncriminalize conduct that is inherently hard to prove, like witchcraft;\nand lawmakers should be cautious when dealing with crimes like sodomy,\nwhich are typically not carried out in the presence of several\nwitnesses, lest they \"open a very wide door to calumny\" (SL 12.6). \n Montesquieu's emphasis on the connection between liberty and the\ndetails of the criminal law were unusual among his contemporaries, and\ninspired such later legal reformers as Cesare Beccaria. \n\nMontequieu believes that climate and geography affect the temperaments\nand customs of a country's inhabitants. He is not a determinist, and\ndoes not believe that these influences are irresistible. Nonetheless,\nhe believes that the laws should take these effects into account,\naccommodating them when necessary, and counteracting their worst\neffects. \n According to Montesquieu, a cold climate constricts our bodies'\nfibers, and causes coarser juices to flow through them. Heat, by\ncontrast, expands our fibers, and produces more rarefied juices. These\nphysiological changes affect our characters. Those who live in cold\nclimates are vigorous and bold, phlegmatic, frank, and not given to\nsuspicion or cunning. They are relatively insensitive to pleasure and\npain; Montesquieu writes that \"you must flay a Muscovite alive to make\nhim feel\" (SL 14.2). Those who live in warm climates have stronger but\nless durable sensations. They are more fearful, more amorous, and more\nsusceptible both to the temptations of pleasure and to real or\nimagined pain; but they are less resolute, and less capable of\nsustained or decisive action. The manners of those who live in\ntemperate climates are \"inconstant\", since \"the climate has not a\nquality determinate enough to fix them\" (SL 14.2). These differences\nare not hereditary: if one moves from one sort of climate to another,\none's temperament will alter accordingly. \n A hot climate can make slavery comprehensible. Montesquieu writes\nthat \"the state of slavery is in its own nature bad\" (SL 15.1); he is\nparticularly contemptuous of religious and racist justifications for\nslavery. However, on his view, there are two types of country in which\nslavery, while not acceptable, is less bad than it might otherwise\nbe. In despotic countries, the situation of slaves is not that\ndifferent from the situation of the despot's other subjects; for this\nreason, slavery in a despotic country is \"more tolerable\" (SL 15.1) than\nin other countries. In unusually hot countries, it might be that \"the\nexcess of heat enervates the body, and renders men so slothful and\ndispirited that nothing but the fear of chastisement can oblige them\nto perform any laborious duty: slavery is there more reconcilable to\nreason\" (SL 15.7). However, Montesquieu writes that when work can be\ndone by freemen motivated by the hope of gain rather than by slaves\nmotivated by fear, the former will always work better; and that in\nsuch climates slavery is not only wrong but imprudent. He hopes that\n\"there is not that climate upon earth where the most laborious\nservices might not with proper encouragement be performed by freemen\"\n(SL 15.8); if there is no such climate, then slavery could never be\njustified on these grounds. \n The quality of a country's soil also affects the form of its\ngovernment. Monarchies are more common where the soil is fertile, and\nrepublics where it is barren. This is so for three reasons. First,\nthose who live in fruitful countries are more apt to be content with\ntheir situation, and to value in a government not the liberty it\nbestows but its ability to provide them with enough security that they\ncan get on with their farming. They are therefore more willing to\naccept a monarchy if it can provide such security. Often it can, since\nmonarchies can respond to threats more quickly than republics. Second,\nfertile countries are both more desirable than barren countries and\neasier to conquer: they \"are always of a level surface, where the\ninhabitants are unable to dispute against a stronger power; they are\nthen obliged to submit; and when they have once submitted, the spirit\nof liberty cannot return; the wealth of the country is a pledge of\ntheir fidelity\" (SL 18.2). Montesquieu believes that monarchies are\nmuch more likely than republics to wage wars of conquest, and\ntherefore that a conquering power is likely to be a monarchy. Third,\nthose who live where the soil is barren have to work hard in order to\nsurvive; this tends to make them \"industrious, sober, inured to\nhardship, courageous, and fit for war\" (SL 18.4). Those who inhabit\nfertile country, by contrast, favor \"ease, effeminacy, and a certain\nfondness for the preservation of life\" (SL 18.4). For this reason, the\ninhabitants of barren countries are better able to defend themselves\nfrom such attacks as might occur, and to defend their liberty against\nthose who would destroy it. \n These facts give barren countries advantages that compensate for the\ninfertility of their soil. Since they are less likely to be invaded,\nthey are less likely to be sacked and devastated; and they are more\nlikely to be worked well, since \"countries are not cultivated in\nproportion to their fertility, but to their liberty\" (SL 18.3). This\nis why \"the best provinces are most frequently depopulated, while the\nfrightful countries of the North continue always inhabited, from their\nbeing almost uninhabitable\" (SL 18.3). \n Montesquieu believes that the climate and geography of Asia explain\nwhy despotism flourishes there. Asia, he thinks, has two features that\ndistinguish it from Europe. First, Asia has virtually no temperate\nzone. While the mountains of Scandinavia shelter Europe from arctic\nwinds, Asia has no such buffer; for this reason its frigid northern\nzone extends much further south than in Europe, and there is a\nrelatively quick transition from it to the tropical south. For this\nreason \"the warlike, brave, and active people touch immediately upon\nthose who are indolent, effeminate and timorous; the one must,\ntherefore, conquer, and the other be conquered\" (SL 17.3). In Europe,\nby contrast, the climate changes gradually from cold to hot; therefore\n\"strong nations are opposed to the strong; and those who join each\nother have nearly the same courage\" (SL 17.3). Second, Asia has larger\nplains than Europe. Its mountain ranges lie further apart, and its\nrivers are not such formidable barriers to invasion. Since Europe is\nnaturally divided into smaller regions, it is more difficult for any\none power to conquer them all; this means that Europe will tend to\nhave more and smaller states. Asia, by contrast, tends to have much\nlarger empires, which predisposes it to despotism. \n\nOf all the ways in which a country might seek to enrich itself,\nMontesquieu believes, commerce is the only one without overwhelming\ndrawbacks. Conquering and plundering one's neighbors can provide\ntemporary infusions of money, but over time the costs of maintaining\nan occupying army and administering subjugated peoples impose strains\nthat few countries can endure. Extracting precious metals from\ncolonial mines leads to general inflation; thus the costs of\nextraction increase while the value of the extracted metals\ndecreases. The increased availability of money furthers the\ndevelopment of commerce in other countries; however, in the country\nwhich extracts gold and silver, domestic industry is destroyed. \n Commerce, by contrast, has no such disadvantages. It does not require\nvast armies, or the continued subjugation of other peoples. It does\nnot undermine itself, as the extraction of gold from colonial mines\ndoes, and it rewards domestic industry. It therefore sustains itself,\nand nations which engage in it, over time. While it does not produce\nall the virtues -- hospitality, Montesquieu thinks, is more often\nfound among the poor than among commercial peoples -- it does produce\nsome: \"the spirit of commerce is naturally attended with that of\nfrugality, economy, moderation, labor, prudence, tranquility, order,\nand rule\" (SL 5.6). In addition, it \"is a cure for the most\ndestructive prejudices\" (SL 20.1), improves manners, and leads to\npeace among nations. \n In monarchies, Montesquieu believes, the aim of commerce is, for the\nmost part, to supply luxuries. In republics, it is to bring from one\ncountry what is wanted in another, \"gaining little\" but \"gaining\nincessantly\" (SL 20.4). In despotisms, there is very little commerce\nof any kind, since there is no security of property. In a monarchy,\nneither kings nor nobles should engage in commerce, since this would\nrisk concentrating too much power in their hands. By the same token,\nthere should be no banks in a monarchy, since a treasure \"no sooner\nbecomes great than it becomes the treasure of the prince\" (SL 20.10).\nIn republics, by contrast, banks are extremely useful, and anyone\nshould be allowed to engage in trade. Restrictions on which profession\na person can follow destroy people's hopes of bettering their\nsituation; they are therefore appropriate only to despotic states. \n While some mercantilists had argued that commerce is a zero-sum game\nin which when some gain, others necessarily lose, Montesquieu believes\nthat commerce benefits all countries except those who have nothing but\ntheir land and what it produces. In those deeply impoverished\ncountries, commerce with other countries will encourage those who own\nthe land to oppress those who work it, rather than encouraging the\ndevelopment of domestic industries and manufacture. However, all other\ncountries benefit by commerce, and should seek to trade with as many\nother nations as possible, \"for it is competition which sets a just\nvalue on merchandise, and establishes the relation between them\" (SL\n20.9). \n Montesquieu describes commerce as an activity that cannot be confined\nor controlled by any individual government or monarch. This, in his\nview, has always been true: \"Commerce is sometimes destroyed by\nconquerors, sometimes cramped by monarchs; it traverses the earth,\nflies from the places where it is oppressed, and stays where it has\nliberty to breathe\" (SL 21.5). However, the independence of commerce\nwas greatly enhanced when, during the medieval period, Jews responded\nto persecution and the seizure of their property by inventing letters\nof exchange. \"Commerce, by this method, became capable of eluding\nviolence, and of maintaining everywhere its ground; the richest\nmerchant having none but invisible effects, which he could convey\nimperceptibly wherever he pleased\" (SL 21.20). This set in motion\ndevelopments which made commerce still more independent of monarchs\nand their whims. \n First, it facilitated the development of international markets, which\nplace prices outside the control of governments. Money, according to\nMontesquieu, is \"a sign which represents the value of all\nmerchandise\" (SL 22.2). The price of merchandise depends on the\nquantity of money and the quantity of merchandise, and on the amounts\nof money and merchandise that are in trade. Monarchs can affect this\nprice by imposing tariffs or duties on certain goods. But since they\ncannot control the amounts of money and merchandise that are in trade\nwithin their own countries, let alone internationally, a monarch \"can\nno more fix the price of merchandise than he can establish by a decree\nthat the relation 1 has to 10 is equal to that of 1 to 20\" (SL 22.7).\nIf a monarch attempts to do so, he courts disaster: \"Julian's lowering\nthe price of provisions at Antioch was the cause of a most terrible\nfamine\" (SL 22.7). \n Second, it permitted the development of international currency\nexchanges, which place the exchange rate of a country's currency\nlargely outside the control of that country's government. A monarch\ncan establish a currency, and stipulate how much of some metal each\nunit of that currency shall contain. However, monarchs cannot control\nthe rates of exchange between their currencies and those of other\ncountries. These rates depend on the relative scarcity of money in the\ncountries in question, and they are \"fixed by the general opinion of\nthe merchants, never by the decrees of the prince\" (SL 22.10). For\nthis reason \"the exchange of all places constantly tends to a certain\nproportion, and that in the very nature of things\" (SL 22.10). \n Finally, the development of international commerce gives governments\na great incentive to adopt policies that favor, or at least do not\nimpede, its development. Governments need to maintain confidence in\ntheir creditworthiness if they wish to borrow money; this deters them\nfrom at least the more extreme forms of fiscal irresponsibility, and\nfrom oppressing too greatly those citizens from whom they might later\nneed to borrow money. Since the development of commerce requires the\navailability of loans, governments must establish interest rates high\nenough to encourage lending, but not so high as to make borrowing\nunprofitable. Taxes must not be so high that they deprive citizens of\nthe hope of bettering their situations (SL 13.2), and the laws should\nallow those citizens enough freedom to carry out commercial affairs. \n In general, Montesquieu believes that commerce has had an extremely\nbeneficial influence on government. Since commerce began to recover\nafter the development of letters of exchange and the reintroduction of\nlending at interest, he writes: \n\nReligion plays only a minor part in the Spirit of the Laws. God\nis described in Book 1 as creating nature and its laws; having done\nso, He vanishes, and plays no further explanatory role. In particular,\nMontesquieu does not explain the laws of any country by appeal to\ndivine enlightenment, providence, or guidance. In the Spirit of the\nLaws, Montesquieu considers religions \"in relation only to the\ngood they produce in civil society\" (SL 24.1), and not to their truth\nor falsity. He regards different religions as appropriate to different\nenvironments and forms of government. Protestantism is most suitable\nto republics, Catholicism to monarchies, and Islam to despotisms; the\nIslamic prohibition on eating pork is appropriate to Arabia, where hogs\nare scarce and contribute to disease, while in India, where cattle are\nbadly needed but do not thrive, a prohibition on eating beef is\nsuitable. Thus, \"when Montezuma with so much obstinacy insisted that\nthe religion of the Spaniards was good for their country, and his for\nMexico, he did not assert an absurdity\" (SL 24.24). \n Religion can help to ameliorate the effects of bad laws and\ninstitutions; it is the only thing capable of serving as a check on\ndespotic power. However, on Montesquieu's view it is generally a\nmistake to base civil laws on religious principles. Religion aims at\nthe perfection of the individual; civil laws aim at the welfare of\nsociety. Given these different aims, what these two sets of laws\nshould require will often differ; for this reason religion \"ought not\nalways to serve as a first principle to the civil laws\" (SL 26.9). The\ncivil laws are not an appropriate tool for enforcing religious norms\nof conduct: God has His own laws, and He is quite capable of enforcing\nthem without our assistance. When we attempt to enforce God's laws for\nHim, or to cast ourselves as His protectors, we make our religion an\ninstrument of fanaticism and oppression; this is a service neither to\nGod nor to our country. \n If several religions have gained adherents in a country, those\nreligions should all be tolerated, not only by the state but by its\ncitizens. The laws should \"require from the several religions, not\nonly that they shall not embroil the state, but that they shall not\nraise disturbances among themselves\" (SL 25.9). While one can try to\npersuade people to change religions by offering them positive\ninducements to do so, attempts to force others to convert are\nineffective and inhumane. In an unusually scathing passage,\nMontesquieu also argues that they are unworthy of Christianity, and\nwrites: \"if anyone in times to come shall dare to assert, that in the\nage in which we live, the people of Europe were civilized, you (the\nInquisition) will be cited to prove that they were barbarians; and the\nidea they will have of you will be such as will dishonor your age, and\nspread hatred over all your contemporaries\" (SL 25.13).","contact.mail":"hbok@jhu.edu","contact.domain":"jhu.edu"}]
