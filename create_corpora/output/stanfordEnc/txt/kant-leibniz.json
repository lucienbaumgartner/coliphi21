Leibniz is evident in his writings in\nthe philosophy of natural science as well as in the passages of the\nCritique of Pure Reason dealing with transcendental\nideas. The conventional view that Kant sought to steer a middle course\nbetween the rationalism of 18th century German school\nphilosophy initiated by Leibniz’s follower Christian Wolff and the\nempiricism of David Hume furnishes a useful point of departure for\nunderstanding Kant’s intellectual context and his aims and intentions.\nHowever, Kant’s aim in propounding his critical philosophy was not\nmerely to transcend the stalemate of dogmatism vs. skepticism in\ngeneral epistemology, but to address what he regarded as a crisis: the\ninability of metaphysics, as taught in the Universities, to secure the\nmeta-ethical objectivity of morality and the threat to human\nconfidence and moral discipline posed by the atheism, materialism, and\nfatalism of contemporary forms of naturalism. Kant took Leibniz’s as a\nfailed dogmatic enterprise in metaphysics and philosophical theology,\nbut as one that was partially redeemed by its parallel treatment of\nnature and value. He addressed the Leibnizian topics of the nature of\nsubstance, the human soul and its powers, space, time, and forces,\nmechanism and teleology, and divine creation in passages scattered\nthroughout his major and minor writings.\n\n\n\nThe main features of Kant’s reception of Leibniz are surveyed below\nunder separate headings.\n\n\n\nKant’s references to Leibniz, though sporadic, reveal an ongoing\ninterest in Leibnizian problems and concepts. At one time or another,\nKant addressed all of Leibniz’s main doctrines, including his defense\nof living forces against the Cartesians, his attack on absolute space\nand time against the Newtonians, his immaterial atomism or monadology,\nhis theodicy, and his various principles and laws — the identity\nof indiscernibles, continuity, non-contradiction and sufficient reason.\nThe challenging tone towards the followers of Leibniz that the young\nKant, as an aspiring physicist and cosmologist, adopted gave way in\ntime to respectful engagement with the philosopher himself, as Kant\nbecame an increasingly determined critic of materialism. \n\nYet Kant’s attitude towards his famous predecessor, whose ideas were\nextensively discussed in French, and later in Prussian intellectual\ncircles after Leibniz’s death in 1716, never reaches equilibrium. This\nis unsurprising, for Kant’s own texts show an attraction to\nteleological theories of the whole, as well as to \nepistemological caution. Kant\ndescribes Leibniz as one of the greatest and most successful reformers\nof the modern era (9:32), along with John Locke, and as a genius,\nalong with Isaac Newton (7.226). Yet he also refers repeatedly to the\nerrors of the Leibnizians, whom he considers “dogmatic”\nphilosophers. Their conviction that human reason could acquire\nknowledge of supersensible entities, including the soul and God,\nnecessitated, in Kant’s view, a “critique.” Locke had\nattempted to construct a critical philosophy against the Cartesians\nbut had failed to carry his programme through. Kant noted the\npeculiarity of Locke’s suggesting that, after deriving all concepts\nfrom experience and reflection on experience, he could demonstrate the\nexistence of God and the immortality of the soul, matters lying well\nbeyond all experience (KRV A 854f/B 882f). An even more conspicuous\nfailure in Kant’s eyes was perhaps Locke’s account of moral motivation\nas located in a pleasure principle and God’s power to punish and\nreward. “So much there was deceptive, that it is necessary to\nsuspend the whole enterprise and to bring instead the method of the\ncritical philosophy into play. This consists of examining the process\nof reason itself, of dividing and testing the human knowledge capacity\nin order to determine how far out its boundaries may be placed”\n(9.32). \n\nThe suspension of the whole enterprise announced by Kant should not\nobscure the fact that Leibniz and Kant shared an ethico-religious\nconception of philosophy. Leibniz wrote in an era in which the\nuniversities were still dominated by Christian philosophy. Whatever\nhis private leanings towards mystical and philosophical religion, he\nbelieved that a strong and unified religious authority was essential\nto the maintenance of moral and political order, and the content of\nmorality did not strike him as problematic. Kant, though steeped in\nProtestant theology and moral philosophy, favoured the newer trend\ntowards the academic autonomy of philosophy and secular morality and\ngovernance. Yet, as a moral rigorist, he had to contend with the rising influence of materialism in Germany (10:145); the skepticism and conventionalism voiced by Locke and David Hume and the\nattacks on metaphysics and conventional morals of Helvetius, La Mettrie (19:109), Voltaire (15:336)and possibly the widely read Baron Holbach. How could morality be reconciled with\nNewtonian science and how could the existence of ineluctable duties be\nestablished in the face of the variety of human practices and customs established by Montesquieu and the numerous travel writers on whose accounts Kant relied in compiling his lectures on Anthropology? Leibniz, he noted, was at least not contradictory in the way Locke had\nbeen; he denied that knowledge was limited by our experience. For\nKant, however, metaphysics could not provide knowledge of the\nsupersensible, including the existence of God, the possibility of the\nrealization of a highest good in the natural world, or the ability of\nhuman beings to realize that good through their endowments. Human\naspirations in this regard were transcendent, futile, and\n“entirely vacuous” (20: 301). \nFor Leibniz, the Kingdom of Nature and the Kingdom of Grace were parallel orders. Everything in nature happened, as Hobbes and Spinoza maintained, on account of ‘mechanical’ principles. At the same time, Leibniz insisted in his Principles of Nature and Grace based on Reason (1714): \nReferencing Leibniz, Kant adapted this dualistic scheme into his own\nscheme of transcendental ideas. In nature, everything happened\nmechanically (though with mechanism potentially embracing a somewhat\nricher ontology of forces than Leibniz had allowed for.)  Human beings,\nthough not other spirits – for Kant disdained the notion of\nincorporeal spirits – formed a moral community (see Guyer). \nIn this community, reward for having lived a morally worthy\nlife in the form of everlasting\nhappiness was intrinsically deserved, but this could only be hoped for and kept in view, not proved\n(KRV A810-18/B841-46).  \nKant denied that the present world contained as much goodness and\nhappiness as possible. Rather, it was definitely progressing towards\ngreater cultural development, and perhaps moral development.  Hope and\neffort, especially in the latter struggle where they were most needed,\nwas itself morally mandated (8:8-32).  So the ‘idea of a moral\nworld’ had ‘objective reality’ as a ‘corpus\nmysticum of the rational beings in it’ even if it was only the\nsensible world viewed in a different but obligatory way.  \nThe dogmatic metaphysicians preceding him, Kant argued,\nimagined that they could demonstrate the truth of their doctrines in\nrigorous mathematical fashion, but metaphysical concepts lacked the\nprecision and intelligibility of mathematical concepts. At the same\ntime, they put their trust in intellectual intuition, which was no more\ncertain than the visionary and mystical writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg,\nwho had set down his hallucinations and angelic dictations in twelve\nvolumes of the Arcana Coelestia (1749–56), which Kant read in\n1765 and satirized in his Dreams of a Spirit Seer in 1766.\nLeibniz’s monadology exemplified both errors, for Leibniz thought that,\nmerely by rationally considering the problem of the divisibility of\nmatter, he could conclusively demonstrate that the basic constituents\nof the universe were living or at least minded beings with perception and appetite. At the same time,\nthe details of his picture of the world behind the appearances,\nincorporating slumbering monads, confused omniscience, and the\npre-established harmony, seemed to Kant gratuitous fancies. \n\nWhere Leibniz rescued ethics and religion by claiming to discover a\nhidden reality of immortal, spontaneous souls forming a Kingdom of Grace beneath the material and\ncausally-determined appearances, Kant believed he could accomplish the\ntask of reconciling the scientific view of the world with moral\naspiration and accountability by investigating the necessary\npreconditions of our experience. Necessary forms of thought such as\nspace, time, causality and objecthood would thereby be distinguished from\nconstraints embedded in reality. Though\nmaterialism is commonly associated with French Enlightenment figures, Kant considered it an English vice. He associated it not however with Hobbes and Locke but with Joseph Priestley (KRV B 773; 4:258), and he was most certainly aware of its German development through Ernst Platner and others (see Rumore). Determinism and materialism seemed to support a\nlax moral philosophy, in which pleasure was conceived as the summum\nbonum, morality was conventional, and humans were anyway machines\ndevoid of responsibility for their actions. In those not given to\ndissipation, skepticism and empiricism led, Kant thought, to a sense of\nmoral futility, misanthropy and despair. Kant was determined to attack\nfashionable, pessimistic, and libertine philosophies, but he had to\nshow that he rejected rationalist demonstration as thoroughly as any\nempiricist. \n\nHis manner of doing so was exceedingly elegant. Kant did not merely\nchallenge the logic of, or poke fun at the extravagances of Leibniz’s\nmetaphysics, though he is not above a joke regarding the monads —\npotential human lives — he might be swallowing with his morning\ncoffee (2:327). In the antinomies section of the Critique of Pure\nReason, he shows that, for every “proof” of an\nimportant metaphysical proposition, such as determinism, atomism, or\nthe eternity of the universe, a proof of the contrary proposition, such\nas the existence of exceptions to mechanical causality, infinite\ndivisibility, or the temporal finitude of the world can be supplied. By\nattempting to prove too much, human rationality accomplished too\nlittle. Traditional metaphysics left reason perturbed, confused, and\nunfulfilled. \n\nAs many of Leibniz’s writings were not published until the\n19th or 20th century, an accurate assessment of\nthe relation between the Leibniz and Kant can take into account only\nthose works in circulation in the second half of the 18th\ncentury and available to Kant, his teachers and his interlocutors.\nThese comprised the Meditations on Knowledge, Truth and Ideas,\nthe New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances,\nthe Specimen Dynamicum, the Theodicy, the\nMonadology and the Principles of Nature and Grace,\nthe Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, and the posthumous New\nEssays, which Kant read four years after their publication, in\n1769. A collection of diverse pieces, edited by Pierre Desmaizeaux was\npublished in 1720; followed by the more comprehensive Oeuvres\nphilosophiques edited by Raspé in 1765 , and the Opera\nOmnia issued by Dutens in 1768. Wolff, who may have had privileged\naccess to some of Leibniz’s unpublished writings, wrote a series of\ntextbooks under the title Vernunftige Gedancken beginning in\n1719, reformulating Leibniz’s scattered thoughts on atomism,\ndeterminism, pre-established harmony, and theodicy into scholastic\nformat, that served to bring these doctrines into prominence, as did\nsome writings of Alexander Baumgarten and G.F. Meier, and Euler’s\nLetters to a German Princess (1768–1772), which deals\ncritically but cursorily with Leibnizian themes, including idealism,\nsoul-body relations, and the problem of evil. If Kant brooded on\nLeibnizian topics, however, it was not, except perhaps in the period of\nthe controversy with J.A. Eberhard, in which Kant was concerned to\ndistinguish Leibniz from his followers and to champion what he saw as\nLeibniz’s special Platonic contributions, with an eye to understanding\nLeibniz’s system as a whole or extracting the best possible\ninterpretation from it, but rather with an eye to avoiding his\nerrors. \n\nInsofar as Kant professed embarrassment about his pre-1770 essays,\nit might be tempting to divide his discussion of Leibniz into a\npre-critical (before 1770) and a critical phase. Yet this division is\nnot specially illuminating, and recent scholars have questioned the\nformerly standard periodization (see the entry on \n Kant’s philosophical development).\nThe True Measurement of Living Forces, (1747),\nthe Physical Monadology (1756), New Elucidation\n(1755), the Essay on some Treatments of Optimism\n(1759), Negative Quantities (1763) and the Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer (1766) are all technically\n“pre-critical,” but they are critical with respect to\nlogical, physical, and theological Leibnizian principles and\ndoctrines. It is plausible to see the “silent decade”\nbetween 1771 and 1780 as the interval in which Kant decided how to\nmanage the skeptical problem he now saw as threatening morality,\narriving finally at the positive philosophy in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1781) which steers (perhaps only\ntemporarily, judging by the Opus Postumum) a middle course\nbetween visionary and mystical enthusiasm and skepticism. Kant’s\nfurther thoughts on Leibniz were developed in the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786), the polemical essays,\nOn a Discovery According to which any Critique of Pure Reason has\nbeen made Superfluous by an Earlier One (1790) and What\nProgress has Metaphysics Made in Germany since the Time of Leibniz and\nWolff?(1791), and in the Critique of Judgement\n(1790). \n\nLeibniz gives various formulations to his Principle of Contradiction\nor Law of Identity but the central idea is that a proposition and its\nnegation cannot both be true (G 7: 299). Leibniz hoped to be able to\nconstruct a logical calculus that would enable all significant truths\nto be demonstrated, since every concept must include, be included in,\nor exclude every other. A concept such as ‘human,’ he maintained, included the concepts ‘animal,’ ‘rational,’ ‘bipedal,’ etc., so that a true statement such as ‘Humans are animals’ was true in virtue of the inclusion of the predicate in the subject. Though the magnitude of Leibniz’s contribution\nto combinatorial mathematics and logic remained unknown until the\ntwentieth century, Kant offers some skeptical remarks to what he takes\nto be the Leibnizian programme in Section II of the New\nElucidation. Later, he offers two specific criticisms of the\nPrinciple of Contradiction taken not in a logical, but in an\nontological sense: \n\nFirst, Kant claims, the Principle is too weak to ban nonentities\nfrom theories. In Sect 28 of the Inaugural Dissertation\n(1770), he complains of “fictitious forces fabricated at will,\nwhich, not finding any obstacle in the principle of contradiction are\npoured forth in multitudes by those of speculative mind.” These\nfictitious forces presumably included extrasensory powers of perception\nand the direct action of souls on souls. Second, the Principle of\nContradiction is too strong. Leibniz’s Neoplatonic leanings induce him\nto see creatures as fragments of the divine, whose imperfections are\nmere lacks. There are, in his ontology, no beings or forces opposing\nGod (Theodicy, §20). Kant’s orientation is more\nManichaean; he thinks that acceptance of the Principle leads the\ntheorist to underrepresent the extent of conflict in the world and its\nconstructive aspects. Kant insists that opposing forces,\n“hindering and counteracting processes” operate ceaselessly\nin nature and in history. The opposition of attractive and repulsive\nforces in physics produces the phenomena of matter (4: 508 ff); the\nopposition of good and evil principles in the human soul produces\nmorality, (6:1–190); and antagonism and conflict in geopolitics\nproduce peace and progress (6:24). Kant denies the Leibnizian claim\nthat all evil follows from the limitations of creatures (KRV A 273/B.\n329). \n\nThe Leibnizian principle that “there are never two things in\nnature which are exactly alike and in which it is impossible to find a\ndifference that is internal or founded on an intrinsic\ndenomination” is enunciated in the Monadology (G 6:\n608), as well as in the Correspondence with Samuel Clarke (G\n7: 372). Leibniz had abandoned his earlier view that two entities\ncould be distinguished by place alone when he came to his view of real\nsubstances as infinitely complex and unique and space as ideal. Kant\nfound the Principle arbitrary. To insist that any two objects presented\nto us in experience must be qualitatively different in some respect\nwas, Kant said, to take appearances for intelligibilia (KRV A\n264/B320). We cannot have two concepts — concepts of two things\n— that are alike in all their specifications, but we can\ncertainly have two empirical objects that are exactly alike. Why should\nwe not be able to imagine two identical water droplets? (20:280). It is\nsufficient for there to be two that they present themselves to us\n(veridically) in our visual space as two. Leibniz’s blunder on this\nscore was, for Kant, an indication that Leibniz had failed to grasp an\nimportant feature of sensory experience, namely that it, unlike thought\nin general, is always spatial. \n\nLeibniz’s metaphysics was developed within, and in part as a reaction\nto the mechanical philosophy of the mid-to-late 17th century, revived\nby Galileo, Descartes, Gassendi, Boyle, Newton, and Locke. While the\nterm “substance,” meaning the indestructible stuff of the\nuniverse, was retained by Descartes in his discussions of res\nextensa, the mechanical philosophers adopted a corpuscularian\ntheory in which objects were temporary aggregates of solid,\nindestructible particles with various figures and motions, and most\nthough by no means all change occurred through their contact,\npressure, collision, entangling, and so on. Leibniz contested the\ncorpuscularian image, insisting that it was insufficiently profound\nand inherently self-contradictory (G 4: 480), and holding that matter\nwas a ‘phenomenon’ founded upon the reality of\n“metaphysical points” or, as he later termed them, monads:\nqualitatively unique,indestructible and indivisible units that also\nperceived and strove (G 6: 608). \n\nKant accused Leibniz, along with Spinoza, of ‘taking appearances\nfor things in themselves’ (KRV A264/B330).  This might seem\npuzzling since Leibniz denied that we see the world as it really\nis. As Kant understood him, in failing to distinguish between\nintellectual representation and perception, Leibniz believed we saw\naggregates of monads as objects.  After his critical turn, Kant had\ndecided that “things in themselves” that compose external reality are\nnot perceived at all. They are not in causal contact with us, though\nthey affect us in such a way that we experience a sensory world\nstructured according to the categories of time, space, causality and\nobjecthood. \nMatter, Kant could readily agree with Leibniz, cannot be a thing in\nitself, stuff possessed of characteristics and qualities independent\nof human perception; what we call matter is an appearance (4:507). The\ntrue nature of mind-independent external reality cannot be described\nby reference to shape, contact or movement, which characterize only\nthe objects presented to us (A265-6/B 321-2). He understood Leibniz’s\nreasoning in favour of monads as follows: It is impossible\nto conceive two material atoms as both different from one\nanother and as simple, i.e partless; yet possible to conceive two\nsouls that are both different and partless (20:285). Therefore, if\nsubstances are manifold and partless, they must have representational\ncapacities. The crucial error in this reasoning lay in supposing that\nour abstract conceptions are a guide to reality behind the\nspatio-temporal appearances. Yet properly understood, he maintained,\nLeibniz’s monadology was not an attempt to explain appearances but the\nexpression of a “Platonic” view of the world, considered\napart from our sensory experience of it (4:507; 8:248).  In this\nregard, he did grasp that Leibniz did not after all take appearances\nfor things in themselves. \n\nDespite his warnings about the limited powers of human reason, Kant too believed it possible to\ndeduce some features of matter, as physical science must theorize it,\na priori. There are no material atoms; matter is divisible to\ninfinity and its parts are all material (4:503f). Yet Kant recognized,\nfirst in the Physical Monadology, then in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, particles in the form of centres of attractive and\nrepulsive forces that account for the space-filling property and\nimpenetrability of matter (4: 533ff). This relatively dogmatic\ntreatment co-exists with his critical claim that matter is the\nappearance of a perfectly unknown substratum. As he explains it in the\nCritique of Pure Reason, the rainbow is a mere appearance\nrelative to rain drops which, in a physical sense, are\nthings-in-themselves and not mirages. Yet thinking further, we realize\nthat the raindrops too are mere appearances, and that “even their\nround form, indeed, even the space through which they fall are nothing\nin themselves, but only mere modifications or foundations of our\nsensible intuition; the transcendental object, however, remains unknown\nto us.” (KRV A 45f/B 63f). “About these appearances,\nfurther, much may be said a priori that concerns their form but nothing\nwhatsoever about the things in themselves that may ground them.”\n(KRV A49/B66). This suggests that the stuff which is divisible to\ninfinity and bears attractive and repulsive forces is an appearance of\nsomething unknown and unknowable. “We can understand nothing\nexcept what brings with it something in intuition corresponding to our\nwords. When we complain that we do not see into the inner nature of\nthings, this can mean no more than that we cannot grasp, through pure\nreason, what the things that appear to us might be in\nthemselves…. Observation and division with respect to the\nappearances take us into the interior of nature, and we cannot say how\nfar this will proceed. But every transcendental question that takes us\nbeyond [perceptible] nature can never be answered…” (KRV\n(A277f/B333f). \n\nLeibniz held a relational theory of space and time. Without things\nthere would be no space, and without events there would be no time.\nSpace and time are not containers into which things and events may be\ninserted but which could have remained empty. In the Third Letter\nto Clarke (G 7:364), Leibniz maintains that “without the\nthings placed in it, one point of space does not absolutely differ in\nany respect whatsoever from another point of space.” An even\nmore ambitious positive proposal makes space the “order of\nco-existents” and time the “order of successions” (G\n7: 363), or a “well-founded phenomenon.” \n\nDespite his admiration for Newton, his presentation of a purported\nproof of absolute space in the essay On the Basis of the\nDifference of Regions in Space of 1768 (2: 378), and his claim in\nthe First Critique that two distinct but absolutely identical portions\nof space were possible (KRV A 264/ B320), Kant rejected absolute space\nand absolute motion in the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience. Consistently, however, he rejected Leibniz’s claim that\nspace was founded on the order of relations of substances. To the\nclaim that space emerged somehow from the underlying monadic reality\nseemed to Kant to imply that the truths of mathematics—in this\ncase three-dimensional geometry—depended on the existence of a\nworld of things and events, which was absurd. Leibniz, Kant, suggests,\nhad noticed that things appear to interact causally and to determine\none another’s behaviour.  This led him to insist that space was\n“ a certain order in the community of substances, and…\ntime… the dynamic sequences of their states,” confusedly\napprehended (KRV A 275f/B 331f). However, the composition of bodies\nfrom monads as basic elements presupposes their juxtaposition in space\n(20:278). If we confusedly perceive monads as physical objects in\nspace, what would it be like to apprehend the monads distinctly as not\nin space but as the foundation of space?  (4:481f) Kant’s conviction that the existence of incongruent counterparts\nproved that “space in general does not belong to the properties\nor relations of things in themselves” (4: 484) is not easy to\nunderstand, but his basic argument in the 1768 essay is that Leibniz’s\nview does not enable one to distinguish between a left handed glove\nand a right handed glove, insofar as the relations of all the parts to\none another are the same in both cases. Yet if God had created just\none glove, it would have been one or the other. Hence space does not\ndepend on relations between things in space. Newton’s conception of\nspace as a huge container does not, however,contribute to the solution\nof the problem: Consider a container in which a single glove is\nfloating. Is it a right-handed glove or a left-handed glove? We can\ninsert various new items into this space-container, e.g., an anorak, a\nscarf, a shoe, but only the insertion of a human observer into the\nspace will permit an answer. Space, Kant, decides, is related to\ndirectionality or orientation. The human observer experiences himself\nas intersected by three planes and as having three sets of\n“sides”, which he describes as up and down, back and\nforward, and right and left. Right-handedness and left-handedness are\nnot merely anthropic concepts since nature itself insists on\nhandedness in twining plants and the shells of snails (2: 380). But\nwhich direction is right and which is left can only be established by\na conscious, embodied being. As he expresses it in\nthe Prolegomena, “The difference between similar and\nequal things which are not congruent…cannot be made\nintelligible by any concept, but only by the relation to the right and\nleft hands, which immediately refers to intuition” (4: 286). How\nspheroid beings with hands would distinguish between\n“front” and “back” is not however clear. It is\nnot clear whether this orientational analysis implies that wherever\nthere is space there must also be sentient beings with pairs of\nincongruent parts, as well as top-bottom and back-front asymmetry. \n\nIn the Inaugural Dissertation §15, Kant tries to move\nbeyond the dichotomy of taking space and time to be either substances\nor phenomena, taking space instead to belong to the\n“form”of sensible intuition. As he expresses it in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason, “Space and time are [our\nsensibility’s] pure forms…” (KRV A42/B60). They are\n“merely subjective conditions of all our intuition.”\n(ibid., A 49/B 66). [See the entry on \n  Kant’s views on space and time.] \n\nKant’s rejection of Leibniz’s Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles is related to his complaint that the Leibnizians treated\nperception and thought as a single representational faculty that was\n“logically” (by which Kant meant\n“qualitatively”) distinguished in terms of the clarity of\nthe representation, rather than “transcendentally.” With\ntheir theory of a single cognitive faculty, Kant maintained, Leibniz\nand Wolff “abolished the distinction between phenomena and\nnoumena to the great detriment of philosophy.” Leibniz treated\nthe senses according to Kant as an inferior mode of cognition, the\nsenses having only the “despicable task” of confusing and\ndistorting the representations of reason (KRV B. 332). \n\nThe basis of this accusation was Leibniz’s attribution to the soul of\nonly two basic faculties: perception, the representation of\nmultiplicity in a simple soul, and appetition, which he defines as\n“the action of an internal principle which brings about change\nor the passage from one perception to another” (G 6:\n608–9).  Perceptions, in Leibniz, as in Descartes, are thoughts\n— presentations in the mind. The perceptual thought that there\nis a green tree in front of me is not absolutely unlike the\nmathematical thought that triangles have three angles. Perception of\nmaterial objects is “confused” because — according\nto the Cartesian tradition — corporeal substance has no colours\nor other sensory properties — which come into being through the\ninteraction of the mind and tiny, single imperceptible, uncoloured\ncorpuscles of matter.  Though Leibniz denied the existence of purely\nmaterial corpuscles and the possibility of causal influx or even\ninteraction between real substances, he agreed that, from the\nperspective of what he sometimes terms mere physical science,\nperception required interaction, and that corpuscular motions were\ninvolved in the perception of sensory qualities such as light and\ncolour. Perception can therefore be said to confuse what reason\ndelivers to us clearly (A 132, 219, 403). Though we are unable to\ngrasp the sufficient reason of particular colours, there is nothing\narbitrary in their connection with their underlying causes (A\n382f). \n\nLeibniz’s interpreters, Wolff and Baumgarten, enunciate more\ndogmatically the theory that there is a single faculty of\nrepresentation in the soul, with perception and cognition\ncorresponding to its lower and higher parts. It was this view that\nKant presented as entirely opposed to his own teaching with regard to\nthe faculties of the soul. Sensibility, for Kant, is the\n“receptivity of the subject by which it is possible for the\nsubject’s own representative state to be affected in a particular way\nby the presence of some object.” Thought is “the faculty\nof the subject by which it has the power to represent things which\ncannot by their own quality come before the sense of that\nsubject” (2:392). Thought implies an ability to experience\nrepresentations of another type not involving the forms of sensibility\n— space, time, and causality. Spatio-temporal features are\nattached to all our perceptions and to our perceptual thoughts, but\nnot to the concepts we entertain descriptively. We can\nthink of things in themselves, and even of God, the soul, and\nother such entities, acknowledging their existence and even their\npowers, but we do not perceive them and we cannot represent them in\nsensuous form. \n\nIn his late philosophy, Leibniz distinguished between “simple\nmonads,” which despite their representational and appetitive\nfaculties, merely experienced something like our swoons and dreamless\nsleeps; “souls,” belonging to animals with sensory organs\nthat had awareness of an environment and desires; and\n“spirits,” who were able to grasp necessary truths and\nexperience more complex appetitions such as desiring the good (G 6:\n610–12). All monads, according to Leibniz, are confusedly omniscient (G\n6: 604). Kant was scornful of what he regarded as transcendental\nreverie. The “slumbering monad” with its dim presentations,\nis, he complains, “not explained, but made-up” (2.277). The\nnotion that the slumbering monads might awake to climb the ladder of\nawareness recalls, he said, “a kind of enchanted world”\n(20:285). However, Kant was favourably disposed, at least in his early\nyears, towards Leibniz’s doctrine of confused omniscience, and he\nessentially accepts Leibniz’s conception of the mind as innately\nstocked with, as Leibniz expresses it, “inclinations,\ndispositions, tendencies or natural potentials” (A 52). In his\nearly essay on Negative Quantities, Kant remarks “There is\nsomething great and I think, very correct in Leibniz’s notion that the\nsoul embraces the entire universe with its representational powers,\nalthough only an infinitely small part of this representation is\nclear……Outer things can carry the condition of their\npresentation, but not the force to bring themselves into existence for\nus. The powers of thought of the soul must have real\ngrounds…” (2.199). Though Kant later professed agnosticism\nas to whether perception and mentality in general were explicable\nmechanically, the emphasis on the active powers of the mind by contrast\nwith the passivity of matter remains important in his theory of\nmind. \n\nThe distinction between perception and thought signaled\nKant’s break with rationalist metaphysics but enabled him to deploy a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy against dogmatic claims. By showing how\neach mode of apprehension involved certain necessary and distinct\nlimitations on its employment, Kant was able to show that certain kinds\nof assertion in theology and metaphysics could not be genuine\nknowledge-claims. Perception was limited by the kinds of bodies we had\nand the manner in which we could be affected by external objects. We could not acquire scientific\nknowledge of the origins of the universe, or of our condition after\ndeath. Pure reason could not fill in details that were beyond all\npossible experience. The claims of metaphysics had\nto be synthetic, informative and not true by definition, yet a\npriori true. Arithmetic and geometry supplied synthetic a\npriori truths in abundance, and natural science supplied synthetic\na posteriori truths, as well as exhibiting synthetic a\npriori propositions, such as the conservation of force. \nAlready in\nhis prize essay of 1764, the Investigation of the Intelligibility\nof the Fundamental Principles of Natural Theology and Morals, Kant\nclaimed that moral and theological principles were not capable of\ndemonstration, since their terms, unlike mathematical terms, lacked\nprecise definition. Geometrical concepts lend themselves to use in\ndemonstrations because they are constructed and presented to intuition,\nwhich is impossible with respect to metaphysical concepts such as the\nsoul. In the Critique of Pure Reason, he says: “If\nanyone were to pose the question to me: What is the constitution of a\nthing that thinks? then I do not know the least thing to answer a\npriori, because the answer ought to be synthetic…But for\nevery synthetic solution, intuition is necessary; but this is entirely\nleft out of so universal a problem” (KRV A 398). The\nProlegomena returns to the question how metaphysics can, like\nnatural science and mathematics, employ synthetic judgments when its\nconcepts are not given in experience and are not constructed. Kant’s\nanswer is that metaphysical judgments do not point to objects existing\nbeyond all possible experience, but posit objects needed to\n“complete” our understanding, that is, to make our thinking\nsystematic and untroubled by gaps and aporias. The soul is not a\nsupersensible object of whose faculties and powers we can acquire\nknowledge but an idea that makes our practice of ascribing experiences\nto ourselves intelligible. \n\nFor Leibniz, “I” am a substance, and my mind, as a\n“dominant monad,” rules over, or expresses more distinctly than they do,the subordinate monads\ncomposing my body. Thus all happenings in all parts of\nthe body are felt distinctly or indistinctly, the sensory organs\ncollect and concentrate the impressions of the external world, and the\nsoul experiences them. Though commentators disagree over whether the\nreferent of “I” is a corporeal substance — a\nsoul-body composite — since Leibniz did not believe separated\nsouls without organic bodies were possible — or, alternatively,\na single dominant monad, an immaterial substance outside space and\ntime, “I” assuredly named a thing that was indivisible and\nimperishable (G 6: 598–600). Kant eschews dogmatism both with\nrespect to whether the soul is an immaterial substance and whether it\nis immortal. The use of the term “I” presupposes that my\nthoughts and perceptions are experienced as bound up together and as\nbelonging to a single entity.  Matter, with its properties of\nextension, impenetrability, etc., cannot be conceived as producing\nthought. But matter is only an appearance; whatever supersensible\nthing it is that gives rise to the appearance of matter, that thing\nmay well be the same as whatever supersensible thing it is that gives\nrise to the experience of an experiencing self (KRV A 358f/B\n428f). \n\nLeibniz’s theory of soul-body pre-established harmony set out in his\nNew System of the Nature and the Communication of Substances\nof 1695 is not easy to reconcile with the interpretation of his\nmonadology according to which what we call bodies are appearances in\nvisual space founded upon spiritual substances lying underneath the\nspatio-temporal order. Yet the pre-established harmony was at least\nconsistent with Leibniz’s claim that substances do not interact with\none another and that what we call “causal interaction” does\nnot involve a flow of power or force, but merely a regular sequence of\nchanges in two observable things, in the case of mind and body, the\nexperiences of perception and appetition and states of the sensory\norgans (G 4:76–7). Kant points to the tension between the theory of\npre-established harmony and the monadology; “Why should one admit\nbodies, if it is possible that everything happens in the soul as a\nresult of its own powers, which would run the same course even if\nentirely isolated?” (8:249). \n\nKant initially preferred “influx” theories of soul-body\nrelations to the “parallelist” theories of occasionalism\nand pre-established harmony, but he eventually decided that dualism was\nincoherent. Already in the Measurement of Living Forces, he\nwas grappling with the problem of the location of the soul and the\nnature of its action. Anatomists had long speculated that some region\nof the brain, e.g., the pineal gland (Descartes 1650) or the corpus callosum (Euler 1763), was the site of interaction between soul and body. For a time,\nKant seems to have believed that souls were positioned in space and\ncould act outside themselves and be acted upon by bodies. Later he\nbecame convinced that souls were not localized in space, though they\ncould effect changes, deciding that that neither medicine nor\nmetaphysics could illuminate the question. He denies that we can\nunderstand the entry of the soul into body at conception or its\nrelation to the body throughout life, or its exit and separate\nexistence after death. Because all our experience is experience of\nourselves as living beings — when soul and body are bound\ntogether — we cannot know what a separated soul would experience.\nLeibniz compared existence after death to a deep sleep or a swoon, but\nto investigate these matters is, Kant says, like standing before a\nmirror with your eyes closed to see what you look like when you are\nasleep (20:309). \n\nLeibniz believed that every phenomenon could be explained. His\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason states that “nothing takes place\nwithout a sufficient reason; in other words,…nothing occurs for\nwhich it would be impossible for someone who has enough knowledge of\nthings to give a reason adequate to determine why the thing is as it is\nand not otherwise.” Though not everything possible happens (and,\ntherefore not everything that happens is necessary), everything that\nhappens has a sufficient reason in an antecedent state of the world.\nGod’s necessary existence is the only state of affairs that is caused\nand does not have a sufficient reason in an antecedent state. Not only\ndoes everything have a sufficient reason, but all phenomena and events,\nincluding celestial motions, the formation of plant and animal bodies,\nand the processes of life, are regulated by the laws of mechanics, as\nthe movements of the hands are regulated in a watch (G 7:417–8). \n\nLeibniz’s Principle was incompatible with the existence of an open\nfuture and with free will. His followers recognized this aspect of his\nsystem, though his Discourse on Metaphysics, in which\ndeterminism is tied to his inclusion theory of predicate-subject\nrelations remained unpublished until the twentieth century. Though\nLeibniz tried to avoid contradicting the theological dogma of free will\noutright, he denied that any creature could choose between alternatives\nto which it was indifferent, and he agreed with Locke that we are\npowerfully and necessarily motivated by disquiet and restlessness,\nwhich are, in Leibniz’s view, sometimes unconscious or subliminal (A\n188f). My body is a machine in a wider mechanical system, and my\nthoughts and desires, including my “petites perceptions,”\ncannot but harmonize with or parallel states of that machine.\n“The organized mass in which the point of view of the soul is\nlocated, being expressed more immediately by it, [is] reciprocally\nready to act on her account following the laws of the corporeal\nmachine, at the moment when the soul wills it, without one disturbing\nthe laws of other, the animal spirits and blood taking on, exactly the\nmotions required to correspond to the passions and the perceptions of\nthe soul” (G 4: 484). Yet, for Leibniz, the infinite complexity\nand uniqueness of any living machine make human actions unpredictable,\nand the truth of determinism is consistent with our experiences of\nself-control, self-management, and behavioural reform (A 195f). For a\nvariety of reasons, Leibniz did not see determinism or mechanism as a\nthreat to morality. \n\nKant did. His perception was facilitated by a series of attacks on\nLeibniz’s disciple Christian Wolff by theologians alarmed by what they\nsaw as the horrific consequences of Sufficient Reason, attacks that led\nto Wolff’s banishment from the University at Halle. Leibniz’s\n“spiritual automaton,” moved by its presentations, has a\nfreedom, Kant claims in his second critique, the Critique of\nPractical Reason, that is only “psychological and\ncomparative.” If Leibniz is right, we have no more than a\n“freedom of the turnspit” (5: 97), wound up to run by\nitself. In that case, Kant thought, man is a “marionette”\n(5:101), and morality is but a figment of the imagination. To know that\nthe moral law is not a figment and is genuinely binding, it might seem\nthat we would have to know that we have the power to redirect the\nforces of nature. Of course we cannot know this, but, on the other\nhand, we cannot prove that no such power exists. [See the entry on \n Kant (Sect 5.2) and the entry on \n  Kant’s moral philosophy (Sect. 10).]  \n\nReason presents compelling arguments for the inevitable nature of\nevery event. Reason also presents compelling arguments that the human\nwill can influence the course of nature (KRV A 445/B 473). The antinomy\nis dissolved, Kant now maintains, by recognizing that causal relations\nmust structure outward phenomena. Our investigations of nature\npresuppose that they do, insofar as they are scientific. Human agency\nis not, however, an outward phenomenon, and the assumption of\ndeterminism is not required. We can view ourselves as machines,\nresponding to the environment in predetermined ways. However, we are\nnot compelled to do so, and we are able to regard ourselves as agents\nwho initiate trains of events, and who can resist (not just experience\nresistance to) the desires, sensations, and impulses driving the bodily\nmachine to certain actions. Since we can do so, Kant decides, we\nshould: we need not in that case be driven to or fall into\nlibertinage on the basis of speculative doctrine. What reason cannot\nsettle theoretically, she can nevertheless decide on\n“practical” grounds, i.e., deciding to believe one thing\nrather than another to preserve satisfaction (by contrast with anxiety\nand despair), and to give support to our sense that morality is not a\nfigment. We ought therefore to conceptualize our possession of free\nwill as an exemption from the laws of nature; the power of “doing\nand forbearing.” (5: 95). \n\nKant was perturbed by Hume’s criticisms of causal relations in nature,\nbut even more perturbed by the antitheological application Hume made\nof his causal skepticism in the Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion. [See the entry on \n Kant and Hume on causality.]\nHe sought a third way between the Leibnizian “dogmatic”\nassumption that the universe is a single mechanical system of\ndeterministically interacting physical parts, designed and set going\nby God, and the empiricist assumption that causality corresponds to a\nhuman feeling of anticipation with respect to some sequence of ideas.\nFor scientific purposes, Kant thought, we must represent inorganic\nnature to ourselves as just such a unified mechanical system. The\nresolve to represent it as such is facilitated (or perhaps dictated?)\nby our inability to experience a world unstructured by spatial,\ntemporal, and causal relations. If Leibniz erred by ascribing to\nunknown noumena the properties of causal closure belonging to\nphenomena, Hume erred by being unaware of the inbuilt constraints on\nour representational capacity. But must we represent only inorganic\nnature — stones, stars, nebulae, planets, billiard balls —\nas a set of mechanically interacting mechanical systems, or earth’s\nplants and animals as well? Leibniz was fully committed to the\nCartesian claim that plants and animals are machines, no different in\nprinciple from automata built from wood and metal parts; though,\nimpressed by the detail revealed by the early microscope, he described\nthem as infinitely complex machines, “machines in their smallest\nparts, into infinity” (G 6: 618), another indication of the\ndivine origins of nature. Generation and growth were on his view,\nmechanical processes, for, according to the doctrine of preformation,\nwhich he shared with Malebranche, generation is just growth. \n\nKant was not so sure. By the late 18th century, the\ntheory of inorganic nature, thanks to Laplace, Black, Priestley,\nFranklin, and other chemists and electricians was flourishing, but so\ntoo was the study of physiology, embryology, and natural history,\nthanks especially to Bourguet, Boerhaave, Haller, and Buffon. Newtonian\nforces acting over a distance were no longer seen as incompatible with\na commitment to mechanism, opening the door to the supposition of vital\nforces that might act in a lawlike fashion. Preformation was no longer\na credible doctrine; the possibility of self-assembling “organic\nmolecules,” working according to “organic mechanism,”\nwas much discussed. Epigenesis reduced the need for a divine creator.\nKant addresses the ensuing intellectual-theological crisis in the\nCritique of Judgment, a two-part essay dealing with beauty,\nbeautiful forms in nature, and forms in nature generally. He tries to\nshow that we are caught up in an antinomy. We are strongly disposed to\nview visible nature as a unity in which a single set of mechanical\nforces operates, not to divide it into an inorganic realm that came to\nbe by the forces inherent in nature and an organic realm of plants and\nanimals evidencing design and supernatural creation. Yet we cannot\nenvision explaining generation or organic growth mechanistically. The\nsolution to the dilemma is to adopt teleology as a regulative\nprinciple. We should not positively declare that organic beings could\nnot have arisen and cannot reproduce themselves from the forces of\nnature, or that God must have a hand in their genesis; nevertheless,\nin investigating them, we look for the function and interrelation of\nparts, as though they were designed and built intelligently (5:\n416ff).  The claim that the parts of a living creature are\norganized in infinitum is however, “something that\ncannot be thought at all.” (KRV A 526/B 554). \n\nLeibniz was often mistakenly credited in the 18th century\nwith the view that organic nature contained no gaps, i.e., between any\ntwo different-looking organisms, another can be found. Though such a\nview might seem consistent with Leibniz’s Principle of Plenitude\n— that the universe is as full as possible — and his Law of\nContinuity — his denial that nature makes leaps (GM 6: 240)\n— it is inconsistent with his view that not everything possible\nexists, but only what is compossible with other existents, and Leibniz\nheld no such view in any case. Kant describes the idea of perfect\ncontinuity in any case as mere intellectual prejudice, since\nobservation of nature does not objectively support it. However, he\nallows the “law of the ladder of continuity among\ncreatures” has regulative importance in natural history (KRV A\n668/ B 696). \n\nLeibniz’s philosophy is theocratic. God is a king, and the world is\nhis kingdom. Ours is the best of all possible worlds, with respect to\nvariety, order, location, place, time, efficiency, and “the most\npower, knowledge, the greatest happiness and goodness in created\nthings” (G 6: 603). For God can choose to realize any world he\nwishes, and it would be inconsistent with his goodness and power to\nrealize a world that is not as good as possible. Our world metes out\njustice for all in the hereafter and is constantly improving. The\n“kingdom of nature,” in which everything happens for\nmechanical reasons, is at the same time, a “kingdom of\ngrace” in which everything that happens exemplifies God’s wisdom\nand justice (G 6:622). Yet, though Leibniz maintained frequently that\nthe order and regularity of nature hinted at or pointed to a divine\ncreative hand, and suggested that the existence of anything at all\nimplied the existence of a necessary being (G 4: 106), he produced only\none actual argument for the existence of God. This was a version of\nAnselm’s ontological argument. Leibniz maintained that God’s existence\ncould be deduced from the maximal concept of God as the sum of all\nperfections, only if it was first demonstrated that God was a possible,\nnot an impossible object. Certain maximal concepts, such as “the\ngreatest speed” are, he pointed out, fundamentally incoherent,\nand the term denotes nothing (G 4: 359–60). Leibniz saw nothing\nincoherent in the maximal notion of “the most perfect\nbeing” and concluded that God existed. It was unclear however,\nwhy, so long as God is possible, the Ontological Argument survives the\nfamiliar criticisms of Aquinas. The inference from possibility to\nnecessity seems to depend less on the logic of concepts than on\nLeibniz’s esoteric idea that concepts, or possible objects, strive to\ncome into existence with a tendency to exist proportional to their\nperfection (G 7:303). \n\nKant criticized arguments for God’s existence (presumably brought to\nhis attention through Wolff’s Theologia Naturalis) that\ndeparted from the premise that the concept of God is noncontradictory\nas fallacious hyperrationalism. The Leibnizian argument rested, he\nthought, on the uncritical notion that every noncontradictory concept\nwas a possible thing (20:302), though it is unclear why he attacks this\nclaim in particular. Kant did not think any rationalistic proofs for\nthe existence of God actually worked, though, at least before the\nmauling it received at the hands of Hume, he considered the\nphysico-theological argument the best available. He noted perceptively\nthe arbitrariness of merging into one theological idea a creator and a\njudge. Without revelation, we might be drawn to the ideas of a creator\nGod, but why would we suppose this same being to have the power of\nreward and punishment after death? Taking a page from Locke, Kant\ndecided that, since the existence of God was unknowable, philosophical\neffort should be directed to the idea of God, especially the separate\nfunctions that the idea of God plays in regulating our moral conduct (\njudge concept) and our mode of address to the problems of form and\nfunction in the organic realm (creator concept). The distinction\nbetween the realm of grace and the realm of nature, one standing under\nmoral laws of reward and punishment, the other under natural laws, Kant\ndescribes as a “practically necessary idea of reason” (KRV\nA 812 f/B 840). We conceive the world both as a community of active\nspirits, willing and representing, and as an aggregate of objects in\nmechanical interplay and shift perspectives as needed. \n\nAs befit a celebrated optimist, Leibniz had a sanguine view of human\nbeings. Most of us, he appeared to think, are morally decent people,\nand evil men are best dealt with by good laws and effective legal\ninstitutions. A good education and some degree of censorship are also\nhelpful. Posthumous divine retribution will take care of what human\ninstitutions cannot. Leibniz explained the appearance of evil in the\nworld as consistent with God’s goodness in various ways. He claimed\nthat evil derives from the portion of inertia or nullity present in all\nnon-divine creation; that it is a necessary accompaniment of good, or a\nstimulus to action, that it is an illusion based on narrow or\ntemporally limited experience (G 4: 120f, 196, 231). Moreover, the\nworld has not declined since the Fall, but, on the contrary, the entire\nuniverse “takes part in a perpetual and most free progress, so\nthat it is always advancing toward greater culture (cultivation)”\n(G 7: 308).  \n\nPhysical and increasingly moral evil were topics much discussed in the\n18th century, and pessimism over the condition of the world,\nespecially its violence and suffering, was understood to be a tempting\nyet in some ways deplorable option. Taken to ridiculous lengths by\nWolff, Leibnizian optimism was targeted and satirized by Voltaire,\nwho, however, took the problem of evil very seriously. Kant as well\nwas little inclined to make fun of evil and suffering, and he viewed\nliberation from theology as a precondition of better morals and\npolitics. There are both optimistic and pessimistic strains in his\nphilosophy. In his pre-critical writings, the Nova\nDilucidatio and the Essay on Some Considerations on\nOptimism, he seemed inclined towards the best of all possible\nworlds position, but in his critical period he denied that cosmic\njustice is an item of knowledge. The conviction that moral goodness\nnot only deserves reward but is rewarded is nevertheless an article of\nfaith and hope that sustains morality.  \nKant had no illusions about the natural goodness of human beings, but\nhis concept of development, of the unfolding of latent potentials, is\ncentral to his anthropology and his philosophy of history. Development\nwas, however, as much of a duty as an inevitability. He accepted\nLeibniz’s teleology of history: “We should be content with\nprovidence and with the course of human affairs as a whole, which does\nnot begin with good and then proceed to evil, but develops gradually\nfrom worse to better…” (8:123).  Alarmed by colonial\ndepredations, Kant nevertheless saw social and geopolitical conflict\nas necessary and he tried to find redeeming aspects to group\naggression and interracial conflict as preconditions of pacification,\ncivilization, and progress.  Kant’s noxious views on sex and race\ndistinguish him from Leibniz, overall, the more generous philosopher,\nwhose view it is that God maximizes the richness and diversity of\ncreation. To be sure, the Kantian tendency to pathologize the other\nflowed from an excess of moral fervour. True to his rejection of the\nPrinciple of Contradiction, Kant saw the human soul as the\nbattleground of animalistic instincts vs. moral duties. Effeminacy and\nsavage indolence were combated by virtue. Yet the deprivations that\nhad to be endured by a person of strong moral fibre exercising a good\nwill were, he recognized, real deprivations. If the struggle for\nself-mastery and self-improvement that he urged on his readers was not\nto seem, and indeed to be a pointless exercise, then knowledge, as he\nexpressed it in the Preface to the second edition of the Critique\nof Pure Reason, had to be denied in order to make room for faith\n(B xxx). This antirationalism would have been unthinkable in a\nLeibnizian text. \n\nFor Kant, philosophy is a stern and masculine discipline frequently\ncalling for graceless prose. After publishing several floridly written\npopular works, and after acquiring his knowledge of physics through\nsuch accessible expositions as Bernard Fontenelle’s Dialogues on\nthe Plurality of Worlds (1696), Emilie du\nChatelet’s Institutions de physique (1740), and\nEuler’s Letters to a German Princess (1768–72)\n(7:229–30), Kant traded literary charm for technicality, rigor,\nand repetition, especially in the first two Critiques. The\nenchanting views of the\nMonadology which Leibniz himself may have regarded as a jeu\nd’esprit were antithetical to philosophy’s true purpose. Yet Kant\nfinally aestheticizes Leibniz, claiming that he meant only to express\na view of the world that is true in its own way. The history of\nphilosophy, Kant suggests, is not to be assessed in terms of right and\nwrong doctrines. To accuse Leibniz or Plato of errors is to take them\nas authorities, as one takes Cicero as the standard for Latin, and\nthis is a confusion; for “there are no classical authors in\nPhilosophy” (8: 218).","contact.mail":"cww899@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
