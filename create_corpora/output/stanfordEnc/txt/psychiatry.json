First, there are topics that arise when we treat psychiatry\nas a special science and deal with it using the methods and concepts of\nphilosophy of science. This includes discussion of such issues as\nexplanation, reduction and classification. Second, there are conceptual\nissues that arise when we try to understand the very idea of mental\nillness and its ethical and experiential dimensions. Third, there are\ninteractions between psychopathology and the philosophy of mind;\nphilosophers have used clinical phenomena to illuminate issues in the\nphilosophy of mind, and philosophical findings to try to understand\nmental illness. This entry will discuss issues in the philosophy of\nscience and philosophy of mind that pertain to psychiatry.\n\n\n\nScholars and textbooks alike agree (though they might not like it)\nthat psychiatry now adheres to the “medical model”, which\nadvocates “the consistent application, in psychiatry, of modern\nmedical thinking and methods” (Black 2005, 3) because\npsychopathology “represents the manifestations of disturbed\nfunction within a part of the body” (Guze 1992, 44) to wit, the\nbrain. But what does it mean to adopt this view of psychiatry, and what\ndifference does it make? \n\nOne might think that the medical model merely commits us to a\nbrain-based view of mental illness with few implications for science,\nand it is true that clinical or scientific differences across\npractitioners seldom seem to have much to do with divergent\ninterpretations of the medical model. However, many theorists have\nargued that our current diagnostic categories, as compiled into DSM-5\n(American Psychiatric Association 2013: I refer to different editions\nof this work by its abbreviated title), are faulty because they are\nderived from observable phenomena rather than underlying physical\npathologies. These theorists are sceptical about many existing\npsychiatric diagnoses, and not just on empirical grounds; they see DSM\ndiagnoses as collections of symptoms rather seeing them as medicine\nunderstands diseases—in terms of destructive processes realized\nin bodily tissues. Genuine mental illnesses, on this view, are not\njust sets of co-occurring symptoms but destructive processes taking\nplace in biological systems. Following Murphy (2009), this may be\ntermed the strong interpretation of the medical model. In contrast, a\nminimal interpretation of the medical model thinks of mental disorders\nas collections of symptoms that occur together and unfold in\ncharacteristic ways, but it makes no commitments about the underlying\ncauses of mental illness. \n\nThese two interpretations are set out in section 2. Explanation is\ndiscussed in section 3. The strong interpretation naturally suggests\nthat psychiatry should embrace the practices of medical\nexplanation. If disease is a pathological process in bodily systems,\nthen there must be a way of understanding how such processes occur in\nthe brain, and how they explain the clinically observable facts about\nmental illness. But it seems that the logic of the medical model does\nnot force us to privilege any one level of explanation—notably,\nit does not commit us to explanations restricted to the resources of\nmolecular biology. Psychiatry, then, is a multi-level science. But we\noften know very little about the mental illnesses that psychiatrists\nstudy, and much explanation in psychiatry involves case studies or\nnarrative accounts that cite the characteristics of a disorder, rather\nthan underlying systems. Theorists disagree over whether these should\nbe seen as different kinds of explanation, or as rudimentary forms of\na full causal explanation. Section 3 also discusses the difficulties\nraised by cross-cultural issues. Section 4 discusses some recent approaches to mental illness that are broadly within the medical model but dissent from the mainstream. \n\n It may be helpful to distinguish\nminimal and strong interpretations. A\nminimal interpretation makes no commitments about the underlying\nphysical structure that causes mental illness. The strong\ninterpretation of the medical model, in contrast, dissents on just this\nissue. It says that the proper medical understanding of disease is in\nterms of morbid anatomy. It is committed to specific causal hypotheses\nin terms of abnormalities in underlying neurobiological systems.\nMinimalists treat diagnostic labels as useful heuristics rather than\nnatural kind terms, whereas a strong interpretation commits psychiatry\nto a view of mental illness as a medical disease in the strongest\nsense, that of a pathogenic process unfolding in bodily systems. \n\nMinimalists employ a concept of disease as the observable, regular\nunfolding of a suite of symptoms. Kraepelin applied it to psychiatry as\nthe basis for differential diagnosis, for example between dementia\npraecox (schizophrenia) and other forms of insanity (1899, 173–175). It\nis a familiar idea that the DSM’s syndrome based conception of\nmental illnesses stands in the tradition of Kraepelin, who argued that\n“only the overall picture of a medical case from the\nbeginning to the end of its development can provide justification\nfor its being linked with other observations of the same kind”\n(1899, 3). This familiar neo-Krapelinian picture is that mental\nillnesses are regularly co-occurring clusters of signs and symptoms\nthat doubtless depend on physical processes but are not defined or\nclassified in terms of those physical processes. \n\nGuze (1992), for example, is a minimalist. In saying that\npsychiatry as a part of medicine he means that we can classify\ndisorders in terms of their characteristic symptoms and courses. McHugh\nand Slavney (1998) seem to agree. They say that a disease “is a\nconstruct that conceptualizes a constellation of signs and symptoms as\ndue to an underlying biological pathology, mechanism and cause\n(302).” To diagnose a patient as suffering from a mental\ndisorder, for McHugh and Slavney (48), is to label them in a way that\nwe judge helpful as a starting point for investigating physical\nprocesses. \n\nMcHugh and Slavney deny that a disease is a physical\nprocess—“its essence is conceptual and inferential”\n(48). This way of thinking about diseases prescinds from\ntheorizing about underlying causes of a disease entity in favor of a\nconcentration on observable phenomena, not hidden causes. However, it\nis diseases understood as destructive processes that make up the taxa\nof medicine. Similarly, the successive editions of the DSM have sought\nto classify mental illnesses based on course and symptoms but not\nspecific causes. \n\n Many scholars have argued (e.g. Bynum 1994, Carter 2003,\nWhitbeck 1977) that in the nineteenth century medicine changed in many\nways, including a shift in thinking about disease. Instead of seeing\ndisease as the identification of symptoms, it was the linkage of\nsymptoms to distinct pathologies, understood as departures from normal\nfunction, that came to define disease. Heinrichs (2001, 271), for\nexample, insists that psychiatry needs to employ this basic medical\noutlook, and therefore needs a developed theory of how the mind/brain\nworks that can be used to identify psychological abnormalities and\nexplain how they arise. Andreasen (2001, 172–76) embraces the strong\ninterpretation. She argues that psychiatry, now emerging as a form of\ncognitive neuroscience, is for the first time able to identify the\nspecific pathophysiologies that underpin the symptoms of mental\nillness. This development fits the pattern suggested by Hempel (1965),\nwho expected psychiatry, as it matured, to develop a theory-driven\nclassification scheme based on an understanding of the objective nature\nof mental illness rather than just pragmatic factors (Hempel 1965; See\nFulford et. al 2006: 324–341: Thornton 2008: 169–74). \n\nThe DSM treats mental disorders as syndromes along the lines of the\nminimal medical model. Individuals who share a DSM diagnosis have a\nsubset of symptoms in common, often drawn from a larger list so that\nalthough some people may have all their symptoms in common, there may\nbe no overlap at all in other cases. These collections of symptoms are\nalso supposed to unfold over time in more or less the same way, once\nwe make due allowances for some individual variation. They are also\nexpected to respond to treatment in the same way. The previous version\nof the DSM assumed that each\ndiagnosis represented malfunction in some mental, physical or\nbehavioural trait or capacity (DSM-IV-TR, xxi). However, the diagnoses\nwere listed without worrying about what that underlying malfunction\nmight be, and in most cases there was (and remains) no agreement about\nwhat causes what. DSM-5 defines mental disorders (p. 20) as syndromes\ncomprising clinically significant disturbances of cognition, emotion\nor behaviour that reflect underlying dysfunctions. These are normally\nassociated with distress or social disability, but cannot be diagnosed\nif the behaviour is culturally normal or merely socially deviant,\nunless it reflects a dysfunction.  \n\nDSM diagnoses are usually taken to reflect a conventional concept of\ndisease, despite the talk of underlying malfunction, because of the\nemphasis on syndromes and the lack of causal hypotheses. In the\nmanner of the minimal medical model, they let us make use of\ndescriptive and statistical reasoning and offer the hope of accurate\nprediction and effective control. In the opinion of some philosophers,\nthat is all science ever aspires to. I began by citing a textbook\ndeclaration that psychiatry uses normal medical methods, and there is\ncertainly nothing within McHugh and Slavney’s discussion of mental\nillness that makes scientific methods inapplicable. \n\nOther philosophers, though, will tell you that the job of science is\nto discover the causal structure of the world. Furthermore, there are\nplenty of students of psychopathology who argue that the neglect of\ncausal structure in psychopathology is getting in the way of science\n(Poland, Von Eckardt and Spaulding 1994, Murphy 2006, Gerrans\n2014). They worry that we are lumping together different groups of\npeople based on behavioral evidence alone, when in fact their\nobservable similarities mask important underlying differences,\nincluding differences between normal people who are troubled but\nbasically healthy, and their pathological counterparts. From this\nphilosophical-cum-clinical perspective it looks like dereliction of\nduty when any scientific discipline isolates itself from inquiry into causes. Suppose we ask why\nthe conventional view of diseases is successful in organizing\nprediction and control (what psychiatrists sometimes call\n“predictively valid”). The obvious answer is that\nsuccessful predictive categories are actually tracking the causal\nstructure in the world that accounts for the shared nature of the\ndifferent instances, so we should aim for a stronger validation of the\ndiagnosis than mere predictive validity. Whilst the reliability of a\ndiagnosis is a gauge of agreement across measurements and observers,\nvalidity is supposed to be about what is really there. It looks\nobvious that even the most expert observers could all agree but\nnonetheless be wrong, whereas proper validation reassures us that we\nare measuring something that is really there. (Psychiatrists employ\nthe concept of validity in several ways; for help in sorting them out,\nsee Fulford et al. (2006: 318–19), Schaffner (2012) and the\nessays in Zachar et al. 2014.) \n\nSomeone committed to a strong version of the medical model sees\nvalidating a diagnosis as understanding its underlying causal\nstructure: a valid diagnosis rests on a biological process\nthat can be identified by experiment and observation using the methods\nof the biological and cognitive sciences. Any approach to psychiatry\nthat looks to science to validate its categories in this way must meet\nat least two conceptual challenges. First, there is a metaphysical\nchallenge, which is that a concept of validity tied to the uncovering\nof neurobiological processes seemingly adopts a realist philosophical\nposition, thinking that science can tell us how the world is really\nput together. Many philosophers think that realism is a wholly\nunnecessary and unwarranted metaphysical commitment, and that all\nscience can really tell us about is a set of relationships among the\ndata. These relationships let us make predictions and exert some\ncontrol over nature, but do not tell us what is really out\nthere. Philosophical disputes over realism have often centred on the\nnotion of the unobservable. In psychiatry\nthe situation is different; theories and constructs refer to latent\nvariables rather than unobservables.  Schizophrenia, as a\nconstruct, is not a further type of stuff that lies behind the\nappearances and explains them: it is constituted by visible\nphenomena. We are not looking for an unobservable, but asking which\nobservable phenomena (neurological, genetic, developmental, social)\nexplain the symptoms. If the strong conception of the medical model is\nphilosophically realist, it is so in light of its commitment to\ncauses, not to unobservables.  We may look for a hidden variable that\nexplains the observable phenomena, or for some other hypothetical\nunderlying cause. Gold and Gold (2014, p.163–66) for example, suggest\nthat many delusions and other psychotic symptoms may reflect a\nmalfunctioning “Suspicion System” that has evolved to\ndetect and monitor social threats. If such a system exists it is not\ndirectly observable, but its components should be open to observation\nand manipulation via the standard methods of the cognitive\nsciences. Psychiatry, like many sciences, deals in hidden variables or\nhypothetical causal structures, but it is not helpful to think of\nthese as unobservable in the traditional sense.   \n\nThe second conceptual challenge to the realist interpretation of\nvalidity is normative. The challenge is that there is an important\nsense in which diagnoses cannot be validated at all, if by\n“validation” we mean “shown to be a real\ndisorder”. All validation can do is show that a pattern of\nbehaviour deemed to be clinically significant depends on a physical\nprocess. Whether that pattern of behaviour is really pathological -\nrather than immoral or harmlessly odd- is another matter. The second\nchallenge probably is very hard to meet. It requires that judgements\nof pathology be scientifically\ngrounded, rather than human judgements. If\nso, there has to be some natural fact of the matter about whether some\nphysical system is dysfunctional. If this cannot be done, then\npredictions about physical states can be validated, but disorders\ncannot be.   \nThe DSM classification has been designed to improve communication\nbetween psychiatrists and across disciplines and provide a basis for\neducation. But it is not advertised as the jumping-off point for a\nmature system of causally organised classification and practice. This\nreflects a minimal interpretation of the medical model; it can guide\nempirical research but not uncover causal structure. This leaves it\nopen to the charge that a classification which groups together\nobservable phenomena can sort entities into heterogeneous classes,\nwith underlying diversity masked by surface similarities so that like\ncases are not grouped with like cases (Tabb 2015). We already know\nfrom other areas of medicine that what looks like the same\nphenomenon—a cough, say, or a sore throat, or chest\npain—can reflect different biological processes and hence may\nreally signify different conditions. A taxonomy that is content with\nsurface features risks lumping different conditions together and\nkeeping related ones apart. \n\nHere are some examples of this charge in the recent literature (for\nothers, see Murphy 2006 (chapters 1–3) and McNally, 2012). Ross\net al. (2008, 33–34, 200–01) suggested some revisions to the current\ndiagnostic category of Pathological Gambling (PG) (see DSM-IV-TR, 671–74).\nThe category of pathological gambling is designed to operationalize a\nconcept whose content is, roughly, gambling that causes problems for\nthe gambler. But Ross et al. reasoned as follows: the existing category\n“maps relatively smoothly onto the class of people who exhibit\nclassic patterns of addictive behaviour as a result of a specific kind\nof dysfunction in their dopaminergic reward system and consequent\nneuroadaptation impairing frontal control circuits. We therefore\nbelieve that clarity would be served … by replacing the\nbehaviourally derived concept of PG with the neuroscientifically\nanchored concept of addictive gambling (200)”. \n\nA judgment that DSM categories have insufficient validity led the\nNational Institute of Mental Health to introduce the Research Domain\nCriteria (RDoC) in grant proposals (Insel et al. 2010). The\noriginators of the RDoC acknowledged that the system entrenched by\nprevious versions of the DSM has increased diagnostic reliability. But\nthey worried that it was too detached from the nature of mental\nillness, which they conceived of as disorders of brain circuits. For\nexample, rather than existing categories such as depression, the RDoC\nenvisaged a domain of negative valence including symptoms of anxiety\nor depression that might come to be seen as expressions of an\nunderlying disorder of specific brain circuits (Sanislow et al 2010)\n. These disorders could be studied at many levels and need not be\nidentified with simple lesions. But future models of mental illness\nare expected, on this vision, to draw on psychological, neurological,\nand genetic mechanisms, as well as information about the wider\ncultural context. In this case, validating a diagnosis is thought of\nas understanding its underlying causal structure: a diagnosis is valid\nif it rests on a biological process that can be identified by\nexperiment and observation using the methods of the biological and\ncognitive sciences. (For philosophical discussion of the RDoC in the\ncontext of precision medicine, see Tabb 2020). \n\nRoss and his colleagues argued along similar lines in their discussion\nof gambling. They thought there were two benefits to the conceptual\nchange that they wanted. First, it would provide a clearer and\nprincipled demarcation of the addicted gambler from the “problem\ngambler” which is currently somewhat arbitrary (201). They also\nshowed the way to a better understanding of the nature of the addictive\ndisorders more generally via the use of their preferred approach,\nwhich combined neuroscience and behavioural economics. They drew on\nprior research (ch. 6.2) to suggest that addictive gambling resembles\ndependence on stimulants (like cocaine) more than it does alcoholism,\nand hence enlarges our understanding of addiction more fully than\npurely behavioural criteria would do. The worry is that a behavioural\napproach misses the similarities and differences between forms of\naddiction by treating all as more or less the same, based on shared\nbehavioural and phenomenological effects. \n\nTo make these arguments we have to distinguish the truly\npathological gambler, whose life is dominated (and typically wrecked)\nby gambling, from merely habitual gamblers. Habitual gamblers might\nengage in gambling more than they feel they should, or periodically\nlose more than they can afford, but there is a qualitative difference\nbetween this population and the population of genuinely addicted\ngamblers. This qualitative difference is detected by observing\nbehaviour and rating the results of questionnaires. However, if we\nclassify gamblers according to quantitative measures alone, we miss the\nreason why different groups behave differently. The reason is a causal\nprocess. The brains of the real addicts don’t work like the\nbrains of the merely troubled; thinking of addiction merely in terms of\nhabitual behaviours will not let us make the discriminations among\ngamblers that neuroscientific evidence detects. \n\nA stronger but similar argument was made by Horwitz and\nWakefield (2007). They claim that only a hypothesis about causes\ndistinguishes a normal population from a disordered one. They\nbegin with the DSM criteria for diagnosing major depression. A subject must suffer from\nfive of the following nine symptoms in a two week period (including\neither or both of depressed mood or diminished interest or pleasure in\nalmost all activities): depressed mood; diminished interest; weight\ngain or loss (without dieting) or change in appetite; insomnia or\nexcessive sleep; observable psychomotor agitation or retardation;\nfatigue or loss of energy; feeling worthless or excessively guilty;\ndiminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness;\nrecurrent thoughts of death or suicide or a planned or attempted\nsuicide. \n\nObviously many ordinary episodes in a person’s life can cause\nbehaviors or feelings from this list, such as losing one’s job.\nThe traditional concept of melancholy or depression, which in the West has a\ncontinuous history going back to classical antiquity (Radden 2000),\nsees pathology only where\none’s circumstances do not justify a normal melancholy response. \n\nThe DSM, however, ignores this tradition. Anyone who fits the syndrome\nreceives the diagnosis regardless of how their life is going.  The\nsole exception stipulates that grief following bereavement does not\ncount towards diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder until two months\nhave elapsed, after which one may diagnose major depression. But not\neven that qualification is made if you show depressive symptoms after\nyour intended jilts you at the altar or you fail all your exams or get\nyour legs blown off. In subsequent work Horwitz and Wakefield (2012)\n extended their analysis to the anxiety disorders. They argued\nthat normal human anxieties are being pathologized and that the\ndiagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression have been much too\nsharply distinguished from those for depression, leading to an\ninability to explain why depression and anxiety so often co-occur. \n\nDuring the run-up to DSM-5 the Mood Disorders Work Group proposed\neliminating the bereavement exclusion. This met considerable\nprofessional and public opposition (see\nZachar 2014, ch. 10 for a summary of the debate and a discussion of\nthe issues). From the standpoint of Horwitz and Wakefield, the\nproposal appeared to be pathologizing a normal human\nreaction. However, it was never suggested that grieving itself was\npathological. Rather, the proposal was based on the idea that\nstressful life events often precipitate episodes that meet the\ncriteria for a major depressive episode, and there is no reason to\nexempt bereavement. Many people, after the death of a loved one,\nexhibit symptoms very like those of major depression, and are at risk\nfor subsequent episodes. From this perspective, the elimination of the\nbereavement exclusion is justified by science, regardless of common\nsense (Kendler et al 2007; Lamb et al 2010). Why should bereavement\nalone be exempted from the general claim that depression is caused by\nstressful life events? \n\nHorwitz and Wakefield suggest that genuine depression is caused by a\ndysfunction on the part of a loss-response system that evolved to\nrespond to losses that threaten to deprive us of reproductive\nresources. In depression the system misfires. It causes a\nloss-response in situations where it should not. Whether or not that\nis convincing, the argument that Horwitz and Wakefield make about the\nconflation of depression and sadness stands on its own merits. They\nmake the case that the DSM conception of depression respects neither\nfolk psychological common sense nor previous psychiatric consensus\nabout depression. They conclude that the concept of depression defined\nby this diagnostic syndrome represents a major conceptual break. Our\nuse of the new concept, they suggest, means that many people who are\njust normally miserable for understandable and ordinary reasons are\nbeing diagnosed as depressed. This leads to unnecessary alarm about an\nepidemic of depression as well as carrying unfortunate consequences\nfor many people who are wrongly diagnosed. However, it is certainly\nopen to those theorists opposed to the bereavement exclusion to insist\nthat if depression is the result of an underlying system that\nmisfires, it could misfire in response to bereavement. The proposal is\nnot that everyone who grieves should be called depressed, but that\nthere are reactions to bereavement that are severe enough to meet the\ncriteria for major depression and should be classed as such.  \n\nThe DSM concept of depression, on the face of it, lumps together\ndifferent psychological and behavioral types in the same category. It\ndoes this because it neglects the diverse etiologies that may produce\nsimilar signs and symptoms. There is no way to answer this charge, or\nto arrive at a satisfactory taxonomy that mirrors that of general\nmedicine, unless we adopt a causal foundation for nosology as suggested\nby psychiatrists who urge the adoption of what I have called the strong\nmedical model. Indeed, without an account of underlying causal\nstructure, it becomes difficult to give a principled answer to the\nquestion why some conditions should be seen as pathological to begin\nwith. Merely saying that members of a class have certain properties\ndoes not tell us whether, let alone why, they are mentally ill. To\nanswer that question we need some basis for making the judgment. The\nDSM, as we have seen, states that we have such a basis; mental disorder\nis an outward sign of dysfunction. But to make that argument, we need a\ncommitment to finding dysfunction somewhere on the basis of the\noutward, observable phenomena. The minimal model can only\nanswer questions about the relationship between membership in a taxon\nand some other variable: it will not explain why the taxon has the\nnature that it has, or why it should be seen as a kind of disorder. \n\nDoing that involves not just the empirical study of mental disorder,\nbut a strong interpretation of the medical model, with its commitment\nto a view of disease as not just a syndrome but a destructive process.\nIt is certainly possible to collect data using the DSM concept of\ndepression, especially information about epidemiology and natural\nhistory. In that sense normal medical reasoning can indeed be employed,\nbut much medical reasoning is directed at trying to\nunderstand causes. It is here that we come to the strong\ninterpretation, with its commitment to the idea that a mental disorder,\nlike any other disease, is not just a construct to guide inquiry, but a\ngenuine part of the causal structure of the biological world—a\ndestructive entity with a distinctive pathophysiology which explains\nthe observable phenomena that the minimal model is content with. \n\nProponents of the strong interpretation, then, can agree with Guze\nthat there are distinct mental illnesses with characteristic symptoms\nand natural histories. But they go further. If psychiatry is really a\nbranch of medicine, they suspect, we should see the specific causal\nhypotheses emerge about mechanisms that cause the symptoms of mental\nillness. Both Andreasen and Guze assume that to find the specific\ncauses of disease we need a background theory of normal function.\nPsychopathology is to be identified as the departure of a psychological\nsystem from its proper state. (We should note what counts as a\nmalfunction is often contested in psychology and neuroscience.\nFurthermore, the presence of a malfunction does not suffice for mental\nillness. Most scholars agree that our thoughts about the nature of\ndisease are sensitive to biological abnormalities but are also guided\nby judgments that such abnormalities impede human flourishing (See\nCooper 2007, Murphy 2006, Sadler 2004, Wakefield 1992). The medical\nmodel also sees abnormalities or dysfunctions as necessary but not\nsufficient for mental illness. The broader issues involved will be put\naside here. Our question is: how far can psychiatry adopt medical\nreasoning about pathogenic neurobiological processes? ) \n\nThe strong interpretation seeks explanations that cite pathogenic\nprocesses in brain systems, just as bodily diseases are explained by\nprocesses in other organs. The process at issue need not be\ndestructive, in the sense that it makes the system collapse. Bolton and\nHill (2004, 252) note that many mental illnesses seem to be the\noutcome of systems in a poorly regulated state that is stable, albeit\nsuboptimal. But, as they say, the same is true of hypertension and\nCushing’s disease; the idea of a specific pathogenic process in\nmedicine includes dysregulation. \n\nHeinrich and Andreasen assume that since the brain is an information\nprocessing organ the obvious background theory is cognitive\nneuroscience. Other thinkers have argued that the correct background\ntheory for psychiatry is molecular biology (Kandel 2005, ch.2). \n\nBolton and Hill worry that whatever background theory the medical\nmodel employs, it will require explanations in terms of biological\nrather than intentional phenomena. They conclude that biological\npsychiatry can only accommodate disorders in which\n“intentionality has run out” (2004, 256). If true, this\nrules out using the medical model to explain the many psychopathologies\nthat appear to involve irreducibly intentional or meaningful processes\n(cf. Thornton 2007, ch 4). The worry is founded on the assumption that\nthere is an unbridgeable distinction between understanding a phenomenon\nin intentional terms and providing a causal explanation of it.\nBut the brain is a cognitive organ—and, indeed, a social one.\nMany disciplines study the effects of healthy cognition on behaviour,\nand there is no reason to expect that cognition will suddenly become\nirrelevant to the explanation of behaviour when we study mental\nillness. For instance, Kendler and Prescott (2006, 148ff) found that\n“stressful life events” are among the chief causes of\ndepression, that they are especially depressogenic if they involve\nexperiences of humiliation (160), and that humiliation cannot be\ngiven a molecular reduction (350). Kendler and Prescott call Major\nDepression one of the oldest diagnoses in medicine (52) and they are\ncommitted to finding specific etiologies. Yet they are happy to employ\n“classically mental constructs” (350) as parts of their\ncausal models of mental illness. \n\nAs presented so far, the strong interpretation of the medical model\nincludes a demand for understanding biological systems in terms of\ntheir normal function if we are to understand why they become abnormal.\nKincaid (2008, 375) has argued that a demand like that is\nunreasonable, because we can conduct research on depression (his\nexample), as we do medical research more generally, based on\n“partial and unsystematic” causal understanding. Kincaid\nidentifies the demand for a background theory with the search for a\n“complete wiring diagram of the organism from fertilization to\nmaturity” (377) and he identifies that search with a\nconception of science as a search for laws of nature and natural kinds.\nBut these seem to be separable: a background theory could comprise a\nnumber of partial wiring diagrams arrived at by piecemeal\ninvestigation, nor does it have to be driven by a desire for\nexplanation in terms of kinds participating in laws. The questions are,\nwhat sort of general orientation toward mental phenomena does the\nmedical model permit, and what sorts of explanations can it encompass?\nWe do not need a complete theory of how biological systems work in\norder to conduct fruitful research. The issue is whether, at a minimum,\nthere need to be some rough theoretical frameworks and shared empirical\nclaims within which otherwise abnormalities can be identified and\noutcomes assessed. \n\nFirst, nothing in the strong interpretation of the medical model\nrules out explanations that cite cognitive processes in brains:\nAndreasen (1997) argues that schizophrenia and depression are cognitive\npathologies and sees psychiatry as both a form of medicine and\n“the discipline within cognitive neuroscience that integrates\ninformation from all these related disciplines in order to develop\nmodels that explain the cognitive dysfunctions of psychiatric patients\nbased on knowledge of normal mind/brain function” (1586).\nThis conception of psychiatry is fully biological but not committed to\na particular metaphysical interpretation of what biological explanation\nmust look like. It sees mental illness as the result of pathogenic\nprocesses taking place in brain systems but does not force us to choose\nreductive explanations as a matter of logic. So Bolton and Hill’s\nworry about the compatibility of the medical with their “neural\nencoding” theory (2005, ch.2) seems overstated. They are right to\nstress that the brain can be seen as a socially situated, cognitive\norgan, but there are advocates of a strong medical model who are\nequally attuned to this conception of neuroscience. Existing medical\nand biological practice already cites processes that cross levels of\nexplanation (Schaffner 1993, 1994) and incorporate environmental\ninformation about stress or other risk factors. There is in principle\nno objection to adding an intentional level to the mix. Any conception\nof normal neurological functioning must take information-processing\ninto account, because processing information is what brains are for.\n \n\nMost mental illnesses are caused by diverse environmental and\ngenetic factors. We have little reason to think that all the relevant\ncauses can be given a reductive analysis, for as Schaffner dryly points\nout, to specify and measure environmental variables in purely molecular\nterms “would be a very long-term project” (1994, 287).\nBut one might still think that molecular processes are the root\ncauses of mental illness even if many other contributory factors exist\nand define the context within which genes work. Kandel (2005) offers a\nvery stringent version of this view, which assigns all explanatory\nsignificance to proximal genetic causes on the grounds that “all\nof ‘nurture’ is ultimately expressed as\n‘nature’ (39)” He means that behavioral and\ncultural factors influence gene expression, but he also seems to think\nthat this implies that psychiatric explanations need only mention gene\nexpression, which will screen off everything else. \n\nKandel’s genetic reductionism is a metaphysical position aimed\nat identifying a privileged level in nature and a general explanatory\nstrategy that unifies the phenomena and offers lawlike explanations.\nHowever, in medicine the goal of causal explanation is instrumental. We\nseek the factors that make a difference in a given case, not a\nmetaphysically privileged level or a general unifying account. There is\nlittle reason so far to believe that the reductionistic approach Kandel\nurges has been more fruitful. \n\nIn studying eating disorders, for example, we find that social\nfactors may explain particular epidemiological patterns, like different\nlevels of eating disorder across populations. But social factors\ndon’t tell us why only one girl in a family gets bulimia. To\nexplain that we can look at a particular brain chemistry that puts her\nat risk (Steiger et al 2001). But that does not establish that\nneurobiology really is fundamental. Rather, nothing is fundamental.\nCulture or trauma may require biological mediation to have its\npathological effect, and vice-versa. Neither one should be considered\nfundamental, but seen rather as the best way to answer a specific\nquestion about what makes a difference in a context. \n\nThe identification of a cause of a disease often depends on what we\nwant to control. The reason for this, as Whitbeck (1977) and Kincaid\n(2008) have convincingly argued, is that physicians care about causes\nfor instrumental reasons. The goal is to understand why a biological\nsystem has departed from a functional state and identify components and\nprocesses within the system that can be manipulated so as to understand\nthe abnormal character of the system, and, ideally, mitigate it.\nIn looking for the relevant factors we do not seek a final\ndescription of the system or look for the ultimate sources of an\nabnormal or disvalued outcome. Rather, we hope to identify the\nvariables that made a difference to the outcome. \n\nThat is why alternative etiologies can complement, rather than\ncompete with, each other, as in Meehl’s (1977) example of an\nelderly man, genetically somewhat at risk for depression, who develops\nit after his spouse dies. It seems wrong to call this a genetically\ncaused episode of depression: the genes needed an unusual environment,\nso that in most other circumstances the man would not be depressed. But\nhe would not have developed clinical depression had his genes been\ndifferent. Both factors are causally relevant. \n\nBecause of this stress on figuring out what makes a difference in a\ncontext, medicine is a natural home to manipulationist accounts of\ncausation, as Whitbeck also saw (1977, 627–28). The basic idea behind\nthe manipulationist approach is that it puts us in a position to begin\nexplaining a phenomenon “when we have identified factors or\nconditions such that manipulations or changes in those factors or\nconditions will produce changes in the outcome being explained”\n(Woodward 2003, 10). We may have a correlation—say that\nbetween smoking and heart disease. We get from there to a causal\nexplanation if we can intervene so as to manipulate the value of the\ncausal variable by itself—by stopping one group from smoking\nand letting an otherwise identical group smoke, for example. If smoking\ncauses heart disease, we will see an effect on the cancer variable that\nreflects our meddling with the smokers. If smoking doesn’t cause\nheart disease then there will not be a correlation between the two\nvariables. (This view is compatible with many proposals about the\nunderlying metaphysics. There will be more on this account of causation\nin section 3.1. For the technical details see Spirtes et al 2000, Pearl\n2009). \n\nKandel’s avowed molecular reductionism dissents from the\ngoal-driven, manipulationist view. Kandel bets that molecular\nexplanation picks out nature’s own preferred level. He assumes\nthat as we learn more we will be able to supply fundamental\nexplanations at such a level. Kandel invites us to give up a fruitful\napproach in favor of a promissory note, on which we have scant reason\nto expect payment. Molecular explanations do not appear to be\nflourishing alone among all possible approaches to mental illness.\n(Schaffner (1998) points out how hard it is to supply reductive\nexplanations even for simple model organisms.) \n\nThings may turn out as Kandel expects, but it is not clear that they\nwill, based on the current fortunes of different kinds of psychiatric\nexplanation. In any event, it seems that the medical model does not\nrequire any particular level of explanation. Rather, it seems to be\nmarked, in its strong interpretation, by a search for explanations of a\nparticular form that can involve many different levels. These are\nexplanations that show how symptoms of mental illness systematically\ndepend on disruptions to the normal functioning of biological and\ncognitive processes. The strong interpretation of the medical model\nbets on such explanations being available and—which is a\nfurther claim—being clinically useful when they are finally\nuncovered. Whether the ensuing explanations privilege one form of\nexplanation over others is an empirical question to be answered case by\ncase. However, psychiatry currently recognizes many different causal\nfactors and we should expect that to continue. One way of cashing out\nthis idea is to say that psychiatry must pay attention to different\nlevels of explanation. The next section, on explanation, will begin\nwith a discussion of this point. \n\nI begin with a picture that is familiar to philosophers of psychology,\nMarr’s (1982, 24–5) distinction between three levels of\nexplanation in cognitive science. The highest specifies the\ncomputational task accomplished by the system of interest. It tells us\nwhat the goal of the system is, specified in terms of what it\ncomputes.  The middle level describes the actual representations and\nalgorithms that carry out the goal. The lowest level tells us how\nbrain tissue or other material substrate, such as the parts of a\nmachine, can implement the algorithm. Note that the\nlevels of description are different perspectives on the same\nmental process - Marr thinks of vision as the construction of a 3D representation from a 2D input, and the three levels are three different ways to understand that construction. Other cognitive phenomena can also be understood in these three ways.  \n\nMarr sought to understand psychological capacities in the abstract\nwithout worrying about biology: although he certainly assumed that\ncapacities could be realised in a physical set up, he thought that the\ndetails of the particular set up would not make a difference to the way\nthe psychology was understood. But as the sciences of the mind have\nbecome more interested in the brain we are learning that this idea may\nneed to be amended. Cognitive neuroscience is learning to look for\nphysical structures in the brain that carry out information-processing\njobs, or what Glymour (1992) calls “cognitive parts”. Our\nunderstanding of biological realization feeds back into and constrains\nour understanding of the abstract processes of cognition (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993). Rather than relating abstract psychological\ncapacities to each other, higher level descriptions of the mind/brain\nin cognitive neuroscience relate capacities understood as functional\ndescriptions of fairly coarse-grained brain areas, not purely abstract\ncomputational task specifications. Theories of the normal system\nspecify the nature and interrelation of cognitive parts. Armed with\nthese assumptions about cognitive parts, psychiatrists can see a\ndisorder as a breakdown in normal functioning within and between\ncognitive parts. Marr’s first level might seems to be useful as a\nsource of background theory for doing psychiatry, because it asks\n“what is it for?” and much of psychiatry is about finding\nout psychological systems fail to do what they are for. \n\nHowever, we still face the question of how psychological deficits\nare related to other levels of explanation, and here Marr’s\npicture comes under real stress. Marr’s three levels are\ndifferent representations of the same process. But in psychiatry\ndifferent levels typically represent distinct causal processes. For\nexample, the causes of many mental illnesses include a mix of genes and\nenvironmental factors, as in Meehl’s example, cited above, of\ngenetics and bereavement conspiring to cause depression. The genes and\nenvironmental effects are different kinds of processes, not different\nlevels of one process. If we were dealing with one process,\ndescribable in different ways, then we could anticipate a reductive\naccount, in which higher-level variables are mapped on to lower-level\nones. But even though it is hard enough to imagine a molecular or\nneurological reduction of a psychological construct like humiliation\n(which, we saw above, is depressogenic), it is even harder to imagine a\nreductive analysis of socio-cultural factors like unemployment or\nchildhood sexual abuse. They have brain effects, but the brain effects\nvary across classes of individuals in ways that depend on other\nenvironmental and genetic contexts (see Kendler and Prescott 2006 for a\ncomprehensive review.) \n\nSchaffner (1993, 1994) suggests this structure is the norm\nthroughout biology, and sees it as relating causes and effects at\ndifferent levels of explanation. Appealing to levels of explanation is\nunobjectionable if it just involves a reminder that we need to relate\nvariables of many sorts. But it is not clear that we have any\nprincipled grounds for sorting phenomena into levels. Marr did, because\nhe imagined levels as descriptions of the same process (the\nconstruction of a 3D image from 2D retinal impacts) couched in the\nvocabularies of different sciences. But when we move outside the skull\nand begin introducing environmental factors and other kinds of cause,\nthe Marrian picture looks less plausible. \n\nAnother way in which levels talk has featured in recent philosophy\nof psychiatry is as a constraint on permissible kinds of explanation.\nChris Frith (1992, 26) for example, imagines what we would say if we\nfound a strong correlation between a spike in dopamine levels and\ndelusions of thought insertion (in which, for example, one has the\nexperience of another person’s thoughts in one’s own mind).\nHe argues that such a correlation is “simply not\nadmissible” as an explanation because we would remain in the dark\nabout why a sudden upsurge in dopamine causes thought insertion rather\nthan something else. To show why thought insertion comes about, Frith\nthinks, we need a cognitive story which shows us how it is caused by\nfailures of normal subpersonal processing. \n\nFrith’s idea is that a causal explanation of a psychotic\nphenomenon, or some other mental symptom, must cite properly cognitive\nvariables to be explanatory. That is, explanations should relate\nvariables from the same level. The relationship between dopamine\nand thought is just opaque to reason, and we want variables that are\nrelated in ways that are transparent to reason. There is a constraint\nhere; the idea that explanations of psychological phenomena should\nrelate cause and effect in ways that we find intelligible. Campbell\n(2008) in attacking this picture, notes that talk of levels of\nexplanation is often wheeled in at this point, as it is by Frith, to\nsupply relations that are transparent to reason in the right way. The\nidea is that only processes at a level let us grasp explananda at that\nlevel. Explanantia at a different level are not intelligible in the\nright way, so although lower-level processes may realise the higher\nones they cannot explain them. This amounts to a constraint on\nacceptable explanation. Should we accept it? \nThe debate here quickly gets into technical arguments about the\nconcept of causation. Campbell argues against Frith in favour of the\nHumean idea that we simply cannot tell in advance of inquiry what\ncausal relations obtain in nature. Anything can cause anything and it\nis just as unwarranted to suppose that the relevant explanatory\nvariables for psychotic or affective phenomena must be cognitive as it\nis to adopt a simple reductionism and insist on their being\nbiological. Decades of research have revealed that mental illness is\ncaused by, and causes in turn, many different physical, psychological\nand social factors. We simply have to take our causal relations where\nwe find them, including interlevel ones. Craver and Bechtel (2007,\n554) on the other hand, argue that it stretches the concept of\ncausation to breaking point to admit interlevel causes: they say that\n“to accept interlevel relationships as causal violates many of\nthe central ideas associated with the concept of\ncausation”. Craver and Bechtel argue from the perspective of\nmechanistic explanation. Mechanisms explain effects in terms of\ninterlocking parts, and the relation across levels, they affirm, is\none of constitution, not causation; causation can only be\nintra-level. Interlevel causation, on this view, amounts to something\ncausing itself, because different levels are different ways of talking\nabout the same thing. However, talk of levels in psychiatry often\ninvolves relating different parts of the world, as in Meehl’s example:\ngenetics and bereavement may be seen as requiring different levels,\nbut they are not different ways of describing the same process. Causal\nmodels must interrelate phenomena of very different types. \nIn part because of these issues, that levels in psychiatry are not\nMarrian, Campbell (2006) argues for an interventionist approach to\ncausation. This is the view that when we say X is a cause\nof Y we are saying that intervening on X is a way of\nintervening on Y (Woodward and Hitchcock 2003, Woodward 2003,\nPearl 2000): manipulating one variable makes a difference to\nanother. This is not a reductive analysis of causation, since it makes\nuse of causal ideas—it just states that questions about\nwhether X causes Y are questions about what would\nhappen to Y if there were an intervention\non X. Kendler and Campbell (2009) have argued that an\ninterventionist model provides a rigorous way of articulating the idea\nthat any combination of variables might characterize the causes of a\ndisorder, whilst at the same time providing a clear test of what\nvariables are actually involved, thus avoiding a simple-minded holism\nthat just says that lots of things are relevant. They further note\n(2009, 997) that interventionism “permits the clear separation\nof causal effects from the mechanistic instantiations of those\neffects”, thus directly confuting the approach favored by\nBechtel and Craver. \n\nAppealing to levels of explanation in psychiatry, then, might just\nbe a reminder that we need to relate variables of many sorts in\nexplaining the causes of disorder. But it may also be connected with\nparticular perspectives on reduction, explanation and causation. We\nwon’t go into these debates here; rather, we will move on to\ndiscuss a further problem. As well as great diversity in causal\nfactors, psychiatry also confronts the problem of diverse symptoms;\nmany mental illnesses take a different form in different people.\nAlthough two people might both be diagnosed with major depression, they\nneed share few symptoms. Both are very likely to feel miserable and\nlose interest in activities they normally enjoy. However, one might\nlose weight, sleep less and becomes physically agitated while the other\nsleeps more and becomes lethargic and tormented by feelings of guilt\nand thought of suicide. The philosophical problem arises from the\nconfrontation between the great variation in clinical reality and the\nneed to simplify in order to render that reality scientifically\ntractable. In summary form, the problem is; what are we trying to\nexplain when we explain a mental illness? Is it a diverse set of\nreal-world phenomena, or some simplified representation of those\nphenomena? \n\nOne way to start thinking about what we have to explain in\npsychiatry is to borrow from Thagard’s (1999, 114–5) account of\ndiseases as networks of “statistically based causal\nrelations” which are discovered using epidemiological and\nexperimental methods. This fits the picture that Kendler and Prescott\npresent for depression quite neatly (although their models are designed\nto incorporate both causal relations between variables and\ncorrelations). Thagard’s causal-statistical networks, like\nKendler and Prescott’s path models, provide “a kind of\nnarrative explanation of why a person becomes sick” (p15). They\nincorporate information about the typical course of a disease as it\nunfolds over time, including information about typical risk factors for\nthe disease—such as the finding that heavy use of aspirin increases\nacid secretion which makes a duodenal ulcer more likely. The causal\nnetwork does not specify how each causal factor produces its effects,\nthough. It is really a descriptive model that lets us ask the question;\nwhat facts make it true that people get sick in these ways? \n\nIn effect we have a set of exception-prone generalizations about the\npathways a disorder takes: people in this situation are likely to\nbecome depressed unless such and such intervenes. And when they are\ndepressed they will probably have the following experiences, unless\nthey have these other ones. Thagard’s idea of a narrative is\nhelpful here; path models represent typical stories about\ncharacteristic ways of getting sick. But a narrative by itself might\nnot explain anything; if it is explanatory, it is because earlier\nevents mentioned in the narrative pick out the causes of later\nevents.  Rachel Cooper (2007) presents a way of thinking about psychiatric\nexplanation that fits well with the idea that a diagnosis lets us tell\na story. We often find ourselves with narratives that tell us how\nsomeone gets sick, and it might be that a useful narrative is one\nwhich isolates the temporally prior variables and lets us see how\nlater phenomena depend on them. One way to think about this is that a\ngood narrative is one that talks about a natural kind. If we have a\nnatural kind, with some causal structure underpinning it, the\nsystematic dependence of later states on earlier ones is easy to\ngrasp. Several theorists have defended a view of psychiatric disorders\nas natural kinds. Influential recent philosophical treatments have\nrejected the idea that mental disorders have essences, but have\ndefended the idea that mental disorder are natural kinds in\nBoyd’s sense of homeostatic property clusters (Beebee and\nSabbarton-Leary 2010; Kendler et al. 2010; Parnas et al. 2010; Samuels\n2009, Zachar 2014, Pereira 2020), in which properties occur together\noften enough, and reliably enough, to support ampliative inferences,\neven if the mechanisms responsible for the kind do not make every\nmember of it the same as every other member. When inductive reasoning\nworks, thinks Boyd, it works because we have have latched onto these\nunderlying causal mechanisms that bring about the\nclustering. Successful inductions track the observable manifestations\nof the causal mechanisms responsible for the characteristics of the\nkind. The mechanisms, we might say, leave an identifiable causal\nsignature in the world.  The HPC account seems to suit mental\ndisorders. They often vary across cases, with characteristic symptoms\nsometimes absent even when the patient presents a typical cluster of\nsigns and symptoms. So it is understandable that theorists who are\nsympathetic to the medical model in psychiatry should be drawn to the\nhomeostatic property cluster idea.   \n\nCooper distinguishes natural-history based explanations from case\nstudies. She presents them as distinct kinds of psychiatric\nexplanation, but she doesn’t go into detail about what the other\ntypes might be, so her overall position is hard to grasp. But one idea\nis very clear; at least some mental illnesses are natural kinds, and\nnatural history explanations work by “invoking natural\nkinds” (2007, 47). Once we know which kind an object belongs\nto, we can explain and predict its behaviour based on its kind\nmembership: we can say why a substance has expanded upon being heated\nby invoking the fact that it’s a bit of metal, and metals expand\nwhen heated. Or we can predict that if Rex is in the kitchen then\nleaving the roast beef there unattended is a bad idea, since Rex is a\ndog and dog-meat interactions take a predictable form. And, it is\nhoped, we can explain why Laura hears voices by appealing to the fact\nthat she has schizophrenia. And our confidence that she is\nschizophrenic warrants (pessimistic) predictions about her future. \n\nCooper also talks about case histories and argues that they explain\nanother person’s unique situation by drawing on our capacities\nfor simulation of other people’s states of mind. This claim\ninvolves commitments in the explanation of theory of mind that would\ntake this essay too far astray. The relation of folk psychology to case\nhistories is unexplored, as is the nature of reasoning from cases more\ngenerally: we lack a good general account of what a case history\nexplains or is otherwise good for, in psychiatry or in any other field.\n(Forrester (1996) points out that reasoning with cases seems to be a\ndistinctive and ubiquitous style of thought in science and elsewhere,\nand we have no good account of it.) So for now, we must put case\nhistories aside. \n\nCooper argues that a natural history explanation needs to cite\nnatural kinds if it is to be helpful. But in order to work the\nexplanations do not need to cite the actual causal mechanisms\nresponsible for the behaviour of the members of the kind in question.\nWe know that Rex will devour the roast if we leave him in the kitchen\nwith it, and we can safely make this prediction despite total ignorance\nof canine physiology. The history of psychiatry offers a number of\ninstances in which pharmacology has led to the recognition of new kinds\neven in the absence of detailed causal knowledge. For example\nCade’s (1949) discovery that lithium greatly inhibited the\nstartle reflex and other forms of anxiety in guinea pigs was useful\neven without good information about their underlying cognitive\nneurobiology, since it led him to predict that whatever was going on\nmight also apply in humans. \n\nInvoking kinds give us power over the world, by making it easier to\npredict, control or mitigate the outcomes we care about. One\nphilosophical question we can ask, of course, is whether science wants\nanything more. If you think science just aims for empirical adequacy,\nthen it may seem that sorting patients into kinds is enough, provided\nthat we can understand the course of the disease. \n\nIn particular, natural history explanations fit a conception of\ndiseases as syndromes unfolding over time that is enshrined in both\nDSM-IV-TR and the minimal construal of the medical model. It does not\ndeny that there are causal processes, but sees mental illnesses as\ncollections of signs and symptoms with characteristic histories. They\ndoubtless depend on physical processes but are not defined or\nclassified in physical terms. This picture of disease naturally goes\nalong with the employment of natural history explanations, since they\ntoo invoke natural kinds without worrying about the mechanisms that\nexplain the behaviour of members of the kind. It’s enough to be\nable to identify kind membership, thereby giving us a degree of\nexplanatory and predictive control. \nNatural history explanations fit Thagard’s disease network\nnicely; if a disease network provides a narrative account of why people\nget ill, and predicts some outcomes, we can see it as a graphical\nrepresentation of the historical pathway typical of a kind. Much\nepidemiological work in psychiatry fits the pattern here; we try to\nisolate the causal factors that define a disease history that is met\nwith regularly. These histories display relations between variables\nthat show how later phenomena, like the symptoms of depression or\nsubstance abuse, depend on earlier phenomena, like the genes you were\nborn with, or the parental abuse you endured. \n\nUnlike some of the more homespun examples, the natural histories\nuncovered by systematic longitudinal research can be quite surprising\nand genuinely explanatory. But (as Cooper and Thagard both suggest)\nthey leave us with a lot to do; whatever the philosophers of science\nmay say about how empirical adequacy is good enough, physicians have\nspent a century and a half looking for causal explanations of\npathological phenomena (Carter 2003). \n\nCooper suggests (174n2) that natural history explanations\nprovide us with what Murphy (2006) calls causal discrimination, as\nopposed to causal understanding. We can know two kinds are causally\ndifferent even if we don’t why they are different, because the\ndetails of the underlying causal structure evade us. Different types of\nplant may need to be put in the ground at different times, or in\ndifferent seasons, in order to maximize crop yield, for instance, and\nwe may be able to predict accurately that different patients will\nrespond to different drugs even if the basis for these differences\nremain unknown. But we assume that these differences rest on an\nunderlying causal structure. In psychiatry, differential\ndiagnosis follows a similar logic, but sceptics wonder if the degree of\nvariation makes the predictions too unreliable for this approach to\nreally work. \n\nAn explanation of this type places entities in kinds, thereby\ntracking the as yet unknown causal factors that regularly make the same\nkind of difference in patients of the same type. Rather than\nidentifying the causal factors, then, the natural history approach\ntracks the operation of hitherto unknown causes, by sorting patients\ninto kinds with a presumed common nature, based on the natural history\nof their conditions, or on other grounds that I have not talked about,\nlike differential responses to drugs. \n\nOur complete explanatory job is to explain the observed\ncausal-statistical network by identifying the mechanisms and other\nforces that give rise to it, viz. the causal structure of disorders.\nThe problem, of course, is the sheer variety of the phenomena, which\ndoes not give us the degree of epistemic security we get when we sort\nphenomena into kinds in other sciences. One way to make this variety\ntractable, suggested by the natural history approach, is to look for\nsome stable phenomena that do not vary. These are not likely to be\nfound at the level of diagnoses, because in many cases two people with\nthe same diagnosis will exhibit different behaviours and other symptoms\ndepending on their personal lives, cultural background, other mental\nillnesses, and so on. There is too much variety at the level of\ndiagnosis. So we must search for smaller units of explanation. \n\nWe can think of this first approach as zooming-in on one small\nportion of the overall network, looking for a unit that has enough\nstability across histories to allow for an explanation in which there\nare cause-effect regularities; if the underlying causal structure is\ntoo diverse, look for causal units that stably replicate across\npatients, explain them, and then put these well-understood parts\ntogether to explain individuals. Another advantage of this approach is\nthat it promises to treat patients as individuals rather than clumping\ntogether into kinds that they only approximately fit. \n\nThis zoom-in approach is exemplified by Bentall (2005) and\nSpaulding et al (2003). They both look for the smallest unit of\nreliable explanation or manipulation. Spaulding et al. argue from a\nclinical perspective for seeing patients as collections of\n“problems”, with the problems in each case drawn from a\nrepertoire of clinically significant phenomena that different patients\nexemplify in different ways. Bentall argues that diagnoses like\ndepression or schizophrenia have proved helpless in the face of all the\nvariation that patients exhibit. He sees individual cases as\nmosaics made up of recurring symptoms like hallucinations, which can be\nseparated out and studied in isolation. According to this view, there\nis no such thing as schizophrenia. That’s not because there is\nnothing wrong with schizophrenics, but because schizophrenia is not a\nnatural kind. The natural kinds of psychiatry are specific pathologies\nthat schizophrenics display in shifting conjunctions. These are\ndistinct psychotic phenomena that should be approached separately and\ntreated as distinct symptoms or complaints. \n\nBentall thinks “we should abandon psychiatric diagnoses\naltogether and instead try to understand and explain the actual\nexperiences and behaviours of psychotic people” (2005, 141). But\nin fact he tries to relocate diagnosis at a more reliable level. For\nexample, Bentall (ch. 15) objects to the old model of inferring\nthought disorder on the basis of disordered speech.  His sees\ndisordered speech as a failure of communication, which is especially\nlikely when subjects are emotionally aroused. In Bentall’s tentative\nmodel, initial deficits in working memory caused by emotional arousal\ninteract with other deficits in semantic memory, theory of mind and\nintrospective monitoring. The result is a failure to communicate and a\nlack of self-awareness of one’s failure to communicate (which\ndistinguishes psychotic patients from normal subjects in the grip of\npowerful emotions who are struggling to get their ideas across). This\nis a stable phenomenon, in the sense that we can give the same causal\nstory in all cases of thought disorder, thus giving us a robust\naccount that transfers across patients. A general theory of\nschizophrenia would have too many qualifications and varieties to\ntransfer in this way. \n\nZooming-in faces two problems. First, where do we stop when looking\nfor smaller units? There is always the chance that some finer causal\ndiscrimination will uncover an even more stable structure. \n\nA proponent of zooming-in can always argue that the idea, as in any\nscience,\nis to develop the descriptive apparatus empirically in a way that\nultimately fits one’s theory of the domain. Bentall and Spaulding\net al. are betting that any clustering\nof problems or symptoms will not line up neatly with the DSM\ncategories, and this is probably a good bet for any approach.\nBentall’s chosen approach stresses the cognitive science of\npsychotic phenomena, whereas Spaulding et al. tend to look for\ncorrelations between clinically significant problems and a wider\nvariety of underlying phenomena; for Spaulding et al, the relevant\nsciences for identifying problems span many levels of analysis from the\nintra-cellular to the socio-cultural. Their examples include low levels\nof cortisol and learning deficits (127–130). \n\nNonetheless, there will always be differences across patients in the\nphenomena when we zoom in. This is likely to be\nespecially problematic when these independently characterised\nlower-level phenomena start to combine in actual patients. Zooming in\nshould not, therefore, be thought as an alternative to idealization,\nsince any search for commonalities across patients will involve some\ndegree of idealization. The rival approach is another form of\nidealization, but zooms out to think in terms if idealized patients,\nrather than idealized problems. \n\nZooming out begins by accepting that mental illness almost always\ndepends on complex interactions between diverse lower-level phenomena\nand tries to deal with this variety by treating disease networks as\nidealizations that are more or less similar to actual histories. It is\na recurring theme in the history of psychiatry that the textbook\nexpression of a disorder can be realized in individuals in different\nways. Charcot (1887–88) distinguished archetypes, which are\nideal types of disorder, from formes frustes, which are the\nimperfect forms the ideal type manifests in individual subjects.\nBirnbaum’s (1923) distinction between the pathogenic\nfeatures of a psychosis and its pathoplastic features is\nsimilar. The former define its essential structure, and the latter\nexpress the personal circumstances of the patient. \nMurphy (2006) argues that the variety in mental illness requires us to\nexplain psychiatric phenomena not by looking for stable regularities\nbut by constructing exemplars. Murphy sees the exemplar as an imaginary\npatient who has the ideal textbook form—something like\nThagard’s network, and the narrative it provides—of a disorder,\nand only that disorder, although the textbook needs to thought of as a\nstatement of the final theory, and not any current work in\npsychiatry. As with zooming-in, the approach assumes that\ncommonalities across patients will be revealed by inquiry. The\nidea is to model all the causes that contribute to a natural history so\nas to explore how they work together in different contexts to produce\nthe various outcomes of interest, and then understand patients as\nidiosyncratic instances of the exemplar. When we explain a disease, we\nconstruct an exemplar and model it. But the causal structure that\nexplains the exemplar resembles real world patients to varying degrees.\nSo when we talk about individuals we explain their symptoms by\nidentifying processes in the patient and showing how they resemble some\npart of the model. Godfrey-Smith (2006), following Giere, suggests that\nthere may not be a helpful general treatment of these resemblance\nrelations. They are not formal relations but the sort of comparisons\nbetween imaginary and real states of affairs that we all perform\neffortlessly. If there is a general theory, then, it is likely to be\nfound not by philosophers but by cognitive scientists studying\nanalogical thought (e.g. Hummel and Holyoak 2005). And because it is\ninstrumental concerns that drive our search for explanations in\npsychiatry, as in medicine more generally, the clinically significant\nrelations between disease, model and patient are likely to be highly\ncontext-specific; they will be determined in part by whether they offer\nopportunities for successful therapeutic interventions, which depend\nnot just on how the world is arranged, but also on what our resources\nand opportunities are. \n\nThe exemplar lets us identify robust processes (Sterelny\n2003, 131–2, 207–8) that are repeatable or systematic in various\nways, rather than the actual processes that occur as a disorder unfolds\nin one person. But we do not stop there: the ultimate goal is causal\nunderstanding of a disease. We build a model to serve this end. It aims\nto represent the pathogenic process that accounts for the observed\nphenomena in the exemplar. To explain an actual history in a patient is\nto show how the processes unfolding in the patient resemble those that\nare assumed to occur in the exemplar. Exemplars provide an idealized\nform of the disorder that aims to identify the factors that remain\nconstant despite all the individual variation. Not every part of a\nmodel will apply to a given patient. Once we understand the resemblance\nrelations that exist between parts of the model and the exemplar, we\ncan try to manipulate the model so as to change or forestall selected\noutcomes in the real world. \n\nIn commenting on this approach, Mitchell (2009) points out that her\nown work (2003) contains an alternative approach to model-based\nexplanation in complex sciences. Her “integrative\npluralism” aims to isolate individual causes and model them\nindividually, seeing how each makes a causal contribution on its own.\nTheorists then put together a collection of models of individual\nphenomena and try to integrate them by applying multiple models as\nseems necessary to explain a particular case. Mitchell’s approach\nresembles the zoom-in in its search for decomposing, but it tries to\nisolate causes that can recombine—such as genes or\ninterpersonal difficulties—rather than searching for explanations of\nparticular clinical phenomena like thought disorder (see also Tabery\n2009). This is similar to the way Spaulding et al. seek the development\nand integration of causal models in the service of developing a\ncomprehensive clinical understanding of people and their problems. \n\nMitchell (2009, 131) suggests that we might need both her models and\nMurphy’s as circumstances dictate. And there might be room for\nzoom-in models as well. There seems no reason why psychiatric research\ncould not aim to be pluralist about explanation and combine elements\ndrawn from all these explanatory styles as we learn more about what\nworks when we try to figure out mental illness. \nGhaemi (2003. ch 12) offers a different defense of zooming-out. He\nargues that current DSM diagnoses function as ideal types in\nWeber’s sense. One way to understand Weber’s idea is just\nas a forerunner of modelling, in which essential variables are isolated\nand inessential ones put aside. Ghaemi, though, locates it in a\ntradition of hermeneutic understanding that is most closely associated\nin psychiatry with Karl Jaspers (1997). This approach looks for\nmeaningful psychological connections between phenomena and is\ncontrasted with causal, scientific explanation. In Ghaemi’s view\nthe DSM categories are designed to foster understanding of this type by\ndirecting clinical attention to aspects of the patient’s life\nthat are relevant to the disorder at hand. He sees this as an\napplication of the methods of the humanities, rather than those of the\nsciences. \nOne argument that might be made against zooming-out is that it assumes\nthat mental disorders are categorical, rather than dimensional. The\nneo-Kraepelinian approach is often faulted for assuming that disorder\nis an all or nothing affair, whereas it might mark an extreme point on\na dimension that is present to a greater or lesser degree throughout\nthe population (Kendell 1975, McHugh and Slavney 1998, Poland et. al\n1994, Widiger and Sankis 2000). So schizophrenia might be seen either\nas condition that is present or not—just as one either is of\nvoting age or not. But we might also see it as like having high blood\npressure—marking a point on one or more dimensions where normal\npsychological traits become aggravated enough to constitute a\npopulation of clinical concern. Some psychiatrists have supported one\napproach or the other. Others, like Ghaemi (203), have argued that\nsome conditions, like the major psychoses and mood disorders, are\nprobably categorical, whereas other conditions, especially the\npersonality disorders, are dimensional. \nThis is clearly an empirical issue in the end, so if the zooming-out\napproach is committed to a categorical approach it is a cause for\nconcern. However, a zooming out approach could treat its models as end\npoints on a spectrum that usefully capture differences between\npopulations (Ghaemi, 199); this is compatible with looking for causal\nstories that explain the model. Furthermore, in so far as the\nzooming-in approach relies on idealizations too, it faces the same\nproblem. Bentall’s approach, for instance, faces the issue of\nwhat degree of language difficulties counts as pathological, and\nSpaulding et al. need to find a way of distinguishing a clinical\nproblem from a phenomenon that is normal but unwelcome. \n\nSuccessive editions of the DSM have been published in North America,\nand questions have always arisen about the applicability of its\ncategories outside the West. DSM-5 follows its predecessor in coping\nwith cross-cultural variety in two ways. First, some conditions, such\nas depression and anxiety, are treated as universal – found in\nevery culture, despite local differences in character. We may term\nthis the unificationist project. The DSM-IV-TR averred that major DSM\ncategories occur all around the world but with symptoms and courses\nthat are influenced by local cultural factors.  Second, DSM-IV-TR employed the concept of culture-bound syndromes, which were\ndefined as “recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant\nbehavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a\nparticular DSM-IV diagnostic category” (p. 898). Culture-bound\nsyndromes occur in a limited number of specific societies or cultural\nareas.  They are local, often traditional, diagnostic categories that\nmake sense of patterns of thought and behaviour that are treated as\ndeviant or troubling in that context.  \n\nIn theory, culture-bound syndromes are those folk illnesses in which\nalterations of behaviour and experience figure prominently, relative\nto local norms. Standard DSM diagnoses are not thought of in this way,\neven if they are culturally limited. Multiple Personality Disorder/\nDissociative Identity Disorder, for example, was widely diagnosed in\nthe USA in the 1980s, but seldom found elsewhere. That did not lead\npsychiatrists to treat it as a culture-bound syndrome, even though it\nseems to fit the definition. The assumption in mainstream psychiatry\nis that Western conditions are not culture-bound; they represent\nabnormalities in a universal human endowment. This is the case even\nfor conditions (such as some kinds of body dysmorphia) for which\nprevalence data only exists in a few western nations.  \n\nDSM-5 has moved away from concept of a culture-bound syndrome and\nadopted that of “cultural concepts of distress” (p.758).\nThese are ways in which “cultural groups experience, understand\nand communicate suffering, behavioural problems or troublesome\nthoughts and emotions”. DSM-5 distinguishes three main types of\ncultural concepts: syndromes, idioms (ways of expressing distress),\nand local explanations. The last is particularly interesting: a\nstandard picture of mental illness in both non-Western and premodern\nsocieties represents it as explained by supernatural forces like ghost\npossession. But Edgerton (1966) reported that the East African tribes\nhe studied were divided over the explanation of psychosis. Some tribes\ndid understand it in terms of ghost possession, but others thought of\nit as having an organic cause (“brain worms”). DSM-5 makes\nroom for such findings as part of the integration of local\nexplanations into a theory of mental illness. \n\nDSM-5 supplements this conceptual reform with a thorough overhaul of\nthe “Outline for Cultural Formulation”. This is an\ninterview outline introduced in DSM-IV-TR, in part in response to\npleas from cross-cultural psychiatrists dissatisfied with the old ways\n(e.g. Canino and Alegria 2008). It reflects an unprecedented\ninvestment in applying anthropology to psychiatry by the DSM-5\nCultural Issues Subgroup, who ran field trials of the new Cultural\nFormulation Interview (CFI) in 6 sites around the world (Aggarwal\n2013). The CFI is designed to assess both the cultural or ethnic\ngroups that the subject belongs to and the ways in which those groups\nunderstand the problem and affect the subject’s experience of\nit. It comprises a series of questions designed to gather information\nfrom the point of view of the patient and his or her cultural peers,\nincluding specific questions that tell the patient not to repeat what\nthe doctor has told them but to express their problems as they see\nthem and describe which aspects of their identity are most important\nto them. It could be used with any subject anywhere, and the manual\nacknowledges that all mental illness, including the DSM diagnoses, is\nshaped by the surrounding culture. On the other hand, the CFI and its\nassociated conceptual material are poorly integrated into the DSM-5\n– many diagnoses pay no attention to cultural formulation at all\n– and the culture-bound syndromes do in fact survive. They have\nbeen renamed “Cultural Concepts of Distress” but the\nappendix listing them survives, so one may wonder how thorough the\noverhaul has been. \n\nThe other approach to cultural variation, as mentioned, is to treat\ndifferent diagnoses as manifestations of the same underlying DSM\ncondition. The issue is how different a diagnosis needs to be before\nit stops being a form of a DSM condition and becomes a culture-bound\nsyndrome. It has been suggested that anxiety disorders, for example,\nshould have their “worry domains” expanded because people from other\ncultures may worry about things that Euro-Americans don’t fret\nover (Lewis-Fernandez et al 2010). The assumption here is that anxiety\ndisorders are common enough in all human cultures to merit treating as\na universal, but that this can be missed if clinicians do not\nappreciate the different triggers, reactions and conceptions that\ndistinguish the anxiety disorders in different populations. We need to\nrecognise the greater variety of symptoms among sufferers from anxiety\nwho live in Western cultures but don’t show the typical symptoms\nof a Westerner. Lewis-Fernandez and his team (2010) argue that a\nmajority of Latino sufferers from ataque de nervios would meet panic\ndisorder criteria, for example, if the DSM amended the requirement\nthat a panic attack lasts only a few minutes. Ataque de nervios was\nlisted as a culture-bound syndrome in DSM-IV-TR. Its symptoms commonly\ninclude a mix of classic panic attack symptoms like palpitations and\nsensations of bodily heat and loss of control. But it may also involve\nuncontrollable shouting and threats of violence, together with other\nsymptoms less often found in panic attacks, and it may last much\nloner. Lewis-Fernandez is interested in the idea that ataque de\nnervios can be assimilated to existing anxiety diagnoses provided we\ntake the variation in symptomatology more seriously. \n\nThis unificationist approach may be used to argue that the diagnostic\nentity itself is the same in all cases – some shared underlying\nprocess that adapts or responds to different cultural settings to\nproduce different behaviors. Some scholars argue that the underlying\nabnormality, even if it exists, is beside the point. Our response to\nthe condition should be determined by its expression, even if there is\nan underlying psychological kind. Kleinman argued that depression in\nthe West and in East Asia are different enough in their expression and\ncourse that they should be seen as different conditions (1987, 450):\n“Depression experienced entirely as low back pain and depression\nexperienced entirely as guilt-ridden existential despair are such\nsubstantially different forms of illness behavior with different\nsymptoms, patterns of help-seeking, course and treatment responses\nthat though the disease in each instance may be the same, the illness\nrather than the disease is the determinant factor.”  \n\nHorwitz and Wakefield (2007, p. 199) opt for universality in response:\n“we agree with Kleinman’s distinction between disease as a\nuniversal underlying dysfunction and illness as the culturally shaped\nexpression of a given dysfunction … [but] if there are indeed\nunderlying common dysfunctions, then treatment presumably depends in\nlarge part on the science of identifying and intervening in such\ndysfunctions irrespective of their cultural presentation.”  \n\nThe unificationist project is an empirical bet that is based on the\nassumption that human psychology is enough alike to treat at least\nsome culturally distinctive forms of mental disorder as expressions of\na shared human nature that is differently shaped by local culture. The\nappeal to culture bound syndromes is also a perfectly good bet,\nreflecting the idea that some forms of behaviour are entirely local\nand not assimilable to a universal model.  Both unificationism and\nrecognition of culture-bound syndromes could be pursued at the same\ntime. Given the boring but probably correct observation that people\naround the world are both alike and different, that may be the obvious\ncourse.  However, pursuit of these strategies should be freed from the\napparent assumption in DSM-5 that western minds are the blueprint for\nthe world. The western form of a condition may be unusual: the more we\nlook, the more it seems as though the cognitive aspects of depression\n– the complex psychology of self-blame and immiserating\nintrospection – may be distinctively Western. There may be\nconditions that DSM treats as universal but which in fact are\nculture-bound syndromes that only exist in NATO countries. \n\nPsychiatric models explain idealization of some sort. The point of it\nall, though, comes when that understanding lets us help patients.\nGuze (1992) calls this the move from the biological perspective to the\nclinical one. In making the move we shift from a general description\nof a disease process to a specific description of the biology of an\nindividual. The clinician takes the imaginary ideal patient and\nspecifies more real-world detail, so as to produce a description of a\nsmaller set of patients, perhaps even a single case. The scientific\nproject idealises, whereas the clinical one uses the resources of the\nscience to help individuals. In displaying causal relations that give\nrise to features of the model we present opportunities for therapeutic\naction, whether we have zoomed in or out. The model defines a set of\nrelations that differ from those present in a real patient along\nvarious dimensions. One is precision: the causal relations the model\nrepresents may need to be made more precise when we look at real\npatients. The degree to which a symptom is present, for example, might\nneed to be specified precisely in a clinical setting, whereas in the\nexemplar the symptom can be defined as inhabiting some range of\nvalues, any one of which might apply in nature. Or we can supply a\ndeterminate story that embraces the details of the beliefs and other\nintentional states of the patient, instead of just citing the fact\nthat a particular information-processing pathway is implicated in\npatients of that type. An important strand in recent philosophy,\nhowever, regards the key to successful understanding as humanistic or\nnon-reductive, and is skeptical about the chances of understanding\nmentally ill persons through the medium of research categories\ninspired by the medical model (Glover 2014: Tekin 2019)  \n\nA number of scholars in recent years have argued that existing\npsychiatry is flawed in terms of its philosophy of psychology, even if\none accepts the basic commitments of the medical model rather than a\nmore normative view. On this view, psychiatry has bought into several\nphilosophical mistakes, being unduly reductive or internalist. There\nare longstanding objections to psychiatry along these lines,\nincluding the idea that psychiatric disorders should not be assimilated\nto general medical conditions (Arpaly 2005, Graham 2009). But there are\nspecific criticisms within a broadly naturalistic approach to\nphilosophical psychopathology that we will review here. \nAn important development that is avowedly sceptical of the existing\nbiomedical paradigm in psychiatry is the rise of approaches inspired by\nthe 4E movement in philosophy of mind – the “embedded,\nembodied, extended and enactive” tradition. Many philosophers of\npsychology and cognitive scienctists dispute the viability of\nwhat they see as an unduly reductive and anti-environmental tradition\nof philosophical psychology. To this internalist tradition is\nattributed the view that the mind is confined to the ‘skin and\nskull’ of individual agents and that psychological processes and\ntheir pathologies are entirely explained by the brain and central\nnervous system. On this view, whatever is responsible for cognition is\nwholly within the agent, and thus can be studied while\n‘bracketing off’ an agent’s social and material\nenvironment. Externalists have argued that this tradition has both\ndriven and been reinforced by approaches to psychiatry that are too\nbrain-centred (Sneddon 2002, Roberts et al 2019) and lobby for greater\nattention to environmental or other extra-cranial factors.\n(Internalists, or proponents of traditional views of  cognition,\none should add, often disagree with this view of what they are\ncommitted to or find the commitments of 4E too vague to be helpful\n(Aizawa 2018, Rupert 2016)).  As well as externalists, the 4E\nmovement includes ‘embedded’ theorists who stress the\ndependency of minds on environmental scaffolding (Hutchins 1995) and\n“embodied” theorists who believe that bodies or aspects of\nthe wider environment are constitutive of mental states, and often that\nsensorimotor phenomena are constitutive parts of cognition, rather than\njust the input and output of cognition (or what Hurley (1998) calls the\n‘sandwich model’). Enactivism tends to be the more radical\nview that mental life can be explained via the dynamic interaction of\nnervous system, body and environment without reference to mental\nrepresentation (Hutto and Myin 2013). \nClark and Chalmers (1997) motivated the extended mind thesis using a\nthought experiment centring upon memory. Its protagonists, Otto and\nInga, each need to remember how to get to MOMA for an exhibition. Inga\nhas been to MOMA many times and gets there via introspective recall. But\nOtto has an impaired\ncapacity to produce, store and retrieve memories. To cope with this, he\ncarries a notebook containing important information. Otto routinely\nconsults and updates his notebook, he always carries it with him, and\nhe endorses its contents. A variant of this view holds that agents are\ntypically embedded in wider set of environmental and social phenomena,\nand that these exogenous factors are explanatorily vital and often\nneglected when it comes to cognition, but that cognition is\nintra-cranial. \nThe consensus among 4E proponents is that psychiatry is wedded to a\nnumber of outdated philosophical positions, although there is not\nalways agreement about what these positions are. Zoe Drayson\n(2009), for example, thinks that psychiatry is committed to old\nfashioned models of artificial intelligence that ignore embodiment,\nwhereas other theorists (Davies 2016) think that psychiatry is too\nneglectful of the environment, or has the wrong picture of explanation\nand causation (de Haan 2019). Indeed, it is unclear whether any\nparticular scientific research program derives from core 4E\ncommitments. One might see the movement as what Godfrey-Smith (2001)\ncalls a philosophy of nature or (in this case) a piece of philosophical\nanthropology (cf Gallagher 2017). As Godfrey-Smith puts it (2001,\np.284–5) a philosophy of nature comes after science, and aims to\ndescribe and interpret the world as disclosed by science. One can see\n4E as giving us a view of human nature that stresses the\ninterdependence of person and environment and emphasizes the dynamic\naspects of cognition, which is seen as a special kind of animacy.\nBecause of this variety within the movement it is not easy to construct\na core program for philosophical psychiatry that every scholar with\nsome 4E attachments would accept, but there are recurrent themes that\ncan be assessed here. \nTo begin with, many externalist approaches to psychiatry contest\nwhat they see as the basic ontological commitments of psychiatry when\nit comes to mental illness, by objecting to what is seen as a reductive\nor internalist thesis that psychiatric conditions are neurological\ndisorders. Competing conceptions of mental illness may accept that\npsychiatric conditions involve neural dysfunction in some sense, but\nthey argue that no psychic process, including pathological ones,\n“can be reduced to the brain or to localized neural activities:\nthey are embodied, inherently intentional, and context related”\n(Fuchs 2018, p. 253) \nThis claim can be made in ways that are more or less committed to 4E\nmachinery. It is possible, for example, to argue, as Levy (2007) does\nfor addiction, that a condition cannot be seen as a brain disorder\nbecause its symptoms only arise in specific social environments. Davies\n(2016) asserts that many psychiatric categories are committed to\n‘constitutive externalism’, by which he means that one\ncannot be diagnosed with those conditions unless one stands in certain\nrelations to features of the environment, including the social\nenvironment. This position could be adopted even if one has only very\nweak commitments in the 4E vein; it is based on claims about the\nrelations between subjects and environments rather than theories about\nthe nature of the mind. Furthermore, although Davies asserts that these\nfeatures distinguish psychiatry from somatic medicine, they plainly do\nnot. As Glackin notes (2017) each of Davies’ examples has\nparallels in somatic medicine. In a similar vein, Fuchs (2018) argues\nthat the tendency of contemporary psychiatry is to isolate the patient\nfrom their surroundings and study disorder independently of the\nenvironment. \nIt is not easy to evaluate claims like these, given that psychiatry\ndoes pay attention to social and biographical contingencies in a\npatient’s life. It may be that the force of the objection is that\nthese extra-cranial factors are acknowledged but not taken seriously in\ntreatment, which tends to be too much directed at aspects of the\ncondition inside the patient that can be addressed by drugs. In defence\nof psychiatry, one might point out that changing a patient’s\nbrain is often a lot easier than changing society or even the\npatient’s local environment or life circumstances. However, it\ndoes seem clear that prescinding from the details of the situation and\nassessing a patient in a context insensitive way does happen, and it\ncan be a source of problems. \nThe purpose of the Otto/Inga example is to challenge the assumption\nthat only processes that take place “in the head” are\npsychological. When Otto consults his diary, he has the occurrent\nbelief that MOMA is located on Fifty-third street. What the authors\nclaim, in addition to this, is that, like Inga, who remembers it\nunaided, Otto also has the dispositional belief that MOMA is located on\nFifty-third street before he consults his notebook. Otto’s\ncapacity for storage and retrieval of memories extends beyond the\nbrain, and encompasses the notebook as a resource, in the same way that\nInga’s storage and retrieval depends on neural resources. Drayson\nand Clark (2019) discuss cases in which sufferers of Alzheimer’s\ndisease perform poorly in standard tests but live alone successfully.\nTheir homes are carefully scaffolded by personalised mnemonic props,\nincluding post-it notes, labelled pictures, strategically placed items,\nand messaging centres. If we are interested in an accurate assessment\nof an agent’s mental health we will be led astray if we do not\nfind room in standard capacity tests for the role that an agent’s\nenvironment might play in their cognitive functioning. Further, the\nrole of the environment must also be considered in therapeutic\ncontexts: decisions to relocate subjects from their homes to\nresidential care facilities, for example, are typically accompanied by\ndecline in cognitive health. \nAccording to an internalist or scaffolded/situated approach,\nexternal artefacts (such as notebooks) or other agents (such as life\npartners) can only be props that compensate for an incapacity. On this\nview, Otto suffers from a deficit Inga does not have, and is thus less\nhealthy than she is. However, if we think, as externalists do, that\nOtto’s notebook is a part of his cognitive architecture, we\nshould attribute him the same capacity to remember as Inga, for the\nonly difference between Otto and Inga, in this respect, is that\nOtto’s psychological capacity is realised by an agent-environment\nsystem of which he is part. \n\nHoffman (2016) argues that the extended mind thesis thus has\nimplications for how we judge the mental health status of an agent,\nincluding whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for particular\ndisorders. Based on this discussion, we can draw a distinction between\nnarrow, situated and wide theories of mental disorder (Murphy, Donovan\nand Smart forthcoming). The narrow construal is strongly internalist:\nthe only genuine psychological capacities are those realized by\ncognitive architecture internal to the agent. The situated view\nconstrues psychological capacities as intimately dependent upon\nenvironmental states of affairs, and so prohibits methodological\nsolipsism. A full understanding of the capacities exercised require an\nunderstanding of agent-world dynamics. \nA wide account tells a different story. Otto’s mental health is not\ncompromised, whatever the state of  his brain, because using his\nnotebook he can store and retrieve memories in a functionally\nequivalent manner to Inga. Poor mental health can be the outcome of\nneural dysfunction, but it can also owe to problems with the\nenvironments in which agents are situated, as well as with their\ncapacity to fruitfully exploit environmental resources (Sneddon 2002;\nRoberts, Krueger, and Glackin 2019). The externalist claims that she\ncan discern types of explanations, interventions and strategies that an\ninternalist picture misses. \nThe medical model is widely believed to borrow the “common\ncause” structure of general medicine, in which observed variables\n(symptoms) indicate the existence of a latent variable that is their\ncause. The network model (Nuijten et al 2016), however, makes a very\ndifferent bet. Rather than an underlying cause or latent variable, it\nattributes the joint occurrence and course of the clustered symptoms to\nthe fact that they are part of the same network: “instead of\nbeing effects of a common cause, psychiatric symptoms have been argued\nto cause each other” (Borsboom 2017, p.5). This can be\nrepresented as a network  in which symptoms are nodes, and the\nconnections between nodes indicate causal relations, which we can\nunderstand using interventionist models of causation. \nEach symptom is a node, and a change in a node changes the\nprobability distribution of the other symptoms which are connected to\nthe original node. For example, difficulties in sleeping is likely to\nbe strongly connected to fatigue, and both nodes may be connected to\ndepressed mood, indicating that tired, sleep-deprived people are more\nlikely to feel down and feel bad about themselves. (The connections\ncould run in the other direction too, from low mood to difficulty\nsleeping.) Eventually we see a set of connections stabilizing the\nnetwork as the symptoms of depression switch each other on and even\nsymptom nodes that are not directly connected influence each other via\nshared neighbours (Borsboom 2017, p.6). \nThe intuitive appeal of the network model relies on the idea that\nstandard conceptions of medical disease, with their separation of\nunderlying condition and visible symptom, make no sense in psychiatry\nand are implausibly reductive (Borsboom et al 2019, Borsboom 2017).\nHowever, it has been argued in response that the (Bringmann and Eronen\n2018) network and latent variable models are not so easy to\ndistinguish, and that the choice between them is orthogonal to\nquestions of reductionism. Further, although a disease such as\ndepression cannot function as a part of the network, we can include in\nthe network neurological or genetic processes that are taken to be part\nof the underlying state, so that the line between networks and\ntraditional models is blurry. Bringmann and Eronen’s review of\nthe literature suggests that model choice should not be made on the\nbasis of background pictures of disease, but on the basis of other\nfactors, especially the dynamic relations among variables stressed by\nnetwork theorist. The philosophical appeal of a conception of mental\nillness by itself does not legitimate any choice of model.","contact.mail":"dominic.murphy@sydney.edu.au","contact.domain":"sydney.edu.au"}]
