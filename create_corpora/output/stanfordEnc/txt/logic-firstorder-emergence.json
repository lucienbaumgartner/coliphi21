It is\nsemantically complete; it is adequate to the axiomatization of all\nordinary mathematics; and Lindström’s theorem shows that it\nis the maximal logic satisfying the compactness and\nLöwenheim-Skolem properties. So it is not surprising that\nfirst-order logic has long been regarded as the “right”\nlogic for investigations into the foundations of mathematics. It\noccupies the central place in modern textbooks of mathematical logic,\nwith other systems relegated to the sidelines. The history, however,\nis anything but straightforward, and is certainly not a matter of a\nsudden discovery by a single researcher. The emergence is bound up\nwith technical discoveries, with differing conceptions of what\nconstitutes logic, with different programs of mathematical research,\nand with philosophical and conceptual reflection. So if first-order\nlogic is “natural”, it is natural only in retrospect. The\nstory is intricate, and at points contested; the following entry can\nonly provide an overview. Discussions of various aspects of the\ndevelopment are provided by Goldfarb 1979, Moore 1988, Eklund 1996,\nBrady 2000, Ferreirós 2001, Sieg 2009, Mancosu, Zach &\nBadesa 2010, Schiemer & Reck 2013, the notes to Hilbert [LFL], and\nthe encyclopedic handbook Gabbay & Woods 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modern study of logic is commonly dated to 1847, with the\nappearance of Boole’s Mathematical Analysis of Logic.\nThis work established that Aristotle’s syllogistic logic can be\ntranslated into an algebraic calculus, whose symbols Boole interpreted\nas referring either to classes or to propositions. His system\nencompasses what is today called sentential (or Boolean) logic, but it\nis also capable of expressing rudimentary quantifications. For\ninstance, the proposition “All Xs are Ys” is\nrepresented in his system by the equation \\(xy = x\\), with the\nmultiplication being thought of either as an intersection of sets, or\nas logical conjunction. “Some Xs are Ys” is\nmore difficult, and its expression more artificial. Boole introduces a\n(tacitly: non-empty) set V containing the items common to\nX and Y; the proposition is then written \\(xy =\nV\\) (1847: 21). Boole’s system, in modern terms, can be viewed\nas a fragment of monadic first-order logic. It is first-order because\nits notational resources cannot express a quantification that ranges\nover predicates. It is monadic because it has no notation for\nn-ary relations. And it is a fragment because it cannot express\nnested quantifications (“for every girl, there exists a boy who\nloves her”). But these are our categories: not Boole’s.\nHis logical system has no symbols corresponding to the quantifiers; so\neven to call it a restricted system of quantificational logic is\nanachronistic. \nThe two principal augmentations to Boole’s system that produced\na recognizably modern logic were (a) the introduction, in addition to\none-placed predicates (“x is mortal”), of\nmany-placed relations (“x is the brother of\ny”; “x lies between y and\nz”); and (b) the introduction of a notation for universal\nand existential quantification.  \nTwo logicians working in the Boolean tradition carried out these\nsteps. The first step was partially carried out by Augustus De Morgan\n(in De Morgan 1864). The second was carried out by C. S. Peirce (in\nPeirce 1885). Working entirely independently, Gottlob Frege carried\nout both steps simultaneously in his Begriffsschrift of 1879.\nThe subsequent history for several decades is a branching structure,\nwith numerous researchers working in different traditions and only\npartially aware of one another’s accomplishments. \nPeirce worked in the algebraic tradition of Boole. His first logic\npapers appeared in 1867;\nthey simplify Boole’s system, re-interpret union or logical\naddition \\(A+B\\) so that it applies also when A and B\nare not disjoint, correct several mistakes, and explore connections\nbetween logic, arithmetic, and algebra.  \nThree years later, in his “Description of a Notation for the\nLogic of Relatives” (1870) Peirce produced a major expansion of\nBoole’s system. De Morgan had pointed out (De Morgan 1864) that\nthe Aristotelian syllogistic was incapable of handling such inferences\nas, “If every man is an animal, then every head of a man is a\nhead of an animal”. De Morgan had introduced a logic of\nrelations, defined the converse and the contrary of a relation, and,\nfor relations such as “X is a lover of Y”\nand “Z is a servant of W”, had explored such\ncompositions of relations as “x is the lover of a servant\nof y”. This work successfully expanded the Aristotelian\nsyllogistic logic, but was also limited in several ways. First, De\nMorgan only operated with binary relations. Secondly, his notation was\nclumsy. (For example: if \\(X\\pdot\\pdot LY\\) designates that X\nis a lover of Y, then \\(X\\pdot LY\\) designates that X is\nnot a lover of Y. De Morgan has no separate sign for negation,\nnor for the Boolean propositional connectives.) \nPeirce noticed these shortcomings, and in 1870 showed how to extend\nBoole’s logic to cover  \nthe whole realm of formal logic, instead of being restricted to that\nsimplest and least useful part of the subject, the logic of absolute\nterms, which, when [Boole] wrote, was the only formal logic known.\n \nHe studied the composition of relations with each other and with\nclass-terms, and worked out the principal laws for the resulting\nabstract algebraic system, ultimately showing that the linear\nassociative algebras studied by his father (Benjamin Peirce, the\nHarvard mathematician) could all be defined in terms of what he called\n“elementary relatives”. His 1870 system, although a large\nadvance both on Boole and on De Morgan, remains notationally awkward,\nand in retrospect it is clear that it needed the theory of\nquantification. But it was the first successful attempt to extend\nBoole’s system into the logic of relations. \nIn 1880 Peirce described the procedure for reducing formulae of the\nsentential calculus to conjunctive and disjunctive normal form, and\nalso in unpublished work demonstrated that the sentential calculus can\nbe obtained from the single connective of joint denial (“neither\np nor q”). His 1881, “On the Logic of\nNumber”, examined the foundations of arithmetic, and analyzed\nthe natural numbers in terms of discrete, linearly ordered sets\nwithout a maximum element. He gave informal recursive definitions of\naddition and multiplication, and proved that both operations were\nassociative and commutative. \nIn two remarkable papers, the short note 1883 and the longer “On\nthe Algebra of Logic” of 1885, he introduced a modern notation\nfor what he was the first to call the “quantifier”. He\nviewed his quantifiers (for which he used the symbols \\(\\Pi\\) and\n\\(\\Sigma)\\) as a generalization of the Boolean connectives, with the\nuniversal quantifier \\(\\Pi\\) being interpreted as a (possibly\ninfinite) conjunction, so that \\(\\Pi_x P(x)\\) is understood as\n“a is P and b is P and c is\nP and …”. Similarly the existential quantifier\n\\(\\Sigma\\) is understood as a (possibly infinite) sum: “a\nis P or b is P or c is P or\n…”. This flexible \\(\\Pi\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) notation allowed\nhim easily to express nested quantifications to any desired depth.\nThus, in his notation, if \\(l_{ij}\\) represents “i is a\nlover of j”, \\(\\Sigma_i \\Sigma_j\\) \\(l_{ij}\\) tells us\nthat somebody loves somebody, whereas \\(\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j\\) \\(l_{ij}\\)\ntells us that everybody loves somebody. (The \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\)\nnotation is of course intended, in a Boolean spirit, to emphasize the\nanalogy to arithmetical sums and products.) \n“On the Algebra of Logic” is remarkable for other reasons\nas well. It begins with an important passage (§2) on the\npropositional calculus, containing the first explicit use of two truth\nvalues. Peirce then describes a decision procedure for the calculus:\n \n[T]o find whether a formula is necessarily true substitute\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) for the letters and see whether it\ncan be supposed false by any such assignment of values. (1885: 191)\n \nHe gives a defense of material implication, and shows how to define\nnegation in terms of implication and a special symbol for absurdity.\nIn the next section (§3) he treats what he calls, following the\nSchoolmen, the “first-intentional logic of relations”. It\nis here that he coins the term “quantifier”; the\npropositional matrix of a quantified formula he calls its\n“Boolian”. In this section the quantifiers range only over\nthe individuals of the universe; the “first-intentional\nlogic” is thus first-order. Here, too, he was the first to\ndiscuss the rules for transforming a quantified formula into prenex\nnormal form. The following section (§4) is headed\n“second-intentional logic”. There is a clear demarcation\nfrom the first-intentional logic of §3. Here the quantifiers are\npermitted to range over predicates; and he uses his new notation to\nstate the modern second-order definition of identity: two objects are\nidentical just in case they satisfy the same predicates. \nPeirce’s paper was in many respects far ahead of its time. His\nsharp distinction between propositional, first-intentional, and\nsecond-intentional logical systems was not to be equaled in clarity\nuntil Hilbert in his lectures of 1917/18. Peirce was also prescient in\nviewing the quantifiers as (possibly infinite) sums and products, a\nnotation which Löwenheim was to credit with making possible the\ndiscovery of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, and which was to play\na significant role in the formulation of Hilbert’s\nproof-theoretic program in the 1920s. (Peirce’s logical ideas\nwere well-known in continental Europe, having been taken up by Ernst\nSchröder and given wide circulation in the three volumes of his\nAlgebra der Logik (1890–95).)  \nPeirce drew these various distinctions—and, in particular, the\ndistinction between first-order and second-order logic—with\ngreater clarity than any logician until Hilbert’s lectures in\n1917. And, unlike Hilbert, Peirce was steeped in the writings of the\nmedieval logicians. He fully appreciated the philosophical\nsignificance of the arguments about the reality of universals: this is\nclearly why he drew such a sharp differentiation between the logic of\n§2 and that of §3. It was thus open to him to make (or, at\nleast, to consider) a nominalist argument on behalf of first-order\nlogic, and against second-order logic. But apart from a few incidental\nremarks, he himself did not further develop his observations on\nsecond-intentional logic, and it seems likely that the modern\ndistinction between first-order and higher-order logic was a\nre-discovery made independently in 1917/18 by Hilbert, rather than\nbeing directly inspired by Peirce. \nFrege’s logical contributions grew out of a different soil, and\nwere made (as far as can be determined) entirely independently of the\nAnglo-American algebraic tradition of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce.\nInstead they have their root in the work on the foundations of real\nanalysis by such German mathematicians as Dirichlet, Riemann,\nWeierstrass, and Heine. From this tradition Frege took, first, the\nidea of providing a rigorous foundation for mathematics (a project\nthat, in his hands, became the project of showing that arithmetic can\nbe grounded in the laws of logic); and, secondly, the central\nmathematical concepts of function and variable,\nwhich he employed in place of the Aristotelian concepts of\npredicate and subject. This latter step led him\nnaturally to a logic of relations (since the functions considered in\nmathematics were multivariate); and his analysis of mathematical\ninference also led him to introduce a notation for quantificational\nlogic. (Mathematicians such as Weierstrass, in his analysis of the\nlimit concept, was already sensitive to the “nesting” of\nquantifiers, and the importance of their ordering: to the difference,\nfor example, between saying “for every \\(\\varepsilon\\) there\nexists a \\(\\delta\\)”, and “there exists a \\(\\delta\\) such\nthat for every \\(\\varepsilon\\)”. What was required now, and what\nFrege supplied, was a formal language to express and make explicit the\nquantificational inferences already present in the work of the German\nanalysts.) So, at a single stroke, in the Begriffsschrift of\n1879, Frege took the two major steps beyond traditional\nlogic—relations and quantifiers—that the algebraic\ntradition had taken separately and decades apart.  \nFrege’s logical system had several advantages over Peirce. His\naxiomatic presentation of a purely syntactic calculus was considerably\nmore precise, and his analysis of the number concept went deeper. His\nsystem permitted both variables and functions to be quantified. This\nwas a central component of his program for providing a logical\nfoundation for arithmetic, since, in his logical system, identity,\ncardinal number, and mathematical induction were all defined\nvia higher-order quantifications. In his Grundlagen\n(1884) he distinguishes between concepts of different order, so that\nif concept A falls under concept B, then B is of\n“second-order” (§53). In the more technical treatment\nin his Grundgesetze (1893) he considered third-order\nquantifications, though his actual derivation of arithmetic proceeded\nentirely within second-order logic. \nFrege was thus one of the first logicians to recognize the importance\nof a hierarchy of logical levels. His discovery was virtually\nsimultaneous with Peirce’s, and arrived at entirely\nindependently, in pursuit of different goals. Frege’s discovery\nwas to have the greater impact. It formed the basis for\nRussell’s theory of types (and also, decades later, influenced\nCarnap, who studied logic with Frege). \nBut although Frege distinguished between logical levels, he did not\nisolate the portion of his quantificational system that ranges only\nover variables of the first order as a distinct system of logic: nor\nwould it have been natural for him to have done so. In this respect,\nthere is a significant contrast with Peirce. Frege’s project was\nto show that arithmetic could be grounded in the laws of logic: for\nhim, there was only one logic, and logic necessarily included the\nlogic of higher-order concepts. Peirce, in contrast, rejected the\nnotion of a single, over-arching logic, instead thinking in terms of\nlogics that vary according to the “universe of discourse”.\nLargely for this reason he came closer in his 1885 paper to isolating\nthe propositional calculus, the “logic of first\nintention”, and the “logic of second intention” as\ndistinct systems, each worthy of study in its own right: in that\nregard, he was closer to modern conceptions than was Frege. There is a\nfurther and subtler difference. Peirce’s \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\)\nnotation for the quantifiers was explicitly conceived of in terms of\n(possibly infinite) conjunctions and disjunctions of propositions\nabout individuals. This is a highly suggestive conception that is hard\nto represent in Frege’s system of notation. Löwenheim was\nto exploit it in his early work in model theory, leading to technical\ndiscoveries that were ultimately to call attention to first-order\nlogic. But all this work lay decades in the future, and neither Frege\nnor Peirce can be credited with a modern understanding of the\ndifference between first-order and higher-order logics. \nFrege’s contributions were not immediately understood or\nappreciated, and in the closing decade of the century logic was\ndominated by the three volumes of Ernst Schröder’s\nVorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik (1890–95).\nSchröder provided an encyclopedic treatment of the logical work\nof Boole and Peirce, systematizing and extending their results.\nPeirce’s quantifiers make their appearance in volume two, but\nthe distinction between first-and second-order quantification is not\ndrawn with comparable clarity. As Frege pointed out in his review\n(1895), Schröder’s notation did not distinguish set\nmembership from the subset relation, and as a result it can be\ndifficult to tell whether he intends a given quantification to range\nover the subsets of a domain (i.e., to be second-order) or over its\nelements (i.e., to be first-order). Schröder employs both\nsecond-order and first-order quantifications; and in his third volume\nhe used the technique of expanding a second-order quantification into\nan infinite product of first-order quantifications—a technique\nthat was a development of the Peircian product notation, and that was\nto furnish the starting point for the investigations of\nLöwenheim. But Schröder does not extract from his wider\nsystem a sub-system of first-order logic, and does not treat the\ndistinction of orders as itself being of any great significance,\neither mathematically or philosophically. In this sense, he is less\nclear than Peirce’s paper of 1885. (A helpful analysis of\nSchröder’s logical work is contained in Brady 2000.) \nIn his 1889, Giuseppe Peano, independently of Peirce and Frege,\nintroduced a notation for universal quantification. If a and\nb are propositions with the free variables \\(x, y, \\ldots\\),\nthen \\(a \\mathbin{\\revc_{x, y,\\ldots}} b\\) symbolized: Whatever \\(x,\ny, \\ldots\\), may be, from the proposition a one deduces\nb. One hesitates to call this a notation for the universal\nquantifier, since the quantification is not severable from the sign\nfor material implication: notationally, this is a considerable step\nbackwards from Peirce. Peano moreover does not distinguish first-order\nfrom second-order quantification. The point of his essay was to\npresent the principles of arithmetic in logical symbolism, and his\nformulation of the principle of mathematical induction can be seen, by\nour lights, to be second-order: but only tacitly. This was a\ndistinction to which (again unlike Peirce) he seems to have attached\nno importance. He did, however, add a range of new symbols to\nmathematical logic which were to be influential on the work of\nWhitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica; and one of\nthe symbols was the notation \\(\\exists\\) for the existential\nquantifier. (Oddly, Peano did not introduce a parallel symbol for the\nuniversal quantifier. It seems to have been Whitehead who introduced\nthe \\((x)\\) notation in Principia, and Hilbert who introduced\nthe symbol \\(\\forall\\).) \nRussell’s discovery in 1901 of the Russell Paradox led him\nwithin a few months, in a letter to Frege (Frege [PMC]: 144) to propose\na tentative version of the theory of types. The central idea he took\nfrom Frege’s theory of functions of the first, second, and\nhigher orders. Russell presented a version of his theory in an\nappendix to the Principles of Mathematics (1903), and then in\na mature form in his “Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory\nof Types” (1908), which provided the conceptual underpinnings\nfor Principia Mathematica. Russell views the universe as\nstriated into levels or types. The first type comprises the\nindividuals; the second type comprises the “first-order”\npropositions whose quantifiers range over the individuals of the first\ntype; in general, the quantifiers in propositions of the n+1st\ntype range over propositions of the nth type. Russell’s\nsystem in fact comprises two distinct hierarchies: one to deal with\nthe paradoxes of set theory (specifically, to prohibit sets from being\nelements of themselves); the other to deal with the semantical\nparadoxes (such as the paradox of the liar). This dual structure,\nbranching in two directions, gives his theory the name “ramified\ntheory of types”. In order to be able to establish classical\nanalysis, he was forced to adopt the axiom of reducibility, which\nprovides that any function of level \\(n+1\\) is coextensive with a\npredicate of function of lower level. The system was immensely\ncomplicated; in time, at the hands of Chwistek, Ramsey, Carnap,\nTarski, and Church, it was recognized that the hierarchy dealing with\nthe semantical paradoxes could be pruned away, leaving the\n“simple theory of types”. (A survey of this evolution can\nbe found in Church 1974, and detailed examinations of Russell’s\ntheory in Landini 1998 and Linsky 2011.) \nRussell and Whitehead thus possessed a notation for the two\nquantifiers, as well as a distinction between quantifications of the\nfirst and higher types. But this is not the same as\npossessing a conception of first-order logic, conceived as a\nfree-standing logical system, worthy of study in its own right. There\nwere essentially two things blocking the way. First (and in contrast\nto Peirce), their object of study was not multiple logical systems,\nbut logic tout court: they show no interest in splitting off\na fragment for separate study, let alone in arguing that the\nfirst-order fragment enjoys a privileged status. On the contrary: as\nwith Frege, the ambition of Principia was to demonstrate that\nmathematics can be reduced to logic, and for Whitehead and Russell\nlogic encompassed the full apparatus of ramified type theory (together\nwith the axioms of infinity, choice, and reducibility). Secondly,\nalthough Principia provided an axiomatization of type theory\n(and thus can be viewed as specifying a conception of deductive\nconsequence), Whitehead and Russell thought of their system as an\ninterpreted system, stating the truths of logic, rather than\nas a formal calculus in the sense of Hilbert. Hilbert was to use their\naxiomatization as the starting-point for his own axiomatizations of\nvarious systems of logic; but until the distinction between logic and\nmetalogic had been formulated, it did not naturally occur to anybody\nto pose the metalogical questions of completeness, consistency, and\ndecidability, or to investigate such matters as the relationship\nbetween deductive and semantic completeness, or failures of\ncategoricity; and it was only once such notions became the focus of\nattention that the significance of first-order logic became\napparent. \nIn 1915, Löwenheim published his landmark “Über\nMöglichkeiten im Relativkalkül”. This paper, written\nin the tradition of the Peirce-Schroeder calculus of relatives,\nestablished the first significant metalogical theorem; from certain\npoints of view, it marks the beginning of model theory. Löwenheim\nconsidered a class of what he called “counting\nexpressions” (Zählausdrücke) whose\nquantifiers range only over the domain of objects in the universe, but\nnot over relatives; he then proved that, for any such counting\nexpression, if it is satisfiable, it is satisfiable in some\ndenumerable domain. In modern terminology, his “counting\nexpressions” are formulas of first-order logic; but his\nterminology shows no influence either from Peirce’s logic of\n“first intention”, or from Russell’s theory of\ntypes. Löwenheim, like all logicians of this era, did not possess\nthe distinction between an object language and a metalanguage. His\nproof is difficult to follow, and the precise details of his\ntheorem—of what he believed he had proved, and what he had, in\nfact, proved—have been the subject of extensive scholarly\ndiscussion. (A survey of the differing interpretations is provided by\nMancosu, Zach, & Badesa 2009, and a detailed reconstruction of the proof itself by\nBadesa 2004.) The paper appears to have had no influence until Skolem\nsharpened and extended its results in his 1920. Löwenheim, like\nPeirce and Russell, did not isolate an axiomatic system encompassing\nfirst-order logic, nor did he draw a distinction between syntax and\nsemantics. Still less does he argue that his class of “counting\nexpressions” is in some way logically privileged, and provides a\nfavored foundation for mathematics. The Löwenheim theorem was in\ntime to be recognized as isolating a fundamental property of\nfirst-order logic. But the full implications of his result were not to\nbecome clear until later, after Hilbert had introduced the\nmetamathematical study of logical systems. (Incidentally,\nLöwenheim credited the elegant \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\) symbolism\nof Peirce for suggesting the infinitary expansions that were necessary\nto his proof; and it is difficult to see how he could have obtained\nhis theorem with any of the other quantificational notations then on\noffer. He was still vigorously defending the advantages of the\nPeirce-Schroeder notation against the notation of Principia\nas late as Löwenheim 1940.) \nLet us briefly take stock of the situation as it existed in 1915.\nPeirce had differentiated between first-order and second-order logic,\nbut had put the distinction to no mathematical use, and it dropped\nfrom sight. Both Frege and Russell had formulated versions of\nmulti-level type theory, but neither had singled out the first-order\nfragment as an object worthy of study. The American postulate\ntheorists, Edward Huntington and Oswald Veblen, had formulated various\nnotions of completeness and categoricity, and Veblen had remarked that\naxiomatic deducibility might diverge from semantic implication (Awodey\n& Reck 2002: 15–19). But Veblen did not possess a precise\ncharacterization of formal deduction, and his observation remained\ninert. Löwenheim had proved a deep theorem about what in\nretrospect could be characterized as first-order formulas,\nbut had not isolated a system of first order logic. A similar\npoint holds for Hermann Weyl, who in 1910 proposed (in effect) to use\nfirst-order logic to make precise the concept of “definite\nproperty” in Zermelo’s axiom of separation. But this, too,\nis a retrospective characterization, and Weyl’s interest was in\nset theory, not in the study of a system of first-order logic. \nThe next large step was taken by David Hilbert in his lecture course\nPrinzipien der Mathematik, delivered in Göttingen in the\nwinter semester of 1917/18. Hilbert had lectured and published on\nfoundational topics in the years 1899–1905; in the intervening\ntime, as he concentrated on other matters, the publications had\nceased, though the extensive classroom lecturing continued. He kept up\nwith current developments, and in particular was informed about the\nlogical work of Whitehead and Russell, largely through his student\nHeinrich Behmann. In September, 1917, he delivered his programmatic\nlecture “Axiomatisches Denken” in Zürich calling for\nan axiomatic treatment of logic along the lines he had earlier\nexplored in his axiomatization of geometry, and explicitly proposing\nmetalogical investigations: \nWhen we consider the matter more closely, we soon recognize that the\nquestion of the consistency for integers and for sets is not one that\nstands alone, but that it belongs to a vast domain of difficult\nepistemological questions which have a specifically mathematical tint:\nfor example (to characterize this domain of questions briefly), the\nproblem of the solvability in principle of every mathematical\nquestion, the problem of the subsequent checkability of the results of\na mathematical investigation, the question of a criterion of\nsimplicity for mathematical proofs, the question of the relationship\nbetween content and formalism in mathematics and logic, and finally\nthe problem of the decidability of a mathematical question in a finite\nnumber of operations. (Hilbert 1917: 412–413) \nIt was on this trip to Zürich that he invited Paul Bernays to\nreturn to Göttingen as his assistant in foundational matters.\nAlthough Bernays had little previous experience in foundations, this\nturned out to be a shrewd choice, and the beginning of a close and\nfruitful research partnership. \nThe Göttingen lectures that shortly followed the Zürich\naddress (and that were recorded in an official protocol by Bernays)\nare a remarkable document, and mark the birth of modern mathematical\nlogic. They are substantially the same as the published monograph\nknown as “Hilbert and Ackermann” (1928), and even today,\nwith modest supplementation, could serve as an introductory textbook\nfor logic. Hilbert for the first time clearly distinguishes\nmetalanguage from object language, and step-by-step presents a\nsequence of formal logical calculi of gradually increasing strength.\nEach calculus is carefully studied in its turn; its strengths and its\nweaknesses are identified and balanced, and the analysis of the\nweaknesses is used to prepare the transition to the next calculus. He\nbegins with the propositional calculus, then moves to monadic\nquantificational logic (with an extended discussion of the calculus of\nclasses, and of the Aristotelian syllogism), and then to the\n“function calculus”.  \nThe function calculus is a system of (many-sorted) first-order logic,\nwith variables for sentences as well as for relations. It is here, for\nthe first time, that we encounter a precise, modern formulation of\nfirst-order logic, clearly differentiated from the other calculi,\ngiven an axiomatic foundation, and with metalogical questions\nexplicitly formulated. Hilbert concludes his discussion of first-order\nlogic with the remark:  \nThe basic discussion of the logical calculus could cease here if we\nhad no other end in view for this calculus than the formalization of\nlogical inference. But we cannot be satisfied with this application of\nsymbolic logic. Not only do we want to be able to develop individual\ntheories from their principles in a purely formal way, but we also\nwant to investigate the foundations of the mathematical theories\nthemselves and examine how they are related to logic and how far they\ncan be built up from purely logical operations and concept formations;\nand for this purpose the logical calculus is to serve us as a tool.\n(1917/18: 188) \nThis leads him next to introduce higher-order logic, and thence to a\nconsideration of logical paradoxes and their resolution through\nRussell’s ramified theory of types; the axiom of reducibility is\nbriefly discussed and adopted as a foundation for mathematics. The\nlecture protocol ends with the sentence:  \nThus it is clear that the introduction of the Axiom of Reducibility is\nthe appropriate means to turn the calculus of levels into a system out\nof which the foundations for higher mathematics can be developed.  \nThis sentence appeared essentially unchanged when the 1917 lectures\nwere re-worked as the monograph (Hilbert & Ackermann 1928). \nIn the course of his lectures, Hilbert addresses the metalogical\nquestions he had stated in “Axiomatisches Denken”, and (at\nleast tacitly) shows how the questions of completeness, consistency,\nand decidability are to be answered for the propositional case. The\ncompleteness question for first-order logic is not explicitly raised\nin Bernays’s record of the lectures, though an attentive reader\nwould easily have recognized it as an open problem. The following\nsummer, Bernays produced a Habilitation thesis in which he\ndeveloped, with full rigor, a Hilbert-style, axiomatic analysis of\npropositional logic. He presents the axiomatic system as an\nuninterpreted formal calculus; provides it with a semantics; and then\nproves the completeness theorem linking the syntax to the semantics in\nthe form, “Every provable formula is universally valid, and vice\nversa”. He then proceeds to investigate questions of\ndecidability, consistency, and the mutual independence of various\ncombinations of axioms. \nThe Hilbert 1917 lectures and the 1918 Bernays Habilitation are a milestone in the\ndevelopment of first-order logic. In the lectures, for the first time,\nfirst-order logic is presented in its own right as an axiomatic\nlogical system, suitable for study using the new metalogical\ntechniques. It was those metalogical techniques that represented the\ncrucial advance over Peirce and Frege and Russell, and that were in\ntime to bring first-order logic into focus. But that did not happen at\nonce, and a great deal of work still lay ahead. In the 1917/18\nlectures Hilbert’s sequence of logical calculi were presented as\nstepping-stones on the way to full higher-order ramified type theory,\nwhich he continued to regard as the “right” logical\nframework for investigating the foundations of mathematics. It was\ncharacteristic of Hilbert to break complex mathematical phenomena into\ntheir elements: the sequence of calculi can be viewed as a\ndecomposition of higher-order logic into its simpler component parts,\nrevealing to his students precisely the steps that went into the\nbuilding of the full system. Although he discusses the functional\ncalculus, he does not single it out for special attention. In other\nwords (and as with Peirce three decades earlier) first-order logic is\nintroduced primarily as an expository device: its importance was not\nyet clear. \nMoreover, Hilbert’s own treatment of the metalogical issues is\nsomewhat hasty and informal. He experiments with several versions of\nthe concept of “completeness”: one has the sense that he\nwas rapidly breaking new ground, and was not yet certain which\nconcepts would prove the most fruitful. His proof of the completeness\nof propositional calculus is a mere sketch, and relegated to a\nfootnote; the parallel problem for first-order logic is not even\nraised as a conjecture. Even more strikingly, when Bernays eventually\nin 1926 published his Habilitation, he omitted his proof of the\ncompleteness theorem because (as he later ruefully said) the result\nseemed at the time straightforward and unimportant. (For discussion of\nthis point, see Hilbert [LFL]: 229. For readily available general\ndiscussions, see Sieg 1999, Zach 1999, and the essays collected in Sieg 2013; for the original\ndocuments and detailed analysis, see Hilbert [LFL.) \nIn other words, even in Göttingen in the 1920s a full\nunderstanding of the significance of the ideas Hilbert had introduced\nin 1917 was missing. The Hilbert school throughout the 1920s regarded\nfirst-order logic as a fragment of type theory, and made no argument\nfor it as a uniquely favored system. It was not until the monograph\nHilbert & Ackermann 1928 (and the contemporaneous “Bologna\nLecture”, Hilbert 1928) that Hilbert explicitly called attention\nto the completeness of first-order logic as an open question. That set\nthe stage for the work of Gödel: but before coming to that, we\nneed to take a chronological step backwards.  \nSkolem in the winter of 1915–16 visited Göttingen, where he\ndiscussed set theory with Felix Bernstein; there is no sign that he\nmet Hilbert. He was already at this time familiar with\nLöwenheim’s theorem, and knew of its paradoxical\nimplications for Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory:\nspecifically, that a first-order axiomatization of the theory of\nnon-denumerable sets would have a denumerable model. He did not at the\ntime publish on these topics because, as he later said: \nI believed that it was so clear that the axiomatization of set theory\nwould not be satisfactory as an ultimate foundation for mathematics\nthat, by and large, mathematicians would not bother themselves with it\nvery much. To my astonishment I have seen recently that many\nmathematicians regard these axioms for set theory as the ideal\nfoundation for mathematics. For this reason it seemed to me that the\ntime had come to publish a critique. (Skolem 1922: appendix.) \nSkolem’s first major papers were his 1920 and especially his\n1922. In the first he proved (or re-proved) in a more perspicuous form\nthe downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. In the second he provided\na new proof of that result. He also criticized Zermelo’s axiom\nof separation, which had taken the form: Given a set S and a\ndefinite proposition \\(\\phi(x)\\), there exists a set\nS’ of all elements s of S such\nthat \\(\\phi(s)\\). Here the concept of “definite\nproposition” was left somewhat imprecise. Skolem’s\nproposal was to identify “definite propositions” with the\nformulas of first-order logic (with identity). Although Skolem\ndeclared this identification to be “natural” and\n“completely clear”, he did not explicitly argue for the\nrestriction of quantifiers to the first level. He then gave the\nearliest satisfactory first-order formulation of Zermelo’s set\ntheory, and then applied the Löwenheim-Skolem result to obtain\nthe Skolem paradox.  \nThese technical results were of great importance for the subsequent\ndebate over first-order logic. But it is important not to read into\nSkolem 1922 a later understanding of the issues. Skolem at this point\ndid not possess a distinction between the object language and the\nmetalanguage. And although in retrospect his axiomatization of set\ntheory can be interpreted to be first-order, he nowhere emphasizes\nthat fact. (Indeed, Eklund (1996) presents a compelling argument that\nSkolem did not yet clearly appreciate the significance of the\ndistinction between first-order and second-order logic, and that the\nreformulation of the axiom of separation is not in fact as\nunambiguously first-order as it is often taken to be.)  \nSkolem’s remarks about first-order logic require careful\ninterpretation (see, e.g., Ferreirós 2001: 470–74), but\nclearly must be viewed against the backdrop of the\nGrundlagenkrise of the 1920s, and of the debates between\nHilbert, Brouwer, and Weyl. There are two broad tendencies within\nlogic during these years, and they pull in opposite directions. One\ntendency is towards pruning down logical and mathematical\nsystems so as to accommodate the criticisms of Brouwer and his\nfollowers. The aim was to avoid the paradoxes, to delimit the\nterritory of “legitimate” mathematics, and to place it on\nsecure foundations. Set theory was in dispute, and Skolem explicitly\npresented his 1922 results as a critique of set theoretical\nfoundations. Weyl already in 1910 had been led by his examination of\nZermelo’s system to formulate a set of logical principles that\nin retrospect (and despite the idiosyncratic notation) can be seen to\nbe a form of first-order logic. In general, both Weyl and Skolem\ninclined, on methodological grounds, towards some sort of\nconstructivism as a means of avoiding the paradoxes; and this meant\nthat they viewed quantification over, say, the totality of subsets of\nan infinite set as something to be avoided: whatever one’s grasp\non the notion of “all integers”, the notion of “all\nproperties of integers” was far less firm. To put the matter\nslightly differently: the very point of axiomatizing set theory was to\nstate its philosophically problematic assumptions in such a way that\none could clearly see what they came to. But this aim would be\ncompromised if one already presupposed in the background logic the\nproblematical notion of “all subsets” that one was\nattempting to elucidate. One possibility was to restrict oneself to\nfirst-order logic; another, to adopt some sort of predicative\nhigher-order system. \nSimilar broadly constructivist tendencies were also very much in\nevidence in the proof theoretical work of Hilbert and Bernays and\ntheir followers in the 1920s. Already by the time of Hilbert’s\n1921/22 lectures Hilbert had identified the introduction of the\n(classical) quantifiers as the crucial step where the transfinite\nentered logic. Hilbert, like C. S. Peirce long before, thought of the\nquantifiers as infinite conjunctions and disjunctions, and from the\nearly 1920s onwards it was well understood in Göttingen that, for\nthe programmatic goals of the Hilbert consistency program to be\ncarried out, a finitary analysis of the quantifiers was necessary. The\nepsilon-substitution method was the principal device Hilbert\nintroduced in order to attempt to attain this result. (A survey of\nthis research is provided by Sieg 2009 and in the introductory notes\nto Hilbert [LFL].) \nBut despite these constructive tendencies, many logicians of the 1920s\n(including Hilbert) continued to regard higher-order type theory, and\nnot its first-order fragment, as the appropriate logic for\ninvestigations in the foundations of mathematics. The ultimate hope\nwas to provide a consistency proof for the whole of classical\nmathematics (including set theory). But, in the meanwhile, researchers\nstill were somewhat unclear about certain basic distinctions. Hilbert\nat times fails to observe the distinction between a first-order\naxiom-schema and a second-order axiom; Brouwer’s intuitionism is\nsometimes identified with “finitism”; the relationships\nbetween completeness (in several senses), categoricity (also in\nseveral senses), and first-order and higher-order logic were not yet\nunderstood. Indeed, Gregory Moore points out that even Gödel, in\nhis 1929 proof of the completeness of first-order logic, did not fully\nunderstand the notion of categoricity and its relationship to\nsecond-order logic (Moore 1988: 125). \nSo matters remained unclear throughout the 1920s. But the\nconstructivist ambitions of the Hilbert school, the focus on the\nanalysis of the quantifiers, and the explicit posing of metalogical\nquestions had made the emergence of first-order logic as a system\nworthy of study in its own right all but inevitable. The crucial\ntechnical breakthroughs came in 1929 and 1931 with the publication, by\nGödel, first, of the completeness theorem for first-order logic,\nand then of the incompleteness theorems. With these results (and\nothers that soon followed) it finally became clear that there were\nimportant metalogical differences between first-order logic and\nhigher-order logics. Perhaps most significantly, first-order logic is\ncomplete, and can be fully formalized (in the sense that a sentence is\nderivable from the axioms just in case it holds in all models).\nFirst-order logic moreover satisfies both compactness and the downward\nLöwenheim-Skolem property; so it has a tractable model theory.\nSecond-order logic does not. By the middle of the 1930s these\ndistinctions were beginning to be widely understood, as was the fact\nthat categoricity can in general only be obtained in higher-order\nsystems. Lindström was later to show (1969) that no logical\nsystem satisfying both compactness and the Löwenheim-Skolem\nproperty can possess greater expressive power than first-order logic:\nso in that sense, first-order logic is indeed a “natural”\nentity. \nBut the technical results alone did not settle the matter in favor of\nfirst-order logic. As Schiemer & Reck point out (2013), well into\nthe 1930s, even after the principal metalogical results had been\nachieved, logicians such as Gödel, Carnap, Tarski, Church, and\nHilbert & Bernays continued to use higher-order systems (generally\nin some version of the simple theory of types). In other words, even\nafter the metalogical results there was a choice to be made,\nand the choice in favor of first-order logic was not inevitable. After\nall, the metalogical results can be taken to show a severe\nlimitation of first-order logic: that it is not capable of\nspecifying a unique model even for the natural numbers. Hilbert in\n1917/18 had treated first-order logic as a mere stepping-stone, and\nthe metalogical results can be taken to confirm the wisdom of his\napproach: If you want categoricity, then you are forced to move to a\nhigher-order system. \nAt this point in the 1930s, however, several other strands of thinking\nabout logic now coalesced. The intellectual situation was highly\ncomplex. The famous papers by Carnap, von Neumann, and Heyting at the\n1931 Königsberg congress had identified the logicist, formalist,\nand intuitionist schools: their debates were to shape thinking about\nthe foundations of mathematics for the next several decades. A search\nfor secure foundations, and in particular for an avoidance of the\nset-theoretical paradoxes, was something they shared, and that helped\nto tip the balance in favor of first-order logic. In the first place\n(as Weyl and Skolem had already pointed out, and as was at least\nimplicit in the Hilbert program) there were good constructivist and\nphilosophical reasons for avoiding higher-order quantification\nwherever possible, and for restricting one’s logic to the first\norder. Secondly, several unambiguously first-order formulations were\nnow given of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and also of\nvon-Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory (which permits a finite\naxiomatization). The first-order nature of these theories was stressed\nin a number of publications from the 1930s: by Tarski (1935), Quine\n(1936), Bernays (1937), and Gödel (1940). As a practical matter,\nthese first-order set theories sufficed to formulate all existing\nmathematical practice; so for the codification of mathematical proofs,\nthere was no need to resort to higher-order logic. (This confirmed an\nobservation that Hilbert had already made as early as 1917, though\nwithout himself fully developing the point.) Thirdly, there was an\nincreased tendency to distinguish between logic and set theory, and to\nview set theory as a branch of mathematics. The fact that higher-order\nlogic could be construed as (in Quine’s later phrase) “set\ntheory in sheep’s clothing” reinforced the other\ntendencies: “true” logic was first-order; higher-order\nlogic was “really” set theory. By the end of the decade, a\nconsensus had been reached that, for purposes of research in the\nfoundations of mathematics, mathematical theories ought to be\nformulated in first-order terms. Classical first-order logic had\nbecome “standard”. \nLet us now try to draw some lessons, and in particular ask whether the\nemergence of first-order logic was inevitable. I begin with an\nobservation. Each stage of this complex history is conditioned by two\nsorts of shifting background consideration. One is broadly\nmathematical: the theorems that had been established. The other is\nbroadly philosophical: the assumptions that were made (explicitly or\ntacitly) about logic and about the foundations of mathematics. These\ntwo things interacted. Each thinker in the sequence starts with some\nmore or less intuitive ideas about logic. Those ideas prompt\nmathematical questions: distinctions are drawn: theorems are proved:\nconsequences are noted, and the philosophical understanding is\nsharpened. At each stage, the question, “What is logic?”\n(or: “What is the correct logic?”) needs to be\nassessed against both the mathematical and the philosophical\nbackground: it makes little sense to ask the question in the\nabstract. \nLet us now consider the question: When was first-order logic\ndiscovered? That question is too general. It needs to be broken\ndown into three subsidiary questions: \nEquipped with these distinctions, let us now ask: Why was\nfirst-order logic not discovered earlier? \nIt is striking that Peirce, already in 1885, had clearly\ndifferentiated between propositional logic, first-order logic, and\nsecond-order logic. He was aware that propositional logic is\nsignificantly weaker than quantificational logic, and, in particular,\nis inadequate to an analysis of the foundations of arithmetic. He\ncould then have gone on to observe that second-order logic is in\ncertain respects philosophically problematic, and that, in general,\nour grasp on quantification over objects is firmer than our\ngrasp on quantification over properties. The problem arises\neven if the universe of discourse is finite. We have, for example, a\nreasonable grasp on what it means to speak (in first-order terms) of\nall the planets, or to say that there exists a\nplanet with a particular property. But what does it mean to talk\n(in second-order terms) of all properties of the planets?\nWhat is the criterion of individuation for such properties? Is the\nproperty of being the outermost planet the same as the property of\nbeing the smallest planet? What are we to say about negative\nproperties? Is it a property of the planet Saturn that it is not equal\nto the integer 17? In that case, although there are only a finite\nnumber of planets, our second-order quantifiers must range over\ninfinitely many properties. And so on. The Quinean objections are\nfamiliar.  \nArguments of this sort had been made in the scholastic disputes\nbetween realists and nominalists: and Peirce was steeped in the\nmedieval literature on these topics. He need not have gone so far as\nto make point \\((\\gamma)\\), i.e., to argue that first-order logic is\nspecially privileged. That would in any case have run contrary to his\nlogical pluralism. But he did have the tools to make point\n\\((\\beta)\\), and to emphasize that there is an important gulf\nseparating second-order logic from first-order, just as there is an\nimportant gulf separating first-order logic from the Boolean\npropositional calculus. Why did he not make these points already in\n1885? \nAny answer can only be speculative. One factor, a minor one, is that\nPeirce was not himself a nominalist. Another is that he operated\nwithin a variety of logical systems: he was temperamentally eclectic,\nand not disposed to search for the “one true logic”. There\nare also technical considerations. Peirce, unlike Hilbert, does not\npresent first-intentional logic as an axiomatized system, nor does he\nurge it as a vehicle for studying the foundations of mathematics. He\ndoes not possess the distinction between an uninterpreted, formal,\naxiomatic calculus and its metalanguage. As a result, he does not ask\nabout questions of decidability, or completeness, or categoricity; and\nwithout the metamathematical results a full understanding of the\ndifferences in expressive power between first-order and second-order\nlogic was not available to him. One of the strongest arguments against\nsecond-order logic—that quantification over all subsets of a\ndenumerable collection entails quantification over a non-denumerable\ntotality—could not even have been formulated until\nCantor’s Theorem was known. The logical and set-theoretical\nparadoxes were not yet discovered, and Zermelo had not yet axiomatized\nthe theory of sets: so Peirce lacked the acute sense of motivation to\ndiscover a “secure foundation for mathematics”. And of\ncourse Peirce had no inkling of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorems, or\nthe Skolem paradox, or the sequence of metalogical theorems that were\nto bring first-order logic into sharp focus. He provided a flexible\nand suggestive notation that was to prove enormously fertile, and he\nwas the first to distinguish clearly between first-order and\nsecond-order logic: but the tools for understanding the\nmathematical significance of the distinction did not yet\nexist. (As Henri Pirenne once remarked, the Vikings discovered\nAmerica, but they forgot about it, because they did not yet need\nit.) \nA related point holds for Frege and Russell. They possessed the\nconception of a hierarchy of logical levels, and in principle they,\ntoo, could have isolated first-order logic, and thus have accomplished\nstep \\((\\alpha)\\). But they never considered isolating the lowest\nlevel of the hierarchy as a free-standing system. There are both\nphilosophical and mathematical reasons for this. As a philosophical\nmatter, the logicist project aimed to show that “mathematics can\nbe reduced to logic”: and they conceived of the entire hierarchy\nof types as constituting logic. And then, as a mathematical matter,\nsecond-order logic was necessary to their construction of the\nintegers. So they had no compelling reason, either philosophical or\nmathematical, that would have led them to focus on the first-order\nfragment. \nThere is here an instructive contrast with Peirce. Peirce, in the\nspirit of the 19th-century algebraists, was happy to\nexplore a lush abundance of logical structures: his attitude was\nfundamentally pluralist. The logicists, working in the analytical\ntradition, were more concerned to discover what the integers actually\nare: their attitude was fundamentally monistic and\nreductionist. But in order to single out first-order logic as was done\nin the 1930s, two things were needed: an awareness that there were\ndistinct logical systems, and an argument for preferring one to the\nother. Peirce had the pluralism: the logicists had the urge to find a\n“correct” system: but neither had both. \nLet us now turn to the question, Was the emergence of first-order\nlogic inevitable? It is impossible to avoid counterfactual\nconsiderations, and the answer must be more speculative. And here,\ntoo, it is necessary to distinguish between the inevitability of the\ntechnical results \\((\\beta)\\), and the inevitability of point\n\\((\\gamma)\\). \nLet us start with point \\((\\beta)\\). By 1928, the metalogical results\ncan fairly be said to have been inevitable. Hilbert & Ackermann\nhad isolated and described first-order logic; the distinction between\nmathematics and meta-mathematics was by then well understood; they had\nshown how to prove the completeness of the propositional calculus; and\nthey explicitly raised the completeness of first-order logic as an\nimportant open problem. It was certain that, within the next few\nyears, some enterprising logician would provide an answer: as it\nhappened, Gödel got there first. It would then have been an\nobvious next step to inquire about the completeness of higher-order\nsystems. So within a few years of Hilbert & Ackermann the basic\nmetalogical theorems would have been established. \nIf that is correct, then Hilbert’s decisive step in the 1917/18\nlectures was not the isolation of first-order logic—i.e., not\nstep \\((\\alpha)\\). That was a comparatively insignificant matter. That\nstep had already been taken explicitly by Peirce, and tacitly by Weyl\nand Löwenheim. Hilbert did not treat it as important, and appears\nto have viewed it primarily as an expository device, a means of\nsimplifying the presentation of the logic of Principia\nMathematica. The important step in 1917 was rather the\nintroduction of techniques of metamathematics, and the explicit posing\nof questions of completeness and consistency and decidability. To pose\nthese questions for systems of logic was an enormous conceptual leap,\nand Hilbert understood it as such. His own first attempts, made in his\n1905 Heidelberg address, had\ncollapsed under the criticisms of Poincaré, and he had\nstruggled to find a satisfactory formulation. And even after\nhe had introduced his metalogical distinctions in his papers of the\n1920s, logicians of the caliber of Russell and Brouwer and Ramsey had\ndifficulty in understanding what he was attempting to do.\nThis development was in 1917 anything but inevitable: and\nwithout the introduction of the metalogical techniques the history of\nlogic and proof theory in the 1920s and 1930s would have looked very\ndifferent. Would the Gödel theorems ever have been conceived?\nWould the work of Löwenheim or Skolem or Zermelo independently\nhave led to an investigation of the metalogical properties of\nfirst-order logic? One can in retrospect imagine an alternative path\nto the technical results \\((\\beta)\\), but there is no reason to\nsuppose that they were fated to emerge either when they did, or as\nthey did. \nA subtler issue arises if we turn now to point \\((\\gamma)\\) and ask:\nWas it inevitable that first-order logic would come to be regarded\nas a “privileged” logical system? As we saw, the\nmetalogical results of the 1930s do not settle the primacy of\nfirst-order logic. The “privileging” came later, and seems\nrather to have depended on philosophical considerations: the need to\navoid the set-theoretical paradoxes, a search for secure foundations\nfor mathematics, a desire to accommodate the objections of Brouwer and\nWeyl, a sense that higher-order logics were both methodologically\nsuspect and avoidable. All these things show the continuing influence\nof the Grundlagenkrise of the 1920s, which did so much to set\nthe terms of the subsequent philosophical understanding of the\nfoundations of mathematics. \nIt is therefore important to stress that an alternative history was\npossible, and that the Grundlagenkrise was entirely absent\nfrom Hilbert’s logical writings in 1917/18. The names of Brouwer\nand Weyl are nowhere mentioned. Hilbert is of course aware of the\nparadoxes (which he had known about since 1897), but had long believed\nthat Zermelo’s axiomatization had shown how to avoid them. Nor\ndo we find in his writings any quest for the “one true\nlogic”. On the contrary. Both in 1917/18 and in the unpublished\nlecture notes from the early 1920s the emphasis is on using the new\nmetalogical techniques to explore the strengths and weaknesses of a\ndiversity of logical systems. The work is explicitly undertaken in the\nspirit of his studies of the axioms of geometry. He will take up a\nsystem, explore it for a while, then drop it to examine something\nelse. In his pluralism and in his pragmatic, experimental attitude he\nis closer to Peirce than to the logicists. \nThe Grundlagenkrise and his public, polemical exchanges with\nBrouwer came later, and they gave a distorted picture of the\nmotivations behind his logical investigations. What was the impact of\nthese philosophical debates on the technical aspects of his\nprogram? For the formulation of first-order logic, and for the posing\nof metalogical questions, the answer is easy: there was no impact\nwhatsoever. The contents of Hilbert & Ackermann 1928 were already\npresent in the 1917/18 lectures. As for Hilbert’s\nproof-theoretic research of the 1920s, the main lines of development\nemerged quite independently of Brouwer and Weyl. The polemics might\nhave added a sense of urgency, but it is hard to detect any influence\non the actual mathematics. \nSo even if we imagine the philosophical Grundlagenkrise\nentirely removed from the picture, the technical results of the\nHilbert school would not have been significantly affected. The\ncompleteness and incompleteness results would, in all likelihood, have\narrived more or less on schedule. (It is worthwhile to note that\nBernays and Hilbert had contemplated the possibility of various sorts\nof incompleteness as early as 1928: see the discussion by Wilfried\nSieg in Hilbert [LFL]: 792–796.) But those results would have\nemerged in a very different philosophical climate. The incompleteness\ntheorems would likely have been greeted as an important technical\ncontribution within the broader Hilbert program, rather than as its\ndramatic refutation. Perhaps (as Angus Macintyre 2011 has suggested)\nthey would have been viewed more like the independence results in set\ntheory, with less talk about the limits of mathematical\ncreativity. \nIn other words, far from being inevitable, the emergence, towards the\nend of the 1930s, of first-order logic as a privileged system\nof logic depended on two things, each independent of the other. On the\nmathematical side, it depended on Hilbert’s introduction of\nmetalogical techniques; on the philosophical side, it depended on the\narguments of the Grundlagenkrise. Neither of these things was\ninevitable: nor was the fact that they occurred at roughly the same\ntime. With a different history, Hilbert’s flexible attitude\nmight have prevailed, and there might have been more emphasis on\nhigher-order systems, or on the exploration of algebraic logics,\ninfinitary logics, category-theoretic systems, and the like: in short,\non logical pluralism.  \nIt is worthwhile to observe that, as the philosophical concerns of the\nGrundlagenkrise have receded, and as new approaches from the\ndirection of computer science and homotopy theory have entered the\nfield, the primacy of first-order logic is open to\nreconsideration.","contact.mail":"wewald@law.upenn.edu","contact.domain":"law.upenn.edu"}]
