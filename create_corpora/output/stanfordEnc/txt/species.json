Yet a proper understanding of species is important for\na number of reasons. Species are the fundamental taxonomic units of\nbiological classification.  Environmental laws are framed in terms of\nspecies. Even our conception of human nature is affected by our\nunderstanding of species. In this entry, three issues\nconcerning species are discussed. The first is the ontological status\nof species. The second is whether biologists should be species\npluralists or species monists. The third is whether the theoretical\nterm ‘species’ refers to a real category in nature.\n\n\n What are biological species? At first glance, this seems like an easy\nquestion to answer. Homo sapiens is a species, and so is\nCanis familiaris. Many species can be easily\ndistinguished. When we turn to the technical literature on species,\nthe nature of species becomes much less clear. Biologists offer over\ntwenty definitions of the term ‘species’ (Hey 2001).\nThese definitions are not fringe accounts of species but prominent\ndefinitions in the biological literature. Philosophers also disagree\non the nature of species. Here the concern is the ontological status\nof species. Some philosophers believe that species are natural\nkinds. Others maintain that species are particulars or\nindividuals. \n\nThe concept of species plays an important role both in and outside of\nbiology. Within biology, species are the fundamental units of\nbiological classification. Species are also units of\nevolution—groups of organisms that evolve in a unified\nway. Outside of biology, the concept of species plays a role in\ndebates over environmental law and ecological preservation. Our\nconception of species even affects our understanding of human\nnature. From a biological perspective, humans are the species Homo\nsapiens. \n\nThis entry discusses three issues concerning species.\nThe first issue is their ontological status. Are species natural\nkinds, individuals, or sets? The second issue concerns species\npluralism.  Monists argue that biologists should attempt to find the\ncorrect definition of ‘species.’ Pluralists disagree. They\nargue that there is no single correct definition of\n‘species’ but a plurality of equally correct\ndefinitions. The third issue concerns the reality of species.  Does\nthe term ‘species’ refer to a real category in nature? Or,\nas some philosophers and biologists argue, is the term\n‘species’ a theoretically empty designation? \n Since Aristotle, species have been paradigmatic examples of natural\nkinds with essences. An essentialist approach to species makes\nsense in a pre Darwinian context. God created species and an eternal\nessence for each species. After God’s initial creation, each species is\na static, non evolving group of organisms. Darwinism offers a different\nview of species. Species are the result of speciation. No qualitative\nfeature—morphological, genetic, or behavioral—is\nconsidered essential for membership in a species. Despite this change\nin biological thinking, many philosophers still believe that species\nare natural kinds with essences. Let us start with a brief introduction\nto kind essentialism and then turn to the biological reasons why\nspecies fail to have essences.  \n\nKind essentialism has a number of tenets. One tenet is that all and\nonly the members of a kind have a common essence. A second tenet is\nthat the essence of a kind is responsible for the traits typically\nassociated with the members of that kind. For example, gold’s atomic\nstructure is responsible for gold’s disposition to melt at certain\ntemperatures. Third, knowing a kind’s essence helps us explain and\npredict those properties typically associated with a kind. The\napplication of any of these tenets to species is problematic. But to\nsee the failure of essentialism we need only consider the first\ntenet. \n\nBiologists have had a hard time finding biological traits that occur\nin all and only the members of a species. Even such pre Darwinian\nessentialists as Linnaeus could not locate the essences of species\n(Ereshefsky 2001). Evolutionary theory explains why. A number of forces\nconspire against the universality and uniqueness of a trait in a\nspecies (Hull 1965). Suppose a genetically based trait were found in\nall the members of a species. The forces of mutation, recombination and\nrandom drift can cause the disappearance of that trait in a future\nmember of the species. All it takes is the disappearance of a trait in\none member of a species to show that it is not essential. The\nuniversality of a biological trait in a species is fragile. \n\nSuppose, nevertheless, that a trait occurs in all the members of a\nspecies. That trait is the essence of a species only if it is unique to\nthat species. Yet organisms in different species often have common\ncharacteristics. Again, biological forces work against the uniqueness\nof a trait within a single species. Organisms in related species\ninherit similar genes and developmental programs from their common\nancestors. These common stores of developmental resources cause a\nnumber of similarities in the organisms of different species. Another\nsource of similar traits in different species is parallel evolution.\nSpecies frequently live in similar habitats with comparable selection\npressures. Those selection pressures cause the prominence of similar\ntraits in more than one species. The parallel evolution of opposable\nthumbs in primates and pandas is an example. \n\nThe existence of various evolutionary forces does not rule out the\npossibility of a trait occurring in all and only the members of a\nspecies. But consider the conditions such a trait must satisfy. A\nspecies’ essential trait must occur in all the members of a species\nfor the entire life of that species. Moreover, if that trait is to be\nunique to that species, it cannot occur in any other species for the\nentire existence of life on this planet. The temporal parameters that\nspecies essentialism must satisfy are quite broad. The occurrence of a\nbiological trait in all and only the members of a species is an\nempirical possibility. But given current biological theory, that\npossibility is unlikely. \n\nOther arguments have been mustered against species essentialism.\nHull (1965) contends that species have vague boundaries and that such\nvagueness is incompatible with the existence of species specific\nessences. According to Hull, essentialist definitions of natural kinds\nrequire strict boundaries between those kinds. But the boundaries\nbetween species are vague. In all but a few cases, speciation is a long\nand gradual process such that there is no principled way to draw a\nprecise boundary between one species and the next. As a result, species\ncannot be given essentialist definitions. (Hull’s argument against\nspecies essentialism is very similar to one of Locke’s (1690[1975],\nIII, vi) arguments against kind essentialism.) \n\nSober (1980) raises a different objection to species essentialism.  He\nillustrates how essentialist explanations have been replaced by\nevolutionary ones. Essentialists explain variation within a species as\nthe result of interference in the ontogenetic development of\nparticular members of that species. Organisms have species specific\nessences, but interference often prevents the manifestations of those\nessences. Contemporary geneticists offer a different explanation of\nvariation within a species. They cite the gene frequencies of a\nspecies as well as the evolutionary forces that affect those\nfrequencies. No species specific essences are posited. Contemporary\nbiology can explain variation within a species without positing a\nspecies’ essence. So according to Sober, species essentialism has\nbecome theoretically superfluous. \n\nIn a pre Darwinian age, species essentialism made sense. Such\nessentialism, however, is out of step with contemporary evolutionary\ntheory. Evolutionary theory provides its own methods for explaining\nvariation within a species. It tells us that the boundaries between\nspecies are vague. And it tells us that a number of forces conspire\nagainst the existence of a trait in all and only the members of a\nspecies. From a biological perspective, species essentialism is no\nlonger a plausible position.  Nevertheless, as we shall see in Section\n2.6, some philosophers have recently tried to revive species\nessentialism. \n Let us turn to the prevailing view of the ontological status of\nspecies. Ghiselin (1974) and Hull (1978) suggest that instead of\nviewing species as natural kinds we should think of them as\nindividuals. Hull draws the ontological distinction this way. (Instead\nof the phrase ‘natural kind,’ Hull uses the term\n‘class.’) Classes are groups of entities that can function\nin scientific laws. One requirement of such laws is that they are true\nat any time and at any place in the universe. If ‘All copper\nconducts electricity’ is a law, then that law is true here and\nnow, as well as 100,000 years ago on some distant planet. Copper is a\nclass because samples of copper are spatiotemporally unrestricted\n—copper can occur anywhere in the universe. Individuals, unlike\nclasses, consist of parts that are spatiotemporally restricted. Think\nof a paradigmatic individual, a single mammalian organism. The parts\nof that organism cannot be scattered around the universe at different\ntimes if they are parts of a living, functioning organism. Various\nbiological processes, such as digestion and respiration, require that\nthose parts be causally and spatiotemporally connected. The parts of\nsuch an organism can only exist in a particular space-time region. In\nbrief, individuals consist of parts that are spatiotemporally\nrestricted. Classes consist of members that are spatiotemporally\nunrestricted.  \n\nGiven the class/individual distinction, Ghiselin and Hull argue that\nspecies are individuals, not classes. Their argument assumes that the\nterm ‘species’ is a theoretical term in evolutionary\ntheory, so their argument focuses on the role of ‘species’\nin that theory. Here is Hull’s version of the argument, which can be\ndubbed the ‘evolutionary unit argument.’ Since Darwin,\nspecies have been considered units of evolution. When Hull asserts\nthat species are units of evolution, he does not simply mean that the\ngene frequencies of a species change from one generation to the\nnext. He has a more significant form of evolution in mind, namely a\ntrait going from being rare to being prominent in a species. A number\nof processes can cause a trait to become prominent in a species. Hull\nhighlights selection. Selection causes a trait to become prominent in\na species only if that trait is passed down from one generation to the\nnext. If a trait is not heritable, the frequency of that trait will\nnot increase cumulatively. Hereditary relations, genetic or otherwise,\nrequire the generations of a species to be causally and hence\nspatiotemporally connected. So, if species are to evolve in non\ntrivial ways by natural selection, they must be spatiotemporally\ncontinuous entities. Given that species are units of evolution,\nspecies are individuals and not classes.  (For recent responses to the\nEvolutionary Unit Argument see Dupré 2001, Reydon 2003, Crane 2004, and Crawford 2008.) \n\nThe conclusion that species are individuals has a number of\ninteresting implications. For one, the relationship between an\norganism and its species is not a member/class relation but a\npart/whole relation. An organism belongs to a particular species only\nif it is appropriately causally connected to the other organisms in\nthat species. The organisms of a species must be parts of a single\nevolving lineage. If belonging to a species turns on an organism’s\ninsertion in a lineage, then qualitative similarity can be\nmisleading. Two organisms may be very similar morphologically,\ngenetically, and behaviorally, but unless they belong to the same\nspatiotemporally continuous lineage they cannot belong to the same\nspecies. Think of an analogy. Being part of my immediate family turns\non my wife, my children and I having certain biological relations to\none another, not our having similar features.  It does not matter that\nmy son’s best friend looks just like him. That friend is not part of\nour family. Similarly, organisms belong to a particular species\nbecause they are appropriately causally connected, not because they\nlook similar (if they indeed do). \n\nAnother implication of the species are individuals thesis concerns our\nconception of human nature (Hull 1978). As we have seen, species are\nfirst and foremost genealogical lineages. An organism belongs to a\nspecies because it is part of a lineage not because it has a\nparticular qualitative feature. Humans may be a number of things. One\nof them is being the species Homo sapiens. From an\nevolutionary perspective, there is no biological essence to being a\nhuman. There is no essential feature that all and only humans must\nhave to be part of Homo sapiens. Humans are not essentially\nrational beings or social animals or ethical agents. An organism can\nbe born without any of these features and still be a human. From a\nbiological perspective, being part of the lineage Homo\nsapiens is both necessary and sufficient for being a human. (For\nfurther implications of the individuality thesis, see Hull 1978 and\nBuller 2005.) \n Some philosophers think that Hull and Ghiselin too quickly dismiss\nthe assumption that species are natural kinds. Kitcher (1984) believes\nthat species are sets of organisms. Thinking of species as sets is an\nontologically neutral stance. It allows that some species are\nspatiotemporally restricted sets of organisms, that is, individuals.\nAnd it allows that other species are spatiotemporally unrestricted\nsets of organisms.  \n\nWhy does Kitcher believe that some species are individuals and other\nspecies are spatiotemporally unrestricted sets? Following the biologist\nErnst Mayr, Kitcher suggests that there are two fundamental types of\nexplanation in biology: those that cite proximate causes and\nthose that cite ultimate causes. Proximate explanations cite\nthe more immediate cause of a trait, for example, the genes or\ndevelopmental pathways that cause the occurrence of a trait in an\norganism. Ultimate explanations cite the evolutionary cause of a trait\nin a species, for example, the selection forces that caused the\nevolution of thumbs in pandas and their ancestors. \n\nFor each type of explanation, Kitcher believes that there are\ncorresponding definitions of the term ‘species’ (what\nbiologists call ‘species concepts’). Proximate\nexplanations cite species concepts based on structural similarities,\nsuch as genetic, chromosomal and developmental similarities. These\nspecies concepts assume that species are spatiotemporally unrestricted\nsets of organisms. Ultimate explanations cite species concepts that\nassign species evolutionary roles. These species concepts assume that\nspecies are lineages and thus individuals. \n\nKitcher is correct that biologists attempt to explain the traits of\norganisms in two ways: sometimes they cite the ultimate, or\nevolutionary, cause of a trait; other times they cite a structural\nfeature of an organism with that trait. A problem with Kitcher’s\napproach is his characterization of biological practice. Biologists\nsince Darwin have taken species to be evolutionary units. A glance at\na biology text book will reveal that the evolutionary approach to\nspecies is the going concern in biology. The groups that correspond to\nKitcher’s structural concepts are not considered species by\ntaxonomists. Groups of organisms that have genetic, developmental,\nbehavioral and ecological similarities, are natural kinds in biology,\nbut they are not considered species. Consider such groups of organisms\nas males, females, tree nesters and diploid organisms. These groups of\norganisms cut across species. For instance, some but not all humans\nare males and many organisms in other species are males. Male is a\nkind in biology, but it is not a species. Kitcher’s motivation for\nasserting that species are sets is to allow spatiotemporally\nunrestricted groups of organisms to form species. That motivation,\nhowever, is not substantiated by biological theory or practice. \n\nAnother response to the species are individuals thesis is offered by\nproponents of an alternative approach to natural kinds.  According to\nBoyd (1999a, 1999b), Griffiths (1999), Wilson (1999), Millikan (1999),\nand Wilson et al. (2007), species are natural kinds on\na proper conception of natural kinds.  These authors adopt Boyd’s\nHomeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) theory of natural kinds.  HPC\ntheory assumes that natural kinds are groups of entities that share\nstable similarities.  HPC theory does not require that species are\ndefined by traditional essential properties.  The members of Canis\nfamiliaris, for example, tend to share a number of common\nproperties (having four legs, two eyes, and so on), but given the\nforces of evolution, no biological property is essential for\nmembership in that species.  For HPC theory, the similarities among\nthe members of a kind must be stable enough to allow better than\nchance prediction about various properties of a kind.  Given that we\nknow that Sparky is a dog, we can predict with greater than chance\nprobability that Sparky will have four legs. \n\nHPC kinds are more than groups of entities that share stable clusters\nof similarities.  HPC kinds also contain “homeostatic causal\nmechanisms” that are responsible for the similarities found among the\nmembers of a kind.  The members of a biological species interbreed,\nshare common developmental programs, and are exposed to common\nselection regimes.  These “homeostatic mechanisms” cause the members\nof a species to have similar features.  Dogs, for instance, tend to\nhave four legs and two eyes because they share genetic material and\nare exposed to common environmental pressures.  An HPC kind consists\nof entities that share similarities induced by that kind’s homeostatic\nmechanisms.  According to Boyd, species are HPC kinds and thus natural\nkinds because “species are defined …  by … shared properties\nand by the mechanisms (including both ”external“ mechanisms and\ngenetic transmission) which sustain their homeostasis” (1999b,\n81).   \n\nHPC theory provides a more promising account of species as natural\nkinds than essentialism.  HPC kinds need not have a common essential\nproperty, so the criticisms of species essentialism are avoided.\nFurthermore, HPC theory allows that external relations play a\nsignificant role in inducing similarity among the members of a kind.\nTraditional essentialism assumes that the essence of a kind is an\ninternal or intrinsic property of a kind’s members, such as the atomic\nstructure of gold or the DNA of tigers.  HPC theory is more\ninclusive because it recognizes that both the internal properties of\norganisms and the external relations of organisms are important causes\nof species-wide similarities.  For instance, HPC theory but not\nessentialism cites interbreeding as a fundamental cause of similarity\namong the organisms of many species. \n\nWhile HPC theory is better at capturing the features of species than\nessentialism, does HPC theory provide an adequate account of species\nas natural kinds?  Here are two potential problems with HPC theory.\nHPC theory’s objective is to explain the existence of stable\nsimilarities within groups of entities.  However, species are also\ncharacterized by persistent differences.  Polymorphism (stable\nvariation within a species) is an important feature of nearly every\nspecies.  Species polymorphisms are easy to find.  Consider sexual\ndimorphism: within any mammalian species there are pronounced\ndifferences between males and females.  Or consider polymorphism in\nthe life cycles of organisms.  The lives of organisms consist of\ndramatically different life stages, such as the difference between the\ncaterpillar and butterfly stages of a single organism.  HPC theorists\nrecognize the existence of polymorphism, but they do not recognize\npolymorphism as a central feature of species in need of explanation.\nHPC theorists privilege and attempt to explain similarities.  In\naddition to Boyd’s ‘homeostatic’ mechanisms we need to\nrecognize ‘heterostatic’ mechanisms that maintain species\nvariation.  (For further discussion of polymorphism in species see Ereshefsky and Matthen 2005 and Magnus 2008.)   \n\nA second concern with HPC theory involves the identity conditions of\nspecies.  The members of a species vary in their traits.  Moreover,\nthey vary in their homeostatic mechanisms.  Over time and across\ngeographic regions, the members of a single species are often exposed\nto different homeostatic mechanisms.  Given such variation, what\ncauses organisms with different traits and exposed to different\nhomeostatic mechanisms to be members of the same species?  The common\nanswer is genealogy: the members of a species form a continuous\ngenealogical entity on the tree of life.  A species’ homeostatic\nmechanisms are mechanisms of one species because they affect organisms\nthat form a unique lineage.  Boyd and promoters of HPC theory\nrecognize the importance of genealogy and see historical relations as\none type of homeostatic mechanism.  However, Boyd does not see\ngenealogy as the defining aspect of species, and this goes against a\nfundamental assumption of biological systematics: species are first\nand foremost continuous genealogical entities.  Boyd is quite clear\nthat similarity and not genealogical connectedness is the final\narbitrator of species sameness (1999b, 80).  This assumption makes sense given\nthat Boyd believes that species are kinds and kinds are ultimately\nsimilarity-based classes that play a role in induction.  But this view\nof the identity conditions of species conflicts with the standard view\nin biological systematics that species are continuous genealogical\nlineages (Ereshefsky 2007). \n\nAnother approach to species, which is in line with the view that\nspecies are individuals, is offered by Ereshefsky and Matthen’s (2005)\n“Population Structure Theory” (PST).  PST treats similarity\nas just one type of trait distribution in species.  PST does not\nprivilege similarity over polymorphism, so PST offers a more inclusive\naccount of trait distributions in species than HPC theory.  In\naddition, PST highlights a common type of explanation in biology,\nnamely one that cites the population and inter-population structures\nof species.  Such population structure explanations explain trait\ndistributions in species, whether those distributions involve\nsimilarity or dissimilarity. \n\nPopulation structure explanations are pervasive in biology.  Consider\na population structure explanation of sexual dimorphism within a\nspecies.  Male elk have a number of similarities, including having\nlarge, fuzzy antlers.  What explains this similarity?  One cause, the\nproximal cause, is the individual development of each male elk.\nAnother explanation, the distal cause, turns on relationships between\nmale and female elks.  Male antlers are the result of sexual\nselection.  Such selection requires the participation of both male and\nfemale elk.  Looked at in this way, we see that the existence of\nsimilarities within lower level groups (here within the genders)\ndepends on higher level groups (here species) and the diversity within\nthem.  That is, polymorphism at the higher level, and the population\nstructure that binds polymorphism, is essential in explaining lower\nlevel similarities within the genders and other sub-groups of a\nspecies. \n\nPopulation structure explanations are common, and arguably essential,\nfor understanding diversity and similarity within species.  Such\nexplanations are also essential for understanding the identity\nconditions of species.  As we have seen, species are first and\nforemost genealogical entities.  Genealogy is an inter-population\nstructure: species are lineages of populations.  So according to\nbiological systematics, species identity is defined in terms of\npopulation and inter-populational structures, not organismic\nsimilarity.  PST theory properly captures the identity conditions of\nspecies. \n\nGriffiths (1999), Okasha (2002), and LaPorte (2004) have\nsuggested a form of species essentialism which can be called\n‘relational essentialism’.  According to relational essentialism,\ncertain relations among organisms, or between organisms and the\nenvironment, are necessary and sufficient for membership in a species.\nSuch relations, argue Griffiths, Okasha, and LaPorte, are species\nessences.  For example, they suggest that being descendent from a\nparticular ancestor is necessary and sufficient for being a member of\na species. \n\nDevitt (2008) rejects relational essentialism.  He argues that\nrelational essentialism fails to answer two crucial questions.  The\ntaxon question: Why is organism O a member of species S?\nThe trait question: Why do members of species S typically have trait\nT?  Devitt suggests that to answer these questions species need\nintrinsic essences; and because relational essentialism only posits\nrelational essences, relational essentialism fails to answer these\nquestions.  Devitt’s target is not merely to discredit\nrelational essentialism, but also to argue for a new form of intrinsic\nbiological essentialism.  According to Devitt (2008), a species’\nessence is the cluster of intrinsic properties and perhaps the\nrelations that cause the typical traits of a taxon’s members.\nLet us consider Devitt’s critique of relational essentialism.\nIn doing so, we will learn about both relational essentialism and\nDevitt’s intrinsic biological essentialism. \n\nRecall the trait question: Why do zebras have stripes?  Devitt (2008,\n352ff.) argues that explanations that merely cite relations are\ninsufficient to explain the traits typically found among zebras.  We\nmust cite intrinsic properties as well, and such properties are\nessential intrinsic properties of zebras.  Devitt is right that we\nneed to cite more than relations to explain why zebras have stripes.\nGenerally, to explain the occurrence of a homologue, such as stripes\nin zebras, we need to cite both relations among organisms and\nintrinsic factors within organisms.  More precisely, embryonic zebras\nhave developmental mechanisms that cause zebras to have stripes.\nThese mechanisms are intrinsic features of embryonic zebras.  But\nthose developmental mechanisms must be passed down from parent to\noffspring, via genealogical relations.  So a robust explanation of why\nzebras have stripes cites both the relations and intrinsic properties\nthat cause stripes. \n\nGiven the observation that we should cite both genealogy and\ndevelopmental mechanisms to understand why zebras have stripes, should\nwe infer, as Devitt does, that the taxon Zebra has an intrinsic\nessence?  Some argue ‘no’ (Ereshefsky 2010a).\nBiologists explain the characters of organisms by citing other\ncharacters, without the added metaphysical claim that a character\ncited in an explanans is essential for membership in a taxon.\nConsider how a biologist explains the occurrence of stripes in a\nzebra.  In its embryonic state, a zebra has an ontogenetic mechanism\nthat causes it to develop stripes.  That developmental mechanism is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for membership in Zebra.  Some zebras\nlack that mechanism.  Moreover, the developmental mechanism that\ncauses stripes in zebras causes stripes in a variety of mammals,\nincluding cats.  Generally, the intrinsic properties that cause\norganismic traits do not coincide with taxonomic boundaries: they\ncross-cut such boundaries.  The belief that such intrinsic properties\nare essential for taxon membership is not part of biological\ntheory. \n\nLet’s turn to the taxon question: Why are certain organisms members of\nspecies S?  Relational essentialists argue that modern species\nconcepts posit relational properties, such as interbreeding,\ngenealogy, and occupying a specific niche, as the defining features of\nspecies.  Relational essentialists tell us that biologists do not\nposit intrinsic properties as the defining features of species.\nDevitt responds (2008) that citing the relations among the organisms\nof a species does not explain why particular organisms are members of\na certain species.  According to Devitt, saying that organism O can\ninterbreed with other Homo sapiens leaves unanswered why\nthose other organisms are Homo sapiens.  There’s an\nunanswered regress: why are any of them Homo sapiens?\nAccording to Devitt, to answer that question we must cite essential\nintrinsic properties in organisms.   \n\nHas Devitt made the case for intrinsic essentialism?  Perhaps not.\nOnce again, Why are certain organisms members of species S?  According\nto our best biological theory, if S is an interbreeding species, then\nthose organisms have intrinsic reproductive mechanisms that allow them\nto interbreed with one another.  However, we do not know which\nintrinsic mechanisms are mechanisms that cause an organism to be a\nmember of a particular species.  We need some way of determining which\nmechanisms cause an organism to be a member of one species versus a\nmember of another species.  Here we must turn to relations: particular\npopulation and genealogical relations among organisms.  The answer to\nwhy particular reproductive mechanisms are mechanisms of species S is\nthat those mechanisms occur in organisms whose populations are\ngenealogically connected in a single lineage.  Relations are\nexplanatorily prior in explaining taxon identity, not intrinsic\nproperties. \n\nTo reinforce this point, consider which aspects of an organism can be\nchanged while it remains a member of the same species, and which\naspects cannot be changed.  The intrinsic reproductive mechanisms\nwithin the organisms of a species can be changed, but being part of\nthe same lineage or gene pool cannot be changed.  To make this more\nconcrete consider the case of ring species.  A ring species consists\nof a geographic ring of populations such that organisms in contiguous\npopulations can successfully mate, but organisms in populations at\ndistant links in the ring cannot successfully mate.  Interestingly,\nthe organisms in distant populations of a ring species have different\nreproductive mechanisms (Mayr 1963, 512ff.).  Suppose Joe is a member\nof a ring species.  Joe could have had a different intrinsic\nreproductive mechanism than the one he has.  Imagine counterfactually\nthat he is a member of a different population of his ring species,\nnamely one with different reproductive mechanisms than those found in\nhis actual population.  In this counterfactual situation Joe is still\na member of his species so long as we do not remove him from the\nlineage and gene pool of that ring species.  Generally, an organism in\na species can have a different reproductive mechanism and still be a\npart of that species.  But an organism cannot be removed from its\noriginal lineage and put in another lineage and remain part of the\noriginal species. When it comes to species membership, intrinsic\nmechanisms within the organisms of a species can vary, but certain\nrelations among its organisms cannot vary (Ereshefsky 2010a).  (For other critiques of Devitt’s intrinsic essentialism see Barker 2010 and Lewens 2012.) \n\nDo the results of this section thus far imply that relational\nessentialism is correct? Consider two traditional requirements of\nessentialism highlighted by Okasha (2002).  The membership\nrequirement: the essence of a kind provides the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for membership in that kind.  The explanatory\nrequirement: citing a kind’s essence is central in explaining the\nproperties typically associated with the members of that kind.  Given\nthese two requirements Okasha offers the following argument.  Because\ncertain relations are necessary and sufficient for membership in a\nspecies, such relations satisfy the membership requirement of\nessentialism.  However, those relations do not satisfy the explanatory\nrequirement.  According to Okasha, relations such as genealogy and\ninterbreeding fail to explain the traits typically found among the\nmembers of a species.  Instead, we must cite the “genotype and\nits developmental environment” (2002, 204) to explain such\ntraits.  Despite failing to meet the explanatory requirement, Okasha\nthinks that certain relations are taxon essences. Okasha writes that\nthere is no a priori reason to retain the explanatory\nrequirement of essentialism and suggests that it should be dropped.\nWith the explanatory requirement out of the way and the membership\nrequirement satisfied, Okasha concludes that species have relational\nessences. \n\nThe problem with Okasha’s relational essentialism is that if the\nrelations that serve as the identity conditions for a species are not\ncentral in explaining the typical traits among a species’ members,\nthen such relations are not essences.  Okasha too quickly jettisons a\ncore feature of essentialism: that the essence of a kind plays a\ncentral role in explaining the typical features of a kind’s members.\nEssentialists, from Aristotle to Locke, from Kripke to Devitt, believe\nthat essences figure centrally in explaining the traits typically\nfound among the members of a kind.  If we give up that explanatory\ncomponent of essentialism we give up a core feature of essentialism, a\nfeature that distinguishes real essences from nominal essences.\nNominal essences demarcate membership in a kind, but they do not\nexplain the typical traits of a kind.  Arguably, any approach to\nnatural kinds that aims to capture the kinds of science should\npreserve this explanatory feature of kinds.  So in the end, relational\nessentialism is not essentialism because it fails to satisfy a core\naim of essentialism.  (For a detailed response to Okasha’s relational essentialism see Pedroso 2014.) \n Biologists offer various definitions of the term\n‘species’ (Claridge, Dawah, and Wilson 1997). Biologists\ncall these different definitions ‘species concepts.’ The\nBiological Species Concept defines a species as a group of organisms\nthat can successfully interbreed and produce fertile offspring. The\nPhylogenetic Species Concept (which itself has multiple versions)\ndefines a species as a group of organisms bound by a unique\nancestry. The Ecological Species Concept defines a species as a group\nof organisms that share a distinct ecological niche. These species\nconcepts are just three among over a dozen prominent species concepts in the\nbiological literature. \n\nWhat are we to make of this variety of species concepts? Monists\nbelieve that an aim of biological taxonomy is to identify the single\ncorrect species concept. Perhaps that concept is among the species\nconcepts currently proposed and we need to determine which concept is\nthe right one. Or perhaps we have not yet found the correct species\nconcept and we need to wait for further progress in\nbiology. Pluralists take a different stand. They do not believe that\nthere is a single correct species concept. Biology, they argue,\ncontains a number of legitimate species concepts. Pluralists believe\nthat the monist’s goal of a single correct species concept should be\nabandoned. \n\nSpecies pluralism comes in various forms (for example, Kitcher 1984,\nMishler and Brandon 1987, Dupré 1993, and Ereshefsky 2001).\nKitcher and Dupré offer forms of species pluralism that\nrecognize the species concepts mentioned above—biological\nspecies, phylogenetic species, and ecological species—as well\nas other species concepts. As we saw in Section 1.2, Kitcher accepts\nspecies concepts that require species to be individuals, and he\naccepts species concepts based on the structural similarities of\norganisms. The latter type of species are not spatiotemporally\ncontinuous entities.  Such species merely need to contain organisms\nthat share theoretically significant properties. Dupré’s\nversion of species pluralism is more robust. He recognizes all of the\nspecies concepts found in Kitcher’s version of\npluralism. Dupré’s pluralism also allows species concepts based\non similarities highlighted by non biologists.  For example,\nDupré accepts species concepts based on gastronomically\nsignificant properties.  \n\nIf one thinks that the term ‘species’ is a theoretical\nterm found within evolutionary biology, then one might find\nDupré’s version of pluralism too promiscuous. If the question\nis how the term ‘species’ is defined in biology, then how\nit is defined outside of biology does not count. Think of a parallel\nsituation in physics. When we are interested in the scientific meaning\nof the term ‘work’ we do not attend to its meaning in the\nsentence ‘How was work today?’ Similarly, the use of the\nword ‘species’ by culinary experts does not reveal the\ntheoretical meaning of ‘species.’ \n\nKitcher’s pluralism is more circumspect: it limits species concepts to\nthose that are legitimized by theoretical biology. Still, one might\nworry that Kitcher’s form of pluralism is too liberal. Kitcher’s\npluralism allows that some species are spatiotemporally continuous\nentities (individuals), while other species may be spatiotemporally\nunrestricted entities (natural kinds). As we saw in Section 2.1,\nHull’s evolutionary unit argument states that within the purview of\nevolutionary biology, species must be individuals. Kitcher’s pluralism\ndoes not satisfy this requirement. If one assumes that\n‘species’ is a theoretical term in evolutionary theory and\nthat species are individuals, then Kitcher’s pluralism is too\ninclusive. \n\nAnother version of species pluralism is found in Ereshefsky (2001).\nThis version of pluralism adopts Hull’s conclusion that species must\nbe spatiotemporally continuous lineages. Nevertheless, this version of\npluralism asserts that there are different types of lineages called\n‘species.’ The Biological Species Concept and related\nconcepts highlight those lineages bound by the process of\ninterbreeding. The Phylogenetic Species Concepts highlight those\nlineages of organisms that share a common and unique\nancestry. Ecological approaches to species highlight lineages of\norganisms that are exposed to common sets of stabilizing selection. On\nthis form of species pluralism, the tree of life is segmented by\ndifferent processes into different types of species lineages. \n\nIt is worth noting that the motivation behind Dupré’s,\nKitcher’s and Ereshefsky’s versions of pluralism is ontological not\nepistemological. Some authors (for example, Rosenberg 1994) suggest\nthat we adopt pluralism because of our epistemological\nlimitations. The world is exceedingly complex and we have limited\ncognitive abilities, so we should accept a plurality of simplified and\ninaccurate classifications of the world. The species pluralism offered\nby Dupré, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky is not epistemologically\ndriven.  Evolutionary theory, a well substantiated theory, tells us\nthat the organic world is multifaceted. According to Dupré,\nKitcher, and Ereshefsky, species pluralism is a result of a fecundity\nof biological forces rather than a paucity of scientific\ninformation. \n\nNot everyone is willing to accept species pluralism. Monists (for\nexample, Sober 1984, Ghiselin 1987, Hull 1987, de Queiroz 1999, Mayden\n2002, Brigandt 2003, Pigliucci 2003, Wilkins 2003, and Richards 2010) have launched a\nnumber of objections to species pluralism. One objection centers on\nthe type of lineage that should be accepted as species. Some monists\nallow the existence of different types of base lineages but contend\nthat only one type of lineage should be called ‘species’\n(Ghiselin 1987). For instance, supporters of the Biological Species\nConcept believe that lineages of interbreeding sexual organisms are\nmuch more important in the evolution of life on this planet (Eldredge\n1985, Lee 2003, Coyne and Orr 2004). They argue that only the\nBiological Species Concept, or some interbreeding concept, should be\naccepted. \n\nHowever, adopting only an interbreeding approach to species has its\ncosts: it would exclude all asexual organisms from forming\nspecies. Interbreeding requires the genetic contributions of two\nsexual organisms. Asexual organisms reproduce by themselves, either\nthrough cloning, vegetative means or self fertilization. Some reptiles\nand amphibians reproduce asexually. Many insects reproduce\nasexually. And asexuality is rampant in plants, fungi and bacteria. In\nfact, asexual reproduction is the prominent form of reproduction on\nEarth (Hull 1988, Templeton 1989). If one adopts an interbreeding\napproach to species, then most organisms do not form species. This\nseems a high price to pay for species monism. \n\nAnother objection to species pluralism is that pluralism is an overly\nliberal position (Sober 1984, Ghiselin 1987, and Hull 1987).  Pluralists\nallow a number of legitimate species concepts, but how do pluralists\ndetermine which concepts should be accepted as legitimate?  Should any\nspecies concept proposed by a biologist be accepted? What about those\nconcepts proposed by non biologists? Without criteria for determining\nthe legitimacy of a proposed species concept, species pluralism boils\ndown to a position of anything goes. \n\nSpecies pluralists respond to this objection by suggesting criteria\nfor judging the legitimacy of a proposed species concept.\n(Dupré 1993, Ereshefsky 2001). Such criteria can be used to\ndetermine which species concepts should be accepted into the plurality\nof legitimate species concepts. Candidate criteria are the epistemic\nvirtues that scientists typically use for determining the scientific\nworthiness of a theory. For example, in judging a species concept, one\nmight ask if the theoretical assumptions of a concept are empirically\ntestable. The Biological Species Concept relies on the assumption that\ninterbreeding causes the existence of stable lineages.  It also\nassumes that organisms that cannot interbreed do not form stable\nlineages. Whether interbreeding and only interbreeding causes the\nexistence of stable lineages is empirically testable. So the\nBiological Species Concept has the virtue of empirical sensitivity.\nOther criteria for judging species concepts include intertheoretic\ncoherence and internal consistency.  Pluralists can provide criteria\nfor discerning which concepts should be accepted as legitimate. Thus\nthe ‘anything goes’ objection can be answered. \n\nA recent response to species pluralism is de Queiroz’s (1999, 2005,\n2007) General Lineage Concept.  De Queiroz suggests that despite\ndifferences among various species concepts, all such concepts agree on\none thing: species are “separately evolving metapopulation\nlineages” (2005, 1263).  De Queiroz writes that his conception\nof species is the “single, more general, concept of\nspecies” that reconciles all other species concepts (2007, 880).\nWhat is the relationship between the General Lineage Concept and those\nconcepts?  De Queiroz suggests that the General Lineage Concept\nprovides the necessary criterion for being a species.  The properties\nthat other species concepts disagree over, for example, a lineage’s\noccupying a unique niche, being monophyletic, or being reproductively\nisolated, are contingent properties of species.  They are\n“secondary” properties of species (de Queiroz 2005, 1264).\nAll species taxa must be metapopulation lineages, but they can vary in\ntheir secondary properties.  De Queiroz contrasts the necessary\nproperty of species from their secondary properties in another way.\nWhereas the necessary property cited by the General Species Concept\ncaptures the fundamental nature of species, the secondary properties\nof species are merely “operational criteria” (2007, 882)\nfor “inferring the boundaries and numbers of species”\n(2005, 264).  According to de Queiroz, disagreements among other\nspecies concepts merely concern operational and evidential issues.\nProponents of other species concepts are confusing\n“methodological” disagreements with\n“conceptual” ones (de Queiroz 2005, 1267).   \n\nOne potential problem with de Queiroz’s attempt to unify the species\ncategory is that proponents of other species concepts would disagree\nwith de Queiroz’s assertion that their disagreements are merely over\nevidence for the numbers and boundaries of species.  Proponents of the\ninterbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic approaches believe that\nthey are identifying different types of lineages (interbreeding\nlineages, ecological lineages, phylogenetic lineages), not merely\ndisagreeing over evidence for the same type of lineage.  For example,\nwhen supporters of the interbreeding approach say that asexual\norganisms do not form species they are making a conceptual or\nontological claim, not an operational claim.  De Queiroz’s unified\napproach seems to mischaracterize disagreements among proponents of\nother species concepts.   \n\nAnother problem is how the General Lineage Concept distinguishes\nspecies from higher taxa.  According to de Queiroz, species are single\nlineages whereas higher taxa are clades of multiple lineages.  What,\nthen, distinguishes a single lineage from a branch with multiple\nlineages according to the General Lineage Concept?  De Queiroz (2005,\n1265) writes that the General Lineage Concept does not need to cite\nthe secondary properties mentioned in other species concepts to answer\nthis.  However, de Queiroz offers no alternative criteria for\ndetermining when a single lineage becomes a branch of multiple\nlineages.  Moreover, the secondary properties of other species\nconcepts are commonly used to make that determination.  Therein lies a\nproblem with the General Lineage Concept’s attempt to unify the\nspecies category.  According to the General Lineage Concept, species\nare lineages.  But to determine what is a lineage we must turn to\nother species concepts, and in doing so the heterogeneity of the\nspecies category rears its head again.  De Queiroz attempts to unify\nthe species category by asserting that all and only lineages are\nspecies.  But that just masks the heterogeneity of the species\ncategory because what constitutes a lineage has multiple answers, and\nthose answers vary according to which species concept one adopts. \n\nMuch of the debate over species pluralism focuses on multicellular\norganisms.  In other words, the debate focuses on how to sort mammals,\nbirds, fish, plants, and other multicellular organisms into species.\nHowever, most of life is not multicellular.  Most organisms in the\nworld are single cell microbial organisms (Rossello-Mora and Amann\n2001).  Just as biologists sort multicellular organisms into species,\nmicrobiologists sort microbial organisms into species.  Advancements\nin genetic technology in the last twenty yeas have caused an increase\nin taxonomic work in microbiology, including ways to think about\nmicrobial species.  Microbial biologists have their own species\nconcepts—definitions of ‘species’ that apply to only microbial\norganisms.  Microbial species concepts vary, and as we shall see,\ncross-classify microbial organisms into different species.  Once again\nwe come to the question of species pluralism. \n\nConsider some of the species concepts developed by microbiologists.\nOne microbial species concept, the Recombination Species Concept,\nasserts that species are groups of microbes whose genomes can\nrecombine (Dykuizen and Green 1991).  The motivation behind this\nspecies concept is that though microbes generally do not reproduce\nsexually, they form gene pools of organisms connected by\nrecombination.  Another microbial species concept is Cohan’s\n(2001, 467) ecological concept in which a “species in the\nbacterial world may be understood as an evolutionary lineage bound by\necotype-periodic selection.” According to Nesbo et al. (2006)\nand others, these two microbial species concepts sometimes sort the\nsame organisms into different species.  A third microbial species\nconcept, the Phylo-Phenetic Species Concept (Rossello-Mora and Amann\n2001), is different than the first two.  While the Recombination and\nEcological Concepts are based on biological theory about the nature of\nmicrobial species, the Phylo-Phenetic Species Concept is designed to\nobtain stable classifications of species that can be used in medical\nand microbial research. \n\nYet another approach to microbial species uses genetic data to\ndetermine phylogenetic relations and assigns organisms to species\naccording to those relations.  Microbiologists use various types of\ngenetic data for recognizing microbial species, such as 16S rRNA\ngenes, DNA:DNA hybridization, ANI or average nucleotide identity, and\ncore or house-keeping genes.  Using such genetic data to classify\nmicrobes into species is complicated by the existence of lateral gene\ntransfer.  Lateral gene transfer occurs when microbes share genetic\nmaterial with microbes near them.  Lateral gene transfer is not the\ntransfer of genetic material due to reproduction, but a different way\nmicrobes share genes.  Lateral gene transfer is frequent in microbes.\n(See O’Malley 2014 for an explanation of lateral gene transfer.)\nGiven the frequent occurrence of lateral gene transfer among microbes,\ndifferent parts of a microbe’s genome will have different\nevolutionary histories.  Microbiologists use different genes when\nclassifying microbes into species.  As a result, they obtain different\nclassifications of species. \n\nStepping back from these details, we see that depending on the\nmicrobial species concept or the type of genetic data used,\nmicrobiologists will obtain different species classifications for a\nparticular set of organisms.  One might wonder if this situation gives\nus reason to be species pluralists when it comes to microbiology.  Is\none microbial species concept, or one type of genetic data, better\nthan all the rest and we should adopt monism?  Or is there no best way\nto sort microbes into species but a variety of equally adequate ways?\nIf the latter is correct then we should be pluralists concerning\nmicrobial species.  For further discussion of microbiology and species\npluralism, see O’Malley and Dupré 2007, Franklin 2007,\nMorgan and Pitts 2008, Doolittle and Bapteste 2007, Doolittle and\nZhaxybayeva 2009, Ereshefsky 2010b, and O’Malley 2014. \n There is one other item concerning species pluralism worth\ndiscussing.  Suppose one accepts species pluralism. The term\n‘species’ then refers to different types of lineages. Some\nspecies are groups of interbreeding organisms, other species are\ngroups of organisms that share a common ecological niche, and still\nother species are phylogenetic units. Given that there are different\ntypes of species, one might wonder what feature causes these different\ntypes of species to be species?  \n\nPerhaps they share a common property that renders them species. If one\nadopts the thesis that all species are genealogical lineages, then a\ncommon feature of species is their being lineages. However, this\nfeature is also shared by other types of taxa in the Linnaean\nHierarchy. From an evolutionary perspective, all taxa, whether they be\nspecies, genera, or tribes, are genealogical lineages. We need to\nlocate a feature that is not only common in species but also\ndistinguishes species from other types of taxa. \n\nBiological taxonomists often talk in terms of the patterns and\nprocesses of evolution. Perhaps there is a process or a pattern that\noccurs in species but not in other types of taxa. Such a process or\npattern would unify the types of lineages we call\n‘species.’ Let us start with process. The Biological\nSpecies Concept highlights those species bound by the process of\ninterbreeding. The Ecological Species Concept identifies those species\nunified by stabilizing selection. The species highlighted by\nPhylogenetic Species Concepts are unified by such historical processes\nas genetic and developmental homeostasis. A survey of these different\nspecies concepts reveals that species are bound by different types of\nprocesses. So no single type of process is common to all\nspecies. Arguably, none of these processes are unique to species\neither (Mishler and Donoghue 1982). \n\nWhat about pattern? Do species display a pattern that distinguishes\nthem from other types of taxa? If by pattern we mean ontological\nstructure, then species have different patterns. Species are\nindividuals, but they are different types of individuals. Species of\nasexual organisms and species of sexual organisms have different\nstructures. Both types of species contain organisms that are\ngenealogically connected to a common ancestor. But the organisms in a\nsexual species are also connected by interbreeding. Thus species of\nsexual organisms form causally integrated entities: within a given\ngeneration, their members exchange genetic material through sexual\nreproduction. Species of asexual organisms do not form causally\nintegrated entities: their organisms are merely connected to a common\nancestor. \n\nThere are other suggestions for the common and unique pattern of\nspecies. Many observe that the organisms of a species often look the\nsame or that the organisms of a species share a cluster of reoccurring\nproperties. To the extent that this is true, it is also true of genera\nand some other higher taxa. The members of some genera tend to look the\nsame and have a cluster of stable properties. Another suggestion for\nthe pattern that distinguishes species is their ability to evolve as a\nunit—species are the units of evolution, other types of taxa\nare not. But again, many higher taxa have such unity as well (Mishler\nand Donoghue 1982). \n\nThe above survey of candidate unifying features is far from\nexhaustive. But the result is clear enough. Species vary in their\nunifying processes and ontological structure. Furthermore, many\nfeatures that biologists and philosophers highlight as unique to\nspecies occur in many higher taxa as well. Given this survey, what\nposition should we adopt concerning the nature of species? There are\nseveral options. According to one option we should keep looking for\nthe unifying feature of species. This is the option favored by some\nmonists (Sober 1984). Contemporary\nbiology may not have discovered the unifying feature of species, but\nthat does not mean that biology will not find such a feature in the\nfuture. To give up the search for the unifying nature of species would\nbe too hasty. \n\nAnother option starts with the assumption that the search for the\nunifying feature of species has gone on long enough. Biologists have\nlooked long and hard for the correct definition of\n‘species.’ The result of that search is not that we do not\nknow what species are. The result is that the organic world contains\ndifferent types of species.  The conclusion drawn by some pluralists\n(Kitcher 1984, Dupré 1993) is that the term\n‘species’ should be given a disjunctive\ndefinition. Species are either interbreeding lineages, or ecological\nlineages, or phylogenetic units, or …. \n\nA third option, like the previous one, assumes that biologists have\nlooked long enough for the unifying feature of species. In that\nsearch, biology has learned that there are different types of lineages\ncalled ‘species.’ But proponents (Ereshefsky 1998) of this\noption do not opt for a disjunctive definition of\n‘species.’ According to this option, we should doubt the\nvery existence of the category species. Those lineages we call\n‘species’ vary in their patterns and\nprocesses. Furthermore, the distinction between species and other\ntypes of taxa is riddled with vagueness. Consequently, we should doubt\nwhether the term ‘species’ refers to a real category in\nnature.  \n\nTo better understand this third option it is useful to see more\nprecisely what is being doubted. Biologists make a distinction between\nthe species category and species taxa. Species taxa\nare the individual lineages we call ‘species.’ Homo\nsapiens and Canis familiaris are species taxa. The\nspecies category is a more inclusive entity. The species category is\nthe class of all species taxa. The third option does not call into\nquestion the existence of Homo sapiens or Canis\nfamiliaris or any other lineage that we call\n‘species.’ The third option just calls into question the\nexistence of the categorical rank of species. (For a recent defence of the reality of the species category see Currie 2016.) \n\nWhat did Darwin mean by the word ‘species’? Answers to\nthat question vary (see Ghiselin 1969, Mayr 1982, Beatty 1992, Stamos\n2007, Mallet 2008, Kohn 2008, Wilkins 2009, and Ereshefsky 2010c).  Nevertheless, it seems that Darwin was an anti-realist when it\ncomes to the species category, though a realist concerning those taxa\ncalled ‘species’ by competent naturalists.  Consider what\nhe wrote to his friend, the botanist Joseph Hooker. \n\nFor Darwin, the word ‘species’ is indefinable.  And he\nthought it was indefinable because he was skeptical of the distinction\nbetween species and varieties.  For example, in the Origin of\nSpecies, he writes, “I look at the term species as one\narbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals\nclosely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ\nfrom the term variety” (1859 [1964], 52).  In other words,\n‘species’ is indefinable because there is no difference\nbetween species and varieties.  But why would Darwin think there is no\ndistinction between species and varieties?  Darwin offers three\nreasons (Ereshefsky 2010c).  First, Darwin argues that no\nprocess distinguishes varieties from species.  Second, he contends\nthat any differences drawn between them lie on a seamless continuum\nand are drawn for pragmatic reasons.  Third, Darwin rejects the\ndistinction between varieties and species because it is built on ideas\nconcerning creation rather than natural selection.  In what follows we\nwill just look at why Darwin thought there was no process difference\nbetween species and varieties. \n\nChapter 8 of the Origin of Species titled\n“Hybridism” is devoted to discussing whether hybrid\nsterility serves as an adequate criterion for distinguishing species\nfrom varieties.  Such naturalists as John Ray and Buffon held that\nhybrid sterility marked the species/variety boundary.  They believed\nthat offspring from parents of different species are sterile, whereas\noffspring from parents of different varieties of the same species are\nfertile.  Much of Darwin’s chapter on hybridism is dedicated to\nproviding counterexamples to the claim that hybrid sterility marks a\ndistinction between species and varieties.  In the end, Darwin rejects\nhybrid sterility as a criterion for distinguishing species and\nvarieties.  He writes, “It can thus be shown that neither\nsterility nor fertility affords a clear distinction between species\nand varieties” (1859 [1964], 248).  \n\nFurther evidence that Darwin doubted a process distinction between\nspecies and varieties is found in Chapter 4 of the Origin,\ntitled “Natural Selection.” Darwin proposes two\nprinciples, which he calls The Principle of Character Divergence and\nThe Principle of Extinction.  Together these principles explain the\norigin of new taxa and morphological gaps among taxa.  The Principle\nof Character Divergence has a familiar Darwinian starting point.\nSuppose that a geographic region contains several closely related\ngroups of organisms.  Within one of those groups, some organisms are\nselected because they have a trait that gives them an adaptive\nadvantage.  Divergent selection occurs in future generations when\norganisms with even better adapted forms of that trait are selected,\neventually causing pronounced morphological gaps between that group of\norganisms and its parent and sister groups (Darwin 1859 [1964],\n112ff.).  Darwin illustrates this process with a number of examples.\nConsider his example of a pigeon fancier (1859 [1964],112).  A pigeon\nfancier is struck by the slightly longer beak of some birds.  He then\nselects birds with slightly longer beaks in that generation, and\ncontinues to do so in subsequent generations until there is a\npronounced morphological gap between the selected group and the\noriginal stock.  Darwin argues that the process of divergent selection\ncauses the origin of new taxa and is the source of branching on the\ntree of life.    \n\nThe Principle of Extinction further explains the gaps we find in\nbiodiversity.  As groups become more distinctive and better adapted to\ntheir environment, their parental and sister groups are pushed to\nextinction.  This extinction of “intermediates,” as Darwin calls them,\ncauses the observed gaps among taxa (1859 [1964],121ff.).  Extinction,\nin other words, prunes branches on tree of life so that it has the\nshape we observe.  Together, the Principles of Character Divergence\nand Extinction explain the origin of varieties and species, and the\nobserved patterns of biodiversity in the world.  The relevant point\nfor our discussion of Darwin is that there is no special speciation\nmechanism that marks the difference between species and varieties.  As\nKohn (2008) notes, Darwin did not use the word ‘speciation’ in\nthe Origin.  For Darwin, the origin of varieties and species\nis due to divergent selection.  As Darwin writes: “The origin of\nthe existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with\nvarieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various\ndegrees of modification” (1859 [1964], 423).   \n\nThus far it has been suggested that Darwin doubted the existence of\nthe species category because he doubted the distinction between\nspecies and varieties.  What about those taxa called\n‘species’ by competent naturalists, are they real taxa for\nDarwin?  It seems that Darwin was a realist when it comes to taxa.  A\npassage at the start of the Origin’s chapter on\nclassification, Chapter 13, confirms this.  Darwin writes that\n“[f]rom the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to\nresemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed\nin groups under groups.  This classification is evidently not\narbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations”\n(1859 [1964], 411).  Those taxa (“groups”) identified by\ncompetent naturalists can be real.  And classifications of groups\nwithin groups, if properly constructed, reflect the hierarchical\narrangement of taxa in the world.  Thus, Darwin’s skepticism of the\nspecies category did not extend to taxa and those taxa called\n‘species.’ \n\nThis encyclopedia entry started with the observation that at an\nintuitive level the nature of species seems fairly obvious. But a\nreview of the technical literature reveals that our theoretical\nunderstanding of species is far from settled. The debate over the\nnature of species involves a number of issues. One issue is their\nontological status: are species natural kinds or individuals? A second\nissue concerns pluralism: should we adopt species monism or species\npluralism? A third issue, and perhaps the most fundamental issue, is\nwhether the term ‘species’ refers to a real category in\nnature. Even Darwin, it seems, doubted that ‘species’\nrefers to a real category in nature.","contact.mail":"ereshefs@ucalgary.ca","contact.domain":"ucalgary.ca"}]
