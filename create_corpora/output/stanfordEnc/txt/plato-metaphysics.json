While generally\naccurate and certainly useful for pedagogical purposes, no rigid\nboundary separates the parts. Ethics, for example, concerns how one\nought to live and focuses on pleasure, virtue, and happiness. Since,\naccording to Plato (and Socrates), virtue and happiness require\nknowledge, e.g., knowledge of goods and evils, Plato's ethics is\ninseparable from his epistemology. Epistemology is, broadly speaking,\nthe study of what knowledge is and how one comes to have knowledge.\nAmong the many topics included in epistemology are logic, belief,\nperception, language, science, and knowledge. (‘Science’\nderives from the Latin ‘scientia’, which in turn\ntranslates the Greek ‘episteme’, from which\nEnglish derives ‘epistemology’.) Integral to all of these\nnotions is that they (typically) are directed at something. Words refer\nto something; perception (aesthesis in Greek) involves\nperceptibles; knowledge requires a known. In this respect, epistemology\ncannot be investigated without regard to what there is.\n\n\n\nMetaphysics, or alternatively ontology, is that branch of philosophy\nwhose special concern is to answer the question ‘What is\nthere?’ These expressions derive from Aristotle, Plato's student.\nIn a collection of his works, the most detailed treatise on the general\ntopic of things that are comes after a treatise on natural things,\nta phusika (from which English derives\n‘physics’). Since the Greek for ‘after’ is\nmeta, this treatise is titled ‘Metaphysics’. In\nthat work one finds the famous formula that (first) philosophy studies\nbeing—the Greek for which is on—qua being. Hence the\naccount of being is ‘ontology’—the English suffix\n‘-ology’ signifying ‘study of’: e.g., biology\nis the study of living things.\n\n\n\nMetaphysics, then, studies the ways in which anything that\nis can be said or thought to be. Leaving to sciences like biology or\nphysics or mathematics or psychology the task of addressing the special\nways in which physical things, or living things, or mathematical\nobjects, e.g., numbers, or souls (minds) come to have the peculiar\nqualities each, respectively, has, the subject-matter of metaphysics\nare principles common to everything. Perhaps the most general principle\nis: to be is to be something. Nothing just exists, we might say. This\nnotion implies that each entity/item/thing has at least some one\nfeature or quality or property. Keeping at a general level, we can\nprovisionally distinguish three factors involved when anything is\nwhatever it is: there is that which bears or has the property, often\ncalled the ‘subject’, e.g., Socrates, the number three, or\nmy soul; there is the property which is possessed; e.g., being thin,\nbeing odd, and being immortal; and there is the manner or way in which\nthe property is tied or connected to the subject. For instance, while\nSocrates may be accidentally thin, since he can change, that is, gain\nand lose weight, three cannot fail to be odd nor, if Plato is correct,\ncan the soul fail to be immortal. The metaphysician, then, considers\nphysical or material things as well as immaterial items such as souls,\ngod and numbers in order to study notions like property, subject,\nchange, being essentially or accidentally.\n\n\n\nThree predecessors heavily influenced Plato's thoughts on metaphysics\nand epistemology, Heraclitus (c. 540 B.C.–480–70),\nParmenides (c.515 B.C.–449–40), and Socrates (470\nB.C.–399). Only fragments remain of the writings of Parmenides\nand Heraclitus, including some contained in the dialogues of\nPlato. Socrates wrote nothing. Plato's depiction of his teacher is our\nprimary source of evidence for his philosophy. Parmenides argued that\nthere is and could be only one thing, Being. One could not\neven think or say what is not. Moreover, since change implies that\nsomething comes to be what it was not—I change\nfrom not being tan to\nbeing tan, nothing can change. Reality is static. The\nappearance of change is just that, a deceptive appearance.\nUnfortunately, what little we have left of Parmenides does not allow us\nto decide whether he argued that there is just one item,\nBeing, in his universe—strict numerical monism—or\nwhether there is just one kind of thing, beings or things that\nare. Parmenides' account of Being seems to have contributed to Plato's\ndoctrine of Forms. \n\nHeraclitus is the apostle of change. For Heraclitus, the ordinary\nobjects of the physical world seem to be continually changing. The only\nconstant, the underlying commonality, is the pattern of change itself.\nThat there are entities that do not change is, for Heraclitus, an\nillusion. Heraclitus' notion of ‘flux’ seems to have\ninfluenced Plato's thinking about ordinary material objects. \n\nIn the opinion of most scholars, the seminal influence on all of\nPlato's thinking was Socrates. However, it appears from the writings of\nPlato, as well as those of the historian Xenophon and the comic poet\nAristophanes, that Socrates was almost exclusively interested in\nethics. This is not to say that metaphysical or epistemological issues\nwere of no concern to him. Rather, these sources convey the impression\nthat Socrates was not particularly interested in articulating a\nmetaphysical or epistemological\n theory (see Vlastos 1991a).\n Rather, concerned with\ncaring for the soul so that one might live happily (Apology\n29d-30b), he uses both epistemological and metaphysical theses in\nsearch of answers to his ethical questions. However, it is not easy to\ndistinguish when one is engaged in metaphysical theorizing from when is\nmerely using metaphysical notions. The claim that Socrates was not a\nmetaphysician or epistemologist is particularly hard to evaluate, for\nwe have basically only Plato's dialogues as evidence. Since Plato uses\nSocrates as a mouthpiece in many of his writings, readers are forced to\nask when or whether one is reading the doctrines of Socrates, or Plato,\nor neither. This ‘Socratic question’ is intimately involved\nwith the question of Plato's development and the chronology of his\ndialogues. \n\nIn all likelihood, Plato wrote different dialogues at different\ntimes. We typically divide his writings into three periods. In the\nearly ‘Socratic’ period, we find Apology,\nCrito, Euthyphro, Charmides, Ion,\nLysis, Laches, Hippias Minor,\nMenexenus, Euthydemus and the Protagoras.\nThe Hippias Major, Gorgias and perhaps the\nMeno belong to the end of this period, maybe with the\nGorgias and more likely the Meno verging into the\nmiddle period. The middle period works include the Cratylus,\nSymposium, Phaedo, Republic and perhaps the\nPhaedrus. In the post-Republic phase we then find the\nParmenides, Theaetetus, Sophist,\nPoliticus, Timaeus, Philebus and\nLaws, along with the\n Critias.[1]\n The Socratic dialogues,\nso-called because Socrates is always the chief interlocutor, are\nthought to present doctrines of Socrates himself. These are dialogues\ndevoted to ethical inquiries into the virtues, e.g., what is courage,\nor what is justice? In contrast, the middle period dialogues are\nthought to present the views of Plato, though nonetheless Socrates\nremains the speaker. Here for the first time we find remarks about the\nimmortality of the soul, about special entities called\n‘Forms’ that exist outside of space and time and that are\nboth the objects of knowledge and somehow the cause of whatever\ntranspires in the physical world, and the doctrine of recollection, the\nthesis that the immortal soul, in a disembodied state prior to its\nincarceration in a body, viewed these Forms, knowledge of which is then\nrecalled by incarcerated souls through a laborious process. Socrates,\nin the early Apology, is non-committal about the immortality\nof the soul. Similarly, in the early dialogues we find that Socrates,\nin keeping with the claim that he is neither a metaphysician nor\nepistemologist, has nothing to say about recollection and never\nexplicitly appeals to Forms. It is thus in the middle period works that\none locates Plato's first thoughts about epistemological and\nmetaphysical issues. To those topics we shall turn shortly. But these\nare, in the eyes of many, just first thoughts; for the dialogues in the\nlate period suggest changes to key ethical, epistemological and\nmetaphysical doctrines found in these middle period works. Over the\ncourse of the last fifty years, scholars have debated whether and to\nwhat extent Plato changed his views. The debate has grown so involved\nthat it is perhaps best not to worry whether anyone believes the\nextreme positions that, on the one hand, Plato conceived of every one\nof his major doctrines before he ever wrote, or, on the other hand,\nthat he changed his mind on central theses from one dialogue to the\nnext. Broadly speaking, those who maintain that Plato keeps to his\ncentral theses from one period to the next are\n Unitarians (see, for instance, Shorey 1903).\n Those who\nbelieve that he changes his views from one period to the next are\n Developmentalists (see, for instance, Owen 1986a).\n The most plausible position, and the perhaps\nthe dominant position in the contemporary scholarship, is somewhere in\nthe middle. About some theses, Plato, over the course of his writings,\nexpands his thoughts, recognizes difficulties, and even changes his\nmind. About other theses he stands by his fundamental insights. \n\nA prime example of the interpretative problems facing the student of\nPlato is the development of his most distinctive doctrine, the theory\nof Forms. Aristotle, in recounting Plato's intellectual development,\nreports that “Socrates was the first to seek the universal in\nethical matters but that he did not separate it. Plato, marrying\nSocrates' philosophy with that of Heraclitus, separated the universal,\non the grounds that the sensible order, where Socrates had focused, was\nin flux.” Plato, Aristotle tells us, called these separated\nuniversals ‘Forms’ (Metaphysics 1078b12–34).\nUniversal is a technical notion in metaphysics: a universal is that\nwhich is predicable of many. It is meant to capture the intuition that\na variety of things can all have the same feature or property. For\ninstance, a bowling ball, a basketball, and a figure drawn on a\nblackboard can all be round. What many things have in common, or a\nfeature they share, is a universal or, in Plato's terms, a Form. Of\ncourse there seems to be a huge number of properties. Many different\nthings are white. Many different things are animals. Each (shared)\nproperty is a universal—a ‘one over many instances,’\nwhiteness over the many white things, roundness over the many round\nthings, and so on. Thus, for Plato, Roundness and Whiteness are\nForms. Following the lead of Aristotle, scholars have focused on\nwhat it means for Plato, in contrast to Socrates, to have separated his\nuniversals, the Forms. The starting point, then, for the study of\nPlato's metaphysics, is the Socratic dialogues and Socrates'\ninvestigation into universals of the ethical variety, namely Justice,\nPiety, Courage and others. \n\nIn the early dialogues, Socrates seeks these ethical universals\nthrough a distinctive mode of inquiry, the\n ‘elenchus’ (see Vlastos 1992; Kraut 1983).\n Elenctic inquiry is fundamentally a form of\ncross-examination, where Socrates tries to elicit from others their\nbeliefs about matters of justice or piety, etc. Typically the result is\nthat his interlocutors turn out to have an inconsistent set of beliefs\nabout the virtues. At the heart of the Socratic elenchus is the\n‘What is X’ question (where\n‘X’ typically names an ethical property). The\nanswers offered to these questions fail usually because they are too\nnarrow or too wide. An answer is too narrow if it fails to include all\ncases. An answer is too wide if, while it includes all cases of, for\ninstance, piety, it also includes other things, cases of justice or\nimpiety. We can infer from these failed definitions a set of conditions\nSocrates places on an adequate answer to his ‘What is\nX’ questions. He is seeking an answer which picks out a\nSocratic Property, e.g., Piety, that is a universal such that: it is\nfound whenever and wherever there is an instance of Piety; and it\n‘causes’ or ‘makes’ the instance to be such as\nit is. Piety's power to make, e.g., Socrates, pious derives from\nPiety's itself being pious. Piety self-predicates: Piety is pious.\nBecause it is pious, when Piety is present to/in Socrates, Piety causes\nSocrates to be pious. In the Socratic dialogues Plato does not\ndistinguish the (metaphysical) way in which Socrates is pious from the\nway in which Piety is pious—in these dialogues there appears to be\njust one ontological predication relation. One has knowledge of a\nSocratic Property when she can give an account (logos) that\nsays what X is, that is, when she can give the definition of\nthe property under investigation. Treating a definition as a linguistic\nitem, we can say that the definition specifies or picks out the\nessence (ousia) of the property, and a definitional\nstatement predicates the essence of the property whose essence it is.\nIt is unclear from the Socratic dialogues whether any other property is\npredicated of a Socratic Property: arguably Piety is pious and only\npious. In contrast, the things that are pious, e.g., Socrates or saying\na prayer, have many properties. From what we can infer from Plato's\nremarks in these early dialogues, and from Aristotle's remarks, a\nSocratic property is in the sensibles—It is an\nimmanent universal. In this respect, the essence of Piety is\nalso found in Socrates (and thus the linguistic definition of Piety is\nalso linguistically predicable of Socrates). Plato's distinctive\n‘separation of the universal’ might then be viewed as his\nrejection of Socrates' assumption that the universal (and/or its\nessence) is in the sensibles, (and accordingly a rejection of Socrates'\nassumption that the definition is predicable, or predicable in the same\nway, of the sensible instances as well as the universal.) If Aristotle\nis right, Plato's problem with sensibles is that they change. \n\nThe Phaedo is Plato's eulogy to Socrates. It recounts the\nlast hours of Plato's teacher. Socrates/Plato wants to convince us that\nwe should care about our souls and that the best way to care for the\nsoul is to live philosophically. Towards that end we find a series of\narguments whose aim is to prove the immortality of the soul. At least\nthree of these arguments, the Argument from Recollection and its\nprelude (65a-67a and 72e-78b), the Affinity Argument (78b-84b), and the\nFinal Argument (102a-107a) and its prelude (95a-102a), are crucial for\nunderstanding Plato's initial thoughts on metaphysics and epistemology.\nHere Plato draws a contrast between unchanging Forms and changing\nmaterial particulars. Unfortunately, neither in the Phaedo nor\nin any other dialogue do we find Plato giving a detailed description of\nthe nature of Forms, or particulars, or their interaction. What is\nreferred to as Plato's theory of Forms is thus a rational\nreconstruction of Plato's doctrine. In such a reconstruction scholars\ntry to determine a set of principles or theses which, taken together,\nallow us to show why Plato says what he does about Forms, souls, and\nother metaphysical items. In the attempt to make more precise what\nPlato is after, one risks attributing to Plato notions that are either\nnot his or not as well developed in Plato as scholars would hope.\nPerhaps the notion of a particular is such a case. Intuitively,\nparticulars are things like my dog Ajax, Venus, my computer, and so on,\nthe ordinary material things of the everyday spatio-temporal world.\n(But we also speak of particular actions, particular events, particular\nsouls, and much else.) In a rational reconstruction, we can be\nmore precise by stipulating, for instance, that a particular is that of\nwhich properties are predicated and which is never predicated of\nanything (or anything other than itself). This ‘stipulated\ndefinition’ is nowhere in Plato, though it may well capture his\nthinking about ordinary particulars. For the sake of exposition, I will\nassume that in the Phaedo Plato is appealing to our\nnaïve, intuitive understanding of what it is for something to be a\nmaterial particular. In the author's opinion, the metaphysics of the\nPhaedo and other middle period works is devoted to developing\nthe account of Forms; perhaps because while most of us think that\nincluded in what there is are the various, e.g., dogs, people,\nmountains and trees, few of us ever think about whether there is some\nuniversal/Form, Justice Itself, The Large Itself, and so on, that\nexists outside of space and time. (In the late dialogues, especially\nthe Timaeus and Philebus, Plato attempts to give a\nsystematic account of material particulars.) \n\nThe argument of the Phaedo begins from Plato's assertion\nthat the soul seeks freedom from the body so that it may best grasp\ntruth, because the body hinders and distracts it: the soul comes to be\nseparate (choris) from the body, itself by itself ((aute\nkath auten) (64c5–8)). The senses furnish no truth; those senses\nabout the body are neither accurate nor clear. The soul reckons best\nwhen it is itself by itself, i.e., not in contact with body (65a-65d3).\nAt this juncture, Socrates changes course: \n\nThis is the first passage in the dialogues widely agreed to\nintroduce Forms. First, Forms are marked as auto kath auto\nbeings, beings that are what they are in virtue of themselves.\nIn subsequent arguments we learn other features of these Forms. From\nthe next argument concerning Recollection (see §11), Forms are said to\nbe perfect and what particulars strive to be like but fall short of.\nThen in the Affinity Argument we discover that Forms are simple or\nincomposite, of one form (monoeidetic), whereas particulars are\ncomplex, divisible and of many forms. In the crucial Final Argument,\nPlato finally presents the hypothesis of Forms to explain coming into\nbeing and destruction, in general, i.e., change. Once Cebes accepts the\nhypothesis, a novel implication is announced (100c3–7): \n\nIn this passage, Plato introduces two predication relations, Being\nand Partaking. Understanding how Being and Partaking function to\n‘tie’ together the various subjects and properties\nmentioned in his metaphysical discussions is crucial to reconstructing\nhis metaphysics and epistemology. At first blush, it seems that there\nare two kinds of subjects of which properties are predicated,\nnamely Forms and material particulars. (I exempt souls from this list).\nSimilarly, at first blush it seems that there are Forms for every\nproperty involved in the changes afflicting material\n particulars.[3]\n For instance, since particulars, e.g. Helen\nof Troy, change from being not-beautiful to being beautiful, there is\nthe Form Beauty Itself. In this passage, Plato asserts that particulars\nlike Helen, because she is not the Form but rather is a material\nparticular, is related to, or ‘tied to’ Beauty in virtue of\nwhat he calls ‘partaking.’ Beauty Itself, on the other\nhand, not being something ‘other than Beauty’, does not\npartake of Beauty—it simply is beautiful. Generalizing from what is\nsaid here about Beauty Itself, it seems that Forms inherit from the\nSocratic Properties their self-predicational status: Beauty is\nbeautiful; Justice is just; Equality is equal. Partaking in Beauty\nmakes Helen beautiful because Beauty Itself is beautiful. Call this way\nin which a Form is related to the property it is ‘Being’.\nUnderstanding Being, the way in which Beauty is beautiful, that is,\ndetermining what it is for a Form to self-predicate, is central to\nunderstanding Plato's Theory of Forms and his middle period\nmetaphysics. \n\nThe debate over self-predication involves both statements and what the\nstatements are about, i.e., the ontological correlates of those\nstatements. (Thus at times it may be important to distinguish\nlinguistic predication from ontological predication.) In investigating\nself-predication statements, perhaps it is again easiest to\ndistinguish three factors, the subject or subject term, ‘The\nJust’, the linking verb, ‘is’, and the predicate\nadjective ‘just’. Apparently both the subject and the\npredicate adjective, ‘The Just’ and ‘just’,\nrefer to the same thing, namely the Form of Justice. One question then\nconcerns the copula, or linking verb: in what manner is the predicate\nrelated to the subject, or how is the Form related to itself? There\nare three basic approaches to consider. In his seminal discussion of\nself-predication, Vlastos maintained that we should understand the\nrelation between the Form and itself to be the same as that between a\nparticular and the Form (Vlastos 1981d).  This is to say that Justice\nis just in the same was as Socrates is just, or that Beauty is\nbeautiful in the same way as Helen is beautiful, or that the Circle\nItself is circular in the same way as my basketball: both are\nround. Let us label this way of understanding the copula in\nself-predication statements ‘characterization’. Then\nBeauty is a beautiful thing, an item to be included in an inventory of\nbeautiful things right along with Helen. \n\nSome scholars, e.g., John Malcolm (1981), while accepting this\ncharacterizing reading of the ‘is’, deny that the property\npredicated of the Form and the particular are exactly the same.\nAccording to the Approximationist, the Form is the perfect\ninstance of the property it stands for. A particular that participates\nin the Form is an imperfect or deficient instance in that it has a\nproperty that approximates the perfect nature of the\nForm. For instance, the Circle Itself is perfectly circular. A drawn\ncircle, or a round ball, is deficient in that it is not perfectly\ncircular, not exactly 360 degrees in circumference. It follows that\nthe very properties particulars possess will differ from the\nproperty ‘of the same name’ possessed by the Form. If\nBeauty Itself is characterized by perfect beauty, then Helen has\nimperfect beauty and she does not have perfect beauty. Since nothing\nrules out that there are numerous kinds of imperfect beauty, perhaps\nas many as there are beautiful participants, it seems either that\nthere is no one kind of beauty that particulars have in common, or\nthat there are one or more (commonly shared) imperfect kinds of\nbeauty. In the former case, there will be no need to posit a\n‘one’ over the many beauties. In the latter case, there is\nevery reason to posit a Form(s) of Imperfect Beauty in which the\ncommonly qualified imperfect particulars participate. Neither\nalternative is a happy one. While the appeal to the perfection of the\nmathematical properties is great, even in these cases it is doubtful\nthat Plato adopts an approximationist strategy (see Nehamas 1999b;\n1999c). \n\nAn alternative is to allow that while both Beauty Itself and other\nitems are characterized by beauty, Beauty Itself is simply and solely\nbeautiful. This characterizing variant emphasizes the Phaedo's\nclaims that a Form is monoeides and one (Phaedo\n78b4ff). Beauty is nothing but beautiful and thus is completely\nbeautiful, differing from other beautiful things in that they are much\nelse besides beautiful. Helen is a woman and unfaithful and\n beautiful.[4] \n\nAccording to the second\n approach (see Cherniss 1977a; Allen 1965),\n self-predication\nstatements assert identity between the Form and its essence. The\n‘is’ is an ‘is’ of identity. We should not then\nunderstand ‘Beauty Itself is beautiful’ to assert that (the\nForm) Beauty is characterized by beauty. (Indeed, typically backers of\nthis approach exclude the possibility that a Form is characterized by\nthe property it is, thus, e.g., eliminating Beauty from a list of\nbeautiful objects.[5])\n Since Identity accounts treat\nself-predications as asserting that a Form and its essence are\nidentical, with respect to Forms, Being and Identity can be viewed as\nthe same relation in the middle period\n dialogues.[6] \n\nThe third approach, the Predicationalist (see Nehamas 1999c; Code\n1986; Silverman 2002), joins with the Identity approach in denying\nthat self-predication statements signal that the Form is characterized\nby the property it constitutes. And while ultimately it allows that a\nForm and its essence are identical, it does not regard the\nself-predication statement itself as an identity claim (see Code 1986;\nSilverman 2002 Ch. 3).  Rather, a self-predication claim asserts that\nthere is a special primitive kind of ontological relation between a\nForm (subject) and its essence (predicate). This approach begins from\nthe two relations of Partaking and Being introduced in the last\nargument of the Phaedo. An intuitive first approximation of\ntheir respective functions is to treat Partaking as a relation between\nmaterial particulars and Forms, the result of which is that the\nparticular is characterized by the Form of which it partakes. So,\nHelen, by partaking of Beauty, is characterized by beauty; Helen, in\nvirtue of partaking, is (or, as we might say, becomes) beautiful. All\nparticulars are characterized by the Forms in which each participates,\nand whatever each is, it is by partaking in the appropriate\nForm. On this account, then, there can be Forms for each and every\nproperty had by particulars (Phaedo 100–101, esp. 100c6). In\ncontrast to the characterizing relation of Partaking, the relation of\nBeing is always non-characterizing. Each Form, F, is its\nessence (ousia), which is to say that the relation of Being\nlinks the essence of beauty to the subject, Beauty\n Itself.[7]\n Being,\nthen, is a primitive ontological relation designed exclusively to\ncapture the special tie between that which possesses an essence and the\nessence possessed. Put differently, whenever essence is predicated of\nsomething, the relation of Being is at work. (By\n‘primitive’ I do not mean to suggest that Plato does not\nstudy (what) Being (is). Nor do I mean to suggest that everything else\nin the metaphysics can somehow be deduced from it. Rather, I mean to\nindicate that the relation of Being is not explained by appeal to\nanother more basic relation or principle. Its nature, and the nature of\nother primitives in the theory, such as Participating, is displayed in\nthe ways in which the theory attempts to save various phenomena.) \n\nThroughout the dialogues, Forms are said to be one, hen, or\nmonoeides. (See especially the Affinity Argument in the\nPhaedo, 78b-84b.) These passages suggest that the\nself-predicational nature of Forms implies that the only property\npredicable of a Form is itself: i.e., Justice is just and the only\nthing Justice is is just. (There are epistemological reasons that\nsupport this reading: See §11 infra.) But other passages\nsuggest that Forms cannot be simple in this strict sense. From the\nRepublic we know that all Forms are related to the Good. While\nit is difficult to be certain, Plato seems committed to the claim that\neach Form is good, that is, that each Form is a good thing or is\ncharacterized by\n goodness.[8] \n\nMore doubts about the strict simplicity of Forms emerge from\nreflection on the nature of definition in Plato's middle period.\nOntologically, all definitions predicate the essence of the Form whose\nessence it is. Plato is attempting to discover through scientific\ninvestigation, or (inclusive or) through an analysis of what words\nmean, or through any other method, what the nature of, say, Justice \nis—compare the ways in which philosophers and scientists work to\ndiscover what, e.g., gold, or red, or justice, is. Ultimately, then,\nthe answer to any ‘what is X?’ question will be\nsome specific formula unearthed at the end of much study. According to\nthis line of reasoning, the self-predication statements in the texts\nare promissory notes, shorthand for what will turn out to be the fully\narticulated definition. Plato is thus committed to there being Forms\nwhose nature or essence will ultimately be discovered. To say that\n‘Justice is just’ is then to stake a claim to the ultimate\ndiscovery of the nature of Justice. The problem is that the fully\narticulated linguistic definition, when it is ultimately discovered,\nwill turn out to be complex. For instance, Heat, one thing, is mean\nmolecular kinetic energy, a seemingly complex notion. So in Plato we\nfind (Republic, 441d) that Justice is Doing One's\nOwn, that a Name is (Cratylus, 388b) a tool that is\ninformative and separates nature, or, though Plato never says it,\nthat Human is rational bipedal animal. Since philosophical and\n(scientific progress) is supposed to teach not that Justice is just but\nwhat Justice is, at some level at least Forms cannot be considered to\nbe utterly and strictly simple. The problem is that given just two\npredication relations, it is unclear whether Plato thinks that Forms\npartake of the properties to which they are related or whether they are\nthose properties. \n\nThe best guide to the separation of Forms is the claim that each\nForm is what it is in its own right, each is an auto kath auto\nbeing. In asking ‘What is (the Form) F?’, Plato\nseeks what F is in a particular and special way: He\nseeks what F is independent from any of its material\ninstances, and in some sense independent of anything else, whether\nanother Form or the soul. What each Form is, what each Form is in its\nown right, it is in virtue of its essence, ousia. The\nconnection between the Form and the essence being predicated of it is\nexhibited in the Republic's formula that a given on\n(being) is completely or perfectly (477ff), as well as the so-called\nself-predication statements. According to the predicationalist reading,\nthe relation connecting an essence with that Form of which it is the\nessence is\n Being (see Code 1986, esp. 425–9).\n (I capitalize the ‘is’ used to\nrepresent the predication relation of Being, e.g., Justice Is just.)\nThe predicate in such self-predication statements stands for the (real)\ndefinition of the Form, conveniently captured by Nehamas' ‘what\nit is to be\n F’.[9]\n Each Form, then Is\nits essence. \n\nThe special relationship between a Form and its essence is captured\nin two principles \n\nII captures the ontological force of the expression that each Form\nis monoeides: of one essence. In light of these\nprinciples, and in keeping with the account of the ontological relation\nof Being, it follows that each Form self-predicates, in so far\nas each Form Is its essence. Self-predication statements are thus\nrequired of Forms, since every Form must Be its respective essence.\nSelf-predication, then, is a constitutional principle of the very\ntheory of Forms. A Form, then, is what it is in its own right in\nthat it Is its essence, and since the only thing it Is is its essence,\neach Form is monoeides, ‘of one essence’. In\nvirtue of Being its essence, each Form Is something regardless of\nwhether any particular does or even may participate in it. Thus each\nForm is separate from every particular instance of it.\nMoreover, since its essence is predicated of the Form independently\nfrom our knowledge of the Form or from its relation to another Form, a\nForm is not dependent on anything else. On this definitional\ninterpretation of separation, an item is separate just in case the\ndefinition (essence) is predicable of it and not of what it is alleged\nto be separate from. So, a Form is separate from particulars that\npartake of it, or any particular, if the essence is predicable of the\nForm and not predicable of the particular/s. Whether or not a Form is\nexistentially separate, i.e., whether it exists\nseparate from everything else, turns on whether one thinks that being\nan essence qualifies the Form as existing. To the extent that Plato\nrecognizes the notion of existence, since being an essence seems, by\nPlato's lights, to be the superlative way to be, it is likely that\nForms are both definitionally and existentially separate. \n\nThe middle period dialogues contain few arguments whose conclusion\nis that such and such a Form therefore exists. Even when\n‘argument’ is given a very broad reading, the dialogues\ntend to address themselves to a limited number of Forms. These include\nthe moral properties familiar from Socrates' ethical inquiries and\nproperties such as Beauty, Equality, Hot and Cold, or Largeness. While\nthese are not the only properties mentioned in the course of\ndiscussion, the Argument from Recollection, the arguments about the\nobjects of knowledge and the ‘summoners’ from Books V\n(477ff) and VII (523ff), respectively, of the Republic, as\nwell as the final ascent to Beauty in the Symposium and the\nFinal Argument of the Phaedoall point to a particular kind of\nproperty, what scholars have labeled ‘incomplete\n properties’ (see Fine 1993; Irwin 1977).\n There is no precise way to specify what\ncounts as an incomplete property. Roughly, the idea is that an\nincomplete property is one which, when serving as a predicate, yields a\nstatement that cannot be understood on its own, because they must be\nadded on to, or completed in some sense, typically with a prepositional\nphrase. For instance, the predicate ‘large’, functioning in\na statement such as ‘Shaquille O'Neal is large’ must be\ncompleted with ‘for a human’; for while Shaq is large for a\nhuman he is not large compared with a tree. For some readers, then,\nwhile the Plato of the middle period may believe in a wide range of\nproperties, he is theoretically committed only to a limited number or\nrange of Forms, namely Forms of incomplete properties. \n\nForms are limited to these incomplete properties because, on this\nline of reasoning, these properties present special problems when they\nare instantiated in particulars. Chief among these problems is\n‘the compresence of opposites’. This is the phenomenon\nwhere, with respect to any incomplete property, F, every\nsensible particular that is F is, in some sense, also\nnot-F. So, if Elsie the cow is large, she is also not-large;\nfor Elsie is large in comparison to her calf but not-large in\ncomparison to Elmer the bull. Thus Elsie is large and not-large. Since,\naccording to this approach, Plato is seeking a large that is the\nunqualified bearer of largeness, and since every particular is\ndisqualified in light of compresence, Plato postulates a Form,\nLargeness Itself, to be the unqualified bearer. By way of contrast,\nproperties such as being brown or being a cow do not suffer compresence\nwhen instantiated by particulars. That is, Elsie is a cow and is not\nnot-a-cow; she is brown (imagine she is brown all over) and is not\nnot-brown. (In the modern parlance, being a cow is classified as an\nessential property of Elsie whereas being brown is an accidental\nproperty. Thus the proponent of Forms only for incomplete properties\nlooks to a special subset of the accidental properties, namely those\nwhere there is no unqualified possessor.) \n\nIn order to appreciate fully the rationale for this account, one\nneeds to consider Plato's account of particulars, for the compresence\nof opposites is meant to capture in what sense particulars are\ndeficient with respect to Forms. Before turning to particulars, note\nthat it is left open by proponents of this position how we are to think\nof the nature of Forms and the self-predication statements involving\nForms, whether, for instance, ‘Largeness is Largeness' signals that\nLargeness is what it is to be largeness, identical with largeness, or a\nlarge item, maybe the largest thing there is. Rather, we are told that\nthe key notion is being completely. So, just as Elsie is completely a\ncow, so Largeness is completely large: Largeness is a complete bearer\nof an incomplete property. \n\nMetaphors dominate Plato's remarks about the relation of particulars\nto Forms. Of special importance are the metaphors of image and\noriginal, copy and model, example and paradigm. The physical world and\nall of its constituents are, according to Plato, a copy or image of the\nForms, and since all copies are dependent on the original, the physical\nworld is dependent on Forms. In so far as Platonic Forms are not\ndependent on particulars, i.e., they are not immanent universals, the\ndependence is only ‘one way’. A second important metaphor\nfrom the Phaedo also suggests that particulars are dependent\non Forms whereas Forms are not dependent on them. Particulars\nstrive to be such as the Forms are and thus in comparison to\nForms are imperfect or deficient. Forms, then, are independent, whereas\nparticulars are dependent on Forms and thus deficient with respect to\nthem. \n\nThe Phaedo (especially the Affinity Argument, 78b-84b) also\npoints up a host of features, usually found in pairs, which\ndifferentiate particulars from Forms. Forms are immaterial, non-spatial\nand atemporal. Particulars are material and extended in space and in\ntime. Forms do not change and may not even be subject to\nCambridge-change, i.e. relational changes involving, for instance, a\nsoul cognizing them at various moments. Particulars change, may even be\nsubject to change in any respect, and may even be subject to\nchange in every respect at any given moment, i.e., total\nHeraclitean flux. Particulars are complex or multi-form\n(polyeidetic) composites (suntheton), whereas Forms\nare pure, simple or uniform (monoeidetic, hen). Particulars\nare the objects of the senses and of belief. Forms are the objects of\nknowledge, grasped by the intellect through definitions, dialectic, or\notherwise. Particulars appear, and perhaps are, both F and\nnot-F for some property F: particulars suffer from\nthe compresence of opposites. The Form of F cannot be\nconceived to be not-F (and perhaps is never not-F).\nHence the Form, The F Itself, does not suffer compresence (at\nleast with respect to being F). \n\nAristotle's account of Plato's reasons for introducing Forms\nindicates that change and essence are critical to Plato's thinking\nabout the deficiency of material particulars. “…Socrates\nsought the universal in them and turned to definitions. Plato,\naccepting this, thought that this (defining) comes to be about\ndifferent things, and not about sensibles. For it is impossible that\nthe common definition be about any of the sensibles, for these are\nalways changing.” (Metaphysics 987b1–7) At the very\nbeginning, then, the search for knowledge leads to definitions. The\nquestion is where one can find definitions or definables. Aristotle\nasserts that Plato thought that definitions could not be found in the\nsensibles because they were always changing. \n\nFollowing Aristotle's lead, a most economical way to account for the\ncognitive superiority of Forms and the inferiority of sensibles would\nbe to allot essences only to the Forms. Since we know from the early\nand the middle dialogues that knowledge is of essence, it is tempting\nto think that the absence of essence is responsible for the deficiency\nof the particulars. Particulars are deficient because they can or do\nchange. They change because their properties are contingent. Their\nproperties are contingent because they lack any essences (or any\nessential properties). But this is too quick. First, Plato's\nparticulars may not change with respect to all of their properties.\nPerhaps some have essential properties along with a host of contingent\nproperties. Then Aristotle might be taken to imply that only with\nrespect to a certain number of contingent properties did Plato posit\ndefinable Forms. Moreover, Aristotle seems to allude only to an\nepistemological difficulty arising from changing particulars. It is\npossible that this difficulty arises independently of whether some\nparticulars have essential properties. For instance, particulars might\nbe epistemologically problematic because they have many properties,\nonly some of which are changing. \n\nCertain passages (e.g., Phaedo 74ff., 78ff.,\nRepublic 476e-479, 523aff) suggest that particulars are\ncognitively deficient because they are complex. Suppose that a\nparticular is F. Complexity entails that a particular has at\nleast two properties, F and G. Since the G\nis not-F, every complex particular can be said to be\nF and not-F. Our inability to grasp the property\n(F) in the particular is then grounded not in the compresence\nof an opposite property, but in the compresence of another\nproperty. The inquiring mind is unable to isolate the desired\nproperty from any other. This suggests that a fundamental contrast\nbetween the particulars and the Form F is that the latter is\nsimple, or monoeidetic, in that it possesses just itself—It is just\n F.[11] \n\nAt other times, the cognitive reliability of the Forms seems grounded\nin the analyticity, or logical certainty, or necessity, that holds\nbetween the essence of a Form and various properties\n‘discernible in its nature.’ Looked at in this light, the\nfactor responsible for the deficiency of sensibles is that their\nproperties are contingently related to them, in contrast to the Forms\nwhose properties are necessarily stuck to them with ‘logical\nglue’ (see Vlastos 1969; Code 1993). \n\nIf we emphasize the contingency of all of its properties, a\nparticular cannot have any essential properties. On the other hand, if\nwe emphasize the complexity of the particular, then we are free to\nascribe essences to (some) particulars. Hence, there could be knowledge\nof these particulars, i.e., knowledge that Socrates is a man.\nConversely, if complexity is the cause of cognitive deficiency, then\nwith respect to Forms, the fact that all their properties are necessary\nproperties would not suffice to render Forms knowable. For if\na Form has many properties, then in the broad sense the Form F\nItself, since it is F and G, will be F and\nnot-F. Thus Forms, too, might not be knowable. \n\nThere is reason to doubt that the compresence of opposites or the mere\ncomplexity of particulars is responsible for their deficiency (but see\nFine 1993, esp. Ch. 4).  According to Aristotle, change is critical,\nespecially in so far as it precludes definability and thus\nknowledge. Given that knowledge requires essence, and essence excludes\nchange (in the case of the essential properties), Aristotle would have\nus deny that essence is predicable of particulars for the Plato of the\nmiddle period. Particulars will be epistemologically deficient in that\nthere can be no knowledge of them, unless we abandon the thesis that\nknowledge is of essence. And particulars will be metaphysically\ndeficient, at least to the extent that possessing an essence is a\nbetter state than lacking one. But more can be said about the peculiar\ncontingent manner in which particulars have their properties and why\nit is that one cannot look to the particular beauties to obtain\nknowledge of, e.g., Beauty. \n\nFrom the outset of the Phaedo, particulars are branded as\nmaterial and, as a result, spoken of in the pejorative. Indeed, matter\nseems to be at the root of the other features that characterize\nparticulars. What is extended in space (and through, or in, time) is\nbody. The composite is also linked with the material. Because a\nmaterial particular is composite, it is also multi-form or complex\n(Phaedo 80b4). Complex material particulars are subject to\nchange in so far as their composite nature invites dissolution or\nconstruction, or more generally coming-to-be or\n perishing.[12]\n When\ntaken broadly, as it is at Phaedo 100ff (or in the analogies\nof the middle books of the Republic), generation and\ndestruction includes the exchange of properties. And since compresence\nrequires complexity, the material nature of particulars is one of the\nroots of each material, sensible particular being both F and\nnot-F. \n\nThe spatio-temporal, material character of particulars also\ncontributes directly to the explanation of their suffering, and seeming\nto suffer, the compresence of opposites. In the middle period, Plato\nseems to accept an account of perception that has as a necessary\ncomponent the interaction of material elements. There may be\nsubsequent or simultaneous psychic\n activity,[13]\n the judgment part of\n‘perceptual judgment’, but there is at least some material\nintercourse between the body of the perceived object and the sense\nfaculty whose sensory object it is. The qualifications needed to\naccount for a particular's being F and not-F are\ntemporal, or a function of being comparable to other extended material\nobjects, or standing in different relations to\n perceivers.[14]\n Since\nmaterial extension is a necessary condition for their perceptibility,\nno particular could appear to have compresent properties\nunless it were material. \n\nIn virtue of their material nature, particulars are extended,\nmutable, and subject to generation and destruction. How then is the\nmateriality of the particular related to the characterization for which\nparticipation is responsible? What materiality induces is that a\nproperty be manifested in a specific way. So, when we consider\na particular stick to ask what is its length, we expect to be told a\nspecific quantity: the stick is five inches long. The same is true of\nits weight: it is six ounces. If we are concerned to explain why the\nstick is that long, one answer is that the matter of the particular\ncompels it to have determinate\n length.[15]\n Only when we shift to\nthe question ‘What is length?’, do we begin to reflect upon\nthe relations between length and the fact that each of these material\nparticulars has a specific length. In the Meno (74ff), Plato\ndevelops the notion of determinable and determinate. There the\nproperties themselves are determinates falling under a determinable,\ne.g., crimson and scarlet under red, red under color. Now, the\nproperties under consideration are all generic or\ndeterminable, but when present in the particular they take on a\nspecific, determinate character. Consider, for instance, mathematical\nfigures. The Triangle itself will be a three-sided figure whose lines\nlack breadth and whose angles have no determinate degree. But all\nparticular triangles will have lines with some breadth and angles with\ncertain\n degrees.[16]\n There is, then, a gap between the\nnon-specific and non-determinate property and the way it is manifested\nin the particular. The immaterial Form of Triangle is abstract and can\nhave no particular dimension. The property in the particular,\non the other hand, must be specific and determinate—the property in\nthe particular is always a specific, determinate length, or color\n(hue), or size, or so on—because the particular is concrete, and\nbecause the property in the particular is itself a particular instance\nof the non-determinate property. \n\nThe determinacy of the material particular is set against the\nnon-determinacy of the Form. This determinacy of property is only one\naspect of the difference. A second is the contingent way in which the\nparticular has this determinate property. The material aspect is, in\nthe case of particulars, partly responsible for the contingency of its\nproperty possession. Matter is a sufficient condition for contingency\nbut not necessary, since souls are in many respects contingently what\nthey are, e.g., desirous of money. (Matter is also a sufficient\ncondition for complexity, though again not necessary, if souls, or\nForms, can be complex.) \n\nThe rigid separation of Forms from sensible particulars, Plato's\nidea that there are ‘Two Worlds’, is embodied in Plato's\nisolation of the two ways of being, Being and Partaking. The criteria\nand the properties which differentiate Forms and particulars are\nrelated to their respective ways of being, but mutability,\nextendedness, etc., are not equivalent to Partaking and they do not\nexplain it nor are they explained by it. Still, the deficiency of the\nsensible is aptly viewed in terms of its way of being, i.e., in virtue\nof the fact that every sensible acquires all of its properties through\nparticipation. The deficiency of the sensible is its deficient way\nof being. Lacking any essence, it can only fail to Be. \n\nThis notion of deficiency has a long pedigree. In one sense it is a\nnew way of cashing out the idea that Forms and particulars are\ndifferent kinds or types of\n entities.[17]\n It clearly is not an\nApproximation view or a view according to which Forms are treated as\nparadigmatic particulars. The very same property, Beauty, is related,\nvia Being, to the Form Beauty Itself that is related to the sensible\nparticular via Partaking. The beauty of Helen is not itself deficient,\nher way of having it is. And since beauty does not characterize Beauty,\nthere is no case to be made that Beauty Itself could be a\nparadigmatically beautiful object. It would appear, then, that only\nForms are definable, since essence is not predicated of particulars.\nBut it is not so simple. Based on the Phaedo's account of\nBeing and Participating (cf. Principles I and II, supra), we\ncan conclude that: \nand that \n\nFurthermore, since the Phaedo asserts that particulars are\nwhat they are in virtue of the Form's being what it Is, it follows\nthat \n\nThe motivation for this claim is our understanding of the thesis at\n100c that Beauty Itself alone Is beautiful and that other things\nacquire their beauty in virtue of partaking in what Is beautiful. The\ntraditional and obvious way to parse this claim is to allow that it is\nthe Form Itself which the particular has, for it seems that only the\nForm whose essence is Y, Is Y. But if this is true,\nthen if, as the Identity view maintains, the Form and its essence are\nidentical, it follows that the essence must also be predicable of\nthe particular. In which case it seems that the particulars do\nhave essences, albeit via Partaking, for they have something which is\nidentical with an essence. \n\nForm-copies, the-large-in-Socrates, the hot-in-fire, and such,\nprovide a way out of this predicament. There is no consensus as to\nwhether they are bona fide members of the ontology of the\nPhaedo (102bff). Many have argued that the so-called\nform-copies are nothing more than the Forms conceived of as inherent\nin, or immanent in, particulars, the particularization of the Form, or\nForms as they function in the participation\n relation.[18]\n But if Plato wishes to avoid the consequence of predicating Forms and,\nthus, essences directly of particulars, then there is a compelling\nreason for him to admit form-copies into his ontology. They differ\nfrom their parent Form in that they are singular or unit-properties,\nwhereas the Form is general and abstract. \n\nThe relation of the form-copy to the particular is a real problem.\nThe crucial issue is whether form-copies are dependent on particulars,\nespecially whether their claim to be individual or unit-properties is\nonly as good as the company they keep. Part of the difficulty results\nfrom the metaphor Plato's uses throughout the last stage of the Final\nArgument in the Phaedo. In anticipation of what will be his\nultimate ‘proof’ of the immortality of the soul, Plato\ncontends that when something possessed of an essential property, as for\ninstance snow possesses cold, is confronted by the\n‘opposite’, heat, then the-cold-in-the snow must withdraw\nor perish. (The soul, because it cannot perish, must therefore\nwithdraw.) Which of the two possibilities developed in the military\nmetaphor does Plato envisage for form-copies: do they ‘withdraw\nor perish’? It is a struggle to understand just what the military\nmetaphors amount to, but if the form-copies perish at the approach of\ntheir opposite, this suggests that form-copies are dependent on the\nparticulars to which they\n belong.[19]\n Those who deny that form-copies are bona fide beings cite\ntheir perishing as a principal reason to take them as nothing more\nthan a metaphor for the particular's (temporary) participation in the\nForm. Conversely, if they are able to withdraw, they are in some sense\nindependent from the particulars. In this fashion they are akin to\nindividual souls, since neither souls nor form-copies will be\ndependent for their existence on the particular to which they\ntemporarily belong. \n\nBut even if they withdraw and thus exist apart from the particulars,\ntheir individuality seems to be determined by the company they keep,\ne.g., Socrates, or this bit of snow.\n‘Belonging-to-Socrates’ is a relational property and seems\nto require that there be something, namely Socrates, to which the\nform-copy can belong. However, if form-copies are thus dependent on\nparticulars, there is a problem with respect to the nature of\nparticulars lurking in the Phaedo. For it seems that\nparticulars have all of their properties in virtue of participating in\nthe relevant Forms. Particulars, then, are ultimately to be identified\nin terms of the properties they have, namely their form-copies. But if\nthese form-copies, in turn, are themselves individuated by the\nparticulars whose form-copies they are, we are confronted with a\ncircle. \n\nPlato may be able to avoid this circle of individuation by not\nmaking form-copies depend on particulars for either their being or\ntheir individuation. If their status as individuals is primitive,\nform-copies will not be individuated by the particulars to which they\nbelong. In this respect they are like the individual souls, which,\nsince they pre-exist and postdate the particulars they inhabit, are not\nand cannot be individuated by them. A form-copy is, in the strict\nsense, a simple individual, incapable of possessing anything besides\n(the essence of) the Form of which it is a copy. Finally, they are not\ndependent on particulars, even for their individuation, because they\ncan withdraw when necessary and thus continue to be what they are when\nthe particular has perished. They can be said to perish, but\nonly in the sense that the particular to which they temporarily attach\ncan itself perish or change. (Were they dependent on the particular,\nform-copies would in fact perish.) The reason they survive is that a\nform-copy Is what it is. In so far as anything Is what it is, it cannot\ncease to be, i.e., cease to be what it Is. In this respect, too, they\nare like souls. Both souls and form-copies are then individuals in\ntheir own rights, apart from any particulars in which they inhere. \n\nForm-copies belong to particulars and derive or emanate, to borrow a\nneo-Platonic term, from Forms. Form-copies allow Plato to respond to a\nthreat posed by the metaphysics of Forms: to wit, that particulars\nmight be indiscernible. If particulars are nothing in their own right,\nand in the absence of both matter and form-copies, then particulars are\nmerely bundles of\n Forms;[20]\n but if they are bundles, then two particulars composed of the same\nForms would be indiscernible and identical. If we admit form-copies,\nparticulars are not bundles of Forms. Particulars will be bundles of\nform-copies. And unlike a Form, which would seem to have to be\nnumerically the same in each particular, the form-copies will differ\nfrom one another since they are distinct individual\nproperty-instances, not universals. However, while the particulars are\nno longer identical, this still allows that two bundles of\nform-copies could be indiscernible, since the form-copies of\nany one Form differ, it seems, solo numero. Helen's form-copy\nof Beauty cannot differ in quality from Andromache's, but their\nform-copies are distinct. If we allow that Helen and Andromache are\npresumed to be distinct particulars in virtue of their matter, we can\nfurther distinguish the particulars and the form-copies, i.e.\nthe-beautiful-in-Helen versus the beautiful-in-Andromache. Here again,\nthen, the assumption of the material particular is relevant. When\nPlato recognizes that he has yet to account for matter, and thus the\nindividuation of particulars, he has to compose the\nTimaeus. \n\nParticulars, then, have the properties they have because they have\nForm-copies derived from the Forms, which Are those properties. And\nwhen they inhere in the material particular, the particular has a\ndefinite, determinate property instance of Largeness or Beauty. The\nparticular is assumed to be a combination of matter and form-copies\n(and in some cases, soul). All the form-copies can be lost, for the\nparticular has no essential properties or essence, and so too the soul\ncan be lost. In fact, since Plato seems to think that the body also\ndissipates, the particular can totally disappear. Not so the Form,\nwhich Is what it is, an auto kath auto being, precisely in\nthat its essence is predicated via Being of it, and it is the only Form\nof which that essence is predicated. \n\nA particular, x, is what it is in virtue of Partaking. What\nmakes x beautiful, for instance, is its having something which\nIs beautiful. This something can either be a Form or form-copy, for\nthese alone Are beautiful. It might seem, however, that the qualitative\naspect of property possession is being explained in terms of items that\nare not qualified or characterized in the appropriate manner. This\nwould be the result were Partaking analyzed in terms of, or reduced to,\nthe relationship of Being. But in the middle period at least, Partaking\nis itself a primitive relation alongside Being. Moreover, at this\njuncture the participating subject is assumed to be a material\nparticular, whose material nature goes without analysis. The primitive\nrelation of Partaking, along with the effects of matter, are thus\nresponsible for the characterization of the particulars: in virtue of\nhaving something, which Is beautiful, Helen is a beautiful\nwoman. The form-copy is not responsible for the concrete, determinate\ncharacter of her beauty. Her being a material object, and her\nhaving of the form-copy cause her to be so characterized. That\nher determinate character is the character of Beauty, on the\nother hand, is due to the form-copy that she has, and this form-copy,\nin turn, causes her to be beautiful in virtue of being a form-copy of\nBeauty Itself. In this respect, Plato sustains the Socratic notion that\nForms are logical causes. The Form, Beauty Itself, makes possible the\nfact that Helen is beautiful, in so far as a form-copy of Beauty is\nsomething she has. Since she has all of her properties in this fashion,\nand since we seem to be able to identify her, and any particular, only\nthrough descriptions that refer to her properties, form-copies and\ntheir respective Forms are responsible for our epistemic access to\n particulars.[21] \n\nEpistemology, for Plato, is best thought of as the account of what\nknowledge is. A reader who has some familiarity with philosophy since\nDescartes may well think that epistemology must address the question\nwhether there is any knowledge. Plato never considers the global\nskeptical challenge. He assumes that there is knowledge, or at least\nthat it is possible, and he inquires into the conditions that make it\npossible. These conditions, broadly conceived, concern, on the one\nhand, the rational capacities of humans, or more accurately souls,\nand, on the other hand, the objects of knowledge. With respect to\nobjects, Forms certainly are objects of knowledge. However, there is\nmuch dispute as to whether anything in the material world is a\nsuitable object. The physical world is an image, an imperfect world of\nchange.  Many passages in the Phaedo and, most dramatically,\nthe Republic's great metaphors of Sun, Line and Cave, imply\nthat Plato is a skeptic about knowledge of the physical, sensible\nworld.  Humans can have only beliefs about it. But many recoil at the\nprospect that Plato is such a skeptic. Citing the thrust of other\ndiscussions, these readers argue that while all knowledge for Plato\nmust be based, in some sense, on Forms, one who knows Forms can also\nacquire knowledge of the physical world (see Fine 1978; 1990). \n\nConcerns about the inherent intelligibility, or lack thereof, of the\nphysical world, prompt Plato to propose the doctrine of recollection,\ni.e., the thesis that our disembodied, immortal souls have seen the\nForms prior to their incarceration in the body. If Forms are the\n(basic) objects of knowledge, and Forms are not in the physical world,\nthen we must have acquired that knowledge at some point prior to our\ncommerce with that world. But metaphysical issues about the\nsimplicity of Forms also affect how we are to conceive of\nknowledge in these middle period works. If Forms are simple, then it\nseems that knowledge is intuitive or acquaintance-like: in a\nnon-propositional manner one somehow sees a Form, itself by itself. The\ncentral books of the Republic suggest such a picture. On the\nother hand, the many passages in which Plato declares that in order to\nknow a Form one must be able to give its definition suggest both that\nForms are related to one another, e.g., the Form of Human is related to\nthe Forms of Rationality, Bipedality, Animality, the ‘elements of\nits definition, and that knowledge is propositional or akin to\nknowledge by description (cf. Gorgias 465a, 501a2–3,\nRepublic 534b). These passages seem to imply that perhaps\nknowledge is some form of justified true belief. A critical question\nthen is how one obtains the appropriate kind of justification to tie\ndown or convert a belief into knowledge. Plato offers little in the way\nof detail on this score, but twice he alludes to a method of\nhypothesis, suggesting both in the Phaedo and\nRepublic that hypotheses and their ultimately being rendered\n‘non-hypothetical’ is part of the process by which one\ncomes to know a Form. Thus we have four broad notions to explore in\nPlato's middle period epistemology: knowledge, belief, recollection and\nthe method of hypothesis. \n\nThe Meno is probably a transitional work, bridging the\nSocratic and the middle period dialogues. While the first third of the\nMeno is concerned with ethical questions, what is virtue and\nis virtue teachable, the last two-thirds address themselves to\nepistemological details generated from the thesis that virtue is\nknowledge. Here we find for the first time mention of recollection,\nwhich Socrates proposes as a solution to a paradox of inquiry put\nforward by Meno. The paradox is this (80d-e): \n\nIf one knows F, then one cannot inquire about\nF. \n\nIf one does not know F, then one cannot inquire about\nF. \n\nTherefore, for all F, one cannot inquire about\nF. \n\nPlato resolves the paradox by showing that there are different ways\nin which one might be said to ‘know’ something and that\nsometimes having a belief about F is adequate to begin an\ninquiry into F. In his famous question and answer with a slave\nabout how to find the diagonal of a given square, Socrates argues that\nlatent within the slave is an understanding of how to determine the\ndiagonal (81–86b). The slave has various beliefs, some false and some\ntrue, about the way to discover the length of the diagonal. What is\nneeded is only a set of prompts, here a set of questions, to elicit\nfrom the boy the knowledge that is latent within him. Socrates contends\nthat he is leading the slave to recollect what he already knows. In the\nsubsequent stages of the argument, Socrates distinguishes the sense in\nwhich a person can be said to merely have a belief about something\n(into which one might inquire), from the sense in which he can be said\nto know the same thing (97ff). For instance, suppose that Jones has\nlooked at a map and determined how to drive from New York City to\nChicago though he has not done so: just get on Interstate 80 and go\nwest. On the other hand, suppose that Smith has actually driven\nnumerous times from NYC to Chicago by getting on 80 and heading west.\nBoth Jones and Smith have the same belief about how to get from NYC to\nChicago and both will get there by acting on their belief. But only\nSmith has knowledge of the road, whereas Jones has a true belief. The\ntruth of the belief is then not at issue. Rather, Smith has something\nmore, some kind of justification, here based on experience, that\ndistinguishes her from Jones: Jones has only a true belief about how to\nget there; Smith actually knows. Thus in the Meno, we have\nperhaps the first attempt to offer a justified true belief account of\nknowledge: Knowledge is a true belief tied down with an account\n(aitias logismos, 98a). The Meno, then, with its\ndiscussion of recollection, knowledge and belief sets the stage for the\nmiddle Platonic epistemology. \n\nThe Phaedo's discussion of recollection begins with a\nremark by Cebes in support of the claim that our souls preexist their\nincarceration in the body: “Such is also the case if that theory\nis true that you are accustomed to mention frequently, that for us\nlearning is no other than recollection. According to this, we must at\nsome previous time have learned what we now recollect. This is possible\nonly if our soul existed somewhere before it took on this human\nshape” (72e-73). \n\nOf special importance in this initial description is the ‘for\nus’ and the identification of learning (mathesis) with\nrecollection. There is no way to determine whether ‘we’\nhere are the close, philosophical confidants of Socrates, or the human\nrace. Part of the solution to the problem of who recollects will hinge\non how we understand the claim that learning is nothing other than\nrecollection. On the broad reading, recollection concerns the\napplication of concepts in all thought (see, most recently, Bedu-Addo\n1991).  That is, since learning is a dynamic process whose termini are\nroughly our first thoughts and talk about the world, on the one hand,\nand knowledge of Forms on the other, and since in thinking and talking\nabout the world we must apply concepts, recollection is viewed as a\ndoctrine of innate ideas whose effects are felt almost immediately in\nthe conscious mind. \n\nThose who would limit the kind of learning that is recollection\nisolate the last stage(s) of learning, namely those concerned with the\nmove from beliefs about the (properties of) the material world to\nknowledge of Forms (see, most recently, Scott 1995; Bobonich 2002,\nCh. 1).  Since only philosophers will engage in these late stages, the\n‘us’ for whom learning is recollection are only\nphilosophers, and what is learned/recollected is just Forms. On this\nnarrow reading Plato would have to offer an account of ordinary\nthought and talk, i.e., an account of concept acquisition and\napplication, which claims that the concepts so deployed by most of us\nare derived from ordinary particulars and acquired through our\nconversations with one another and our sense-perceptions and beliefs\nabout physical objects. In sum, both readings agree that Plato is\nconcerned to explain the distinctive capacity of humans to classify\nsense-perception under universals. According to the broad reading,\nPlato thinks that this cannot be done unless one appeals to one's\nprior, latent knowledge of the Forms under which one ranges\nperceptions. According to the narrow reading, there is no need to\nappeal to prior knowledge of Forms to explain the ordinary\nclassificatory activities of humans. Rather, prior knowledge of Forms\nis needed only to explain the philosophical understanding of Forms.\nInnate Forms thus need not contribute anything to the formation of\nconcepts in ordinary thought and talk. Precisely what the relation is\nbetween the concepts garnered from ordinary perception and used in\nordinary thought and talk and the innate Forms or concepts used in\nphilosophical thinking remains to be determined. \n\nConcepts are, roughly, the units or elements of thoughts. In the\nTheaetetus (189e), a dialogue written after the\nRepublic and Phaedo, Plato contends that thought is\nthe silent dialogue of the soul with itself. If we can read back from\nthis dialogue to the epistemology of the middle period, concepts are\nconceptual analogues to the subjects and predicates of spoken\nstatements: corresponding to the predicate ‘equal’ of a\nstatement such as ‘The sticks are equal’ is the concept\n[equality]. To debate whether there are ordinary versus philosophical\nconcepts of [equality] thus invites consideration of how to distinguish\nconcepts from one another. Basic in the Phaedo is that we have\nknowledge of Equality; that we perceive sensible equal objects, that we\ncompare these sensible equals with the Form, and that in order to do\nthis we must have had prior knowledge of Equality. Now, one question is\nwhether the same concept applies both to the Form and the particulars.\nWhereas we moderns often focus on synonymy to distinguish\nco-referential concepts, issues of reference dominate Plato's thoughts.\nBy the end of the Final Argument, it is clear that in a strict or\nprimary fashion the concept/term is applied to the Form and in an\nindirect manner it is applied to the many instances that fall under the\nForm. (Using the language of names, ‘equal’ is the name of\nEquality and the eponym of the many particular equal things. (Cf.\n102bff) With respect to the concept of Equality, it is individuated by\nits relation to the Form of Equality and, at best, derivatively to the\nmany\n equals.[22]\n What individuates concepts or names, is\nnot what is in the head of speakers, but rather just their relation to\nForms. \n\nThis privileging of reference over meaning with respect to what a\nconcept is lends credence to the broad or innatist interpretation of\nwhat it is to acquire or even to have a concept. One has the concept\nfrom birth. One is not aware of having it. As you mature, learn to\nspeak and make your way in the world, you may and in all likelihood\nwill associate many beliefs or things with this concept, though still\nyou might not think of it as a concept. (That is, nothing in Plato's\naccount suggests that people need be aware of having a concept qua\nconcept in order to have or even use concepts.) Conversely, lacking the\nindividuation condition for concepts provided by Forms and Innatism,\nthe narrow reading must provide an account of how one acquires any\nconcept. There is little in the primary or secondary literature to\nsuggest how concepts are acquired. Though it is a controversial\ndialogue with respect to doctrine and period, the Cratylus’\nrejection of the Protagorean/Heraclitean account of names (383–387c,\n434e-435d), strongly suggests that Plato thinks that no empiricist or\nabstractionist account is workable. One problem, then, with the narrow\ninterpretation is its picture of (ordinary) concepts and their\ncontents. Concepts are treated as hollow shells to be filled with\nvarying beliefs or ideas, contents gleaned from conversations with one\nanother or contact with the world. Into my concept of beauty goes pale\nskinned, into yours bright color, into a third, some other filling. The\nproblem is that if the concept itself is identified with its\ncontents, then there is no reason to think that any of us have the same\nconcept. There are just too many different beliefs associated with a\nconcept by different individuals to think that anyone could ever mean\nthe same as another. Empiricism with respect to concept acquisition is\nliable to lead to private languages at best. Moreover, it would seem\nthat our concept changes anytime we add or subtract from its\ncontents. \n\nOf course, the fact that there are philosophical objections to the\nnarrow reading should not dictate that we reject it. The broad reading\nmay also have problems. Indeed, Plato's account of Recollection,\nwhatever it is, is liable to suffer difficulties. So what is the\naccount? \n\nAt the outset (73c-74a), Socrates places certain conditions on what\nis to count as recollection. If x reminds one of y,\nthen \n\nIt is not clear how these conditions can be satisfied. In order to\nrecollect Simmias upon seeing his picture, (1) I must have known\nSimmias beforehand and (2) I must be somehow cognizant of the picture\nand of Simmias. (3) And were Simmias and his picture not the\nobjects of different knowledge, that is, were they the object of the\nsame knowledge, it seems that I would not realize that they are\ndifferent objects. The picture would not remind me of Simmias, it would\njust be thought of as a picture (or as Simmias). But, recognizing the\npicture cannot involve recognizing Simmias, lest we already be\nthinking of Simmias (y) in thinking about the picture\n(x): that is, we cannot be reminded of what we are\noccurrently thinking about. There must then be a way of\ncognizing the picture apart from what it is a picture of. Condition 3\nis more transparent when we consider recollection from\nunlikes: we can recognize a lyre as a lyre or as a musical\ninstrument, a piece of wood with strings, etc., easily enough without\nintroducing Simmias in order to think about it. Condition 4 then spells\nout the peculiar way in which recollection from likes occurs;\ne.g., we realize that a picture or image is different from what it is a\npicture of: images fall short or are lacking in some respect with\nregard to what they are an image of. We recognize this perhaps because\nwe recognize that it is an image and that images always are deficient\nwith respect to what they are images of. But we need not be thinking of\nthe very thing the image is an image of in order to recognize these\nfacts. \n\nThe argument to this point is a preliminary sketch of recollection.\nThe next stage attempts to prove that one can and must recollect Forms,\nsince only with that proof will Socrates have demonstrated the\npre-existence of the soul. So Plato turns to showing that we cannot\nhave acquired knowledge of the Form Equality from perceptual\nencounters. But 2, 3 and 4, when applied to the example of the equal\nsticks, appear to land the doctrine in difficulties. For it seems that\nif, according to 4, we need to be comparing the equal sticks to the\nForm of Equality, then we need to be aware of the Form in thinking of\nthe sticks. But if we must be aware of the Form even to think about the\nequal sticks then we must already have the Form in mind in\nconducting the comparison. We cannot then be in the process of forming\nthe concept of Equality nor recollecting the Form. \n\nThe next stage finds Socrates getting Simmias' rapid agreement that\nthere is an Equal that they know besides the equal sticks and stones.\n(74ab). The question is whence they acquired this knowledge. It cannot\nhave been from the sticks and stones from which it differs; for they\ncan sometimes appear equal and sometimes unequal, whereas Equality\nItself, on the other hand, never appears unequal. Socrates concludes\nthat we cannot have derived our knowledge of Equality from these many\nequals because we realize that they are deficient or lacking with\nrespect to Equality. He does not specify in what way they are lacking,\nsave for the aforementioned fact that they can and do appear unequal\nwhereas Equality does not and apparently cannot do so. \n\nPlato provides little guidance in this argument or elsewhere as to why\nthe Form cannot appear to be unequal (See White 1987; 1992).  Perhaps\nthe easiest way to parse the Form's insusceptibility to appearing\nunequal is to treat the claim as implying that the Form cannot appear\nother than itself, i.e., equal. This fact, in turn, would then be\nexplained by citing the Form's incomposite, or simple, nature (See\n§4, supra). Equality could then have no other property\n(or be no other property). Thus, to be aware of it at all would be to\nrecognize it as equal. Of course there remains the problem of\ndistinguishing being aware of the Form from thinking one is aware of\nthe Form when one is not. In this circumstance, one could perhaps\nmistakenly think all sorts of things about the Form. A related but\ndistinct consideration is to determine whether it is possible in some\nsense to have the Form in mind without being aware of it. Certainly\nthe broad or innatist reading must allow for this possibility, since\nForms are regarded as latent in one's mind. \n\nIf Forms are not utterly simple, then this explanation of their\nimmunity to appearing other than they are is weakened. Suppose that\nEquality is also beautiful. Then in some fashion, it would seem that by\nattending to its beauty Equality could seem other than Equality and\nthus seem unequal. In order to avoid this outcome, while allowing for\nsome complexity in the Form, those emphasizing the compresence of\nopposites can insist that it is the strict opposite, Inequality or\nbeing unequal, that Plato excludes from the Form, not another property,\ne.g., beauty, which happens not to be identical with Equality. \n\nAlternatively, the predicationalist (See §4 supra.), who\nemphasizes the special relation between a Form and its essence,\nmaintains that in knowing Equality, one knows what it is, that is, one\nknows its essence. This essence is itself simple or a unity, despite\nthe apparent complexity of the linguistic definition that picks it out.\nOne is not aware, or at least one is not knowingly aware, of Equality\nunless one knows this definition. Whatever else may be predicable of\nEquality, one cannot be aware of Equality without realizing that it is\nwhatever it is, namely this essence. Regardless of how we understand\nthe difference between the Form and the sticks, Plato seems only to\nhave shown that the Form and the particulars are not identical. How we\nare to conclude that one cannot derive the knowledge of the Form from\nthe sensibles is not revealed. \n\nThe Republic is unquestionably Plato's most elaborate\ndefense of his central ethical doctrines in the middle period. It\nexplores the question what is Justice over the course of ten books,\nwith the aim of demonstrating that the best life for a human is the\nlife devoted to virtue and knowledge, for such a life will result in\nhappiness for the individual. The virtuous person will be one who has\nall three parts of her soul working in a harmonious fashion, i.e., her\nreason, cognizant of the Form of the Good and the other Forms, will\nwith the support and consent of her appetite and spirit govern all of\nher pursuits. The analogue of the virtuous individual with her\ntripartite soul is the ideal state, the Republic, with its three parts\nor classes, rulers, warriors and laborers, all working in harmony with\none another under the auspices of the ruler, i.e., reason. Having\nestablished that justice is psychic harmony at the end of Book Four,\nPlato next turns to show what it is that the philosopher ruler (or\nreason in the individual) knows that licenses his claim that they will\nrule for the benefit of the respective parts and the whole state or\nperson \n\nAt the end of Book V (474bff), Socrates begins his defense of the\nrule of the philosopher by contrasting his epistemological condition\nwith that of a group of sightlovers. The philosopher, who accepts that\nthere are Forms, e.g., Beauty Itself, has knowledge. The sightlover,\nwho denies that there is Beauty Itself but rather insists that there\nare just the many (different) beautiful plays, paintings and such,\nlacks knowledge. He has only belief. In support of this contention,\nSocrates distinguishes three different kinds of mental states or\ncapacities and three generic ‘objects’ for these\ncapacities. Knowledge is set over ‘what completely is’;\nignorance is set over ‘what completely is not’; and,\nbelief, being intermediate between knowledge and ignorance, is set over\nwhat is intermediate between the other two generic objects, namely\n‘what is and is not’. Capacities are distinguished,\nSocrates contends, by two criteria: 1) difference in objects; and 2)\ndifference in what they do (with/to their objects). Examples of 1)\ninclude colors and sounds, and of course what completely is and what is\nand is not. The second criterion is seemingly satisfied by the\ndifference between being true versus being true and false. Thus,\nknowledge is always true, whereas belief admits of both truth and\nfalsehood. \n\nMuch turns on how one understands the ‘is’ (es)\nof ‘what completely is’ and ‘what is and\nis-not’, and, concomitantly, whether one treats what belief and\nknowledge are ‘set over’ as propositions or objects. Three\ndifferent readings of the ‘is’ seem possible: a) the\nexistential; b) the veridical; and c) the predicative. \n\nOn the existential reading, knowledge is set over what exists; belief\nis set over what exists and does not exist. On the predicative\nreading, knowledge is set over Forms, what is F, for any\nproperty F (or some privileged kinds of properties, e.g.\nincomplete properties); belief is set over what is F and\nnot-F, the material particulars. The existential and\npredicative readings typically are committed to objects as what\nknowledge and belief are set over. Since it is hard to make sense of\nwhat it could be for an object to exist and not exist, the existential\nreading has found little support. (There are other objections to an\nexistential reading, principally that many think that Plato never\nworks with an ‘is’ of existence (see Owen 1986c). \n\nThe predicative reading, on the other hand, lends itself to a\ndefense of the Two Worlds account of Plato's metaphysics. The objects\nof belief and knowledge are distinct. Accordingly, one can have only\nbeliefs about the particulars and about particulars only beliefs, and\nonly knowledge of Forms and of Forms one can only have knowledge. It\nfollows that knowledge cannot be any kind of justified true belief, not\neven one ‘tied down’ by the account of the appropriate\ncause. (See Meno 98a). Moreover, since one can have only\nknowledge of Forms, one cannot have any false beliefs about Forms.\nGiven that in Book I of the Republic the interlocutors seem to\nhave many false beliefs about Justice, e.g., that Justice is returning\nwhat is due, this consequence may be more worrisome than that which\nproscribes knowledge of the affairs of actual cities. \n\nAccording to the veridical reading (see Fine 1978; 1990), the\n‘objects’ of belief and knowledge are best treated as\npropositions. Knowledge is set over what is true, i.e., the set of\ntrue propositions; belief is set over what is true and not true, or\nfalse, namely the set of all propositions. The veridical reading\nregards the overlap between the objects of the distinct\nfaculties—the set of true propositions—as a virtue, since\nit allows one to give a justified true belief interpretation to\nknowledge and allows one to have both beliefs about and knowledge of\nForms and of sensible objects. \n\nThe argument at the end of Book Five is a prelude to the argument and\nanalogies of Sun, Line and Cave in Books Six and Seven. The point of\nSun is to contrast the visible and intelligible realms. The former is\ngenerated, nurtured and governed by the sun, which also provides the\nlight required by the eye to gain access to the physical world.\nCorresponding to the sun in the intelligible realm is the Good:\n“What gives truth to the things known and the power to know to\nthe knower is the Form of the Good. And though it is the cause of\nknowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge.” (508e).\nIndeed, the Good is responsible for the very ‘being’ of\nthe knowable objects, though Plato never says in what sense the Good\nis responsible for the knowability and being of the objects of\nknowledge (see Santas 1980). \n\nLine starts from the broad division stipulated by Sun: there is the\nintelligible realm and the visible realm. Each of these is again\ndivided into two (unequal) parts. At the bottom of the visible one\nfinds images, shadows and such. The ordinary physical objects of which\nthe images are images occupy the upper portion. Set over the images is\nthe faculty of eikasia, imagination. Set over the physical\nworld is the faculty of pistis, literally faith or conviction,\nbut generally regarded as belief. Plato next turns to the lower segment\nof the intelligible portion of Line: \n\nThe top-most segment of Line is clear enough. The objects are Forms\nand the faculty set over Forms is Nous, Knowledge or Understanding.\nIncluded in this group is the Good itself, best regarded as having the\nstatus of first among equals. Precisely what to make of the objects in\nthe third section, the faculty of dianoia, and the nature of\nhypotheses are matters of great controversy. Given Plato's examples,\nthe capacity of dianoia seems distinctive of scientific or\nmathematical reasoning. (On the question of hypotheses and the\nrelation of this passage to the hypothetical method of\nthe Phaedo, see §15 supra.) The objects\nof dianoia are then, roughly, the objects of the\nsciences. There appear to be two basic approaches to the\n‘objects’ of dianoia, depending on how one\nunderstands the participial phrase “using as images the things\nthat were imitated before”: 1) The objects of this segment are\nsome kind of ‘abstract’ image of ordinary material things\n- a kind of image different from the kind that are shadows and\nreflections; or 2) the objects are either the material objects\nthemselves though now treated (abverbially, as it were) in a special,\ndifferent way, or they are Forms, though treated in a way different\nfrom that way in which noûs treats Forms (see Burnyeat\n1987). \n\nCave, arguably the most famous analogy in the history of philosophy,\nreinforces the message of line. Seated prisoners, chained so that they\ncannot move their heads, stare at a cave wall on which are projected\nimages. These images are cast from carved figures illuminated by a fire\nand carried by people on a parapet above and behind the prisoners. A\nprisoner is loosed from his chains. First he sees the carved images and\nthe fire. Then he is led out of the cave into ‘the real’ world.\nBlinded by the light of the sun, he cannot look at the trees, rocks and\nanimals around him, but instead looks at the shadows and reflections\n(in water) cast by those objects. As he becomes acclimatized, he turns\nhis gaze to those objects and finally, fully acclimatized, he looks to\nthe source of illumination, the sun itself. \n\nIn the analogy of Cave, corresponding to the physical objects over\nwhich belief is set are the carved statues in the cave. Corresponding\nto the ‘using as images what before were imitated’ are the\nreflections in the pond. If, however, Cave is our guide, these\ndematerialized images are generated not from the carved statues but\nfrom the animals, i.e., the Forms themselves. \n\nThe Seventh Book continues with the kinds of study conducive to the\neducation of the philosopher-ruler (521cff). The goal of intellectual\ndevelopment is knowledge of Forms, ultimately acquired through\ndialectic. Dialectic, however, is practiced late in life by a select\nfew with the requisite memory and quickness of mind, after they have\nstudied various, essentially mathematical disciplines. The winnowing\nprocess eliminates most people from ever developing the necessities for\nphilosophical thought. The first steps (523a-525a) in the turn towards\nabstract thinking are occasioned by the need for the mind to settle\nquestions arising from ordinary perception; that is, the mind of\neveryman is liable to be summoned to reflect upon the confused, and\nconfusing, reports of perception. About a host of perceptual qualities,\nthick, thin, hard, soft, large and small, the senses report that they\nare the same, at least in certain perceptual circumstances. Lumped in\nwith these properties is also number. The mind is summoned to settle\nwhat is large and what is small, and what is one. \n\nThe brief discussion of the summoners raises suspicions about the\nfaculty psychology presented in the final argument of Book V and in\nLine and Cave. It seems at times that Plato thinks that belonging to\neach part of the soul are capacities or faculties capable of issuing\njudgments (cf. 602c-603a; see Burnyeat 1976).  So, for instance, there\nare the judgments of sense that can and often do conflict with the\njudgments of reason.  But taken literally, if each faculty has its own\nobjects such that no other faculty can be set over them, then there\ncan be no conflict in judgments. The case of perception poses a\nspecial difficulty.  Perception, unlike discursive thought or belief,\nis aligned not with the so-called rational part of the soul, but with\nthe desiderative part. As we saw in the Phaedo, as well as in\nthe passages about the sightlovers and the summoners, the senses are\ndisparaged as a source of confusion and falsehood. The senses mislead\nus. One of Plato's complaints seems to be that people rely on\nperception, or belief relying on perception, with the result that they\ncome to think that what is real is the physical, sensible world. And,\nperhaps even worse, they come to think that one can understand (know)\nthings about the world such as what makes (for example) a temple\nbeautiful or a stick equal or a person large by appealing to\nproperties that are perceptual or observational or sensible. \n\nProponents of the thesis that Plato posits Forms only for incomplete\nproperties locate the problem for the sensible world not in the\nobjects themselves, but in the kinds of explanations that sightlovers\nand non-philosophers rely on to justify their claim to know\n(propositions about) the sensible, material world (see Fine 1978;\n1990; Irwin 1977; Gosling 1960).  It need not be the case, as the\npredicative reading in terms of objects would have it, that a given\ntemple is and is not- beautiful. In their view, the problem is the\nsensible property types cited by the sight-lovers in their accounts of\nwhat makes something beautiful. For example, there is the sensible\nproperty type, bright-color, that allegedly explains why the temple at\nBassae is beautiful. But, bright-color itself, the property type, is\nand is not-beautiful, for it accounts for beauty in some things but\naccounts for ugliness (not-beauty) in others. The crucial text for\nthis reading is 479d3–5: “So we have discovered, apparently,\nthat most people's varying standards (nomima) of beauty and\nthings like that are rattling around somewhere in the middle, between\nwhat is not something and what purely and simply is something”\n(Ferrari/Griffith trans.) The veridical reading\ntranslates nomima as ‘beliefs’ and contends that\nbecause most people rely on sensible property types as the\njustification for their beliefs, they are condemned to live in the\nrealm of belief. For, according to this reading, every sensible\nproperty type suffers from this compresence of opposites, i.e.,\nis F and not-F. In appealing to such properties in\ntheir accounts, the sight lover can never be justified in any of his\nbeliefs about the many beautifuls, because their accounts or reasons\nfor their beliefs about the world must be false. Hence, the sightlover\ncan have only beliefs about the many beautifuls, or equals, or, for any\nincomplete property F, the many fs. The sight-lover\ncan never achieve knowledge so long as he relies on sensible\nproperties in his accounts. And since Plato thinks that there is\nknowledge, he infers, says the veridical reading, that there must be\nnon-sensible objects, or rather there must be accounts or explanations\navailable which can be phrased in terms of ‘non-sensible’\nproperties, i.e., must appeal to properties which are not\nboth F and not-F, or more precisely, do not make\nsome things, say beautiful, and others ugly. \n\nThe veridical reading, combined with the account that limits Forms\nto incomplete properties (See §6, supra), allows for the\npossibility that the philosopher can have knowledge of the visible\nrealm. This can come about for at least two reasons. On the one hand,\nthere will be a host of non-sensible properties and propositions about\nordinary particulars and such properties, e.g., ‘Socrates is a\nman’. Since arguably Plato thinks that Socrates is completely or\nessentially a man, and since there is no Form of Man, the philosopher\n(and, perhaps, anyone) can know such a proposition. On the other hand,\nthe philosopher, once he comes to know the Forms of the Incomplete\nProperties, can then have knowledge of the external world in any and\nall respects. Not misled by the compresent opposite properties, and\nable to base all his accounts on the Good and the other Forms, nothing\nstands in his way of knowing the material world\n (520c).[23] \n\nThe predicative reading of the argument of Book V and the analogies\nof the central books does not limit the range of Forms and does not\ncommit itself to the possibility of knowledge of the external world. If\none treats the physical world as metaphysically defective, as\nvictimized in any and every respect by its being and not-being, then\nthat suffices to preclude one from knowing anything about such a world.\nThe objects of the physical world are simply not the right sorts of\nthings to qualify as objects of knowledge, regardless of what sorts of\nreasons or justifications or explanations one has at her disposal. \n\nRegardless of the epistemic status of the physical world, one task\nis to understand how Plato thinks the transition is made from one's\nperceptions and beliefs about the physical world to knowledge of the\nForms. In the Republic, Socrates says that every human being\nis capable of becoming a philosopher and thus able to know the Good and\nall the Forms (518c). On the other hand, the Republic leaves\nlittle doubt that Plato expects that few will actually achieve the\nknowledge each is capable of. Most of us will give in to the ordinary\nbeliefs generated through our perceptual encounters with the sensible\nworld, as well as those resulting from the conversations we have with\none another. Most will never even begin, it seems, the course of study\noutlined in Book VII, and most of those who begin will not become\ndialectically sophisticated so that they can give an account of what\nthey know that will ‘destroy the hypotheses'. But despite\nthe odds, from the Phaedo and Republic we can locate\ntwo elements of Plato's epistemological program that can lead to\nknowledge if properly exercised, recollection and the method of\nhypothesis. The latter is mentioned explicitly in the Phaedo\nand seems again to be alluded to in Plato's remarks about the\ndifferences between the top two sections of line. Since this method,\nassuming that it is the same in both, appears to be deployed as part of\nthe final stages of the pursuit of knowledge, there is reason to\npostpone consideration of the method until after consideration of\nperception and belief, i.e., the first two stages of Line. \n\nThe Phaedo's discussion of Recollection suggests that there\nis something inherently flawed with empiricist or abstractionist\naccounts, at least those that attempt to derive any concept from our\ncontacts, perceptual or linguistic, with the external world. It seems\nthat Plato thinks that the deficiency of the external, sensible,\nmaterial world vitiates all efforts to build or acquire concepts from\nit. The deficiency of the sensible material world makes it an\nunreliable source of information. Depending on how one accounts for\nthis deficiency, the trouble for perception, and belief based on\nperception, is explained in different ways. Aristotle's account\nemphasizes that it is changing. Another source of difficulty is that\nthe abstract, general Forms are always manifested in a concrete,\ndeterminate fashion (See §7, supra). The Affinity Argument\npoints to the complexity of material particulars. Rather than present a\nsingle property, as it were, to perception, perception is required to\nfocus on some aspect of the complex particular. If it is also true that\nat least with respect to some properties, namely the incomplete or\nrelative properties addressed by the Compresence accounts, every object\nis both F and not-F, then no sensible will be an\nunqualified bearer of these properties. Perception, considered in its\nown right, seems to be unable to explain how any feature of an object\nis selected for study. It also seems that Plato thinks that the\npsychological faculties of perception, or even belief, are incapable of\nprocessing the information in a reliable manner, or at least in a\nmanner requisite for knowledge. At times it seems that they distort or\nalter perceptions (Phaedo, 65ff). At other times, e.g., when\nwe emphasize the difference between the faculties, it seems that they\nare confined to work on whatever they process in such a manner that\nthey do not pass along anything to the rational faculty, or if they do,\nthey pass it along to belief. One problem is that whenever one engages\nin perception, and belief based on perceptual reports, one can never\novercome the inherently perspectival situation. For instance, no matter\nwhere one is situated, the round penny will appear to the eye, we might\nsay, somewhat elliptical. Or, to use Plato's example from Book Ten, the\nstraight stick in water will seem bent (owing to the laws of\nrefraction), even though an experienced person will believe that it is\nstraight\n (602c-603a).[24] \n\nHowever we account for the inadequacy of perception the task remains\nto explore how we get from perception, which stimulates the\nrecollective process, to belief and eventually to recollect or\notherwise know Forms. Plato is less than forthcoming about how one\nmoves from one stage to the next. The elenctic method probably plays\nsome role in advancing one's understanding, especially the step from\nperception to belief. At a certain point, we naturally begin to offer\nreasons for our beliefs. The elenchus questions our reasons, typically\nby revealing an inconsistency in our accounts of why we believe what we\ndo. But we can also place Plato in a tradition that seeks a systematic\nexplanation of the natural phenomena. One aim of the Presocratics, as\nSocrates narrates in the Phaedo (95a4ff), is to find a single\nexplanation, or a single kind of explanation, to save the phenomena.\nSocrates complains that the Presocratics had mistakenly looked to\nmaterial causes. Such explanations fail to meet minimal standards: the\nsame explanation (aitia) accounts for opposite phenomena,\ne.g., ‘by a head’ explains both why something is tall and\nsomething else is short; or sometimes the same phenomenon is subject to\nexplanations by opposite causes, being two by ‘division and\naddition.’ However, Socrates reports, Anaxagoras' nod towards\nMind was at least a step in the right direction (though Anaxagoras\nfailed to follow the path). The best account is teleological in nature,\nin terms of the Good. Thus the Phaedo gestures at the critical\nrole assigned to this Form in the Republic. In the\nPhaedo Plato begs off from directly investigating the nature\nof the good or teleological explanations. Instead he turns to what he\ndescribes as a method of hypothesis, the first of which is the\nhypothesis of Forms as causes (see $sect;2 supra), and its\n‘first corollary’, that particulars are/come-to-be what\neach is in virtue of partaking in Forms. \n\nPrecisely what the connection is between the Phaedo's method\nof hypothesis (99eff) and the Republic's remarks on\nhypothesis and the ascent to an unhypothetical first principal is a\nsubject of controversy. Equally controversial is its connection within\nthe Phaedo to the method of recollection and to philosophical\npractice in general. In attempting to study what there is\n(onta), Socrates says that he shrinks from things\n(erga) to concentrate on propositions/accounts\n(logoi), which he denies are more images (of what there is)\nthan the physical things: “I started in this manner: taking as\nmy hypothesis in each case the theory that seemed to me most\ncompelling, I would consider as true, about cause and everything else,\nwhatever agreed with this, and as untrue whatever did not\nagree.” (99e-100a). Since the hypothesis of Forms is offered\nnext, with its corollary of participating particulars, it would seem\nthat the logoi are opinions about Forms. These logoi\nare to be treated as provisional. Socrates' is the\nstrongest logos and the safest, in explicit contrast to the\nwise explanations of others.  From the examples provided, it seems\nthat ‘agreement’ here is not a notion of entailment or\nlogical consequence. Rather, Plato directs us to posit initially a\ngeneral hypothesis and to determine whether there are particular cases\nwithin the target domain—here the cause of generation and\ndestruction—that are inconsistent with, i.e., not adequately\nexplained by, it (see Bedu-Addo 1991). \n\nComplicating matters is Plato's additional remark that one needs\nalso to examine the initial hypothesis to see whether there are\n‘higher’ hypotheses that account for it: \n\nSince the initial hypothesis is the theory of Forms, it is uncertain\nwhat Plato has in mind in mentioning hypotheses ‘higher’\nthan the theory or what sort of test he has in mind. The elenctic\npractice of Socrates would determine whether other accounts are\nconsistent with one another. But that still leaves the question of\nhigher hypotheses unanswered. One temptation here is to think that the\nteleological account of the Good is the higher/est hypothesis. While\nthis may well be so, there are perhaps intermediate accounts between\nthe full-blown teleology of the Good—an account that Plato\nsteadfastly throughout his writings refuses to provide—and the\ninitial statement of the theory of Forms and its corollary of\nparticipation (see Rowe 1993).  These intermediate stages might then\nbe viewed as different accounts of the nature of Forms, the nature of\nparticulars and of the participation relation itself. For instance,\nAristotle might offer a different account of ‘Forms’ than\nPlato, one that espouses an immanent realism wherein some particulars\nmight be said to have essential properties. Or, looking to the clever\nexplanations that follow, where perhaps Forms of Fire and Heat, Cold\nand Snow or Three and Odd are linked, one might ponder whether Forms\nare indeed utterly simple or monoeidetic, in contrast to an account of\nForms in which they may bear a special relation to their\nessence—Three is what it is to be three—and a different\nrelation to another property, e.g. oddness. Seen in this light, the\nTheory of Forms in the Phaedo (and Republic) is\nhypothetical or provisional, awaiting a defense in which the nature of\nForms, the role of the Good and the relations between Forms are\nexamined. \n\nWhen one turns from the Phaedo to the Republic,\nthe notion of hypothesis appears in the two ‘upper’\nsegments of the line. They are distinguished in part by the fact that\nthose considering their subject matter dianoetically still make use of\nhypotheses, whereas those using nous have arrived at an\nunhypothetical first principle and descending the line have destroyed\nthe hypotheses. It seems that the mathematicians, for example, use\ndiscursive thought because they assume the starting points, i.e., the\naxioms or definitions, of their sciences. In this respect, they are\nlike Socrates of the Phaedo positing the Forms to explain\ngeneration and corruption. In Plato's hands, scientific inquiry seems\nto emerge from reflection on the everyday material world. The step from\nconviction to dianoia, however, is taken by far fewer\nindividuals than those who step from eikasia to\nconviction. \n\nThe move from the second to the third level crosses the barrier\nbetween the visible and the intelligible. One derives ‘images'\nfrom the objects of pistis or considers them differently,\ndeveloping different propositions about what one previously took for\ngranted. Perhaps the scientist describes these images in non-sensible\nterms, or perhaps he regards the ‘image of triangle’ apart\nfrom the particular, determinate angles or lengths that even any image\nmust have—he abstracts away these features, treating the abstract\nimage as applying to all triangles. Or, similarly, the objects of\ndianoia and nous may be identical: the philosopher\nthinks about them differently from the scientist. If one assumes that\nhere Forms are first posited, as seems required if we are to understand\nthe descent from nous to secure the Forms, then the objects of\ndianoia and pistis cannot be the same. For the\nlatter are not Forms but ordinary particulars. We can then explain\n‘destroying the hypotheses’ as similar to what, in the\nPhaedo, was described as finding the higher logoi.\nThe initial strongest hypothesis, i.e., the Theory of Forms, is then\nrendered non-hypothetical when, and only when, the philosopher has\ndetermined which of the many accounts of the general nature of\nForms, e.g., immanent vs. transcendent realism, simple versus complex\nForms, the nature of the Good and its relation to others forms, is\nbest. The same route would secure the hypotheses of the sciences, i.e.,\nthe various interpretations of the objects of the sciences would be\neliminated leaving only that one justified by the theory of Forms. The\npeculiar properties or axioms of the individual sciences would remain\nthe provenance of the scientists. Dialectic or understanding would\nconcern how we are to think about the nature of those properties and\nthe structure of the sciences. \n\nThe images of the central books do not settle the question of\nwhether or not the objects of the different faculties are the same. In\nappealing to a contents analysis, fundamentally an analysis that takes\npropositions to be the contents or ‘objects’ of belief and\nknowledge, as opposed to the objects themselves, i.e., material\nparticulars or Forms, one allows that there is a path from belief to\nknowledge. The same proposition can be believed or known, depending on\none's reasons or justification for holding the belief. But a contents\nanalysis is not committed to a justified true belief account of\nall knowledge. It is left open that knowledge of Forms is\nsomehow basic. Descending the line furnishes justification for the\nclaims of the dianoetic sciences and beliefs about the material world,\nincluding the states of affairs in actual cities. What to do about the\nbasic knowledge of Forms is a key issue. Sun, Line and Cave suggest to\nmany readers that knowledge of Forms is intuitive or acquaintance-like.\nOn the other hand, the refrain that one who knows can give an account\n(logos) of what he knows suggests knowledge by description or\na propositional analysis. To emphasize relations between Forms,\nstarting from the relation of the Good to all Forms, lends credence to\nthe view that Plato is an epistemological holist. Holism is fueled by\nthe search for definitions, since in order to know what, for instance,\nHuman is, one must know all the elements of its definition, Animal,\nRationality, Bipedality, and thus the definition of these elements, and\nso on. In order to know a given Form, one must know all the Forms, an\nextreme version of holism, or at least one must know all the Forms in a\ngiven science. The results of this analysis, the genera and species of\na given science, are then hypostasized as Forms, nodes in a web or the\nelements of a field. There is a virtuous circle of justification. \n\nHolist readings can also be combined with the narrow reading of\nrecollection. The same (token) proposition may well be entertained by\nthe philosopher as by those who still rely on concepts gleaned from\ntheir everyday encounters. Whether or not one knows or believes that\n‘The triangle has three sides’ depends on what one is doing\nwith that content or how one is justifying one's belief. The problem is\nthat if somehow knowing that the triangle has three sides makes\n‘triangle’ in the statement refer to the Form, while\nbelieving that (same?) proposition makes it refer to something else,\nthen the content of the two states is different, and the content of the\nstates is different because, it seems, the objects of the two states\nare different. Or one can try to save one's holism by allowing that the\ndifferent states of mind cause (the contents of) the propositions to be\ndifferent. Those who see recollection as an act engaged in only by\nphilosophers maintain that their concept differs from the empirically\ngrounded concept of the non-recollector, the occupant apparently of at\nleast two of the other three stages of Line. But how one gets from the\none concept to the other is unspecified. The concepts are linked by the\n‘external fact’ that the temple, for instance, participates\nin Beauty. The holist program seems to entail that one can continue to\nadd to beliefs about Beauty, where one is deploying the empirical\nconcept, until one in a proper justificatory exercise acquires\nall the appropriately related beliefs about properties. Once\nthat is accomplished, the philosophical concept is recollected. It\nremains open on this account, when one has recollected the Form and\nthen descends, whether the contents of the philosopher's beliefs about\nthe empirical world use the philosophical or empirical concept. \n\nThose who read Plato as subscribing to different objects for\nKnowledge and Belief also need a story about how one gets from one\nstage to the next. If we assume that Forms are at work throughout the\nlearning process, then Plato is best viewed as not identifying the Form\nwith the propositional contents of his states. The same expression\nwill, depending on the state of the agent, have different referents:\nthe images; the material objects; some immaterial, abstract\nintermediary, or a mathematical in the case of dianoia. On the\nobjects account, Plato has little to say about the status of the\nconcepts deployed in thought. The Form of Equality is not the concept.\nThe concept is present throughout the developmental life of the human.\nBecause (knowledge of) the Form is latent in the mind, sensation and\neveryday talk are capable of ‘triggering’ the concept. A\nselect individual will come to disdain the senses and the material\nobjects of the sensible world and try to explain what accounts for the\nsimilarities present in his experience. The first fundamental moment of\ntransition seems to be a shift from the many particulars to some\nabstract general notion, an inchoate ‘one-over-many’. That\nshe is able to isolate these ‘ones' at all is, according to the\nbroad reading of recollection, due to the unconscious operation or\ninfluence of the Form that allows her to sort the perceptions into\nkinds. The ontological status of these kinds is not, as yet, clear to\nher. With the further development of her dialectical capacity, the\nphilosopher-to-be comes to think that there are Forms; that is, comes\nto think that there are special entities variously related to\nparticulars and property-instances. The objects of these beliefs are\nstill not the Forms themselves, if the state of mind of the scientist\nor Phaedan hypothesizer is not yet knowledge. At this stage, or even\nearlier, one might even be in possession of the definition of the Form\nand still not have knowledge. Exactly why one lacks knowledge is hard\nto say. It is not, it seems, because he lacks beliefs about the\nrelation the Forms bear to other mathematical notions. On the one hand,\nit is doubtful that Plato believes that one can know all of mathematics\nor that one can know what a triangle is only if one knows every other\nshape. On the other hand, the mathematician does seem to know as much\nas would be needed to qualify as having knowledge of the mathematical\nForms. The philosopher is not said to know more mathematics than the\nmathematician. He secures his knowledge in way the mathematician can't\nor doesn't. \n\nIf ‘more truths’ are added to the truths in the\npossession of the mathematician, these can only be truths about the\nnature of Forms. These higher logoi will then be general\nmetaphysical principles about the role of the Good, the simplicity or\ncomplexity of Forms, the specification of the participation relation\nand so on (not a trivial ‘and so on’. ) Plato does then\nplace fantastically high demands on knowledge. The desire to ensure\nirrefutability, perhaps the legacy of reflection on the Socratic\nelenchus, drives him to the conclusion that one really has recollected\nthe Form only when one has become a metaphysician. She need (only!)\nknow the general metaphysical theory. \n\nThere is little reason to think that Plato espouses a holism of\nknowledge of the sort discussed above. Plato never says that the\nmathematician or the philosopher needs to know all the truths\nof mathematics or ethics to know some Form. Moreover, while Plato does\nprescribe a course of study in the Republic designed to\npromote one's dialectical abilities, and while it is agreed by both\nholists and intuitionists, those who allow for atomic or\nacquaintance-like knowledge of a Form, that the same Forms are the\nbasic objects of knowledge, it does not follow that Plato thinks that\nthere is only one way to secure knowledge of the Forms. If there are\ndifferent paths to knowledge, or different ways to know a given Form,\nthen Plato's epistemology is liable to appear to be both holistic and\nacquaintance-like. As for when and where Recollection is operative, or\nwhether Plato allows that a philosopher (or scientist) can know\nanything about the physical world, it is left to each reader of the\ndialogues to judge whether Plato is committed to gulfs between both\nthe ordinary concepts of most humans and the special concepts of the\nfew philosophers, as well as between the perfect Forms and the\nseemingly imperfect physical world. Since a Platonic dialogue is a\ndialectical conversation designed to summon the mind of the reader\ntowards philosophizing, it is appropriate that each reader struggle to\ndiscover for himself What Knowledge Is.","contact.mail":"silverman.3@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
