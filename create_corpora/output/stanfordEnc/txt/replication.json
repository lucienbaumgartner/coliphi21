It is tied to the concept of the gene and\nits generalization in an evolutionary context [see the entry\n evolution].\n Richard Dawkins introduced the notion of replicators—things\nthat self-replicate—as a universalization of evolutionary\nunderstandings of genes. Dawkins argued that replicators are the\nsine qua non of evolution by natural selection [see the entry\n natural selection],\n while other accounts only require reproduction as one of its\ndefining features. What exactly is a replicator? How are replicators\ndifferent from genes? Can evolution by natural selection occur without\nthe existence of replicators? Besides the biological domain, are there\nany other domains in which replicators have been postulated? To answer\nthese questions, we will first provide some background for\nDawkins’ notion of replicator and its ties with the concepts of\nthe gene and information. We will then introduce the distinction\nbetween Replicators and Vehicles in the context of\nbiological evolution and followed by the extension of this to other\ndomains. Finally, we will discuss some of the challenges to the idea\nthat replicators are necessary conditions for evolution by natural\nselection.\n\nThe notion of replication arose as a concern in the period immediately\nafter the second world war (see\n Figure 1),\n with the rise of information theory, communication theory,\ncybernetics, and Erwin Schrödinger’s 1944 book What is\nLife?. Biologists immediately began to consider the informational\naspect of life, in each of these theoretical frameworks, in areas\nranging from neurology to molecular biology, but especially the latter\n(Brookes 1956; Eigen & de Maeyer 1966; Gatlin 1972; Johnson 1970;\nLinschitz 1953; Margalef 1957 [1958]; Quastler 1953; Rashevsky 1955).\nIt was only after the development of communications theory by Shannon\n(1948) and cybernetics by Wiener (1948) after it, that inheritance in\nbiology took on a specifically informational tint (Griffiths &\nStotz 2007). This is the case in particular of the work of Watson and\nCrick on the double helix structure of DNA (Watson & Crick 1953),\nas well as Crick’s Central Dogma, which states that information\ncannot flow from protein to DNA. The Central Dogma (Crick 1958) was\ninitially cast in terms of structural information (Šustar\n2007),\n Figure 2,\n and later recast by Crick as a more cybernetic or computational kind\nof information (Crick 1970). [See Eugene V. Koonin 2012 & 2015 for\ndiscussion of the nature of the Central Dogma in current biology.] \nFigure 1. Yearly frequency of count for\nthe word ‘replication’ in Google text’s English\ncorpus from 1800–2000 with smoothing = 3. Data obtained from\nGoogle Ngram Viewer (see\n Other Internet Resources). \nStructural information is effectively based on the transfer of\nmolecular primary sequences (linear sequence) in the synthesis of\npolypeptides; that is, it is the literal sequence of basic groups\n(amino acids), before the protein folds into secondary and higher\nconformations. This is a physical and causal account of information:\nthe new molecule has its sequence because it was templated in some way\nby the “information”-imparting molecule (in this case, DNA\nto proteins). Griffiths and Stotz (see below) call this, accordingly,\n“Crick information”. \nHowever, in the late 1950s, after the structure of DNA had become more\nwidely understood, chemist Homer Jacobson proposed a\ncybernetic model of reproduction (Jacobson 1958), going so\nfar as to make a literal model out of train sets and electronic\ncircuits. Later, von Neumann proposed a theory of self-reproducing\nautomata (Neumann 1966) which has become a parallel but influential\nresearch program to the issue in biology (Mitchell 2009). Jacob (1973)\ncemented the logical description of heredity, but the ultimate\nclassical source of the notion that genes are information comes from\nWilliams’ classic 1966 book Adaptation and Natural\nSelection, in which he referred to genes as “cybernetic\nabstractions” (1966: 33). \nThe cybernetic notion of reproduction (and later, replication) rested\non the notion that genes were controllers of phenotypes;\nlater, this came to be identified (e.g., by Gatlin) as synonymous with\nthe “communication” conception of information that Shannon\nproposed. In biology, genes came to be seen as “programs”\nfor phenotypes [‘senders’] that passed themselves on to\nprogeny [‘receivers’], around 1961 (Peluffo 2015). \nWilliams’ book was one inspiration for Dawkins’\nSelfish Gene (1976), and much of what Dawkins proposed about\nreplicators is an extension of Williams’ views, in conjunction\nwith those of William D. Hamilton (1964) and various ethological\nideas. This view is now known as the gene’s eye view (for a\nreview see Okasha 2006, Chapter 5) \nWilliams introduced the notion of a gene as a substrate neutral\nentity: \nI use the term ‘gene’ to mean that which separates and\nrecombines with appreciable frequency, (1966: 20) \nand he further defined an evolutionary gene (that is, one\nthat is selectively important): \n[A] gene could be defined as any hereditary information for which\nthere is a favorable or unfavorable selection bias equal to several or\nmany times its rate of endogenous change. (1966: 25) \nHis answer to the question of what a gene is, is that a gene is\nevolutionary just insofar as it is something heritable that is subject\nto rates of selection that exceed the mutation rate. This is a\ndefinition, not a discovery. If it’s favorably or unfavorably\nselected and heritable, it’s an evolutionary gene. According to\nthis definition, items that are not made of DNA can be classed as\nevolutionary genes so long as they match Williams’ definition\n(Lu & Bourrat 2018). \nFigure 2. The Central Dogma of genetics\nas envisaged by Crick around 1965 (Thieffry & Sarkar 1998). \nThe language of “codes” and “information”\nflows easily enough with respect to replication (see the entry\n biological information).\n Transcription, translation, punctuation, redundancy, synonymy,\nediting, proofreading, errors, repairing of errors, messages, copies,\nand information all sound natural enough. Yet, the literature dealing\nwith information is both extensive and factious. Several different\nformal analyses of information can be found and very little agreement\nabout which analysis is best for which subjects. On one point these\nscholars tend to agree—cybernetic information and\ncommunication-theoretic information will not do for replication in\nbiological contexts. Some argue for semantic information\n(Godfrey-Smith 2000a; Sarkar 2000; Sterelny 2000b). The trouble is\nthat no widely accepted version of semantic information exists. Winnie\n(2000) distinguishes between Classical and Algorithmic Information\nTheory and opts for a revised version of the Algorithmic Theory. But\nonce again, the problem is that no such formal analysis currently\nexists. \nIn the face of all this disagreement and unfinished business,\nbiologists such as Maynard Smith (2000) maintain either that informal\nanalyses of “information” are good enough or that some\nfuture formal version of information theory will justify the sorts of\ninferences that they make. The sense of “information” used\nin the Central Dogma of molecular biology is more like a fit of\ntemplate, or the primary structure of the protein sequence compared to\nthe sequence of the DNA base pairs. Attempts have been made in what is\nnow known as bioinformatics to use Classical Information Theory\n(Shannon’s theory of communication) to extract functional and\nphylogenetic information (Brooks & Wiley 1988; Gatlin 1972;\nMaclaurin 1998; Rodrick Wallace & Wallace 1998), but they appear\nto have been unsuccessful in the main. \nWhile the most likely conclusion is that no version of information\ntheory as currently formulated can handle “information” as\nit functions in biology (Griffiths 2001), attempts have continued to\nbe made to formulate just such a version (Bergstrom & Rosvall\n2011; Sternberg 2008). However, this undercuts the motivation for\nappealing to information theory to elucidate genes in the first\ninstance. Griffiths & Stotz (2013: 153) have argued for\n“Crick” information, which they define as “the\nspecification of the order of amino acids in a polypeptide\nchain”. This specificity definition is more chemical than\nabstract (see the section below on \nDevelopmental Systems Theory). \nThe “informational gene” conception, as James R. Griesemer\n(2005) terms it, is a highly abstract concept of a process and the\nentities that comprise it. This is intentional, as it permits\nDarwinian dynamics to be applied to a range of phenomena, such as\nsociocultural, cybernetic, and medical processes. However, this raises\na metaphysical concern, namely that the view that a gene is nothing\nbut information is a version of Aristotelian hylomorphism (see the\nentry\n form versus matter).\n That is, information is a type of form, which can be used to explain\nphysical processes. Classical hylomorphism was roundly demolished as a\nscientific hypothesis when Daltonian elements were named and\ninvestigated in the nineteenth century. By 1900, terms like\n“substance” (for matter that is propertyless apart from\nmass and extension in space) and “form” had taken on a\nlargely philosophical sense that differed extensively from\nAristotle’s own physical views. Griesemer notes: \nWe know that the informational genes are tied to matter and structure,\nbut if evolutionary theory – to be general enough to cover\ncultural and conceptual change – must be devoid of all reference\nto concrete mechanism, it cannot follow from the theory, for example,\nthat genes are inside organisms or are even parts of organisms, as\nDawkins’s language suggests. Strictly, only the correlations\nbetween replicator and vehicle due to causal connections of a\ncompletely unspecified sort can be implied by such a theory. Striving\nto get matter and specific structure out of the theory in order to\nmake it apply to immaterial realms may thus leave it bankrupt as an\naccount of causal connection for the material, biological cases.\n(Griesemer 2005: 79) \nAnd yet, this kind of hylomorphism has remained, even in science.\nBiologists have argued that form determined many properties of\norganisms in ways that could not be reduced to the actions of their\nparts, and this kind of thinking remained and was co-opted by the\nmolecular biologists and geneticists. Thus, we get the Central Dogma\nof molecular biology: \nThe Central Dogma\n\nThis states that once ‘information’ has passed into\nprotein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer\nof information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid\nto protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or\nfrom protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the\nprecise determination of sequence, either of bases in the\nnucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. (Crick\n1958) \nRead physically, this means only that the structure of the DNA\nmolecule is not reproduced from the structure of proteins, a perfectly\nreasonable account of the molecular processes. But because Crick used\nthe word “information”, some scientists, including\nDawkins, took this to mean genes are informational entities, that\n“code” for organismic traits from the molecular level up\nto the entire organism and even beyond. This is striking in a purple\npassage of The Blind Watchmaker, where Dawkins describe genes\nthe following way \nIt is raining DNA outside. [downy seeds from willow trees] …\nThe cotton wool is mostly made of cellulose, and it dwarfs the tiny\ncapsule that contains the DNA, the genetic information. The DNA\ncontent must be a small proportion of the total, so why did I say that\nit was raining DNA rather than cellulose? The answer is that it is the\nDNA that matters… whose coded characters spell out specific\ninstructions for building willow trees… It is raining\ninstructions out there, it’s raining programs; it’s\nraining tree-growing, fluff spreading, algorithms. That is not a\nmetaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if\nit were raining floppy disks. (1986: 111) \nSo we now turn to Dawkins’ view of genes as replicators, and the\nway in which he takes information to be cybernetic and physical at the\nsame time. \nRichard Dawkins introduced the distinction between replicators and\nvehicles in his The Selfish Gene (1976). For his purposes\nDawkins found the contrast between genes and organisms too restrictive\nand specific. Everyone agrees that genes are replicators, but genes\nmay not be the only replicators. Dawkins also argued that perhaps more\ninclusive entities than single genes might also function as\nreplicators. At the very least, the possibility should not be ignored.\nSo, Dawkins adopted “replicator” as a more inclusive and\ngeneral term than “gene”. In The Extended\nPhenotype he defined a replicator as “anything in the\nuniverse of which copies are made” (Dawkins 1982b: 83). He also\nintroduced the term “vehicle” for those entities produced\nby replicators that help these replicators increase in numbers by\ninteracting effectively with their environments. This distinction can\nbe expressed in terms of either entities or processes. According to\nDawkins, replicators function in replication, while vehicles function\nin environmental interaction. \nA long-standing dispute in evolutionary biology concerns the levels at\nwhich selection can occur (Bourrat 2015c, 2015b, 2016; Brandon 1996;\nKerr & Godfrey-Smith 2002; Keller 1999; Lloyd 1988; Okasha 2006,\n2016; Sober & Wilson 1998; Williams 1966) [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n Some authors see this dispute as concerning the levels at which\nreplication can take place. Other authors take the levels of selection\ndispute to concern environmental interaction and insist that\nenvironmental interaction can take place at a variety of levels, from\nsingle genes, cells and organisms to colonies, demes and possibly\nentire species. Organisms certainly interact with their environments\nin ways that bias the transmission of their genes, but then so do\nentities that are both less inclusive than entire organisms (e.g.,\nsperm cells) and more inclusive (e.g., beehives). \nDawkins argued that replication in biological evolution\noccurs exclusively at the level of the genetic material. The term\n“replication” refers first and foremost to copying, and\ngenes are the self-replicating molecules of biology. Some critics\n(e.g., Lewontin 1991: 48) interpreted this to mean that a strand of\nDNA placed on a glass slide might start replicating all on its own. Of\ncourse, no biologist has ever held such view. Genes do replicate\nthemselves, but only with the aid of highly complicated molecular\nmachinery. Too often, however, the importance of this machinery has\ngone unnoticed. To be sure, when we make copies on a photocopier, we\nare interested in the texts, figures or just scrawls that appear on\nthese sheets of paper. We are not interested in how the photocopier\nworks, even if it does all the work. \nIn Dawkins’ early writings, replicators and vehicles played\ndifferent but complementary and equally important roles in selection,\nbut as he honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became\nless and less fundamental. Initially, Dawkins was content to dethrone\nthe organism from its pride of place in biology. It is an important\nfocus of environmental interaction, but other entities, both below and\nabove the organismic level, can also function as vehicles. In later\nwritings, however, Dawkins went even further to argue that phenotypic\ntraits are what really matter for evolution by natural selection to\noccur, and that they can be treated independently of their being\norganized into vehicles. More than that, features such as spider webs\nshould be viewed as part of a spider’s phenotype. Hence, Dawkins\ntitled his second book The Extended Phenotype (Dawkins\n1982b). \nDawkins never lost his fascination with vehicular adaptations, a\nfascination that his critics denigrate as Panglossian adaptationism.\nHe filled his books with adaptationist scenarios, some more firmly\nsupported by data than others, but from the perspective of the\nstructure of evolutionary theory, he held that replicators are much\nmore important than vehicles. For example, Dawkins argued at some\nlength that adaptations are always for the good of replicators, not\nvehicles (Lloyd 1992), see entry on\n units and levels of selection.\n Vehicles exhibit these adaptations, but ultimately all\nadaptations must be explicable in terms of changes in gene\nfrequencies. Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins (1994: 617)\nproclaims that he “coined the term ‘vehicle’ not to\npraise it but to bury it”. As prevalent as organisms might be,\nas definite as the causal roles that they play in selection are,\nreference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous\ncharacterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Although\nDawkins is far from a genetic determinist, he is certainly a\ngenetic reductionist. Whether reductionism itself is good or\nbad is a moot question (Sarkar 1998). \nAccording to Dawkins, replicators have three basic\nproperties—longevity, fecundity and\ncopy-fidelity. Longevity means longevity of the gene\ntype in the form of copies through descent (Dawkins 1982b:\n84; Hull 1980), although the stability of gene tokens is\nincluded in the definition in The Selfish Gene (1976: 18). No\ngene as a physical body lasts all that long. In mitosis, a gene loses\nhalf of its substance at each replication. What endures, he says, is\nnot the entity itself but the information incorporated in its\nstructure. It is this information that is copied with such high\nfidelity. Mutations do occur, but at very low frequencies. Even so, in\nsome organisms mutation rates must be too high because mechanisms have\nevolved that search out and repair such errors. The genotype is\ntherefore an informational notion; information is equivalent to\nAristotelian form. The type is the form of the tokens, in\nDawkins’ view. \nOne source of variation in genes of sexual organisms supplementing\nmutation is crossover. Pairs of homologous chromosomes line up next to\neach other at meiosis, crossover and recombine. For stretches of DNA\nin which different alleles exist, the result can be a change in\ninformation. Quite obviously, the shorter the stretch of DNA involved,\nthe less likely that crossover will occur and the message changed.\nDawkins appeals to such dismantling of entities to argue against\norganisms functioning as replicators. In sexual organisms, organisms\nthemselves are torn apart and repeatedly assembled each generation\n(Caporael 2003). If long stretches of DNA lack the necessary identity\nby descent to function as replicators, then sexual organisms certainly\nlack it. However, some other explanation has to be provided for\nasexual organisms because they pass on their overall structure largely\nunchanged from generation to generation. For example, R. A. Fisher, in\nhis The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (Fisher 1930)\nconsidered the entire genetic complement of asexual organisms to be a\nsingle gene, and this view has been repeated from time to time since.\nAccording to Dawkins, genes, and only genes, can function as\nreplicators in biological evolution. How large these genetic units are\ndepends on such things as the prevalence of sex, the frequency of\ncrossover or lateral gene transfers, and the intensity of\nselection. \nIf there were sex but no crossing-over, each chromosome would be a\nreplicator, and we should speak of adaptations as being for the good\nof the chromosome. If there is no sex we can, by the same token, treat\nthe entire genome of an asexual organism as a replicator. But the\norganism itself is not a replicator. (Dawkins 1982a: 95) \nDawkins offered two reasons for organisms not being able to function\nas replicators. The first is the one he uses to delineate evolutionary\ngenes. As is the case for long stretches of DNA, organisms are too\neasily and frequently broken up to be considered units of replication.\nA second reason is that they cannot pass on changes in their\nstructure, although some phenotypic change may result in generational\nchange. In fact, some epigenetic mechanisms have been shown\nto be passed on across generations (Jablonka & Raz 2009; see the\nentry on\n inheritance systems).\n The amount of DNA that counts as a replicator certainly varies, but\naccording to Dawkins, nothing more inclusive than the genetic material\nfunctions as replicators in biological evolution. \nIn The Selfish Gene, although Dawkins wanted his definition\nof gene to be close to that of Williams’ (1966)\n“evolutionary gene”, it isn’t quite: \nA gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material which\npotentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural\nselection. (Dawkins 1976: 30) \nWhere Williams’ definition is substrate neutral, Dawkins’\nis explicitly chromosomal and DNA-based. Where William’s\n“gene” refers to any entity, which is the reason\nwhy it is an informational notion, Dawkins’ gene, by contrast,\nis tied to DNA; a view later heavily criticized by Stent (1977), an\ninfluential molecular biologist at the time. \nOn Dawkins’ account, the limits of genes need not be absolutely\nsharp. Nor must all genes be of the same length. The greater the\nselection pressure, the smaller the gene. At the most fundamental\nlevel, selection takes place between alternative alleles residing at\nthe same locus. \nAs far as a gene is concerned, its alleles are its deadly rivals, but\nother genes are just a part of its environment, comparable to\ntemperature, food, and predators, or companions. (Dawkins 1976:\n40) \nAlleles cannot cooperate with each other; only compete. That is where\nthe “selfish” in “selfish gene” comes in.\nAccording to Dawkins (1976: 95), the selfish gene is not just one\nphysical bit of DNA. It is “all replicas of a particular bit of\nDNA, distributed throughout the world” (for a recent defense of\na similar approach, see Haig 2012). Hence, genes do not form classes\nof spatiotemporally unrelated individuals but trees. They must be\nreplicas. But being a replica is not enough. The linear repetition of\nthe “same gene” in the form of several hundred copies is\nquite common. These replicas, however, do not reside at the same\nlocus. Although identical in structure, these genes do not\ncompete with each other in the way that alleles at the same locus can.\nIn the simplest and most basic sense, alleles compete with alternative\nalleles at the same locus. Any other sorts of competition and\ncooperation are merely extrapolations from this fundamental sense of\nallelic competition. Even though genes may cooperate with each other\nin very complicated ways in embryological development, in replication\nthey can be treated as “separate and distinct”. In\ndevelopment the effects of genes blend. In replication replicators do\nnot blend. \nDawkins introduced the general notions of replicator and vehicle so\nthat selection need not be limited exclusively to gene-based\nbiological evolution. However, as the preceding discussion indicates,\nhis later revisions to his general theoretical outlook were influenced\nstrongly by the traditional perspective of genes and organisms. Genes\ncontain the information necessary to produce organisms and their\nadaptations. Genes “ride around” in and\n“guide” organisms. As Dawkins describes them, vehicles are\nrelatively discrete entities that “house” replicators and\nwhich can be regarded as machines programmed to preserve and propagate\nthe replicators that ride inside them. Although these terms may be\nappropriate for the relations between genes and organisms, they\ninterfere with a more general analysis of replication and selection.\nWhat really matters in selection is that entities at various levels of\norganization interact with their environments in such a way that the\nrelevant replicators increase in relative frequency. The actual causal\nchain that connects replicators and vehicles need not be limited to\ndevelopment. \nFor example, Dawkins argues at some length that genes and only genes\ncan function as replicators in biological evolution. He adds that\n“all adaptations are for the preservation of DNA; DNA itself\njust is” (Dawkins 1982a: 45). But DNA itself exhibits\nadaptations. Anyone who has spent much time examining the molecular\nstructure of DNA soon realizes that it is adapted to replicate. In\naddition, the proliferation of junk DNA, transposons, and meiotic\ndrive are three examples in which the only phenotypes that matter are\nphenotypic characteristics of genes (Brandon 1996; Sterelny 1996:\n388). Dawkins’ characterizations of replicators, vehicles and\nthe relations between the two are too closely tied to genes, organisms\nand development. DNA can certainly replicate itself, but it can also\nfunction as a “vehicle” even though it cannot code for,\nride around in or direct itself. In sum, a more general\ncharacterization of selection is needed, a characterization that does\nnot assume that the only causal connection between replicators and\nvehicles is development from embryo to maturity. Such a generalization\nwas offered by Hull (1980, 1981, 1988) who proposed that the relevant\nnotion is “interactor” rather than “vehicle”,\nas interactors are causal and active while vehicles are passive\nentities. \nAlthough Dawkins finds it desirable to replace genes with replicators\nin his general characterization of the evolutionary process, he says\nvery little about this more general notion in his The Selfish\nGene. Only one chapter (11) is dedicated to “memetic”\nevolution. Instead, as we saw, he discusses the special case of genes\nas replicators. The primacy of the genetic perspective in the\ncharacterization of replicators is claimed by some (Griesemer 2000b)\nto be one of the chief weaknesses not only in Dawkins’\ndiscussions but also in the work of his successors [see the\nsection below on\n Reproducers]. Hull\nand his colleagues (Hull, Langman, & Glenn 2001) claim to be\nproviding a general notion of replication, adequate to handle all\ndifferent sorts of replication, when too often we are simply reading\npeculiarities of genetic replication into our general analysis of\nreplication. \nDoes replication play the same role in other sorts of selection that\nit plays in gene-based biological evolution? The reaction of the\nimmune system to antigens is closest to the standard biological\nexample of replication and selection (Hull et al. 2001). Certainly immune systems arose through the same process as other\nfunctional systems. The basic structure of the human immune system is\n“built into our genes”, and the only genes that count in\nevolution are the ones that we received from our ancestors and can\nsubsequently pass on to our progeny. In Dawkins’ (1982b: 83)\nterminology, the genes that code for our immune system are active,\ngerm-line replicators. They are active because they influence their\nprobability to be copied; they are germ-line, because they can\npotentially have an infinity of descendants. \nHowever, the genes that function in the reaction of the immune system\nto antigens have two peculiarities. First, they incorporate mechanisms\ndesigned to produce very high frequencies of mutation, and second,\nnone of the genes involved in the functioning of the immune system are\ngerm-line. The genes that give rise to B-cells for instance are\ndesigned to mutate extensively until one of these cells identifies an\ninvader as foreign. It then proliferates extensively as it attacks the\ninvader. As an organism matures, it accumulates more and more of the\nB-cells that have been successful in its past. More than this, as the\nprocess of proliferation continues, the strength of the affinities to\nbinding sites increases. Initially the primary antibodies almost\nalways exhibit a weak affinity for their targets, but as the reaction\nto the antigen continues, these affinities become stronger. \nWithin the confines of a single organism, the reaction of the immune\nsystem to antigens has all the characteristics of selection processes,\nbut when the organism dies all of these adaptations are lost. In some\nspecies, females pass on not only the genes for the basic structure of\ntheir immune systems but also some of the machinery that past\ninvasions of antigens have produced in her. However, these cells are\nrapidly removed from the offspring as it develops its own immune\nsystem. The reaction of the immune system to antigens departs from\ngene-based selection in biological evolution in two ways. First, from\nthe organismal perspective, the genes that function in protecting an\norganism from invaders are not germ-line. They are somatic. Second,\nthe relevant mutation rates are much, much higher in the immune system\nthan in ordinary gene-based selection. Instead of mechanisms existing\nto discover mutations and repair them, mechanisms exist that encourage\nmutations—massively so. If the functioning of the immune system\nis to count as an adaptive process, then some changes must be made.\nOne possibility is to clarify what counts as a “germ-line”\nreplicator and a rejection of the notion that extremely low mutation\nrates are inherent in all selection processes [see\nthe section below on\n Challenges to the Replicator]. \nThe temptation to regard cultures and societies as evolving entities\nin a way analogous to organism has a long tradition. In The\nSelfish Gene (Chapter 11), Dawkins proposes a version of it that\nmakes use of the concept of the replicator. He chose the word\n“meme” for a sociocultural replicator because of its\nsimilarities with the word gene: \nWe need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of\na unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.\n‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a\nmonosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’ (Dawkins 1976:\n192). \nThe basic idea, underlying Dawkins’ proposal is that since\nevolution by natural selection in the biological domain requires\nreplication, it must also be the case in the sociocultural domain, and\nthat imitation, at least in many cases, is the way through which\nsociocultural entities, the memes, replicate. \nImportant differences exist between sociocultural evolution and\nbiological evolution (Claidière & André 2012) [see\nthe entry on\n cultural evolution].\n For example, Dawkins (1976) admits that he is on shaky ground when it\ncomes to the high-fidelity copying required of replicators. Memes seem\nto get changed much more frequently than genes (see Sterelny (2006)\nfor a review). In general, however, it is fair to say that the\nstandards used to evaluate sociocultural transmission are not on par\nwith those used to evaluate biological transmission. An overly\nidealized view of Mendelian genetics is contrasted to a much more\nrealistic view of cultural change. So the criticism goes, one problem\nwith memes is that they do not have discrete boundaries, do not all\ncome in the same size, and in their functioning are strongly\ninfluenced by their environments. Genes, so the critics claim, have\nsharp boundaries, are all of the same size, and are immune to\nenvironmental influences. If sociocultural evolution is to be\nevaluated fairly, the same level of criticism must be applied to all\nputative examples of selection from gene-based selection in biological\nevolution and the reaction of the immune system to antigens to the\ndevelopment of the central nervous system and social learning (Hull et\nal. 2001). The collection of articles in Aunger (2000) present the\narguments pro- and against a memetic approach to culture and a more\nrecent discussion is available in Lewens (2015). \nDawkins (1976) also places considerable emphasis on human brains as\nthe “vehicles” for memetic evolution. He defines\n“meme” as an entity capable of being transmitted from one\nbrain to another. Computers are also plausible vehicles for memes, as\nwell as artifacts more generally which can ‘store’ and\nthen release information when a copy of the artifact is made by\nemulation (mimesis), that is without the presence of a\ndemonstration. Dawkins’ discussion of memes is, however, marred\nby the pervasiveness of the gene-organism perspective. For example, he\ndefines “replicator” in terms of transmission of\ninformation—memes leaping from brain to brain or from brains to\ncomputers and back again. But memes do not leap from brain to brain or\nfrom computer to computer. Their content is transmitted in a variety\nof ways, including books, audiotapes, conversations and the like. As\nmuch as the physical basis changes, the message remains sufficiently\nunchanged. All instances of this message are equally memes, not just\nthe ones residing in human brains and computers. \nSeveral accounts of memetic replication have been proposed in the\nliterature. Some consider that there is no replication in cultural\nevolution, but that memes are “attractor points” in\nculture (Atran 1998). Others consider that the interactor is the meme\nitself (Blackmore 1999) or that the meme is the selected cultural\nheritable information just as Williams’ “evolutionary\ngene” is the selected genetic heritable information, and the\nmemetic interactor is the repertoire of behaviors it elicits (Wilkins\n1998). One view that has been offered several times is that memes are\nactive neural structures (Aunger 1998, 2002; Delius 1991). \nAll the objections to the gene-meme analogy to one side, Dawkins\n(1976: 211) finds the chief difference between genetic and memetic\nchange is that biological evolution is at bottom a war between alleles\nresiding at the same locus. “Memes seem to have nothing\nequivalent to chromosomes and nothing equivalent to alleles”.\nFirst, the usual depiction of alleles residing at the same locus on\nhomologous chromosomes so central to Mendelian genetics is an\noversimplification, but more importantly, for at least half of the\nhistory of life on earth, replication and selection took place in the\nabsence of chromosomes, meiosis and the like. If gene-based biological\nevolution took place for so long in the absence of the Mendelian\napparatus and still does so in many extant organisms, then demanding\nthat memetic evolution proceed by this very special and possibly\naberrant sort of inheritance seems too strong. The cost of meiosis\nremains a serious problem in ordinary biological evolution. Demanding\nthat cultural evolution incorporates this same highly problematic\nelement in its own makeup seems strange in the extreme. If we are to\ndevelop a general analysis of selection, then we must distinguish\nbetween essential and contingent features of this process.. \nNumerous evolutionary biologists question how fundamental to selection\nthe perspective of alleles at a locus actually is. Almost everyone\nagrees that evolution involves changes in gene frequencies. However,\nfew go on to add that evolution is nothing but changes in\ngene frequencies. When one looks at evolutionary biology, one\ndiscovers that it involves much more than changes in gene frequencies.\nTo be successful, memetic evolution must be fleshed out. \nIn 2000, Aunger summarized the disputes between proponents and\nskeptics of the memetic approach, as revolving around three\nlevels: \nNearly 20 years after the diagnosis, it seems however that the memetic\napproach has, by and large, been abandoned, with some of its insights\nincorporated into other evolutionary approaches to culture. Perhaps\nthe most successful is dual-inheritance theory (Richerson & Boyd\n2008), also known as gene-culture coevolution. A very general\ncharacterization of the sociocultural evolution has been attempted by\nEl Mouden, André, Morin, & Nettle (2014). This approach\nwhich relies on the most abstract formalism used by evolutionary\ntheorists, namely the Price equation (for an introduction to the Price\nequation see Okasha 2006: Chap. 1), highlights some of the differences\nbetween biological and sociocultural evolution, and why a pure memetic\napproach seems difficult to implement as a general framework. \nSome of Dawkins’ critics think that genes play too important of\na role in his notion of replication. Replication, so they argue, can\noccur at other levels of organization as well. Just as Dawkins\nextended the notion of the phenotype, these authors propose to make\nthe notion of replicators more general as well—to extend the\nreplicator so to speak. Dawkins introduced his Extended\nPhenotype conception for two reasons. First, he wanted to extend\nthe notion of a “phenotypic trait”. The sort of nest that\na bird builds or the song that it sings can count as phenotypic traits\njust as much as the shape of its bill. Second, as mentioned earlier,\nDawkins wanted to break the hold that organisms have over how we\nconceptualize the living world. Traits do tend to come bundled into\nreasonably discrete entities, but for making inferences about the\nevolutionary process, traits can be treated as separate and distinct.\nHowever, as he proceeded, Dawkins eventually decided that extending\nthe phenotype was not enough. He had to bury it. All sorts of\nfascinating mechanisms to one side, what really matters in selection\ntakes place at the level of replicators. \nAlthough such critics of Dawkins as Sterelny, Smith, & Dickison\n(1996) declined to join with Dawkins in his demotion of environmental\ninteraction, they did agree with him that replicators are special.\nThey play a special role in development. However, they do not limit\nreplicators to genes even in biological evolution. Sterelny et al.\npropose to extend the replicator to include nonstandard entities:\n“the set of developmental resources that are adapted from the\ntransmission of similarity across the generations” (Sterelny\n2001: 338). For example, the sort of burrow that a particular organism\ndigs is influenced by its genetic makeup, but if these burrows are\nused over and over again, characteristics of these burrows can\nthemselves be viewed as replicators. The effects of these burrows get\npassed on from generation to generation, but not via the DNA. \nAs more and more non-DNA replicators, including epigenetic\ninheritance, are acknowledged, Dawkins’ view began to grade into\nthe conception of the Extended Replicator, which Sterelny et al.\n(1996) specify as any non-genetic as well as genetic replicators where\n‘genetic’ refers to DNA. These two views are so general\nthat any case that can be described in one can be redescribed in the\nother. Differences lie in ease of description. According to Sterelny\net al. (1996), the burrows that some organisms dig can function as\nreplicators—extended replicators—while Dawkins portrays\nthem as instances of extended phenotypes. The contrast is between\nselfish burrows and selfish genes for burrowing. \nIn the version of replication formulated by Sterelny et al. (1996)\nboth copying and biofunction are crucial. Copying is quite obviously a\ncausal phenomenon, but not any old causal connection will do.\nSimilarity of copies is necessary, but not sufficient. These copies\nmust be copies of copies. One copy must produce another copy and that\ncopy produce still another copy and so on. For one entity to be a copy\nof another, it must be the output of a process whose biofunction is to\nconserve function. The function of copying is to produce from one\ntoken another token which is similar in the relevant respects. Genes\nfit this definition, but so do lots of examples of non-genetic\ntransmission; e.g., habitat stability resulting from nest site\nimprinting, the song that a bird learns, various microorganism\nsymbionts, not to mention sociocultural transmission. \nIn the wake of Oyama’s The Ontogeny of Information\n(1985, 2000) and other work, notably that of Daniel Lehrman (1953)\nand Patrick Bateson (2001), a view of biological evolution has arisen\nthat emphasizes development (see also Griffiths & Gray 1994a). In\nthe nineteenth century development was an extremely active research\nprogram. The next great discoveries in biology were going to be in the\narea of development. It was not to be. First Mendelian genetics and\nthen a version of evolutionary theory centered on population genetics\ntook over biology, and they did so while avoiding development.\nEveryone knew that development was central to both evolution and\nreproduction, but no one could see how to integrate the masses of\ndevelopmental data available into the emerging synthesis of\nevolutionary biology and genetics. As a result, development was left\nout of the Modern Synthesis (Beurton, Falk, & Rheinberger 2000;\nGilbert 1991). Considering how central development actually is in\nmetazoan and metaphyte biology, the advances made while ignoring it\nare staggering. \nEven so, developmental biology continued on its course until at long\nlast we seem to understand development well enough to begin\nintegrating it into the rest of biology. On the most conservative\nview, current versions of evolutionary theory can remain largely\nunchanged as development is grafted onto them. On a second view, both\nperspectives are likely to require some modification to bring off this\nintegration. Our understanding of development may have to be modified,\nbut so too for evolutionary theory (Pigliucci & Müller 2010).\nFinally, at the other extreme, development will all but replace\nevolutionary theory. In their more exuberant moments, some advocates\nof Developmental Systems Theory (hereafter DST) seem to be claiming\njust that. Just as some molecular biologists think that molecular\nbiology is rapidly replacing all the rest of biology, some advocates\nof DST argue that developmental theories will simply replace current\nversions of evolutionary theory. \nOn some versions of the DST view, genes have no uniquely privileged\nrole in repeated cycles of development (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths\n& Gray 1994b). In fact, no element of the developmental matrix\nplays any privileged causal role—not genes, not organisms, not\nthe environment, not anything. Everything counts as a resource, albeit\nin particular situations certain resources will play more important\nroles than other resources. In rejecting any privileged role for\ngenes, advocates of DST are especially skeptical of one particular\nrole supposedly played by genes—the transmission of information.\nAccording to some, information is central to developmentalism, but\ngenes are not the only mechanisms for information transfer. According\nto others, information plays no role in the emerging developmentalist\nperspective. The developmental system as a whole is the unit of\nselection [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n If genes have no special role and whole developmental cycles are\nreplicators, as some developmental- systems theorists argue, the\ndistinction between replicator and interactor becomes blurred. \nIn the continuing debate over developmental versus traditional\ntheories of evolutionary biology, Sterelny et al. (1996) hold a fairly\nconservative position. They agree with the developmentalists that\ngenes play no privileged role in the development of phenotypes from\ngenotypes. Genes do play a role in this process, only simply not a\nprivileged role. Genes can serve as a causal bridge from\nphenotype to phenotype, but other entities can do so as well. Genes\nare not the only replicators in biological evolution. The repeated\ncycles in inheritance include many different sorts of constancies and\nrepetitions—genes, cellular machinery, phenotypic traits\nincluding behaviors, and social structures. Information remains\ncentral to selection processes, but genes are not the only carriers of\nsuch information. Genes predict phenotypic characters only in the same\nsense that environmental factors predict them. Sterelny (2000a) has\nargued that developmental considerations require no fundamental\nreevaluation of evolutionary conceptions along the lines of DST. \nGodfrey-Smith (2009; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b; Griesemer 2005)\ncontrasts the replicator/interactor approach to natural selection with\na more classical approach. This latter approach is usually given as a\n“recipe” for evolution by natural selection to use\nGodfrey-Smith’s terminology (see also Brandon 1990: 3.1). Ever\nsince Darwin, a number of authors have proposed that for evolution by\nnatural selection to occur three conditions or ingredients are\nnecessary. A population should exhibit (1) variation, that (2) leads\nto differences in fitness between the entities forming the population\n[see the entry on\n fitness],\n (3) which are heritable (reviewed in Godfrey-Smith 2007). The most\nfamous version of these recipes is the one provided by Lewontin\n1970. \nThere is a difference in emphasis between the two approaches in that\nthe replicator/interactor approach focuses on the entities\nforming the population, while the classical approach provides a\npopulation description of evolutionary change. Another difference\nbetween the two approaches, is that under the classical approach\nreplication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur. In fact, as long as heritability is positive, and the two other\nconditions are satisfied, then evolution by natural selection can\noccur (but will not necessarily do so, cf. Godfrey-Smith 2009: 25). An\nabstract definition of heritability (\\(h^2\\))—although by no\nmeans fully general (see Bourrat 2015a)—is that it represents\nthe slope of the regression of average offspring character on parent\nor mid-parent (in case of sexual species) character (see the entry on\n Heritability).\n Given a positive heritability does not entail replication of\ncharacter between parent and offspring, but is rather a special case,\nin which heritability would be exactly 1 in the absence of\nenvironmental variation, the replicator/interactor perspective is\nsubsumed by the classical approach. Godfrey-Smith concurs: \nFrom this point of view, we can see the replicator analysis as picking\nout a special case of what is covered (or supposed to be covered) by\nthe classical view. (2009: 36; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b) \nTo see why a lack of replication does not prevent evolution by natural\nselection from occurring, suppose a population of entities exists with\ndifferent sizes, as presented in\n Figure 3(a),\n in which there is selection for larger entities. We assume that the\nentities reproduce asexually in discrete generations and that there is\nno environmental variation. At the parental generation, there are two\ntypes of individuals, with respective sizes of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and 1.\nBecause of the selection for size, entities of size \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\nproduce 3 offspring while entities of size 1 produce 4 offspring.\nSuppose now that there is a positive heritability, as defined above,\nso that, on average, offspring resemble more their parent than they\nresemble other entities of the parental generation, as is displayed on\n Figure 3(a),\n but only slightly so (\\(h^2 = 0.2\\)). After one generation,\nalthough there is no high-fidelity replication, the average size of\nthe population has changed, due to the effect of natural\nselection. This simple example demonstrates quite straightforwardly\nthat replication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur. \nWe said earlier that replication would imply a heritability of exactly\n1 in the absence of environmental variation. Although this is correct,\nthe reverse is not true. In fact, take again a similar population as\nin\n Figure 3(a),\n but this time assume a different pattern of inheritance for the two\ntypes of entities as displayed in\n Figure 3(b).\n With this pattern of inheritance, although there is no replication,\nentities, on average, have the exact same character as their parent.\nIn the case of the entities of size \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), some\noffspring have the exact same character as their parent, but that is\nnot required either, as is the case with the entities of size 1, of\nwhich none of the offspring has the same character as their\nparent. \nOne possible response against regarding the classical approach to\nevolution by natural selection as unconditionally superior to the\nreplicator/interactor approach, is to argue that although evolution by\nnatural selection can occur without replication, when this happens,\nthe evolutionary change resulting is not a pure case of\nevolution by natural selection. Rather, it is evolution by natural\nselection mixed with some other evolutionary processes. A rationale\nfor this claim is that the fact offspring do not resemble their parent\nintroduces some variation in the population of which the origin is not\nnatural selection. In abstract terms, the introduction of variation\ncan be regarded as a form mutation. \nUnder this interpretation, the classical approach on the one hand, and\nthe replicator/interactor approach, on the other hand, just emphasize\ndifferent aspects of evolutionary explanations. The classical approach\ngives us evolutionary explanations in the context of other\nevolutionary processes occurring, while the replicator/interactor\napproach gives us evolutionary explanations of what the effect of\nnatural selection would be in the absence of any other evolutionary\nprocess acting in the population, that is, in its pure form.\nUnderstood that way, the two approaches do not necessarily need to be\nopposed. \nAnother challenge to the replicator/interactor approach to evolution\nby natural selection is to see replicators themselves as a\nproduct of natural selection rather than as a necessary\nstarting point. One premise of this argument is that some form of\nnatural selection must have occurred on entities that initially were\nnot replicating, perhaps not even reproducing. This is recognized by\nDawkins, who notes in passing in the second chapter of the Selfish\nGene that “Darwin’s ‘survival of the\nfittest’ is really a special case of a more general law of\nsurvival of the stable” (Dawkins 1976: 13) and that life\noriginated from selection of molecules for stability. The idea that\nevolution by natural selection can occur without reproduction has been\nargued by Bouchard (2008, 2011; see also Doolittle 2014, Bourrat\n2014). \n(a) Population in which there is no replication and a low\nheritability (\\(h^2\\)), yet, evolution by natural selection occurs. \n(b) Population in which there is no replication, yet heritability \nis 1. Evolution by natural selection occurs. \nFigure 3. Illustration of the idea that\nevolution by natural selection can occur without replication. \nThe idea that selection can occur without there being replicators was\nfirst introduced as “chemical selection” in line with the\nviews of Oparin, who proposed that coascervates (colloidal droplets)\ncould encapsulate protobiological chemicals and self-replicate without\ngenes through mechanical fission, a view also independently proposed\nby Haldane (Oparin 1936 [1938], Haldane 1929; see Kolb 2016). This was\nlater extended by the work of Sidney Fox, who showed that proteinoid\nspheres could mechanically reproduce stably (Hsu & Fox 1976). \nIf modern biological systems evolved from molecules that did not have\nthe ability to reproduce, let alone replicate, one might ask, what is\nthe simplest case of evolution by natural selection? It is a case in\nwhich different types of entities have different persistences but do\nnot produce any offspring. In this model, the types with the property\nof persisting longer represent an increasing frequency of the total\npopulation over time. One problem though in a model of persistence\nalone, is that each time one entity goes out of existence, it is not\nreplaced by another entity, so that over time the population size\ntends towards zero. Although this does not mean that evolution by\nnatural selection cannot occur in such populations, this poses\nimportant constraints on the evolutionary dynamics of this population.\nFurthermore, it is possible to regard the ability for a population to\nmaintain its size or increase its size as a primordial form of\nadaptation. To see this one can imagine different populations of\nentities at different locations, some with the ability to produce some\nentities or multiply, others without. It is clear that the populations\nwith the ability to maintain or increase their size would out-compete\nthose that are unable to do so. The ability for a population to\nsustain its population size might thus be regarded as a primordial\nform of adaptation. \nA next ‘stage’ in the evolution from primordial entities\nunable to reproduce to modern biological systems might thus have been\nfor entities to produce new offspring entities (or multiply) without\nthe ability to pass on their properties reliably. In such a situation\nthe size of a population could be maintained. The most extreme form of\nthat would be to imagine a population of two types in which each type\nhas the same probability to produce an offspring of the other types\nthan its own type. With entities of the two types having different\npersistence, a modest form of evolution by natural selection is still\npossible. Versions of this model have been proposed by Wilkins,\nStanyon, & Musgrave (2012), Earnshaw-Whyte (2012) and Bourrat\n(2014). Since there is, on average, no more resemblance between an\noffspring with its parent than any other entity of the parental\ngeneration, and evolution by natural selection is still observed in\nsuch a scenario, one might think that heritability is, strictly\nspeaking not a necessary condition for evolution by natural\nselection. \nWilkins et al. (2012) argue that over time in a reactor with limited\nincoming chemical species, hypercycles (as defined by Eigen,\nBiebricher, Gebinoga, & Gardiner 1991) of reactions will tend to\ninclude reaction types that are more stable and capture more source\nmolecules and energy than variant reaction types, leading to the\nevolution by natural selection of replicator-like molecules as well as\nenergetically efficient “metabolic” molecules. Recent work\nin biochemistry has added strength to that suggestion (Altstein 2015).\nHence, given that no replicator is required for selection (in this\ncase, chemical), replicator molecules can be seen as the\noutcome of selective evolution, not a necessary prior\ncondition for it. In effect, the evolution of replicators is the first\nmajor transition of evolution, despite the view of Szathmáry\nand Maynard Smith that replicators needed to come first (Maynard Smith\n& Szathmáry 1995; Szathmáry & Maynard Smith\n1997). Bourrat (2014), further developed this idea into a series of\nagent-based models. He showed that replication is an attractor in\npopulations lacking heritability once small random mutations\nincreasing or decreasing the fidelity of character inheritance is\nintroduced. \nThe works on the origins of replicators ties in with the notion of the\nreproducer proposed by Griesemer (2000a,b, 2002, 2005;\nWimsatt & Griesemer 2007), although it was published first, based\non a circulated manuscript by Griesemer, by Szathmáry and\nMaynard Smith (1997). A reproducer is an entity that develops and has\na material overlap between the “parent” and\n“progeny”. This causal relationship between parents and\nprogeny is called “progeneration”, the “increase in\nnumerically distinct objects of a given kind”. Reproduction is a\ncomposite process of development and progeneration, leading to objects\nthat are themselves capable of development and progeneration. Thus,\nthe reproducer concept extends the notion of a developmental\nsystem. \nHere inheritance is a system property, not a property of\nparts, unless they are also reproducing systems, and is\ndevelopmentally acquired. Organisms do not arise already capable of\nreproduction in the main, but must undergo orderly transitions before\nthey may reproduce. \nThe relation between reproducers, and replicators and interactors,\nvaries according to author. Griesemer treats replication as the\nterminal form of reproduction, once coding mechanisms have been\nevolved, which is itself an evolved form of multiplication (Griesemer\n2000a: 76). Unlike Dawkins’ replicator concept, which Griesemer\nbelieves is based on a similarity relationship of\n“copying”, a reproducer requires material overlap\nof systems. However, replication arises when material overlap evolves\nprogeneration, and progeneration evolves a codical inheritance system,\nas\n Figure 4\n indicates. \nFigure 4. Wimsatt and Griesemer’s\nreproducer concept (Wimsatt & Griesemer 2007, 268). \nOthers, particularly Jablonka and Lamb (2005, 2007), think that\nreproducers are distinct from replication, and that some epigenetic\ninheritance systems are reproducers without being replicators. For\nthem, a reproducer is the “target of selection” (see the\nentry on\n inheritance systems).\n \nGodfrey-Smith (2009: 83; see also Okasha 2006: 14) takes issue with\nGriesemer’s requirement of “material overlap” as\nbeing too narrow a definiendum of reproducers. He thinks that\nreproducers need not contribute actual material to their progeny\n(where they template for sequences, as in the case of viruses).\nGriesemer believes Godfrey-Smith has over-interpreted the requirement;\nhe is primarily concerned with the idea that parents cause\nprogeny (Griesemer 2014). Charbonneau (2014) furthers the move made by\nGodfrey-Smith. He argues that the existence of parent-offspring\nlineages is unnecessary for evolution by natural selection to occur. \nAn aspect of reproducers sensu lato that has fascinated some\nis that it does not imply a particular level of reproduction or\nprogeneration, and indeed Szathmáry and Maynard Smith consider\nthat the major transitions of evolution each involve an evolved mode\nof progeneration that is more inclusive or novel than what it evolved\nfrom (Maynard Smith & Szathmáry 1995; Szathmáry\n& Maynard Smith 1997). \nGodfrey-Smith also proposed a taxonomy of reproducers, dividing them\ninto simple, collective and scaffolded (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 87ff).\nSimple reproducers are  \nentities that can reproduce … using their own machinery, in\nconjunction with external sources of energy and raw materials.  \nHe gives an example of a bacterial cell. Collective reproducers  \n… are reproducing entities with parts that themselves have the\ncapacity to reproduce, where the parts do so largely through their own\nresources rather than the coordinated activity as a whole.  \nAnd scaffolded reproducers  \nare entities which get reproduced as part of the reproduction of some\nlarger unit (a simple reproducer), or that are reproduced by some\nother entity.  \nExamples here includes viruses and chromosomes. Godfrey-Smith applies\nthe scaffolded reproducer category to sociocultural evolution. \nThe notion of reproducers has also been applied to speciation and\ncladogenesis (A. Hamilton & Haber 2006). While it may apply to\npopulations, given that taxa do not share the kind of causal unity\nfound in populations and organisms, it is unlikely to apply to species\nor supraspecific taxa, and macroevolution in general. \nThe idea that evolution by natural selection requires the existence of\nreplicators has been a very useful heuristics in evolutionary biology,\nbut also a way of motivating the application of an evolutionary\nthinking beyond the boundaries of evolutionary biology. We started by\nshowing how the notion of gene can be abstracted away from its\nphysical basis and characterized in purely informational terms. We\nthen showed how Dawkins and Hull pursued this abstraction and\nattempted to free the gene from its biological substrate. This\nmotivated responses both from proponents of the replicator concept who\nfurthered the abstraction but also critics. As successful and\ninspiring such an abstraction has been, it should not be reified:\nevolution by natural selection and adaptation can occur even in the\nabsence of replicators. High fidelity certainly facilitates adaptive\nevolution, but this might be because replicators are themselves the\nproduct of evolution rather than necessary for it.","contact.mail":"john@wilkins.id.au","contact.domain":"wilkins.id.au"},{"date.published":"2001-12-05","date.changed":"2018-09-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/replication/","author1":"John S.

It is tied to the concept of the gene and\nits generalization in an evolutionary context [see the entry\n evolution].\n Richard Dawkins introduced the notion of replicators—things\nthat self-replicate—as a universalization of evolutionary\nunderstandings of genes. Dawkins argued that replicators are the\nsine qua non of evolution by natural selection [see the entry\n natural selection],\n while other accounts only require reproduction as one of its\ndefining features. What exactly is a replicator? How are replicators\ndifferent from genes? Can evolution by natural selection occur without\nthe existence of replicators? Besides the biological domain, are there\nany other domains in which replicators have been postulated? To answer\nthese questions, we will first provide some background for\nDawkins’ notion of replicator and its ties with the concepts of\nthe gene and information. We will then introduce the distinction\nbetween Replicators and Vehicles in the context of\nbiological evolution and followed by the extension of this to other\ndomains. Finally, we will discuss some of the challenges to the idea\nthat replicators are necessary conditions for evolution by natural\nselection.\n\nThe notion of replication arose as a concern in the period immediately\nafter the second world war (see\n Figure 1),\n with the rise of information theory, communication theory,\ncybernetics, and Erwin Schrödinger’s 1944 book What is\nLife?. Biologists immediately began to consider the informational\naspect of life, in each of these theoretical frameworks, in areas\nranging from neurology to molecular biology, but especially the latter\n(Brookes 1956; Eigen & de Maeyer 1966; Gatlin 1972; Johnson 1970;\nLinschitz 1953; Margalef 1957 [1958]; Quastler 1953; Rashevsky 1955).\nIt was only after the development of communications theory by Shannon\n(1948) and cybernetics by Wiener (1948) after it, that inheritance in\nbiology took on a specifically informational tint (Griffiths &\nStotz 2007). This is the case in particular of the work of Watson and\nCrick on the double helix structure of DNA (Watson & Crick 1953),\nas well as Crick’s Central Dogma, which states that information\ncannot flow from protein to DNA. The Central Dogma (Crick 1958) was\ninitially cast in terms of structural information (Šustar\n2007),\n Figure 2,\n and later recast by Crick as a more cybernetic or computational kind\nof information (Crick 1970). [See Eugene V. Koonin 2012 & 2015 for\ndiscussion of the nature of the Central Dogma in current biology.] \nFigure 1. Yearly frequency of count for\nthe word ‘replication’ in Google text’s English\ncorpus from 1800–2000 with smoothing = 3. Data obtained from\nGoogle Ngram Viewer (see\n Other Internet Resources). \nStructural information is effectively based on the transfer of\nmolecular primary sequences (linear sequence) in the synthesis of\npolypeptides; that is, it is the literal sequence of basic groups\n(amino acids), before the protein folds into secondary and higher\nconformations. This is a physical and causal account of information:\nthe new molecule has its sequence because it was templated in some way\nby the “information”-imparting molecule (in this case, DNA\nto proteins). Griffiths and Stotz (see below) call this, accordingly,\n“Crick information”. \nHowever, in the late 1950s, after the structure of DNA had become more\nwidely understood, chemist Homer Jacobson proposed a\ncybernetic model of reproduction (Jacobson 1958), going so\nfar as to make a literal model out of train sets and electronic\ncircuits. Later, von Neumann proposed a theory of self-reproducing\nautomata (Neumann 1966) which has become a parallel but influential\nresearch program to the issue in biology (Mitchell 2009). Jacob (1973)\ncemented the logical description of heredity, but the ultimate\nclassical source of the notion that genes are information comes from\nWilliams’ classic 1966 book Adaptation and Natural\nSelection, in which he referred to genes as “cybernetic\nabstractions” (1966: 33). \nThe cybernetic notion of reproduction (and later, replication) rested\non the notion that genes were controllers of phenotypes;\nlater, this came to be identified (e.g., by Gatlin) as synonymous with\nthe “communication” conception of information that Shannon\nproposed. In biology, genes came to be seen as “programs”\nfor phenotypes [‘senders’] that passed themselves on to\nprogeny [‘receivers’], around 1961 (Peluffo 2015). \nWilliams’ book was one inspiration for Dawkins’\nSelfish Gene (1976), and much of what Dawkins proposed about\nreplicators is an extension of Williams’ views, in conjunction\nwith those of William D. Hamilton (1964) and various ethological\nideas. This view is now known as the gene’s eye view (for a\nreview see Okasha 2006, Chapter 5) \nWilliams introduced the notion of a gene as a substrate neutral\nentity: \nI use the term ‘gene’ to mean that which separates and\nrecombines with appreciable frequency, (1966: 20) \nand he further defined an evolutionary gene (that is, one\nthat is selectively important): \n[A] gene could be defined as any hereditary information for which\nthere is a favorable or unfavorable selection bias equal to several or\nmany times its rate of endogenous change. (1966: 25) \nHis answer to the question of what a gene is, is that a gene is\nevolutionary just insofar as it is something heritable that is subject\nto rates of selection that exceed the mutation rate. This is a\ndefinition, not a discovery. If it’s favorably or unfavorably\nselected and heritable, it’s an evolutionary gene. According to\nthis definition, items that are not made of DNA can be classed as\nevolutionary genes so long as they match Williams’ definition\n(Lu & Bourrat 2018). \nFigure 2. The Central Dogma of genetics\nas envisaged by Crick around 1965 (Thieffry & Sarkar 1998). \nThe language of “codes” and “information”\nflows easily enough with respect to replication (see the entry\n biological information).\n Transcription, translation, punctuation, redundancy, synonymy,\nediting, proofreading, errors, repairing of errors, messages, copies,\nand information all sound natural enough. Yet, the literature dealing\nwith information is both extensive and factious. Several different\nformal analyses of information can be found and very little agreement\nabout which analysis is best for which subjects. On one point these\nscholars tend to agree—cybernetic information and\ncommunication-theoretic information will not do for replication in\nbiological contexts. Some argue for semantic information\n(Godfrey-Smith 2000a; Sarkar 2000; Sterelny 2000b). The trouble is\nthat no widely accepted version of semantic information exists. Winnie\n(2000) distinguishes between Classical and Algorithmic Information\nTheory and opts for a revised version of the Algorithmic Theory. But\nonce again, the problem is that no such formal analysis currently\nexists. \nIn the face of all this disagreement and unfinished business,\nbiologists such as Maynard Smith (2000) maintain either that informal\nanalyses of “information” are good enough or that some\nfuture formal version of information theory will justify the sorts of\ninferences that they make. The sense of “information” used\nin the Central Dogma of molecular biology is more like a fit of\ntemplate, or the primary structure of the protein sequence compared to\nthe sequence of the DNA base pairs. Attempts have been made in what is\nnow known as bioinformatics to use Classical Information Theory\n(Shannon’s theory of communication) to extract functional and\nphylogenetic information (Brooks & Wiley 1988; Gatlin 1972;\nMaclaurin 1998; Rodrick Wallace & Wallace 1998), but they appear\nto have been unsuccessful in the main. \nWhile the most likely conclusion is that no version of information\ntheory as currently formulated can handle “information” as\nit functions in biology (Griffiths 2001), attempts have continued to\nbe made to formulate just such a version (Bergstrom & Rosvall\n2011; Sternberg 2008). However, this undercuts the motivation for\nappealing to information theory to elucidate genes in the first\ninstance. Griffiths & Stotz (2013: 153) have argued for\n“Crick” information, which they define as “the\nspecification of the order of amino acids in a polypeptide\nchain”. This specificity definition is more chemical than\nabstract (see the section below on \nDevelopmental Systems Theory). \nThe “informational gene” conception, as James R. Griesemer\n(2005) terms it, is a highly abstract concept of a process and the\nentities that comprise it. This is intentional, as it permits\nDarwinian dynamics to be applied to a range of phenomena, such as\nsociocultural, cybernetic, and medical processes. However, this raises\na metaphysical concern, namely that the view that a gene is nothing\nbut information is a version of Aristotelian hylomorphism (see the\nentry\n form versus matter).\n That is, information is a type of form, which can be used to explain\nphysical processes. Classical hylomorphism was roundly demolished as a\nscientific hypothesis when Daltonian elements were named and\ninvestigated in the nineteenth century. By 1900, terms like\n“substance” (for matter that is propertyless apart from\nmass and extension in space) and “form” had taken on a\nlargely philosophical sense that differed extensively from\nAristotle’s own physical views. Griesemer notes: \nWe know that the informational genes are tied to matter and structure,\nbut if evolutionary theory – to be general enough to cover\ncultural and conceptual change – must be devoid of all reference\nto concrete mechanism, it cannot follow from the theory, for example,\nthat genes are inside organisms or are even parts of organisms, as\nDawkins’s language suggests. Strictly, only the correlations\nbetween replicator and vehicle due to causal connections of a\ncompletely unspecified sort can be implied by such a theory. Striving\nto get matter and specific structure out of the theory in order to\nmake it apply to immaterial realms may thus leave it bankrupt as an\naccount of causal connection for the material, biological cases.\n(Griesemer 2005: 79) \nAnd yet, this kind of hylomorphism has remained, even in science.\nBiologists have argued that form determined many properties of\norganisms in ways that could not be reduced to the actions of their\nparts, and this kind of thinking remained and was co-opted by the\nmolecular biologists and geneticists. Thus, we get the Central Dogma\nof molecular biology: \nThe Central Dogma\n\nThis states that once ‘information’ has passed into\nprotein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer\nof information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid\nto protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or\nfrom protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the\nprecise determination of sequence, either of bases in the\nnucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. (Crick\n1958) \nRead physically, this means only that the structure of the DNA\nmolecule is not reproduced from the structure of proteins, a perfectly\nreasonable account of the molecular processes. But because Crick used\nthe word “information”, some scientists, including\nDawkins, took this to mean genes are informational entities, that\n“code” for organismic traits from the molecular level up\nto the entire organism and even beyond. This is striking in a purple\npassage of The Blind Watchmaker, where Dawkins describe genes\nthe following way \nIt is raining DNA outside. [downy seeds from willow trees] …\nThe cotton wool is mostly made of cellulose, and it dwarfs the tiny\ncapsule that contains the DNA, the genetic information. The DNA\ncontent must be a small proportion of the total, so why did I say that\nit was raining DNA rather than cellulose? The answer is that it is the\nDNA that matters… whose coded characters spell out specific\ninstructions for building willow trees… It is raining\ninstructions out there, it’s raining programs; it’s\nraining tree-growing, fluff spreading, algorithms. That is not a\nmetaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if\nit were raining floppy disks. (1986: 111) \nSo we now turn to Dawkins’ view of genes as replicators, and the\nway in which he takes information to be cybernetic and physical at the\nsame time. \nRichard Dawkins introduced the distinction between replicators and\nvehicles in his The Selfish Gene (1976). For his purposes\nDawkins found the contrast between genes and organisms too restrictive\nand specific. Everyone agrees that genes are replicators, but genes\nmay not be the only replicators. Dawkins also argued that perhaps more\ninclusive entities than single genes might also function as\nreplicators. At the very least, the possibility should not be ignored.\nSo, Dawkins adopted “replicator” as a more inclusive and\ngeneral term than “gene”. In The Extended\nPhenotype he defined a replicator as “anything in the\nuniverse of which copies are made” (Dawkins 1982b: 83). He also\nintroduced the term “vehicle” for those entities produced\nby replicators that help these replicators increase in numbers by\ninteracting effectively with their environments. This distinction can\nbe expressed in terms of either entities or processes. According to\nDawkins, replicators function in replication, while vehicles function\nin environmental interaction. \nA long-standing dispute in evolutionary biology concerns the levels at\nwhich selection can occur (Bourrat 2015c, 2015b, 2016; Brandon 1996;\nKerr & Godfrey-Smith 2002; Keller 1999; Lloyd 1988; Okasha 2006,\n2016; Sober & Wilson 1998; Williams 1966) [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n Some authors see this dispute as concerning the levels at which\nreplication can take place. Other authors take the levels of selection\ndispute to concern environmental interaction and insist that\nenvironmental interaction can take place at a variety of levels, from\nsingle genes, cells and organisms to colonies, demes and possibly\nentire species. Organisms certainly interact with their environments\nin ways that bias the transmission of their genes, but then so do\nentities that are both less inclusive than entire organisms (e.g.,\nsperm cells) and more inclusive (e.g., beehives). \nDawkins argued that replication in biological evolution\noccurs exclusively at the level of the genetic material. The term\n“replication” refers first and foremost to copying, and\ngenes are the self-replicating molecules of biology. Some critics\n(e.g., Lewontin 1991: 48) interpreted this to mean that a strand of\nDNA placed on a glass slide might start replicating all on its own. Of\ncourse, no biologist has ever held such view. Genes do replicate\nthemselves, but only with the aid of highly complicated molecular\nmachinery. Too often, however, the importance of this machinery has\ngone unnoticed. To be sure, when we make copies on a photocopier, we\nare interested in the texts, figures or just scrawls that appear on\nthese sheets of paper. We are not interested in how the photocopier\nworks, even if it does all the work. \nIn Dawkins’ early writings, replicators and vehicles played\ndifferent but complementary and equally important roles in selection,\nbut as he honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became\nless and less fundamental. Initially, Dawkins was content to dethrone\nthe organism from its pride of place in biology. It is an important\nfocus of environmental interaction, but other entities, both below and\nabove the organismic level, can also function as vehicles. In later\nwritings, however, Dawkins went even further to argue that phenotypic\ntraits are what really matter for evolution by natural selection to\noccur, and that they can be treated independently of their being\norganized into vehicles. More than that, features such as spider webs\nshould be viewed as part of a spider’s phenotype. Hence, Dawkins\ntitled his second book The Extended Phenotype (Dawkins\n1982b). \nDawkins never lost his fascination with vehicular adaptations, a\nfascination that his critics denigrate as Panglossian adaptationism.\nHe filled his books with adaptationist scenarios, some more firmly\nsupported by data than others, but from the perspective of the\nstructure of evolutionary theory, he held that replicators are much\nmore important than vehicles. For example, Dawkins argued at some\nlength that adaptations are always for the good of replicators, not\nvehicles (Lloyd 1992), see entry on\n units and levels of selection.\n Vehicles exhibit these adaptations, but ultimately all\nadaptations must be explicable in terms of changes in gene\nfrequencies. Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins (1994: 617)\nproclaims that he “coined the term ‘vehicle’ not to\npraise it but to bury it”. As prevalent as organisms might be,\nas definite as the causal roles that they play in selection are,\nreference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous\ncharacterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Although\nDawkins is far from a genetic determinist, he is certainly a\ngenetic reductionist. Whether reductionism itself is good or\nbad is a moot question (Sarkar 1998). \nAccording to Dawkins, replicators have three basic\nproperties—longevity, fecundity and\ncopy-fidelity. Longevity means longevity of the gene\ntype in the form of copies through descent (Dawkins 1982b:\n84; Hull 1980), although the stability of gene tokens is\nincluded in the definition in The Selfish Gene (1976: 18). No\ngene as a physical body lasts all that long. In mitosis, a gene loses\nhalf of its substance at each replication. What endures, he says, is\nnot the entity itself but the information incorporated in its\nstructure. It is this information that is copied with such high\nfidelity. Mutations do occur, but at very low frequencies. Even so, in\nsome organisms mutation rates must be too high because mechanisms have\nevolved that search out and repair such errors. The genotype is\ntherefore an informational notion; information is equivalent to\nAristotelian form. The type is the form of the tokens, in\nDawkins’ view. \nOne source of variation in genes of sexual organisms supplementing\nmutation is crossover. Pairs of homologous chromosomes line up next to\neach other at meiosis, crossover and recombine. For stretches of DNA\nin which different alleles exist, the result can be a change in\ninformation. Quite obviously, the shorter the stretch of DNA involved,\nthe less likely that crossover will occur and the message changed.\nDawkins appeals to such dismantling of entities to argue against\norganisms functioning as replicators. In sexual organisms, organisms\nthemselves are torn apart and repeatedly assembled each generation\n(Caporael 2003). If long stretches of DNA lack the necessary identity\nby descent to function as replicators, then sexual organisms certainly\nlack it. However, some other explanation has to be provided for\nasexual organisms because they pass on their overall structure largely\nunchanged from generation to generation. For example, R. A. Fisher, in\nhis The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (Fisher 1930)\nconsidered the entire genetic complement of asexual organisms to be a\nsingle gene, and this view has been repeated from time to time since.\nAccording to Dawkins, genes, and only genes, can function as\nreplicators in biological evolution. How large these genetic units are\ndepends on such things as the prevalence of sex, the frequency of\ncrossover or lateral gene transfers, and the intensity of\nselection. \nIf there were sex but no crossing-over, each chromosome would be a\nreplicator, and we should speak of adaptations as being for the good\nof the chromosome. If there is no sex we can, by the same token, treat\nthe entire genome of an asexual organism as a replicator. But the\norganism itself is not a replicator. (Dawkins 1982a: 95) \nDawkins offered two reasons for organisms not being able to function\nas replicators. The first is the one he uses to delineate evolutionary\ngenes. As is the case for long stretches of DNA, organisms are too\neasily and frequently broken up to be considered units of replication.\nA second reason is that they cannot pass on changes in their\nstructure, although some phenotypic change may result in generational\nchange. In fact, some epigenetic mechanisms have been shown\nto be passed on across generations (Jablonka & Raz 2009; see the\nentry on\n inheritance systems).\n The amount of DNA that counts as a replicator certainly varies, but\naccording to Dawkins, nothing more inclusive than the genetic material\nfunctions as replicators in biological evolution. \nIn The Selfish Gene, although Dawkins wanted his definition\nof gene to be close to that of Williams’ (1966)\n“evolutionary gene”, it isn’t quite: \nA gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material which\npotentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural\nselection. (Dawkins 1976: 30) \nWhere Williams’ definition is substrate neutral, Dawkins’\nis explicitly chromosomal and DNA-based. Where William’s\n“gene” refers to any entity, which is the reason\nwhy it is an informational notion, Dawkins’ gene, by contrast,\nis tied to DNA; a view later heavily criticized by Stent (1977), an\ninfluential molecular biologist at the time. \nOn Dawkins’ account, the limits of genes need not be absolutely\nsharp. Nor must all genes be of the same length. The greater the\nselection pressure, the smaller the gene. At the most fundamental\nlevel, selection takes place between alternative alleles residing at\nthe same locus. \nAs far as a gene is concerned, its alleles are its deadly rivals, but\nother genes are just a part of its environment, comparable to\ntemperature, food, and predators, or companions. (Dawkins 1976:\n40) \nAlleles cannot cooperate with each other; only compete. That is where\nthe “selfish” in “selfish gene” comes in.\nAccording to Dawkins (1976: 95), the selfish gene is not just one\nphysical bit of DNA. It is “all replicas of a particular bit of\nDNA, distributed throughout the world” (for a recent defense of\na similar approach, see Haig 2012). Hence, genes do not form classes\nof spatiotemporally unrelated individuals but trees. They must be\nreplicas. But being a replica is not enough. The linear repetition of\nthe “same gene” in the form of several hundred copies is\nquite common. These replicas, however, do not reside at the same\nlocus. Although identical in structure, these genes do not\ncompete with each other in the way that alleles at the same locus can.\nIn the simplest and most basic sense, alleles compete with alternative\nalleles at the same locus. Any other sorts of competition and\ncooperation are merely extrapolations from this fundamental sense of\nallelic competition. Even though genes may cooperate with each other\nin very complicated ways in embryological development, in replication\nthey can be treated as “separate and distinct”. In\ndevelopment the effects of genes blend. In replication replicators do\nnot blend. \nDawkins introduced the general notions of replicator and vehicle so\nthat selection need not be limited exclusively to gene-based\nbiological evolution. However, as the preceding discussion indicates,\nhis later revisions to his general theoretical outlook were influenced\nstrongly by the traditional perspective of genes and organisms. Genes\ncontain the information necessary to produce organisms and their\nadaptations. Genes “ride around” in and\n“guide” organisms. As Dawkins describes them, vehicles are\nrelatively discrete entities that “house” replicators and\nwhich can be regarded as machines programmed to preserve and propagate\nthe replicators that ride inside them. Although these terms may be\nappropriate for the relations between genes and organisms, they\ninterfere with a more general analysis of replication and selection.\nWhat really matters in selection is that entities at various levels of\norganization interact with their environments in such a way that the\nrelevant replicators increase in relative frequency. The actual causal\nchain that connects replicators and vehicles need not be limited to\ndevelopment. \nFor example, Dawkins argues at some length that genes and only genes\ncan function as replicators in biological evolution. He adds that\n“all adaptations are for the preservation of DNA; DNA itself\njust is” (Dawkins 1982a: 45). But DNA itself exhibits\nadaptations. Anyone who has spent much time examining the molecular\nstructure of DNA soon realizes that it is adapted to replicate. In\naddition, the proliferation of junk DNA, transposons, and meiotic\ndrive are three examples in which the only phenotypes that matter are\nphenotypic characteristics of genes (Brandon 1996; Sterelny 1996:\n388). Dawkins’ characterizations of replicators, vehicles and\nthe relations between the two are too closely tied to genes, organisms\nand development. DNA can certainly replicate itself, but it can also\nfunction as a “vehicle” even though it cannot code for,\nride around in or direct itself. In sum, a more general\ncharacterization of selection is needed, a characterization that does\nnot assume that the only causal connection between replicators and\nvehicles is development from embryo to maturity. Such a generalization\nwas offered by Hull (1980, 1981, 1988) who proposed that the relevant\nnotion is “interactor” rather than “vehicle”,\nas interactors are causal and active while vehicles are passive\nentities. \nAlthough Dawkins finds it desirable to replace genes with replicators\nin his general characterization of the evolutionary process, he says\nvery little about this more general notion in his The Selfish\nGene. Only one chapter (11) is dedicated to “memetic”\nevolution. Instead, as we saw, he discusses the special case of genes\nas replicators. The primacy of the genetic perspective in the\ncharacterization of replicators is claimed by some (Griesemer 2000b)\nto be one of the chief weaknesses not only in Dawkins’\ndiscussions but also in the work of his successors [see the\nsection below on\n Reproducers]. Hull\nand his colleagues (Hull, Langman, & Glenn 2001) claim to be\nproviding a general notion of replication, adequate to handle all\ndifferent sorts of replication, when too often we are simply reading\npeculiarities of genetic replication into our general analysis of\nreplication. \nDoes replication play the same role in other sorts of selection that\nit plays in gene-based biological evolution? The reaction of the\nimmune system to antigens is closest to the standard biological\nexample of replication and selection (Hull et al. 2001). Certainly immune systems arose through the same process as other\nfunctional systems. The basic structure of the human immune system is\n“built into our genes”, and the only genes that count in\nevolution are the ones that we received from our ancestors and can\nsubsequently pass on to our progeny. In Dawkins’ (1982b: 83)\nterminology, the genes that code for our immune system are active,\ngerm-line replicators. They are active because they influence their\nprobability to be copied; they are germ-line, because they can\npotentially have an infinity of descendants. \nHowever, the genes that function in the reaction of the immune system\nto antigens have two peculiarities. First, they incorporate mechanisms\ndesigned to produce very high frequencies of mutation, and second,\nnone of the genes involved in the functioning of the immune system are\ngerm-line. The genes that give rise to B-cells for instance are\ndesigned to mutate extensively until one of these cells identifies an\ninvader as foreign. It then proliferates extensively as it attacks the\ninvader. As an organism matures, it accumulates more and more of the\nB-cells that have been successful in its past. More than this, as the\nprocess of proliferation continues, the strength of the affinities to\nbinding sites increases. Initially the primary antibodies almost\nalways exhibit a weak affinity for their targets, but as the reaction\nto the antigen continues, these affinities become stronger. \nWithin the confines of a single organism, the reaction of the immune\nsystem to antigens has all the characteristics of selection processes,\nbut when the organism dies all of these adaptations are lost. In some\nspecies, females pass on not only the genes for the basic structure of\ntheir immune systems but also some of the machinery that past\ninvasions of antigens have produced in her. However, these cells are\nrapidly removed from the offspring as it develops its own immune\nsystem. The reaction of the immune system to antigens departs from\ngene-based selection in biological evolution in two ways. First, from\nthe organismal perspective, the genes that function in protecting an\norganism from invaders are not germ-line. They are somatic. Second,\nthe relevant mutation rates are much, much higher in the immune system\nthan in ordinary gene-based selection. Instead of mechanisms existing\nto discover mutations and repair them, mechanisms exist that encourage\nmutations—massively so. If the functioning of the immune system\nis to count as an adaptive process, then some changes must be made.\nOne possibility is to clarify what counts as a “germ-line”\nreplicator and a rejection of the notion that extremely low mutation\nrates are inherent in all selection processes [see\nthe section below on\n Challenges to the Replicator]. \nThe temptation to regard cultures and societies as evolving entities\nin a way analogous to organism has a long tradition. In The\nSelfish Gene (Chapter 11), Dawkins proposes a version of it that\nmakes use of the concept of the replicator. He chose the word\n“meme” for a sociocultural replicator because of its\nsimilarities with the word gene: \nWe need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of\na unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.\n‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a\nmonosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’ (Dawkins 1976:\n192). \nThe basic idea, underlying Dawkins’ proposal is that since\nevolution by natural selection in the biological domain requires\nreplication, it must also be the case in the sociocultural domain, and\nthat imitation, at least in many cases, is the way through which\nsociocultural entities, the memes, replicate. \nImportant differences exist between sociocultural evolution and\nbiological evolution (Claidière & André 2012) [see\nthe entry on\n cultural evolution].\n For example, Dawkins (1976) admits that he is on shaky ground when it\ncomes to the high-fidelity copying required of replicators. Memes seem\nto get changed much more frequently than genes (see Sterelny (2006)\nfor a review). In general, however, it is fair to say that the\nstandards used to evaluate sociocultural transmission are not on par\nwith those used to evaluate biological transmission. An overly\nidealized view of Mendelian genetics is contrasted to a much more\nrealistic view of cultural change. So the criticism goes, one problem\nwith memes is that they do not have discrete boundaries, do not all\ncome in the same size, and in their functioning are strongly\ninfluenced by their environments. Genes, so the critics claim, have\nsharp boundaries, are all of the same size, and are immune to\nenvironmental influences. If sociocultural evolution is to be\nevaluated fairly, the same level of criticism must be applied to all\nputative examples of selection from gene-based selection in biological\nevolution and the reaction of the immune system to antigens to the\ndevelopment of the central nervous system and social learning (Hull et\nal. 2001). The collection of articles in Aunger (2000) present the\narguments pro- and against a memetic approach to culture and a more\nrecent discussion is available in Lewens (2015). \nDawkins (1976) also places considerable emphasis on human brains as\nthe “vehicles” for memetic evolution. He defines\n“meme” as an entity capable of being transmitted from one\nbrain to another. Computers are also plausible vehicles for memes, as\nwell as artifacts more generally which can ‘store’ and\nthen release information when a copy of the artifact is made by\nemulation (mimesis), that is without the presence of a\ndemonstration. Dawkins’ discussion of memes is, however, marred\nby the pervasiveness of the gene-organism perspective. For example, he\ndefines “replicator” in terms of transmission of\ninformation—memes leaping from brain to brain or from brains to\ncomputers and back again. But memes do not leap from brain to brain or\nfrom computer to computer. Their content is transmitted in a variety\nof ways, including books, audiotapes, conversations and the like. As\nmuch as the physical basis changes, the message remains sufficiently\nunchanged. All instances of this message are equally memes, not just\nthe ones residing in human brains and computers. \nSeveral accounts of memetic replication have been proposed in the\nliterature. Some consider that there is no replication in cultural\nevolution, but that memes are “attractor points” in\nculture (Atran 1998). Others consider that the interactor is the meme\nitself (Blackmore 1999) or that the meme is the selected cultural\nheritable information just as Williams’ “evolutionary\ngene” is the selected genetic heritable information, and the\nmemetic interactor is the repertoire of behaviors it elicits (Wilkins\n1998). One view that has been offered several times is that memes are\nactive neural structures (Aunger 1998, 2002; Delius 1991). \nAll the objections to the gene-meme analogy to one side, Dawkins\n(1976: 211) finds the chief difference between genetic and memetic\nchange is that biological evolution is at bottom a war between alleles\nresiding at the same locus. “Memes seem to have nothing\nequivalent to chromosomes and nothing equivalent to alleles”.\nFirst, the usual depiction of alleles residing at the same locus on\nhomologous chromosomes so central to Mendelian genetics is an\noversimplification, but more importantly, for at least half of the\nhistory of life on earth, replication and selection took place in the\nabsence of chromosomes, meiosis and the like. If gene-based biological\nevolution took place for so long in the absence of the Mendelian\napparatus and still does so in many extant organisms, then demanding\nthat memetic evolution proceed by this very special and possibly\naberrant sort of inheritance seems too strong. The cost of meiosis\nremains a serious problem in ordinary biological evolution. Demanding\nthat cultural evolution incorporates this same highly problematic\nelement in its own makeup seems strange in the extreme. If we are to\ndevelop a general analysis of selection, then we must distinguish\nbetween essential and contingent features of this process.. \nNumerous evolutionary biologists question how fundamental to selection\nthe perspective of alleles at a locus actually is. Almost everyone\nagrees that evolution involves changes in gene frequencies. However,\nfew go on to add that evolution is nothing but changes in\ngene frequencies. When one looks at evolutionary biology, one\ndiscovers that it involves much more than changes in gene frequencies.\nTo be successful, memetic evolution must be fleshed out. \nIn 2000, Aunger summarized the disputes between proponents and\nskeptics of the memetic approach, as revolving around three\nlevels: \nNearly 20 years after the diagnosis, it seems however that the memetic\napproach has, by and large, been abandoned, with some of its insights\nincorporated into other evolutionary approaches to culture. Perhaps\nthe most successful is dual-inheritance theory (Richerson & Boyd\n2008), also known as gene-culture coevolution. A very general\ncharacterization of the sociocultural evolution has been attempted by\nEl Mouden, André, Morin, & Nettle (2014). This approach\nwhich relies on the most abstract formalism used by evolutionary\ntheorists, namely the Price equation (for an introduction to the Price\nequation see Okasha 2006: Chap. 1), highlights some of the differences\nbetween biological and sociocultural evolution, and why a pure memetic\napproach seems difficult to implement as a general framework. \nSome of Dawkins’ critics think that genes play too important of\na role in his notion of replication. Replication, so they argue, can\noccur at other levels of organization as well. Just as Dawkins\nextended the notion of the phenotype, these authors propose to make\nthe notion of replicators more general as well—to extend the\nreplicator so to speak. Dawkins introduced his Extended\nPhenotype conception for two reasons. First, he wanted to extend\nthe notion of a “phenotypic trait”. The sort of nest that\na bird builds or the song that it sings can count as phenotypic traits\njust as much as the shape of its bill. Second, as mentioned earlier,\nDawkins wanted to break the hold that organisms have over how we\nconceptualize the living world. Traits do tend to come bundled into\nreasonably discrete entities, but for making inferences about the\nevolutionary process, traits can be treated as separate and distinct.\nHowever, as he proceeded, Dawkins eventually decided that extending\nthe phenotype was not enough. He had to bury it. All sorts of\nfascinating mechanisms to one side, what really matters in selection\ntakes place at the level of replicators. \nAlthough such critics of Dawkins as Sterelny, Smith, & Dickison\n(1996) declined to join with Dawkins in his demotion of environmental\ninteraction, they did agree with him that replicators are special.\nThey play a special role in development. However, they do not limit\nreplicators to genes even in biological evolution. Sterelny et al.\npropose to extend the replicator to include nonstandard entities:\n“the set of developmental resources that are adapted from the\ntransmission of similarity across the generations” (Sterelny\n2001: 338). For example, the sort of burrow that a particular organism\ndigs is influenced by its genetic makeup, but if these burrows are\nused over and over again, characteristics of these burrows can\nthemselves be viewed as replicators. The effects of these burrows get\npassed on from generation to generation, but not via the DNA. \nAs more and more non-DNA replicators, including epigenetic\ninheritance, are acknowledged, Dawkins’ view began to grade into\nthe conception of the Extended Replicator, which Sterelny et al.\n(1996) specify as any non-genetic as well as genetic replicators where\n‘genetic’ refers to DNA. These two views are so general\nthat any case that can be described in one can be redescribed in the\nother. Differences lie in ease of description. According to Sterelny\net al. (1996), the burrows that some organisms dig can function as\nreplicators—extended replicators—while Dawkins portrays\nthem as instances of extended phenotypes. The contrast is between\nselfish burrows and selfish genes for burrowing. \nIn the version of replication formulated by Sterelny et al. (1996)\nboth copying and biofunction are crucial. Copying is quite obviously a\ncausal phenomenon, but not any old causal connection will do.\nSimilarity of copies is necessary, but not sufficient. These copies\nmust be copies of copies. One copy must produce another copy and that\ncopy produce still another copy and so on. For one entity to be a copy\nof another, it must be the output of a process whose biofunction is to\nconserve function. The function of copying is to produce from one\ntoken another token which is similar in the relevant respects. Genes\nfit this definition, but so do lots of examples of non-genetic\ntransmission; e.g., habitat stability resulting from nest site\nimprinting, the song that a bird learns, various microorganism\nsymbionts, not to mention sociocultural transmission. \nIn the wake of Oyama’s The Ontogeny of Information\n(1985, 2000) and other work, notably that of Daniel Lehrman (1953)\nand Patrick Bateson (2001), a view of biological evolution has arisen\nthat emphasizes development (see also Griffiths & Gray 1994a). In\nthe nineteenth century development was an extremely active research\nprogram. The next great discoveries in biology were going to be in the\narea of development. It was not to be. First Mendelian genetics and\nthen a version of evolutionary theory centered on population genetics\ntook over biology, and they did so while avoiding development.\nEveryone knew that development was central to both evolution and\nreproduction, but no one could see how to integrate the masses of\ndevelopmental data available into the emerging synthesis of\nevolutionary biology and genetics. As a result, development was left\nout of the Modern Synthesis (Beurton, Falk, & Rheinberger 2000;\nGilbert 1991). Considering how central development actually is in\nmetazoan and metaphyte biology, the advances made while ignoring it\nare staggering. \nEven so, developmental biology continued on its course until at long\nlast we seem to understand development well enough to begin\nintegrating it into the rest of biology. On the most conservative\nview, current versions of evolutionary theory can remain largely\nunchanged as development is grafted onto them. On a second view, both\nperspectives are likely to require some modification to bring off this\nintegration. Our understanding of development may have to be modified,\nbut so too for evolutionary theory (Pigliucci & Müller 2010).\nFinally, at the other extreme, development will all but replace\nevolutionary theory. In their more exuberant moments, some advocates\nof Developmental Systems Theory (hereafter DST) seem to be claiming\njust that. Just as some molecular biologists think that molecular\nbiology is rapidly replacing all the rest of biology, some advocates\nof DST argue that developmental theories will simply replace current\nversions of evolutionary theory. \nOn some versions of the DST view, genes have no uniquely privileged\nrole in repeated cycles of development (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths\n& Gray 1994b). In fact, no element of the developmental matrix\nplays any privileged causal role—not genes, not organisms, not\nthe environment, not anything. Everything counts as a resource, albeit\nin particular situations certain resources will play more important\nroles than other resources. In rejecting any privileged role for\ngenes, advocates of DST are especially skeptical of one particular\nrole supposedly played by genes—the transmission of information.\nAccording to some, information is central to developmentalism, but\ngenes are not the only mechanisms for information transfer. According\nto others, information plays no role in the emerging developmentalist\nperspective. The developmental system as a whole is the unit of\nselection [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n If genes have no special role and whole developmental cycles are\nreplicators, as some developmental- systems theorists argue, the\ndistinction between replicator and interactor becomes blurred. \nIn the continuing debate over developmental versus traditional\ntheories of evolutionary biology, Sterelny et al. (1996) hold a fairly\nconservative position. They agree with the developmentalists that\ngenes play no privileged role in the development of phenotypes from\ngenotypes. Genes do play a role in this process, only simply not a\nprivileged role. Genes can serve as a causal bridge from\nphenotype to phenotype, but other entities can do so as well. Genes\nare not the only replicators in biological evolution. The repeated\ncycles in inheritance include many different sorts of constancies and\nrepetitions—genes, cellular machinery, phenotypic traits\nincluding behaviors, and social structures. Information remains\ncentral to selection processes, but genes are not the only carriers of\nsuch information. Genes predict phenotypic characters only in the same\nsense that environmental factors predict them. Sterelny (2000a) has\nargued that developmental considerations require no fundamental\nreevaluation of evolutionary conceptions along the lines of DST. \nGodfrey-Smith (2009; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b; Griesemer 2005)\ncontrasts the replicator/interactor approach to natural selection with\na more classical approach. This latter approach is usually given as a\n“recipe” for evolution by natural selection to use\nGodfrey-Smith’s terminology (see also Brandon 1990: 3.1). Ever\nsince Darwin, a number of authors have proposed that for evolution by\nnatural selection to occur three conditions or ingredients are\nnecessary. A population should exhibit (1) variation, that (2) leads\nto differences in fitness between the entities forming the population\n[see the entry on\n fitness],\n (3) which are heritable (reviewed in Godfrey-Smith 2007). The most\nfamous version of these recipes is the one provided by Lewontin\n1970. \nThere is a difference in emphasis between the two approaches in that\nthe replicator/interactor approach focuses on the entities\nforming the population, while the classical approach provides a\npopulation description of evolutionary change. Another difference\nbetween the two approaches, is that under the classical approach\nreplication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur. In fact, as long as heritability is positive, and the two other\nconditions are satisfied, then evolution by natural selection can\noccur (but will not necessarily do so, cf. Godfrey-Smith 2009: 25). An\nabstract definition of heritability (\\(h^2\\))—although by no\nmeans fully general (see Bourrat 2015a)—is that it represents\nthe slope of the regression of average offspring character on parent\nor mid-parent (in case of sexual species) character (see the entry on\n Heritability).\n Given a positive heritability does not entail replication of\ncharacter between parent and offspring, but is rather a special case,\nin which heritability would be exactly 1 in the absence of\nenvironmental variation, the replicator/interactor perspective is\nsubsumed by the classical approach. Godfrey-Smith concurs: \nFrom this point of view, we can see the replicator analysis as picking\nout a special case of what is covered (or supposed to be covered) by\nthe classical view. (2009: 36; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b) \nTo see why a lack of replication does not prevent evolution by natural\nselection from occurring, suppose a population of entities exists with\ndifferent sizes, as presented in\n Figure 3(a),\n in which there is selection for larger entities. We assume that the\nentities reproduce asexually in discrete generations and that there is\nno environmental variation. At the parental generation, there are two\ntypes of individuals, with respective sizes of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and 1.\nBecause of the selection for size, entities of size \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\nproduce 3 offspring while entities of size 1 produce 4 offspring.\nSuppose now that there is a positive heritability, as defined above,\nso that, on average, offspring resemble more their parent than they\nresemble other entities of the parental generation, as is displayed on\n Figure 3(a),\n but only slightly so (\\(h^2 = 0.2\\)). After one generation,\nalthough there is no high-fidelity replication, the average size of\nthe population has changed, due to the effect of natural\nselection. This simple example demonstrates quite straightforwardly\nthat replication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur. \nWe said earlier that replication would imply a heritability of exactly\n1 in the absence of environmental variation. Although this is correct,\nthe reverse is not true. In fact, take again a similar population as\nin\n Figure 3(a),\n but this time assume a different pattern of inheritance for the two\ntypes of entities as displayed in\n Figure 3(b).\n With this pattern of inheritance, although there is no replication,\nentities, on average, have the exact same character as their parent.\nIn the case of the entities of size \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), some\noffspring have the exact same character as their parent, but that is\nnot required either, as is the case with the entities of size 1, of\nwhich none of the offspring has the same character as their\nparent. \nOne possible response against regarding the classical approach to\nevolution by natural selection as unconditionally superior to the\nreplicator/interactor approach, is to argue that although evolution by\nnatural selection can occur without replication, when this happens,\nthe evolutionary change resulting is not a pure case of\nevolution by natural selection. Rather, it is evolution by natural\nselection mixed with some other evolutionary processes. A rationale\nfor this claim is that the fact offspring do not resemble their parent\nintroduces some variation in the population of which the origin is not\nnatural selection. In abstract terms, the introduction of variation\ncan be regarded as a form mutation. \nUnder this interpretation, the classical approach on the one hand, and\nthe replicator/interactor approach, on the other hand, just emphasize\ndifferent aspects of evolutionary explanations. The classical approach\ngives us evolutionary explanations in the context of other\nevolutionary processes occurring, while the replicator/interactor\napproach gives us evolutionary explanations of what the effect of\nnatural selection would be in the absence of any other evolutionary\nprocess acting in the population, that is, in its pure form.\nUnderstood that way, the two approaches do not necessarily need to be\nopposed. \nAnother challenge to the replicator/interactor approach to evolution\nby natural selection is to see replicators themselves as a\nproduct of natural selection rather than as a necessary\nstarting point. One premise of this argument is that some form of\nnatural selection must have occurred on entities that initially were\nnot replicating, perhaps not even reproducing. This is recognized by\nDawkins, who notes in passing in the second chapter of the Selfish\nGene that “Darwin’s ‘survival of the\nfittest’ is really a special case of a more general law of\nsurvival of the stable” (Dawkins 1976: 13) and that life\noriginated from selection of molecules for stability. The idea that\nevolution by natural selection can occur without reproduction has been\nargued by Bouchard (2008, 2011; see also Doolittle 2014, Bourrat\n2014). \n(a) Population in which there is no replication and a low\nheritability (\\(h^2\\)), yet, evolution by natural selection occurs. \n(b) Population in which there is no replication, yet heritability \nis 1. Evolution by natural selection occurs. \nFigure 3. Illustration of the idea that\nevolution by natural selection can occur without replication. \nThe idea that selection can occur without there being replicators was\nfirst introduced as “chemical selection” in line with the\nviews of Oparin, who proposed that coascervates (colloidal droplets)\ncould encapsulate protobiological chemicals and self-replicate without\ngenes through mechanical fission, a view also independently proposed\nby Haldane (Oparin 1936 [1938], Haldane 1929; see Kolb 2016). This was\nlater extended by the work of Sidney Fox, who showed that proteinoid\nspheres could mechanically reproduce stably (Hsu & Fox 1976). \nIf modern biological systems evolved from molecules that did not have\nthe ability to reproduce, let alone replicate, one might ask, what is\nthe simplest case of evolution by natural selection? It is a case in\nwhich different types of entities have different persistences but do\nnot produce any offspring. In this model, the types with the property\nof persisting longer represent an increasing frequency of the total\npopulation over time. One problem though in a model of persistence\nalone, is that each time one entity goes out of existence, it is not\nreplaced by another entity, so that over time the population size\ntends towards zero. Although this does not mean that evolution by\nnatural selection cannot occur in such populations, this poses\nimportant constraints on the evolutionary dynamics of this population.\nFurthermore, it is possible to regard the ability for a population to\nmaintain its size or increase its size as a primordial form of\nadaptation. To see this one can imagine different populations of\nentities at different locations, some with the ability to produce some\nentities or multiply, others without. It is clear that the populations\nwith the ability to maintain or increase their size would out-compete\nthose that are unable to do so. The ability for a population to\nsustain its population size might thus be regarded as a primordial\nform of adaptation. \nA next ‘stage’ in the evolution from primordial entities\nunable to reproduce to modern biological systems might thus have been\nfor entities to produce new offspring entities (or multiply) without\nthe ability to pass on their properties reliably. In such a situation\nthe size of a population could be maintained. The most extreme form of\nthat would be to imagine a population of two types in which each type\nhas the same probability to produce an offspring of the other types\nthan its own type. With entities of the two types having different\npersistence, a modest form of evolution by natural selection is still\npossible. Versions of this model have been proposed by Wilkins,\nStanyon, & Musgrave (2012), Earnshaw-Whyte (2012) and Bourrat\n(2014). Since there is, on average, no more resemblance between an\noffspring with its parent than any other entity of the parental\ngeneration, and evolution by natural selection is still observed in\nsuch a scenario, one might think that heritability is, strictly\nspeaking not a necessary condition for evolution by natural\nselection. \nWilkins et al. (2012) argue that over time in a reactor with limited\nincoming chemical species, hypercycles (as defined by Eigen,\nBiebricher, Gebinoga, & Gardiner 1991) of reactions will tend to\ninclude reaction types that are more stable and capture more source\nmolecules and energy than variant reaction types, leading to the\nevolution by natural selection of replicator-like molecules as well as\nenergetically efficient “metabolic” molecules. Recent work\nin biochemistry has added strength to that suggestion (Altstein 2015).\nHence, given that no replicator is required for selection (in this\ncase, chemical), replicator molecules can be seen as the\noutcome of selective evolution, not a necessary prior\ncondition for it. In effect, the evolution of replicators is the first\nmajor transition of evolution, despite the view of Szathmáry\nand Maynard Smith that replicators needed to come first (Maynard Smith\n& Szathmáry 1995; Szathmáry & Maynard Smith\n1997). Bourrat (2014), further developed this idea into a series of\nagent-based models. He showed that replication is an attractor in\npopulations lacking heritability once small random mutations\nincreasing or decreasing the fidelity of character inheritance is\nintroduced. \nThe works on the origins of replicators ties in with the notion of the\nreproducer proposed by Griesemer (2000a,b, 2002, 2005;\nWimsatt & Griesemer 2007), although it was published first, based\non a circulated manuscript by Griesemer, by Szathmáry and\nMaynard Smith (1997). A reproducer is an entity that develops and has\na material overlap between the “parent” and\n“progeny”. This causal relationship between parents and\nprogeny is called “progeneration”, the “increase in\nnumerically distinct objects of a given kind”. Reproduction is a\ncomposite process of development and progeneration, leading to objects\nthat are themselves capable of development and progeneration. Thus,\nthe reproducer concept extends the notion of a developmental\nsystem. \nHere inheritance is a system property, not a property of\nparts, unless they are also reproducing systems, and is\ndevelopmentally acquired. Organisms do not arise already capable of\nreproduction in the main, but must undergo orderly transitions before\nthey may reproduce. \nThe relation between reproducers, and replicators and interactors,\nvaries according to author. Griesemer treats replication as the\nterminal form of reproduction, once coding mechanisms have been\nevolved, which is itself an evolved form of multiplication (Griesemer\n2000a: 76). Unlike Dawkins’ replicator concept, which Griesemer\nbelieves is based on a similarity relationship of\n“copying”, a reproducer requires material overlap\nof systems. However, replication arises when material overlap evolves\nprogeneration, and progeneration evolves a codical inheritance system,\nas\n Figure 4\n indicates. \nFigure 4. Wimsatt and Griesemer’s\nreproducer concept (Wimsatt & Griesemer 2007, 268). \nOthers, particularly Jablonka and Lamb (2005, 2007), think that\nreproducers are distinct from replication, and that some epigenetic\ninheritance systems are reproducers without being replicators. For\nthem, a reproducer is the “target of selection” (see the\nentry on\n inheritance systems).\n \nGodfrey-Smith (2009: 83; see also Okasha 2006: 14) takes issue with\nGriesemer’s requirement of “material overlap” as\nbeing too narrow a definiendum of reproducers. He thinks that\nreproducers need not contribute actual material to their progeny\n(where they template for sequences, as in the case of viruses).\nGriesemer believes Godfrey-Smith has over-interpreted the requirement;\nhe is primarily concerned with the idea that parents cause\nprogeny (Griesemer 2014). Charbonneau (2014) furthers the move made by\nGodfrey-Smith. He argues that the existence of parent-offspring\nlineages is unnecessary for evolution by natural selection to occur. \nAn aspect of reproducers sensu lato that has fascinated some\nis that it does not imply a particular level of reproduction or\nprogeneration, and indeed Szathmáry and Maynard Smith consider\nthat the major transitions of evolution each involve an evolved mode\nof progeneration that is more inclusive or novel than what it evolved\nfrom (Maynard Smith & Szathmáry 1995; Szathmáry\n& Maynard Smith 1997). \nGodfrey-Smith also proposed a taxonomy of reproducers, dividing them\ninto simple, collective and scaffolded (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 87ff).\nSimple reproducers are  \nentities that can reproduce … using their own machinery, in\nconjunction with external sources of energy and raw materials.  \nHe gives an example of a bacterial cell. Collective reproducers  \n… are reproducing entities with parts that themselves have the\ncapacity to reproduce, where the parts do so largely through their own\nresources rather than the coordinated activity as a whole.  \nAnd scaffolded reproducers  \nare entities which get reproduced as part of the reproduction of some\nlarger unit (a simple reproducer), or that are reproduced by some\nother entity.  \nExamples here includes viruses and chromosomes. Godfrey-Smith applies\nthe scaffolded reproducer category to sociocultural evolution. \nThe notion of reproducers has also been applied to speciation and\ncladogenesis (A. Hamilton & Haber 2006). While it may apply to\npopulations, given that taxa do not share the kind of causal unity\nfound in populations and organisms, it is unlikely to apply to species\nor supraspecific taxa, and macroevolution in general. \nThe idea that evolution by natural selection requires the existence of\nreplicators has been a very useful heuristics in evolutionary biology,\nbut also a way of motivating the application of an evolutionary\nthinking beyond the boundaries of evolutionary biology. We started by\nshowing how the notion of gene can be abstracted away from its\nphysical basis and characterized in purely informational terms. We\nthen showed how Dawkins and Hull pursued this abstraction and\nattempted to free the gene from its biological substrate. This\nmotivated responses both from proponents of the replicator concept who\nfurthered the abstraction but also critics. As successful and\ninspiring such an abstraction has been, it should not be reified:\nevolution by natural selection and adaptation can occur even in the\nabsence of replicators. High fidelity certainly facilitates adaptive\nevolution, but this might be because replicators are themselves the\nproduct of evolution rather than necessary for it.","contact.mail":"p.bourrat@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
