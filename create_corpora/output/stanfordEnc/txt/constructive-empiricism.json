Van Fraassen defines the view as follows:\n\n\n\n\nScience aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and\nacceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically\nadequate. (1980, 12)\n\n\n\nWith his doctrine of constructive empiricism, van Fraassen is widely\ncredited with rehabilitating scientific anti-realism. There has been a\ncontentious debate within the philosophy of science community over\nwhether constructive empiricism is true or false. There is also some\nunclarity regarding what van Fraassen’s arguments for the\ndoctrine actually are. In addition, there are controversies about what\nthe doctrine actually amounts to. While constructive empiricism has\nnot gained a wide number of adherents, it continues to be a highly\ninfluential doctrine in philosophy of science.\n\nConstructive empiricism is a view which stands in contrast to the type\nof scientific realism that claims the following: \nIn contrast, the constructive empiricist holds that science aims at\ntruth about observable aspects of the world, but that science does not\naim at truth about unobservable aspects. Acceptance of a theory,\naccording to constructive empiricism, correspondingly differs from\nacceptance of a theory on the scientific realist view: the\nconstructive empiricist holds that as far as belief is concerned,\nacceptance of a scientific theory involves only the belief that the\ntheory is empirically adequate. \nEven given her stance about what theory acceptance involves, a\nconstructive empiricist can still understand scientific theories\nliterally. What makes for a literal understanding of a theory? While\nvan Fraassen does not offer a full-fledged account of literalness in\nThe Scientific Image, he does offer the following two\nnecessary conditions for a theory’s being understood\nliterally: \nIn insisting on an understanding of scientific theories as literally\ntrue, the constructive empiricist sides with the scientific realist\nagainst conventionalists, logical positivists, and instrumentalists.\nWhile advocates of these latter positions may take scientific theories\nto be true, they do so only by interpreting those theories in\nnon-standard ways—in ways that, for instance, violate (1) or (2)\nabove. \nOne of the reasons constructive empiricism is viewed as significant is\nthat it carries on the tradition of the logical positivists without\nbeing saddled with the problematic aspects of the positivists’\npositions. The constructive empiricist follows the logical positivists\nin rejecting metaphysical commitments in science, but she parts with\nthem regarding their endorsement of the verificationist criterion of\nmeaning, as well as their endorsement of the suggestion that\ntheory-laden discourse can and should be removed from science. Before\nvan Fraassen’s The Scientific Image, some philosophers\nhad viewed scientific anti-realism as dead, because logical positivism\nwas dead. Van Fraassen showed that there were other ways to be an\nempiricist with respect to science, without following in the footsteps\nof the logical positivists. \nConstructive empiricism has the look of an epistemological view about\nwhat one should believe—namely, that one should be agnostic\nabout the claims about unobservables that our scientific theories\nmake. But the view is not intended to be read in that way.\nConstructive empiricism is to be understood as a doctrine about what\nthe aim of science is, not a doctrine about what an individual should\nor shouldn’t believe. \nTo make this clear, we can, following van Fraassen (1998, 213), make\nthe following terminological distinction: \nscientific agnostic: someone who believes the science s/he\naccepts to be empirically adequate but does not believe it to be true,\nnor believes it to be false. \nscientific gnostic: someone who believes the science s/he\naccepts to be true. \nIt’s clear, in light of this distinction, that one can be a\nscientific gnostic and a constructive empiricist—one would\nsimply choose to have beliefs that go beyond what science is aiming\nat. There is, of course, a connection between the scientific\nrealist/constructive empiricist dichotomy and the scientific\ngnostic/scientific agnostic dichotomy: \nScientific realists think that the scientific gnostic truly\nunderstands the character of the scientific enterprise, and that the\nscientific agnostic does not. The constructive empiricist thinks that\nthe scientific gnostic may or may not understand the scientific\nenterprise, but that s/he adopts beliefs going beyond what science\nitself involves or requires for its pursuit. (van Fraassen 1998,\n213–214) \nA final point to make about aims is that the constructive empiricist\ndistinguishes between the aim of an individual scientist or group of\nscientists (which may be fame, glory, or what have you) and the aim of\nscience itself. The aim of science determines what counts as success\nin the enterprise of science as such (van Fraassen 1980, 8). Because\nconstructive empiricists do not identify the aim of science with\nwhatever goals the majority of scientists may have, they deny that\nconstructive empiricism is a thesis in sociology subject to the kind\nof empirical confirmation or disconfirmation any scientific thesis\nfaces. Instead, constructive empiricism is to be understood as a\nphilosophical description of science that seeks to explain how an\nempiricist can regard the activity of science as consistent with the\nempiricist’s own standards of rational activity. Like the\ninterpretation of any human activity, constructive empiricism is\nconstrained by the “text” of the scientific activity it\ninterprets. Within those constraints, it succeeds or fails according\nto its ability to provide an interpretation of science that\ncontributes to our understanding of science, making intelligible to us\nvarious elements of its practice. (van Fraassen 1994,\n188–192) \nThe success, then, of constructive empiricism as an account of science\ndoes not depend on how science is understood or undertaken by actual\nscientists. Still, one might start to question the empirical adequacy\nof constructive empiricism’s interpretation of science if the account\nwas dramatically at odds with the attitudes and practices of\nactual scientists. Fortunately, then, for the defender of constructive\nempiricism, recent evidence indicates that is not the case. Based on a\nmethodical survey of practicing scientists, Beebe and Dellsén\n(2020, 359–361) suggest that the attitudes of contemporary scientists\nare largely in line with the constructive empiricist’s views of\ntheory acceptance and science’s aims. \nHere is a rough-and-ready characterization of what it is for a theory\nto be empirically adequate: \nA sufficiently unreflective constructive empiricist might adopt this\nconstrual of empirical adequacy for her theory, but a more\nsophisticated constructive empiricist would probably embrace an\naccount of empirical adequacy akin to that which van Fraassen develops\nlater in The Scientific Image.  \nTo understand that account, one needs first to appreciate the\ndifference between the syntactic view of scientific theories\nand van Fraassen’s preferred semantic view of\nscientific theories. On the syntactic view, a theory is given by an\nenumeration of theorems, expressed in some one particular language. In\ncontrast, on the semantic view, a theory is given by the specification\nof a class of structures (describable in various languages) that are\nthe theory’s models (the determinate structures of which the\ntheory holds true). As van Fraassen says, \nA theory is empirically adequate, then, if\nappearances—“the structures which can be described in\nexperimental and measurement reports” (1980, 64)—are\nisomorphic to the empirical substructures of some model of the theory.\nRoughly speaking, the theory is empirically adequate if the observable\nphenomena can “find a home” within the structures\ndescribed by the theory—that is to say, the observable phenomena\ncan be “embedded” in the theory. See Figure 1 for a\ngraphical illustration of the relations that make a theory empirically\nadequate on van Fraassen’s view, with the cloud shapes\nrepresenting the relata of the isomorphism relation. \nFigure 1. A Theory’s Empirical Adequacy \nThis conception of a theory’s empirical adequacy is arguably\nwhat allows a constructive empiricist to avoid the kind of doxastic\ncommitment Friedman (1982, 278) and Rochefort-Maranda (2011,\n61–62) describe as posing a problem for the constructive\nempiricist (a problem that Rochefort-Maranda subsequently attempts to\nsolve). Here is that problem: \nThe constructive empiricist arguably dissolves this problem by\ninvoking the above conception of empirical adequacy.\n(Rochefort-Maranda gestures in the direction of, but does not\nexplicitly describe, this dissolution in his footnote 1.) Belief that\na theory is empirically adequate amounts to the belief that the\nobservables can be properly embedded in at least one of the\ntheory’s models. Belief in the possibility of that embedding\ndoes not require the constructive empiricist to take the truth of\nsentences about observables to entail the truth of sentences about\nunobservables. By taking a theory to be empirically adequate, the\nconstructive empiricist is simply saying that the phenomena we observe\n(and believe to exist) can exist within the structure the theory\ndescribes, without additionally being committed to saying that the\nunobservable parts of that theoretical structure are parts of the\nactual structure of the world. \nNote that the phenomena relevant to a theory’s empirical\nadequacy are all actual observable phenomena (1980, 12). So\nfor a theory to be empirically adequate, it has to be able to account\nfor more than just the phenomena that have actually been observed and\nthe phenomena that will be observed. See Section 3.4 below for a\ndiscussion of the worry that the constructive empiricist’s\nbelief in the empirical adequacy of her accepted theories thereby\nextends beyond what a bona fide empiricist ought to believe. \nInsofar as the empirical adequacy of a theory amounts to the\nembeddability of observable phenomena within substructures of the\ntheory’s models, the constructive empiricist’s account of\nempirical adequacy rests heavily on the distinction between what is\nobservable and what is not. If, as it is natural to think,‘is\nobservable’ is a vague predicate, we should not expect there to\nbe a precise demarcation between what’s observable and\nwhat’s unobservable. Observability can still serve as a useful\nconcept in the philosophy of science, as long as there are clear cases\nof observability and clear cases of unobservability. \nHere is one rough characterization of observability: \nFor the constructive empiricist, this characterization is “not\nmeant as a definition, but only as a rough guide to the avoidance of\nfallacies” (van Fraassen 1980, 16). It is important to clarify\nthat, as a constructive empiricist would use the terminology, one only\nobserves something when the observation is unaided. One does\nnot see cells through a microscope; instead one sees an image, an\nimage which the scientific gnostic understands one way but the\nscientific agnostic understands a different way. \nNote that the observability of interest is relativized to\n“us,” the members of the epistemic community whose\nscientific theories are the topic of interest. Since what counts as\nobservable is relative to what epistemic community the observer is\npart of, and since the members of that epistemic community are the\nsubject of scientific theory, the constructive empiricist takes what\ncounts as observable as the subject of scientific theory and not\nsomething that can be determined a priori (van Fraassen 1980,\n56–59). Science itself, then, is ultimately the arbiter of what\ncounts as observable. For worries about circularity in the use of\naccepted scientific theory to determine which parts of the world are\nobservable (and hence to determine which theories of science are\nempirically adequate and thereby candidates for acceptance), see\nSection 3.7 below. \nAcceptance has both an epistemic and a pragmatic component. When one\naccepts a theory, one has a belief, and also a commitment. The belief\nis that the theory is empirically adequate. The commitment is “a\ncommitment to the further confrontation of new phenomena within the\nframework of that theory, a commitment to a research programme, and a\nwager that all relevant phenomena can be accounted for without giving\nup that theory” (1980, 88). According to the constructive\nempiricist, this commitment is made at least in part on pragmatic\ngrounds: there is an important role for non-epistemic values in theory\nchoice (van Fraassen 2007, 340). \nFor the constructive empiricist, acceptance comes in degrees. This can\ninfluence how one engages in discourse in the domain of the\ntheory: \nVan Fraassen goes on to explain that acceptance produces contexts\nwhere one engages in discourse “in a context in which language\nuse is guided by that theory.” \nOne reason the constructive empiricist’s account of acceptance\nis important is that it allows us to make sense of scientific\nanti-realists such as constructive empiricists (of the scientific\nagnostic variety) talking as if a particular theory is true. When one\nlooks at scientific discourse, this is what scientists are often\ndoing: they treat a theory as if they fully believe it, and answer\nquestions and give explanations using the resources of the theory. The\nconstructive empiricist can account for this behavior, without\nattributing full belief in the theory to the scientists, by describing\nthe scientists as merely accepting, without fully believing, the\ntheories they develop (van Fraassen 1980, 81–82). \nThe constructive empiricist can acknowledge that scientific realists\nalso recognize that there is a pragmatic dimension to theory\nacceptance. But “because the amount of belief involved in\nacceptance is typically less according to anti-realists, they will\ntend to make more of the pragmatic aspects” (van Fraassen 1980,\n13). \nBefore turning to stronger arguments for constructive empiricism, it\nwill be helpful to draw attention to a couple scientific anti-realist\narguments that the constructive empiricist would be well-advised not\nto use in support of her view. \nFirst, consider the Argument from Underdetermination. This argument\nstarts by pointing out that for any theory, there are rival theories\nthat are empirically equivalent to it—the theories make all the\nsame predictions about what’s observable, but differ only with\nregard to what’s unobservable. The argument goes on to say that\nit follows that all the empirically equivalent theories are equally\nbelievable, and hence belief in the truth of any one of those\nempirically equivalent theories must be irrational. \nWhile the constructive empiricist view is a view about the aims of\nscience and not a normative theory in epistemology, the constructive\nempiricist is an individual who values the sort of epistemic modesty\nwhich might motivate one to harbor anti-realist sympathies in general.\nTo the extent that the constructive empiricist embraces epistemic\nmodesty, she might also be an epistemic voluntarist, a person who\nbelieves that “rationality is only bridled irrationality”\n(van Fraassen 1989, 172). Any behavior that does not make one\ninconsistent or incoherent is rational, by the voluntarist’s\nlights. Such an attitude might seem the natural epistemic one for the\nconstructive empiricist to hold, insofar as the constructive\nempiricist is impressed by the cognitive limits that prevent us from\nhaving conclusive evidence in favor of any one particular theory. \nOne reason the constructive empiricist would be well-advised not to\nembrace the Argument from Underdetermination, then, is that it goes\nagainst a voluntarist position in epistemology. (This point is clearly\nmade by Van Dyck 2007, 19–22, and agreed to by van Fraassen\n2007, 347.) By the voluntarist’s reckoning, going beyond the\nevidence to the extent that one chooses to believe in the truth of a\ntheory, both in its observable and unobservable aspects, could very\nwell be rational. \nThe relatively permissive epistemological view of a constructive\nempiricist who is also an epistemic voluntarist helps explain why such\na constructive empiricist would be prudent not to take constructive\nempiricism to be a normative theory concerning the deliverances of\nscience. Mistakenly understood in that normative way, constructive\nempiricism would imply that belief in a theory’s empirical\nadequacy is the only rational candidate for the belief involved in a\ntheory’s acceptance. Such a constraint on the rationality of\nopinion is clearly at odds with any epistemic voluntarism the\nconstructive empiricist might embrace. \nGideon Rosen (1994, 160–161) gives another reason that the\nconstructive empiricist ought not accept underdetermination arguments\nas grounds for constructive empiricism. Consider the following two\nhypotheses: \nAs Rosen notes, one’s current evidence does not tell in favor of\neither hypothesis over the other. So by an underdetermination-style\nargument, one is not justified in believing either hypothesis. But\nbelief in (A) is the belief the constructive empiricist contends is\ninvolved in theory acceptance. (For more on how one might take\nRosen’s argument as an argument against constructive empiricism,\nsee Section 3.4 below.) \nThe second scientific anti-realist argument a person would be\nwell-advised not to use in support of constructive empiricism is the\nPessimistic Induction Argument. This argument points out that\nscientific theories in the past have been shown to be false, so by\ninduction, we should think that current theories are false, too. If\nthis argument is taken to have the conclusion that belief in our\ncurrent theories is irrational, then, as above, the argument is\nincompatible with any voluntarism the constructive empiricist might\nembrace. The argument is also incompatible with the view of a\nconstructive empiricist who, in the skeptical spirit of anti-realist\nviews in general, rejects reasoning based on a principle of induction.\nVan Fraassen, for instance, writes: “I do not think that there\nis such a thing as Induction, in any form” (2007, 343). \nSo how might one argue for constructive empiricism? One argument for\nconstructive empiricism hinges on the fact that belief in the\nempirical adequacy of a theory is less epistemically audacious than\nbelief in the truth of the theory. Both beliefs, of course, go beyond\nthe evidence: \nSo why is belief that a theory is empirically adequate preferable to\nthe belief that the theory is true? Van Fraassen famously and pithily\nputs the point as follows: \nit is not an epistemological principle that one might as well hang for\na sheep as for a lamb. (1980, 73) \nThe constructive empiricist rejects arguments that suggest that one is\nrationally obligated to believe in the truth of a theory, given that\none believes in the empirical adequacy of the theory. \nFor this epistemological argument to work, the distinction between\nempirical adequacy and truth has to be well-founded. A significant\npart of The Scientific Image is devoted to that task. As\ndescribed in Section 1.6, the constructive empiricist argues that one\ncan make sense of the observable/unobservable distinction, even if\nobservation is theory-laden. (If the distinction between observables\nand unobservables didn’t make sense, the concept of empirical\nadequacy would be incoherent.) \nRosen (1994, 161–163), as well as Monton and van Fraassen (2003,\n407–408), offers an additional rationale for the constructive\nempiricist’s embrace of empirical adequacy rather than truth as\nthe hallmark of the belief component of theory acceptance. One might\nreasonably think of belief in the empirical adequacy of accepted\ntheories as the weakest attitude one can attribute to scientists at\nthe same time that one is still able to make sense of their scientific\nactivity. At the same time, belief in the empirical adequacy of a\ntheory is sufficiently cautious as to allow the believer to remain\nfaithful to the spirit of empiricism. Thus, constructive empiricism is\na view which allows one to regard the activity of science as activity\nthe empiricist can safely endorse. \nOne worry for the constructive empiricist is that theory acceptance\ncan be had under conditions that do not require belief in the\nempirical adequacy of the accepted theories. As Healey 2019 points\nout, scientists appreciate that many of our best scientific theories\nare not able properly to account for all the observable phenomena they\nare meant to account for; the theories are not, in fact, entirely\nempirically adequate. Scientists nevertheless accept those theories:\nthey treat them as working hypotheses to use in the undertaking of\ntheir work, and (as van Fraassen 1980, 88, suggests) the scientists\nare committed to confronting new empirical phenomena in the framework\nthose theories offer. If, then, we understand theory acceptance in the\nway the constructive empiricist does, we must take the scientists’\nacceptance of these theories as misplaced, since the scientists do not\nbelieve the theories to be empirically adequate. \nOne initial response the constructive empiricist might offer to this\nchallenge is the following: if the scientists truly believe the\ntheories to be empirically inadequate, they are not actually accepting\nthe theories, after all. A more sophisticated reply the constructive\nempiricist might give invokes the recognition that, as § 1.7\nabove notes, acceptance comes in degrees and has a pragmatic element.\nThe constructive empiricist can allow that a scientist (mostly)\naccepts a theory, insofar as:  \nthe scientist believes that many/most of the observable phenomena it\ndescribes can be embedded in the theory’s substructures, and \nthe scientist is fairly strongly committed to using the theory as the\nbasis for the scientist’s research program. \nThe satisfaction of (1) and (2) suffice for the scientist to accept\nthe theory to a high degree, even if the scientist does not accept the\ntheory in a categorical, unqualified way. As van Fraassen himself\nacknowledges, it is only unqualified acceptance of a theory\nthat involves the belief that the theory is empirically adequate\n(1998, 213). \nAny tendency we might have to think scientists do fully accept\ntheories may simply be the result of the social role the scientists\nplay as explainers of those theories (as also noted in § 1.7\nabove). In that role, the scientists “answer questions ex\ncathedra ” (van Fraassen 2007, 12), in a manner that the\nunsophisticated listener might mistakenly perceive as a display of\nunqualified confidence in and acceptance of the theories’ empirical\nadequacy. The reality is more subtle—the acceptance is almost\nalways a qualified one.  \nIn any case, even if there is disagreement about how fully scientists\naccept theories, the above reflections suggest that the constructive\nempiricist’s position on theory acceptance is vindicated: the\ndegree to which scientists accept a theory is plausibly correlated\nwith the degree to which they believe the theory to be empirically\nadequate. \nThe constructive empiricist argues that constructive empiricism\n“makes better sense of science, and of scientific activity, than\nrealism does” (van Fraassen 1980, 73). The constructive\nempiricist can be understood as giving two arguments for this claim;\nthe first argument will be presented here, and the second argument\nwill be presented in the next subsection. \nConstructive empiricists might maintain that, for working scientists,\nthe real importance of scientific theories is that they are a factor\nin experimental design. They contrast this with the traditional\npicture presented by philosophy of science. According to the\ntraditional picture, the main goal of scientific practice is to\ndiscern the fundamental structure of the world, and experimentation\nsimply is used to determine whether theories should be taken to be\ntrue, and hence as contributing to our knowledge of the fundamental\nstructure. The constructive empiricist, in contrast, suggests that the\nreason a scientist turns to a theory is that experimental design is\ndifficult, and theories are needed to guide experimental inquiry. But\nwhat scientists are really aiming to discover, according to the\nconstructive empiricist, are “facts about the world—about\nthe regularities in the observable part of the world” (van\nFraassen 1980, 73). \nVan Fraassen argues for this position in part by describing\nMillikan’s famous experiment measuring the charge of the\nelectron. Scientific realists take this experiment to be making a\ndiscovery about the nature of the unobservable entities known as\nelectrons. Van Fraassen, in contrast, presents the experiment as\n“filling in a value for a quantity which, in the construction of\nthe theory, was so far left open” (1980, 77). In doing the\nexperiment, Millikan was discovering a regularity in the observable\npart of the world, and was providing a value for a quantity in atomic\ntheory. Millikan need not be understood as discovering something about\nthe nature of unobservable objects in the world. Van Fraassen says\nthat in a case like Millikan’s, \nAnother way in which, according to the constructive empiricist,\nconstructive empiricism makes better sense of science than realism\ndoes has to do with theory choice. Some virtues that scientists see in\ntheories are pragmatic virtues, not epistemic virtues. This shows that\nscientists are choosing between theories using criteria other than\ntruth. \nWhat virtues are pragmatic? Here is what van Fraassen says: \nSome scientific realists might hold that some of these are epistemic\nvirtues, not pragmatic virtues. With regard to simplicity, the\nconstructive empiricist can recognize that scientific realists\nsometimes hold that simpler theories are more likely to be true, but\nat the same time the constructive empiricist can contend that \nWith regard to explanation, constructive empiricists recognize that\nscientific realists typically attach an objective validity to requests\nfor explanation (van Fraassen 1980, 13), but constructive empiricists\ndo not grant that objective validity. Van Fraassen’s arguments\nthat explanation is pragmatic constitute a significant part of The\nScientific Image, and will be discussed in the next\nsubsection. \nConstructive empiricists recognize that these pragmatic factors like\nsimplicity and explanatory power are important guides in the pursuit\nof the aim of science (van Fraassen 1980, 89). But they insist that\nthese factors are valuable in that pursuit only insofar as their\nconsideration advances the development of theories that are\nempirically adequate and empirically strong. The factors do not have\nspecial value as indicators of the truth of what the theories say\nabout the unobservable parts of the world. \nScientific realists, by contrast, sometimes say that they believe in\nthe truth of scientific theories because the theories provide a\nsatisfying explanation of the observable phenomena, an explanation\nthat unifies what would otherwise be disparate observations. The\nconstructive empiricist is not moved by such considerations: \nIndeed, one can recognize the explanatory power of a theory without\ntaking it to be true. Van Fraassen points out that theories can\nexplain well even if they are false. Newton’s theory of\ngravitation explains the motion of the planets and the tides,\n“Huygens’s theory explained the diffraction of light,\nRutherford’s theory of the atom explained the scattering of\nalpha particles, Bohr’s theory explained the hydrogen spectrum,\nLorentz’s theory explained clock retardation.” But none of\nthese theories is now thought to be true. \nFor the constructive empiricist, the explanatory power of a theory\namounts to nothing more than the theory’s ability to provide\ncertain bits of information in response to contextually defined\nqueries. Scientific explanation amounts to the highlighting of various\naspects of the structure postulated by the theory, to answer, in a\ncontextually dependent way, various questions of interest to us (van\nFraassen 1980, 124). Science, then, contributes nothing to explanation\nover and above the descriptive and informative content of the\nscientific theory: “a success of explanation is a success of\nadequate and informative description” (van Fraassen 1980,\n156–157). Explanation cannot be reduced to that content, though,\nsince explanation cannot occur unless an appropriate question, offered\nin a particular context, is provided. Explanation thus goes beyond\nwhat science reveals to us. The constructive empiricist can hence\navoid saddling scientists with a commitment to the unobservable\nentities invoked in such explanations, properly claiming that such\ncommitments are not licensed by the activity of science. (See Kitcher\n& Salmon 1987 for the view that even if requests for explanation\nare contextually delimited, what counts as a good / relevant\nexplanation depends also on non-contextual factors.) \nA fair portion of the constructive empiricist’s account of\nscientific explanation is thus devoted to an explication of the\ncontextual dependence of explanation. Among other reasons given in\nfavor of that contextual dependence, van Fraassen points out that\nexplanations are typically causal in character—they attempt to\nsituate the event-to-be-explained in the “causal net”\npostulated by the scientific theory. Which events in that net are\npicked out as “the” cause(s) of some event-to-be-explained\ndepend upon the interests of the individuals asking the explanatory\nquestion (1980, 124–126). \nExplanation will frequently involve the invocation of counterfactuals,\noften of the form: if event B had not occurred, neither would event A\nhave (van Fraassen 1980, 118). That’s because (as just noted)\nexplanations are frequently causal in character, and analyses of\ncausation typically invoke some sort of counterfactual. Another\ncomponent of the constructive empiricist’s efforts at showing\nexplanation to be context-dependent, then, amounts to his exposition\nof the context dependence of counterfactuals. \nVan Fraassen points out that any counterfactual has a ceteris paribus\nclause, but what is “being kept equal” by the asserter of\nthe counterfactual varies from context to context. For example,\nconsider the counterfactual, “If Tom were to light the fuse,\nthere would be an explosion.” If the ceteris paribus clause of\nthe speaker keeps constant the fact that the fuse leads to a barrel of\ngunpowder, and the fact that lit fuses leading to barrels of gunpowder\ntypically result in explosions, then the counterfactual would, in that\ncontext, be true. If, on the other hand, the ceteris paribus clause of\nthe speaker also kept constant the fact that Tom is generally paranoid\nabout explosions around barrels of gunpowder and fuses, and would only\nlight the fuse if he had disconnected the fuse from the barrel, then\nthe counterfactual would, in that context, be false (1980, 116). Until\nthe context that fixes the ceteris paribus clause is specified, we\ncannot say what the truth value of the counterfactual in question is.\nOnly once the context is determined does the counterfactual admit of\nan objective truth value. \nOne of the reasons the constructive empiricist highlights the context\ndependence of explanation is that she wishes to show how efforts at\nexplaining various parts of the world extend beyond the activity of\nscience. Since, for instance, the propositions of science are not\ncontext-dependent in character, but the counterfactuals involved in\nexplanation are, we have reason to think that explanation involves\nsomething more than the descriptive information science gives us:\nnamely, the context-dependent interests of the individual seeking an\nexplanation in answer to some question. Also, if (as seems likely) the\nconcept of a law of nature has to be understood in a counterfactual\nway, counterfactuals’ context-dependence implies that those\nlaws, too, go beyond what science reveals to us (van Fraassen 1980,\n118). \nIt should be clear here, then, that the constructive\nempiricist’s efforts at showing explanatory efforts to extend\nbeyond the activity of science are part of an effort to show that the\nscientific realist is mistaken in thinking that science gives us\nreason to think that claims about causation, laws of nature, and other\ncounterfactuals represent objective, context-independent truths about\nthe world. \nScientific realists might point out that constructive empiricists do\nallow that explanatory power can count as a pragmatic virtue of a\ntheory (van Fraassen 1980, 89). But, one might naturally think, no\nscientist can acknowledge the explanatory power of a theory without\ntaking the theory to be true. So, continues the scientific realist,\nthe constructive empiricist cannot admit the usefulness of explanatory\npower to the scientist without also regarding the scientist as taking\nher theories to be true. \nThe constructive empiricist disagrees. Among other reasons, she can\ncite the earlier mentioned explanatory power of false theories.\nAdditionally, the constructive empiricist might insist that use of a\ntheory need not entail a commitment to the theory’s entire\nontology. A person offering an explanation speaks from within the\nlanguage of the theory she accepts. Consistent with that acceptance,\nshe is “conceptually immersed” within the theory. But such\nuse of language need not reflect the individual’s epistemic\ncommitment, which may be merely to take the theory to be empirically\nadequate (van Fraassen 1980, 151–152). So, for instance, talk of\npossibility and necessity can be thought of not as talk about some\nobjective modality in nature, but as talk of what phenomena fit in the\nmodels of the accepted theory (van Fraassen 1980, 201–202).\n‘X is possible’ can be interpreted as\n‘X appears in some model of the theory,’ while\n‘X is necessary’ can be read as ‘X\nappears in every model of the theory.’ Again, the constructive\nempiricist sees the scientist as “immersing” herself in\nthe world of the theory, talking as if the theory were true, with\nlanguage reflecting the structure of the theory. But she need not take\nthe theory’s modal structure to correspond to any in\nreality. \nWe can see in the above discussion of the pragmatics of explanation\nwhy the constructive empiricist thinks constructive empiricism can\nhelp us to make sense of science “without inflationary\nmetaphysics” (van Fraassen 1980, 73). By “inflationary\nmetaphysics,” van Fraassen has in mind the scientific\nrealists’ typical beliefs in, for example, laws of nature,\nnatural kinds, and objective modality. \nThe constructive empiricist recognizes that believing in empirical\nadequacy involves sticking our necks out, just as believing in truth\ndoes; nonetheless, \nScientific realists might not be moved by this consideration, because\nthey might not see any problem with inflationary metaphysics. The\npoint of The Scientific Image, according to van Fraassen, was\nto answer the question: what should an empiricist think about science?\nSince an empiricist would want to avoid inflationary metaphysics, this\nconsideration would move them to favor constructive empiricism. The\nquestion of why one would want to be an empiricist is taken up in van\nFraassen’s 2002 book, The Empirical Stance. \nOne way that the constructive empiricist might indirectly support\nconstructive empiricism is by taking issue with Hilary Putnam’s\nmiracle argument for scientific realism. This argument holds that\nscientific realism “is the only philosophy that doesn’t\nmake the success of science a miracle” (Putnam 1975, 73). Putnam\ngoes on to argue that the statements that a scientific realist would\nmake about our mature scientific theories are “part of the only\nscientific explanation of the success of science.” To give an\nadequate scientific description of science, scientific realism needs\nto be assumed. \nPutnam’s basic idea is as follows: if the scientific theories\nare false, why would they be so successful? Van Fraassen famously\nreplies with an evolutionary analogy: \nVan Fraassen’s point is that a theory can be empirically\nadequate, and hence latch on to the observable regularities in nature,\nwithout being true. The scientific competition between theories hinges\non which theory accurately describes the observable world; it does not\nhinge on which theory is actually true. Thus, it would not be\nmiraculous for science to arrive at an empirically adequate,\nscientifically successful, yet false theory. (See the discussion of\nthe Miracle Argument in the entry on\n scientific realism\n for more on the miracle argument as a consideration in favor of\nscientific realism.) \nInference to the Best Explanation is the controversial rule of\ninference which basically holds that, out of the class of potential\nexplanations we have of some phenomena, we should infer that the best\nexplanation is the true one. If Inference to the Best Explanation is a\nrule we do (or ought) to follow, then it looks as if scientific\nrealism is an accurate description (or prescription) of the aims of\nscience—we should acknowledge the reality of the entities our\nbest explanatory theories postulate, even if those entities are\nunobservable. \nThe constructive empiricist might offer several responses to this\nchallenge: \nIn sum, because the constructive empiricist rejects Inference to the\nBest Explanation, she is not moved by arguments for scientific realism\nthat make use of that rule of inference. (See the discussion of\nskepticism about inference to the best explanation in the entry on\n scientific realism\n for an elaboration of doubts about the use of inference to the best\nexplanation as a motivating consideration in favor of scientific\nrealism.) \nA standard type of objection to constructive empiricism, one that was\nespecially prevalent soon after The Scientific Image was\npublished, is the type of objection that takes issue with the clarity\nor cogency of the observable/unobservable distinction. A few examples\nof this type of objection will be presented in this section, along\nwith constructive empiricist replies. \nBy the constructive empiricist’s lights, distant macroscopic\nobjects are observable, since if we were nearby we could see them.\nPaul Churchland (1985, 39–40) takes issue with the importance\nthe constructive empiricist attaches to size, as opposed to\nspatiotemporal proximity. Churchland points out that it is just a\ncontingent fact that humans have control over their spatiotemporal\nlocation, but not over their size. Churchland concludes that the\ndistinction between things that are unobserved but observable, and\nthings that are unobservable, “is only very feebly principled\nand is wholly inadequate to bear the great weight that van Fraassen\nputs on it” (Churchland 1985, 40). \nVan Fraassen replies with the recognition that “scientific\nrealists tend to feel baffled by the idea that our opinion about the\nlimits of perception should play a role in arriving at our epistemic\nattitudes toward science” (1985, 258). Constructive empiricists\nare not asserting any metaphysical difference in the world on the\nbasis of the observable/unobservable distinction; they are just saying\nthat that distinction is relevant to the epistemic attitudes we take.\nSince “experience is the sole legitimate source of information\nabout the world” (van Fraassen 1985, 258), it makes sense that\nwhat we can experience influences our epistemic attitudes. (Note that\nin his 2002 book The Empirical Stance, van Fraassen calls\ninto question his 1985 statement about experience.) \nA different argument by Churchland (1985, 44–45) asks what the\nconstructive empiricist would say about beings who are like us except\nthat they are born with electron microscopes permanently attached to\ntheir left eyes. Churchland says that the electron-microscope-eye\nhumanoids would count viruses as part of their ontology, and yet by\nthe constructive empiricist’s lights we can’t, even though\nwe are functionally the same as the humanoids when we put our left eye\nagainst the viewfinder of an electron microscope. \nThe constructive empiricist might reply that we are not warranted in\nsaying that the humanoids have the experience of viruses\nunless we already treat the humanoids as being part of our epistemic\ncommunity (van Fraassen 1985, 256–257). If we do expand our\nepistemic community to include them, then the constructive empiricist\nis happy to say that in that situation viruses are observable. But if\nwe do not accept them as part of our epistemic community, then we will\nsimply analyze them as like us, except having electron microscopes\nattached to themselves, and we will say that they are “reliable\nindicators of whatever the usual combination of human with electron\nmicroscope reliably indicates” (van Fraassen 1985, 257). In that\ncase the extension of ‘observable’ is unchanged. \nAnother argument calling into question the significance of the\nobservable/unobservable distinction is presented by Ian Hacking (1985,\n146–147). Hacking considers a machine which makes grids of the\nsame shape but various sizes. We can see grids with the same overall\nshape of smaller and smaller size, but the machine makes some grids\nthat are too small to be seen with the unaided eye. When looked at\nthrough a microscope, however, the unobservable grids are seen to have\nthe same shape as the observable ones. Hacking writes: \nHacking concludes that it would be unreasonable to be an anti-realist\nabout the unobservable grid, and hence we should at least sometimes\nbelieve what science tells us about unobservables. \nVan Fraassen (1985, 298) replies by pointing out an unwarranted\nsupposition in Hacking’s argument: the claim that we made the\ngrid to be that way implies what is under dispute, that the grid was\nsuccessfully made to be that way. Regarding the argument that, if\ndifferent types of microscopes make similar observations, then the\nobservations must be veridical, van Fraassen replies that that\nargument \nBut this is a premise that the constructive empiricist rejects. \nHere van Fraassen is allowing for the possibility that the\nconstructive empiricist can reasonably be agnostic about the grid. Van\nFraassen replies in a similar fashion to an objection that Paul Teller\nputs forth about the immediacy of objects viewed through a\nmicroscope. \nTeller (2007) claims that the images produced by many scientific\ninstruments require some interpretative effort for us to make\nassertions about what it is that we are seeing. What we see through\noptical microscopes, on the other hand, is importantly different. In\nsuch an observation, we take ourselves to see the object being\nmagnified itself, immediately and without interpretative effort. \nThe conclusion Teller draws is that contrary to what van Fraassen\nclaims, what is observable extends beyond what members of our\nepistemic community can observe unaided by measuring instruments. What\nis observable minimally also includes the objects viewed through\noptical microscopes, as well as other objects whose observation is\nsimilarly unmediated by interpretation (132–134). \nIn reply, van Fraassen (2001) suggests that what we see through a\nmicroscope is akin to reflections seen in mirrors and other reflective\nsurfaces—the reflection of a tree in a body of water, for\ninstance. In both the case of the observation via the microscope and\nthe object viewed in a reflection, we might assert that what we are\nseeing is a real object. But van Fraassen points out an important\ndifference between the reflected object and our observation through\nthe microscope. We are confident that the reflection is of a real\nobject because we can observe certain invariances between the object\npurportedly being observed (the tree), the reflective image, and our\nvantage point. We can, for instance, see that the tree maintains a\ncertain fixed position relative to the reflective body, and we can see\nthat the angle subtended by the lines between us and the two bodies is\na particular function of the observer’s position. The\nobservation of these invariances is possible, in part, because the\ntree is itself observable without the aid of instruments (van Fraassen\n2001, 160). \nThat, however, is not true of the objects—the paramecia,\nsay—that are purportedly being observed through the microscope.\nBecause the paramecia are not directly observable without instruments,\nwe can only hypothesize that there are objects being observed for\nwhich the invariant geometric relations hold. It is possible for us,\nthen, to maintain an agnosticism about the paramecia that we\ncan’t about the tree (160). We can regard our observations via\nthe microscope the same way we regard our observations of\nrainbows—namely, as observations of phenomena that are public\n(even capable of being captured by photographic equipment) without at\nthe same time being observations of some existent object (162). (We\nsay that the rainbow is not an actual physical object because it does\nnot participate in the invariant geometric relations we expect of\nactual physical objects: “If the rainbow were a thing, the\nvarious observations and photos would all locate it in the same place\nin space, at any given time” (157) ). \nAlspector-Kelly (2004) claims that there is not the difference\ndescribed here between aided and unaided perception. If the\nconstructive empiricist insists that rainbows, reflections, and the\nlike constitute publicly observable phenomena despite not amounting to\nactually existing objects, then what we experience in the case of\nunaided veridical perception is also some kind of image-like\nobservable phenomena: \nIf this is true, then unaided veridical perception is not\ndistinguished from aided perception in the way van Fraassen suggests.\nUnaided veridical perception is as much mediated by image-like\nobservable phenomena as aided perception is. \nAs we will see in §3.6, the constructive empiricist might\nnaturally express skepticism, in the case of unaided veridical\nperception, about the existence of anything like image-like phenomena.\nKusch (2015) points out one reason for skepticism: the phenomena in\nquestion exhibit fewer of the invariant relations—“unlike,\nsay, rainbows, visual experience cannot be photographed”\n(177)—that would allow us to characterize the phenomena as\npublic, verifiable ones capable of empirical study. \nA constructive empiricist might also respond to Alspector-Kelly by\nadvocating something like a disjunctivist view of perception, denying\nthat what is observed in the disparate cases really is the same. On\nsuch a view, unaided veridical perception really is of actual physical\nobjects, whereas perception with instrumentation results only in the\nexperience of some kind of publicly observable phenomena akin to\nrainbows and reflections. It remains to be seen whether independent\nmotivation for such a view can help recommend it over the alternative\noffered by the defender of microscopic observables. \nAccording to the constructive empiricist, “there is no purely\nepistemic warrant for going beyond our evidence” (van Fraassen\n2007, 343). But then why does the constructive empiricist hold that\nthe aim of science involves going beyond our evidence? Empiricism\nwants to be epistemically modest, but belief that a theory is\nempirically adequate goes well beyond the deliverances of experience.\nHence, one can object to constructive empiricism by suggesting that it\nis not sufficiently epistemically modest: the doctrine that the aim of\nscience is truth about what is observable should be replaced with the\ndoctrine that the aim of science is truth about what’s actually\nbeen observed. (For versions of this criticism, see for example\nGutting 1985, Railton 1990, Rosen 1994, and Alspector-Kelly 2001.) \nThe constructive empiricist’s reply, as presented by Monton and\nvan Fraassen (2003, 407–408), is as follows. Constructive\nempiricism incorporates a prior commitment to the rationality of\nscience—it is a doctrine about what the aim of science actually\nis; it is not attempting to present a revisionary account of how\nscience should be done. According to the doctrine that the aim of\nscience is truth about what’s been observed, \nThe constructive empiricist can hence conclude that the doctrine that\nthe aim of science is truth about what’s been observed\n“fails to capture our idea of what it is to do good\nscience” (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 407). \nSo the constructive empiricist is firm in her construal of the aim of\nscience as truth about the observable. One might worry, though, as\nJames Ladyman (2000) does, that such a view brings with it a\ncommitment to modal realism and belief in whatever entities such a\ncommitment may require. So, for instance, talk of observability might\ncommit the constructive empiricist to belief in the existence of\npossible worlds, a commitment that an empiricist would prefer not to\nmake. \nTo understand why one might think this way, consider the following. As\nnoted in section 1.6 above, one natural way of understanding\n“x is observable” is in the following\ncounterfactual manner: \nIf the truth conditions of counterfactuals are understood in terms of\npossible worlds, it is easy to see how beliefs about what is\nobservable entail commitments to the existence of such worlds. \nOne reply to this threat of modal realism is that contrary to the\ninitial impression provided by the counterfactual characterization of\nobservability, observability is not a modal property, after all\n(Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 411). As explained in section 2.5\nabove, van Fraassen takes the truth of counterfactuals to be\ncontext-dependent. Once a context is fixed, counterfactuals can be\nexpressed as non-modal conditionals. In the case of the\ncounterfactuals that explicate observability, then, fixing the\nepistemic community of the “suitably constituted observer”\ntransforms the counterfactuals into straightforward non-modal\nconditionals whose truth or lack thereof we can empirically\ninvestigate (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 413–414). Belief in\nthe truth of some claim of the form ’x is observable’\namounts simply to belief in the truth of such a context-fixed,\nnon-modal conditional. \nWhether such conditionals are true is an empirical question to which\nour best scientific theories may provide an answer. So even though\nobservability represents some objective, theory-independent property\nof the world (van Fraassen 1980, 57), we can use our best scientific\ntheories to answer the question, “What is observable?”\n(Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 415–416): \nFor worries about methodological circularity in using our accepted\ntheories to supply facts about observability—facts that bear on\nthe theories’ own empirical adequacy—see section 3.7\nbelow. \nOne additional worry about Monton and van Fraassen’s non-modal\ncharacterization of observability is given by Ladyman (2004). Consider\nthe claim ‘x is observable’ for some x that\nis never actually observed. Ladyman asserts that no empirical\ninvestigation will be sufficient to establish the truth of the\nrelevant non-modal conditional “unless we take it that the\nspecification by science of some regularities among the actual facts\nas laws … is latching onto objective features of the\nworld” (Ladyman 2004, 762). As Ladyman sees it, only objectively\nexisting laws, and not pragmatically selected empirical regularities,\ncan underwrite claims about the observability of objects never\nactually observed. \nPaul Dicken (2007) offers another promising way for the constructive\nempiricist to resist the threat of a commitment to modal realism that\nis posed by talk of observability. He suggests that the constructive\nempiricist take the same attitude toward the truth of observability\ncounterfactuals that she takes toward other claims of endorsed\nscientific theories: namely, acceptance of the counterfactuals rather\nthan belief in them (608). \nIndeed, given that observability is itself supposed to be a subject of\nscientific theory (as noted above), acceptance is the natural attitude\nfor a constructive empiricist to take toward the counterfactuals that\nexplicate observability. She relies on those counterfactuals in the\nway she relies on the other elements of the theories she accepts, even\n(in certain contexts) talking as if the counterfactuals are true. In\nthis way, according to Dicken, she can make use of claims about what\nis observable while at the same time being agnostic about possible\nworlds whose existence is purportedly entailed by the truth of the\ncounterfactuals explicating observability. \nAn objection related to the one from section 3.4 is the following. The\nconstructive empiricist errs not just in believing claims about what\nis unobservable-but-not-actually-observed, but also in believing\nclaims about actually observed entities the likes of macroscopic\nphysical objects. If one really takes to heart the advice that\none’s beliefs should not extend beyond one’s evidence,\nthen one should limit belief to claims about the mental experiences\nthat one is having. \nA constructive empiricist might reply to the objection as follows: \nAs noted in Section 1.6 above, the constructive empiricist says that\nwhat counts as observable is relative to who the observer is and what\nepistemic community that observer is part of. Since the observer is\nher- or himself the subject of scientific theory, what counts as\nobservable is also the subject of scientific theory. Here are two\nworries about the use of scientific theory as the determiner of\nobservability: \nRelativity: If a theory of observability determines\nwhat is observable, and empirical adequacy is assessed in terms of\nwhat is observable, then a theory of observability can name the terms\nof its own empirical adequacy. Empirical adequacy becomes radically\nrelative. With no objective, theory-independent constraints on\nempirical adequacy, it’s “anything goes” when it\ncomes to theory acceptance: one simply adopts the theory of\nobservability that underwrites the empirical adequacy of whichever\ntheory one is interested in accepting. \nCircularity: if scientific theory is the arbiter of\nobservability, then an individual has no choice but to use the theory\nof observability she accepts as a guide to observability, and hence as\na guide to empirical adequacy, and hence as a guide to whether or not\nto accept that very theory. But to use the theory as a guide to\nwhether or not to accept that theory involves the individual in\nepistemic circularity. \nThe constructive empiricist might reply to Relativity by insisting\nthat while we must look to science for an account of observability,\nobservability is not a theory-dependent notion. What counts as\nobservable is an objective, theory-independent fact. So there’s\nno danger of relativism about empirical adequacy (van Fraassen 1980,\n57–58). \nThis response only addresses Relativity; the objectivity of\nobservability does not save us from the epistemic circularity that\ncomes about from our having to use a theory of observability as the\nstandard of empirical adequacy by which we assess that theory’s\nown empirical adequacy. The epistemic circularity has to do with how\nwe come to certain beliefs about observability, not with the\nobjectivity of the observability facts. \nIf such circularity were avoidable, then it would be good for us to\navoid it. Unfortunately for us, the constructive empiricist might say,\nit is not avoidable (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 415–416,\nmaintains this line). Advocates of constructive empiricism might\ninsist that any search for a Cartesian-style guarantee of the\ncorrectness of our theory of observability is a search in vain. We\nhave to accept some such theory, imperfect though it may be, and\nmodify our acceptance if experience proves that acceptance to be\nmisplaced. \nThe Hermeneutic Circle objection was prefaced on the claim that what\ncounts as observable is, according to the constructive empiricist,\ndetermined by scientific theory. Another worry based on that\npresupposition, raised by Alspector-Kelly (2004), is that scientific\ntheory determines much more to be observable than the constructive\nempiricist typically allows. On Alspector-Kelly’s view, we\nshould countenance as observable whatever science says we can have\nreliable information about on the basis of perceptual experience, and\nscience says we can have reliable information about what is\nperceptually revealed to us via microscopes. \nIn response to Alspector-Kelly, Kusch (2015) insists that the\nconstructive empiricist can rely on science to determine what counts\nas observable, without at the same time countenancing the\nmicroscopic as observable. That’s because “the phenomenon\nof naked-eye observation calls for one (kind of) theory; the\nphenomenon of instrumentally-aided eye-use calls for at least two\n(kinds of) theories: the theory covering naked-eye observation and\ntheories of the instrument and its interaction with our naked\neyes” (179). As noted earlier, constructive empiricists value\nepistemic modesty. If a constructive empiricist can rely on science to\ngive us an account of the kind of unaided observation in which all\nscience is grounded, without at the same time having to make use of\nscientific theories that go farther afield, then by the constructive\nempiricist’s lights, that more modest invocation of science is\nto be preferred in deciding the question of observability. \nRosen (1994, 164–169) contends that a scientist cannot remain\nfaithful both to the epistemic standards of the empiricist at the same\ntime that she accepts various scientific theories in the way that the\nconstructive empiricist describes. If what Rosen says is correct, then\nconstructive empiricism fails as an explanation of how a committed\nempiricist can endorse the activity of science as rational. \nRosen’s argument goes as follows. Using the terminology of van\nFraassen’s semantic view of theories (described in Sec. 1.5\nabove), Rosen says an individual believing a theory to be empirically\nadequate \nIndeed, we would naturally suspect that a constructive empiricist\nwould suspend belief about the existence of abstract objects,\nwhich are unobservable entities if anything is. So it looks as if an\nempiricist cannot accept any scientific theories, if acceptance\namounts to what the constructive empiricist says it does. \nOne possible response the constructive empiricist might give here is a\nfictionalist account of mathematical objects. Embracing such a\nfictionalist view, an individual could use the theoretical apparatus\nof mathematics without committing herself to the existence of the\nobjects that are the alleged subject matter of mathematical theories.\nRosen (1994) considers this response but contends that it is not one\nthat a constructive empiricist may want to accept. The problem, Rosen\nsays, is that to embrace fictionalism about a theory T that\none accepts commits one to believing claims of the following form: \nSuch a counterfactual-involving belief appears to commit the believer\nto the truth of certain modal facts, a commitment eschewed by the\ntypical Hume-inspired empiricist. Perhaps the constructive empiricist\ncan view the relevant counterfactuals as reducible to non-modal\nconditionals, in the spirit of the context-dependent reduction of\ncounterfactuals to non-modal conditionals entertained in section 3.5\nabove. If such a reduction can be successfully undertaken, the\nconstructive empiricist can avoid commitment to belief in the truth of\nthe relevant modal facts. \nWhether the constructive empiricist would ultimately want to endorse\nsome fictionalist view about mathematical objects is an open question.\nFor an attempt at developing a constructive empiricist philosophy of\nmathematics, see Bueno 1999. \nRowbottom (2019) contends that it would be wrong to characterize the\ndisagreement between the constructive empiricist and the scientific\nrealist as a debate about the aims of science. In extending his\ncritique, we might also be persuaded that constructive empiricism is\nmistaken in thinking that any philosophy of science ought centrally to\nbe about aims at all. In characterizing what science is, we should\ninstead focus on the many disparate activities and products of science\nitself, independent of any general aim or “point” to the activity. As\nRowbottom says, \nOne can learn how to perform various scientific tasks, and\nperform them well, without any explicit or implicit reference to an\nultimate or central ‘point’ of the exercise—the\noverarching process—of which they are a part. One may focus\ninstead on the immediate products of these tasks… ‘What\nis science?’ can be answered by pointing to those processes, how\nthey interact, and so forth. And what science can achieve may be\n(largely or wholly) independent of what its practitioners think it can\nachieve, or any rather mystical ‘point’ of the exercise\n(454–455). \nA defender of constructive empiricism might suggest that unless we\nthink of the activity of science in relation to some aim or other, we\ncannot properly understand that activity; and unless we understand as\nunited under some general aim all the disparate many ways that science\nis undertaken, we cannot understand those many practices as parts\nof science (as opposed to, say, parts of religion or politics\nor …). The activity is rendered intelligible only in light of\nthe point and purpose of undertaking it, and it is rendered\nintelligible as science only in light of a point or purpose\nshared with other activities regarded as scientific. \nAs van Fraassen (1994) puts it,  \n[S]cientists with their very different motives and convictions\nparticipate in a common enterprise, defined by its own internal\ncriteria of success, and this success is their common aim\n‘inside’ this cluster of diverging personal aim [sic]. How\nelse could they be said to be collaborating in a common enterprise?\nThe question is only what that defining criterion of success is\n(182). \nStill, even if we can offer an interpretation of science and its\nactivity as animated by a particular aim, which aim that is may be\nless important in characterizing science than the activity itself.\nRowbottom presses this point with the following thought\nexperiment: \nImagine members of an alien species, for whom acceptance—or if\nyou prefer to reserve ‘acceptance’ for humans, call it\n‘a-acceptance’—involves belief neither in\n(approximate) truth nor empirical adequacy. (This might be due to\npsychological constraints. A-acceptance could instead involve belief\nin significant truth content, high problem-solving power,\napproximate empirical adequacy, and so on.) Would we want to say that\nthey were incapable of doing science? Or failing that, would we want\nto insist that they couldn’t do anything with the\n‘character’ of science? That would be strange. For they\ncould have institutions similar to our universities, and have theories\nsimilar to our scientific theories, arrived at by the use of\nsimilar procedures. They could also use these theories for exactly the\nsame purposes for which we use our scientific theories: to\nexplain the origins of the universe, to build spacecraft, and so forth\n(456).  \nRowbottom here is, of course, describing theory acceptance. Insofar,\nthough, as a theory’s acceptability is determined by the degree of the\ntheory’s success at achieving a particular aim or aims, we can take\nthe point to be equally about aims. We can understand, that is, the\naliens as engaging in science even if they are not aiming for\nempirically adequate, or true, theories. In comparison to the activity\nitself, aims appear to be the less important thing to focus on in\ncharacterizing the activity as distinctively scientific. \nHow might a constructive empiricist reply? As noted in §1.4\nabove, constructive empiricism is to be regarded as the best\ninterpretative account of the activity of science that renders it\nconsistent with the empiricist’s own standards of rational\nactivity. It is, as van Fraassen (1994) says, what allow us to\n“make sense of those activities which we all agree are part\nof science” (190). As such, it is not beholden to scientists’ own\nprofessed aims in the activity the scientists undertake. Even if\nscientists—alien or human—regard themselves as being\nprincipally concerned with truth, or problem-solving, or predictive\nutility, none of those aims could be achieved without science being at\nleast minimally aimed at empirical adequacy for its theories. Positing\nempirical adequacy as the aim of science, then, allows the\nconstructive empiricist to best and most modestly make sense of the\nactivity of science. The variability of particular scientists’\nindividual or collective aims does not undercut the singular and\nimportant role empirical adequacy plays in how we might\nphilosophically best interpret science and its many disparate\nactivities.","contact.mail":"bradley.monton@colorado.edu","contact.domain":"colorado.edu"},{"date.published":"2008-10-01","date.changed":"2021-04-13","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructive-empiricism/","author1":"Bradley Monton","author2":"Chad Mohler","entry":"constructive-empiricism","body.text":"\n\n\nConstructive empiricism is the version of scientific anti-realism\npromulgated by Bas van Fraassen in his famous book The Scientific\nImage (1980). Van Fraassen defines the view as follows:\n\n\n\n\nScience aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and\nacceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically\nadequate. (1980, 12)\n\n\n\nWith his doctrine of constructive empiricism, van Fraassen is widely\ncredited with rehabilitating scientific anti-realism. There has been a\ncontentious debate within the philosophy of science community over\nwhether constructive empiricism is true or false. There is also some\nunclarity regarding what van Fraassen’s arguments for the\ndoctrine actually are. In addition, there are controversies about what\nthe doctrine actually amounts to. While constructive empiricism has\nnot gained a wide number of adherents, it continues to be a highly\ninfluential doctrine in philosophy of science.\n\nConstructive empiricism is a view which stands in contrast to the type\nof scientific realism that claims the following: \nIn contrast, the constructive empiricist holds that science aims at\ntruth about observable aspects of the world, but that science does not\naim at truth about unobservable aspects. Acceptance of a theory,\naccording to constructive empiricism, correspondingly differs from\nacceptance of a theory on the scientific realist view: the\nconstructive empiricist holds that as far as belief is concerned,\nacceptance of a scientific theory involves only the belief that the\ntheory is empirically adequate. \nEven given her stance about what theory acceptance involves, a\nconstructive empiricist can still understand scientific theories\nliterally. What makes for a literal understanding of a theory? While\nvan Fraassen does not offer a full-fledged account of literalness in\nThe Scientific Image, he does offer the following two\nnecessary conditions for a theory’s being understood\nliterally: \nIn insisting on an understanding of scientific theories as literally\ntrue, the constructive empiricist sides with the scientific realist\nagainst conventionalists, logical positivists, and instrumentalists.\nWhile advocates of these latter positions may take scientific theories\nto be true, they do so only by interpreting those theories in\nnon-standard ways—in ways that, for instance, violate (1) or (2)\nabove. \nOne of the reasons constructive empiricism is viewed as significant is\nthat it carries on the tradition of the logical positivists without\nbeing saddled with the problematic aspects of the positivists’\npositions. The constructive empiricist follows the logical positivists\nin rejecting metaphysical commitments in science, but she parts with\nthem regarding their endorsement of the verificationist criterion of\nmeaning, as well as their endorsement of the suggestion that\ntheory-laden discourse can and should be removed from science. Before\nvan Fraassen’s The Scientific Image, some philosophers\nhad viewed scientific anti-realism as dead, because logical positivism\nwas dead. Van Fraassen showed that there were other ways to be an\nempiricist with respect to science, without following in the footsteps\nof the logical positivists. \nConstructive empiricism has the look of an epistemological view about\nwhat one should believe—namely, that one should be agnostic\nabout the claims about unobservables that our scientific theories\nmake. But the view is not intended to be read in that way.\nConstructive empiricism is to be understood as a doctrine about what\nthe aim of science is, not a doctrine about what an individual should\nor shouldn’t believe. \nTo make this clear, we can, following van Fraassen (1998, 213), make\nthe following terminological distinction: \nscientific agnostic: someone who believes the science s/he\naccepts to be empirically adequate but does not believe it to be true,\nnor believes it to be false. \nscientific gnostic: someone who believes the science s/he\naccepts to be true. \nIt’s clear, in light of this distinction, that one can be a\nscientific gnostic and a constructive empiricist—one would\nsimply choose to have beliefs that go beyond what science is aiming\nat. There is, of course, a connection between the scientific\nrealist/constructive empiricist dichotomy and the scientific\ngnostic/scientific agnostic dichotomy: \nScientific realists think that the scientific gnostic truly\nunderstands the character of the scientific enterprise, and that the\nscientific agnostic does not. The constructive empiricist thinks that\nthe scientific gnostic may or may not understand the scientific\nenterprise, but that s/he adopts beliefs going beyond what science\nitself involves or requires for its pursuit. (van Fraassen 1998,\n213–214) \nA final point to make about aims is that the constructive empiricist\ndistinguishes between the aim of an individual scientist or group of\nscientists (which may be fame, glory, or what have you) and the aim of\nscience itself. The aim of science determines what counts as success\nin the enterprise of science as such (van Fraassen 1980, 8). Because\nconstructive empiricists do not identify the aim of science with\nwhatever goals the majority of scientists may have, they deny that\nconstructive empiricism is a thesis in sociology subject to the kind\nof empirical confirmation or disconfirmation any scientific thesis\nfaces. Instead, constructive empiricism is to be understood as a\nphilosophical description of science that seeks to explain how an\nempiricist can regard the activity of science as consistent with the\nempiricist’s own standards of rational activity. Like the\ninterpretation of any human activity, constructive empiricism is\nconstrained by the “text” of the scientific activity it\ninterprets. Within those constraints, it succeeds or fails according\nto its ability to provide an interpretation of science that\ncontributes to our understanding of science, making intelligible to us\nvarious elements of its practice. (van Fraassen 1994,\n188–192) \nThe success, then, of constructive empiricism as an account of science\ndoes not depend on how science is understood or undertaken by actual\nscientists. Still, one might start to question the empirical adequacy\nof constructive empiricism’s interpretation of science if the account\nwas dramatically at odds with the attitudes and practices of\nactual scientists. Fortunately, then, for the defender of constructive\nempiricism, recent evidence indicates that is not the case. Based on a\nmethodical survey of practicing scientists, Beebe and Dellsén\n(2020, 359–361) suggest that the attitudes of contemporary scientists\nare largely in line with the constructive empiricist’s views of\ntheory acceptance and science’s aims. \nHere is a rough-and-ready characterization of what it is for a theory\nto be empirically adequate: \nA sufficiently unreflective constructive empiricist might adopt this\nconstrual of empirical adequacy for her theory, but a more\nsophisticated constructive empiricist would probably embrace an\naccount of empirical adequacy akin to that which van Fraassen develops\nlater in The Scientific Image.  \nTo understand that account, one needs first to appreciate the\ndifference between the syntactic view of scientific theories\nand van Fraassen’s preferred semantic view of\nscientific theories. On the syntactic view, a theory is given by an\nenumeration of theorems, expressed in some one particular language. In\ncontrast, on the semantic view, a theory is given by the specification\nof a class of structures (describable in various languages) that are\nthe theory’s models (the determinate structures of which the\ntheory holds true). As van Fraassen says, \nA theory is empirically adequate, then, if\nappearances—“the structures which can be described in\nexperimental and measurement reports” (1980, 64)—are\nisomorphic to the empirical substructures of some model of the theory.\nRoughly speaking, the theory is empirically adequate if the observable\nphenomena can “find a home” within the structures\ndescribed by the theory—that is to say, the observable phenomena\ncan be “embedded” in the theory. See Figure 1 for a\ngraphical illustration of the relations that make a theory empirically\nadequate on van Fraassen’s view, with the cloud shapes\nrepresenting the relata of the isomorphism relation. \nFigure 1. A Theory’s Empirical Adequacy \nThis conception of a theory’s empirical adequacy is arguably\nwhat allows a constructive empiricist to avoid the kind of doxastic\ncommitment Friedman (1982, 278) and Rochefort-Maranda (2011,\n61–62) describe as posing a problem for the constructive\nempiricist (a problem that Rochefort-Maranda subsequently attempts to\nsolve). Here is that problem: \nThe constructive empiricist arguably dissolves this problem by\ninvoking the above conception of empirical adequacy.\n(Rochefort-Maranda gestures in the direction of, but does not\nexplicitly describe, this dissolution in his footnote 1.) Belief that\na theory is empirically adequate amounts to the belief that the\nobservables can be properly embedded in at least one of the\ntheory’s models. Belief in the possibility of that embedding\ndoes not require the constructive empiricist to take the truth of\nsentences about observables to entail the truth of sentences about\nunobservables. By taking a theory to be empirically adequate, the\nconstructive empiricist is simply saying that the phenomena we observe\n(and believe to exist) can exist within the structure the theory\ndescribes, without additionally being committed to saying that the\nunobservable parts of that theoretical structure are parts of the\nactual structure of the world. \nNote that the phenomena relevant to a theory’s empirical\nadequacy are all actual observable phenomena (1980, 12). So\nfor a theory to be empirically adequate, it has to be able to account\nfor more than just the phenomena that have actually been observed and\nthe phenomena that will be observed. See Section 3.4 below for a\ndiscussion of the worry that the constructive empiricist’s\nbelief in the empirical adequacy of her accepted theories thereby\nextends beyond what a bona fide empiricist ought to believe. \nInsofar as the empirical adequacy of a theory amounts to the\nembeddability of observable phenomena within substructures of the\ntheory’s models, the constructive empiricist’s account of\nempirical adequacy rests heavily on the distinction between what is\nobservable and what is not. If, as it is natural to think,‘is\nobservable’ is a vague predicate, we should not expect there to\nbe a precise demarcation between what’s observable and\nwhat’s unobservable. Observability can still serve as a useful\nconcept in the philosophy of science, as long as there are clear cases\nof observability and clear cases of unobservability. \nHere is one rough characterization of observability: \nFor the constructive empiricist, this characterization is “not\nmeant as a definition, but only as a rough guide to the avoidance of\nfallacies” (van Fraassen 1980, 16). It is important to clarify\nthat, as a constructive empiricist would use the terminology, one only\nobserves something when the observation is unaided. One does\nnot see cells through a microscope; instead one sees an image, an\nimage which the scientific gnostic understands one way but the\nscientific agnostic understands a different way. \nNote that the observability of interest is relativized to\n“us,” the members of the epistemic community whose\nscientific theories are the topic of interest. Since what counts as\nobservable is relative to what epistemic community the observer is\npart of, and since the members of that epistemic community are the\nsubject of scientific theory, the constructive empiricist takes what\ncounts as observable as the subject of scientific theory and not\nsomething that can be determined a priori (van Fraassen 1980,\n56–59). Science itself, then, is ultimately the arbiter of what\ncounts as observable. For worries about circularity in the use of\naccepted scientific theory to determine which parts of the world are\nobservable (and hence to determine which theories of science are\nempirically adequate and thereby candidates for acceptance), see\nSection 3.7 below. \nAcceptance has both an epistemic and a pragmatic component. When one\naccepts a theory, one has a belief, and also a commitment. The belief\nis that the theory is empirically adequate. The commitment is “a\ncommitment to the further confrontation of new phenomena within the\nframework of that theory, a commitment to a research programme, and a\nwager that all relevant phenomena can be accounted for without giving\nup that theory” (1980, 88). According to the constructive\nempiricist, this commitment is made at least in part on pragmatic\ngrounds: there is an important role for non-epistemic values in theory\nchoice (van Fraassen 2007, 340). \nFor the constructive empiricist, acceptance comes in degrees. This can\ninfluence how one engages in discourse in the domain of the\ntheory: \nVan Fraassen goes on to explain that acceptance produces contexts\nwhere one engages in discourse “in a context in which language\nuse is guided by that theory.” \nOne reason the constructive empiricist’s account of acceptance\nis important is that it allows us to make sense of scientific\nanti-realists such as constructive empiricists (of the scientific\nagnostic variety) talking as if a particular theory is true. When one\nlooks at scientific discourse, this is what scientists are often\ndoing: they treat a theory as if they fully believe it, and answer\nquestions and give explanations using the resources of the theory. The\nconstructive empiricist can account for this behavior, without\nattributing full belief in the theory to the scientists, by describing\nthe scientists as merely accepting, without fully believing, the\ntheories they develop (van Fraassen 1980, 81–82). \nThe constructive empiricist can acknowledge that scientific realists\nalso recognize that there is a pragmatic dimension to theory\nacceptance. But “because the amount of belief involved in\nacceptance is typically less according to anti-realists, they will\ntend to make more of the pragmatic aspects” (van Fraassen 1980,\n13). \nBefore turning to stronger arguments for constructive empiricism, it\nwill be helpful to draw attention to a couple scientific anti-realist\narguments that the constructive empiricist would be well-advised not\nto use in support of her view. \nFirst, consider the Argument from Underdetermination. This argument\nstarts by pointing out that for any theory, there are rival theories\nthat are empirically equivalent to it—the theories make all the\nsame predictions about what’s observable, but differ only with\nregard to what’s unobservable. The argument goes on to say that\nit follows that all the empirically equivalent theories are equally\nbelievable, and hence belief in the truth of any one of those\nempirically equivalent theories must be irrational. \nWhile the constructive empiricist view is a view about the aims of\nscience and not a normative theory in epistemology, the constructive\nempiricist is an individual who values the sort of epistemic modesty\nwhich might motivate one to harbor anti-realist sympathies in general.\nTo the extent that the constructive empiricist embraces epistemic\nmodesty, she might also be an epistemic voluntarist, a person who\nbelieves that “rationality is only bridled irrationality”\n(van Fraassen 1989, 172). Any behavior that does not make one\ninconsistent or incoherent is rational, by the voluntarist’s\nlights. Such an attitude might seem the natural epistemic one for the\nconstructive empiricist to hold, insofar as the constructive\nempiricist is impressed by the cognitive limits that prevent us from\nhaving conclusive evidence in favor of any one particular theory. \nOne reason the constructive empiricist would be well-advised not to\nembrace the Argument from Underdetermination, then, is that it goes\nagainst a voluntarist position in epistemology. (This point is clearly\nmade by Van Dyck 2007, 19–22, and agreed to by van Fraassen\n2007, 347.) By the voluntarist’s reckoning, going beyond the\nevidence to the extent that one chooses to believe in the truth of a\ntheory, both in its observable and unobservable aspects, could very\nwell be rational. \nThe relatively permissive epistemological view of a constructive\nempiricist who is also an epistemic voluntarist helps explain why such\na constructive empiricist would be prudent not to take constructive\nempiricism to be a normative theory concerning the deliverances of\nscience. Mistakenly understood in that normative way, constructive\nempiricism would imply that belief in a theory’s empirical\nadequacy is the only rational candidate for the belief involved in a\ntheory’s acceptance. Such a constraint on the rationality of\nopinion is clearly at odds with any epistemic voluntarism the\nconstructive empiricist might embrace. \nGideon Rosen (1994, 160–161) gives another reason that the\nconstructive empiricist ought not accept underdetermination arguments\nas grounds for constructive empiricism. Consider the following two\nhypotheses: \nAs Rosen notes, one’s current evidence does not tell in favor of\neither hypothesis over the other. So by an underdetermination-style\nargument, one is not justified in believing either hypothesis. But\nbelief in (A) is the belief the constructive empiricist contends is\ninvolved in theory acceptance. (For more on how one might take\nRosen’s argument as an argument against constructive empiricism,\nsee Section 3.4 below.) \nThe second scientific anti-realist argument a person would be\nwell-advised not to use in support of constructive empiricism is the\nPessimistic Induction Argument. This argument points out that\nscientific theories in the past have been shown to be false, so by\ninduction, we should think that current theories are false, too. If\nthis argument is taken to have the conclusion that belief in our\ncurrent theories is irrational, then, as above, the argument is\nincompatible with any voluntarism the constructive empiricist might\nembrace. The argument is also incompatible with the view of a\nconstructive empiricist who, in the skeptical spirit of anti-realist\nviews in general, rejects reasoning based on a principle of induction.\nVan Fraassen, for instance, writes: “I do not think that there\nis such a thing as Induction, in any form” (2007, 343). \nSo how might one argue for constructive empiricism? One argument for\nconstructive empiricism hinges on the fact that belief in the\nempirical adequacy of a theory is less epistemically audacious than\nbelief in the truth of the theory. Both beliefs, of course, go beyond\nthe evidence: \nSo why is belief that a theory is empirically adequate preferable to\nthe belief that the theory is true? Van Fraassen famously and pithily\nputs the point as follows: \nit is not an epistemological principle that one might as well hang for\na sheep as for a lamb. (1980, 73) \nThe constructive empiricist rejects arguments that suggest that one is\nrationally obligated to believe in the truth of a theory, given that\none believes in the empirical adequacy of the theory. \nFor this epistemological argument to work, the distinction between\nempirical adequacy and truth has to be well-founded. A significant\npart of The Scientific Image is devoted to that task. As\ndescribed in Section 1.6, the constructive empiricist argues that one\ncan make sense of the observable/unobservable distinction, even if\nobservation is theory-laden. (If the distinction between observables\nand unobservables didn’t make sense, the concept of empirical\nadequacy would be incoherent.) \nRosen (1994, 161–163), as well as Monton and van Fraassen (2003,\n407–408), offers an additional rationale for the constructive\nempiricist’s embrace of empirical adequacy rather than truth as\nthe hallmark of the belief component of theory acceptance. One might\nreasonably think of belief in the empirical adequacy of accepted\ntheories as the weakest attitude one can attribute to scientists at\nthe same time that one is still able to make sense of their scientific\nactivity. At the same time, belief in the empirical adequacy of a\ntheory is sufficiently cautious as to allow the believer to remain\nfaithful to the spirit of empiricism. Thus, constructive empiricism is\na view which allows one to regard the activity of science as activity\nthe empiricist can safely endorse. \nOne worry for the constructive empiricist is that theory acceptance\ncan be had under conditions that do not require belief in the\nempirical adequacy of the accepted theories. As Healey 2019 points\nout, scientists appreciate that many of our best scientific theories\nare not able properly to account for all the observable phenomena they\nare meant to account for; the theories are not, in fact, entirely\nempirically adequate. Scientists nevertheless accept those theories:\nthey treat them as working hypotheses to use in the undertaking of\ntheir work, and (as van Fraassen 1980, 88, suggests) the scientists\nare committed to confronting new empirical phenomena in the framework\nthose theories offer. If, then, we understand theory acceptance in the\nway the constructive empiricist does, we must take the scientists’\nacceptance of these theories as misplaced, since the scientists do not\nbelieve the theories to be empirically adequate. \nOne initial response the constructive empiricist might offer to this\nchallenge is the following: if the scientists truly believe the\ntheories to be empirically inadequate, they are not actually accepting\nthe theories, after all. A more sophisticated reply the constructive\nempiricist might give invokes the recognition that, as § 1.7\nabove notes, acceptance comes in degrees and has a pragmatic element.\nThe constructive empiricist can allow that a scientist (mostly)\naccepts a theory, insofar as:  \nthe scientist believes that many/most of the observable phenomena it\ndescribes can be embedded in the theory’s substructures, and \nthe scientist is fairly strongly committed to using the theory as the\nbasis for the scientist’s research program. \nThe satisfaction of (1) and (2) suffice for the scientist to accept\nthe theory to a high degree, even if the scientist does not accept the\ntheory in a categorical, unqualified way. As van Fraassen himself\nacknowledges, it is only unqualified acceptance of a theory\nthat involves the belief that the theory is empirically adequate\n(1998, 213). \nAny tendency we might have to think scientists do fully accept\ntheories may simply be the result of the social role the scientists\nplay as explainers of those theories (as also noted in § 1.7\nabove). In that role, the scientists “answer questions ex\ncathedra ” (van Fraassen 2007, 12), in a manner that the\nunsophisticated listener might mistakenly perceive as a display of\nunqualified confidence in and acceptance of the theories’ empirical\nadequacy. The reality is more subtle—the acceptance is almost\nalways a qualified one.  \nIn any case, even if there is disagreement about how fully scientists\naccept theories, the above reflections suggest that the constructive\nempiricist’s position on theory acceptance is vindicated: the\ndegree to which scientists accept a theory is plausibly correlated\nwith the degree to which they believe the theory to be empirically\nadequate. \nThe constructive empiricist argues that constructive empiricism\n“makes better sense of science, and of scientific activity, than\nrealism does” (van Fraassen 1980, 73). The constructive\nempiricist can be understood as giving two arguments for this claim;\nthe first argument will be presented here, and the second argument\nwill be presented in the next subsection. \nConstructive empiricists might maintain that, for working scientists,\nthe real importance of scientific theories is that they are a factor\nin experimental design. They contrast this with the traditional\npicture presented by philosophy of science. According to the\ntraditional picture, the main goal of scientific practice is to\ndiscern the fundamental structure of the world, and experimentation\nsimply is used to determine whether theories should be taken to be\ntrue, and hence as contributing to our knowledge of the fundamental\nstructure. The constructive empiricist, in contrast, suggests that the\nreason a scientist turns to a theory is that experimental design is\ndifficult, and theories are needed to guide experimental inquiry. But\nwhat scientists are really aiming to discover, according to the\nconstructive empiricist, are “facts about the world—about\nthe regularities in the observable part of the world” (van\nFraassen 1980, 73). \nVan Fraassen argues for this position in part by describing\nMillikan’s famous experiment measuring the charge of the\nelectron. Scientific realists take this experiment to be making a\ndiscovery about the nature of the unobservable entities known as\nelectrons. Van Fraassen, in contrast, presents the experiment as\n“filling in a value for a quantity which, in the construction of\nthe theory, was so far left open” (1980, 77). In doing the\nexperiment, Millikan was discovering a regularity in the observable\npart of the world, and was providing a value for a quantity in atomic\ntheory. Millikan need not be understood as discovering something about\nthe nature of unobservable objects in the world. Van Fraassen says\nthat in a case like Millikan’s, \nAnother way in which, according to the constructive empiricist,\nconstructive empiricism makes better sense of science than realism\ndoes has to do with theory choice. Some virtues that scientists see in\ntheories are pragmatic virtues, not epistemic virtues. This shows that\nscientists are choosing between theories using criteria other than\ntruth. \nWhat virtues are pragmatic? Here is what van Fraassen says: \nSome scientific realists might hold that some of these are epistemic\nvirtues, not pragmatic virtues. With regard to simplicity, the\nconstructive empiricist can recognize that scientific realists\nsometimes hold that simpler theories are more likely to be true, but\nat the same time the constructive empiricist can contend that \nWith regard to explanation, constructive empiricists recognize that\nscientific realists typically attach an objective validity to requests\nfor explanation (van Fraassen 1980, 13), but constructive empiricists\ndo not grant that objective validity. Van Fraassen’s arguments\nthat explanation is pragmatic constitute a significant part of The\nScientific Image, and will be discussed in the next\nsubsection. \nConstructive empiricists recognize that these pragmatic factors like\nsimplicity and explanatory power are important guides in the pursuit\nof the aim of science (van Fraassen 1980, 89). But they insist that\nthese factors are valuable in that pursuit only insofar as their\nconsideration advances the development of theories that are\nempirically adequate and empirically strong. The factors do not have\nspecial value as indicators of the truth of what the theories say\nabout the unobservable parts of the world. \nScientific realists, by contrast, sometimes say that they believe in\nthe truth of scientific theories because the theories provide a\nsatisfying explanation of the observable phenomena, an explanation\nthat unifies what would otherwise be disparate observations. The\nconstructive empiricist is not moved by such considerations: \nIndeed, one can recognize the explanatory power of a theory without\ntaking it to be true. Van Fraassen points out that theories can\nexplain well even if they are false. Newton’s theory of\ngravitation explains the motion of the planets and the tides,\n“Huygens’s theory explained the diffraction of light,\nRutherford’s theory of the atom explained the scattering of\nalpha particles, Bohr’s theory explained the hydrogen spectrum,\nLorentz’s theory explained clock retardation.” But none of\nthese theories is now thought to be true. \nFor the constructive empiricist, the explanatory power of a theory\namounts to nothing more than the theory’s ability to provide\ncertain bits of information in response to contextually defined\nqueries. Scientific explanation amounts to the highlighting of various\naspects of the structure postulated by the theory, to answer, in a\ncontextually dependent way, various questions of interest to us (van\nFraassen 1980, 124). Science, then, contributes nothing to explanation\nover and above the descriptive and informative content of the\nscientific theory: “a success of explanation is a success of\nadequate and informative description” (van Fraassen 1980,\n156–157). Explanation cannot be reduced to that content, though,\nsince explanation cannot occur unless an appropriate question, offered\nin a particular context, is provided. Explanation thus goes beyond\nwhat science reveals to us. The constructive empiricist can hence\navoid saddling scientists with a commitment to the unobservable\nentities invoked in such explanations, properly claiming that such\ncommitments are not licensed by the activity of science. (See Kitcher\n& Salmon 1987 for the view that even if requests for explanation\nare contextually delimited, what counts as a good / relevant\nexplanation depends also on non-contextual factors.) \nA fair portion of the constructive empiricist’s account of\nscientific explanation is thus devoted to an explication of the\ncontextual dependence of explanation. Among other reasons given in\nfavor of that contextual dependence, van Fraassen points out that\nexplanations are typically causal in character—they attempt to\nsituate the event-to-be-explained in the “causal net”\npostulated by the scientific theory. Which events in that net are\npicked out as “the” cause(s) of some event-to-be-explained\ndepend upon the interests of the individuals asking the explanatory\nquestion (1980, 124–126). \nExplanation will frequently involve the invocation of counterfactuals,\noften of the form: if event B had not occurred, neither would event A\nhave (van Fraassen 1980, 118). That’s because (as just noted)\nexplanations are frequently causal in character, and analyses of\ncausation typically invoke some sort of counterfactual. Another\ncomponent of the constructive empiricist’s efforts at showing\nexplanation to be context-dependent, then, amounts to his exposition\nof the context dependence of counterfactuals. \nVan Fraassen points out that any counterfactual has a ceteris paribus\nclause, but what is “being kept equal” by the asserter of\nthe counterfactual varies from context to context. For example,\nconsider the counterfactual, “If Tom were to light the fuse,\nthere would be an explosion.” If the ceteris paribus clause of\nthe speaker keeps constant the fact that the fuse leads to a barrel of\ngunpowder, and the fact that lit fuses leading to barrels of gunpowder\ntypically result in explosions, then the counterfactual would, in that\ncontext, be true. If, on the other hand, the ceteris paribus clause of\nthe speaker also kept constant the fact that Tom is generally paranoid\nabout explosions around barrels of gunpowder and fuses, and would only\nlight the fuse if he had disconnected the fuse from the barrel, then\nthe counterfactual would, in that context, be false (1980, 116). Until\nthe context that fixes the ceteris paribus clause is specified, we\ncannot say what the truth value of the counterfactual in question is.\nOnly once the context is determined does the counterfactual admit of\nan objective truth value. \nOne of the reasons the constructive empiricist highlights the context\ndependence of explanation is that she wishes to show how efforts at\nexplaining various parts of the world extend beyond the activity of\nscience. Since, for instance, the propositions of science are not\ncontext-dependent in character, but the counterfactuals involved in\nexplanation are, we have reason to think that explanation involves\nsomething more than the descriptive information science gives us:\nnamely, the context-dependent interests of the individual seeking an\nexplanation in answer to some question. Also, if (as seems likely) the\nconcept of a law of nature has to be understood in a counterfactual\nway, counterfactuals’ context-dependence implies that those\nlaws, too, go beyond what science reveals to us (van Fraassen 1980,\n118). \nIt should be clear here, then, that the constructive\nempiricist’s efforts at showing explanatory efforts to extend\nbeyond the activity of science are part of an effort to show that the\nscientific realist is mistaken in thinking that science gives us\nreason to think that claims about causation, laws of nature, and other\ncounterfactuals represent objective, context-independent truths about\nthe world. \nScientific realists might point out that constructive empiricists do\nallow that explanatory power can count as a pragmatic virtue of a\ntheory (van Fraassen 1980, 89). But, one might naturally think, no\nscientist can acknowledge the explanatory power of a theory without\ntaking the theory to be true. So, continues the scientific realist,\nthe constructive empiricist cannot admit the usefulness of explanatory\npower to the scientist without also regarding the scientist as taking\nher theories to be true. \nThe constructive empiricist disagrees. Among other reasons, she can\ncite the earlier mentioned explanatory power of false theories.\nAdditionally, the constructive empiricist might insist that use of a\ntheory need not entail a commitment to the theory’s entire\nontology. A person offering an explanation speaks from within the\nlanguage of the theory she accepts. Consistent with that acceptance,\nshe is “conceptually immersed” within the theory. But such\nuse of language need not reflect the individual’s epistemic\ncommitment, which may be merely to take the theory to be empirically\nadequate (van Fraassen 1980, 151–152). So, for instance, talk of\npossibility and necessity can be thought of not as talk about some\nobjective modality in nature, but as talk of what phenomena fit in the\nmodels of the accepted theory (van Fraassen 1980, 201–202).\n‘X is possible’ can be interpreted as\n‘X appears in some model of the theory,’ while\n‘X is necessary’ can be read as ‘X\nappears in every model of the theory.’ Again, the constructive\nempiricist sees the scientist as “immersing” herself in\nthe world of the theory, talking as if the theory were true, with\nlanguage reflecting the structure of the theory. But she need not take\nthe theory’s modal structure to correspond to any in\nreality. \nWe can see in the above discussion of the pragmatics of explanation\nwhy the constructive empiricist thinks constructive empiricism can\nhelp us to make sense of science “without inflationary\nmetaphysics” (van Fraassen 1980, 73). By “inflationary\nmetaphysics,” van Fraassen has in mind the scientific\nrealists’ typical beliefs in, for example, laws of nature,\nnatural kinds, and objective modality. \nThe constructive empiricist recognizes that believing in empirical\nadequacy involves sticking our necks out, just as believing in truth\ndoes; nonetheless, \nScientific realists might not be moved by this consideration, because\nthey might not see any problem with inflationary metaphysics. The\npoint of The Scientific Image, according to van Fraassen, was\nto answer the question: what should an empiricist think about science?\nSince an empiricist would want to avoid inflationary metaphysics, this\nconsideration would move them to favor constructive empiricism. The\nquestion of why one would want to be an empiricist is taken up in van\nFraassen’s 2002 book, The Empirical Stance. \nOne way that the constructive empiricist might indirectly support\nconstructive empiricism is by taking issue with Hilary Putnam’s\nmiracle argument for scientific realism. This argument holds that\nscientific realism “is the only philosophy that doesn’t\nmake the success of science a miracle” (Putnam 1975, 73). Putnam\ngoes on to argue that the statements that a scientific realist would\nmake about our mature scientific theories are “part of the only\nscientific explanation of the success of science.” To give an\nadequate scientific description of science, scientific realism needs\nto be assumed. \nPutnam’s basic idea is as follows: if the scientific theories\nare false, why would they be so successful? Van Fraassen famously\nreplies with an evolutionary analogy: \nVan Fraassen’s point is that a theory can be empirically\nadequate, and hence latch on to the observable regularities in nature,\nwithout being true. The scientific competition between theories hinges\non which theory accurately describes the observable world; it does not\nhinge on which theory is actually true. Thus, it would not be\nmiraculous for science to arrive at an empirically adequate,\nscientifically successful, yet false theory. (See the discussion of\nthe Miracle Argument in the entry on\n scientific realism\n for more on the miracle argument as a consideration in favor of\nscientific realism.) \nInference to the Best Explanation is the controversial rule of\ninference which basically holds that, out of the class of potential\nexplanations we have of some phenomena, we should infer that the best\nexplanation is the true one. If Inference to the Best Explanation is a\nrule we do (or ought) to follow, then it looks as if scientific\nrealism is an accurate description (or prescription) of the aims of\nscience—we should acknowledge the reality of the entities our\nbest explanatory theories postulate, even if those entities are\nunobservable. \nThe constructive empiricist might offer several responses to this\nchallenge: \nIn sum, because the constructive empiricist rejects Inference to the\nBest Explanation, she is not moved by arguments for scientific realism\nthat make use of that rule of inference. (See the discussion of\nskepticism about inference to the best explanation in the entry on\n scientific realism\n for an elaboration of doubts about the use of inference to the best\nexplanation as a motivating consideration in favor of scientific\nrealism.) \nA standard type of objection to constructive empiricism, one that was\nespecially prevalent soon after The Scientific Image was\npublished, is the type of objection that takes issue with the clarity\nor cogency of the observable/unobservable distinction. A few examples\nof this type of objection will be presented in this section, along\nwith constructive empiricist replies. \nBy the constructive empiricist’s lights, distant macroscopic\nobjects are observable, since if we were nearby we could see them.\nPaul Churchland (1985, 39–40) takes issue with the importance\nthe constructive empiricist attaches to size, as opposed to\nspatiotemporal proximity. Churchland points out that it is just a\ncontingent fact that humans have control over their spatiotemporal\nlocation, but not over their size. Churchland concludes that the\ndistinction between things that are unobserved but observable, and\nthings that are unobservable, “is only very feebly principled\nand is wholly inadequate to bear the great weight that van Fraassen\nputs on it” (Churchland 1985, 40). \nVan Fraassen replies with the recognition that “scientific\nrealists tend to feel baffled by the idea that our opinion about the\nlimits of perception should play a role in arriving at our epistemic\nattitudes toward science” (1985, 258). Constructive empiricists\nare not asserting any metaphysical difference in the world on the\nbasis of the observable/unobservable distinction; they are just saying\nthat that distinction is relevant to the epistemic attitudes we take.\nSince “experience is the sole legitimate source of information\nabout the world” (van Fraassen 1985, 258), it makes sense that\nwhat we can experience influences our epistemic attitudes. (Note that\nin his 2002 book The Empirical Stance, van Fraassen calls\ninto question his 1985 statement about experience.) \nA different argument by Churchland (1985, 44–45) asks what the\nconstructive empiricist would say about beings who are like us except\nthat they are born with electron microscopes permanently attached to\ntheir left eyes. Churchland says that the electron-microscope-eye\nhumanoids would count viruses as part of their ontology, and yet by\nthe constructive empiricist’s lights we can’t, even though\nwe are functionally the same as the humanoids when we put our left eye\nagainst the viewfinder of an electron microscope. \nThe constructive empiricist might reply that we are not warranted in\nsaying that the humanoids have the experience of viruses\nunless we already treat the humanoids as being part of our epistemic\ncommunity (van Fraassen 1985, 256–257). If we do expand our\nepistemic community to include them, then the constructive empiricist\nis happy to say that in that situation viruses are observable. But if\nwe do not accept them as part of our epistemic community, then we will\nsimply analyze them as like us, except having electron microscopes\nattached to themselves, and we will say that they are “reliable\nindicators of whatever the usual combination of human with electron\nmicroscope reliably indicates” (van Fraassen 1985, 257). In that\ncase the extension of ‘observable’ is unchanged. \nAnother argument calling into question the significance of the\nobservable/unobservable distinction is presented by Ian Hacking (1985,\n146–147). Hacking considers a machine which makes grids of the\nsame shape but various sizes. We can see grids with the same overall\nshape of smaller and smaller size, but the machine makes some grids\nthat are too small to be seen with the unaided eye. When looked at\nthrough a microscope, however, the unobservable grids are seen to have\nthe same shape as the observable ones. Hacking writes: \nHacking concludes that it would be unreasonable to be an anti-realist\nabout the unobservable grid, and hence we should at least sometimes\nbelieve what science tells us about unobservables. \nVan Fraassen (1985, 298) replies by pointing out an unwarranted\nsupposition in Hacking’s argument: the claim that we made the\ngrid to be that way implies what is under dispute, that the grid was\nsuccessfully made to be that way. Regarding the argument that, if\ndifferent types of microscopes make similar observations, then the\nobservations must be veridical, van Fraassen replies that that\nargument \nBut this is a premise that the constructive empiricist rejects. \nHere van Fraassen is allowing for the possibility that the\nconstructive empiricist can reasonably be agnostic about the grid. Van\nFraassen replies in a similar fashion to an objection that Paul Teller\nputs forth about the immediacy of objects viewed through a\nmicroscope. \nTeller (2007) claims that the images produced by many scientific\ninstruments require some interpretative effort for us to make\nassertions about what it is that we are seeing. What we see through\noptical microscopes, on the other hand, is importantly different. In\nsuch an observation, we take ourselves to see the object being\nmagnified itself, immediately and without interpretative effort. \nThe conclusion Teller draws is that contrary to what van Fraassen\nclaims, what is observable extends beyond what members of our\nepistemic community can observe unaided by measuring instruments. What\nis observable minimally also includes the objects viewed through\noptical microscopes, as well as other objects whose observation is\nsimilarly unmediated by interpretation (132–134). \nIn reply, van Fraassen (2001) suggests that what we see through a\nmicroscope is akin to reflections seen in mirrors and other reflective\nsurfaces—the reflection of a tree in a body of water, for\ninstance. In both the case of the observation via the microscope and\nthe object viewed in a reflection, we might assert that what we are\nseeing is a real object. But van Fraassen points out an important\ndifference between the reflected object and our observation through\nthe microscope. We are confident that the reflection is of a real\nobject because we can observe certain invariances between the object\npurportedly being observed (the tree), the reflective image, and our\nvantage point. We can, for instance, see that the tree maintains a\ncertain fixed position relative to the reflective body, and we can see\nthat the angle subtended by the lines between us and the two bodies is\na particular function of the observer’s position. The\nobservation of these invariances is possible, in part, because the\ntree is itself observable without the aid of instruments (van Fraassen\n2001, 160). \nThat, however, is not true of the objects—the paramecia,\nsay—that are purportedly being observed through the microscope.\nBecause the paramecia are not directly observable without instruments,\nwe can only hypothesize that there are objects being observed for\nwhich the invariant geometric relations hold. It is possible for us,\nthen, to maintain an agnosticism about the paramecia that we\ncan’t about the tree (160). We can regard our observations via\nthe microscope the same way we regard our observations of\nrainbows—namely, as observations of phenomena that are public\n(even capable of being captured by photographic equipment) without at\nthe same time being observations of some existent object (162). (We\nsay that the rainbow is not an actual physical object because it does\nnot participate in the invariant geometric relations we expect of\nactual physical objects: “If the rainbow were a thing, the\nvarious observations and photos would all locate it in the same place\nin space, at any given time” (157) ). \nAlspector-Kelly (2004) claims that there is not the difference\ndescribed here between aided and unaided perception. If the\nconstructive empiricist insists that rainbows, reflections, and the\nlike constitute publicly observable phenomena despite not amounting to\nactually existing objects, then what we experience in the case of\nunaided veridical perception is also some kind of image-like\nobservable phenomena: \nIf this is true, then unaided veridical perception is not\ndistinguished from aided perception in the way van Fraassen suggests.\nUnaided veridical perception is as much mediated by image-like\nobservable phenomena as aided perception is. \nAs we will see in §3.6, the constructive empiricist might\nnaturally express skepticism, in the case of unaided veridical\nperception, about the existence of anything like image-like phenomena.\nKusch (2015) points out one reason for skepticism: the phenomena in\nquestion exhibit fewer of the invariant relations—“unlike,\nsay, rainbows, visual experience cannot be photographed”\n(177)—that would allow us to characterize the phenomena as\npublic, verifiable ones capable of empirical study. \nA constructive empiricist might also respond to Alspector-Kelly by\nadvocating something like a disjunctivist view of perception, denying\nthat what is observed in the disparate cases really is the same. On\nsuch a view, unaided veridical perception really is of actual physical\nobjects, whereas perception with instrumentation results only in the\nexperience of some kind of publicly observable phenomena akin to\nrainbows and reflections. It remains to be seen whether independent\nmotivation for such a view can help recommend it over the alternative\noffered by the defender of microscopic observables. \nAccording to the constructive empiricist, “there is no purely\nepistemic warrant for going beyond our evidence” (van Fraassen\n2007, 343). But then why does the constructive empiricist hold that\nthe aim of science involves going beyond our evidence? Empiricism\nwants to be epistemically modest, but belief that a theory is\nempirically adequate goes well beyond the deliverances of experience.\nHence, one can object to constructive empiricism by suggesting that it\nis not sufficiently epistemically modest: the doctrine that the aim of\nscience is truth about what is observable should be replaced with the\ndoctrine that the aim of science is truth about what’s actually\nbeen observed. (For versions of this criticism, see for example\nGutting 1985, Railton 1990, Rosen 1994, and Alspector-Kelly 2001.) \nThe constructive empiricist’s reply, as presented by Monton and\nvan Fraassen (2003, 407–408), is as follows. Constructive\nempiricism incorporates a prior commitment to the rationality of\nscience—it is a doctrine about what the aim of science actually\nis; it is not attempting to present a revisionary account of how\nscience should be done. According to the doctrine that the aim of\nscience is truth about what’s been observed, \nThe constructive empiricist can hence conclude that the doctrine that\nthe aim of science is truth about what’s been observed\n“fails to capture our idea of what it is to do good\nscience” (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 407). \nSo the constructive empiricist is firm in her construal of the aim of\nscience as truth about the observable. One might worry, though, as\nJames Ladyman (2000) does, that such a view brings with it a\ncommitment to modal realism and belief in whatever entities such a\ncommitment may require. So, for instance, talk of observability might\ncommit the constructive empiricist to belief in the existence of\npossible worlds, a commitment that an empiricist would prefer not to\nmake. \nTo understand why one might think this way, consider the following. As\nnoted in section 1.6 above, one natural way of understanding\n“x is observable” is in the following\ncounterfactual manner: \nIf the truth conditions of counterfactuals are understood in terms of\npossible worlds, it is easy to see how beliefs about what is\nobservable entail commitments to the existence of such worlds. \nOne reply to this threat of modal realism is that contrary to the\ninitial impression provided by the counterfactual characterization of\nobservability, observability is not a modal property, after all\n(Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 411). As explained in section 2.5\nabove, van Fraassen takes the truth of counterfactuals to be\ncontext-dependent. Once a context is fixed, counterfactuals can be\nexpressed as non-modal conditionals. In the case of the\ncounterfactuals that explicate observability, then, fixing the\nepistemic community of the “suitably constituted observer”\ntransforms the counterfactuals into straightforward non-modal\nconditionals whose truth or lack thereof we can empirically\ninvestigate (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 413–414). Belief in\nthe truth of some claim of the form ’x is observable’\namounts simply to belief in the truth of such a context-fixed,\nnon-modal conditional. \nWhether such conditionals are true is an empirical question to which\nour best scientific theories may provide an answer. So even though\nobservability represents some objective, theory-independent property\nof the world (van Fraassen 1980, 57), we can use our best scientific\ntheories to answer the question, “What is observable?”\n(Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 415–416): \nFor worries about methodological circularity in using our accepted\ntheories to supply facts about observability—facts that bear on\nthe theories’ own empirical adequacy—see section 3.7\nbelow. \nOne additional worry about Monton and van Fraassen’s non-modal\ncharacterization of observability is given by Ladyman (2004). Consider\nthe claim ‘x is observable’ for some x that\nis never actually observed. Ladyman asserts that no empirical\ninvestigation will be sufficient to establish the truth of the\nrelevant non-modal conditional “unless we take it that the\nspecification by science of some regularities among the actual facts\nas laws … is latching onto objective features of the\nworld” (Ladyman 2004, 762). As Ladyman sees it, only objectively\nexisting laws, and not pragmatically selected empirical regularities,\ncan underwrite claims about the observability of objects never\nactually observed. \nPaul Dicken (2007) offers another promising way for the constructive\nempiricist to resist the threat of a commitment to modal realism that\nis posed by talk of observability. He suggests that the constructive\nempiricist take the same attitude toward the truth of observability\ncounterfactuals that she takes toward other claims of endorsed\nscientific theories: namely, acceptance of the counterfactuals rather\nthan belief in them (608). \nIndeed, given that observability is itself supposed to be a subject of\nscientific theory (as noted above), acceptance is the natural attitude\nfor a constructive empiricist to take toward the counterfactuals that\nexplicate observability. She relies on those counterfactuals in the\nway she relies on the other elements of the theories she accepts, even\n(in certain contexts) talking as if the counterfactuals are true. In\nthis way, according to Dicken, she can make use of claims about what\nis observable while at the same time being agnostic about possible\nworlds whose existence is purportedly entailed by the truth of the\ncounterfactuals explicating observability. \nAn objection related to the one from section 3.4 is the following. The\nconstructive empiricist errs not just in believing claims about what\nis unobservable-but-not-actually-observed, but also in believing\nclaims about actually observed entities the likes of macroscopic\nphysical objects. If one really takes to heart the advice that\none’s beliefs should not extend beyond one’s evidence,\nthen one should limit belief to claims about the mental experiences\nthat one is having. \nA constructive empiricist might reply to the objection as follows: \nAs noted in Section 1.6 above, the constructive empiricist says that\nwhat counts as observable is relative to who the observer is and what\nepistemic community that observer is part of. Since the observer is\nher- or himself the subject of scientific theory, what counts as\nobservable is also the subject of scientific theory. Here are two\nworries about the use of scientific theory as the determiner of\nobservability: \nRelativity: If a theory of observability determines\nwhat is observable, and empirical adequacy is assessed in terms of\nwhat is observable, then a theory of observability can name the terms\nof its own empirical adequacy. Empirical adequacy becomes radically\nrelative. With no objective, theory-independent constraints on\nempirical adequacy, it’s “anything goes” when it\ncomes to theory acceptance: one simply adopts the theory of\nobservability that underwrites the empirical adequacy of whichever\ntheory one is interested in accepting. \nCircularity: if scientific theory is the arbiter of\nobservability, then an individual has no choice but to use the theory\nof observability she accepts as a guide to observability, and hence as\na guide to empirical adequacy, and hence as a guide to whether or not\nto accept that very theory. But to use the theory as a guide to\nwhether or not to accept that theory involves the individual in\nepistemic circularity. \nThe constructive empiricist might reply to Relativity by insisting\nthat while we must look to science for an account of observability,\nobservability is not a theory-dependent notion. What counts as\nobservable is an objective, theory-independent fact. So there’s\nno danger of relativism about empirical adequacy (van Fraassen 1980,\n57–58). \nThis response only addresses Relativity; the objectivity of\nobservability does not save us from the epistemic circularity that\ncomes about from our having to use a theory of observability as the\nstandard of empirical adequacy by which we assess that theory’s\nown empirical adequacy. The epistemic circularity has to do with how\nwe come to certain beliefs about observability, not with the\nobjectivity of the observability facts. \nIf such circularity were avoidable, then it would be good for us to\navoid it. Unfortunately for us, the constructive empiricist might say,\nit is not avoidable (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 415–416,\nmaintains this line). Advocates of constructive empiricism might\ninsist that any search for a Cartesian-style guarantee of the\ncorrectness of our theory of observability is a search in vain. We\nhave to accept some such theory, imperfect though it may be, and\nmodify our acceptance if experience proves that acceptance to be\nmisplaced. \nThe Hermeneutic Circle objection was prefaced on the claim that what\ncounts as observable is, according to the constructive empiricist,\ndetermined by scientific theory. Another worry based on that\npresupposition, raised by Alspector-Kelly (2004), is that scientific\ntheory determines much more to be observable than the constructive\nempiricist typically allows. On Alspector-Kelly’s view, we\nshould countenance as observable whatever science says we can have\nreliable information about on the basis of perceptual experience, and\nscience says we can have reliable information about what is\nperceptually revealed to us via microscopes. \nIn response to Alspector-Kelly, Kusch (2015) insists that the\nconstructive empiricist can rely on science to determine what counts\nas observable, without at the same time countenancing the\nmicroscopic as observable. That’s because “the phenomenon\nof naked-eye observation calls for one (kind of) theory; the\nphenomenon of instrumentally-aided eye-use calls for at least two\n(kinds of) theories: the theory covering naked-eye observation and\ntheories of the instrument and its interaction with our naked\neyes” (179). As noted earlier, constructive empiricists value\nepistemic modesty. If a constructive empiricist can rely on science to\ngive us an account of the kind of unaided observation in which all\nscience is grounded, without at the same time having to make use of\nscientific theories that go farther afield, then by the constructive\nempiricist’s lights, that more modest invocation of science is\nto be preferred in deciding the question of observability. \nRosen (1994, 164–169) contends that a scientist cannot remain\nfaithful both to the epistemic standards of the empiricist at the same\ntime that she accepts various scientific theories in the way that the\nconstructive empiricist describes. If what Rosen says is correct, then\nconstructive empiricism fails as an explanation of how a committed\nempiricist can endorse the activity of science as rational. \nRosen’s argument goes as follows. Using the terminology of van\nFraassen’s semantic view of theories (described in Sec. 1.5\nabove), Rosen says an individual believing a theory to be empirically\nadequate \nIndeed, we would naturally suspect that a constructive empiricist\nwould suspend belief about the existence of abstract objects,\nwhich are unobservable entities if anything is. So it looks as if an\nempiricist cannot accept any scientific theories, if acceptance\namounts to what the constructive empiricist says it does. \nOne possible response the constructive empiricist might give here is a\nfictionalist account of mathematical objects. Embracing such a\nfictionalist view, an individual could use the theoretical apparatus\nof mathematics without committing herself to the existence of the\nobjects that are the alleged subject matter of mathematical theories.\nRosen (1994) considers this response but contends that it is not one\nthat a constructive empiricist may want to accept. The problem, Rosen\nsays, is that to embrace fictionalism about a theory T that\none accepts commits one to believing claims of the following form: \nSuch a counterfactual-involving belief appears to commit the believer\nto the truth of certain modal facts, a commitment eschewed by the\ntypical Hume-inspired empiricist. Perhaps the constructive empiricist\ncan view the relevant counterfactuals as reducible to non-modal\nconditionals, in the spirit of the context-dependent reduction of\ncounterfactuals to non-modal conditionals entertained in section 3.5\nabove. If such a reduction can be successfully undertaken, the\nconstructive empiricist can avoid commitment to belief in the truth of\nthe relevant modal facts. \nWhether the constructive empiricist would ultimately want to endorse\nsome fictionalist view about mathematical objects is an open question.\nFor an attempt at developing a constructive empiricist philosophy of\nmathematics, see Bueno 1999. \nRowbottom (2019) contends that it would be wrong to characterize the\ndisagreement between the constructive empiricist and the scientific\nrealist as a debate about the aims of science. In extending his\ncritique, we might also be persuaded that constructive empiricism is\nmistaken in thinking that any philosophy of science ought centrally to\nbe about aims at all. In characterizing what science is, we should\ninstead focus on the many disparate activities and products of science\nitself, independent of any general aim or “point” to the activity. As\nRowbottom says, \nOne can learn how to perform various scientific tasks, and\nperform them well, without any explicit or implicit reference to an\nultimate or central ‘point’ of the exercise—the\noverarching process—of which they are a part. One may focus\ninstead on the immediate products of these tasks… ‘What\nis science?’ can be answered by pointing to those processes, how\nthey interact, and so forth. And what science can achieve may be\n(largely or wholly) independent of what its practitioners think it can\nachieve, or any rather mystical ‘point’ of the exercise\n(454–455). \nA defender of constructive empiricism might suggest that unless we\nthink of the activity of science in relation to some aim or other, we\ncannot properly understand that activity; and unless we understand as\nunited under some general aim all the disparate many ways that science\nis undertaken, we cannot understand those many practices as parts\nof science (as opposed to, say, parts of religion or politics\nor …). The activity is rendered intelligible only in light of\nthe point and purpose of undertaking it, and it is rendered\nintelligible as science only in light of a point or purpose\nshared with other activities regarded as scientific. \nAs van Fraassen (1994) puts it,  \n[S]cientists with their very different motives and convictions\nparticipate in a common enterprise, defined by its own internal\ncriteria of success, and this success is their common aim\n‘inside’ this cluster of diverging personal aim [sic]. How\nelse could they be said to be collaborating in a common enterprise?\nThe question is only what that defining criterion of success is\n(182). \nStill, even if we can offer an interpretation of science and its\nactivity as animated by a particular aim, which aim that is may be\nless important in characterizing science than the activity itself.\nRowbottom presses this point with the following thought\nexperiment: \nImagine members of an alien species, for whom acceptance—or if\nyou prefer to reserve ‘acceptance’ for humans, call it\n‘a-acceptance’—involves belief neither in\n(approximate) truth nor empirical adequacy. (This might be due to\npsychological constraints. A-acceptance could instead involve belief\nin significant truth content, high problem-solving power,\napproximate empirical adequacy, and so on.) Would we want to say that\nthey were incapable of doing science? Or failing that, would we want\nto insist that they couldn’t do anything with the\n‘character’ of science? That would be strange. For they\ncould have institutions similar to our universities, and have theories\nsimilar to our scientific theories, arrived at by the use of\nsimilar procedures. They could also use these theories for exactly the\nsame purposes for which we use our scientific theories: to\nexplain the origins of the universe, to build spacecraft, and so forth\n(456).  \nRowbottom here is, of course, describing theory acceptance. Insofar,\nthough, as a theory’s acceptability is determined by the degree of the\ntheory’s success at achieving a particular aim or aims, we can take\nthe point to be equally about aims. We can understand, that is, the\naliens as engaging in science even if they are not aiming for\nempirically adequate, or true, theories. In comparison to the activity\nitself, aims appear to be the less important thing to focus on in\ncharacterizing the activity as distinctively scientific. \nHow might a constructive empiricist reply? As noted in §1.4\nabove, constructive empiricism is to be regarded as the best\ninterpretative account of the activity of science that renders it\nconsistent with the empiricist’s own standards of rational\nactivity. It is, as van Fraassen (1994) says, what allow us to\n“make sense of those activities which we all agree are part\nof science” (190). As such, it is not beholden to scientists’ own\nprofessed aims in the activity the scientists undertake. Even if\nscientists—alien or human—regard themselves as being\nprincipally concerned with truth, or problem-solving, or predictive\nutility, none of those aims could be achieved without science being at\nleast minimally aimed at empirical adequacy for its theories. Positing\nempirical adequacy as the aim of science, then, allows the\nconstructive empiricist to best and most modestly make sense of the\nactivity of science. The variability of particular scientists’\nindividual or collective aims does not undercut the singular and\nimportant role empirical adequacy plays in how we might\nphilosophically best interpret science and its many disparate\nactivities.","contact.mail":"chmohler@truman.edu","contact.domain":"truman.edu"}]
