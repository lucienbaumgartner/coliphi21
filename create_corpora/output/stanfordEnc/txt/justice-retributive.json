Consider, for example, being the\nsentencing judge for a rapist who was just convicted in your court.\nSuppose that he has since suffered an illness that has left him\nphysically incapacitated so that he cannot rape again, and that he has\nenough money to support himself without resorting to criminal\nactivities. Suppose that this suffices to ensure that there is no need\nto deter or incapacitate him to prevent him from committing serious\ncrimes in the future. Suppose, in addition, that you could sentence\nhim to spend his days on a tropical island where he has always wanted\nto go, and where he will spend most of his days relaxing and pursuing\nhis interests. You can, however, impose one condition on his time\nthere: he must regularly report to a prison to be filmed in prison\ngarb, and these videos will be posted online, sending the message that\nhe is serving hard time for his crimes. As long as this ruse is secure\nfrom discovery, it could meaningfully contribute to general\ndeterrence. But even if the goods normally cited by consequentialists\nto justify punishment—incapacitation and deterrence—are\nachieved, is that the sentence he should receive? Many share the\nintuition that there is still some reason to want him to be punished\nmore harshly (see Moore 1997: 98–101). \nNot only is retributivism in that way intuitively appealing, the\nprimary alternative, consequentialist theories of punishment that\nfocus on deterrence and incapacitation, seem to confront a deep\nproblem. They have difficulty explaining a core and intuitively\ncompelling feature of retributivism, namely the widely shared sense\nthat it is always or nearly always impermissible both to inflict\npunishment on those who have done no wrong and to inflict\ndisproportionately large punishments on those who have done some\nwrong. (Some respond to this point by adopting a mixed theory,\naccording to which retributivism provides a necessary condition for\npunishment, but consequentialist considerations provide the reasons to\npunish. For more on such an approach see\n section 3.3.) \nBoth of these sources of retributivism’s appeal have clear\nlimits. The direct intuition can be challenged with the claim that it\nis merely the reflection of a morally dubious psychological propensity\nto feel an excess of what Nietzsche, in the Genealogy of\nMorals, called ressentiment, \na witches’ brew [of] resentment, fear, anger, cowardice,\nhostility, aggression, cruelty, sadism, envy, jealousy, guilt,\nself-loathing, hypocrisy and self-deception. (Moore 1997: 120) \nAnd the argument that retributivism justifies punishment better than\nconsequentialism presupposes that punishment is justifiable (for\ncriticism of this premise, see Golash 2005; Boonin 2008), and that\nthere are no alternatives that are better than both (for three\nalternatives, see Quinn 1985; Tadros 2011; Lacey & Pickard\n2015a). \nTo respond to these challenges, retributive justice must ultimately be\njustified in a larger moral context that shows that it is plausibly\ngrounded in, or at least connected to, other, deeply held moral\nprinciples. Only in this way should its intuitive appeal be regarded,\nin reflective equilibrium, as morally sound. For a discussion of the\nprospects for deeper justification, see\n section 5. \nTwo background concepts should be addressed before saying more about\nretributive justice: (1) punishment, and (2) the sorts of wrongs for\nwhich punishment might be thought deserved. \nThe entry  on legal punishment \ndiscusses this concept in depth. The following discussion surveys five\nelements of punishment that are central for the purpose of\nunderstanding retributivism. \nFirst, punishment must impose some sort of cost or hardship on, or at\nthe very least withdraw a benefit that would otherwise be enjoyed by,\nthe person being punished. This is often denoted “hard\ntreatment”. \nSecond, the punisher must inflict hard treatment intentionally, not as\nan accident, and not as a side-effect of pursuing some other end. For\nexample, while sending a criminal to prison often has foreseeable\nharmful effects on the criminal's family, retributivists would say\nthat those harms do not constitute punishment, not unless they are\npurposely inflicted as part of the punishment for the crime. \nSome critics of retributivism reject this limitation as an appeal to a\n“definitional stop”, which they say is illicitly used to\navoid having to justify the costs of the practice (Hart 1968:\n5–6; Christopher 2002: 879–880). The worry is that\nretributivists will seek to justify only the purposeful infliction of\nhardship on wrongdoers, and will ignore the overall costs of the\npractice. But there is no reason to think that retributivists\ngenerally ignore the need to justify the negative effects of\npunishment on the innocent (see\n section 4.5).\n The retributivist's point is only that the intentional infliction of\nhard treatment has to be justified in a different way than the\ncollateral damage that may befall either the criminal or the innocent\nas a result of punishing the former. \nThird, the hardship or loss must be imposed in response to an act or\nomission. It is a confusion to take oneself to be\n“punishing” others for some facts over which they had no\ncontrol (Mabbott 1939). One need not be conceptually confused to take\noneself to have reason to intentionally inflict hard treatment on\nothers because of some trait that they cannot help having. One might\nwant to oppress others on the basis of some trait they cannot help\nhaving, such as their ethnicity or physical appearance. Doing so would\npresumably be immoral, but it need not be conceptually confused. What\nwould be confused is thinking that one is inflicting\n“punishment”. (It is, however, not a confusion to punish\none person more harshly than another on the basis of traits over which\nthey have no control.) \nFourth, the act or omission ought to be wrongful. One can make sense\nof punishing another for an act that is not wrong (see Tadros 2016:\nch. 17; Cornford 2017). But as a normative matter, if not a conceptual\nmatter, such punishment is to be avoided if possible. (For arguments\nthat it is possible for a well-developed legal system to generally or\nalways avoid knowingly punishing acts that are not wrongful, see Duff\n2018: chs. 2 and 7; Walen forthcoming). \nFifth, it is best to think of the hard treatment as imposed, at least\nin part, as a way of sending a message of condemnation or censure for\nwhat is believed to be a wrongful act or omission (Feinberg 1970; for\na retributive theorist who rejects this element, see Berman 2012:\n143). This element too is a normative matter, not a conceptual one.\nOne can certainly make sense of punishment that is simply a response\nto wrongful or unwanted behavior—a response aimed at deterring\nsuch behavior or simply imposing suffering for a wrong done. But\ninsofar as one thinks of punishment as aimed at moral agents, there is\nreason to use it to communicate to wrongdoers (and to victims of their\nwrongdoing as well as potential future wrongdoers) that their wrongful\nacts or omissions are indeed wrongful and that the hard treatment that\nthey receive is a morally justified response to their wrongdoing (Duff\n2018: 295). \nNot all wrongdoing justifies a punitive response. Which kinds of\nwrongs can be morally fitting bases for punishment is a much-debated\ntopic (Shafer-Landau 1996: 289–292; Husak 2008; Asp 2013),\nbeyond the scope of the present entry. Nonetheless, a few comments may\nbe helpful. \nThe paradigmatic wrong for which punishment seems appropriate is an\nintentional or knowing violation of the important rights of another,\nsuch as murder or rape. It is almost as clear that an attempt to do\nthe same is a proper basis for punishment, though how to define the\nconcept of an attempt is highly contested (Duff 1996; Alexander,\nFerzan, & Morse 2009: ch. 6; Yaffe 2010). The more tenuous the\nconnection to a rights violation, and the less culpable the mental\nstate, the more controversial punishment for an act or omission\nbecomes. This raises special problems for purely regulatory (mala\nprohibita) offenses (for a critical discussion of mala\nprohibita offenses, see Husak 2008: 103–119; Duff 2018:\n313–322) and for the punishment of negligent acts (for criticism\nof punishing negligent acts, see Alexander, Ferzan, & Morse 2009:\nch. 3; for a defense of punishing negligent acts, see Stark 2016: chs.\n7 & 8). \nAn important dimension of debate is whether all moral wrongs are at least\npresumptively a proper basis for punishment (Moore 1997: 35–37),\nor whether only a subset of moral wrongs are a proper basis\npunishment. One prominent way to delimit the relevant wrongs, at least\nfor state punishment, is to say that only public wrongs may\nbe the basis for punishment. (Duff 2018: 75–87; Duff &\nHoskins 2017 [2019]: §2; for a criticism of Duff’s view of\npublic wrongs, see Tadros 2016: 120–130). \nAnother important debate concerns the “harm principle”\n(see Mill 1859: ch. 1). It is often said that only those moral wrongs\nthat cause harm can properly serve as the basis for punishment. But\nthe harm principle, on any of a number of interpretations, is too\nrestrictive to be consistent with retributive justice, which, unlike\nthe harm principle, calls for giving the wrongdoer his just deserts\neven if no other good (such as the prevention of harm) should follow\n(Tomlin 2014a). (For a short survey of variations on the harm\nprinciple and their problems, see Tadros 2016: 102–107.) \nIt is important to keep in mind that retributive justice is\nnot limited to liberal moral and political philosophy. Retributive\njustice may also be deemed appropriate by illiberal persons and inside\ndistinctly illiberal organizations (Zaibert 2006: 16–24).\nIlliberal persons and groups may also make a distinction between\nwrongs that call for punishment and those that do not, but they will\nnot draw the distinction in the same way that liberals would. \nThis section starts with a brief note on the etymological origins of\n“retributivism”. Most prominent retributive theorists have\nconverged, however, on the second of the meanings given below:\n“positive retributivism”. Some argue, on substantive\ngrounds, for a limited variation on retributivism: “negative\nretributivism”. Other limited applications of the idea are\npicked up by “limiting retributivism” and\n“communicative retributivism”. After surveying these\nlimited versions of retributivism, I turn to three ideas that are\nsometimes confused with retributivism: lex talionis,\nretrospective criminal justice, and sublimated vengeance. \nAs Didier Fassin (2018: 47) explains:  \nretribution … comes from Latin …\nretribuere [which] is composed of the prefix re-,\n“in return”, and tribuere, literally “to\ndivide among tribes”.  \nFassin’s point is that the root meaning traces to a tort-like\nidea, that when members of one tribe harm members of another, they\nhave to pay compensation to keep the peace. \nSeeing the root idea in this way helps to highlight a peculiar feature\nof the modern idea. There is something morally straightforward in the\nolder idea that if members of one group harm members of another, then\nthe harmed group could demand compensation. There is something at\nleast mysterious, however, in the modern thought that an individual\ncould owe suffering punishment to his fellow citizens for\nhaving committed a wrong. How does his suffering punishment “pay\nhis debt to society”? \nImportant as it is to recognize this question, it is also important to\nrecognize that the concept of retributive justice has evolved, and any\nquest for its justification must start with the thought that the core\nof the concept is no longer debt repayment but deserved\npunishment. \nPositive retributivism, or simply “retributivism”,\ninvolves both positive and negative desert claims. The positive desert\nclaim holds that wrongdoers morally deserve punishment for their\nwrongful acts (see\n section 4.6\n for a discussion of the deontic and consequentialist dimensions of\nthis). This claim comes in stronger and weaker versions. For example,\nMichael Moore (1997: 87) writes: “Retributivism … is the\nview that punishment is justified by the desert of the\noffender”. Jeffrie Murphy (2007: 11) is more pluralistic,\nwriting: “[A] retributivist is a person who believes that the\nprimary justification for punishing a criminal is that the criminal\ndeserves it”. A retributivist could take an even weaker view,\nthat there is some intrinsic positive value in punishing a\nwrongdoer for his wrongful acts, apart from any other consequences\nthat might arise from doing so. (For a discussion of three dimensions\nof strength or weakness for a retributive view, see Berman 2016). \nThis positive desert claim is complemented by a negative deontic\nclaim: Those who have done no wrong may not be punished. This\nprohibits both punishing those not guilty of wrongdoing (who deserve\nno punishment), and punishing the guilty more than they deserve (i.e.,\ninflicting disproportional punishment). \nOf course, the innocent will inevitably sometimes be punished; no\nhuman system can operate flawlessly. And retributivists should not\nduck what it means to commit such a mistake: it wrongs the innocent\nperson. But this is not a fatal problem for retributivists. It does\nnot imply that they risk acting impermissibly if they punish\npeople. Permissibility is best understood as an action-guiding notion,\nnot one tied directly to what is objectively justifiable (Scanlon\n2008: 47–52). As an action-guiding notion, it must make use of a\nrelevant standard of proof. If the right standard is met—the\n“beyond a reasonable doubt” standard has recently been\ncalled into question (Laudan 2011, but see Walen 2015)—then\npunishers act permissibly, even if they unwittingly punish the\ninnocent (see also Schedler 2011; Simons 2012: 67–69). \nMost contemporary retributivists accept both the positive and the\nnegative desert claims. Illustrating with the rapist case from\n section 1:\n he may not be punished more than he deserves for the rape he\ncommitted, but he deserves a reasonably harsh sentence for his rape\nand he ought to be given the sentence he deserves, even though he is\nalready incapacitated and he need not be punished in any serious way\nto contribute to general deterrence. \nWhat has been called “negative” (Mackie 1982),\n“minimalist” (Golding 1975), or “weak” (Hart\n1968: ch. 1) retributivism is the view that only something similar to\nthe negative component of retributivism is true. It is the view that\nwrongdoers forfeit their right not to suffer proportional punishment,\nbut that the positive reasons for punishment must appeal to some other\ngoods that punishment achieves, such as deterrence or incapacitation.\nWrongdoing, on this view, is merely a necessary condition for\npunishment. The desert of the wrongdoer provides neither a sufficient\ncondition for nor even a positive reason to punish (see also Mabbott\n1939; Quinton 1954). \nOf these three labels, negative retributivism seems the most apt, as\nit picks up the idea that wrongdoing negates the right the\nwrongdoer otherwise would have not to be punished. The alternative\nlabels also risk confusing negative retributivism with the thought\nthat the reasons to punish given by positive retributivism can be\nquite weak. Differences along that dimension should not be confused\nwith a position that denies that guilt, by itself, provides any reason\nto punish. \nNegative retributivism is often confusingly framed as the view that it\nis impermissible to punish a wrongdoer more than she deserves. (Hart\n1968: 236–237; Duff 2001: 12; Lippke 2015: 58.) If desert\nprovides a limit to punishment, then it must be deserved up to that\nlimit. But there is a reason to give people what they deserve. Yet\nnegative retributivism is offered as the view that desert provides no\nreason to punish. This contradiction can be avoided by reading the\nnegative limit in terms of proportional forfeiture without referring\nto desert. \nThe line between negative retributivism and retributivism that posits\na weak positive reason to punish may seem unimportant. A negative\nretributivist holds that the justification for punishment must come\ncompletely from its instrumental value. A positive retributivist who\nthinks that the reasons provided by desert are relatively weak may say\nthat most of what justifies punishment comes from the same\ninstrumental bases. For both, a full justification of punishment will\nbe “mixed”, appealing to both retributive and\nconsequentialist ideas (Garvey 2004: 449–451). \nNonetheless, there are three reasons it is important to distinguish\nthe two, and taken together they speak in favor of positive\nretributivism. First, negative retributivism seems to justify using\npeople merely as a means (within retributive limits) for promoting the\ngreater good (Duff 2001: 13). The thought that punishment treats\nwrongdoers as they deserve to be treated addresses this problem. \nSecond, a positive retributivist can distinguish different parts of\nthe all-things-considered justification for punishment. She can say,\nas Moore does (1997: 87), that the justification for\npunishing another, the thing that makes an act punitive rather than\nmerely an act of using or incapacitating another, is that the person\ndeserves to be punished for a wrong done. She can also take note of\nthe fact that punishment has its costs (see\n section 4.5),\n and she can cite the consequentialist benefits of punishment to\noutweigh those costs. Still, she can conceive of the significance of\nthese consequentialist benefits as merely offsetting the\nconsequentialist costs, not as providing a justification for the act\nqua punishment. This is not an option for negative retributivists. \nThird, it is not clear whether forfeiture theories that do not appeal\nto desert can make sense of the proportionality restrictions that are\ncentral to retributivism (Duff 2001: 14–16). Indeed, the\nproportionality limits of a pure forfeiture model, without desert, may\nbe quite different from the limits implicit in the notion of deserved\npunishment. A pure forfeiture model arguably would limit hard\ntreatment only to ensure that penalties strike a fair balance between\nthe claims of individuals not to have to bear them and the claims of\nthe state to take effective measures to promote important public ends.\nAll the concerns with the gravity of the wrong seem to go missing\n(Walen forthcoming). To cite the gravity of the wrong to set\nproportionality limits seems to presuppose some fundamental connection\nbetween the gravity of the wrong and proportional punishment (see\n section 4.4).\n That connection is naturally picked up with the notion of deserved\npunishment. If one eschews that notion, it is not clear how to make\nthe connection. \n“Limiting retributivism” is not so much a conception of\nretributivism as it is retributivism with the addition of skepticism\nabout our ability to make any but the most general statements about\nproportionality (see N. Morris 1982: 182–87, 196–200;\nFrase 2005: 77; Slobogin 2009: 671). It is, therefore, a view about\nhow much influence retributivism can have in the practice of\npunishment. Consequentialist considerations, it is proposed, should be\nconsulted to fill in the gap left by the supposed vagueness of\nproportionality. For example, while murder is surely a graver crime\nthan robbery, the range of acceptable punishment for murder may\noverlap with that for robbery. If so, a judge may cite the\nimportance of incapacitation to sentence a robber who seems likely to\nbe a recidivist to a longer sentence than a murderer who, for whatever reason, seems to pose little danger to others in the future. \nThis view may move too quickly to invoke consequentialist\nconsiderations. Even if our ability to discern proportionality\nconstraints is crude in absolute terms, comparative proportionality\nmay leave relatively little leeway with regard to what punishments are\nmorally defensible in a given jurisdiction (Robinson 2003; von Hirsch\n& Ashworth 2005: 180–185; von Hirsch 2011: 212; and section\n2 of the supplementary document\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality).\n Nonetheless, insofar as the constraints of proportionality seem\ninherently vague, retributivists may have to make some sort of peace\nwith the thesis of limiting retributivism. \nCommunicative retributivism is another variation on retributivism,\nthis time embracing skepticism that the hard treatment element of\npunishment is itself deserved. What is left then is the thought that\ncensure is deserved for wrongdoing, but that hard treatment is at best\njustified either instrumentally, for deterrence or incapacitation, or\nto give meaning to the censure (see Duff 2001: 29–30, 97; Tadros\n2011: ch. 5). Insofar as retributive justifications for the hard\ntreatment element of punishment seem inadequate—see\n section 5—this\n may be the best default position for retributivists. \nLex talionis is Latin for the law of retaliation. It connects\nto the original retributive notion of paying back a debt, and it\nspecifies that the debt is to be paid back in kind. It is reflected in\nthe Biblical injunction (which some Biblical scholars warn should be\ntaken symbolically, not literally) to take “an eye for an eye, a\ntooth for a tooth” (Exodus 21: 23–25;\nLeviticus 24:17–20). Kant also endorses, in a somewhat\ndifferent way, this notion of punishment. Invoking the principle of\nequality for punishment, Kant writes:  \nwhatever undeserved evil you inflict upon another within the people,\nthat you inflict upon yourself. (1797 [1991: 141])  \nThus, he who steals  \ndeprives himself (by the principle of retribution) of security in any\nproperty…. [and if] he has committed murder he must die. (1797\n[1991: 142]) \nLex talionis provides a controversial principle of\nproportionality (for more on lex talionis as a measure of\nproportional punishment, see section 2 of the supplementary document\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality).\n But while retributive justice includes a commitment to punishment\nthat is proportional to the crime, it cannot be reduced to a measure\nof proportionality (Moore 1997: 88; Husak 2019). \nIt is commonly said that the difference between consequentialist and\nretributive theories of punishment is that the former is prospective,\nlooking to the good that punishment may accomplish, while the latter\nis retrospective, seeking to do justice for what a wrongdoer has done.\nThat is a difference between the two, but retributivism\nshould not be reduced to the claim that it is punishment in response\nto a past crime. Other theories may refer to the fact that wrongdoers\nhave already done something in virtue of which it is proper to punish\nthem without thereby being retributivist. See, e.g., Quinn 1985 (it is\nrational to threaten people with punishment for crimes, and that\nrationality is transmitted to punishment if they commit crimes);\nTadros 2011 (criminals have a duty to endure punishment to make up for\nthe harm they have caused). \nRetributivism has also often been conflated with revenge or the desire\nfor vengeance. But the two concepts should not be confused. Robert\nNozick drew five distinctions between the two, including that revenge\nis personal but retribution is not, and that \n[r]evenge involves a particular emotional tone, pleasure in the\nsuffering of another, while retribution either need involve no\nemotional tone, or involves another one, namely, pleasure at justice\nbeing done. (1981: 367) \nThese imply that even if no one wanted to take revenge on a wrongdoer,\nthere could still be a retributive reason to punish her (Moore 1997:\n89; for a skeptical take on these distinctions, see Fassin 2018:\n36). \nThese distinctions do not imply that the desire for revenge plays no\nmotivational role leading people to value retributive justice. Perhaps\nretributive justice is the sublimated, generalized version of the\nthirst for revenge. The two are nonetheless different. As George\nFletcher wrote (2000: 417), retributivism “is not to be\nidentified with vengeance or revenge, any more than love is to be\nidentified with lust”. \nThis section will address six issues that arise for those trying to\nmake sense of retributive justice: (1) the nature of the desert claim\nand questions it raises; (2) the proper identity of the punisher; (3)\nthe normative status of suffering; (4) the meaning of proportionality;\n(5) the strength of retributive reasons; and (6) whether retributivism\nshould be thought of as a consequentialist or deontological\ntheory. \nDesert has been analyzed into a three-way relationship between the\nperson who deserves something, what she deserves, and that in virtue\nof which she deserves it. These can usefully be cast, respectively, as\nthe desert subject, the desert object, and the desert basis (Feinberg\n1970; Berman 2011: 437). A fourth dimension should also be noted: the\nperson or persons who can appropriately give, or have a duty to give,\nthe desert subject what she deserves. I call these persons desert\nagents. They raise a distinct set of issues, which are addressed in\n section 4.2. \nBefore discussing the three parts of desert, it is important to\naddress the idea that desert is fundamentally a pre-institutional\nnotion. As Joel Feinberg wrote:  \ndesert is a moral concept in the sense that it is logically prior to\nand independent of public institutions and their rules. (Feinberg\n1970: 87)  \nAccordingly, one challenge theorists of retributive justice often take\nthemselves to have is to show how the criminal justice system can be,\nat least in part, justified by claims that wrongdoers deserve\npunishment in a pre-institutional sense. For more on this, see\n section 4.5\n and\n section 6. \nRetributivism presents no special puzzles about who is the desert\nsubject: the wrongdoer. What may be particularly problematic for\nretributivism is the claim that certain kinds of persons (children or\nthe insane) or entities (states or corporations) can or cannot deserve\npunishment. The fundamental issues are twofold: First, can the subject\nbe responsible for wrongdoing? Second, does the subject have the\nmental (or information processing) ability to appreciate the\npunishment as conveying condemnation for a wrong done, rather than\nseeing it simply as hard treatment? Small children, animals, and the\ninsane may lack both abilities, but a person who is only temporarily\ninsane might lack one ability but not the other. (For contrasting\nviews about punishing artificial persons, such as states or\ncorporations, see French 1979; Narveson 2002.) \nThe desert object has already been discussed in\n section 2.1:\n punishment. There is, of course, much to be said about what\npunishments are deserved for what wrongs. I highlight here two issues\nthat are particularly salient for retributivists. First, is the\nquestion of whether the retributivist can justify inflicting hard\ntreatment in addition to censure—see\n section 3.5\n and\n section 5.\n This is tied to the normative status of suffering, which is discussed in\n section 4.3.\n Second, is the challenge of identifying proportional\npunishments—discussed in\n section 4.4. \nOne more matter should be mentioned under the heading of the desert\nobject: namely the idea put forward by some retributivists, that\nwrongdoers have a “right to be punished” such that not\npunishing them wrongs them (Hegel 1821; H. Morris 1968). It is\nimportant to be clear about what this right is. It would be ludicrous\nto hold that an executive wrongs a wrongdoer by showing her mercy and\npardoning her. What is meant is that wrongdoers have the right to be\ntreated as the kind of being who can be held responsible and punished,\nrather than as sick or dangerous beasts. \nThe desert basis has already been discussed in\n section 2.2:\n a certain kind of wrong. The focus of the discussion at this point is\non two puzzles about the existence of a desert basis. The first puzzle\nconcerns how humans, given the fact that our choices are grounded in\nour brain activity, and that our brains are parts of the physical\nworld, can have the sort of free will necessary to deserve\npunishment at all. The second puzzle concerns why, even if they\ndeserve punishment, that fact should make it permissible for anyone to\ntake on the role of giving them the punishment they deserve. \nThe laws of physics might be thought to imply that we are no more free\nand responsible for our “choices”, and therefore no more\ncapable of deserving punishment, than any other physical object, be it\na falling tree or a wild animal. One can resist this move by arguing\nthat while we are physical beings, most of us have the capacity to\nweigh reasons for and against particular options, and to\nchoose—these being the key abilities for being responsible\nagents who can deserve punishment if they choose to do wrong\n(Fischer and Ravizza 1998; Morse 2004; Nadelhoffer 2013). But this\ninvites the reply that even in normally functioning adults the\nattribution of responsibility for choices is an illusion (Smilansky\n2000). Upon closer inspection, the agent dissolves and all we are left\nwith is a brain responding to stimuli in a way fully consistent with\nthe underlying physical laws (Kelly 2009; Greene & Cohen 2011;\nVihvelin 2003 [2018]). See the entry on \n compatibilism for a survey \n of a range of possible responses to this argument. \nAssuming that wrongdoers can, at least sometimes, deserve punishment,\nthe next question is: why think others may punish them just because\nthey are deserving? David Dolinko (1991) points out that there is a\ndifference between someone morally deserving something and others\nhaving a right to give it to her. In one example, he imagines a father\nwho (perversely) gives his reprobate son almost everything in his\nwill, and leaves his loving and respectful son a pittance. We may\nbelieve that the loving son deserves to inherit at least half\nof his father's estate, but that would not entitle anyone to take\nproperty from the other son to give to him (1991: 544). Putting the\npoint more generally, desert by itself does not justify doing things\nthat otherwise would violate rights. Moreover, since people normally\nhave a right not to suffer punishment, desert alone should not justify\npunishing them. \nThe most promising way to respond to this criticism within a\nretributive framework is to distinguish two kinds of desert: desert\nthat corresponds to a view about what would be a good outcome, and\ndesert that concerns rights (Hill 1999: 425–426; Berman 2008:\n271–281). Dolinko's example concerns the first kind of desert.\nBut insofar as retributive desert presupposes forfeiture of the right\nnot to be punished, it is unsurprising that there should be some\nagents who have the right to mete it out. Who they are is the subject\nof the next section. \nAssuming that wrongdoers deserve to be punished, who has a right to\ninflict the punishment? Who, in other words, are the appropriate\ndesert agents? One might start, as Hobbes and Locke did, with the view\nthat in the state of nature, the victim has the right to punish, and\nthat the reasons for creating a state include reasons for potential\nvictims to transfer that right to the state (Hobbes 1651: chs. 14\n& 18; Locke 1690: ch. 9). \nOne worry about this sort of view is that it could license vigilante\npunishment. Social contract theorists can handle that by emphasizing\nthat people not only delegate but transfer their right to\npunish, retaining only a vestigial right to punish in the case of\nminor punishments, such as would be doled out outside the criminal\njustice system, or if the state fails or is unable to act.\nCommunitarians like Antony Duff (2011: 6), however, object to even a\nvestigial right to vigilante punishment. Duff sees the state, which\nspeaks on behalf of the whole community, as the only proper punisher,\nat least in the context of crimes (For an even stronger position along\nthese lines, see Hegel 1821: §102). \nOthers take a different view about vigilantes, namely that\nanyone is pro tanto entitled to punish a wrongdoer.\nSome forfeiture theorists hold that restrictions on the right to\npunish someone who has forfeited her right not to be punished arise\nonly as a matter of political morality (Wellman 2017: 30–31). It\nis hard to see why a desert theorist could not take the same position.\nIndeed, some retributivists think that what vigilantes do should at\nleast count against the total punishment someone is due (Husak 1990:\n441–442; but see Kolber 2013 (discussed in section 3 of the supplementary document Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality)\n for a challenge to the logical implication that vigilantes\n“punish”). \nEven if the state normally has an exclusive right to punish criminal\nwrongdoing, questions arise whether it is permitted to punish if it\nsustains or fails to address important social injustices (from\ndistributive injustice to the denial of civil and political rights to\nsocially disempowered groups). (For an overview of the literature on\nthis, see Ewing 2018). \nFinally, can the wrongdoer herself be her own punitive desert agent?\nCan she repent and voluntarily take on hardships, and thereby preempt\nothers' right to punish her? Duff has argued that she cannot unless\nshe has also suffered public criticism and social ostracism—and\neven then, such informal punishment should be discouraged as a\nsubstitute for formal punishment (Duff 2001: 118–120). \nRetributive justice normally is taken to hold that it is intrinsically\n(or non-instrumentally) good that wrongdoers suffer hard treatment at\nthe hands of punishers. But as Hart put it, retributive justice \nappears to be a mysterious piece of moral alchemy in which the\ncombination of the two evils of moral wickedness and suffering are\ntransmuted into good. (Hart 1968: 234–235) \nMoreover, some critics think the view that it is intrinsically good to\ninflict suffering is “barbaric” (Tadros 2011: 63) or\n“morally repugnant” (Scanlon 2013: 102). \nThe core retributivist response to these criticisms has to be that it\nis neither absurd nor barbaric to think that the normative valence of\nsuffering might sometimes be positive. But even if that is correct,\none must also ask whether suffering itself is valuable or if it is\nonly the suffering of punishment that matters, and whether the\nsuffering should be understood in terms of objective deprivations or\nsubjective suffering. \nRetributivists think that deserved suffering should be distinguished\nfrom non-deserved suffering. While the latter is inherently bad, the\nformer, at least if inflicted by a proper punitive desert agent, is\ninherently good (Hegel 1821: §99; Zaibert 2018: chs. 2 & 3;\nAlexander & Ferzan 2018: 184–185). Just as grief is good and\nmorally valuable when a loved one has died, so suffering might be good\nand morally valuable when experienced by a wrongdoer, especially if\nexperienced in a way that is appropriately connected to having\ncommitted a particular wrong. Of course, it would be better if there\nwere no occasion to inflict suffering, but given that a wrong has been\ncommitted, inflicting deserved suffering in response is better than\nnot doing so. (For another example of something with a variable\nnormative valence, see Kant's doctrine of the highest good: happiness\nin proportion to virtue. Kant 1788 [1956: 115].) \nVictor Tadros (2013: 261) raises an important concern about this response to Hart's objection, namely that if a person were already suffering, then the situation might be made better if the person engaged in wrongdoing, thereby making the suffering valuable. One way to avoid this unwanted implication is to say that the negative value of the wrong would outweigh any increased value in the suffering, and that the wronging is still deontologically prohibited, even if it would somehow improve the value picture (see Alexander & Ferzan 2018: 187–188). But this reply leaves intact the thought that something valuable nonetheless occurs if a suffering person commits a crime: her suffering at least now fits (see Tadros 2015: 401-403). Insofar as retributivists should find this an unwanted implication, they have reason to say that suffering is valuable only if it is meted out for a wrong done. This connection is the concern of the next section. \nSome retributivists take the view that what wrongdoing calls for is\nthe wrongdoer's suffering, whatever causes it. As Mitchell Berman\nwrites (2013: 87), “the dominant retributivist view” is\n“that what wrongdoers deserve is ‘to suffer’”\n(see also Zaibert 2013: 43 n.19; but see Kleinig 1973: 67, discussing\nthe value of imposing suffering). Even though Berman himself\ndoes not quite embrace that view, he embraces a close cousin, namely\nthat a wrongdoer deserves that her life “go less well [than it]\nwould have otherwise gone” (2013: 104). \nThere is something intuitively appealing, if one has retributive\nintuitions, about the thought that it is better if a\nwrongdoer—especially one who has committed serious\nwrongs—lives miserably than if she lives happily. There is\nsomething galling, if one feels the retributive impulse, in the\nthought that she might “get away with it”. Nonetheless, it\nis important to distinguish the thought that it is good to punish a\nwrongdoer so that she does not “get away with it”, from\nthe thought that it is better that she suffer than that she live\nhappily, even if the suffering is not inflicted by punishment. The\nlatter thought may draw on the same emotional wellspring as\nretributivism. But a retributivist—at least one who rejects the\nfantasy that God inflicts such suffering as a matter of cosmic\njustice—should not base her conception of retributivism on\nit. \nIf retributivism were based on the thought that wrongdoers' suffering\nis good in itself, then punishment is not necessary as a bridge\nconnecting the suffering and the individual bad acts. If the\nconnection between individual bad acts and suffering is lost, then\nretributivists are left with the need to keep a whole-life ledger of\ngood and bad acts, for which they want a person to have the\nappropriate amount of whole-life happiness or suffering (Ezorsky 1972:\nxxvi; Tadros 2011: 68). But the idea of tracking all of a person's\ngood and bad deeds, and all of her happiness or suffering, and aiming\nto align them is problematic. It suggests that one could bank good\ndeeds and “earn the ability to commit misdeeds with\nimpunity” (Alexander 2013: 318). Such banking should be\nrejected, even though it is plausible that performing heroic deeds\nafter having committed a wrong mitigates the punishment deserved. \nAdam Kolber, no retributivist, argues that retributivists cannot\nignore the subjective experience of punishment. \nTo be retributively punished, the person punished must find the\npunishment aversive and the severity of the punishment is at least\npartly a function of how aversive he finds it. (2009: 215) \nKolber continues: \nRetributivists who fail to consider variation in offenders' actual or\nanticipated experiences of punishment are not measuring punishment\nseverity properly and are therefore punishing disproportionally.\n(2009: 215; see also Bronsteen et al. 2009: 1068–1072) \nYet, as Kolber points out, accommodating such variation would be\nintuitively problematic for retributivists. It would call, for\nexample, for short sentences for those who would suffer a lot in\nprison and for extra harsh treatment for those who find prison easy to\nhandle. This is a far cry from current practice. (For retributivists\nwho agree and think the practice should be reformed, see Alexander\n& Ferzan 2018: 199.) \nMany retributivists disagree with Kolber's claim that the subjective\nexperience of suffering of particular individuals should be a\nsignificant concern for them. As Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth\nput it: \nWhat makes punishments more or less onerous is not any identifiable\nsensation; rather, it is the degree to which those sensations\ninterfere with people's legitimate interests \n—interests people generally share, such as in \nfreedom of movement, choice regarding … activities, choice of\nassociates, privacy, and so on. (von Hirsch & Ashworth 2005: 147;\nsee also Gray 2010; Markel & Flanders 2010) \nBut this response, by itself, seems inadequate. Surely Kolber is right\nthat the subjective experience of punishment as hard\ntreatment is part of its point, and that variation in that experience\nis something that needs to be justified. \nA second way to respond to Kolber's argument is to reject the premise\nthat retributivists must justify imposing greater subjective suffering\non some rather than others as a matter of retributive\njustice. As was pointed out in\n section 2.1,\n punishment must be intentional; what results as a mere side-effect of\npunishment is not itself part of the punishment. Retributivists can\nintend to impose punishments that will generally be experienced as\nmore severe—for example, longer prison terms or more austere\nprisons—the more serious the wrong for which they are imposed,\nknowing but not intending that different people will experience the\nsame term in the same prison differently. \nThe retributivist can then justify causing excessive suffering in some\npeople—too little suffering is less objectionable—if three\nconditions obtain: \nThese conditions call for a few comments. First, the excessive\nsuffering in condition (b) should be incidental excessive suffering.\nIf it is suffering that is intentionally inflicted to achieve some\nother end, then it will be as hard to justify as punishing the\ninnocent. Second, there is reason to think these conditions often\nobtain. Focusing only on the last condition, there are at least four\nreasons to think it obtains: individual tailoring of punishment  \n(For responses to an earlier version of this argument, see Kolber\n2019: 584–586.) \nIt might also often be less problematic to cause excessive suffering\nthan it may at first seem if people are to some degree responsible for\ntheir own hypersensitivity—compare Rawls's thought that people\nare responsible for their own preferences (Rawls 1975 [1999:\n261]). \nThat said, the state should accommodate people who would\nsuffer extreme trauma from normal punishments. For example, someone\nwho is extremely sensitive to the cold should be given extra clothing\nand blankets or a space heater. But that does not imply that the\npunishers should try, in general, to tailor the subjective experience\nof suffering to be proportional to the crime. \nRetributive justice holds that it would be unjust to punish a\nwrongdoer more than she deserves, where what she deserves\nmust be in some way proportional to the gravity of her crime.\nInflicting disproportionate punishment wrongs a criminal in much the\nsame way as, even if not quite as much as, punishing an innocent\nperson wrongs her (Gross 1979: 436). \nOne might wonder how a retributivist can be so concerned with\ndisproportionately punishing while also tolerating the known\ninfliction of excessive suffering (see\n section 4.3.3).\n But there is an important difference between the two: an agent\ninflicting punishment may come to know that a particular individual is\nsuffering more than most would from a particular punishment, but she\nshould see that as just an unfortunate side effect of inflicting a\nproportional punishment; she must aim, however, at inflicting only a\nproportional punishment. \nThe possibility of punishing less than deserved is also\nnormatively significant, but it provides a much weaker constraint.\nFirst, it does not seem to wrong anyone in particular (see\nDuus-Otterström 2013: 472–475). One might think that the\nvictims of crime are wronged if wrongdoers are not punished. But the\nview that it wrongs victims not to punish wrongdoers confuses\nvengeance, which is victim-centered, with retributivism, which is\nagent-centered: concerned with giving the wrongdoer the punishment\nshe deserves (see Paul Robinson's 2008 contrast between\nvengeful and deontological conceptions of deserved punishment).\nSecond, it is clear that in any criminal justice system that allows\nplea-bargaining, intentional deviations below desert will have to be\ntolerated. Russell Christopher (2003) has argued that retributivists\ncannot accept plea-bargaining. But he bases his argument on a number\nof unsound assumptions, including that “[r]etributivism imposes\nan absolute duty to punish culpable wrongdoers whenever the\nopportunity arises” (2003: 101), and that punishing a wrongdoer\nless than she deserves violates her “right to punishment”\n(2003.: 128–129). Both of these have been rejected above.\nChristopher correctly notes that retributivists desire to treat\nequally culpable people alike (2003: 131). But this could be simply\nbecause they desire to give people the treatment they deserve in some\nnon-comparative sense (Alexander and Ferzan 2018: 181), not because\nthey care about equality per se. \nThis leaves two fundamental questions that an account of\nproportionality must address: how should we measure the gravity of a\nwrong, and how can a punishment be “proportional” to it?\nThese are addressed in the supplementary document:\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality. \nHow strong are retributive reasons? As was argued in\n section 3.3,\n even if they are weak, the presence of positive desert makes a\ndifference to the justification of punishment. It might affect, for\nexample, how one understands the forfeiture of the right not\nto be punished. It is a separate question, however, whether positive\ndesert carries much weight in establishing an all-things-considered\nreason to punish. \nTo be more precise, there are actually two ways the strength or\nweakness of retributive reasons can be significant. It may affect\nwhether an individual wrongdoer should be punished, even if no\ninstrumental good (primarily deterrence and incapacitation) would\nthereby be achieved, assuming that the institutions for punishment are\nin place. But it may also affect whether institutions of punishment\nshould be established, even if no instrumental goods would thereby be\nachieved. It may be relatively easy to justify punishing a wrongdoer\nby appeal to positive desert, even if her punishment yields no\ninstrumental benefits, if the institutions of punishment are already\nup, running, and paid for (Moore 1997: 100–101; Husak 2000:\n995). It is another matter to claim that the institutions of\npunishment, given all their costs, can be justified by positive desert\nalone. The point of saying this is not to suggest, in the spirit of\nHart (1968: 9) that the justification of institutions of criminal\njustice should be purely consequentialist. The retributivist sees\ndesert as a reason for setting up the institutions as well as for\npunishing the individual wrongdoer (Moore 1997: 154). The point is\nmerely that one should be clear about just what one is assessing when\nweighing costs and benefits. \nThe primary costs of establishing the institutions of criminal\npunishment are: \nIt is implausible that these costs can be justified simply by the\nimportance of punishing wrongdoers as they deserve to be punished. The\nonly plausible way to justify these costs is if criminal punishment\nhas large instrumental benefits in terms of crime prevention (Husak\n2000; Cahill 2011; Lippke 2019). \nRetributivism seems to contain both a deontological and a\nconsequentialist element. Its negative desert element is\ndeontological. It is a conceptual, not a deontological, point that one\ncannot punish another whom one believes to be innocent\n (section 2.1).\n But it is a deontological point that an avenue of justification for\nhard treatment is opened up, making permissible what might otherwise\nhave been impermissible, if that person is guilty and therefore\nforfeits her right not to be so treated. \nInsofar as retributivism holds that it is intrinsically good if a\nlegitimate punisher punishes the guilty, it seems to have a\nconsequentialist element as well. This good has to be weighed against\nother possible goods to decide what it would be best to do (Cahill\n2011). Thus, most retributivists would accept that it is justifiable\nto forego punishing one deserving person if doing so would make it\npossible to punish two equally deserving people, or one more deserving\nperson—as happens on a regular basis in plea-bargaining (Moore\n1997: 157–158; Berman 2011: 451–452; see also\n section 4.4). \nBerman (2011) has argued that retributivism can appropriately be\nunderstood not just as having a consequentialist element, but as\nhaving an instrumentalist element, namely that punishment is a\nvaluable tool in achieving the suffering that a wrongdoer deserves.\nBut he argues that retributivism can also be understood as\nnon-instrumentalist if the desert object is punishment, not suffering.\nIt would be non-instrumentalist because punishment would not be a\nmeans to achieving the good of suffering; it would be good in itself.\nAs argued in\n section 4.3,\n punishment, not suffering, should be thought of as the proper\nretributive desert object, and thus the instrumentalist conception\nshould be rejected. \nThe principal focus of concern when it comes to justifying\nretributivism is justifying its desert object. The question is: if we\ncan assume that the institutions of punishment can be justified all\nthings considered, can we justify the claim that wrongdoers deserve\ncensure and hard treatment? \nCensure is surely the easier of the two. It respects the wrongdoer as\na responsible agent to censure her, and it respects the victim (if\nthere is one) to stand up for her as someone whose rights should have\nbeen respected. The core challenge for justifying retributivism, then,\nis justifying the claim that hard treatment is equally deserved. \nAs Michael Moore (1997: 106) points out, there are two general\nstrategies for justifying retributive hard treatment: (1) showing how\nsuch treatment “follows from some yet more general principle of\njustice that we think to be true”, and (2) showing that it fits\nwith a theory of punishment that “best accounts for those of our\nmore particular judgments that we also believe to be true”.\nThese will be handled in reverse order. \nThe argument here has two prongs. First, most people intuitively think\nthat it is important to punish wrongdoers with proportional hard\ntreatment, even if no other good would thereby be brought about.\nSecond, there is no reason to doubt that these intuitions are\nreliable. \nIt seems clear that the vast majority of people share the retributive\nintuition that makes up the first prong (Moore 1997: 101). Consider\nagain the example of the incapacitated rapist mentioned in\n section 1.\n The intuition is widely shared that he should be punished even if\ndoing so is expected to produce no consequentialist good distinct from\nhim getting the punishment he deserves. \nThe weakness of this strategy is in prong two. One might suspect that\nretributive intuitions are merely the reflection of emotions, such as\na thirst for vengeance, that are morally dubious. They may be deeply\ngrounded in our species as part of our evolutionary history, but that\nfact by itself is insufficient to consider them morally\nreliable—compare other deeply engrained emotional impulses, such\nas tribalism, that are clearly morally problematic (Bloom 2013).\nMoreover, the label “vengeance” is not merely used as a\npejorative; a retributive or vengeful response to wrongdoing has to\nconfront moral arguments that it is a misplaced reaction. Foremost\namong these is the argument that we do not really have free\nwill—see\n section 4.1.3.\n Respect for the dignity of wrongdoers as agents may call for\ncensuring them when they do wrong, and with requiring them to make\nreparations when those can be made. It is unclear, however, why it\ncalls, in addition, for hard treatment. Rather, sympathy for\nwrongdoers as products of their biology and environment seems to call\nfor mercy and forgiveness (for a contrary view, see Levy 2014). \nMoore (1997: 145) has an interesting response to this sort of\ncriticism. He turns to the first-person point of view. He imagines\nthat he has committed some horrible violent crime, and then says that\nhe hopes his response “would be that I would feel guilty unto\ndeath”. As a result, he hopes that he would welcome\npunishment for having committed such a crime. Moore then turns the\ntable and says that one should resist the “elitist and\ncondescending” temptation to withhold that judgment from others\n(1997: 148). \nThis is a rhetorically powerful move, but it is nonetheless open to\nfour objections. First, it presupposes that one can infer the\npropriety of the third-person reaction of blame and punishment from\nthe first-person reaction of guilt and self-punishment. But\nthere are things a person should do to herself that others should not\nfeel equally free to do to her (Duff 2007: 383; Zaibert 2018:\n94–95). Second, it may reflect only the imagination of a person\nwho has committed no such serious crimes, rather than the insight of a\nperson who knows what it is like to have committed a serious crime and then\ntried to come to terms with himself. Third, it equates the propriety\nof feeling or inflicting guilt with the propriety of adding punishment\nto guilt. But why is guilt itself not enough (see Husak 2016:\n59–60)? Fourth, one can question whether even the reaction of\nguilt is a morally sound one. Might it not be a sort of sickness, as\nNietzsche (1887 [2006: 60]) put it, “bad conscience, …\nthe will to self-violation”. \nConsider what Jeffrie Murphy (2007: 18) said, as a mature philosopher,\nlooking back on his own efforts to justify retributivism: \n[M]y enthusiasm for settling scores and restoring balance through\nretributive justice may in part have been extensions of what Nietzsche\ncalled “a soul that squints”—the soul of a\nshopkeeper or an accountant. If I had been a kinder person, a less\nangry person, a person of more generous spirit and greatness of soul,\nwould robust retributivism have charmed me to the degree that it at\none time did? I suspect not. \nThe point is not to say that this first justificatory strategy fails.\nIt is to say that it does not obviously succeed. The notion of\nretributive justice would be on sounder footing if this justification\nwere supplemented by a theoretical justification for punitive hard\ntreatment that ties it to a more general set of principles of justice.\nDoing so would help dispel doubts that retributive intuitions are the\ncrabbed judgments of a squinty, vengeful, or cruel soul. \nArguably the most popular theoretical framework for justifying\nretributivism in the past fifty years or so has been Herbert Morris's\n(1968) appeal to fairness. The argument starts with the thought that it is to our mutual\nbenefit to live in society, and that to be in society, we have to\naccept certain limits on our behavior. It then continues with this claim: \nIf a person fails to exercise self-restraint even though he might\nhave… he renounces a burden which others have voluntarily\nassumed and thus gains an advantage which others, who have restrained\nthemselves, do not possess. (1968: 33) \nIt concludes with the thought that his unfair advantage should be erased by “exacting the\ndebt” (1968: 34). This is done with hard treatment. \nThough influential, the problems with this argument are serious. First,\nit is unclear that criminals have advantages that others have\nforsaken. Suppose someone murders another in a moment of anger,\ntriggered by a minor offense. Does he get the “advantage”\nof getting to express his anger? What if most people feel they can\nexpress their anger sufficiently in such situations by expressing it\nin words? Then it seems that the only advantage he has is being able\nto express his anger violently. But if most people do not, at least\nnot upon reflection, wish to do that sort of thing, then he is not\nrenouncing a burden that others too wish to renounce. \nEven if there is some sense in which he gains an advantage over\nothers, such as the advantage of being free to use violence, what\nwould then be the proper measure of bringing him back in line? To see\nthe problem, compare how “far ahead” such a murderer is\nlikely to get to how “far ahead” someone might get by\neconomic fraud. Fraud may produce a much greater advantage, but we\nnormally think that violence is the greater crime. (Davis 1993\nchallenges this framing of the advantage gained, suggesting the right\ntest is the value a crime would find at an auction of licenses to\ncommit crimes; Shafer-Landau 1996: 303 rejects this solution as\nequally implausible.) \nMore problematically yet, it seems to be fundamentally missing the\npoint to say that the crime of, for example, murder is, at bottom,\nfree riding rather than unjustly killing another. (For these and\nrelated criticisms, see Braithwaite & Pettit 1990: 158–159;\nDolinko 1991: 545–549; Murphy 2007: 13–14.) \nAn alternative interpretation of Morris's idea is that the relevant\nbenefit is the opportunity to live in a relatively secure state, and\nthe wrong is not the gaining of an extra benefit but the failure to\naccept the burdens that, collectively, make that benefit possible.\nPunishment then removes the benefit that the wrongdoer cannot fairly\nlay claim to, having shirked the burden that it was her due to carry\n(see Westen 2016). This interpretation avoids the first of the\nproblems outlined above. But it still has difficulty accounting for\nthe thought that a crime such as murder is not fundamentally about\nfree riding. Moreover, it has difficulty accounting for proportional\npunishment in a plausible way. Presumably, the measure of a\nproportional punishment would be something like this: the greater the\nshirking of one's duty to accept the burdens of self-restraint, the\nlarger should be one's punishment. But how do we measure the degree of\nshirking? By the harm one causes or risks causing, by the benefit one\nreceives, or by the degree to which respecting the burden shirked\nwould have been burdensome? Only the first corresponds with a normal\nretributive notion of punishment, but this alternative reading seems\nto point to one of the latter two meanings as the measure of unjust\ngain. In addition, this view seems to imply that one who entered a\nsecure society from some sort of failed state, and who has not yet\nbenefited from the secure state, cannot be punished if she commits\nviolent criminal acts in the secure state. This is quite an odd\nimplication, though one that a social contract theorist might be\nwilling to accept. \nFor another attempt to develop a better Morris-like view, making the\nwrong the undermining of the conditions of trust, see Dimock 1997: 41.\nFor a criticism, see Korman 2003. For an attempt to build on Morris's\nidea, translating the basic wrong into flouting legitimate, democratic\nlaw, see Markel 2011. \nJean Hampton tried to improve upon the unfair advantage theory by\nfocusing on the idea that what wrongdoers (at least those who have\nvictims) do is an affront to the victim, not just to the\nwhole community. Her view is that punishment must somehow annul this\naffront. As she puts it: \nIf I have value equal to that of my assailant, then that must be made\nmanifest after I have been victimized. By victimizing me, the\nwrongdoer has declared himself elevated with respect to me, acting as\na superior who is permitted to use me for his purposes. A false moral\nclaim has been made… The retributivist demands that the false\nclaim be corrected. The lord must be humbled to show that he isn't the\nlord of the victim. … [R]etributive punishment is the defeat of\nthe wrongdoer at the hands of the victim (either directly or\nindirectly through an agent of the victim's, e.g., the state) that\nsymbolizes the correct relative value of wrongdoer and victim. It is a\nsymbol that is conceptually required to reaffirm a victim's equal\nworth in the face of a challenge to it. (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n125–126) \nThis theory too suffers serious problems. First, why think that a\nwrongful act seriously challenges the equal moral standing of all? It\nmay imply that the wrongdoer thinks of himself as above either the law\nin general or his victim in particular. But he's simply mistaken.\nUnless there is a danger that people will believe he is right, it is\nnot clear why there is a pressing need to correct him. \nSecond, even if the message is offensive in a way that calls for\ncorrection, why isn't the solution simply to reaffirm the moral status\nof the victim, to censor the wrongdoer, and perhaps to require the\nwrongdoer to make compensation? The answer may be that “actions\nspeak louder than words”. Perhaps some punishment may then be\nnecessary to show that we really mean it when we say that he was\nmistaken. But why wouldn't it be sufficient to inflict “the\npunishment”—whatever that is—to reinforce the point?\nIt's unclear why the punishment should rise above some baseline-level,\nin proportion with the gravity of the wrong, to show that “we\nmean it”. \nThird, the message of equality through turning the tables seems\npeculiar. If the victim, with the help of others, gets to take her\nturn being lord, it is not clear how that sends the message of\nequality, rather than simply the message that this particular\nwrongdoer lost in the competition to be “lord”. \nFourth, Hampton seems to have fallen into a trap that also was a\nproblem for Morris, namely substituting one wrong for another. The\nwrong of being raped is not the message that the rapist\nsends; it is the rape. (For variations on these criticisms, see\nDolinko 1991: 551–554; for Hampton's replies to her critics, see\nHampton 1992.) \nAntony Duff (2001 and 2011) offers a communication theory according to\nwhich punishment is necessary to communicate censure for wrongdoing.\nIt might be objected that his theory is too narrow to provide a\njustificatory framework for retributivism generally, because it is\nframed as a theory for legal punishment, meted out by a state\nthat governs a community of equal citizens. (The same applies to the\nsimilar theory developed by Markel 2011.) But arguably it could be\nextended to any community. \nPutting the narrowness issue aside, two questions remain. The first is\nwhether it is constructive for the sort of community that Duff strives\nto preserve to condemn wrongdoers. As Lacey and Pickard (2015a) put\nit, stigmatizing offenders with condemnation alienates them from\nsociety (and they are likely alienated already) and undermines their\npotential to see themselves as eventually redeemed. To this worry,\nDuff may be able to respond that the form of condemnation he has in\nmind is nothing more than treating wrongdoers as responsible for their\ncriminal acts. \nBut this then leads to a second question, namely whether Duff’s\ntheory can account for hard treatment. As Duff raises the issue: \nCensure can … be communicated by “hard treatment”\npunishments …—by imprisonment, by compulsory community\nservice, by fines and the like, which are burdensome independently of\ntheir censorial meaning…: but why should we choose such methods\nof communication, rather than methods that do not involve hard\ntreatment? (Duff 2013) \nOne answer he gives is that: \n[P]enal hard treatment [is] an essential aspect of the enterprise of\nmoral communication itself. Punishment, on this view, should aim not\nmerely to communicate censure to the offender, but to persuade the\noffender to recognize and repent the wrong he has done, … and\nto make apologetic reparation to those whom he wronged. [The] hard\ntreatment aspects [of his punishment], the burden it imposes on him,\nshould serve both to assist the process of repentance and reform, by\nfocusing his attention on his crime and its implications, and as a way\nof making the apologetic reparation that he owes. (2013) \nThe problem, however, as Duff is well aware, is that it is not clear\nwhy “hard treatment [is] a necessary aspect of a\ncommunicative enterprise” (2013, emphasis added). Indeed, Lacey\nand Pickard (2015a) suggest that hard treatment actually interferes\nwith the communicative enterprise. \nOne might think it is enough for retributivist accounts of punishment\nif hard treatment can constitute an important part of\ncommunicating to both the wrongdoer and the rest of the community the\ncensure that the wrongdoer deserves. The worry, however, is that it\nmay not suffice to say that hard treatment is one possible method of\ncommunicating censure. Given the normal moral presumptions against\nimposing suffering on others, it may be necessary to show that censure\nalone, unaccompanied by extra suffering, cannot be fully or\nproperly communicated. This may be very hard to show. Though the\npossibility that the value of suffering may depend on the context in\nwhich it is experience or inflicted—see\n section 4.3.1—may\n lighten the burden of proof. \nRetributive justice has a deep grip on the punitive intuitions of most\npeople. Nevertheless, it has been subject to wide-ranging criticism.\nArguably the most worrisome criticism is that theoretical accounts\nof why wrongdoers positively deserve hard treatment are inadequate. If\nthey are inadequate, then retributive justice provides an incomplete\ntheory of punishment, one that at most explains why wrongdoers deserve\ncensure. Even the idea that wrongdoers forfeit the right not to be\nsuffer proportional hard treatment might be better explained by appeal\nto other explanations of why hard treatment (1) is instrumentally\nvaluable, and (2) is consistent with respect for the wrongdoer. \nThe question is, what alternatives are there? Consider, for example,\nthe proposal to replace moral desert with something like institutional\ndesert, i.e., desert based on what the institution prescribes without\nappeal to a prior notion of moral desert. According to this proposal,\na wrongdoer cannot reasonably complain that institutions that threaten\npunishment if she does wrong, and then follow through on the threat if\nshe is duly convicted of wrongdoing, treat her unjustly (Quinn 1985;\nHill 1999; Finkelstein 2004; Bedau & Kelly 2010 [2019: §4]).\nSurely there is utility in having such institutions, and a person\nwould normally have a fair chance to avoid punishment—with the\nrare exception of false convictions—simply by avoiding\nwrongdoing. Nevertheless, this sort of justification of legal\nor institutional desert cannot straightforwardly explain the\nproportionality limit that forms such a core part of the intuitive\nappeal of retributive justice. To explain why the law may not assign\nwhatever punishments the lawmakers reasonably conclude will produce\nthe best effects overall, the idea of retributive justice may be\nessential. \nThis limitation to proportional punishment is central to\nretributivism. The negative desert claim holds that only that much\npunishment may be inflicted, and the positive desert claim holds that\nthat much punishment, but no more, is morally deserved and in\nthat sense respectful of the wrongdoer. Unless one is willing to give\nup on the idea that morality imposes a proportionality limit and on\nthe importance of positive moral desert for justifying punishment up\nto that point as respectful of the individual—both intuitively\ndifficult to give up—there is reason to continue to take notion\nof retributive justice, and the project of justifying it,\nseriously.","contact.mail":"awalen@rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"rutgers.edu"}]
