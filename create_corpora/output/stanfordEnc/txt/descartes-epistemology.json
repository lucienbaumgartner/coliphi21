His noteworthy contributions extend to\nmathematics and physics. This entry focuses on his philosophical\ncontributions in the theory of knowledge. Specifically, the focus is\non the epistemological project of his famous work, Meditations on\nFirst Philosophy. Descartes circulated the Meditations\nto other philosophers for objections and comments. He responded with\ndetailed replies that provide a rich source of further information\nabout the original work. Indeed, six sets of objections and replies\nwere published with the first edition of the Meditations\n(1641), and a seventh set was added with the second edition\n(1642).\n\nI shall refer to the brand of knowledge Descartes seeks in the\nMeditations, as ‘perfect knowledge’. Famously, he\ndefines perfect knowledge in terms of doubt. While distinguishing\nlesser grades of conviction, and perfect knowledge,he writes: \nIn the Second Replies, he adds: \nThese passages (and others) suggest an account wherein doubt is the\ncontrast of certainty. As my certainty increases, my doubt decreases;\nconversely, as my doubt increases, my certainty decreases. The\nrequirement that knowledge is to be based in complete, or perfect\ncertainty, thus amounts to requiring a complete inability to doubt\none’s convictions – an utter indubitability. This\nconception of the relationship between certainty and doubt helps\nunderwrite Descartes’ methodical emphasis on doubt, the\nso-called ‘method of doubt’ (discussed in\n Section 2). \nThat perfect knowledge requires that it be “impossible for us\never to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of”\nmarks an extraordinarily high standard of justification. Is this the\nonly standard deserving of knowledge-talk? This is a\ndifficult question to answer, because Descartes didn’t write in\nEnglish. But arguably he’s an epistemic contextualist,\nat least in the sense of invoking the notion of knowledge in\ndivergent contexts that presuppose different epistemic standards.\nWe’ll see, for example, that he holds that even the deductive\ndemonstrations of expert geometers fall short of the standards needed\nfor perfect knowledge; yet, the kind of terminology he uses to\ncharacterize their epistemic achievements is routinely rendered in\nterms of knowledge-talk, in standard English translations of his\nwork. \nThe certainty/indubitability of interest to Descartes is psychological\nin character, though not merely psychological – not\nsimply an inexplicable feeling. It has also a distinctively epistemic\ncharacter, involving a kind of rational insight. During moments of\ncertainty, it is as if my perception is guided by “a great light\nin the intellect” (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41). This rational\nillumination empowers me to “see utterly clearly with my\nmind’s eye”; my feelings of certainty are\ngrounded – indeed, “I see a manifest\ncontradiction” in denying the proposition of which I’m\nconvinced. (Med. 3, AT 7:36, CSM 2:25) \nDescartes characterizes these epistemically impressive cognitions in\nterms of their being perceived clearly and\ndistinctly. The Meditations never defines these\nterms; indeed, it sometimes uses them in confusing ways (e.g.,\nsometimes using clarity-talk as a shorthand for the\nconjunction of clarity and distinctness). The Principles\noffers the following definitions: \nOther texts indicate that clarity contrasts with obscurity,\nand distinctness with confusedness. Though having clear and\ndistinct apprehension is epistemically impressive, we’ll see\nthat it is merely a necessary condition of perfect knowledge, not a\nsufficient condition. \nShould we regard Descartes’ account of perfect knowledge as a\nversion of the justified true belief analysis of knowledge\ntracing back to Plato? The above texts are among Descartes’\nclearest statements concerning perfect knowledge. Yet they raise\nquestions about the extent to which his account is continuous with\nother analyses of knowledge. Prima facie, his characterizations imply\na justified belief analysis – or using language closer\nto his own (and where justification is construed in terms of\nunshakability), an unshakable conviction analysis.\nThere’s no stated requirement that the would-be knower’s\nconviction is to be true, as opposed to being unshakably\ncertain. Is truth, therefore, not a requirement of perfect\nknowledge? We’ll return to the issue in\n Section 6.4. \nOne way to divide up theories of justification is in terms of the\ninternalism-externalism distinction. Very roughly: a theory of\nepistemic justification is internalist insofar as it requires\nthat the justifying factors are accessible to the knower’s\nconscious awareness; it is externalist insofar as it does not\nimpose this requirement. \nDescartes holds an internalist account requiring that all justifying\nfactors take the form of ideas. Various texts imply that\nideas are, strictly speaking, the only objects of immediate perception\nor awareness. (More on the directness or immediacy of sense perception\nin\n Section 9.1.)\n Independent of assumptions about the directness of perception,\nDescartes’ method of doubt underwrites an assumption with\nsimilar force: for almost the entirety of the Meditations,\nhis meditator-spokesperson – hereafter, the\n‘meditator’ – adopts the methodological assumption\nthat all his thoughts and experiences are occurring in a dream. This\nassumption is tantamount to requiring that justification comes in the\nform of ideas, rather than via direct perception of an extramental\nworld. \nAn important consequence of this kind of interpretation –\nnamely, a traditional representationalist understanding of ideas\n– is that rigorous philosophical inquiry must proceed via an\ninside-to-out strategy. This strategy is assiduously followed in the\nMeditations, and it endures as a hallmark of many early\nmodern epistemologies. Ultimately, all judgments are grounded in an\ninspection of the mind’s ideas. Philosophical inquiry\nis, properly understood, an investigation of ideas. The\nmethodical strategy of the Meditations has the effect of\nforcing readers to adopt this mode of inquiry. \nIn recent years, some commentators have questioned this traditional\nway of understanding the mediating role of ideas. Noteworthy is John\nCarriero’s outstanding commentary on the Meditations\n(2009), an account providing a serious challenge to traditional\nrepresentationalist interpretations (including interpretations\ntypically assumed in the present treatment). \nHow are would-be knowers to proceed in identifying candidates for\nperfect knowledge? Distinguish particularist and methodist answers to\nthe question. The particularist is apt to trust our prima\nfacie intuitions regarding particular knowledge claims. These\nintuitions may then be used to help identify more general epistemic\nprinciples. The methodist, in contrast, is apt to distrust\nour prima facie intuitions. The preference is instead to begin with\ngeneral principles about proper method. The methodical principles may\nthen be used to arrive at settled, reflective judgments concerning\nparticular knowledge claims. \nFamously, Descartes is in the methodist camp. Those who haphazardly\n“direct their minds down untrodden paths” are sometimes\n“lucky enough in their wanderings to hit upon some truth,”\nbut “it is far better,” writes Descartes, “never to\ncontemplate investigating the truth about any matter than to do so\nwithout a method” (Rules 4, AT 10:371, CSM 1:15f). Were\nwe to rely on our prima facie intuitions, we might accept that the\nearth is unmoved, or that ordinary objects (as tables and chairs)\nare just as they appear. Yet, newly emerging\nmechanist doctrines of the 17th century imply otherwise. Descartes\nthinks such cases underscore the unreliability of our prima facie\nintuitions and the need for a method by which to distinguish truth and\nfalsity. \nDescartes’ view is not that all our pre-reflective\nintuitions are mistaken. He concedes that “no sane person has\never seriously doubted” such particular claims as “that\nthere really is a world, and that human beings have bodies”\n(Synopsis, AT 7:16, CSM 2:11). But such pre-reflective judgments may\nbe ill-grounded, even when true. \nThe dialectic of the First Meditation features a confrontation between\nparticularism and methodism, with methodism emerging the victor. For\nexample, the meditator (while voicing empiricist sensibilities) puts\nforward, as candidates for the foundations of knowledge, such prima\nfacie obvious claims as “that I am here, sitting by the fire,\nwearing a winter dressing-gown, holding this piece of paper in my\nhands, and so on” – particular matters “about which\ndoubt is quite impossible,” or so it would seem (AT 7:18, CSM\n2:12f). In response (and at each level of the dialectic), Descartes\ninvokes his own methodical principles to show that the prima facie\nobviousness of such particular claims is insufficient to meet the\nburden of proof. \nAnother methodological feature of the Meditations is its\nfirst-person, meditative character. Gary Hatfield explains. \nDescartes’ commitment to innate ideas places him in a\nrationalist tradition tracing back to Plato. Knowledge of the nature\nof reality derives from ideas of the intellect, not the external\nsenses. An important part of metaphysical inquiry therefore involves\nlearning to think with the intellect. Plato’s allegory of the\ncave portrays this rationalist theme in terms of epistemically\ndistinct worlds: what the senses reveal is likened to shadowy imagery\non the wall of a poorly lit cave; what the intellect reveals is\nlikened to a world of fully real beings illuminated by bright\nsunshine. The metaphor aptly depicts our epistemic predicament given\nDescartes’ own doctrines. An important function of his methods\nis to help would-be perfect knowers redirect their attention from the\nconfused imagery of the senses to the luminous world of clear and\ndistinct ideas of the intellect. \nFurther comparisons arise with Plato’s doctrine of recollection.\nIn the Fifth Meditation, in connection with the discovery of innate\ntruths within, the meditator remarks: “on first discovering them\nit seems that I am not so much learning something new as remembering\nwhat I knew before” (Med. 5, AT 7:64, CSM 2:44). Elsewhere\nDescartes adds, of innate truths:  \nThe famous “wax” thought experiment of the Second\nMeditation is supposed to illustrate (among other things) a procedure\nto “dig out” what is innate. The thought experiment\npurports to help the meditator achieve a “purely mental\nscrutiny,” thereby apprehending more easily the innate idea of\nbody. (Med. 2, AT 7:30f, CSM 2:20f) According to Descartes, our minds\ncome stocked with a variety of intellectual concepts – ideas\nwhose content is independent of experience. This storehouse includes\nideas in mathematics, logic, and metaphysics. Interestingly, Descartes\nholds that even our sensory ideas involve innate content. On his\nunderstanding of the new mechanical physics, bodies have no real\nproperties resembling our sensory ideas of colors, sounds, tastes, and\nthe like, thus implying that the content of such ideas draws from the\nmind itself. But if even these sensory ideas count as innate, how then\nare we to characterize the doctrine of innateness? Importantly, the\nformation of these sensory ideas – unlike purely intellectual\nconcepts – depends on sensory stimulation. On one plausible\nunderstanding, Descartes’ official doctrine has it that ideas\nare innate insofar as their content derives from the nature\nof the mind alone, as opposed to deriving from sense experience (cf.\nNewman 2006). This characterization allows that both intellectual and\nsensory concepts draw on native resources, though not to the same\nextent. \nThough the subject of rationalism in Descartes’ epistemology\ndeserves careful attention, the present article generally focuses on\nDescartes’ efforts to achieve perfect knowledge. Relatively\nlittle attention is given to his doctrine of innateness, or, more\ngenerally, his ontology of thought. \nFurther reading: For a contrary understanding of\nDescartes’ conception of scientia, see Jolley (2013).\nOn the internalism-externalism distinction, see Alston (1989) and\nPlantinga (1993).

That Descartes’ method\neffectively pays homage to Aristotle is, of course, welcome by his\nAristotelian audience. But Descartes views Aristotle’s\nfoundationalist principles as incomplete, at least when applied to\nmetaphysical inquiry. His method of doubt is intended to complement\nfoundationalism. The two methods are supposed to work in cooperation,\nas conveyed in the above quotation. Let’s consider each\nmethod. \nThe central insight of foundationalism is to organize knowledge in the\nmanner of a well-structured, architectural edifice. Such an edifice\nowes its structural integrity to two kinds of features: a firm\nfoundation and a superstructure of support beams\nfirmly anchored to the foundation. A system of justified beliefs might\nbe organized by two analogous features: a foundation of unshakable\nfirst principles, and a superstructure of further propositions\nanchored to the foundation via unshakable inference. \nExemplary of a foundationalist system is Euclid’s geometry.\nEuclid begins with a foundation of first principles –\ndefinitions, postulates, and axioms or common notions – on which\nhe then bases a superstructure of further propositions.\nDescartes’ own designs for metaphysical knowledge are inspired\nby Euclid’s system: \nIt would be misleading to characterize the arguments of the\nMeditations as unfolding straightforwardly according to\ngeometric method (cf. Curley 2006, 31). But Descartes maintains that\nthey can be reconstructed as such, and he expressly does so\nat the end of the Second Replies – providing a\n“geometrical” exposition of some of his central lines of\nargument, organized as definitions, postulates,\naxioms or common notions, and propositions (AT\n7:160–70, CSM 2:113–120). \nAs noted above, the Meditations contains a destructive\ncomponent that Descartes likens to the architect’s preparations\nfor laying a foundation. Though the component finds no analogue in the\nmethods of geometers, Descartes appears to hold that it is needed in\nmetaphysical inquiry. The discovery of Euclid’s first principles\n(some of them, at any rate) is comparatively unproblematic: such\nprinciples as that things which are equal to the same thing are\nalso equal to one another accord not only with reason, but with\nthe senses. In contrast, metaphysical inquiry might have first\nprinciples that conflict with the senses: \nAmong Descartes’ persistent themes is that such preconceived\nopinions can obscure our mental vision of innate principles: that\nwhere there are disputes about first principles, it is not\n“because one man’s faculty of knowledge extends more\nwidely than another’s, but because the common notions are in\nconflict with the preconceived opinions of some people who, as a\nresult, cannot easily grasp them”; whereas, “we cannot\nfail to know them [innate common notions] when the occasion for\nthinking about them arises, provided that we are not blinded by\npreconceived opinions” (Prin. 1:49f, AT 8a:24, CSM\n1:209). These “preconceived opinions” must be “set\naside,” says Descartes, “in order to lay the first\nfoundations of philosophy” (May 1643 letter to Voetius, AT\n8b:37, CSMK 221). Otherwise, we’re apt to regard, as\nfirst principles, the mistaken (though prima facie obvious) sensory\nclaims that particularists find attractive. Such mistakes in the\nlaying of the foundations weaken the entire edifice. Descartes\nadds: \nThough foundationalism brilliantly allows for the expansion of\nknowledge from first principles, Descartes thinks that a complementary\nmethod is needed to help us discover genuine first principles. As\nHatfield writes, “the problem is not to carry out proofs (which\nmight well be assented to, given the definitions and axioms), but to\ndiscover the axioms themselves (which are hopelessly obscured by the\nprejudices of the senses)” (1986, 71). Descartes therefore\ndevises the method of doubt for this purpose – a method to help\n“set aside” preconceived opinions. \nDescartes opens the First Meditation asserting the need “to\ndemolish everything completely and start again right from the\nfoundations” (AT 7:17, CSM 2:12). The passage adds: \nIn the architectural analogy, we can think of bulldozers as the ground\nclearing tools of demolition. For knowledge building, Descartes\nconstrues sceptical doubts as the ground clearing tools of\nepistemic demolition. Bulldozers undermine literal ground;\ndoubt undermines epistemic ground. Using sceptical doubts, the\nmeditator shows how to find “some reason for doubt” in all\nhis preexisting claims to knowledge. \nThe ultimate aim of the method is constructive. Unlike “the\nsceptics, who doubt only for the sake of doubting,” Descartes\naims “to reach certainty – to cast aside the loose earth\nand sand so as to come upon rock or clay” (Discourse 3,\nAT 6:29, CSM 1:125). Bulldozers are typically used for destructive\nends, as are sceptical doubts. Descartes’ methodical innovation\nis to employ demolition for constructive ends. Where a\nbulldozer’s force overpowers the ground, its effects are\ndestructive. Where the ground’s firmness resists the\nbulldozer’s force, the bulldozer might be used constructively\n– using it to reveal the ground as firm. Descartes thus\nuses sceptical doubts to test the firmness of candidates put forward\nfor the foundations of knowledge. \nAccording to at least one prominent critic, this employment of\nsceptical doubt is unnecessary and excessive. Writes Gassendi: \nHere, Gassendi singles out two features of methodical doubt –\nits universal and hyperbolic character. In reply,\nDescartes remarks: \nEvidently, Descartes holds that the universal and\nhyperbolic character of methodical doubt is helpful to its\nsuccess. Further appeal to the architectural analogy helps elucidate\nwhy. \nConsider first the universal character of doubt – the\nneed “to demolish everything completely and start again right\nfrom the foundations.” The point is not merely to apply doubt to\nall candidates for perfect knowledge, but to apply doubt\ncollectively. Descartes offers the following analogy: \nThat even one falsehood would be mistakenly treated as a genuine first\nprinciple – say, the belief that the senses are\nreliable, or that ancient authorities should be trusted\n– threatens to spread falsehood to other beliefs in the system.\nA collective doubt helps avoid such mistakes. It ensures that the\nmethod only approves candidate first principles that are unshakable in\ntheir own right: it rules out that the appearance of unshakability is\nowed to logical relations with other principles, themselves not\nsubjected to doubt. \nHow is the hyperbolic character of methodical doubt supposed\nto contribute to the method’s success? The architectural analogy\nis again helpful. Suppose that an architect is vigilant in employing a\nuniversal/collective doubt. Suppose, further, that she attempts to use\nbulldozers for constructive purposes. A problem nonetheless arises.\nHow big a bulldozer is she to use? A light-duty bulldozer might be\nunable to distinguish a medium-sized boulder, and immovable bedrock.\nIn both cases, the ground would appear immovable. Descartes\ntakes the solution to lie in using not light-duty, but\nheavy-duty tools of demolition – the bigger the\nbulldozer, the better. The lesson is clear for the epistemic builder:\nthe more hyperbolic the doubt, the better. \nA potential problem remains. Does not the problem of the\n“light-duty bulldozer” repeat itself? No matter how firm\none’s ground, might it not be dislodged in the face of a yet\nbigger bulldozer? This raises the worry that there might not\nbe unshakable ground, as opposed to ground which is\nyet unshaken. Descartes’ goal of utterly\nindubitable epistemic ground may simply be elusive. \nPerhaps the architectural analogy breaks down in a manner that serves\nDescartes well. For though there is no most-powerful literal\nbulldozer, perhaps epistemic bulldozing is not subject to this\nlimitation. Descartes seems to think that there is a\nmost-powerful doubt – a doubt than which none more\nhyperbolic can be conceived. The Evil Genius Doubt (and equivalent\ndoubts) is supposed to fit the bill. If the method reveals epistemic\nground that stands fast in the face of a doubt this\nhyperbolic, then, as Descartes seems to hold, this counts as epistemic\nbedrock if anything does. \nHence the importance of the universal and hyperbolic\ncharacter of the method of doubt. Gassendi’s suggestion that we\nforego methodical doubt in favor of a “simple and brief\nstatement to the effect that [we’re] regarding [our] previous\nknowledge as uncertain” misses the intended point of the\nmethod. \nDescartes’ method of doubt has been subject to numerous\nobjections – some fair, others less so. Rendered in the terms\nDescartes himself employs, the method is arguably less flawed than its\nreputation. Let us consider some of the common objections. Two such\nobjections are suggested in a passage from the pragmatist Peirce: \nNote, however, that the procedure of the Meditations is not\nthat universal doubt is supposed to flow simply from adherence to a\nmaxim; to the contrary, the doubt is supposed to flow from careful\nattention to positive reasons for doubt – recall the express\nresolution to find “at least some reason for doubt” in\none’s prior opinions. Descartes introduces sceptical arguments\nprecisely in acknowledgement that we need such reasons: \nA second objection is suggested by Peirce’s reference to a\n“doubt in our hearts.” Here, we should distinguish two\nkinds of doubt, in terms of two kinds of ways that doubt can defeat\nknowledge. Some doubts purport to undermine one’s conviction or\nbelief – call these ‘belief-defeating’\ndoubts. Other doubts purport to undermine one’s justification\n(whether or not they undermine belief) – call these\n‘justification-defeating’ doubts. What Peirce\ncalls a ‘doubt in our hearts’ is strongly suggestive of a\nbelief-defeating doubt. Is Peirce therefore right that only\nbelief-defeating doubts can undermine knowledge? Longstanding\ntraditions in philosophy acknowledge that there may be truths we\nbelieve in our hearts (as it were), but which we do not know.\nThis is one of the intended lessons of methodical doubt. The sceptical\nscenarios are supposed to help us appreciate that though we believe\nthat 2+3=5, and believe that we’re awake, and believe\nthere’s an external world, we may nonetheless lack perfect\nknowledge. As already noted, Descartes writes of external world doubt\nthat “no sane person has ever seriously doubted” such\nmatters – a remark perhaps best understood in terms of\nbelief-defeating doubt. Justification-defeating doubts are sufficient\nto undermine perfect knowledge, and this is the sort of doubt put\nforward in the First Meditation. \nA related objection has the method calling not merely for doubt, but\nfor disbelief or dissent. One of Gassendi’s objections reads in\nthis manner. He seems to take Descartes to be urging us, quite\nliterally, to “consider everything as false,” a strategy\nwhich, as he says to Descartes, “made it necessary for you to\nconvince yourself” of the sceptical hypotheses. Based on\nDescartes’ most careful statements, however, his method does not\nrequire a dissent from the statements it undermines. Rather, the\nmethod urges us to “hold back [our] assent from opinions which\nare not completely certain and indubitable just as carefully as [we]\ndo from those which are patently false” (Med. 1, AT 7:18, CSM\n2:12, cf. AT 7:461). \nFinally, a common objection has it that the universality of doubt\nundermines the method of doubt itself, since, for example,\nthe sceptical hypotheses themselves are dubious. Descartes\nthinks this misses the point of the method: namely, to extend doubt\nuniversally to candidates for knowledge, but not also to the\nvery tools for founding knowledge. As he concedes: “there may be\nreasons which are strong enough to compel us to doubt, even though\nthese reasons are themselves doubtful, and hence are not to be\nretained later on” (Replies 7, AT 7:473f, CSM 2:319). \nFurther reading: On foundationalism: for Descartes’\ntreatment, see Discourse, First Meditation, and Seventh\nObjections and Replies; for its treatment by ancients, see Euclid\n(1956) and Aristotle (Posterior Analytics); by interpreters\nof Descartes, see Sosa (1997a) and Van Cleve (1979). On Cartesian\ninference, see Gaukroger (1989) and Hacking (1980). On methodical\ndoubt: for Descartes’ treatment, see Rules,\nDiscourse, First Meditation, and Seventh Replies; by\ncommentators, see Frankfurt (1970), Garber (1986), Larmore (2014),\nNewman (2006), Williams (1983), and Wilson (1978). On needing reasons\nfor doubt (contrary to direct voluntarism), see Newman (2007). On the\nanalysis-synthesis distinction (closely related to issues of doubt and\nmethodology): see the Second Replies (AT 7:155ff); see also Arnauld\n(1964, 4:2f), Curley (1986), Galileo (1967, 50f), Hintikka (1978), and\nNewman (2019). \nHistorically, there are at least two distinct dream-related doubts.\nThe one doubt undermines the judgment that I am presently\nawake – call this the ‘Now Dreaming Doubt’. The\nother doubt undermines the judgment that I am ever awake\n(i.e., in the way normally supposed) – call this the\n‘Always Dreaming Doubt’. A textual case can be made on\nbehalf of both formulations being raised in the\nMeditations. \nBoth doubts appeal to some version of the thesis that the experiences\nwe take as dreams are (at their best) qualitatively similar to those\nwe take as waking – call this the ‘Similarity\nThesis’. The Similarity Thesis may be formulated in a variety of\nstrengths. A strong Similarity Thesis might contend that some dreams\nseem experientially similar to waking, even on hindsight subsequent to\nwaking; a weaker rendering of the thesis might contend merely that\ndreams seem similar to waking while having them, but\nnot upon waking. Arguably, the sceptical doubt is equally potent on\neither rendering. Even so, on the most natural reading, the First\nMeditation passage seems to suggest the stronger view, with its\nreference to “exactly similar thoughts”: \nAs for the range of experiences that we can suppose dreams able to\nimitate, Descartes looks to hold that every kind of sensory\nexperience is subject to the doubt. He writes: “every sensory\nexperience I have ever thought I was having while awake I can also\nthink of myself as sometimes having while asleep” (Med. 6, AT\n7:77, CSM 2:53). \nThe Similarity Thesis is sufficient to generate straightaway the Now\nDreaming Doubt. Since I can think of a dream as being qualitatively\nsimilar to my present experience, then, for all I know, I am now\ndreaming. \nRecall that Descartes’ method requires only a\njustification-defeating doubt, not a belief-defeating doubt. To lack\nperfect knowledge of my being awake, I need not give up my\nbelief that I’m awake; nor need that belief be false\n– I might, in fact, be awake. The Now Dreaming Doubt\ndoes its epistemic damage so long as it undermines my reasons for\nbelieving I’m awake. And at this stage of the\nMeditations, Descartes thinks that it does: “there are\nnever any sure signs by means of which being awake can be\ndistinguished from being asleep” (Med. 1, AT 7:19, CSM\n2:13). \nThe conclusion – that I don’t perfectly know that\nI’m now awake – has widespread sceptical consequences. For\nif I don’t know this, then neither do I know that I’m now\n“holding this piece of paper in my hands,” to cite an\nexample the meditator had supposed to be “quite\nimpossible” to doubt. Reflection on the Now Dreaming Doubt\nchanges his mind. He comes around to the view that, for all he knows,\nthe sensible objects of his present experience are mere figments of a\nvivid dream. \nMuch ado has been made about whether dreaming arguments are\nself-refuting. According to an influential objection, similarity\ntheses presuppose that we can reliably distinguish dreams and\nwaking – we need first to distinguish them, in order to compare\nthem; yet the conclusion of dreaming arguments entails that we\ncannot reliably distinguish. Therefore, if the conclusion of\nsuch an argument is true, then the premise invoking the Similarity\nThesis cannot be. Some formulations of dreaming arguments are indeed\nself-refuting in this way. Of present interest is whether all\nare – specifically, whether Descartes makes the mistake.\nInterestingly, he does not. His formulation presupposes simply the\ntruism that we do, in fact, make a distinction between dreaming and\nwaking (never mind whether reliably). He states the relevant premise\nin terms of what we think of as dreams, versus what we\nthink of as waking: “every sensory experience I have\never thought I was having while awake I can also\nthink of myself as sometimes having while asleep” (AT\n7:77, CSM 2:53, italics added). This formulation avoids the charge of\nself-refutation, for it is compatible with the conclusion that we\ncannot reliably distinguish dreams and waking. \nDoes Descartes also put forward a second dreaming argument, the Always\nDreaming Doubt? There is strong textual evidence to support this (see\nNewman 1994), though it is by no means the standard interpretation.\nThe conclusion of the Always Dreaming Doubt is generated from the very\nsame Similarity Thesis, together with a further sceptical assumption,\nnamely: that for all I know, the processes producing what I take as\nwaking are no more veridical than those producing what I take as\ndreams. As the meditator puts it:  \nThe aim of the Always Dreaming Doubt is to undermine not whether\nI’m now awake, but whether so-called “sensation” is\nproduced by external objects even on the assumption that I am\nnow awake. For in the cases of both waking and dreaming, my cognitive\naccess extends only to the productive result, but not the\nproductive process. On what basis, then, do I conclude that\nthe productive processes are different – that external objects\nplay more of a role in waking than in dreaming? For all I know, both\nsorts of experience are produced by some subconscious faculty of my\nmind. As Descartes has his meditator say: \nThe sceptical consequences of the Always Dreaming Doubt are even more\ndevastating than those of the Now Dreaming Doubt. If I do not know\nthat “normal waking” experience is produced by external\nobjects, then, for all I know, all of my experiences might be\ndreams of a sort. For all I know, there might not be\nan external world. My best evidence of an external world derives from\nmy preconceived opinion that external world objects produce my waking\nexperiences. Yet the Always Dreaming Doubt calls this into\nquestion: \nThe two dreaming doubts are parasitic on the same Similarity Thesis,\nthough their sceptical consequences differ. The Now Dreaming Doubt\nraises the universal possibility of delusion: for any one of\nmy sensory experiences, it is possible (for all I know) that the\nexperience is delusive. The Always Dreaming Doubt raises the\npossibility of universal delusion: it is possible (for all I\nknow) that all my sensory experiences are delusions (say, from a\nGod’s-eye perspective). \nThough dreaming doubts do significant demolition work, they are\nlight-duty bulldozers relative to Descartes’ most power\nsceptical doubt. What further judgments are left to be undermined?\nFollowing the discussion of dreaming, the meditator tentatively\nconcludes that the results of empirical disciplines “are\ndoubtful” – e.g., “physics, astronomy,\nmedicine,” and the like. Whereas: \nEarly in the Third Meditation, it emerges that even truths this\n“simple and straightforward” are subject to hyperbolic\ndoubt (AT 7:35f, CSM 2:25). And immediately following the above First\nMeditation passage, Descartes introduces his most hyperbolic doubt\n– the hypothesis of an all-powerful deceiver. \nThere is variation in the interpretation of the doubt, even concerning\nthe number of deceivers Descartes means to be citing. I suggest that a\nnatural reading of the First Meditation passages provides for a\nunified account of a deceiver hypothesis. The passage represents the\nmeditator as having long believed in a creator who’s both\nall-powerful and all-good. Here’s the thinking that seems to\nfollow from such belief. A creator with these attributes would not\nallow its creatures to be deceived about the existence of the external\nworld, nor about such transparent truths as that 2+3=5. But likewise,\nneither should a creator with these attributes allow its creatures\never to be deceived. Yet they are. Since even occasional\ndeception seems to pose a reductio on the very existence of\nan all-powerful, all-good creator, the implication is that the creator\n(if there be one) must be lacking in either power or goodness. Suppose\nthe creator is all-powerful but not all-good – i.e., an\n“evil genius” of sorts. In that case, it seems we might be\ndeceived about even the most evident of matters. \nThis summary offers a coherent basis for a truly hyperbolic doubt. And\nnotice that the summary makes good sense of both of the following\nFirst Meditation passages, suggesting each is part of a continuous\nworry about the very same deceiver who’s all-powerful, but not\nall-good: \nAnd yet firmly rooted in my mind is the long-standing opinion that\nthere is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am.\nHow do I know that he has not brought it about that there is no earth,\nno sky, no extended thing, no shape, no size, no place, while at the\nsame time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as\nthey do now? What is more, since I sometimes believe that others go\nastray in cases where they think they have the most perfect knowledge,\nmay I not similarly go wrong every time I add two and three or count\nthe sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is\nimaginable? But perhaps God would not have allowed me to be deceived\nin this way, since he is said to be supremely good. But if it were\ninconsistent with his goodness to have created me such that I am\ndeceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his goodness\nto allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last assertion\ncannot be made. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14) \nI will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the\nsource of truth, but rather some malicious demon [mauvais\ngénie] of the utmost power and cunning has employed all\nhis energies in order to deceive me. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:15) \nSome commentators take these passages to introduce two separate\ndeceivers – distinguishing the evil genius (mauvais\ngénie) from the deceiving God (cf. Gouhier 1937, 163). But\nthis introduces needless complication without sufficient textual\njustification. The deceptions of both deceivers derive from having\nsupreme power, while lacking in goodness. And note that Descartes\nexpresses ambivalence as to whether even to refer to a deceiver as\n“God”: while invoking hyperbolic doubt, the Second\nMeditation references the deceiver as “a God, or whatever I may\ncall him” (AT 7:24, CSM 2:16). In any case, a single deceiver\nhypothesis will hereafter be assumed, referring to it by its popular\ndesignation, the “Evil Genius Doubt.” \nIt is tempting to assume that the Evil Genius Doubt draws its\nsceptical force from the “utmost power” attributed to the\ndeceiver. Clear texts suggest a different reading. Descartes contends\nthat an equally powerful doubt derives from the supposition that we\nare not the creatures of an all-powerful creator. Recall that the\nabove reductio reasoning implies simply that the creator\ncannot be both all-powerful and all-good. Suppose, then, that we\ngive-up the assumption that the creator is all-powerful. The passage\ncontinues: \nThat is, this assumption, too, generates hyperbolic sceptical\nconsequences. Descartes makes the same point in a parallel passage of\nthe Principles: \nDescartes’ official position is that the Evil Genius Doubt is\nmerely one among multiple hypotheses that can motivate the more\ngeneral hyperbolic doubt. (See Cunning 2014, 68ff, and Hatfield 2006,\n126, for variations on this theme.) Fundamentally, the more general\ndoubt is about our cognitive nature, that is, about the\npossibility our minds are flawed. The First Meditation texts are\nsomewhat ambiguous on this count. But later passages are very clear (a\ntheme we’ll develop more fully in\n Section 4.3). \nWhat is essential to the doubt is not the specific story about the\norigin of our cognitive wiring; it’s instead the realization\n– regardless the story – that for all we know, our\ncognitive wiring is flawed. Even so, I regularly speak in terms of the\nevil genius (following Descartes’ lead), as a kind of\nmnemonic for the more general doubt about our cognitive nature. \nHaving introduced the Evil Genius Doubt, the First Meditation program\nof demolition is not only hyperbolic but universal.\nAs the meditator remarks, I “am finally compelled to admit that\nthere is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not\nproperly be raised” (Med. 1, AT 7:21, CSM 2:14f). As will\nemerge, the early paragraphs of the Third Meditation clarify a further\nnuance of the Evil Genius Doubt – a nuance consistently observed\nthereafter. Descartes clarifies, there, that the Evil Genius Doubt\noperates in an indirect manner (a topic to which we return in\n Section 4.3). \nFurther reading: On Descartes’ sceptical arguments, see\nBouwsma (1949), Cunning (2014), Curley (1978), Hatfield (2006),\nLarmore (2014), Newman (1994), Newman and Nelson (1999), Williams\n(1986 and 1995). For a contrary reading of the Evil Genius Doubt, see\nGewirth (1941) and Wilson (1978). For a more general philosophical\ntreatment of dreaming arguments, see Dunlap (1977) and Williams\n(1978). \nFamously, Descartes puts forward a very simple candidate as the\n“first item of knowledge.” The candidate is suggested by\nmethodical doubt – by the very effort at thinking all\nmy thoughts might be mistaken. Early in the Second Meditation,\nDescartes has his meditator observe: \nAs the canonical formulation has it, I think therefore I am\n(Latin: cogito ergo sum; French: je pense, donc\nje suis) – a formulation does not expressly appear in the\nMeditations. Descartes regards the\n‘cogito’ (as it is often referred to) as the\n“first and most certain of all to occur to anyone who\nphilosophizes in an orderly way” (Prin. 1:7, AT8a:7,\nCSM 1:195). Is the great certainty of the cogito supposed to\nattach to the “I think,” the “I am,” or the\n“therefore” (i.e., their logical relation)? Presumably, it\nmust attach to all of these, if the cogito is to play the\nfoundational role Descartes assigns to it. But this answer can seem to\ndepend on whether the cogito is understood as an inference or\nan intuition – an issue we address below. \nTesting the cogito by means of methodical doubt is supposed\nto reveal its unshakable certainty. Hyperbolic doubt helps me\nappreciate that the existence of my body is subject to doubt, whereas\nthe existence of my thinking is not. The very attempt at thinking\naway my thinking is indeed self-stultifying. \nThe cogito raises numerous philosophical questions and has\ngenerated an enormous literature. The most significant ongoing debate\nconcerns whether Descartes intends the cogito to be an\nintuition (i.e., roughly, self-evident), or instead an\ninference. \nIn an influential 1962 paper, Jaakko Hintikka’s argues that it\nshould be understood non-inferentially, as a performative utterance.\nOn his analysis, I exist doesn’t follow logically from\nI think, nor does Descartes suppose otherwise. Rather, the\ntransition from I think to I exist is non-logical\n– indeed, the statement that “I do not exist” is not\nlogically incoherent. The key point, according to Hintikka, is that\nthe very act of thinking that statement – the cognitive\nperformance – is existentially incoherent: I cannot\nboth think the statement and believe it to be true. Hintikka\ntakes the emphasis on “cogito” as intended “to\nexpress the performatory character of Descartes’s insight; it\nrefers to the ‘performance’ (to the act of thinking)\nthrough which the sentence ‘I exist’ may be said to verify\nitself” (1962, 17). \nThe following Second Replies text can seem supportive of a\nnon-inferential reading: \nHowever, as Margaret Wilson correctly observes, “the claim that\nthe cogito is an inference … is not equivalent to the\nclaim that it is a syllogism” (1978, 56). The passage only\nexpressly rejects the effort to understand the cogito in\nterms of syllogism, but not necessarily in terms of inference. \nFurther, it should be noted that inferential interpretations need not\nreject that the cogito counts also as an intuition.\nThere’s no inconsistency in claiming a self-evident grasp of a\nproposition that has inferential structure. It is indeed widely held\namong philosophers that modus ponens is self-evident, yet it\ncontains an inference. In short, that a statement contains an\ninference does not entail that one’s acceptance of it is\ngrounded in inference – a fact applicable to the\ncogito. Curley helpfully notes that Descartes\n“consistently blurs the distinction between inferences and\npropositions by referring to the whole formula ‘I think,\ntherefore I am’ as a truth, a first principle, a proposition,\nand a conclusion” (1978, 79). Kenny adds that, for Descartes,\n“what is from one point of view intuited is from another point\nof view deduced” (1968, 55), citing Rules 3 as\nsupport. \nA related point concerns the absence of an express\n‘ergo’ (‘therefore’) in the Second\nMeditation account – as if indicating the absence of inference\nin that passage. Arguably, the Second Meditation passage is the one\nplace (of his various published treatments ) where Descartes\nexplicitly details a line of inferential reflection leading up to the\nconclusion that I am, I exist. His other treatments\nmerely say the ‘therefore’; the Second Meditation\nunpacks it. \nWhatever the cogito’s inferential status, it is worth\nnoting a twofold observation of Barry Stroud: “a thinker\nobviously could never be wrong in thinking ‘I\nthink’,” moreover, “no one who thinks could think\nfalsely that he exists” (2008, 518). \nFurther issues about the cogito are worth clarifying –\nlet’s cover a few points in summary fashion. First, a\nfirst-person formulation is essential to the certainty of the\ncogito. Third-person claims, such as “Icarus\nthinks,” or “Descartes thinks,” are not unshakably\ncertain – not for me, at any rate; only the occurrence\nof my thought has a chance of resisting hyperbolic doubt.\nThere are a number of passages in which Descartes refers to a\nthird-person version of the cogito. But none of these occurs\nin the context of establishing the actual existence of a particular\nthinker (in contrast with the conditional, general result that\nwhatever thinks exists). \nSecond, a present tense formulation is essential to the certainty of\nthe cogito. It’s no good to reason that “I\nexisted last Tuesday, since I recall that I was thinking on that\nday.” For all I know, I’m now merely dreaming about that\noccasion. Nor does it work to reason that “I’ll continue\nto exist, since I’m now thinking.” As the meditator\nremarks, “it could be that were I totally to cease from\nthinking, I should totally cease to exist” (Med. 2, AT 7:27, CSM\n2:18). The privileged certainty of the cogito is grounded in\nthe “manifest contradiction” (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25) of trying\nto think away my present thinking. \nThird, the certainty of the cogito depends on being\nformulated in terms of cogitatio – i.e., my thinking,\nor awareness/consciousness more generally. Any mode of thinking is\nsufficient, including doubting, affirming, denying, willing,\nunderstanding, imagining, and so on (cf. Med. 2, AT 7:28). My\nbodily activities, however, are insufficient. For instance,\nit’s no good to reason that “I exist, since I am\nwalking,” because methodical doubt calls into question the\nexistence of my legs. Maybe I’m just dreaming that I have legs.\nA simple revision, such as “I exist, since it seems\nI’m walking,” restores the anti-sceptical potency (cf.\nReplies 5, AT 7:352; Prin. 1:9). \nFourth, a caveat is in order. That Descartes rejects formulations\npresupposing the existence of a body commits him to no more than an\nepistemic distinction between the ideas of mind and body, but not\n(yet) an ontological distinction (as in mind-body dualism). Indeed, in\nthe passage following the cogito, Descartes has his meditator\nsay:  \nIn short, the intended epistemic success of the cogito does\nnot presuppose any particular mind-body ontology. \nFinally, Descartes’ reference to an “I”, in the\n“I think,” is not intended to presuppose the existence of\na substantial self. In the very next sentence following the\ninitial statement of the cogito, the meditator says:\n“But I do not yet have a sufficient understanding of what this\n‘I’ is, that now necessarily exists” (AT 7:25, CSM\n2:17). As Stephen Menn writes: \nThe cogito purports to yield certainty that I exist\ninsofar as I am a thinking thing, whatever that turns out\nto be. The ensuing discussion is intended to help arrive at an\nunderstanding of the ontological nature of the thinking subject. \nMore generally, we should distinguish issues of epistemic and\nontological dependence. In the final analysis, Descartes thinks he\nshows that the occurrence of thought depends (ontologically) on the\nexistence of a substantial self – to wit, on the existence of an\ninfinite substance, namely God (cf. Med. 3, AT 7:48ff). But he denies\nthat an acceptance of these ontological matters is epistemically prior\nto the cogito: its certainty is not supposed to depend\n(epistemically) on the abstruse metaphysics that Descartes thinks he\neventually establishes. (See Vinci 1998 for an alternative\nreading.) \nIf the cogito does not presuppose a substantial self, what\nthen is the epistemic basis for injecting the “I” into the\n“I think”? Some critics have complained that, in referring\nto the “I”, Descartes begs the question by presupposing\nwhat he means to establish in the “I exist.” Among the\ncritics, Bertrand Russell objects that “the word ‘I’\nis really illegitimate.” Echoing the 18th century thinker, Georg\nLichtenberg, Russell writes that Descartes should have, instead,\nstated “his ultimate premiss in the form ‘there are\nthoughts’.” Russell adds that “the word\n‘I’ is grammatically convenient, but does not describe a\ndatum.” (1945, 567) Accordingly, “there is pain” and\n“I am in pain” have different contents, and Descartes is\nentitled only to the former. \nOne effort at reply has it that introspection reveals more than what\nRussell allows – it reveals the subjective character of\nexperience. On this view, there is more to the experiential story of\nbeing in pain than is expressed by saying that there is\npain: the experience includes the feeling of pain plus a\npoint-of-view – an experiential addition that’s\ndifficult to characterize except by adding that “I” am in\npain, that the pain is mine. Importantly, my awareness of\nthis subjective feature of experience does not depend on an awareness\nof the metaphysical nature of a thinking subject. If we take Descartes\nto be using ‘I’ to signify this subjective character, then\nhe is not smuggling in something that’s not already there: the\n“I”-ness of consciousness turns out to be (contra Russell)\na primary datum of experience. Though, as Hume persuasively argues,\nintrospection reveals no sense impressions suited to the role\nof a thinking subject, Descartes, unlike Hume, has no need to derive\nall our ideas from sense impressions. Descartes’ idea of the\nself does ultimately draw on innate conceptual resources. \nBut how could ideas deriving from the subjective character of\nexperience justify a substantive metaphysical conclusion about the\nexistence of a real self? On one plausible line of reply, Descartes\ndoes not yet intend to be establishing the metaphysical\nresult; rather, the initial intended result is merely epistemic, but\nnot (yet) fully justified. This line of interpretation does, of\ncourse, imply that the cogito does not initially count as\nperfect knowledge – an issue to which we now turn. \nThe extraordinary certainty and doubt-resistance of the\ncogito marks an Archimedean turning point in the\nmeditator’s inquiry. However, there are interpretive disputes\nabout whether Descartes intends the cogito to count –\nat its initial introduction, prior to the arguments for God – as\nfully indubitable, and therefore as perfect knowledge. It is\nquite common to interpret the cogito as being the first item\nof perfect knowledge. In\n Section 6.1\n we’ll explore how such interpretations (i.e., Bounded Doubt\nInterpretations) render Descartes broader argument. But here, I want\nto develop the textual case for holding that even the cogito\nis undermined by Evil Genius Doubt. \nThere is no disputing that Descartes characterizes the cogito\nas the “first item of knowledge [cognitione]”\n(Med. 3, AT 7:35, CSM 2:24), and as the first “piece of\nknowledge [cognitio]” (Prin. 1:7, AT 8a:7, CSM\n1:195). Noteworthy, however, is the Latin terminology Descartes uses\nin these characterizations (‘cognitio’ and its\ncognates). As noted at the outset, Descartes is a contextualist in the\nsense of invoking the notion of knowledge in divergent\ncontexts that presuppose very different epistemic standards. Of\nparticular interest is that he expressly clarifies that contexts aptly\ncharacterized in terms of cognitio-talk do not necessary\ncount as perfect knowledge: \nThis alone does not prove that the cogito is not intended to\ncount as perfect knowledge. However, it does undercut the argument\nwhereby calling it the “first item of knowledge”\nshows that Descartes intends it as perfect knowledge. \nMore generally, a wide range of clear texts support (what I’ll\ncall) the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis – a thesis with\nimplications for the debate about the cogito. Consider the\nfollowing texts, each arising in a context of clarifying the\nrequirements of perfect knowledge (italics are added): \nFor if I do not know this [i.e., “whether there is a God, and,\nif there is, whether he can be a deceiver”], it seems that I can\nnever be quite certain about anything else. (Med. 3, AT 7:36,\nCSM 2:25) \nI see that the certainty of all other things depends on this\n[i.e., “that the supreme being exists”], so that without\nit nothing can ever be perfectly known [perfecte\nsciri]. (Med. 5, AT 7:69, CSM 2:48) \n[I]f I were unaware of God … I should thus never have true and\ncertain knowledge [scientiam] about anything, but\nonly shifting and changeable opinions. (Med. 5, AT 7:69, CSM 2:48) \nThus I see plainly that the certainty and truth of all\nknowledge [scientiae] depends uniquely on my awareness of the\ntrue God, to such an extent that I was incapable of perfect knowledge\n[perfecte scire] about anything else until I became\naware of him. (Med. 5, AT 7:71, CSM 2:49) \nThese texts make a powerful case that nothing else can be\nperfectly known prior to establishing that we’re\ncreated by an all-perfect God, rather than an evil genius. These texts\nmake no exceptions. The first text is particularly noteworthy, because\nit comes at the end of a paragraph expressly citing the\ncogito. As Curley writes: \nDescartes looks to hold that hyperbolic doubt is utterly unbounded\n– i.e., that it undermines all manner of propositions,\nincluding thereby the proposition that “I exist.” \nWe can indeed read the opening paragraphs of the Third Meditation as\nintended to clarify not that the cogito is perfectly known,\nbut instead the following two-fold point: First, that what underwrites\nthe cogito’s epistemic impressiveness is\nclarity and distinctness. Second, that even\ncognitions this impressive can be undermined by Evil Genius Doubt, and\nthus lack the full indubitability of perfect knowledge. \nRegarding the first point, the Third Meditation opens with meditator\nattempting to build on the apparent success of the cogito.\nWhat are the internal marks of this impressive perception –\nwhat is it like to have perception that good? The answer: \nThe next two paragraphs help clarify (among other things) what\nDescartes takes to be epistemically impressive about clear and\ndistinct perception, but absent from external sense perception. Of\nexternal sensation, the third paragraph offers this: \nThough we regularly form judgments based on external sensation, they\nare easily undermined by sceptical doubt, as shown by the Now Dreaming\nDoubt. By contrast, our clear and distinct perceptions enjoy a\nperceptual “strength” enabling us to ward off even the\nEvil Genius Doubt (at least, so it might seem). The fourth paragraph\noffers this: \nPrima facie, this excerpt suggests that multiple propositions are\n– at this pre-theistic stage of the broader argument –\nfully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge. But there is\nmore to the paragraph. \nThis brings us to the second point noted above, namely, that even\ncognitions this impressive can be undermined by Evil Genius Doubt\n– an outcome clarified in the final lines of this same\nparagraph: \nIn order to appreciate the subtleties of this pivotal fourth paragraph\nof the Third Meditation, we need to clarify the indirect\nmanner in which Evil Genius Doubt operates on clear and distinct\nperception. \nHow could a doubt undermine the cogito? Part of its\nimpressiveness is that I cannot think about my existence without\naffirming it, yet I cannot doubt my existence without thinking about\nit. In short, I simply cannot doubt the proposition “I\nexist” – or so it appears. \nSeeming to reinforce further the suspicion that the cogito\ncannot be doubted is a more general thesis Descartes holds concerning\nthe doubt-resistance of any matters that are clearly and\ndistinctly perceived: \n[T]he nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them. (Med. 5, AT 7:65,\nCSM 2:45) \n[M]y nature is such that so long as I perceive something very clearly\nand distinctly I cannot but believe it to be true. (Med. 5, AT 7:69,\nCSM 2:48) \nHow, then, is it possible to doubt such matters? According to one\ninterpretation, the answer is that we cannot doubt them\ndirectly, however, we can doubt them in an indirect\nmanner. That is, rather than directing the doubt at particular such\npropositions, as that I exist, or that 2+3=5, the doubt is\ninstead directed at the cognitive faculties by which we\napprehend such propositions. By way of analogy, consider that if a\ncalculator were defective, it would cast doubt on any calculations it\ngenerated. Likewise, if my own mind were in some sense defective, this\nwould cast doubt on any matters I apprehended – no matter how\nevident those matters might seem. By directing the doubt at the\nveracity of my own cognitive faculties, I do thereby\nindirectly doubt the particular propositions apprehended by\nmeans of those faculties. \nA wealth of texts support that this is how the Evil Genius Doubt is\nintended to operate. Consider these (italics are added): \n[Perhaps some God could have given me a nature such that I was\ndeceived even in matters which seemed most evident.\n(Med. 3, AT 7:36, CSM 2:25) \nI can convince myself that I have a natural disposition to go\nwrong from time to time in matters which I think I perceive\nas evidently as can be. (Med. 5, AT 7:70, CSM 2:48) \nI saw nothing to rule out the possibility that my natural\nconstitution made me prone to error even in matters which\nseemed to me most true. (Med. 6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53) \n[T]he most serious doubt [arises] from our ignorance about whether our\nnature might not be such as to make us go wrong even in\nmatters which seemed to us utterly evident. (Prin.\n1:30; AT 8a:16, CSM 1:203) \nAs each passage conveys, the doubt is directed not at the particular\nobject level propositions undermined, but at the possibility of our\nhaving a defective cognitive nature. (In this vein, Carriero helpfully\nrefers to the doubt under the heading, ‘imperfect-nature\ndoubt’ (2009, 27), rather than Evil Genius Doubt.) As each\npassage also conveys, the doubt effectively undermines even the\n“most evident” of matters. Because the doubt is indirect,\nit’s blind to the particular propositions it undercuts. The\nrelevant question does arguably shift from, “How could\na doubt undermine the cogito?”, to “How could\nthis doubt fail to undermine even the cogito?”\nIndeed, the first of the above passages expressly includes the\ncogito with the list of example propositions being indirectly\ncalled into doubt – this, in the pivotal fourth paragraph of the\nThird Meditation: \nThe suggestion is of an epistemic schizophrenia, of sorts, depending\non whether one’s attention is directed at the object level\npropositions, or instead at the possibility of our having defective\ncognitive faculties: \nMoments of epistemic optimism: While I am directly attending\nto a proposition, perceiving it clearly and distinctly, I enjoy an\nirresistible cognitive luminance and my assent is compelled. \nMoments of epistemic pessimism: When no longer directly\nattending – no longer perceiving the proposition clearly and\ndistinctly – I can entertain the sceptical hypothesis that such\nfeelings of cognitive luminance are epistemically worthless, indeed\narising from a defective cognitive nature. \nGranted, this indirect doubt is exceedingly hyperbolic. Even so, it\nentails that we lack the full indubitability requisite to\nperfect knowledge. Descartes thus closes the pivotal fourth paragraph,\nclarifying that because of the Evil Genius Doubt, nothing\n(yet) meets the epistemic standard of perfect knowledge: \nA later Third Meditation passage – but one occurring prior to\nthe arguments for God – can be taken to suggest a very different\ninterpretation. On this alternative account, some of the matters we\nclearly and distinctly perceive are fully indubitable,\nthereby counting as perfect knowledge even prior to knowledge of God.\nThe passage has Descartes drawing a distinction between what is\nrevealed by the natural light, and what is taught by\nnature: \nThe passage makes clear that the cogito is revealed by the\nnatural light. On the interpretation at issue, Descartes’ point\nis that such matters admit of a privileged sort of doubt-resistance,\nwhereby they “cannot in any way be open to doubt.” On this\nunderstanding, the scope of Evil Genius Doubt is bounded, in\nthat not all propositions are vulnerable to the doubt. This is to say\nthat some propositions, including the cogito, may be fully\nindubitable, thus satisfying the requirements of perfect knowledge\n– even for atheists. \nDefenders of an unbounded doubt interpretation would offer a\ndifferent analysis of the passage. First, we saw that Descartes\nearlier claimed that what grounds the extraordinary certainty of the\ncogito is that “there is simply a clear and distinct\nperception.” Yet, that earlier claim is surprising, if the point\nof the above passage is that the natural light is\nepistemically superior to mere garden variety clarity and\ndistinctness. A remark Descartes makes to Hobbes is relevant:\n“As everyone knows, a ‘light in the intellect’ means\ntransparent clarity of cognition.” (Replies 3, AT 7:192, CSM\n2:135) This suggests that “natural light” references are\nsimply another way of talking about clear and distinct perception. On\nthis point, Carriero notes: “I do not see an important\ndistinction for Descartes between something’s being revealed to\nme by the light of nature and my perceiving clearly that thing’s\nbeing the case” (2008, 305). Note further that a bounded doubt\ninterpretation of this passage is at odds with the numerous other\npassages we’ve examined indicating that even the cogito\nis vulnerable to the Evil Genius Doubt. \nHow, then, do unbounded doubt interpreters deal with this passage? In\ncontext, the point of the natural light passage is not to draw a\ndistinction between two grades of clear and distinct perception;\nit’s instead to clarify the distinction between the kind of\nprobabilistic reasoning the meditator had invoked in prior remarks,\nand the irresistible evidentness accompanying our very best\ncognitions, such as the cogito. We can indeed take the point\nof the passage to apply to moments of careful attention: even while\ndirectly attending to the probabilistic matters (taught by nature), we\nrecognize that there are grounds for doubt; whereas, when directly\nattending to our epistemically best cognitions (revealed by the\nnatural light), we simply cannot doubt them. This reading renders the\npassage continuous with our reading of the other passages. Again, in\nthe pivotal fourth paragraph of the Third Meditation: “when I\nturn to the things themselves which I think I perceive very clearly, I\nam so convinced by them that I spontaneously declare: let whoever can\ndo so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so\nlong as I continue to think I am something”; i.e.,\nwhile directly attending to them, the matters revealed by the\nnatural light “cannot in any way be open to doubt.” And\nyet, upon diverting attention, they fall prey to the Evil Genius\nDoubt. \nFurther reading: For important passages in Descartes’\nhandling of the cogito, see the second and third sets of\nObjections and Replies. In the secondary literature, see Beyssade\n(1993), Broughton (2002), Carriero (2009), Cunning (2007), Curley\n(1978), Frankfurt (1966), Hintikka (1962), Kenny (1968), Markie\n(1992), Peacocke (2012), Sarkar (2003), Stroud (2008), Vendler (1984),\nVinci (1998), Williams (1978), and Wilson (1978). \nRecall that Descartes characterizes the cogito as an\nArchimedean point, of sorts, in his constructive efforts at finding\nsomething “certain and unshakeable.” It is clear how the\ncogito serves this role on interpretations rendering it as\nimmune to the Evil Genius Doubt. In what sense is it an Archimedean\npoint on interpretations rendering it vulnerable to doubt? Insofar as\nthe cogito is the first cognition noticed to resist any\nefforts at a direct doubt, it can be said to play an\nArchimedean role. For it exemplifies the kind of cognitions Descartes\nemploys in his constructive efforts, arguing for a solution to the\nsceptical problem. \nDescartes indeed uses the cogito to clarify the epistemically\nprivileged status of clear and distinct perception, even formulating\nclarity and distinctness as underwriting a general rule for\ndiscovering truth. The passage occurs in the second paragraph of the\nThird Meditation: \nI shall refer to this general rule the ‘C&D Rule’.\nThough interpretations differ, the context of the passage indicates\nthe rule is treated as provisional – i.e., further work\nwill be needed before the rule can be regarded as finally established.\nOn two counts, the announcement of the rule is carefully tinged with\ncaution, in anticipation of the revelation to come (two paragraphs\nlater) that even clearly and distinctly perceived matters are\nvulnerable to the Evil Genius Doubt. First, the passage notes that\nbeing clearly and distinctly perceived “would not be enough to\nmake me certain of the truth of the matter,” if the truth of\nsuch matters could be undermined. Second, the announcement includes an\nimportant qualification, in saying that it does “now seem”\n(videor) that this is a justified rule. Because it soon\nemerges that the Evil Genius Doubt undermines the veracity of the\nrule, Descartes assumes the burden of trying to establish the\nrule – a proof he takes to occur not in this early Third\nMeditation passage, but only later, after having argued for an\nall-perfect God: “in the Fourth Meditation it is proved that\neverything that we clearly and distinctly perceive is true”\n(Synopsis, AT 7:15, CSM 2:11).\n (Section 5.3\n discusses Descartes’ Fourth Meditation argument for the C&D\nRule.) \nIf even clear and distinct perception is subject to doubt, how is the\nmeditator to make progress? How can he construct arguments in the\neffort to solve the sceptical problem? This brings into focus the\nissue of whether Descartes’ procedure is viciously\ncircular. For it seems that in the very process of\narguing for a truth rule, Descartes is already employing that\nvery rule. For now, we’ll set side this issue of circularity\n(returning to it in\n Section 6). \nIn his strategy for making constructive arguments, Descartes builds on\nthe fact that clearly and distinctly perceived matters appear to us to\nbe utterly telling, i.e., while our perception is clear and\ndistinct. So, by employing none other than premises and reasoning that\nare clearly and distinctly perceived, we can make rational progress\n– this, notwithstanding that those very same proofs fall\nvulnerable to indirect doubt, once our attention is no longer clear\nand distinct. The following Fifth Meditation passage illustrates the\npoint: \nOf course, Descartes will need some sort of final solution to the\nproblem of ongoing indirect doubt. In the meantime, he has his\nmeditator attempting to move forward, constructing anti-sceptical\narguments. \nThe broader argumentative strategy is revealed at the end of the\npivotal fourth paragraph of the Third Meditation: “in order to\nremove even this slight reason for doubt, as soon as the opportunity\narises I must examine whether there is a God, and, if there is,\nwhether he can be a deceiver.” So, in the effort to establish\nthe C&D Rule, the meditator makes arguments to the conclusion that\nhis creator is not an evil genius, but an all-perfect creator who\nwould not allow him to be deceived about what he clearly and\ndistinctly perceives. \nThe broader argument unfolds in two main steps. The first main step\ninvolves Third Meditation arguments for the existence of of an\nall-perfect God. From these arguments the meditator concludes: \nThere is much of interest in Descartes’ Third Meditation\narguments for an all-perfect creator God. (Note that the Fifth\nMeditation advances a further argument for God.) In the interests of\nspace, and of focusing on epistemological concerns, however, these\narguments will not be considered here. (For an overview of\nDescartes’ proofs, see Nolan (2014) and Nolan and Nelson\n(2006).) \nThe second main step involves an argument from the premise (now\nestablished) that an all-perfect God exists, to the general veracity\nof the C&D Rule – whereby, whatever is clearly and\ndistinctly perceived is guaranteed to be true. It is this second main\nstep of the broader argument to which we now turn. \nIt might seem that a separate argument for the C&D Rule is\nunneeded – that having demonstrated a non-deceiving God, the\nveracity of the rule is a straightforward consequence. But this is too\nfast. Why should only the C&D Rule be a straightforward\nconsequence, but not also a more general infallibility of all\nour judgments? Essentially this point is made in the First Meditation,\nat the introduction of the Evil Genius Doubt. As we saw, the meditator\nthere observes that what seems to follow from the standard view\n– whereby God “is said to be supremely good,” rather\nthan a deceiver – is that God would not allow us ever\nto be mistaken in our judgments: \nIn short, the most straightforward consequence of an all-perfect\ncreator would seem to be the universal rule: If I form a judgment,\nthen it is true. Yet quite clearly, this rule\ndoesn’t hold. What emerges is an instance of the problem of\nevil, here applied to judgment error. As the passage reasons: \nThese First Meditation remarks set the stage for the discussion that\ncomes in the Fourth Meditation. Descartes needs a theodicy for error\n– theodicy being an effort to explain how God is\ncompatible with evil. The theodicy needs to show that the existence of\nan all-perfect God is compatible with some forms of judgment error,\nbut not others; somehow, God allows error in our sensory judgments,\nwhile guaranteeing the inerrancy of judgments based on clear and\ndistinct perception. In contrast with the First Meditation setting,\nthe context of the Fourth Meditation comes on the heels of a\ndemonstration of the existence of an all-perfect God. The argument of\nthe Fourth Meditation thus begins by reviewing the problem where the\nFirst Meditation left it, but in the light of the meditator’s\nnewfound conclusion – “to begin with, I recognize that it\nis impossible that God should ever deceive me.” The passage\ncontinues: \nSeeking to resolve the problem, the meditator investigates the causes\nof error. In the course of the discussion, Descartes puts forward his\ntheory whereby judgment arises from the cooperation of the\nintellect and the will: the role of the intellect is\nto consider a perceptual content – i.e., something seeming to be\nthe case, thereby functioning as a possible judgment; the role of the\nwill is to give assent (or dissent), or withhold assent, to the\nperceptual content under consideration. \nThe investigation concludes that the blameworthy cause of error lies\nin our improper use of our will. Neither the intellect nor the will is\ninherently defective (though each is, of course, finite), nor is there\ninherent defect in the design of how they cooperate – i.e.,\ntheir design does not render error inevitable. The design does make\nfor the possibility of error, in that “the scope of the will is\nwider than that of the intellect”: my will is able to assent to\nmore kinds of matters than just those that I clearly and distinctly\nunderstand; “but instead of restricting it within the same\nlimits, I extend its use to matters which I do not understand”\n(AT 7:58, CSM 2:40). In short, actual mistakes of judgment arise from\nuser error: \nThe theodicy that emerges is a version of the freewill defense.\nAccordingly, we should thank God for giving us freewill, but the cost\nof having freewill is the possibility of misusing it. Since error is\nthe result of misusing our freewill, we should not blame God. \nNot only is the theodicy used to explain the kinds of error God\ncan allow, it serves to clarify the kinds of error God\ncannot allow. From the latter arises a proof of the C&D\nRule. God can allow errors that are my fault, but not errors\nthat would be God’s fault. On occasions when my\nperception is clear and distinct, my assent is involuntary and thus\nnot a result of a misuse of my freewill. In such cases,\nassent is a necessary consequence of my cognitive nature – a\npoint made in many passages, as we’ve seen: “our mind is\nof such a nature that it cannot help assenting to what it clearly\nunderstands” (AT 3:64, CSMK 147). Since, on occasions of clarity\nand distinctness, my assent is the unavoidable consequence of my\nGod-given cognitive nature, God would properly get the blame if those\njudgments resulted in error. Therefore, they are not in error; indeed\nthey could not be. That an evil genius might have created me\ncasts doubt on my clear and distinct judgments. That, instead, an\nall-perfect God created me guarantees that these judgments are true. A\nclever strategy of argument thus unfolds – effectively inverting\nthe usual reasoning in the problem of evil: \nThe first premise is argued in the Third Meditation. The second\npremise arises from the discussion of the Fourth Meditation. The\nresult is a divine guarantee of the C&D Rule. Whatever I perceive\nclearly and distinctly is guaranteed true, because I am the creature\nof an all-perfect God. \nThe broader case to overcome radical doubt is not yet complete. The\nmeditator is now in position to reproduce a demonstration – each\nstep of which he clearly and distinctly perceives – supporting\nthe grand conclusion that he’s the creation of an all-perfect\nGod who would not allow him to be mistaken about whatever he perceives\nclearly and distinctly. However, when he’s no longer clearly and\ndistinctly perceiving the steps of the demonstration, the grand\nconclusion is vulnerable to the lingering Evil Genius Doubt. It seems\nthat perfect knowledge is not yet within his grasp. Moreover, the\ndemonstration itself looks suspiciously circular – the so-called\nCartesian Circle (a problem to which we now turn). \nFurther reading: On discussions of truth criteria in\nthe 16th and 17th centuries, see Popkin (1979). On the dubitability of\nclear and distinct perception (including the cogito), see\nCarriero (2009, 339ff), Newman and Nelson (1999). \nStudents of philosophy can expect to be taught a longstanding\ninterpretation according to which Descartes’ broader argument is\nviciously circular. He first argues from clearly and distinctly\nperceived premises to the conclusion that an all-perfect God exists;\nhe then argues from the premise that an all-perfect God exists to the\nconclusion that whatever is clearly and distinctly perceived is true.\nThe worry is that he presupposes the C&D Rule in the effort to\nprove the C&D Rule. Despite its prima facie plausibility,\nDescartes scholarship generally resists the vicious circularity\ninterpretation, based on numerous textual considerations. But even\nputting those texts to the side, it should be surprising that the\nproject would be viciously circular. As Thomas Lennon notes: \nConsider first what every plausible interpretation must concede: that\nthe two main steps of the broader argument unfold in a manner\nsuggestive of a circle – let us indeed refer to them as\n‘arcs’. The Third Meditation arguments for God define one\narc: \nThe Fourth Meditation argument defines a second arc: \nThat the broader argument unfolds in accord with these two steps is\nuncontroversial. The question of interest concerns whether, strictly\nspeaking, these arcs form an epistemic circle. The statement\nof Arc 1 admits of considerable ambiguity. How one resolves this\nambiguity determines whether the arcs strictly form a circle.\nLet’s begin by clarifying what Arc 1 would have to mean to\ngenerate vicious circularity. We’ll then consider the main\nalternative interpretations of that arc by which commentators avoid a\nvicious circle. \nVicious Circularity interpretation: \nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n– i.e., premises that are accepted only because of having\nfirst accepted the general veracity of propositions that are clearly\nand distinctly perceived. \nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists. \nThus rendered, Descartes’ broader argument is viciously\ncircular. The italicized segment of Arc 1 marks an addition to the\noriginal statement of it, thereby clarifying the circularity reading.\nInterpreted in this way, Descartes begins his Third Meditation proofs\nof God by presupposing the general veracity of clear and distinct\nperception. That is, he starts by assuming the C&D Rule and then\nuses the rule in the course of demonstrating it. Evidently, this way\nof reading Descartes’ argument has pedagogical appeal, for it is\nwidely taught (outside of Descartes scholarship) despite the absence\nof serious textual merit. If there is one point of general agreement\nin the secondary literature, it is that the texts do not sustain this\ninterpretation. \nHow then should Arc 1 be understood? There are countless\ninterpretations that avoid vicious circularity, along with numerous\nschemes for cataloguing them. For present purposes, let’s\ncatalogue the various accounts according to two main kinds of\nnon-circular strategies that commentators attribute to Descartes. (The\nsecondary literature offers multiple variations of each of these main\nkinds of interpretations, though the variations won’t here be\nexplored.) \nBounded Doubt interpretations: \nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n– indeed, premises belonging to a special class of truths\nthat are fully immune to doubt prior to establishing the general\nveracity of propositions that are clearly and distinctly\nperceived. \nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists. \nAgain, the italicized segment marks an addition to the original\nstatement of Arc 1. Call this a ‘Bounded Doubt’\ninterpretation, because this kind of interpretation construes\nhyperbolic doubt as bounded. More precisely, the Evil Genius\nDoubt is (on this reading) bounded in the sense that its sceptical\npotency does not extend to all judgments: a special class of truths is\noutside the bounds of doubt. Exemplary of this special class are the\ncogito and, importantly, the premises of the Third Meditation\nproofs of God. Propositions in this special class can be perfectly\nknown, even by atheists. \nOn this interpretation, there is no vicious circularity in the broader\nargument, because the truths serving as premises in the arguments for\nthe C&D Rule are perfectly knowable independently of that rule.\nThat is, throughout the arguments of Arcs 1 and 2, the premises\nemployed count as perfectly knowledge prior to the knowledge\nof the C&D Rule they help establish. \nProponents of this interpretation are apt to cite Third Meditation\npassage distinguishing what’s revealed by the natural\nlight, and what’s taught by nature (see\n Section 4.3).\n In order to extend perfect knowledge beyond the privileged class of\ntruths (revealed by the natural light), it is necessary to establish\nthe general veracity of the C&D Rule. Thus, the need (on this\ninterpretation) for Arc 2 in the broader project. \nThe other main kind of interpretation avoids circularity in a\ndifferent manner. Let’s consider that alternative. \nUnbounded Doubt interpretations: \nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n– i.e., premises that are accepted despite being vulnerable\nto Evil Genius Doubt, because our cognitive nature compels us to\nassent to clearly and distinctly perceived propositions. \nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists. \nAgain, the italicized segment marks an addition to the original\nstatement of Arc 1. Let’s call this an ‘Unbounded\nDoubt’ interpretation, because this kind of interpretation\nconstrues hyperbolic doubt as unbounded. More precisely, the\nEvil Genius Doubt is (on this reading) unbounded in the sense that it\nundermines all manner of judgments – even the\ncogito, even the premises of the Third Meditation proofs of\nGod – when the mind is no longer attending to them clearly and\ndistinctly. Insofar as the meditator assents to the steps of these\nproofs, he does so not because of having an understanding of clear and\ndistinct perceptions as being guaranteed true, but because the mind\ncannot but assent to them while attending clearly\nand distinctly. \nImportantly, if doubt is thus unbounded there is no circularity. For,\non this reading of Arc 1, the arguments therein do not presuppose the\ngeneral veracity of the C&D Rule. The premises contributing to the\nconclusion of an all-perfect God remain vulnerable to hyperbolic\ndoubt. Throughout this stage of the inquiry, none of the\nmeditator’s judgments based in clear and distinct perception\nconstitutes perfect knowledge. It is the unboundedness of hyperbolic\ndoubt that underwrites the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis. \nA central feature of this interpretation is worth repeating. It is\nnatural for critics to ask why the arguments of Arc 1 are\naccepted by the meditator if, indeed, Evil Genius Doubt\nremains in play. The answer lies in our earlier discussion of the\nindirect manner in which the doubt undermines clear and\ndistinct perception\n (Section 4.3).\n While clearly and distinctly attending to a proposition, the\nmind cannot but assent: “my nature is such that so long as I\nperceive something very clearly and distinctly I cannot but believe it\nto be true.” Therefore, while the meditator attends to the steps\nof the Third Meditation arguments for God, he cannot but accept them.\nHowever, the meditator does not (yet) have perfect knowledge of those\npremises, nor of their conclusions. How, then do those matters finally\nrise to the status of perfect knowledge? We return to this issue,\nbelow. At present, the focus is on the issue of circularity. \nThough bounded and unbounded doubt interpretations both avoid vicious\ncircularity, each confronts further difficulties, both textual and\nphilosophical. Avoiding the charge of vicious circularity marks the\nbeginning of the interpreter’s work, not the end. Bounded doubt\ninterpreters must explain why, in the first place, the Evil\nGenius Doubt’s potency does not extend to propositions in the\nspecial class. Unbounded doubt interpreters must explain why, in the\nfinal analysis, the Evil Genius Doubt eventually loses it\nundermining potency. Let’s consider each of these further\nproblems. \nGranting a bounded doubt interpretation, why – in the first\nplace – does the Evil Genius Doubt’s potency not extend to\npropositions in the special class? How is it that the doubt\ndoes undermine the proposition “that two and three\nadded together make five,” but not the proposition\n“that there must be at least as much [reality] in the efficient\nand total cause as in the effect of that cause”? The first\nproposition is included in the list of examples that are\nundermined by the Evil Genius Doubt (see the fourth paragraph of the\nThird Meditation). The second proposition is a premise in a Third\nMeditation argument for God – a proposition immune to doubt,\naccording to bounded doubt interpretations. What is supposed to be the\nrelevant difference between these propositions? Given the indirect\nmanner in which Evil Genius Doubt operates, there seems no clear\nexplanation of why the doubt succeeds in undermining the first\nproposition but is somehow resisted by the second. Further awkward for\nthis interpretation is that the cogito is included in the\nlist of examples that that same fourth paragraph passage implies is\nvulnerable to doubt. \nGranting an unbounded doubt interpretation, why – in the final\nanalysis – does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose its\nundermining potency? Putting the point ironically: Why doesn’t\nthe Evil Genius Doubt undermine the very arguments intended to refute\nthe Evil Genius Doubt, as soon as the mind is no longer attending to\nthose premises? Consider Descartes’ own explanation of how\nhyperbolic doubt undermines the conclusions of arguments once their\npremises are no longer in the mind’s view: \nSo, when we’re no longer clearly and distinctly perceiving the\nsteps of an argument, we do not “possess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction” of its conclusion. But precisely such\nmoments are when hyperbolic doubt does its undermining work. This\nmeans that upon diverting attention from the premises of Arcs 1 and 2,\nit is then possible to run the Evil Genius Doubt on their conclusions.\nIt would thus seem that unbounded doubt interpretations leave us in a\nSisyphus-like predicament. According to the myth, each time Sisyphus\npushes his boulder near to the top of the hill, the boulder somehow\nslips away, rolling to the very bottom, and the whole process must\nstart all over. By carefully constructing the arguments of Arcs 1 and\n2, the meditator gains anti-sceptical momentum, pushing his project\nnear to the goal of perfect knowledge. But each time, once his\nattention is diverted from the steps of the arguments, he finds\nhimself back at the bottom of the hill, wondering about the\ncredibility of those proofs that had seemed so evident: that is, the\nquestion now arises “as to whether we possess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction concerning these conclusions, when we simply\nrecollect that they were previously deduced from quite evident\nprinciples.” As Michael Ayers writes: \nLet’s turn to an account that purports to solve this problem\nwith unbounded doubt interpretations. \nAgain, the hard question for unbounded doubt interpretations: Why, in\nthe final analysis, does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose it\nundermining potency? One recent unbounded doubt interpretation (Newman\nand Nelson 1999) offers a solution, including an explanation of why\nDescartes waits until the end of the Fifth Meditation to claim final\nvictory over the sceptical problem. Here is a sketch of the\naccount. \nDescartes claims that his final solution to the sceptical problem\nmakes it “impossible for us ever to have any reason for doubting\nwhat we are convinced of.” We’ve seen that the sticking\npoint in the account is indirect doubt. Descartes rejects\nthat we could overcome the problem via uninterrupted clear and\ndistinct perception: “my nature is also such that I cannot fix\nmy mental vision continually on the same thing, so as to keep\nperceiving it clearly; and often the memory of a previously made\njudgement may come back, when I am no longer attending to the\narguments which led me to make it.” At such moments of\ninattention, an indirect doubt remains possible, so long as we can\nmake sense of the evil genius scenario, or any other scenario wherein\nwe have a defective cognitive nature. It thus seems that a final\nsolution to the problem would need, somehow, to make it no longer\npossible to make sense of the relevant sceptical scenarios. Indeed,\nthe interpretation has it the sceptical scenarios become\nself-evidently incoherent. We come to have an utterly basic\napprehension that we’re the creation of an all-perfect creator\nwho would not allow us to be deceived about what we clearly and\ndistinctly perceive. \nThe needed apprehension of God would need to be self-evident. For\nsuppose my apprehension is grounded in a demonstration. In that case,\nit’s possible to think of the conclusion of that demonstration\nwithout also thinking of the premises; and on such occasions, my\nconfidence in the demonstration is vulnerable to an indirect doubt.\nThus, the needed apprehension of God is a self-evident, clear and\ndistinct conception that renders – as literally unthinkable\n– the very sceptical scenarios that underwrite indirect\ndoubt. \nA useful analogy lies in the doubt-resisting character of the\ncogito. If I attempt a direct doubt of own my\nexistence, the effort is self-stultifying; I immediately apprehend\nthat I must exist, in order to attempt the doubt. What Descartes needs\nis a similarly strong and immediate doubt-resisting outcome in\nconnection with attempts at an indirect doubt. That is, on\noccasions of trying to undermine clearly and distinctly perceived\nmatters – e.g., by doubting God’s existence, or\nbenevolence, or the like – the very effort at doubt would be\nimmediately thwarted. \nMultiple texts suggest that this is the account Descartes intends, and\nthat the Fifth Meditation is the locus of the meditator’s\ndiscovery of an enhanced, apprehension of God. The Fifth Meditation\nintroduces various themes about innate truths, including the positive\nepistemic effects of repeated meditation: truths initially noticed\nonly by means of inference might eventually come to be apprehended\nself-evidently. In the build-up to the passage claiming that the Evil\nGenius Doubt is finally and fully overcome, Descartes writes: \nDescartes reiterates the theme in the Second Replies: \nThese passages convey that one’s apprehension of God eventually\nupgrades from being inferential, to being transparently self-evident.\nGranting that the meditator has achieved an apprehension of God of\nthis kind, it plausibly explains why Descartes would think he’s\nachieved a final solution to the sceptical problem. Given his newfound\nepistemic standing, the meditator would be unable to make coherent\nsense of the Evil Genius Doubt. His clear and distinct perceptions\nwould be fully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge. \nThe interpretation helps explain two passages wherein Descartes\npurports to be detailing the final solution to the sceptical problem.\nIn both passages, he can seem simply to be asserting that\nsceptical doubts are impossible, as if having forgotten the\nindirect manner in which his own hyperbolic doubt operates.\nBut if we take Descartes to be assuming that the apprehension of God\nhas become utterly self-evident, both passages make more sense. The\none passage arises in the Second Replies, in the context of rebutting\nan objection to the effect that, in the final analysis, it remains\npossible to doubt clear and distinct perception. Descartes replies\nthat the objector is “still stuck fast” in doubts\n“put forward in the First Meditation,” but “very\ncarefully removed in the succeeding Meditations,” adding: \nThe other passage arises in the Fifth Meditation, in the concluding\nsummary explanation of how the sceptical problem is finally overcome.\nImportantly, on the present interpretation, is the context in which\nthe summary explanation occurs: namely, on the heels of revealing the\nnewly discovered thesis, that nothing “is more self-evident than\nthe fact that the supreme being exists.” In that context,\nDescartes explains that a final solution to the sceptical problem has\nbeen achieved. \nAbsent a self-evident apprehension of God, the two passages appear\ninexplicable, with Descartes seeming to misunderstand the sceptical\nimplications of his own Evil Genius Doubt. But on the self-evident God\ninterpretation, both passages read as a summary of the anti-sceptical\neffects of it being impossible to conceive of God as a deceiver. As\nDescartes writes to Voetius, the very thought of God as a deceiver\n“implies a conceptual contradiction – that is, it cannot\nbe conceived” (May 1643 letter, AT 8b:60, CSMK 222). The\ninterpretation also makes sense of why the final victory over\nscepticism is announced not at the end of the Fourth Meditation, but at\nthe end the Fifth – after the further result concerning an\nenhanced, self-evident apprehension of God. \nMichael Della Rocca has recently argued that a further circle arises\nfrom considerations in the Fourth Meditation – a problem he\nsuspects is “more difficult to get out of than the traditional\nproblem of circularity” (2011, 98). To help clarify this further\ncircle, Della Rocca focuses on a twofold question: \nAs Della Rocca understands the broader Fourth Meditation argument, the\nclaim that we should assent only to what we clearly and distinctly\nperceive is an essential step in the ongoing argument to establish the\ndivine guarantee of clear and distinct perception. Since this step\npresupposes the eventual conclusion, that conclusion is based on\ncircular reasoning: \nPerhaps we can avoid this alleged circle. The linchpin of Della\nRocca’s charge of circularity is his contention that\n“Descartes’s reason for saying that we should assent only\nto clear and distinct ideas is that such ideas are guaranteed to be\ntrue and ideas that are not clear and distinct are not guaranteed to\nbe true” (2011, 97). Though Descartes can be read in this way,\nthe texts support the following alternative understanding of the\nbroader argumentative narrative. In the First Meditation, the\nmeditator initially resolves that he should withhold assent to\nanything which is “not completely certain and indubitable”\n(AT 7:18, CSM 2:12). Early in the Third Meditation, having reflected\non the epistemic impressiveness of the cogito, the meditator\ndiscovers that all, but only, clear and distinct\nperceptions are utterly assent-compelling. As a practical consequence,\nhis initial resolve effectively implies that he should assent only to\nclear and distinct perceptions – not because of presupposing the\nconclusion of the eventual proof of the C&D Rule, but because\nthese are the only perceptions to which he can’t but\nassent. This provides a practical answer to Della Rocca’s\nquestion, concerning why we should “not assent to ideas that are\nnot clear and distinct and why is there no such obligation not to\nassent to clear and distinct ideas.” It is in the Fourth\nMeditation that the meditator purports to demonstrate the divine\nguarantee of the C&D Rule. However, no step of that demonstration\npresupposes that clear and distinct perceptions have already been\nestablished as true; i.e., the conclusion of the demonstration is not,\nas Della Rocca contends, “based on the claim that clear and\ndistinct ideas are guaranteed to be true.” Rather (as we saw in\n Section 5.3),\n the conclusion purports to be based on an analysis of the respective\ncontributions of the intellect and the will, to judgment formation.\nSummarizing the key steps: \nGranted, the meditator needs each of the demonstrative steps to be\nclearly and distinctly perceived. However, he needs this not because\nof presupposing the conclusion to be proved, but in order to be in\ncompliance with his own initial resolve, stated in the First\nMeditation. \nCentral to the above account avoiding Della Rocca’s circle is\n(among other claims) the thesis that clear and distinct perceptions\nare assent-compelling – i.e., as Descartes writes, that\n“the nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them.” It it thus\nworth noting that Della Rocca wavers on whether Descartes holds this\nthesis: he interprets a remark in Descartes’ correspondence (9\nFeb 1645, AT 4:173, CSMK 245) to suggest “that we can withhold\nassent from even a current clear and distinct perception” (2006,\n155). \nWe noted in\n Section 1.1\n that Descartes’ clearest statements appear to indicate a\njustified belief analysis of perfect knowledge. Consider\nagain the relevant Second Replies passage: \nThe last part of the passage emphasizes two conditions: a belief\ncondition, expressed in terms of conviction, and a\njustification condition, expressed in terms of indubitability\nor unshakability – “conviction based on a reason so strong\nthat it can never be shaken by any stronger reason.”\nConspicuously missing is any further condition stipulating that the\nconviction must be true. The passage does clarify, of\nanything that would count as perfect knowledge, that it is\n“completely accepted as true”; that we are\n“convinced that it is true,” indeed, that we are\n“firmly convinced.” But these remarks speak to the belief\ncondition, not the justification condition. Indeed, the passage is\nplausibly read even more strongly: i.e., not merely as omitting\nmention of a truth condition, but as confirming some broad possibility\nthat what we regard as indubitable truths are,\n“absolutely speaking, false.” \nWhy, then, is Descartes dismissive of the stated objection, indicating\nthat it shouldn’t “bother” us? His remarks indicate\nthat he takes the possibility in question as simply a further\niteration of Evil Genius Doubt – “I see that you are still\nstuck fast in the doubts which I put forward in the First\nMeditation.” Whether a deceiving God is really\npossible, it’s something Descartes has argued to be unimaginable\nfor perfect knowers, i.e., for successful graduates of the\nMeditations – “it is impossible to imagine that\nhe [God] is a deceiver.” On a plausible reading, therefore,\nDescartes is dismissive of the objection not on metaphysical grounds\nof absolute impossibility, but on epistemic grounds of\nindubitability: the “alleged ‘absolute\nfalsity’,” noted in the objection, should in no way\n“bother us” because our conviction is “so firm that\nit is quite incapable of being destroyed.” \nWhy does Descartes not add a truth condition, thereby ensuring that\nbeliefs counting as perfect knowledge are true? In an influential 1970\nbook, Harry Frankfurt offers a provocative answer. He argues that\nDescartes’ goal, truth-wise, is to establish the consistency of\nour beliefs, but not their correspondence with an external reality.\nWrites Frankfurt: \nFrankfurt thinks that Descartes’ novel plan involves arguing\nthat our best rational efforts show that our best rational efforts are\nlogically consistent: it is “an attempt to show that there are\nno good reasons for believing that reason is unreliable – that\nthe mistrust of reason is not supported by reason and that it is\naccordingly irrational” (1970, 175). Frankfurt adds that\n“the conception of truth involved in [Descartes’] question\nabout the truth of what is clearly and distinctly perceived is, in\nother words, a conception of coherence rather than of\ncorrespondence” (1970, 170). \nFrankfurt’s coherentist interpretation is at odds with a number\nof textual and doctrinal considerations. Descartes writes to Mersenne\nthat “the word ‘truth’, in the strict sense, denotes\nthe conformity of thought with its object” (16 Oct 1639, AT\n2:597, CSMK 139). The suggestion here is of some version of a\ncorrespondence theory. Also, on the most straightforward reading of\nthe epistemic moves in the Meditations, Descartes is\npresupposing that at least some truths involve extramental\nmetaphysical relations. Consider that Evil Genius Doubt is,\nfundamentally, a worry not about whether our various clear and\ndistinct judgments cohere, but about whether they accurately\nrepresent an extramental reality – i.e., a doubt about\n“whether things do in reality correspond to our perception of\nthem” (Replies 4, AT 7:226, CSM 2:159). Interestingly, Frankfurt\nhimself came to renounce the interpretation: \nHow then should we interpret the Second Replies passage, and how\nshould we understand the absence of a truth condition? I suggest that\nthe lack of a truth condition need not reflect an indifference about\ntruth, as opposed to a view about how a concern for truth is properly\nexpressed in an account of knowledge. We can understand Descartes as\nwanting a fully internalist account whereby all\nconditions of knowledge are accessible to the would-be knower. Putting\nthe point another way, if the question of whether the\nconditions of knowledge had been met were answerable only by\n“God or an angel,” it would impose an unacceptably\nexternalist element on the theory. On a justified\nbelief rendering, his account of perfect knowledge is\nfully internalist; yet, with the addition of a truth condition, it is\nnot – at least, not given a correspondence theory of\ntruth, in the context of metaphysical realism. Importantly, then, in\nattributing to Descartes a justified belief account, we need not\nthereby attribute to him an indifference concerning truth.\nRather, we can attribute to him the view that the way properly to\nexpress one’s concern for truth is by enforcing high\njustificatory standards. Again, from that same passage: \nOne possible objection to a justified belief account is expressed by\nLennon, who worries that on such accounts the desired cognitive state\n(indubitability) “could as well be achieved by a pill”;\nadding that “Descartes would not be satisfied with such a pill\nbecause his aim is not just to arrive at certainty, but truth, which\nhe cannot help but think he has achieved” (2008, 167). (Cf.\nHatfield 2006, 135, who expresses a related objection.) \nGranted, if the pill simply prevented me from apprehending any reasons\nfor doubting my beliefs, we’d be loath to regard such beliefs as\nknowledge. Descartes himself makes a related point in connection with\nan atheist geometer who happens never to doubt his beliefs, simply\nbecause the Evil Genius Doubt never occurs to him: \nPresumably, Descartes’ point holds whether the doubt simply\nnever occurs to him, or is instead prevented from occurring to him by\na pill. But note that the objection is telling only insofar as the\nrequisite indubitability is understood as merely\npsychological. Yet clear texts indicate that Descartes regards\nclear and distinct perception as having epistemic import beyond mere\ndoubt-resistance. His use of light metaphors, including the\nassociation of clarity and distinctness with the natural\nlight, strongly convey a form of rational insight. In\nhis view, our inability to doubt the matters we clearly and distinctly\nperceive is not simply a causal result of our cognitive nature;\nit’s also a rational result of what such perception enables us\nto understand. \nConsider a revised version of Lennon’s worry. Imagine that the\nmagic pill is so magical as to instill in us a clear and distinct\nunderstanding of the matters we perceive – i.e., assume the pill\nfunctions as an alternative cognitive route to clear and distinct\nperception. In that case, the desired cognitive state is\nindeed “achieved by a pill.” Yet, it seems Descartes can\nhappily accept the result. \nAnother possible objection is that Descartes’ high justificatory\nstandards generate a de facto truth condition: because having\nCartesian certainty entails that one’s beliefs are\ntrue, truth is a necessary condition of knowledge. But this objection\nmisses a key point. As suggested in the Second Replies passage,\nCartesian certainty – understood in terms of\nindubitability – does not, strictly speaking, rule out\nthe broad possibility that we are in error. The notions of\nindubitability and truth are different: that\n“p is indubitable” entails not that\n“p is true,” but that “there can be no\nreasons for doubting p.” Descartes’ final\nsolution to the Evil Genius Doubt entails not that an evil genius\ncannot be, but that it cannot be coherently\nconceived. And that it cannot be coherently conceived, thinks\nDescartes, gives us “everything that we could reasonably\nwant” – not because such coherence is the goal, but\nbecause of what it establishes, truth-wise. \nFurther reading: For Descartes’ response to the charges\nof circularity: see the Fourth Replies.

At this juncture, the meditator\nperfectly knows of his own existence and of God’s. It follows\nthat there’s an external world with at least one object, namely,\nGod. However, the existence of an external material world\nremains in doubt. Establishing the existence of material bodies is not\na straightforward matter of perceiving them, because, in\nDescartes’ view, “bodies are not strictly perceived by the\nsenses” (see\n Section 9.1). \nIn his eventual argument, Descartes’ strategy for proving an\nexternal material world has two main parts: first, he argues for the\nexternality of the causes of sensation; second, he argues for\nthe materiality of these external causes. (Calling the ideas\nin question “sensations” can seem circular, if one\nconceives of sensations as having a physiological component. But note\nthat for Descartes, “what is called ‘having a sensory\nperception’,” strictly encompasses only a mental aspect.\nMed. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19) From these two steps, it follows that there\nexists an external material world. Let’s consider each phase of\nthe argument. \nDescartes builds on a familiar line of argument in the history of\nphilosophy, itself appealing to the involuntariness of sensations. The\nfamiliar argument is first articulated in the Third Meditation.\nSpeaking of his apparently adventitious ideas (sensations), the\nmeditator remarks: \nThough some such involuntariness argument has convinced many\nphilosophers, the inference does not hold up to methodical doubt, as\nthe meditator explains: \nWe first examined this passage in regards to the Always Dreaming\nDoubt. That doubt raises the problem of the existence of external\nthings. For all I know, my “waking” experiences are\nproduced not by external things, but by processes similar to those\nproducing my dreams. This sceptical hypothesis explains why the\nfamiliar involuntariness argument fails: the inference presupposes\nexactly what is at issue – namely, whether involuntarily\nreceived sensory ideas are produced by external things, rather than by\na subconscious faculty of my mind. \nMany philosophers have assumed that we lack the epistemic resources to\nsolve this sceptical problem. For example, Hume writes: \nInterestingly, Descartes would agree that experiential\nresources cannot solve the problem. By the Sixth Meditation, however,\nDescartes purports to have the innate resources he needs to\nsolve it – notably, innate ideas of mind and body. Among the\nmetaphysical theses he develops is that mind and body have wholly\ndistinct essences: the essence of thinking substance is pure thought;\nthe essence of body is pure extension. In a remarkable maneuver,\nDescartes invokes this distinction to refute the sceptical worry that\nsensations are produced by a subconscious faculty of the mind:\n“nothing can be in me, that is to say, in my mind, of which I am\nnot aware,” and this “follows from the fact that the soul\nis distinct from the body and that its essence is to think” (13\nDec 1640 letter to Mersenne, AT 3:273, CSMK 165f). This result allows\nDescartes to supplement the involuntariness argument, thereby\nstrengthening the inference. For from the additional premise that\nnothing can be in my mind of which I am unaware, it follows\nthat if sensations were being produced by some activity in my mind,\nI’d be aware of that activity on the occasion of its operation.\nSince I’m not thus aware, it follows that the sensation\nI’m having is produced by a cause external to my mind. As\nDescartes writes, this cause \nIt follows that my sensations are caused by external world objects\n– i.e., objects external to my mind. It remains to be shown that\nthese external causes are material objects. \nOn Descartes’ analysis, there are three possible options for the\nkind of external thing causing sensations: \nThat is, the cause is either infinite substance (God), or finite\nsubstance; and if finite, then either corporeal, or something else.\nDescartes thinks he eliminates options (a) and (c) by appeal to God\nbeing no deceiver: \nThis is a problematic passage. The “great propensity” here\ncited is not the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct\nperception. (If it were, the conclusion that sensation is caused by\nmaterial objects would follow straightaway from this clear and\ndistinct perception, via the C&D Rule.) But unless each step of\nthe argument is clearly and distinctly perceived, Descartes should not\nbe making the argument. Adding to the difficulties of the passage, he\nexpressly cites the conclusion as following from the fact that\n“God is not a deceiver,” implying that he thinks this\ninference is supported by a divine guarantee. \nOn one kind of interpretation, Descartes relaxes his epistemic\nstandards in the Sixth Meditation (cf. Schmitt 1986, 493f). He no\nlonger insists on perfect knowledge, now settling for probabilistic\narguments. Though no decisive texts support the interpretation, it\ndoes find some support. For instance, in the Synopsis to the\nMeditations, Descartes writes of his Sixth Meditation\narguments: \nThe remark can be read as a concession that the Sixth Meditation\narguments are weaker than the earlier arguments about minds and God\n– that these later arguments do not “prove what they\nestablish.” Of course, one need not read the remark this way.\nAnd other texts are unfavorable to this interpretation. For example,\nin the opening paragraphs of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes considers\na probabilistic argument for the existence of external bodies. Though\nhe accepts the proposed account as offering the best explanation, he\nnonetheless dismisses it for the express reason that it grounds\n“only a probability” – it does not provide the\n“basis for a necessary inference that some body exists”\n(AT 7:73, CSM 2:51). This is a puzzling dismissal, assuming Descartes\nhas relaxed his standards to probable inference. \nThe relaxed standards interpretation falls short for another reason.\nIt leaves unexplained why Descartes cites a divine guarantee for the\nconclusion that sensations are caused by material objects. \nOn another kind of interpretation, the troubling passage appealing to\na “great propensity” does not mark a relaxing of epistemic\nstandards. Instead, Descartes is extending the implications of his\ndiscussion of theodicy in the Fourth Meditation to encompass further\ncases of natural belief – such beliefs deriving from our\nGod-given cognitive nature. It was noted above\n (Section 5.2)\n that Descartes thinks the divine guarantee of the C&D Rule\nfollows, in part, from the fact that God wouldn’t allow us to be\nmistaken if the assent is a natural consequence of our God-given\ncognitive nature. Suppose Descartes holds that there are further cases\nin which an all-perfect God would not allow us to be in error, in part\nbecause the beliefs in question arise naturally from our God-given\ncognitive nature. And suppose the further cases involve a\nnatural propensity to believe which cannot be\ncorrected by our cognitive faculties. Given these assumptions,\nthe resulting rule for truth would look something like the\nfollowing: \nThis rule is more expansive than the C&D Rule, in that it\nlicenses more kinds of judgments. Clauses (i) and (ii) are tailored to\nthe problematic passage wherein, as we’ve seen, Descartes\ninvokes two conditions: “God has given me no faculty at all\nfor recognizing any such source for these ideas; on the contrary,\nhe has given me a great propensity to believe that they are\nproduced by corporeal things.” If this is on the right\ninterpretive track, then Descartes needs some way to justify this\nrule. Assuming a proof similar in structure to the proof of the\nC&D Rule, the justification might run as follows: \nIf Descartes affirms premise 2, it explains why he thinks he’s\nentitled to this more expansive rule, and without relaxing his\nepistemic standards. Indeed, a number of texts indicate that he holds\nsome version of premise 2. In the relevant Sixth Meditation passage,\nDescartes adds that from “the very fact that God is not a\ndeceiver” there is a “consequent impossibility of there\nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some\nother faculty supplied by God” (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). In another\npassage he writes that we would be “doing God an\ninjustice” if we implied “that God had endowed us with\nsuch an imperfect nature that even the proper use of our powers of\nreasoning allowed us to go wrong” (Prin. 3:43, AT\n8a:99, CSM 1:255). And in the Second Replies, Descartes addresses case\nof judgments that “could not be corrected by any clearer\njudgements or by means of any other natural faculty,” adding\nthat “in such cases I simply assert that it is impossible for us\nto be deceived” (Replies 2, AT 7:143f, CSM 2:102f). These\npassages make a strong case that something like premise 2 is in play,\nindeed implying that God’s benevolent nature entails a more\nexpansive rule of truth than the C&D Rule. As will emerge,\nDescartes looks again to call on this more expansive rule in\nhis effort to prove that he is not dreaming. \nEarlier, we noted another apparent problem in the Sixth Meditation\npassage wherein Descartes concludes that the external cause of\nsensation is something corporeal. One of his premises cites a\ngreat propensity to believe, yet the propensity is not itself\nthe irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct perception. Does not\nthe methodic procedure of the Meditations restrict Descartes\nto clear and distinct premises? By way of reply, distinguish (a) that\nmy sensation has an external cause, and (b) that I have a great\npropensity to believe my sensation has an external cause. In\ncontext, the meditator lacks clear and distinct perception of (a).\nHowever, the relevant premise of the argument (as opposed to its\nconclusion) is not (a), but (b). And there is no principled reason\nthat the meditator cannot clearly and distinctly perceive this\npremise. \nA final observation. It is often unnoticed that the conclusion of\nDescartes’ argument for the existence of an external material\nworld leaves significant scepticism in place. Granting the success of\nthe argument, my sensations are caused by an external material world.\nBut for all the argument shows – for all the broader argument of\nthe Meditations shows, up to this point – my mind might\nbe joined to a brain in a vat, rather than a full human body.\nThis isn’t an oversight on Descartes’ part. It’s all\nhe thinks the argument can prove. For even at this late stage\nof the project, the meditator has not yet established himself to be\nawake – a line of inquiry to which we now turn. \nFurther reading: For a variation of the Sixth Meditation\nargument for the existence of the external material world, see\nDescartes’ Prin. 2.1. See also Friedman (1997), Garber\n(1992), and Newman (1994). On the respects in which the Sixth\nMeditation inference draws on Fourth Meditation work, see Newman\n(1999). For an interpretation of the Sixth Meditation argument\nthat’s consistent with a direct realist interpretation, see\nCarriero (2009, 146ff). \nBy design, the constructive arguments of the Meditations\nunfold even though the meditator remains in doubt about being awake.\nThis of course reinforces the ongoing theme that perfect knowledge\ndoes not properly encompass judgments of external sense. (The judgment\nthat an external corporeal world exists is not strictly a judgment of\nexternal sense – as if knowing its existence simply by sensing\nit. Rather, as we’ve seen, the judgment arises from an complex\ninference about the possible causes of sensations.) In the closing\nparagraph of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes revisits the issue of\ndreaming. He claims to show how, in principle – even if not\neasily in practice – it is possible to achieve perfect knowledge\nthat one is presently awake. \nA casual reading of that final paragraph might suggest that Descartes\noffers a naturalistic solution to the problem (i.e., a\nnon-theistic solution), in the form of a continuity test: since\ncontinuity with past experiences holds only of waking but not\ndreaming, checking for the requisite continuity provides a test for\nascertaining that one is awake. The following remarks can be read in\nthis way: \nThis naturalistic “solution” prompts two obvious\ncriticisms, both raised by Hobbes in the Third Objections. First, the\nsolution runs contrary to Descartes’ No Atheistic Perfect\nKnowledge Thesis: since the continuity test (on the naturalistic\nreading of it) does not invoke God, it thus appears, as Hobbes notes,\n“that someone can know he is awake without knowledge of\nthe true God” (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Second, it seems that one\ncould dream the requisite continuity: one could “dream\nthat his dream fits in with his ideas of a long series of past\nevents,” thus undermining the credibility of the continuity test\n(AT 7:195, CSM 2:137). \nMirroring our discussion in\n Section 7.2,\n one kind of interpretation has Descartes relaxing his epistemic\nstandards. He’s aware that the naturalistic solution does not\nstand up to methodic doubt, but he’s not attempting to overcome\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt with perfect knowledge. A problem for this\ninterpretation is that it doesn’t square with the following\nreply Descartes makes to Hobbes’ first objection: “an\natheist can infer that he is awake on the basis of memory of his past\nlife” (via the continuity test); but “he cannot know that\nthis criterion is sufficient to give him the certainty that he is not\nmistaken, if he does not know that he was created by a non-deceiving\nGod” (Replies 3, AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Evidently,\nDescartes’ solution is not supposed to be available to the\natheist. Taken at face value, this reply rules out a relaxed standards\ninterpretation; it indeed rules out any interpretation involving a\nnaturalistic solution to the problem of dreaming. \nOn closer inspection, the Sixth Meditation passage puts forward not a\nnaturalistic solution, but a theistic one. The meditator\nfinally concludes that he’s awake because, as the passage\nexplicitly reads, “God is not a deceiver” (AT 7:90, CSM\n2:62). \nHow does his argument go? Recall, in the proof of the external\nmaterial world\n (Section 7.2),\n that Descartes mysteriously invokes the following (divinely\nguaranteed) truth rule: \nThe dreaming passage looks to have Descartes again invoking this rule.\nThe passage opens with the meditator observing the following: \nReferring to the worry that he’s presently dreaming as\nexaggerated suggests that condition (i) is met – i.e.,\nsuggests that the present circumstance includes a “natural\npropensity” to believe he’s awake. As such, he needs only\nto establish condition (ii), and he’ll have a divine guarantee\nof being awake. Here, notice that an important theme of the above\npassage concerns the meditator’s faculties for correcting\nsensory error – a theme suggestive of condition (ii). In\ncontext, Descartes’ appeal to the continuity test is perhaps\nbest understood in conjunction with condition (ii). As the meditator\nsays (speaking of his apparently waking experience): \nCentral to the inference is the meditator’s effort to check the\ncorrectness of his belief, by means of his various faculties. The\ncases like these to which Descartes refers look to be those\nwhere conditions (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. Recall what\nDescartes writes in conjunction with the proof of the external\nmaterial world: from “the very fact that God is not a\ndeceiver” there is a “consequent impossibility of there\nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some\nother faculty supplied by God” (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Perhaps,\ntherefore, we can understand Descartes’ theistic solution to the\nNow Dreaming Doubt as building on the same rule he employs in\nhis proof for the external material world. \nWhat about Hobbes’s other objection – in effect, that one\ncould dream both (i) and (ii)? Descartes’ response:\n“A dreamer cannot really connect his dreams with the ideas of\npast events, though he may dream that he does. For everyone admits\nthat a man may be deceived in his sleep.” (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137)\nPerhaps Descartes thinks the situation with dreaming parallels that of\nwaking life: those who are sufficiently tired, or otherwise\nperceptually inattentive, “cannot really” perceive truths\nclearly and distinctly, though it may seem to them that they\ndo. Whether in waking or dreaming, the Fourth Meditation theodicy has\nGod allowing us to make judgment errors, provided that they are\ncorrectable. Descartes is committed to holding that when our\nperception is confused, we can in principle come to discover the\nconfusion – even if not easily. When we lack clear and distinct\nperception, we are at fault (not God) for any resulting judgments, in\npart because we can discover that our perception is confused.\nDescartes needs it that the same principle holds even while dreaming.\n(And again, nearly the entirety of the Meditations unfolds\nunder the supposition that, for all we know, we may presently be\ndreaming.) For the case at hand – i.e., the possibility of\nmistakenly judging that I’m awake, while in a dream\n– Descartes needs it that we could, in principle, discover that\nwe’re mistaken. Apropos of condition (ii), therefore, is whether\nGod has provided us a faculty by which to discover that we’re\ndreaming, on occasions when we wrongly believe ourselves to be awake.\nEvidently, Descartes thinks so, as he tells Gassendi: \nImportantly, Descartes does not say we can easily correct the\nmistake of dreaming that we’re awake. To the contrary,\nthe Sixth Meditation treatment of the Now Dreaming Doubt closes with a\nconcession that his solution is perhaps more theoretical than\npractical: \nThus the importance of Descartes’ First Meditation remark that\n“no danger or error will result” from the program of\nmethodical doubt, “because the task now in hand does not involve\naction” (AT 7:22, CSM 2:15). Methodical doubt should not be\napplied to practical matters. Prudence dictates that when making\npractical decisions I should assume I’m awake, even if I\ndon’t perfectly know that I’m awake. Judgment errors made\nwhile mistakenly assuming I’m awake couldn’t have\nactual practical consequences, unlike those made while mistakenly\nassuming I’m dreaming. \nFurther reading: See Newman (1999), Williams (1978), and\nWilson (1978). \nDescartes holds that our judgments about our own minds are\nepistemically better-off than our judgments about bodies. In our\nnatural, pre-reflective condition, however, we’re apt to confuse\nthe sensory images of bodies with the external things themselves, a\nconfusion leading us to think our judgments about bodies are\nepistemically impressive. The confusion is clearly expressed\n(Descartes would say) in G. E. Moore’s famous claim to knowledge\n– “Here is a hand” – along with his more\ngeneral defense of common sense: \nIn contrast, Descartes writes: \nMethodical doubt is intended to help us appreciate the folly of the\ncommonsensical position – helping us recognize that perception\nof our own minds is “not simply prior to and more certain\n… but also more evident” than perception of our own\nbodies (Prin. 1:11, AT 8a:8, CSM 1:196). “Disagreement\non this point,” writes Descartes, comes from “those who\nhave not done their philosophizing in an orderly way”; from\nthose who, while properly acknowledging the “certainty of their\nown existence,” mistakenly “take ‘themselves’\nto mean only their bodies” – failing to “realize\nthat they should have taken ‘themselves’ in this context\nto mean their minds alone” (Prin. 1:12, AT 8a:9, CSM\n1:196). \nIn epistemological contexts, Descartes underwrites the\nmind-better-known-than-body doctrine with methodical doubt. For\nexample, while reflecting on his epistemic position in regards both to\nhimself, and to the wax, the Second Meditation meditator says:  \nOther reasons may motivate Descartes as well. He may take the doctrine\nto be closely allied to a representational theory of sense perception.\nAccordingly, our sense organs and nerves serve as literal mediating\nlinks in the causal chain generating perception: they stand between\n(both spatially and causally) external things themselves, and the\nbrain events occasioning our perceptual awareness (cf. Prin.\n4:196). In veridical sensation, the objects of immediate sensory\nawareness are not external bodies themselves, nor are we immediately\naware of the states of our sense organs or nerves. Rather, the objects\nof immediate awareness are – whether in veridical sensation, or\nin dreams – the mind’s own ideas. Descartes\nindeed holds that the fact of physiological mediation helps explain\ndelusional ideas, because roughly the same kinds of physiological\nprocesses that produce waking ideas are employed in producing\ndelusional ideas: \nVarious passages of the Meditations lay important groundwork\nfor this theory of perception. For instance, one of the messages of\nthe wax passage is that sensory awareness does not reach to external\nthings themselves:  \nDescartes thinks we’re apt to be “tricked by ordinary ways\nof talking” (ibid.). In ordinary contexts we don’t say\nthat it seems there are men outside the window; we say that\nwe see them. Nor, in such contexts, are our beliefs about\nthose men apt to result from conscious, inferentially complex\njudgments, say, like this one: “Well, I appear to be awake, and\nthe window pane looks clean, and there’s plenty of light\noutside, and so on, and I thus conclude that I am seeing men outside\nthe window.” Even so, our ordinary ways of speaking and thinking\noften mislead. Descartes’ view is that the mind’s\nimmediate perception does not, strictly speaking, extend beyond\nitself, to external bodies. This is an important basis of the\nmind-better-known-than-body doctrine. In the concluding paragraph of\nthe Second Meditation, Descartes writes: \nThe understanding of ideas as the only immediate objects of awareness\narises in a number of texts. In the Sixth Meditation, while discussing\nsense perception and our ideas of external things, Descartes writes\nthat the mind’s sensation extends strictly and immediately only\nto the ideas: “the ideas were, strictly speaking, the only\nimmediate objects of my sensory awareness [solas proprie et\nimmediate sentiebam]” (AT 7:75, CSM 2:52). In the Second\nReplies, Descartes defines thought “to include\neverything that is within us in such a way that we are immediately\naware of it”; while defining idea in terms of the\n“immediate perception” that makes us “aware of the\nthought” (AT 7:160, CSM 2:113). And in the Third Replies he\nwrites: “I make it quite clear in several places … that I\nam taking the word ‘idea’ to refer to whatever is\nimmediately perceived by the mind” (AT 7:181, CSM 2:127). \nComplicating an understanding of such passages is that Descartes\nscholarship is divided on whether to attribute to him some version of\nan indirect theory of perception, or instead some version of a direct\ntheory. According to indirect perception accounts, in normal sensation\nthe mind’s perception of bodies is mediated by an awareness of\nits ideas of those bodies. By contrast, direct perception\ninterpretations allow that in normal sensation the mind’s ideas\nplay a mediating role, though this role doesn’t have ideas\nfunctioning as items of awareness; rather, the objects of direct\nawareness are the external things, themselves. On both accounts, ideas\nmediate our perception of external objects. On direct theory accounts,\nthe mediating role is only a process role. By analogy, various brain\nprocesses mediate our perception of external objects, but in the\nnormal course of perception we are not consciously aware of\nthose processes; and likewise for the mind’s ideas,\naccording to direct perception accounts. On one recent version of an\nindirect perception interpretation, sensory ideas mediate our\nperception of the external bodies they’re of, in much the same\nway that pictures (or other representational media) mediate our\nperception of what they portray (Newman 2009). More generally,\nDescartes seems to view all ideas as mental pictures, of a sort. As he\nwrites: “the term ‘idea’ is strictly\nappropriate” only for thoughts that “are as it were the\nimages of things” (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:25); he adds that\n“the ideas in me are like {pictures, or} images” (Med. 3,\nAT 7:42, CSM 2:29).  \nIndirect perception interpretations have figured prominently in the\nhistory of Descartes scholarship. A number of recent commentators,\nhowever, have challenged this traditional view. For example, John\nCarriero’s recent book on Descartes defends a direct perception\ninterpretation: “I don’t read Descartes as holding that I\nam (immediately) aware only of my sensory ideas and only subsequently\n(and perhaps indirectly) aware of bodies or their qualities”\n(2009, 25). Thus on Carriero’s reading, Descartes’ broader\nargument rebutting our doubts about the external world is not to be\nunderstood as an effort to get on the other side (as it were) of our\nideas: \nWe have seen that the proper use of our cognitive faculties requires\nus to withhold assent except when our perception is clear and distinct\n– that forming judgments in accord with the C&D Rule\nprovides the only guarantee of truth. Let’s apply this to\nintrospective judgments. Suppose that the present contents of my mind\ninclude a confused array of ideas – say, a confused assemblage\nof auditory ideas, or color ideas, or perhaps I am presently flooded\nwith a confused assortment of ideas of emotion. In such cases, the\nproper use of my faculties requires me to withhold judgment about the\npresent state of my mind. \nIt is surprising, therefore, to learn that on the standard view among\nscholars, Descartes holds a strong view of privileged access\nguaranteeing the truth of all introspective judgments about\nthe present contents of our own minds. On the standard view, Descartes\nholds an infallibility thesis whereby judgments about our own mental\nstates cannot be mistaken, if based on introspective awareness: if I\nseem to be in mental state x, then I am in\nx. (A variety of related doctrines are also attributed to\nhim, including the indubitability of the mental –\nroughly, that introspective judgments are indubitable; and\nomniscience with respect to the mental – roughly, that\none has knowledge of every true proposition about one’s own\npresent contents of consciousness. There is some variation in the way\nthese doctrines are formulated in the literature.) \nAt least two lines of argument are widely cited in support of this\nstandard interpretation. One draws on the transparency doctrine. The\nother draws on texts claimed to provide support. Let’s examine\nboth. \nThe transparency doctrine has it that we are aware of everything\noccurring in our minds – this, a result of Descartes’ view\nthat thinking constitutes the whole essence of\nmind: \nAdd to this that, unlike with external sensation, there is no\nintrospective appearance/reality gap, and there can seem to be no room\nfor introspective errors. Zeno Vendler explains: \nKenny adds: \nThose who question the interpretation are apt to note that from the\nfact that I have awareness of whatever is occurring in my mind, it\ndoes not follow that I have distinct awareness. If\nwhat’s occurring in my mind is a confused muddle of ideas, then\nI’ll be aware of a confused muddle of ideas. But in that case,\nforming a judgment about the present state of my mind is a recipe for\nerror – i.e., given the Fourth Meditation account of proper\njudgment. Because simpler ideas are generally easier to render clear\nand distinct, it can perhaps seem that I enjoy introspective\ninfallibility concerning them. For example, while looking at a clear\nblue sky, it may seem unmistakable that I’m presently having an\nidea of blue. But suppose that while looking at multicolored sunset, I\nform an introspective judgment about precisely which color\nideas are occurring in my mind. Must Descartes say that such judgments\nare infallible? Noteworthy is that he writes, of “sensations,\nemotions and appetites,” that “we are frequently wrong in\nour judgements concerning them”; adding, that we can avoid such\nerrors “provided we take great care in our judgements concerning\nthem to include no more than what is strictly contained in our\nperception – no more than that of which we have inner\nawareness” (Prin 1:66, AT 8a:32, CSM 1:216). \nConsider another case that’s at odds with the standard\ninterpretation. Were Descartes committed to introspective\ninfallibility, then he should say that we could never be\nmistaken as to whether our occurring ideas are ideas of\nsensation, or instead ideas of imagination occurring\nin a dream. Yet as we’ve seen, he takes dreaming-based\nscepticism utterly seriously. \nWhat about the textual line of argument regularly cited in support of\nthe standard interpretation? Consider two Meditations\npassages that can seem to entail the infallibility thesis. \nI certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This\ncannot be false; what is called “having a sensory\nperception” is strictly just this, and in this restricted sense\nof the term it is simply thinking. (Med. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19) \nNow as far as ideas are concerned, provided they are considered solely\nin themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot\nstrictly speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that\nI am imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the\nlatter. As for the will and the emotions, here too one need not worry\nabout falsity; for even if the things which I may desire are wicked or\neven non-existent, that does not make it any less true that I desire\nthem. (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:26) \nPrima facie, it is plausible to take such passages to entail that if\nif I seem to be having an idea of blue, or an idea of a\nnoise, or of warmth, etc., then I am. Indeed, one might take\nsuch passages to convey that judgments to this effect “cannot be\nfalse” because introspective judgments are infallible.\nBut note the continuation of the second passage: “Thus the only\nremaining thoughts where I must be on my guard against making a\nmistake are judgements.” That is, these passages can be read in\na very different. Accordingly, a mere seeming “cannot\nbe false” because it is not the kind of mental state that\ncould be false; on Descartes’ view, falsity\narises not simply from the mind’s awareness of its ideas, but\nfrom judgments – i.e., from acts of will assenting to those\nitems of awareness. Read in this way, these passages anticipate the\nFourth Meditation theory of judgment: \nArguably, Descartes’ mind-better-known-than-body\ndoctrine is intended as a comparative rather than a\nsuperlative thesis. We have seen that, for Descartes, the\nonly superlative perceptual state is that of clarity and distinctness.\nThe only guarantee of truth in our introspective judgments is, like\nall other judgments, when they are based on clear and distinct\nperception: if I clearly and distinctly perceive myself to be in\nmental state x, then I am in x. \nFurther reading: On Descartes’ theory of ideas, see\nCarriero (2009), Chappell (1986), Hoffman (1996), Jolley (1990),\nNadler (2006), Nelson (1997), Newman (2009 and 2011), and Smith\n(2014).
