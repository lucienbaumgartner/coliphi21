He\ninvestigated a variety of different topics, ranging from general\nissues like motion, causation, place and time, to systematic\nexplorations and explanations of natural phenomena across different\nkinds of natural entities. These different inquiries are integrated\ninto the framework of a single overarching enterprise describing the\ndomain of natural entities. Aristotle provides the general theoretical\nframework for this enterprise in his Physics, a treatise which\ndivides into two main parts, the first an inquiry into nature (books\n1–4) and the second a treatment of motion (books\n 5–8).[1]\n In this work, Aristotle sets out the conceptual apparatus for his\nanalysis, provides definitions of his fundamental concepts, and argues\nfor specific theses about motion, causation, place and time, and\nestablishes in bk. 8 the existence of the unmoved mover of the\nuniverse, a supra-physical entity, without which the physical domain\ncould not remain in existence. He takes up problems of special\ninterest to physics (such as the problem of generation and perishing)\nin a series of further physical treatises, some of which are devoted\nto particular physical domains: the  De generatione et corruptione\n(On Generation and Perishing), the De caelo (On the\n Heavens),[2]\n and the Meteorology, which lead up to the treatises on\nbiology and psychology.[3]\n\n\n The science of physics, Aristotle stresses, contains almost all there\nis to know about the world. Were there no separate\nforms—entities such as the unmoved mover at the pinnacle of the\ncosmos—which are without matter and are not part of the physical\nworld, physics would be what Aristotle calls first philosophy\n(Metaphysics 6.1, 1026a27–31).  As there are such separate\nentities, physics is dependent on these, and is only a second\nphilosophy (Metaphysics 7.11, 1037a14f).  Nevertheless, the\ninteraction between these two “philosophies” is not\ncompletely exhausted by the causal influence exerted on the world by\nthe supra-physical entities—the prime movers \nas it turns out. Aristotle’s metaphysics \nand physics use a common conceptual framework, and they often address \nsimilar issues. The prime and distinctive task of first philosophy is \nan inquiry into first entities; these, however, are not perceptible \nentities, and as a result they have to be investigated through a \nmetaphysical investigation of physical entities.  Hence the overlap \nbetween the two disciplines, which often verges on inseparability.\n\n\n Nature, according to Aristotle, is an inner principle of change and\nbeing at rest (Physics 2.1, 192b20–23). This means that when\nan entity moves or is at rest according to its nature reference to its\nnature may serve as an explanation of the event. We have to describe\nhow—to what extent, through what other processes, and due to\nwhat agency—the preconditions for the process of change or of being\nat rest are present, but once we have provided an account of these\npreconditions, we have given a complete account of the process.  The\nnature of the entity is in and of itself sufficient to induce and to\nexplain the process once the relevant circumstances do not preempt\nit. \n Natures as inner principles of change and rest are contrasted with\nactive powers or potentialities (dunameis), which are\nexternal principles of change and being at rest (Metaphysics\n9.8, 1049b5–10), operative on the corresponding internal passive\ncapacities or potentialities (dunameis again,\nMetaphysics 9.1, 1046a11–13). When a change, or a state of\nrest, is not natural, both the active and the passive potentiality\nneed to be specified. Natures, then, in a way do double duty: once a\nnature is operative, neither a further active, nor a further passive\ncapacity needs to be invoked. Even so, as will be clear from\nAristotle’s discussion, this general thesis \nwill require a host of qualifications. \n Because natures—beside the active and passive\npotentialities—are ultimate grounds in causal explanations,\nAristotle sets out how they are integrated with the doctrine of\ncausation. \n An explanation for a state of affairs must specify some feature or\nsome object (in general, some abstract or concrete entity) which is\nresponsible for it. The entity responsible is, Aristotle submits, a\ncause (aitia or aition, words used interchangeably\nby\n Aristotle).[4]\n Different explanations of a single state of affairs are possible, and\nindeed usually necessary, because there are different ways of being\nresponsible for distinct facets of the same state of affairs. The\nvarieties of responsibilities are grouped by Aristotle under four\nheadings, the so-called four causes. \n The first two of these are matter and form, what an entity is made up\nfrom according to Aristotle’s hylomorphic \nanalysis. Understandably, both of them can be responsible for the \nfeatures and the behaviour of the entity they make up.  Hylomorphic \nanalysis, together with the separation of the material and formal \ncauses as distinct types, implies that if something is explicable in \nterms of matter or form, explanations in terms of form will be different \nin kind from those given in terms of matter.  As a rule there is a \ncollaboration between these causes: matter provides the potentialities \nwhich are actualised by the form.  Accordingly, these causally \nrelevant entities give rise to a hierarchic structure of\nexplanation.[5]   \nIn order for a form to be realised, one needs to have suitable matter.  \nThis suitable matter brings with it the features required by a given \nhylomorphic composite. These features, then, are on the one hand the \ncontribution of the matter, and as such the matter is the (material) \ncause of these features of the composite entity, whereas on the other \nhand they are indispensable presuppositions for the realisation of the \nform, and to that extent their presence is prompted by the\n form.[6]\n Such dependency relations between matter and form are labelled by\nAristotle as cases of hypothetical necessity.  Aristotle sometimes\nillustrates his point by appealing to the matter required for the\nconstruction of a house.  If there is a house to be built, one needs\nbuilding bricks, slabs, mortar, etc. Each part provides material with\nproperties within a definite range of the sort required for a house to\ncome into being.  A house cannot, for example, be made out of liquid\nwater.  This sort of matter provides potentialities not suited to the\nform of house. \n Explanations often specify entities beyond the role played by the\nmatter and the form of the entity itself. These cases are grouped by\nAristotle as efficient or moving causes on the one hand and as final\ncauses on the other. Efficient causes operate in a straightforward\nmanner by initiating processes and bringing about their effects,\nwhereas final causes account for processes and entities by being what\nthese processes and entities are for, what they objectively intend to\n attain.[7]  \n The fact that the role of efficient causes is not identical to that\nof the matter and the form of the entity whose features they are to\nexplain does not require that every instance of efficient causation\nmust issue from outside the entity moved.  On the contrary, an\nefficient cause can also be internal. In cases in which the efficient\ncause is internal, it will be, in its specific function, one of the\nparts, or even the formal aspect, of the entity caused to move. \n Natures, understandably, can feature in any of these four causal\nfunctions.  However, when the matter of an entity functions as its \nnature—i.e., when its natural motion and rest\nare explained in terms of the matter it is made of—this\nmatter must possess some causally relevant features, bestowed upon it\nby its own formal aspect. \nThis role of matter can be contrasted to the causal role of the three\nfurther types of causes—of form, of efficient \ncause, and of final cause respectively. This is so, because, as Aristotle\nadds, form and final cause often coincide. Moreover, when a nature is \nspecified as a first efficient cause, cause and effect are the same in \nform (or in species), though this is not to say that one and the same \nentity causes itself and is caused through its own causal efficacy\n(Physics 2.7, 198a24–27, cf. Metaphysics 8.4,\n1044a32–b1). \n As internal principles of moving and rest, natures stand in an\nexclusive relationship to the efficient or moving causes of the\nmotions and rests they bring about: in some cases when Aristotle is\nnot specifying the first moving cause, he can assert the identity of\nnature and moving cause. Accordingly, the soul of living beings will\nbe identified as the substance (i.e., form) and the moving cause of the\n organism whose soul it\nis.[8] \n But the identification, even in this restricted sense, will need\nsome further important qualifications, to which we will return in\nSection 5 below, on movers and unmoved movers. \n Because motion or change (kinêsis) is mentioned in the \ndefinition of nature, any discussion of nature will need to rely \nupon the explanation of motion. One \nmight—erroneously—think\nthat this is an easy task, because Aristotle’s \ncategories (as listed in the  Categories and also elsewhere) do \ncontain two related types of entities, action and passion. \nAristotle’s discussion of motion in the \nPhysics, however, starts out in a somewhat different manner. \nWhen he submits that there is no motion besides the categories \n(Physics 3.1, at 200b32–201a3), he does not assign motions to \nthe categories of action and passion. After mentioning that the entities \nin the categories come in oppositions, Aristotle claims a few lines \nlater (at 201a8–9) that there are as many kinds of motion and change as \nthere are kinds of being. This means that motions are grouped here with \nthe entities of the category where they effect\n change.[9] \n Nevertheless, when making this claim, Aristotle speaks about four\nkinds of motion and change only—those in substance, in quality,\nin quantity and in place—whereas the number of the kinds of\nbeing should have remained ten. \n Indeed, the Physics will later submit its own list of\ncategories. That list is slightly reduced—it has seven or eight\nelements, depending on whether we include or exclude\n time.[10]  \n The reduced list also concludes with the claim that there are three\nkinds of motion, plus the additional kind of substantial\n change.[11]\n That is to say, even where Aristotle enumerates a fairly complete\nlist of categories, he will not have motions in every one of these\ncategories, and he is not content to relegate motions to the categories\nof action and\n passion.[12] \n But this is a context where Aristotle stresses another issue: he is\nnot interested in assigning a separate ontological niche for\nmotions—regardless of whether that might or might not have been\na feasible task within the categorization of entities. Here Aristotle\nis more intent on characterizing the ontological links which motions\nhave to entities falling into different categories, and to find a\ngeneral matrix of undergoing and effecting change. This happens in\nseveral steps. First Aristotle claims that changes of relations are\nnot changes in their own right; rather they are accidental, as they\noccur also in entities in which no change occurs at all, if the entity\nwhich they stand in relation to undergoes some\n change.[13]\n After these considerations the crucial two categories of action and\npassion are eliminated: As there are no motions of motions, we can set\naside action and passion (items (7) and (8) in the\n Categories).[14]\n This leaves us with the shorter list of relevant categories, (1)\nsubstance, (2) quality, (3) quantity, and (4)\n place.[15] \n Within the four domains where genuine change can occur, change always\nrequires the existence of a potentiality which can be actualised.  But\nchange is neither identical to this potentiality, nor to the lack of a\nproperty, nor, without further qualifications, to the actuality which\nis acquired when the potentiality is actualised (Physics 3.2,\n201b33–35).  It is a special kind of actuality, the actuality of the\npotential in so far as it is potential (Physics 3.2,\n201a27–29). Aristotle’s formulation strongly \nsuggests that the potentiality actualised in the process of change is \nnot a separate and independent potentiality for motion, alongside the \nentity’s potentiality for harbouring the \nend-state of the process: the process, say, house-building, and the \nend result, the house, are different actualisations of the same \npotentiality of a set of materials that is buildable into a house.  \nNot only would Aristotle’s definition be\nuninformative otherwise, amounting to the tautologous\nclaim that change is the actualisation of the capacity for change, the\nfurther qualification in the definition, that change is the actuality\nof the potential in so far as it is potential, would be completely\nidle.[16]\nThis further restriction is easiest taken as\nselecting between the different\ntypes of the realisations of the same\n potentialities.[17] \n As Aristotle stresses these are the incomplete actualities belonging\nto these potentialities, because what is actualised in a process of\nrealisation is an incomplete potentiality only (Physics 3.2,\n201b32–33).  Accordingly, potentialities of change are admitted into\nthe ontology. They, nevertheless, do not need to feature as potentialities in\ntheir own right, but as the incomplete variants of the fundamental\npotentiality for an end \n result.[18] \n It is furthermore important to note that potentiality in this\ndiscussion throughout excludes actuality. In a formulation closely\nmatching the formulation of the principle of non-contradiction,\nAristotle asserts that “some things are the same [=have the same\nproperties, are the same substances] both in potentiality and in\nactuality, but not at the same time or not in the same respect, as\ne.g.  [a thing is] warm in actuality and cold in potentiality”\n(Physics 3.1,\n 201a19–22).[19] \n Hence the ability of Aristotle’s definition \nto pick out the paradoxical entity, which is the actuality of a \npotentiality that can no longer be present once it has been replaced \nby the corresponding property in actuality. \n The definition of motion suggests that such processes can be\ncharacterised in terms of a property or state of an entity, acquired\nas a result at the end of the process, which can be labelled the \nform within this process, and an initial lack of this\nform. Furthermore, Aristotle claims, there is a third component, which\nis not changed in the process, the substrate or subject of the motion\n(Physics \n1.7).[20] \n In terms of this threefold division it is the duty of the entity\neffecting change to confer the requisite form on the object changed,\nas Physics 3.2, 202a9–11 puts it. But there are further\nimportant requirements for such a change to occur. First of all, these\nmotions or changes occur at the interaction of two\npotentialities. One, the passive potentiality, is in the object\nundergoing change, while the other, the active potentiality, is in the\nentity initiating change.  The two potentialities need to match each\nother: when there is a potentiality for being heated in the object\nundergoing change, the process needs to be initiated by another object\npossessing an active potentiality for effecting the heating. This is true to\nthe extent that Aristotle can claim that the definition of passive\npotentiality is dependent on that of the active potentiality\n(Metaphysics 9.1, 1046a9–13). These two potentialities need\nto work in tandem, and consequently Aristotle can claim that there is\nonly a single process going on, which is located in the entity\nmoved. Thus, for example, when a process of instruction is going on,\nit is identical to a process of knowledge acquisition, which happens\nin the mind of the learner. Hence although action and passion retain\ntheir categorical difference, because their accounts are different,\nwhat they subsist in, the motion, will be the same (Physics\n3.3,\n 202b19–22).[21] \n Aristotle already by the introduction of a matching pair of active\nand passive potentialities for each causal interaction comes very\nclose to admitting a separate potentiality for each and every change,\nsomething uncomfortably close to the vis dormitiva, ridiculed\nby Molière, according to which a sleeping pill \nallegedly induces sleep just in virtue of its power to induce sleep.  \nAristotle, however, subscribes to an even stronger principle, that \ncauses in effecting change transmit the form they possess to the \nentity they effect change in. According to this claim the active capacity\nof the item effecting change is at its root an actuality, which is synonymous\n(in the Aristotelian sense) with the effect that is brought about\nby it. In Aristotle’s favourite example, only a\nhuman in actuality produces a human from what is a human in\npotentiality.  If this is so, a sleeping pill need not only possess an\nactive potentiality for inducing sleep: it needs also to be slumbering\n itself.[22]\n The principle—which we could term the principle of \ncausational synonymy—comes from Plato (see e.g.\nPhaedo 100B–101D), but Aristotle has his own reasons\nfor endorsing it. His science attests to the presence and\noperation of causally active forms at each level of analysis of the\nphysical\n world.[23] \n Hence, as we shall see, Aristotle’s forms \nare the causally significant components of the substance effecting a \nchange. Accordingly, when it comes to specifying the moving cause of \nan artefact, Aristotle will refer to the art of the craftsman as the\nfundamental component operative in the change.  In cases where a\nliving being is generated, it is the parental form which is\ntransmitted to the newly emerging living\n being.[24] \n But it is not only processes of generation that conform to this\nrequirement.  Instances of qualitative change are often mentioned\nalongside substantial generation, and as a crucially important\ninstance of qualitative alteration—or of \nqualitative quasi-alteration, depending on how we interpret \nAristotle’s theory of \nperception[25]—Aristotle\npresupposes that the principle of causational synonymy \ncharacterises also the causal link connecting the object of \nsensation and the sense organ.  \n \n It is, nevertheless, important to note that Aristotle restricts the\nprinciple of causational synonymy in different and subtle ways. Most\nsignificantly, an important domain of cases where a property of an\nobject is actualised is exempted from the requirements of this\nprinciple. The actualisation of a property can be the continuation of\na previous causal process to the extent that Aristotle claims it is a\nsecond actuality, following upon a previously acquired\nfirst actuality. In these cases the emergence of the second\nactuality does not necessarily require an additional external\nefficient cause. The operation of this first actuality, through which\nit reinforces and completes itself, can be the mere extension of the\noperation of the original efficient cause (this will be \nAristotle’s claim about the natural \nlocomotion of the elements, see\n Section 5\n below), or the entity which has acquired this first actuality can be\nalready causally responsible for its own activities, including the\nones which bring it to a level of higher\n actuality[26]\n (Aristotle’s examples for this case are \nthe soul of the embryo or of the newborn cub, which commands and \neffects the nourishing and the activities of the animal; or the \nactual application of a piece of knowledge one has acquired \nbeforehand). It is important to note that these claims are far from \ntrivial: they rest on further claims that the very definitions of \nthese first actualities (what it is to be an element, an animal, or \nknowledge, respectively) inseparably include references to these \nactivities.\n \nSecond, the principle of causational synonymy is couched in terms\nwhich do not include locomotions: it is substantial, qualitative or\nquantitative form which is claimed to be transmitted through the\nefficacy of the cause in Physics 3.2, 202a9–12.  One of\nthe reasons for this is that locomotion, as Aristotle claims, affects\nthe least the substance, the ousia of the object undergoing\nmotion (Physics 8.7, 261a20f). Unlike the other types of\nchange, locomotion does not change the being of the moved object at\nall. To some extent that should mean that the predication of place\nshould remain extrinsic to the being of the entity that is at a\nparticular\n location.[27]\n Hence the fundamental presupposition of\ncausation, that it is intrinsic characterisations of entities which\nare conferred on the object moved cannot be in full force in cases of\nlocomotion.[28]\nAccordingly, Aristotle will have a more intricate account for natural\nand forced locomotions. \n Third, the principle of causational synonymy is restricted to\nsubstances at the end of Metaphysics \n 7.9,[29]\n and in the first half of the same chapter the non-standard presence\nof some causally relevant forms may also be envisaged.  \nAristotle’s example there is the heat in \nmotion, which produces heat in the body when the doctor rubs the \npatient in the appropriate manner. This heat in the motion can be \nthe presence of an active potentiality in the motion which is able \nto elicit heat in the body, without heat being predicable of motion \nitself.  But even if such non-inherential subsistence of properties \nis not envisaged in this passage—the\nalternative being that the heat in motion is the heat in the skin of\nthe patient, caused by the rub, which then enters into the inner\nrecesses of the body, becoming heat in the body—some \nsimilar sort of presence is required in two large classes of cases: natural\ngenerations and artificial productions.\n \n Aristotle claims that in a chain of efficient causes, where the first\nelement of the series acts through the intermediary of the other\nitems, it is the first member in the causal chain, rather than the\nintermediaries, which is the moving cause (Physics 8.5,\n257a10–12).  Then, both in cases of natural generation and artificial\nproduction, it is only this first efficient cause which has to satisfy\nthe requirement of synonymous causation. \nAristotle’s prime example, that human \ngenerates human, is also such a case. Here, the causal efficacy of the \npaternal human form is transmitted through the generative \npotentialities of the semen of the father. The semen, however, although \nit acts as an efficient cause in the process of the formation of the \nembryo, is not a human; it does not possess the form it transmits in \nthe same way as the male parent. Aristotle’s \ndiscussion makes it clear that this is not an isolated instance of an\nexception from the general principle.  He compares the case to the\nactivity of a craftsman, where the form of the product of the artistic\nproduction is in the soul of the craftsman, and then through the\nmotions of the instruments this form can get imposed on the material\nmanufactured into an artefact. The instruments and their motions are\nefficient causes of the process, but they do not contain the form in\nthe same way as the soul of the craftsman (On the generation of\nanimals 730b14–23 and 740b25–29, for further discussion see the\nentry on\n Aristotle’s biology).[30] \n All these restrictions notwithstanding, Aristotle can claim that the\nprinciple of causational synonymy remains universally valid. This is\nso, because all the three restrictions above specify cases where\nAristotle can claim that a preceding, more prominent cause has already\nsatisfied the requirement: in the case of second actualities the first\nactuality was called into existence by a synonymous cause in the first\nplace; locomotions, qualitative and quantitative changes, even if not\ncaused by a synonymous entity, can be part of a larger pattern of\ncausation, in which a substance is caused by a substance of the same\nkind; and causal chains producing substances can be claimed to start\nout invariably from synonymous substances.   \n Given his commitment to causal synonymy, Aristotle needs to invoke\nconsiderations through which a chain of efficient causes of some\nentity can be meaningfully compared in terms of causal efficacy. These\nconsiderations will on each occasion describe synonymous causes not\nonly as temporally prior, but also as having priority in terms of\ncausal efficacy over the intermediate causes, which are responsible\nonly for the transmission of the forms of the original locus of causal\nefficacy.   \n This allows, then, that in the two major paradigms of such\ncausation—in natural generation and in artificial\nproduction—the forms—the nature of the natural entity, and\nthe\n art[31]\n of the craftsman exercising his art respectively—are the\ncausally operative entities initiating change. This has wide ranging\nconsequences for the status of forms in several respects. First, the\ncausal relevance of these forms shows that not any arrangement or\nconfiguration can qualify as a full-fledged form. While it is true\nthat privations are also forms in some sense (Physics 2.1,\n193b19–20), this is not the sense in which the causally operative\nforms, describable in evaluative terms, can be called forms.\nMoreover, the causal relevance of forms allows Aristotle to switch\n(e.g. in De generatione et corruptione 1.7) without notice\nbetween the craftsman and the craft itself as the appropriate\nspecification of the efficient cause in these cases. We should note\nthat in the latter cases, Aristotle specifies causes which are\nunmoved. They do not effect motion by being in motion themselves, in\nso far as they are the causally effective forms within the causal\nframework; hence they are not under any reactive influence during this\nprocess either. \n Even though the foregoing might have suggested that generation of\nsubstances is fundamental for all the other kinds of changes, in fact\nlocomotion will have a privileged status.  All other changes depend on\nlocomotions, because any two entities involved in change, with their\nactive and passive potentialities respectively, need to come into\ncontact in order for the interaction to\n occur.[32]\n Contact, however, as a rule needs to be established by locomotion:\neither the entity to be moved, or the mover, or both, need to proceed\nso that they meet (Physics 8.7, 260a26–b7).  Moreover\nlocomotion is the form of change which can occur in isolation of\ngeneration, perishing and the other forms of change (Physics\n8.7, 260b26–29). Other changes are independent kinds of change insofar\nas they can occur in an entity which does not perform any other\nchange. Nevertheless all these forms of change include or presuppose\nthat some other entity engages in\n locomotion.[33] \n Aristotle argues at the opening of Physics bk. 8 that motion\nand change in the universe can have no beginning, because the\noccurrence of change presupposes a previous process of change. With\nthis argument Aristotle can establish an eternal chain of motions and\nrefute those who hold that there could have been a previous stationary\nstate of the universe. Such an eternal chain, Aristotle argues, needs\nto rely on a cause which guarantees its persistence: if each of the\nconstitutive processes in the causally connected web were of finite\nduration, for every one of them it can be the case that it is not\npresent in the world, indeed, at some later time it will not be\npresent any longer. But then the whole causally connected series of\nevents, Aristotle claims, would also be\n contingent.[34]\n Hence Aristotle postulates that the processes of the universe depend\non an eternal motion (or on several eternal motions), the eternal\nrevolution of the heavenly spheres, which in turn is dependent on one\nor several unmoved movers (Physics 8.6,\n 258b26–259a9).[35] \n The priority of the eternal celestial revolutions, furthermore,\nguarantees the causal finitude of the universe. This is so, even\nthough there are infinite causal chains: behind every single\nindividual of an animal species there is an infinite series of male\nancestors, each causally responsible for the subsequent members in the\nseries, because Aristotelian species are eternal and male parents are\nthe efficient causes of their\n offspring.[36]\n Left to its own devices, the finite universe on its own would certainly\nreach a dissolution, a state of complete separation of the elemental\nmasses into their concentrically arranged natural places. In view of\nthe fact that such a complete segregation of the elemental masses is\navoided through the constant excitation caused by the celestial\nmotions, producing heat in the sublunary domain, especially around the\nregions of the\n Sun,[37]\n Aristotle will be entitled to assert that the cause of the human\nbeing is in the first instance his or her father, but is at the same\ntime the Sun as it moves along its annual ecliptic\n path.[38]\n Between celestial revolutions and the individual natural processes\nthere is always a finite causal chain, as these natural processes\ncould not possibly have continued without the celestial motions.  The\ninfinite causal chains passing through male parents cannot subsist on\ntheir own without this constant external support, and this dependence\ncan always be analysed in terms of finite causal chains. \n The definition of motion as the actuality of a potentiality of the\nentity undergoing motion in so far as it is potential requires that in\neach case the passive potentiality for the change is present in the\nchanging object.  The presence of the potentiality can, nevertheless,\nbe in accordance with the nature of the object—in which case the\nchange is natural (phusei) or according to\nnature (kata phusin), or can happen in the face of a\ncontrary disposition on the part of the nature of the entity—in\nwhich case the change is forced (biâi) or\ncontrary to nature (para phusin). A major\npresupposition on Aristotle’s part is that \nthis division is exhaustive: there are no changes to which the \nnature of the entity would be indifferent or\n neutral.[39]\n The major consideration behind such a presupposition is that natures\nregulate the behaviour of the entities to which they belong in a\ncomprehensive manner, and not merely partially. Any influence the\nentity is exposed to interacts with its nature in a substantive\nmanner. The entity does not possess potentialities for change which\nwould not be directly related to the tendencies emerging from its\nnature.\n \n Note, however, that even if we endorsed the exhaustiveness of the\ndichotomy of natural and forced motions, and accepted the thesis that\nsimple bodies possess a unique natural motion (De caelo 1.2,\n269a8–9), we would not need thereby to accept \nAristotle’s further major claim, that \nnatural and forced motions come in pairs of opposites, with the \nresult that if a motion is contrary to the nature of an entity, the \nopposite motion will be its natural motion (De caelo 1.2, \n269a9–18).  Where there is room for some more complex relationships \namong the targets of changes than a simple opposition along an axis \nof a single dimension—and this is eminently so\nbetween locomotions along rectilinear and circular paths\nrespectively—there can be several forced \ntranslations in contrast to the single natural motion of the elements\nendowed with rectilinear natural motion, as Aristotle \nalso admits in some passages of the De caelo (see 1.2, \n269a30–b2 and 269b10–12).\n Although this allows for several different motions that are contrary \nto the nature of the same entity, the natural motion will still have a \nsingle opposite motion, the one which is directed to the opposite \nlocation. Consequently, natural circular motion will have no motion that\nis opposite to it (De caelo 1.4, \n270b32–271a5).[40] \nAristotle’s classification of motions into \nthose contrary to nature and those according to nature applies not \nonly to the motions of the moved objects, but transfers also to the \nmovers effecting motions. A mover can effect a motion which is \ncontrary to its own nature. Aristotle’s \nexample of such an unnatural mover is the lever, an object heavy by \nnature, with which loads can  be lifted (Physics 8.4, \n255a20–23).  Although such movers can effect motions in the \ncontrary direction to the motion at the head of the causal chain \n(levers are operated by the downward push of something heavy at the \nother end), the crucial consideration for Aristotle in this case is \nthat the original, initiating cause of the causal chain should \neffect the motion according to its nature. Taken together, these \nconsiderations imply that we have a complete account of the physical \ndomain once we have a thorough description of what is natural to the \nentites in that domain, together with a specification of all the \ncircumstances in which they \n operate.[41] \n Bk. 8 of the Physics argues for the additional thesis that\nfor each motion, whether natural or contrary to nature, there needs to\nexist a mover. [42] \nIn cases of forced motion, movers are present in a\nperspicuous way. This need not be so, however, in cases of natural\nmotion.  Apart from the cases where the nature of the entity is at the\nsame time a moving and efficient cause—i.e., apart from living\nbeings, whose nature, the soul, is both formal and efficient\ncause—the mover may be inconspicuous. This is eminently so in\nthe remaining large class of natural motions, the natural motions of\nthe elements. The nature of these elements, their inner principle of\nmotion and rest is not the moving cause of the motions of the\nelements, Aristotle claims. If it were, then it would be up to the\nelementary masses to determine when they should perform their motions,\nbut plainly it is not. Moreover, the principle of causational synonymy\nrules out that any homogenous mass, without an internal demarcation\ninto components which move and are moved, could move itself\n(Physics 8.4, 255a5–18). This is so because, on the\nassumption that one part of a homogenenous body could move another\npart, the active component of change would be, in every aspect,\nindistinguishable from the part in which change is effected, and this\nin turn would mean that change would occur even though there would be\nno transmission of a causally relevant property from the active part\nto the passive. This implies that even though we may answer the\nquestion as to why the elements move to their natural places—the\nlight bodies up and the heavy ones down—by an appeal to their\nrespective natures as causes (“that it is simply their nature to\nmove somewhere,[43]\n and this is what it is to be light and to be\nheavy,” Physics 8.4, 255b13–17), we do not thereby\nspecify their moving causes. Their thrust being in a single direction,\nthe elements cannot circumvent even rather simple obstacles they may\nencounter on their way (a sealed container can retain air under water,\nthe roof stays put pressing down on the walls of a building\netc.). Hence, whoever removes an obstacle to an element’s motion is\ncausally responsible for the ensuing elemental motions. But even such\na causally responsible agent will not qualify as the moving\ncause, without yet further qualifications.  For the identification of\nthe moving cause of these locomotions Aristotle invokes his\ndistinction of two potentialities.  Some heavy material can be\npotentially light, as it can be transformed into a light material in a\nprocess of generation, whereas the emerging light material is still\npotential in a sense until it has acquired its full-fledged status,\nwhich involves its having arrived at that region of the cosmos which\nis its natural place.  This analysis, then, describes the natural\nlocomotion of the elements as a possibly postponed, completing stage\nwithin a single overarching process, and hence in these cases\nAristotle can identify the cause of the second stage of the process\nwith the efficient cause of the first stage, the entity which\ngenerated the element in the first place (Physics 8.4,\n256a1). \n Once it is established that there is a mover for each change, the\nfinite causal\n chains[44]\ncan be followed up to the primary instance of motion, the celestial\nrevolutions. In particular the Sun’s course along the \necliptic is responsible for many sublunar changes, the rotating \nseasons being foremost among them. Whether the cosmos has unmoved \nor moved movers, moreover, whether the universe is causally closed \nor needs some continuous external causal influence for its \npreservation, depends ultimately, then, on the status of the \ncelestial motions. \n Revolutions in the celestial realm are the natural motions of the\nspecial element making up the celestial spheres. This, however, does\nnot entail that they have no need of an external\nunmoved[45]\n mover: the motions of the sublunary elements also occur under the\ninfluence of a moving cause. Nevertheless, the celestial bodies cannot\nbe moved by an external mover of the same sort as the sublunary\nelements.  These celestial bodies are eternal and ungenerated.\nConsequently, Aristotle cannot appeal to the entity which produced\nthem as responsible for their locomotions.  As they do not encounter\nany hindrance during their revolutions, there is no room for an\naccidental mover which would remove any obstacles in their way.\nNevertheless, as celestial revolutions are motions, albeit eternal\nones, they include some component of potentiality, which is actualised\nin the motion, and hence this potential component is in need of an\nactuality as a mover. This requirement implies that whatever can be\nthe mover of these eternal motions needs to be in actuality without\nany restrictions (Metaphysics\n 12.6).[46]\n Moreover, such an entity has to possess an infinite\n power[47]\n which it communicates to the moved celestial sphere. Hence, this\nentity cannot be divisible and cannot have extension (Physics\n8.10). \n All this testifies to the exceptional status of the first movement,\nand behind it, of the first mover in the universe.  The mover of these\nspheres possesses nothing but actuality, but this actuality is not\nwhat is transmitted in the process of causation.  As we have seen in\nSection 3 above, this would not be exceptional as\nsuch: locomotion need not be caused on the transmission model of\ncausation.  But locomotions caused without immediate transmission of some \nactuality were\nunderstood to be be embedded in larger patterns of causation which\nobserved the principle of causational synonymy, and it is exactly such\na larger pattern of causation which is missing in the case of\ncelestial motions.[48] \nInstead, what we hear in Metaphysics 12.6\nis that the first mover moves as an object of love and\n striving,[49]\n which comes perilously close to abandoning the claims of\nPhysics bk. 8 to the effect that there is an unmoved mover\nserving as the efficient cause of the motions of the cosmos. Such\ndoubts, however, should be dismissed. Aristotle is describing here in\nthe terminology of his physics a supra-physical entity without which\nthe universe could not function or persist.  Small wonder if its mode\nof operation needs to subsume several different dimensions of physical\ncausation.","contact.mail":"stb@elte.hu","contact.domain":"elte.hu"}]
