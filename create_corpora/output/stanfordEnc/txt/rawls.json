His theory of justice as fairness\ndescribes a society of free citizens holding equal basic rights and\ncooperating within an egalitarian economic system. His theory of\npolitical liberalism explores the legitimate use of political\npower in a democracy, and envisions how civic unity might endure\ndespite the diversity of worldviews that free institutions allow. His\nwritings on the law of peoples set out a liberal foreign\npolicy that aims to create a permanently peaceful and tolerant\ninternational order.\n\nRawls was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a\nprominent lawyer, his mother was a chapter president of the League of\nWomen Voters. Rawls studied at Princeton and Cornell, where he was\ninfluenced by Wittgenstein’s student Norman Malcolm; and at\nOxford, where he worked with H. L. A. Hart, Isaiah Berlin, and Stuart\nHampshire. His first professorial appointments were at Cornell and\nMIT. In 1962 Rawls joined the faculty at Harvard, where he taught for\nmore than thirty years. \nRawls’s adult life was a scholarly one: its major events\noccurred within his writings. The exceptions were two wars. As a\ncollege student, Rawls wrote an intensely religious senior thesis\n(BI) and had considered studying for the priesthood. Yet\nRawls lost his Christian faith as an infantryman in World War II on\nseeing the capriciousness of death in combat and learning of the\nhorrors of the Holocaust. Then in the 1960s, Rawls spoke out against\nthe draft for the Vietnam war because it discriminated against black\nand poor Americans. The Vietnam conflict impelled Rawls to analyze the\ndefects in the American political system that led it to prosecute so\nruthlessly what he saw as an unjust war, and to consider how citizens\ncould conscientiously resist their government’s aggressive\npolicies. \nRawls’s most discussed work is his theory of a just liberal\nsociety, called justice as fairness. Rawls first set out\njustice as fairness in systematic detail in his 1971 book, A\nTheory of Justice. Rawls continued to rework justice as fairness\nthroughout his life, restating the theory in Political\nLiberalism (1993), The Law of Peoples (1999), and\nJustice as Fairness (2001). \nThis entry reflects Rawls’s final statement of his views on\njustice as fairness, as well as on political liberalism and on the law\nof peoples. Some recent scholarship on Rawls’s work can be found\nin\n Further Reading\n below. \nRawls sees political philosophy as fulfilling at least four roles in a\nsociety’s public culture. The first role is practical:\nphilosophy can propose grounds for reasoned agreement when sharp\npolitical divisions threaten to lead to violent conflict. Rawls cites\nHobbes’s Leviathan as an attempt to solve the problem\nof order during the English civil war, Locke’s Letter on\nToleration as responding to the Wars of Religion, as well as the\nphilosophy that emerged from the debates over the US Constitution, and\nfrom debates over the extension of slavery before the American civil\nwar. \nA second role of political philosophy is to help citizens to orient\nthemselves within their own social world. Philosophy can meditate on\nwhat it is to be a member of a certain society—in a democracy,\nan equal citizen—and offer a unifying framework for answering\ndivisive questions about how people with that political status should\nrelate to each other. \nA third role is to probe the limits of political possibility.\nPolitical philosophy must describe workable political arrangements\nthat can gain support from real people. Yet within these limits,\nphilosophy can be utopian: it can depict a social order that is the\nbest that we can hope for. Given humans as they are, philosophy\nimagines laws as they might be. \nA fourth role of political philosophy is reconciliation: “to\ncalm our frustration and rage against our society and its history by\nshowing us the way in which its institutions… are rational, and\ndeveloped over time as they did to attain their present, rational\nform” (JF, 3). Philosophy can show that human life is\nnot simply domination and cruelty, prejudice, folly and corruption;\nbut that, at least in some ways, it is better that it has become as it\nis. \nRawls views his own work as a practical contribution to resolving the\nlong-standing tension in democratic thought between liberty and\nequality, and to limning the limits of civic and of international\ntoleration. He offers the members of democratic countries a way of\nunderstanding themselves as free and equal citizens of a society that\nis fair to all, and he describes a hopeful vision of a stably just\nconstitutional democracy doing its part within a peaceful\ninternational community. To individuals who are frustrated that their\nfellow citizens and fellow humans do not see the whole truth as they\ndo, Rawls offers the reconciling thought that this diversity of\nworldviews results from, and can support, a social order with greater\nfreedom for all. \nIn contrast to the utilitarian, for Rawls political philosophy is not\nsimply applied moral philosophy. The utilitarian holds to one\nuniversal moral principle (“maximize utility”), which she\napplies to individual actions, political constitutions, international\nrelations, and all other subjects as required. Rawls has no universal\nprinciple: “The correct regulative principle for\nanything,” he says, “depends on the nature of that\nthing” (TJ, 29). Rawls confines his theorizing to the\npolitical domain, and within this domain he holds that the correct\nprinciples for each sub-domain depend on its particular agents and\nconstraints. \nRawls covers the domain of the political by addressing its sub-domains\nin sequence. The first sub-domain that he addresses is a\nself-contained democratic society reproducing itself across\ngenerations. Once principles are in place for such a society, Rawls\nmoves to a second sub-domain: a society of nations, of which this\ndemocratic society is a member. Rawls suggests (though he does not\nshow) that his sequence of theories could extend to cover further\nsub-domains, such as human interactions with animals. Universal\ncoverage will have been achieved once this sequence is complete, each\nsub-domain having received the principles appropriate to it. \nWithin each sub-domain of the political Rawls also follows a sequence:\nideal theory before non-ideal theory. Ideal theory makes two\ntypes of idealizing assumptions about its subject matter. First, ideal\ntheory assumes that all actors (citizens or societies) are generally\nwilling to comply with whatever principles are chosen. Ideal theory\nthus idealizes away the possibility of law-breaking, either by\nindividuals (crime) or societies (aggressive war). Second, ideal\ntheory assumes reasonably favorable social conditions, wherein\ncitizens and societies are able to abide by principles of political\ncooperation. Citizens are not so driven by hunger, for example, that\ntheir capacity for moral reasoning is overwhelmed; nor are nations\nstruggling to overcome famine or the failure of their states. \nCompleting ideal theory first, Rawls says, yields a systematic\nunderstanding of how to reform our non-ideal world, and fixes a vision\n(mentioned above) of what is the best that can be hoped for. Once\nideal theory is completed for a political sub-domain, non-ideal\ntheory can be set out by reference to the ideal. For instance,\nonce we find ideal principles for citizens who can be productive\nmembers of society over a complete life, we will be better able to\nframe non-ideal principles for providing health care to citizens with\nserious illnesses or disabilities. Similarly, once we understand the\nideal principles of international relations, we will better see how\nthe international community should act toward failed states, as well\nas toward aggressive states that threaten the peace. \nThe aim of political philosophy is to reach justified conclusions\nabout how political life should proceed. For Rawls, how justified one\nis in one’s political convictions depends on how close one is to\nachieving reflective equilibrium. In reflective equilibrium\nall of one’s beliefs, on all levels of generality, cohere\nperfectly with one another. \nThus, in reflective equilibrium one’s specific political\njudgments (e.g., “religious intolerance is unjust,”\n“racial discrimination is unjust”) support one’s\nmore general political convictions (e.g., “all citizens have\ncertain basic rights”) which support one’s very abstract\nbeliefs about the political world (e.g., “all citizens are free\nand equal”). Viewed from the opposite direction, in reflective\nequilibrium one’s abstract beliefs explain one’s more\ngeneral convictions, which in turn explain one’s specific\njudgments. Were one to attain reflective equilibrium, the\njustification of each belief would follow from all beliefs relating in\nthese networks of mutual support and explanation. \nThough perfect reflective equilibrium is unattainable, one can use the\nmethod of reflective equilibrium to get closer to it and so\nincrease the justifiability of one’s beliefs. In carrying\nthrough this method, one begins with one’s considered moral\njudgments: those made consistently and without hesitation when one is\nunder good conditions for thinking (e.g., “slavery is\nwrong,” “all citizens are political equals”). One\ntreats these considered judgments as provisional fixed points, and\nthen starts the process of bringing one’s beliefs into relations\nof mutual support and explanation as described above. Doing this\ninevitably brings out conflicts where, for example, a specific\njudgment clashes with a more general conviction, or where an abstract\nprinciple cannot accommodate a particular kind of case. One proceeds\nby revising these beliefs as necessary, striving always to increase\nthe coherence of the whole. \nCarrying through this process of mutual adjustment brings one closer\nto narrow reflective equilibrium: coherence among one’s\ninitial beliefs. One then adds to this narrow equilibrium one’s\nresponses to the major theories in the history of political\nphilosophy, as well as one’s responses to theories critical of\npolitical philosophizing as such. One continues to adjust one’s\nscheme of beliefs as one reflects on these alternatives, aiming for\nthe end-point of wide reflective equilibrium, in which\ncoherence is maintained after many alternatives have been\nconsidered. \nBecause of its emphasis on coherence, reflective equilibrium is often\ncontrasted with foundationalism as an account of justified belief.\nWithin foundationalist approaches, some subset of beliefs is\nconsidered to be unrevisable, thereby serving as a foundation on which\nall other beliefs are to be based. Reflective equilibrium privileges\nno such subset of beliefs: any belief at any level of generality is\nsubject to revision, if revision will help to bring one’s\nconsidered convictions into greater coherence overall. \nIn working toward greater reflective equilibrium, any type of belief\ncan in principle be relevant to one’s conclusions about how\npolitical institutions should be arranged. Metaphysical beliefs about\nfree will or personal identity might be relevant, as could\nepistemological beliefs about how we come to know what moral facts\nthere are. However, while this is correct in principle, Rawls holds\nthat in practice productive moral and political theorizing will\nproceed to a large extent independent of metaphysics and epistemology.\nIndeed, as a methodological presumption Rawls reverses the traditional\norder of priority. Progress in metaethics will derive from progress in\nsubstantive moral and political theorizing, instead of (as often\nassumed) vice versa (CP, 286–302). \nRawls’s own metaethical theory of the objectivity and validity\nof political judgments, political constructivism, will be described\nbelow, after the substantive political theory from which it\nemerges. \nIn a free society, citizens will have disparate worldviews. They will\nbelieve in different religions or none at all; they will have\ndiffering conceptions of right and wrong; they will disagree on how to\nlive and on what relationships to value. Citizens will have contrary\ncommitments, yet within any country there can only be one law. The law\nmust either establish a national church, or not; women must either\nhave equal rights, or not; abortion and gay marriage must either be\npermissible, or not; the economy must be set up in one way or\nanother. \nRawls holds that the need to impose a unified law on a diverse\ncitizenry raises two fundamental challenges. The first is the\nchallenge of legitimacy: the legitimate use of coercive\npolitical power. How can it be legitimate to coerce all citizens to\nfollow just one law, given that citizens will inevitably hold\ndivergent worldviews? \nThe second challenge is the challenge of stability, which\nlooks at political power from the receiving end. Why would a citizen\nwillingly obey a law that is imposed on her by a collective body whose\nmembers have beliefs and values so different to her own? Yet unless\nmost citizens willingly obey the law, no social order can be stable\nfor long. \nRawls answers these challenges of legitimacy and stability with his\ntheory of political liberalism. Political liberalism is not\nyet Rawls’s theory of justice (justice as fairness). Political\nliberalism answers the conceptually prior questions of legitimacy and\nstability, so fixing the context and starting points for justice as\nfairness. \nIn a democracy, political power is always the power of the people as a\ncollective body. In light of the diversity within a democracy, what\nwould it mean for citizens legitimately to exercise coercive political\npower over one another? Rawls’s test for the acceptable use of\npolitical power in a democracy is his liberal principle of\nlegitimacy: \nAccording to this principle, political power may only be used in ways\nthat all citizens can reasonably be expected to endorse. The use of\npolitical power must fulfill a criterion of reciprocity:\ncitizens must reasonably believe that all citizens can reasonably\naccept the enforcement of a particular set of basic laws. Those\ncoerced by law must be able to endorse the society’s fundamental\npolitical arrangements freely, not because they are dominated or\nmanipulated or kept uninformed. \nThe liberal principle of legitimacy intensifies the challenge of\nlegitimacy: how can any particular set of basic laws legitimately be\nimposed upon a pluralistic citizenry? What constitution could all\ncitizens reasonably be expected to endorse? Rawls’s answer to\nthis challenge begins by explaining what it means for citizens to be\nreasonable. \nReasonable citizens want to live in a society in which they can\ncooperate with their fellow citizens on terms that are acceptable to\nall. They are willing to propose and abide by mutually acceptable\nrules, given the assurance that others will also do so. They will also\nhonor these rules, even when this means sacrificing their own\nparticular interests. Reasonable citizens want, in short, to belong to\na society where political power is legitimately used. \nEach reasonable citizen has her own view about God and life, right and\nwrong, good and bad. Each has, that is, what Rawls calls her own\ncomprehensive doctrine. Yet because reasonable citizens are\nreasonable, they are unwilling to impose their own comprehensive\ndoctrines on others who are also willing to search for mutually\nagreeable rules. Though each citizen may believe that she knows the\ntruth about the best way to live, none is willing to force other\nreasonable citizens to live according to her beliefs, even if she\nbelongs to a majority that has the power to enforce those beliefs on\neveryone. After all, Rawls says mentioning the Inquisition, oppressive\nuse of state power will be necessary to unite a society around any\ncomprehensive doctrine, including the comprehensive liberalism of Kant\nor Mill (PL, 37). \nOne reason that reasonable citizens are so tolerant, Rawls says, is\nthat they accept a certain explanation for the diversity of worldviews\nin their society. Reasonable citizens accept the burdens of\njudgment. The deepest questions of religion, philosophy, and\nmorality are very difficult to think through. Even conscientious\npeople will answer these questions in different ways, because of their\nparticular life experiences (their upbringing, class, occupation, and\nso on). Reasonable citizens understand that these deep issues are ones\non which people of good will can disagree, and so will be unwilling to\nimpose their own worldviews on those who have reached conclusions\ndifferent than their own. \nRawls’s account of the reasonable citizen highlights his view of\nhuman nature. Humans are not irredeemably self-centered, dogmatic, or\ndriven by what Hobbes called, “a perpetual and restless desire\nof power after power” (1651, 58). Humans have at least the\ncapacity for genuine toleration and mutual respect. \nThis human capacity raises the hope that the diversity of worldviews\nin a democratic society may represent not merely pluralism, but\nreasonable pluralism. Rawls hopes, that is, that the\nreligious, moral, and philosophical doctrines that citizens accept\nwill themselves endorse toleration and accept the essentials of a\ndemocratic regime. In the religious sphere, for example, a reasonable\npluralism might contain a reasonable Catholicism, a reasonable\ninterpretation of Islam, a reasonable atheism, and so on. Being\nreasonable, none of these doctrines will advocate the use of coercive\npolitical power to impose religious conformity on citizens with\ndifferent beliefs. \nThe possibility of reasonable pluralism softens but does not solve the\nchallenge of legitimacy: how one law can legitimately be imposed on\ndiverse citizens. For even in a society of reasonable pluralism, it\nwould be unreasonable to expect everyone to endorse, say, a reasonable\nCatholicism as the basis for a constitutional settlement. Reasonable\nMuslims or atheists cannot be expected to endorse Catholicism as\nsetting the basic terms for social life. Nor, of course, can Catholics\nbe expected to accept Islam or atheism as the fundamental basis of\nlaw. No comprehensive doctrine can be accepted by all\nreasonable citizens, and so no comprehensive doctrine can serve as the\nbasis for the legitimate use of coercive political power. \nYet where else then to turn to find the ideas that will define\nsociety’s most basic laws, which all citizens will be required\nto obey? For Rawls, there is only one source of fundamental ideas that\ncan serve as a focal point for all reasonable citizens of a liberal\nsociety. This is the society’s public political\nculture. \nThe public political culture of a democratic society, Rawls says,\n“comprises the political institutions of a constitutional regime\nand the public traditions of their interpretation (including those of\nthe judiciary), as well as historic texts and documents that are\ncommon knowledge” (PL, 13–14). Rawls looks to\nfundamental ideas implicit, for example, in the constitution’s\nlist of individual rights, in the design of the society’s\ngovernment, and in the historic decisions of important courts. These\nfundamental ideas from the public political culture can be crafted\ninto a shared political conception of justice. \nRawls’s solution to the challenge of legitimacy in a liberal\nsociety is for political power to be exercised in accordance with a\npolitical conception of justice. A political conception of\njustice is an interpretation of the fundamental ideas implicit in that\nsociety’s public political culture. \nA political conception is not derived from any particular\ncomprehensive doctrine, nor is it a compromise among the worldviews\nthat happen to exist in society at the moment. Rather, a political\nconception is freestanding: its content is set out independently of\nthe comprehensive doctrines that citizens affirm. Reasonable citizens,\nwho want to cooperate with one another on mutually acceptable terms,\nwill see that a freestanding political conception generated from ideas\nin the public political culture is the only basis for cooperation that\nall citizens can reasonably be expected to endorse. The use of\ncoercive political power guided by the principles of a political\nconception of justice will therefore be legitimate. \nThe three most fundamental ideas that Rawls finds in the public\npolitical culture of a democratic society are that citizens are\nfree and equal, and that society should be a\nfair system of cooperation. All liberal political conceptions\nof justice will therefore be centered on interpretations of these\nthree fundamental ideas. \nBecause there are many reasonable interpretations of\n“free,” “equal” and “fair,” there\nwill be many liberal political conceptions of justice. Since all the\nmembers of this family interpret the same three fundamental ideas,\nhowever, all liberal political conceptions of justice will share\ncertain basic features: \nThese abstract features must, Rawls says, be realized in certain kinds\nof institutions. He mentions several demands that all liberal\nconceptions of justice will make on institutions: a decent\ndistribution of income and wealth; fair opportunities for all\ncitizens, especially in education and training; government as the\nemployer of last resort; basic health care for all citizens; and\npublic financing of elections. \nThe use of political power in a liberal society will be legitimate if\nit is employed in accordance with the principles of any liberal\nconception of justice. By Rawls’s criteria, a libertarian\nconception of justice (such as Nozick’s in Anarchy, State,\nand Utopia) is not a liberal political conception of justice.\nLibertarianism does not assure all citizens sufficient means to make\nuse of their basic liberties, and it permits excessive inequalities of\nwealth and power. By contrast, Rawls’s own conception of justice\n(justice as fairness) does qualify as a member of the family of\nliberal political conceptions of justice.  \nPolitical power is used legitimately in a liberal society when it is\nused in accordance with a political conception of justice. Yet the\nchallenge of stability remains. Legitimacy means that the law may be\nenforced, but Rawls still needs to explain why citizens are willing to\nabide by it. If citizens do not believe that they have reasons to\nabide by the law from within their own perspectives, social order may\ndisintegrate. \nRawls places his hopes for social stability on an overlapping\nconsensus. In an overlapping consensus, citizens all endorse a\ncore set of laws for different reasons. In Rawlsian terms, each\ncitizen supports a political conception of justice for reasons\ninternal to her own comprehensive doctrine. \nRecall that the content of a political conception is freestanding: it\nis specified without reference to any comprehensive doctrine. This\nallows a political conception to be a “module” that can\nfit into any number of worldviews that citizens might have. In an\noverlapping consensus, each reasonable citizen affirms this common\n“module” from within her point of view. \nHere is an example. The quotation below from the second Vatican\nCouncil of the Catholic Church shows how a particular comprehensive\ndoctrine (Catholicism) affirms one component of a liberal political\nconception (a familiar individual liberty) for its own reasons: \nCatholic doctrine here supports the liberal right to religious freedom\nfor reasons internal to Catholicism. A reasonable Islamic doctrine,\nand a reasonable atheistic doctrine, might also affirm this same right\nto religious freedom—not, of course, for the same reasons as\nCatholic doctrine, but each for its own reasons. In an overlapping\nconsensus, all reasonable comprehensive doctrines will support the\nright to religious freedom, each for its own reasons. Indeed, in an\noverlapping consensus, all reasonable comprehensive doctrines will\nendorse all of a political conception of justice, each from within its\nown point of view. \nCitizens within an overlapping consensus work out for themselves how\nthe liberal “module” fits with their own worldviews. Some\ncitizens may see liberalism as derived directly from their deepest\nbeliefs, as in the quotation from Vatican II above. Others may accept\na liberal conception as attractive in itself, but mostly separate from\ntheir other concerns. What is crucial is that all citizens view the\nvalues of a political conception of justice as very great values,\nwhich normally outweigh their other values should these conflict on\nsome particular issue. All citizens, for their own reasons, give the\npolitical conception priority in their reasoning about how their\nsociety’s basic laws should be ordered. \nRawls sees an overlapping consensus as the most desirable form of\nstability in a free society. Stability in an overlapping consensus is\nbetter than a mere balance of power (a modus vivendi) among\ncitizens who hold contending worldviews. After all, power often\nshifts, and when it does the stability of a modus vivendi may\nbe lost. \nIn an overlapping consensus, citizens affirm a political conception\nwholeheartedly from within their own perspectives, and so will\ncontinue to do so even if their group gains or loses political power.\nRawls says that an overlapping consensus is stable for the right\nreasons: each citizen affirms a moral doctrine (a liberal\nconception of justice) for moral reasons (as given by their\ncomprehensive doctrine). Abiding by liberal basic laws is not a\ncitizen’s second-best option in the face of the power of others;\nit is each citizen’s first-best option given her own\nbeliefs. \nRawls does not assert that an overlapping consensus is achievable in\nevery liberal society. Nor does he say that, once established, an\noverlapping consensus must forever endure. Citizens in some societies\nmay have too little in common to converge on a liberal political\nconception of justice. In other societies, unreasonable doctrines may\nspread until they overwhelm liberal institutions. \nRawls does hold that history shows both convergence in beliefs and\ndeepening trust among citizens in many liberal societies. This gives\nhope that an overlapping consensus is at least possible. Where an\noverlapping consensus is possible, Rawls believes, it is the best\nsupport for social stability that a free society can achieve. \nHaving seen how Rawls answers the challenges of legitimacy and\nstability, we can return to legitimacy and its criterion of\nreciprocity: citizens must reasonably believe that all citizens can\nreasonably accept the enforcement of a particular set of basic laws.\nIt is unreasonable for citizens to attempt to impose what they see as\nthe whole truth on others—political power must be used in ways\nthat all citizens may reasonably be expected to endorse. With his\ndoctrine of public reason, Rawls extends this requirement of\nreciprocity to apply directly to how citizens explain their political\ndecisions to one another. In essence, public reason requires citizens\nto be able to justify their political decisions to one another using\npublicly available values and standards. \nTo take a straightforward example: a Supreme Court justice deciding on\na gay marriage law would violate public reason were she to base her\nopinion on God’s forbidding gay sex in the book of Leviticus, or\non a personal spiritual revelation that upholding such a law would\nhasten the end of days. This is because not all members of society can\nreasonably be expected to accept Leviticus as stating an authoritative\nset of political values, nor can a religious premonition be a common\nstandard for evaluating public policy. These values and standards are\nnot public. \nRawls’s doctrine of public reason can be summarized as\nfollows: \nEach of the highlighted terms in this doctrine can be further\nelucidated as follows: \nThe public values that citizens must be able to appeal to are\nthe values of a political conception of justice: those related to the\nfreedom and equality of citizens, and society as a fair system of\ncooperation over time. Among such public values are the freedom of\nreligious practice, the political equality of women and of racial\nminorities, the efficiency of the economy, the preservation of a\nhealthy environment, and the stability of the family (which helps the\norderly reproduction of society from one generation to the next).\nNonpublic values include values internal to associations like churches\n(e.g., that women may not hold the highest offices) or private clubs\n(e.g., that racial minorities can be excluded) which cannot be squared\nwith public values such as these. \nSimilarly, citizens should be able to justify their political\ndecisions by public standards of inquiry. Public standards are\nprinciples of reasoning and rules of evidence that all citizens can\nreasonably endorse. So citizens should not justify their political\ndecisions by appeal to divination, or to complex and disputed economic\nor psychological theories. Rather, publicly acceptable standards are\nthose that rely on common sense, on facts generally known, and on the\nconclusions of science that are well established and not\ncontroversial. \nThe duty to abide by public reason applies when the most\nfundamental political issues are at stake: issues such as who\nhas the right to vote, which religions are to be tolerated, who will\nbe eligible to own property, and what are suspect classifications for\ndiscrimination in hiring decisions. These are what Rawls calls\nconstitutional essentials and matters of basic justice.\nPublic reason applies more weakly, if at all, to less momentous\npolitical questions, for example to most laws that set rates of\ntaxation, or that put aside public money to maintain national\nparks. \nCitizens have a duty to constrain their decisions by public reason\nonly when they engage in certain political activities, usually\nwhen exercising powers of public office. So judges are bound by public\nreason when they issue their rulings, legislators should abide by\npublic reason when speaking and voting in the legislature, and the\nexecutive and candidates for high office should respect public reason\nin their public pronouncements. Significantly, Rawls says that voters\nshould also heed public reason when they vote. All of these activities\nare or support exercises of political power, so (by the liberal\nprinciple of legitimacy) all must be justifiable in terms that all\ncitizens might reasonably endorse. However, citizens are not bound by\nany duties of public reason when they engage in other activities, for\nexample when they worship in church, perform on stage, pursue\nscientific research, send letters to the editor, or talk politics\naround the dinner table. \nThe duty to be able to justify one’s political decisions with\npublic reasons is a moral duty, not a legal duty: it is a duty of\ncivility. All citizens always have their full legal rights to free\nexpression, and overstepping the bounds of public reason is never in\nitself a crime. Rather, citizens have a moral duty of mutual respect\nand civic friendship not to justify their political decisions on\nfundamental issues by appeal to partisan values or controversial\nstandards of reasoning that cannot be publicly redeemed. \nIn an important proviso, Rawls adds that citizens may speak the\nlanguage of their controversial comprehensive doctrines—even as\npublic officials, and even on the most fundamental issues—so\nlong as it can be shown that these assertions appeal to public values.\nSo President Lincoln, for instance, could legitimately use Biblical\nimagery to condemn the evil of slavery, since his condemnations\nappealed to the public values of freedom and equality. Thus even\nwithin its limited range of application, Rawls’s doctrine of\npublic reason is rather permissive concerning what citizens may say\nand do within the bounds of civility. \nJustice as fairness is Rawls’s theory of justice for a liberal\nsociety. As a member of the family of liberal political conceptions of\njustice it provides a framework for the legitimate use of political\npower. Yet legitimacy is only the minimal standard of moral\nacceptability; a political order can be legitimate without being just.\nJustice sets the maximal standard: the arrangement of social\ninstitutions that is morally best. \nRawls constructs justice as fairness around specific interpretations\nof the ideas that citizens are free and equal, and that society should\nbe fair. He sees it as resolving the tensions between the ideas of\nfreedom and equality, which have been highlighted both by the\nsocialist critique of liberal democracy and by the conservative\ncritique of the modern welfare state. Rawls also argues that justice\nas fairness is superior to the dominant tradition in modern political\nthought: utilitarianism. \nIn Rawls’s egalitarian liberalism, citizens relate to each other\nas equals within a social order defined by reciprocity, instead of\nwithin the unjust status hierarchies familiar from today. \nSignificant political and economic inequalities are often associated\nwith inequalities of social status that encourage those of lower\nstatus to be viewed both by themselves and by others as inferior. This\nmay arouse widespread attitudes of deference and servility, on one\nside, and a will to dominate and arrogance on the other. These effects\nof social and economic inequalities can be serious evils and the\nattitudes they engender great vices... Fixed status ascribed by birth,\nor by gender or race, is particularly odious (JF, 131). \nJustice as fairness aims to describe a just arrangement of the major\npolitical and social institutions of a liberal society: the political\nconstitution, the legal system, the economy, the family, and so on.\nRawls calls the arrangement of these institutions a society’s\nbasic structure. The basic structure is the location of\njustice because these institutions distribute the main benefits and\nburdens of social life: who will receive social recognition, who will\nhave which basic rights, who will have opportunities to get what kind\nof work, what the distribution of income and wealth will be, and so\non. \nThe form of a society’s basic structure will have profound\neffects on the lives of citizens. The basic structure will influence\nnot only citizens’ life prospects, but more deeply their goals,\ntheir attitudes, their relationships, and their characters.\nInstitutions that will have such pervasive influence on people’s\nlives require justification. Since leaving one’s society is not\na realistic option for most people, the justification cannot be that\ncitizens have consented to a basic structure by staying in the\ncountry. And since the rules of any basic structure will be coercively\nenforced, often with serious penalties, the demand to justify the\nimposition of any particular set of rules intensifies further. \nIn setting out justice as fairness, Rawls assumes that the liberal\nsociety in question is marked by reasonable pluralism as described\nabove, and also that it is under reasonably favorable conditions: that\nthere are enough resources for it to be possible for everyone’s\nbasic needs to be met. Rawls makes the simplifying assumption that the\nsociety is self-sufficient and closed, so that citizens enter it only\nby birth and leave it only at death. He also confines his attention\nmainly to ideal theory, putting aside non-ideal theory such as on\ncriminal justice. \nSocial cooperation in some form is necessary for citizens to be able\nto lead decent lives. Yet citizens are not indifferent to how the\nbenefits and burdens of cooperation will be divided amongst them.\nRawls’s principles of justice as fairness articulate the central\nliberal ideas that cooperation should be fair to all citizens regarded\nas free and as equals. The distinctive interpretation that Rawls gives\nto these concepts can be seen as combining a negative and a positive\nthesis. \nRawls’s negative thesis starts with the idea that citizens do\nnot deserve to be born into a rich or a poor family, to be born\nnaturally more or less gifted than others, to be born female or male,\nto be born a member of a particular racial group, and so on. Since\nthese features of persons are morally arbitrary in this sense,\ncitizens are not entitled to more of the benefits of social\ncooperation simply because of them. For example, the fact that a\ncitizen was born rich, white, and male provides no reason in itself\nfor this citizen to be favored by social institutions. \nThis negative thesis does not say how social goods should be\ndistributed; it merely clears the decks. Rawls’s positive\ndistributive thesis is equality-based reciprocity. All social goods\nare to be distributed equally, unless an unequal distribution would be\nto everyone’s advantage. The guiding idea is that since citizens\nare fundamentally equal, reasoning about justice should begin from a\npresumption that cooperatively-produced goods should be equally\ndivided. Justice then requires that any inequalities must benefit all\ncitizens, and particularly must benefit those who will have the least.\nEquality sets the baseline; from there any inequalities must improve\neveryone’s situation, and especially the situation of the\nworst-off. These strong requirements of equality and reciprocal\nadvantage are hallmarks of Rawls’s theory of justice. \nThese guiding ideas of justice as fairness are given institutional\nform by its two principles of justice: \nFirst Principle: Each person has the same\nindefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic\nliberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of\nliberties for all; \nSecond Principle: Social and economic inequalities\nare to satisfy two conditions: \nThe first principle of equal basic liberties is to be embodied in the\npolitical constitution, while the second principle applies primarily\nto laws governing economic institutions. Fulfillment of the first\nprinciple takes priority over fulfillment of the second principle, and\nwithin the second principle fair equality of opportunity takes\npriority over the difference principle. \nThe first principle affirms that all citizens should have the familiar\nbasic rights and liberties: liberty of conscience and freedom of\nassociation, freedom of speech and liberty of the person, the rights\nto vote, to hold public office, to be treated in accordance with the\nrule of law, and so on. The first principle accords these rights and\nliberties to all citizens equally. Unequal rights would not benefit\nthose who would get a lesser share of the rights, so justice requires\nequal rights for all, in all normal circumstances. \nRawls’s first principle confirms widespread convictions about\nthe importance of equal basic rights and liberties. Two further\nfeatures make this principle distinctive. First is its priority: the\nbasic rights and liberties must not be traded off against other social\ngoods. The first principle disallows, for instance, a policy that\nwould give draft exemptions to college students on the grounds that\neducated civilians will increase economic productivity. The draft is a\ndrastic infringement on basic liberties, and if a draft is implemented\nthen all who are able to serve must be equally subject to it, even if\nthis means slower growth. Citizens’ equal liberty must have\npriority over economic policy. \nThe second distinctive feature of Rawls’s first principle is\nthat it requires fair value of the political liberties. The\npolitical liberties are a subset of the basic liberties, concerned\nwith the right to hold public office, the right to affect the outcome\nof national elections and so on. For these liberties, Rawls requires\nthat citizens should be not only formally but also substantively\nequal. That is, citizens who are similarly endowed and motivated\nshould have similar opportunities to hold office, to influence\nelections, and so on regardless of how rich or poor they are. This\nrequirement of the fair value of the political liberties has major\nimplications for how elections should be funded and run, as will be\ndiscussed below. \nRawls’s second principle of justice has two parts. The first\npart, fair equality of opportunity, requires that citizens with the\nsame talents and willingness to use them have the same educational and\neconomic opportunities regardless of whether they were born rich or\npoor. “In all parts of society there are to be roughly the same\nprospects of culture and achievement for those similarly motivated and\nendowed” (JF, p. 44). \nSo, for example, if we assume that natural endowments and the\nwillingness to use them are evenly distributed across children born\ninto different social classes, then within any type of occupation\n(generally specified) we should find that roughly one quarter of\npeople in that occupation were born into the top 25% of the income\ndistribution, one quarter were born into the second-highest 25% of the\nincome distribution, one quarter were born into the second-lowest 25%,\nand one-quarter were born into the lowest 25%. Since class of origin\nis a morally arbitrary fact about citizens, justice does not allow\nclass of origin to turn into unequal opportunities for education or\nmeaningful work. \nThe second part of the second principle is the difference principle,\nwhich regulates the distribution of wealth and income. Allowing\ninequalities of wealth and income can lead to a larger social product:\nhigher wages can cover the costs of training and education, for\nexample, and can provide incentives to fill jobs that are more in\ndemand. The difference principle allows inequalities of wealth and\nincome, so long as these will be to everyone’s advantage, and\nspecifically to the advantage of those who will be worst off. The\ndifference principle requires, that is, that any economic inequalities\nbe to the greatest advantage of those who are advantaged least. \nTo illustrate, consider four hypothetical economic structures\nA–D, and the lifetime-average levels of income that these\ndifferent economic structures would yield for representative members\nof three groups: \nHere the difference principle selects Economy C, because it contains\nthe distribution where the least-advantaged group does best.\nInequalities in C are to everyone’s advantage relative to a\ncompletely equal distribution (Economy A), and relative to a more\nequal distribution (Economy B). But the difference principle does not\nallow the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor (Economy D).\nThe difference principle embodies equality-based reciprocity: from an\negalitarian baseline, it requires that any inequalities are good for\nall, and especially for the worst-off. \nThe difference principle is partly based on the negative thesis that\nthe distribution of natural assets is undeserved. A citizen does not\nmerit more of the social product simply because she was lucky enough\nto be born with the potential to develop skills that are currently in\nhigh demand. Yet this does not mean that everyone must get the same\nshares. The fact that citizens have different talents and abilities\ncan be used to make everyone better off. In a society governed by the\ndifference principle, citizens regard the distribution of natural\nendowments as a common asset that can benefit all. Those better\nendowed are welcome to use their gifts to make themselves better off,\nso long as their doing so also contributes to the good of those less\nwell endowed. \nThe difference principle thus expresses a positive ideal, an ideal of\nsocial unity. In a society that satisfies the difference principle,\ncitizens know that their economy works to everyone’s benefit,\nand that those who were lucky enough to be born with greater natural\npotential are not getting richer at the expense of those who were less\nfortunate. One might contrast Rawls’s positive ideal to\nNozick’s ideal of libertarian freedom, or to meritocratic ideas\nabout economic justice that are dominant within many democracies.\n“In justice as fairness,” Rawls says, “men agree to\nshare one another’s fate” (TJ, 102). \nHaving surveyed Rawls’s two principles of justice as fairness,\nwe can return to Rawls’s interpretations of the liberal ideas\nthat citizens are free and equal, and that society should be fair.\nRawls uses these conceptions of citizens and society to construct the\nofficial justification for the two principles: the argument from the\noriginal position. \nRawls’s interpretation of the idea that citizens are free is as\nfollows. Citizens are free in that each sees herself as being entitled\nto make claims on social institutions in her own right—citizens\nare not slaves or serfs, dependent for their social status on others.\nCitizens are also free in that they see their public identities as\nindependent of any particular comprehensive doctrine: a citizen who\nconverts to Islam, or who recants her faith, will expect, for example,\nto retain all her political rights and liberties throughout the\ntransition. Finally, citizens are free in being able to take\nresponsibility for planning their own lives, given the opportunities\nand resources that they can reasonably expect. \nCitizens are equal, Rawls says, in virtue of having the capacities to\nparticipate in social cooperation over a complete life. Citizens may\nhave greater or lesser skills, talents, and powers “above the\nline” that cooperation requires, but differences above this line\nhave no bearing on citizens’ equal political status. \nRawlsian citizens are not only free and equal, they are also\nreasonable and rational. The idea that citizens are reasonable is\nfamiliar from political liberalism. Reasonable citizens have the\ncapacity to abide by fair terms of cooperation, even at the expense of\ntheir own interests, provided that others are also willing to do so.\nIn justice as fairness, Rawls calls this reasonableness the capacity\nfor a sense of justice. Citizens are also rational: they have\nthe capacity to pursue and revise their own view of what is valuable\nin human life. Rawls calls this the capacity for a conception of\nthe good. Together these capacities are called the two moral\npowers. \nLike every theory of justice (for example those of Locke, Rousseau,\nand Mill), justice as fairness requires an account of citizens’\nfundamental interests: what citizens need qua citizens. Rawls\nderives his account of primary goods from the conception of\nthe citizen as free and equal, reasonable and rational. Primary goods\nare essential for developing and exercising the two moral powers, and\nare useful for pursuing a wide range of specific conceptions of the\ngood life. Primary goods are these: \nAll citizens are assumed to have fundamental interests in getting more\nof these primary goods, and political institutions are to evaluate how\nwell citizens are doing according to what primary goods they have. It\nis equalities and inequalities of these primary goods that, Rawls\nclaims, are of the greatest political significance. \nRawls’s conception of society is defined by fairness: social\ninstitutions are to be fair to all cooperating members of society,\nregardless of their race, gender, religion, class of origin, natural\ntalents, reasonable conception of the good life, and so on. \nRawls also emphasizes publicity as an aspect of fairness. In\nwhat he calls a well-ordered society all citizens accept the\nprinciples of justice and know that their fellow citizens also do so,\nand all citizens recognize that the basic structure is just. The full\nphilosophical justifications for the principles of justice are also\nknowable by and acceptable to all reasonable citizens. \nThe idea behind publicity is that since the principles for the basic\nstructure will be coercively enforced on free citizens, they should\nstand up to public scrutiny. The publicity condition requires that a\nsociety’s operative principles of justice not be too esoteric,\nand not be screens for deeper power relations. Fairness requires that,\nin “public political life, nothing need be hidden... there is no\nneed for the illusions and delusions of ideology for society to work\nproperly and for citizens to accept it willingly” (PL,\n68–69). \nRawls’s conceptions of citizens and society are still quite\nabstract, and some might think innocuous. The original\nposition aims to move from these abstract conceptions to\ndeterminate principles of social justice. It does so by translating\nthe question: “What are fair terms of social cooperation for\nfree and equal citizens?” into the question “What terms of\ncooperation would free and equal citizens agree to under fair\nconditions?” The move to agreement among citizens is what places\nRawls’s justice as fairness within the social contract tradition\nof Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. \nThe strategy of the original position is to construct a method of\nreasoning that models abstract ideas about justice so as to focus\ntheir power together onto the choice of principles. So Rawls’s\nconceptions of citizens and of society are built into the design of\nthe original position itself. Rawls’s intent is that readers\nwill see the outcome of the original position as justified because\nthey will see how it embodies plausible understandings of citizens and\nsociety, and also because this outcome confirms many of their\nconsidered convictions about justice on specific issues. \nThe original position is a thought experiment: an imaginary situation\nin which each real citizen has a representative, and all of these\nrepresentatives come to an agreement on which principles of justice\nshould order the political institutions of the real citizens. This\nthought experiment is better than trying to get all real citizens\nactually to assemble in person to try to agree to principles of\njustice for their society. Even if that were possible, the bargaining\namong real citizens would be influenced by all sorts of factors\nirrelevant to justice, such as who could threaten the others most, or\nwho could hold out for longest. \nThe original position abstracts from all such irrelevant factors. The\noriginal position is a fair situation in which each citizen is\nrepresented as only a free and equal citizen: each representative\nwants only what free and equal citizens want, and each tries to agree\nto principles for the basic structure while situated fairly with\nrespect to the other representatives. The design of the original\nposition thus models the ideas of freedom, equality, and fairness. For\nexample, fairness and equality are modeled in the original position by\nthe symmetrical situation of the parties: no citizen’s\nrepresentative is able to threaten any other citizen’s\nrepresentative, or to hold out longer for a better deal. \nThe most striking feature of the original position is the veil of\nignorance, which prevents arbitrary facts about citizens from\ninfluencing the agreement among their representatives. As we have\nseen, Rawls holds that the fact that a citizen is of a certain race,\nclass, and gender is no reason for social institutions to favor or\ndisfavor her. Each representative in the original position is\ntherefore deprived of knowledge of the race, class, and gender of the\nreal citizen that they represent. In fact, the veil of ignorance\ndeprives the parties of all facts about citizens that are irrelevant\nto the choice of principles of justice: not only facts about their\nrace, class, and gender but also facts about their age, natural\nendowments, and more. Moreover the veil of ignorance also screens out\nspecific information about what society is like right now, so as to\nget a clearer view of the permanent features of a just social\nsystem. \nBehind the veil of ignorance, the informational situation of the\nparties that represent real citizens is as follows: \nThe veil of ignorance situates the representatives of free and equal\ncitizens fairly with respect to one another. No party can press for\nagreement on principles that will arbitrarily favor the particular\ncitizen they represent, because no party knows the specific attributes\nof the citizen they represent. The situation of the parties thus\nembodies reasonable conditions, within which the parties can make a\nrational agreement. Each party tries to agree to principles that will\nbe best for the citizen they represent (i.e., that will maximize that\ncitizen’s share of primary goods). Since the parties are fairly\nsituated, the agreement they reach will be fair to all actual\ncitizens. \nThe design of the original position also models other aspects of\nRawls’s conceptions of citizens and society. For example, the\npublicity of a well-ordered society is modeled by the fact that the\nparties must choose among principles that can be publicly endorsed by\nall citizens. There are also some assumptions that make the\nhypothetical agreement determinate and decisive: the parties are not\nmotivated by envy (i.e., by how much citizens besides their own end up\nwith); the parties are neither risk-seeking nor risk-averse; and the\nparties must make a final agreement on principles for the basic\nstructure: there are no “do-overs” after the veil of\nignorance is lifted and the parties learn which real citizen they\nrepresent. \nThe argument from the original position has two parts. In the first\npart, the parties agree to principles of justice. In the second part,\nthe parties check that a society ordered by these principles could be\nstable over time. Rawls only attempts to show that his two principles\nof justice as fairness would be favored over utilitarian principles,\nsince he sees utilitarianism as the main competing tradition of\nreasoning about justice. The parties are thus presented with a choice\nbetween Rawls’s two principles and utilitarian principles, and\nasked which principles they would prefer to agree to. \nThe first part of the original position contains two fundamental\ncomparisons between Rawls’s principles and utilitarian\nprinciples. In the first comparison, the parties compare Rawls’s\nprinciples to the principle of average utility: the principle\nthat the basic structure should be arranged so as to produce the\nhighest level of utility averaged among all citizens. Rawls argues\nthat the parties would favor his principles in this comparison,\nbecause the first principle of justice as fairness secures equal\nliberties for all citizens. \nIn this first comparison, Rawls argues that it is rational for the\nparties to use maximin reasoning: to maximize the minimum\nlevel of primary goods that the citizens they represent might find\nthemselves with. And maximin reasoning, he says, favors justice as\nfairness. \nUnder average utilitarianism, Rawls argues, the basic liberties of\nsome citizens might be restricted for the sake of greater benefits to\nother citizens. For example, restricting the political and religious\nliberties of a weak minority might work to the benefit of the\nmajority, and so produce a higher average level of utility in the\nsociety. A party in the original position will find the possibility\nthat their citizen might be denied political and religious liberties\nintolerable, given that the party could instead secure equal liberties\nfor their citizen by choosing justice as fairness. A party will not be\nwilling to gamble with the political standing and deepest commitments\nof the citizen they represent, Rawls says, when they could safeguard\nthe standing and commitments of their citizen even if their citizen\nturns out to be in a weak minority. \nMoreover, Rawls says, a society ordered by the principles of justice\nas fairness has other advantages over a utilitarian society. Securing\nequal basic liberties for all encourages a spirit of cooperation among\ncitizens on a basis of mutual respect, and takes divisive conflicts\nabout whether to deny liberties to some citizens off of the political\nagenda. By contrast, a utilitarian society would be riven by mutual\nsuspicions, as different groups put forward highly speculative\narguments that average utility could be increased by implementing\ntheir partisan policies. Rawls’s first principle, by securing\npermanent equal liberties for all citizens, increases social harmony\nby making it easier for justice to be seen to be done. The balance of\nconsiderations in favor of justice as fairness over average utility\nhere is, Rawls claims, decisive. \nIn the second fundamental comparison, the parties are offered a choice\nbetween justice as fairness and the principle of restricted\nutility. The principle of restricted utility is identical to\nRawls’s two principles, except that the difference principle is\nreplaced with a principle which says that the distribution of wealth\nand income should maximize average utility, constrained by a\nguaranteed minimum level of income for all. While the first comparison\nturned on the importance of the basic liberties, the second comparison\ncontains Rawls’s formal argument for the difference\nprinciple. \nMaximin reasoning plays no role in the argument for the difference\nprinciple. Nor does aversion to uncertainty (JF, xvii, 43,\n95, 96). \nIn this second comparison, Rawls argues that the parties will favor\njustice as fairness because its principles provide a better basis for\nenduring cooperation among all citizens. The difference principle, he\nsays, asks less of the better-off than restricted utility asks of the\nworst-off. Under the difference principle, he says, those who are\nbetter endowed are permitted to gain more wealth and income, on the\ncondition that their doing so also benefits their fellow citizens.\nUnder restricted utility, by contrast, those living at the minimum\nwill suspect that their interests have been sacrificed to make the\nbetter-off better off still. These citizens at the minimum may become\ncynical about their society, and withdraw from active participation in\npublic life. \nMoreover, it is again difficult to maintain a public agreement as to\nwhich economic policies actually will maximize average utility, and\ndebates over where to set the guaranteed minimum may lead to mistrust\namong social classes. The difference principle instead encourages\nmutual trust and the cooperative virtues by instantiating an ideal of\neconomic reciprocity. Each party will see the advantages for the\ncitizen they represent of securing the more harmonious social world of\njustice as fairness. \nHaving selected the two principles of justice as fairness, the parties\nturn to the second part of the original position: the check that these\nprinciples can order a society stably over time. The parties check,\nthat is, whether those who grow up under institutions arranged by\nthese principles will develop sufficient willingness to abide by them\nthat the principles can serve as the focus of an enduring overlapping\nconsensus. \nRawls argues that the parties will see that his two principles are\ncongruent with each citizen’s good. Under the two principles,\nthe society’s basic institutions affirm the freedom and equality\nof each citizen, giving a public basis for each citizen’s\nself-respect. This public basis of self-respect is vital for citizens\nto be able to pursue their life plans with energy and confidence.\nCitizens will also see that the basic liberties allow sufficient\nsocial space for them to pursue their reasonable conceptions of the\ngood. Whether poor or rich, citizens will tend not to be envious or\nimperious, as they will see how the economy works toward the\nreciprocal advantage of all. And citizens may be satisfied by\nreflecting on the collective good that they can achieve with each\nother, by working together to maintain just institutions over\ntime. \nGiven that the two principles are congruent with citizens’ good,\nRawls argues that it is reasonable to suppose that citizens will\ndevelop a desire to act in accordance with them. People become\nattached to people and institutions that they see benefiting them, and\nthe two principles create a social world in which each citizen can\npursue her own ends on a basis of mutual respect with other citizens.\nSince this is experienced as a good, the principles will gain\ncitizens’ willing and stable allegiance. “The most stable\nconception of justice,” Rawls says, “is one that is\nperspicuous to our reason, congruent with our good, and rooted not in\nabnegation but in affirmation of the self” (TJ,\n261). \nThe two parts of the argument for justice as fairness above occur at\nthe first stage of the original position. At this first stage, the\nparties also agree to a principle of just savings to regulate\nhow much each generation must save for future generations. Since the\nparties do not know which era the citizens they represent live in, it\nis rational for them to choose a savings principle that is fair to all\ngenerations. Rawls says that the parties need not choose a savings\nprinciple that requires endless economic growth. Rather, the parties\nmay prefer a Millian “steady state” of zero real growth,\nonce a generation has been reached in which the two principles are\nsatisfied. \nAfter agreeing on the two principles and a principle of just savings,\nthe parties then proceed further through the four-stage\nsequence, tailoring these general principles to the particular\nconditions of the society of the citizens they represent. Through this\nfour-stage sequence, the veil of ignorance that screens out\ninformation about society’s general features gradually becomes\nthinner, and the parties use the new information to decide on\nprogressively more determinate applications of the principles already\nagreed upon. The parties, that is, progressively fill in the\ninstitutional details of what justice requires in the real world. \nAt the second stage of the original position, the parties are given\nmore information about society’s political culture and economic\ndevelopment, and take on the task of crafting a constitution\nthat realizes the two principles of justice. At the third stage, the\nparties learn still more about the details of society, and agree to\nspecific legislation that realize the two principles within\nthe constitutional framework decided at the second stage. At the\nfourth stage, the parties have full information about society, and\nreason as judges and administrators to apply the\npreviously-agreed legislation to particular cases. When the four\nstages are complete, the principles of justice as fairness are fully\narticulated for society’s political life. \nTo illustrate: at the constitutional (second) and legislative (third)\nstages, the parties specify basic liberties such as “freedom of\nthought” into more particular rights, like the right to free\npolitical speech. The right to political speech is itself then further\nspecified as the right to criticize the government, the rights\nprotecting the press from political interference, and so on. Through\nthe four-stage sequence, the parties also adjust the basic liberties\nto fit with one another and with other values, always aiming for an\noverall scheme of liberties that will best enable citizens to develop\nand exercise their two moral powers and pursue their determinate\nconceptions of the good (PL, 289–371). \nAt the later stages, the parties also work out the institutions that\nwill be necessary to realize the fair value of the equal political\nliberties. On this topic, Rawls is adamant: unless there are public\nfunds for elections, restrictions on campaign contributions, and\nsubstantially equal access to the media, politics will be captured by\nconcentrations of private economic power. This will make it impossible\nfor equally-able citizens to have equal opportunities to influence\npolitics regardless of their wealth, as fair value demands. As he says\nin a discussion of public reason, public deliberation must be\n“set free from the curse of money” (PL, 449). \nThe parties attempt to realize the second principle of justice at the\nlegislative stage, by shaping the laws that regulate property,\ncontract, taxation, inheritance, hiring, minimum wages, and so on.\nTheir task is not to allocate some fixed set of goods that appear from\nnowhere, but rather to devise a set of institutions for education,\nproduction, and distribution whose operation will realize fair\nequality of opportunity and the difference principle over time. \nFor fair equality of opportunity, Rawls emphasizes that laws and\npolicies must go beyond merely preventing discrimination in education\nand hiring. To ensure fair opportunity regardless of social class of\norigin, the state must also fund high-quality education for the less\nwell-off. Moreover, the state must also guarantee both a basic minimum\nincome and health care for all. \nOn realizing the difference principle, Rawls says that the goal is an\neconomic order that maximizes the position of the worst-off group\n(e.g., unskilled laborers, or those with less than half of the median\nwealth and income over their lifetimes). Given that institutions\nrealizing the prior principles are already in place, this should be\napproximately achievable by, for example, varying marginal rates of\ntax and tax exemptions. \nRawls explicitly rejects the welfare state (JF,\n137–40). Welfare-state capitalism leaves control of the economy\nin the hands of a group of rich private actors. It therefore fails to\nensure for all citizens enough resources to have roughly equal chances\nof influencing politics, or to have sufficiently equal opportunities\nin education and employment. The welfare state therefore tends to\ngenerate a demoralized under-class. \nLaissez-faire capitalism is even worse for equality than the welfare\nstate along these dimensions. And a socialist command economy would\nput too much power in the hands of the state, again endangering\npolitical equality and also threatening basic liberties such as free\nchoice of employment. \nJustice as fairness, Rawls says, favors either a property-owning\ndemocracy or liberal (democratic) socialism. The government of a\nproperty-owning democracy takes steps to encourage widespread\nownership of productive assets and broad access to education and\ntraining. Liberal socialism is similar, but features worker-managed\nfirms. The aim of both systems of political economy is to enable all\ncitizens, even the least advantaged, to manage their own affairs\nwithin a context of significant social and economic equality.\n“The least advantaged are not, if all goes well, the unfortunate\nand unlucky—objects of our charity and compassion, much less our\npity—but those to whom reciprocity is owed as a matter of basic\njustice” (JF, 139). \nRawls describes the original position as a useful device for reaching\ngreater reflective equilibrium. He holds that the value of the\noriginal position as a method of reasoning is affirmed when it selects\nthe first principle of justice, since the first principle accords with\nmany people’s settled convictions about the importance of\nassuring the basic rights and liberties for all. Having gained\ncredibility by confirming these settled moral judgments, the original\nposition then goes on to select principles for issues on which\npeople’s judgments may be less certain, such as how society\nshould structure employment opportunities, and what a just\ndistribution of wealth and income might be. \nIn this way, the original position first confirms and then extends\ncommon judgments about justice. For Rawls it is important that the\nsame method of reasoning that explains the equal basic liberties also\njustifies more political and economic equality than many people might\nhave initially expected. The momentum of the argument for the first\nprinciple carries through to the argument for the second principle.\nThose who believe in equal basic liberties, but who reject the other\negalitarian features of justice as fairness, must try to find some\nother route to justifying those basic liberties. \nThe original position is also the crux of Rawls’s metaethical\ntheory, political constructivism. Political constructivism is\nRawls’s account of the objectivity and validity of political\njudgments. \nThe original position embodies, Rawls says, all of the relevant\nconceptions of person and society, and principles of practical\nreasoning, for making judgments about justice. When there is an\noverlapping consensus focused on justice as fairness, the original\nposition specifies a shared public perspective from which all citizens\ncan reason about the principles of justice and their application to\ntheir society’s institutions. Judgments made from this\nperspective are then objectively correct, in the sense of giving\nreasons to citizens to act regardless of their actual motivations, or\nthe reasons they think they have within their particular points of\nview. \nPolitical constructivism does not maintain that the original position\nshows that the principles of justice as fairness are true. Questions\nof truth are ones about which reasonable citizens may disagree, and\nare to be addressed by each citizen from within her own comprehensive\ndoctrine. Judgments made from the original position are, however,\nvalid, or as Rawls says, reasonable. \nWith the theories of legitimacy and justice for a self-contained\nliberal society completed, Rawls then extends his approach to\ninternational relations with the next in his sequence of theories: the\nlaw of peoples. \nRawls assumes that no tolerable world state could be stable. He cites\nKant in asserting that a world government would either be a global\ndespotism or beleaguered by groups fighting to gain their political\nindependence. So the law of peoples will be international, not\ncosmopolitan: it will be a foreign policy that guides a liberal\nsociety in its interactions with other societies, both liberal and\nnon-liberal. \nRawls describes the main ideas motivating his law of peoples as\nfollows: \nThe most important feature of the “realistic utopia” that\nRawls envisages in The Law of Peoples is that the great evils\nof human history no longer occur. The most important condition for\nthis realistic utopia to come about is that all societies are\ninternally well-ordered: that all have just, or at least decent,\ndomestic political institutions. \nMuch of Rawls’s presentation of the law of peoples parallels the\npresentations of political liberalism and justice as fairness. As a\nliberal society has a basic structure of institutions so, Rawls says,\nthere is an international basic structure (LP, 33, 62, 114,\n115, 122, 123). While Rawls does not say that the international basic\nstructure has a pervasive impact on the life chances of individuals,\nthe rules of this basic structure are coercively enforced (for\nexample, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was coercively\nreversed by a coalition of other countries). The principles that\nshould regulate this international basic structure thus require\njustification. The justification of these principles must accommodate\nthe fact that there is even more pluralism in worldviews among\ncontemporary societies than there is within a single liberal\nsociety. \nRawls puts forward eight principles for ordering the international\nbasic structure: \nAll of these principles, with the exception of the last one, are\nfamiliar from contemporary international law (though Rawls’s\nlist of human rights for principles 4 and 6 is shorter than the list\nin international law). Rawls also leaves room for his law of peoples\nto accommodate various organizations that may help societies to\nincrease their political and economic coordination, such as idealized\nversions of a United Nations, a World Trade Organization, and a World\nBank. \nThe actors in Rawls’s international theory are not individuals\n(citizens) but societies (peoples). A people is a group of\nindividuals ruled by a common government, bound together by common\nsympathies, and firmly attached to a common conception of right and\njustice. “People” is a moralized concept, and not all\nstates currently on the world map qualify as such. \nRawls’s conception of peoples within the law of peoples\nparallels his conception of citizens within justice as fairness.\nPeoples see themselves as free in the sense of being rightfully\npolitically independent; and as equal in regarding themselves as\nequally deserving of recognition and respect. Peoples are reasonable\nin that they will honor fair terms of cooperation with other peoples,\neven at cost to their own interests, given that other peoples will\nalso honor those terms. Reasonable peoples are thus unwilling to try\nto impose their political or social ideals on other reasonable\npeoples. They satisfy the criterion of reciprocity with respect to one\nanother. \nRawls describes the fundamental interests of a people as follows: \nRawls contrasts peoples with states. A state, Rawls says, is\nmoved by the desires to enlarge its territory, or to convert other\nsocieties to its religion, or to enjoy the power of ruling over\nothers, or to increase its relative economic strength. Peoples are not\nstates, and as we will see peoples may treat societies that act like\nstates as international outlaws. \nPeoples are of two types, depending on the nature of their domestic\npolitical institutions. Liberal peoples satisfy the\nrequirements of political liberalism: they have legitimate liberal\nconstitutions, and they have governments that are under popular\ncontrol and not driven by large concentration of private economic\npower. \nDecent peoples are not internally just from a liberal\nperspective. Their basic institutions do not recognize reasonable\npluralism or embody any interpretation of the liberal ideas of free\nand equal citizens cooperating fairly. The institutions of a decent\nsociety may be organized around a single comprehensive doctrine, such\nas a dominant religion. The political system may not be democratic,\nand women or members of minority religions may be excluded from public\noffice. Nevertheless, decent peoples are well-ordered enough, Rawls\nsays, to merit equal membership in international society. \nLike all peoples, decent peoples do not have aggressive foreign\npolicies. Beyond this, Rawls describes one type of decent\nsociety—a decent hierarchical society—to\nillustrate what decency requires. \nA decent hierarchical society’s basic structure specifies a\ndecent system of social cooperation. First, it secures a core list of\nhuman rights. Second, its political system takes the\nfundamental interests of all persons into account through a decent\nconsultation hierarchy. This means that the government genuinely\nconsults with the representatives of all social groups, which together\nrepresent all persons in the society, and that the government\njustifies its laws and policies to these groups. The government does\nnot close down protests, and responds to any protests with\nconscientious replies. The government also supports the right of\ncitizens to emigrate. \nRawls imagines a decent hierarchical society that he calls\n“Kazanistan.” In Kazanistan, Islam is the favored\nreligion, and only Muslims can hold the high office. However\nnon-Muslim religions may be practiced without fear, and believers in\nthem are encouraged to take part in the civic culture of the wider\nsociety. Minorities are not subject to arbitrary discrimination by\nlaw, or treated as inferior by Muslims. Kazanistan would qualify,\nRawls says, as a decent, well-ordered member of the society of\npeoples, entitled to respectful toleration and equal treatment by\nother peoples. \nLiberal peoples tolerate decent peoples, and indeed treat them as\nequals. Not to do so, Rawls says, would be to fail to express\nsufficient respect for acceptable ways of ordering a society. Liberal\npeoples should recognize the good of national self-determination, and\nlet decent societies decide their futures for themselves. The\ngovernment of a liberal people should not criticize decent peoples for\nfailing to be liberal, or set up incentives for them to become more\nso. Criticism and inducements may cause bitterness and resentment\nwithin decent peoples, and so be counter-productive. \nIndeed public reason imposes duties of civility upon the members of\ninternational society, just as it does upon members of a liberal\nsociety. Government officials and candidates for high office should\nexplain their foreign policy positions to other peoples in terms of\nthe principles and values of the law of peoples, and should avoid\nreliance on contentious parochial reasons that all peoples cannot\nreasonably share. \nOne major reason that liberal peoples tolerate decent peoples, Rawls\nsays, is that decent peoples secure for all persons within their\nterritory a core list of human rights. These core human rights include\nrights to subsistence, security, personal property, and formal\nequality before the law, as well as freedoms from slavery, protections\nof ethnic groups against genocide, and some measure of liberty of\nconscience (but not, as we have seen, a right to democratic\nparticipation). These core human rights are the minimal conditions\nrequired for persons to be able to engage in social cooperation in any\nreal sense, so any well-ordered society must protect them. \nThe role of human rights in the law of peoples is thus to set limits\non international toleration. Any society that guarantees Rawls’s\nlist of human rights is to be immune from coercive intervention from\nother peoples. Societies that violate human rights overstep the limits\nof toleration, and may rightly be subject to economic sanctions or\neven military intervention. \nThe international original position parallels the domestic original\nposition of justice as fairness. This original position answers the\nquestion: “What terms of cooperation would free and equal\npeoples (liberal and decent) agree to under fair conditions?”\nThe strategy is to build the conception of peoples into the design of\nthis original position, along with restrictions on reasons for\nfavoring basic principles of international law. The strategy, that is,\nis to describe reasonable conditions under which a rational agreement\non principles can be made. \nIn the international original position, representatives of each people\nagree on principles for the international basic structure. Each party\nis behind a veil of ignorance, deprived of information about the\npeople they represent, such as the size of its territory and\npopulation, and its relative political and economic strength. Each\nparty tries to do the best they can for the people they represent, in\nterms of the fundamental interests that all peoples have. \nRawls claims that the parties in the international original position\nwould favor the eight principles listed above. Starting from a\nbaseline of equality and independence, the parties would see no reason\nto introduce inequalities into the relationships among peoples (beyond\ncertain functional inequalities in the design of cooperative\norganizations, such as richer countries contributing more to an\nidealized United Nations). The parties would reject international\nutilitarian principles, as no people is prepared to accept that it\nshould sacrifice its fundamental interests for the sake of greater\ntotal global utility. \nAfter selecting the eight principles of the law of peoples, the\nparties next check that these principles can stably order\ninternational relations over time. Analogously to the domestic case,\nthe parties will see that the principles of the law of peoples affirm\nthe good of peoples, and that peoples will develop trust and\nconfidence in one another as all willingly continue to abide by these\nprinciples. The stability of the international political order will\nthus be stability for the right reasons (and not a mere modus\nvivendi), since each people will affirm the principles as its\nfirst-best option whatever the international balance of power might\nbecome. \nRawls also attempts to draw empirical support for his stability\nargument from the literature on the democratic peace. Social\nscientists have found that historically democracies have tended not to\ngo to war with one another. Rawls explains this by saying that liberal\nsocieties are, because of their internal political structures,\nsatisfied. Liberal peoples have no desires for imperial\nglory, territorial expansion, or to convert others to their religion,\nand whatever goods and services they need from other countries they\ncan obtain through trade. Liberal peoples, Rawls says, have no reasons\nto fight aggressive wars, so a genuine peace can endure among them.\nAnd since decent peoples are defined as non-aggressive, any decent\npeople can join this liberal peace as well. \nOnce the parties have agreed to the eight principles of the law of\npeoples, they then continue to specify these principles more precisely\nin a process analogous to the domestic four-stage sequence. \nThe principles selected in the international original position contain\nprovisions for non-ideal situations: situations in which nations are\nunwilling to comply with the ideal principles, or are unable to\ncooperate on their terms. These provisions are embedded in principles\n4 through 8 of the law of peoples. \nOutlaw states are non-compliant: they threaten the peace by\nattempting to expand their power and influence, or by violating the\nhuman rights of those within their territory. The principles of the\nlaw of peoples allow peoples to fight these outlaw states in\nself-defense, and to take coercive actions against them to stop their\nviolations of human rights. In any military confrontations with outlaw\nstates, peoples must obey the principles of the just prosecution of\nwar, such as avoiding direct attacks on enemy civilians in all but the\nmost desperate circumstances. The aim of war, Rawls says, must be to\nbring all societies to honor the law of peoples, and eventually to\nbecome fully participating members of international society. \nBurdened societies struggle with social and economic\nconditions that make it difficult for them to maintain either liberal\nor decent institutions. A burdened society may lack sufficient\nmaterial or social resources to support a scheme of social\ncooperation, perhaps because its population has grown beyond its\nterritory’s means to support it. It is the basic structure and\npolitical culture of a society that are most crucial for its\nself-sufficiency; the international community must help a burdened\nsociety to rise above this threshold. The law of peoples (eighth\nprinciple) requires that burdened peoples be assisted until they can\nhandle their own affairs (i.e., become well-ordered). \nThis duty of assistance is Rawls’s greatest divergence from the\nrules of today’s international law. Accepting this duty would\nrequire significant changes in how nations respond to global poverty\nand failed states. \nRawls’s vision is of a perpetually peaceful and cooperative\ninternational order, where liberal and decent peoples stand ready to\npacify aggressive states, to secure core human rights, and to help\nstruggling countries until they become self-sufficient. \nCompared to other theories, Rawls’s international theory has\nlimited ambitions. Officials of democratic societies can do little\nmore than hope that decent societies will become internally more\ntolerant and democratic. Once the duty to assist burdened peoples is\nsatisfied, there are no further requirements on international economic\ndistributions: for Rawls, international economic inequalities are of\nno political concern as such. Moreover, individuals around the world\nmay suffer greatly from bad luck, and they may be haunted by spiritual\nemptiness. These are not concerns reached by a Rawlsian foreign\npolicy. \nThe limited practical goal of Rawls’s law of peoples is the\nelimination of the great evils of human history: unjust war and\noppression, religious persecution and the denial of liberty of\nconscience, starvation and poverty, genocide and mass murder. The\nlimits of this ambition mean that there will be much in the world to\nwhich Rawls’s political philosophy offers no reconciliation. \nNevertheless, while Rawls’s vision is limited, it is also\nutopian. To believe that Rawls’s vision is possible is to\nbelieve that individuals are not inevitably selfish or amoral, and\nthat international relations can be more than merely a contest for\ndomination, wealth, and glory. Human life, and human history, need not\nbe merely a Hobbesian “perpetual and restless desire of power\nafter power” (1651, 58). Affirming the possibility of a just and\npeaceful future can inoculate us against a cynicism that undermines\nthe decency, reciprocity, and reasonableness that exist now and that\nmay grow from now on. \n“By showing how the social world may realize the features of a\nrealistic utopia,” Rawls says, “political philosophy\nprovides a long-term goal of political endeavor, and in working toward\nit gives meaning to what we can do today” (LP,\n128). \nBeyond the texts by Rawls cited above, readers may wish to consult\nRawls’s lectures on Hume, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel\n(LHMP) and on Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Mill, Marx, Sidgwick, and\nButler (LHPP) to see how Rawls’s interpretations of\nthese authors informed his own theorizing. Reath, Herman, and\nKorsgaard (1997) is a collection of essays by Rawls’s students\non his work in the history of philosophy. \nThe scholarly literature on Rawls is vast; below are some entry points\nthat may be useful. \nVoice (2011) is a summary and defense of Rawls’s three main\nbooks that is accessible to those with some undergraduate\nphilosophical training. More advanced students wanting a guide to\nA Theory of Justice may wish to read Mandle (2009). Mandle\nand Reidy (2014) is a lexicon with short entries on important\nconcepts, issues, influences, and critics, from Abortion to Maximin to\nWittgenstein. \nFreeman (2007) sets out in a single volume the historical development\nof Rawls’s theories, as well as sympathetic elaborations of many\nof his central arguments. Weithman (2011) details the evolution of\nRawls’s thought from A Theory of Justice to\nPolitical Liberalism. Pogge (2007) is an explication of\nRawls’s domestic theories, which also contains a biographical\nsketch and brief replies to libertarian and communitarian critics (for\nwhich see also Pogge (1989)). Maffettone (2011) and Audard (2007) are\ncritical introductions to Rawls’s three major works. \nHistorically, the most influential volume of essays on justice as\nfairness has been Daniels (1975). Freeman (2003) is a collection of\narticles on major themes in Rawls’s domestic theories; it also\ncontains an introductory overview of all of Rawls’s work. Brooks\nand Nussbaum (2015) collects articles on Rawls’s political\nliberalism. Older collections on political liberalism include Davion\nand Wolf (1999), Griffin and Solum (1994) and Lloyd (1994). Martin and\nReidy (2006) focuses on the law of peoples. Hinton (2015) is a\ncollection on the original position. \nMandle and Reidy (2013) and Reidy (2008) are volumes of scholarly\nessays spanning a wide range of issues arising from Rawls’s\nwork. Young (2016) is a selection of more critical articles. Mandle\nand Roberts-Cady (2020) pairs authors in debates over major issues in\nRawls’s writings. \nA debate over Rawls and race is between Mills (2017, chs. 8 and 9) and\nShelby (2004, 2013). Abbey (2013) is a volume on feminist engagements\nwith Rawls’s work. Bailey and Gentile (2014) is an anthology\nthat explore how extensively religious believers can engage in the\npolitical life of a Rawlsian society. Brooks (2012) and Fleming (2004)\nare collections on Rawls and the law. O’Neill and Williamson\n(2012) is on the institutional design of a Rawlsian property-owning\ndemocracy. Edmundson (2017) argues that Rawlsian justice requires\nsocialism. \nGalisanka (2019) is an intellectual history leading up to A Theory\nof Justice, that also details Rawls’s experiences in World\nWar II. Gregory (2007) and Nelson (2019, ch. 3) examine Rawls’s\nearly religious writings. Bok (2017) emphasizes the Wittgensteinian\ninfluences on Rawls’s early thought. Botti (2019) situates Rawls\nwithin American pragmatism. Recent historicist treatments of\nRawls’s work include Forrester (2019) and some of the essays in\nSmith, Bejan, and Zimmerman (2021). In this last volume, Terry (2021)\ndiscusses Rawls’s condemnation of the racism of the Vietnam\ndraft. \nReaders who can gain access (usually through a library) to Kukathas\n(2003, 4 volumes) or Richardson and Weithman (1999, 5 volumes) will\nfind many of older scholarly articles on Rawls’s work, divided\naccording to specific themes (e.g., maximin reasoning, public reason)\nand types of criticisms (e.g., conservative critiques, feminist\ncritiques). Readers without access to the Richardson and Weithman\nvolumes can follow the links, in the Other Internet Resources section\nbelow, to their tables of contents and can then locate the articles in\ntheir original places of publication.","contact.mail":"lwenar@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
