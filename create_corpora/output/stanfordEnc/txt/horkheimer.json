Horkheimer was\nthe director of the Institute and Professor of Social Philosophy at\nthe University of Frankfurt from 1930–1933, and again from\n1949–1958.  In between those periods he would lead the Institute\nin exile, primarily in America.  As a philosopher he is best known\n(especially in the Anglophone world), for his work during the 1940s,\nincluding Dialectic of Enlightenment, which was co-authored with\nTheodor Adorno.  While deservedly influential, Dialectic of\nEnlightenment (and other works from that period) should not be\nseparated from the context of Horkheimer’s work as a whole. Especially\nimportant in this regard are the writings from the 1930s, which were\nlargely responsible for developing the epistemological and\nmethodological orientation of Frankfurt School critical theory.  This\nwork both influenced his contemporaries (including Adorno and Herbert\nMarcuse) and has had an enduring influence on critical theory’s later\npractitioners (including Jürgen Habermas, and the Institute’s\ncurrent director Axel Honneth).\n\n\n\nMax Horkheimer was born into a conservative Jewish family on\nFebruary 14, 1895, the only son of Moritz and Babette Horkheimer.\n A successful and respected businessman who owned several textile\nfactories in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart (where Max was\nborn), Moritz Horkheimer expected his son to follow in his footsteps.\n Thus Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family\nbusiness, where he eventually became a junior manager.  During\nthis period he would begin two relationships that would last for the\nrest of his life.  First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would\nlater become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max’s\nclosest friend.  He also met Rose Riekher, who was his\nfather’s personal secretary.  Eight years Max’s senior, a gentile,\nand of an economically lower class, Riekher (whom Max called “Maidon”)\nwas not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer.  Despite\nthis, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her\ndeath in 1969 (Wiggerschaus 1994, p. 41–44). \n\nIn the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer\nbegan studies at the University of Munich, and transferred to the\nUniversity of Frankfurt a semester later.  At Frankfurt he\nstudied psychology and philosophy, the latter with the neo-Kantian\nphilosopher Hans Cornelius.  He also spent a year, on Cornelius’s\nrecommendation, studying in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl.  After\nan abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt psychology,\nHorkheimer, with Cornelius’s direction, completed his doctorate in\nphilosophy with a dissertation titled The Antinomy of Teleological\nJudgment.  Upon completion of the degree he was offered an\nassistantship under Cornelius, and thus definitively set off on an\nacademic career rather than continuing in his father’s business.\n In 1925 Horkheimer completed his Habilitation with a work titled\nKant’s Critique of Judgment as a Link between Theoretical and Practical\nPhilosophy, and took a position as Privatdozent, or lecturer, at\nFrankfurt.  During this time he would lecture extensively on 18th\nand 19th Century philosophy, with his research interests moving more in\nline with Marxian themes (Wiggerschaus 1994, p. 44–47). \n\nThe most important moments of Horkheimer’s early academic career\nwould come in 1930.  In July he was appointed Professor of Social\nPhilosophy at Frankfurt, and in October made the director of the\nInstitut für Sozialforschung (Institute of Social\nResearch).  The Institute began as a Marxist study group\nstarted by Felix Weil, a one-time student of political science at\nFrankfurt who used his inheritance to fund an institution that would\nsupport his leftist academic aims.  Along with Pollock (who\nalso completed a doctorate in Frankfurt, writing on Marx), Horkheimer\nbecame acquainted with Weil, and took part in the activities of the\nInstitute from the beginning.  The Institute formally opened in\n1924 under the direction of the Austrian Marxist scholar Carl\nGrünberg, who became ill quickly after taking the post.\n While Pollock was more closely associated with the Institute\nduring the Grünberg period, he supported his friend for\nthe directorship (on the early history of the Institute, see Jay 1996,\nch. 1).  On January 24, 1931, Horkheimer delivered his inaugural\nlecture for the chair of social philosophy and directorship of the\nInstitute, titled “The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the\nTasks of an Institute for Social Research.”  This lecture, and\nseveral essays written by Horkheimer in the early 1930s, would develop\na conception of interdisciplinary social research that was meant to\nguide the activities of the institute during Horkheimer’s tenure as\ndirector. \n\nThis program was obstructed from the very beginning by\nsocial-political unrest.  In the time between Horkheimer’s being named\nProfessor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930,\nthe Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag.  In the\nmidst of the violence surrounding the Nazis’ rise, Horkheimer and his\nassociates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the\nInstitute out of Germany.  Shortly after Hitler was named Chancellor\nin 1933, the Institute in Frankfurt was closed and its building seized\nby the Gestapo. Horkheimer was also relieved of his professorship and\ndirectorship in early 1933, and relocated to Geneva, where the\nInstitute had opened a satellite office.  In 1934 Horkheimer moved to\nNew York, where one of Pollock’s assistants had been negotiating an\nagreement for the Institute with the department of sociology at\nColumbia University.  In July of 1934 Horkheimer accepted an offer\nfrom Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their buildings.\nHaving received American citizenship in 1940, Horkheimer would\ncontinue to live and work largely in New York until 1941, when he\nmoved to the Los Angeles area (for a thorough history of the\ndevelopment of Horkheimer’s thought up to this point, see Abromeit\n2011).  With the Institute splintering between New York and\nCalifornia, Horkheimer concentrated his energies on his own work,\nincluding the collaborative efforts with Theodor Adorno that\nproduced Dialectic of Enlightenment.  \n\nWith the end of WWII, Horkheimer gradually considered moving back to\nGermany.  In April 1948, he returned to Europe for the first time,\nto lecture in various cities, including as a visiting professor in\nFrankfurt. His full return to Germany would follow shortly, and in July\n1949 he was restored to his professorship at the University of\nFrankfurt.  The following year the Institute would return as well.\n After returning, Horkheimer would focus on administrative work,\nreestablishing the Institute and serving two terms as University Rector\nin the early 1950s.  In 1953 he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of\nthe City of Frankfurt, and would later be named honorary citizen of\nFrankfurt for life.  His academic activities also continued\nthroughout the 1950s, and included a period during which he served as a\nregular visiting professor at the University of Chicago.  His work\nwould slow, however, once he retired in 1958 to the Swiss town of\nMontagnola.  Max Horkheimer passed away on July 7, 1973, at the\nage of 78.  \n\nThe theoretical viewpoint that oriented the work of the Institute of\nSocial Research, most famously known as “critical theory,” was largely\ndeveloped by Horkheimer in various writings in the 1930s (most of which\nwere published in the Institute’s journal, the\nZeitschrift für\n Sozialforschung).[1]\n In the earliest works Horkheimer used the term\n“materialism,” rather than critical theory, to name his\nphilosophical viewpoint.  Though his early texts do not directly\nmention Marx as much as one might expect (perhaps for reasons of\npolitical expediency), it is clear that this theory draws great\ninspiration from Marxian thought (see Borman 2017 for further \ndiscussion of Horkheimer’s early materialism and its connection to \nMarx).  Horkheimer’s materialism is not\nsystematically presented in those early essays; rather the\nepistemological, methodological, and moral concepts that were to\norient the work of the Institute are developed through a variety of\ntexts. What follows is an attempt at a reconstruction of Horkheimer’s\nprogram for the Institute, which draws on elements from various essays\nof the early 1930s.\n \nOne can begin to piece together Horkheimer’s materialist method by\nexamining the 1931 inaugural address. There he presents most of the\nmain themes of his early philosophy in the context of describing what\nthe Institute was to accomplish under his leadership. As he notes at\nthe beginning, social philosophy must interpret the various phenomena\nassociated with human social life.  But along with this fairly obvious\npoint, he asserts that “social philosophy is confronted with the\nyearning for a new interpretation of a life trapped in its individual\nstriving for happiness” (p. 7).  This introduces perhaps the\nmost fundamental element of Horkheimer’s view.  Social philosophy must\nconnect with the practical aim of alleviating suffering.  But it is,\nafter all, still a theoretical enterprise, and he would emphasize that\nthe work of the Institute would amount to “a reformulation...of\nthe old question concerning the connection of particular existence and\nuniversal Reason” (pp. 11–12).  Along with the emphasis on\nsuffering, the proper interpretation of reason would play a crucial\nrole in Horkheimer’s thought.\n Early in the inaugural address he lays out a quick, and critical,\nhistory of modern German social philosophy that fixes on Hegel.\nHegelian social philosophy is criticized for\n“transfiguring” oppression; individual human experience,\nwith all its suffering, is given sense insofar as it is fit within a\nrational, overarching conception of the movement of the “eternal\nlife of Spirit” (pp. 4–5).  Horkheimer rejects this kind\nof metaphysical view because it seeks to cover over the reality of\nhuman suffering.  But he is not unreservedly critical of\nmetaphysics. After criticizing Hegelian social philosophy, he notes\nthat in reaction certain strands of social research eschewed\nphilosophy entirely.  This leads to Horkheimer’s criticism of the\nexcessive specialization of the (in this case social) sciences.  Due\nto this specialization, scientific researchers omit any broader\nexamination of the social roots, and social meaning, from their\ninquiry.  At least metaphysical thinking recognizes the need to\npresent a comprehensive view that can make sense of the social whole.\nThe twin critiques of metaphysics and science provide a space for\nHorkheimer to present his own view.  The aim of materialist social\nresearch is to combine specific empirical studies with more\ncomprehensive theorizing, and thus overcome these problems. Horkheimer\nfinishes by noting that this research will be aimed at the elucidation\nof the links between economic structure, psychology, and culture, such\nthat the work of various social scientists and theorists can be\nbrought together to forge an empirically informed picture of society\nthat might replace such previous metaphysical categories as Universal\nReason or Spirit.\n Thus construed, we can use the themes presented in the inaugural\naddress as a guide for the further examination of Horkheimer’s early\nthought.  Four elements become key: the emphasis on suffering and\nhappiness, the role rationality plays in emancipatory movements, the\ncombined critiques of metaphysics and positivism, and the methodology\nof interdisciplinary social research.  Each of these four is\nexamined in more depth in the four subsections below.  \n\nAs noted, the rejection of Hegelian social philosophy in the inaugural\nlecture is tied to a broader rejection of metaphysics, which will be\ndiscussed in more detail in §2.2.  At the root of the rejection\nof “transfiguration,” however, is a very basic point.  No\nsocial philosophy that denies the singular import of suffering, and\nthe corresponding desire to overcome that suffering, can properly\ngrasp human social reality.  Thus, in the 1933 essay\n“Materialism and Metaphysics” Horkheimer writes that\n“man’s striving for happiness is to be recognized as a natural\nfact requiring no justification” (p. 44).  Prior to any critique\nof metaphysics, materialism rests on the basic recognition of\nsuffering and the desire for happiness.  Suffering and happiness are\nin some sense “properly basic”; their significance is\nevident, in no need of justification, and foundational to materialist\nsocial theory.  \n\nThe talk of both “suffering” and “happiness”\nsuggests that Horkheimer oscillated between pessimistic and optimistic\nrenderings of this foundational idea.  The pessimistic side of this\nview, with its conception of human life as shared suffering, was\npresent in Horkheimer’s thought from very early in his life. In the\nnovellas and diary entries written from 1914–1918 and later\npublished as Aus der Pubertät (From Puberty), this\npessimism is prominent (see Schmidt 1993, 25–26). This is in\npart due to the early influence of Schopenhauer’s “metaphysical\npessimism” on Horkheimer’s thought, and Horkheimer himself would\nemphasize that Schopenhauer was his first philosophical role model\n(Horkheimer 1968, p. ix).  It is noteworthy (especially given the link\nhere to Horkheimer’s critique of metaphysics), that for Schopenhauer\nthis “metaphysical” view is tied to the concrete need to\ninterpret the world in a way that can help humans understand and deal\nwith their suffering (on this point, and Horkheimer’s relation to\nSchopenhauer’s thought in general, see Schmidt 1993).  Metaphysical or\nnot, this view is based on the notion that life is marked by pain.\nThe optimistic rendering comes to the fore in the above quote from\n“Materialism and Metaphysics” insofar as the desire for\nhappiness is emphasized.  But the optimism should not be\noverestimated, because happiness is construed in a solely negative\nmanner.  The oppressed are motivated not by some positive conception\nof happiness, but by the hope of freedom from suffering. This\nindividual desire for happiness can further manifest itself as the\nmoral sentiment of compassion, wherein we desire the happiness of\nothers (Horkheimer 1933b, pp.\n34–35).[2]\nThe desire to overcome one’s own suffering, combined with the feeling\nof compassion, should help motivate the oppressed to join together to\nwork for positive social change.  But even this optimistic note is\ntinged with a pessimistic note, as “the aim of a future happy\nlife for all” arises only “out of the privation of the\npresent” (Horkheimer 1933b p. 34); it is the existence of\ncurrent shared suffering that could lead to revolutionary social\nchange. \n\nAlong with Schopenhauer, Horkheimer’s thoughts on suffering owe a\ngreat deal to Freud.  The notion that human beings have an inner\ndrive to overcome suffering is taken from Freud’s early libido theory\n(see Held 1980, pp. 43–44 and 197–198).  Horkheimer’s most direct\nanalysis of Freud in the 1930s is found in “Egoism and Freedom\nMovements” (especially pp. 103–106), and the Freudian conception of\ninner drives will further mark Horkheimer’s later work, as will be\nshown in §4.2 below.  In the 1930s Horkheimer was also\ninfluenced by Erich Fromm, who was a member of the Institute at the\ntime; for example, shortly after the claim in “Materialism and\nMetaphysics” that the desire for happiness is a natural fact, Fromm’s\nwork is referenced.  It is noteworthy in this regard that Fromm’s\nwork from this period aimed to broadly draw together Freudian and\nMarxian views.  This connection can be seen in the link between\nthe desire for happiness and emancipation, as discussed in the next\nsection. \n\nWhen focusing on the affective nature of suffering, happiness, and\ncompassion in Horkheimer’s view, one might get the sense that he is\nrelying on a sort of emotivism that shuns reason.  But there is a\nstrongly rationalistic strand present in Horkheimer’s early work that\nis tied directly to his views on positive social change.  In fact,\nhe describes suffering as resulting from a lack of rational social\norganization, and proposes that any attempt to improve society must\ninvolve making it in some way more rational.  This view is in turn\ntied to the broadly Marxian element in Horkheimer’s early work, as\ncapitalism is criticized for creating the irrational social conditions\nthat lead to suffering. \n\nTo a large extent, this problem of irrationality is described as a\nsocial coordination problem.  Insofar as it is individual human\nbeings who suffer, and who desire happiness, individual welfare is a\ncrucial matter.  This is made clear by the critique of Hegelian\n“transfiguration,” which is problematic partly because it subsumes\nindividual suffering and happiness within the absolute.  At the\nsame time, individual welfare is still dependent upon a broader social\nbasis, so the life of society as a whole is pertinent to the search for\nhappiness.  But capitalism has created a situation wherein people\nare made to focus on their own individual welfare, without considering\nanything other than “the conservation and multiplication of their own\nproperty” (1933b, p. 19).   Social needs are thus handled through\nvarious disorganized activities focused on individual needs, which in\nturn inadequately deals with the social basis of individual welfare,\nthus detracting from individual welfare.  This kind of critique is\nfound in some form in many of Horkheimer’s early essays (see, for\nexample, 1934c, pp. 247–250 and 1935b, pp. 162–170). \n\nSuch an argument is made particularly clearly in “Materialism\nand Morality,” where Horkheimer discusses idealist, and predominantly\nKantian, conceptions of morality.  One main thread of the rather\nintricate argument made there is that there is a tension in Kant’s\nview, insofar as he places a radical emphasis on the individual will,\nbut also makes that will beholden to the universal law described in\nterms of the kingdom of ends.  This tension supposedly comes from\nthe bourgeois socio-economic context in which Kant lived: \n\nThis passage makes it clear that the coordination problems\nassociated with the “bourgeois epoch” (i.e. the capitalist period) are\nproblems of irrationality.  Furthermore, it makes clear that the\nsolution to these problems is to be found in the formation of a more\nrational social order, which is described in terms of a socialist\nplanned economy.  This point, then, provides the space where\nHorkheimer can link his own materialist theory, and the work of the\nInstitute, to the broadly Marxian aim of emancipation through\novercoming the capitalist order.  Because “the wretchedness of our\nown time is connected with the structure of society” (1933b, 24) a\nsocial theory that could make that structure’s\nirrationality explicit could help overcome that wretchedness.\n Furthermore, that irrationality needs to be made explicit to the\nclasses who suffer the most from it, so they can take proper action.\n So Horkheimer’s view connects generally to the\nMarxian view of the proletariat as a critical force in history, but\nunlike (on certain interpretations, at least) Marx, he does not see\nhistory as necessarily moving the proletariat to “critical\nconsciousness” because of the irrationality inherent in capitalist\nsocio-economic arrangements. Rather, various social and economic forces\nkeep the proletariat from recognizing its potential; for example there\nis a split between the unemployed, who suffer most from capitalism but\nare disorganized, and the workers who can be organized, but fear losing\ntheir jobs (Horkheimer 1934a, 61–65).  The proletariat\nrequires the help of the theorist.  That theorist must engage in a\nspecial kind of activity, however, which (as the next section will\nshow) must steer clear of two opposing errors. \n\nOne can get a sense of what Horkheimer means when criticizing\nmetaphysics by looking at “Materialism and Metaphysics.” There\nmetaphysics is described in relation to Wilhelm\nDilthey’s doctrine of “world views.”  For\nDilthey, human beings engage in metaphysics in an attempt to explain\nthe enigmatic elements of human life.  In this attempt, certain\ncharacteristics of experience are emphasized and developed into\ncoherent world views that have putatively universal validity, and\ndescribe the significance of the world and human life (pp. 10–17).\n So “metaphysics,” in this sense, amounts to a kind of\nintellectualized, theoretically elaborated attempt at turning partial,\nfinite experiences into a comprehensive view of nature and human\nexperience. \n\nFor Horkheimer, theories of this type are in part problematic because\n“knowledge of the infinite must itself be infinite”\n(Horkheimer 1933a, p. 27).  But human beings are only capable of\nfinite knowledge, and can only pay attention to changing historical\nconditions.  If insights into the absolute are impossible, there is no\nknown ultimate order of things that grounds all other forms of\nknowledge.  Along these lines Horkheimer criticized Max Scheler’s\nmetaphysical anthropology for holding that all human works and\nachievements could be described in terms of some basic structure of\nhuman nature (Horkheimer 1935b, p. 153).  Rather than pursuing an\ninterest in understanding human existence, Horkheimer argues,\nmetaphysics obscures the proper understanding of human life.  Many of\nHorkheimer’s early essays aim to show how the works of various\nphilosophers, past and present, are troubled in this way.  For\nexample, along with the criticism of Dilthey in “Materialism and\nMetaphysics” and the criticism of Scheler in “Remarks on\nPhilosophical Anthropology,” there are (among others) critiques\nof this type that attack Kant in “Materialism and\nMorality,” and Henri Bergson in “On Bergson’s Metaphysics\nof Time.”  \n\nIn each case, however, Horkheimer was not solely critical, and there\nis a positive element that Horkheimer finds in metaphysics that serves\nas a transition to his critique of science.  For example, in the\n1932 essay “Notes on Science and the Crisis,” he applauds “postwar\nmetaphysics, especially that of Max Scheler” for developing “a method\nless hindered by conventional narrowness of outlook” (p.6).\n Similarly, in the 1934 essay “The Rationalism Debate in\nContemporary Philosophy,” Horkheimer agrees with Dilthey and Bergson\n(and also Nietzsche, all three under the aegis of Lebensphilosophie)\ninsofar as they critique scientism and formalistic rationalism.\n Metaphysics is, in general, right to try to engage in some form\nof synoptic theorizing, although it takes it too far. But the opposite\nextreme, of which Scheler, Dilthey, and Bergson are critical, fits with\nHorkheimer’s conception of the state of the sciences. \n\nThe critique of the sciences developed in the early texts moves\nalong two lines.  First, the sciences are criticized for being\noverly specialized.  For example, in the inaugural address\nHorkheimer complains of “chaotic specialization” (p. 9).  The\ndanger of focusing on technical minutiae is that researchers become\ninsulated from one another, and lose the ability to use one another’s\nresources.  The result is a lack of unification and overall\ndirection.  Just as he favors a planned economy, Horkheimer wants\nthe “setting of tasks” in scientific research to be brought under\nrational control, so empirical researchers can work together toward\nbroader ends.  Second, as noted in “Notes on Science and the\nCrisis,” science “has no realistic grasp of that comprehensive\nrelationship upon which its own existence and the direction of its work\ndepends, namely, society” (p. 8).  All human work, be it in the\nsciences or anything else, depends on a broader context which supports\nit, and the activities that are associated with the social interests\nprevalent at any given time affect the direction of scientific\nresearch.  There is no “view from nowhere” from which empirical\nresearch begins, but only socially situated standpoints.\n Horkheimer expands on this point to argue that when empirical\nresearch misses its social roots, it also misses the effects the\n“direction of its work” might have on society.  Science has a\nresponsibility to society that can only be filled if its various\nresearch efforts are knit together within a more comprehensive\nframework that takes society and its improvement as its object. \n\nThis is largely repeated in other works that criticize “positivism.”\n The fact that the Frankfurt School mounted a strong critique\nof positivism is quite well known, in part because of the\nso-called “Positivismusstreit” of the 1960s, and Horkheimer also uses\nthe term frequently, especially in his later works.  The\ncritiques of science and positivism make the same basic\n points.[3]\n Consider the critique of logical positivism in the 1937 essay “The\nLatest Attack on Metaphysics.”  There Horkheimer argues that insofar\nas logical empiricism “holds only to what is, to the guarantee of\nfacts” (pp. 133–134), it tries to insulate the individual sciences\nfrom broader interpretation.  Thus positivism disconnects science from\nsociety and robs it of its emancipatory possibilities, because brute\nfacts can only grasp the present, and the possibility for changing the\nstatus quo in the future is lost. \n\nThe crucial point to note is that the critiques of metaphysics and\nscience work together, and are meant to open up a space between the two\nwhere materialist social research should operate.  Philosophy\nmaintains metaphysics’ goal of producing a synoptic view of human life,\nbut it does so in a merely provisional way, which is open to empirical\nresearch that genuinely follows the contours of history.  Science,\non the other hand, maintains its rigorous empirical methods, but must\nopen itself up to the role it plays in the broader social framework.\n In the inaugural address, Horkheimer thus claims that there must\nbe a “continuous, dialectical penetration and development of\nphilosophical theory and specialized scientific practice” (p. 9). \n\nHorkheimer’s conception of interdisciplinary social research is rooted\nin, broadly construed, both empiricist and realist views.  Horkheimer\nspeaks often of such research as aiming at “facts,” as\nseen in §2.1 when he refers to the desire for happiness as a\nnatural fact. This connects to a kind of realism seen most directly in\nthe 1935 essay “On the Problem of Truth.”\n“Materialism” he tells us, “insists that objective\nreality is not identical with man’s thought,” and truth is\ndetermined by the “relation of the propositions to\nreality” (pp. 189, 194). But this realism has to be qualified;\nmaterialism is distinguished from idealism through the appeal to an\nobjective reality outside of our thinking, but it is further separated\nfrom metaphysical realism by its recognition that our knowing is\nhistorically bounded. Along these lines, Horkheimer admits to holding\nto a correspondence theory of truth, but notes that: \n\nThis correspondence is neither a simple datum [nor] an immediate\nfact...Rather, it is always established by real events and human\nactivity. Already in the investigation and determination of\nfacts, and even more in the verification of theories, a role is played\nby the direction of attention, the refinement of methods, the\ncategorical structure of the subject matter—in short, by human\nactivity corresponding to the given social period. (p. 190) \n\nHere we find Horkheimer’s epistemological considerations echoing his\ncritique of science.  Presumably the “real events and human\nactivity” that grasp objective truth involve empirical research.\nBut because (as discussed in the critique of science) empirical\nresearch is always tied to a social context, one must see that the\ntruths it reveals are conditioned by the “human activity\ncorresponding to the given social period.” Knowledge is always\naffected by the historical changes in our methods noted. But more than\ntheoretical or methodological changes that shift scientific theories,\nHorkheimer sees knowledge as being marked by our practical\ninterests. This is why a strong metaphysical conception of reality is\nunavailable to us; all thinking is marked by practical and theoretical\ninterests that are partial and subject to historical change. \n\nBut this point cannot be taken too far; truth is neither wholly\ndetermined by our practical interests nor by theory-dependent\nconditions of verification. When it is claimed that truth is dependent\non the “relation of propositions to reality,” Horkheimer\nmeans both of those to be given equal weight. While the weight put on\n“propositions” (or better, human conceptual activity)\nremoves the possibility of a metaphysical theory of reality, it does\nnot remove reality.  But because all inquiry into truth is\nhistorically and socially mediated, it is constantly open to\nadjustment.  This points out why the “continuous, dialectical\npenetration” of philosophy and science spoken of in the\ninaugural address is necessary.  Objective truths have to be grasped\nempirically, and the work of the specialized sciences is thus\nnecessary to determine the truth of the current state of society.  But\n“truth is advanced” only when “human beings who\npossess it stand by it unbendingly, apply it and carry it through, act\naccording to it, and bring it to power against the resistance of\nreactionary, narrow, one-sided points of view” (Horkheimer\n1935a, p. 4).  This requires that empirical research be saved from\n“chaotic specialization,” and interpreted through an\nadequate theoretical framework.  It is noteworthy in this regard that\ntoward the end of the inaugural lecture, Horkheimer states that it is\nappropriate for the head of the Institute to also hold a chair in\nsocial philosophy, as was not the case with his predecessor who worked\nin the “specific discipline” of political economy.  For\nHorkheimer, it was properly the job of the philosopher to plan out and\nguide the interdisciplinary work of the Institute. \n\nHistorical exigencies kept the Institute’s early researchers from\nimplementing this program.  They did press on with their empirical and\ntheoretical efforts during the time of upheaval in the 1930s,\nproducing various small studies in the Zeitschrift für\nSozialforschung, and the larger Studies on Authority and the\nFamily.  It is clearly the case, however, that there were many\ndifficulties in carrying out the empirical research that was used in\nthose studies (see the historical discussion of this period in\nWiggerschaus 1994, 149–156).  Even if we set aside the\nhistorical difficulties that beset the Institute during this time,\nthere is still reason to question whether Horkheimer’s\ninterdisciplinary program could have been carried out successfully.\nOne might doubt, for example, that the philosophers who formed the\ncore of the Frankfurt School, including Horkheimer himself, were\nactually open enough to the sciences.  Jay 1996 (pp. 130–131),\nWiggerschaus 1994 (p. 151), and Wolin 1992 (pp. 56–58), argue\nthat they were not, such that their theoretical works (especially\nin Studies on Authority and the Family) were not really\nintegrated with the empirical studies.  Perhaps more damningly,\nBonß 1993 argues that this failure comes from faults internal to\nHorkheimer’s methodological and epistemological considerations such\nthat “the interdisciplinary claim amounts to no more than an\nexternal formula for integration” (p. 118).  This seems fair\ninsofar as Horkheimer spent a great deal of energy claiming that\nempirical and theoretical research should be combined, and explaining\nwhy they should be combined, but did very little to explain how\nthey would be so combined.  It remains to be shown if one might\nreactivate Horkheimer’s intentions while providing a better\nexplanation of how such integrated research might actually work.\nClearly, however, Horkheimer would come to gradually doubt the\nefficacy of such a program; one can begin to trace out this shift by\nexamining the 1937 essay “Traditional and Critical Theory”\n(this separation of the 1937 essay from the earlier\n“materialist” works roughly follows arguments in Dubiel\n1985).  \n\nTo an extent, Horkheimer’s materialist theory is encapsulated in his\nmost famous and widely-read essay from the 1930s, “Traditional\nand Critical Theory.” The essay is often referred to as being\n“programmatic,” highlighting the notion that it summarizes\nthe philosophical and methodological views that were meant to guide\nthe work of the Institute (see, for example, Schmidt 1993, p. 34, and\nIngram 1990, p. 108).  This is not wrong, but can be misleading if\noveremphasized.  At the same time as it summarizes the earlier work,\n“Traditional and Critical Theory” evinces a transition to\nHorkheimer’s later critiques of reason and enlightenment (a similar\npoint is made in Benhabib 1986, pp. 149–163).  The most obvious\nchange occurs in the name Horkheimer gives to his favored view, as he\nshifts from “materialism” to “critical\ntheory.” But the changes are more than cosmetic.  For example,\nthe critique of “traditional theory” subtly shifts the\nterms of the critiques of metaphysics and positivism.  Also, the role\nof the theorist vis-a-vis society changes.  In part, this prefigures\nlater views.  \n\nThe titular forms of theorizing correspond (as noted at the beginning\nof the 1937 “Postscript,” p. 244) to those found in\nDescartes’ Discourse on Method and Marx’s critique of political\neconomy, respectively.  So the overarching point of the essay can be\nsummarized fairly succinctly; it describes a form of\n“traditional” theory that follows Descartes’ methodology,\nexamines the weaknesses of such theory, and then opposes to\ntraditional theory a superior Marxian “critical” theory.\nThe critique of traditional theory largely follows the earlier\ncritique of the sciences and positivism, and in this sense is a\nsummation.  Again, the fact that the sciences do not recognize their\npresence in a broader social framework is emphasized.  Traditional\ntheory misses the fact that that “bringing hypotheses to bear on\nfacts is an activity that goes on, ultimately, not in the savant’s\nhead but in industry” (p. 196).  “Savant” is the\nderisive term Horkheimer uses throughout the text to refer to the\ntraditional theorist, and the savant does not recognize that the\neconomic (and thus currently capitalist) structure of society shapes\nscientific work.  The savant further misses the suffering caused by\nthat social structure, and the fact that science is complicit in this\noppression.  Critical theorizing, on the other hand, is “a human\nactivity which has society itself for its object” (p.  206); it\novercomes the blindness of the savant by openly and purposely\nexamining the way in which theory is immersed in a particular\nhistorical and social setting, and it seeks to critique that social\nsetting for emancipatory effect.  This relies on a form of immanent\ncritique, tied to the suffering of the oppressed; the theorist must\nseize on the meaning of the experience of the oppressed and develop it\ninto a coherent critique of existing society.  To this end Horkheimer\nnotes that if the critical theorist’s “presentation of societal\ncontradictions is not merely an expression of the concrete historical\nsituation but also a force within it to stimulate change, then [the\ncritical theorist’s] real function emerges” (p. 215). \n\nThis general symmetry with the earlier program belies certain\nimportant changes to the theory, however.  The very beginning of the\ntext, which discusses traditional theory, shows a subtle shift from\nthe earlier work.  Traditional theory is first linked with the natural\nsciences, for which “theory” involves a set of logically\nlinked propositions that are consonant with empirical facts.  The\nlogical coherence of such a set of propositions is then emphasized,\nand connected to Descartes’ method.  Horkheimer goes on to suggest\nthat such a conception of theory has an inherent tendency to move\ntoward “a purely mathematical system of symbols.” Formal\nlogic and reasoning thus become a main target of criticism.  This is\nnot a radical departure from Horkheimer’s earlier critique of science,\nsince, for example, in “Notes on Science and the Crisis,”\nhe objects to the rigid, mechanistic character of the scientific\nmethod. But the earlier texts focus more on a problem that is external\nto the sciences.  There is no coherent “setting of tasks”\nprior to the engagement in empirical research, and the results of\nempirical research are not knit into a broader theory that can have\nemancipatory intent. The earlier essays largely ask for the sciences\nto go about their normal business within an interdisciplinary setting\nthat would correct these problems.  In “Traditional and Critical\nTheory,” on the other hand, the critique strikes more directly\nat the formalism inherent in the sciences’ own methodology, such that\nthe problem is internal to the sciences.  This provides one clear\ntransitional point, insofar as formalism will be a primary object of\ncritique in Horkheimer’s writings from the 1940s.   \n\nAnother interesting shift is that the critique of metaphysics largely\nfalls out of the picture.  For some commentators, metaphysics is\nfolded, along with science, into traditional theory (see Brunkhorst\n1993, 74).  But this does not seem entirely correct, because in the\nmidst of criticizing positivism, Horkheimer notes that there is,\n“lurking” in positivism’s emphasis on facts,\n“something like a reaction against the alliance of metaphysics\nand oppression” (p.  232).  This claim hearkens back to the\nnotion, described in places like “Materialism and\nMetaphysics,” that scientific attention to facts, when properly\nconstrued within materialist research, can keep philosophy from\noverlooking actual human suffering.  But such references are few, and\nHorkheimer does shift the discussion of science in such a way that it\ntakes over parts of his earlier critique of metaphysics.  For example,\nhe criticizes the sciences, in a manner that is not common in earlier\nessays, for the way they subsume facts under universal concepts\n(pp. 224–226).  This critique of universal concepts is tied to\nthe critique of formalism; Horkheimer finds fault in the fact that the\nsciences relate facts to concepts in terms of the “relation of\nclasses to instances” which can be “accomplished by a\nsimple deduction” (p.225).  Critical theory is then contrasted\nwith this overly simplified universal-particular relation insofar as\nit constantly reexamines the relation of facts to universal concepts,\nand sees them as fitting together in a dynamic relationship that must\nbe carefully charted.  The implication is that logical formalism leads\nthe sciences to form static universals into which all particulars can\nbe neatly placed.  Since the sciences are attending to facts in\nengaging in such an operation, the critique does not exactly match up\nwith the criticism that metaphysics turns a blind eye to the world.\nBut as those facts are misconstrued through formalism, the upshot of\nthe critique is the same; actual social existence has not been\nadequately incorporated into theory because of the creation of a false\nuniversal.  This formalism is contrasted with the fact that critical\ntheory is “the unfolding of a single existential judgment”\n(p. 227).  Displaying the contradictions inherent in capitalist\nsociety, and fixing on possibilities for emancipatory change, does not\ninvolve the scientific subsumption of facts within a logically ordered\nconceptual system.  It rather involves unfolding and elaborating on an\ninsight that one initially acquires simply by existing in (with\n“existing in” taken in the robust sense of living and\nacting in) that society.   \n\nThe way this point is construed displays the most crucial difference\nbetween “Traditional and Critical Theory” and its antecedents.\n Horkheimer’s attitude toward the possibility of social change is\nless optimistic, and the critical theorist is described as having a\nsomewhat antagonistic relationship with the oppressed.  This fits\nwith a general shift in the Frankfurt School’s work from the 1930s to\nthe 1940s corresponding to a lack of faith in the possibility of\nemancipatory social change.  In his 1937 essay “Philosophy and\nCritical Theory,” (which he wrote largely as a response to and\ncounterpart with “Traditional and Critical Theory”) Herbert Marcuse\nrhetorically asks what happens “if the development outlined by the\ntheory does not occur? What if the forces that were to bring about the\ntransformation are suppressed and appear to be defeated?” (Marcuse\n1937, 63)  “Traditional and Critical Theory” is worried precisely\nwith these questions.  For a variety of reasons, including obvious\nsocial and political exigencies, Horkheimer and his associates would\nbecome less and less confident that the oppressed classes could become\na force for change.  Horkheimer clearly did not believe that\ncompassion and the desire to overcome suffering could, on their own,\nmotivate social change.  Consider the assertion in\n“Traditional and Critical Theory” that\nwhile the oppressed strive for happiness they do not know how to\nachieve it, so the theorist must step in and help the oppressed come\nto critical consciousness.  “Even the\nsituation of the proletariat is…no guarantee of correct\nknowledge” (pp. 211–215); the significance of suffering is\nnot always evident to those who experience it, and it is the job of the\nsocial theorist to elaborate on this significance in such a way that it\ncan have practical effect.  “Traditional and Critical Theory”\nholds out the hope that this task is possible, but it is noteworthy\nthat the critical theorist is described as being set over against the\noppressed, as “it is the task of the critical theoretician to reduce the\ntension between his own insight and oppressed humanity in whose service\nhe thinks” (p. 221). \n\nHorkheimer would become less and less confident that the tension\ncould be so reduced.  He also ominously notes that while the\n“commodity economy” might at first usher in a period of progress,\n“after an enormous extension of human control over nature, it finally\nhinders further development and drives humanity into a new barbarism”\n(p. 227).  This passage states the main themes that would dominate\nHorkheimer’s work in the 1940s, which would be marked by an increasing\npessimism in the ability of rational, theoretical activity to halt that\ndrive toward barbarism. \n\nIn the late 1930s, Horkheimer described all of his efforts as\nworking toward a project on dialectical logic (Wiggerschaus 1994,\n177).  This “dialectics project” would, through many twists and\nturns, develop into ideas presented primarily in two books published in\n1947.  Horkheimer was the sole author of Eclipse of Reason,\nwhich appeared originally in English. The book incorporates and\nexpands on a series of lectures delivered at Columbia University in\n1944, and, as Horkheimer writes in its preface, presents “in\nepitome some aspects” of his work with Adorno from that time (p. vi).\n That work with Adorno would also produce Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, a collaborative text that was first published in\n1947, after having been distributed as a limited edition typescript in\n1944.  It would become the most famous work of the “first\ngeneration” of the Frankfurt School, and is surely the work most\ncommonly associated with Horkheimer’s\n name.[4]\n The rest of this section will review the major themes of Horkheimer’s\nwork from the 1940s, considering both Dialectic of Enlightenment and\nEclipse of Reason together. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the text of Eclipse would eventually be\npublished in German as “Zur Kritik der instrumentellen\nVernunft” (“On the Critique of Instrumental\nReason”).  Both Eclipse and Dialectic are nuanced\ntexts that present a number of themes, but if there is one overarching\ntheme to the work from the 40s it is, as that German title suggests,\nthe critical description of how reason collapses into irrationality\nthrough its emphasis on instrumental concerns.  What is at stake here\nis made most clear by the first chapter of\nEclipse, which is straightforwardly titled “Means and Ends.”\n Instrumental reason is interested only in determining the means\nto a goal, without reasoning about ends in themselves.  In\nDialectic, the Enlightenment is largely equated with the advance of\ninstrumental reason, and through instrumental reason, Enlightenment\nturns against itself.  This is noted in the very beginning of\nthe text: “Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance\nof thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and\ninstalling them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth is radiant\nwith triumphant calamity” (p.1). \n\nWhile the strong emphasis on instrumental reason’s domination of\nnature (which will be more fully discussed in §4.2) is new\nto the work of the 1940s, it picks up on themes present in Horkheimer’s\nearlier work.  A prominent component (particularly in Dialectic)\nof the critique of instrumental reason is a critique of formalistic\nrationality, which evokes the criticism of the Cartesian mathematical\nmethod in “Traditional and Critical Theory.”  On the face of it,\none might question the necessary link between “formal” and\n“instrumental.”  But Horkheimer and Adorno equate formalism with\nthe drive to make nature calculable, and calculability is assimilated\nto usefulness.  Thus formalistic reason becomes a species\ninstrumental reason.  Along similar lines, the critique of\npositivism is repeated in Eclipse (pp. 40–62).  All parts of\nnature that cannot be calculated and formalized fall out of the\nEnlightenment’s scientific picture of the world.  This scientific\npicture is further reproduced through activities which seek to dominate\nnature, thus instrumental-scientific activity creates a reality to fit\nthis picture.  The inexorable drive of instrumental reason causes\nthis distorted picture to be seen as the only true picture of the world\n(Horkheimer 1947a p. 33).    \n\nMoreover, all elements of society, not just scientific research, are\ntouched by the progress of instrumental rationality.  Motivated by\nself-preservation, people seek protection from various powerful groups\n(sometimes called “rackets,” see Schmid Noerr 2002, and\nStirk 1992 ch.  6).  Instrumental rationality causes society to\nfragment into these various competing cliques.  But this fragmentation\nis attended by cultural homogenization, as displayed by the chapter in\nDialectic titled “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass\nDeception.”  The general thrust of that chapter is that\ninstrumental rationality has assimilated culture to an industrial\nmodel, which leads to a leveling and homogenizing of that culture.\n At points, this homogenizing move is described as though it is\nnecessarily all-encompassing, as when the authors write that “anyone\nwho resists can survive only by being incorporated.  Once\nregistered as diverging from the culture industry, they belong to it as\nthe land reformer does to capitalism” (p. 104).   \n\nEclipse also presents a slightly different view of instrumental\nreason, which is equated with “subjective reason,” and\ncontrasted with “objective\n reason.”[5]\n At the beginning of “Means and Ends,” Horkheimer notes\nthat “the average man will say that reasonable things are things\nthat are obviously useful,” and then notes that it is through\n“classification, inference, and deduction…the abstract\nfunctioning of the thinking mechanism,” that one is to determine\nwhat is thus reasonable (p. 3).  Usefulness is further equated with\nwhatever works in favor of one’s self-preservation.  This is why\ninstrumental reason is subjective reason; it is thought oriented to\nthe subject’s preservation.  Objective reason (which Horkheimer\nlargely associates with history’s great metaphysical systems from\nPlato to German Idealism), on the other hand, seeks to root truth and\nmeaning, which should be the proper ends of thought, within some\ncomprehensive totality.  Objective reason is interested in ends, while\nsubjective reason is interested only in means. Subjective reason thus\nfalls into incoherence, because as the drive toward self-preservation\nbecomes more and more all encompassing, any real conception of the\nsignificance of what is to be preserved is lost. Subjectivity is so\noriented toward self-preservation that the drive toward\nself-preservation is the only end left.  An interesting comparison can\nbe drawn here with the earlier critique of capitalist social\narrangements discussed in §2.2 above.  There the similar point is\nmade that the drive to fulfill self interests is ultimately self\ndefeating.  But there is a crucial difference; in the works from the\n1930s this is clearly said to be the fault of irrationality, and it is\nsupposed that more rational social arrangements could overcome the\nproblem.  In the works from the 1940s, rationality itself is\nimpugned. \n\nThis description of subjective reason thus displays one way in which\nreason works against itself, and so falls into irrationality.  A more\nfamous way that this movement is displayed is through one of the\nprimary themes of Dialectic, viz. that “myth is already\nenlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology” (p.\nxviii). Myth is already enlightenment insofar as myths are already an\nattempt to control nature; “myth sought to report, to name, to\ntell of origins, but therefore also to narrate, record, explain”\n(p. 5).  The interpretation of the Odyssey in Excursus I serves as a\nconcrete example of this point.  In general, the Odyssey maps out and\nrationally orders ancient myths, and shows how humanity, in the person\nof Odysseus, goes about submitting the mythological to rational\ncontrol (pp. 35–40).  Just as myth prefigured enlightenment,\nenlightenment in turn becomes myth insofar as our abstract categories\nbecome reified, leveling their relation to nature and thus making them\nuntrue.  This is the case, for example, with the formalistic\nscientific picture of the world mentioned above; “the mythical\nscientific respect of peoples for the given reality, which they\nthemselves constantly create, finally becomes itself a positive fact,\na fortress before which even the revolutionary imagination feels\nshamed as utopianism” (p. 33). \nInstrumental rationality necessarily involves the domination of\nnature.  Taken in its most straightforward sense, this point has\nbecome something of a commonplace.  As the sciences developed during\nthe enlightenment period (and earlier, insofar as myth was already\nenlightenment), technology also developed, at the service of\nself-preservation.  Technology involves making over nature for human\npurposes.  This movement ends up thwarting human preservation,\nhowever, insofar as the destruction of nature involves the destruction\nof humanity.  This now fairly common line of critique is complicated\nin Horkheimer’s work from the 1940s, however, because instrumental\nrationality’s distortion of “outer nature” (nature taken in the most\nstraightforward sense), is directly tied to the repression of “inner\nnature.” \n\nThe concept of “inner nature” is tied to the Freudian libido theory\nalready mentioned in §2.1 above.  Our inner life is\nmost immediately, or “naturally,” marked by various drives,\nparticularly the desire for pleasure (which would be akin to the desire\nfor happiness discussed above).  On the Freudian view ego\ndevelopment involves the suppression of these various drives (along\nthese lines Horkheimer directly mentions Freud in Eclipse in discussing\nthe way the child relates to the superego which embodies the principles\nof father-figures; see p. 75).  While the development of the ego\nis necessary, undue repression of our inner drives leads to\npathological results.  In Excursus II of Dialectic, this\nrepression of inner nature is related to Kant’s moral theory, insofar\nas it specifies that the will should follow reason against inclination.\n This complete denial of inclination by calculating reason finds\nits fullest expression (in an ironic suggestion that would surely\nhorrify Kant) in the writings of the Marquis de Sade.  Pleasure, in\nSade’s orgies, is submitted to rigorous order, such that the\nrationalized pursuit of pleasure takes precedence over pleasure itself\n(pp. 66–69).  And importantly in this case it is not only the\ninner desires that are subjugated; others people are subjugated in\nthe process of subjugating pleasure to organization.  This is one\ninstance of Horkheimer and Adorno’s broader claim that the domination\nof nature leads to the domination of human beings. \n\nThe same points are made in Eclipse in the chapter “The\nRevolt of Nature,” where the domination of inner nature is\ndescribed as following necessarily from the domination of outer\nnature.  Instrumental reason leads us to dominate outer nature by\ntaking outer nature to be meaningless apart from the way it can\nsatisfy the prerogatives of our self-preservation.  But this further\nrequires that our desires must be construed in such a way that they\ncan provide a clear guide for the technological and industrial\nactivity that makes use of outer nature.  In this case,\n“domination becomes ‘internalized’ for domination’s\nsake.  What is usually indicated as a goal—the happiness of the\nindividual, health, wealth—gains its significance exclusively\nfrom its functional potentiality” (p. 64).  Lohmann 1993\nsuggestively sums up Horkheimer’s point by referring to the domination\nof outer and inner nature as a process of\n“desubstantialization” (p. 392).  This connects clearly\nwith the contrast between objective and subjective reason discussed\nabove.  Nature loses its objective meaning, or in this sense, its own\n“substance”; not only in the case of outer nature, but\nalso in the case of inner nature, because of the functionalization of\nour desires and drives.  Eclipse construes this in terms of a\nloss of autonomy, which would involve our creatively developing drives\nand desires into ideal ends that could orient the ways we act on our\nenvironments (see, for example, 66).  This can make sense of the\nsomewhat unique interpretation in Dialectic of Odysseus telling\nthe cyclops that he is “Nobody” (p. 53).  As we reduce our\ninner nature to instrumental functions, we lose any strong sense of\nself, and thus lack the inner substance in a manner that makes us,\nmetaphorically, into nobodies. \n\nThe upshot of these views seems to be that reason is\nself-destructive in a way that limits the very possibility of a\nrational critique of reason.  It is fairly common to interpret the\nwork from the 1940s as being so totalizing in its critique that it\ncloses all avenues for finding in reason the possibility for any\nemancipatory critique of society (Habermas is the most famous exponent\nof such a critique, see for example his 1984, pp. 366–399).  One\ncan certainly find much pessimistic rhetoric in both Dialectic and\nEclipse that supports such a notion.  But there are also elements\nof the text that hint at the possibility for positive social change,\nsuch that the emancipatory aim of earlier critical theory is not\nentirely lost. \n\nThe emancipatory aim is not lost, but it is perhaps obscured.  In the\nfirst essay of Dialectic, it is noted that “a true praxis\ncapable of overturning the status quo depends on theory’s refusal to\nyield to the oblivion in which society allows thought to ossify”\n(p. 33).  That “theory” and “thought” are so\nemphasized is important.  Relatedly, Horkheimer disavows, in the\npreface to Eclipse, the idea he should present a program of\naction, because “action for action’s sake is in no way superior\nto thought for thought’s sake, and is perhaps even inferior to\nit” (p. vi).  This does not necessarily separate thought from\naction, of course, and the quote from Dialectic speaks of a\n“true praxis.” But genuinely emancipatory action is said\nto depend on correcting problems of thought first, such that\nHorkheimer would stress thought for thought’s sake.  Correcting these\nproblems would require freeing reason from instrumentality, which\nwould mean eschewing formalism.  But this does not mean eschewing\nreason, if there can be a kind of knowing that uses rational concepts\nwhile at the same time moving beyond the static form of concepts\nassociated with scientific thinking.  Such a view is closely\nassociated with Adorno’s later work (see the entry in this\nencyclopedia on Adorno, Zuidervaart 2008).  It is sometimes argued\nthat the unusual literary style of Dialectic itself is meant to\nexemplify such an attempt at escaping the ossification of thought (for\nan interpretation that generally takes such a view, see Honneth 2007).\nAlong somewhat similar lines, modern art might have emancipatory\npotential, in its ability to express something of the current state of\nsociety through means other than formal reasoning.  This is, again, a\nview that is commonly associated with Adorno’s thought.  But\nHorkheimer also presents such a view, especially in his 1941 essay\n“Art and Mass Culture.” There culture is criticized in a\nmanner similar to the discussion of the culture industry\nin Dialectic, and a largely pessimistic picture of the\nrestrictive and homogenizing role of contemporary mass culture is\npresented.  But Horkheimer does note that some art can break free of\nthis and still help the human being “conceive of a world\ndifferent from that in which he lives.” Such works (Horkheimer\nmentions Joyce’s literature and Picasso’s Guernica) can do so\nonly negatively, however, by displaying the difference between the\nhuman being and his or her “barbarous surrounding”\n(p. 278; on Horkheimer’s views on art see Jay 1993).  In the case both\nof non-ossifying thought and modern art, the emancipatory potential is\nfound only in traces, presented in an esoteric and perhaps abstruse\nmanner.  Such a conception of “emancipation” now seems to\nbe somewhat separated from the experience of the proletariat, and is\npossibly evidence of elitism (see Heller 2002).  Whatever one makes of\nthese criticisms, it is clear that Horkheimer was less than sanguine\nregarding the possibility of positive social change. \n\nHorkheimer does suggest another avenue for emancipatory social\nchange, however.  He notes in Eclipse that “there are some forces\nof resistance left within man,” and that “the spirit of humanity is\nstill alive, if not in the individual as a member of social groups, at\nleast in the individual as far as he is left alone” (p. 95).\n Unsurprisingly given the tone of the text as a whole, much of\nwhat follows that passage discusses the difficulty of separating\noneself from the homogenizing forces of society.  But Horkheimer\ndoes suggest that it is possible to engage in a kind of non-conformism\n(without much of a description of what it would be like), which comes\nthrough the “spontaneity of the individual subject” (p. 99).  The\nemphasis on individual action is tempered, however, through the\nemphasizing of a point that brings the latter parts of Eclipse back to\none of Horkheimer’s earliest views; solidarity can be formed through\nthe experience of shared suffering, and philosophy should “translate\nwhat [those who suffer in the face of oppression] have done into\nlanguage that will be heard” (p.109).  How this happens is unclear,\nas is the connection between individual acts of non-conformism and\nsolidarity.  One might also doubt the reliance on the power of\nthe compassion.  For a  thorough discussion of\nEclipse that examines these potential problems, see Lohmann 1993.\n Whatever one makes of these points, it is clear that this\nemphasis on suffering is the thread that ties all of the periods of\nHorkheimer’s work together, as it would continue to be present in\nHorkheimer’s last works. \n\nWith his return to Frankfurt the year after the publication of both\nEclipse of Reason and Dialectic of Enlightenment,\nHorkheimer’s academic production would largely consist of essays and\nlectures.  He also left a number of unpublished texts from the period,\nincluding a set of notes and aphorisms published shortly after his\ndeath (along with a set of aphorisms from the early 30s titled\nDämmerung) under the name Notizen 1950 bis 1969.\n There is no real systematic unity to these writings (Habermas\n1993, p. 51 even refers to them as “shot through with contradictions”),\nbut there are common themes that can be explored. \n\nOne can, for instance, trace out Horkheimer’s late views on the tasks\nof critical theory.  In a remark in Notizen from\n1957–1958 titled “Critical Theory,” he pursues the\nidea mentioned in the preface to Eclipse that philosophy need\nnot be immediately related to practical action.  Philosophy\n“holds up a mirror to the world” but “it is no\nimperative” (p. 148).  It is as though Horkheimer wants to guard\nagainst a caricature of his earlier views as blindly equating theory\nand practice.  But there is also a very pessimistic note sounded when\nHorkheimer says that philosophy “has replaced theology but found\nno new heaven to which it might point, not even a heaven on\nearth” (p.  148).  Horkheimer touches on these same themes in\nhis 1956 conversations with Adorno in which they preliminarily\ndiscussed producing a new (never finished) joint work.  In the\ntranscripts of those conversations (which were published in 1989 as a\npart of Horkheimer’s collected works with the title\n“Diskussion über Theorie und Praxis”) one\nfinds Horkheimer continually stressing the importance of linking\ntheory to practice without reducing the former to the latter.  And\nwhile he does at points seem to hold out a vague hope for such a\ncombination of theory and practice, he also pessimistically claims\nthat “it is easy to believe that the whole of world history is\njust a fly caught in the flames” (p.39).  Because of this\npessimism, critical theory takes on a primarily negative task.  In\nanother note from a collection dated 1966–1969 titled “On\nCritical Theory” he continues with the idea that no positive\nconception of the good can be formed, but “if one wishes to\ndefine the good as the attempt to abolish evil,” such a view can\nbe formed, and “this is the teaching of Critical Theory”\n(p. 237).  \n\nThe negative conception of critical theory is closely related to the\nrenewed interest Horkheimer showed in Schopenhauer in his last works.\nSchopenhauer is said, in the 1961 essay “Schopenhauer\nToday,” to be “the teacher for modern times”\n(p. 81).  This is in part because Schopenhauer’s work grasps the need\nto focus on the suffering of the present as it is, without covering it\nover with a false philosophical conception of the good.  To a certain\nextent this repeats the earlier emphasis on suffering and rejection of\nmetaphysics.  But these points work in a much more pessimistic\ndirection, because, “according to Schopenhauer, philosophy does\nnot set up any practical aims” (p. 80).  It rather focuses on\ncorrectly grasping suffering.  Schopenhauerian pessimism also connects\nwith an interest in negative theology in Horkheimer’s late work.  In\n1935, he would write that the religious belief in another world of\nperfect justice, when uncoupled from “the inhibiting religious\nform” amounted to a positive force for social change (Horkheimer\n1935c, p.  131).  In his late writings this combination of criticism\nof organized religion and respect for the desire for the “wholly\nother” would be further developed (see Siebert 1976).  In\nreligious beliefs, if not in organized religion, Horkheimer would find\na desire for a better world that never forgets the suffering of this\nworld (see, for instance, Horkheimer 1963). \n\nThe overall tenor of Horkheimer’s last writings has led some to\ncriticize him for falling into a backhanded form of conservatism (see,\nfor example, Bronner 1994, pp. 88–92).  This criticism makes\nsome sense, especially when one considers the political climate of the\nlate 1960s that served as a backdrop for his latest work.  It is\npertinent, along these lines, that he was generally opposed to the\nradical student movements, and he supported (with much qualification)\nthe Vietnam War as an attempt to halt the totalitarian movement of\nChinese Communism (on these points see Stirk 1992, 178–181).\nBut Horkheimer did not give up on the possibility of radical action\nentirely.  For example, Notizen ends on something of a positive\nnote by ( in the note “For Nonconformism”) holding out\nhope that the “critical analysis of demagogues” might aid\nthe practical work of those who are attempting to create\nnon-conformist collectives that work against current society.  But the\nprimary possibility for hope discussed in Horkheimer’s later work is\ncompassion, as seen at the end of the 1961 essay “The German\nJews”: \n\nIn a way, this passage sums up the aim of all of Horkheimer’s work,\nearly to late.  The task of education, and the task of the\ncritical theorist, is to foster such compassionate sensitivity to\ninjustice.","contact.mail":"jberendz@loyno.edu","contact.domain":"loyno.edu"}]
