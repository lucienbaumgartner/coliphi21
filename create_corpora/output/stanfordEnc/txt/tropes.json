Tropes are things like the particular shape, weight, and\ntexture of an individual object. Because tropes are particular, for\ntwo objects to ‘share’ a property (for them both to\nexemplify, say, a particular shade of green) is for each to contain\n(instantiate, exemplify) a greenness-trope, where those\ngreenness-tropes, although numerically distinct, nevertheless exactly\nresemble each other.\n\n\nApart from this very thin core assumption—that there are\ntropes—different trope theories need not have very much in\n common.[1]\n Most trope theorists (but not all) believe\nthat—fundamentally—there is nothing but tropes. Most trope\ntheorists (but, again, not all) hold that resemblance between concrete\nparticulars is to be explained in terms of resemblance between their\nrespective tropes. And most (but not all) hold that resemblance\nbetween tropes is determined by their primitive intrinsic nature.\n\n\nThat there are tropes seems prima facie reasonable if we\nreflect on such things as perception (I don’t see color in\ngeneral, but the color of this object) and causation (it’s the\nweight of this object that leaves an impression in the palm of my\nhand, not weight in general). Yet, neither perception nor causation\nmanage to distinguish between a theory positing tropes and one\npositing, e.g., states of affairs (universal-exemplifications), which\nmeans that the support they provide in favor of tropes is weak at\nbest. Prima facie reasons to one side, no matter which terms\nthey use to characterize their posits, most trope theorists agree that\ntropes occupy a ‘middle position’ in between universal\nrealism and classical nominalism, something they believe allows them\nto reap all the benefits of both of those views without having to\nsuffer any of their disadvantages. More precisely, in accepting the\nexistence of properties (or, at least, something\n‘property-like’), the trope theorist accepts an ontology\nthat is fine-grained enough to be able to explain how distinct\nconcrete particulars can be simultaneously similar to, and different\nfrom, each other (something the classical nominalist arguably fails to\ndo, cf. Armstrong 1978). And in rejecting the existence of\nuniversals, she avoids having to accept the existence of a kind of\nentity many find mysterious, counterintuitive, and\n‘unscientific’ (Schaffer 2001: 249f; Molnar 2003:\n22–25; and Armstrong 2005: 310).\n\n\nIn this entry, reasons both for and against the existence of tropes\nare surveyed. As we shall see, what those reasons are, and how well\nthey manage to support (or cause trouble for) the trope-theoretical\nthesis, depends on which version of the trope view they concern. Much\nof the entry will therefore be dedicated to distinguishing different\nversions of the theory from each other, and to see what costs and\nbenefits adopting either version brings with it. \n\nThe father of the contemporary debate on tropes was D. C. Williams\n(1953; 1963; 1986; 1997[1953];\n 2018).[2]\n Williams defends a one-category theory of tropes (for the first time\nso labeled), a bundle theory of concrete particulars, and a\nresemblance class theory of universals. All of which are now elements\nof the so-called ‘standard’ view of tropes. Who to count\namong Williams’ trope-theoretical predecessors is unavoidably\ncontentious. It depends on one’s views on the nature of the\ntrope itself, as well as on which theses, besides the thesis that\ntropes exist, one is prepared to accept as part of a trope—or\ntrope-like—theory.  \nAccording to some philosophers, trope theory has roots going back at\nleast to Aristotle (possibly to Plato, perhaps even to the\npre-socratics, cf. Mertz 1996: 83–118). In the\nCategories, Aristotle points out that Substance and Quality\nboth come in what we may call a universal and a particular variety\n(man and this man in the case of substance, and\npallor and this pale—to ti leukon—in the\ncase of quality). Not everyone believe that this means that Aristotle\naccepts the existence of tropes, however. On one interpretation (Owen\n1965) this pale names an absolutely determinate, yet\nperfectly shareable, shade of pallor. But on a more traditional\ninterpretation (cf. e.g., Ackrill 1963), it picks out a\ntrope, i.e., a particular ‘bit’ of pallor peculiar to the\nsubstance that happens to exemplify it (for a discussion, cf.\nCohen 2013). In view of the strong Aristotelian influence on medieval\nthinkers, it is perhaps not surprising that tropes or trope-like\nentities are found also here (often mentioned in this connection are\nAquinas, Duns Scotus, Ockham, and Suarez). And in early modern\nphilosophy, entities resembling tropes can be found in the works of\ne.g., Leibniz and\n Locke.[3] \nStill, it is in the writings of 19th century\nphenomenological philosophers that the earliest and most systematic\npre-Williams ‘trope’-theories are found (Mulligan et al.\n1984: 293). The clearest example of an early trope theorist of this\nvariety is undoubtedly Edmund Husserl. In the third part of his\nLogical Investigations (2001[1900/1913]), Husserl sets out\nhis theory of moments, which is his name for the\nworld’s abstract (and essentially dependent) individual parts\n(Correia 2004; Beyer 2016). Husserl was most likely heavily influenced\nby Bolzano, who held that everything real is either a substance or an\nadherence, i.e., an attribute that cannot be shared (Bolzano\n 1950[1851]).[4]\n Husserl thought of his moments as (one of) the fundamental\nconstituents of phenomenal reality. This was also how fellow\nphenomenologists G. F. Stout (1921;\n 1952),[5]\n Roman Ingarden (1964[1947–1948]) and Ivar Segelberg\n (1999[1945;1947;1953])[6]\n viewed their fundamental and trope-like posits. Williams’ views\nare not so easily classified. Although he maintained that all our\nknowledge rests on perceptual experience, he agreed that it should not\nbe limited to the perceptually given and that it could be extended\nbeyond that by legitimate inference (Campbell et al. 2015). That more\nor less all post-Williams proponents of tropes treat their\nposits as the fundamental constituents of\nmind-independent—not phenomenal—reality, is\nhowever clear (cf. e.g., Heil 2003).  \nAfter Williams, the second most influential trope theorist is arguably\nKeith Campbell (1997[1981]; 1990). Campbell adopted the basics of\nWilliams’ (standard) theory and then further developed and\ndefended it. Later proponents of more or less standard versions of the\ntrope view include Peter Simons, John Bacon, Anna-Sofia Maurin,\nDouglas Ehring, Jonathan Schaffer, Kris McDaniel, Markku Keinänen,\nJani Hakkarainen, Marta Ujvári, Daniel Giberman and Robert K. Garcia\n(all of whose most central works on the topic are listed in the\nBibliography). A very influential paper also arguing for a version of\nthe theory (inspired more by Husserl than by Williams) is\n“Truth-Makers” (Mulligan et al. 1984; cf. also\nDenkel 1996). This paper defends the view that tropes are essentially\ndependent entities, the objects of perception, and the world’s\nbasic truthmakers. Proponents of trope theories which posit tropes as\none of several fundamental categories include C. B. Martin\n(1980), John Heil (2003), George Molnar (2003), and Jonathan Lowe\n(2006). Molnar and Heil both defend ontologies that include (but are\nnot limited to) tropes understood as powers, and Lowe counts tropes as\none of four fundamental categories. Even more unorthodox are\nthe views of D. W. Mertz (1996, 2016), whose trope-like entities are\ncategorized as a kind of\n relation.[7] \nAccording to several trope theorists, what exists when a trope does is\nan abstract particular. Williams—who coined the\nphrase—was also acutely aware of its potential to confuse.\nTropes, he was careful to point out, although ‘abstract’\nare not: “the product of a magical feat of mind”,\n“the denzien of some remote immaterial eternity”,\n“imprecise”, “the mental”, “the\nrational”, “the incorporeal”, “the ideally\nperfect”, “the non-temporal”, “the primordial\nor ultimate”, “the deficient”, “the\npotential”, “the unreal”, “the symbolic,\nfigurative or merely representative”, or “the vague,\nconfused and indefinite” (Williams, 1997[1953]: 121;\ncf. also his 1953: 174f.). This, he explained, is because the\nvarious senses people have given to the term ‘abstract’\ncan be traced back to two main sources—that which transcends\nindividual existence and that which is partial, incomplete or\nfragmentary—where the source of the trope’s\nabstractness is of the latter kind only. Campbell agrees. According to\nhim, more precisely, tropes are abstract because they\n“(ordinarily) occur in conjunction with many other instances of\nqualities”, which is why they can only be “brought before\nthe mind…by a process of selection, of systematic setting aside, of\nthese other qualities of which we are aware” (Campbell 1990:\n2). \nUnfortunately, as soon as the sense in which tropes are abstract has\nbeen thus disambiguated, it becomes less clear in what sense being\ntold that tropes are abstract informs us about their (unique)\nnature. For isn’t it true of anything (short of everything) that\nattending to it involves abstracting it away from the surrounding\nenvironment?[8]\nTo further confuse matters, quite a few trope proponents (cf.\ne.g., Küng 1967 and Giberman 2014) characterize the trope as\nconcrete, and Simons (1994: 557) thinks tropes are\nboth abstract and concrete. The trope’s nature is hence\nnot easy to pin down. To further demonstrate this fact, the rest of\nthis section surveys debates on what kind of thing the trope\nis, whether the trope is (in)dependent of the object that\n‘has’ it, whether tropes can be simple, and how best to\nindividuate tropes. \nIn philosophy, new posits are regularly introduced by being compared\nwith, or likened to, an already familiar item. Tropes are no exception\nto this rule. In fact, tropes have been introduced by being compared\nwith and likened to not one but two distinct but equally\nfamiliar kinds of things: properties and objects (Loux 2015). Up until\nvery recently, that tropes can be introduced in both of these ways was\nconsidered a feature of the theory, not a source of concern. Tropes,\nit was thought, can be compared with and likened to both properties\nand objects, because tropes are a bit of both.  \nRecently, however, both friends and foes of tropes have started to\nquestion whether tropes can be a bit of both. At any rate,\nthis will depend on what being a property and being an\nobject amounts to, an issue on which there is no clear consensus.\nLooking more closely at existing versions of the trope view, whether\none thinks of one’s posit primarily as a kind of property or as\na kind of object certainly influences what one takes to be true (or\nnot) of it. To see this, compare the tropes defended by Williams, with\nthose defended by Mulligan et al. Williams seems to belong to the camp\nof those who view the trope (primarily) as a kind of object. Tropes\nare that out of which everything else there is, is constructed. As a\nconsequence, names for tropes should not be understood as abbreviated\ndefinite descriptions of the kind “the Φ-ness of\nx”. Instead, to name a trope should be likened with\nbaptizing a child or with introducing a man “present in the\nflesh”, i.e., ostensively (Williams 1997[1953]: 114). Mulligan\net al. (1984), on the other hand, seem to regard the trope more as a\nkind of property, and as a consequence of this, argue to the contrary\nthat the correct (in fact the only) way to refer to tropes is\nprecisely by way of expressions such as “the Φ-ness of\nx”. This, they claim (again pace Williams), is\nbecause tropes are essentially of some object, because they\nare ways the objects are (cf. also Heil 2003: 126f).\nIn general, a theory which models its posit primarily on the property\nhence thinks of it as a dependent sort of entity, as of\nsomething else. And a theory which thinks of its tropes more as\nobjects—as ‘the alphabet of being’—thinks of\nthem as independent, either in the sense that they need not make up\nthe things they actually make up, or—more radically—in the\nsense that they need not make up anything at all (that they could be\nso-called ‘free-floaters’). \nHow one views the nature of properties and objects, respectively, also\nplays a role for some of the criticisms the trope view has had to\nface. According to e.g., Levinson, tropes cannot be a kind of property\n(Levinson 1980: 107). This is because, according to him, having a\nproperty—being red—amounts to being in a certain\ncondition. And conditions do not lend themselves well to\nparticularization. The alternative is that tropes are what he calls\n“qualities”, by which he means something resembling bits\nof abstract stuff. However, positing bits of stuff like that, he later\nargues, would be “ontologically extravagant and conceptually\noutlandish”. Tropes, then, are\nneither a kind of property nor a kind of object. A\ncircumstance that makes Levinson conclude that tropes do not exist\n(2006: 564).  \nAccording to Chrudzimski (2002), next, although tropes can be\nviewed either as a kind of property or as a kind of object, they\ncannot be both. Which means that the theory loses its coveted\n‘middle-position’, and with it any advantage it might have\nhad over rival views. For, he argues, to conceptualize the trope as a\nproperty—a way things are—means imputing in it a\npropositional structure (Levinson 1980: 107 holds a similar\nview). Not so if the trope is understood as a kind of object. But,\nthen, although tropes understood as properties are suitable as\nsemantically efficient truthmakers, the same is not true of tropes\nunderstood as a kind of object. Conversely, although tropes understood\nas a kind of object are suitable candidates for being that from which\nboth concrete particulars and abstract universals are constructed,\ntropes understood as properties are not. Whichever way we conceive of\ntropes, therefore, the theory’s overall appeal is severely\ndiminished.  \nBoth Levinson’s and Chrudzimski’s pessimistic conclusions\ncan arguably be resisted. One option is simply to refuse to accept\nthat one cannot seriously propose that there are “abstract\nstuffs”. Levinson offers us little more than an incredulous\nstare in defense of this claim, and incredulous stares are well-known\nfor lacking the force to convince those not similarly\nincredulous. Another option is to reject the claim that tropes\nunderstood as properties must be propositionally structured. Or, more\nspecifically, to reject the claim that complex truths need\ncomplex—(again)\npropositionally structured— truthmakers. Some\ntruthmaker theorists—not surprisingly, Mulligan et\nal. (1984) are among them—reject this claim. In so doing,\nthey avoid having to draw the sorts of conclusions to which Levinson\nand (perhaps especially) Chrudzimski gesture.\n  A more radical option, finally, is to simply reject the idea that\ntropes can be informatively categorized either as a kind of property\nor as a kind of object. Part of the problem is that some of the\nfeatures we want to attribute to tropes seem to cut across those\ncategories anyhow. So, for instance, if you think ‘being\nshareable’ is essential to ‘being a property’, then,\nobviously, tropes are not properties. Yet tropes, even if not\nshareable, can still be ways objects are, and they can still\nessentially depend on the objects that have them.  Likewise, if\n‘monopolizing one’s position in space-time’ is\nunderstood as a central trait for objects, tropes are not objects. Yet\ntropes can still be the independent building-blocks out of which\neverything else there is, is constructed. According to Garcia (2016), this is why we ought to frame our\ndiscussion of the nature(s) of tropes in terms of another\ndistinction. More precisely, he argues, rather than distinguishing\nbetween tropes understood as a kind of property, and tropes understood\nas a kind of object—and risk getting caught up in infected\ndebates about the nature of objects and properties generally—we\nshould distinguish between tropes understood as\n‘modifiers’ and tropes understood as\n‘modules’. The main difference between tropes understood\nin these two ways—a difference that is the source of a great\nmany further differences—is that tropes understood as modifiers\ndo not have the character they confer (on objects), whereas tropes\nunderstood as modules do. With recourse to this way of distinguishing\nbetween different versions of the trope-view, Garcia argues, we can\nnow evaluate each version separately, independently of how we view\nobjects and properties,\n respectively.[9] \nAccording to most proponents of tropes, tropes are ontologically\nsimple.[10]\nHere this should be taken to mean that tropes have no constituents, in\nthe sense that they are not ‘made up’ or\n‘built’ from entities belonging to some other\ncategory. Simple tropes, thus understood, can still have\nparts—even necessarily so—as long as those parts are also\ntropes (cf. e.g., Robb 2005:\n 469).[11],\n [12] \nThat tropes are ontologically simple can be seen as providing the\ntrope theorist with a tie-breaker vis-à-vis states of affairs\n(at least if those are understood as substrates instantiating\nuniversals). Such a tie-breaker is needed because, at least prima\nfacie, a theory positing states of affairs has the same\nexplanatory power as does one positing tropes. But a theory of states\nof affairs invokes—apart from the state of affairs\nitself—at least two (fundamental) sorts of things (universals\nand substrates), whereas a theory of tropes (at least a theory of\ntropes according to which tropes are simple, and objects are bundles\nof tropes) invokes only one (tropes). From the point of view of\nontological parsimony, therefore, the trope view ought to be\npreferred.[13] \nCan the trope be simple? According to a number of the\ntheory’s critics, it cannot. Here is Hochberg’s argument\nto that effect (2004: 39; cf. also his 2001: 178–179; a\nsimilar argument can be found in Brownstein 1973: 47 and Armstrong\n2005: 310): \nLet a basic proposition be one that is either atomic or the negation\nof an atomic proposition. Then consider tropes t and\nt* where “t is different from\nt*” and “t is exactly similar to\nt*” are both true. Assume you take either\n“diversity” or “identity” as primitive. Then\nboth propositions are basic propositions. But they are logically\nindependent. Hence, they cannot have the same truth makers. Yet,\nfor…trope theory /…/ they do and must have the same\ntruth makers. Thus the theory fails. \nEhring presents two (kinds of) arguments against the simplicity of\ntropes. The first is a version of Hochberg’s argument,\nbut—importantly—is not formulated in terms of truthmakers\n(Ehring 2011: 179–180, cf. also Moreland 2001: 70–71): \nArgument 1: If a and b are related by\narbitrarily different internal relations then a and\nb are not simple. Trope t is numerically different\nfrom trope t* and t resembles t* exactly.\nExact resemblance and numerical difference are internal relations that\nare arbitrarily different from each other. Hence t and\nt* are not\n simple.[14] \nEhring’s second argument is inspired by an argument first\ndelivered by Moreland (2001: 64). Moreland’s argument concludes\nthat trope theory is unintelligible. Ehring thinks this is much too\nstrong. This is therefore the formulation of the objection he prefers\n(2011: 180): \nArgument 2: The nature and particularity of a trope are\nintrinsically grounded in that trope. If tropes are simple, their\nnature and their particularity are hence identical. The natures of a\nred trope and an orange trope are inexactly similar. Hence their\nrespective particularities should be inexactly similar as well.\nHowever, these particularities are exactly similar. Hence,\ntheir particularities are not identical to their natures, and tropes\nare not simple. \nA number of different things can be said in response to these\narguments. According to Hochberg’s argument, first, if tropes\nare simple, trope theory must violate what appears to be a truly\nfundamental principle (call it HP, short for ‘Hochberg’s\nprinciple’): logically independent basic propositions must\nhave distinct\n truthmakers.[15]\n Having to reject HP is hence a cost of having simple tropes. Perhaps\nthe cost is acceptable. That it is—indeed that there are\ncircumstances which speak in favor of rejecting HP—seems to be\naccepted by Mulligan et al. (a similar view is, according to Armstrong\n2005: 310 also held by Robb). For, they claim (1984: 296): \n…[w]e conceive it as in principle possible that one and the same\ntruth-maker may make true sentences with different meanings: this\nhappens anyway if we take non-atomic sentences into account, and no\narguments occur to us which suggest that this cannot happen for atomic\nsentences as well. \nA positive reason for thinking that HP does not hold in general has\nbeen provided by MacBride (2004, cf. also (in response to\nEhring’s first argument) Hakkarainen and Keinänen 2017).\nAccording to Hochberg, to be able to conclude whether one truth-maker\ncan make true two propositions, we must first consider whether those\ntwo propositions are formally independent or not. But, MacBride points\nout, just considering formal (in)dependence is not enough. We\nmust also consider whether the propositions in question are\nmaterially independent. Only if they are, thinks MacBride,\ndoes it follow from the fact that they are independent, that they must\nhave distinct\n truthmakers.[16]\n However, formal and material independence can—and in this case\nmost likely will—come apart. For (ibid: 190): \n…[i]nsofar as truth-makers are conceived as inhabitants of the\nworld, as creatures that exist independently of language, it is far\nfrom evident that logically independent statements in the formal sense\nare compelled to correspond to distinct truth-makers. \nAs for Ehring’s second argument, Ehring himself (2011: 180ff.)\noffers up a number of different replies (none of which he himself\nfinds satisfactory). The most convincing response available to the\ntrope theorist is most likely to claim that the objection rests on a\nkind of ‘category mistake’ in that\n‘particularities’ are not things amenable to standing in\nsimilarity relations in the first place. \nCould not the trope theorist concede that tropes are complex, yet\nargue that they are so in the innocent sense of having other tropes as\nparts? According to Ehring, she could not. For, he argues (2011:\n183f), if the trope has its particularity reside in one of the tropes\nthat make it up, we can always ask about that trope what\ngrounds its particularity and quality respectively. Again, we\nmust point to the parts of the trope in question. And so on, ad\ninfinitum. That this regress is benign seems highly\n questionable.[17],\n [18] \nWhat makes two tropes, existing in the same world, at the same time,\ndistinct? To ask this question is to ask for a principle of\nindividuation for tropes. A natural suggestion is that we take the way\nwe normally identify and refer to tropes very literally, and\nindividuate tropes with reference to the objects that\n‘have’ \nthem:[19] \nObject Individuation (OI):\n\nFor any tropes a and b such that a exactly\nresembles b, a ≠ b iff a\nbelongs to an object that is distinct from the object to which\nb belongs. \nWhether this account is really informative can however be\nquestioned. For, at least if objects are bundles of tropes, the\nindividuation of objects will depend on the individuation of the\ntropes that make them up, which means that, on OI, individuation\nbecomes circular (Lowe 1998: 206f.; Schaffer 2001: 249; Ehring 2011:\n77). Indeed, matters improve only marginally if objects are understood\nas substrates in which tropes are instantiated. For, although on this\nview, individuation can be non-circularly accounted for, this is\nbecause it is now the substrate which carries the individuating\nburden. This leaves the individuation of the substrate still\nunaccounted for, and so we appear to have gotten nowhere (Mertz\n2001). Any trope theorist who accepts the possible existence of\n‘free-floating’ tropes—i.e., tropes that exist\nunattached to any object—must in any case reject this\naccount of trope individuation (at least as long as she accepts the\npossibility of there being more than one free-floating trope\nat any given time). For these reasons, although some of the things\ntrope theorists have said may make it sound as if they endorse OI, no\ntrope theorist has come out ‘in public’ to state that she\ndoes. \nThe main-contenders are instead spatiotemporal individuation\n(SI) and primitivist individuation (PI). According to SI,\nfirst, that two tropes belonging to the same world are distinct can be\nmetaphysically explained with reference to a difference in their\nrespective spatiotemporal position (Campbell 1990: 53f.; Lowe 1998:\n207; Schaffer 2001: 249): \nSpatiotemporal Individuation (SI):\n\nFor any tropes a and b such that a exactly\nresemble b, a ≠ b iff a is at\nnon-zero distance from b. \nThis is an account of trope individuation that seems to respect the\nway tropes are normally picked out, yet which does\nnot—circularly—individuate tropes with reference to the\nobjects they make up and which does not rule out the existence of\n‘free-floaters’. In spite of this, the majority of the\ntrope theorists (Schaffer 2001 being an important exception) have\nopted instead for primitivism (cf.  Schaffer 2001: 248 and\nEhring 2011: 76; cf. also Campbell 1990: 69; Keinänen &\nHakkarainen 2014). Primitivism is best understood as the denial of the\nidea that there is any true and informative way of filling out the\nbiconditional “For any exactly resembling tropes a\nand b, a ≠ b iff\n…”. That a and b are distinct—if\nthey are—is hence primitive. It has no further (ontological)\nanalysis or (metaphysical) explanation.\n \nAccording to what is probably the most influential argument in favor\nof PI over SI (an argument that changed Campbell’s mind:\ncf. his 1990: 55f.; cf. also Moreland 1985: 65), SI\nshould be abandoned because it rules out the (non-empty) possibility\nthat (parts of) reality could be\n non-spatiotemporal.[20]\n Against this, proponents of SI have argued that the thesis that\nreality must be spatiotemporal can be independently justified\n(primarily because naturalism can be independently justified,\ncf. Schaffer 2001: 251). And even if it cannot, SI could\neasily be modified to accommodate the analogue of the\nlocational order of space (Campbell 1997[1981]: 136; Schaffer\n ibid.).[21] \nA common argument in favor of SI is that it allows its\nproponents to rule out what most agree are empty\npossibilities: swapping and piling.  \nSwapping: According to the so-called ‘swapping\nargument’ (first formulated in Armstrong 1989: 131–132;\ncf. also Schaffer 2001: 250f; Ehring 2011:\n 78f.),[22]\n if properties are tropes, and individuation is primitive, two\ndistinct yet exactly similar tropes might swap places (this redness\nhere might have been there, and vice versa). The\nresult, post-swap, is a situation that is ontologically distinct from\nthat pre-swap. However, empirically/causally the pre- and post-swap\nsituations are nevertheless the same (cf. LaBossiere 1993:\n262 and Denkel 1996: 173f. for arguments to the contrary). That is,\ngiven the natural laws as we know them, that this\nred-trope here swaps places with that\nred-trope there makes no difference to the future evolution\nof things. Which means that, not only would the world look, feel and\nsmell exactly the same to us pre- and post-swap, it would be in\nprinciple impossible to construct a device able to distinguish the two\nsituations from one another. The reason for this is precisely that any\ndevice able to detect the (primitive) difference between the two\nsituations would have be able to somehow communicate this difference\n(say, by making a sound, by turning a handle, or …). But since\nwhether this red-trope here is there or not makes no\ndifference to the future evolution of things, it can make no\ndifference to whatever the device does when we turn it on\n(cf. Dasgupta 2009). This makes admitting the possibility of\nswapping seem unnecessary. If we also accept the (arguably reasonable)\nEleatic principle according to which only changes that matter\nempirically/causally should count as genuine, we can draw the even\nstronger conclusion that swapping is not genuinely possible, and,\nhence, that any account of individuation from which it follows that it\nis, should be \nabandoned.[23] \nTo accept SI does not immediately block swapping (Schaffer 2001: 250).\nFor, SI (just like OI and PI) is a principle about trope individuation\nthat holds\nintra-worldly. In this case: within any given world, no two\nexactly similar tropes are at zero distance from each other. Swapping,\non the other hand, concerns what is possibly true (or not) of exactly\nsimilar tropes considered inter-worldly. But this means that,\nalthough SI does not declare swapping possible, it doesn’t rule\nit out either. According to the proponent of SI, this is actually a\ngood thing. For there is one possibility that it would be unfortunate\nif one’s principle of individuation did block, namely\nthe possibility—called sliding—that this\nred-trope here could have been there had the wind\nblown differently (Schaffer 2001: 251). To get the desired result\n(i.e., to block swapping while allowing for sliding), Schaffer\nsuggests we combine trope theory with SI and a Lewisian\ncounterpart theory of transworld identity (Lewis 1986). The result is\nan account according to which exactly resembling tropes are\nintra-worldly identical if they inhabit the same position in\nspace-time. And according to which they are inter-worldly\ncounterparts, if they are distinct, yet stand in sufficiently similar\ndistance- and other types of relations to their respective\n(intra-worldly) neighbors. With this addition in place, Schaffer\nclaims, a trope theory which individuates its posits with reference to\ntheir spatiotemporal position will make room for the\npossibility of sliding, because (2001: 253): \nOn the counterfactual supposition of a shift in wind, what results is\na redness exactly like the actual one, which is in perfectly\nisomorphic resemblance relations to its worldmates as the actual one\nis to its worldmates, with just a slight difference in distance with\nrespect to, e.g., the roundness of the moon. \n…yet it won’t allow for the possibility of\nswapping, because: \n…the nearest relative of the redness of the rose which is\nhere at our world would be the redness still here\n‘post-swap’. The redness which would be here has exactly\nthe same inter- and intraworld resemblance relations as the redness\nwhich actually is here, and the same distance relations, and hence is\na better counterpart than the redness which would be\nthere. \nThis is not in itself a reason to prefer SI over PI, however. For, PI,\njust like SI, is an inter-worldly principle of individuation, which\nmeans that it, just like SI, could be combined with a Lewisian\ncounterpart theory, thereby preventing swapping yet making room for\nsliding. It is, in other words, the counterpart theory, and not SI (or\nPI), which does all the work. In any case, it is not clear that\nintra-worldly swapping is an empty possibility. According to\nEhring, there are circumstances in which a series of slidings\nconstitute one case of swapping, something that he thinks would make\nswapping more a reason for than against PI (Ehring 2011:\n81–85). \nPiling: Even if swapping does not give us a reason to prefer\nSI over PI, perhaps its close cousin ‘piling’ does.\nConsider a particular red rose. Given trope theory, this rose is red\nbecause it is partly constituted by a redness-trope. But what is to\nprevent more than one—even indefinitely\nmany—exactly similar red-tropes from partly constituting this\nrose? Given PI: nothing. It is however far from clear how one could\nempirically detect that the rose has more than one redness trope, just\nlike it is not clear how one could empirically detect how many redness\ntropes it has, provided it has more than one. This is primarily\nbecause it is far from clear how having more than one redness trope\ncould make a causal difference in the world. But if piling makes no\nempirical/causal difference, then given a (plausible) Eleatic\nprinciple, the possibility of piling is empty, which means that PI\nought to be rejected (Armstrong 1978: 86; cf. also Simons\n1994: 558; Schaffer 2001: 254,\nfn. 11). \nIn defense of PI, its proponents now point to a special case of\npiling, called ‘pyramiding’ (an example being a 5 kg\nobject consisting of five 1 kg tropes). Pyramiding does seem\ngenuinely possible. Yet, if piling is ruled out, so is pyramiding\n(Ehring 2011: 87ff.; cf. also Armstrong 1997: 64f.; Daly\n1997: 155). According to Schaffer, this is fine. For, although\nadmittedly not quite as objectionable as other types of piling (which\nhe calls ‘stacking’), pyramiding faces a serious problem\nwith predication: if admitted, it will be true of the 5 kg object that\n“It has the property of weighing 1 kg” (Schaffer 2001:\n254). Against this, Ehring has pointed out that to say of the 5 kg\nobject that “It has the property of weighing 1 kg” is at\nmost pragmatically odd, and that, even if this oddness is regarded as\nunacceptable, to avoid it would not require the considerable\ncomplication of one’s theory of predication imagined by Schaffer\n(Ehring 2011: 88–91).  \nAccording to Schaffer, the best argument for the possibility of\npiling—hence the best argument against SI—is rather\nprovided by the existence of so-called bosons (photons being one\nexample). Bosons are entitites which do not obey Pauli’s\nExclusion Principle, and hence such that two or more bosons\ncan occupy the same quantum state. A ‘one-high’\nboson-pile is hence empirically distinguishable from a\n‘two-high’ one, which means that the possibility of piling\nin general is not ruled out even if we accept an Eleatic\nprinciple. Schaffer (2001: 255) suggests we solve this problem for SI\nby considering the wave—not the particle/boson—as the way\nthe object ‘really’ is.  But this solution comes with\ncomplications of its own for the proponent of SI. For, “[t]he\nwave function lives in configuration space rather than physical space,\nand the ontology of the wave function, its relation to physical space,\nand its relation to the relativistic conception of spacetime which SI\nso naturally fits remain deeply mysterious” (Schaffer 2001:\n256). \nAs we have seen, tropes can be conceptualized, not just as\nparticularized ways things are, but also—and on some\nversions of trope theory, primarily—as that out of which\neverything else there is, is constructed. Minimally, this means that\ntropes must fulfill at least two constructive tasks: that of making up\n(the equivalent of) the realist’s universal, and that of making\nup (the equivalent of) the nominalist’s concrete particular. \nHow can distinct things have one thing in common? This is the problem\nof ‘the One over Many’ (cf. Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2000). Universals provide a straightforward solution to this problem:\nDistinct things can have one thing in common, because there is\none thing—the universal—which characterizes each\nof them individually. The trope theorist—at least if she does\nnot accept the existence of universals in addition to\n tropes[24]—does\n not have recourse to entities that can be likewise identical in\ndistinct instances, and must therefore come up with a slightly more\ncomplicated solution to this problem. She must ‘build’\nsomething able to do the same problem-solving work the universal does,\nusing only tropes. \nAccording to standard trope theory, two objects, a and\nb, ‘share’ a\nproperty—F-ness— if at least one of\nof the tropes that make up a belongs to the same (exact) resemblance\nclass as does at least one of the tropes that make up b (cf.\nWilliams 1997[1953]: 117–118; Campbell 1990: 31f.). The majority of\nthe trope theorists agree that exact resemblance is to be formally\ncharacterized as an equivalence relation (although\ncf. Mormann 1995 for an alternative view), i.e., as a\nrelation that is symmetrical, reflexive, and\ntransitive. As such, exact resemblance partitions the set of\ntropes into mutually excluding and non-overlapping classes; classes\nfunctioning more or less as the traditional universal does. \nWhat does this entail with respect to what exists? Two different\nanswers have been\n proposed.[25]\n Either, what exists when distinct tropes ‘share’ a\nproperty is nothing but the resembling tropes themselves, or it is\nthose same tropes plus a (trope-)relation of exact resemblance. Both\nsuggestions have been rejected by the theory’s critics. \nThe most convincing reason for thinking that nothing but the\nresembling tropes is needed in order to account for the phenomenon of\nsameness of property, is provided by (one aspect of) the nature of\nresemblance itself. Resemblance is an internal relation; it\nsupervenes on whatever it relates. Once two tropes exist, therefore,\nso must their (degree of) resemblance. Given a\n‘sparse’ ontology, only what is minimally required to make\ntrue all truths exists. Sparse ontologies can be independently\njustified (cf. Schaffer 2004 and Armstrong 1978). Therefore,\nwhat exists when distinct tropes resemble each other—and so what\nplays the role of the realist’s universal—is nothing but\nthe resembling tropes themselves (Williams 1963: 608; Campbell 1990:\n37f.; cf. also Armstrong 1989:\n 56).[26] \nAlternatively, exact resemblance has been regarded as a\n(relation-)trope, and hence as an addition to the tropes it relates.\nThe main problem with this view is that it appears to gives rise to a\nversion of Russell’s famous resemblance regress (first\nformulated in his 1997 [1912]: 48; cf. also Küng 1967).\nIn Daly’s words (1997: 149): \nConsider three concrete particulars which are the same shade of\nred…each of these concrete particulars has a red\ntrope—call these tropes F, G, and\nH—and these concrete particulars exactly resemble each\nother in colour because F, G, and H exactly\nresemble each other in colour. But it seems that this account is\nincomplete. It seems that the account should further claim that\nresemblance tropes hold between F, G, and\nH. That is, it seems that there are resemblance tropes\nholding between the members of the pairs F and G,\nG and H, and F and H… Let\nus call the resemblance tropes in question R1,\nR2, and R3…each of\nthese resemblance tropes in turn exactly resemble each other.\nTherefore, certain resemblance tropes hold between these\ntropes…we are launched on a regress. \nThis regress is a problem only if it is vicious. The most\nconvincing reason for thinking that it is not is provided if we\nconsider the ‘pattern of dependence’ it\n instantiates.[27]\n For even those who do not think that the internality of exact\nresemblance makes it a mere ‘pseudo-addition’ to its\nsubvenient base, agree that resemblance, whatever it is, is such that\nits existence is necessarily incurred simply given the existence of\nits relata. But then, no matter how many resemblances we regressively\ngenerate, ultimately they all depend for their existence on the\nexistence of the resembling tropes, which resemble each other because\nof their individual nature, which is primitive. This means that the\nexistence of the regress in no way contradicts—it does not\nfunction as a reductio against—the resemblance of the\noriginal tropes. On the contrary; it is because the tropes\nresemble each other, that the regress exists. Therefore, the regress\nis benign (cf. e.g., Campbell 1990: 37; Maurin 2002:\n 78ff).[28] \nA radical option, finally, is to simply opt out of the resemblance\ngame. For if resemblance is out of the picture then, clearly, so is\nthe resemblance regress. One such alternative is provided by Ehring\n(2011: 175ff). According to him, the trope is not what it is either\nprimitively or because of whatever resemblance relations it stands in\nto other tropes. Rather, it is what it is because of the natural\nclasses to which it belongs. Although not without its advantages\n(cf. e.g., fn. 18), a downside of the suggestion is\nthat it seems to turn explanation implausibly on its head. If adopted,\ntropes do not belong to this or that class because of the nature they\nhave, but have the nature they do because of the classes they belong\nto. Many find that this is a high price to pay for avoiding the\nresemblance regress, and the view has few\n proponents.[29] \nThe second constructive task facing the trope theorist is that of\nbuilding something that behaves like a concrete particular does, using\nonly tropes. Exactly how a concrete particular behaves is of course a\nmatter that can be\n debated.[30]\n This is not a debate to which the trope theorist has had very\nmuch—or at least not anything very original—to contribute.\nInstead, the trope theoretical discussion has been focused on an issue\nthat arguably needs solving before questions concerning what\na concrete particular can or cannot do more precisely become relevant:\nthe issue of if and how tropes make up concrete\nparticulars in the first place. \nWhether this issue is best approached by considering if and how tropes\ncan make up or ground the existence of what me might call\n‘ordinary’ objects, or if it is better to concentrate\ninstead on the world’s simplest, most fundamental,\nobjects—like those you find discussed in e.g., fundamental\nphysics—is another issue on which trope theorists disagree.\nCampbell thinks we should concentrate on the latter sort of object. In\nparticular, he thinks we should concentrate on objects that have no\nother objects as parts, as that way we avoid confusing\n‘substantial’ complexity (and unity) with the—here\nrelevant—qualitative one. Robb (2005) and McDaniel (2001)\ndisagree. This may in part be due to the fact that they both\n(cf. also Paul 2002, 2017) think that objects are\nmereologically composed both on the level of their\nsubstantial parts and on the level of their\n qualitative—trope—parts.[31] \nAccording to a majority of the trope theorists, objects are bundles of\ntropes. The alternative is to understand the object as a complex\nconsisting of a substrate in which tropes are instantiated. This is\nthe minority view (defended by e.g., Martin 1980; Heil 2003; and Lowe\n2006). According to Armstrong (1989, 2004)—a staunch but\ncomparatively speaking rather friendly trope-critic—the\nsubstrate-attribute view is the superior one, even for a trope\ntheorist. There exist several reasons to be suspicious of that claim,\nhowever (Maurin 2016). One such reason has to do with parsimony. If\nyou adopt a substrate-attribute view, you accept the existence of\nsubstrates on top of the existence of tropes. Accepting this\nadditional category makes at least some sense if properties are\nuniversals. For if objects are bundles of universals, then\nif a is qualitatively identical to b, a is\nnumerically identical to b. That is, if object are bundles of\nuniversals, the Identity of Indiscernibles is not just true, but\nnecessarily true (although cf. O’Leary Hawthorne 1995\nfor a reason against this). This is a consequence few universal\nrealists have been prepared to\naccept.[32] If\nproperties are tropes, on the other hand, then the tropes that make up\none object will be numerically distinct from the tropes that\nmake up the other, which means that the possibility of qualitatively\nidentical, yet numerically distinct, objects is rather easily provided\nfor. But then, if you are a trope theorist, the added cost of\naccepting substrates into your ontology becomes much harder to\njustify. \nAccording to the bundle view, objects consist of, are made up by, or\nare grounded in, a sufficient number of mutually compresent\nand/or in some other way mutually dependent tropes. What is\ncompresence? When the same question was asked about (exact)\nresemblance, the trope theorist had the option of treating the\nrelation as a ‘pseudo-addition’. This was because\nresemblance is an internal relation and so holds necessarily simply\ngiven the existence of its relata. According to most trope-theorists,\nhowever, compresence is an external relation, and hence a\nreal addition to the tropes it\n relates.[33]\n But then adding compresence gives rise to an infinite\nregress (often called ‘Bradley’s regress’ after\nBradley 1930[1893]; cf. also Armstrong 1978; Vallicella 2002\nand 2005; Schnieder 2004; Cameron 2008; Maurin 2012). Unlike what was\ntrue in the case of resemblance, this regress is most likely a vicious\nregress. This is because the ‘pattern of dependence’ it\ninstantiates is the opposite of that instantiated by the resemblance\nregress. In the resemblance case, for tropes t1,\nt2, and t3 to exactly resemble\neach other, it is enough that they exist. Not so in the compresence\ncase. Tropes t1,\nt2, and t3 could exist and not\nbe compresent, which means that in order to ensure that\nthey are compresent, a\ncompresence-trope, c1, must be added to the\nbundle. But\nc1 could exist without being compresent with those\nvery tropes. Therefore, in order for t1,\nt2, t3and\nc1 to be compresent, there must be\nsomething—call it c2—that makes them\nso. But since c2 could exist and not be\ncompresent with t1, t2,\nt3 and c1, it too needs\nsomething that ensures its compresence with those entities. Enter\nc3. And so on. The existence of this regress\narguably contradicts—and hence functions as a reductio\nagainst—the compresence of the original (first-order) tropes\nand, thereby, the (possible) existence of the concrete particular. \nSince concrete particulars (possibly) exist, something must be wrong\nwith this argument. One option is to claim that compresence is\ninternal after all, in which case the regress (if there even is one)\nis benign (Molnar 2003; Heil 2003 and 2012; cf. also\nArmstrong 2006). This may seem attractive especially to those who\nthink of their tropes as non-transferable and as ways\nthings are. Even given this way of thinking of the nature of the\ntrope, however, to take compresence as internal means having to give\nup what are arguably some deeply held modal beliefs. For even if you\nhave reason to think that properties must be ‘borne’ by\nsome object, to be able to solve the regress-problem one would have to\naccept the much stronger thesis that every trope must be borne by a\nspecific object. If the only reason we have for\nthinking that compresence is internal in this sense is that this\nsolves the problem with Bradley’s regress, therefore, we should\nopt to go down this route as a last resort only (cf. Cameron\n2006; Maurin 2010). \nAs a way of saving at least some of our modal intuitions while still\navoiding Bradley’s regress, Simons (1994; cf. also\nKeinänen 2011 and Keinänen and Hakkarainen 2014 for a\nslightly different version of this\n view[34])\n suggests we view the concrete particular as constituted partly by a\n‘nucleus’ (made up from mutually and specifically\ndependent tropes) and partly—at least in the normal\ncase—by a ‘halo’ (made up from tropes that depend\nspecifically on the tropes in the nucleus). The result is a structured\nbundle such that, although the tropes in the nucleus at most depend\nfor their existence on the existence of tropes of the same\nkind as those now in its halo, they do not depend specifically on\nthose tropes. In this way, at least some room is made for contingency, yet\nBradley’s regress is avoided. For, as the tropes in the\nhalo depend specifically for their existence on the tropes that make\nup the nucleus, their existence is enough to guarantee the existence\nof the whole to which they belong. This is better but perhaps not good\nenough. For, although the same object could now have had a slightly\ndifferent halo, the possibility that the tropes that actually make up\nthe halo could exist and not be joined to this particular\nnucleus is ruled out with no apparent justification (other than that\nthis helps its proponent solve the problem with the Bradley regress)\n(cf. also Garcia 2014 for more kinds of criticism of this\nview). \nAccording to several between themselves very different sorts of trope\ntheorists, therefore, we should stop bothering with the (nature and\ndependence of the) related tropes and investigate instead the\n(special) nature of compresence itself. This seems intuitive enough.\nAfter all, is it not the business of a relation to relate? According\nto one suggestion along these lines (defended in Simons 2010; Maurin\n2002, 2010 and 2011; and Wieland and Betti 2008; cf. also\nMertz 1996, Robb 2005 and Giberman 2014 for similar\n views),[35]\n non-relational tropes have an existence that is independent of the\nexistence of some specific—either non-relational or\nrelational—trope, but relational tropes (including compresence)\ndepend specifically for their existence on the very tropes they\nrelate. This means that if c1 exists, it\nmust relate the tropes it in fact relates, even though those\ntropes might very well exist and not be compresent (at least not with\neach other). There is, then, no regress, and except for\nc1, the tropes involved in constituting the\nconcrete particular could exist without being compresent with each\nother. And this, in turn, means that our modal intuitions are left\nmore or less intact.[36] \nAccording to Mertz (cf. also Maurin 2011), moreover, to be\nable to do the unifying work for which it is introduced, compresence\ncannot be a universal. If it were, then if one of the concrete\nparticulars whose constituents it joins ceases to exist, so will every\nother concrete particular unified by the same (universal) relation of\ncompresence. But, as Mertz points out, “this is absurdly\ncounterfactual!” (Mertz 1996: 190).  Nor can it be a state of\naffairs. For, states of affairs are in themselves complexes, and so\ncould not be used to solve the Bradley\nproblem.[37]\nIt seems, then, that compresence, if understood in a way that blocks\nthe regress, is a trope. Assuming that Bradley’s regress\nthreatens any account according to which many things make up\none unified thing (i.e., assuming that it does not only threaten the\ntrope-bundle theorist), therefore, that there is this threat is in\nitself a reason to think there are tropes. \nThe suggestion is not without its critics. To these belong MacBride\nwho argues that, “…to call a trope relational is to pack\ninto its essence the relating function it is supposed to perform\nwithout explaining what Bradley’s regress calls into question,\nviz. the capacity of relations to relate” (2011: 173). Rather\nthan solve the problem, in other words, MacBride thinks the suggestion\n“transfers our original puzzlement to that thing [i.e., the\ncompresence-relation]”. For, he asks “how can positing the\nexistence of a relational trope explain anything about its capacity to\nrelate when it has been stipulated to be the very essence of R that it\nrelates a and b. It is as though the capacity of\nrelational tropes to relate is explained by mentioning the fact that\nthey have a ‘virtus relativa’”(ibid.). \nAssuming we agree that there is something that needs\nexplaining (i.e., assuming we agree that how several tropes\ncan—contingently—make up one object needs explaining), we\ncan either reject a proposed solution because we prefer what we think\nis a better solution, or we can reject it because it is in\nitself bad or unacceptable (irrespective of whether there are any\nalternative solutions on offer). MacBride appears to suggest we do the\nlatter. More precisely, what MacBride proposes is that the solution\nfails because it leaves unexplained the special ‘power’ to\nrelate it attributes to the compresence trope. If this is why the\nsuggestion fails, however, then either this is because no\nexplanation that posits something (‘primitively’) apt to\nperform whatever function we need explained, is acceptable, or it is\nbecause in this particular case, an explanation of this kind\nwill not do. If the former, the objection risks leading to an\novergeneration of explanatory failures. Everyone will at some point\nneed to posit some things as fundamental. And in order for those\nfundamental posits to be able to contribute somehow to the theory in\nquestion, it seems we must be allowed to say something about them. We\nmust, to use the terminology introduced by Schaffer, outfit our\nfundamental posits with axioms. But then, as Schaffer also points out\n(2016: 587): “it is a bad question—albeit one that has\ntempted excellent philosophers from Bradley through van Fraassen and\nLewis—to ask how a posit can do what its axioms say, for that\nwork is simply the business of the posit. End of story”. \nIf, on the other hand, the problem is isolated to the case at hand, we\nare owed an explanation of what makes this case so special. MacBride\ncomplains that if the ‘explanatory task’ is that of\naccounting for the capacity of compresence to relate, being told that\ncompresence has that capacity ‘by nature’, will not\ndo. Perhaps he is right about this. But, then, the explanatory task is\narguably not that one, but rather the task of accounting for the\npossible existence of concrete objects, (contingently) made up from\ntropes. If this is the explanatory task, it is far from clear\nwhy positing a special kind of (relational) trope that is ‘by\nnature’ apt to perform its relating function, will not do as an\nexplanation. \nAccording to the trope proponent, if you accept the existence of\ntropes, you have the means available to solve or to dissolve a number\nof serious problems, not just in metaphysics but in philosophy\ngenerally. In what follows, the most common trope-applications\nproposed in the literature are very briefly introduced. \nAccording to a majority of the trope theorists, an important reason\nfor thinking tropes exist is the role they play in causation. It is\nafter all not the whole stove that burns you, it is its\ntemperature that does the damage. And it is not any\ntemperature, nor temperature in general, which leaves a red mark. That\nmark is left by the particular temperature had by this particular\nstove now. It makes sense, therefore, to say that the mark is\nleft by the stove’s temperature-trope, which means that\ntropes are very good candidates for being the world’s basic\ncausal relata (Williams 1997 [1953]; Campbell 1990; Denkel 1996;\nMolnar 2003; Heil 2003; Ehring 2011). \nThat tropes can play a role in causation can hardly be\ndoubted. But can this role also provide the trope-proponent with a\nreason to think that tropes exist? According to the theory’s\ncritics, it cannot. The role tropes (can) play in causation does not\nprovide the trope proponent with any special reason to prefer an\nontology of tropes over alternative ontologies. More specifically, it\ndoes not give her any special reason to prefer an ontology of tropes\nover one of states of affairs or events. Just like tropes, state of\naffairs and events are particular. Just like tropes, they are\nlocalized. And, just like tropes, they are non-repeatable (although at\nleast the state of affairs contains a repeatable item—the\nuniversal—as one of its constituents). Every reason for thinking\nthat tropes are the world’s basic causal relata is therefore\nalso a reason to think that this role is played by states of affairs\nand/or\n events.[38] \nAccording to Ehring, this is not true. To see why not, he asks us to\nconsider the following simple scenario: a property-instance at\nt1 is causally responsible for an instance of\nthe same property at t2. This is a case of\ncausation which is also a case of property persistence. But\nwhat does property persistence involve? According to Ehring, property\npersistence is not just a matter of something not changing its\nproperties. For, even in cases where nothing discernibly changes, the\nproperty instantiated at t1 could nevertheless\nhave been replaced by another property of the same type during the\nperiod between t1 and t2. To\nbe able to ontologically explain the scenario, therefore, we first\nneed an account of property persistence able to distinguish\n‘true’ property persistence from cases of\n‘non-salient property change’ or what may also be called\nproperty type persistence. But, Ehring claims, this is\nsomething a theory according to which property instances are states of\naffairs cannot do (this he demonstrates with the help of a number of\nthought experiments, which space does not allow me to reproduce here,\nbut cf. Ehring 1997: 91ff). Therefore, causation gives us\nreason to think that tropes exist (for more reasons to prefer tropes\nas causal relata, cf. Garcia-Encinas\n 2009).[39] \nAccording to Garcia (2016), what role tropes can play in causation\nwill depend on how we conceive of the nature of tropes. If tropes are\nwhat he calls ‘modifiers’, they do not have the character\nthey confer, a fact that would seem to make them less suitable as\ncausal relata.  Not so if tropes are of the module kind (and so have\nthe character they confer). But if tropes have the character they\nconfer, Garcia points out, we may always ask, e.g.: Is it the couch or\nis it the couch’s couch-shaped mass-trope that causes the\nindentation in the carpet? Garcia thinks we have reason to think they\nboth do. The couch causes the indentation by courtesy, but the mass\ntrope would have sufficed to cause it even if it had existed alone,\nunbundled with the couch’s other tropes. But this suggests that\nif tropes are of the module kind, we end up with a world that is\n(objectionably) systematically causally overdetermined. The role\ntropes play in causation may therefore be more problematic than what\nit might initially seem. \nSuppose Lisa burns herself on the hot stove. One of the causal\ntransactions that then follow can be described thus: Lisa removed her\nhand from the stove because she felt pain. This is a\ndescription which seems to pick out ‘being in pain’ as one\ncausally relevant property of the cause. That ‘being in\npain’ is a causally relevant property accords well with\nour intuitions. However, to say it is leads to trouble. The reason for\nthis is that mental properties, like that of ‘being in\npain’, can be realized by physically very different systems.\nTherefore, mental properties cannot be identified with\nphysical ones. On the other hand, we seem to live in a physically\nclosed and causally non-overdetermined universe. But this means that,\ncontrary to what we have supposed so far, Lisa did not remove her hand\nbecause she felt pain. In general, it means that mental properties are\nnot causally relevant, however much they seem to be (cf. Kim\n1989 for a famous expression of this problem). \nIf properties are tropes, some trope theorists have proposed, this\nconclusion can be resisted (cf. Robb 1997; Martin and Heil\n1999; Heil and Robb 2003; for a hybrid version cf. Nanay\n2009; cf. also Gozzano and Orilia 2008). To see this, we need\nfirst to disambiguate our notion of a property. This notion, it is\nargued, is really two notions, namely: \nOnce ‘property’ has been disambiguated, we can see how\nmental properties can be causally relevant after all. For now, if\nmental properties1 are tropes, they can be identified with\nphysical properties1. Mental properties2 can\nstill be distinguished from physical properties2, for\nproperties considered as types are—in line with the\nstandard view of tropes—identified with similarity classes\nof tropes. When Lisa removes her hand from the stove because she\nfeels pain, therefore, she removes her hand in virtue of\nsomething that is partly characterized by a trope which is such that\nit belongs to a class of mentally similar tropes. This trope is\nidentical with a physical trope—it is both mental and\nphysical—because it also belongs to a (distinct)\nsimilarity class of physically similar tropes. Therefore, mental\nproperties can be causally relevant in spite of the fact that the\nmental is multiply realizable by the physical, and in spite of the\nfact that we live in a physically closed and non-overdetermined\nuniverse. \nThis suggestion has been criticized. According to Noordhof (1998: 223)\nit fails because it does not respect the “bulge in the carpet\nconstraint”. For now the question which was ambiguously asked\nabout properties, can be unambiguously asked about tropes: is it in\nvirtue of being mental or in virtue of being physical that the trope\nis causally relevant for the effect (for a response, cf. Robb\n2001 and Ehring 2003)? And Gibb (2004) has complained that the\ntrope’s simple and primitive nature makes it unsuitable for\nmembership in two such radically different classes as that of the\nmentally and of the physically similar tropes, respectively (for more\nreasons against the suggestion cf. Macdonald and Macdonald\n2006). \nAnother important reason for thinking that tropes exist, it has been\nproposed, is the role tropes play in perception. That what we perceive\nare the qualities of the things rather than the things themselves,\nfirst, seems plausible (for various claims to this effect,\ncf. Williams 1997 [1953]: 123; Campbell 1997 [1981]: 130;\nSchaffer 2001: 247; cf. also Nanay 2012 and Almäng\n2013). And that the qualities we perceive are tropes rather than\nuniversals or instantiations of universals (states of affairs) is,\naccording to Lowe, a matter that can be determined with reference to\nour experience. Lowe argues (1998: 205; cf. also, Lowe 2008;\nMulligan 1999): \n[W]hen I see the leaf change in colour—perhaps as it\nturned brown by a flame—I seem to see something cease to\nexist in the location of the leaf, namely, its greenness. But it\ncould not be the universal greenness which ceases to exist,\nat least so long as other green things continue to exist. My opponent\nmust say that really what I see is not something ceasing to exist, but\nmerely the leaf’s ceasing to instantiate greenness, or greenness\nceasing to be ‘wholly present’ just here. I can only say\nthat that suggestion strikes me as being quite false to the\nphenomenology of perception. The objects of perception seem, one and\nall, to be particulars—and, indeed, a causal theory of\nperception (which I myself favour) would appear to require this, since\nparticulars alone seem capable of entering into causal relations. \nA similar view is put forth by Mulligan et al. They argue (1984:\n306): \n[W]hoever wishes to reject moments [i.e., tropes] must of course give\nan account of those cases where we seem to see and hear them, cases we\nreport using definite descriptions such as ‘the smile that just\nappeared on Rupert’s face’. This means that he must claim\nthat in such circumstances we see not just independent things per\nse, but also things as falling under certain concepts or\nas exemplifying certain universals. On some\naccounts…it is even claimed that we see the universal in the\nthing. But the friend of moments finds this counterintuitive. When we\nsee Rupert’s smile, we see something just as spatio-temporal as\nRupert himself, and not something as absurd as a spatio-temporal\nentity that somehow contains a concept or a universal. \nThese are admittedly not very strong reasons for thinking that it is\ntropes and not state of affairs that are the objects of perception.\nFor the view that our perception of a trope is not only distinct, but\nalso phenomenologically distinguishable, from our perception of a\nstate of affairs seems grounded in little more than its\nproponent’s introspective intuitions. States of affairs, just\nlike tropes, are particulars (cf. Armstrong 1997: 126 on the\n“victory of particularity”). And to say, as Mulligan et\nal. do, that the very idea of something spatiotemporal containing a\nuniversal is absurd, clearly begs the question against the view they\nare opposing. \nThat language furnishes the trope theorist with solid reasons for\nthinking that there are tropes has been indicated by several trope\ntheorists and it has also been forcefully argued, especially by\nFriederike Moltmann (2003, 2007, 2009, 2013a and\n2013b; cf. also Mertz 1996: 3–6). Taking\nMulligan et al. 1984 as her point of departure, Moltmann argues that\nnatural language contains several phenomena whose semantic treatment\nis best spelled out in terms of an ontology that includes tropes. \nNominalizations, first, may seem to point in the opposite\ndirection. For, in the classical discussion, the nominalization of\npredicates such as is wise into nouns fit to refer, has been\ntaken to count in favor of universal realism. A sub-class of\nnominalizations—such as John’s wisdom—can,\nhowever, be taken to speak in favor of the existence of tropes. This\nis a kind of nominalization which, as Moltmann puts it,\n“introduce ‘new’ objects, but only partially\ncharacterize them” (2007: 363). That these nominalizations refer\nto tropes rather than to states of affairs, she argues, can be seen\nonce we consider the vast range of adjectival modifiers they allow\nfor, modifiers only tropes and not states of affairs can be the\nrecipients of (2009: 62–63; cf. also her 2003). \nBare demonstratives, next, especially as they occur in\nso-called identificational sentences, provide another reason for\nthinking that tropes exist (Moltmann 2013a). In combination\nwith the preposition like—as in Turquoise looks\nlike that—they straightforwardly refer to tropes. But even\nin cases where they do not refer to tropes, tropes nevertheless\ncontribute to the semantics of sentences in which they figure. In\nparticular, tropes contribute to the meaning of sentences like\nThis is Mary or That is a beautiful woman. These are\nno ordinary identity statements. What makes them stand out, Moltmann\npoints out, is the exceptional neutrality of the demonstratives in\nsubject position. These sentences are best understood in such a way\nthat the bare demonstratives that figure in them do not refer to\nindividuals (like Mary), but rather to perceptual features (which\nMoltmann thinks of as tropes) in the situation at hand.\nIdentificational sentences, then, involve the identification of a\nbearer of a trope via the denotation (if not reference) of a\n(perceptual) trope. \nComparatives—like John is happier than\nMary—finally, are according to the received view such that\nthey refer to abstract objects that form a total ordering (so-called\ndegrees). According to Moltmann, a better way to understand these\nsorts of sentences is with reference to tropes. John is happier\nthan Mary should hence be understood as John’s\nhappiness exceeds Mary’s happiness. Moltmann thinks this\nway of understanding comparatives is preferable to the standard view,\nbecause tropes are easier to live with than “abstract, rarely\nexplicit entities such as degrees or sets of degrees” (Moltmann\n2009: 64). \nWhether nominalizations, bare demonstratives and/or comparatives\nsucceed in providing the trope theorist with strong reasons to think\ntropes exist will, among other things, depend on whether or not they\nreally do manage to distinguish between tropes and states of affairs.\nMoltmann thinks they do but, again, this depends on how one\nunderstands the nature of the items in question. It will also depend\non if and how one thinks goings on at the linguistic level can tell us\nanything much about what there is at the ontological level. According\nto quite a few trope theorists (cf. esp. Heil 2003), we\nshould avoid aguing from the way we conceptualize reality to\nconclusions about the nature of reality itself. Depending on\none’s take on the relationship between language and world,\ntherefore, semantics might turn out to have precious little to say\nabout the existence (or not) of tropes. \nDiscussions of what use can be made of tropes in science can be found\nscattered in the literature. Examples include Harré’s\n2009 discussion of the role tropes play (and don’t play) in\nchemistry, and Nanay’s 2010 attempt to use tropes to improve on\nErnst Mayr’s population thinking in biology. Most discussions\nhave however been focused on the relationship between tropes and\nphysics (Kuhlmann et al. 2002). Most influential in this respect is\nCampbell’s field-theory of tropes (defended in his 1990: Ch. 6;\ncf. also Von Wachter 2000) and Simons’\n‘nuclear’ theory of tropes and the scientific use he\ntentatively makes of it (Simons 1994; cf. also Morganti 2009\nand Wayne 2008). \nAccording to Campbell, the world is constituted by a rather limited\nnumber of field tropes which, according to our (current) best science,\nought to be identified with the fields of gravitation,\nelectromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces (plus a\nspacetime field). Standardly, these forces are understood as exerted\nby bodies that are not themselves fields. Not so on Campbell’s\nview. Instead, matter is thought of as spread out and as present in\nvarious strengths across a region without any sharp boundaries to its\nlocation. What parts of the mass field we choose to focus on will be\nto a certain degree arbitrary. A zone in which several fields all\nsharply increase their intensity will likely be taken as one single\nentity or particle. But given the overall framework, individuals of\nthis kind are to be viewed as “well-founded appearances”\n(Campbell 1990: 151). \nCampbell’s views have been criticized by e.g., Schneider (2006).\nAccording to Schneider, the field ontology proposed by Campbell (and\nby Von Wachter) fails, because the notion of a field with which they\nseem to be working, is not mathematically\n rigorous.[40]\n And Morganti who, just like Campbell, wants to identify tropes with\nentities described by quantum physics, finds several problems with the\nidentifications actually made by Campbell. He proposes instead that we\nfollow Simons and identify the basic constituents of reality with the\nfundamental particles, understood as bundles of tropes (Morganti\n2009). If we take the basic properties described by the Standard Model\nas fundamental tropes, is the idea, then the constitution of particles\nout of more elementary constituents can be readily reconstructed\n(possibly by using the sheaf-theoretical framework proposed by Mormann\n1995, or the algebraic framework suggested by Fuhrmann 1991). \nRelatively little has so far been written on the topic of tropes in\nrelation to issues in moral philosophy and value theory. Two things\nhave however been argued. First, that tropes (and not, as is more\ncommonly supposed, objects or persons or states of affairs) are the\nbearers of final value. Second, that moral non-naturalists (who hold\nthat moral facts are fundamentally autonomous from natural facts) must\nregard properties as tropes to be able to account for the\nsupervenience of the moral on the natural. \nThat tropes are the bearers of (final) value is a view held by several\ntrope theorists. To say that what we value are the particular\nproperties of things and persons is prima facie\nintuitive (Williams 1997 [1953]: 123). And since concrete\nparticulars—but not tropes—are sometimes the subjects of\nsimultaneous yet conflicting evaluations, tropes seem\nespecially suited for the job as (final) value-bearers\n(Campbell 1997 [1981]: 130–131). That tropes are the only\nbearers of final value has however been questioned. According to\nRabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen (2003), this is because\ndifferent pro-attitudes are fitting with respect to different kinds of\nvaluable objects. However, according to Olson (2003), even if this is\nso, it does not show that tropes are not the only bearers of final\nvalue. For that conclusion only follows if we assume that, to what we\ndirect our evaluative attitude is indicative of where value is\nlocalized. But final value should be understood strictly as the value\nsomething has for its own sake, which means that if e.g., a\nperson is valuable because of her courage, then she is not valuable\nfor her own sake but is valuable, rather, for the sake of one of her\nproperties (i.e., her tropes). But this means that, although the\nevaluative attitude may well be directed at a person or a thing, the\nperson or thing is nevertheless valued because of, or for the sake of,\nthe tropes which characterize it. \nNon-naturalists, next, are often charged with not being able to\nexplain what appears to be a necessary dependence of moral facts on\nnatural facts. Normally, this dependence is explained in terms of\nsupervenience, but in order for such an account to be compatible with\nthe basic tenets of moral non-naturalism, it has been argued, this\nsupervenience must, in turn, be explainable in purely non-naturalistic\nterms (for an overview of this debate, cf. Ridge 2018).\nAccording to Shafer-Landau (2003) (as interpreted by Ridge 2007) this\nproblem is solved if moral and physical properties in the sense of\nkinds, are distinguished from moral and physical properties in the\nsense of tokens, or tropes. For then we can say, in analogy with what\nhas been suggested in the debate on the causal relevance of mental\nproperties, that although (necessarily) every moral trope is\nconstituted by some concatenation of natural tropes, it does not\nfollow that every moral type is identical to a natural type. This\nsuggestion is criticized in Ridge 2007.","contact.mail":"anna-sofia.maurin@gu.se","contact.domain":"gu.se"}]
