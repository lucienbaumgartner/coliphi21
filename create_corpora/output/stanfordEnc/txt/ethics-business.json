One entity (e.g., a person, an\norganization) “does business” with another when it\nexchanges a good or service for valuable consideration. Business\nethics can thus be understood as the study of the ethical dimensions\nof productive organizations and commercial activities. This includes\nethical analyses of the production, distribution, marketing, sale, and\nconsumption of goods and services (see also Donaldson & Walsh\n2015).\n\n\nQuestions in business ethics are important and relevant to everyone.\nThis is because almost all of us “do business”—i.e.,\nengage in a commercial transaction—almost every day. Moreover,\nmany of us spend a major portion of our lives engaged in, or preparing\nto engage in, productive activity, on our own or as part of productive\norganizations. Business activity shapes the world we live in,\nsometimes for good and sometimes for ill.\n\n\nBusiness ethics is a huge field. Philosophers from Aristotle to Rawls\nhave defended positions on topics which can be understood as part of\nbusiness ethics. At present, there are at least five journals devoted\nto the field (Business Ethics Quarterly, Business Ethics:\nA European Review, Business & Society, Business & Society\nReview, Journal of Business Ethics), and work in business ethics\nappears in mainstream philosophy and social science journals as\nwell.\n\n\nThis entry summarizes important research on central questions in\nbusiness ethics, including: In whose interests should firms be\nmanaged? Who should manage them? What do firms owe their workers, and\nwhat do workers owe their firms? What moral rules should guide\nfirms’ engagement with customers? Should firms try to solve\nsocial problems? What responsibility do they have for the behavior of\ntheir suppliers? What role should firms play in the political process?\nGiven the vastness of the field, of necessity certain questions in\nbusiness ethics are not addressed here.\n\n\n\n\nMany people engaged in business activity, including accountants and\nlawyers, are professionals. As such, they are bound by codes of\nconduct promulgated by professional societies. Many firms also have\ndetailed codes of conduct, developed and enforced by teams of ethics\nand compliance personnel. Business ethics can thus be understood as\nthe study of professional practices, i.e., as the study of the\ncontent, development, management, and effectiveness of the codes of\nconduct designed to guide the actions of people engaged in business activity. This entry\nwill not consider this form of business ethics. Instead, it considers\nbusiness ethics as an academic discipline. \nBusiness ethics as an academic discipline is populated by both social\nscientists and normative theorists. This is reflected in the attendees\nof academic conferences in business ethics and the types of articles\nthat are published in business ethics journals. Social\nscientists—who at this point comprise the largest group within\nthe field—approach the study of business ethics descriptively.\nThey try to answer questions like: Does corporate social performance\nimprove corporate financial performance, i.e., does ethics pay\n(Margolis & Walsh 2003; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes 2003)? And:\nWhy do people engage in unethical behavior (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel\n2011; Werhane et al. 2013)? I will not consider such questions here.\nThis entry focuses on questions in normative business ethics, most of\nwhich are variants on the question: What is ethical and\nunethical in business? \nConsidered only as a normative enterprise, business ethics—like\nmany areas of applied ethics—draws from a variety of\ndisciplines, including ethics, political philosophy, economics,\npsychology, law, and public policy. This is because remedies\nfor unethical behavior in business can take various forms, from\nexhortations directed at private individuals to change their behavior\nto new laws, policies, and regulations. Doing business ethics well\nmeans being familiar with results in these disciplines, or at least\nbeing aware of gaps in one’s own knowledge. \nNormative business ethicists (hereafter the qualifier\n‘normative’ will be assumed) tend to make certain\nassumptions about economic frameworks. One is that the means of\nproduction can be privately owned. A second is that\nmarkets—featuring voluntary exchanges between buyers and sellers\nat mutually determined prices—should play an important role in\nthe allocation of resources. Those who deny these assumptions will see\nsome debates in business ethics (e.g., about firm ownership and\ncontrol, or about advertising) as misguided. \nSome organizations “do business”—in the sense of\nexchange a good or service for valuable consideration—with the\ngoal of seeking profit, and some do not. Merck and Wal-Mart are\nexamples of the first type organization; Princeton University and the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art are examples of the second. Business\nethicists sometimes concern themselves with the activities of\nnon-profit organizations, but more commonly focus on for-profit\norganizations. Indeed, most people probably understand businesses as\nfor-profit organizations. \nOne way to think about business ethics is in terms of the moral\nobligations of agents engaged in business activity. Who is a moral\nagent? Individual persons, obviously. What about firms? This question\nis typically described as a question of “corporate moral\nagency” or “corporate moral responsibility”. Here\n‘corporate’ does not refer to the corporation as a legal\nentity, but to a collective or group of individuals. To be precise,\nthe question is whether firms are moral agents and morally responsible\nconsidered as (qua) firms, not considered as aggregates of\nindividual members of firms. \nIn the business ethics literature, French is a seminal thinker on this\ntopic. In early work (1979, 1984), he argued that firms are morally\nresponsible for what they do, and hence should be seen as\n“full-fledged” moral persons. He bases this conclusion on\nhis claim that firms have internal decision-making structures, through\nwhich they (1) cause events to happen, and (2) act intentionally. Some\nearly responses to French’s work accepted the claim that firms\nare moral agents, but denied that firms are moral persons. Donaldson\n(1982) claims that firms cannot be persons because they lack important\nhuman capacities, such as the ability to pursue their own happiness\n(see also Werhane 1985). Other responses denied that firms are moral\nagents (also). Velasquez (1983) argues that firms lack a necessary\ncondition of agency, viz., the ability to act (see also his 2003). In\nlater work, French (1995) recanted his claim that firms are moral\npersons, though not his claim that they are moral agents. \nDiscussions of corporate moral agency and moral responsibility have\nlargely faded from the business ethics literature (as of 2016). But\nthey continue to receive attention in the mainstream philosophical\nliterature, where they are treated with a high degree of\nsophistication. Here the focus is on collectives more generally, with\nthe business firm playing a role as an example of a collective. As in\nthe business ethics literature, in the mainstream philosophical\nliterature a key question is: What are the conditions for moral agency\nand responsibility, such that collectives qua collectives,\nincluding firms, do or do not satisfy them? A number of writers,\nincluding Copp (2006), Hess (2014), and List & Pettit (2011),\nbelieve that firms can be moral agents. This view has strong intuitive\nappeal. We routinely say things like: “Costco treats its\nemployees well” or “BP polluted the Gulf of Mexico”,\nand in doing so we appear to assign agency and responsibility to firms\nthemselves. On the other side are writers who deny that firms can be\nmoral agents, such as Gilbert (1989), S. Miller (2006), and\nRönnegard (2015). A claim advanced on this side is that agency\nrequires intention, and firms are not the kinds of things that can\nhave intentions (S. Miller 2006). The common way of speaking about the\nagency and responsibility of firms may be metaphorical, or a shorthand\nway of referring to the agency and responsibility of individuals\nwithin firms. (For discussions of these issues, see the entries on\n collective responsibility,\n collective intentionality, and\n shared agency.) \nWhile the question of whether firms themselves are moral agents is of\ntheoretical interest, its practical import is uncertain. Perhaps BP\nitself was morally responsible for polluting the Gulf of Mexico.\nPerhaps certain individuals who work at BP were. What hangs on this?\nAccording to Hasnas (2012), very little. Firms such as BP can be\nlegally required to pay restitution for harms they cause even if they\nare not morally responsible for them. What ascribing agency and\nresponsibility to firms enables us to do, according to Hasnas, is\nblame and punish them. But, he argues, we should not engage in this\npractice. Phillips (1995), by contrast, argues that in some cases no\nindividual employee in a firm is responsible for the harm a firm\ncauses. To the extent that it makes sense—and it often does, he\nbelieves—to assign responsibility for the harm, it must be\nassigned to the firm itself. On Phillips’s view, corporate moral\nagency makes blaming behavior possible where it would otherwise not\nbe. Because corporate reputation can be a significant asset or\nliability (Roberts & Dowling 2002), this provides an incentive for\nfirms to exercise due care in their operations (see also\nRönnegard 2015). \nThere is significant debate about the ends and means of corporate\ngovernance, i.e., about who firms should be managed for, and who\nshould (ultimately) manage them. Much of this debate is carried on\nwith the large publicly-traded corporation in view. \nThere are two main views about the proper ends of corporate\ngovernance. According to one view, firms should be managed in the best\ninterests of shareholders. It is typically assumed that managing firms\nin shareholders’ best interests requires maximizing their\nwealth. This view is often called “shareholder primacy”\n(Stout 2002) or—in order to contrast it more directly with its\nmain rival (to be discussed below) “shareholder theory”.\n(Confusingly, the label ‘shareholder primacy’ is sometimes\nused—e.g., by Bainbridge [2008]—to refer to the view that\nshareholders should have ultimate control over the firm.) Shareholder\nprimacy is the dominant view about the ends of corporate governance\namong financial professionals and in business schools. \nA few writers argue for shareholder primacy on deontological grounds.\nOn this argument, shareholders own the firm, and hire managers to run\nit for them on the condition that the firm is managed in their\ninterests. Shareholder primacy is thus based on a promise that\nmanagers make to shareholders (Friedman 1970; Hasnas 1998). In\nresponse, some argue that shareholders do not own the firm. They own\nstock, a type of corporate security (Bainbridge 2008; Stout 2002); the\nfirm itself may be unowned (Strudler 2017). Others argue that managers\ndo not make, explicitly or implicitly, any promises to shareholders to\nmanage the firm in a certain way (Boatright 1994). More writers\nargue for shareholder primacy on consequentialist grounds. On this\nargument, managing firms in the interests of shareholders is more\nefficient than managing them in any other way (Hansmann & Kraakman\n2001; Jensen 2002). In support of this, some argue that, if managers\nare not given a single objective that is clear and\nmeasurable—viz., maximizing shareholder value—then they\nwill have an enhanced opportunity for self-dealing (Stout 2002).\nConsequentialist arguments for shareholder primacy run into problems\nthat afflict many versions of consequentialism: in requiring all firms\nto be managed in a certain way, it does not allow sufficient scope for\npersonal choice (Hussain 2012). Most think that people should be able\nto pursue projects, including economic projects, that matter to them,\neven if those projects do not maximize welfare. \nThe second main view about the proper ends of corporate governance is\ngiven by stakeholder theory. This theory was first put forward by\nFreeman in the 1980s (Freeman 1984; Freeman & Reed 1983), and then\nrefined by Freeman and various collaborators over the next 30 years\n(see, e.g., Freeman et al. 2010; Jones, Wicks, & Freeman 2002).\nAccording to stakeholder theory—or at least, early formulations\nof the theory—instead of managing the firm in the best interests\nof shareholders only, managers should seek to “balance”\nthe interests of all stakeholders, where a stakeholder is anyone who\nhas a “stake”, or interest (including a financial\ninterest), in the firm. \nTo its critics, stakeholder theory has seemed both insufficiently\narticulated and weakly defended. With respect to articulation, one\nquestion that has been pressed is: Who are the stakeholders (Orts\n& Strudler 2002, 2009)? The groups most commonly identified are\nshareholders, employees, the community, suppliers, and customers. But\nother groups have stakes in the firm, including creditors, the\ngovernment, and competitors. It makes a great deal of difference where\nthe line is drawn, but stakeholder theorists have not provided a clear\nrationale for drawing a line in one place rather than another. Another\nquestion is: What does it mean to “balance” the interests\nof all stakeholders—other than not always giving precedence to\nshareholders’ interests (Orts & Strudler 2009)? With respect\nto defense, critics have wondered what the rationale for managing\nfirms in the interests of all stakeholders is. In one place, Freeman\n(1984) offers an instrumental argument for his view, claiming that\nbalancing stakeholders’ interests is better for the firm strategically than\nmaximizing shareholder wealth. (This is precisely what defenders of\nshareholder primacy say about that view.) In another, he gives an\nargument that appeals to Rawls’s justice as fairness (Evan &\nFreeman 1988; cf. Child & Marcoux 1999). \nIn recent years, questions have been raised about whether stakeholder\ntheory is appropriately seen as a genuine competitor to shareholder\nprimacy, or is even appropriately called a “theory”. In one\narticle, Freeman and collaborators say that stakeholder theory\nis simply “the body of research … in which the idea of\n‘stakeholders’ plays a crucial role” (Jones et al.\n2002). In another, Freeman describes stakeholder theory as “a\ngenre of stories about how we could live” (1994: 413). It may\nbe, as Norman (2013) says, that stakeholder is now best regarded as\n“mindset”, i.e., a way of looking at the firm that\nemphasizes its embeddedness in a network of relationships. \nIt is important to realize that a resolution of the debate between\nshareholder and stakeholder theorists (however we conceive of the\nlatter) will not resolve all or even most of the ethical questions in\nbusiness. This is because this is a debate about the ends of\ncorporate governance; it cannot answer all of the questions about the\nmoral constraints that must be observed in pursuit of those\nends (Goodpaster 1991; Norman 2013). Neither shareholder primacy nor\nstakeholder theory is plausibly interpreted as the view that corporate\nmanagers should do whatever is possible to maximize\nshareholder wealth and balance all stakeholders’ interests,\nrespectively. Rather, these views should be interpreted as views that\nmanagers should do whatever is morally permissible to achieve\nthese ends. A large part of business ethics is trying to determine\nwhat morality permits in this domain. \nAnswers to questions about the means of corporate governance often\nmirror answers to question about the ends of corporate governance.\nOften the best way to ensure that a firm is managed in the interests\nof a certain party P is to give P control over it. Conversely,\njustifications for why the firm should be managed in the interests of\nP sometimes appeal P’s rights to control it. \nThus Friedman (1970) thinks that shareholders’ ownership of the\nfirm gives them a right to control the firm (which they can use to\nensure that the firm is run in their interests). We might see control\nrights for shareholders as following analytically from the concept of\nownership. To own a thing is to have a bundle of rights with respect\nto that thing. One of the standard “incidents” of\nownership is control. \nAs noted, in recent years the idea that the firm is something that can\nbe owned has been challenged (Bainbridge 2008; Strudler 2017). But\ncontractarian arguments for shareholder control of firms have been\nconstructed which do not rely on the assumption of firm ownership. All\nthat is assumed in these arguments is that some people own capital,\nand others own labor. Capital can “hire” labor (and other\ninputs of production), on terms that it draws up, or labor can\n“hire” capital, on terms that it draws up, with society\nsetting limits on what the terms may be. It just so happens that, in\nmost cases, capital hires labor. These points are emphasized\nespecially by those who regard the firm as a “nexus of\ncontracts” among various parties (Easterbrook & Fischel\n1996; Jensen & Meckling 1976). \nMany writers find this result troubling. Even if the governance\nstructure in most firms is in some sense agreed to, they say that it\nis unjust in other ways. Anderson (2015) characterizes standard\ncorporate governance regimes as oppressive and unaccountable private\ndictatorships. To address this injustice, these writers call for\nvarious forms of worker participation in managerial decision-making,\nincluding the ability by workers to reject arbitrary directives by\nmanagers (Hsieh 2005), worker co-determination of firms’\npolicies and practices (Brenkert 1992a; McCall 2001; McMahon 1994),\nand exclusive control of productive enterprises by workers (Dahl\n1985). \nArguments for these governance structures take various forms. One type\nof argument appeals to the value of protecting workers’\ninterests (Brenkert 1992a; Hsieh 2005). A second type of argument\nappeals to the value of autonomy, or a right to freely determine\none’s actions, including one’s actions at work (McCall\n2001). A third type of argument for worker participation in managerial\ndecision-making is the “parallel case” argument. According\nto it, if states should be governed democratically, then so should\nfirms, because firms are like states in the relevant respects (Dahl\n1985; Walzer 1983). A fourth argument for worker participation\nin firm decision-making sees it as valuable or even necessary training\nfor participation in political processes in the broader society (Cohen\n1989). \nSpace considerations prevent a detailed examination of these\narguments. But criticisms generally fall into two categories. The\nfirst insists on the normative priority of agreements, of the sort\ndescribed above. There are few legal restrictions on the types of\ngovernance structures that firms can have. And some firms are in fact\ncontrolled by workers (Dow 2003; Hansmann 1996). To insist that other\nfirms should be governed this way is to say, according to this\nargument, that people should not be allowed to arrange their economic\nlives as they see fit. Another criticism of worker participation\nappeals to efficiency. Allowing workers to participate in managerial\ndecision-making may decrease the pace of decision-making, since it\nrequires giving many workers a chance to make their voices heard\n(Hansmann 1996). It may also raise the cost of capital for firms, as\ninvestors may demand more favorable terms if they are not given\ncontrol of the enterprise in return (McMahon 1994). Both sources of\ninefficiency may put the firm at a significant disadvantage in a\ncompetitive market. And it may not be just a matter of competitive\ndisadvantage. If it were, the problem could be solved by making all\nfirms worker-controlled. The problem may be one of diminished\nproductivity more generally. \n\nBusiness ethicists seek to understand the ethical\ncontours of, and devise principles of right action for, business\nactivity. One way of advancing this project is by choosing a normative\nframework and teasing out its implications for a range of issues in\nbusiness. \nOne influential approach to business ethics draws on virtue ethics\n(see, e.g., Alzola 2012; Sison & Fontrodona 2012). Moore, in a\nnumber of articles (Beadle & Moore 2006; G. Moore 2005), develops\nand applies MacIntyre’s (1984) virtue ethics to business. For\nMacIntyre, there are certain goods internal to practices, and certain\nvirtues are necessary to achieve those goods. Building on MacIntyre,\nMoore develops the idea that business is a practice, and thus has\ncertain goods internal to it, the attainment of which requires the\ncultivation of business virtues. Scholars have also been inspired by\nthe Aristotelian idea that the good life is achieved in a community.\nThey have considered how business communities must be structured to\nhelp their members flourish (Hartman 2015; Solomon 1993). \nAnother important approach to the study of business ethics comes from\nKantian moral theory (D.G. Arnold & Bowie 2003; Bowie 1999).\nKant’s claim that humanity should be treated always as an end,\nand never as a means only, has proved especially fruitful for\nanalyzing the human interactions at the core of commercial\ntransactions. In a competitive market, people may be tempted to\ndeceive, cheat, or manipulate others to gain an edge. Kantian moral\ntheory singles out these actions out as violations of human dignity\n(Smith & Dubbink 2011). \nEthical theory, including virtue theory and Kantian deontology, is useful for thinking about how individuals should relate\nto each other in the context of business (cf. Rorty 2006). But\nbusiness ethics also comprehends the laws and regulations that\nstructure markets and organizations. And here political theory seems\nmore relevant (see and cf. Moriarty 2005b; Phillips & Margolis\n1999). A number of business ethicists have sought to identify the\nimplications of Rawls’s (1971) justice as fairness—the\ndominant theory of justice in the English-speaking world—for\nbusiness. This is not an easy task, since while Rawls\nmakes some suggestive remarks about markets and organizations, he does\nnot articulate specific conclusions or develop detailed arguments for\nthem. But scholars have argued that justice as fairness: (1) is\nincompatible with significant inequalities of power and authority\nwithin businesses (S. Arnold 2012); (2) requires people to have an\nopportunity to perform meaningful work (Moriarty 2009; cf. Hasan\n2015); and requires alternative forms of (3) corporate governance\n(Norman 2015; cf. Singer 2015) and (4) corporate ownership (M.\nO’Neill & Williamson 2012). \nA fourth approach to business ethics is called the “market\nfailures approach” (MFA). A version of this view can be found in\nMcMahon (1981), but it has been developed in most detail and is now\nmost closely associated with Heath (2014). According to Heath, the\nreason we have a market-based economy, as opposed to a command\neconomy, is because markets are more efficient. But markets fail, due\nto imperfect information, externalities, transaction costs, and more.\nThe state corrects for many market failures through regulation. We set\nlimits on pollution and require truth in advertising, among other\nthings. But we would not want, and we cannot write, regulations to\naddress every market failure. This is where business ethics comes in,\naccording to the MFA. Businesspeople have a moral obligation not to\nexploit the market failures that the law allows them to exploit. Put\nanother way, the moral obligations of businesspeople are identified by\nthe ideal regulatory regime—the one we would have if regulations\nwere costless and written and administered by a godlike figure. \nSelecting a normative framework and applying it to a range of issues\nis an important way of doing business ethics. But it is not the only\nway. Indeed, the more common approach is to identify a business\nactivity and then analyze it using intuitions and principles common to\nmany moral and political theories. Below I consider ethical issues\nthat arise at the nexus of firms’ engagement with three\nimportant groups: consumers, employees, and society. \nThe main way that firms interact with consumers is by selling, or\nattempting to sell, products and services to them. Many ethical issues\nattend this interaction. \nA number of writers have argued that some things should not be for\nsale (Anderson 1993; MacDonald & Gavura 2016; Sandel 2012; Satz\n2010). Among the things commonly said to be inappropriate for sale are\nsexual services, surrogacy services, and human organs. Some writers\nobject to markets in these items for consequentialist reasons. They\nargue that markets in commodities like sex and kidneys will lead to\nthe exploitation of vulnerable people (Satz 2010). Others object to\nthe attitudes or values expressed in such markets. They claim that\nmarkets in surrogacy services express the attitude that women are mere\nvessels for the incubation of children (Anderson 1993); markets in\nkidneys suggest that human life can be bought and sold (Sandel 2012);\nand so on. \nOther writers have criticized these arguments, and in general, the\nattempt to “wall-off” certain goods and services from\nmarkets. Brennan and Jaworksi (2016) object to\n“expressive” arguments against markets in contested\ncommodities. Whether selling a particular thing for money expresses\ndisrespect, they note, is culturally contingent. They and others also\nargue that the bad effects of markets in contested commodities can be\neliminated or at least ameliorated through appropriate regulation, and\nthat anyway, the good effects of such markets (e.g., a decrease in the\nnumber of people who die because they are waiting for a kidney)\noutweigh the bad (see also Taylor 2005). \nSome things that firms may wish to sell, and that people may wish to\nbuy, pose a significant risk of harm, to the user and others. When is\na product too unsafe to be sold? This question is often answered by\ngovernment agencies. In the U.S., a number of government agencies,\nincluding the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), are responsible for assessing the safety of\nproducts for the consumer market. In some cases these standards are\nmandatory (e.g., medicines and medical devices); in other cases they\nare voluntary (e.g., trampolines and tents). The state identifies\nminimum standards and individual businesses can choose to adopt higher\nones. \nQuestions about product safety are a matter of significant debate\namong economists, legal scholars, and public policy experts. Legal\nscholars have also devoted considerable attention to tort law, the\narea of law that deals with cases of (non-contractual, non-criminal)\nharm. But business ethicists have paid scant attention to these\nquestions. Existing treatments often combine discussions of safety\nwith discussions of liability—the question of who should pay for\nharms that products cause—and tend to be found in business\nethics textbooks. One of the most detailed treatments is\nVelasquez’s (2012). He distinguishes three (compatible) views:\n(1) the “contract view”, according to which the\nmanufacturer’s duty is to accurately disclose all risks\nassociated with the product; (2) the “due care view”,\naccording to which the manufacturer should exercise due care to\nprevent buyers from being injured by the product; and (3) the\n“social costs view”, according to which the manufacturer\nshould pay for any injuries the product causes, even if the\nmanufacturer has exercised due care to prevent injury and has\naccurately disclosed all risks associated with the product (see also\nBoatright 2009a). \nThere is much room for exploration of these issues. One area that\nmerits attention is the definitions of key terms, such as “safety” and\n“risk”. Drop side cribs pose risks to consumers; so do\nchainsaws. On what basis should the former be prohibited but the\nlatter not be (Hasnas 2010)? On the question of liability, an\nimportant issue is whether it is fair to hold manufacturers\nresponsible for harms that their products cause, when the\nmanufacturers are not morally at fault for those harms (Piker\n1998). \nMost advertising contains both an informational component and a\npersuasive component. Advertisements tell us something about a\nproduct, and try to persuade us to buy it. Both of these components can be\nsubject to ethical evaluation. \nEmphasizing its informational component, some writers stress the\npositive value of advertising. Markets function efficiently only when\ncertain conditions are met. One of these conditions is perfect\ninformation: minimally, consumers have to understand the features of the products for sale. While this condition will never be fully met in reality,\nadvertising can help to ensure that it is met to a greater\ndegree (Heath 2014). Another value that can be promoted through\nadvertising is autonomy. People have certain needs and\ndesires—e.g., to eat healthy food, to drive a safe\ncar—which their choices as consumers help them to satisfy. Their\nchoices are more likely to satisfy their needs and desires if they\nhave information about what is for sale, which advertising can provide\n(Goldman 1984). \nThese good effects depend, of course, on advertisements producing true\nbeliefs, or at least not producing false beliefs, in consumers.\nWriters treat this as the issue of “deception” in\nadvertising. The issue here is not whether deceptive advertising is\nwrong—most believe it is (cf. Child 1994)—but what counts\nas deceptive advertising, and what makes it wrong. \nIn the 1980s, Beech-Nut advertised as “100% apple juice” a\ndrink that contained no juice of any kind. Its advertisements were\ndeceptive, and therefore wrong, because they appeared to make a true\nclaim, but in fact made a false claim. But many advertisements that do\nnot seem deceptive make false or unverifiable claims. Consider Calvin\nKlein’s slogan, “between love and madness lies\nobsession” or Gillette’s slogan, “the best a man can\nget”. It is common to say of these types of claims that they are\nnot warranted as true, and so cannot deceive (Carson 2010). Yet these claims may in fact deceive some people. A person\nmay believe Gillette’s claim that its products are the best a\nman can get, and purchase them on that basis. Regulators address this\ncomplication by employing a “reasonable person” standard\n(Attas 1999). Advertisements are deemed deceptive when a reasonable\nperson, not any person at all, is deceived. This makes deception in\nadvertising a matter of results in consumers, not intentions in\nadvertisers. \nMany reasons have been offered for why deceptive advertising is wrong.\nOne is the Kantian claim that deceiving others is disrespectful to\nthem, a use of them as a mere means. Deceptive advertising\nmay also lead to harm, to consumers (who purchase suboptimal products,\ngiven their desires) and competitors (who lose out on sales). A final\ncriticism of deceptive advertising is that it erodes trust in society\n(Attas 1999). When people do not trust each other, they will either\nnot engage in economic transactions, or engage in them only with\ncostly legal protections. \nThe persuasive component of advertising is also a fruitful subject of\nethical inquiry. Galbraith (1958), an early critic, thinks that\nadvertising, in general, does not inform people how to acquire what\nthey want, but instead gives them new wants. He calls this the\n“dependence effect”: our desires depend on what is\nproduced, not vice versa. Moreover, since we are inundated\nwith advertising for consumer goods, we want too many of those goods\nand not enough public goods. Hayek (1961) rejects this claim, arguing\nthat few if any of our desires are independent of our environment, and\nthat anyway, desires produced in us through advertising are no less\nsignificant than desires produced in us in other ways. \nGalbraith is concerned about the persuasive effects of\nadvertisements. In contrast, recent writers focus on persuasive\ntechniques that advertisers use. Some of these are alleged to\ncross the line into manipulation. It is difficult to define manipulation precisely, though many attempts have been made (see, e.g.,\nCoons & Weber 2012). For our purposes, manipulative advertising\ncan be understood as advertising that attempts to persuade consumers,\noften (but not necessarily) using non-rational means, to make\nirrational or suboptimal choices, given their own needs and desires\n(see and cf. Beauchamp, Hare, & Biederman 1984; Brenkert\n2008). \nAssociative advertising is often held up as an example of manipulative\nadvertising. In associative advertising, the advertiser tries to\nassociate a product with a positive belief, feeling, attitude, or\nactivity which usually has little to do with the product itself. Thus many\ntelevision commercials for trucks in the U.S. associate trucks with\nmanliness. Commercials for body fragrances associate those products\nwith sex between beautiful people. The suggestion is that if you are a\ncertain sort of person (e.g., a manly one), then you will have a\ncertain sort of product (e.g., a truck). Crisp (1987) argues that this\nsort of advertising attempts to create desires in people by\ncircumventing their faculty of conscious choice, and in so doing\nsubverts their autonomy (cf. Arrington 1982; Phillips 1994). Lippke\n(1989) argues that it makes people desire the wrong things,\nencouraging us to try to satisfy our non-market desires (e.g., to be\nmore manly) through market means (e.g., buying a truck). How\nseriously we take these criticisms may depend on how effective we\nthink associative and other forms of persuasive advertising are. To\nthe extent that we think that advertisers are unsuccessful at\n“going around” our faculty of conscious choice, we may be\nless worried and more amused by their attempts to do so (Bishop 2000;\nGoldman 1984). \nOur judgments on this issue may be context-sensitive. While most\npeople may be able to see through advertisers’ attempts to\npersuade them, some may not be (at least some of the time). Paine (Paine\net al. 1984) argues that advertising is justified because it helps\nconsumers make wise decisions in the marketplace. But children, she\nargues, do not have the capacity for making wise consumer choices (see\nalso E.S. Moore 2004). Thus advertising directed at children—as\nopposed to advertising of products for children directed at\nadults—constitutes a form of objectionable exploitation. Other\npopulations who may be similarly vulnerable are the senile, the\nignorant, and the bereaved. Ethics may require not a total ban on\nmarketing to them but special care in how they are marketed to\n(Brenkert 2008). \nSales are central to business. Perhaps surprisingly, business\nethicists have said little directly about sales. But\nmuch of what is said about advertising also applies to sales.\nSalespeople are, in a sense, the final advertisers of products to\nconsumers. They provide benefits to consumers in much the same way as\nadvertisers and have the same ability to deceive or manipulate\nconsumers. \nCarson (2010) works out a detailed theory of ethics for salespeople.\nAccording to him, salespeople have at least the following four pro\ntanto duties: (1) provide customers with safety warnings and\nprecautions; (2) refrain from lying\nand deception; (3) fully answer customers’ questions about\nitems; and (4) do not steer customers toward purchases that are\nunsuitable for them, given their stated needs and desires. Carson\njustifies (1)—(4) by appealing to the golden rule: treat others\nas you want to be treated. He identifies two other duties that\nsalespeople might have (he is agnostic): (5) do not sell\ncustomers products that you (the salesperson) think are unsuitable for\nthem, given their needs and desires, without telling customers why you\nthink this; and (6) do not sell customers poor quality or defective\nproducts, without telling them why you think this. For the most part,\n(1)—(4) ask the salesperson not to harm the customer; (5) and\n(6) ask the salesperson to help the customer, in particular, help her\nnot to make foolish mistakes. Whether salespeople should\nhelp customers in this way may depend on how adversarial their\nrelationship should be. \nThe broader issue here is one of disclosure. Holley (1998) argues that\nsalespeople are required to disclose to customers what a\n“reasonable person would want to know” about a product\nbefore they purchase it. Ebejer and Morden (1988) claim that salespeople\nshould disclose all information that is “relevant” to a\nbuyer’s purchase. But there is no consensus on what information\nis relevant to a purchasing decision, or what reasonable people want\nto know. \nFor many products bought and sold in markets, sellers offer an item at\na certain price, and buyers take or leave that price. But in some\ncases there is negotiation over price (and other aspects of the\ntransaction). We see this in the sale of “big ticket”\nitems such as cars and houses, and in salaries for jobs. While there\nare many ethical issues that arise in negotiation, one issue that has\nreceived special attention is “bluffing”, or deliberately\nmisstating one’s bargaining position. The locus\nclassicus for this debate is Carr (1968). According to him,\nbluffing in negotiations is permissible because business has its own\nspecial set of rules and bluffing is permissible according to these\nrules. In Carr’s view, everyone who enters the business arena\naccepts bluffing as permissible, just like everyone who enters a\nboxing ring accepts punching people as permissible. Carson (2010)\nagrees that bluffing is permissible in business, though in a more\nlimited range of cases than Carr. Carson’s defense of bluffing\nappeals to self-defense. If you have good reason to believe that your\nadversary in a negotiation is misstating her bargaining position,\nthen you are permitted to misstate yours. A requirement to tell the\ntruth in these circumstances would put you at a significant\ndisadvantage relative to your adversary, which you are not required to\nsuffer. An implication of Carson’s view is that you are not\npermitted to misstate your bargaining position if you do not have good\nreason to believe that your adversary is misstating hers. \nIn simplified models of the market, individual buyers and sellers are\n“price-takers”, not “price-makers”. That is,\nthe prices of goods and services are set by the aggregate forces of supply and\ndemand; no individual is able to buy or sell a good for anything other\nthan the market price. In reality, things are different. Sellers of\ngoods have some flexibility about how to price goods. \nMost business ethicists would accept that, in most cases, the prices\nat which products should be sold is a matter for private individuals\nto decide. This view has been defended on grounds of property rights.\nSome claim that if I have a right to X, then I am free to\ntransfer it to you on whatever terms that I propose and you accept\n(Boatright 2010). It has also been defended on grounds of welfare.\nPrices set by the voluntary exchanges of individuals reveal valuable\ninformation about the relative demand for and supply of goods,\nallowing resources to flow to their most productive uses (Hayek 1945).\nDespite this, most business ethicists recognize some limits on\nprices. \nOne issue that has received attention recently is price\ndiscrimination. By this I do not mean discrimination in pricing on the\nbasis of a person’s membership in traditionally protected\nclasses such as race and sex. (This is widely regarded as wrong.)\n“Price discrimination” refers to discrimination in pricing\non the basis of people’s willingness to pay: charging more to\npeople who are willing to pay more and charging less to people who are\nwilling to pay less. Economists tend to think that price discrimination is\nvaluable insofar as it enables firms to increase output. But the moral\nstatus of it is less clear. When it was revealed that Staples and other\nonline retailers were charging consumers in different zip codes\ndifferent prices for the same products at the same time, consumers\nwere outraged. But some writers argue that this practice is no worse\nthan movie theaters giving discounts to children (Elegido 2011;\nMarcoux 2006). The problem may be that Staples and others engaged in\nthis practice without disclosing it. In doing so, they were taking\nadvantage of consumers’ ignorance. \nAnother issue of pricing ethics is price gouging. Price gouging can be\nunderstood as a sharp increase in the price of a necessary good in the\nwake of an emergency which renders that good scarce. In the immediate\naftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, for example,\nmany retailers charged very high prices for water and gasoline. Many\njurisdictions have laws against price gouging, and it is widely\nregarded as unethical (Snyder 2009). The reason is that it is a\nclassic case of exploitation: A extracts an excessive fee out\nof B in circumstances in which B cannot reasonably\nrefuse A’s offer (Valdman 2009). But some theorists\ndefend price gouging. While granting that sales of items in\ncircumstances like these are exploitative, they note that they are\nmutually beneficial. Both the seller and buyer prefer to engage in the\ntransaction rather than not engage in it. Moreover, when items are\nsold at inflated prices, this attracts more sellers into the market.\nPermitting price gouging may thus be the fastest way of eliminating it\n(Zwolinski 2008). (For further discussion, see the\n entry on exploitation.) \nMost contemporary scholars believe that sellers have wide, though not\nunlimited, discretion in how much they charge for goods and services.\nBut there is an older tradition in business ethics, found in Aquinas\nand other medieval scholars, according to which there is one price\nthat sellers should charge: the “just price”. There is\ndebate about what exactly medieval scholars meant by “just\nprice” (see Reiff 2013). According to a historically common\ninterpretation, the just price is determined by the seller’s\ncost of production, i.e., the price that compensates the seller for\nthe value of her labor and expenses. More recent interpretations\nunderstand the medieval just price at something closer to the market\nprice, which may be more or less than the cost of production (Koehn\n& Wilbratte 2012). In a contemporary treatment, Reiff resurrects\nand rehabilitates the concept of just price, distinguishing it from\nthe market price, and specifying it as the “average total social\ncost of the good at issue” (2013: 109). A view like\nReiff’s must contend with the arguments sketched\nabove—based on rights and welfare—for allowing prices to\nbe determined by the voluntary choices of buyers and sellers. \nBusiness ethicists have written much about the relationship between\nemployers and employees. Most of this writing has inquired into the\nobligations that employers owe to employees. This may be because\nemployers usually have more power than employees, and so have greater\ndiscretion in how they treat employees, than employees have in how\nthey treat employers. Below I identify four issues at the\nemployer/employee interface: (1) hiring and firing, (2) pay, (3)\nmeaningful work, and (4) whistleblowing. Another important topic in\nthis area is privacy. For space reasons this topic will not be\ndiscussed, but see the entries on\n privacy and\n privacy and information technology. \nEthical issues in hiring and firing tend to focus on the question:\nWhat criteria should employers use, or not use, in employment\ndecisions? The question of what criteria employers should not use is\naddressed in discussions of discrimination. \nWhile there is some debate about whether discrimination in employment\nshould be legally prohibited (see Epstein 1992), almost everyone\nagrees that it is morally wrong (Hellman 2008; Lippert-Rasmussen\n2014). Discussion has focused on two questions. First, when does the\nuse of a certain criterion in an employment decision count as\ndiscriminatory? It seems wrong for Wal-Mart to exclude white\napplicants for a job in their marketing department, but not wrong for\nthe Hovey Players (a theater troupe) to exclude white applicants for a\nproduction of A Raisin in the Sun. We might say that whether\na hiring practice is discriminatory depends on whether the criterion\nused is job-relevant. But this may not go far enough, as the case of\n“reaction qualifications” reveals. Suppose that white diners prefer to be\nserved by white waiters rather than black waiters. In this case race seems job-relevant, but it also seems wrong for employers to take race into account (Mason 2017). Another\nquestion that has received considerable attention is: What makes\ndiscrimination wrong? Some argue that discrimination is wrong because\nof its effects on those who are discriminated against\n(Lippert-Rasmussen 2014); others think that it is wrong because of\nwhat it expresses to them (Hellman 2008). (For further discussion, see\nthe entry on\n discrimination.) \nSome writers believe that employers’ obligations are not\nsatisfied simply when they avoid using certain criteria in\nhiring decisions. According to them, employers have a duty to hire the\nmost qualified applicant. Some justify this duty by appealing to\nconsiderations of desert (D. Miller 1999); others justify it by\nappealing to equal opportunity (Mason 2006). The standard challenge to\nthis view appeals to property rights (Kershnar 2004). A\njob offer typically implies a promise to pay the job-taker a sum of\nyour money for performing certain tasks. While we might think that\nexcluding some ways you can dispose of your property (e.g., rules\nagainst discrimination in hiring) can be justified, we might think\nthat excluding all ways but one (viz., a requirement to hire the most\nqualified applicant) is unjustified. In support of this, we might\nthink that a small business owner does nothing wrong when she hires\nher daughter for a part-time job as opposed to a more qualified\nstranger. \nMany of the same ethical issues that attend hiring also attend firing.\nThere has been a robust discussion of the ethics of firing in the\nbusiness ethics literature. There are two main camps: those who think\nthat employment should be “at will”, so that an employer\ncan terminate an employee for any reason (Epstein 1984; Maitland\n1989), and those who think that employers should be able to terminate\nemployees only for “just cause” (e.g., poor performance or\na business downturn) (McCall & Werhane 2010). In fact, few writers\nhold the “pure” version of the “at will” view.\nMost would say that it is wrong for an employer to terminate an\nemployee for some reasons, e.g., a discovery that he is Muslim or his\nrefusal to commit a crime for the employer. Thus the debate is between\nthose who think that employers should be able to terminate employees\nfor any reason with some exceptions, and those who think that\nemployers should be able to terminate employees only for certain reasons. In the U.S.,\nmost employees are at will, while in Europe, most employees are\ncovered, after a probationary period, by something analogous to just\ncause. Arguments for just cause appeal to the effects that termination\nhas on individual employees, especially those who have worked for an\nemployer for many years (McCall & Werhane 2010). Arguments for at\nwill employment appeal to freedom or macroeconomic effects. It is\nclaimed, in the former case, that just cause is an unwarranted\nrestriction on employers’ and employees’ freedom (Epstein\n1984), and in the latter case, that it raises the unemployment rate\n(Maitland 1989). \nBusiness organizations generate revenue, and some of this revenue is\ndistributed to their employees in the form of pay. Since the demand\nfor pay typically exceeds the supply, the question of how pay\nshould be distributed is naturally analyzed as a problem of\njustice. \nTwo general theories of justice in pay have attracted attention. One\nmay be called the “agreement view”. According to this\nview, the just wage is whatever wage the employer and the employee\nagree to without force or fraud (Boatright 2010; Machan & Chesher\n2002). This view is sometimes justified in terms of property rights.\nEmployees own their labor, and employers own their capital, and they\nare free, within broad limits, to dispose of it as they please\n(Boatright 2010). A second view of wages may be called the\n“contribution view”. According to it, the just wage for a\nworker is the wage that reflects her contribution to the firm. This\nview comes in two versions. On the absolute version, workers should\nreceive an amount of pay that equals the value of their contributions\nto the firm (D. Miller 1999). On the comparative version, workers\nshould receive an amount of pay that reflects the relative value of\ntheir contributions to the firm, given what others in the firm\ncontribute and are paid (Sternberg 2000). The contribution view\nstrikes some as normatively basic, a view for which no further\nargument can be given (D. Miller 1999). An analogy may be drawn with\npunishment: just as it seems intuitively right for the severity of a\ncriminal’s punishment to reflect the seriousness of her crime,\nso it may seem intuitively right for the value of a worker’s pay\nto reflect the value of her work. \nThe pay of any employee in a firm can be evaluated from a moral point\nof view, using the two theories sketched above. But business ethicists\nhave paid particular attention to the pay of certain groups of\nemployees, viz., CEOs and sweatshop workers. \nThere has been a robust debate about whether CEOs are paid too much\n(Moriarty 2005a), with scholars falling roughly into two camps. Those\nin the “managerial power” camp believe that CEOs wield\npower over boards of directors, and use this power to extract\nabove-market rents from their firms (Bebchuk & Fried 2004). Those\nin the “efficient contracting” camp believe that pay\nnegotiations between CEOs and boards are usually carried out at\narm’s-length, and that CEOs’ large compensation packages\nreflect their rare and valuable skills (cf. Reiff 2013). \nThere has also been a robust debate about whether workers in\nsweatshops are paid too little. Some say ‘no’ (Powell\n& Zwolinski 2012; Zwolinski 2007). They say that sweatshops wages,\nwhile low by our standards, are not low by the standards of the\ncountries in which the sweatshops are located. This explains why\npeople choose to work in a sweatshop: it is the best offer they have.\nEfforts to increase artificially the wages of sweatshop workers,\naccording to these writers, is misguided on two counts. First, it is\nan interference with the autonomous choices of employers and workers.\nSecond, it is likely to make workers worse off, since employers will\nrespond by either moving operations to a new location or employing\nfewer workers in that location. Other writers challenge these claims.\nWhile granting that workers choose to work in sweatshops, they deny\nthat their choices are voluntary (D.G. Arnold & Bowie 2003). Given\ntheir very low wages, this suggests that sweatshop workers are\nexploited. Moreover, some argue, appealing to a Kantian duty of\nbeneficence, that firms can and should do more for sweatshop workers\n(Snyder 2010). In response to the claim that firms put themselves at a\ncompetitive disadvantage if they do, writers have pointed to actual\ncases where firms have been able to secure better treatment for\nsweatshop workers without suffering serious financial penalties\n(Hartman, Arnold, & Wokutch 2003). \nSmith (1776 [1976]) famously observed that a detailed division of\nlabor greatly increases the productivity of manufacturing processes.\nTo use his example: if one worker performs all of the tasks required\nto make a pin himself, he can make just a few pins per day. However,\nif the worker specializes in one or two of these tasks, and combines\nhis efforts with other workers who specialize in one or two of the\nother tasks, then together they can make thousands of pins per day.\nBut there is human cost, according to Smith, to the detailed division\nof labor. Performing one or two simple tasks all day is likely to make\na worker “as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human\ncreature to become” (Smith 1776 [1976]: V.1.178). \nCalls for “meaningful work” are a response to this\nproblem. As this implies, a call for meaningful work is not a call for\nwork to be more “important”, i.e., to contribute to the\nproduction of a good or service that is objectively valuable, or that\nworkers believe is valuable. Instead, it is a call for labor processes\nto be arranged so that work is interesting, requires skill, and gives\nworkers substantial decision-making power (Arneson 1987; Michaelson et\nal. 2014). \nSmith’s insight that labor processes are more efficient when\nthey are divided into meaningless segments leads some writers to\nbelieve that, in a competitive economy, firms will not provide as much\nmeaningful work as workers want (Werhane 1985). In response, it has\nbeen argued that there is a market for labor, and if workers wanted\nmeaningful work, then employers would have an incentive to provide it\n(Maitland 1989; Nozick 1974). According to this argument, insofar as\nwe see “too little” meaningful work on offer, this is\nbecause workers prefer not to have it—or more precisely, because\nworkers are willing to trade more meaningfulness for other benefits,\nsuch as higher wages. This argument assumes, of course, that workers\nhave the financial ability to trade wages for meaningfulness. \nThe above argument treats meaningful work as a matter of preference:\nas a job amenity that employers can decline to offer or that workers\ncan trade away. Others resist this understanding. According to\nSchwartz (1982), employers are required to offer employees meaningful\nwork, and employees are required to perform it, out of respect for\nautonomy. The thought is: the autonomous persons makes choices for herself; she does not mindlessly follow others' directions. A difficulty for this argument is that respect for autonomy\ndoes not seem to require that we make all choices for\nourselves. A person might, it seems, autonomously choose to allow\nimportant decisions to be made for her in certain spheres of her life,\ne.g., by a coach, a family member, or a military commander. \nA potential problem for this response brings us back to Smith, and to\n“formative” arguments for meaningful work. The problem,\naccording to some writers, is that if most of a person’s day is\ngiven over to meaningless tasks, then her capacity for autonomous\nchoice, and perhaps her other intellectual faculties, may deteriorate. A\ncall for meaningful work may thus be understood as a call for\nworkplaces to be arranged so that this deterioration does not occur\n(Arneson 2009; S. Arnold 2012). In addition to Smith, Marx (1844\n[2000]) was clearly concerned about the effects of work on human\nflourishing. Formative arguments face two difficulties. One is\nestablishing the connection between meaningless work and autonomous\nchoice (or another intellectual faculty). Second, and perhaps more\nimportantly, formative arguments make certain assumptions about the\nnature of the good and the public’s role in promoting it. They\nassume that it is better for people to have fully developed faculties\nof autonomous choice (etc.) and that the public should help to develop\nthem. Both assumptions may be challenged. Neutralists in\npolitical philosophy think that the state should not promote the good,\nat least when there is reasonable disagreement about what is good\n(see, e.g., Rawls 1993). \nSuppose you discover that your firm is paying bribes to government\nofficials to win contracts. To stop this, one thing you might do is\n“blow the whistle” by disclosing this information to a\njournalist. While different theorists give different definitions of\nwhistleblowing (see, e.g., Brenkert 2010; Davis 2003; DeGeorge 2009),\nthe following elements are usually present: (1) insider status, (2)\nnon-public information, (3) illegal or immoral activity, (4) avoidance\nof the usual chain of command in the firm, (5) intention to solve the\nproblem. In the above example, you would be a whistleblower because\nyou are (1) an employee (2) who discloses non-public information (3)\nabout illegal activity in a firm (4) to people outside of it (5) in an\neffort to stop that activity. \nDebate about whistleblowing tends to focus on the question of when\nwhistleblowing is justified—in the sense of when it is\npermissible, or when it is required. This debate assumes that\nwhistleblowing requires justification, or is wrong, other things\nequal. Many business ethicists make this assumption on the grounds\nthat employees have a pro tanto duty of loyalty to their\nfirms (see, e.g., Boatright 2009a). Against this, some argue that the\nrelationship between the firm and the employee is purely\ntransactional—an exchange of money for labor (Duska\n2000)—and so is not normatively robust enough to ground a duty of\nloyalty. (For a discussion of this issue, see the entry\non\n loyalty.) \nOne prominent justification of whistleblowing is due to DeGeorge\n(2009). According to him, it is permissible for an employee to blow\nthe whistle when his doing so will prevent harm to society. (In a\nsimilar account, Brenkert [2010] says that the duty to blow the\nwhistle derives from a duty to prevent wrongdoing.) The duty to\nprevent harm has more weight than the duty of loyalty. To determine whether\nwhistleblowing is not simply permissible but required, DeGeorge says,\nwe must take into account the likely success of the whistleblowing and\nits effects on the whistleblower himself. Humans are tribal creatures,\nand whistleblowers are often treated badly by their colleagues. So if\nwhistleblowing is unlikely to succeed, then it need not be attempted.\nThe lack of a moral requirement to blow the whistle in these cases can\nbe seen as a specific instance of the rule that individuals need not\nmake huge personal sacrifices to promote others’ interests, even\nwhen those interests are important. \nAnother account of whistleblowing is given by Davis (2003). Like\nBrenkert (and unlike DeGeorge), Davis focuses on the wrongdoing that\nthe firm engages in (not the harm it causes). According to Davis,\nhowever, the point of whistleblowing is not so much to prevent the\nwrongdoing but to avoid one’s own complicity in it. He says that\nan employee is required to blow the whistle on her firm when she\nbelieves that it is engaged in seriously wrongful behavior, and her\nwork for the firm “will contribute … to the wrong if\n… [she] [does] not publicly reveal what [she knows]”\n(2003: 550). An unusual feature of Davis’s account is that it\nlimits whistleblowers to people who are currently firm insiders. You\ncannot “blow the whistle” on a firm after you have left\nit. \nWhistleblowing picks out a real and important phenomenon. But it does\nnot seem morally distinctive, in the sense that the values and duties\ninvolved in it are familiar. Loyalty to an individual (or group) may\nrequire that we give preference to her (or their) interests, to an\nextent. And yet, in general, we should avoid complicity in immoral\nbehavior, and should also make an effort to prevent harm and\nwrongdoing, especially when our efforts are likely to succeed and are\nnot personally very costly. On the accounts given above,\nwhistleblowing is simply the attempt to act in accordance with these\nvalues, and discharge these duties, in the context of the\nworkplace. \nBusinesses as a whole command enormous resources, and as a result can\nhave an enormous impact on society. One way that businesses impact\nsociety, of course, is by producing goods and services and by\nproviding jobs. But businesses can also impact society by trying to\nsolve social problems and by using their resources to influence\nstates’ laws and regulations. \n“Corporate social responsibility”, or CSR, is typically\nunderstood as actions by businesses that are (i) not legally required,\nand (ii) intended to benefit parties other than the corporation (where\nbenefits to the corporation are understood in terms of return on\nequity, return on assets, or some other measure of financial\nperformance). The parties who benefit may be more or less closely\nassociated with the firm itself; they may be the firm’s own employees or people in distant lands. \nA famous example of CSR involves the pharmaceutical company Merck. In\nthe late 1970s, Merck was developing a drug to treat parasites in\nlivestock, and it was discovered that a version of the drug might be\nused treat River Blindness, a disease that causes debilitating itching, pain, and\neventually blindness. The problem\nwas that the drug would cost millions of dollars to develop, and would\ngenerate little or no revenue for Merck, since the people afflicted\nwith River Blindness—millions of sub-Saharan Africans—were too poor to afford it. In the end, Merck\ndecided to develop the drug. As expected, it was effective in treating\nRiver Blindness, but Merck made no money from it. As of this writing\nin 2016, Merck, now in concert with several nongovernmental\norganizations, continues to manufacture and distribute the drug for\nfree throughout the developing world. \nCorporate social responsibility, or CSR, is not the only term that\nbusiness ethicists use to describe actions like Merck’s. They\nmight also be described as an example of “corporate\ncitizenship” or “corporate sustainability” (Crane,\nMatten, & Moon 2008; cf. Néron & Norman 2008). It is\ndoubtful that anything important hangs on one’s choice of\nlabels. \nThe scholarly literature on CSR is dominated by social scientists.\nTheir question is typically whether, when, and how socially\nresponsible actions benefit firms financially. The conventional wisdom\nseems to be that there is a slight positive correlation between\ncorporate social performance and corporate financial performance, but\nit is unclear which way the causality goes (Margolis & Walsh 2003;\nOrlitzky et al. 2003; Vogel 2005). That is, it is not clear whether\nprosocial behavior by firms causes them to be rewarded financially\n(e.g., by consumers who value their behavior), or whether financial\nsuccess causes firms to engage in more prosocial behaviors (e.g., by\nfreeing up resources that would otherwise be spent on core business\nfunctions). Since our concern is with normative questions, we will\nfocus on moral reasons for and against CSR. \nSome writers connect the debate about CSR with the debate about the\nends of corporate governance. Thus Friedman (1970) objects to CSR,\nsaying that managers should be maximizing shareholder wealth instead.\nStakeholder theory is thought to be more accommodating of prosocial\nactivity by firms, since it permits firms to do things other than\nincrease shareholder wealth. But we do not need to see the debate about\nCSR as arguments about the proper ends of corporate governance. We can\nsee it as a debate about the means to those ends, with some arguing,\nand others denying, that certain acts of prosocial behavior are\nrequired no matter what ends a firm pursues. \nMany writers give broadly consequentialist reasons for CSR. The\narguments tend to go as follows: (1) there are serious problems in the\nworld, such as poverty, conflict, environmental degradation, and so\non; (2) any agent with the resources and knowledge necessary to\nameliorate these problems has a moral responsibility to do so,\nassuming the costs they incur on themselves are not great; (3) firms have the\nresources and knowledge necessary to ameliorate these problems without incurring\ngreat costs; therefore, (4) firms should ameliorate these problems.\nThe view that someone should do something about the\nworld’s problems seems clearly true to many people. Not only is\nthere an opportunity to increase social welfare by alleviating\nsuffering, suffering people may also have a right to assistance. The\ncontroversial issue is who should do something to help, and how much\nthey should do. Thus defenders of the above argument focus most of\ntheir attention on establishing that firms have these duties,\nagainst those who say that these duties are properly assigned to\nstates or individuals. O. O’Neill (2001) and Wettstein (2009)\nargue that firms are “agents of justice”, much like states\nand individuals, and have duties to aid the needy. Strudler\n(2017) legitimates altruistic behavior by firms by undermining\nthe claim that shareholders own them, and so are owed their surplus\nwealth. Hsieh (2004) says that, even if we concede that firms do not\nhave social obligations, individuals have them, and the best way for\nmany individuals to discharge them is through the activities of their\nfirms (see also McMahon 2013). \nDebates about CSR are not just debates about whether specific social\nills should be addressed by specific corporations. They are also debates about\nwhat sort of society we want to live in. While acknowledging that\nfirms benefit society through CSR, Brenkert (1992b) thinks it is a\nmistake for people to encourage firms to engage in CSR as a practice.\nWhen we do so, he says, we cede a portion of the public sphere to\nprivate actors. Instead of deciding together how we want to ameliorate\nsocial ills affecting our fellow community members, we leave it up to\nprivate organizations to decide what to do. Instead of sharpening our\nskills of democracy through deliberation, and reaffirming social bonds\nthrough mutual aid, we allow our skills and bonds to atrophy through\ndisuse. \nMany businesses are active participants in the political arena. They\nsupport candidates for election, defend positions on issues in public\ndebate, lobby government officials, and more (see Stark 2010). What\ndoes business ethics say about these activities? \nSocial scientists have produced a substantial literature on corporate\npolitical activity (CPA) (for a review, see Hillman, Keim, &\nSchuler 2004). This research focuses on such questions as: What forms\ndoes CPA take? What are the antecedents of CPA? What are its\nconsequences? CPA raises many normative questions as well. \nOne question is whether firms are the right type of entities to engage\nin political activity. In large states, citizens often find it useful\nto join associations of like-minded others, the purpose of which is to\nrepresent their views in political decision-making. But while\norganizations like the Republican Party and the Sierra Club are\nsuitable participants in the political arena, it is not clear that\norganizations like Merck or Wal-Mart are. This is because they have no\nrecognized role in the political process, and citizens do not join or\nleave them based on political considerations (Hussain & Moriarty\nforthcoming; Tucker 2010). Some have criticized the U.S. Supreme\nCourt’s majority decision in Citizens\nUnited—which affirmed and enhanced firms’ rights to\nparticipate in political discourse—on this basis. Alternatively,\nwe might see firms as legitimate speakers on behalf of certain points\nof view (Stark 2010). \nScholars have also raised questions about the goals of CPA. One thing\na firm might do when it engages in CPA is provide valuable information\nto government officials. Society has an interest in knowing how\nproposed economic policies will affect firms; firms themselves are a\ngood source of information on these questions. But some worry that\nfirms more often engage in CPA in order to advance their own interests\nat the expense of their competitors’. This activity is sometimes\ndescribed, and condemned, as “rent-seeking” (Tullock\n1989). Questions have been raised about the nature and permissibility\nof rent-seeking. According to standard definitions, rent-seeking is\nsocially wasteful economic activity intended to secure benefits from\nthe state rather than from the market. But there is disagreement about\nwhat counts as waste. Lobbying for agricultural subsidies is often\ndescribed as a rent-seeking activity, but it can be important to\nsecure a nation’s food supply (Boatright 2009b; Hindmoor 1999).\nA related issue is whether firms are permitted to engage in\nrent-seeking behavior. The structure of the problem appears to be that\nof a prisoner’s dilemma: individual firms often do better if\nthey engage in rent-seeking, but the economy as a whole does worse if\nall firms engage in it (DeBow 1992–1993). \nThe forms of CPA identified above—participating in public\ndiscourse and lobbying government officials—go\n“through” the formal political process. But firms are\nincreasingly engaging in what appears to be political activity that\ngoes “around” or “outside” of this process,\nespecially in circumstances in which the state is weak, corrupt, or\nincompetent. In the world today, firms are providing public goods such\nas healthcare and education (Ruggie 2004), protecting people’s\ncitizenship rights (Matten & Crane 2005), and helping to create\nand enforce systems of private regulation or “soft law”\n(Vogel 2010). For example, when the Rana Plaza collapsed in Bangladesh\nin 2013, killing more than 1000 garment industry workers, new building\ncodes and systems of enforcement were put into place. But they were\nput into place by the multinational corporations that are supplied by\nfactories in Bangladesh, not by the government of Bangladesh. Writers\ncharacterize these activities as political because they are the kinds\nof actions that states normally perform, or should perform (Matten\n& Crane 2005; Scherer & Palazzo 2007, 2011). These new forms\nof CPA—called “political CSR”—have raised\nquestions about the legitimacy of firms’ actions in\ndemocratically governed states. \nScherer and Palazzo (2007, 2011) are major contributors to this\ndebate. In their view, if firms behave like states, then they\nmust be governed like states (see also Matten & Crane 2005). The\nform of governance that Scherer and Palazzo have in mind is\nHabermasian in character, involving deliberative dialog among all\nstakeholders who are affected by a firm’s actions. They give as\nexamples of this type of governance arrangement multi-stakeholder\ninitiatives (MSIs) that bring together firms, non-governmental\norganizations, and members of local communities to deliberate and\ndecide on policy matters, such as the Forest Stewardship Council\n(FSC), the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and the\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Against this,\ncritics have charged that multi-stakeholder initiatives, while\neffective in producing dialog among stakeholders, are ineffective at\nholding firms to account (Moog, Spicer, & Böhm 2015). There\nis little doubt that firms can benefit society through political CSR.\nThe building codes put into place by Western multinationals may well\nsave the lives of many Bangladeshi garment workers. Unless new forms\nof corporate governance can be devised, however, these benefits may\ncome at a cost to democratic self-rule. \nA still more subtle way that firms can engage in political activity is\nthrough the exercise of their property rights (Christiano 2010). A\nfirm might move out of a state in response to the passage of a law it\ndoes not favor, or it may threaten to move out of a state if such a\nlaw is passed. This may cause the state’s citizens to revise or\nedit their political decisions. As with certain cases of political\nCSR, we may applaud the results of this kind of political activity.\nMany applauded when the state of Indiana revised its law permitting\ndiscrimination against members of the LGBT community (on grounds of\nreligious liberty) in response to claims by powerful firms, such as\nSalesforce.com and Angie’s List, that they would scale back\ntheir economic activity in the state. But it is unclear whether such\nbehavior by firms should be encouraged. We may wish to draw a\ndistinction between private individuals influencing political\ndecision-making by exercising their property rights and firms doing\nthe same thing. \nMany businesses operate across societal, including national,\nboundaries. These are typically called “multinational” or\n“transnational” firms (MNCs or TNCs). Operating\ninternationally heightens the salience of a number of the ethical\nissues discussed above, such as CSR, but it also raises new issues,\nsuch as relativism and divestment. (Two issues often discussed in\nconnection with international business are not treated in this\nsection. One is wages and working conditions in overseas factories,\noften called sweatshops. This literature is briefly discussed in\n section 6.2.\n The second issue is corruption. For discussion of this issue, see the\nentry on\n corruption.) \nWhether and to what extent firms have a duty to perform socially\nresponsible actions is a question that can and has been asked about\nfirms in a domestic context. But this question has seemed especially\npressing in international contexts, and many of the most famous\nexamples of CSR—including the case of Merck and River Blindness\ndiscussed in\n section 7.1—take\n place in the developing world. There are two reasons for this. One is\nthat social problems, including poverty and environmental degradation,\nare often worse in the developing world than in the developed world.\nThe second is that firms are relatively more powerful actors in the\ndeveloping world than in the developed world. \nA number of business ethicists have developed ethical codes for MNCs,\nincluding DeGeorge (1993) and Donaldson (1989). International agencies\nhave also created codes of ethics for business. Perhaps the most\nfamous of these is the United Nations Global Compact, membership in\nwhich requires organizations to adhere to a variety of rules in the\nareas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In his\nimportant work for that body, Ruggie (2004, 2013) developed a\n“protect, respect, and remedy” framework for MNCs and\nhuman rights, which assigns the state the primary duty to protect\nhuman rights and remedy abuses of them, and firms the duty to respect\nhuman rights (cf. Wettstein 2009). A striking fact about much of this research is that, while it is focused on\ninternational business, and sometimes promulgated by international\nagencies, the conclusions reached do not apply specifically to firms\ndoing business across national boundaries. The duty to, e.g., respect\nhuman rights applies to firms doing business\nwithin national boundaries too. It is simply that the\ninternational context is the one in which this duty seems most\nimportant to discharge, and in which firms are one of the few agents\nwho can do so. \nThere are issues, however, that arise specifically for firms doing\nbusiness internationally. Every introductory ethics student learns\nthat different cultures have different moral codes. This is typically\nan invitation to think about whether or not morality is relative to\nculture. For the businessperson, it presents a more immediate\nchallenge: How should cultural differences in moral codes be managed?\nIn particular, when operating in a “host” country, should\nthe businessperson adopt host country standards, or should she apply\nher “home” country standards? \nDonaldson is a leading voice on this question, in work done\nindependently (1989, 1996) and with Dunfee (1999). Donaldson and\nDunfee argue that there are certain “moral minima” that\nmust be met in all contexts. These are given to us by\n“hypernorms”, or universal moral values and rules, which\nare themselves justified by a “convergence of religious,\nphilosophical, and cultural” belief systems (1999: 57). Within the boundaries set by hypernorms, Donaldson and Dunfee say, firms have “free\nspace” to select moral standards. They do not have the liberty\nto select any standards they want; rather, their choices must be\nguided by the host country’s traditions and its current level of\neconomic development. \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s approach has attracted a great deal of\nattention, and many critics. Much of this criticism has focused on the\nnature of hypernorms. Some writers argue that Donaldson and\nDunfee’s criteria for hypernorms are ad hoc (Scherer\n2015); others claim that some of the norms that they claim are hypernorms\n(e.g., a prohibition on gender discrimination) do not meet their stated\ncriteria (Mayer & Cava 1995). Other writers focus on the\napplication of Donaldson and Dunfee’s theory, arguing that it\ndoes not give managers the specific guidance it claims to (Soule\n2002). \nA complication for the debate about whether to apply home country\nstandards in host countries is that multinational corporations engage\nin business across national boundaries in different ways. Some MNCs\ndirectly employ workers in multiple countries, while others\ncontract with suppliers in multiple countries. Nike, for example, does\nnot directly employ workers to make shoes. Rather, Nike designs shoes,\nand hires firms in other countries to make them. Our views about\nwhether an MNC should apply home country standards in a host country\nmay depend on whether the MNC is applying them to its own workers or to\nthose of other firms. The same goes for accountability. MNCs,\nespecially in consumer-facing industries, are often held responsible\nfor poor working conditions in their suppliers’ factories. Nike\nwas subject to sharp criticism for the labor practices of its\nsuppliers in the 1990s (Hartman et al. 2003). Our views about the\nextent of the MNC’s responsibility may depend on whether the\nproblematic practices exist in the MNC’s own factories or in\nthose of its suppliers. \nA businessperson may find that a host country’s standards are\nnot just different than her home country’s standards, but\nmorally intolerable. She may decide that the right course of action is\nto not do business in the country at all, and if she is invested in\nthe country, to divest from it. The issue of divestment received\nsubstantial attention in the 1980s and 1990s as MNCs were deciding\nwhether or not to divest from South Africa under its Apartheid regime.\nIt may attract renewed attention in the coming years as firms and\nother organizations contemplate divestment from the fossil fuel\nindustry. Common reasons to divest from a morally problematic society\nor industry are to avoid complicity in immoral practices, and to put\npressure on the society or industry to change its practices. Critics\nof divestment worry about the effects of divestment on innocent third\nparties (Donaldson 1989) and about the efficacy of divestment in\nforcing social change (Teoh, Welch, & Wazzan 1999). Some believe\nthat it is better for firms to stay engaged with the society or\nindustry and try to bring about change from within.  \nThe field of business ethics, in its current form, grew out of\nresearch that moral and political philosophers did in the 1970s and\n1980s. It is not hard to see why moral and political philosophers\nmight be interested in business. Business activity raises a host of\ninteresting philosophical issues: of agency, truth, manipulation,\nexploitation, justice, and more. After a surge of activity 30 years\nago, however, philosophers seem to be retreating from the field. There\nare hardly any philosophy Ph.D. programs that have faculty\nspecializing in business ethics and, as a result, few new\nPh.D.’s are produced in this area. Those who work in the area\nare typically “converts” from mainstream ethical theory\nand political philosophy. This is a missed opportunity. Many\nbusinesspeople care about business ethics: they see themselves as good\npeople who want to do the right thing at work. And many accrediting\nagencies, such as the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of\nBusiness (AACSB), require business schools to teach ethics. As\nphilosophers have retreated from the field, business schools have\nturned to management scholars to fill the void. Given their training\nin the social sciences, management scholars treat ethics largely as a\ndescriptive enterprise, i.e., as the study of the causes and effects\nof allegedly ethical or prosocial behavior. This is an important\nenterprise, to be sure, but it is no substitute for normative\nreflection on what is ethical in business. I hope this entry\nhelps to inform philosophers about the richness and value of business\nethics, and in doing so, excite greater interest in the field.","contact.mail":"jmoriarty@bentley.edu","contact.domain":"bentley.edu"}]
