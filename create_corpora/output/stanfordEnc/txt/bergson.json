Deleuze realized that Bergson’s most enduring\ncontribution to philosophical thinking is his concept of\nmultiplicity. Bergson’s concept of multiplicity attempts to unify in a\nconsistent way two contradictory features: heterogeneity and\ncontinuity. Many philosophers today think that this concept of\nmultiplicity, despite its difficulty, is revolutionary. It is\nrevolutionary because it opens the way to a reconception of community.\n\n\n\n\nBergson was born in Paris on October 18, 1859; he was the second of\nseven children of a Polish Father and English mother; both of his\nparents were Jewish. Bergson was a notably exceptional pupil throughout\nhis childhood. Like his German contemporary, Edmund Husserl, Bergson’s\noriginal training was in mathematics. Bergson won the first prize in\nmathematics for the prestigious “Concours\nGénéral,” which led to the publication of his\nsolution to a problem by Pascal in 1877. Bergson nevertheless chose to\nprepare for the École Normale in the letters and humanities\nsection. His math teacher, disappointed, famously claimed, “you\ncould have been a mathematician; you will be a mere philosopher”\n(quoted in Soulez & Worms 2002, p. 35). \n\nIn 1878, Bergson became a French citizen, although he could have\nchosen English citizenship. He was accepted at the École Normale\nalong with Jean Jaurès and Émile Durkheim. He discovered\nHerbert Spencer with enthusiasm, and studied under Félix\nRavaisson and Jules Lachelier. Bergson graduated from the École\nNormale in 1881. He was the second best at the highly selective\nAgrégation de Philosophie, thanks to a lecture entitled\n“What is the value of contemporary psychology?” He began a\nteaching post in Angers at the high school (the lycée), and then\nmoved to Clermont-Ferrand. There he taught both at the Lycée and\nthe University for the next five years. \n\nHis first scholarly publication was in 1886, in the Revue\nPhilosophique; “On Unconscious Simulation in States of\nHypnosis” concerns the results of his observations at sessions of\nhypnosis. Notice that Freud and Breuer’s Studies on Hysteria\ndid not appear until 1896. This foreshadowed Bergson’s growing interest\nin the role of unconscious memories within recognition—an\ninterest that culminates in his being elected president of the London\nbased Society for Psychical Research in 1913. In 1888, Bergson\nsubmitted two doctoral theses in Paris: Essai sur les données\nimmédiates de la conscience, published as a book (Time and\nFree Will) in 1889; and the then required Latin thesis, Quid\nAristoteles de loco senserit (Aristotle’s Conception of\nPlace). In 1927, in a footnote to Being and Time,\nHeidegger cited this second thesis, claiming that Bergson’s view of\ntime remains within the horizon of Greek metaphysics. \n\nBergson’s second book, Matter and Memory, appeared in 1896.\nThis book led to Bergson’s election to the Collège de\nFrance. In his second attempt, Bergson succeeded at obtaining a post,\nand teaches at the École Normale for two years starting in 1898\n(Soulez et Worms, 2002, pp. 80–81). The Dreyfus Affair was raging, but\nBergson (a Jew by birth) refused to take part in the public debate.\nBergson published Laughter: an Essay on the Meaning of the\nComic in 1900. He was appointed Chair of Ancient Philosophy at the\nprestigious Collège de France. This marked the beginning of his\ngrowing fame. In 1903, Bergson published, in the prestigious Revue de\nmétaphysique et de morale, an article entitled\n“Introduction to Metaphysics” (later reproduced as the\ncenterpiece of The Creative Mind [La Pensée et le\nmouvant] in 1934). The first of Bergson’s works to be translated\nin many languages, this article not only became a crucial reading guide\nfor Bergson’s philosophy as a whole, but it also marked the beginning\nof “Bergsonism” and of its influence on Cubism and\nliterature. Through Williams James’s enthusiastic reading of this\nessay, Bergsonism acquired a far-reaching influence on American\nPragmatism. Moreover, his imprint on American literature (in\nparticular, Wallace Stevens and Willa Cather, who created a character\ncalled “Alexandra Bergson”) is undeniable. \n\nCreative Evolution appeared in 1907 and was not only the\nsource of the “Bergson legend,” as well as of numerous,\nlively academic and public controversies centering on his philosophy\nand his role as an intellectual. The beginning of the next decade is\nthe apex of the “Bergsonian cult” (“le Bergson\nboom”).\nCreative Evolution was translated into English. Bertrand\nRussell (who publishes an article entitled “The Philosophy in\nBergson” in The Monist in 1912) objected that Bergson\nwants to turn us into bees with the notion of intuition. Russell also\nnoted that any attempt at classifying Bergson would fail, as his\nphilosophy cuts across all divisions, whether empiricist, realist or\nidealist (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 124). Bergson’s lectures at\nthe Collège de France were filled to capacity, not only with\nsociety ladies and their suitors, but also with a whole generation of\nphilosophy students (Étienne Gilson and Jean Wahl among others)\nand poets such as T.S. Eliot. \n\nIn January 1913, Bergson visited the United States for the first time\n(Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 134). The week before he delivered his first\nlecture at Columbia University (entitled “Spirituality and\nLiberty”), The New York Times published a long article on him.\nThe enthusiasm this article generated may explain the traffic jam that\noccurred before Bergson’s lecture, the first traffic jam in the history\nof Broadway. In the same year, Bergson gave the Presidential Address,\nentitled “Phantasms of the Living and Psychical Research,”\nto the Society for Psychical Research in London, England. The next year\nBergson was elected a member of the Académie Française;\nhe was the first Jewish member in its history. He also presented\ncourses at the Collège de France on Modern Philosophy and\nSpinoza. His international fame continued to grow through the delivery\nof the Gifford Lecture at Edinburgh University in Scotland in May and\nJune; the lectures were called “The Problem of\nPersonality.” Finally, in the same year, the Roman Catholic\nChurch, in opposition to evolutionary theory, condemned Bergson’s\nphilosophy. \n\nOf course, in the middle of this decade, war broke out, and Bergson\nentered his political career, which took him first to Spain in 1917\n(Soulez et Worms 2002, p.150). But more importantly, the French\ngovernment sent him to the United-States as a diplomatic emissary to\nmeet President Wilson (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 154; see also Soulez\n1989). After his first visit to the United States in 1913, he had\nthought that peace would come only from Washington, D.C. (Soulez et\nWorms 2002, p. 139). After his visit to Washington, Bergson said,\n“I have just lived unforgettable hours. Humanity appeared to me\ntransfigured. […] France was saved. It was the greatest joy of\nmy life.” At this time, Bergson was also working with Wilson’s\ngovernment to form a “league of nations,” a body that would\ninclude representatives of all nations and that would aim at\nestablishing and maintaining peace. The League of Nations remained in\nexistence until 1946, when it was replaced by the United Nations. \nIncreasingly Bergson became more famous for his political actions than\nfor his philosophy. \n\n1919 saw the publication of Bergson’s Mind Energy, a\ncollection of essays concerned with metaphysical and psychological\nproblems. During the same year he retired from his teaching duties.\nHowever, in 1922, Bergson was appointed president of the International\nCommission for Intellectual Cooperation — the precursor to\nUNESCO. There, Bergson participated in a debate with Einstein, which,\naccording to Merleau-Ponty, seems to testify to a “crisis of\nreason.”  Bergson published his reflections on Einstein as\nDuration and Simultaneity (see Mélanges,\n1972). There is some controversy surrounding this book. Bergson\nallowed the book to be reprinted up to the sixth edition in\n1931. However Édouard Le Roy claims in a letter from 1953 (well\nafter Bergson’s death) that he often spoke with Bergson about\nrelativity. Le Roy says, “[Bergson] added with insistence that\nthe defective state of his knowledge of mathematics did not allow him\nto follow the development of generalized relativity in the detail such\na development required. Consequently [Bergson] thought it wiser to let\nthe question drop. This is why he refused to let Duration and\nSimultaneity be reprinted” (Avertissement pour la\nseptième edition, Durée et\nsimultanéité, p. 5, [Lawlor translation]). However,\nin Bergson’s will, he does not mention Duration and\nSimultaneity as a text not to be republished. Thus, the editors\nof the seventh edition in 1968 (Jean Wahl, Henri Gouhier, Jean Gutton,\nVladimir Jankélévitch) saw fit to reprint this book. In\na letter from November 1924, after complaining that in general his\nwritings on relativity had been badly understood by the\n“relativist physicists.” Bergson clarifies that his\nwritings on relativity should not be seen as dismissive of relativity\ntheory. He says, “For my part, I think that the theory of relativity\nrepresents a very great advance, not only from the viewpoint of\nphysics, but also from the viewpoint of philosophy”\n(Bergson, Correspondences, p. 1122 [Lawlor translation]). If\nDeleuze’s interpretation is correct, the confrontation\nthat Duration and Simultaneity develops is not one between\nBergson and Einstein but a confrontation between Bergson’s\ninterpretation of multiplicities and Riemann’s interpretation of\nmultiplicity, Riemann’s interpretation being, according to Deleuze,\nthe basis of Einstein’s theory (Deleuze, 1991, pp. 39–40, and\nalso see below, “The Concept of Multiplicity”). \n\nDuring the second half of the Twenties, Bergson suffered from severe\narthritis, which eventually forced him to retire from public life. In\n1928, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Finally, in 1932,\nhe surprised everyone with the publication of his last major book,\nThe Two Sources of Morality and Religion, which gave rise to\nrenewed debates and misunderstandings about his philosophy and his\nreligious orientation. The final collection of his essays, The\nCreative Mind, appeared in 1934. \n\nBergson died on January 3, 1941 at the age of 81. World War II had of\ncourse already begun, and Germany, occupying France, had established\nthe Vichy government. There is a rumor that he had converted to\nCatholicism near the end of his life, but there is no document to\nsupport this rumor. In fact, in a letter to Emmanuel Mounier, Madame\nBergson quotes her husband saying “I would have converted [to\nCatholicism], if I had not seen over many years the great wave of\nanti-semitism preparing itself to expand over the world.” Madame\nBergson continues in the letter to say that her husband had resolved\nnot to be baptized (Béguin and Thévenaz 1941, pp. 11–12;\nalso Soulez and Worms, p. 277). Because of his fame, the Vichy\nGovernment offered Bergson exemptions from anti-Semitic regulations,\nbut he refused. It is also rumored that he contracted the cold that\nkilled him while waiting in line to register as a Jew. Apparently, in\nthe same will which his wife mentions in the letter to Mounier\n(Béguin and Thévenaz 1941, p. 12), Bergson had\ninstructed that all of his papers be destroyed.  The story goes that\nhis wife obeyed this order, throwing all of her husband’s papers into\nthe fireplace. There is a rumor that she destroyed a half-written\nmanuscript. The result of this destruction is that the Bergson\nArchives in Paris (stored at Librairie Jacques Doucet on the Place de\nPanthéon in Paris) contain only Bergson’s personal library. So,\nthe situation is very different for Bergson than for many other\nimportant French and German philosophers of the 20th Century who have\nmassive archives (Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty). The lack of\narchival material is one reason why Bergson went out of favor during\nthe second half of the Twentieth Century. We shall return to this\nproblem of Bergson’s temporary disappearance from the philosophical\nscene. \n\nThe concept of multiplicity has two fates in the Twentieth Century:\nBergsonism and phenomenology (Deleuze, 1991, pp. 115–118). In\nphenomenology, the multiplicity of phenomena is always related to a\nunified consciousness. In Bergsonism, “the immediate\ndata of consciousness” (les données immédiates de\nla conscience) are a multiplicity. Here, two prepositions,\n“to” and “of,” indicate perhaps the most basic\ndifference between Bergsonism and phenomenology. Of course, this phrase\nis the title of Bergson’s first work, Essai sur les données\nimmédiates de la conscience. The standard English title of\nthis work is Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of\nConsciousness. It is the text that Sartre claimed attracted him to\nphilosophy.  \n\nTime and Free Will has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for\nwhom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time. Bergson\nthinks that Kant has confused space and time in a mixture, with the\nresult that we must conceive human action as determined by natural\ncausality. Bergson offers a twofold response. On the one hand, in\norder to define consciousness and therefore freedom, Bergson proposes\nto differentiate between time and space, “to un-mix” them,\nwe might say. On the other hand, through the differentiation, he\ndefines the immediate data of consciousness as being temporal, in\nother words, as the duration (la durée). In the\nduration, there is no juxtaposition of events; therefore there is no\nmechanistic causality. It is in the duration that we can speak of the\nexperience of freedom. \n\nFor Bergson, we must understand the duration as a qualitative\nmultiplicity — as opposed to a quantitative multiplicity. As the\nname suggests, a quantitative multiplicity enumerates things or states\nof consciousness by means of externalizing one from another in a\nhomogeneous space. In contrast, a qualitative multiplicity consists in\na temporal heterogeneity, in which “several conscious states are\norganized into a whole, permeate one another, [and] gradually gain a\nricher content” (Time and Free Will, p. 122). Bergson\neven insists that the word ‘several’ is inappropriate to\nqualitative multiplicity because it suggests numbering. In Time\nand Free Will, Bergson provides examples of a quantitative\nmultiplicity; the example of a flock of sheep is perhaps the easiest\nto grasp (Time and Free Will, pp. 76–77). When we look\nat a flock of sheep, what we notice is that they all look alike. We\nsense no qualitative change as we move from one to another. We also\nnotice that we can enumerate the sheep. We are able to enumerate them\nbecause each sheep is spatially separated from or juxtaposed to the\nothers; in other words, each occupies a discernable spatial\nlocation. Therefore, quantitative multiplicities, as Bergson says, are\nhomogeneous and spatial. Moreover, because a quantitative multiplicity\nis homogeneous, we can represent it with a symbol, for instance, a\nsum: ‘25’. The idea of qualitative multiplicities is difficult to understand,\nalthough it is the heart of Bergson’s thinking. Normally, we would\nthink that if there is heterogeneity, there has to be\njuxtaposition. But, in qualitative multiplicities, there is\nheterogeneity and no juxtaposition. Qualitative multiplicities are\ntemporal; qualitative multiplicity defines the duration. As with\nquantitative multiplicities, Bergson gives us many examples; but\nperhaps the easiest example to grasp is the feeling of sympathy, a\nmoral feeling (Time and Free Will, pp. 18–19). Sympathy\nis not only the easiest to grasp, it is also significant, as we shall\nsee. Our experience of sympathy begins, according to Bergson, with our\nputting ourselves in the place of others, feeling their pain. But, if\nthis were all, the feeling would inspire in us abhorrence of others,\nand we would want to avoid them, not help them. Bergson concedes that\nthe feeling of horror may be at the root of sympathy. But then, we\nrealize that if we do not help this poor wretch, it is going to turn\nout that, when we need help, no one will come to our aide. There is a\n“need” to help the suffering. For Bergson, these two\nphases are “inferior forms of pity.” True pity, therefore, involves not so much fearing pain as\ndesiring it. It is as if “nature” has committed a great\ninjustice and what we want is to be seen as not complicit with it. As\nBergson says, “The essence of pity is thus a need for\nself-abasement, an aspiration downward” into pain. But, this\npainful aspiration develops into a sense of being superior. We realize\nthat we can do without certain sensuous goods; we are superior to them\nsince we have managed to dissociate ourselves from them. In the end,\none feels humility, humble since we are now stripped of these sensuous\ngoods. Now, Bergson calls this feeling “a qualitative\nprogress.” It consists in a “transition from repugnance to\nfear, from fear to sympathy, and from sympathy itself to\nhumility.”  The genius of Bergson’s description is that\nthere is a heterogeneity of feelings here, and yet no one would be\nable to juxtapose them or say that one negates the other. There is no\nnegation in the duration. We shall return to this important point\nconcerning negation when discussing “Creative\nEvolution.”  In any case, the feelings are continuous with\none another; they interpenetrate one another, and there is even an\nopposition between inferior needs and superior needs. A qualitative\nmultiplicity is therefore heterogeneous (or singularized), continuous\n(or interpenetrating), oppositional (or dualistic) at the extremes,\nand progressive (or temporal, an irreversible flow, which is not given\nall at once). Because a qualitative multiplicity is heterogeneous and\nyet interpenetrating, it cannot be adequately represented by a symbol;\nindeed, for Bergson, a qualitative multiplicity is inexpressible.\nBergson also calls the last characteristic of temporal progress\nmobility. For Bergson — and perhaps this is his greatest insight\n— freedom is mobility. Because Bergson connects duration with\nmobility, in the second half of the Twentieth Century (in Deleuze and\nFoucault, in particular), the Bergsonian concept of qualitative\nmultiplicity will be dissociated from time and associated with space\n(Deleuze 1986). \n\nIn his “Introduction to Metaphysics,” Bergson gives us\nthree images to help us think about the duration and therefore\nqualitative multiplicities (The Creative Mind, pp. 164–65). The first\nis that of two spools, with a tape running between them, one spool\nunwinding the tape, the other winding it up. (During his discussion of\nBergson, Heidegger focuses on this image in his 1928 The\nMetaphysical Foundations of Logic.) Duration resembles this image,\naccording to Bergson, because, as we grow older, our future grows\nsmaller and our past larger. The benefit of this image is that it\npresents a continuity of experiences without juxtaposition. Yet, there\nis a drawback: because a tape moves between the two spools, the image\npresents the duration as being homogeneous, as if one could fold the\ntape back over its other parts, as if the tape were super-posable,\nimplying that two moments in consciousness might be identical. Yet, as\nBergson says, “no two moments are identical in a conscious\nbeing” (The Creative Mind, p. 164). Duration, for\nBergson, is continuity of progress and heterogeneity; moreover, thanks\nto this image, we can also see that duration implies a conservation of\nthe past. Indeed, for Bergson and this is the center of his truly novel\nidea of memory, memory conserves the past and this conservation does\nnot imply that one experiences the same (re-cognition), but difference.\nOne moment is added onto the old ones, and thus, when the next moment\noccurs, it is added onto all the other old ones plus the one that came\nimmediately before. In comparison, therefore to the past collection of\nmoments, it cannot be the same as the one immediately before, because\nthe past is “larger” for the current moment than it was for\nthe previous moment. Although Bergson does not say this, one might say\nthat Tuesday is different from Monday because Monday only includes\nitself and Sunday, while Tuesday includes itself, Monday, and Sunday.\nThis first image, therefore, implies that duration is memory: the\nprolongation of the past into the present. We shall return to the\nquestion of memory below. \n\nThe second image of qualitative multiplicity is the color spectrum.\nWe saw in the first image of the spools that there is constant\ndifference or heterogeneity. The color spectrum helps us understand\nthis, since a color spectrum has a multiplicity of different shades or\nnuances of color. Here we have heterogeneity, but there is a drawback\nto this image as well. We lose the characteristic of continuity or\nunity since the spectrum has colors juxtaposed. As Bergson says,\n“pure duration excludes all idea of juxtaposition, reciprocal\nexteriority and extension” (The Creative Mind, p.\n164). \n\nBergson’s third image is an elastic band being stretched. Bergson\ntells us first to contract the band to a mathematical point, which\nrepresents “the now” of our experience. Then, draw it out\nto make a line growing progressively longer. He warns us not to focus\non the line but on the action which traces it. If we can focus on the\naction of tracing, then we can see that the movement — which is\nduration — is not only continuous and differentiating or\nheterogeneous, but also indivisible. We can always insert breaks into\nthe spatial line that represents the motion, but the motion itself is\nindivisible. For Bergson, there is always a priority of movement over\nthe things that move; the thing that moves is an abstraction from the\nmovement. Now, the elastic band being stretched is a more exact image\nof duration. But, the image of the elastic is still, according to\nBergson, incomplete. Why ? Because, for him, no image can represent\nduration. An image is immobile, while duration is “pure\nmobility” (The Creative Mind, p. 165). Later, in\nCreative Evolution, Bergson will criticize the new art of\ncinema for presenting immobile images of movement. As Deleuze will show\nin his cinema books, however, Bergson does not recognize the novelty of\nthis artform. Cinema does provide moving images. In any case, in\n“Introduction to Metaphysics,” Bergson compares all three\nimages: “the unrolling of our duration [the spool] in certain\naspects resembles the unity of a movement which progresses [the\nelastic], in others, a multiplicity of states spreading out [the\ncolor-spectrum].” Now we can see that duration really consists in\ntwo characteristics:  unity and multiplicity. This double\ncharacteristic brings us to Bergson’s method of intuition. \n\nAs we already noted, Bergson’s thought must be seen as an attempt to\novercome Kant. In Bergson’s eyes, Kant’s philosophy is scandalous,\nsince it eliminates the possibility of absolute knowledge and mires\nmetaphysics in antinomies. Bergson’s own method of intuition is\nsupposed to restore the possibility of absolute knowledge – here\none should see a kinship between Bergsonian intuition and what Kant\ncalls intellectual intuition – and metaphysics. To do this,\nintuition in Bergson’s sense must place us above the divisions of the\ndifferent schools of philosophy like rationalism and empiricism or\nidealism and realism. Philosophy, for Bergson, does not consist in\nchoosing between concepts and in taking sides (The Creative\nMind, p. 175–76). These antinomies of concepts and positions,\naccording to him, result from the normal or habitual way our\nintelligence works. Here we find Bergson’s connection to American\npragmatism. The normal way our intelligence works is guided by needs\nand thus the knowledge it gathers is not disinterested; it is relative\nknowledge. And how it gathers knowledge is through what Bergson calls\n“analysis,” that is, the dividing of things according to\nperspectives taken. Comprehensive analytic knowledge then consists in\nreconstruction or re-composition of a thing by means of synthesizing\nthe perspectives. This synthesis, while helping us satisfy needs, never\ngives us the thing itself; it only gives us a general concept of\nthings. Thus, intuition reverses the normal working of intelligence,\nwhich is interested and analytic (synthesis being only a development of\nanalysis). In the fourth chapter to Matter and Memory, Bergson\ncalls this reversal of habitual intelligence “the turn of\nexperience” where experience becomes concerned with utility,\nwhere it becomes human experience (Matter and Memory, pp.184–85). This\nplacement of oneself up above the turn is not easy; above all else,\nBergson appreciates effort.  \n\nIntuition therefore is a kind of experience, and indeed Bergson\nhimself calls his thought “the true empiricism” (The\nCreative Mind, p. 175). What sort of experience? In the opening pages\nof “Introduction to Metaphysics,” he calls intuition\nsympathy (The Creative Mind, p. 159). As we have seen from our\ndiscussion of multiplicity in Time and Free Will, sympathy\nconsists in putting ourselves in the place of others. Bergsonian\nintuition then consists in entering into the thing, rather than going\naround it from the outside. This “entering into,” for\nBergson, gives us absolute knowledge. In a moment, we are going to have\nto qualify this “absoluteness.” In any case, for Bergson,\nintuition is entering into ourselves – he says we seize ourselves\nfrom within – but this self-sympathy develops heterogeneously\ninto others. In other words, when one sympathizes with oneself, one\ninstalls oneself within duration and then feels a “certain well\ndefined tension, whose very determinateness seems like a choice between\nan infinity of possible durations” (The Creative Mind, p. 185).\nIn order to help us understand intuition, which is always an intuition\nof duration, let us return to the color spectrum image. Bergson says\nthat we should suppose that perhaps there is no other color than\norange. Yet, if we could enter into orange, that is, if we could\nsympathize with it, we would “sense ourselves caught,” as\nBergson says, “between red and yellow.” This means that if\nwe make an effort when we perceive orange, we sense a variety of\nshades. If we make more of an effort, we sense that the darkest shade\nof orange is a different color, red, while the lightest is also a\ndifferent color, yellow. Thus, we would have a sense, beneath orange,\nof the whole color spectrum. So, likewise, I may introspect and\nsympathize with my own duration; my duration may be the only one. But,\nif I make an effort, I sense in my duration a variety of shades. In\nother words, the intuition of duration puts me in contact with a whole\ncontinuity of durations, which I could, with effort, try to follow\nupwardly or downwardly, upward to spirit or downward to inert matter\n(The Creative Mind, p. 187). Thus Bergsonian intuition is\nalways an intuition of what is other. Here we see that Bergson has not\nonly tried to break with Kant, but also with Parmenides’s philosophy of\nthe same. \n\nBefore, we leave this discussion, it is important to realize that\nintuition, understood as my self-sympathy, like the one color orange,\nis what Bergson calls a “component part” (The Creative\nMind, pp. 170–72). Just as the color orange is a real part of the color\nspectrum — the mathematical equation which defines the light\nwaves of orange, on the contrary, being not a component part, for\nBergson, but a “partial expression” – my own duration\nis a real part of the duration itself. From this part, I can,\nas Bergson would say, “dilate” or “enlarge” and\nmove into other durations. But this starting point in a part implies\n– and Bergson himself never seems to realize this– that\nintuition never gives us absolute knowledge of the whole of the\nduration, all the component parts of the duration. The whole is\nnever given in an intuition; only a contracted part is given.\nNevertheless, this experience is an integral one, in the sense of\nintegrating an infinity of durations. And thus, even though we cannot\nknow all durations, every single one that comes into existence must be\nrelated, as a part, to the others. The duration is that to\nwhich everything is related and in this sense it is absolute. \n\nBecause intuition in Bergson is “integral experience”\n(The Creative Mind, p. 200), it is made up of an indefinite\nseries of acts, which correspond to the degrees of duration. This\nseries of acts is why Bergson calls intuition a method. The first act\nis a kind of leap, and the idea of a leap is opposed to the idea of a\nre-constitution after analysis. One should make the effort to reverse\nthe habitual mode of intelligence and set oneself up immediately in the\nduration. But then, second, one should make the effort to dilate one’s\nduration into a continuous heterogeneity. Third, one should make the\neffort to differentiate (as with the color orange) the extremes of this\nheterogeneity. With the second and third steps, one can see a\nsimilarity to Plato’s idea of dialectic understood as collection and\ndivision. The method resembles that of the good butcher who knows how\nto cut at the articulations or the good tailor who knows how to sew\npieces of cloth together into clothes that fit. On the basis of the\ndivision into extremes or into a duality, one can then confront our\neveryday “mixtures” of the two extremes. Within the\nmixture, one makes a division or “cut” into differences in\nkind: into matter and spirit, for instance. Then one shows how the\nduality is actually a monism, how the two extremes are\n“sewn” together, through memory, in the continuous\nheterogeneity of duration. Indeed, for Bergson, intuition is memory; it\nis not perception. \n\nSince its publication in 1896, Matter and Memory has attracted\nconsiderable attention (see, for example, Deleuze 1956). In the Preface\nthat he wrote in 1910, Bergson says that Matter and Memory “is\nfrankly dualistic,” since it “affirms both the reality of\nmatter and the reality of spirit” (Matter and Memory, p. 9). However, he\nis quick to warn us that the aim of the book is really “to\novercome the theoretical difficulties which have always beset\ndualism” (ibid.). In the history of philosophy, these theoretical\ndifficulties have generally arisen from a view of external perception,\nwhich always seems to result in an opposition between representation\nand matter. Thus, Bergson’s theory of “pure perception,”\nlaid out in the first chapter of Matter and Memory aims to show that\n— beyond both realism and idealism — our knowledge of\nthings, in its pure state, takes place within the things it\nrepresents. \n\nBut, in order to show this, Bergson starts with a hypothesis that all\nwe sense are images. Now we can see the basis of Bergson’s use of\nimages in his method of intuition. He is re-stating the problem of\nperception in terms of images because it seems to be an intermediate\nposition between realism and idealism (Matter and Memory, p. 26).\nBergson is employing the concept of image to dispel the false belief\n— central to realism and materialism — that matter is a\nthing that possesses a hidden power able to produce representations in\nus. There is no hidden power in matter; matter is only\nimages. Bergson, however, not only criticizes materialism (its theory\nof hidden powers), but also idealism insofar as idealism attempts to\nreduce matter to the representation we have of it. For Bergson, image\ndiffers from representation, but it does not differ in nature from\nrepresentation since Bergson’s criticism of materialism consists in\nshowing that matter does not differ in nature from representation. For\nBergson, the image is less than a thing but more than a\nrepresentation. The “more” and the “less”\nindicates that representation differs from the image by degree. It\nalso indicates that perception is continuous with images of\nmatter. Through the hypothesis of the image, Bergson is re-attaching\nperception to the real. \n\nIn perception — Bergson demonstrates this point through his\ntheory of pure perception — the image of a material thing becomes\na representation. A representation is always in the image virtually. We\nshall return to this concept of virtuality below. In any case, in\nperception, there is a transition from the image as being in itself to\nits being for me. But, perception adds nothing new to the image; in\nfact, it subtracts from it. Representation is a diminution of the\nimage; the transition from image to pure perception is\n“discernment in the etymological sense of the word,” a\n“slicing up” or a “selection” (Matter and\nMemory, p. 38). According to Bergson, selection occurs because of\nnecessities or utility based in our bodies. In other words, conscious\nrepresentation results from the suppression of what has no interest for\nbodily functions and the conservation only of what does interest bodily\nfunctions. The conscious perception of a living being therefore\nexhibits a “necessary poverty” ( Matter and\nMemory, p. 38). \n\nIf we can circle back for a moment, although Bergson shows that we\nperceive things in the things, the necessary poverty of perception\nmeans that it cannot define intuition. Turning back from the habitual\nuse of intelligence for needs, intuition, as we can see now, places us\nabove or below representations. Intuition is fundamentally\nun-representative. In this regard, the following passage from the third\nchapter of Matter and Memory becomes very important: \n\nLike the descriptions of intuition, this passage describes how we\ncan resolve the images of matter into mobile vibrations. In this way,\nwe overcome the inadequacy of all images of duration. We would have to\ncall the experience described here not a perception of matter, but a\nmemory of matter because of its richness. As we have already suggested,\nBergsonian intuition is memory. So, we turn now to memory. \n\nAs we saw in the discussion of method above, Bergson always makes a\ndifferentiation within a mixture. Therefore, he sees that our word\n“memory” mixes together two different kinds of memories. On\nthe one hand, there is habit-memory, which consists in obtaining\ncertain automatic behavior by means of repetition; in other words, it\ncoincides with the acquisition of sensori-motor mechanisms. On the\nother hand, there is true or “pure” memory; it is the\nsurvival of personal memories, a survival that, for Bergson, is\nunconscious. In other words, we have habit-memory actually aligned with\nbodily perception. Pure memory is something else, and here we encounter\nBergson’s famous (or infamous) image of the memory cone. \n\nThe image of the inverted cone occurs twice in the third chapter of\nMatter and Memory (pp. 152 and 162). The image of the cone is\nconstructed with a plane and an inverted cone whose summit is inserted\ninto the plane. The plane, “plane P,” as Bergson calls it,\nis the “plane of my actual representation of the\nuniverse.”  The cone “SAB,” of course, is\nsupposed to symbolize memory, specifically, the true memory or\nregressive memory. At the cone’s base, “AB,” we have\nunconscious memories, the oldest surviving memories, which come\nforward spontaneously, for example, in dreams. As we descend, we have\nan indefinite number of different regions of the past ordered by their\ndistance or nearness to the present. The second cone image represents\nthese different regions with horizontal lines trisecting the cone. At\nthe summit of the cone, “S,” we have the image of my body\nwhich is concentrated into a point, into the present perception. The\nsummit is inserted into the plane and thus the image of my body\n“participates in the plane” of my actual representation of\nthe universe. \n\nThe inverted cone image is no exception to Bergson’s belief that all\nimages are inadequate to duration. The inverted cone is really supposed\nto symbolize a dynamic process, mobility. Memories are descending down\nthe cone from the past to the present perception and action. The idea\nthat memories are descending means that true memory in Bergson is\nprogressive. This progressive movement of memory as a whole takes\nplace, according to Bergson, between the extremes of the base of\n“pure memory,” which is immobile and which Bergson calls\n“contemplation” (Matter and Memory, p. 163), and the plane\nwhere action takes place. Whenever Bergson in any of his works mentions\ncontemplation, he is thinking of Plotinus, on whom he lectured many\ntimes. But, in contrast to Plotinus, for Bergson, thinking is not mere\ncontemplation; it is the entire or integral movement of memory between\ncontemplation and action. Thinking, for Bergson, occurs when pure\nmemory moves forward into singular images. This forward movement occurs\nby means of two movements which the inverted cone symbolizes. On the\none hand, the cone is supposed to rotate. Bergson compares the\nexperience of true memory to a telescope, which allows us to understand\nthe rotating movement. What we are supposed to visualize with the cone\nis a telescope that we are pointing up at the night sky. Thus, when I\nam trying to remember something, I at first see nothing all. What will\nhelp us understand this image is the idea of my character. When I\ntry to remember how my character came about, at first, I might not\nremember anything; no image might at first come to mind. Pure memory\nfor Bergson precedes images; it is unconscious. But, I try to focus, as\nif I were rotating the rings that control the lenses in the\n“telescope”; then some singular images come into view.\nRotation is really the key to Bergson’s concept of virtuality. Always,\nwe start with something like the Milky Way, a cloud of\ninterpenetration; but then the cloud starts to condense into singular\ndrops, into singular stars. This movement from interpenetration to\nfragmentation, from unity to multiplicity, (and even from multiplicity\nto juxtaposition) is always potential or virtual. But the reverse\nprocess is also virtual. Therefore the cone has a second movement,\n“contraction” (Matter and Memory, p. 168). If we\nremain with the telescope image, we can see that the images of the\nconstellation must be narrowed, brought down the tube so that they will\nfit into my eye. Here we have a movement from singular images to\ngeneralities, on which action can be based. The movement of memory\nalways results in action. But also, for Bergson, this twofold movement\nof rotation and contraction can be repeated in language. Even though\nBergson never devotes much reflection to language – we shall\nreturn to this point below– he is well aware that literary\ncreation resembles natural creation. Here we should consult his early\nessay on laughter. But, with this creative movement, which is memory,\nwe can turn to creative evolution. \n\nFor Bergson, the notion of life mixes together two opposite senses,\nwhich must be differentiated and then led into a genuine unity. On the\none hand, it is clear from Bergson’s earlier works that life is the\nabsolute temporal movement informed by duration and retained in memory.\nBut, on the other hand, he has shown that life also consists in the\npractical necessities imposed on our body and accounting for our\nhabitual mode of knowing in spatial terms. More specifically then,\nBergson’s project in Creative Evolution is to offer a\nphilosophy capable of accounting both for the continuity of all living\nbeings—as creatures—and for the discontinuity implied in\nthe evolutionary quality of this creation. Bergson starts out by\nshowing that the only way in which the two senses of life may be\nreconciled (without being collapsed) is to examine real life, the real\nevolution of the species, that is, the phenomenon of change and its\nprofound causes. His argument consists of four main steps. First, he\nshows that there must be an original common impulse which explains the\ncreation of all living species; this is his famous vital impulse\n(élan vital). Second, the diversity resulting from evolution\nmust be accounted for as well. If the original impulse is common to all\nlife, then there must also be a principle of divergence and\ndifferentiation that explains evolution; this is Bergson’s tendency\ntheory. Third, the two main diverging tendencies that account for\nevolution can ultimately be identified as instinct on the one hand and\nintelligence on the other. Human knowledge results from the form and\nthe structure of intelligence. We learned from “The Introduction\nto Metaphysics” that intelligence consists precisely in an\nanalytic, external, hence essentially practical and spatialized\napproach to the world. Unlike instinct, human intelligence is therefore\nunable to attain to the essence of life in its duration. The\nparadoxical situation of humanity (the only species that wants to know\nlife is also the only one that cannot do so) must therefore be\novercome. So, fourth, the effort of intuition what allows us to place\nourselves back within the original creative impulse so as to overcome\nthe numerous obstacles that stand in the way of true knowledge (which\nare instantiated in the history of metaphysics). We are going to look\nat each of these four steps.  \n\nFirst, we are going to look at the concept of vital impulse. In\nCreative Evolution, Bergson starts out by criticizing\nmechanism as it applies to the concepts of life and evolution. The\nmechanistic approach would preclude the possibility of any real change\nor creativity, as each development would be potentially contained in\nthe preceding ones. However, Bergson continues, the teleological\napproach of traditional finalism equally makes genuine creation of the\nnew impossible, since it entails, just as mechanism, that the\n“whole is given.” Therefore, neither mechanism nor strict\nfinalism can give a satisfying account of the phenomenon of change that\ncharacterizes life. Nevertheless, Bergson argues, there is a certain\nform of finalism that would adequately account for the creation of life\nwhile allowing for the diversity resulting from creation. It is the\nidea of an original vital principle. If there is a telos to life, then,\nit must be situated at the origin and not at the end (contra\ntraditional finalism), and it must embrace the whole of life in one\nsingle indivisible embrace (contra mechanism). But, this hypothesis\ndoes not yet account for evolution in the diversity of its products,\nnor does it explain the principle of the nature of life. \n\nSecond, we turn to Bergson’s account of the\n“complexification” of life, that is, the phenomenon of its\nevolution from the simple original vital impulse into different\nspecies, individuals, and organs. The successive series of bifurcations\nand differentiations that life undergoes organize itself into two great\nopposite tendencies, namely, instinct and intelligence. Bergson arrives\nat this fundamental distinction by considering the different modes\nthrough which creatures act in and know the external world. Animals are\ndistinguished from plants on the basis of their mobility, necessitated\nby their need to find food,whereas plants survive and grow through\nphotosynthesis, which does not require locomotion. While the\nrelationship between consciousness and matter instantiated in the\ninstinct of animals is sufficient and well adapted to their survival\n(from the point of view of the species), humans are not adequately\nequipped in this respect; hence the necessity of something like\nintelligence, defined by the ability to make tools. Humanity is\nessentially homo faber. Once again, from the point of view of\nreal, concrete life that Bergson is here embracing, intelligence is\nessentially defined by its pragmatic orientation (and not speculation,\nas a dogmatic intellectualist approach would assume). From this,\nBergson deduces not only the cognitive structure and the scientific\nhistory of intelligence (which he examines in detail), but also its\nlimitations. This essentially pragmatic, hence analytic and\nquantitative orientation of intelligence precludes its immediate access\nto the essentially qualitative nature of life. Notice that the\ndistinction between the two tendencies relies on the original\ndistinction between the qualitative and the quantitative\nmultiplicities. In any case, in order that human intelligence may\nattain true knowledge of the essence of the vital impulse, it will have\nto proceed by means of a mode of knowing that lies at the opposite end\nof intelligence, namely, instinct. \n\nThroughout Creative Evolution, Bergson’s crucial point is\nthat life must be equated with creation, as creativity alone can\nadequately account for both the continuity of life and the\ndiscontinuity of the products of evolution. But now the question is: if\nhumans only possess analytic intelligence, then how are we ever to know\nthe essence of life? Bergson’s answer — his third step — is\nthat, because at the periphery of intelligence a fringe of instinct\nsurvives, we are able fundamentally to rejoin the essence of life. For,\nas the tendency and the multiplicity theories made clear, instinct and\nintelligence are not simply self-contained and mutually exclusive\nstates. They must be called tendencies precisely because they are both\nrooted in, hence inseparable from, the duration that informs all life,\nall change, all becoming. There is, therefore, a little bit of instinct\nsurviving within each intelligent being, making it immediately —\nif only partially — coincide with the original vital impulse.\nThis partial coincidence, as we described above, is what founds\nintuition. \n\nFinally, we can return to the question of intuition. Thanks to\nintuition, humanity can turn intelligence against itself so as to seize\nlife itself. By a very different route than the one we saw before,\nBergson shows, once again, that our habitual way of knowing, based in\nneeds, is the only obstacle to knowledge of the absolute. Here he\nargues that this obstacle consists in the idea of disorder. All\ntheories of knowledge have in one way or another attempted to explain\nmeaning and consistency by assuming the contingency of order. The\ntraditional question, “why is there order rather than\ndisorder?” necessarily assumes that the human mind is able to\ncreate order mysteriously out of chaos. But, for Bergson, the real\nquestion is: “order is certainly contingent, but in relation to\nwhat” (Creative Evolution, p. 232)? His answer consists\nin showing that it is not a matter of order versus disorder, but rather\nof one order in relation to another. According to Bergson, it is the\nsame reasoning that underlies the ideas of chance (as opposed to\nnecessity), and of nothingness (as opposed to existence). In a word,\nthe real is essentially positive. The real obeys a certain kind of\norganization, namely, that of the qualitative multiplicity. Structured\naround its needs and interests, our intelligence fails to recognize\nthis ultimate reality. \n\nHowever, a fringe of intuition remains, dormant most of the time yet\ncapable of awakening when certain vital interests are at stake. The\nrole of the philosopher is to seize those rare and discontinuous\nintuitions in order to support them, then dilate them and connect them\nto one another. In this process, philosophy realizes that intuition\ncoincides with spirit, and eventually with life itself. Intuition and\nintelligence thus each correspond to tendencies within the human\npsyche, which, as whole, thereby coincides immediately —\nif only partially — with the vital impulse. It is only by leaping\ninto intuition that the ultimate unity of mental life appears, for,\njust as Bergson showed against Zeno, that mobility cannot be\nreconstructed out of immobility. Here he explains that while one can go\nfrom intuition to intelligence by way of diminution, the analytic\nnature of intelligence precludes the opposite process. Thus Bergson\nconcludes, “philosophy introduces us into spiritual life. And at\nthe same time, it shows us the relation of the life of spirit to the\nlife of the body” (Creative Evolution, p. 268). In a\nword, it is life in its creativity which unifies the simplicity of\nspirit with the diversity of matter. And it is a certain kind of\nphilosophy, insofar as it is able to place itself back within the\ncreative impulse, which is capable of realizing the necessary\n“complementarity” of the diverse, partial views\ninstantiated in the different branches of scientific knowledge and\nmetaphysical thought — so as to reestablish the absoluteness of\nknowledge, defined by its coincidence with absolute becoming. \n\nBergson himself says that his final book, The Two Sources of\nMorality and Religion, develops ideas from Creative\nEvolution. It attempts to show that there are two sources from\nwhich two kinds of morality and religion evolve. As always with\nBergson, Kant is at issue, in this case his moral philosophy. And as\nusual, Bergson starts by differentiating within a mixture. Under the\nword “morality” or under the phrase “moral\nobligation,” there is a mixture of two kinds of morality. \n\nThere is the closed morality, whose religion is static, and there is\nthe open morality, whose religion is dynamic. Closed morality and\nstatic religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made\ncertain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these\nspecies cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the\nsupport of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of\ncourse, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs\nwhich must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the\nclosed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the\nrules of closed moralities. Kant’s moral philosophy has its\nsource in such needs. The survival of the community requires that there\nbe strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although Kant’s\ncategorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is not,\naccording to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed morality\nreally concerns the survival of a society, my society. Therefore, it\nalways excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson, closed morality\nis always concerned with war. And static religion, the religion of\nclosed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the “fabulation\nfunction.” The fabulation function is a particular function of\nthe imagination that creates “voluntary hallucinations.”\nThe fabulation function takes our sense that there is a presence\nwatching over us and invents images of gods. These images then insure\nstrict obedience to the closed morality. In short, they insure social\ncohesion. \n\nBut, there is another kind of morality and religion, according to\nBergson. The open morality and dynamic religion are concerned with\ncreativity and progress. They are not concerned with social cohesion,\nand thus Bergson calls this morality “open” because it\nincludes everyone. The open morality is genuinely universal and it\naims at peace. It aims at an “open society.” The source of the open\nmorality is what Bergson calls “creative emotions.” The\ndifference between creative emotions and normal emotions consists in\nthis: in normal emotions, we first have a representation which causes\nthe feeling (I see my friend and then I feel happy); in creative\nemotion, we first have the emotion which then creates\nrepresentations. So, Bergson gives us the example of the joy of a\nmusician who, on the basis of emotion, creates a symphony, and who then\nproduces representations of the music in the score. We can see here\nthat Bergson has also finally explained how the leap of an intuition\nhappens. The creative emotion makes one unstable and throws one out of\nthe habitual mode of intelligence, which is directed at needs. Indeed,\nin The Two Sources, Bergson compares creative emotions to\nunstable mental states as those found in the mad. But what he really\nhas in mind is mystical experience. For Bergson, however, mystical\nexperience is not simply a disequilibrium. Genuine mystical experience\nmust result in action; it cannot remain simple contemplation of\nGod. This association of creative emotions with mystical experience\nmeans that, for Bergson, dynamic religion is mystical. Indeed, dynamic\nreligion, because it is always creative, cannot be associated with any\nparticular organized set of doctrines. A religion with organized\n– and rigid — doctrines is always static. \n\nThe phrase with which we began, “moral obligation,”\nmakes one think of Kantian duty. We have alluded to Kant on several\noccasions, but, let us conclude by examining Bergson’s explicit\ncriticism of Kant’s moral philosophy. This criticism will demonstrate\nthe strength of Bergson’s moral philosophy and of his thought as a\nwhole. According to Bergson, Kant’s theory has made a\n“psychological error.” In any given society, there are many\ndifferent, particular obligations. The individual in society may at\nsome time desire to deviate from one particular obligation. When this\nillicit desire arises, there will be resistance from society but also\nfrom his habits. If the individual resists these resistances, a\npsychological state of tension or contraction occurs. The individual,\nin other words, experiences the rigidity of the obligation. Now,\naccording to Bergson, when philosophers such as Kant attribute a severe\naspect to duty, they have externalized this experience of obligation’s\ninflexibility. In fact, for Bergson, if we ignore the multiplicity of\nparticular obligations in any given society, and if instead we look at\nwhat he calls “the whole of obligation” (The Two\nSources, p. 25), then we see that obedience to obligation is\nalmost natural. According to Bergson, obligations, that is, customs,\narise because of the natural need an individual has for the stability\nthat a society can give. As a result of this natural need, society\ninculcates habits of obedience in the individual. Habituation means\nthat obedience to the whole of obligation is, in fact, for the\nindividual, effortless. \n\nThe psychological error then consists in externalizing an\nexceptional experience – which Bergson calls “resistance to\nthe resistances” – into a moral theory. Duty becomes severe\nand inflexible. But there is more to this error. Kant believes\nthat he can resolve obligation into rational elements. In the\nexperience of resistance to the resistances, the individual has an\nillicit desire. And, since the individual is intelligent, the\nindividual uses intelligence, a rational method, to act on itself.\nAccording to Bergson, what is happening here is that the rational\nmethod is merely restoring the force of the original tendency to obey\nthe whole of obligation that society has inculcated in the individual.\nBut as Bergson notes, the tendency is one thing; the rational method is\nanother. The success of the rational method, however, gives us the\nillusion that the force with which an individual obeys any particular\nobligation comes from reason, that is, from the idea or representation,\nor better still, from the formula of the obligation. \n\nBut, there is another force. The second force is what Bergson calls\n“the impetus of love” (The Two Sources, p. 96).\nThe impetus of love, like joy but also like sympathy, is a creative\nemotion. The emotion must be explicated into actions and\nrepresentations. But, this process of explication can be extended. The\nrepresentations that the mystic explicates can be further explicated\ninto formulas, for example, the formula of each person being deserving\nof respect and dignity. These formulas, which are the expression of\ncreation and love, are now able to be mixed with the formulas that aim\nsolely to insure the stability of any given society. Since we are now\nspeaking only of formulas, creation and cohesion, the two forces, are\nmixed together in reason. As before, whereas the rational method used\nin the experience of resistance to the resistances comes to explain the\nforce of obedience, here in the mystical experience of the impetus of\nlove the formulas come to explain the force of creation. A reversal has\ntaken place. The very forces that have generated the formulas are\ninstead now being explained by those very formulas. Indeed, this is the\nproblem. How could some representation of intelligence have the power\nto train the will?  How could an idea categorically demand its own\nrealization?  As Bergson says, “Re-establish the duality [of\nforces], the difficulties vanish” (The Two Sources, p.\n96). The two forces are, however, but two complementary manifestations\nof life. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for Bergson’s disappearance from the\nphilosophical scene after World War II. First, at least in France, a\nnew generation of philosophers was arising, in particular, Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty. Like any new generation, this one had to differentiate\nitself from the tradition it was inheriting; in many respects,\nBergson’s thought dominated this tradition. But more important was the\nfact that Sartre and Merleau-Ponty became interested in Husserlian\nphenomenology, and then in Heidegger’s thought. The influence of German\nphilosophy on post-World War II French thought is well known. It\ncontributed to the eclipse of Bergson. But, there are some aspects of\nBergson’s thought itself which contributed to this eclipse. On the one\nhand, there is Bergson’s constant suspicion of language; for Bergson,\nas we noted in the discussion of intuition, language is equivalent to\nsymbols. And, symbols divide the continuity of the duration, leading us\ninto illusions. Bergson’s criticisms of language, moreover, must have\nstruck the generation of French philosophers who came of age in the\n1960s as strange. Philosophers such as Derrida had so thoroughly\nembraced Heidegger that they believed that “language is the house\nof being.” On the other hand, there is the mysticism of The\nTwo Sources. The striking religious tone of this book did not\nharmonize well with Husserl’s phenomenology, which aimed to be a\nrigorous science.  \n\nYet, we can speak of a recent revitalization of Bergsonism. \nThis revitalization is due almost entirely to Deleuze. As we have come\nto understand Deleuze’s own thought better, we can see the overwhelming\ninfluence of Bergson. In particular, two aspects of Bergson’s thought\nattracted Deleuze. We have already mentioned one of them: the concept\nof multiplicity. This concept is at the very heart of Deleuze’s\nthought, and duration is the model for all of Deleuze’s\n“becomings.”  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze,\nwhich is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson’s criticism of the\nconcept of negation in Creative Evolution. We must recall that the\nlinguistic turn in France during the 1960s was accompanied by an\n“anti-Hegelianism.” Thus Bergson became a resource in the\ncriticism of the Hegelian dialectic, the negative. Moreover, at the end\nof his life, Merleau-Ponty was also coming to realize that Bergson’s\ncriticism of negation is philosophically important; for Merleau-Ponty,\nthe criticism seemed to function like Husserl’s “phenomenological\nreduction,” and perhaps re-opened what Heidegger would call the\nquestion of being. But, overall, we must see that a revitalization of\nBergsonism became possible because of Deleuze’s insistence that\nBergsonism is an alternative to the domination of phenomenological\nthought, including that of Heidegger. The revitalization of Bergsonism\nleads to a revitalization of the question of life itself, and not to\nthe retrieval of the question of being. \n\nIf Deleuze indeed presents a penetrating criticism of Heidegger, it\nlies in the claim that being (Sein) is a unity and not a\nmultiplicity (and in this regard Deleuze’s criticism of Heidegger\nresembles a great deal that of Derrida who always targets Heidegger’s\nidea of gathering [Versammlung]). For Deleuze (and perhaps\nfor Derrida as well), the lack of an idea of multiplicity affects\nHeidegger’s conception of a people. Even if the people in Heidegger\nare still coming, they will have a proper name that indicates their\ncommunity will be unified and perhaps closed. In contrast. the people\nto come in Deleuze (and the democracy to come in Derrida) remain in\nneed of a name which indicates that this people is a genuine\nmultiplicity. Perhaps in these ideas of an always still to be named\ncoming community, we find the enduring influence of Bergson’s\n“open society.” The most recent moment of the Bergson\nrevitalization follows on the idea of a people. Andrea J. Pitts and Mark William Westmoreland published a volume called: Beyond Bergson: Exploring Race, Gender,\nand Colonialism through the Writings of Henri Bergson (SUNY 2019). \n\nApart from Deleuze, and more recently, Frederic Worms has led the way\ntoward Bergson’s revitalization in France. Worms founded the Societe\ndes amis de Bergson in 2006. In 2019, several members of the Societe\ndes amis de Bergson founded the Global Bergson Research Project whose\npurpose lies in rediscovering Bergson’s influence all over the globe.\n\n","contact.mail":"lul19@psu.edu","contact.domain":"psu.edu"}]
