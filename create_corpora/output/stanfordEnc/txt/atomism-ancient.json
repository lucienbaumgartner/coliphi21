Some of these figures are treated\nin more depth in other articles in this encyclopedia: the reader is\nencouraged to consult individual entries on Leucippus, Democritus,\nEpicurus and Lucretius. These philosophers developed a systematic and\ncomprehensive natural philosophy accounting for the origins of\neverything from the interaction of indivisible bodies, as these\natoms—which have only a few intrinsic properties like size and\nshape—strike against one another, rebound and interlock in an\ninfinite void. This atomist natural philosophy eschewed teleological\nexplanation and denied divine intervention or design, regarding every\ncomposite of atoms as produced purely by material interactions of\nbodies, and accounting for the perceived properties of macroscopic\nbodies as produced by these same atomic interactions. Atomists\nformulated views on ethics, theology, political philosophy and\nepistemology consistent with this physical system. This powerful and\nconsistent materialism, somewhat modified from its original form by\nEpicurus, was regarded by Aristotle as a chief competitor to\nteleological natural philosophy.\n\n\n\nSince the Greek adjective atomos means, literally,\n‘uncuttable,’ the history of ancient atomism is not only\nthe history of a theory about the nature of matter, but also the\nhistory of the idea that there are indivisible parts in any kind of\nmagnitude—geometrical extension, time, etc. Although the term\n‘atomism’ is most often identified with the systems of\nnatural philosophy mentioned above, scholars have also identified\ncommitments to indivisibles in a number of lesser known figures. Often\nthese are formulated in response to paradoxes like those of Zeno of\nElea (early 5th c. BCE) about infinite divisibility of\nmagnitudes. Some of these identifications of other kinds of atomism\noutside the main tradition are controversial and based on slight\nevidence.\n\n\n\nLeucippus (5th c. BCE) is the earliest figure whose commitment to\natomism is well attested. He is usually credited with inventing\natomism. According to a passing remark by the geographer Strabo,\nPosidonius (1st c. BCE Stoic philosopher) reported that\nancient Greek atomism can be traced back to a figure known as Moschus\nor Mochus of Sidon, who lived at the time of the Trojan wars. This\nreport was given credence in the seventeenth century: the Cambridge\nPlatonist Henry More traced the origins of ancient atomism back, via\nPythagoras and Moschus, to Moses. This theologically motivated view\ndoes not seem to claim much historical evidence, however. \n\nIn 1877, Tannéry argued that Zeno of Elea’s arguments about\ndivisibility must have been formulated in response to some early\nPythagoreans. Tannéry’s view, which was widely accepted in the\nearly twentieth century, is based on the claim that one of Zeno’s\nparadoxes about the possibility of motion would best make sense if it\nwere attacking an atomist thesis, and thus that the Pythagoreans, who\nare reported to have talked of monads or unit numbers, must have been\natomists of a sort. Tannery’s thesis has been thoroughly challenged\nsince then: most scholars instead consider atomism to be one of a\nnumber of positions formulated in response to the arguments of\nParmenides and Zeno (first half of the fifth century).  A\nfourth-century Pythagorean, Ecphantus, interpreted the Pythagorean\nmonads as indivisible bodies: he is reported to have been sympathetic\nto atomism of a kind similar to Democritus’. Plato’s discussion of the\ncomposition of solids from plane surfaces is thought to be based on\nfourth-century Pythagorean theories. \n\nLeucippus and Democritus are widely regarded as the first atomists\nin the Greek tradition. Little is known about Leucippus, while the\nideas of his student Democritus—who is said to have taken over\nand systematized his teacher’s theory—are known from a large\nnumber of reports. These ancient atomists theorized that the two\nfundamental and oppositely characterized constituents of the natural\nworld are indivisible bodies—atoms—and void. The latter is\ndescribed simply as nothing, or the negation of body. Atoms are by\ntheir nature intrinsically unchangeable; they can only move about in\nthe void and combine into different clusters. Since the atoms are\nseparated by void, they cannot fuse, but must rather bounce off one\nanother when they collide. Because all macroscopic objects are in fact\ncombinations of atoms, everything in the macroscopic world is subject\nto change, as their constituent atoms shift or move away. Thus, while\nthe atoms themselves persist through all time, everything in the world\nof our experience is transitory and subject to dissolution. \n\nAccording to Aristotle’s presentation (On Generation and\nCorruption I 8), the motivation for the first postulation of\nindivisible bodies is to answer a metaphysical puzzle about the\npossibility of change and multiplicity. Parmenides had argued that any\ndifferentiation or change in Being implies that ‘what is\nnot’ either is or comes to be. Although there are problems in\ninterpreting Parmenides’ precise meaning, he was understood to have\nraised a problem about how change can be possible without something\ncoming from nothing. Several Presocratics formulated, in response,\nphilosophical systems in which change is not considered to require\nsomething coming into being from complete nonexistence, but rather the\narrangement of preexisting elements into new combinations. The atomists\nheld that, like Being, as conceived by Parmenides, the atoms are\nunchangeable and contain no internal differentiation of a sort that\nwould allow for division. But there are many Beings, not just one,\nwhich are separated from another by nothing, i.e. by void. \n\nBy positing indivisible bodies, the atomists were also thought to be\nanswering Zeno’s paradoxes about the impossibility of motion. Zeno had\nargued that, if magnitudes can be divided to infinity, it would be\nimpossible for motion to occur. The problem seems to be that a body\nmoving would have to traverse an infinite number of spaces in a finite\ntime. By supposing that the atoms form the lowest limit to division,\nthe atomists escape from this dilemma: a total space traversed has only\na finite number of parts. As it is unclear whether the earliest\natomists understood the atoms to be physically or theoretically\nindivisible, they may not have made the distinction. \n\nThe changes in the world of macroscopic objects are caused by\nrearrangements of the atomic clusters. Atoms can differ in size, shape,\norder and position (the way they are turned); they move about in the\nvoid, and—depending on their shape—some can temporarily\nbond with one another by means of tiny hooks and barbs on their\nsurfaces. Thus the shape of individual atoms affects the macroscopic\ntexture of clusters of atoms, which may be fluid and yielding or firm\nand resistant, depending on the amount of void space between and the\ncoalescence of the atomic shapes. The texture of surfaces and the\nrelative density and fragility of different materials are also\naccounted for by the same means. \n\nThe atomists accounted for perception by means of films of atoms\nsloughed off from their surfaces by external objects, and entering and\nimpacting the sense organs. They tried to account for all sensible\neffects by means of contact, and regarded all sense perceptions as\ncaused by the properties of the atoms making up the films acting on the\natoms of animals’ sense organs. Perceptions of color are caused by the\n‘turning’ or position of the atoms; tastes are caused by\nthe texture of atoms on the tongue, e.g., bitter tastes by the tearing\ncaused by sharp atoms; feelings of heat are ascribed to friction.\nDemocritus was taken by Aristotle to have considered thought to be a\nmaterial process involving the local rearrangement of bodies, just as\nmuch as is perception. \n\nA famous quotation from Democritus distinguishes between perceived\nproperties like colors and tastes, which exist only ‘by\nconvention,’ in contrast to the reality, which is atoms and void.\nHowever, he apparently recognized an epistemological problem for an\nempiricist philosophy that nonetheless regards the objects of sense as\nunreal. In another famous quotation, the senses accuse the mind of\noverthrowing them, although mind is dependent on the senses. The\naccusation is that, by developing an atomist theory that undermines the\nbasis for confidence in sense perception, thought has in effect\nundercut its own foundation on knowledge gained through the senses.\nDemocritus sometimes seems to doubt or deny the possibility of\nknowledge. \n\nThe early atomists try to account for the formation of the natural\nworld by means of their simple ontology of atoms and void alone.\nLeucippus held that there are an infinite number of atoms moving for\nall time in an infinite void, and that these can form into cosmic\nsystems or kosmoi by means of a whirling motion which randomly\nestablishes itself in a large enough cluster of atoms. It is\ncontroversial whether atoms are thought to have weight as an intrinsic\nproperty, causing them all to fall in some given direction, or whether\nweight is simply a tendency for atoms (which otherwise move in any and\nevery direction, except when struck) to move towards the centre of a\nsystem, created by the whirling of the cosmic vortices. When a vortex\nis formed, it creates a membrane of atoms at its outer edge, and the\nouter band of atoms catches fire, forming a sun and stars. These\nkosmoi are impermanent, and are not accounted for by purpose\nor design. The earth is described as a flat cylindrical drum at the\ncenter of our cosmos. \n\nSpecies are not regarded as permanent abstract forms, but as the\nresult of chance combinations of atoms. Living things are regarded as\nhaving a psychê or principle of life; this is identified\nwith fiery atoms. Organisms are thought to reproduce by means of seed:\nDemocritus seems to have held that both parents produce seeds composed\nof fragments from each organ of their body. Whichever of the parts\ndrawn from the relevant organ of the parents predominates in the new\nmixture determines which characteristics are inherited by the\noffspring. Democritus is reported to have given an account of the\norigin of human beings from the earth. He is also said to be the\nfounder of a kind of cultural anthropology, since his account of the\norigin of the cosmos includes an account of the origin of human\ninstitutions, including language and social and political\norganization. \n\nA large group of reports about Democritus’ views concern ethical\nmaxims: some scholars have tried to regard these as systematic or\ndependent on atomist physics, while others doubt the closeness of the\nconnection. Because several maxims stress the value of\n‘cheerfulness,’ Democritus is sometimes portrayed as\n‘the laughing philosopher.’ \n\nAlthough the Greek term atomos is most commonly associated\nwith the philosophical system developed by Leucippus and Democritus,\ninvolving solid and impenetrable bodies, Plato’s Timaeus\npresents a different kind of physical theory based on indivisibles. The\ndialogue elaborates an account of the world wherein the four different\nbasic kinds of matter—earth, air, fire, and water—are\nregular solids composed from plane figures: isoceles and scalene\nright-angled triangles. Because the same triangles can form into\ndifferent regular solids, the theory thus explains how some of the\nelements can transform into one another, as was widely believed. \n\nIn this theory, it is the elemental triangles composing the solids\nthat are regarded as indivisible, not the solids themselves. When\nAristotle discusses the hypothesis that the natural world is composed\nof indivisibles, the two views he considers are Plato’s and\nDemocritus’, although he seems to have more respect for the latter\nview. Aristotle criticizes both Plato’s and the fourth-century\nPythagorean attempts to construct natural bodies possessing weight from\nindivisible mathematical abstractions, whether plane surfaces or\nnumbers. \n\nIt has been suggested that Plato accepted time atoms, i.e.,\nindivisible minima in time, but this is controversial. A report by\nAristotle suggests that the belief of Plato’s student Xenocrates in the\nexistence of indivisible lines was also shared by Plato; other\ntestimony suggests that points are really what Plato refers to as\nindivisible. \n\nIn late antiquity, the Neoplatonist Proclus defended Plato’s account\nagainst Aristotle’s objections; these arguments are preserved in\nSimplicius’ commentary on Aristotle’s On the Heavens.\nSimplicius credits the Pythagoreans as well as Plato with a theory\ncomposing bodies from plane surfaces. Simplicius also compares\nPythagorean views to Democritean atomism, inasmuch as both theories\nposit a cause for hot and cold, rather than taking these to be\nfundamental principles, as the Aristotelians do. \n\nA treatise in the Aristotelian corpus probably not by Aristotle\nhimself (On Indivisible Lines) addresses and refutes a number\nof arguments offered for the existence of indivisible lines, without\nnaming their author. Plato’s student Xenocrates (396–314 BCE), third\nhead of the Academy, is reported to believe in indivisible lines, and\nhe may well be the target of the Aristotelian treatise. \n\nOne of the arguments attacked addresses a Zenonian problem about\ntraversing or touching in succession an infinite series of parts. The\nidea that there are indivisible lines offers an alternative to the view\nthat any extended magnitude must be divisible to infinity. Another\nargument concerns Platonic Forms, and would only apply to those who\naccepted their existence. It argues that the Form of a triangle\npresupposes the existence of a Form of a line, and adds that this ideal\nline cannot have parts, presumably because parts are taken to be prior\nto the whole they compose and Forms need to have a kind of primacy to\nbe explanatory. A distinct argument also depends on the idea of\npriority: it is argued that if the physical elements composing a body\nare regarded as the ultimate parts prior to a whole, they cannot be\nfurther divisible. Although this does not argue for indivisible lines\nper se, it is used to suggest that the objects of sense as\nwell as those of thought must include things without parts. \n\nA further argument depends on thinking that opposite properties must\nhave opposite characteristics: if ‘many’ or\n‘large’ things have infinite parts, it is argued, then\n‘few’ or ‘small’ things must have only a finite\nnumber of parts. It is then concluded that there must be a magnitude\nwithout parts, apparently so that it is not further divisible and thus\ncomposed of an infinite number of parts. The last argument depends on\nthe idea that mathematicians talk of commensurable lines, and posit a\nsingle unit of measurement: this would not be possible if the unit were\ndivisible, because the parts of the unit, if measured, would be\nmeasured by the unit measure and it would then turn out to contain\nmultiple units within itself. \n\nAn argument in Aristotle (Physics 1.4, 187b14–21) is\nsometimes taken by later writers as evidence that Aristotle allowed\nfor the existence of minima in natural things. Aristotle writes that\nthere is a smallest size of material substrate on which it is possible\nfor the form of a given natural tissue to occur. Blood and bone, say,\nare all materially composed of given proportions of earth, air, fire,\nand water: there needs to be a certain minimal amount of these\nmaterial components present before the form of blood or bone can\noccur. This doctrine, while it is surely compatible with the view that\nthe material components are nonetheless infinitely divisible, is\nsometimes read, by some Neoplatonist commentators and later sources\ninterested in atomist theory, as evidence that Aristotle endorsed the\nexistence of minimal physical parts.  In late antiquity, this debate\nseems to have moved away from the radical solution of positing minimal\nphysical parts or atoms—a view that seems to have had few\nadvocates—into a puzzle about the possibilities of ‘bottom\nup’ explanation or the need to regard emergent properties as\n‘supervening’ and not mere products of the necessary\nmaterial base. \n\nDiodorus Cronus (late 4th c. BCE), a member of the supposed\nDialectical School, is reported to have offered new arguments that\nthere must be partless bodies or magnitudes. Most reports suggest that\nhis focus was on logical arguments rather than on physical theory: he\nused arguments that depend on positing mutually exhaustive\nalternatives. \n\nPerhaps drawing on an argument of Aristotle’s (Sens. 7,\n449a20–31]), Diodorus apparently used the idea that there is a smallest\nsize at which an object at a given distance is visible as the basis for\nan argument that there are indivisible magnitudes. His argument begins\nfrom the idea that there is a difference in size between the smallest\nsize at which a given object is visible—presumably from a given\ndistance—and the largest size at which it is invisible. Unless we\nconcede that, at some magnitude, a body is both invisible and visible\n(or neither), there cannot be any other magnitude intermediate between\nthese two magnitudes. Magnitudes must increase by discrete units. \n\nSextus Empiricus (AM 10.48ff) reports an argument of\nDiodorus’ also concluding that magnitudes have discrete intervals. It\nalso denies the existence of moving bodies, insisting that bodies move\nneither when they are in the place where they are, nor when they are in\nthe place where they are not. Since these alternatives are presented as\nexhaustive, the conclusion must be that bodies are never moving.\nHowever, rather than assert that everything is static, Diodorus took\nthe view that bodies must have moved without ever\nbeing in motion: they are simply at one place at one moment,\nand at another place at another moment. \n\nAs well as postulating the existence of indivisible smallest bodies\nand magnitudes, Diodorus seems to have supposed that there are\nindivisible smallest units of time. The argument about motion does not\nquite make it explicit that this is what he is committed to, but it is\na reasonable inference: given his insistence that bodies are always at\none place or another at any given time, he might well suppose that\ninfinite divisibility of time would open up the threatening possibility\nof indeterminacy as to whether the change of place has taken place. \n\nFor those who posit indivisibles as a way to escape paradoxes about\ninfinite divisibility, parallel arguments might equally well have been\napplied to the problem of completing tasks in an infinitely divisible\ntime. Sextus Empiricus reports that the Aristotelian Strato of\nLampsacus (d. 268/70 BCE) argued for time atoms, although this is\ncontradicted by other sources. Sorabji 1983 suggests that Strato merely\ncountenanced the possibility that time could be discrete while\nspace and motion are continuous, without endorsing this position. \n\nDemocritus’ atomism was revived in the early Hellenistic period, and\nan atomist school founded in Athens about 306, by Epicurus (341–270\nBCE). The Epicureans formed more of a closed community than other\nschools, and promoted a philosophy of a simple, pleasant life lived\nwith friends. The community included women, and some of its members\nraised children. The works of the founder were revered and some of them\nwere memorized, a practice that may have discouraged philosophical\ninnovation by later members of the school. \n\nEpicurus seems to have learned of atomist doctrine through\nDemocritus’ follower Nausiphanes. Because Epicurus made some\nsignificant changes in atomist theory, it is often thought that his\nreformulation of the physical theory is an attempt to respond to\nAristotle’s criticisms of Democritus. Even more significant, however,\nis the increasing centrality of ethical concerns to Epicurus’ atomism,\nand the importance of the view that belief in an atomist physical\ntheory helps us live better lives. \n\nEpicurus takes to heart a problem Democritus himself recognized (see\n2. above), which is that atomist theory threatens to undermine itself\nif it removes any trust we can place in the evidence of the senses, by\nclaiming that colors, etc. are unreal. He notoriously said that\n‘all perception is true,’ apparently distinguishing between\nthe causal processes which impact our senses, all of which originate\nwith the films of atoms sloughed off by objects, and the judgments we\nmake on the basis of them, which may be false. Reasoning to truths\nabout things that are not apparent—like the existence of\natoms—depends on the evidence of the senses, which is always true\nin that it consists of impacts from actually existing films. For\nparticular phenomena, like meteorological events, Epicurus endorses the\nexistence of multiple valid explanations, acknowledging that we may\nhave no evidence for preferring one explanation over another. \n\nIt may be that Epicurus was less troubled by any such\nepistemological uncertainties because of his emphasis on the value of\natomist theory for teaching us how to live the untroubled and tranquil\nlife. Denying any divine sanction for morality, and holding that the\nexperience of pleasure and pain are the source of all value, Epicurus\nthought we can learn from atomist philosophy that pursuing natural and\nnecessary pleasures—rather than the misleading desires inculcated\nby society—will make pleasure readily attainable. At the same\ntime, we will avoid the pains brought on by pursuing unnatural and\nunnecessary pleasures. Understanding, on the basis of the atomist\ntheory, that our fears of the gods and of death are groundless will\nfree us from our chief mental pains. \n\nEpicurus made significant changes to atomist physical theory, and\nsome of these have been traced to Aristotle’s criticisms of Democritus.\nIt seems that Democritus did not properly distinguish between the\nthesis of the physical uncuttability of atoms and that of their\nconceptual indivisibility: this raises a problem about how atoms can\nhave parts, as evidenced by their variations in shape or their ability\nto compose a magnitude, touching one another in a series on different\nsides. Epicurus distinguished the two, holding that uncuttable atoms\ndid have conceptually distinct parts, but that there was a lowest limit\nto these. \n\nEpicurus’ view of the motion of atoms also differs from Democritus’.\nRather than talking of a motion towards the center of a given cosmos,\npossibly created by the cosmic vortex, Epicurus grants to atoms an\ninnate tendency to downward motion through the infinite cosmos. The\ndownward direction is simply the original direction of atomic fall .\nThis may be in response to Aristotelian criticisms that Democritus does\nnot show why atomic motion exists, merely saying that it is eternal and\nthat it is perpetuated by collisions. Moreover, although this is not\nattested in the surviving writings of Epicurus, authoritative later\nsources attribute to him the idea that it belongs to the nature of\natoms occasionally to exhibit a slight, otherwise uncaused swerve from\ntheir downward path. This is thought to explain why atoms have from\ninfinite time entered into collisions instead of falling in parallel\npaths: it is also said, by Lucretius, to enter into the account of\naction and responsibility. Scholars have proposed a number of\nalternative interpretations as to how this is thought to work. \n\nEpicurus seems to have taken a different view on the nature of\nproperties, denying Democritus’ claim that perceived properties only\nexist ‘by convention’. His successor Polystratus further\ndefended and elaborated a claim about the reality of properties,\nincluding relational properties. Moreover, with the recovery of new\npapyrological evidence, controversy has arisen about the extent to\nwhich Epicurus rejected Democritus’ attempt to account for all causal\nprocesses by the properties of the atoms and void alone. Although\nEpicurus’ ideas have long been known from three surviving letters\npreserved in the biography by Diogenes Laertius, no copy of his longer\nwork On Nature had been available. However, following\nexcavation of the Epicurean library at Herculaneum that was buried by a\nvolcanic eruption, some parts of this work are being recovered. Many of\nthe scrolls found are badly damaged, however, and interpretation of\nthis newly recovered material is ongoing. \n\nThe Herculaneum library contains much work of the Epicurean\nPhilodemus (1st c. BCE). Philodemus wrote extensively, including on the\nhistory of philosophy, ethics, music, poetry, rhetoric and the\nemotions. He wrote a treatise on the theory of signs: because they are\nempiricists, believing that all knowledge comes from our sense\nexperience, later Epicureans were concerned about the basis for our\nknowledge of imperceptibles like the atoms, and engaged in an extensive\ndebate with the Stoics about the grounds for inferences to\nimperceptible entities. \n\nAlthough Epicurus’ doctrines teach the value of a quiet life in a\nspecially constructed Epicurean community and decry the search for\nfame, atomist theory is also regarded as a cure for the troubles\nafflicting others outside the community, and there are certainly\nEpicurean texts written for a wider audience. Besides the letters by\nEpicurus himself summarizing his doctrines, the Epicurean philosopher\nLucretius (d. c. 50 BCE) wrote a long Latin poem advocating Epicurus’\nideas to Roman audiences. Lucretius makes clear his close allegiance to\nEpicurus’ own views, and provides more detail on some topics than has\nsurvived from Epicurus’ own work, such as an extended account of the\norigins of human society and institutions. A less sympathetic\ncontemporary of Lucretius, Cicero, also wrote a number of Latin works\nin which an Epicurean spokesman presents the doctrines of the school.\nDiogenes of Oenoanda propagated Epicurean doctrines in Asia Minor,\ninscribing them on the wall of a Stoa in his home town. Excavation of\nthese since the nineteenth century has also produced new texts, aimed\nat converting passersby to Epicurean theory. Smith 1993, in his latest\nedition of the text of the inscriptions, dates them to the early second\ncentury CE. \n\nSome figures concerned with the natural sciences, especially\nmedicine, are thought to have regarded organic bodies as made of some\nkind of particles. The details of these views are often obscure. Galen,\nin On the Natural Faculties, divides medical theorists into\ntwo groups, following the division of natural philosophers. On the one\nside are continuum theorists, who hold that all matter is infinitely\ndivisible but that all the matter in things subject to generation and\ncorruption is susceptible to qualitative alteration. On the other are\nthose who suppose that matter is composed of tiny, unchangeable\nparticles separated by void spaces, and explain qualitative change as\nproduced only in compound bodies, by rearrangement of the particles\nalone. In Galen’s view, qualitative alteration is needed to produce the\npowers whereby beneficent Nature directs change: Galen credits the\nfirst group with asserting the priority of Nature and its beneficent\norder, and the latter with denying this. \n\nAlthough ancient natural philosophers tend to fall on either side of\nGalen’s divide—continuum theory plus beneficent teleology, vs.\natomism plus blind necessity— there is a danger in taking this\ndichotomy to be exhaustive or exclusive of possible natural\nphilosophies. Inasmuch as the view Plato develops in Timaeus\nis atomistic and also endorses teleological explanation, for example,\nhis position complicates the picture, and other theories of natural\nphilosophy in the Hellenistic period do not divide so neatly onto one\nside or the other. Galen has polemical interests in discrediting those\nwho deny the need for qualitatively irreducible faculties or powers\nemployed by Nature to produce beneficial results. In cases where we\nhave only scattered reports and secondhand information, it is\ndifficult to know which views should be counted as atomistic.  A\nprevailing tendency in modern scholarship to identify atomist\ntendencies with ‘mechanistic’ thinking is not\ncharacteristic of ancient Greek atomism: the identification was made\nin the work of Henry More and Robert Boyle in the 17th century.  Galen\nelsewhere explicitly contrasts atomist thought with the schools who\nappeal to ideas from mechanics. \n\nThe theories of Heracleides of Pontus (4th c. BCE) and Asclepiades\nof Bythnia (2nd c. BCE) are sometimes likened to atomism. Both—a\npupil of Plato, and a medical theorist—are said to have posited\nthe existence of corpuscles they call anarmoi onkoi, i.e. some\nkind of ‘masses’, but the  precise meaning is disputed.\nAlthough the theories of Asclepiades in particular are often\nassimilated to atomism, there is reason to think that Galen’s\nidentification of his view as atomistic is polemical, and that\nAsclepiades’ particles are capable of division into infinitely many\npieces. Erasistratus of Ceos, one of the great anatomists of the third\ncentury BCE, is another of those whom Galen suggests may have been on\nthe atomist side, despite his acceptance of design in nature.\nErasistratus had posited that the tissues of the body are composed of a\ntriple braid of vein, artery and nerve: Galen reports that even the\ntissue of the nerve is made up of this tiny braid. He claims that the\nErasistrateans are divided as to whether the elemental nerve tissue is\na continuous mass or is composed of small particles like those of the\natomists. \n\nOne of the most prominent writers on mechanics in antiquity, Hero of\nAlexandria (1st c. CE), has been regarded, following Hermann Diels, as\nan atomist. In the introduction to his Pneumatica, he\ndescribes matter as made up of particles with spaces between\nthem. However, Hero’s account of pneumatic effects involving the\ncompression of air—discovered by Ctesibius—seems to depend\non the deformation of elastic particles which can be compressed\nartificially but will spring back to their original shape quite\nvehemently. If so, his account denies a fundamental tenet of classical\natomism, that atoms do not change in their intrinsic properties like\nshape.","contact.mail":"sberrym@interchange.ubc.ca","contact.domain":"interchange.ubc.ca"}]
