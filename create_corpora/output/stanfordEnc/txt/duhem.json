As a physicist, he championed\n“energetics,” holding generalized thermodynamics as\nfoundational for physical theory, that is, thinking that all of\nchemistry and physics, including mechanics, electricity, and magnetism,\nshould be derivable from thermodynamic first principles. In philosophy\nof science, he is best known for his work on the relation between\ntheory and experiment, arguing that hypotheses are not\nstraightforwardly refuted by experiment and that there are no crucial\nexperiments in science. In history of science, he produced massive\ngroundbreaking work in medieval science and defended a thesis of\ncontinuity between medieval and early modern science.\n\n\n\nPierre Maurice Marie Duhem was born on June 10, 1861, in Paris, in a\nmodest neighborhood on the Rue des Jeûneurs, near the Grands\nBoulevards, just South of Montmartre. His father, Pierre-Joseph Duhem,\nwas of Flemish origin, the oldest child of a large family who lived in\nthe French northern industrial city of Roubaix, near the Belgian\nborder. After the death of his parents, Pierre-Joseph was forced to\ndiscontinue his studies with the Jesuits in order to provide for the\nfamily. He worked in the textile industry as a sales representative,\nbut never abandoned his love of learning; it is said that, late in\nlife, he was seen everywhere with the work of a Latin author under his\narm. Pierre Duhem’s mother, Marie-Alexandrine Fabre, descended on\nher mother’s side from the Hubault-Delormes, a bourgeois family\nwho had settled in Paris during the seventeenth century. Her\nfather’s family had originally come from the southern town of\nCabesprine, near Carcasonne, and it was there, in a house they still\nmaintained and to which Pierre returned most summers, that he died on\nSeptember 14, 1916. \n\nThe Duhems made sure that Pierre was well educated. Starting at the\nage of seven he was given private lessons with a small group of\nstudents, on grammar, arithmetic, Latin, and catechism. A letter he\nwrote about the siege of Chateaudun he experienced in October 1870\nattests to his being already a literate writer by the age of nine. The\nyoung Duhem was witness to some troubling times, with the\nFranco-Prussian War raging until the armistice in February 1871 and the\nParis Commune in March. The Duhems had avoided the advance of the\nPrussians against Paris but were caught up in the siege of Chateaudun;\nthey barely escaped to Bordeaux, returning to Paris after the armistice\nand just before the Paris Commune. That social experiment lasted only\ntwo months, though it set the stage for some wide-ranging\ntransformations to French culture that were to have great consequences\nwhen they were later established permanently. Among the Commune’s\ndecrees were the separation of church from state, the rendering of all\nchurch property into public property, and the exclusion of religion\nfrom schools. The Duhems did not approve of these measures and were\nparticularly chagrined by some of the extreme actions taken by the most\nradical elements of the Commune, such as the desecration of churches\nand graveyards. For the Duhems, the Commune was a paradigm of anarchy\nand irreligion. \n\nThe Fall of 1872 brought two great tragedies to the Duhem family: a\ndiphtheria epidemic killed Pierre’s younger sister Antoinette and\nhis recently born brother Jean, leaving only Pierre and\nAntoinette’s twin sister Marie. Pierre continued his education\n(as demi-pensionnaire) at a Catholic school, the\nCollège Stanislas in Paris, in 1872 and for the next ten years.\nThe mature Duhem recalled his college days as most formative. In\nparticular, he singled out his science teacher as an important\ninfluence: \n\nDuhem’s science teacher Jules Moutier went on to teach at the\nEcole Polytechnique and to publish a number of texts, including La\nthermodynamique et ses principales applications (Paris:\nGauthier-Villars, 1885). Duhem recognized in his theory of chemical\ndissociation and in his thermodynamics generally a first enunciation of\nthe chemical theories that Josiah Willard Gibbs, an important later\ninfluence on Duhem, was to develop more fully. \n\nIn 1882 Duhem enrolled at the prestigious secular institution of higher\neducation, the Ecole Normale Supérieure. When he entered the\nEcole Normale he was first in his class in the Science Section, out of\nthe approximately 30 students chosen from the best 800 or so graduates\nin France that year, and he remained first throughout his years there.\nThe curriculum at the Ecole Normale usually lasted three years; Duhem\nwas granted a fourth year and stayed on a fifth year as\nagrégé préparateur. He received a\nlicense in mathematics and another in physics at the end of\nacademic year 1883–84. In his final year, Duhem was offered a position\nin Louis Pasteur’s laboratory as a chemist-bacteriologist, though\nhe refused it because of his desire to work in theoretical physics. \n\nOne of the turning points in Duhem’s career occurred during\nacademic year 1884–85, while he was only a third-year student. Duhem\npresented a thesis in physics for his doctorate. The thesis, on\nthermodynamic potential, Le potentiel thermodynamique et ses\napplications à la mécanique chimique et à\nl’étude des phénomènes\nélectriques, was rejected by a panel composed of three\nscholars: the physicist Gabriel Lippmann and the mathematicians Charles\nHermite and Emile Picard. The panel, chaired by Lippmann, seems to have\nmade a political decision. The prestigious French scientific publisher,\nHermann, published a version of the thesis the following year. Duhem\ndefended another thesis in applied mathematics, on the theory of\nmagnetization by induction, Sur l’aimantation par\ninfluence, and received his doctorate in October 1888; this time,\nthe physicist Edmond Bouty, the mathematician Gaston Darboux, and the\nmathematician-physicist Henri Poincaré constituted the panel\nthat accepted the dissertation. It would be difficult to understand\nfully these events without delving deeply into the social, cultural,\nand intellectual context of France at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. At a time when French scientists were predominantly liberal\nand anti-clerical, Duhem was openly conservative and deeply religious;\nhe was also stubborn and often contentious. The structure of French\nacademia was surely also a factor in the affair. However, the specific\nmotives generally cited in the case were Lipmann’s\n“jealousy” and the fact that Duhem’s thesis refuted\nthe principle of maximum work: that chemical changes tend spontaneously\nto produce maximum heat. It was one of the cherished theses of Marcellin\nBerthelot, Lippmann’s friend and a significant power in the\nFrench scientific establishment. It was reported that Berthelot had\nsaid: “This young man will never teach in Paris.”\nBerthelot’s edict came true. Duhem spent his academic career in\nprovincial universities far from Paris, the center of academic life in\nFrance. His teaching positions brought him from Lille, then briefly to\nRennes, then to Bordeaux for the remainder of his life, but never to\nParis. \n\nDuhem assumed the position of Maitre de Conférences at the\nFaculté des Sciences at Lille in October 1887. There he met\nAdèle Chayet, whom he married in October 1890. Their daughter\nHélène was born in September 1891. Tragically,\nAdèle died in childbirth the following summer; the newborn child\nalso did not survive. Duhem never remarried. He left the upbringing of\nHélène to his mother who lived with him after his father\nPierre-Joseph died. The situation in Lille soured for Duhem. Never one\nto back off from a dispute, he fought with the Dean of his faculty over\na minor issue: an assistant had failed to unlock the door of\nDuhem’s laboratory for his students during their licentiate\nexaminations. The assistant complained about his mistreatment by Duhem\nto the Dean, who requested that the assistant write a letter of\napology; Duhem rejected the apology and took issue with the Dean, who\nthen brought the matter to the Rector, adding further complaints\nagainst Duhem. The minor issue having escalated to immense proportions,\nDuhem requested and received a change of positions at the end of\nacademic year 1893. During these formative years, Duhem worked very\nhard on his science. He published six books: a two-volume work on\nhydrodynamics, elasticity, and acoustics, his lectures on electricity\nand magnetism, in three volumes, and an introduction to physical\nchemistry. Duhem was one of the first to appreciate the work of W. J.\nGibbs, writing the earliest critical examination of Gibbs’\n“On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances” in 1887\nand later promoting the French translation of Gibbs’ works (Duhem\n1907). \nIn October 1893, Duhem left Lille for Rennes. He lasted only one year,\nleaving for Bordeaux in October 1894. He was hoping for a position in\nParis. The prodigious quantity and quality of his publications in many\nfields of science, the philosophy of science, and the history of\nscience were not able to change his situation. Very late in life, he\nwas approached about the newly created chair in the History of Science\nat the Collège de France, but he refused to be a candidate for\nit. The proud and stubborn Duhem told his daughter: “I am a\ntheoretical physicist. Either I will teach theoretical physics at Paris\nor else I will not go there.” \n\nDuhem’s curriculum vitae, written in 1913, on the occasion of his\nnomination as non-resident member of the Académie des Sciences\n(1917, 41–70), lists over 350 items, about 50 of which were books. From\nthe mid-1880s to 1900, Duhem’s primary interests were scientific,\nranging from thermodynamics and physics, but publishing on elasticity\nand energetics as late as 1911. In the 1890s, while still at Lille, he\nbegan writing essays on questions of methodology that would lead to the\npublication of his most influential books in the philosophy of science,\ntranslated into English as The Aim and Structure of Physical\nTheory and To Save the Phenomena. It was also in the\nmid-1890s that Duhem published his first essays in the history of\nscience, starting on the path that would lead him in 1904 to a new\nunderstanding of the history of science and to his thesis of continuity\nbetween medieval and early modern science. This path would culminate in\nsuch important historical works as Études sur Léonard\nde Vinci and Le système du monde. \n\nDuhem made a number of enduring contributions to thermodynamics and\nphysical chemistry. Among these were the Duhem–Margules and\nGibbs–Duhem equations, which deal with reversible processes in\nthermodynamics as quasi-static limiting processes and give a general\nproof of the Gibbs phase rule. These results were obtained in the\ncontext of a program of generalized thermodynamics called\n“energetics.” Indeed, Duhem’s entire scientific\nprogram was driven by the conviction that a generalized thermodynamics\nshould be foundational for physical theory, thinking that all of\nchemistry and physics, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism,\nshould be derivable from thermodynamic first principles. Duhem started\nfrom the concept of the thermodynamic potential (the topic of his\nfailed thesis), deploying it in a manner similar to that of potentials\nin mechanics, so as to represent all physical and chemical changes. The\nprogram finds its mature statement in his Traité\nd’énergétique of 1911; it was well received by\nlate-nineteenth-century energeticists, such as Wilhelm Ostwald and\nGeorg Helm. So important was energetics for Duhem, that his work in the\nhistory and philosophy of science has been viewed as an attempt to\ndefend its aims and methods (see Lowinger 1941). More recently, Niall\nMartin and others have argued for the importance of religious motives\nin Duhem’s work (see Martin 1991, Jaki 1991) and it has become\nclear in the course of Duhem’s writings that he expected the\nendpoint of science to harmonize with the teachings of the Catholic\nChurch. \n\nWhatever was Duhem’s initial motivation, his historical and\nphilosophical work took on a life of its own. One cannot read\nDuhem’s numerous historical and philosophical tomes and think\nthat his labor was only in the service of energetics and that the sole\ngoal of his works was but a defense of its methods and its historical\nposition. No doubt energetics might be a thread running through\nDuhem’s various works, and no doubt these works harmonize with\nthe method of energetics as he conceives it, but energetics cannot be\nthe whole story. \n\nDuhem’s early methodological views reflected late\nnineteenth-century positivism: Physical theory was no more than an aid\nto memory, summarizing and classifying facts by providing a symbolic\nrepresentation of them; the facts of physical theory are different from\ncommon sense and metaphysics, especially from the mechanical theories\nfashionable at the time. Duhem’s position was immediately\nattacked by a Catholic engineer, Eugène Vicaire, on the grounds\nthat separating physics from metaphysics implied that physics was the\nonly real knowledge (another positivistic thesis), and thus conceded\ntoo much to skepticism. Vicaire raised an important point for\nturn-of-the-century Catholics because the Church was officially\ncommitted to neo-Thomism, with its generally rationalist apologetics\n(see Martin 1991, chap. 2). In his reply Duhem adopted a quasi-Thomist\nposition: metaphysics is a real form of knowledge, more excellent than\nphysics, but separated from it in that it has different objects and is\ngoverned by different methods. This immediate response fitted\nreasonably well into the framework of neo-Thomism, though it did not go\nas far as to reunite the disparate forms of knowledge into a\nhierarchical system of sciences including cosmology and metaphysics.\nDuhem’s mature position was somewhat different, containing three\nkey ideas elaborated upon on various occasions: (1) the\nunderdetermination of theory by fact, often referred to as the Duhem\nThesis, (2) the rejection of metaphysics and models in physics, and (3)\nnatural classification as the endpoint of physical theory. \n\nDuhem’s work was important for members of the Vienna Circle,\nincluding Otto Neurath and Philipp Frank, as it had been for Ernst\nMach. Despite Duhem’s conservative beliefs, his work was also\ntaken up by participants in the Viennese political scene, such as\nFriedrich Adler, who had translated La théorie\nphysique into German in 1908. The Duhem thesis surfaced fully in\nAnglo-American philosophy in the 1950s through the work of W. V. O.\nQuine. In Quine’s “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” the\nsecond dogma is reductionism, the belief that “each meaningful\nstatement is equivalent to some construct upon terms which refer to\nimmediate experience” (1953, 20). Quine argues that reductionism\nis an ill-founded dogma. He asserts that although reductionism has\nceased to figure in some empiricists’ thoughts, there remains a\nmore subtle form of reductionism that each statement taken in isolation\ncan admit confirmation or disconfirmation. Against this dogma Quine\nsuggests that “our statements about the external world face the\ntribunal of sense experience not individually, but only as a corporate\nbody” (1953, 41), and, in a footnote of the reprinted article in\nhis collected essays, From a Logical Point of View, says that\nthe doctrine was well argued by Pierre Duhem. Quine proceeds to detail\nan “empiricism without the dogmas” in which knowledge is to\nbe likened to a field of force where “a conflict with experience\nat the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the\nfield” (1953, 42), and “any statement can be held true come\nwhat may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the\nsystem” (1953, 43). Because of Quine’s reference to Duhem,\nthe thesis formed from the two sub-theses, that (i) since empirical\nstatements are interconnected, they cannot be singly disconfirmed, and\n(ii), if we wish to hold a particular statement true we can always\nadjust another statement, has become known as the Duhem-Quine thesis.\nQuine attributes only sub-thesis (i) to Duhem; Duhem would have\nrecognized sub-thesis (i) as an offspring of his, but would not have\nfully agreed with it as formulated by Quine. \n\nDuhem does not claim that when there is some conflict with\nexperience, we can always make enough adjustments elsewhere in the\nsystem. He makes a weaker claim, also limited in other ways, but which\nwould be equivalent to: when there is some conflict with experience\nwhat is disconfirmed is necessarily ambiguous. Duhem’s\nformulation of his non-falsifiability thesis is that “if the\npredicted phenomenon is not produced, not only is the questioned\nproposition put into doubt, but also the whole theoretical scaffolding\nused by the physicist” (1914, 281; 1954, 185). He does not take\nthe second Quinean step of holding any statement true come what may,\nbut says “the only thing the experiment teaches us is that, among\nall the propositions used to predict the phenomenon and to verify that\nit has not been produced, there is at least one error; but where the\nerror lies is just what the experiment does not tell us” (1914,\n281; 1954, 185). He refers to two possible ways of proceeding when an\nexperiment contradicts the consequences of a theory: a timid scientist\nmight wish to safeguard certain fundamental hypotheses and attempt to\ncomplicate matters by invoking various cases of error and multiplying\nthe corrections, while a bolder scientist can resolve to change some of\nthe essential suppositions supporting the entire system (1914, 329;\n1954, 216–17). The scientist has no guarantee of success: “If\nthey both succeed in satisfying the requirements of the experiment,\neach is logically permitted to declare himself content with\nthe work he has accomplished” (1914, 330; 1954, 217). \n\nMoreover, Duhem does not argue directly for the non-falsifiability\nthesis. He seems to regard it as an obvious corollary of another\nthesis, which could be called the non-separability thesis, that the\nphysicist can never submit an isolated hypothesis to experimental test:\n“To seek to separate each of the hypotheses of theoretical\nphysics from the other assumptions upon which this science rests, in\norder to subject it in isolation to the control of observation, is to\npursue a chimera” (1914, 303; 1954, 199–200). \n\nThe Duhemian thesis usually makes its appearance in the context of\nDuhem’s critique of the inductive method (or what he calls the\nNewtonian method), which rejects any hypothesis about imperceptible\nbodies and hidden movements and admits only general laws known by\ninduction from observation. Duhem accuses this method of being\nunmanageable; he asserts that a science can only follow the Newtonian\nmethod when its means of knowing are those of common sense: “When\nscience no longer observes facts directly but substitutes for them\nmeasurements, given by instruments, of magnitudes that mathematical\ntheory alone defines, induction can no longer be practiced in the\nmanner that the Newtonian method requires,” (1917, 153; 1996,\n234). He clearly indicates that some sciences can use the Newtonian\nmethod, derive their principles by induction from observation and\ndisconfirm them as tests warrant. What Duhem thinks is wrong with\ninductivism is that it cannot be used by all sciences. For Duhem the\nnon-falsifiability thesis is a consequence of the non-separability thesis, and\nthe non-separability thesis is an empirical thesis depending upon factors\nthat do not govern all sciences. This is supported as well by\nDuhem’s assertions, in La théorie physique, that\nhe is imposing narrow limits on his inquiry, and is restricting his\ngeneralizations to physics; when he first announces the non-separability\nthesis, he announces it as a principle about what physicists do, whose\nconsequences will be developed in the remainder of the\nbook. \n\nIt is not generally known that Duhem in his lifetime confronted an\nextension of his thesis in the fashion of Quine and had previously\nrejected it. In the 1913 essay entitled “Examen logique de la\nthéorie physique,” republished as part II of the overview\nof all his work, Duhem sketched the set of theses constituting the\nDuhem thesis and stated: \n\nThus, already by 1913, the scope of Duhem’s thesis had been\nstretched beyond Duhem’s intentions. “The several authors\nwe have just cited often draw from this analysis of the experimental\nmethod used in physics conclusions which go beyond the boundaries of\nphysics; we shall not follow them that far, but shall stay always\nwithin the limits of physical science” (1914, 218n; 1954, 144n).\nWhile Duhem did not identify these authors, these\n“pragmatists,” as early as 1905, in a footnote of La\nthéorie physique, he asserts that some of his friends and\nacquaintances and, in particular, Gaston Milhaud, Edouard Le Roy, and\nJoseph Wilbois had adopted his analysis of experimental method, as\ndiscussed in his earlier articles (1914, 217–218n; 1954, 144n). And\nthese same thinkers, together with Duhem’s very good friend,\nMaurice Blondel, were referred to favorably as “French\npragmatists” by William James in 1907 in his Lectures on\nPragmatism: “If my lectures interest any reader in the\ngeneral subject, he will doubtless wish to read farther. I therefore\ngive him a few references. … Furthermore, see J. Milhaud, Le\nRationnel, 1898, and the fine articles by Le Roy in the Revue\nde Metaphysique, vols. 7, 8, and 9. Also articles by Blondel and\nde Sailly in the Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne,\n4eme Série, vols. 2 and 3. Papini announces a book on\nPragmatism, in the French language, to be published very soon”\n(James, 1981, 3; a quick glance at Milhaud’s Le\nRationnel reveals numerous references to Duhem). Thus the Duhem\nthesis in its extended form was favorably received in the Anglophone\nworld during the first few decades of the twentieth century, well\nbefore Quine’s reference to it. Duhem’s reaction to the\nextension of his thesis was as follows: \n\nIn the overview of all his scholarly works in the document\nsupporting his candidacy for membership to the Académie des\nSciences Duhem contrasted the methodology of energetics with the two\nleading methodologies at the time, what he called the method of the\nCartesians and that of the Newtonians. We have discussed his critique\nof the Newtonians; we now turn to that of the Cartesians. The salient\nfeature of energetics was that “the principles it embodies and\nfrom which it derives conclusions do not at all aspire to resolve the\nbodies we perceive or the motions we report into imperceptible bodies\nor hidden motions” (1917, 151; 1996, 232). What energetics\noffered was a formal theory, with the character of logical system,\nwhich instead of reducing physical qualities in the manner of\nmechanistic theories, limited itself to marking by means of a numerical\nscale the various intensities of such qualities. Duhem’s critique\nof mechanistic theories (or the method of Cartesians and atomists) was\nthat they are not autonomous: \n\nFor Duhem, the contemporary scientist who exemplified the method of\nthe “Cartesians” was James Clerk Maxwell. Duhem issued\nthree interconnected complaints against Maxwell’s work: (i)\nMaxwell’s theory is overly bold or not systematic enough; (ii) it\nis too dependent on models; and (iii) its concepts are not continuous\nwith those of the past. \n\nThe justification Duhem gives for the accusation of extreme boldness is\nthat: \n\nAccording to Duhem, the founders of electrodynamics—Coulomb,\nPoisson, and Ampere—followed these principles, but Maxwell did\nnot. Duhem cites with approbation Ampere’s attempt to represent\nthe attraction or repulsion of currents in wires using Coulomb’s\nformula. He also praises the fact that Ampere abandoned the attempt\nonly after experimental facts about the magneto-optical rotation,\ndiscovered by Faraday, showed clearly that Ampere could not succeed in\nthe attempt. But, again, according to Duhem, Maxwell does not follow\nthese principles. In fact, he goes so far as to accuse Maxwell of\nfollowing the “inverse path”: \n\nAs a result, Maxwell reversed “with an incredible\nrashness” the natural order according to which physical theory\nevolves—he broke with the past before he needed to. \n\nDuhem is well known for his attack on the use of models in physical\nscience. At first, it seems that Duhem tries to link his attack on\nmodel building with his espousal of instrumentalism for the physical\nsciences. He accuses the English scientists of believing that “to\nunderstand physical phenomena is to compose a model” (1914, 103;\n1954, 71–72) and of “confusing model with theory” (1913,\n102; 1954, 71). He specifically blames Maxwell of these\nmisunderstandings, indicating that in his 1855–56 essay Maxwell\nproposed only “to illustrate” the theory of dielectrics,\nwhereas in his 1861–62 essay he proposed “to represent or to\nexplain” the electrical and magnetic actions by a mechanical\nmodel. Duhem even seems scornful of Maxwell’s interchangeable use\nof the verbs “to represent” and “to explain.”\nHe states, “for an English physicist, the two words have the same\nmeaning” (1902, 9). \n\nFor Duhem there is a crucial difference between representing and\nexplaining. He divides theories into two large categories, explanatory\nand purely representative theories, and argues that physical theories\nshould not be considered as explanatory, but as purely representative\nor classificatory. The argument, as we have seen, is that, in order for\nphysical theory to be explanatory, it would have to be subordinate to\nmetaphysics and not autonomous. The reference to the two words having\nthe same meaning for Maxwell and English scientists is thus a reference\nto what Duhem would consider a confusion about the aim of physical\ntheory, one that arises in the identification of the model with the\ntheory, in thinking that what is represented by the theory and/or model\nis real. \n\nBut Duhem broadens the critique of model building to include\nmathematical models along with mechanical models. He decides that, for\nan English scientist, theory is “for him neither an explanation\nnor a rational classification of physical laws, but a model of these\nlaws, a model not built for the satisfying of reason but for the\npleasure of the imagination” (1914, 117; 1954, 81). The complaint\nis clear: model building has no real place in physical theory (beyond a\nminor heuristic role); it can neither be grounded in realism, in the\nthought that physical theories are explanatory structures, nor in\ninstrumentalism, in the thought that physical theories are\nclassificatory or representative structures. In fact, model building is\nnot even connected to the higher intellectual faculty of reason but to\nthe lower faculty of imagination. So, ultimately, Duhem’s attack\non model building is rooted in something more fundamental than his\ninstrumentalist methodology for the physical sciences. \n\nDuhem banishes model building from physical theory (as he previously\nbanished Maxwell’s rashness) because model building breaks with\nhistorical continuity; in fact, model building is not only historically\nnon-continuous, but present models are even often\n“non-continuous” among themselves. Some model builders even\nfind pleasure in building two or more models of the same law. The fact\nthat the English physicist can accept disparate models, breaking up the\nhistorical continuity of science and even its present unification, is\nwhat shocks Duhem; it is what reconfirms for him that English physics\nis not the work of reason, but the work of imagination. \n\nA principle of historical continuity is invoked in the conclusion of\nDuhem’s primary work on Maxwell. Duhem evaluates there an\ninterpretation of Maxwell’s work he attributes to Heaviside,\nHertz, and Cohn, among others. He quotes Hertz as stating that:\n“what is essential in Maxwell’s theories is Maxwell’s\nequations.” He takes this to be Hertz’s way of salvaging\nwhat is valuable in Maxwell from the midst of logical errors and\nincoherence, which are not only difficult to correct, but which have\nfrustrated many illustrious mathematicians. But Duhem cannot accept\nHertz’s implied criterion of identity for physical theories. He\nasserts that he might accept such a criterion for algebra but “a\nphysicist is not an algebraist”: \n\nDuhem proceeds to detail two complete theories that can recover\nMaxwell’s equations within a logical and coherent structure, the\ntheories of Boltzmann and Helmholtz. The only criterion he gives for\nchoosing between these two theories, though without elaborating upon it\nor justifying it, is that Helmholtz’s theory is to be preferred\nover Boltzmann’s theory because it is a natural “extension\nof the doctrines of Poisson, Ampere, Weber, and Newmann; it leads\nlogically from the principles posited at the start of the nineteenth\ncentury to the most seductive consequences of Maxwell’s theories,\nfrom the laws of Coulomb to the electromagnetic theory of light; [it\ndoes so] without losing any of the recent victories of electrical\nscience; it reestablishes the continuity of tradition” (1902,\n225). \n\nDuhem does not attempt to justify his criterion of historical\ncontinuity in his study of Maxwell, perhaps because he previously\nbroached the question. In an early methodological article, he asserts: Thus historical continuity as a consideration falls outside of pure\nlogic and outside reasons of physics proper, but deals with the\nrelation between physics and metaphysics, what Duhem calls\n“metaphysical cosmology.” Surprisingly, if one considers\nhim as an instrumentalist, for Duhem, we must judge a physical theory\nin comparison to an ideal and perfect theory that provides the total\nand adequate metaphysical explanation of the nature of material\nthings, that is, the natural classification of laws. For that reason,\na coherent physical theory is more perfect than an incoherent set of\nincompatible theories. Elaborating upon this point and commenting upon\nthe connection between cosmology—that is, metaphysics, natural\nclassification, or the ideal form of physical theory—and\nphysical theory itself, Duhem asserts: \n\nDuhem supports this statement using an analogy with the trajectory\nof a ball. We cannot guess its end point with an instant glance at the\nball, but we can prolong its trajectory if we followed the ball from\nthe moment it was struck. So we cannot guess the end point of physical\ntheory, the natural classification, by looking at any particular\ntheory. We must appeal to the trajectory of physical theory, to its\nhistory, to enable us to tell whether any particular theory is likely\nto contribute toward the ultimate natural classification. Duhem’s\ndoctrine of natural classification provides the grounds for various\ncommentators to argue that Duhem is not an instrumentalist, that his\nphilosophy of science considered as a whole looks more like convergent\nor motivational realism (see Maiocchi in Ariew and Barker 1990 and\nothers). \n\nAs presented so far, Duhem is a philosopher who weaves together two\nlarge patchworks of theses: (i) instrumentalism or fictionalism,\nanti-atomism or anti-Cartesianism, anti-modelism, and autonomy of\nphysics from metaphysics and (ii) anti-inductivism or critique of\nNewtonian method, the Duhem thesis, that is, non-falsifiability and\nnon-separability. Both sets of theses are intended as empirical theses\nabout the workings of science and both are important to understanding\nDuhem’s thought. The first set of theses effectively demarcates\nphysical theory as an autonomous domain apart from other domains, that\nis, rejects any external method, and the second set then operates on\nthe internal workings of physical theory. Having set apart physical\ntheory, Duhem asserts that no internal method leads inexorably to the\ntruth. \n\nFor Duhem, there are always at least two basic ways of proceeding in\nscience. Some scientists prefer the clutter of concrete details and\nthus do not mind ad hoc explanations, complications, and corrected\ntheories; others prefer abstract, simple, and uncomplicated theories,\neven if they are gotten at the price of conceptual novelty. As we have\nseen, Duhem discusses this dichotomy under the rubric of the English\nmind and the French mind—what he also calls “esprit de\nfinesse” and “esprit de géométrie,”\nfollowing Blaise Pascal. Despite the labels “English” and\n“French,” Duhem’s categories are analytic ones, not\nmere epithets to be used rhetorically against his adversaries. In fact,\nfrom the start, when he described the broad-shallow English mind, his\narchetype was Napoleon Bonaparte, a great genius of military\ndetails—not an Englishman. Duhem’s ideal of the narrow-deep\nFrench mind was Newton, the geometer of physics—not a Frenchman.\nThus, when Duhem accused Faraday and Maxwell of having English minds,\nhe did so by trying to establish something about how they conducted\ntheir science, not by referring to their ancestry. \n\nIn his last work, La science allemande, mostly a work of\nwartime propaganda, Duhem added a third kind of mind to his original\ntwo, namely, the German mind. If there are two basic types, the French\nmind and the English mind, then what could the German mind possibly be?\nCiting Pascal, Duhem tells us that truth requires both reason and\nargument—raison and raisonnement. Logic, or our\nability to link propositions with one another, allows us to deduce one\ntruth from another; but that ability, by itself, merely gets us back to\nfirst principles or axioms. We also need a faculty that allows us to\nintuit the truth of the first principles or axioms, that is, bon\nsens (good sense). Bon sens is to “esprit de\nfinesse” what “pure logic” is to “esprit de\ngéométrie.” Moreover, bon sens, our\nfaculty of recognizing fundamental truth gets perfected by the practice\nof history, by our becoming more aware of the failures and successes of\nprevious theories, by thinking about the trajectory of scientific\ntheories, rather than by considering a single theory frozen in time.\nThe dual scheme can now be expanded. We need logic, the ability to\nsystematize, but we also need intuition, the recognition of truth. When\none of these is allowed to dominate, we get a science which is all\nintuition, all “esprit de finesse,” but no logical\ncoherence, namely, English science; or we get a science which is all\nlogic, lacking bon sens, namely, German science. German science then is\na degenerate kind of French science, the latter being predominantly\n“esprit de géométrie,” corrected by bon\nsens. \n\nAs a result, we can talk about a continuum of sciences; at one extreme\non the theoretical side is German science, or logicism, and at the\nother extreme on the experimental side is English science, or crude\nmodelism. In the middle is French science, which allegedly tempers the\nlogical bent with historicism. \n\nIn a well-known chapter of Social Theory and Social Structure,\nthe sociologist of science Robert Merton refers to Duhem’s\ncritique of German science as one of the many polemics against national\nkinds affirming a universalistic standard: “Dispassionate\nscientists impugned ‘enemy’ contributions, charging\nnationalistic bias, log-rolling, intellectual dishonesty, incompetence,\nand lack of creative capacity. Yet this very deviation from the norm of\nuniversalism actually presupposed the legitimacy of the norm. For\nnationalistic bias is opprobrious only if judged in terms of the\nstandard of universalism… Thus by the very process of condemning\ntheir violation, the mores are reaffirmed” (1968, 8). \n\nAt first glance Duhem’s polemics against German science might\nseem to arise from a universalistic standard. Duhem does talk at times\nof a perfect form of science, one without personal or national\ncharacter: “Quite often the great masters possess a reason in\nwhich all the faculties are so harmoniously proportioned that their\nvery perfect doctrines are exempt from all individual character, as\nfrom all national character. … In such works one no longer sees\nthe genius of this or that people, but only the genius of\nHumanity” (1915, 105; 1996, 253). Such perfection for Duhem is an\nequilibrium of disparate elements, not itself a single ideal type.\nDuhem might regret what he sees as an overabundance of esprit de\ngéométrie in German science, and might wish that it be\ntempered by a bit more finesse, but there is no suggestion in Duhem\nthat there is only one way to proceed in science. \n\nDuhem specifically states that the \n\nAt bottom, despite his talk of ideal type and equilibrium,\nDuhem’s science is not universalistic. The strength of his\nanalysis is that there is no single direction within science that each\nindividual must follow. For that, one would need to ground physics in a\nparticular metaphysics—which Duhem explicitly rejects with his\ninstrumentalism—or rather, to be guided by what one projects\nmetaphysics will look like over the long run. Unfortunately, Duhem took\nthis last thought too rigidly and ultimately condemned all innovations\nas breaking with the past, either due to an excess of esprit de\ngéométrie, as with non-Euclidean geometry and\nrelativity, or an excess of esprit de finesse, as with\nelectron theory. But his philosophy of science itself contained the\nseeds of scientific pluralism, which are the foundations of the Duhem\nthesis, that is, the thought that there are many legitimate and\ndisparate ways of proceeding in science. \n\nDuhem’s famous critique of crucial experiments follows a similar\npattern. Duhem argues that crucial experiments resemble false dilemmas:\nhypotheses in physics do not come in pairs, so that crucial experiments\ncannot transform one of the two into a demonstrated truth. For example,\nthe Newtonian emission theory predicts that light travels faster in\nwater than in air; according to the wave theory, light travels slower\nin water than in air. Dominique François Arago proposed a\ncrucial experiment comparing the respective velocities. Léon\nFoucault then devised an apparatus to measure the speed of light in\nvarious media and found a lower velocity in water than in air. Arago\nand Foucault concluded for the wave theory, thinking that the\nexperiment refuted the emission theory. Discussing Foucault’s\nexperiment, Duhem asks whether we dare assert that no other hypothesis\nis imaginable and suggests that instead of light being either a simple\nparticle or wave, it might be something else, perhaps a disturbance\npropagated within a dielectric medium, as theorized by Maxwell (1914,\n285–89; 1954, 188–90). \n\nFor most of the nineteenth century, scholars treated “medieval\nscience” as an oxymoron. Since nothing from the Middle Ages was\nworthy of the name “science,” no history of medieval\nscience could be written. For example, William Whewell referred to\nGreek philosophy as “the period of the first waking of\nscience” and to the medieval era as “that of its mid-day\nslumber” (1857, I, Introduction). As a result, Whewell’s\nchapter on medieval science from the History of the Inductive\nSciences, entitled “Of the Mysticism of the Middle\nAges,” was just two-pages long. \n\nWith work such as Whewell’s being typical of Duhem’s\nintellectual context, when Duhem wrote L’évolution de\nla mécanique, in 1903, he dismissed the Middle Ages as\nscientifically sterile. Similarly, Duhem’s history of chemical\ncombination, Le mixte et la combinaison chimique, published in\nbook-form in 1902, had jumped from Aristotle’s concept of\nmixtio to modern concepts. It was only in 1904, while writing\nLes origines de la statique that Duhem came across an unusual\nreference to a then-unknown medieval thinker, Jordanus de Nemore. His\npursuit of this reference, and the research to which it led, is widely\nacknowledged to have created the field of the history of medieval\nscience. Where Duhem’s previous histories had been silent,\nLes origines de la statique contained a number of chapters on\nmedieval science: one treated Jordanus de Nemore; another treated his\nfollowers; a third argued their influence on Leonardo de Vinci. In the\nsecond volume, Duhem greatly extended his historical scope. As\nexpected, he covered seventeenth-century statics, but he also returned\nto the middle ages, spending four chapters on geostatics, including the\nwork of Albert of Saxony in the fourteenth century. Les origines de\nla statique is thus a transition from Duhem’s early\nconventional histories to the later work for which he is best known,\nEtudes sur Léonard de Vinci, and Le Système\ndu monde, in which his thesis of the continuity of late medieval\nand early modern science is fully displayed. \n\nFrom 1906 to 1913, Duhem delved deeply into his favorite guide for the\nrecovery of the past, the scientific notebooks of Leonardo de Vinci. He\npublished a series of essays uncovering de Vinci’s medieval\nsources and their influences on the moderns. The third volume of\nDuhem’s Etudes sur Léonard de Vinci gained a new\nsubtitle, Les précurseurs parisiens de Galilée,\nannouncing Duhem’s bold new thesis that even the works of Galileo\nhad a medieval heritage; reviewing his historical accomplishments,\nDuhem summarized them as follows: \n\nDuhem presented Galilean dynamics as a continuous development out of\nmedieval dynamics. He recovered the late medieval theory of impetus,\ntracing it from John Philoponus’ criticism of Aristotle to its\nmature statements in the fourteenth century works of John Buridan and\nNicole Oresme: “The role that impetus played in Buridan’s\ndynamics is exactly the one that Galileo attributed to impeto\nor momento, Descartes to ‘quantity of motion,’ and\nLeibniz finally to vis viva. So exact is this\ncorrespondence that, in order to exhibit Galileo’s dynamics,\nTorricelli, in his Lezioni accademiche, often took up\nBuridan’s reasons and almost his exact words” (1917, 163–62;\n1996, 194). Duhem then sketched the extension of impetus theory from\nterrestrial dynamics to the motions of the heavens and earth: \n\nDuhem’s essays on Leonardo de Vinci concluded with a\nspeculation about the means for the transmission of medieval ideas to\nmodern science. Since the studies of Buridan and Oresme had remained in\nlarge part in manuscript, Duhem suggested that Albert of Saxony, whose\nworks were printed and reprinted during the sixteenth century, was the\nlikely link to Galileo. Duhem’s key to understanding the\ntransmission of medieval science was Galileo’s use of the phrase\nDoctores Parisienses, a conventional label denoting Buridan\nand Oresme, among others. Based on evidence including references to\ncertain unusual doctrines and the particular order in which the\nquestions were arranged, Duhem conjectured that Galileo had consulted\nGeorge Lokert’s compilation of Albert of Saxony, Themo Judaeus,\nand others, and the works of the Dominican Domingo de Soto (1906–13,\nIII.582–83). Duhem’s conjecture has been revised and expanded\nupon: The means of transmission has been made clearer because of the\nlabor of A. C. Crombie, Adriano Carugo, and William Wallace. \n\nIn the three years before his death in 1916, Duhem wrote Le\nSystème du monde, but did not succeed in finishing it. He\nintended it as a twelve-volume work on the history of cosmological\ndoctrines, ending with Copernicus. He completed nine volumes, the first\nfive being published from 1914 to 1919, and the next four having to\nwait until the 1950s; a tenth, incomplete volume was also published\nthen. These tomes impart an enormous amount of information about\nmedieval astronomy, astrology, tidal theory, and geostatics, again\npresenting many sources for the first time in the modern era. They also\ntrace developments in doctrines associated with such concepts as\ninfinity, place, time, void, and the plurality or unity of the world.\nDuhem intended to write a 300-page summary of his results after he was\ndone with the Le Système du monde; he did not have the\ntime to accomplish what would have surely been an amazing volume. \n\nUnlike his philosophical work, Duhem’s influential contemporaries\ndid not receive his historical work with sympathy. As early as 1916,\nAntonio Favaro, the editor of Le Opere di Galileo Galilei,\nrejected the continuity of medieval and early modern science. The next\ngeneration of historians of science, Alexandre Koyré for\nexample, acknowledged Duhem’s studies as the foundation for\nmodern studies of medieval science, but subjected them to harsh\ncriticism. Two themes divide Koyré’s historical work from\nthat of Duhem. It presents histories of science in which metaphysics\nplays a primary role in explaining scientific change and it espouses a\nhistoriography that gives a central place to the concept of revolution.\nMedieval thought and early modern science are judged to be different in\nkind as well as in content. \n\nAt the beginning of an essay on void and infinite space, Koyré\nquotes a passage from Duhem that has become infamous: “If we were\nobliged to assign a date to the birth of modern science, we would\nundoubtedly choose 1277, when the Bishop of Paris solemnly proclaimed\nthat a multiplicity of worlds could exist, and that the system of\ncelestial spheres could, without contradiction, be endowed with\nstraight line motion” (1906–13, II.411; see also 1913–59, VII.\n4). Koyré calls the two theses from the condemnations of 1277\n“absurdities,” noting that they arise in a theological\ncontext, and rejects Duhem’s date for the birth of modern\nscience; he remarks that Duhem gives another date elsewhere,\ncorresponding to Buridan’s impetus theory being extended to the\nheavens, but dismisses it also, saying that “it is as false as\nthe first date” (1961, 37n). For Koyré, the introduction\nof Platonic metaphysics, the mathematization of nature, marks a break\nwith the Aristotelian Middle Ages. \n\nKoyré’s work influenced Thomas Kuhn and others who made\n“scientific revolutions” a central feature of their\nhistorical accounts. Still, the work of Kuhn and later historically\noriented philosophers and sociologists of science did attempt to\nreintegrate the philosophical and historical studies that Duhem pursued\ntogether but that were separated for a good part of the twentieth\ncentury.","contact.mail":"rariew@usf.edu","contact.domain":"usf.edu"}]
