A master stylist in any genre,\nhis major philosophical works—A Treatise of Human\nNature (1739–1740), the Enquiries concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748) and concerning the Principles of\nMorals (1751), as well as his posthumously published\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779)—remain\nwidely and deeply influential.\n\n\nAlthough Hume’s more conservative contemporaries denounced his\nwritings as works of scepticism and atheism, his influence is evident\nin the moral philosophy and economic writings of his close friend Adam\nSmith. Kant reported that Hume’s work woke him from his\n“dogmatic slumbers”  and\nJeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume “caused the scales to\nfall” from his eyes. \n\nCharles Darwin regarded his work as a\ncentral influence on the theory of evolution. The diverse directions\nin which these writers took what they gleaned from reading him reflect\nboth the richness of their sources and the wide range of his\nempiricism. Today, philosophers recognize Hume as a thoroughgoing\nexponent of philosophical naturalism, as a precursor of contemporary\ncognitive science, and as the inspiration for several of the most\nsignificant types of ethical theory developed in contemporary moral\nphilosophy.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Hume spent his childhood at Ninewells, his\nfamily’s modest estate in the border lowlands. He came from a\n“good family” (MOL 2)—socially well connected but\nnot wealthy. His father died just after David’s second birthday,\nleaving him and his elder brother and sister in \nthe care of our Mother, a woman of singular Merit, who, though young\nand handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of\nher Children. (MOL 3)  \nKatherine Falconer Hume realized that David was uncommonly precocious,\nso when his older brother went up to Edinburgh University, Hume went\nwith him, although he was only 10 or 11. There he studied Latin and\nGreek, read widely in history and literature, ancient and modern\nphilosophy, and also did some mathematics and natural\nphilosophy—what we now call natural science. \nThe education David received, both at home and at the university,\naimed at training pupils to a life of virtue regulated by stern\nScottish Calvinist strictures. Prayers and sermons were prominent\naspects of his home and university life. At some point, Hume read\nThe Whole Duty of Man, a widely circulated Anglican\ndevotional tract that details our duties to God, our fellow human\nbeings, and ourselves. \nHume’s family thought him suited for a legal career, but he\nfound the law “nauseous”, preferring to read classical\ntexts, especially Cicero. He decided to become a “Scholar and\nPhilosopher”, and followed a rigorous program of reading and\nreflection for three years until “there seem’d to be\nopen’d up to me a new Scene of Thought” (HL 3.2). The\nintensity of developing his philosophical vision precipitated a\npsychological crisis in the isolated scholar.  \nThe crisis eventually passed, and Hume remained intent on articulating\nhis “new Scene of Thought”. As a second son, his\ninheritance was meager, so he moved to France, where he could live\ncheaply, and finally settled in La Flèche, a sleepy village in\nAnjou best known for its Jesuit college where Descartes and Mersenne\nhad studied a century before. Here he read French and other\ncontinental authors, especially Malebranche, Dubos, and Bayle, and\noccasionally baited the Jesuits with arguments attacking their\nbeliefs. By this time, Hume had not only rejected the religious\nbeliefs with which he was raised, but was also opposed to organized\nreligion in general, an opposition that remained constant throughout\nhis life. In 1734, when he was only 23, he began writing A\nTreatise of Human Nature. \nHume returned to England in 1737 to ready the Treatise for\nthe press. To curry favor with Joseph Butler (1692–1752), he\n“castrated” his manuscript, deleting his controversial\ndiscussion of miracles, along with other “nobler parts”\n(HL 6.2). Book I, “Of the Understanding”, and Book II,\n“Of the Passions”, appeared anonymously in 1739. The next\nyear saw the publication of Book III, “Of Morals”, as well\nas his anonymous “Abstract” of Books I and II. \nThe Treatise was no literary sensation, but it didn’t\nfall “deadborn from the press” (MOL 6), as Hume\ndisappointedly described its reception. Despite his surgical\ndeletions, it attracted enough of “a Murmour among the\nZealots” (MOL 6) to fuel his lifelong reputation as an atheist\nand a sceptic. When he applied for the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatical\n(“Mental”) Philosophy at Edinburgh in 1745, his reputation\nprovoked vocal and ultimately successful opposition. Six years later,\nhe stood for the Chair of Logic at Glasgow, only to be turned down\nagain. Hume never held an academic post. \nIn 1745, he accepted a position as a young nobleman’s tutor,\nonly to discover that his charge was insane. A year later he became\nsecretary to his cousin, Lieutenant General James St Clair, eventually\naccompanying him on an extended diplomatic mission in Austria and\nItaly.  \nIn 1748, An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding appeared,\ncovering the central ideas of Book I of the Treatise and his\ndiscussion of liberty and necessity from Book II. He also included\nmaterial he had excised from the Treatise. In 1751, he\npublished An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, a\n“recasting” of Book III of the Treatise, which he\ndescribed as “incomparably the best” of all his work (MOL\n10). More essays, the Political Discourses, appeared in 1752,\nand Hume’s correspondence reveals that a draft of the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion was also underway at\nthis time. \nAn offer to serve as Librarian to the Edinburgh Faculty of Advocates\ngave Hume the opportunity to begin another project, a History of\nEngland, using the law library’s excellent resources.\nPublished in six volumes between 1754 and 1762, his History\nwas a bestseller well into the next century, giving him the financial\nindependence he had long sought. But even as a librarian, Hume’s\nreputation as an atheist and sceptic dogged him. One of his orders for\n“indecent Books” prompted an unsuccessful move for his\ndismissal and excommunication from the Kirk. Friends and publishers\npersuaded him to suppress some of his more controversial writings on\nreligion during his lifetime. \nIn 1763, Hume accepted a position as private secretary to the British\nAmbassador to France. During his three-year stay in Paris, he became\nSecretary to the Embassy, and eventually its chargé\nd’affaires. He became the rage of the Parisian salons,\nenjoying the conversation and company of famous European\nintellectuals. He was known for his love of good food and wine, as\nwell as his enjoyment of the attentions and affections of women. \nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1769. He built a house in\nEdinburgh’s New Town, and spent his autumnal years quietly and\ncomfortably, dining and conversing with friends, not all of whom were\n“studious and literary”, for he also found that his\n“company was not unacceptable to the young and careless”\n(MOL 21). He spent considerable time revising his works for new\neditions of his Essays and Treatises, which contained his\ncollected Essays, the two Enquiries, A\nDissertation on the Passions, and The Natural History of\nReligion, but—significantly—not A Treatise of\nHuman Nature. \nIn 1775, Hume was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Before his death\nin 1776, he arranged for the posthumous publication of his most\ncontroversial work, the Dialogues concerning Natural\nReligion, and composed a brief autobiography, “My Own\nLife”. Although there was much curiosity about how “the\ngreat infidel” would face his death, his friends agreed that he\nprepared himself with the same peaceful cheer that characterized his\nlife. \nIn 1775, as he was readying a revised edition of his Essays and\nTreatises for the press, Hume sent his publisher an\n“Advertisement”, asking that it be included in this and\nany subsequent edition of his works. In it, he complains that his\ncritics focused “all their batteries” on the\nTreatise, “that juvenile work”, which he\npublished anonymously and never acknowledged. He urges his readers to\nregard the Enquiries “as containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles”, assuring his publisher that they\nprovide “a compleat answer” to his critics. \nHume’s apparent disavowal of the Treatise and his\nregard for the Enquiries raise a question about how we should\nread his work. Should we take his statements literally and let the\nEnquiries represent his considered view, or should we ignore\nhis “Advertisement” and take the Treatise as the\nbest statement of his position? \nBoth options presuppose that the differences between the\nTreatise and the Enquiries are substantial enough to\nwarrant taking one or the other as best representing Hume’s\nviews, but there are good reasons for doubting this. Even in the\n“Advertisement”, Hume says, “Most of the principles,\nand reasonings, contained in this volume, were published” in the\nTreatise. He repeats his conviction that he was guilty of\n“going to press too early”, and that his aim in the\nEnquiries was to “cast the whole anew … where\nsome negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression,\nare … corrected”. \nHume’s description of his aims suggests another option. Rather\nthan repudiating the Treatise, perhaps his recasting of it\nrepresents a shift in the way he presents his “principles and\nreasoning” rather than a substantive change in what he has to\nsay. He reinforces this option when he says of the first\nEnquiry that the “philosophical Principles are the same\nin both” and that “By shortening & simplifying the\nQuestions, I really render them much more complete” (HL 73.2).\nHe also comments in “My Own Life” that the\nTreatise’s lack of success “proceeded more from\nthe manner than the matter”—more from its\nstructure than its content (MOL 8). It is not unreasonable to\nconclude that Hume’s recasting of the Treatise was\ndesigned to address this issue, which suggests that we might\nunderstand him best by reading both works, despite their differences,\ntogether.  \nAs the title of the Treatise proclaims, Hume’s subject\nis human nature. He summarizes his project in its subtitle: “an\nattempt to introduce the experimental method into moral\nsubjects”. In his day, “moral” meant anything\nconcerned with human nature, not just ethics, as he makes clear at the\nbeginning of the first Enquiry, where he defines “moral\nphilosophy” as “the science of human nature” (EHU\n1.1/5). Hume’s aim is to bring the scientific method to bear on\nthe study of human nature. \nHume’s early studies of philosophical “systems”\nconvinced him that philosophy was in a sorry state and in dire need of\nreform. When he was only 18 years old, he complained in a letter that\nanyone familiar with philosophy realizes that it is embroiled in\n“endless Disputes” (HL 3.2). The ancient philosophers, on\nwhom he had been concentrating, replicated the errors their natural\nphilosophers made. They advanced theories that were “entirely\nHypothetical”, depending “more upon Invention than\nExperience”. He objects that they consulted their imagination in\nconstructing their views about virtue and happiness, “without\nregarding human Nature, upon which every moral Conclusion must\ndepend”. The youthful Hume resolved to avoid these mistakes in\nhis own work, by making human nature his “principal Study, &\nthe Source from which I would derive every Truth” (HL 3.6). \nEven at this early stage, the roots of Hume’s mature approach to\nthe reform of philosophy are evident. He was convinced that the only\nway to improve philosophy was to make the investigation of human\nnature central—and empirical (HL 3.2). The problem with ancient\nphilosophy was its reliance on “hypotheses”—claims\nbased on speculation and invention rather than experience and\nobservation. \nBy the time Hume began to write the Treatise three years\nlater, he had immersed himself in the works of the modern\nphilosophers, but found them disturbing, not least because they made\nthe same mistakes the ancients did, while professing to avoid them.\nWhy, Hume asks, haven’t philosophers been able to make the\nspectacular progress in understanding human nature that natural\nphilosophers—whom we now call\n“scientists”—have recently achieved in the physical\nsciences? His answer is that while scientists have cured themselves of\ntheir “passion for hypotheses and systems”, philosophers\nhaven’t yet purged themselves of this temptation. Their theories\nwere too speculative, relied on a priori assumptions, and\npaid too little attention to what human nature is actually like.\nInstead of helping us understand ourselves, modern philosophers were\nmired in interminable disputes—evident even to “the rabble\nwithout doors”—giving rise to “the common prejudice\nagainst metaphysical reasonings of all kinds”, that is,\n“every kind of argument which is in any way abstruse, and\nrequires some attention to be comprehended” (T xiv.3). \nTo make progress, Hume maintains, we need to “reject every\nsystem … however subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on\nfact and observation”. These systems, covering a wide range of\nentrenched and influential metaphysical and theological views, purport\nto have discovered principles that give us a deeper and more certain\nknowledge of ultimate reality. But Hume argues that in attempting to\ngo beyond anything we can possibly experience, these metaphysical\ntheories try to “penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to\nthe understanding” (EHU 1.11/11), which makes their claims to\nhave found the “ultimate principles” of human nature not\njust false, but unintelligible. These “airy sciences”, as\nHume calls them, have only the “air” of science (EHU\n1.12/12). \nWorse still, these metaphysical systems are smokescreens for\n“popular superstitions” that attempt to overwhelm us with\nreligious fears and prejudices (EHU 1.11/11). Hume has in mind a\nvariety of doctrines that need metaphysical cover to look\nrespectable—arguments for the existence of God, the immortality\nof the soul, and the nature of God’s particular providence.\nMetaphysics aids and abets these and other superstitious doctrines.\n \nBut he insists that because these metaphysical and theological systems\nare objectionable, it doesn’t mean we should give up doing\nphilosophy. Instead, we need to appreciate “the necessity of\ncarrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy”.\nThe only way to resist the allure of these pseudo–sciences is to\nengage with them, countering their “abstruse …\nmetaphysical jargon” with “accurate and just\nreasoning” (EHU 1.12/12). \nThis means that the initial phase of Hume’s project must be\ncritical. A prominent part of this aspect of his project is\nto “discover the proper province of human\nreason”—determining the extent and limits of\nreason’s powers and capacities (EHU 1.12/12). He believes that\nhis investigation will show that metaphysics as the quest for\nunderstanding the ultimate nature of reality is beyond reason’s\nscope. \nScholars once emphasized this critical phase at the expense\nof the rest of Hume’s project, encouraging the charge that he\nwas just a negative skeptic, who rejects the views of others without\ndefending any positive position himself. But while he is indeed\nskeptical about the possibility of metaphysical insights that go\ndeeper than science can, investigating the proper province of reason\nisn’t only a critical activity. His critique of metaphysics\nclears the way for the constructive phase of his\nproject—the development of an empirical science of human\nnature—and Hume is not at all skeptical about its prospects. \nIn his “Introduction” to the Treatise, Hume\nlaunches the constructive phase of his project by proposing nothing\nless than “a compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation entirely new” (T xvi.6). The new foundation is the\nscientific study of human nature. He argues that all the sciences have\nsome relation to human nature, “even Mathematics, Natural\nPhilosophy, and Natural Religion” (T xv.4). They are all human\nactivities, so what we are able to accomplish in them depends on\nunderstanding what kinds of questions we are able to handle and what\nsorts we must leave alone. If we have a better grasp of the scope and\nlimits of our understanding, the nature of our ideas, and the\noperations we perform in reasoning about them, there is no telling\nwhat improvements we might make in these sciences. \nWe should expect even more improvement in the sciences that are more\nclosely connected to the study of human nature: “Logic,\nMorals, Criticism, and Politics”. Many longstanding\nphilosophical debates are about the nature of our\nideas—causation, liberty, virtue and beauty—so getting\nclear about their content should help us cut through these\n“endless disputes”. \nAs the science of human nature is the only solid foundation for the\nother sciences, “the only solid foundation we can give to this\nscience itself must be laid on experience and observation” (T\nxvi.7). Although Hume does not mention him by name, Newton\n(1642–1727) is his hero. He accepts the Newtonian maxim\n“Hypotheses non fingo”, roughly, “I do not\ndo hypotheses”. Any laws we discover must be established by\nobservation and experiment. \nHume is proposing an empiricist alternative to traditional\na priori metaphysics. His empiricism is naturalistic\nin that it refuses to countenance any appeal to the\nsupernatural in the explanation of human nature. As a\nnaturalist, he aims to account for the way our minds work in a manner\nthat is consistent with a Newtonian picture of the world. \nHume portrays his scientific study of human nature as a kind of\nmental geography or anatomy of the mind (EHU\n1.13/13; T 2.1.12.2/326). In the first section of the first\nEnquiry, he says that it has two principal tasks, one purely\ndescriptive, the other explanatory. Mental geography\nconsists in delineating “the distinct parts and powers” of\nthe mind (EHU 1.13/3). While everyone can make some sense of the basic\ndistinctions among the mind’s contents and operations, more\nfine–grained distinctions are harder to grasp. \nHume, however, wants to go much further. He wants to explain\nhow the mind works by discovering its “secret springs and\nprinciples”. He reminds us that astronomers, for a long time,\nwere content with proving the “motions, order, and magnitude of\nthe heavenly bodies”. But then “a\nphilosopher”—Newton—went beyond them and determined\n“the laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets\nare governed and directed” (EHU 1.15/14). Newton’s example\nled other natural philosophers to similar explanatory successes. Hume\nbelieves he will be equally successful in finding the fundamental laws\ngoverning our “mental powers and economy”, if he follows\nthe same caution Newton exhibited in carrying out his inquiries. \nNewton’s scientific method provides Hume with a template for\nintroducing the experimental method into his investigation of the\nmind. In An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, he\nsays he will follow “a very simple method” that he\nbelieves will bring about a transformation in the study of human\nnature. Following Newton’s example, he argues that we should\n“reject every system … however subtile or ingenious,\nwhich is not founded on fact and observation”, and accept only\narguments derived from experience. When we inquire about human nature,\nsince we are asking “a question of fact, not of abstract\nscience”, we must rely on experience and observation (EPM\n1.10/173–174). \nAs the fledgling Newton of the moral sciences, Hume wants to find a\nset of laws that explain how the mind’s\ncontents—perceptions, as he calls them—come and\ngo in the mind and how simple perceptions combine to form complex\nperceptions in ways that explain human thought, belief, feeling and\naction. \nNewton’s achievement was that he was able to explain diverse and\ncomplex physical phenomena in terms of a few general principles. Like\nhim, Hume proposes to explain “all effects from the simplest and\nfewest causes” (T xvii.8). He predicts that it is likely that\none “principle of the mind depends on another” and that\nthis principle may in turn be brought under another principle even\n“more general and universal” (EHU 1.15/15). But he\nemphasizes that while he will try to find the most general principles,\nrendering them as universal as possible, all of his explanations must\nbe based completely on experience. \nAlthough philosophy, as an empirical enterprise, is itself bound by\nexperience, this is not a defect in the science of human nature. The\nsame is true for all the sciences: “None of them can go beyond\nexperience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that\nauthority” (T Intro 10). Explanations must come to an end\nsomewhere. When we see that we have “arriv’d at the utmost\nextent of human reason, we sit down contented”, for the only\nreason we can give for our most general principles is “our\nexperience of their reality” (T 9). \nHume is Newtonian in much more than method. He sees that Newton is\nsignificantly different from John Locke (1632–1704) and the\nother Royal Society natural philosophers, because he rejects their\nmechanist picture of the world. Newton’s greatest discovery, the\nLaw of Gravitation, is not a mechanical law. Hume explicitly models\nhis account of the fundamental principles of the mind’s\noperations—the principles of association—on the idea of\ngravitational attraction. By appealing to these same principles\nthroughout, Hume gives an explanation of these diverse phenomena that\nenable him to provide a unified and economical account of the\nmind. \nTo explain the workings of our minds with the economy Newton displayed\nin his physics, Hume introduces the minimal amount of machinery he\nthinks is necessary to account for the mind’s operations. Each\npiece is warranted by experience. \nThe early modern period was the heyday of the investigation of the\nideas of causation, moral good and evil, and many other\nphilosophically contested ideas. Every modern philosopher accepted\nsome version of the theory of ideas—the view that we\nimmediately perceive certain mental entities called ideas,\nbut don’t have direct access to physical objects. Hume holds an\nempiricist version of the theory, because he thinks that\neverything we believe is ultimately traceable to experience. \nHe begins with an account of perceptions, because he believes\nthat any intelligible philosophical question must be asked and\nanswered in those terms. He uses perception to designate any\nmental content whatsoever, and divides perceptions into two\ncategories, impressions and ideas. \nImpressions include sensations as well as\ndesires, passions, and emotions.\nIdeas are “the faint images of these in thinking and\nreasoning” (T 1.1.1.1/1). He thinks everyone will recognize his\ndistinction, since everyone is aware of the difference between\nfeeling and thinking. It is the difference between\nfeeling the pain of your present sunburn and\nrecalling last year’s sunburn. \nHume distinguishes two kinds of impressions: impressions of\nsensation, or original impressions, and impressions\nof reflection, or secondary impressions. Impressions of\nsensation include the feelings we get from our five senses as well as\npains and pleasures, all of which arise in us “originally, from\nunknown causes” (T 1.1.2.1/7). He calls them original\nbecause trying to determine their ultimate causes would take us beyond\nanything we can experience. Any intelligible investigation must stop\nwith them. \nImpressions of reflection include desires, emotions, passions, and\nsentiments. They are essentially reactions or responses to ideas,\nwhich is why he calls them secondary. Your memories of last\nyear’s sunburn are ideas, copies of the original impressions you\nhad when the sunburn occurred. Recalling those ideas causes you to\nfear that you’ll get another sunburn this year, to\nhope that you won’t, and to want to take\nproper precautions to avoid overexposure to the sun. \nPerceptions—both impressions and ideas—may be either\nsimple or complex. Complex impressions are made up\nof a group of simple impressions. My impression of the violet I just\npicked is complex. Among the ways it affects my senses are its\nbrilliant purple color and its sweet smell. I can separate and\ndistinguish its color and smell from the rest of my impressions of the\nviolet. Its color and smell are simple impressions, which can’t\nbe broken down further because they have no component parts. \nHume initially distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\ndegree of force and vivacity. Impressions are more\nforceful and vivacious than ideas. My impression of this ripe\ntomato’s bright red color is as vivid as anything could be. Last\nyear’s tomatoes were just as vivid when I was looking at them,\nbut now my idea of them is much less vivid than my impressions of the\ntomato in front of me. Since last year’s tomatoes were the same\ncolor, the difference can’t be that they are different shades of\nred; the difference must lie in the sharpness, clarity, and brightness\nof my impressions—their force and vivacity. At\nvarious times, Hume tries other ways of characterizing the difference\nbetween impressions and ideas, but he was never completely satisfied\nwith them. Still, what he says works well enough to give us a handle\non the felt differences between impressions and ideas. \nWhen Hume distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\nrelative force and vivacity, he is pointing out something that is\ngenerally true of them as a matter of fact. On occasion, in dreams or\na high fever, ideas may approach the force and vivacity of\nimpressions, but these are exceptions that prove\nthe—empirical—rule. In general, impressions and ideas are\nso different that no one can deny the distinction.  \nAlthough nothing seems freer than the power of thought, which\nisn’t “restrained within the limits of nature and\nreality” (EHU 2.4/18), Hume insists that our imagination is in\nfact “confined within very narrow limits”. We can separate\nand combine our ideas in new and even bizarre ways, imagining\ncreatures we’ve never seen or faraway galaxies, but all the\nmaterials of thinking are ultimately derived from our impressions.\nSince “all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of\nour impressions or more lively ones”; we are restricted to\n“compounding, transporting, augmenting, or diminishing the\nmaterials afforded us by the senses and experience” (EHU\n2.5/19).  \nIn the Treatise, Hume qualifies his claim that our ideas are\ncopies of our impressions, making clear that it applies only to the\nrelation between simple ideas and simple\nimpressions. He offers this “general proposition”,\nusually called the Copy Principle, as his “first\nprinciple … in the science of human nature”: \nAll our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv’d from\nsimple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they\nexactly represent. (T 1.1.1.7/4) \nHe presents the principle as something that everyone’s\nexperience confirms, but he also gives an argument to establish\nit. \nHe argues first that there is a one–to–one correspondence\nbetween simple ideas and simple impressions. He can’t\nprove that this correspondence holds universally, since he\ncan’t examine every individual impression and idea. But he is so\nconfident the correspondence holds that he challenges anyone who\ndoubts it to produce an example of a simple impression without a\ncorresponding simple idea, or a simple idea without a corresponding\nsimple impression. Since he is certain they will fail, he concludes\nthat there is a constant conjunction between simple\nimpressions and simple ideas. \nNext, he maintains that this constant conjunction is so universal that\nthe correspondence can’t be a matter of chance. There must be a\ncausal connection between them, but do ideas cause impressions or do\nimpressions cause ideas? \nFinally, he argues that experience tells us that simple impressions\nalways precede and thus cause their corresponding ideas. To support\nthis claim, he appeals to two sorts of cases. First, if you want to\ngive a child an idea of the taste of pineapple, you give her a piece\nof pineapple to eat. When you do, you are giving her an impression of\nthe pineapple’s taste. You never go the other way round. His\nother case involves a person born blind, who won’t have ideas of\ncolor because he won’t have impressions of color. \nThe Copy Principle is an empirical thesis, which he emphasizes by\noffering “one contradictory phenomenon” as an empirical\ncounterexample to the principle. He imagines someone who has had the\nsame sorts of experiences of colors most of us have had, but has never\nexperienced a certain shade of blue. Hume thinks that if he orders all\nthe shades of blue he has experienced from the darkest to the\nlightest, he will see immediately that there is a gap where the\nmissing shade should be. Then he asks \nWhether ‘tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to\n… raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade,\ntho’ it had never been convey’d to him by his senses? I\nbelieve there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may\nserve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always deriv’d\nfrom the correspondent impressions; tho’ the instance is so\nparticular and singular, that ‘tis scarce worth our observing,\nand does not merit that for it alone we shou’d alter our general\nmaxim. (T 1.1.1.10/6) \nHume repeats the case of the missing shade almost verbatim in the\nfirst Enquiry. While scholars have wondered exactly how the\nperson might supply the missing shade, he seems unconcerned with the\ndetails. For Hume, once again the exception proves\nthe—empirical—rule. \nAlthough Hume’s distinctive brand of empiricism is often\nidentified with his commitment to the Copy Principle, his use of the\nprinciple’s reverse in his account of definition is perhaps the\nmore innovative element of his system. \nAs his diagnosis of traditional metaphysics reveals, Hume believes\nthat \nthe chief obstacle … to our improvement in the moral or\nmetaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of\nthe terms. (EHU 7.1.2/61) \nConventional definitions—replacing terms with their\nsynonyms—merely replicate philosophical confusions and never\nbreak out of a narrow definitional circle. Getting clear about the\ncontent of the ideas and the meanings of the terms we are\ninvestigating requires something else. \nHume argues that we must “pass from words to the true and real\nsubject of the controversy”—ideas. He believes he has\nfound a way to accurately determine their content—his account of\ndefinition. He touts it as “a new microscope or species of\noptics”, predicting that it will produce equally dramatic\nresults in the moral sciences as its hardware\ncounterparts—telescopes and microscopes—have produced in\nnatural philosophy (EHU 7.1.4/62). \nHume’s account of definition uses a simple series of tests to\ndetermine cognitive content. Begin with a term. Ask what idea is\nannexed to it. If there is no such idea, then the term has no\ncognitive content, however prominently it figures in philosophy or\ntheology. If there is an idea annexed to the term, and it is complex,\nbreak it down into the simple ideas that compose it, and trace them\nback to their original impressions. If the process fails at any point,\nthe idea in question lacks cognitive content. When carried through\nsuccessfully, however, it yields a “just\ndefinition”—a precise account of the troublesome\nidea’s content. \nHume uses his account of definition in the critical phaseof\nhis project to show that many of the central concepts of traditional\nmetaphysics lack intelligible content. He also uses it in the\nconstructive phase to determine the exact meaning of our\nterms and ideas. \nAlthough we are capable of separating and combining our simple ideas\nas we please, there is, nevertheless, a regular order to our thoughts.\nIf ideas occurred to us completely randomly, so that all our thoughts\nwere “loose and unconnected”, we wouldn’t be able to\nthink coherently (T 1.1.4.1/10). This suggests that \nHume explains this “tie or union” in terms of the\nmind’s natural ability to associate certain ideas.\nAssociation is not “an inseparable connexion”, but rather\n“a gentle force, which commonly prevails”, by means of\nwhich one idea naturally introduces another (T 1.1.4.1/10). \nIn the first Enquiry, Hume says that even though it is\nobvious to everyone that our ideas are connected in this way, he is\nthe first philosopher who has “attempted to enumerate or class\nall the principles of association” (EHU 3.2/24). He regards his\nuse of these “universal principles” as so distinctive that\nhe advertises them as his most original contribution—one that\nentitles him call himself an “inventor” (Abstract\n35). \nHume identifies three principles of association: resemblance,\ncontiguity in time and place, and causation. When someone\nshows you a picture of your best friend, you naturally think of her\nbecause the picture resembles her. When you’re reminded\nof something that happened in the 1960s—miniskirts, for\nexample—you may think of the Vietnam War, because they are\ntemporally contiguous. Thinking of Sausalito may lead you to\nthink of the Golden Gate Bridge, which may lead you to think of San\nFrancisco, since they are spatially contiguous.\nCausality works both from cause to effect and effect to\ncause: meeting someone’s father may make you think of his son;\nencountering the son may lead you to thoughts of his father.  \nOf the three associative principles, causation is the\nstrongest, and the only one that takes us “beyond our\nsenses” (T 1.3.2.3/74). It establishes links between our present\nand past experiences and our expectations about the future, so that\n“all reasonings concerning matters of fact seem to be founded on\nthe relation of Cause and Effect” (EHU\n4.1.4/26). Taking aspirin in the past has relieved my headaches, so I\nexpect that the aspirin I just took will soon relieve my present\nheadache. Hume also makes clear that causation is the least understood\nof the associative principles, but he tells us, “we shall have\noccasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom” (T\n1.1.4.2/11). \nLike gravitational attraction, the associative principles are\noriginal, and so can’t be explained further. Although\nthe associative principles’ “effects are everywhere\nconspicuous” their causes “are mostly unknown, and must be\nresolv’d into original qualities of human nature, which\nI pretend not to explain”. Accordingly, we should curb any\n“intemperate desire” to account further for them, for\ndoing so would take us illegitimately beyond the bounds of experience\n(T 1.1.4.6/12–13). \nHume doesn’t try to explain why we associate ideas as\nwe do. He is interested only in establishing that, as a matter of\nfact, we do associate ideas in these ways. Given that his\nclaim that the associative principles explain the important operations\nof the mind is an empirical one, he must admit, as he does in the\nfirst Enquiry, that he cannot prove conclusively that his\nlist of associative principles is complete. Perhaps he has overlooked\nsome additional principle. We are free to examine our own thoughts to\ndetermine whether resemblance, contiguity, and causation successfully\nexplain them. The more instances the associative principles explain,\nthe more assurance we have that Hume has identified the basic\nprinciples by which our minds work. \nIn the Abstract, Hume concludes that it should be “easy\nto conceive of what vast consequences these principles must be in the\nscience of human nature”. Since they “are the only ties of\nour thoughts, they are really to us the cement of the\nuniverse, and all the operations of the mind must, in great measure,\ndepend on them” (Abstract 35). Just what these “vast\nconsequences” are will become clear when we examine Hume’s\nrevolutionary accounts of our causal inferences and moral\njudgments. \nThe medieval synthesis Thomas Aquinas (1224–74) forged between\nChristian theology and Aristotle’s science and metaphysics set\nthe terms for the early modern causation debate. Aristotle\n(384–322 BCE) drew an absolute categorical distinction between\nscientific knowledge (scientia) and belief (opinio).\nScientific knowledge was knowledge of causes and scientific\nexplanation consisted in demonstration—proving the\nnecessary connection between a cause and its effect from\nintuitively obvious premises independently of experience. \nModern philosophers thought of themselves as scientific\nrevolutionaries because they rejected Aristotle’s account of\ncausation. Even so, they accepted his distinction between knowledge\nand belief, and regarded causal inference as an exercise of reason,\nwhich aimed at demonstrating the necessary connection between cause\nand effect. Malebranche (1638–1715), and others following\nDescartes (1596–1650), were optimistic about the possibility of\ndemonstrative scientific knowledge, while those in the British\nexperimental tradition were more pessimistic. Locke was sufficiently\nsceptical about what knowledge we can attain that he constructed one\nof the first accounts of probable inference to show that belief can\nmeet standards of rationality that make experimental natural\nphilosophy intellectually respectable. \nWhen Hume enters the debate, he translates the traditional distinction\nbetween knowledge and belief into his own terms, dividing “all\nthe objects of human reason or enquiry” into two exclusive and\nexhaustive categories: relations of ideas and matters of\nfact.  \nPropositions concerning relations of ideas are intuitively or\ndemonstratively certain. They are known a\npriori—discoverable independently of experience by\n“the mere operation of thought”, so their truth\ndoesn’t depend on anything actually existing (EHU 4.1.1/25).\nThat the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle sum to 180\ndegrees is true whether or not there are any Euclidean triangles\nto be found in nature. Denying that proposition is a contradiction,\njust as it is contradictory to say that 8×7=57. \nIn sharp contrast, the truth of propositions concerning matters of\nfact depends on the way the world is. Their contraries are always\npossible, their denials never imply contradictions, and they\ncan’t be established by demonstration. Asserting that Miami\nis north of Boston is false, but not contradictory. We can\nunderstand what someone who asserts this is saying, even if we are\npuzzled about how he could have the facts so wrong. \nThe distinction between relations of ideas and matters of\nfact is often called “Hume’s Fork”, generally\nwith the negative implication that Hume may be illicitly ruling out\nmeaningful propositions that don’t fit into these two categories\nor fit into both of them. To defuse this objection, however, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that Hume’s categories are his\ntranslations of a traditional absolute categorical classificatory\ndistinction, which all his contemporaries and immediate predecessors\naccepted.  \nHume’s method dictates his strategy in the causation debate. In\nthe critical phase, he argues that his predecessors were\nwrong: our causal inferences aren’t determined by “reason\nor any other operation of the understanding” (EHU 5.1.2/41). In\nthe constructive phase, he supplies an alternative: the\nassociative principles are their basis. \nHume’s contributions to the critical phase of the\ncausation debate are contained in Treatise 1.3.6 and Section\n4 of the first Enquiry, appropriately titled “Sceptical\ndoubts concerning the operations of the understanding”. The\nconstructive phase in his Enquiry account is the\nfollowing section, also appropriately titled “Sceptical solution\nof these doubts”, while the corresponding sections of the\nTreatise stretch from 1.3.7 through 1.3.10.  \nCausal inferences are the only way we can go beyond the evidence of\nour senses and memories. In making them, we suppose there is some\nconnection between present facts and what we infer from them.\nBut what is this connection? How is it established? \nIf the connection is established by an operation of reason or the\nunderstanding, it must concern either relations of ideas or\nmatters of fact. \nHume argues that the connection can’t involve relations of\nideas. Effects are different events from their causes, so there is no\ncontradiction in conceiving of a cause occurring, and its usual effect\nnot occurring. Ordinary causal judgments are so familiar that we tend\nto overlook this; they seem immediate and intuitive. But suppose you\nwere suddenly brought into the world as an adult, armed with the\nintellectual firepower of an Einstein. Could you, simply by examining\nan aspirin tablet, determine that it will relieve your headache? \nWhen we reason a priori, we consider the idea of the object\nwe regard as a cause independently of any observations we have made of\nit. It can’t include the idea of any other distinct\nobject, including the object we take to be its usual effect. But then\nit can’t show us any “inseparable and inviolable\nconnection”—any necessary\nconnection—between those ideas. Trying to reason a\npriori from your idea of an aspirin, without including any\ninformation you have of its effects from your previous experience,\nyields only your simple ideas of its “sensible\nqualities”—its size, shape, weight, color, smell, and\ntaste. It gives you no idea of what “secret powers” it\nmight have to produce its usual effects. Hume concludes that a\npriori reasoning can’t be the source of the connection\nbetween our ideas of a cause and its effect. Contrary to what the\nmajority of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors thought,\ncausal inferences do not concern relations of ideas. \nHume now moves to the only remaining possibility. If causal inferences\ndon’t involve a priori reasoning about relations of\nideas, they must concern matters of fact and experience. When\nwe’ve had many experiences of one kind of event constantly\nconjoined with another, we begin to think of them as cause and effect\nand infer the one from the other. But even after we’ve had many\nexperiences of a cause conjoined with its effect, our inferences\naren’t determined by reason or any other operation of the\nunderstanding. \nIn the past, taking aspirin has relieved my headaches, so I believe\nthat taking aspirin will relieve the headache I’m having now.\nBut my inference is based on the aspirin’s superficial sensible\nqualities, which have nothing to do with headache relief. Even if I\nassume that the aspirin has “secret powers” that are doing\nthe heavy lifting in relieving my headache, they can’t be the\nbasis of my inference, since these “secret powers” are\nunknown. \nNonetheless, Hume observes, “we always presume, when we see like\nsensible qualities, that they have like secret powers, and expect that\neffects, similar to those we have experienced, will follow from\nthem” (EHU 4.2.16/33). Since we neither intuit nor infer a\npriori that similar objects have similar secret powers, our\npresumption must be based in some way on our experience. \nBut our past experience only gives us information about objects as\nthey were when we experienced them, and our present experience only\ntells us about objects we are experiencing now. Causal inferences,\nhowever, do not just record our past and present experiences.\nThey extend or project what we have gathered from\nexperience to other objects in the future. Since it is not necessarily\ntrue that an object with the same sensible qualities will have the\nsame secret powers that past objects with those sensible qualities\nhad, how do we project those experiences into the future, to other\nobjects that may only appear similar to those we’ve previously\nexperienced? \nHume thinks we can get a handle on this question by considering two\nclearly different propositions: \nand \nThere is no question that “the one proposition may be justly\ninferred from the other”, and that “it is always\ninferred”. But since their connection obviously isn’t\nintuitive, Hume challenges us to produce the “chain of\nreasoning” that takes us from propositions like (1) to\npropositions like (2) (EHU 4.2.16/34). \n(1) summarizes my past experience, while (2) predicts what will happen\nin the immediate future. The chain of reasoning I need must show me\nhow my past experience is relevant to my future experience. I need\nsome further proposition or propositions that will establish an\nappropriate link or connection between past and\nfuture, and take me from (1) to (2) using either demonstrative\nreasoning, concerning relations of ideas, or probable\nreasoning, concerning matters of fact. \nHume thinks it is evident that demonstrative reasoning can’t\nbridge the gap between (1) and (2). However unlikely it may be, we can\nalways intelligibly conceive of a change in the course of nature. Even\nthough aspirin relieved my previous headaches, there’s no\ncontradiction in supposing that it won’t relieve the one\nI’m having now, so the supposition of a change in the course of\nnature can’t be proven false by any reasoning concerning\nrelations of ideas. \nThat leaves probable reasoning. Hume argues that there is no probable\nreasoning that can provide a just inference from past to future. Any\nattempt to infer (2) from (1) by a probable inference will be\nviciously circular—it will involve supposing what we are trying\nto prove. \nHume spells out the circularity this way. Any reasoning that takes us\nfrom (1) to (2) must employ some connecting principle that\nconnects the past with the future. Since one thing that keeps us from\nmoving directly from past to future is the possibility that the course\nof nature might change, it seems plausible to think that the\nconnecting principle we need will be one that will assure us that\nnature is uniform—that the course of nature won’t\nchange—something like this uniformity principle: \nAdopting [UP] will indeed allow us to go from (1) to (2). But before\nwe can use it to establish that our causal inferences are determined\nby reason, we need to determine our basis for adopting it. [UP] is\nclearly not intuitive, nor is it demonstrable, as\nHume has already pointed out, so only probable arguments\ncould establish it. But to attempt to establish [UP] this way would be\nto try to establish probable arguments using probable arguments, which\nwill eventually include [UP] itself. \nAt this point, Hume has exhausted the ways reason might establish a\nconnection between cause and effect. He assures us that he offers his\n“sceptical doubts” not as a “discouragement, but\nrather an incitement … to attempt something more full and\nsatisfactory”. Having cleared the way for his constructive\naccount, Hume is ready to do just that. \nHume calls his constructive account of causal inference a\n“sceptical solution” to the “sceptical doubts”\nhe raised in the critical phase of his argument. \nSince we’re determined—caused—to make\ncausal inferences, then if they aren’t “determin’d\nby reason”, there must be “some principle of equal weight\nand authority” that leads us to make them. Hume maintains that\nthis principle is custom or habit: \nwhenever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation … we always say,\nthat this propensity is the effect of Custom. (EHU\n5.1.5/43) \nIt is therefore custom, not reason, which “determines the mind\n… to suppose the future conformable to the past”\n(Abstract 16). But even though we have located the principle, it is\nimportant to see that this isn’t a new principle by\nwhich our minds operate. Custom and habit are\ngeneral names for the principles of association. \nHume describes their operation as a causal process: custom or habit is\nthe cause of the particular propensity you form after your repeated\nexperiences of the constant conjunction of smoke and fire. Causation\nis the operative associative principle here, since it is the only one\nof those principles that can take us beyond our senses and\nmemories. \nHume concludes that custom alone “makes us expect for the\nfuture, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in\nthe past” (EHU 5.1.6/44). Custom thus turns out to be the source\nof the Uniformity Principle—the belief that the future\nwill be like the past. \nCausal inference leads us not only to conceive of the effect,\nbut also to expect it. When I expect that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache, I’m not just abstractly considering the\nidea of headache relief, I believe that aspirin will relieve\nit. What more is involved in believing that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache than in merely conceiving that it\nwill? \nIt can’t be that beliefs have some additional idea—the\nidea of belief, perhaps—that conceptions lack. If there were\nsome such idea, given our ability to freely combine ideas, we could,\nby simply willing, add that idea to any conception whatsoever, and\nbelieve anything we like. \nHume concludes that belief must be some sentiment or feeling aroused\nin us independently of our wills, which accompanies those ideas that\nconstitute them. It is a particular way or manner of conceiving an\nidea that is generated by the circumstances in which we find\nourselves. \nIf constant conjunctions were all that is involved, my thoughts about\naspirin and headaches would only be hypothetical. For belief, one of\nthe conjoined objects must be present to my senses or memories; I must\nbe taking, or just have taken, an aspirin. In these circumstances,\nbelieving that my headache will soon be relieved is as unavoidable as\nfeeling affection for a close friend, or anger when someone harms us.\n“All these operations are species of natural instincts, which no\nreasoning … is able either to produce or prevent” (EHU\n5.1.8/46–47). \nWhile Hume thinks that defining this sentiment may be\nimpossible, we can describe belief, if only by analogy,\nalthough he was never completely satisfied with his attempts to do so.\nBelief is a livelier, firmer, more vivid, steady, and intense\nconception of an object. Hume intends these characterizations to go\nbeyond merely recording intensity of feeling to capture how belief \nrenders realities … more present to us than fictions, causes\nthem to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence\non the passions and imagination. (EHU 5.2.12/49) \nBut how does an idea come to be conceived in such a manner that it\nconstitutes a belief? \nHume’s explanation is that as I become accustomed to\naspirin’s relieving my headaches, I develop a propensity—a\ntendency—to expect headache relief to follow taking aspirin. The\npropensity is due to the associative bond that my repeated experiences\nof taking aspirin and headache relief have formed. My present\nimpressions of taking an aspirin are as forceful and vivid as anything\ncould be, and some of their force and vivacity transfers across the\nassociative path to the idea of headache relief, enlivening it with\nenough force and vivacity to give it the “strength and\nsolidity” that constitutes belief. \nSince I don’t know how aspirin relieves headaches, it is\nfortunate that there is “a kind of pre-established harmony\nbetween the course of nature and the succession of our ideas”\nthat teaches me to take aspirin when I have a headache. Custom, Hume\nmaintains, in language that anticipates and influenced Darwin, \nis that principle by which this correspondence has been effected; so\nnecessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our\nconduct, in every circumstance of human life. (EHU 5.2.21/55) \nIt is far better, Hume concludes, to rely on “the ordinary\nwisdom of nature”, which ensures that we form beliefs “by\nsome instinct or mechanical tendency”, rather than trusting it\nto “the fallacious deductions of our reason” (EHU\n5.2.22/55). \nIn keeping with his project of providing a naturalistic account of how\nour minds work, Hume has given empirical explanations of our\npropensity to make causal inferences, and the way those inferences\nlead to belief. \nThe early modern causation debate revolved around a family of\n“nearly synonymous” key ideas, the most prominent of which\nwere the ideas of power and necessary connection.\nFor Hume, “there are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more\nobscure and uncertain”. He showcases the critical and\nconstructive uses of his account of definition as he attempts\n“to fix … the precise meaning of these terms”, in\norder to “remove some part of that obscurity, which is so much\ncomplained of in this species of philosophy” (EHU\n7.1.3/61–62). \nTo get clear about the idea of power or necessary connection, we need\nto determine the impressions that are its source. Hume identifies\nthree possible sources in the work of his predecessors: Locke thought\nwe get our idea of power secondarily from external\nimpressions of the interactions of physical objects, and\nprimarily from internal impressions of our ability to move\nour bodies and to consider ideas. Malebranche argued that what we take\nto be causes of the motion of bodies or mental activity aren’t\ncauses at all. They are only occasions for God, the sole\nsource of necessary connection, to act in the world. Hume rejects all\nthree possibilities. \nHe argues that external impressions of the interactions of\nbodies can’t give rise to our idea of power. When we see that\nthe motion of one billiard ball follows another, we’re only\nobserving their conjunction, never their\nconnection. \nAttending to internal impressions of the operations of our\nminds doesn’t help. Although voluntary bodily movements follow\nour willing that those movements occur, this is a matter of fact I\nlearn through experience, not from some internal impression of my\nwill’s power. When I decide to type, my fingers move over the\nkeyboard. When I decide to stop, they stop, but I have no idea how\nthis happens. Were I aware of the power of my will to move my fingers,\nI’d know both how it worked and its limits. \nOur ability to control our thoughts doesn’t give us an\nimpression of power, either. We don’t have a clue about how we\ncall up our ideas. Our command over them is limited and varies from\ntime to time. We learn about these limitations and variations only\nthrough experience, but the mechanisms by which they operate are\nunknown and incomprehensible to us. If I decide to think about\nIstanbul, my idea of that city comes to mind, but I experience only\nthe succession of my decision followed by the idea’s appearance,\nnever the power itself. \nWhen ordinary people can’t determine an event’s cause,\nthey attribute it to some “invisible intelligent\nprinciple”. Malebranche and other occasionalists do the same,\nexcept they apply it across the board. True causes aren’t\npowers in the physical world or in human minds. The only true cause is\nGod’s willing that certain objects should always be conjoined\nwith certain others. \nAnyone aware of our minds’ narrow limits should realize that\nMalebranche’s theory takes us into\n“fairyland”—it goes so far beyond our experience\nthat we have no way of intelligibly assessing it. It also capitalizes\non how little we know about the interactions of bodies, but since our\nidea of God is based on extrapolations from our faculties, our\nignorance should also apply to him. \nSince we’ve canvassed the leading contenders for the source of\nour idea of necessary connection and found them wanting, it might\nseem as if we have no such idea, but that would be too hasty.\nIn our discussion of causal inference, we saw that when we find that\none kind of event is constantly conjoined with another, we begin to\nexpect the one to occur when the other does. We suppose there’s\nsome connection between them, and don’t hesitate to call the\nfirst, the cause, and the second, the effect. We\nalso saw that there’s nothing different in the repetition of\nconstantly conjoined cases from the exactly similar single case,\nexcept that after we’ve experienced their constant\nconjunction, habit determines us to expect the effect when the cause\noccurs. \nHume concludes that it is just this felt determination of the\nmind—our awareness of this customary transition from one\nassociated object to another—that is the source of our idea of\nnecessary connection. When we say that one object is necessarily\nconnected with another, we really mean that the objects have acquired\nan associative connection in our thought that gives rise to this\ninference.  \nHaving located the missing ingredient, Hume is ready to offer a\ndefinition of cause. In fact, he gives us two. The first, \nA cause is an object, followed by another, where all the objects\nsimilar to the first are followed by objects similar to the\nsecond, \ngives the relevant external impressions, while the\nsecond, \nA cause is an object followed by another, and whose appearance always\nconveys the thought to the other, \ncaptures the internal impression—our awareness of being\ndetermined by custom to move from cause to effect. Both are\ndefinitions on Hume’s account, but his “just\ndefinition” of our idea of cause is the conjunction of the two\n(EHU 7.2.29/76–77). Only together do they capture all\nthe relevant impressions involved. \nHume locates the source of the idea of necessary connection in\nus, not in the objects themselves or even in our ideas of those\nobjects we regard as causes and effects. In doing so, he completely\nchanges the course of the causation debate, reversing what everyone\nelse thought about the idea of necessary connection. Subsequent\ndiscussions of causation must confront the challenges Hume poses for\ntraditional, more metaphysical, ways of looking at our idea of\ncausation. \nHume’s treatment of our idea of causation is his flagship\nillustration of how his method works and the revolutionary results it\ncan achieve. He goes on to apply both his method, and its concrete\nresults, to other prominent debates in the modern period, including\nprobable inference, testimony for miracles, free will, and intelligent\ndesign. \nHume’s explanation of morality is an important part of his\nefforts to reform philosophy. He takes his primary task to be an\ninvestigation into the origin of the basic moral ideas, which he\nassumes are the ideas of moral goodness and badness. As with the idea\nof cause and necessary connection, he wants to explain moral ideas as\neconomically as possible in terms of their “simplest and fewest\ncauses”. Determining their causes will determine what their\ncontent is—what we mean by them. His secondary concern is to\nestablish what character traits and motives are morally good and\nbad. \nHume follows his sentimentalist predecessor, Francis Hutcheson\n(1694–1746), in building his moral theory around the idea of a\nspectator who approves or disapproves of people’s character\ntraits and motives. The sentiments of approval and disapproval are the\nsource of our moral ideas of goodness and badness. To evaluate a\ncharacter trait as morally good is to evaluate it as virtuous; to\nevaluate it as morally bad is to evaluate it as vicious. \nAs he did in the causation debate, Hume steps into an ongoing debate\nabout ethics, often called the British Moralists debate, which began\nin the mid-seventeenth century and continued until the end of the\neighteenth. He uses the same method here as he did in the causation\ndebate: there is a critical phase in which he argues against\nhis opponents, and a constructive phase in which he\ndevelops his version of sentimentalism. Hume has two sets of\nopponents: the self-love theorists and the moral rationalists. He\nbecame the most famous proponent of sentimentalism. \nThomas Hobbes’ (1588–1679) radical attempt to derive moral\nand political obligation from motives of self-interest initiated the\nBritish Moralists debate. Hobbes, as his contemporaries understood\nhim, characterizes us as naturally self-centered and power-hungry,\nconcerned above all with our own preservation. In the state of nature,\na pre-moral and pre-legal condition, we seek to preserve ourselves by\ntrying to dominate others. Since we are all sufficiently\n“equal” in power, this results in a state of “war of\nall against all” in which life is “nasty, brutish, and\nshort” (Leviathan, Ch. 13).  The way out is to make a\ncompact with one another. We agree to hand over our power and freedom\nto a sovereign, who makes the laws necessary for us to live together\npeacefully and has the power to enforce them. While acting morally\nrequires that we comply with the laws the sovereign establishes, the\nbasis of morality is self-interest. \nBernard Mandeville’s (1670–1733) The Fable of the\nBees served to reinforce this reading of Hobbes during the early\n18th century. According to Mandeville, human beings are\nnaturally selfish, headstrong, and unruly. Some clever politicians,\nrecognizing that we would be better off living together in a civilized\nsociety, took up the task of domesticating us. Realizing that we are\nproud creatures, highly susceptible to flattery, they were able to\ndupe many of us to live up to the ideal of virtue—conquering our\nselfish passions and helping others—by dispensing praise and\nblame. Moral concepts are just tools clever politicians used to tame\nus. \nTwo kinds of moral theories developed in reaction first to Hobbes and\nthen to Mandeville—rationalism and sentimentalism. The\nrationalists oppose Hobbes’ claim that there is no right or\nwrong in the state of nature, that rightness or wrongness is\ndetermined by the sovereign’s will, and that morality requires\nsanctions to motivate us. The sentimentalists object to Hobbes’\nand Mandeville’s “selfish” conceptions of human\nnature and morality. By the mid–eighteenth century, rationalists\nand sentimentalists were arguing not only against Hobbes and\nMandeville, but also with each other. \nHume opposes both selfish and rationalist accounts of morality, but he\ncriticizes them in different works. In the Treatise, Hume\nassumes that Hobbes’ theory is no longer a viable option, so\nthat there are only two possibilities to consider. Either moral\nconcepts spring from reason, in which case rationalism is correct, or\nfrom sentiment, in which case sentimentalism is correct. If one falls,\nthe other stands. In the second Enquiry, Hume continues to\noppose moral rationalism, but his arguments against them\nappear in an appendix. More importantly, he drops the assumption he\nmade in the Treatise and takes the selfish theories of Hobbes\nand Mandeville as his primary target. Once again, he thinks there are\nonly two possibilities. Either our approval is based in self-interest\nor it has a disinterested basis. The refutation of one is proof of the\nother. \nHume thinks that “systems and hypotheses” have also\n“perverted our natural understanding” of morality. The\nviews of the moral rationalists—Samuel Clarke (1675–1729),\nLocke and William Wollaston (1660–1724)—are prominent\namong them. One distinctive, but unhealthy, aspect of modern moral\nphilosophy, Hume believes, is that it allies itself with religion and\nthus sees itself as serving the interests of “popular\nsuperstition”. Clarke’s theory and those of the other\nrationalists epitomize this tendency. \nClarke, Hume’s central rationalist opponent, appeals to reason\nto explain almost every aspect of morality. He believes that there are\ndemonstrable moral relations of fitness and unfitness that we discover\na priori by means of reason alone. Gratitude, for example, is\na fitting or suitable response to kindness, while ingratitude is an\nunfitting or unsuitable response. He believes that the rational\nintuition that an action is fitting has the power both to obligate us\nand to move us. To act morally is to act rationally. \nHume’s most famous and most important objection to moral\nrationalism is two-pronged. In Treatise 2.3.3, “Of the\ninfluencing motives of the will”, he rejects the rationalist\nideal of the good person as someone whose passions and actions are\ngoverned by reason. In T 3.1.1, he uses these arguments to show that\nmoral ideas do not spring from reason alone. \nIn the first prong of his objection, Hume begins by remarking that\nnothing is more common than for philosophers, as well as ordinary\npeople, to talk about the “combat” between reason and\npassion. They say we ought to be governed by reason rather than\npassion, and if our passions are not in line with reason’s\ncommands, we ought to restrain them or bring them into conformity with\nreason. Hume counters that “reason alone can never be a motive\nto any action of the will” and that by itself it can never\noppose a passion in the direction of the will. \nHis first argument rests on his empiricist conception of reason. As we\nsaw in his account of causation, demonstrative reasoning consists in\ncomparing ideas to find relations among them, while probable reasoning\nconcerns matters of fact. He considers mathematical reasoning from the\nrelation of ideas category and causal reasoning from the category of\nmatters of fact. He asks us to look at instances of actions where\nthese two types of reasoning are relevant and says that when we do, we\nwill see that reason alone couldn’t have moved us. \nNo one thinks that mathematical reasoning by itself is capable of\nmoving us. Suppose you want to stay out of debt. This may move you to\ncalculate how much money comes in and how much goes out, but\nmathematical reasoning by itself does not move us to do anything.\nMathematical reasoning, when it bears on action, is always used in\nconnection with achieving some purpose and thus in connection with\ncausal reasoning. \nHume, however, argues that when causal reasoning figures in the\nproduction of action, it always presupposes an existing desire or\nwant. On his view, reasoning is a process that moves you from one idea\nto another. If reasoning is to have motivational force, one of the\nideas must be tied to some desire or affection. As he says, \nIt can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are\ncauses, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects are\nindifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us,\ntheir connexion can never give them any influence; and ‘tis\nplain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion,\nit cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us (T\n2.3.3.3/414). \nNoticing a causal connection between exercise and losing weight will\nnot move you to exercise, unless you want to lose weight. \nIt immediately follows that reason alone cannot oppose a passion in\nthe direction of the will. To oppose a passion, reason must be able to\ngive rise to a motive by itself, since only a motive can oppose\nanother motive, but he has just shown that reason by itself is unable\nto do this. \nHaving exposed reason’s pretensions to rule, Hume inverts the\nrationalist’s ideal of the good person, and concludes that\n“Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and\ncan never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem” (T 2.3.3.4/415). \nThe second prong of Hume’s objection, the argument from\nmotivation, is directed primarily against Clarke and concerns the\nsource of our moral concepts: either they spring from reason or from\nsentiment. Couching this debate in terms of his own version of the\ntheory of ideas, he reminds us that to engage in any sort of mental\nactivity is to have a perception before the mind, so “to approve\nof one character, to condemn another, are only so many different\nperceptions” (T 3.1.1.2/456). Since there are only two types of\nperception—ideas and impressions—the question between\nrationalism and sentimentalism is \nWhether ’tis by means of our ideas or impressions we\ndistinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable\nor praise-worthy?  (T 3.1.1.3/456) \nThe argument from motivation has only two premises. The first is that\nmoral ideas have pervasive practical effects. Experience shows that we\nare often motivated to perform an action because we think it is\nobligatory or to refrain because we think it is unjust. We try to\ncultivate the virtues in ourselves and are proud when we succeed and\nashamed when we fail. If morality did not have these effects on our\npassions and actions, moral rules and precepts would be pointless, as\nwould our efforts to be virtuous. Thus “morals excite passions,\nand produce or prevent actions” (T 3.1.1.6/457). \nThe second premise is that by itself reason is incapable of exciting\npassions or producing and preventing actions, which Hume supports with\nthe arguments we just looked at about the influencing motives of the\nwill. The argument from motivation, then, is that if moral concepts\nare capable of exciting passions and producing or preventing actions,\nbut reason alone is incapable of doing these things, then moral\nconcepts can’t spring from reason alone. \nReason for Hume is essentially passive and inert: it is incapable by\nitself of giving rise to new motives or new ideas. Although he thinks\nthe argument from motivation is decisive, in T 3.1.1 he offers a\nbattery of additional arguments, which are intended to show that moral\nconcepts do not arise from reason alone. \nHume takes the defeat of rationalism to entail that moral concepts\nspring from sentiment. Of course, he was not the first to claim that\nmoral ideas arise from sentiment. Hutcheson claimed that we possess,\nin addition to our external senses, a special moral sense that\ndisposes us to respond to benevolence with the distinctive feelings of\napprobation. Hume, however, rejects the idea that the moral sentiments\narise from a sense that is an “original quality”\nand part of our “primary constitution”. \nHe first argues that there are many different types of virtue, not all\nof which are types of benevolence—respecting people’s\nproperty rights, keeping promises, courageousness, and\nindustriousness—as Hutcheson maintained. If we agree with Hume,\nbut keep Hutcheson’s idea of a moral sense, we would have to\nbelieve that we have many different “original” senses,\nwhich dispose us to approve of the variety of different virtues\nseparately. But he complains that this is not only highly implausible,\nbut also contrary to the \nusual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles\nproduce all the variety we observe in the universe. (T 3.1.2.6/473)\n \nInstead of multiplying senses, we should look for a few general\nprinciples to explain our approval of the different virtues. \nThe real problem, however, is that Hutcheson just\nclaims—hypothesizes—that we possess a unique, original\nmoral sense. If asked why we have a moral sense, his reply is that God\nimplanted it in us. Although in his critical phase Hume freely borrows\nmany of Hutcheson’s arguments to criticize moral rationalism,\nhis rejection of a God-given moral sense puts him on a radically\ndifferent path from Hutcheson in his constructive phase. One way of\nunderstanding Hume’s project is to see it as an attempt to\nnaturalize Hutcheson’s moral sense theory. He aims to provide a\nwholly naturalistic and economical explanation of how we come to\nexperience the moral sentiments that also explains why we approve of\nthe different virtues. In the course of explaining the moral\nsentiments, Hutcheson’s idea of an original moral sense\ndisappears from Hume’s account of morality. \nIn Treatise 3.3.1, Hume turns to his constructive task of\nproviding a naturalistic explanation of the moral sentiments. He\nrefers to them as feelings of approval or disapproval, praise or\nblame, esteem or contempt. Approval is a kind of pleasant or agreeable\nfeeling; disapproval a kind of painful or disagreeable feeling. In\nseveral key passages, he describes the moral sentiments as calm forms\nof love and hatred. When we evaluate our own character traits, pride\nand humility replace love and hatred. \nHume’s project is “to discover the true origin of morals,\nand of that love or hatred, which arises” (T 3.3.1/575) when we\ncontemplate our own or other people’s character traits and\nmotives. He traces the moral sentiments to sympathy. Sympathy\nis a psychological mechanism that explains how we come to feel what\nothers are feeling. It is not itself a feeling or sentiment and so\nshould not be confused with feelings of compassion or pity. Hume\nappeals to sympathy to explain a wide range of phenomena: our interest\nin history and current affairs, our ability to enjoy literature,\nmovies, and novels, as well as our sociability. It is central to his\nexplanations of our passions, our sense of beauty, and our sense of\nwhat is morally good and bad. \nSympathy is a process that moves me from my idea of what someone is\nfeeling to actually experiencing the feeling. There are four steps to\nthis process. I first arrive at the idea of what someone is feeling in\nany of the usual ways. I next become aware of the\nresemblances between us, so we are linked by that principle\nof association. While we resemble every human being to some extent, we\nalso resemble some individuals more than others—for instance,\nthose who share our language or culture or are the same age and sex as\nwe are. The associative principles of contiguity and\ncausality also relate individuals who are located closely to\nus in time or space or who are family members or teachers. According\nto Hume, we are able to sympathize more easily and strongly with\nindividuals with whom we have strong associative ties. The stronger\nthe associative relations, the stronger our sympathetic responses.\nHume then claims—controversially—that we always have a\nvivid awareness of ourselves. Finally, he reminds us that the\nprinciples of association not only relate two perceptions, but they\nalso transmit force and vivacity from one perception to another. \nSuppose my friend recently suffered a devastating loss and I realize\nshe is feeling sad. The associative principles transmit force and\nvivacity from my vivid awareness of myself to my idea of my\nfriend’s sadness. Since for Hume the difference between\nimpressions and ideas is that impressions are more lively and\nvivacious than ideas, if an idea of a passion is sufficiently\nenlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. I now feel sad too, but\nnot quite as strongly as my friend. \nThe way Hume uses the idea that the associative principles transmit\nforce and vivacity in his explanation of sympathy is parallel to the\nway he uses it in his explanation of causal inference. In the case of\ncausal inference, if we have an impression of an effect (smoke), the\nassociative principles give rise not only to the idea of its cause\n(fire), but they also transmit some of the impression’s force\nand vivacity to the idea of its cause, so that we come to believe that\nfire is the cause of the smoke. A belief is an idea that is so lively\nthat it is like an impression, and influences us in the way\nimpressions do. Similarly, my lively awareness of myself enlivens by\nassociation my idea of my friend’s sadness. But the result in\nthe case of sympathy is even stronger: when an idea of a passion is\nsufficiently enlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. \nOne advantage Hume’s explanation of the moral sentiments in\nterms of sympathy has over Hutcheson’s claim that we possess a\nGod-given moral sense is that it enables him to provide a unified\ntheory of the mind. He explains the moral sentiments by appealing to\nsympathy, which, in turn, he explains in terms of the same associative\nprinciples he invoked to explain causal beliefs. Without sympathy, and\nthe associative principles that explain it, we would be\nunimaginably different than we are—creatures without causal\nor moral ideas. \nHume develops his account of moral evaluation further in response to\ntwo objections to his claim that the moral sentiments arise from\nsympathy. The first is the “sympathy is variable”\nobjection. Sympathy enables us to enter into the feelings of anyone,\neven strangers, because we resemble everyone to some extent. But it is\nan essential feature of his account of the natural and spontaneous\noperation of sympathy that our ability to respond sympathetically to\nothers varies with variations in the associative relations. I am able\nto sympathize more easily and strongly with someone who resembles me\nor is related to me by contiguity or causation. The objection is that\nthe moral sentiments can’t be based in sympathy because the\nloves and hatreds that result from the natural and spontaneous\nworkings of sympathy vary, but our moral approval doesn’t vary.\nThe second objection is that “virtue in rags” still evokes\nour approval. Sympathy works by looking at the actual effects of a\nperson’s character traits, but sometimes misfortune or lack of\nopportunity may prevent an individual from exercising their good\ncharacter traits, yet we still admire them. \nHume argues that moral love and hatred spring from sympathy, but only\nwhen we regulate our sympathetic reactions by taking up what he calls\n“the general point of view”. There are two regulatory\nfeatures to the general point of view. The first is that we survey a\nperson’s character from the perspective of the person and his\nusual associates—friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers. We\nsympathize with the person and the people with whom that person\nregularly interacts and judge character traits in terms of whether\nthey are good or bad for these people. Second, we regulate sympathy\nfurther by relying on general rules that specify the general effects\nand tendencies of character traits rather than sympathizing with their\nactual effects. \nBy putting together these two regulatory features, we arrive at\nHume’s idea of the general point of view, which defines a\nperspective from which we may survey a person’s character traits\nthat we share with everyone. When we occupy the general point of view,\nwe sympathize with the person herself and her usual associates, and\ncome to admire the person for traits that are normally good for\neveryone. The general point of view is, for Hume, the moral\nperspective. We do not experience the moral sentiments unless we have\nalready taken up the general point of view. The moral sentiments and\nthe concepts to which they give rise are products of taking up that\nstandpoint. \nHume offers the claim that we admire four sorts of character\ntraits—those that are useful or immediately agreeable to the\nagent or to others—as an empirical hypothesis. While he provides\nsupport for it in his discussion of the individual virtues, he also\nuses his fourfold classification to undermine Christian conceptions of\nmorality. He makes pride a virtue and humility a vice. He throws out\nthe “monkish” virtues—celibacy, fasting, and\npenance—on the grounds that they are not pleasant or useful to\nanyone. He also rejects the distinction between virtues and natural\ntalents, which legislators, “divines” and modern moralists\ndefend by claiming that the moral virtues are voluntary, whereas\nnatural talents aren’t. Their goal is to reform us—or at\nleast our outward behavior—making us better, when understood in\nChristian terms. They accordingly restrict the domain of the moral to\nactions that proceed from character traits because they believe only\nthey can be modified, shaped, and controlled by sanctions, while\ntalents can’t. Hume, however, rejects the distinction along with\nthe dubious function these reformers assign to morality. \nHume identifies both what has value and what makes things valuable\nwith features of our psychology. Our first-order sentiments, passions\nand affections, as well as actions expressive of them, are what have\nmoral value. Our second-order reflective sentiments about our own or\nother people’s sentiments, passions and affections are what give\nthem value. On his view, morality is entirely a product of human\nnature. \nIn the “Conclusion” of the second Enquiry, Hume\nsummarizes his explanation of morality with a definition of virtue or\nmerit: \nevery quality of mind, which is useful or agreeable\nto the person himself or to others,\ncommunicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is\nadmitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit. (EPM\n9.1.12/277) \nThis is a precise parallel of his two definitions of cause in the\nfirst Enquiry. Both sets of definitions pick out features of\nevents, and both record a spectator’s response to those\nevents. \nHume’s second Enquiry is a sustained and systematic\nattack on the “selfish” or “self-love”\ntheories of Hobbes and Mandeville. He follows Hutcheson in thinking\nthat they assign two distinct roles to self-interest in their accounts\nof morality: first, moral approval and disapproval are based in a\nconcern for our own interest and, second, the motive of which we\nultimately approve is self-interest. Although many people during this\nperiod understood Hobbes’ theory through Mandeville’s\nlens, Hume believes it is important to distinguish them. As he sees\nit, Mandeville’s theory is superficial and easily dismissed.\nHobbes is his main opponent. \nHume’s rejection of Hobbes’ selfish account of approval\nand disapproval begins in Section II and ends in Part I of the\n“Conclusion” of the Enquiry. Like Hutcheson, he\nmistakenly supposes that Hobbes was offering a rival theory of\napproval and disapproval. We approve of people’s character\ntraits when they benefit us and disapprove of them when they harm us.\nHume looks at each of the four types of virtue and argues that in each\ncase, our approval does not spring from a concern for our own\nhappiness, but rather from sympathy. \nIn Section II, Hume argues that one reason we approve of benevolence,\nhumanity, and public spiritedness is that they are useful to others\nand to society. In Sections III and IV, he argues that the sole ground\nfor approving of justice and political allegiance is that they are\nuseful to society. In Section V, he asks: But useful for whom? Since\nit is obvious that it has to be “for some body’s\ninterest”, the question is “Whose interest then?” He\nassumes there are only two possibilities: approval and disapproval\nspring either from sentiments that are interested or from a\ndisinterested source. \nAccording to Hume, Hobbes’ “deduction of morals from\nself-love” begins with our realization that we cannot subsist\nalone. A social order provides security, peace, and mutual protection,\nconditions that allow us to promote our own interests better than if\nwe lived alone. Our own good is thus bound up with the maintenance of\nsociety. Although Hume agrees with Hobbes up to this point, he rejects\nhis explanation that we approve of justice, benevolence, and humanity\nbecause they promote our own happiness. \nHume is confident that “the voice of nature and\nexperience” will show that Hobbes’ theory, understood in\nthis way, is mistaken. Borrowing many of Hutcheson’s arguments,\nhe points out that if approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout the possible advantages and disadvantages to us of\npeople’s characters and actions, we would never feel approval\nand disapproval of people from “very distant ages and remote\ncountries”, since they cannot possibly affect us. We would never\nadmire the good deeds of our enemies or rivals, since they are hurtful\nto us. We would also never approve or disapprove of characters\nportrayed in novels or movies, since they are not real people and\ncannot possibly help or harm us. We approve of character traits and\nactions that are useful not because they benefit us, but because we\nsympathize with the benefits they bestow on others or society. \nHume next examines the remaining three types of character\ntraits—those that are useful to the agent (industriousness, good\njudgment), agreeable to the agent (cheerfulness) or agreeable to\nothers (politeness, decency). Why, for example, do we approve of\nindustriousness and good judgment, character traits that are primarily\nadvantageous to the possessor? In most cases they are of absolutely no\nbenefit to us and, in cases of rivalry, they counteract our own\ninterest. We approve of these character traits not because they are\nbeneficial to us, but because we sympathize with the benefits they\nconfer on others. Hume takes this as further evidence against\nHobbes’ explanation in terms of self-interest and in support of\nhis sympathy-based account. \nIn Part I of the “Conclusion”, Hume complains that\nHobbes’ self-love theory is unable to explain two important\nfeatures of our moral sentiments: we tend to approve of the same sorts\nof character traits and we are able to morally evaluate anyone, at any\ntime or place. If our approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout our own benefits and harms, the moral sentiments would vary from\nperson to person and for the same person over time. We wouldn’t\nhave moral feelings about most people, since most people don’t\naffect us. The moral sentiments spring from our capacity to respond\nsympathetically to others. \nHume is equally adamant that any explanation of the motives that\nprompt us to virtuous actions in terms of self-interest is mistaken.\nHe opposes them in Appendix II of the Enquiry, which was\noriginally part of Section II, “Of Benevolence”. He\nfollows Hutcheson in thinking that the issue is whether the various\nbenevolent affections are genuine or arise from self-interest. Once\nagain he distinguishes Mandeville’s from Hobbes’\nexplanations of benevolence and takes Hobbes to be his main opponent.\nOn Hume’s reading of Hobbes, while we approve of kindness,\nfriendship, and other benevolent affections, any desire to benefit\nothers really derives from self-interest, although we may not always\nbe conscious of its influence on those desires. \nHume offers two arguments against this selfish view. He first asks us\nto consider cases in which people are motivated by a genuine concern\nfor others, even when such concern could not possibly benefit them and\nmight even harm them. We grieve when a friend dies, even if the friend\nneeded our help and patronage. How could our grief be based in\nself-interest? Parents regularly sacrifice their own interests for the\nsake of their children. Non-human animals care about members of their\nown species and us. Is their concern a “deduction” of\nself-interest? He concludes that these and “a thousand other\ninstances … are marks of a general benevolence in human nature,\nwhere no interest binds us” (EPM App 2.11/300). \nHume supplements this argument from experience with a highly\ncompressed sketch of an argument he borrows from Butler. Happiness\nconsists in the pleasures that arise from the satisfaction of our\nparticular appetites and desires. It is because we want food, fame,\nand other things that we take pleasure in getting them. If we did not\nhave any particular appetites or desires, we would not want anything\nand there would be nothing from which we would get pleasure. To get\nthe pleasures that self-love aims at, we must want something other\nthan happiness itself. \nHume rightly showcases his pioneering account of justice. In the\nTreatise, he emphasizes the distinction between the natural\nand artificial virtues. The natural virtues—being humane, kind,\nand charitable—are character traits and patterns of behavior\nthat human beings would exhibit in their natural condition, even if\nthere were no social order. The artificial virtues—respecting\npeople’s property rights, fidelity in keeping promises and\ncontracts, and allegiance to government—are dispositions based\non social practices and institutions that arise from conventions. \nHume believes that nature has supplied us with many\nmotives—parental love, benevolence, and generosity—that\nmake it possible for us to live together peacefully in small societies\nbased on kinship relations. One of his important insights is that\nnature has not provided us with all the motives we need to live\ntogether peacefully in large societies. After arguing in\nTreatise 3.2.1 that justice is artificial, in T 3.2.2, he\nasks two different questions: What motivates human beings to establish\nthe rules of justice that give rise to property rights, and why do we\napprove of people who obey these rules of justice? The first question\nconcerns justice as a practice constituted by its rules. The second\nconcerns justice as a virtue, a person’s disposition to obey the\nrules of justice. \nHume argues that we enter into a series of conventions to bring about\npractices, each of which is a solution to a problem. Each convention\ngives rise to new problems that in turn pressure us to enter into\nfurther conventions. The convention to bring about property rights is\nonly the first of several into which we enter. After property rights\nare established, we enter into conventions to transfer property and to\nmake promises and contracts. According to him, we are by nature\ncooperators, although at first we cooperate only with members of our\nown family. But it is also advantageous for us to cooperate with\nstrangers, since it allows us to produce more goods and to exchange\nthem. All three conventions are prior to the formation of government.\nOn Hume’s view, it is possible for there to be a peaceful\nsociety of property owners who transfer and exchange material\npossessions before there is government.  \nHume argues that the practice of justice is a solution to a problem we\nnaturally face. The problem is that since we care most about our\nfamily and close friends, but material goods are scarce and portable,\nwe are tempted to take goods from strangers to give to our family and\nfriends. Disputes over these goods are inevitable, but if we quarrel\nwe will forfeit the benefits that result from living together in\nsociety—increased power, ability, and security. The solution to\nthe problem is to establish property rights. We make rules that\nspecify who has a right to what, and agree to follow the rules and to\nkeep our hands off the property of others. Hume was one of the\nfirst to see that what is useful is the practice of justice, rather\nthan individual acts of justice. Like Hobbes, he believes that it is\nin our interest to have the practice of justice in place. \nAs we just saw, Hume parts company with Hobbes when he answers the\nsecond question about why we approve of people who obey the rules of\njustice. If Hobbes’ answer in terms of self-interest is\nexcluded, he thinks only one possibility remains. We approve of just\npeople not because they benefit us but because we sympathize with the\nbenefits they bestow on others and society as a whole. Hume thus\nexplains our approval of justice by appealing to the same principle he\ninvoked to explain our approval of the natural virtues. Thus \nIn Part 2 of the “Conclusion” of the Enquiry,\nHume raises a serious problem with his account of justice. While it is\nin our interest to have the practice of justice in place, it may not\nalways be in our interest to obey its rules in every case. This is the\nfree rider problem. The free rider, whom Hume calls the sensible\nknave, wants to get the benefits that result from having a practice in\nplace without having to always follow its rules. He knows that the\nonly way to obtain the advantages of social cooperation is for the\npractice of justice to be in place, but he also realizes that a single\nact of injustice will not significantly damage the practice. Most people\nwill obey the rules of justice, so if he commits one act of injustice,\nthe institution will not be in any danger of collapsing. Suppose he\nhas the opportunity to commit an act of injustice that will benefit\nhim greatly. Why shouldn’t he?  \nHume confesses that if the sensible knave expects an answer, he is not\nsure there is one that will convince him. \nIf his heart rebel not against such pernicious maxims, if he feel no\nreluctance to thoughts of villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a\nconsiderable motive to virtue…. (EPM 9.2.23/283) \nThere is no general agreement about whether Hume actually provides an\nanswer to the sensible knave and if he does, whether it is\nadequate. \nHume wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question\nin the philosophy of religion, contributing to ongoing debates about\nthe reliability of reports of miracles, the immateriality and\nimmortality of the soul, the morality of suicide, and the natural\nhistory of religion, among others. All his work excited heated\nreactions from his contemporaries, and his arguments still figure\ncentrally in discussions of these issues today. \nHume’s greatest achievement in the philosophy of religion is the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion, which is generally\nregarded as one of the most important and influential contributions to\nthis area of philosophy. While all Hume’s books provoked\ncontroversy, the Dialogues were thought to be so inflammatory\nthat his friends persuaded him to withhold them from publication until\nafter his death. \nHume’s philosophical project, and the method he developed to\nexecute it, dictates his strategy in all the debates he entered. In\nthe debates about causation and ethics, there is an initial\ncritical phase, where Hume assesses the arguments of his\npredecessors and contemporaries, followed by a constructive\nphase, where he develops his own position. In the natural\nreligion debate, however, the situation is very different.\nHume’s critique of the central concepts of natural religion in\nthe critical phase shows that these concepts have no content,\nso there is nothing for the constructive phase of his\nargument to be about. Instead of resolving this debate, Hume\neffectively dissolves it. \nThe Dialogues are a sustained and penetrating critical\nexamination of a prominent argument from analogy for the existence and\nnature of God, the argument from design. The argument from design\nattempts to establish that the order we find in the universe is so\nlike the order we find in the products of human artifice that it too\nmust be the product of an intelligent designer. \nThe Dialogues record a conversation between three characters.\nCleanthes, a self–­proclaimed “experimental\ntheist”, offers the argument from design as an empirical proof\nof God’s existence and nature (DCNR 5.2/41). Demea\nopposes him, maintaining that the argument’s merely probable\nconclusion demeans God’s mystery and majesty. He believes that\nGod’s nature is completely inscrutable. Cleanthes dubs Demea a\nmystic, while Demea derides Cleanthes’\nanthromorphism—his human–centered bias in\ncomparing the creator of the universe to a human mind. \nCleanthes and Demea represent the central positions in the\neighteenth–century natural religion debate. Cleanthes embodies\nits dominant, progressive strain, consisting primarily of theologians\nin the British Royal Society, who were fascinated by probability and\nthe previous century’s impressive successes in experimental\nnatural philosophy. Convinced that the new science gave witness to\nGod’s providence, they rejected traditional a priori\nproofs, which purported to demonstrate God’s existence with\nmathematical certainty and without appeal to experience. Instead, they\nused the order and regularity they found in the universe to construct\na probabilistic argument for a divine designer. \nHoldouts clung to demonstrative proof in science and theology against\nthe rising tide of probability. Demea is the champion of these\nconservative traditionalists. Since he trots out a lame version of\nSamuel Clarke’s cosmological argument in Part 9, some have\nthought that Hume models Demea on him. But Demea lacks Clarke’s\nrigid rationalism. It is more likely that he epitomizes a group of\nminor theologians such as William King, who stressed God’s\nincomprehensibility and resorted to a priori arguments only\nwhen they absolutely needed them. \nThere was no genuinely sceptical presence in the\neighteenth–century natural religion debate. This makes\nPhilo, who both Cleanthes and Demea characterize as a\nsceptic, the ringer in the conversation. Although all three\ncharacters say very Humean things at one time or another,\nPhilo’s views are consistently the closest to Hume’s.\nPhilo’s form of scepticism is the mitigated scepticism\nof the first Enquiry, which makes him the most likely\ncandidate for Hume’s spokesman. \nAs the Dialogues begin, all three characters agree that their\nsubject is God’s nature, since everyone agrees that he\nexists. Parts 1–8 concern God’s natural\nattributes, his omnipotence, omniscience, and providence, while\nParts 10 and 11 consider his moral attributes, his\nbenevolence and righteousness. \nDemea holds that God is completely unknown and incomprehensible; all\nwe can say is that God is a being without restriction, absolutely\ninfinite and universal. Cleanthes is adamant that the argument from\ndesign establishes all of God’s traditional attributes. Natural\nobjects and human artifacts resemble one another, so by analogy, their\ncauses also resemble each other. God is therefore like a human mind,\nonly very much greater in every respect. \nDemea objects that the argument’s conclusion is only probable,\nbut Philo responds that the real problem is that the analogy is so\nweak. He launches a battery of arguments to show just how weak it is.\nThe dissimilarities between human artifacts and the universe are more\nstriking than their similarities. We only experience a tiny part of\nthe universe for a short time; much of what we do experience is\nunknown to us. How can we legitimately infer anything about remote\nparts of the universe, much less the universe as a whole? \nPhilo, however, moves quickly away from chipping at the\nargument’s strength to questioning the intelligibility\nof its conclusion. We have no experience of the origin of a\nuniverse. Since causal inference requires a basis in experienced\nconstant conjunction between two kinds of things, how can we\nlegitimately draw any conclusion whatsoever about the origin of the\nuniverse? Does it even require a cause? One or many? Does the cause of\nthe universe itself require a cause? The problem, then, is not just\nthat the analogy is weak; the real problem is that it attempts to take\nus beyond what we can know. \nMeanwhile, Demea derides Cleanthes’ anthropomorphism\nwhile remaining smugly satisfied with what Cleanthes disparagingly\ncalls his mysticism. The barbs they throw at each other, and\nthe speeches Philo goads them to make, help create a dilemma that\nPhilo uses them to construct. He directs the dilemma at Cleanthes, but\nit affects both characters, although Demea is slow to realize this. He\nthinks Philo is in league with him in detailing the problems with\nCleanthes’ anthropomorphism. \nChallenging Cleanthes to explain what he means by God’s mind,\nPhilo pushes him to admit that he means “a mind like the\nhuman”. Cleanthes, taking the bait, responds, “I know of\nno other” (DCNR 5.4/42). He argues that mystics like Demea are\nno better than atheists, since they make God so remote and\nincomprehensible that he bears no resemblance to human\ncharacteristics. Philo adds that although we regard God as perfect,\nperfection—as we understand it—is relative, not absolute,\nso we can’t conclude that we grasp God’s perfections.\nSince all God’s attributes involve perfection—perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, perfect goodness—we shouldn’t\nthink that any of his attributes resemble or are even\nanalogous to ours. But this means that we don’t know what\nwe’re talking about when we talk about God using the familiar\nterms we apply to human minds. \nDemea adds that giving God human characteristics, even if they are\ngreatly magnified, denies him attributes theists have always ascribed\nto him. How can an anthropomorphic God have the unity,\nsimplicity, and immutability of the God of\ntraditional theism? \nPhilo continues to detail just how inconvenient\nCleanthes’ anthropomorphism really is. If he accepts the\nargument from design, he must be committed to a God who is finite in\nall respects. But what does it mean to say that God is finitely\nperfect? Once you admit that God is finite, you’ve opened a\ncan of worms, for there are all sorts of equally probable alternatives\nto intelligent design. Why think that the universe is more like a\nhuman artifact than an animal or a vegetable? To illustrate, Philo\nthrows out a number of outlandish alternative hypotheses. For\ninstance, if you were a spider on a planet of spiders, wouldn’t\nyou naturally believe that a giant spider spun an immense web to\ncreate the world? \nCleanthes’ design hypothesis is so underdetermined by the\nevidence that the only reasonable approach is to abandon any attempt\nto adjudicate among it and its many alternatives. Total suspension of\njudgment is the only reasonable response. Otherwise, we go beyond the\nbounds of anything to which we can give specific content. \nThe dilemma Philo has constructed encapsulates the issue about the\ncontent of the idea of God that is central to the critical\naspect of Hume’s project in the Dialogues. If you\naccept that God’s attributes are infinitely perfect, you are\nusing ordinary terms without their ordinary meaning, so that they do\nnot have any clear meaning. If you deny God’s infinite\nperfection, you can give him understandable attributes, but only\nbecause they are amplified human characteristics. The closer Cleanthes\ncomes to regarding God’s mind as like a human mind, the closer\nhe comes to regarding God’s attributes as being like human\nattributes, and the less Godlike his “God” is. We can only\ngive the idea of God intelligible content at the perilously high cost\nof denying that he is really God. To do so is to abandon God for some\nkind of superhero. \nAt the end of Part 8, which concludes their discussion of God’s\nnatural attributes, Demea still thinks that Philo and he are partners.\nHe remains clueless about Philo’s strategy until the very end of\nPart 11, when he finally realizes that he too is caught in the trap\nPhilo has sprung. \nDemea offers an a priori alternative to the design argument\nin Part 9. As noted earlier, it is an abbreviated, watered–down\nversion of Clarke’s cosmological argument. Although Cleanthes\nquickly scotches his lame efforts, Part 9 serves as an interlude\nbetween the previous discussion of God’s natural\nattributes and the consideration of his moral attributes\nin Parts 10 and 11. \nDemea begins the discussion in Part 10. Attempting to save face from\nhis recent drubbing, he suggests that we don’t accept the truths\nof religion as a result of reasoning, but from what we feel\nwhen confronted with how helpless and miserable we are. Religion is\nbased on feelings of fear and anxiety that arise from awareness of our\n“imbecility and misery” (DCNR 10.1/68). Our forms of\nworship are attempts to appease unknown powers that oppress and\ntorment us. \nPhilo joins in, claiming he is convinced that \nthe best and indeed the only method of bringing everyone to a due\nsense of religion is by just representations of the misery and\nwickedness of men. (DCNR 10.2/68) \nThey proceed with a joint litany of the misery and melancholy of the\nhuman condition, topping each other with catalogues of woes. Demea\ndoes not realize that Philo may mean very different things by\n“just representation” and “due sense of\nreligion” than he does, so he fails to realize that Philo is\njust egging him on. \nPhilo maintains that we can’t evade the facts of disease,\nfamine, and pestilence, except by “apologies, which still\nfarther aggravate the charge” (DCNR 10.16/72). These apologies\nare theodicies—systematic attempts to reconcile\nGod’s goodness with the existence of evil. Demea is also\nscornful of theodicies, blissfully unaware that all too soon he will\nbe offering his own. \nCleanthes finally breaks in to say that he doesn’t feel\noppressively anxious or miserable, and hopes that anguish isn’t\nas common as they claim. But hoping that the extent of human\nmisery is not so widespread is not the same as proving that\nit is. Cleanthes is on weak ground. Philo capitalizes on it,\nchallenging Cleanthes to explain how God’s mercy and benevolence\ncan possibly resemble human mercy and benevolence. Given God’s\nomnipotence, whatever he wills happens, but neither humans nor animals\nare happy, so God presumably does not will their happiness. \nCleanthes—“smiling”—grants that if Philo can\nprove that mankind is “unhappy or corrupted”, he\nwill have succeeded in doing in religion (DCNR 10.28/74). He thinks he\nfinally has Philo on the ropes. In forcing a sceptic to prove a\npositive thesis, he must not only succeed at a difficult task, but\nviolates his scepticism in the process. Cleanthes fails to realize\nthat Philo will make his case without needing to prove anything, nor\ndoes he realize that he will soon be the one who needs a\nproof. \nDemea objects that Cleanthes exaggerates the dire consequences of\nacknowledging the human condition, and, despite his earlier vehement\nrejection of theodicies, offers his own. Sometimes called “the\nporch view”, Demea’s theodicy compares our experience of\nthe world to the world as a whole, including the afterlife, to trying\nto determine the structure of a large building from what little we can\nsee from its porch. From our perspective, we suffer, but from a longer\nview, either we don’t suffer at all, or else our suffering is\nfor our greater good or for the greater good of the world. \nCleanthes retorts that Demea denies the facts, and offers only empty\nhypotheses, which, if intelligible at all, could only establish their\nbare possibility, but never their reality. The only way to respond to\nchallenges to God’s benevolence is to deny that the human\ncondition is really so miserable. \nCleanthes has now put himself in the position in which he thought he\nhad put Philo. He must establish that the facts are as he claims, and\nPhilo is quick to stress how difficult this will be. By resting his\ncase on such an uncertain point, any conclusion he draws will be\nequally uncertain. \nPhilo then ups the ante by granting for the sake of argument that\nhuman happiness exceeds human misery. But if God is infinitely\npowerful, wise, and good, why is there any misery at all? There is no\nanswer that preserves all God’s attributes, except to grant that\nthe subject exceeds the limits of our understanding. \nPhilo, however, refrains from pressing the question of\nintelligibility; he is more interested in building an even\nstronger case against Cleanthes’ inference to God’s\nbenevolence. Raising the ante higher still, he grants that\npain and suffering are compatible with God’s infinite\npower and goodness. Cleanthes, however, must prove from the\n“mixed and confused phenomena” that God’s\nbenevolence is actual, not merely possible. Doing so\nis doubly difficult, since any inference from finite to infinite is\nshaky at best, even when the data are “pure and unmixed”\n(DCNR 10.35/77). \nPhilo concludes by admitting, with less than complete sincerity, that\nwhile he was hard pressed to make his case against Cleanthes when the\ndiscussion concerned God’s natural attributes, where his moral\nattributes are concerned, he is at ease. He challenges Cleanthes\n“to tug the laboring oar” and explain how he can infer\nGod’s moral attributes from the facts about the human condition\n(DCNR 10.36/77). \nCleanthes “tugs”, but only for one short paragraph. He\nadmits that if we go beyond their usual meanings when we apply human\nterms to God, what we say is indeed unintelligible. Abandoning all\nhuman analogy is thus to abandon natural religion, but preserving it\nmakes it impossible to reconcile evil with an infinite God. \nCleanthes realizes he has painted himself into a corner, but once\nagain he thinks there is a way out. Abandon God’s infinity;\nthink of him as “finitely perfect”. Then\n“benevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may\nproduce just such a world as the present” (DCNR 11.1/78). \nCleanthes doesn’t realize that his new theory is worse than his\nold one. He also doesn’t seem to remember Philo’s earlier\nquestion about what “finitely perfect” might possibly\nmean. Instead of God, he is now committed to some kind of superhero.\nBesides, the story he is telling is itself a theodicy. His\nsuperhero’s limitations explain why he cannot eliminate evil, or\ncreate an evil–free world. \nIn any case, Cleanthes is no better off than he was before.\nConjectures may show that the data are consistent with the\nidea of God, but are never sufficient to prove that he actually\nexists. \nPhilo then proceeds to outline four possible hypotheses about the\ncause of the universe: it is perfectly good; it is perfectly evil; it\nis both good and evil; it is neither good nor evil. Given the evil we\nknow exists, the data is at best mixed, so we can’t\nestablish either of the first two hypotheses. The regularity and\nuniformity of the general laws we find in experience is sufficient to\ndiscount the third, so the fourth seems the most probable. On that\nhypothesis, the cause of the universe is entirely indifferent to the\namount of good and evil in the world. \nThese points about natural evil also apply to moral\nevil. We have no more reason to think that God’s righteousness\nresembles human righteousness than we have to think that his\nbenevolence resembles human benevolence. We have even less reason, in\nfact, since moral evil outweighs moral goodness more than natural evil\noutweighs natural goodness. \nIn addition, Cleanthes’ new form of anthropomorphism is saddled\nwith tracing moral evil back to God. Since every effect must have a\ncause, either the chain of causes goes back infinitely, or it stops\nwith the original principle that is the ultimate cause of all\nthings—God. \nAt this point, Demea, who has become increasingly agitated during\nPhilo’s speech, interrupts. He finally realizes that the case\nPhilo is making cuts against his own view as much as it cuts against\nCleanthes’. Although it might appear that Demea can retreat to\nsome form of the theodicy he sketched earlier, the extent to which\nPhilo’s argument upsets him suggests that he now realizes it is\ninadequate. If he leans on the mystery–mongering he has\nprofessed until now, Philo has shown that, because of its lack of\nspecific content, it does not point exclusively to a good God. It may\njust as well commit him to a supreme being who is “beyond good\nand evil” and is totally indifferent to morality. Commitment\nwithout content turns out to be no commitment at all. Demea realizes\nthis, dimly at least, as he leaves the conversation. \nWith Demea’s departure, Cleanthes and Philo are left to finish\nthe conversation. Their tone is conciliatory, so conciliatory that\nPhilo says he must “confess” that although he is less\ncautious about natural religion than any other subject, \nno one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays\nmore profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself\nto reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature.\n(DCNR 12.2/89) \nPhilo’s “confession” paves the way for a blockbuster\nthat has puzzled generations of readers. Philo seems to reverse field,\napparently recanting what he has argued for so forcefully. He grants\nCleanthes that “a purpose, an intention, a design, strikes\neverywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker” (DCNR\n12.2/89). \nHis remarks are, however, by no means straightforward. Some take\nPhilo—and, by implication, Hume—to be outing himself as a\ncloset theist. Others conclude that, since he holds all the cards at\nthis point, he can afford to be conciliatory. Read ironically, Philo\ncould be saying that while “careless and stupid” observers\nare struck by purpose, intention, and design in the universe, careful,\ncritical, intelligent ones are not. But there is no need to force the\nirony here. Read straight, nature’s “contrivance and\nartifice” is “inexplicable” precisely because reason\ncan discover nothing about God’s natural or moral attributes.\nEveryone—even the stupid and careless—can see that the\nparts of animals and plants have functions, and so can easily\nunderstand why “an anatomist, who discovered a new organ or\ncanal, would never be satisfied until he had also discovered its use\nand intention” (DCNR 12.2/90). \nRecognizing that an organism’s parts have\nuses—functions—says nothing about\nwhether their uses or functions are due to a designer’s plan, so\nPhilo’s acknowledgement implies nothing about whether he now\naccepts the design hypothesis. In fact, what he says here reiterates\nhis position in Part 8, that function alone is no proof of divine\ndesign: \nit is in vain … to insist on the uses of the parts of animals\nor vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain\nknow how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted?\n(DCNR 8.9/61) \nNo one should deny design in this sense, so long as they do\nso “without any religious purpose” (DCNR 12.2/90). Far\nfrom reversing himself, then, Philo’s position is continuous\nwith the line he has taken throughout the Dialogues. \nAs the conversation continues, Philo provides a diagnosis of the\ndispute. While the works of nature do bear “a great\nanalogy” to the products of human artifice, as its proponents\nclaim, there are also considerable differences. He suspects that this\nmay be the source of the intractability of the controversy, which\nsuggests that it may be at bottom “somewhat of a dispute of\nwords” (DCNR 12.6/92). \nBut verbal disputes can be resolved—or\ndissolved—by providing clear definitions. However, the\ndilemma about the content of our idea of God that Philo has\nconstructed clearly implies that such a constructive solution\nis not possible here. \nPhilo explains why only a critical solution is possible by\noffering a deeper diagnosis of the problem. Although the dispute may\nappear to be merely verbal, it is in fact “still more incurably\nambiguous”, for \nthere is a species of controversy, which, from the very nature of\nlanguage and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, and\ncan never, by any precaution or any definitions, be able to reach a\nreasonable certainty or precision. These are the controversies\nconcerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance. (DCNR\n12.7/92) \nThis is exactly what the dispute over intelligent design is about.\nAnalogies are always matters of degree, and the degrees of the\nqualities involved in the design argument aren’t capable of\nexact measurement. The controversy thus “admits not of any\nprecise meaning, nor consequently of any determination” (DCNR\n12.7/93). The dispute about design is actually worse than a\nverbal dispute. \nThat is why anyone, even an atheist, can say, with equal plausibility,\nthat “the rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and\nthe structure of human thought” all “probably bear some\nremote analogy to each other” (DCNR 12.7/93). That is why Philo,\nwithout renouncing any of his previous claims, can assent to the\n“somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined”, and, as we have\nseen, indefinable proposition into which \nthe whole of natural theology … resolves itself …\nthat the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear\nsome remote analogy to human intelligence. (DCNR 12.33/101) \nAnything is like anything else in some remote respect. So the\nordering principle of the universe, if indeed there is one, can be\nabsolutely anything. \nIf this is all there is to “the whole of natural\ntheology”, then we can certainly conclude that the\nargument’s conclusion has no religiously significant content.\nBut it has no religiously significant content because Philo’s\ncritique has drained it of any content whatsoever. Cleanthes’\ndesign hypothesis is not just false; it is unintelligible. \nThe conversation began with all three participants agreeing that their\ntopic was to discuss only God’s nature, not his\nexistence. As it concludes, it is no longer clear that these\nquestions are really so distinct as originally assumed. We don’t\nknow what we’re talking about when we talk about a God whose\nnature is inconceivable, incomprehensible, indeterminate, and\nindefinable. What, then, are we to make of the claim about his\nexistence? \nThe Dialogues draw out the consequences of Hume’s\nstatement, in the first Enquiry, that \nthe idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good\nBeing, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and\naugmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom.\n(EHU 2.6/19) \nIf we insist on “augmenting without limit”, we let loose\nthe moorings that give intelligible content to God’s\nintelligence, wisdom, and goodness. If we stop short of the limit, we\nmay have content, but we have also lost God.","contact.mail":"wmorris@iwu.edu","contact.domain":"iwu.edu"},{"date.published":"2001-02-26","date.changed":"2019-04-17","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/","author1":"William Edward Morris","author2":"Charlotte R. Brown","entry":"hume","body.text":"\n\n\nGenerally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write\nin English, David Hume (1711–1776) was also well known in his\nown time as an historian and essayist. A master stylist in any genre,\nhis major philosophical works—A Treatise of Human\nNature (1739–1740), the Enquiries concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748) and concerning the Principles of\nMorals (1751), as well as his posthumously published\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779)—remain\nwidely and deeply influential.\n\n\nAlthough Hume’s more conservative contemporaries denounced his\nwritings as works of scepticism and atheism, his influence is evident\nin the moral philosophy and economic writings of his close friend Adam\nSmith. Kant reported that Hume’s work woke him from his\n“dogmatic slumbers”  and\nJeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume “caused the scales to\nfall” from his eyes. \n\nCharles Darwin regarded his work as a\ncentral influence on the theory of evolution. The diverse directions\nin which these writers took what they gleaned from reading him reflect\nboth the richness of their sources and the wide range of his\nempiricism. Today, philosophers recognize Hume as a thoroughgoing\nexponent of philosophical naturalism, as a precursor of contemporary\ncognitive science, and as the inspiration for several of the most\nsignificant types of ethical theory developed in contemporary moral\nphilosophy.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Hume spent his childhood at Ninewells, his\nfamily’s modest estate in the border lowlands. He came from a\n“good family” (MOL 2)—socially well connected but\nnot wealthy. His father died just after David’s second birthday,\nleaving him and his elder brother and sister in \nthe care of our Mother, a woman of singular Merit, who, though young\nand handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of\nher Children. (MOL 3)  \nKatherine Falconer Hume realized that David was uncommonly precocious,\nso when his older brother went up to Edinburgh University, Hume went\nwith him, although he was only 10 or 11. There he studied Latin and\nGreek, read widely in history and literature, ancient and modern\nphilosophy, and also did some mathematics and natural\nphilosophy—what we now call natural science. \nThe education David received, both at home and at the university,\naimed at training pupils to a life of virtue regulated by stern\nScottish Calvinist strictures. Prayers and sermons were prominent\naspects of his home and university life. At some point, Hume read\nThe Whole Duty of Man, a widely circulated Anglican\ndevotional tract that details our duties to God, our fellow human\nbeings, and ourselves. \nHume’s family thought him suited for a legal career, but he\nfound the law “nauseous”, preferring to read classical\ntexts, especially Cicero. He decided to become a “Scholar and\nPhilosopher”, and followed a rigorous program of reading and\nreflection for three years until “there seem’d to be\nopen’d up to me a new Scene of Thought” (HL 3.2). The\nintensity of developing his philosophical vision precipitated a\npsychological crisis in the isolated scholar.  \nThe crisis eventually passed, and Hume remained intent on articulating\nhis “new Scene of Thought”. As a second son, his\ninheritance was meager, so he moved to France, where he could live\ncheaply, and finally settled in La Flèche, a sleepy village in\nAnjou best known for its Jesuit college where Descartes and Mersenne\nhad studied a century before. Here he read French and other\ncontinental authors, especially Malebranche, Dubos, and Bayle, and\noccasionally baited the Jesuits with arguments attacking their\nbeliefs. By this time, Hume had not only rejected the religious\nbeliefs with which he was raised, but was also opposed to organized\nreligion in general, an opposition that remained constant throughout\nhis life. In 1734, when he was only 23, he began writing A\nTreatise of Human Nature. \nHume returned to England in 1737 to ready the Treatise for\nthe press. To curry favor with Joseph Butler (1692–1752), he\n“castrated” his manuscript, deleting his controversial\ndiscussion of miracles, along with other “nobler parts”\n(HL 6.2). Book I, “Of the Understanding”, and Book II,\n“Of the Passions”, appeared anonymously in 1739. The next\nyear saw the publication of Book III, “Of Morals”, as well\nas his anonymous “Abstract” of Books I and II. \nThe Treatise was no literary sensation, but it didn’t\nfall “deadborn from the press” (MOL 6), as Hume\ndisappointedly described its reception. Despite his surgical\ndeletions, it attracted enough of “a Murmour among the\nZealots” (MOL 6) to fuel his lifelong reputation as an atheist\nand a sceptic. When he applied for the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatical\n(“Mental”) Philosophy at Edinburgh in 1745, his reputation\nprovoked vocal and ultimately successful opposition. Six years later,\nhe stood for the Chair of Logic at Glasgow, only to be turned down\nagain. Hume never held an academic post. \nIn 1745, he accepted a position as a young nobleman’s tutor,\nonly to discover that his charge was insane. A year later he became\nsecretary to his cousin, Lieutenant General James St Clair, eventually\naccompanying him on an extended diplomatic mission in Austria and\nItaly.  \nIn 1748, An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding appeared,\ncovering the central ideas of Book I of the Treatise and his\ndiscussion of liberty and necessity from Book II. He also included\nmaterial he had excised from the Treatise. In 1751, he\npublished An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, a\n“recasting” of Book III of the Treatise, which he\ndescribed as “incomparably the best” of all his work (MOL\n10). More essays, the Political Discourses, appeared in 1752,\nand Hume’s correspondence reveals that a draft of the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion was also underway at\nthis time. \nAn offer to serve as Librarian to the Edinburgh Faculty of Advocates\ngave Hume the opportunity to begin another project, a History of\nEngland, using the law library’s excellent resources.\nPublished in six volumes between 1754 and 1762, his History\nwas a bestseller well into the next century, giving him the financial\nindependence he had long sought. But even as a librarian, Hume’s\nreputation as an atheist and sceptic dogged him. One of his orders for\n“indecent Books” prompted an unsuccessful move for his\ndismissal and excommunication from the Kirk. Friends and publishers\npersuaded him to suppress some of his more controversial writings on\nreligion during his lifetime. \nIn 1763, Hume accepted a position as private secretary to the British\nAmbassador to France. During his three-year stay in Paris, he became\nSecretary to the Embassy, and eventually its chargé\nd’affaires. He became the rage of the Parisian salons,\nenjoying the conversation and company of famous European\nintellectuals. He was known for his love of good food and wine, as\nwell as his enjoyment of the attentions and affections of women. \nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1769. He built a house in\nEdinburgh’s New Town, and spent his autumnal years quietly and\ncomfortably, dining and conversing with friends, not all of whom were\n“studious and literary”, for he also found that his\n“company was not unacceptable to the young and careless”\n(MOL 21). He spent considerable time revising his works for new\neditions of his Essays and Treatises, which contained his\ncollected Essays, the two Enquiries, A\nDissertation on the Passions, and The Natural History of\nReligion, but—significantly—not A Treatise of\nHuman Nature. \nIn 1775, Hume was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Before his death\nin 1776, he arranged for the posthumous publication of his most\ncontroversial work, the Dialogues concerning Natural\nReligion, and composed a brief autobiography, “My Own\nLife”. Although there was much curiosity about how “the\ngreat infidel” would face his death, his friends agreed that he\nprepared himself with the same peaceful cheer that characterized his\nlife. \nIn 1775, as he was readying a revised edition of his Essays and\nTreatises for the press, Hume sent his publisher an\n“Advertisement”, asking that it be included in this and\nany subsequent edition of his works. In it, he complains that his\ncritics focused “all their batteries” on the\nTreatise, “that juvenile work”, which he\npublished anonymously and never acknowledged. He urges his readers to\nregard the Enquiries “as containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles”, assuring his publisher that they\nprovide “a compleat answer” to his critics. \nHume’s apparent disavowal of the Treatise and his\nregard for the Enquiries raise a question about how we should\nread his work. Should we take his statements literally and let the\nEnquiries represent his considered view, or should we ignore\nhis “Advertisement” and take the Treatise as the\nbest statement of his position? \nBoth options presuppose that the differences between the\nTreatise and the Enquiries are substantial enough to\nwarrant taking one or the other as best representing Hume’s\nviews, but there are good reasons for doubting this. Even in the\n“Advertisement”, Hume says, “Most of the principles,\nand reasonings, contained in this volume, were published” in the\nTreatise. He repeats his conviction that he was guilty of\n“going to press too early”, and that his aim in the\nEnquiries was to “cast the whole anew … where\nsome negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression,\nare … corrected”. \nHume’s description of his aims suggests another option. Rather\nthan repudiating the Treatise, perhaps his recasting of it\nrepresents a shift in the way he presents his “principles and\nreasoning” rather than a substantive change in what he has to\nsay. He reinforces this option when he says of the first\nEnquiry that the “philosophical Principles are the same\nin both” and that “By shortening & simplifying the\nQuestions, I really render them much more complete” (HL 73.2).\nHe also comments in “My Own Life” that the\nTreatise’s lack of success “proceeded more from\nthe manner than the matter”—more from its\nstructure than its content (MOL 8). It is not unreasonable to\nconclude that Hume’s recasting of the Treatise was\ndesigned to address this issue, which suggests that we might\nunderstand him best by reading both works, despite their differences,\ntogether.  \nAs the title of the Treatise proclaims, Hume’s subject\nis human nature. He summarizes his project in its subtitle: “an\nattempt to introduce the experimental method into moral\nsubjects”. In his day, “moral” meant anything\nconcerned with human nature, not just ethics, as he makes clear at the\nbeginning of the first Enquiry, where he defines “moral\nphilosophy” as “the science of human nature” (EHU\n1.1/5). Hume’s aim is to bring the scientific method to bear on\nthe study of human nature. \nHume’s early studies of philosophical “systems”\nconvinced him that philosophy was in a sorry state and in dire need of\nreform. When he was only 18 years old, he complained in a letter that\nanyone familiar with philosophy realizes that it is embroiled in\n“endless Disputes” (HL 3.2). The ancient philosophers, on\nwhom he had been concentrating, replicated the errors their natural\nphilosophers made. They advanced theories that were “entirely\nHypothetical”, depending “more upon Invention than\nExperience”. He objects that they consulted their imagination in\nconstructing their views about virtue and happiness, “without\nregarding human Nature, upon which every moral Conclusion must\ndepend”. The youthful Hume resolved to avoid these mistakes in\nhis own work, by making human nature his “principal Study, &\nthe Source from which I would derive every Truth” (HL 3.6). \nEven at this early stage, the roots of Hume’s mature approach to\nthe reform of philosophy are evident. He was convinced that the only\nway to improve philosophy was to make the investigation of human\nnature central—and empirical (HL 3.2). The problem with ancient\nphilosophy was its reliance on “hypotheses”—claims\nbased on speculation and invention rather than experience and\nobservation. \nBy the time Hume began to write the Treatise three years\nlater, he had immersed himself in the works of the modern\nphilosophers, but found them disturbing, not least because they made\nthe same mistakes the ancients did, while professing to avoid them.\nWhy, Hume asks, haven’t philosophers been able to make the\nspectacular progress in understanding human nature that natural\nphilosophers—whom we now call\n“scientists”—have recently achieved in the physical\nsciences? His answer is that while scientists have cured themselves of\ntheir “passion for hypotheses and systems”, philosophers\nhaven’t yet purged themselves of this temptation. Their theories\nwere too speculative, relied on a priori assumptions, and\npaid too little attention to what human nature is actually like.\nInstead of helping us understand ourselves, modern philosophers were\nmired in interminable disputes—evident even to “the rabble\nwithout doors”—giving rise to “the common prejudice\nagainst metaphysical reasonings of all kinds”, that is,\n“every kind of argument which is in any way abstruse, and\nrequires some attention to be comprehended” (T xiv.3). \nTo make progress, Hume maintains, we need to “reject every\nsystem … however subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on\nfact and observation”. These systems, covering a wide range of\nentrenched and influential metaphysical and theological views, purport\nto have discovered principles that give us a deeper and more certain\nknowledge of ultimate reality. But Hume argues that in attempting to\ngo beyond anything we can possibly experience, these metaphysical\ntheories try to “penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to\nthe understanding” (EHU 1.11/11), which makes their claims to\nhave found the “ultimate principles” of human nature not\njust false, but unintelligible. These “airy sciences”, as\nHume calls them, have only the “air” of science (EHU\n1.12/12). \nWorse still, these metaphysical systems are smokescreens for\n“popular superstitions” that attempt to overwhelm us with\nreligious fears and prejudices (EHU 1.11/11). Hume has in mind a\nvariety of doctrines that need metaphysical cover to look\nrespectable—arguments for the existence of God, the immortality\nof the soul, and the nature of God’s particular providence.\nMetaphysics aids and abets these and other superstitious doctrines.\n \nBut he insists that because these metaphysical and theological systems\nare objectionable, it doesn’t mean we should give up doing\nphilosophy. Instead, we need to appreciate “the necessity of\ncarrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy”.\nThe only way to resist the allure of these pseudo–sciences is to\nengage with them, countering their “abstruse …\nmetaphysical jargon” with “accurate and just\nreasoning” (EHU 1.12/12). \nThis means that the initial phase of Hume’s project must be\ncritical. A prominent part of this aspect of his project is\nto “discover the proper province of human\nreason”—determining the extent and limits of\nreason’s powers and capacities (EHU 1.12/12). He believes that\nhis investigation will show that metaphysics as the quest for\nunderstanding the ultimate nature of reality is beyond reason’s\nscope. \nScholars once emphasized this critical phase at the expense\nof the rest of Hume’s project, encouraging the charge that he\nwas just a negative skeptic, who rejects the views of others without\ndefending any positive position himself. But while he is indeed\nskeptical about the possibility of metaphysical insights that go\ndeeper than science can, investigating the proper province of reason\nisn’t only a critical activity. His critique of metaphysics\nclears the way for the constructive phase of his\nproject—the development of an empirical science of human\nnature—and Hume is not at all skeptical about its prospects. \nIn his “Introduction” to the Treatise, Hume\nlaunches the constructive phase of his project by proposing nothing\nless than “a compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation entirely new” (T xvi.6). The new foundation is the\nscientific study of human nature. He argues that all the sciences have\nsome relation to human nature, “even Mathematics, Natural\nPhilosophy, and Natural Religion” (T xv.4). They are all human\nactivities, so what we are able to accomplish in them depends on\nunderstanding what kinds of questions we are able to handle and what\nsorts we must leave alone. If we have a better grasp of the scope and\nlimits of our understanding, the nature of our ideas, and the\noperations we perform in reasoning about them, there is no telling\nwhat improvements we might make in these sciences. \nWe should expect even more improvement in the sciences that are more\nclosely connected to the study of human nature: “Logic,\nMorals, Criticism, and Politics”. Many longstanding\nphilosophical debates are about the nature of our\nideas—causation, liberty, virtue and beauty—so getting\nclear about their content should help us cut through these\n“endless disputes”. \nAs the science of human nature is the only solid foundation for the\nother sciences, “the only solid foundation we can give to this\nscience itself must be laid on experience and observation” (T\nxvi.7). Although Hume does not mention him by name, Newton\n(1642–1727) is his hero. He accepts the Newtonian maxim\n“Hypotheses non fingo”, roughly, “I do not\ndo hypotheses”. Any laws we discover must be established by\nobservation and experiment. \nHume is proposing an empiricist alternative to traditional\na priori metaphysics. His empiricism is naturalistic\nin that it refuses to countenance any appeal to the\nsupernatural in the explanation of human nature. As a\nnaturalist, he aims to account for the way our minds work in a manner\nthat is consistent with a Newtonian picture of the world. \nHume portrays his scientific study of human nature as a kind of\nmental geography or anatomy of the mind (EHU\n1.13/13; T 2.1.12.2/326). In the first section of the first\nEnquiry, he says that it has two principal tasks, one purely\ndescriptive, the other explanatory. Mental geography\nconsists in delineating “the distinct parts and powers” of\nthe mind (EHU 1.13/3). While everyone can make some sense of the basic\ndistinctions among the mind’s contents and operations, more\nfine–grained distinctions are harder to grasp. \nHume, however, wants to go much further. He wants to explain\nhow the mind works by discovering its “secret springs and\nprinciples”. He reminds us that astronomers, for a long time,\nwere content with proving the “motions, order, and magnitude of\nthe heavenly bodies”. But then “a\nphilosopher”—Newton—went beyond them and determined\n“the laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets\nare governed and directed” (EHU 1.15/14). Newton’s example\nled other natural philosophers to similar explanatory successes. Hume\nbelieves he will be equally successful in finding the fundamental laws\ngoverning our “mental powers and economy”, if he follows\nthe same caution Newton exhibited in carrying out his inquiries. \nNewton’s scientific method provides Hume with a template for\nintroducing the experimental method into his investigation of the\nmind. In An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, he\nsays he will follow “a very simple method” that he\nbelieves will bring about a transformation in the study of human\nnature. Following Newton’s example, he argues that we should\n“reject every system … however subtile or ingenious,\nwhich is not founded on fact and observation”, and accept only\narguments derived from experience. When we inquire about human nature,\nsince we are asking “a question of fact, not of abstract\nscience”, we must rely on experience and observation (EPM\n1.10/173–174). \nAs the fledgling Newton of the moral sciences, Hume wants to find a\nset of laws that explain how the mind’s\ncontents—perceptions, as he calls them—come and\ngo in the mind and how simple perceptions combine to form complex\nperceptions in ways that explain human thought, belief, feeling and\naction. \nNewton’s achievement was that he was able to explain diverse and\ncomplex physical phenomena in terms of a few general principles. Like\nhim, Hume proposes to explain “all effects from the simplest and\nfewest causes” (T xvii.8). He predicts that it is likely that\none “principle of the mind depends on another” and that\nthis principle may in turn be brought under another principle even\n“more general and universal” (EHU 1.15/15). But he\nemphasizes that while he will try to find the most general principles,\nrendering them as universal as possible, all of his explanations must\nbe based completely on experience. \nAlthough philosophy, as an empirical enterprise, is itself bound by\nexperience, this is not a defect in the science of human nature. The\nsame is true for all the sciences: “None of them can go beyond\nexperience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that\nauthority” (T Intro 10). Explanations must come to an end\nsomewhere. When we see that we have “arriv’d at the utmost\nextent of human reason, we sit down contented”, for the only\nreason we can give for our most general principles is “our\nexperience of their reality” (T 9). \nHume is Newtonian in much more than method. He sees that Newton is\nsignificantly different from John Locke (1632–1704) and the\nother Royal Society natural philosophers, because he rejects their\nmechanist picture of the world. Newton’s greatest discovery, the\nLaw of Gravitation, is not a mechanical law. Hume explicitly models\nhis account of the fundamental principles of the mind’s\noperations—the principles of association—on the idea of\ngravitational attraction. By appealing to these same principles\nthroughout, Hume gives an explanation of these diverse phenomena that\nenable him to provide a unified and economical account of the\nmind. \nTo explain the workings of our minds with the economy Newton displayed\nin his physics, Hume introduces the minimal amount of machinery he\nthinks is necessary to account for the mind’s operations. Each\npiece is warranted by experience. \nThe early modern period was the heyday of the investigation of the\nideas of causation, moral good and evil, and many other\nphilosophically contested ideas. Every modern philosopher accepted\nsome version of the theory of ideas—the view that we\nimmediately perceive certain mental entities called ideas,\nbut don’t have direct access to physical objects. Hume holds an\nempiricist version of the theory, because he thinks that\neverything we believe is ultimately traceable to experience. \nHe begins with an account of perceptions, because he believes\nthat any intelligible philosophical question must be asked and\nanswered in those terms. He uses perception to designate any\nmental content whatsoever, and divides perceptions into two\ncategories, impressions and ideas. \nImpressions include sensations as well as\ndesires, passions, and emotions.\nIdeas are “the faint images of these in thinking and\nreasoning” (T 1.1.1.1/1). He thinks everyone will recognize his\ndistinction, since everyone is aware of the difference between\nfeeling and thinking. It is the difference between\nfeeling the pain of your present sunburn and\nrecalling last year’s sunburn. \nHume distinguishes two kinds of impressions: impressions of\nsensation, or original impressions, and impressions\nof reflection, or secondary impressions. Impressions of\nsensation include the feelings we get from our five senses as well as\npains and pleasures, all of which arise in us “originally, from\nunknown causes” (T 1.1.2.1/7). He calls them original\nbecause trying to determine their ultimate causes would take us beyond\nanything we can experience. Any intelligible investigation must stop\nwith them. \nImpressions of reflection include desires, emotions, passions, and\nsentiments. They are essentially reactions or responses to ideas,\nwhich is why he calls them secondary. Your memories of last\nyear’s sunburn are ideas, copies of the original impressions you\nhad when the sunburn occurred. Recalling those ideas causes you to\nfear that you’ll get another sunburn this year, to\nhope that you won’t, and to want to take\nproper precautions to avoid overexposure to the sun. \nPerceptions—both impressions and ideas—may be either\nsimple or complex. Complex impressions are made up\nof a group of simple impressions. My impression of the violet I just\npicked is complex. Among the ways it affects my senses are its\nbrilliant purple color and its sweet smell. I can separate and\ndistinguish its color and smell from the rest of my impressions of the\nviolet. Its color and smell are simple impressions, which can’t\nbe broken down further because they have no component parts. \nHume initially distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\ndegree of force and vivacity. Impressions are more\nforceful and vivacious than ideas. My impression of this ripe\ntomato’s bright red color is as vivid as anything could be. Last\nyear’s tomatoes were just as vivid when I was looking at them,\nbut now my idea of them is much less vivid than my impressions of the\ntomato in front of me. Since last year’s tomatoes were the same\ncolor, the difference can’t be that they are different shades of\nred; the difference must lie in the sharpness, clarity, and brightness\nof my impressions—their force and vivacity. At\nvarious times, Hume tries other ways of characterizing the difference\nbetween impressions and ideas, but he was never completely satisfied\nwith them. Still, what he says works well enough to give us a handle\non the felt differences between impressions and ideas. \nWhen Hume distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\nrelative force and vivacity, he is pointing out something that is\ngenerally true of them as a matter of fact. On occasion, in dreams or\na high fever, ideas may approach the force and vivacity of\nimpressions, but these are exceptions that prove\nthe—empirical—rule. In general, impressions and ideas are\nso different that no one can deny the distinction.  \nAlthough nothing seems freer than the power of thought, which\nisn’t “restrained within the limits of nature and\nreality” (EHU 2.4/18), Hume insists that our imagination is in\nfact “confined within very narrow limits”. We can separate\nand combine our ideas in new and even bizarre ways, imagining\ncreatures we’ve never seen or faraway galaxies, but all the\nmaterials of thinking are ultimately derived from our impressions.\nSince “all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of\nour impressions or more lively ones”; we are restricted to\n“compounding, transporting, augmenting, or diminishing the\nmaterials afforded us by the senses and experience” (EHU\n2.5/19).  \nIn the Treatise, Hume qualifies his claim that our ideas are\ncopies of our impressions, making clear that it applies only to the\nrelation between simple ideas and simple\nimpressions. He offers this “general proposition”,\nusually called the Copy Principle, as his “first\nprinciple … in the science of human nature”: \nAll our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv’d from\nsimple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they\nexactly represent. (T 1.1.1.7/4) \nHe presents the principle as something that everyone’s\nexperience confirms, but he also gives an argument to establish\nit. \nHe argues first that there is a one–to–one correspondence\nbetween simple ideas and simple impressions. He can’t\nprove that this correspondence holds universally, since he\ncan’t examine every individual impression and idea. But he is so\nconfident the correspondence holds that he challenges anyone who\ndoubts it to produce an example of a simple impression without a\ncorresponding simple idea, or a simple idea without a corresponding\nsimple impression. Since he is certain they will fail, he concludes\nthat there is a constant conjunction between simple\nimpressions and simple ideas. \nNext, he maintains that this constant conjunction is so universal that\nthe correspondence can’t be a matter of chance. There must be a\ncausal connection between them, but do ideas cause impressions or do\nimpressions cause ideas? \nFinally, he argues that experience tells us that simple impressions\nalways precede and thus cause their corresponding ideas. To support\nthis claim, he appeals to two sorts of cases. First, if you want to\ngive a child an idea of the taste of pineapple, you give her a piece\nof pineapple to eat. When you do, you are giving her an impression of\nthe pineapple’s taste. You never go the other way round. His\nother case involves a person born blind, who won’t have ideas of\ncolor because he won’t have impressions of color. \nThe Copy Principle is an empirical thesis, which he emphasizes by\noffering “one contradictory phenomenon” as an empirical\ncounterexample to the principle. He imagines someone who has had the\nsame sorts of experiences of colors most of us have had, but has never\nexperienced a certain shade of blue. Hume thinks that if he orders all\nthe shades of blue he has experienced from the darkest to the\nlightest, he will see immediately that there is a gap where the\nmissing shade should be. Then he asks \nWhether ‘tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to\n… raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade,\ntho’ it had never been convey’d to him by his senses? I\nbelieve there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may\nserve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always deriv’d\nfrom the correspondent impressions; tho’ the instance is so\nparticular and singular, that ‘tis scarce worth our observing,\nand does not merit that for it alone we shou’d alter our general\nmaxim. (T 1.1.1.10/6) \nHume repeats the case of the missing shade almost verbatim in the\nfirst Enquiry. While scholars have wondered exactly how the\nperson might supply the missing shade, he seems unconcerned with the\ndetails. For Hume, once again the exception proves\nthe—empirical—rule. \nAlthough Hume’s distinctive brand of empiricism is often\nidentified with his commitment to the Copy Principle, his use of the\nprinciple’s reverse in his account of definition is perhaps the\nmore innovative element of his system. \nAs his diagnosis of traditional metaphysics reveals, Hume believes\nthat \nthe chief obstacle … to our improvement in the moral or\nmetaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of\nthe terms. (EHU 7.1.2/61) \nConventional definitions—replacing terms with their\nsynonyms—merely replicate philosophical confusions and never\nbreak out of a narrow definitional circle. Getting clear about the\ncontent of the ideas and the meanings of the terms we are\ninvestigating requires something else. \nHume argues that we must “pass from words to the true and real\nsubject of the controversy”—ideas. He believes he has\nfound a way to accurately determine their content—his account of\ndefinition. He touts it as “a new microscope or species of\noptics”, predicting that it will produce equally dramatic\nresults in the moral sciences as its hardware\ncounterparts—telescopes and microscopes—have produced in\nnatural philosophy (EHU 7.1.4/62). \nHume’s account of definition uses a simple series of tests to\ndetermine cognitive content. Begin with a term. Ask what idea is\nannexed to it. If there is no such idea, then the term has no\ncognitive content, however prominently it figures in philosophy or\ntheology. If there is an idea annexed to the term, and it is complex,\nbreak it down into the simple ideas that compose it, and trace them\nback to their original impressions. If the process fails at any point,\nthe idea in question lacks cognitive content. When carried through\nsuccessfully, however, it yields a “just\ndefinition”—a precise account of the troublesome\nidea’s content. \nHume uses his account of definition in the critical phaseof\nhis project to show that many of the central concepts of traditional\nmetaphysics lack intelligible content. He also uses it in the\nconstructive phase to determine the exact meaning of our\nterms and ideas. \nAlthough we are capable of separating and combining our simple ideas\nas we please, there is, nevertheless, a regular order to our thoughts.\nIf ideas occurred to us completely randomly, so that all our thoughts\nwere “loose and unconnected”, we wouldn’t be able to\nthink coherently (T 1.1.4.1/10). This suggests that \nHume explains this “tie or union” in terms of the\nmind’s natural ability to associate certain ideas.\nAssociation is not “an inseparable connexion”, but rather\n“a gentle force, which commonly prevails”, by means of\nwhich one idea naturally introduces another (T 1.1.4.1/10). \nIn the first Enquiry, Hume says that even though it is\nobvious to everyone that our ideas are connected in this way, he is\nthe first philosopher who has “attempted to enumerate or class\nall the principles of association” (EHU 3.2/24). He regards his\nuse of these “universal principles” as so distinctive that\nhe advertises them as his most original contribution—one that\nentitles him call himself an “inventor” (Abstract\n35). \nHume identifies three principles of association: resemblance,\ncontiguity in time and place, and causation. When someone\nshows you a picture of your best friend, you naturally think of her\nbecause the picture resembles her. When you’re reminded\nof something that happened in the 1960s—miniskirts, for\nexample—you may think of the Vietnam War, because they are\ntemporally contiguous. Thinking of Sausalito may lead you to\nthink of the Golden Gate Bridge, which may lead you to think of San\nFrancisco, since they are spatially contiguous.\nCausality works both from cause to effect and effect to\ncause: meeting someone’s father may make you think of his son;\nencountering the son may lead you to thoughts of his father.  \nOf the three associative principles, causation is the\nstrongest, and the only one that takes us “beyond our\nsenses” (T 1.3.2.3/74). It establishes links between our present\nand past experiences and our expectations about the future, so that\n“all reasonings concerning matters of fact seem to be founded on\nthe relation of Cause and Effect” (EHU\n4.1.4/26). Taking aspirin in the past has relieved my headaches, so I\nexpect that the aspirin I just took will soon relieve my present\nheadache. Hume also makes clear that causation is the least understood\nof the associative principles, but he tells us, “we shall have\noccasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom” (T\n1.1.4.2/11). \nLike gravitational attraction, the associative principles are\noriginal, and so can’t be explained further. Although\nthe associative principles’ “effects are everywhere\nconspicuous” their causes “are mostly unknown, and must be\nresolv’d into original qualities of human nature, which\nI pretend not to explain”. Accordingly, we should curb any\n“intemperate desire” to account further for them, for\ndoing so would take us illegitimately beyond the bounds of experience\n(T 1.1.4.6/12–13). \nHume doesn’t try to explain why we associate ideas as\nwe do. He is interested only in establishing that, as a matter of\nfact, we do associate ideas in these ways. Given that his\nclaim that the associative principles explain the important operations\nof the mind is an empirical one, he must admit, as he does in the\nfirst Enquiry, that he cannot prove conclusively that his\nlist of associative principles is complete. Perhaps he has overlooked\nsome additional principle. We are free to examine our own thoughts to\ndetermine whether resemblance, contiguity, and causation successfully\nexplain them. The more instances the associative principles explain,\nthe more assurance we have that Hume has identified the basic\nprinciples by which our minds work. \nIn the Abstract, Hume concludes that it should be “easy\nto conceive of what vast consequences these principles must be in the\nscience of human nature”. Since they “are the only ties of\nour thoughts, they are really to us the cement of the\nuniverse, and all the operations of the mind must, in great measure,\ndepend on them” (Abstract 35). Just what these “vast\nconsequences” are will become clear when we examine Hume’s\nrevolutionary accounts of our causal inferences and moral\njudgments. \nThe medieval synthesis Thomas Aquinas (1224–74) forged between\nChristian theology and Aristotle’s science and metaphysics set\nthe terms for the early modern causation debate. Aristotle\n(384–322 BCE) drew an absolute categorical distinction between\nscientific knowledge (scientia) and belief (opinio).\nScientific knowledge was knowledge of causes and scientific\nexplanation consisted in demonstration—proving the\nnecessary connection between a cause and its effect from\nintuitively obvious premises independently of experience. \nModern philosophers thought of themselves as scientific\nrevolutionaries because they rejected Aristotle’s account of\ncausation. Even so, they accepted his distinction between knowledge\nand belief, and regarded causal inference as an exercise of reason,\nwhich aimed at demonstrating the necessary connection between cause\nand effect. Malebranche (1638–1715), and others following\nDescartes (1596–1650), were optimistic about the possibility of\ndemonstrative scientific knowledge, while those in the British\nexperimental tradition were more pessimistic. Locke was sufficiently\nsceptical about what knowledge we can attain that he constructed one\nof the first accounts of probable inference to show that belief can\nmeet standards of rationality that make experimental natural\nphilosophy intellectually respectable. \nWhen Hume enters the debate, he translates the traditional distinction\nbetween knowledge and belief into his own terms, dividing “all\nthe objects of human reason or enquiry” into two exclusive and\nexhaustive categories: relations of ideas and matters of\nfact.  \nPropositions concerning relations of ideas are intuitively or\ndemonstratively certain. They are known a\npriori—discoverable independently of experience by\n“the mere operation of thought”, so their truth\ndoesn’t depend on anything actually existing (EHU 4.1.1/25).\nThat the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle sum to 180\ndegrees is true whether or not there are any Euclidean triangles\nto be found in nature. Denying that proposition is a contradiction,\njust as it is contradictory to say that 8×7=57. \nIn sharp contrast, the truth of propositions concerning matters of\nfact depends on the way the world is. Their contraries are always\npossible, their denials never imply contradictions, and they\ncan’t be established by demonstration. Asserting that Miami\nis north of Boston is false, but not contradictory. We can\nunderstand what someone who asserts this is saying, even if we are\npuzzled about how he could have the facts so wrong. \nThe distinction between relations of ideas and matters of\nfact is often called “Hume’s Fork”, generally\nwith the negative implication that Hume may be illicitly ruling out\nmeaningful propositions that don’t fit into these two categories\nor fit into both of them. To defuse this objection, however, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that Hume’s categories are his\ntranslations of a traditional absolute categorical classificatory\ndistinction, which all his contemporaries and immediate predecessors\naccepted.  \nHume’s method dictates his strategy in the causation debate. In\nthe critical phase, he argues that his predecessors were\nwrong: our causal inferences aren’t determined by “reason\nor any other operation of the understanding” (EHU 5.1.2/41). In\nthe constructive phase, he supplies an alternative: the\nassociative principles are their basis. \nHume’s contributions to the critical phase of the\ncausation debate are contained in Treatise 1.3.6 and Section\n4 of the first Enquiry, appropriately titled “Sceptical\ndoubts concerning the operations of the understanding”. The\nconstructive phase in his Enquiry account is the\nfollowing section, also appropriately titled “Sceptical solution\nof these doubts”, while the corresponding sections of the\nTreatise stretch from 1.3.7 through 1.3.10.  \nCausal inferences are the only way we can go beyond the evidence of\nour senses and memories. In making them, we suppose there is some\nconnection between present facts and what we infer from them.\nBut what is this connection? How is it established? \nIf the connection is established by an operation of reason or the\nunderstanding, it must concern either relations of ideas or\nmatters of fact. \nHume argues that the connection can’t involve relations of\nideas. Effects are different events from their causes, so there is no\ncontradiction in conceiving of a cause occurring, and its usual effect\nnot occurring. Ordinary causal judgments are so familiar that we tend\nto overlook this; they seem immediate and intuitive. But suppose you\nwere suddenly brought into the world as an adult, armed with the\nintellectual firepower of an Einstein. Could you, simply by examining\nan aspirin tablet, determine that it will relieve your headache? \nWhen we reason a priori, we consider the idea of the object\nwe regard as a cause independently of any observations we have made of\nit. It can’t include the idea of any other distinct\nobject, including the object we take to be its usual effect. But then\nit can’t show us any “inseparable and inviolable\nconnection”—any necessary\nconnection—between those ideas. Trying to reason a\npriori from your idea of an aspirin, without including any\ninformation you have of its effects from your previous experience,\nyields only your simple ideas of its “sensible\nqualities”—its size, shape, weight, color, smell, and\ntaste. It gives you no idea of what “secret powers” it\nmight have to produce its usual effects. Hume concludes that a\npriori reasoning can’t be the source of the connection\nbetween our ideas of a cause and its effect. Contrary to what the\nmajority of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors thought,\ncausal inferences do not concern relations of ideas. \nHume now moves to the only remaining possibility. If causal inferences\ndon’t involve a priori reasoning about relations of\nideas, they must concern matters of fact and experience. When\nwe’ve had many experiences of one kind of event constantly\nconjoined with another, we begin to think of them as cause and effect\nand infer the one from the other. But even after we’ve had many\nexperiences of a cause conjoined with its effect, our inferences\naren’t determined by reason or any other operation of the\nunderstanding. \nIn the past, taking aspirin has relieved my headaches, so I believe\nthat taking aspirin will relieve the headache I’m having now.\nBut my inference is based on the aspirin’s superficial sensible\nqualities, which have nothing to do with headache relief. Even if I\nassume that the aspirin has “secret powers” that are doing\nthe heavy lifting in relieving my headache, they can’t be the\nbasis of my inference, since these “secret powers” are\nunknown. \nNonetheless, Hume observes, “we always presume, when we see like\nsensible qualities, that they have like secret powers, and expect that\neffects, similar to those we have experienced, will follow from\nthem” (EHU 4.2.16/33). Since we neither intuit nor infer a\npriori that similar objects have similar secret powers, our\npresumption must be based in some way on our experience. \nBut our past experience only gives us information about objects as\nthey were when we experienced them, and our present experience only\ntells us about objects we are experiencing now. Causal inferences,\nhowever, do not just record our past and present experiences.\nThey extend or project what we have gathered from\nexperience to other objects in the future. Since it is not necessarily\ntrue that an object with the same sensible qualities will have the\nsame secret powers that past objects with those sensible qualities\nhad, how do we project those experiences into the future, to other\nobjects that may only appear similar to those we’ve previously\nexperienced? \nHume thinks we can get a handle on this question by considering two\nclearly different propositions: \nand \nThere is no question that “the one proposition may be justly\ninferred from the other”, and that “it is always\ninferred”. But since their connection obviously isn’t\nintuitive, Hume challenges us to produce the “chain of\nreasoning” that takes us from propositions like (1) to\npropositions like (2) (EHU 4.2.16/34). \n(1) summarizes my past experience, while (2) predicts what will happen\nin the immediate future. The chain of reasoning I need must show me\nhow my past experience is relevant to my future experience. I need\nsome further proposition or propositions that will establish an\nappropriate link or connection between past and\nfuture, and take me from (1) to (2) using either demonstrative\nreasoning, concerning relations of ideas, or probable\nreasoning, concerning matters of fact. \nHume thinks it is evident that demonstrative reasoning can’t\nbridge the gap between (1) and (2). However unlikely it may be, we can\nalways intelligibly conceive of a change in the course of nature. Even\nthough aspirin relieved my previous headaches, there’s no\ncontradiction in supposing that it won’t relieve the one\nI’m having now, so the supposition of a change in the course of\nnature can’t be proven false by any reasoning concerning\nrelations of ideas. \nThat leaves probable reasoning. Hume argues that there is no probable\nreasoning that can provide a just inference from past to future. Any\nattempt to infer (2) from (1) by a probable inference will be\nviciously circular—it will involve supposing what we are trying\nto prove. \nHume spells out the circularity this way. Any reasoning that takes us\nfrom (1) to (2) must employ some connecting principle that\nconnects the past with the future. Since one thing that keeps us from\nmoving directly from past to future is the possibility that the course\nof nature might change, it seems plausible to think that the\nconnecting principle we need will be one that will assure us that\nnature is uniform—that the course of nature won’t\nchange—something like this uniformity principle: \nAdopting [UP] will indeed allow us to go from (1) to (2). But before\nwe can use it to establish that our causal inferences are determined\nby reason, we need to determine our basis for adopting it. [UP] is\nclearly not intuitive, nor is it demonstrable, as\nHume has already pointed out, so only probable arguments\ncould establish it. But to attempt to establish [UP] this way would be\nto try to establish probable arguments using probable arguments, which\nwill eventually include [UP] itself. \nAt this point, Hume has exhausted the ways reason might establish a\nconnection between cause and effect. He assures us that he offers his\n“sceptical doubts” not as a “discouragement, but\nrather an incitement … to attempt something more full and\nsatisfactory”. Having cleared the way for his constructive\naccount, Hume is ready to do just that. \nHume calls his constructive account of causal inference a\n“sceptical solution” to the “sceptical doubts”\nhe raised in the critical phase of his argument. \nSince we’re determined—caused—to make\ncausal inferences, then if they aren’t “determin’d\nby reason”, there must be “some principle of equal weight\nand authority” that leads us to make them. Hume maintains that\nthis principle is custom or habit: \nwhenever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation … we always say,\nthat this propensity is the effect of Custom. (EHU\n5.1.5/43) \nIt is therefore custom, not reason, which “determines the mind\n… to suppose the future conformable to the past”\n(Abstract 16). But even though we have located the principle, it is\nimportant to see that this isn’t a new principle by\nwhich our minds operate. Custom and habit are\ngeneral names for the principles of association. \nHume describes their operation as a causal process: custom or habit is\nthe cause of the particular propensity you form after your repeated\nexperiences of the constant conjunction of smoke and fire. Causation\nis the operative associative principle here, since it is the only one\nof those principles that can take us beyond our senses and\nmemories. \nHume concludes that custom alone “makes us expect for the\nfuture, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in\nthe past” (EHU 5.1.6/44). Custom thus turns out to be the source\nof the Uniformity Principle—the belief that the future\nwill be like the past. \nCausal inference leads us not only to conceive of the effect,\nbut also to expect it. When I expect that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache, I’m not just abstractly considering the\nidea of headache relief, I believe that aspirin will relieve\nit. What more is involved in believing that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache than in merely conceiving that it\nwill? \nIt can’t be that beliefs have some additional idea—the\nidea of belief, perhaps—that conceptions lack. If there were\nsome such idea, given our ability to freely combine ideas, we could,\nby simply willing, add that idea to any conception whatsoever, and\nbelieve anything we like. \nHume concludes that belief must be some sentiment or feeling aroused\nin us independently of our wills, which accompanies those ideas that\nconstitute them. It is a particular way or manner of conceiving an\nidea that is generated by the circumstances in which we find\nourselves. \nIf constant conjunctions were all that is involved, my thoughts about\naspirin and headaches would only be hypothetical. For belief, one of\nthe conjoined objects must be present to my senses or memories; I must\nbe taking, or just have taken, an aspirin. In these circumstances,\nbelieving that my headache will soon be relieved is as unavoidable as\nfeeling affection for a close friend, or anger when someone harms us.\n“All these operations are species of natural instincts, which no\nreasoning … is able either to produce or prevent” (EHU\n5.1.8/46–47). \nWhile Hume thinks that defining this sentiment may be\nimpossible, we can describe belief, if only by analogy,\nalthough he was never completely satisfied with his attempts to do so.\nBelief is a livelier, firmer, more vivid, steady, and intense\nconception of an object. Hume intends these characterizations to go\nbeyond merely recording intensity of feeling to capture how belief \nrenders realities … more present to us than fictions, causes\nthem to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence\non the passions and imagination. (EHU 5.2.12/49) \nBut how does an idea come to be conceived in such a manner that it\nconstitutes a belief? \nHume’s explanation is that as I become accustomed to\naspirin’s relieving my headaches, I develop a propensity—a\ntendency—to expect headache relief to follow taking aspirin. The\npropensity is due to the associative bond that my repeated experiences\nof taking aspirin and headache relief have formed. My present\nimpressions of taking an aspirin are as forceful and vivid as anything\ncould be, and some of their force and vivacity transfers across the\nassociative path to the idea of headache relief, enlivening it with\nenough force and vivacity to give it the “strength and\nsolidity” that constitutes belief. \nSince I don’t know how aspirin relieves headaches, it is\nfortunate that there is “a kind of pre-established harmony\nbetween the course of nature and the succession of our ideas”\nthat teaches me to take aspirin when I have a headache. Custom, Hume\nmaintains, in language that anticipates and influenced Darwin, \nis that principle by which this correspondence has been effected; so\nnecessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our\nconduct, in every circumstance of human life. (EHU 5.2.21/55) \nIt is far better, Hume concludes, to rely on “the ordinary\nwisdom of nature”, which ensures that we form beliefs “by\nsome instinct or mechanical tendency”, rather than trusting it\nto “the fallacious deductions of our reason” (EHU\n5.2.22/55). \nIn keeping with his project of providing a naturalistic account of how\nour minds work, Hume has given empirical explanations of our\npropensity to make causal inferences, and the way those inferences\nlead to belief. \nThe early modern causation debate revolved around a family of\n“nearly synonymous” key ideas, the most prominent of which\nwere the ideas of power and necessary connection.\nFor Hume, “there are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more\nobscure and uncertain”. He showcases the critical and\nconstructive uses of his account of definition as he attempts\n“to fix … the precise meaning of these terms”, in\norder to “remove some part of that obscurity, which is so much\ncomplained of in this species of philosophy” (EHU\n7.1.3/61–62). \nTo get clear about the idea of power or necessary connection, we need\nto determine the impressions that are its source. Hume identifies\nthree possible sources in the work of his predecessors: Locke thought\nwe get our idea of power secondarily from external\nimpressions of the interactions of physical objects, and\nprimarily from internal impressions of our ability to move\nour bodies and to consider ideas. Malebranche argued that what we take\nto be causes of the motion of bodies or mental activity aren’t\ncauses at all. They are only occasions for God, the sole\nsource of necessary connection, to act in the world. Hume rejects all\nthree possibilities. \nHe argues that external impressions of the interactions of\nbodies can’t give rise to our idea of power. When we see that\nthe motion of one billiard ball follows another, we’re only\nobserving their conjunction, never their\nconnection. \nAttending to internal impressions of the operations of our\nminds doesn’t help. Although voluntary bodily movements follow\nour willing that those movements occur, this is a matter of fact I\nlearn through experience, not from some internal impression of my\nwill’s power. When I decide to type, my fingers move over the\nkeyboard. When I decide to stop, they stop, but I have no idea how\nthis happens. Were I aware of the power of my will to move my fingers,\nI’d know both how it worked and its limits. \nOur ability to control our thoughts doesn’t give us an\nimpression of power, either. We don’t have a clue about how we\ncall up our ideas. Our command over them is limited and varies from\ntime to time. We learn about these limitations and variations only\nthrough experience, but the mechanisms by which they operate are\nunknown and incomprehensible to us. If I decide to think about\nIstanbul, my idea of that city comes to mind, but I experience only\nthe succession of my decision followed by the idea’s appearance,\nnever the power itself. \nWhen ordinary people can’t determine an event’s cause,\nthey attribute it to some “invisible intelligent\nprinciple”. Malebranche and other occasionalists do the same,\nexcept they apply it across the board. True causes aren’t\npowers in the physical world or in human minds. The only true cause is\nGod’s willing that certain objects should always be conjoined\nwith certain others. \nAnyone aware of our minds’ narrow limits should realize that\nMalebranche’s theory takes us into\n“fairyland”—it goes so far beyond our experience\nthat we have no way of intelligibly assessing it. It also capitalizes\non how little we know about the interactions of bodies, but since our\nidea of God is based on extrapolations from our faculties, our\nignorance should also apply to him. \nSince we’ve canvassed the leading contenders for the source of\nour idea of necessary connection and found them wanting, it might\nseem as if we have no such idea, but that would be too hasty.\nIn our discussion of causal inference, we saw that when we find that\none kind of event is constantly conjoined with another, we begin to\nexpect the one to occur when the other does. We suppose there’s\nsome connection between them, and don’t hesitate to call the\nfirst, the cause, and the second, the effect. We\nalso saw that there’s nothing different in the repetition of\nconstantly conjoined cases from the exactly similar single case,\nexcept that after we’ve experienced their constant\nconjunction, habit determines us to expect the effect when the cause\noccurs. \nHume concludes that it is just this felt determination of the\nmind—our awareness of this customary transition from one\nassociated object to another—that is the source of our idea of\nnecessary connection. When we say that one object is necessarily\nconnected with another, we really mean that the objects have acquired\nan associative connection in our thought that gives rise to this\ninference.  \nHaving located the missing ingredient, Hume is ready to offer a\ndefinition of cause. In fact, he gives us two. The first, \nA cause is an object, followed by another, where all the objects\nsimilar to the first are followed by objects similar to the\nsecond, \ngives the relevant external impressions, while the\nsecond, \nA cause is an object followed by another, and whose appearance always\nconveys the thought to the other, \ncaptures the internal impression—our awareness of being\ndetermined by custom to move from cause to effect. Both are\ndefinitions on Hume’s account, but his “just\ndefinition” of our idea of cause is the conjunction of the two\n(EHU 7.2.29/76–77). Only together do they capture all\nthe relevant impressions involved. \nHume locates the source of the idea of necessary connection in\nus, not in the objects themselves or even in our ideas of those\nobjects we regard as causes and effects. In doing so, he completely\nchanges the course of the causation debate, reversing what everyone\nelse thought about the idea of necessary connection. Subsequent\ndiscussions of causation must confront the challenges Hume poses for\ntraditional, more metaphysical, ways of looking at our idea of\ncausation. \nHume’s treatment of our idea of causation is his flagship\nillustration of how his method works and the revolutionary results it\ncan achieve. He goes on to apply both his method, and its concrete\nresults, to other prominent debates in the modern period, including\nprobable inference, testimony for miracles, free will, and intelligent\ndesign. \nHume’s explanation of morality is an important part of his\nefforts to reform philosophy. He takes his primary task to be an\ninvestigation into the origin of the basic moral ideas, which he\nassumes are the ideas of moral goodness and badness. As with the idea\nof cause and necessary connection, he wants to explain moral ideas as\neconomically as possible in terms of their “simplest and fewest\ncauses”. Determining their causes will determine what their\ncontent is—what we mean by them. His secondary concern is to\nestablish what character traits and motives are morally good and\nbad. \nHume follows his sentimentalist predecessor, Francis Hutcheson\n(1694–1746), in building his moral theory around the idea of a\nspectator who approves or disapproves of people’s character\ntraits and motives. The sentiments of approval and disapproval are the\nsource of our moral ideas of goodness and badness. To evaluate a\ncharacter trait as morally good is to evaluate it as virtuous; to\nevaluate it as morally bad is to evaluate it as vicious. \nAs he did in the causation debate, Hume steps into an ongoing debate\nabout ethics, often called the British Moralists debate, which began\nin the mid-seventeenth century and continued until the end of the\neighteenth. He uses the same method here as he did in the causation\ndebate: there is a critical phase in which he argues against\nhis opponents, and a constructive phase in which he\ndevelops his version of sentimentalism. Hume has two sets of\nopponents: the self-love theorists and the moral rationalists. He\nbecame the most famous proponent of sentimentalism. \nThomas Hobbes’ (1588–1679) radical attempt to derive moral\nand political obligation from motives of self-interest initiated the\nBritish Moralists debate. Hobbes, as his contemporaries understood\nhim, characterizes us as naturally self-centered and power-hungry,\nconcerned above all with our own preservation. In the state of nature,\na pre-moral and pre-legal condition, we seek to preserve ourselves by\ntrying to dominate others. Since we are all sufficiently\n“equal” in power, this results in a state of “war of\nall against all” in which life is “nasty, brutish, and\nshort” (Leviathan, Ch. 13).  The way out is to make a\ncompact with one another. We agree to hand over our power and freedom\nto a sovereign, who makes the laws necessary for us to live together\npeacefully and has the power to enforce them. While acting morally\nrequires that we comply with the laws the sovereign establishes, the\nbasis of morality is self-interest. \nBernard Mandeville’s (1670–1733) The Fable of the\nBees served to reinforce this reading of Hobbes during the early\n18th century. According to Mandeville, human beings are\nnaturally selfish, headstrong, and unruly. Some clever politicians,\nrecognizing that we would be better off living together in a civilized\nsociety, took up the task of domesticating us. Realizing that we are\nproud creatures, highly susceptible to flattery, they were able to\ndupe many of us to live up to the ideal of virtue—conquering our\nselfish passions and helping others—by dispensing praise and\nblame. Moral concepts are just tools clever politicians used to tame\nus. \nTwo kinds of moral theories developed in reaction first to Hobbes and\nthen to Mandeville—rationalism and sentimentalism. The\nrationalists oppose Hobbes’ claim that there is no right or\nwrong in the state of nature, that rightness or wrongness is\ndetermined by the sovereign’s will, and that morality requires\nsanctions to motivate us. The sentimentalists object to Hobbes’\nand Mandeville’s “selfish” conceptions of human\nnature and morality. By the mid–eighteenth century, rationalists\nand sentimentalists were arguing not only against Hobbes and\nMandeville, but also with each other. \nHume opposes both selfish and rationalist accounts of morality, but he\ncriticizes them in different works. In the Treatise, Hume\nassumes that Hobbes’ theory is no longer a viable option, so\nthat there are only two possibilities to consider. Either moral\nconcepts spring from reason, in which case rationalism is correct, or\nfrom sentiment, in which case sentimentalism is correct. If one falls,\nthe other stands. In the second Enquiry, Hume continues to\noppose moral rationalism, but his arguments against them\nappear in an appendix. More importantly, he drops the assumption he\nmade in the Treatise and takes the selfish theories of Hobbes\nand Mandeville as his primary target. Once again, he thinks there are\nonly two possibilities. Either our approval is based in self-interest\nor it has a disinterested basis. The refutation of one is proof of the\nother. \nHume thinks that “systems and hypotheses” have also\n“perverted our natural understanding” of morality. The\nviews of the moral rationalists—Samuel Clarke (1675–1729),\nLocke and William Wollaston (1660–1724)—are prominent\namong them. One distinctive, but unhealthy, aspect of modern moral\nphilosophy, Hume believes, is that it allies itself with religion and\nthus sees itself as serving the interests of “popular\nsuperstition”. Clarke’s theory and those of the other\nrationalists epitomize this tendency. \nClarke, Hume’s central rationalist opponent, appeals to reason\nto explain almost every aspect of morality. He believes that there are\ndemonstrable moral relations of fitness and unfitness that we discover\na priori by means of reason alone. Gratitude, for example, is\na fitting or suitable response to kindness, while ingratitude is an\nunfitting or unsuitable response. He believes that the rational\nintuition that an action is fitting has the power both to obligate us\nand to move us. To act morally is to act rationally. \nHume’s most famous and most important objection to moral\nrationalism is two-pronged. In Treatise 2.3.3, “Of the\ninfluencing motives of the will”, he rejects the rationalist\nideal of the good person as someone whose passions and actions are\ngoverned by reason. In T 3.1.1, he uses these arguments to show that\nmoral ideas do not spring from reason alone. \nIn the first prong of his objection, Hume begins by remarking that\nnothing is more common than for philosophers, as well as ordinary\npeople, to talk about the “combat” between reason and\npassion. They say we ought to be governed by reason rather than\npassion, and if our passions are not in line with reason’s\ncommands, we ought to restrain them or bring them into conformity with\nreason. Hume counters that “reason alone can never be a motive\nto any action of the will” and that by itself it can never\noppose a passion in the direction of the will. \nHis first argument rests on his empiricist conception of reason. As we\nsaw in his account of causation, demonstrative reasoning consists in\ncomparing ideas to find relations among them, while probable reasoning\nconcerns matters of fact. He considers mathematical reasoning from the\nrelation of ideas category and causal reasoning from the category of\nmatters of fact. He asks us to look at instances of actions where\nthese two types of reasoning are relevant and says that when we do, we\nwill see that reason alone couldn’t have moved us. \nNo one thinks that mathematical reasoning by itself is capable of\nmoving us. Suppose you want to stay out of debt. This may move you to\ncalculate how much money comes in and how much goes out, but\nmathematical reasoning by itself does not move us to do anything.\nMathematical reasoning, when it bears on action, is always used in\nconnection with achieving some purpose and thus in connection with\ncausal reasoning. \nHume, however, argues that when causal reasoning figures in the\nproduction of action, it always presupposes an existing desire or\nwant. On his view, reasoning is a process that moves you from one idea\nto another. If reasoning is to have motivational force, one of the\nideas must be tied to some desire or affection. As he says, \nIt can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are\ncauses, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects are\nindifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us,\ntheir connexion can never give them any influence; and ‘tis\nplain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion,\nit cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us (T\n2.3.3.3/414). \nNoticing a causal connection between exercise and losing weight will\nnot move you to exercise, unless you want to lose weight. \nIt immediately follows that reason alone cannot oppose a passion in\nthe direction of the will. To oppose a passion, reason must be able to\ngive rise to a motive by itself, since only a motive can oppose\nanother motive, but he has just shown that reason by itself is unable\nto do this. \nHaving exposed reason’s pretensions to rule, Hume inverts the\nrationalist’s ideal of the good person, and concludes that\n“Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and\ncan never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem” (T 2.3.3.4/415). \nThe second prong of Hume’s objection, the argument from\nmotivation, is directed primarily against Clarke and concerns the\nsource of our moral concepts: either they spring from reason or from\nsentiment. Couching this debate in terms of his own version of the\ntheory of ideas, he reminds us that to engage in any sort of mental\nactivity is to have a perception before the mind, so “to approve\nof one character, to condemn another, are only so many different\nperceptions” (T 3.1.1.2/456). Since there are only two types of\nperception—ideas and impressions—the question between\nrationalism and sentimentalism is \nWhether ’tis by means of our ideas or impressions we\ndistinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable\nor praise-worthy?  (T 3.1.1.3/456) \nThe argument from motivation has only two premises. The first is that\nmoral ideas have pervasive practical effects. Experience shows that we\nare often motivated to perform an action because we think it is\nobligatory or to refrain because we think it is unjust. We try to\ncultivate the virtues in ourselves and are proud when we succeed and\nashamed when we fail. If morality did not have these effects on our\npassions and actions, moral rules and precepts would be pointless, as\nwould our efforts to be virtuous. Thus “morals excite passions,\nand produce or prevent actions” (T 3.1.1.6/457). \nThe second premise is that by itself reason is incapable of exciting\npassions or producing and preventing actions, which Hume supports with\nthe arguments we just looked at about the influencing motives of the\nwill. The argument from motivation, then, is that if moral concepts\nare capable of exciting passions and producing or preventing actions,\nbut reason alone is incapable of doing these things, then moral\nconcepts can’t spring from reason alone. \nReason for Hume is essentially passive and inert: it is incapable by\nitself of giving rise to new motives or new ideas. Although he thinks\nthe argument from motivation is decisive, in T 3.1.1 he offers a\nbattery of additional arguments, which are intended to show that moral\nconcepts do not arise from reason alone. \nHume takes the defeat of rationalism to entail that moral concepts\nspring from sentiment. Of course, he was not the first to claim that\nmoral ideas arise from sentiment. Hutcheson claimed that we possess,\nin addition to our external senses, a special moral sense that\ndisposes us to respond to benevolence with the distinctive feelings of\napprobation. Hume, however, rejects the idea that the moral sentiments\narise from a sense that is an “original quality”\nand part of our “primary constitution”. \nHe first argues that there are many different types of virtue, not all\nof which are types of benevolence—respecting people’s\nproperty rights, keeping promises, courageousness, and\nindustriousness—as Hutcheson maintained. If we agree with Hume,\nbut keep Hutcheson’s idea of a moral sense, we would have to\nbelieve that we have many different “original” senses,\nwhich dispose us to approve of the variety of different virtues\nseparately. But he complains that this is not only highly implausible,\nbut also contrary to the \nusual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles\nproduce all the variety we observe in the universe. (T 3.1.2.6/473)\n \nInstead of multiplying senses, we should look for a few general\nprinciples to explain our approval of the different virtues. \nThe real problem, however, is that Hutcheson just\nclaims—hypothesizes—that we possess a unique, original\nmoral sense. If asked why we have a moral sense, his reply is that God\nimplanted it in us. Although in his critical phase Hume freely borrows\nmany of Hutcheson’s arguments to criticize moral rationalism,\nhis rejection of a God-given moral sense puts him on a radically\ndifferent path from Hutcheson in his constructive phase. One way of\nunderstanding Hume’s project is to see it as an attempt to\nnaturalize Hutcheson’s moral sense theory. He aims to provide a\nwholly naturalistic and economical explanation of how we come to\nexperience the moral sentiments that also explains why we approve of\nthe different virtues. In the course of explaining the moral\nsentiments, Hutcheson’s idea of an original moral sense\ndisappears from Hume’s account of morality. \nIn Treatise 3.3.1, Hume turns to his constructive task of\nproviding a naturalistic explanation of the moral sentiments. He\nrefers to them as feelings of approval or disapproval, praise or\nblame, esteem or contempt. Approval is a kind of pleasant or agreeable\nfeeling; disapproval a kind of painful or disagreeable feeling. In\nseveral key passages, he describes the moral sentiments as calm forms\nof love and hatred. When we evaluate our own character traits, pride\nand humility replace love and hatred. \nHume’s project is “to discover the true origin of morals,\nand of that love or hatred, which arises” (T 3.3.1/575) when we\ncontemplate our own or other people’s character traits and\nmotives. He traces the moral sentiments to sympathy. Sympathy\nis a psychological mechanism that explains how we come to feel what\nothers are feeling. It is not itself a feeling or sentiment and so\nshould not be confused with feelings of compassion or pity. Hume\nappeals to sympathy to explain a wide range of phenomena: our interest\nin history and current affairs, our ability to enjoy literature,\nmovies, and novels, as well as our sociability. It is central to his\nexplanations of our passions, our sense of beauty, and our sense of\nwhat is morally good and bad. \nSympathy is a process that moves me from my idea of what someone is\nfeeling to actually experiencing the feeling. There are four steps to\nthis process. I first arrive at the idea of what someone is feeling in\nany of the usual ways. I next become aware of the\nresemblances between us, so we are linked by that principle\nof association. While we resemble every human being to some extent, we\nalso resemble some individuals more than others—for instance,\nthose who share our language or culture or are the same age and sex as\nwe are. The associative principles of contiguity and\ncausality also relate individuals who are located closely to\nus in time or space or who are family members or teachers. According\nto Hume, we are able to sympathize more easily and strongly with\nindividuals with whom we have strong associative ties. The stronger\nthe associative relations, the stronger our sympathetic responses.\nHume then claims—controversially—that we always have a\nvivid awareness of ourselves. Finally, he reminds us that the\nprinciples of association not only relate two perceptions, but they\nalso transmit force and vivacity from one perception to another. \nSuppose my friend recently suffered a devastating loss and I realize\nshe is feeling sad. The associative principles transmit force and\nvivacity from my vivid awareness of myself to my idea of my\nfriend’s sadness. Since for Hume the difference between\nimpressions and ideas is that impressions are more lively and\nvivacious than ideas, if an idea of a passion is sufficiently\nenlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. I now feel sad too, but\nnot quite as strongly as my friend. \nThe way Hume uses the idea that the associative principles transmit\nforce and vivacity in his explanation of sympathy is parallel to the\nway he uses it in his explanation of causal inference. In the case of\ncausal inference, if we have an impression of an effect (smoke), the\nassociative principles give rise not only to the idea of its cause\n(fire), but they also transmit some of the impression’s force\nand vivacity to the idea of its cause, so that we come to believe that\nfire is the cause of the smoke. A belief is an idea that is so lively\nthat it is like an impression, and influences us in the way\nimpressions do. Similarly, my lively awareness of myself enlivens by\nassociation my idea of my friend’s sadness. But the result in\nthe case of sympathy is even stronger: when an idea of a passion is\nsufficiently enlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. \nOne advantage Hume’s explanation of the moral sentiments in\nterms of sympathy has over Hutcheson’s claim that we possess a\nGod-given moral sense is that it enables him to provide a unified\ntheory of the mind. He explains the moral sentiments by appealing to\nsympathy, which, in turn, he explains in terms of the same associative\nprinciples he invoked to explain causal beliefs. Without sympathy, and\nthe associative principles that explain it, we would be\nunimaginably different than we are—creatures without causal\nor moral ideas. \nHume develops his account of moral evaluation further in response to\ntwo objections to his claim that the moral sentiments arise from\nsympathy. The first is the “sympathy is variable”\nobjection. Sympathy enables us to enter into the feelings of anyone,\neven strangers, because we resemble everyone to some extent. But it is\nan essential feature of his account of the natural and spontaneous\noperation of sympathy that our ability to respond sympathetically to\nothers varies with variations in the associative relations. I am able\nto sympathize more easily and strongly with someone who resembles me\nor is related to me by contiguity or causation. The objection is that\nthe moral sentiments can’t be based in sympathy because the\nloves and hatreds that result from the natural and spontaneous\nworkings of sympathy vary, but our moral approval doesn’t vary.\nThe second objection is that “virtue in rags” still evokes\nour approval. Sympathy works by looking at the actual effects of a\nperson’s character traits, but sometimes misfortune or lack of\nopportunity may prevent an individual from exercising their good\ncharacter traits, yet we still admire them. \nHume argues that moral love and hatred spring from sympathy, but only\nwhen we regulate our sympathetic reactions by taking up what he calls\n“the general point of view”. There are two regulatory\nfeatures to the general point of view. The first is that we survey a\nperson’s character from the perspective of the person and his\nusual associates—friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers. We\nsympathize with the person and the people with whom that person\nregularly interacts and judge character traits in terms of whether\nthey are good or bad for these people. Second, we regulate sympathy\nfurther by relying on general rules that specify the general effects\nand tendencies of character traits rather than sympathizing with their\nactual effects. \nBy putting together these two regulatory features, we arrive at\nHume’s idea of the general point of view, which defines a\nperspective from which we may survey a person’s character traits\nthat we share with everyone. When we occupy the general point of view,\nwe sympathize with the person herself and her usual associates, and\ncome to admire the person for traits that are normally good for\neveryone. The general point of view is, for Hume, the moral\nperspective. We do not experience the moral sentiments unless we have\nalready taken up the general point of view. The moral sentiments and\nthe concepts to which they give rise are products of taking up that\nstandpoint. \nHume offers the claim that we admire four sorts of character\ntraits—those that are useful or immediately agreeable to the\nagent or to others—as an empirical hypothesis. While he provides\nsupport for it in his discussion of the individual virtues, he also\nuses his fourfold classification to undermine Christian conceptions of\nmorality. He makes pride a virtue and humility a vice. He throws out\nthe “monkish” virtues—celibacy, fasting, and\npenance—on the grounds that they are not pleasant or useful to\nanyone. He also rejects the distinction between virtues and natural\ntalents, which legislators, “divines” and modern moralists\ndefend by claiming that the moral virtues are voluntary, whereas\nnatural talents aren’t. Their goal is to reform us—or at\nleast our outward behavior—making us better, when understood in\nChristian terms. They accordingly restrict the domain of the moral to\nactions that proceed from character traits because they believe only\nthey can be modified, shaped, and controlled by sanctions, while\ntalents can’t. Hume, however, rejects the distinction along with\nthe dubious function these reformers assign to morality. \nHume identifies both what has value and what makes things valuable\nwith features of our psychology. Our first-order sentiments, passions\nand affections, as well as actions expressive of them, are what have\nmoral value. Our second-order reflective sentiments about our own or\nother people’s sentiments, passions and affections are what give\nthem value. On his view, morality is entirely a product of human\nnature. \nIn the “Conclusion” of the second Enquiry, Hume\nsummarizes his explanation of morality with a definition of virtue or\nmerit: \nevery quality of mind, which is useful or agreeable\nto the person himself or to others,\ncommunicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is\nadmitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit. (EPM\n9.1.12/277) \nThis is a precise parallel of his two definitions of cause in the\nfirst Enquiry. Both sets of definitions pick out features of\nevents, and both record a spectator’s response to those\nevents. \nHume’s second Enquiry is a sustained and systematic\nattack on the “selfish” or “self-love”\ntheories of Hobbes and Mandeville. He follows Hutcheson in thinking\nthat they assign two distinct roles to self-interest in their accounts\nof morality: first, moral approval and disapproval are based in a\nconcern for our own interest and, second, the motive of which we\nultimately approve is self-interest. Although many people during this\nperiod understood Hobbes’ theory through Mandeville’s\nlens, Hume believes it is important to distinguish them. As he sees\nit, Mandeville’s theory is superficial and easily dismissed.\nHobbes is his main opponent. \nHume’s rejection of Hobbes’ selfish account of approval\nand disapproval begins in Section II and ends in Part I of the\n“Conclusion” of the Enquiry. Like Hutcheson, he\nmistakenly supposes that Hobbes was offering a rival theory of\napproval and disapproval. We approve of people’s character\ntraits when they benefit us and disapprove of them when they harm us.\nHume looks at each of the four types of virtue and argues that in each\ncase, our approval does not spring from a concern for our own\nhappiness, but rather from sympathy. \nIn Section II, Hume argues that one reason we approve of benevolence,\nhumanity, and public spiritedness is that they are useful to others\nand to society. In Sections III and IV, he argues that the sole ground\nfor approving of justice and political allegiance is that they are\nuseful to society. In Section V, he asks: But useful for whom? Since\nit is obvious that it has to be “for some body’s\ninterest”, the question is “Whose interest then?” He\nassumes there are only two possibilities: approval and disapproval\nspring either from sentiments that are interested or from a\ndisinterested source. \nAccording to Hume, Hobbes’ “deduction of morals from\nself-love” begins with our realization that we cannot subsist\nalone. A social order provides security, peace, and mutual protection,\nconditions that allow us to promote our own interests better than if\nwe lived alone. Our own good is thus bound up with the maintenance of\nsociety. Although Hume agrees with Hobbes up to this point, he rejects\nhis explanation that we approve of justice, benevolence, and humanity\nbecause they promote our own happiness. \nHume is confident that “the voice of nature and\nexperience” will show that Hobbes’ theory, understood in\nthis way, is mistaken. Borrowing many of Hutcheson’s arguments,\nhe points out that if approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout the possible advantages and disadvantages to us of\npeople’s characters and actions, we would never feel approval\nand disapproval of people from “very distant ages and remote\ncountries”, since they cannot possibly affect us. We would never\nadmire the good deeds of our enemies or rivals, since they are hurtful\nto us. We would also never approve or disapprove of characters\nportrayed in novels or movies, since they are not real people and\ncannot possibly help or harm us. We approve of character traits and\nactions that are useful not because they benefit us, but because we\nsympathize with the benefits they bestow on others or society. \nHume next examines the remaining three types of character\ntraits—those that are useful to the agent (industriousness, good\njudgment), agreeable to the agent (cheerfulness) or agreeable to\nothers (politeness, decency). Why, for example, do we approve of\nindustriousness and good judgment, character traits that are primarily\nadvantageous to the possessor? In most cases they are of absolutely no\nbenefit to us and, in cases of rivalry, they counteract our own\ninterest. We approve of these character traits not because they are\nbeneficial to us, but because we sympathize with the benefits they\nconfer on others. Hume takes this as further evidence against\nHobbes’ explanation in terms of self-interest and in support of\nhis sympathy-based account. \nIn Part I of the “Conclusion”, Hume complains that\nHobbes’ self-love theory is unable to explain two important\nfeatures of our moral sentiments: we tend to approve of the same sorts\nof character traits and we are able to morally evaluate anyone, at any\ntime or place. If our approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout our own benefits and harms, the moral sentiments would vary from\nperson to person and for the same person over time. We wouldn’t\nhave moral feelings about most people, since most people don’t\naffect us. The moral sentiments spring from our capacity to respond\nsympathetically to others. \nHume is equally adamant that any explanation of the motives that\nprompt us to virtuous actions in terms of self-interest is mistaken.\nHe opposes them in Appendix II of the Enquiry, which was\noriginally part of Section II, “Of Benevolence”. He\nfollows Hutcheson in thinking that the issue is whether the various\nbenevolent affections are genuine or arise from self-interest. Once\nagain he distinguishes Mandeville’s from Hobbes’\nexplanations of benevolence and takes Hobbes to be his main opponent.\nOn Hume’s reading of Hobbes, while we approve of kindness,\nfriendship, and other benevolent affections, any desire to benefit\nothers really derives from self-interest, although we may not always\nbe conscious of its influence on those desires. \nHume offers two arguments against this selfish view. He first asks us\nto consider cases in which people are motivated by a genuine concern\nfor others, even when such concern could not possibly benefit them and\nmight even harm them. We grieve when a friend dies, even if the friend\nneeded our help and patronage. How could our grief be based in\nself-interest? Parents regularly sacrifice their own interests for the\nsake of their children. Non-human animals care about members of their\nown species and us. Is their concern a “deduction” of\nself-interest? He concludes that these and “a thousand other\ninstances … are marks of a general benevolence in human nature,\nwhere no interest binds us” (EPM App 2.11/300). \nHume supplements this argument from experience with a highly\ncompressed sketch of an argument he borrows from Butler. Happiness\nconsists in the pleasures that arise from the satisfaction of our\nparticular appetites and desires. It is because we want food, fame,\nand other things that we take pleasure in getting them. If we did not\nhave any particular appetites or desires, we would not want anything\nand there would be nothing from which we would get pleasure. To get\nthe pleasures that self-love aims at, we must want something other\nthan happiness itself. \nHume rightly showcases his pioneering account of justice. In the\nTreatise, he emphasizes the distinction between the natural\nand artificial virtues. The natural virtues—being humane, kind,\nand charitable—are character traits and patterns of behavior\nthat human beings would exhibit in their natural condition, even if\nthere were no social order. The artificial virtues—respecting\npeople’s property rights, fidelity in keeping promises and\ncontracts, and allegiance to government—are dispositions based\non social practices and institutions that arise from conventions. \nHume believes that nature has supplied us with many\nmotives—parental love, benevolence, and generosity—that\nmake it possible for us to live together peacefully in small societies\nbased on kinship relations. One of his important insights is that\nnature has not provided us with all the motives we need to live\ntogether peacefully in large societies. After arguing in\nTreatise 3.2.1 that justice is artificial, in T 3.2.2, he\nasks two different questions: What motivates human beings to establish\nthe rules of justice that give rise to property rights, and why do we\napprove of people who obey these rules of justice? The first question\nconcerns justice as a practice constituted by its rules. The second\nconcerns justice as a virtue, a person’s disposition to obey the\nrules of justice. \nHume argues that we enter into a series of conventions to bring about\npractices, each of which is a solution to a problem. Each convention\ngives rise to new problems that in turn pressure us to enter into\nfurther conventions. The convention to bring about property rights is\nonly the first of several into which we enter. After property rights\nare established, we enter into conventions to transfer property and to\nmake promises and contracts. According to him, we are by nature\ncooperators, although at first we cooperate only with members of our\nown family. But it is also advantageous for us to cooperate with\nstrangers, since it allows us to produce more goods and to exchange\nthem. All three conventions are prior to the formation of government.\nOn Hume’s view, it is possible for there to be a peaceful\nsociety of property owners who transfer and exchange material\npossessions before there is government.  \nHume argues that the practice of justice is a solution to a problem we\nnaturally face. The problem is that since we care most about our\nfamily and close friends, but material goods are scarce and portable,\nwe are tempted to take goods from strangers to give to our family and\nfriends. Disputes over these goods are inevitable, but if we quarrel\nwe will forfeit the benefits that result from living together in\nsociety—increased power, ability, and security. The solution to\nthe problem is to establish property rights. We make rules that\nspecify who has a right to what, and agree to follow the rules and to\nkeep our hands off the property of others. Hume was one of the\nfirst to see that what is useful is the practice of justice, rather\nthan individual acts of justice. Like Hobbes, he believes that it is\nin our interest to have the practice of justice in place. \nAs we just saw, Hume parts company with Hobbes when he answers the\nsecond question about why we approve of people who obey the rules of\njustice. If Hobbes’ answer in terms of self-interest is\nexcluded, he thinks only one possibility remains. We approve of just\npeople not because they benefit us but because we sympathize with the\nbenefits they bestow on others and society as a whole. Hume thus\nexplains our approval of justice by appealing to the same principle he\ninvoked to explain our approval of the natural virtues. Thus \nIn Part 2 of the “Conclusion” of the Enquiry,\nHume raises a serious problem with his account of justice. While it is\nin our interest to have the practice of justice in place, it may not\nalways be in our interest to obey its rules in every case. This is the\nfree rider problem. The free rider, whom Hume calls the sensible\nknave, wants to get the benefits that result from having a practice in\nplace without having to always follow its rules. He knows that the\nonly way to obtain the advantages of social cooperation is for the\npractice of justice to be in place, but he also realizes that a single\nact of injustice will not significantly damage the practice. Most people\nwill obey the rules of justice, so if he commits one act of injustice,\nthe institution will not be in any danger of collapsing. Suppose he\nhas the opportunity to commit an act of injustice that will benefit\nhim greatly. Why shouldn’t he?  \nHume confesses that if the sensible knave expects an answer, he is not\nsure there is one that will convince him. \nIf his heart rebel not against such pernicious maxims, if he feel no\nreluctance to thoughts of villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a\nconsiderable motive to virtue…. (EPM 9.2.23/283) \nThere is no general agreement about whether Hume actually provides an\nanswer to the sensible knave and if he does, whether it is\nadequate. \nHume wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question\nin the philosophy of religion, contributing to ongoing debates about\nthe reliability of reports of miracles, the immateriality and\nimmortality of the soul, the morality of suicide, and the natural\nhistory of religion, among others. All his work excited heated\nreactions from his contemporaries, and his arguments still figure\ncentrally in discussions of these issues today. \nHume’s greatest achievement in the philosophy of religion is the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion, which is generally\nregarded as one of the most important and influential contributions to\nthis area of philosophy. While all Hume’s books provoked\ncontroversy, the Dialogues were thought to be so inflammatory\nthat his friends persuaded him to withhold them from publication until\nafter his death. \nHume’s philosophical project, and the method he developed to\nexecute it, dictates his strategy in all the debates he entered. In\nthe debates about causation and ethics, there is an initial\ncritical phase, where Hume assesses the arguments of his\npredecessors and contemporaries, followed by a constructive\nphase, where he develops his own position. In the natural\nreligion debate, however, the situation is very different.\nHume’s critique of the central concepts of natural religion in\nthe critical phase shows that these concepts have no content,\nso there is nothing for the constructive phase of his\nargument to be about. Instead of resolving this debate, Hume\neffectively dissolves it. \nThe Dialogues are a sustained and penetrating critical\nexamination of a prominent argument from analogy for the existence and\nnature of God, the argument from design. The argument from design\nattempts to establish that the order we find in the universe is so\nlike the order we find in the products of human artifice that it too\nmust be the product of an intelligent designer. \nThe Dialogues record a conversation between three characters.\nCleanthes, a self–­proclaimed “experimental\ntheist”, offers the argument from design as an empirical proof\nof God’s existence and nature (DCNR 5.2/41). Demea\nopposes him, maintaining that the argument’s merely probable\nconclusion demeans God’s mystery and majesty. He believes that\nGod’s nature is completely inscrutable. Cleanthes dubs Demea a\nmystic, while Demea derides Cleanthes’\nanthromorphism—his human–centered bias in\ncomparing the creator of the universe to a human mind. \nCleanthes and Demea represent the central positions in the\neighteenth–century natural religion debate. Cleanthes embodies\nits dominant, progressive strain, consisting primarily of theologians\nin the British Royal Society, who were fascinated by probability and\nthe previous century’s impressive successes in experimental\nnatural philosophy. Convinced that the new science gave witness to\nGod’s providence, they rejected traditional a priori\nproofs, which purported to demonstrate God’s existence with\nmathematical certainty and without appeal to experience. Instead, they\nused the order and regularity they found in the universe to construct\na probabilistic argument for a divine designer. \nHoldouts clung to demonstrative proof in science and theology against\nthe rising tide of probability. Demea is the champion of these\nconservative traditionalists. Since he trots out a lame version of\nSamuel Clarke’s cosmological argument in Part 9, some have\nthought that Hume models Demea on him. But Demea lacks Clarke’s\nrigid rationalism. It is more likely that he epitomizes a group of\nminor theologians such as William King, who stressed God’s\nincomprehensibility and resorted to a priori arguments only\nwhen they absolutely needed them. \nThere was no genuinely sceptical presence in the\neighteenth–century natural religion debate. This makes\nPhilo, who both Cleanthes and Demea characterize as a\nsceptic, the ringer in the conversation. Although all three\ncharacters say very Humean things at one time or another,\nPhilo’s views are consistently the closest to Hume’s.\nPhilo’s form of scepticism is the mitigated scepticism\nof the first Enquiry, which makes him the most likely\ncandidate for Hume’s spokesman. \nAs the Dialogues begin, all three characters agree that their\nsubject is God’s nature, since everyone agrees that he\nexists. Parts 1–8 concern God’s natural\nattributes, his omnipotence, omniscience, and providence, while\nParts 10 and 11 consider his moral attributes, his\nbenevolence and righteousness. \nDemea holds that God is completely unknown and incomprehensible; all\nwe can say is that God is a being without restriction, absolutely\ninfinite and universal. Cleanthes is adamant that the argument from\ndesign establishes all of God’s traditional attributes. Natural\nobjects and human artifacts resemble one another, so by analogy, their\ncauses also resemble each other. God is therefore like a human mind,\nonly very much greater in every respect. \nDemea objects that the argument’s conclusion is only probable,\nbut Philo responds that the real problem is that the analogy is so\nweak. He launches a battery of arguments to show just how weak it is.\nThe dissimilarities between human artifacts and the universe are more\nstriking than their similarities. We only experience a tiny part of\nthe universe for a short time; much of what we do experience is\nunknown to us. How can we legitimately infer anything about remote\nparts of the universe, much less the universe as a whole? \nPhilo, however, moves quickly away from chipping at the\nargument’s strength to questioning the intelligibility\nof its conclusion. We have no experience of the origin of a\nuniverse. Since causal inference requires a basis in experienced\nconstant conjunction between two kinds of things, how can we\nlegitimately draw any conclusion whatsoever about the origin of the\nuniverse? Does it even require a cause? One or many? Does the cause of\nthe universe itself require a cause? The problem, then, is not just\nthat the analogy is weak; the real problem is that it attempts to take\nus beyond what we can know. \nMeanwhile, Demea derides Cleanthes’ anthropomorphism\nwhile remaining smugly satisfied with what Cleanthes disparagingly\ncalls his mysticism. The barbs they throw at each other, and\nthe speeches Philo goads them to make, help create a dilemma that\nPhilo uses them to construct. He directs the dilemma at Cleanthes, but\nit affects both characters, although Demea is slow to realize this. He\nthinks Philo is in league with him in detailing the problems with\nCleanthes’ anthropomorphism. \nChallenging Cleanthes to explain what he means by God’s mind,\nPhilo pushes him to admit that he means “a mind like the\nhuman”. Cleanthes, taking the bait, responds, “I know of\nno other” (DCNR 5.4/42). He argues that mystics like Demea are\nno better than atheists, since they make God so remote and\nincomprehensible that he bears no resemblance to human\ncharacteristics. Philo adds that although we regard God as perfect,\nperfection—as we understand it—is relative, not absolute,\nso we can’t conclude that we grasp God’s perfections.\nSince all God’s attributes involve perfection—perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, perfect goodness—we shouldn’t\nthink that any of his attributes resemble or are even\nanalogous to ours. But this means that we don’t know what\nwe’re talking about when we talk about God using the familiar\nterms we apply to human minds. \nDemea adds that giving God human characteristics, even if they are\ngreatly magnified, denies him attributes theists have always ascribed\nto him. How can an anthropomorphic God have the unity,\nsimplicity, and immutability of the God of\ntraditional theism? \nPhilo continues to detail just how inconvenient\nCleanthes’ anthropomorphism really is. If he accepts the\nargument from design, he must be committed to a God who is finite in\nall respects. But what does it mean to say that God is finitely\nperfect? Once you admit that God is finite, you’ve opened a\ncan of worms, for there are all sorts of equally probable alternatives\nto intelligent design. Why think that the universe is more like a\nhuman artifact than an animal or a vegetable? To illustrate, Philo\nthrows out a number of outlandish alternative hypotheses. For\ninstance, if you were a spider on a planet of spiders, wouldn’t\nyou naturally believe that a giant spider spun an immense web to\ncreate the world? \nCleanthes’ design hypothesis is so underdetermined by the\nevidence that the only reasonable approach is to abandon any attempt\nto adjudicate among it and its many alternatives. Total suspension of\njudgment is the only reasonable response. Otherwise, we go beyond the\nbounds of anything to which we can give specific content. \nThe dilemma Philo has constructed encapsulates the issue about the\ncontent of the idea of God that is central to the critical\naspect of Hume’s project in the Dialogues. If you\naccept that God’s attributes are infinitely perfect, you are\nusing ordinary terms without their ordinary meaning, so that they do\nnot have any clear meaning. If you deny God’s infinite\nperfection, you can give him understandable attributes, but only\nbecause they are amplified human characteristics. The closer Cleanthes\ncomes to regarding God’s mind as like a human mind, the closer\nhe comes to regarding God’s attributes as being like human\nattributes, and the less Godlike his “God” is. We can only\ngive the idea of God intelligible content at the perilously high cost\nof denying that he is really God. To do so is to abandon God for some\nkind of superhero. \nAt the end of Part 8, which concludes their discussion of God’s\nnatural attributes, Demea still thinks that Philo and he are partners.\nHe remains clueless about Philo’s strategy until the very end of\nPart 11, when he finally realizes that he too is caught in the trap\nPhilo has sprung. \nDemea offers an a priori alternative to the design argument\nin Part 9. As noted earlier, it is an abbreviated, watered–down\nversion of Clarke’s cosmological argument. Although Cleanthes\nquickly scotches his lame efforts, Part 9 serves as an interlude\nbetween the previous discussion of God’s natural\nattributes and the consideration of his moral attributes\nin Parts 10 and 11. \nDemea begins the discussion in Part 10. Attempting to save face from\nhis recent drubbing, he suggests that we don’t accept the truths\nof religion as a result of reasoning, but from what we feel\nwhen confronted with how helpless and miserable we are. Religion is\nbased on feelings of fear and anxiety that arise from awareness of our\n“imbecility and misery” (DCNR 10.1/68). Our forms of\nworship are attempts to appease unknown powers that oppress and\ntorment us. \nPhilo joins in, claiming he is convinced that \nthe best and indeed the only method of bringing everyone to a due\nsense of religion is by just representations of the misery and\nwickedness of men. (DCNR 10.2/68) \nThey proceed with a joint litany of the misery and melancholy of the\nhuman condition, topping each other with catalogues of woes. Demea\ndoes not realize that Philo may mean very different things by\n“just representation” and “due sense of\nreligion” than he does, so he fails to realize that Philo is\njust egging him on. \nPhilo maintains that we can’t evade the facts of disease,\nfamine, and pestilence, except by “apologies, which still\nfarther aggravate the charge” (DCNR 10.16/72). These apologies\nare theodicies—systematic attempts to reconcile\nGod’s goodness with the existence of evil. Demea is also\nscornful of theodicies, blissfully unaware that all too soon he will\nbe offering his own. \nCleanthes finally breaks in to say that he doesn’t feel\noppressively anxious or miserable, and hopes that anguish isn’t\nas common as they claim. But hoping that the extent of human\nmisery is not so widespread is not the same as proving that\nit is. Cleanthes is on weak ground. Philo capitalizes on it,\nchallenging Cleanthes to explain how God’s mercy and benevolence\ncan possibly resemble human mercy and benevolence. Given God’s\nomnipotence, whatever he wills happens, but neither humans nor animals\nare happy, so God presumably does not will their happiness. \nCleanthes—“smiling”—grants that if Philo can\nprove that mankind is “unhappy or corrupted”, he\nwill have succeeded in doing in religion (DCNR 10.28/74). He thinks he\nfinally has Philo on the ropes. In forcing a sceptic to prove a\npositive thesis, he must not only succeed at a difficult task, but\nviolates his scepticism in the process. Cleanthes fails to realize\nthat Philo will make his case without needing to prove anything, nor\ndoes he realize that he will soon be the one who needs a\nproof. \nDemea objects that Cleanthes exaggerates the dire consequences of\nacknowledging the human condition, and, despite his earlier vehement\nrejection of theodicies, offers his own. Sometimes called “the\nporch view”, Demea’s theodicy compares our experience of\nthe world to the world as a whole, including the afterlife, to trying\nto determine the structure of a large building from what little we can\nsee from its porch. From our perspective, we suffer, but from a longer\nview, either we don’t suffer at all, or else our suffering is\nfor our greater good or for the greater good of the world. \nCleanthes retorts that Demea denies the facts, and offers only empty\nhypotheses, which, if intelligible at all, could only establish their\nbare possibility, but never their reality. The only way to respond to\nchallenges to God’s benevolence is to deny that the human\ncondition is really so miserable. \nCleanthes has now put himself in the position in which he thought he\nhad put Philo. He must establish that the facts are as he claims, and\nPhilo is quick to stress how difficult this will be. By resting his\ncase on such an uncertain point, any conclusion he draws will be\nequally uncertain. \nPhilo then ups the ante by granting for the sake of argument that\nhuman happiness exceeds human misery. But if God is infinitely\npowerful, wise, and good, why is there any misery at all? There is no\nanswer that preserves all God’s attributes, except to grant that\nthe subject exceeds the limits of our understanding. \nPhilo, however, refrains from pressing the question of\nintelligibility; he is more interested in building an even\nstronger case against Cleanthes’ inference to God’s\nbenevolence. Raising the ante higher still, he grants that\npain and suffering are compatible with God’s infinite\npower and goodness. Cleanthes, however, must prove from the\n“mixed and confused phenomena” that God’s\nbenevolence is actual, not merely possible. Doing so\nis doubly difficult, since any inference from finite to infinite is\nshaky at best, even when the data are “pure and unmixed”\n(DCNR 10.35/77). \nPhilo concludes by admitting, with less than complete sincerity, that\nwhile he was hard pressed to make his case against Cleanthes when the\ndiscussion concerned God’s natural attributes, where his moral\nattributes are concerned, he is at ease. He challenges Cleanthes\n“to tug the laboring oar” and explain how he can infer\nGod’s moral attributes from the facts about the human condition\n(DCNR 10.36/77). \nCleanthes “tugs”, but only for one short paragraph. He\nadmits that if we go beyond their usual meanings when we apply human\nterms to God, what we say is indeed unintelligible. Abandoning all\nhuman analogy is thus to abandon natural religion, but preserving it\nmakes it impossible to reconcile evil with an infinite God. \nCleanthes realizes he has painted himself into a corner, but once\nagain he thinks there is a way out. Abandon God’s infinity;\nthink of him as “finitely perfect”. Then\n“benevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may\nproduce just such a world as the present” (DCNR 11.1/78). \nCleanthes doesn’t realize that his new theory is worse than his\nold one. He also doesn’t seem to remember Philo’s earlier\nquestion about what “finitely perfect” might possibly\nmean. Instead of God, he is now committed to some kind of superhero.\nBesides, the story he is telling is itself a theodicy. His\nsuperhero’s limitations explain why he cannot eliminate evil, or\ncreate an evil–free world. \nIn any case, Cleanthes is no better off than he was before.\nConjectures may show that the data are consistent with the\nidea of God, but are never sufficient to prove that he actually\nexists. \nPhilo then proceeds to outline four possible hypotheses about the\ncause of the universe: it is perfectly good; it is perfectly evil; it\nis both good and evil; it is neither good nor evil. Given the evil we\nknow exists, the data is at best mixed, so we can’t\nestablish either of the first two hypotheses. The regularity and\nuniformity of the general laws we find in experience is sufficient to\ndiscount the third, so the fourth seems the most probable. On that\nhypothesis, the cause of the universe is entirely indifferent to the\namount of good and evil in the world. \nThese points about natural evil also apply to moral\nevil. We have no more reason to think that God’s righteousness\nresembles human righteousness than we have to think that his\nbenevolence resembles human benevolence. We have even less reason, in\nfact, since moral evil outweighs moral goodness more than natural evil\noutweighs natural goodness. \nIn addition, Cleanthes’ new form of anthropomorphism is saddled\nwith tracing moral evil back to God. Since every effect must have a\ncause, either the chain of causes goes back infinitely, or it stops\nwith the original principle that is the ultimate cause of all\nthings—God. \nAt this point, Demea, who has become increasingly agitated during\nPhilo’s speech, interrupts. He finally realizes that the case\nPhilo is making cuts against his own view as much as it cuts against\nCleanthes’. Although it might appear that Demea can retreat to\nsome form of the theodicy he sketched earlier, the extent to which\nPhilo’s argument upsets him suggests that he now realizes it is\ninadequate. If he leans on the mystery–mongering he has\nprofessed until now, Philo has shown that, because of its lack of\nspecific content, it does not point exclusively to a good God. It may\njust as well commit him to a supreme being who is “beyond good\nand evil” and is totally indifferent to morality. Commitment\nwithout content turns out to be no commitment at all. Demea realizes\nthis, dimly at least, as he leaves the conversation. \nWith Demea’s departure, Cleanthes and Philo are left to finish\nthe conversation. Their tone is conciliatory, so conciliatory that\nPhilo says he must “confess” that although he is less\ncautious about natural religion than any other subject, \nno one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays\nmore profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself\nto reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature.\n(DCNR 12.2/89) \nPhilo’s “confession” paves the way for a blockbuster\nthat has puzzled generations of readers. Philo seems to reverse field,\napparently recanting what he has argued for so forcefully. He grants\nCleanthes that “a purpose, an intention, a design, strikes\neverywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker” (DCNR\n12.2/89). \nHis remarks are, however, by no means straightforward. Some take\nPhilo—and, by implication, Hume—to be outing himself as a\ncloset theist. Others conclude that, since he holds all the cards at\nthis point, he can afford to be conciliatory. Read ironically, Philo\ncould be saying that while “careless and stupid” observers\nare struck by purpose, intention, and design in the universe, careful,\ncritical, intelligent ones are not. But there is no need to force the\nirony here. Read straight, nature’s “contrivance and\nartifice” is “inexplicable” precisely because reason\ncan discover nothing about God’s natural or moral attributes.\nEveryone—even the stupid and careless—can see that the\nparts of animals and plants have functions, and so can easily\nunderstand why “an anatomist, who discovered a new organ or\ncanal, would never be satisfied until he had also discovered its use\nand intention” (DCNR 12.2/90). \nRecognizing that an organism’s parts have\nuses—functions—says nothing about\nwhether their uses or functions are due to a designer’s plan, so\nPhilo’s acknowledgement implies nothing about whether he now\naccepts the design hypothesis. In fact, what he says here reiterates\nhis position in Part 8, that function alone is no proof of divine\ndesign: \nit is in vain … to insist on the uses of the parts of animals\nor vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain\nknow how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted?\n(DCNR 8.9/61) \nNo one should deny design in this sense, so long as they do\nso “without any religious purpose” (DCNR 12.2/90). Far\nfrom reversing himself, then, Philo’s position is continuous\nwith the line he has taken throughout the Dialogues. \nAs the conversation continues, Philo provides a diagnosis of the\ndispute. While the works of nature do bear “a great\nanalogy” to the products of human artifice, as its proponents\nclaim, there are also considerable differences. He suspects that this\nmay be the source of the intractability of the controversy, which\nsuggests that it may be at bottom “somewhat of a dispute of\nwords” (DCNR 12.6/92). \nBut verbal disputes can be resolved—or\ndissolved—by providing clear definitions. However, the\ndilemma about the content of our idea of God that Philo has\nconstructed clearly implies that such a constructive solution\nis not possible here. \nPhilo explains why only a critical solution is possible by\noffering a deeper diagnosis of the problem. Although the dispute may\nappear to be merely verbal, it is in fact “still more incurably\nambiguous”, for \nthere is a species of controversy, which, from the very nature of\nlanguage and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, and\ncan never, by any precaution or any definitions, be able to reach a\nreasonable certainty or precision. These are the controversies\nconcerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance. (DCNR\n12.7/92) \nThis is exactly what the dispute over intelligent design is about.\nAnalogies are always matters of degree, and the degrees of the\nqualities involved in the design argument aren’t capable of\nexact measurement. The controversy thus “admits not of any\nprecise meaning, nor consequently of any determination” (DCNR\n12.7/93). The dispute about design is actually worse than a\nverbal dispute. \nThat is why anyone, even an atheist, can say, with equal plausibility,\nthat “the rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and\nthe structure of human thought” all “probably bear some\nremote analogy to each other” (DCNR 12.7/93). That is why Philo,\nwithout renouncing any of his previous claims, can assent to the\n“somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined”, and, as we have\nseen, indefinable proposition into which \nthe whole of natural theology … resolves itself …\nthat the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear\nsome remote analogy to human intelligence. (DCNR 12.33/101) \nAnything is like anything else in some remote respect. So the\nordering principle of the universe, if indeed there is one, can be\nabsolutely anything. \nIf this is all there is to “the whole of natural\ntheology”, then we can certainly conclude that the\nargument’s conclusion has no religiously significant content.\nBut it has no religiously significant content because Philo’s\ncritique has drained it of any content whatsoever. Cleanthes’\ndesign hypothesis is not just false; it is unintelligible. \nThe conversation began with all three participants agreeing that their\ntopic was to discuss only God’s nature, not his\nexistence. As it concludes, it is no longer clear that these\nquestions are really so distinct as originally assumed. We don’t\nknow what we’re talking about when we talk about a God whose\nnature is inconceivable, incomprehensible, indeterminate, and\nindefinable. What, then, are we to make of the claim about his\nexistence? \nThe Dialogues draw out the consequences of Hume’s\nstatement, in the first Enquiry, that \nthe idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good\nBeing, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and\naugmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom.\n(EHU 2.6/19) \nIf we insist on “augmenting without limit”, we let loose\nthe moorings that give intelligible content to God’s\nintelligence, wisdom, and goodness. If we stop short of the limit, we\nmay have content, but we have also lost God.","contact.mail":"cbrown@iwu.edu","contact.domain":"iwu.edu"}]
