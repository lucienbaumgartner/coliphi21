Besides the pure philosophical interest offered by\nthe possibility of defining mixed logic systems in which distinct\noperators obey logics of different nature, as for instance erotetic\nlogics (the logical analysis of questions) which require combining\nepistemic and deontic logics, there also exist many pragmatical and\nmethodological reasons for considering combined logics. In fact, the\nuse of formal logic as a tool for knowledge representation in Computer\nScience frequently requires the integration of several logic systems\ninto a homogeneous environment.\n\n\nImportant questions in the philosophy of logic such as: “why are\nthere so many logics instead of just one?” (or even, instead of\nnone), as for instance, raised in Epstein 1995, can be naturally\ncounterposed by several other questions: if there are indeed many\nlogics, are they excluding alternatives, or are they compatible? Is it\npossible to combine different logics into coherent systems with the\npurpose of using them in applications and to shed some light on the\nproperties of complex logics? Moreover, if we can compose\nlogics, why not decompose them? And, if a logic is\ndecomposed into elementary sublogics, is it possible to recover it by\ncombining such fragments? What kind of properties of logics can be\ntransferred to their combinations? Questions of this kind have been\nonly partially tackled in the literature, and reflect challenges to be\nconfronted in the evolution of this topic.\n\n\nDavid Hume generated a popular controversy with his famous passages of\n“A Treatise of Human Nature” (see Hume 2000: Book 3, Part\n1, Section 1, paragraph 27) where he noted that sometimes people draw\nconclusions involving prescriptive statements of the form ‘ought\nto be’ on the basis of descriptive statements of the form\n‘what is’. Hume thinks that logic used in this way\ninvolves a dangerous change of subject matter. So, whether or not\n‘ought’ can be derived from ‘is’ has become\none of the central questions of ethical theory, and the majority of\ninterpreters hold that, for Hume, such a derivation is impossible. \nWith our point of view concerning combinations of logics, it is\nnecessary to investigate the properties of combining deontic and\nalethic logics: in order to perform such a jump from ‘is’\nto ‘ought’ some authors propose (see e.g., Schurz 1997)\nthat what is necessary is an explicit “bridge principle”\nwhich specifically connects ‘is’ and ‘ought’.\nAn axiom schema \\(X\\), following Schurz (1991), is a bridge principle\niff \\(X\\) contains at least one schematic letter which has at least\none occurrence within the scope of an \\(\\obcirc\\) (the deontic\n“obligation” operator) and at least one occurrence outside\nthe scope of any \\(\\obcirc\\). Thus, for instance, \n\n\\[p \\rightarrow \\obcirc p\\]\n\n is a\nbridge principle representing ‘is-ought’ that which would\nappease Hume’s criticism. On the other hand, the much discussed\nmoral principle ‘ought-implies-can’ (controversially\nattributed to I. Kant, see Baumgardt 1946) can be formalized through\nanother bridge principle: \n\n\\[\\obcirc p \\rightarrow \\lozenge p,\\]\n\n where \\(\\lozenge\\) denotes the\nalethic “possibility” operator. \nClearly, bridge principles do not solve any philosophical questions\nsuch as the ‘is-ought problem’; nonetheless, they\ncontribute to clarify the problem and to uncover hidden assumptions.\nThe idea of combining logics lend clarification to questions of this\nkind by making clear that, for instance, ‘is’ and\n‘ought’ are indeed independent notions. This is elucidated\nthrough a formal analysis of the composition of the logics involved\n(in this case, alethic and deontic) or by decomposition of the complex\nlogic (in this case, bimodal) into simpler ones. In such\ncircumstances, combining logics can be perceived as a tool for\nsimplifying problems involving heterogeneous reasoning. \nThe fact that ‘ought’ is not conveyed as a predicate, but\nas a modal operator ranging over actions or states of affairs, was\nresponsible for the delay of formal treatments of this centuries-old\nquestion. \nSuch a treatment was only possible after the development of general\nmodal logic. Indeed, what we are dealing with here is a bimodal logic,\nwhich is properly treated only after a deeper understanding of the\nsemantical subtleties of mixing alethic and deontic logics. Moreover,\naccording to some philosophers who have argued that it is not possible\nto link ‘is’ and ‘ought’ (that is, who defend\nHume’s thesis that no non-trivial ‘is-ought’\ndeductions are possible), it is mandatory to use combinations of\nfirst-order, alethic and deontic logics (see e.g., Stuhlmann-Laeisz\n1983 and Schurz 1997). \nA. Prior (1960), using the apparatus of contemporary modal logic,\ntried to characterize the distinction between normative and\nnon-normative sentences in formal terms, which enabled him to\ndefine senses of ‘descriptive content’ versus\n‘normative content’. A problem, however, occurs with mixed\nsentences, which have both descriptive and normative components, and\nPrior comes up with a paradox: wherever we draw the distinction\nbetween non-normative and normative sentences, unexpected inferences\nfrom non-normative premises to normative conclusions may appear by a\nmere use of laws of classical propositional logic. Consider, for\ninstance, the following two inferences: \nformalized as: \nand \nformalized as: \nIf the mixed sentence \\(\\texttt{d} \\vee \\obcirc \\texttt{s}\\) is\nconsidered to be normative, then (1) is an example of an\n‘is-ought’ inference, and if it is considered to be\nnon-normative, then (2) is an example of an ‘is-ought’\ninference. So, one of them dichotomically represents a violation of\nHume’s thesis in Prior’s terms. Prior concluded from this\nparadox that Hume’s ‘is-ought thesis’ is simply\nfalse (see Prior 1960: 206): one can simply derive\nconclusions which are ethical starting from premises which have no\nethical character. \nPrior recognized however that the inferences involved in the paradox\nare ethically irrelevant or trivial, but neither he nor later authors\ncould find a suitable definition of what it would mean by\n“ethical irrelevance” or “ethical triviality”\nattached to an inference. \nUsing the semantics of modal logics, objections against this\nconclusion can be raised, as for example in Karmo 1988, in the sense\nof separating statements between evaluative in some possible worlds\nand descriptive in others (while keeping their meaning). \nBy using concepts of combinations of languages and combinations of\nlogics, G. Schurz (see Schurz 1991; see also Schurz 1997) was able to\nstate a generalized Hume’s thesis (GH); as\nobserved in\n subsection 4.1,\n this treatment is in fact a fusion of two modal logics. In\n(GH) a mixed sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is derived from a set of\npurely descriptive sentences (i.e., sentences free of \\(\\obcirc\\))\nonly if \\(\\varphi\\) is completely \\(\\obcirc\\)-irrelevant (that is,\npredicates in \\(\\varphi\\) within the scope of \\(\\obcirc\\) can be\nreplaced by other predicates salva valididate). Moreover, it\nis proven that (GH) holds in an alethic-deontic first-order\nlogic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) if, and only if, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) can be\naxiomatized without bridge principles. \nThe notion of bridge principle lies in the scope of combination of\nlanguages. In general, many bridge principles can be made explicit\nwithin modal logic, and will be relevant for analyzing relationships\namong diverse modalities. For example, if we take necessity\n\\(\\square\\) and possibility \\(\\lozenge\\) as primitive operators, then\n\n\\[\\lozenge p \\to \\neg\\square\\neg p\\]\n\n is an intuitionistically acceptable bridge principle,\nwhile the converse is not. \nBesides Hume’s problem, another example of bimodal logic with\nintrinsic philosophical interest where bridge principles intervene is\nthe logic of physical and alethic modalities. In this logic, the\nlanguage permits the expression of two different notions of necessity:\nthe logical necessity, symbolized by \\(\\square\\), and the physical\nnecessity, symbolized by \\(\\boxdot\\). \nThe simplest connection between physical necessity and logical\nnecessity that comprises an acceptable philosophical meaning is given\nby the following bridge axiom: \n\n\\[\\quad\\square p\\to\\boxdot p\\]\n\n meaning that logical\nnecessity is stronger than physical necessity: anything that is\nlogically necessary is physically necessary. \nThe resulting logic KT\\(^{\\boxdot}\\) is axiomatized\nby the well-known axioms and rules of KT for both\nmodalities in addition to the bridge axiom above, and is semantically\ncharacterized by Kripke frames with two accessibility relations,\nrequiring that the accessibility relation for physical necessity is\nincluded in the other. \nNot only bimodal, but multimodal (also called polymodal) logics, are\nstandard in the literature: a typical case is the logic of knowledge\n(or epistemic logic), usually endowed with modal operators\n\\(K_{1},K_{2},\\ldots,K_{m}\\) representing the knowledge of \\(m\\)\nagents (or “knowers”). The formula \\(K_{i}\\alpha\\) means\n“agent \\(i\\) knows \\(\\alpha\\)”, and the language is able\nto express, for instance, “\\(i\\) knows that \\(j\\) does not know\nthat \\(i\\) knows \\(p\\)” by means of \\(K_{i}\\neg K_{j}K_{i}p\\).\nNo additional mixing principles are mandatory for the combined logic\nof many agents, but bridge axioms may, of course, be added. \nThe interest of studying combinations of logics may thus be seen as a\nreflex of the pluralist view of contemporary logical research. Indeed,\nthis kind of bridge axioms can, in principle, connect completely\ndistinct logics. Van Benthem (2006) suggests that combining logics may\nlead to the emergence of new phenomena, depending on the mode of\ncombination, and moreover, it may work as an inspiration (and perhaps\nas a model) for the study of combining epistemic notions. He even\nsuggests that the compartmentalization of logic into subfields as\n‘modal’, ‘temporal’, ‘epistemic’,\n‘doxastic’, ‘erotetic’ or\n‘deontic’ logic has been harmful to Philosophical\nLogic. \nCombinations of logics go in the opposite direction of such a\ncompartmentalization: considering that almost any conceptual task to\nbe analyzed involves immediate reasoning concerning necessity,\nobligation, action, time, verbal tense, knowledge, belief, etc.; from\na philosophical point of view, logical combinations may be the right\nway to look at philosophical issues within the theory of causation, of\naction, and so on. \nThe idea of looking at logic as an entirety avoiding fragmentation is\nnot new, and philosophers and logicians from Ramón Lull to\nGottfried W. Leibniz have thought of building schemes where different\nlogics or logic-like mechanisms could interact and cooperate instead\nof competing. In contemporary terms, the first methods for combining\nlogics were products of logics (introduced by K. Segerberg\n(1973) and independently by V. Šehtman (1978)), fusion\n(introduced by R. Thomason (1984)) and fibring (introduced by\nD. Gabbay (1996a)), all of them dedicated to combining only modal\nlogics. It is worth noting that M. Fitting (1969) gave early examples\nof fusion of modal logics, anticipating the notion of fusion. \nOther combination mechanisms followed, such as parameterization and\ntemporalization, which were more on the side of software\nspecification. \nMost of these methods have been encompassed in the algebraic\nfibring introduced by A. Sernadas, C. Sernadas and C. Caleiro\n(1999), which notoriously improved the versatility of these techniques\nby means of (universal) categorial constructions, in this way making\nit possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal\nlogics. \nOn the other hand, making heavy use of the language of category\ntheory, J. Goguen and R. Burstall introduced the notion of\ninstitutions as a kind of abstract model theory devoted to\napplications in Computer Science (see Goguen and Burstall 1984, 1992).\nInstitutions are also used as a mechanism for combining logics. \nHowever, combining logics does not only mean synthesizing or composing\nlogics, but can also yield interesting examples that go in the\nopposite direction of decomposing logics (see\n section 2).\n A paradigmatic methodology for decomposition is the\npossible-translations semantics, a notion proposed in\nCarnielli 1990 designed to help solve the problem of assigning\nsemantic interpretations to non-classical logics. Examples of\npossible-translations semantics illustrate how a complex logic can be\nanalyzed into less complex factors. Other techniques such as direct union of matrices and plain\nfibring (see Coniglio and Fernández 2005) can be\nconsidered to be methods for both composing and decomposing. \nAll of these methods open the way for a new subject in the realm of\ncombinations of logics: is it possible to decompose a given logic into\nelementary ones? In other words, are there prime logics\nwhich, combined in an appropriate way, may produce all (or part of)\nthe familiar logic systems? This question will be retaken in  \nsection 5 \nResults on combinations of logics may quickly become too technical\nwhen we turn to the combination of higher-order, modal, relevance\nlogics or non-truth-functional logics, and thus refinements of the\nnotion of algebraic fibring such as modulated fibring (see C.\nSernadas et al. 2002b) or cryptofibring (see Caleiro and\nRamos 2007) may be necessary to solve, for example, some collapsing\nproblems within combinations of logics (see\n section 5).\n This naturally leads to the use of category theory as a universal\nlanguage and as a tool to deal with such problems. But the fact is\nthat combinations of logics do not necessarily depend upon any highly\ntechnical methodology, and even some relatively simple examples can be\nreally expressive. There is a recognized intersection and interaction\nbetween Philosophy and theoretical Computer Science, and techniques\nfor combining logics are also revealed to be very apt tools for\nhandling and thus better understanding Kripke models. Having been\nintroduced in the domain of Philosophical Logic, Kripke models are\nessential in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence as semantic\nstructures for logics of belief, knowledge, temporal logics, logics\nfor actions, etc. Knowledge representation and reasoning may require\ncombining several reasoning formalisms, including combinations of\ntemporal reasoning, reasoning in description logic, reasoning about\nspace and distance, and so on. Logics, combining temporal and modal\ndimensions, are also becoming a relevant tool in agent-oriented\nprogramming languages. Other applications of combinations of logics\ninclude software specification, knowledge representation,\narchitectures for intelligent computing and quantum computing,\nsecurity protocols and authentication, secure computation and\nzero-knowledge proof systems, besides their connections to formal\nethics and game semantics. \nThe Belief-Desire-Intention model of agents (BDI) is concerned with\nthe formal representation of practical reasoning involving action,\nintention, belief, will, deliberation, goal-driven modeling, etc. This\nkind of reasoning is essential for planning (especially for artificial\nagents). It is then just natural to think about combining simple modal\nlogics for knowledge, belief, obligation, capability, opportunity,\netc., so as to define more robust BDI logics. Governatori et al. 2002\ninvestigates the relationships between BDI logics and a particular\ncase of Gabbay’s fibring semantics (see\n subsection 4.2)\n called dovetailing, showing that a (general) logical account\nof BDI can be handled by means of dovetailing multimodal logics. \nBut combinations of logics also work from another perspective: instead\nof directly combining logic systems and looking for the interpretation\nof the resulting system, one can start from a purely mathematical\nperspective. In van Benthem et al. 2006, for instance, the authors\nintroduce the notion of horizontal and vertical topologies on the\nproduct of topological spaces, and show that the modal logic of\nproducts of topological spaces with horizontal and vertical topologies\ncoincides with the fusion of S4 with itself. The resulting\ncompleteness proof has deep connections with some topological\nproperties of the real and of the rational numbers. \nIt is reasonable to expect that a method for combining logics would\nwork in two opposite directions: on the one hand, a logic that one\nwants to investigate could be decomposed into factors of lesser\ncomplexity; for instance, a bimodal alethic-deontic logic could be\ndecomposed into its alethic and deontic fragments. In this case, it\nwould be relevant to see if the logic under investigation is the least\nextension of its factors, or if additional bridge principles would\nhave to be added. This approach, in which a given logic is decomposed\ninto (possibly) simpler factors, is said to be a process of\nsplitting logics. \nOn the other hand, one might be interested in creating new logic\nsystems where different aspects are integrated, starting from given\nlogics. This demand typically occurs in software engineering and\nsecurity: knowledge representation, formal specification and\nverification of algorithms and protocols have a marked need for\nworking with several logics. In a less pragmatical scenery, this would\nbe the case if one is interested, for instance, in adding a modal\ndimension to an intuitionistic or a paraconsistent logic. Moreover, it\nis interesting to characterize which properties of the factors can be\ntransferred to the combined logic. This direction is said to be a\nprocess of splicing logics. \nThe essential distinctions between splicing (in the direction of\nsynthesis) and splitting (in the direction of analysis) take into\naccount the intentions one may have in mind, and consequently each\ndirection encompasses specifically designed techniques. \nThe paradigm of splicing logics assumes a bottom-up perspective: it\ncombines given logics, synthesizing them, and producing a new one. The\ncombined logic should be minimal in some sense: that is, if \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\) is obtained from \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) by some\ncombination process, it should be expected that: 1) \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nextends both \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\); and 2)\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is a minimal extension of both \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). For instance, some methods may require\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) to be the least conservative extension of both \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). This point will be discussed in\n section 5. \nOn the other hand, splitting a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) assumes a top-down\nperspective: logics are decomposed into (presumably simpler)\nfactors. \nIt should be stressed that most of the methods for combining logics\nfound in the literature are better understood from the splicing\nperspective, placing prominence on the creation of a logic system from\nfamiliar logics. However, some splicing methods such as fusion (see\n subsection 4.1)\n are more usefully regarded as a method of decomposition of logics\ninto simpler fragments, and in this way also work in the splitting\ndirection. Possible-translations semantics (see\n subsection 4.4),\n on the other hand, constitute a typical method within the splitting\nperspective. \nSuppose that two given logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\nare to be combined using some technique. It should be obvious that any\nmethod applied to combine \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) will\ncreate a new logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) which contains the\nsignature (logic symbols such as connectives, quantifiers,\npropositional variables etc.) of both logics: \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nwill be defined in a mixed language, which allows combinations of\nsymbols of the underlying languages. That is, a combination of logic\nsystems presupposes the previous combination of the respective\nsignatures. This is why the choice of the signature of the combined\nsystem is as important as the logic itself. For instance, the\ndefinition of the language of parameterization is fundamental in order\nto obtain the intended combined logic (see\n subsection 4.5).\n Another example is found in Schurz 1991, where the formal treatment\nof Hume’s ‘is-ought problem’ (recall\n section 1)\n presupposes careful handling of subtle combinations of languages. \nBesides the definition of the appropriate language for the combined\nlogic, another important question that immediately arises is: should\nthe logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) (to be combined) be\npresented in the same way? In other words: is it possible to combine\nlogics defined by different paradigms? For instance, how could one\ncombine a logic \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\), defined by a sequent calculus, with\na logic \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), represented by a (Hilbert-style) axiomatic\nsystem? How should the resulting logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) be represented:\nas a sequent calculus, as an axiomatic system or as a mixed proof\nsystem? Consider now another (even worse) situation: the logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) is described by semantical means (that is, through\nsemantic structures such as valuations or Kripke models) whereas the\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is presented through a syntactical proof\nsystem, such as a natural deduction system, sequent calculus or a\nHilbert-style axiomatization. Could the resulting (combined) logic be\nbetter presented semantically or syntactically? \nThis annoyance does not occur in the majority of cases, where the\nlogics being combined are complete with respect to some kind of\nsemantics and are syntactically presented in a homogeneous way.\nHowever, it may happen that the logics are found in peculiar ways; for\ninstance, linear logic and other substructural logics have no usual\nconsequence relations because derivations are exclusively displayed by\nusing multisets or sequences of formulas. Combinations of such logics\nwith usual modal logics, for instance, are not so obvious, although\nboth are complete. \nStill, there are logics which are only reasonably presented by\nsyntactical means, or exclusively by semantical means. Such is the\ncase, e.g., of the first-order theory of torsion groups, known to be\nnon-axiomatizable, and of incomplete modal logics which are only\npresented in syntactical (proof-theoretical) terms. \nA possible solution to the problem of combining heterogeneous logics,\nwhich naturally leads us to the deeper question of “what is a\nlogic?”, is to consider a common component of the majority of\nlogics (but still excluding certain substructural logics): their\nrespective consequence relations. Thus, given \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) presented in different ways, it is always possible to\nextract the respective consequence relations and then combine them\n(taking, for instance, their supremum in an appropriate lattice of\nconsequence relations). But in this way, the resulting logic \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\) is presented in a very abstract way: the only information\navailable from \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is its consequence relation, and so the\ncharacteristics and particularities of each logic component are\ndefinitively lost. \nReturning to the first example (combining a sequent calculus with an\naxiomatic system), a better solution was proposed in Cruz-Filipe et\nal. 2008: the idea is to define an abstract formalism for proof\nsystems, general enough as to encode the main proof mechanisms found\nin the literature. Thus, after reformulating \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) as abstract proof systems of this kind, the resulting\ncombined logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is an abstract proof system in which it\nis possible to recognize the ‘genetic traces’ of the\noriginal inference rules of each component within derivations in\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\). The latter question, namely, how to characterize\nderivations in a fibred logic in terms of the derivations of the\ncomponents, was carefully analyzed by S. Marcelino et al. in\na series of papers Marcelino et al. 2015; Marcelino and Caleiro \n2016; and Marcelino and Caleiro 2017a.  See\n subsection 4.3. \nDespite the above mentioned results on combining heterogeneous logics,\nit seems more reasonable to combine logics defined in a homogeneous\nway, and, in fact, this is the case with most of the proposals in the\nliterature. For instance, the usual combinations of modal logics (as\nfusion, product and fibring) are performed between systems presented\naxiomatically, or between classes of Kripke models. It is frequent,\ntherefore, to define different categories of logic systems\n(consequence relations, Hilbert calculi, algebraizable logics etc.)\nwith appropriate morphisms between them, in which the combination (or\ndecomposition) of logics appear as universal constructions. Algebraic\nfibring, to be described in\n subsection 4.3,\n is a good example of this approach. \nThe method of fusion of normal modal logics was introduced by\nR. Thomason (1984), and constitutes one of the first general methods\nfor combining logics. In the original formulation, it combines normal\nmodal logics presented syntactically and semantically (through\nHilbert-style axioms and Kripke semantics, respectively). The main\ncharacteristics of the method are described in the following\nparagraphs. \nConsider Kripke models of the form \n\n\\[\\langle W,R,V\\rangle\\]\n\n such that \\(W\\) is a\nnon-empty set (the set of worlds), \\(R\\subseteq W\\times W\\) is a\nbinary relation (the accessibility relation) and \\(V: \\mathbb{P} \\to\n\\wp W\\) from the set of propositional variables into the power set of\n\\(W\\) is a valuation map. Let \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) be\ntwo propositional normal modal logics defined over the same classical\nsignature which contains the connectives \\(\\neg\\) (negation) and\n\\(\\to\\) (implication). Denote by \\(\\square_1\\) and \\(\\square_2\\) the\nnecessity operators of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\),\nrespectively. Let \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\) be the classes\nof Kripke models for \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\),\nrespectively. Since both logics are normal, it is granted that both\nmodalities \\(\\square_1\\) and \\(\\square_2\\) satisfy the normality axiom\n\\(K\\) and the necessitation rule. The fusion of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is then defined to be the normal bimodal\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) with two independent boxes \\(\\square_1\\) and\n\\(\\square_2\\) together with the connectives \\(\\neg\\) (negation) and\n\\(\\to\\) (implication). The semantics of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is given by the\nclass \\({{\\cal M}}\\) of Kripke structures of the form \n\n\\[\\langle W,R_1,R_2,V\\rangle\\]\n\n such\nthat \\(\\langle W,R_1,V\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle W,R_2,V\\rangle\\) belong\nto \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\), respectively. In other\nwords, each structure of the fusion corresponds to a pair of models: a\nmodel \\(\\langle W,R_1,V\\rangle\\) for \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and a model\n\\(\\langle W,R_2,V\\rangle\\) for \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) sharing the same set\nof worlds \\(W\\). Technically speaking, each structure of the fusion\nhave, as a reduct, a model of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and a model of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\). \nGiven a structure \\(M=\\langle W,R_1,R_2,V\\rangle\\), the accessibility\nrelation \\(R_1\\) is used to evaluate the box \\(\\square_1\\), whereas\n\\(R_2\\) is used to evaluate \\(\\square_2\\). Since the language of\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is freely generated by the union of the signatures of\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), it contains mixed formulas such\nas \\(\\varphi = \\square_1(\\square_2 p \\to p)\\). Now, the structure\n\\(M\\) satisfies \\(\\varphi\\) above at a world \\(w \\in W\\) if and only\nif, for every \\(w_1 \\in W\\) such that \\(w R_1 w_1\\), \\(M\\) satisfies\n\\((\\square_2 p \\to p)\\) at \\(w_1\\). But this means that, either there\nexists \\(w_2\\) such that \\(w_1 R_2 w_2\\) and \\(w_2 \\not\\in V(p)\\), or\n\\(w_1 \\in V(p)\\). \nAs concerns axiomatics, a Hilbert calculus for \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nobtained by joining up the (schema) axioms of both systems. Thus,\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) has, among others, two \\(K\\) axioms, two necessitation\nrules and just one Modus Ponens (because implication \\(\\to\\)\nis shared). Considering that the language of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) has mixed\nformulas (as \\(\\varphi\\) above), schema variables occurring in the\nschema rules of the given logics can now be replaced in \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nby mixed formulas. For instance, \\(\\varphi\\) can be derived in\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) from the formula \\((\\square_2 p \\to p)\\) by an\napplication of the necessitation rule for the box \\(\\square_1\\). \nAn interesting example of fusion appears in Schurz 1991, when an\nalethic-deontic logic is defined by fusing a pure alethic logic with a\npure deontic logic. This combination is used to analyze Hume’s\n‘is-ought thesis’ (see\n section 1\n above) in formal terms. Other intuitively appealing examples of\nfusion are given in the pioneering paper Fitting 1969 by M. Fitting,\nwhere alethic and deontic modalities are fused (before the concept of\nfusion had ever been introduced). \nSince then fusion has been a much worked theme. Important results are\nthe applications of fusion to simulations and to the question of\ntransfer of properties among modal logics. Simulations make the\nstrength of normal monomodal logics explicit, as they can, in a sense,\nsimulate all modal logics (see Kracht and Wolter 1999). With respect\nto transfers, the preservation of properties such as completeness,\nfinite modal property, decidability and interpolation by fusion of\nmodal logics was extensively studied in Fine and Schurz 1996. More\ngeneral and deeper results in the same spirit were obtained in Kracht\nand Wolter 1991, and a survey of most of those results can be found in\nKracht and Wolter 1997. These results show the robustness of fusion as\na combination method within the scope of modal logics, for fulfilling\nthe requirement of preserving the properties of the logics being\ncombined. \nThe question of how completeness results (and other model-theoretical\nproperties) can be transferred from a propositional modal logic to its\nquantificational counterpart, and from a monomodal quantified modal\nlogic to their multimodal combinations by means of fusion, is\ninvestigated in Schurz 2011. The paper also deals with the question on\nhow completeness can be transferred from quantified modal logic with\nrigid designators to the ones with non-rigid designators. \nRasga et al. 2010 defines a categorical approach of fusion for modal\nlogic systems labelled with truth values, and it is shown that the\npreservation of completeness requires some careful assumptions, while\nsoundness is preserved without further provisos. A wide variety of\nlogics (besides modal logics) including several non-classical logics\ncan be treated in this way. \nAn interesting note is that there is a notable difference between\ncombining logics from the syntactical and from the semantical\nperspective. For instance, the joining of two Hilbert calculi should\nbe intuitively obtained by simply putting together the axioms and\nrules of both logics, while the semantical counterpart is not so\nobviously determined. Regarding this, an alternative to fusion is the\nfibred semantics (see\n subsection 4.2). \nFusion, even if it is a very natural method for combining modal\nlogics, however, is not obviously extendable to combinations of\nnon-normal modal logics with normal modal logics. Moreover, fusion is\nspecifically designed for combining modal logics, and cannot be\nextended in an obvious way to logics of a different nature. Algebraic\nfibring, described in\n subsection 4.3\n below, constitutes a generalization of fusion (at the propositional\nlevel), and generally solves the question of combining logics. \nAnother early method for combining (modal) logics is the so-called\nproduct of modal logics. This mechanism, independently\nintroduced in Segerberg 1973 and in Šehtman 1978, is\nappropriate to represent time-space information. Given two modal\nlogics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) as above, the product\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\times {{\\cal L}}_2\\) is the bimodal logic over the\nmixed signature (endowed with two boxes) characterized by the class of\nKripke structures of the form \n\n\\[\\langle W_1\\times W_2,S_1,S_2,V_1 \\times V_2 \\rangle\\]\n\n defined from Kripke models\n\\(\\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle W_2,R_2,V_2\\rangle\\) for\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), respectively. The accessibility\nrelations \\(S_1,S_2\\subseteq ( W_1 \\times W_2) \\times (W_1 \\times\nW_2)\\) are defined as follows: \n\\(\\langle u_1,u_2\\rangle S_1 \\langle w_1,w_2 \\rangle\\) iff \\(u_1 R_1\nw_1\\) and \\(u_2=w_2\\); \n\\(\\langle u_1,u_2\\rangle S_2 \\langle w_1,w_2 \\rangle\\) iff \\(u_2 R_2\nw_2\\) and \\(u_1=w_1\\); \n\\((V_1 \\times V_2)(p)=V_1(p) \\times V_2(p)\\). \nA somewhat surprising feature of the product of modal logics is that\nsome new interactions between modalities arise. These new valid\nformulas are a sort of bridge principles (recall\n section 1).\n Using the standard notation \\(\\lozenge_1 \\varphi\\) for \\(\\neg\n\\square_1 \\neg \\varphi\\) (and analogously for \\(\\lozenge_2\\)) for the\npossibility operator, the following bridge principles are always valid\nin the product logic: \n\\((\\lozenge_1\\lozenge_2 p \\to \\lozenge_2\\lozenge_1 p )\\) Commutativity\n1; \n\\((\\lozenge_2\\lozenge_1 p \\to \\lozenge_1\\lozenge_2 p )\\) Commutativity\n2; \n\\((\\lozenge_1\\square_2 p \\to \\square_2\\lozenge_1 p )\\) Church-Rosser\nproperty 1; \n\\((\\lozenge_2\\square_1 p \\to \\square_1\\lozenge_2 p )\\) Church-Rosser\nproperty 2. \nDue to such interactions it is not possible to directly obtain the\nHilbert calculus for the product of two modal logics, as in the case\nof fusion. The bridge principles must be explicitly added to the union\nof the original axiomatics in order to ensure completeness. \nIn general, the axiomatization of products of modal logics is a\ndelicate issue, and some interesting phenomena can arise.  For\ninstance, the two-dimensional modal product logic\nS5\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)S5 has a finite\naxiomatization but, for \\(n \\geq 3\\), the \\(n\\)-dimensional product\nlogic S5\\(^{n}\\) is non-finitely axiomatizable. In\nKurucz and Marcelino 2012 there were found the first examples of\ndecidable two-dimensional products of finitely axiomatizable modal\nlogics, such as\nK4.3\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)S5, which fail to\nbe finitely axiomatizable. These are examples of logics that fall prey\nto what we may call the finite crash phenomenon, where the\nfinite axiomatizability property is destroyed under the action of\nproducts.\n \nThe problem of finding a canonical axiomatization for non-finitely\naxiomatizable products of finitely axiomatizable logics was solved in\nHampson, Kikot, Kurucz and Marcelino 2020, by analyzing\ntwo-dimensional modal product logics involving the unimodal logic of\nthe difference Diff, introduced by von Wright 1979 as\nthe logic of ‘elsewhere’. This logic is defined by the set\nof unimodal formulas that are valid in all the frames \\(\\langle\nW,\\neq_{W}\\rangle\\), where \\(\\neq_{W}\\) is the non-identity relation\non a non-empty set \\(W\\); these frames are called difference\nframes. The logic Diff can be characterized as\nthe logic of all the frames \\(\\langle W,R\\rangle\\) where \\(R\\) is a\npseudo-equivalence relation, that is, where \\(R\\) is symmetric and\npseudo-transitive: if \\(R(x,y)\\) and \\(R(y,z)\\) then either \\(x=z\\) or\n\\(R(x,z)\\).  Since, in particular, equivalence relations are frames\nfor Diff, the latter is a sublogic of\nS5.  The paper proves that, despite\nDiff is a finitely axiomatizable subsystem of\nS5, the two-dimensional product logic\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff is\nnon-finitely axiomatizable, and can be axiomatized by infinitely many\nSahlqvist axioms. Let\nDiff\\(\\,\\times^{sq}\\,\\)Diff be the\n‘square’ version of\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff, which is\ncharacterized by the family of all the products \\(\\langle\nU,\\neq_{U}\\rangle \\times \\langle V,\\neq_{V}\\rangle\\) of difference\nframes such that the sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) have the same cardinality;\nhence Diff\\(\\,\\times^{sq}\\,\\)Diff\ncontains the logic\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff. The paper\nproves that the former is not a finite axiomatic extension of latter,\nand can be axiomatized by adding infinitely many Sahlqvist axioms.\nThe modal logics\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff and\nDiff\\(\\,\\times^{sq}\\,\\)Diff are the\nfirst examples of products of finitely axiomatizable modal logics that\nare not finitely axiomatizable, although axiomatizable by explicit\ninfinite sets of canonical (Sahlqvist) axioms.\n \nAs in the case of fusion, the technique of products of logics does not\nallow a direct generalization to logics other than modal ones. \nThe fibred semantics of modal logics was originally proposed\nin Gabbay 1996a and Gabbay 1996b (see also Gabbay 1999).\nAs in the case of fusion and products, the mechanism of fibring also\napplies to modal logics only. Assume the same notation as in\n subsection 4.1.\n Thus, given \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), we start by\ndefining the fibred language (or the fibring of the languages), which\nis the language generated by \\(\\square_1\\), \\(\\square_2\\), \\(\\neg\\)\nand \\(\\to\\) from the propositional variables. The basic idea is to\nconsider Kripke models with distinguished (actual) worlds together\nwith two transfer mappings: \\(h_1\\) from the set of worlds of the\nclass of models \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) into the class of\nmodels \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), and \\(h_2\\) from the set\nof worlds of the class of models \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\ninto the class of models \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\). When a\nKripke model of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) has to evaluate a formula of the form\n\\(\\square_2 \\varphi\\) at the actual world \\(w_1\\), the validity\nchecking is then transferred to the validity checking of \\(\\square_2\n\\varphi\\) within the Kripke model \\(h_1(w_1)\\) at its actual world.\nThe evaluation of a formula of the form \\(\\square_1 \\varphi\\) within a\nKripke model of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) at the actual world \\(w_2\\) is\nperformed analogously, but now using the map \\(h_2\\). \nThus, the fibring (or fibring by functions, as it is called\nin Carnielli et al. 2008) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is\na normal bimodal logic characterized semantically as follows: let and \nbe a pair of transfer mappings. For\nsimplicity, we assume that the sets of worlds \\(W_m\\) of \\(m\\in {{\\cal\nM}}_1\\) are pairwise disjoints, and the same holds for \\({{\\cal\nM}}_2\\). Given \\(m\\in {{\\cal M}}_1 \\cup {{\\cal M}}_2\\), \\(w\\in W_m\\)\nand a formula \\(\\varphi\\) in the fibred language, the satisfaction of\n\\(\\varphi\\) in \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\), denoted by \\(\\langle\nh_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\), is defined recursively as usual\nwhenever the main connective of \\(\\varphi\\) is Boolean (\\(\\neg\\) or\n\\(\\to\\)), or when \\(\\varphi\\) is atomic. For the modalities,\nsatisfaction is defined as follows: suppose (without loss of\ngenerality) that \\(m \\in {{\\cal M}}_1\\), and let \\(h_1(w)=\\langle\nm_2,w_2\\rangle\\), with \\(m=\\langle W_m,R_m,V_m\\rangle\\) and\n\\(m_2=\\langle W_{m_2},R_{m_2},V_{m_2}\\rangle\\). Then: \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\square_1\\varphi\\)\n\niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w_1\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\), for every \\(w_1\\)\nsuch that \\(w R_m w_1\\); \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\square_2\\varphi\\)\n\niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m_2,w_2\\rangle\\Vdash \\square_2\\varphi\\)\n\niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m_2,w_3\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\), for every\n\\(w_3\\) such that \\(w_2 R_{m_2} w_3\\). \nThe definition of \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash\n\\square_i\\varphi\\) for \\(i=1,2\\) and \\(m \\in {{\\cal M}}_2\\) is\nanalogous. \nThen, \\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle\\) satisfies \\(\\varphi\\), denoted by\n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle \\Vdash \\varphi\\), if \\(\\langle\nh_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\) for every \\(m\\in {{\\cal M}}_1 \\cup\n{{\\cal M}}_2\\) and \\(w\\in W_m\\). Finally, \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in the\nfibred semantics whenever \\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle \\Vdash \\varphi\\)\nfor every pair \\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle\\) as above. \nFor instance, given \\(h_1, h_2\\) as above, let \\(\\langle\nW_2,R_2,V_2\\rangle \\in {{\\cal M}}_2\\) and \\(w_2\\in W_2\\) such that\n\\(h_2(w_2)= \\langle \\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle,w_1\\rangle\\). Then: \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W_2,R_2,V_2\\rangle,w_2\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_1 \\square_2 \\neg p\\) \niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle,w_1\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_1 \\square_2 \\neg p\\) \niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle,w'_1\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_2 \\neg p\\), for every \\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\). \nSuppose that \\(h_1(w'_1)= \\langle \\langle\nW'_2,R'_2,V'_2\\rangle,w'_2\\rangle\\). Then, the latter is valid iff \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W'_2,R'_2,V'_2\\rangle,w'_2\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_2 \\neg p\\), \nfor every \\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\); i.e., for every\n\\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\) and for every \\(w''_2\\) such that\n\\(w'_2 R'_2 w''_2\\), \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle\nW'_2,R'_2,V'_2\\rangle,w''_2\\rangle \\Vdash \\neg p\\). This is equivalent\nto saying that, for every \\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\) and for\nevery \\(w''_2\\) such that \\(w'_2 R'_2 w''_2\\), \\(w''_2 \\not\\in\nV'_2(p)\\). \nWith respect to axiomatics, the logics obtained by fibring by\nfunctions can, in some cases, be axiomatized by the union of the\n(schema) axioms of the given logics. But some logics may require the\naddition of some new bridge principles (mixing rules and axioms) in\norder to ensure the preservation of completeness. This may explain\nsome discrepancy between the approaches of fusion and fibring; the\ncompleteness of fibring as exposed in Gabbay 1999 does not work\nexactly as a substitute for more technically intricate completeness\nproofs as in Kracht and Wolter 1991 and in Fine and Schurz 1996. For\nmore on this discussion, see Kracht 2004. \nThe technique of fibring by functions is an interesting alternative to\nfusion and products, but, as much as its competitors, it cannot be\nextended to non-modal logics in any obvious way (see Coniglio and\nFernández 2005 for an adaptation of the method of fibring by\nfunctions to matrix logics). One reason for the failure of fibring by\nfunctions to what concerns generalizations is that it is not a\nuniversal construction (in categorial terms). Moreover, the lack of a\nsystematic definition of the axiomatization for the logics obtained by\nfibring is another negative aspect of this technique. The next\nsubsection describes a categorial generalization of fibring which\nsolves all the mentioned problems. \nIn order to overcome the limitations of the original method of fibring\nas exposed in the last subsection, A. Sernadas and collaborators\npropose, in Sernadas et al. 1999, a general definition of fibring\nusing the conceptual tools of category theory. The central idea of the\ngeneralization is simple: suppose that \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\) are two propositional logics which are to be combined.\nSuppose, for simplicity, that no connectives are to be shared, that\nis, the language of the logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) to be obtained is the\nfree combination of the connectives of both logics. In categorial\nterms, the signature \\(C\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the coproduct\n(disjoint union) of the signatures \\(C_1\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\(C_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), in the underlying category of signatures.\nThen \\({{\\cal L}}\\), which is the least logic defined over\n\\(C\\) which extends simultaneously \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), is defined as the coproduct of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\) in the underlying category of logics. The minimality of\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) attends a criterion expressed in Gabbay 1999 (see also\n section 5)\n and also conforms to the ideal of fusing logics, see Kracht and\nWolter 1991. This combination process, called unconstrained\nfibring, can be generalized, by allowing \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) to\nshare some connectives. Thus, the logic obtained by this second kind\nof fibring is defined in a language such that some connectives of\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are identified. The logic\nproduced by this operation, called constrained fibring,\nstarts by considering two logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\nover signatures \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\), respectively, and a signature\n\\(C_0\\) contained in both \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\). This signature contains\nexactly the connectives of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) which\nare to be identified (or shared) throughout the combination process.\nAfter computing the unconstrained fibring (that is, the coproduct)\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), which is defined over the signature \\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\) (the\ncoproduct of \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\)), a new logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nobtained. This logic, the fibring of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\) by sharing (or constrained to) \\(C_0\\), is\nobtained from \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) by identifying two\nconnectives (of the same arity) iff both come from the same connective\nin \\(C_0\\). In terms of category theory, it is required that the\nforgetful functor \\(N\\) from the category of logics to the category of\nsignatures be a cofibration. Then, if \\(i_j:{{\\cal C}}_0\\to C_j\\) is\nthe inclusion morphism (for \\(j=1,2\\)), \\(h_j:C_j \\to C_1 \\oplus C_2\\)\nis the canonical injection of the coproduct (for \\(j=1,2\\)) and\n\\(q:C_1 \\oplus C_2 \\to C\\) is the coequalizer of \\(h_1 \\circ i_1\\) and\n\\(h_2 \\circ i_2\\), then the constrained fibring \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the\ncodomain of the cocartesian lifting of \\(q\\) by \\(N\\). \nIn order to exemplify the technique of categorial fibring (without\nentering into technical details), suppose that \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are two modal logics defined through Hilbert calculi\nover the same signatures \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) of subsections\n 4.1\n and\n 4.2,\n respectively, such that both logics contain the rules of Modus\nPonens and necessitation. Then \\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\) consists of two\nnegations \\(\\neg_1\\) and \\(\\neg_2\\), two implications \\(\\to_1\\) and\n\\(\\to_2\\) and two boxes \\(\\square_1\\) and \\(\\square_2\\). The\nunconstrained fibring \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is, therefore, the Hilbert calculus over\n\\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\) defined by joining up the axiom schemas and\ninference rules of both calculi. This logic has, among other axioms\nand inference rules, two versions of Modus Ponens (one for\neach implication) as well as two versions of the necessitation rule\n(one for each box). It should be noted that, by using a fixed set of\nschema variables for writing the axioms and rules of every calculus,\nthe calculi obtained by fibring are also formed by schematic axioms\nand inference rules. Thus, for instance, in the rule of Modus\nPonens in \\({{\\cal L}}\\): \n\n\\[\\frac{\\xi_1 \\hspace{1cm} (\\xi_1 \\to_1 \\xi_2)}{\\xi_2}\\]\n\n the schema variables\n\\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi_2\\) can be replaced by mixed formulas. Instances\nsuch as \n\n\\[\\frac{\\neg_2 p \\hspace{1cm} (\\neg_2 p \\to_1 \\square_2(q \\to_2 \\square_1 r))}{\\square_2(q \\to_2 \\square_1 r)}\\]\n\n are new, because the formulas \\(\\neg_2 p\\) and\n\\(\\square_2(q \\to_2 \\square_1 r)\\) do not belong to the language of\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\). Analogous replacements apply, of course, to other\ninference rules and axioms of \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal\nL}}_2\\). \nContinuing with this example, suppose now that we want to share (or\nidentify) both negations, as well as both implications: this is a\nreasonable move when, for instance, these connectives are classic. In\nsuch case \\((\\varphi \\to_1 \\neg_2 \\psi)\\) would represent the same\nproposition as \\((\\varphi \\to_2 \\neg_1 \\psi)\\). \nIn order to do this, the signature \\(C_0\\) just containing \\(\\neg\\)\nand \\(\\to\\) is taken into consideration, and so \\(\\neg_1\\) is\nidentified with \\(\\neg_2\\) in \\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\), as well as \\(\\to_1\\)\nis identified with \\(\\to_2\\). The resulting signature is \\(C\\), which\njust contains the connectives \\(\\neg\\), \\(\\to\\), \\(\\square_1\\) and\n\\(\\square_2\\). In the resulting logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\), defined over\n\\(C\\), there is now just one rule of Modus Ponens: \nHowever, there remain two necessitation rules, since\nthere are still two boxes in \\(C\\). The resulting \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nthus the fibring of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) constrained\nby \\(C_0\\). This procedure precisely coincides with fusion of modal\nlogics. The novelty here is that this technique applies to a broad\nclass of logics, which are not necessarily restricted to (normal)\nmodal logics, as in the case of fusion. \nConstrained and unconstrained fibring, being categorial, are universal\nconstructions, and so enjoy well-defined and theoretically predictable\nformal properties. Profiting from universal constructions, in order to\nhandle algebraic fibring, it is enough to define appropriate\ncategories of signatures and logic systems. Indeed, the same\nfibring construction (coproduct or cocartesian lifting) can be\nperformed in different categories of logic systems. This is a\nremarkable advantage of the categorial perspective for fibring. There\nare several proposals in the literature devoted to combining logics\npresented in different ways by means of algebraic fibring:\npropositional Hilbert calculi, sequent and hypersequent calculi,\nfirst-order modal logics, higher-order modal logics,\nnon-truth-functional logics, logics semantically presented through\nordered algebras (encompassing generalized Kripke models) etc. \nAn important question connected to combination of logics (and, in\nparticular, to algebraic fibring) is the preservation of\nmetaproperties such as completeness, interpolation etc. For instance,\nwhen \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are complete logic systems\npresented both semantically and syntactically, under which condition\nis their fibring also complete? In this regard, Zanardo et al. 2001\nand Sernadas et al. 2002a give a partial solution to this question.\nThe preservation of soundness and completeness with respect to the\ntechnique of importing logics (see\n subsection 4.6) \nwas proved in Rasga et al. 2013. Besides, in a series of papers\n(Marcelino et al. 2015, Marcelino and Caleiro 2016, and\nMarcelino and Caleiro 2017a), S. Marcelino et al. study the\npreservation of decidability by unconstrained fibring (that is, by\nalgebraic fibring without sharing connectives). The key result is a\ngeneral characterization of the derivations in the system obtained by\nfibring in terms of the derivations in each component. The complexity\nof the decision procedures was also analyzed in these papers. Thus, it\nwas shown that the decision problem for the fibred logic can be\nreduced polynomially to the worst decision problem of the given\nlogics. This means that, in particular, if the decision problems for\ntwo given logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are both in a\ncomplexity class \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) then the decision problem for the\nunconstrained fibring \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) is also in\n\\(\\mathcal{C}\\), provided that \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) contains the basic\ncomplexity class P (also known as PTIME) and is closed for\ncomposition with polynomials. Other examples of preservation of\nmetaproperties are provided by the mechanism for combining logics\nknown as meet combination of logics, introduced by Sernadas\net al. 2012 (see subsection\n4.6).  Specifically, the preservation of soundness and\ncompleteness (see Sernadas et al. 2012), Craig interpolation\n(see C. Sernadas et al.  2013 ) and admissibility of rules (see Rasga\net al. 2016) have been obtained for this method. On the other\nhand, transfer results have been extensively studied in the case of\nfusion of modal logics, as already mentioned in subsection 4.1. \nBesides the studies concerning preservation of metaproperties by\nfibring mentioned above, the semantics of fibred logics is not so easy\nto determine from the semantics of the components. That is, there is\nno natural correspondence between the models of the component logics\nand the class of models which characterizes the least logic in the\nmixed language which extends simultaneously the given logics, that is,\ntheir fibring. This question is far from being simple: for instance,\nin Marcelino and Caleiro 2017a it was shown that the act of fibring\ntwo logics, each of one being characterized by a single finite matrix,\ncan produce a logic which is uncharacterizable by a single matrix\n(even infinite). In Marcelino and Caleiro 2017b a first step towards\nthe solution of this problem was given, by characterizing the\nsemantics of unconstrained fibring of logics presented by means of\nnondeterministic matrix semantics.  Nondeterministic matrices\n(or Nmatrices) generalize logical matrices by allowing the connectives\nto be interpreted by multivalued truth-functions instead of ordinary\ntruth-functions. Nmatrices were formally introduced in Avron and Lev\n2001 (see also Avron and Lev 2005) to provide a semantical account for\nlogics uncharacterizable by a single finite matrix. However, the use\nof Nmatrices for logics was already considered by several authors\n(Rescher 1962; Ivlev 1973, 1985, 1988 and Kearns 1981 in the context\nof modal logics; and Crawford and Etherington 1998). By using two\ndifferent notions of product of Nmatrices, in Marcelino and Caleiro\n2017b it is shown that the disjoint fibring of two propositional\nlogics, each of one presented by a single Nmatrix, is characterized by\na single Nmatrix obtained from the given ones by using these\nproducts. This encompasses the fibring of logics presented by\nmatrices, since every logical matrix is, in particular, a\nnon-deterministic matrix. \nThe relationship between fusion and algebraic fibring deserves some\ncomments. When restricted to modal propositional logics, fusion is a\nparticular case of algebraic fibring in the category of interpretation\nsystems, where logics are presented through ordered algebras: it is\nenough to consider interpretation systems defined over power set\nalgebras induced by Kripke models. At the syntactical level, fusion is\nalso a particular case of algebraic fibring in the category of Hilbert\ncalculi, in the realm of propositional signatures. As much as\nfirst-order modal logics are concerned, the approaches diverge, mainly\nbecause there are different semantical accounts for treating\nfirst-order modalities. For instance, the semantical approach to modal\nfirst-order logics by Sernadas et al. 2002a in the context of\nalgebraic fibring differs from that of Kracht and Kutz (2002) in the\ncontext of fusion. \nThe fact that algebraic fibring generalizes (at least at the\npropositional level) the fusion of modal logics makes the former\nmethod become very natural and useful. Moreover, the universality of\nthe construction allows one to define algebraic fibring in very\ndifferent logical contexts (categories of logics), such as\nnon-truth-functional logics, higher-order logics, sequent calculi etc.\nAs it will be shown in\n section 5,\n the different notions of morphisms between logics affect the strength\nof the logics obtained by algebraic fibring in the different\ncategories of logic systems. For general accounts of algebraic fibring\nsee, for instance, Caleiro et al. 2005 and Carnielli et al. 2008. \nThe methods for combining logics described above adhere to the\nsplicing methodology: they are used to combine logics creating new\nsystems which extend the given logics. \nAs mentioned in\n section 2,\n there is a converse direction: the splitting methodology in which a\ngiven logic system is decomposed into other systems. The\npossible-translations semantics (in short, PTS),\nintroduced in Carnielli 1990 (see also Carnielli 2000), is one of the\nfew supporters of this viewpoint. \nThe notion of PTS was originally defined as an attempt to\nendow certain logics with recursive and palatable semantic\ninterpretations. Actually, several paraconsistent logics which are not\ncharacterizable by finite matrices can be characterized by suitable\ncombinations of many-valued logics. The idea of the decomposition is\nquite natural: given a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\), presented as a pair\n\\({{\\cal L}}=\\langle C,\\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\rangle\\) in which \\(C\\) is a\nsignature and \\(\\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\) is a consequence relation, a\nfamily of translations \\(f_i:L(C) \\to L(C_i)\\) (for \\(i\\in I\\)) is\ntaken into consideration. Here, \\(L(C)\\) and \\(L(C_i)\\) denote the\nalgebra of formulas defined by the signature \\(C\\) and \\(C_i\\),\nrespectively. Recall that a translation from a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\ninto a logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\) is a mapping \\(f\\) between the respective\nsets of formulas which preserve derivability, that is: \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\varphi\\) (in the source logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\))\nimplies that \\(f(\\Gamma) \\vdash_{{{\\cal L}}'} f(\\varphi)\\) (in the\ntarget logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\)). \nA pair \\(P=\\langle \\{{{\\cal L}}_i\\}_{i\\in I}, \\{f_i\\}_{i\\in\nI}\\rangle\\) as above is called a possible-translations frame\nfor \\({{\\cal L}}\\). We say that \\(P\\) is a\npossible-translations semantics for \\({{\\cal L}}\\) if, for\nevery \\(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\}\\subseteq L(C)\\), \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\varphi \\\n\\textrm{ iff } \\ f_i(\\Gamma) \\vdash_{{{\\cal L}}_i} f_i(\\varphi), \\\n\\textrm{ for every  } i \\in I.\\]\n\n This means\nthat checking derivability in \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is equivalent to checking\nderivability in every factor logic \\({{\\cal L}}_i\\) through the\ntranslations. In many cases, the factor logics \\({{\\cal L}}_i\\) are\npresented by finite matrices. Since the length of a formula is finite,\nit is enough to test a finite number of translations in order to\ndetermine if a formula of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is valid in \\({{\\cal L}}\\).\nThus, checking the validity of a formula of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nequivalent to performing a finite number of finitary tests. This\ndecidability property is of real advantage when the original logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is not characterizable by finite matrices. For\ninstance, in Carnielli 2000 (see also Marcos 1999) the well-know\nhierarchy \\(\\{{{\\cal C}}_n\\}_{n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}\\) of paraconsistent\nlogics of N. da Costa, formed by logics which cannot be characterized\nby finite matrices, is represented by means of a PTS whose\nfactors are presented through finite matrices; this grants a decision\nprocedure for each logic \\({{\\cal C}}_n\\). \nIn order to exemplify the concept of PTS as a splitting\nmethodology, consider the paraconsistent logic bC,\nintroduced in Carnielli and Marcos 2002. This logic is, in particular,\na logic of formal inconsistency (LFI), in\nthe sense that there exists a unary connective \\(\\circ\\) expressing\nthe consistency of a formula. Thus, from \\(\\varphi\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\varphi\\) does not follow, in general, an arbitrary formula\n\\(\\psi\\). However, \\(\\{\\varphi, \\neg\\varphi, \\circ\\varphi\\}\\) entails\nany formula \\(\\psi\\). The signature \\(C\\) of bC\nconsists of a paraconsistent negation \\(\\neg\\), a consistency operator\n\\(\\circ\\), and classical connectives \\(\\wedge,\\vee,\\to\\). It was\nproved in Carnielli et al.  2007 that bC, and\nmany other logics of formal inconsistency extending it, cannot be\ncharacterized by finite matrices. Nonetheless, bC is\ndecomposed into several copies of a three-valued logic by means of\npossible-translations as follows: consider the signature\n\\(C_1=\\{\\neg_1,\\neg_2,{\\circ}_1,{\\circ}_2, {\\circ}_3,\n\\wedge,\\vee,\\to\\}\\) consisting of two negations, three consistency\noperators, a conjunction, a disjunction and an implication. Let \\(M\\)\nbe the matrix over \\(C_1\\) with domain \\(\\{T,t,F\\}\\) displayed below,\nwhere \\(\\{T,t\\}\\) is the set of designated values. \nLet \\(\\{f_i\\}_{i\\in I}\\) be the family of all the mappings \\(f:L(C)\\to\nL(C_1)\\) satisfying clauses \\((tr0)\\), \\((tr1)\\), \\((tr2)\\), \\((tr3)\\)\nand \\((tr4)\\) below. \nThe family of mappings \\(\\{f_i\\}_{i\\in I}\\) can be shown to define a\nPTS which characterizes bC in a decidable\nway (see Carnielli et al. 2008). As an example, it can be easily\nchecked that \\(\\varphi\\wedge\\neg\\varphi\\to\\neg{\\circ}\\varphi\\) is a\ntheorem of bC: just consider all its finitely many\ntranslations and test that all of them are three-valued tautologies.\nOn the other hand, \\(\\neg(\\varphi\\wedge\\neg\\varphi)\\to{\\circ}\\varphi\\)\nis not a theorem of bC, which can be promptly\nverified by showing that at least one of its translations is not a\ntautology using the three-valued tables above. For an alternative\nPTS characterization of bC and related\nlogics see Marcos 2008. \nThis example shows that a non-truth functional connective, such as the\nparaconsistent negation \\(\\neg\\) or the consistency operator \\(\\circ\\)\nof bC, can be mimicked by interpreting it (via\ntranslations) into different truth-functional connectives. The idea of\ninterpreting (or decomposing) a connective into simpler ones can be\nrelated to the notion of non-deterministic matrix semantics proposed\nby Avron and Lev, and mentioned in \nsubsection 4.3. \nIndeed, in Carnielli and Coniglio 2005 it is shown that\nnon-deterministic matrices can be simulated by appropriate\npossible-translations semantics. In particular, the familiar matrix\nsemantics are a particular case of possible-translations semantics, as\nwell as the historical examples of translations between logics found\nin the literature. These facts evidence that possible-translations\nsemantics is a widely applicable conceptual tool for decomposing\nlogics. \nApart from the logical and philosophical import of combining logics,\nthere is a genuine interest in developing applications based on these\ntechniques. One of the main areas interested in the methods for\ncombining logics is software specification. Certain techniques for\ncombining logics were developed almost exclusively with the aim of\napplying them to this area. In this section some of these methods will\nbe briefly mentioned: temporalization,\nparameterization and institutions. \nTemporalization was introduced in Finger and Gabbay 1992 (see also\nFinger and Gabbay 1996), and generalized in Caleiro et al. 1999\ntowards the method called parameterization. \nParameterization, in rough terms, consists of replacing the atomic\npart of a given logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) by another logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\).\nThus, the logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the parameterized logic;\nthe atomic part is the formal parameter and the logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}'\\) is the parameter logic. Formally, a mixed\nsignature based on the signature of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is considered, to\nwhich the formulas of \\({{\\cal L}}'\\) are added as constants. In the\nparticular case of temporalization, the parameter logic is a temporal\nlogic. In turn, it can be proven that parameterization is a particular\ncase of constrained fibring (recall\n subsection 4.3). \nThe method can be explained by means of a simple example taken from\nCarnielli et al. 2008: consider a propositional modal logic \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\), to be parameterized with first-order logic \\({{\\cal L}}_{fol}\\)\nin order to describe the dynamics of data bases. The resulting logic\nis defined in a language whose formulas are obtained by replacing\npropositional constants in formulas of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) by first-order\nformulas. That is, modalities can be freely used, but quantifiers\ncannot be applied to modal formulas (other propositional connectives\nsuch as negation and implication are shared). \nThe semantic structures for the new logic are Kripke structures where\nthe valuation for propositional constants is replaced by a kind of\n“zooming in” mapping (in the sense of Blackburn and de\nRijke 1997) associating a first-order semantic structure together with\na fixed assignment for individual variables to each state. \nThe deductive system for the new logic is formed by the rules of both\nlogics. The rules of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) can be instantiated with formulas\nof the parameterized language, but the rules of first-order logic can\nonly be applied to pure first-order formulas. \nOne important difference between parameterization (in particular,\ntemporalization) and constrained fibring is the degree of symmetry:\nthe parameterized language and inference rules are intrinsically\nasymmetric, while this is not the case of constrained fibring. \nInstitutions were introduced by J. Goguen and R. Burstall (see Goguen\nand Burstall 1984, 1992) as a kind of “abstract model\ntheory” for Computer Science, and are adequate for developing\nconcepts of specification languages such as structuring of\nspecifications and implementation. \nThe theory of institutions is mainly applicable to software\nspecification defined by multiple logical systems (see, for instance,\nDiaconescu and Futatsugi 2002). Thus, under an abstract view of\nsoftware development, different components of the same program can be\nspecified using different formalism in an heterogeneous setting. This\nis formalized by the use of institutions and morphisms between them\n(see, for instance, Tarlecki 2000). A problem concerning institution\nmorphisms is that formulas involving connectives from different logics\nbeing combined are not allowed. A solution to this problem was\nproposed in Goguen and Burstall 1986 and Mossakowski 1996, by using\nthe so-called parchments and parchment\nmorphisms. \nDespite the fact that algebraic fibring is suitable for combining an\nample class of logic systems, some kinds of logics, namely\nsubstructural logics such as linear logic, and logics equipped with a\nnondeterministic semantics, lie outside the scope of this combination\nmethod. Moreover, at the semantical level, algebraic fibring, by its\nown nature, does not make possible to keep representatives of all the\nmodels of the original logics (which leads to the collapsing\nproblem of fibring, see\n section 5). \nWith the aim of still enlarging the range of application of algebraic\nfibring, so as to make it able to deal with substructural logics and\nwith logics endowed with nondeterministic semantics, as well as to\ncombine pointwise models of each logic, a formalism for representing\nlogics and their combinations based on the general notion of\nmulti-graphs (or, for short, m-graphs) was proposed by A. Sernadas and\nhis collaborators (see Sernadas et al. 2009a, 2009b). Multi-graphs are\ngraphs where the source of each edge is a finite sequence of nodes\n(instead of a unique node). Concerning signatures, the nodes of the\nm-graph are seen as sorts and the m-edges are seen as language\nconstructors. From the semantical viewpoint, nodes are truth-values\nand m-edges are relations between truth-values. Finally, concerning\ndeductive systems, nodes are language expressions, and m-edges are\ninference rules. The fibring of logics described by m-graphs (a.k.a.\ngraph-theoretic fibring) is defined by pointwise combining\nmodels of each combined logic, in contrast to the usual notion of\nsemantic fibring in which entire classes of models are combined. This\nallows one to avoid the collapsing problem (see the next section) in a\nvery natural way. \nAs an immediate application of this graph-theoretic setting, the\npreservation of the finite-model property by graph-theoretic fibring\nwas proved in Coniglio et al. 2011. Since (under reasonable\nconditions) the finite model property entails decidability, this\nresult is particularly useful. \nAnother application to the graph-theoretic account of logic is the\ndefinition of an asymmetric combination technique called importing\nlogics (see Rasga et al. 2012). Temporalization, as well as its\ngeneralization, modalization (see Fajardo and Finger 2003 and\nFinger and Weiss 2002), are particular cases of importing logics.\nUnder this approach, the combined language is endowed with an explicit\nconstructor called importing connective which transforms\nformulas of the imported logic into formulas of the importing logic.\nThis is the main difference between the technique of importing logics\nand the related technique of parameterization (which also generalizes\ntemporalization, see\n subsection 4.5).\n Semantically, each model of the resulting logic obtained by the\nmethod of importing logics is a pair composed of a model of the\nimporting logic and a model of the imported logic, plus the\ninterpretation of the importing connective. In Rasga et al. 2014 a new\nformulation of algebraic fibring, called biporting, was\nintroduced, which turns out to be equivalent to the original one. From\nthis, it is possible to prove that some particular cases of importing,\nlike temporalization, modalization and globalization, are subsumed by\nfibring. \nA new mechanism for combining logics called meet combination of\nlogics was firstly presented in C. Sernadas et al. 2013 and\nadditionaly developed in Rasga et al. 2016. This technique is based on the idea of melding or pairing\nconnectives (of the same arity) of two given logics being\ncombined. The melded connectives of the resulting logic inherit the\ncommon properties enjoyed in both logics, instead of the union of\ntheir properties, as it occurs in the case of the shared connectives\nof constrained fibring. The idea of pairing connectives within a\nsingle logic was already explored in Sernadas et al. 2011a and 2011b,\ntowards identifying common properties of any given pair of connectives\nof the same arity. \nUp to this point, several techniques for composing logics have been\ndescribed and exemplified. Are these processes appropriate for\ncomposing, without surprises, any pair of logics? In other words,\ngiven a pair of logics (presented in a homogeneous way), are they\ncomposable in a meaningful way? Does the composition make\nphilosophical sense? As pointed by Schurz 1991, it is conceivable that\nsome multimodal logics obtained as combination of modal logics by\nadding arbitrarily chosen bridge principles could be meaningless. \nFrom the technical point of view there is an important problem\nconcerning composition of logics known as collapsing problem,\nfirstly identified in Gabbay 1996b, and later formalized in del Cerro\nand Herzig 1996. In the latter paper, it is shown that, by freely\ncombining classical propositional logic and intuitionistic\npropositional logic at the semantical level (technically: by\nconstructing their unconstrained fibring in the category of\ninterpretation systems, recall\n subsection 4.3)\n the resulting logic collapses to classical logic. More precisely, the\nresulting logic will consist of two twin copies of classical\npropositional logic, having two negations, two implications and so on.\nClearly, the respective copies of each connectives will be proved to\nbe inter-derivable in the resulting logic: \\(\\neg_1 \\varphi\\) will be\nequivalent to \\(\\neg_2\\varphi\\), \\((\\varphi\\to_1 \\psi)\\) will be\nequivalent to \\((\\varphi\\to_2 \\psi)\\) and so on. The collapse only\nhappens when considering the algebraic fibring at the semantical\nlevel: in Caleiro and Ramos 2007 was shown that the collapse does not\noccur when computing the algebraic fibring of the respective Hilbert\ncalculi. \nBasically, the phenomenon arises because both implications collapse,\nand then intuitionistic implication becomes classic. From the\nsemantical point of view, it happens that the models of the fibred\nlogic are Heyting algebras which are simultaneously Boolean algebras:\nevidently the algebras collapse to the Boolean ones. From the point of\nview of proof theory, the problem appears as a consequence of the\nmetaproperty called Deduction Metatheorem (DMT): let\n\\(\\to_1\\) and \\(\\to_2\\) be the intuitionistic and the classical\nimplications, respectively. Then \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  & \\textrm{ iff }&  \\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\\\\n\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  & \\textrm{ iff }&  \\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_2\\psi)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n Thus, the following\nargument applies (see Gabbay 1996b): \n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi) &  \\textrm{(Axiom)}\\\\\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi),\\,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  &  \\textrm{(DMT for } \\rightarrow_1) \\\\\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_2\\psi) &  \\textrm{(DMT for } \\rightarrow_2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n A similar argument\nshows that \\((\\varphi\\to_2\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\). That is,\nclassical and intuitionistic implications collapse in the combined\nlogic. \nIt is worth noting that the previous arguments depart from a very\nstrong assumption: that the metaproperty DMT is preserved in the\ncombined logic. As we shall see below, this is not the case for\nalgebraic fibring, unless a stronger notion of morphism between logics\nis adopted. \nIn C. Sernadas et al. 2002b other examples of collapse were presented,\nand a solution to the problem was proposed by means of a controlled\nnotion of algebraic fibring called modulated fibring. An\napparently simpler solution to the collapsing problem appeared in\nCaleiro and Ramos 2007, using a variant of the algebraic fibring\ntechnique called cryptofibring. As mentioned in\n subsection 4.6,\n the graph-theoretic fibring leads to an additional solution to this\nproblem. Another solution to the collapsing problem was obtained by\nmeans of the meet combination of logics (see\n subsection 4.6).\n Given that the combined connectives inherit the common properties\nenjoyed in both logics, the interaction between the component logics\nwithin the resulting logic is minimized, which allows to overcome the\ncollapsing problem. \nIndependently, in Beziau 2004 it was observed that by putting together\nthe sequent rules for classical conjunction and the rules for\nclassical disjunction, the resulting sequent calculus will\n(unexpectedly) prove the distributivity between conjunction and\ndisjunction. The same phenomenon occurs if we join the (two-valued)\nvaluation clauses for classical conjunction with the valuation clauses\nfor classical disjunction. However, this is avoided by considering\nalgebraic fibring in the usual categories (Hilbert calculi or\nconsequence relations) with translations between logics as morphisms:\nthe logic obtained is the logic of lattices, which does not satisfy\ndistributivity (see Beziau and Coniglio 2005, 2011). \nThis situation, in which new interaction rules between the connectives\narise, is arguably undesirable. In fact, it contradicts a basic\ncriterion of fibring (and also of fusion), as expressed in Gabbay\n1999: given logic systems \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), the\ncombination of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) should be the\nsmallest logic system in the combined language which is a conservative\nextension of both \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). \nIndeed, the distributivity problem and the collapsing problem are two\ninstances of the same phenomenon of emergence of unexpected\ninteractions (such as bridge principles) between connectives caused by\ncombination processes. In the case of combination of conjunction with\ndisjunction, the distributive law emerges: this interaction is due to\nthe combination process and appears without any apparent reason. In\nturn, the collapsing problem is a limit case of interactions: the\ninterderivability between classical and intuitionistic implication\n(nothing else than two interaction laws between different connectives)\nis also spontaneously created by the combination process. \nIt can be argued that the combined logics are excessively strong in\nsuch cases, because they derive too many propositions in the new\ncombined language. \nOn the other hand, the opposite (or dual) situation may also be\nproblematic: suppose, to help intuition, that the logic of classical\nnegation is combined with the logic of classical disjunction. These\nlogics can be presented, for instance, axiomatically (through Hilbert\ncalculi) or semantically, say, through valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)\n(that is, by means of classical truth-tables). The semantical\npresentation of the logic of classical negation consists of the set of\nall valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) satisfying the following clause:\n\n\\[v(\\neg\\varphi)=0 \\textrm{ iff } v(\\varphi)=1.\\]\n\n On the other hand, the logic of classical disjunction can\nbe characterized by the set of all valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) such\nthat: \n\n\\[v(\\varphi \\vee \\psi)=0  \\textrm{ iff } v(\\varphi)=0 \\textrm{ and  } v(\\psi)=0.\\]\n\n  \nAs a consequence, the combined logic of negation and disjunction\n(which can be defined as the logic over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\)\ncharacterized by the valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) satisfying both\nclauses above) validates \\((\\varphi \\vee \\neg \\varphi)\\), and so\nclassical logic is recovered. This is the result obtained by the\ncombination method called direct union of matrices,\nintroduced in Coniglio and Fernández 2005. However, if\nalgebraic fibring is considered in categories such as those of Hilbert\ncalculi or consequence relations, the combination between the logic of\nnegation and the logic of disjunction results in a logic defined over\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) which is weaker than classical logic: the\ninteraction law \\((\\varphi \\vee \\neg \\varphi)\\) is no longer valid.\nThat is, an arguably desirable interaction between the connectives is\nlost in the combination process, and classical logic expressed over\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) cannot be recovered from its fragments, as long\nas algebraic fibring in these categories of logics is used. \nAnother example of the same kind is the following: the algebraic\nfibring between the logic of classical negation \\(\\neg\\) and the logic\nof classical implication \\(\\to\\) regarded in the categories above does\nnot recover classical logic expressed over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\to\\).\nIndeed, the resulting logic system, defined over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\to\\),\ncannot validate Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet when\npresented as an axiom: \n\n\\[\\not\\vdash(\\varphi \\to(\\neg\\varphi \\to \\psi)).\\]\n\n  \nInterestingly enough, Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet,\npresented as a derivation, holds in the fibred logic: \n\n\\[\\varphi, \\neg\\varphi \\vdash \\psi.\\]\n\n \nObserve that \\((\\varphi \\to(\\neg\\varphi \\to \\psi))\\) is an interaction\nrule between the connectives of the logics being combined which cannot\nbe obtained by algebraic fibring in the categories under consideration\n(however, this principle can be recovered, e.g., by direct union of\nmatrices). If one is interested in recovering a logic from its\nfragments, this result is disappointing.   \nConcerning the study of the expressive power of the combination of \nfragments of classical logic mentioned above, both at the axiomatic \nlevel, as well as considered as subalgebras of the 2-valued Boolean \nalgebra, Rautenberg obtained several interesting results in Rautenberg \n1981. One of his main contributions was the proof that any 2-valued matrix \ncan be effectively axiomatized. In turn, the  question of combination \nof fragments of classical logic by fibring was additionally investigated \nin Caleiro et al 2019, based on the description of \nthe 2-valued clones made in Post 1941, on the axiomatization \nprocedures for 2-valued matrices introduced in Rautenberg 1981, and \non the results on fibring (N)matrices presented in Marcelino and \nCaleiro 2017b (see subsection 4.3). \nIn particular, the  paper studied the\nconditions under which the fibring of the Hilbert calculi of disjoint\nfragments of classical logic recovers the union of the fragments. \nSeveral examples of combinations by fibring of the logics of classical \nconnectives were analyzed, obtaining their characterizations by \n(N)matrices, as well as the additional inference rules (bridge principles) needed \nfor recovering the corresponding fragment of classical logic. Among \nseveral examples, it was shown that the fibring of two copies of the logic \nof classical conjunction collapses into the logic of a single conjunction. \nOn the other hand, neither the combination of two copies of the logic of the \nclassical negation nor the combination of two copies of  the logic of the \nclassical disjunction produces an analogous collapse: the fibring of two \ncopies of the logic of \nclassical negation is not finite-valued, but can be characterized by a \n5-valued Nmatrix; and the fibring of two copies of the logic of classical \ndisjunction cannot be characterized by a single finite-valued Nmatrix. \nBy analyzing once again the combination by fibring of the logic of \nclassical disjunction and the logic of classical conjunction (that is, \nthe least conservative extension of both logics) it was shown that the \ncombined logic cannot be characterized by a single finite-valued Nmatrix. \nThe same happens with the fibring of the logic of classical disjunction \nand the logic of classical negation, thus showing that the fibred logics \nare strictly subclassical in both cases. \nThese examples, as well as other along the same lines, suggest a\nproblem dual to that of collapsing and distributivity between\nconjunction and disjunction: some expected interaction laws fail to be\ncreated by some combination processes. \nIn such cases, it could be said that the combined logics are too weak\nbecause they are unable to derive certain intended propositions in the\nnew combined language. \nWhat could be expected when combining logics? Strong logics\n(guaranteeing, for instance, that a logic can be recovered from its\nfragments) or weaker ones (in which undesirable interactions between\nconnectives are blocked)? \nThe examples above are evidence against and in favor of both\nsituations: in order to avoid del Cerro and Herzig’s collapsing problem, a careful\nsplicing process should be expected (and so the interaction between\nboth implications would disappear). On the other hand, if one wants to\nrecover, say, classical logic from some of its fragments, a more liberal\nsplicing process would be more appropriate as some intended\ninteractions between connectives of both logics would be\nrecovered. \nWith respect to the distributivity problem when combining conjunction\nand disjunction, the choice of method is also not determined:\ndistributivity could be a desired feature if we adopted the viewpoint\nof recovering a logic from its fragments. In this case, a combination\nmethod defining a stronger logic (such as the direct union of\nmatrices) would be more appropriate than, for instance, algebraic\nfibring of Hilbert calculi. But if, as argued in Beziau 2004,\ndistributivity is regarded as an intruder, then a more cautious\nprocess would be recommended: algebraic fibring of Hilbert calculi\nwould be more appropriate in this case. To sum up: the choice of the\nmost adequate combining process depends upon what one wants to\nobtain. \nAt this point, it is convenient to notice that the question about\nwhether or not interactive principles are generated when combining\nmodal logics, is intrinsically related to Hume’s ‘is-ought\nproblem’ discussed in\n section 1.\n Indeed, as proven in Schurz 1991, it is possible to obtain nontrivial\n‘is-ought’ deductions in the combination of alethic and\ndeontic logics provided that some bridge principles are allowed. The\nvalidity of bridge principles as \\(\\obcirc \\varphi \\rightarrow\n\\lozenge \\varphi\\) is nothing else than interaction rules between\nconnectives of the logics being combined. Such principles enjoy a\nsimilar conceptual status as the distributivity laws between\nconjunction and disjunction, or as the collapsing example mentioned\nabove. Thus, in order to satisfy Hume’s thesis, a combination\nprocess generating logics without interactions should be preferred. On\nthe other hand, a combination process allowing the creation of\ninteractions between the connectives could grant bridge principles\nviolating Hume’s thesis. \nFinally, it is noteworthy to observe that algebraic fibring does not\nintrinsically forbid the emergence of interactions between connectives\nof the logics being combined. In fact, the notion of morphism in the\ncategory of logic systems being employed is the key to creating or\nblocking interactions. In order to exemplify this assertion, consider\nthe case of the failure to recover classical logic from its\n\\(\\{\\neg\\}\\)-fragment and \\(\\{\\vee\\}\\)-fragment by algebraic fibring.\nFrom a proof-theoretic perspective, the key reason for this failure is that the rule \n\n\\[\n\\tag{* }\n\\frac{\\Gamma, \\varphi\\vdash \\psi \\;\\quad\\; \\Delta, \\neg\\varphi\\vdash \\psi}\n{\\Gamma, \\Delta\\vdash \\psi}\n\\]\n\n of the\nlogic of classical negation is not preserved by algebraic fibring in\ncategories of logic systems having translations between logics as\nmorphisms (recall\n subsection 4.4),\n such as the category of Hilbert calculi or consequence relations. \nWhen considering algebraic fibring of classical implication with\nclassical negation in those categories, the missing rule is the\nDeduction Metatheorem: \n\n\\[\\tag{**} \\frac{\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi}\n{\\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to\\psi)}.\\]\n\n  \nCategories of logic systems having logic translations as morphisms are\nsuch that the canonical injections of the coproduct are just inclusion\nmappings. Then, given two logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), the only rules of these logics which are preserved by\nalgebraic fibring are those of the form: \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi.\\]\n\n  \nOn the other hand, suppose that we are dealing with a category of\nlogic systems in which the preservation of rules such as \\((*)\\) or\n\\((**)\\) above is required by the very notion of morphism. Thus, if a\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is obtained as a combination of two other systems\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) then the rules of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) would be faithfully transferred to\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\). This is the proposal of Coniglio 2007, in which\nalgebraic fibring in categories of sequent calculi is investigated,\ntaking into account a notion of morphism which preserves logical rules\nof the form \n\n\\[\n\\textit{If  }\\;\\; \\Gamma_1\\vdash\\varphi_1 \\;\\;\\textit{ and  …  and  }\\;\\; \\Gamma_n\\vdash\\varphi_n \\;\\;\\textit{  then }\\;\\;\n\\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi.\n\\]\n\n  \nIn such categories, when a logic system is embedded into a larger one\nby algebraic fibring, any rule as above, which can be considered as a\nmeta-theorem of the logic, is preserved by the canonical injections.\nThis is why this process is called meta-fibring. From the\ncategorial point of view, the process is the same as for algebraic\nfibring, the only difference being that the notion of morphism is\nstronger. \nIn Coniglio and Figallo 2015, Coniglio and Figallo extended the idea\nof meta-fibring (that is, algebraic fibring of formal sequent calculi)\nto hypersequents, which allows preserving even stronger\nmeta-properties of the logics being combined. Hypersequents, which are\nfinite multisets of ordinary sequents, constitute a natural\ngeneralization of the proof-method of sequents and turn out to be a\nsuitable tool for presenting cut-free Gentzen-type formulations for\nseveral non-classical logics. \nThese examples illustrate the advantages of using category theory and\ntheir tools for defining combination procedures as universal\nconstructions: the same construction (in this case, algebraic fibring)\ncan be performed in categories of logic systems with different\nfeatures obtaining, as a consequence of this, stronger or weaker logic\nsystems.","contact.mail":"walter.carnielli@cle.unicamp.br","contact.domain":"cle.unicamp.br"},{"date.published":"2007-09-13","date.changed":"2020-07-30","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-combining/","author1":"Walter Carnielli","author1.info":"http://www.cle.unicamp.br/prof/carnielli/","author2.info":"http://www.cle.unicamp.br/prof/coniglio/","entry":"logic-combining","body.text":"\n\n\nThe subject of combinations of logics is still a young topic in\ncontemporary logic. Besides the pure philosophical interest offered by\nthe possibility of defining mixed logic systems in which distinct\noperators obey logics of different nature, as for instance erotetic\nlogics (the logical analysis of questions) which require combining\nepistemic and deontic logics, there also exist many pragmatical and\nmethodological reasons for considering combined logics. In fact, the\nuse of formal logic as a tool for knowledge representation in Computer\nScience frequently requires the integration of several logic systems\ninto a homogeneous environment.\n\n\nImportant questions in the philosophy of logic such as: “why are\nthere so many logics instead of just one?” (or even, instead of\nnone), as for instance, raised in Epstein 1995, can be naturally\ncounterposed by several other questions: if there are indeed many\nlogics, are they excluding alternatives, or are they compatible? Is it\npossible to combine different logics into coherent systems with the\npurpose of using them in applications and to shed some light on the\nproperties of complex logics? Moreover, if we can compose\nlogics, why not decompose them? And, if a logic is\ndecomposed into elementary sublogics, is it possible to recover it by\ncombining such fragments? What kind of properties of logics can be\ntransferred to their combinations? Questions of this kind have been\nonly partially tackled in the literature, and reflect challenges to be\nconfronted in the evolution of this topic.\n\n\nDavid Hume generated a popular controversy with his famous passages of\n“A Treatise of Human Nature” (see Hume 2000: Book 3, Part\n1, Section 1, paragraph 27) where he noted that sometimes people draw\nconclusions involving prescriptive statements of the form ‘ought\nto be’ on the basis of descriptive statements of the form\n‘what is’. Hume thinks that logic used in this way\ninvolves a dangerous change of subject matter. So, whether or not\n‘ought’ can be derived from ‘is’ has become\none of the central questions of ethical theory, and the majority of\ninterpreters hold that, for Hume, such a derivation is impossible. \nWith our point of view concerning combinations of logics, it is\nnecessary to investigate the properties of combining deontic and\nalethic logics: in order to perform such a jump from ‘is’\nto ‘ought’ some authors propose (see e.g., Schurz 1997)\nthat what is necessary is an explicit “bridge principle”\nwhich specifically connects ‘is’ and ‘ought’.\nAn axiom schema \\(X\\), following Schurz (1991), is a bridge principle\niff \\(X\\) contains at least one schematic letter which has at least\none occurrence within the scope of an \\(\\obcirc\\) (the deontic\n“obligation” operator) and at least one occurrence outside\nthe scope of any \\(\\obcirc\\). Thus, for instance, \n\n\\[p \\rightarrow \\obcirc p\\]\n\n is a\nbridge principle representing ‘is-ought’ that which would\nappease Hume’s criticism. On the other hand, the much discussed\nmoral principle ‘ought-implies-can’ (controversially\nattributed to I. Kant, see Baumgardt 1946) can be formalized through\nanother bridge principle: \n\n\\[\\obcirc p \\rightarrow \\lozenge p,\\]\n\n where \\(\\lozenge\\) denotes the\nalethic “possibility” operator. \nClearly, bridge principles do not solve any philosophical questions\nsuch as the ‘is-ought problem’; nonetheless, they\ncontribute to clarify the problem and to uncover hidden assumptions.\nThe idea of combining logics lend clarification to questions of this\nkind by making clear that, for instance, ‘is’ and\n‘ought’ are indeed independent notions. This is elucidated\nthrough a formal analysis of the composition of the logics involved\n(in this case, alethic and deontic) or by decomposition of the complex\nlogic (in this case, bimodal) into simpler ones. In such\ncircumstances, combining logics can be perceived as a tool for\nsimplifying problems involving heterogeneous reasoning. \nThe fact that ‘ought’ is not conveyed as a predicate, but\nas a modal operator ranging over actions or states of affairs, was\nresponsible for the delay of formal treatments of this centuries-old\nquestion. \nSuch a treatment was only possible after the development of general\nmodal logic. Indeed, what we are dealing with here is a bimodal logic,\nwhich is properly treated only after a deeper understanding of the\nsemantical subtleties of mixing alethic and deontic logics. Moreover,\naccording to some philosophers who have argued that it is not possible\nto link ‘is’ and ‘ought’ (that is, who defend\nHume’s thesis that no non-trivial ‘is-ought’\ndeductions are possible), it is mandatory to use combinations of\nfirst-order, alethic and deontic logics (see e.g., Stuhlmann-Laeisz\n1983 and Schurz 1997). \nA. Prior (1960), using the apparatus of contemporary modal logic,\ntried to characterize the distinction between normative and\nnon-normative sentences in formal terms, which enabled him to\ndefine senses of ‘descriptive content’ versus\n‘normative content’. A problem, however, occurs with mixed\nsentences, which have both descriptive and normative components, and\nPrior comes up with a paradox: wherever we draw the distinction\nbetween non-normative and normative sentences, unexpected inferences\nfrom non-normative premises to normative conclusions may appear by a\nmere use of laws of classical propositional logic. Consider, for\ninstance, the following two inferences: \nformalized as: \nand \nformalized as: \nIf the mixed sentence \\(\\texttt{d} \\vee \\obcirc \\texttt{s}\\) is\nconsidered to be normative, then (1) is an example of an\n‘is-ought’ inference, and if it is considered to be\nnon-normative, then (2) is an example of an ‘is-ought’\ninference. So, one of them dichotomically represents a violation of\nHume’s thesis in Prior’s terms. Prior concluded from this\nparadox that Hume’s ‘is-ought thesis’ is simply\nfalse (see Prior 1960: 206): one can simply derive\nconclusions which are ethical starting from premises which have no\nethical character. \nPrior recognized however that the inferences involved in the paradox\nare ethically irrelevant or trivial, but neither he nor later authors\ncould find a suitable definition of what it would mean by\n“ethical irrelevance” or “ethical triviality”\nattached to an inference. \nUsing the semantics of modal logics, objections against this\nconclusion can be raised, as for example in Karmo 1988, in the sense\nof separating statements between evaluative in some possible worlds\nand descriptive in others (while keeping their meaning). \nBy using concepts of combinations of languages and combinations of\nlogics, G. Schurz (see Schurz 1991; see also Schurz 1997) was able to\nstate a generalized Hume’s thesis (GH); as\nobserved in\n subsection 4.1,\n this treatment is in fact a fusion of two modal logics. In\n(GH) a mixed sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is derived from a set of\npurely descriptive sentences (i.e., sentences free of \\(\\obcirc\\))\nonly if \\(\\varphi\\) is completely \\(\\obcirc\\)-irrelevant (that is,\npredicates in \\(\\varphi\\) within the scope of \\(\\obcirc\\) can be\nreplaced by other predicates salva valididate). Moreover, it\nis proven that (GH) holds in an alethic-deontic first-order\nlogic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) if, and only if, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) can be\naxiomatized without bridge principles. \nThe notion of bridge principle lies in the scope of combination of\nlanguages. In general, many bridge principles can be made explicit\nwithin modal logic, and will be relevant for analyzing relationships\namong diverse modalities. For example, if we take necessity\n\\(\\square\\) and possibility \\(\\lozenge\\) as primitive operators, then\n\n\\[\\lozenge p \\to \\neg\\square\\neg p\\]\n\n is an intuitionistically acceptable bridge principle,\nwhile the converse is not. \nBesides Hume’s problem, another example of bimodal logic with\nintrinsic philosophical interest where bridge principles intervene is\nthe logic of physical and alethic modalities. In this logic, the\nlanguage permits the expression of two different notions of necessity:\nthe logical necessity, symbolized by \\(\\square\\), and the physical\nnecessity, symbolized by \\(\\boxdot\\). \nThe simplest connection between physical necessity and logical\nnecessity that comprises an acceptable philosophical meaning is given\nby the following bridge axiom: \n\n\\[\\quad\\square p\\to\\boxdot p\\]\n\n meaning that logical\nnecessity is stronger than physical necessity: anything that is\nlogically necessary is physically necessary. \nThe resulting logic KT\\(^{\\boxdot}\\) is axiomatized\nby the well-known axioms and rules of KT for both\nmodalities in addition to the bridge axiom above, and is semantically\ncharacterized by Kripke frames with two accessibility relations,\nrequiring that the accessibility relation for physical necessity is\nincluded in the other. \nNot only bimodal, but multimodal (also called polymodal) logics, are\nstandard in the literature: a typical case is the logic of knowledge\n(or epistemic logic), usually endowed with modal operators\n\\(K_{1},K_{2},\\ldots,K_{m}\\) representing the knowledge of \\(m\\)\nagents (or “knowers”). The formula \\(K_{i}\\alpha\\) means\n“agent \\(i\\) knows \\(\\alpha\\)”, and the language is able\nto express, for instance, “\\(i\\) knows that \\(j\\) does not know\nthat \\(i\\) knows \\(p\\)” by means of \\(K_{i}\\neg K_{j}K_{i}p\\).\nNo additional mixing principles are mandatory for the combined logic\nof many agents, but bridge axioms may, of course, be added. \nThe interest of studying combinations of logics may thus be seen as a\nreflex of the pluralist view of contemporary logical research. Indeed,\nthis kind of bridge axioms can, in principle, connect completely\ndistinct logics. Van Benthem (2006) suggests that combining logics may\nlead to the emergence of new phenomena, depending on the mode of\ncombination, and moreover, it may work as an inspiration (and perhaps\nas a model) for the study of combining epistemic notions. He even\nsuggests that the compartmentalization of logic into subfields as\n‘modal’, ‘temporal’, ‘epistemic’,\n‘doxastic’, ‘erotetic’ or\n‘deontic’ logic has been harmful to Philosophical\nLogic. \nCombinations of logics go in the opposite direction of such a\ncompartmentalization: considering that almost any conceptual task to\nbe analyzed involves immediate reasoning concerning necessity,\nobligation, action, time, verbal tense, knowledge, belief, etc.; from\na philosophical point of view, logical combinations may be the right\nway to look at philosophical issues within the theory of causation, of\naction, and so on. \nThe idea of looking at logic as an entirety avoiding fragmentation is\nnot new, and philosophers and logicians from Ramón Lull to\nGottfried W. Leibniz have thought of building schemes where different\nlogics or logic-like mechanisms could interact and cooperate instead\nof competing. In contemporary terms, the first methods for combining\nlogics were products of logics (introduced by K. Segerberg\n(1973) and independently by V. Šehtman (1978)), fusion\n(introduced by R. Thomason (1984)) and fibring (introduced by\nD. Gabbay (1996a)), all of them dedicated to combining only modal\nlogics. It is worth noting that M. Fitting (1969) gave early examples\nof fusion of modal logics, anticipating the notion of fusion. \nOther combination mechanisms followed, such as parameterization and\ntemporalization, which were more on the side of software\nspecification. \nMost of these methods have been encompassed in the algebraic\nfibring introduced by A. Sernadas, C. Sernadas and C. Caleiro\n(1999), which notoriously improved the versatility of these techniques\nby means of (universal) categorial constructions, in this way making\nit possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal\nlogics. \nOn the other hand, making heavy use of the language of category\ntheory, J. Goguen and R. Burstall introduced the notion of\ninstitutions as a kind of abstract model theory devoted to\napplications in Computer Science (see Goguen and Burstall 1984, 1992).\nInstitutions are also used as a mechanism for combining logics. \nHowever, combining logics does not only mean synthesizing or composing\nlogics, but can also yield interesting examples that go in the\nopposite direction of decomposing logics (see\n section 2).\n A paradigmatic methodology for decomposition is the\npossible-translations semantics, a notion proposed in\nCarnielli 1990 designed to help solve the problem of assigning\nsemantic interpretations to non-classical logics. Examples of\npossible-translations semantics illustrate how a complex logic can be\nanalyzed into less complex factors. Other techniques such as direct union of matrices and plain\nfibring (see Coniglio and Fernández 2005) can be\nconsidered to be methods for both composing and decomposing. \nAll of these methods open the way for a new subject in the realm of\ncombinations of logics: is it possible to decompose a given logic into\nelementary ones? In other words, are there prime logics\nwhich, combined in an appropriate way, may produce all (or part of)\nthe familiar logic systems? This question will be retaken in  \nsection 5 \nResults on combinations of logics may quickly become too technical\nwhen we turn to the combination of higher-order, modal, relevance\nlogics or non-truth-functional logics, and thus refinements of the\nnotion of algebraic fibring such as modulated fibring (see C.\nSernadas et al. 2002b) or cryptofibring (see Caleiro and\nRamos 2007) may be necessary to solve, for example, some collapsing\nproblems within combinations of logics (see\n section 5).\n This naturally leads to the use of category theory as a universal\nlanguage and as a tool to deal with such problems. But the fact is\nthat combinations of logics do not necessarily depend upon any highly\ntechnical methodology, and even some relatively simple examples can be\nreally expressive. There is a recognized intersection and interaction\nbetween Philosophy and theoretical Computer Science, and techniques\nfor combining logics are also revealed to be very apt tools for\nhandling and thus better understanding Kripke models. Having been\nintroduced in the domain of Philosophical Logic, Kripke models are\nessential in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence as semantic\nstructures for logics of belief, knowledge, temporal logics, logics\nfor actions, etc. Knowledge representation and reasoning may require\ncombining several reasoning formalisms, including combinations of\ntemporal reasoning, reasoning in description logic, reasoning about\nspace and distance, and so on. Logics, combining temporal and modal\ndimensions, are also becoming a relevant tool in agent-oriented\nprogramming languages. Other applications of combinations of logics\ninclude software specification, knowledge representation,\narchitectures for intelligent computing and quantum computing,\nsecurity protocols and authentication, secure computation and\nzero-knowledge proof systems, besides their connections to formal\nethics and game semantics. \nThe Belief-Desire-Intention model of agents (BDI) is concerned with\nthe formal representation of practical reasoning involving action,\nintention, belief, will, deliberation, goal-driven modeling, etc. This\nkind of reasoning is essential for planning (especially for artificial\nagents). It is then just natural to think about combining simple modal\nlogics for knowledge, belief, obligation, capability, opportunity,\netc., so as to define more robust BDI logics. Governatori et al. 2002\ninvestigates the relationships between BDI logics and a particular\ncase of Gabbay’s fibring semantics (see\n subsection 4.2)\n called dovetailing, showing that a (general) logical account\nof BDI can be handled by means of dovetailing multimodal logics. \nBut combinations of logics also work from another perspective: instead\nof directly combining logic systems and looking for the interpretation\nof the resulting system, one can start from a purely mathematical\nperspective. In van Benthem et al. 2006, for instance, the authors\nintroduce the notion of horizontal and vertical topologies on the\nproduct of topological spaces, and show that the modal logic of\nproducts of topological spaces with horizontal and vertical topologies\ncoincides with the fusion of S4 with itself. The resulting\ncompleteness proof has deep connections with some topological\nproperties of the real and of the rational numbers. \nIt is reasonable to expect that a method for combining logics would\nwork in two opposite directions: on the one hand, a logic that one\nwants to investigate could be decomposed into factors of lesser\ncomplexity; for instance, a bimodal alethic-deontic logic could be\ndecomposed into its alethic and deontic fragments. In this case, it\nwould be relevant to see if the logic under investigation is the least\nextension of its factors, or if additional bridge principles would\nhave to be added. This approach, in which a given logic is decomposed\ninto (possibly) simpler factors, is said to be a process of\nsplitting logics. \nOn the other hand, one might be interested in creating new logic\nsystems where different aspects are integrated, starting from given\nlogics. This demand typically occurs in software engineering and\nsecurity: knowledge representation, formal specification and\nverification of algorithms and protocols have a marked need for\nworking with several logics. In a less pragmatical scenery, this would\nbe the case if one is interested, for instance, in adding a modal\ndimension to an intuitionistic or a paraconsistent logic. Moreover, it\nis interesting to characterize which properties of the factors can be\ntransferred to the combined logic. This direction is said to be a\nprocess of splicing logics. \nThe essential distinctions between splicing (in the direction of\nsynthesis) and splitting (in the direction of analysis) take into\naccount the intentions one may have in mind, and consequently each\ndirection encompasses specifically designed techniques. \nThe paradigm of splicing logics assumes a bottom-up perspective: it\ncombines given logics, synthesizing them, and producing a new one. The\ncombined logic should be minimal in some sense: that is, if \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\) is obtained from \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) by some\ncombination process, it should be expected that: 1) \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nextends both \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\); and 2)\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is a minimal extension of both \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). For instance, some methods may require\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) to be the least conservative extension of both \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). This point will be discussed in\n section 5. \nOn the other hand, splitting a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) assumes a top-down\nperspective: logics are decomposed into (presumably simpler)\nfactors. \nIt should be stressed that most of the methods for combining logics\nfound in the literature are better understood from the splicing\nperspective, placing prominence on the creation of a logic system from\nfamiliar logics. However, some splicing methods such as fusion (see\n subsection 4.1)\n are more usefully regarded as a method of decomposition of logics\ninto simpler fragments, and in this way also work in the splitting\ndirection. Possible-translations semantics (see\n subsection 4.4),\n on the other hand, constitute a typical method within the splitting\nperspective. \nSuppose that two given logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\nare to be combined using some technique. It should be obvious that any\nmethod applied to combine \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) will\ncreate a new logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) which contains the\nsignature (logic symbols such as connectives, quantifiers,\npropositional variables etc.) of both logics: \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nwill be defined in a mixed language, which allows combinations of\nsymbols of the underlying languages. That is, a combination of logic\nsystems presupposes the previous combination of the respective\nsignatures. This is why the choice of the signature of the combined\nsystem is as important as the logic itself. For instance, the\ndefinition of the language of parameterization is fundamental in order\nto obtain the intended combined logic (see\n subsection 4.5).\n Another example is found in Schurz 1991, where the formal treatment\nof Hume’s ‘is-ought problem’ (recall\n section 1)\n presupposes careful handling of subtle combinations of languages. \nBesides the definition of the appropriate language for the combined\nlogic, another important question that immediately arises is: should\nthe logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) (to be combined) be\npresented in the same way? In other words: is it possible to combine\nlogics defined by different paradigms? For instance, how could one\ncombine a logic \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\), defined by a sequent calculus, with\na logic \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), represented by a (Hilbert-style) axiomatic\nsystem? How should the resulting logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) be represented:\nas a sequent calculus, as an axiomatic system or as a mixed proof\nsystem? Consider now another (even worse) situation: the logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) is described by semantical means (that is, through\nsemantic structures such as valuations or Kripke models) whereas the\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is presented through a syntactical proof\nsystem, such as a natural deduction system, sequent calculus or a\nHilbert-style axiomatization. Could the resulting (combined) logic be\nbetter presented semantically or syntactically? \nThis annoyance does not occur in the majority of cases, where the\nlogics being combined are complete with respect to some kind of\nsemantics and are syntactically presented in a homogeneous way.\nHowever, it may happen that the logics are found in peculiar ways; for\ninstance, linear logic and other substructural logics have no usual\nconsequence relations because derivations are exclusively displayed by\nusing multisets or sequences of formulas. Combinations of such logics\nwith usual modal logics, for instance, are not so obvious, although\nboth are complete. \nStill, there are logics which are only reasonably presented by\nsyntactical means, or exclusively by semantical means. Such is the\ncase, e.g., of the first-order theory of torsion groups, known to be\nnon-axiomatizable, and of incomplete modal logics which are only\npresented in syntactical (proof-theoretical) terms. \nA possible solution to the problem of combining heterogeneous logics,\nwhich naturally leads us to the deeper question of “what is a\nlogic?”, is to consider a common component of the majority of\nlogics (but still excluding certain substructural logics): their\nrespective consequence relations. Thus, given \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) presented in different ways, it is always possible to\nextract the respective consequence relations and then combine them\n(taking, for instance, their supremum in an appropriate lattice of\nconsequence relations). But in this way, the resulting logic \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\) is presented in a very abstract way: the only information\navailable from \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is its consequence relation, and so the\ncharacteristics and particularities of each logic component are\ndefinitively lost. \nReturning to the first example (combining a sequent calculus with an\naxiomatic system), a better solution was proposed in Cruz-Filipe et\nal. 2008: the idea is to define an abstract formalism for proof\nsystems, general enough as to encode the main proof mechanisms found\nin the literature. Thus, after reformulating \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) as abstract proof systems of this kind, the resulting\ncombined logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is an abstract proof system in which it\nis possible to recognize the ‘genetic traces’ of the\noriginal inference rules of each component within derivations in\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\). The latter question, namely, how to characterize\nderivations in a fibred logic in terms of the derivations of the\ncomponents, was carefully analyzed by S. Marcelino et al. in\na series of papers Marcelino et al. 2015; Marcelino and Caleiro \n2016; and Marcelino and Caleiro 2017a.  See\n subsection 4.3. \nDespite the above mentioned results on combining heterogeneous logics,\nit seems more reasonable to combine logics defined in a homogeneous\nway, and, in fact, this is the case with most of the proposals in the\nliterature. For instance, the usual combinations of modal logics (as\nfusion, product and fibring) are performed between systems presented\naxiomatically, or between classes of Kripke models. It is frequent,\ntherefore, to define different categories of logic systems\n(consequence relations, Hilbert calculi, algebraizable logics etc.)\nwith appropriate morphisms between them, in which the combination (or\ndecomposition) of logics appear as universal constructions. Algebraic\nfibring, to be described in\n subsection 4.3,\n is a good example of this approach. \nThe method of fusion of normal modal logics was introduced by\nR. Thomason (1984), and constitutes one of the first general methods\nfor combining logics. In the original formulation, it combines normal\nmodal logics presented syntactically and semantically (through\nHilbert-style axioms and Kripke semantics, respectively). The main\ncharacteristics of the method are described in the following\nparagraphs. \nConsider Kripke models of the form \n\n\\[\\langle W,R,V\\rangle\\]\n\n such that \\(W\\) is a\nnon-empty set (the set of worlds), \\(R\\subseteq W\\times W\\) is a\nbinary relation (the accessibility relation) and \\(V: \\mathbb{P} \\to\n\\wp W\\) from the set of propositional variables into the power set of\n\\(W\\) is a valuation map. Let \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) be\ntwo propositional normal modal logics defined over the same classical\nsignature which contains the connectives \\(\\neg\\) (negation) and\n\\(\\to\\) (implication). Denote by \\(\\square_1\\) and \\(\\square_2\\) the\nnecessity operators of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\),\nrespectively. Let \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\) be the classes\nof Kripke models for \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\),\nrespectively. Since both logics are normal, it is granted that both\nmodalities \\(\\square_1\\) and \\(\\square_2\\) satisfy the normality axiom\n\\(K\\) and the necessitation rule. The fusion of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is then defined to be the normal bimodal\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) with two independent boxes \\(\\square_1\\) and\n\\(\\square_2\\) together with the connectives \\(\\neg\\) (negation) and\n\\(\\to\\) (implication). The semantics of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is given by the\nclass \\({{\\cal M}}\\) of Kripke structures of the form \n\n\\[\\langle W,R_1,R_2,V\\rangle\\]\n\n such\nthat \\(\\langle W,R_1,V\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle W,R_2,V\\rangle\\) belong\nto \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\), respectively. In other\nwords, each structure of the fusion corresponds to a pair of models: a\nmodel \\(\\langle W,R_1,V\\rangle\\) for \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and a model\n\\(\\langle W,R_2,V\\rangle\\) for \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) sharing the same set\nof worlds \\(W\\). Technically speaking, each structure of the fusion\nhave, as a reduct, a model of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and a model of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\). \nGiven a structure \\(M=\\langle W,R_1,R_2,V\\rangle\\), the accessibility\nrelation \\(R_1\\) is used to evaluate the box \\(\\square_1\\), whereas\n\\(R_2\\) is used to evaluate \\(\\square_2\\). Since the language of\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is freely generated by the union of the signatures of\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), it contains mixed formulas such\nas \\(\\varphi = \\square_1(\\square_2 p \\to p)\\). Now, the structure\n\\(M\\) satisfies \\(\\varphi\\) above at a world \\(w \\in W\\) if and only\nif, for every \\(w_1 \\in W\\) such that \\(w R_1 w_1\\), \\(M\\) satisfies\n\\((\\square_2 p \\to p)\\) at \\(w_1\\). But this means that, either there\nexists \\(w_2\\) such that \\(w_1 R_2 w_2\\) and \\(w_2 \\not\\in V(p)\\), or\n\\(w_1 \\in V(p)\\). \nAs concerns axiomatics, a Hilbert calculus for \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nobtained by joining up the (schema) axioms of both systems. Thus,\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) has, among others, two \\(K\\) axioms, two necessitation\nrules and just one Modus Ponens (because implication \\(\\to\\)\nis shared). Considering that the language of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) has mixed\nformulas (as \\(\\varphi\\) above), schema variables occurring in the\nschema rules of the given logics can now be replaced in \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nby mixed formulas. For instance, \\(\\varphi\\) can be derived in\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) from the formula \\((\\square_2 p \\to p)\\) by an\napplication of the necessitation rule for the box \\(\\square_1\\). \nAn interesting example of fusion appears in Schurz 1991, when an\nalethic-deontic logic is defined by fusing a pure alethic logic with a\npure deontic logic. This combination is used to analyze Hume’s\n‘is-ought thesis’ (see\n section 1\n above) in formal terms. Other intuitively appealing examples of\nfusion are given in the pioneering paper Fitting 1969 by M. Fitting,\nwhere alethic and deontic modalities are fused (before the concept of\nfusion had ever been introduced). \nSince then fusion has been a much worked theme. Important results are\nthe applications of fusion to simulations and to the question of\ntransfer of properties among modal logics. Simulations make the\nstrength of normal monomodal logics explicit, as they can, in a sense,\nsimulate all modal logics (see Kracht and Wolter 1999). With respect\nto transfers, the preservation of properties such as completeness,\nfinite modal property, decidability and interpolation by fusion of\nmodal logics was extensively studied in Fine and Schurz 1996. More\ngeneral and deeper results in the same spirit were obtained in Kracht\nand Wolter 1991, and a survey of most of those results can be found in\nKracht and Wolter 1997. These results show the robustness of fusion as\na combination method within the scope of modal logics, for fulfilling\nthe requirement of preserving the properties of the logics being\ncombined. \nThe question of how completeness results (and other model-theoretical\nproperties) can be transferred from a propositional modal logic to its\nquantificational counterpart, and from a monomodal quantified modal\nlogic to their multimodal combinations by means of fusion, is\ninvestigated in Schurz 2011. The paper also deals with the question on\nhow completeness can be transferred from quantified modal logic with\nrigid designators to the ones with non-rigid designators. \nRasga et al. 2010 defines a categorical approach of fusion for modal\nlogic systems labelled with truth values, and it is shown that the\npreservation of completeness requires some careful assumptions, while\nsoundness is preserved without further provisos. A wide variety of\nlogics (besides modal logics) including several non-classical logics\ncan be treated in this way. \nAn interesting note is that there is a notable difference between\ncombining logics from the syntactical and from the semantical\nperspective. For instance, the joining of two Hilbert calculi should\nbe intuitively obtained by simply putting together the axioms and\nrules of both logics, while the semantical counterpart is not so\nobviously determined. Regarding this, an alternative to fusion is the\nfibred semantics (see\n subsection 4.2). \nFusion, even if it is a very natural method for combining modal\nlogics, however, is not obviously extendable to combinations of\nnon-normal modal logics with normal modal logics. Moreover, fusion is\nspecifically designed for combining modal logics, and cannot be\nextended in an obvious way to logics of a different nature. Algebraic\nfibring, described in\n subsection 4.3\n below, constitutes a generalization of fusion (at the propositional\nlevel), and generally solves the question of combining logics. \nAnother early method for combining (modal) logics is the so-called\nproduct of modal logics. This mechanism, independently\nintroduced in Segerberg 1973 and in Šehtman 1978, is\nappropriate to represent time-space information. Given two modal\nlogics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) as above, the product\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\times {{\\cal L}}_2\\) is the bimodal logic over the\nmixed signature (endowed with two boxes) characterized by the class of\nKripke structures of the form \n\n\\[\\langle W_1\\times W_2,S_1,S_2,V_1 \\times V_2 \\rangle\\]\n\n defined from Kripke models\n\\(\\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle W_2,R_2,V_2\\rangle\\) for\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), respectively. The accessibility\nrelations \\(S_1,S_2\\subseteq ( W_1 \\times W_2) \\times (W_1 \\times\nW_2)\\) are defined as follows: \n\\(\\langle u_1,u_2\\rangle S_1 \\langle w_1,w_2 \\rangle\\) iff \\(u_1 R_1\nw_1\\) and \\(u_2=w_2\\); \n\\(\\langle u_1,u_2\\rangle S_2 \\langle w_1,w_2 \\rangle\\) iff \\(u_2 R_2\nw_2\\) and \\(u_1=w_1\\); \n\\((V_1 \\times V_2)(p)=V_1(p) \\times V_2(p)\\). \nA somewhat surprising feature of the product of modal logics is that\nsome new interactions between modalities arise. These new valid\nformulas are a sort of bridge principles (recall\n section 1).\n Using the standard notation \\(\\lozenge_1 \\varphi\\) for \\(\\neg\n\\square_1 \\neg \\varphi\\) (and analogously for \\(\\lozenge_2\\)) for the\npossibility operator, the following bridge principles are always valid\nin the product logic: \n\\((\\lozenge_1\\lozenge_2 p \\to \\lozenge_2\\lozenge_1 p )\\) Commutativity\n1; \n\\((\\lozenge_2\\lozenge_1 p \\to \\lozenge_1\\lozenge_2 p )\\) Commutativity\n2; \n\\((\\lozenge_1\\square_2 p \\to \\square_2\\lozenge_1 p )\\) Church-Rosser\nproperty 1; \n\\((\\lozenge_2\\square_1 p \\to \\square_1\\lozenge_2 p )\\) Church-Rosser\nproperty 2. \nDue to such interactions it is not possible to directly obtain the\nHilbert calculus for the product of two modal logics, as in the case\nof fusion. The bridge principles must be explicitly added to the union\nof the original axiomatics in order to ensure completeness. \nIn general, the axiomatization of products of modal logics is a\ndelicate issue, and some interesting phenomena can arise.  For\ninstance, the two-dimensional modal product logic\nS5\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)S5 has a finite\naxiomatization but, for \\(n \\geq 3\\), the \\(n\\)-dimensional product\nlogic S5\\(^{n}\\) is non-finitely axiomatizable. In\nKurucz and Marcelino 2012 there were found the first examples of\ndecidable two-dimensional products of finitely axiomatizable modal\nlogics, such as\nK4.3\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)S5, which fail to\nbe finitely axiomatizable. These are examples of logics that fall prey\nto what we may call the finite crash phenomenon, where the\nfinite axiomatizability property is destroyed under the action of\nproducts.\n \nThe problem of finding a canonical axiomatization for non-finitely\naxiomatizable products of finitely axiomatizable logics was solved in\nHampson, Kikot, Kurucz and Marcelino 2020, by analyzing\ntwo-dimensional modal product logics involving the unimodal logic of\nthe difference Diff, introduced by von Wright 1979 as\nthe logic of ‘elsewhere’. This logic is defined by the set\nof unimodal formulas that are valid in all the frames \\(\\langle\nW,\\neq_{W}\\rangle\\), where \\(\\neq_{W}\\) is the non-identity relation\non a non-empty set \\(W\\); these frames are called difference\nframes. The logic Diff can be characterized as\nthe logic of all the frames \\(\\langle W,R\\rangle\\) where \\(R\\) is a\npseudo-equivalence relation, that is, where \\(R\\) is symmetric and\npseudo-transitive: if \\(R(x,y)\\) and \\(R(y,z)\\) then either \\(x=z\\) or\n\\(R(x,z)\\).  Since, in particular, equivalence relations are frames\nfor Diff, the latter is a sublogic of\nS5.  The paper proves that, despite\nDiff is a finitely axiomatizable subsystem of\nS5, the two-dimensional product logic\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff is\nnon-finitely axiomatizable, and can be axiomatized by infinitely many\nSahlqvist axioms. Let\nDiff\\(\\,\\times^{sq}\\,\\)Diff be the\n‘square’ version of\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff, which is\ncharacterized by the family of all the products \\(\\langle\nU,\\neq_{U}\\rangle \\times \\langle V,\\neq_{V}\\rangle\\) of difference\nframes such that the sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) have the same cardinality;\nhence Diff\\(\\,\\times^{sq}\\,\\)Diff\ncontains the logic\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff. The paper\nproves that the former is not a finite axiomatic extension of latter,\nand can be axiomatized by adding infinitely many Sahlqvist axioms.\nThe modal logics\nDiff\\(\\,\\times\\,\\)Diff and\nDiff\\(\\,\\times^{sq}\\,\\)Diff are the\nfirst examples of products of finitely axiomatizable modal logics that\nare not finitely axiomatizable, although axiomatizable by explicit\ninfinite sets of canonical (Sahlqvist) axioms.\n \nAs in the case of fusion, the technique of products of logics does not\nallow a direct generalization to logics other than modal ones. \nThe fibred semantics of modal logics was originally proposed\nin Gabbay 1996a and Gabbay 1996b (see also Gabbay 1999).\nAs in the case of fusion and products, the mechanism of fibring also\napplies to modal logics only. Assume the same notation as in\n subsection 4.1.\n Thus, given \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), we start by\ndefining the fibred language (or the fibring of the languages), which\nis the language generated by \\(\\square_1\\), \\(\\square_2\\), \\(\\neg\\)\nand \\(\\to\\) from the propositional variables. The basic idea is to\nconsider Kripke models with distinguished (actual) worlds together\nwith two transfer mappings: \\(h_1\\) from the set of worlds of the\nclass of models \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) into the class of\nmodels \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), and \\(h_2\\) from the set\nof worlds of the class of models \\({{\\cal M}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\ninto the class of models \\({{\\cal M}}_1\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\). When a\nKripke model of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) has to evaluate a formula of the form\n\\(\\square_2 \\varphi\\) at the actual world \\(w_1\\), the validity\nchecking is then transferred to the validity checking of \\(\\square_2\n\\varphi\\) within the Kripke model \\(h_1(w_1)\\) at its actual world.\nThe evaluation of a formula of the form \\(\\square_1 \\varphi\\) within a\nKripke model of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) at the actual world \\(w_2\\) is\nperformed analogously, but now using the map \\(h_2\\). \nThus, the fibring (or fibring by functions, as it is called\nin Carnielli et al. 2008) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is\na normal bimodal logic characterized semantically as follows: let and \nbe a pair of transfer mappings. For\nsimplicity, we assume that the sets of worlds \\(W_m\\) of \\(m\\in {{\\cal\nM}}_1\\) are pairwise disjoints, and the same holds for \\({{\\cal\nM}}_2\\). Given \\(m\\in {{\\cal M}}_1 \\cup {{\\cal M}}_2\\), \\(w\\in W_m\\)\nand a formula \\(\\varphi\\) in the fibred language, the satisfaction of\n\\(\\varphi\\) in \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\), denoted by \\(\\langle\nh_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\), is defined recursively as usual\nwhenever the main connective of \\(\\varphi\\) is Boolean (\\(\\neg\\) or\n\\(\\to\\)), or when \\(\\varphi\\) is atomic. For the modalities,\nsatisfaction is defined as follows: suppose (without loss of\ngenerality) that \\(m \\in {{\\cal M}}_1\\), and let \\(h_1(w)=\\langle\nm_2,w_2\\rangle\\), with \\(m=\\langle W_m,R_m,V_m\\rangle\\) and\n\\(m_2=\\langle W_{m_2},R_{m_2},V_{m_2}\\rangle\\). Then: \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\square_1\\varphi\\)\n\niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w_1\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\), for every \\(w_1\\)\nsuch that \\(w R_m w_1\\); \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\square_2\\varphi\\)\n\niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m_2,w_2\\rangle\\Vdash \\square_2\\varphi\\)\n\niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m_2,w_3\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\), for every\n\\(w_3\\) such that \\(w_2 R_{m_2} w_3\\). \nThe definition of \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash\n\\square_i\\varphi\\) for \\(i=1,2\\) and \\(m \\in {{\\cal M}}_2\\) is\nanalogous. \nThen, \\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle\\) satisfies \\(\\varphi\\), denoted by\n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle \\Vdash \\varphi\\), if \\(\\langle\nh_1,h_2,m,w\\rangle\\Vdash \\varphi\\) for every \\(m\\in {{\\cal M}}_1 \\cup\n{{\\cal M}}_2\\) and \\(w\\in W_m\\). Finally, \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in the\nfibred semantics whenever \\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle \\Vdash \\varphi\\)\nfor every pair \\(\\langle h_1,h_2\\rangle\\) as above. \nFor instance, given \\(h_1, h_2\\) as above, let \\(\\langle\nW_2,R_2,V_2\\rangle \\in {{\\cal M}}_2\\) and \\(w_2\\in W_2\\) such that\n\\(h_2(w_2)= \\langle \\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle,w_1\\rangle\\). Then: \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W_2,R_2,V_2\\rangle,w_2\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_1 \\square_2 \\neg p\\) \niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle,w_1\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_1 \\square_2 \\neg p\\) \niff \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\\rangle,w'_1\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_2 \\neg p\\), for every \\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\). \nSuppose that \\(h_1(w'_1)= \\langle \\langle\nW'_2,R'_2,V'_2\\rangle,w'_2\\rangle\\). Then, the latter is valid iff \n\\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle W'_2,R'_2,V'_2\\rangle,w'_2\\rangle \\Vdash\n\\square_2 \\neg p\\), \nfor every \\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\); i.e., for every\n\\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\) and for every \\(w''_2\\) such that\n\\(w'_2 R'_2 w''_2\\), \\(\\langle h_1,h_2,\\langle\nW'_2,R'_2,V'_2\\rangle,w''_2\\rangle \\Vdash \\neg p\\). This is equivalent\nto saying that, for every \\(w'_1\\) such that \\(w_1 R_1 w'_1\\) and for\nevery \\(w''_2\\) such that \\(w'_2 R'_2 w''_2\\), \\(w''_2 \\not\\in\nV'_2(p)\\). \nWith respect to axiomatics, the logics obtained by fibring by\nfunctions can, in some cases, be axiomatized by the union of the\n(schema) axioms of the given logics. But some logics may require the\naddition of some new bridge principles (mixing rules and axioms) in\norder to ensure the preservation of completeness. This may explain\nsome discrepancy between the approaches of fusion and fibring; the\ncompleteness of fibring as exposed in Gabbay 1999 does not work\nexactly as a substitute for more technically intricate completeness\nproofs as in Kracht and Wolter 1991 and in Fine and Schurz 1996. For\nmore on this discussion, see Kracht 2004. \nThe technique of fibring by functions is an interesting alternative to\nfusion and products, but, as much as its competitors, it cannot be\nextended to non-modal logics in any obvious way (see Coniglio and\nFernández 2005 for an adaptation of the method of fibring by\nfunctions to matrix logics). One reason for the failure of fibring by\nfunctions to what concerns generalizations is that it is not a\nuniversal construction (in categorial terms). Moreover, the lack of a\nsystematic definition of the axiomatization for the logics obtained by\nfibring is another negative aspect of this technique. The next\nsubsection describes a categorial generalization of fibring which\nsolves all the mentioned problems. \nIn order to overcome the limitations of the original method of fibring\nas exposed in the last subsection, A. Sernadas and collaborators\npropose, in Sernadas et al. 1999, a general definition of fibring\nusing the conceptual tools of category theory. The central idea of the\ngeneralization is simple: suppose that \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\) are two propositional logics which are to be combined.\nSuppose, for simplicity, that no connectives are to be shared, that\nis, the language of the logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) to be obtained is the\nfree combination of the connectives of both logics. In categorial\nterms, the signature \\(C\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the coproduct\n(disjoint union) of the signatures \\(C_1\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\(C_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), in the underlying category of signatures.\nThen \\({{\\cal L}}\\), which is the least logic defined over\n\\(C\\) which extends simultaneously \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), is defined as the coproduct of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\) in the underlying category of logics. The minimality of\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) attends a criterion expressed in Gabbay 1999 (see also\n section 5)\n and also conforms to the ideal of fusing logics, see Kracht and\nWolter 1991. This combination process, called unconstrained\nfibring, can be generalized, by allowing \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) to\nshare some connectives. Thus, the logic obtained by this second kind\nof fibring is defined in a language such that some connectives of\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are identified. The logic\nproduced by this operation, called constrained fibring,\nstarts by considering two logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\nover signatures \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\), respectively, and a signature\n\\(C_0\\) contained in both \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\). This signature contains\nexactly the connectives of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) which\nare to be identified (or shared) throughout the combination process.\nAfter computing the unconstrained fibring (that is, the coproduct)\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), which is defined over the signature \\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\) (the\ncoproduct of \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\)), a new logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nobtained. This logic, the fibring of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\) by sharing (or constrained to) \\(C_0\\), is\nobtained from \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) by identifying two\nconnectives (of the same arity) iff both come from the same connective\nin \\(C_0\\). In terms of category theory, it is required that the\nforgetful functor \\(N\\) from the category of logics to the category of\nsignatures be a cofibration. Then, if \\(i_j:{{\\cal C}}_0\\to C_j\\) is\nthe inclusion morphism (for \\(j=1,2\\)), \\(h_j:C_j \\to C_1 \\oplus C_2\\)\nis the canonical injection of the coproduct (for \\(j=1,2\\)) and\n\\(q:C_1 \\oplus C_2 \\to C\\) is the coequalizer of \\(h_1 \\circ i_1\\) and\n\\(h_2 \\circ i_2\\), then the constrained fibring \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the\ncodomain of the cocartesian lifting of \\(q\\) by \\(N\\). \nIn order to exemplify the technique of categorial fibring (without\nentering into technical details), suppose that \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are two modal logics defined through Hilbert calculi\nover the same signatures \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) of subsections\n 4.1\n and\n 4.2,\n respectively, such that both logics contain the rules of Modus\nPonens and necessitation. Then \\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\) consists of two\nnegations \\(\\neg_1\\) and \\(\\neg_2\\), two implications \\(\\to_1\\) and\n\\(\\to_2\\) and two boxes \\(\\square_1\\) and \\(\\square_2\\). The\nunconstrained fibring \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is, therefore, the Hilbert calculus over\n\\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\) defined by joining up the axiom schemas and\ninference rules of both calculi. This logic has, among other axioms\nand inference rules, two versions of Modus Ponens (one for\neach implication) as well as two versions of the necessitation rule\n(one for each box). It should be noted that, by using a fixed set of\nschema variables for writing the axioms and rules of every calculus,\nthe calculi obtained by fibring are also formed by schematic axioms\nand inference rules. Thus, for instance, in the rule of Modus\nPonens in \\({{\\cal L}}\\): \n\n\\[\\frac{\\xi_1 \\hspace{1cm} (\\xi_1 \\to_1 \\xi_2)}{\\xi_2}\\]\n\n the schema variables\n\\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi_2\\) can be replaced by mixed formulas. Instances\nsuch as \n\n\\[\\frac{\\neg_2 p \\hspace{1cm} (\\neg_2 p \\to_1 \\square_2(q \\to_2 \\square_1 r))}{\\square_2(q \\to_2 \\square_1 r)}\\]\n\n are new, because the formulas \\(\\neg_2 p\\) and\n\\(\\square_2(q \\to_2 \\square_1 r)\\) do not belong to the language of\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\). Analogous replacements apply, of course, to other\ninference rules and axioms of \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal\nL}}_2\\). \nContinuing with this example, suppose now that we want to share (or\nidentify) both negations, as well as both implications: this is a\nreasonable move when, for instance, these connectives are classic. In\nsuch case \\((\\varphi \\to_1 \\neg_2 \\psi)\\) would represent the same\nproposition as \\((\\varphi \\to_2 \\neg_1 \\psi)\\). \nIn order to do this, the signature \\(C_0\\) just containing \\(\\neg\\)\nand \\(\\to\\) is taken into consideration, and so \\(\\neg_1\\) is\nidentified with \\(\\neg_2\\) in \\(C_1 \\oplus C_2\\), as well as \\(\\to_1\\)\nis identified with \\(\\to_2\\). The resulting signature is \\(C\\), which\njust contains the connectives \\(\\neg\\), \\(\\to\\), \\(\\square_1\\) and\n\\(\\square_2\\). In the resulting logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\), defined over\n\\(C\\), there is now just one rule of Modus Ponens: \nHowever, there remain two necessitation rules, since\nthere are still two boxes in \\(C\\). The resulting \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nthus the fibring of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) constrained\nby \\(C_0\\). This procedure precisely coincides with fusion of modal\nlogics. The novelty here is that this technique applies to a broad\nclass of logics, which are not necessarily restricted to (normal)\nmodal logics, as in the case of fusion. \nConstrained and unconstrained fibring, being categorial, are universal\nconstructions, and so enjoy well-defined and theoretically predictable\nformal properties. Profiting from universal constructions, in order to\nhandle algebraic fibring, it is enough to define appropriate\ncategories of signatures and logic systems. Indeed, the same\nfibring construction (coproduct or cocartesian lifting) can be\nperformed in different categories of logic systems. This is a\nremarkable advantage of the categorial perspective for fibring. There\nare several proposals in the literature devoted to combining logics\npresented in different ways by means of algebraic fibring:\npropositional Hilbert calculi, sequent and hypersequent calculi,\nfirst-order modal logics, higher-order modal logics,\nnon-truth-functional logics, logics semantically presented through\nordered algebras (encompassing generalized Kripke models) etc. \nAn important question connected to combination of logics (and, in\nparticular, to algebraic fibring) is the preservation of\nmetaproperties such as completeness, interpolation etc. For instance,\nwhen \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are complete logic systems\npresented both semantically and syntactically, under which condition\nis their fibring also complete? In this regard, Zanardo et al. 2001\nand Sernadas et al. 2002a give a partial solution to this question.\nThe preservation of soundness and completeness with respect to the\ntechnique of importing logics (see\n subsection 4.6) \nwas proved in Rasga et al. 2013. Besides, in a series of papers\n(Marcelino et al. 2015, Marcelino and Caleiro 2016, and\nMarcelino and Caleiro 2017a), S. Marcelino et al. study the\npreservation of decidability by unconstrained fibring (that is, by\nalgebraic fibring without sharing connectives). The key result is a\ngeneral characterization of the derivations in the system obtained by\nfibring in terms of the derivations in each component. The complexity\nof the decision procedures was also analyzed in these papers. Thus, it\nwas shown that the decision problem for the fibred logic can be\nreduced polynomially to the worst decision problem of the given\nlogics. This means that, in particular, if the decision problems for\ntwo given logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) are both in a\ncomplexity class \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) then the decision problem for the\nunconstrained fibring \\({{\\cal L}}_1 \\oplus {{\\cal L}}_2\\) is also in\n\\(\\mathcal{C}\\), provided that \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) contains the basic\ncomplexity class P (also known as PTIME) and is closed for\ncomposition with polynomials. Other examples of preservation of\nmetaproperties are provided by the mechanism for combining logics\nknown as meet combination of logics, introduced by Sernadas\net al. 2012 (see subsection\n4.6).  Specifically, the preservation of soundness and\ncompleteness (see Sernadas et al. 2012), Craig interpolation\n(see C. Sernadas et al.  2013 ) and admissibility of rules (see Rasga\net al. 2016) have been obtained for this method. On the other\nhand, transfer results have been extensively studied in the case of\nfusion of modal logics, as already mentioned in subsection 4.1. \nBesides the studies concerning preservation of metaproperties by\nfibring mentioned above, the semantics of fibred logics is not so easy\nto determine from the semantics of the components. That is, there is\nno natural correspondence between the models of the component logics\nand the class of models which characterizes the least logic in the\nmixed language which extends simultaneously the given logics, that is,\ntheir fibring. This question is far from being simple: for instance,\nin Marcelino and Caleiro 2017a it was shown that the act of fibring\ntwo logics, each of one being characterized by a single finite matrix,\ncan produce a logic which is uncharacterizable by a single matrix\n(even infinite). In Marcelino and Caleiro 2017b a first step towards\nthe solution of this problem was given, by characterizing the\nsemantics of unconstrained fibring of logics presented by means of\nnondeterministic matrix semantics.  Nondeterministic matrices\n(or Nmatrices) generalize logical matrices by allowing the connectives\nto be interpreted by multivalued truth-functions instead of ordinary\ntruth-functions. Nmatrices were formally introduced in Avron and Lev\n2001 (see also Avron and Lev 2005) to provide a semantical account for\nlogics uncharacterizable by a single finite matrix. However, the use\nof Nmatrices for logics was already considered by several authors\n(Rescher 1962; Ivlev 1973, 1985, 1988 and Kearns 1981 in the context\nof modal logics; and Crawford and Etherington 1998). By using two\ndifferent notions of product of Nmatrices, in Marcelino and Caleiro\n2017b it is shown that the disjoint fibring of two propositional\nlogics, each of one presented by a single Nmatrix, is characterized by\na single Nmatrix obtained from the given ones by using these\nproducts. This encompasses the fibring of logics presented by\nmatrices, since every logical matrix is, in particular, a\nnon-deterministic matrix. \nThe relationship between fusion and algebraic fibring deserves some\ncomments. When restricted to modal propositional logics, fusion is a\nparticular case of algebraic fibring in the category of interpretation\nsystems, where logics are presented through ordered algebras: it is\nenough to consider interpretation systems defined over power set\nalgebras induced by Kripke models. At the syntactical level, fusion is\nalso a particular case of algebraic fibring in the category of Hilbert\ncalculi, in the realm of propositional signatures. As much as\nfirst-order modal logics are concerned, the approaches diverge, mainly\nbecause there are different semantical accounts for treating\nfirst-order modalities. For instance, the semantical approach to modal\nfirst-order logics by Sernadas et al. 2002a in the context of\nalgebraic fibring differs from that of Kracht and Kutz (2002) in the\ncontext of fusion. \nThe fact that algebraic fibring generalizes (at least at the\npropositional level) the fusion of modal logics makes the former\nmethod become very natural and useful. Moreover, the universality of\nthe construction allows one to define algebraic fibring in very\ndifferent logical contexts (categories of logics), such as\nnon-truth-functional logics, higher-order logics, sequent calculi etc.\nAs it will be shown in\n section 5,\n the different notions of morphisms between logics affect the strength\nof the logics obtained by algebraic fibring in the different\ncategories of logic systems. For general accounts of algebraic fibring\nsee, for instance, Caleiro et al. 2005 and Carnielli et al. 2008. \nThe methods for combining logics described above adhere to the\nsplicing methodology: they are used to combine logics creating new\nsystems which extend the given logics. \nAs mentioned in\n section 2,\n there is a converse direction: the splitting methodology in which a\ngiven logic system is decomposed into other systems. The\npossible-translations semantics (in short, PTS),\nintroduced in Carnielli 1990 (see also Carnielli 2000), is one of the\nfew supporters of this viewpoint. \nThe notion of PTS was originally defined as an attempt to\nendow certain logics with recursive and palatable semantic\ninterpretations. Actually, several paraconsistent logics which are not\ncharacterizable by finite matrices can be characterized by suitable\ncombinations of many-valued logics. The idea of the decomposition is\nquite natural: given a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\), presented as a pair\n\\({{\\cal L}}=\\langle C,\\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\rangle\\) in which \\(C\\) is a\nsignature and \\(\\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\) is a consequence relation, a\nfamily of translations \\(f_i:L(C) \\to L(C_i)\\) (for \\(i\\in I\\)) is\ntaken into consideration. Here, \\(L(C)\\) and \\(L(C_i)\\) denote the\nalgebra of formulas defined by the signature \\(C\\) and \\(C_i\\),\nrespectively. Recall that a translation from a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\ninto a logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\) is a mapping \\(f\\) between the respective\nsets of formulas which preserve derivability, that is: \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\varphi\\) (in the source logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\))\nimplies that \\(f(\\Gamma) \\vdash_{{{\\cal L}}'} f(\\varphi)\\) (in the\ntarget logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\)). \nA pair \\(P=\\langle \\{{{\\cal L}}_i\\}_{i\\in I}, \\{f_i\\}_{i\\in\nI}\\rangle\\) as above is called a possible-translations frame\nfor \\({{\\cal L}}\\). We say that \\(P\\) is a\npossible-translations semantics for \\({{\\cal L}}\\) if, for\nevery \\(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\}\\subseteq L(C)\\), \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{{\\cal L}}\\varphi \\\n\\textrm{ iff } \\ f_i(\\Gamma) \\vdash_{{{\\cal L}}_i} f_i(\\varphi), \\\n\\textrm{ for every  } i \\in I.\\]\n\n This means\nthat checking derivability in \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is equivalent to checking\nderivability in every factor logic \\({{\\cal L}}_i\\) through the\ntranslations. In many cases, the factor logics \\({{\\cal L}}_i\\) are\npresented by finite matrices. Since the length of a formula is finite,\nit is enough to test a finite number of translations in order to\ndetermine if a formula of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is valid in \\({{\\cal L}}\\).\nThus, checking the validity of a formula of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is\nequivalent to performing a finite number of finitary tests. This\ndecidability property is of real advantage when the original logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is not characterizable by finite matrices. For\ninstance, in Carnielli 2000 (see also Marcos 1999) the well-know\nhierarchy \\(\\{{{\\cal C}}_n\\}_{n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}\\) of paraconsistent\nlogics of N. da Costa, formed by logics which cannot be characterized\nby finite matrices, is represented by means of a PTS whose\nfactors are presented through finite matrices; this grants a decision\nprocedure for each logic \\({{\\cal C}}_n\\). \nIn order to exemplify the concept of PTS as a splitting\nmethodology, consider the paraconsistent logic bC,\nintroduced in Carnielli and Marcos 2002. This logic is, in particular,\na logic of formal inconsistency (LFI), in\nthe sense that there exists a unary connective \\(\\circ\\) expressing\nthe consistency of a formula. Thus, from \\(\\varphi\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\varphi\\) does not follow, in general, an arbitrary formula\n\\(\\psi\\). However, \\(\\{\\varphi, \\neg\\varphi, \\circ\\varphi\\}\\) entails\nany formula \\(\\psi\\). The signature \\(C\\) of bC\nconsists of a paraconsistent negation \\(\\neg\\), a consistency operator\n\\(\\circ\\), and classical connectives \\(\\wedge,\\vee,\\to\\). It was\nproved in Carnielli et al.  2007 that bC, and\nmany other logics of formal inconsistency extending it, cannot be\ncharacterized by finite matrices. Nonetheless, bC is\ndecomposed into several copies of a three-valued logic by means of\npossible-translations as follows: consider the signature\n\\(C_1=\\{\\neg_1,\\neg_2,{\\circ}_1,{\\circ}_2, {\\circ}_3,\n\\wedge,\\vee,\\to\\}\\) consisting of two negations, three consistency\noperators, a conjunction, a disjunction and an implication. Let \\(M\\)\nbe the matrix over \\(C_1\\) with domain \\(\\{T,t,F\\}\\) displayed below,\nwhere \\(\\{T,t\\}\\) is the set of designated values. \nLet \\(\\{f_i\\}_{i\\in I}\\) be the family of all the mappings \\(f:L(C)\\to\nL(C_1)\\) satisfying clauses \\((tr0)\\), \\((tr1)\\), \\((tr2)\\), \\((tr3)\\)\nand \\((tr4)\\) below. \nThe family of mappings \\(\\{f_i\\}_{i\\in I}\\) can be shown to define a\nPTS which characterizes bC in a decidable\nway (see Carnielli et al. 2008). As an example, it can be easily\nchecked that \\(\\varphi\\wedge\\neg\\varphi\\to\\neg{\\circ}\\varphi\\) is a\ntheorem of bC: just consider all its finitely many\ntranslations and test that all of them are three-valued tautologies.\nOn the other hand, \\(\\neg(\\varphi\\wedge\\neg\\varphi)\\to{\\circ}\\varphi\\)\nis not a theorem of bC, which can be promptly\nverified by showing that at least one of its translations is not a\ntautology using the three-valued tables above. For an alternative\nPTS characterization of bC and related\nlogics see Marcos 2008. \nThis example shows that a non-truth functional connective, such as the\nparaconsistent negation \\(\\neg\\) or the consistency operator \\(\\circ\\)\nof bC, can be mimicked by interpreting it (via\ntranslations) into different truth-functional connectives. The idea of\ninterpreting (or decomposing) a connective into simpler ones can be\nrelated to the notion of non-deterministic matrix semantics proposed\nby Avron and Lev, and mentioned in \nsubsection 4.3. \nIndeed, in Carnielli and Coniglio 2005 it is shown that\nnon-deterministic matrices can be simulated by appropriate\npossible-translations semantics. In particular, the familiar matrix\nsemantics are a particular case of possible-translations semantics, as\nwell as the historical examples of translations between logics found\nin the literature. These facts evidence that possible-translations\nsemantics is a widely applicable conceptual tool for decomposing\nlogics. \nApart from the logical and philosophical import of combining logics,\nthere is a genuine interest in developing applications based on these\ntechniques. One of the main areas interested in the methods for\ncombining logics is software specification. Certain techniques for\ncombining logics were developed almost exclusively with the aim of\napplying them to this area. In this section some of these methods will\nbe briefly mentioned: temporalization,\nparameterization and institutions. \nTemporalization was introduced in Finger and Gabbay 1992 (see also\nFinger and Gabbay 1996), and generalized in Caleiro et al. 1999\ntowards the method called parameterization. \nParameterization, in rough terms, consists of replacing the atomic\npart of a given logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) by another logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\).\nThus, the logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the parameterized logic;\nthe atomic part is the formal parameter and the logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}'\\) is the parameter logic. Formally, a mixed\nsignature based on the signature of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is considered, to\nwhich the formulas of \\({{\\cal L}}'\\) are added as constants. In the\nparticular case of temporalization, the parameter logic is a temporal\nlogic. In turn, it can be proven that parameterization is a particular\ncase of constrained fibring (recall\n subsection 4.3). \nThe method can be explained by means of a simple example taken from\nCarnielli et al. 2008: consider a propositional modal logic \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\), to be parameterized with first-order logic \\({{\\cal L}}_{fol}\\)\nin order to describe the dynamics of data bases. The resulting logic\nis defined in a language whose formulas are obtained by replacing\npropositional constants in formulas of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) by first-order\nformulas. That is, modalities can be freely used, but quantifiers\ncannot be applied to modal formulas (other propositional connectives\nsuch as negation and implication are shared). \nThe semantic structures for the new logic are Kripke structures where\nthe valuation for propositional constants is replaced by a kind of\n“zooming in” mapping (in the sense of Blackburn and de\nRijke 1997) associating a first-order semantic structure together with\na fixed assignment for individual variables to each state. \nThe deductive system for the new logic is formed by the rules of both\nlogics. The rules of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) can be instantiated with formulas\nof the parameterized language, but the rules of first-order logic can\nonly be applied to pure first-order formulas. \nOne important difference between parameterization (in particular,\ntemporalization) and constrained fibring is the degree of symmetry:\nthe parameterized language and inference rules are intrinsically\nasymmetric, while this is not the case of constrained fibring. \nInstitutions were introduced by J. Goguen and R. Burstall (see Goguen\nand Burstall 1984, 1992) as a kind of “abstract model\ntheory” for Computer Science, and are adequate for developing\nconcepts of specification languages such as structuring of\nspecifications and implementation. \nThe theory of institutions is mainly applicable to software\nspecification defined by multiple logical systems (see, for instance,\nDiaconescu and Futatsugi 2002). Thus, under an abstract view of\nsoftware development, different components of the same program can be\nspecified using different formalism in an heterogeneous setting. This\nis formalized by the use of institutions and morphisms between them\n(see, for instance, Tarlecki 2000). A problem concerning institution\nmorphisms is that formulas involving connectives from different logics\nbeing combined are not allowed. A solution to this problem was\nproposed in Goguen and Burstall 1986 and Mossakowski 1996, by using\nthe so-called parchments and parchment\nmorphisms. \nDespite the fact that algebraic fibring is suitable for combining an\nample class of logic systems, some kinds of logics, namely\nsubstructural logics such as linear logic, and logics equipped with a\nnondeterministic semantics, lie outside the scope of this combination\nmethod. Moreover, at the semantical level, algebraic fibring, by its\nown nature, does not make possible to keep representatives of all the\nmodels of the original logics (which leads to the collapsing\nproblem of fibring, see\n section 5). \nWith the aim of still enlarging the range of application of algebraic\nfibring, so as to make it able to deal with substructural logics and\nwith logics endowed with nondeterministic semantics, as well as to\ncombine pointwise models of each logic, a formalism for representing\nlogics and their combinations based on the general notion of\nmulti-graphs (or, for short, m-graphs) was proposed by A. Sernadas and\nhis collaborators (see Sernadas et al. 2009a, 2009b). Multi-graphs are\ngraphs where the source of each edge is a finite sequence of nodes\n(instead of a unique node). Concerning signatures, the nodes of the\nm-graph are seen as sorts and the m-edges are seen as language\nconstructors. From the semantical viewpoint, nodes are truth-values\nand m-edges are relations between truth-values. Finally, concerning\ndeductive systems, nodes are language expressions, and m-edges are\ninference rules. The fibring of logics described by m-graphs (a.k.a.\ngraph-theoretic fibring) is defined by pointwise combining\nmodels of each combined logic, in contrast to the usual notion of\nsemantic fibring in which entire classes of models are combined. This\nallows one to avoid the collapsing problem (see the next section) in a\nvery natural way. \nAs an immediate application of this graph-theoretic setting, the\npreservation of the finite-model property by graph-theoretic fibring\nwas proved in Coniglio et al. 2011. Since (under reasonable\nconditions) the finite model property entails decidability, this\nresult is particularly useful. \nAnother application to the graph-theoretic account of logic is the\ndefinition of an asymmetric combination technique called importing\nlogics (see Rasga et al. 2012). Temporalization, as well as its\ngeneralization, modalization (see Fajardo and Finger 2003 and\nFinger and Weiss 2002), are particular cases of importing logics.\nUnder this approach, the combined language is endowed with an explicit\nconstructor called importing connective which transforms\nformulas of the imported logic into formulas of the importing logic.\nThis is the main difference between the technique of importing logics\nand the related technique of parameterization (which also generalizes\ntemporalization, see\n subsection 4.5).\n Semantically, each model of the resulting logic obtained by the\nmethod of importing logics is a pair composed of a model of the\nimporting logic and a model of the imported logic, plus the\ninterpretation of the importing connective. In Rasga et al. 2014 a new\nformulation of algebraic fibring, called biporting, was\nintroduced, which turns out to be equivalent to the original one. From\nthis, it is possible to prove that some particular cases of importing,\nlike temporalization, modalization and globalization, are subsumed by\nfibring. \nA new mechanism for combining logics called meet combination of\nlogics was firstly presented in C. Sernadas et al. 2013 and\nadditionaly developed in Rasga et al. 2016. This technique is based on the idea of melding or pairing\nconnectives (of the same arity) of two given logics being\ncombined. The melded connectives of the resulting logic inherit the\ncommon properties enjoyed in both logics, instead of the union of\ntheir properties, as it occurs in the case of the shared connectives\nof constrained fibring. The idea of pairing connectives within a\nsingle logic was already explored in Sernadas et al. 2011a and 2011b,\ntowards identifying common properties of any given pair of connectives\nof the same arity. \nUp to this point, several techniques for composing logics have been\ndescribed and exemplified. Are these processes appropriate for\ncomposing, without surprises, any pair of logics? In other words,\ngiven a pair of logics (presented in a homogeneous way), are they\ncomposable in a meaningful way? Does the composition make\nphilosophical sense? As pointed by Schurz 1991, it is conceivable that\nsome multimodal logics obtained as combination of modal logics by\nadding arbitrarily chosen bridge principles could be meaningless. \nFrom the technical point of view there is an important problem\nconcerning composition of logics known as collapsing problem,\nfirstly identified in Gabbay 1996b, and later formalized in del Cerro\nand Herzig 1996. In the latter paper, it is shown that, by freely\ncombining classical propositional logic and intuitionistic\npropositional logic at the semantical level (technically: by\nconstructing their unconstrained fibring in the category of\ninterpretation systems, recall\n subsection 4.3)\n the resulting logic collapses to classical logic. More precisely, the\nresulting logic will consist of two twin copies of classical\npropositional logic, having two negations, two implications and so on.\nClearly, the respective copies of each connectives will be proved to\nbe inter-derivable in the resulting logic: \\(\\neg_1 \\varphi\\) will be\nequivalent to \\(\\neg_2\\varphi\\), \\((\\varphi\\to_1 \\psi)\\) will be\nequivalent to \\((\\varphi\\to_2 \\psi)\\) and so on. The collapse only\nhappens when considering the algebraic fibring at the semantical\nlevel: in Caleiro and Ramos 2007 was shown that the collapse does not\noccur when computing the algebraic fibring of the respective Hilbert\ncalculi. \nBasically, the phenomenon arises because both implications collapse,\nand then intuitionistic implication becomes classic. From the\nsemantical point of view, it happens that the models of the fibred\nlogic are Heyting algebras which are simultaneously Boolean algebras:\nevidently the algebras collapse to the Boolean ones. From the point of\nview of proof theory, the problem appears as a consequence of the\nmetaproperty called Deduction Metatheorem (DMT): let\n\\(\\to_1\\) and \\(\\to_2\\) be the intuitionistic and the classical\nimplications, respectively. Then \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  & \\textrm{ iff }&  \\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\\\\n\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  & \\textrm{ iff }&  \\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_2\\psi)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n Thus, the following\nargument applies (see Gabbay 1996b): \n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi) &  \\textrm{(Axiom)}\\\\\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi),\\,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  &  \\textrm{(DMT for } \\rightarrow_1) \\\\\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_2\\psi) &  \\textrm{(DMT for } \\rightarrow_2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n A similar argument\nshows that \\((\\varphi\\to_2\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\). That is,\nclassical and intuitionistic implications collapse in the combined\nlogic. \nIt is worth noting that the previous arguments depart from a very\nstrong assumption: that the metaproperty DMT is preserved in the\ncombined logic. As we shall see below, this is not the case for\nalgebraic fibring, unless a stronger notion of morphism between logics\nis adopted. \nIn C. Sernadas et al. 2002b other examples of collapse were presented,\nand a solution to the problem was proposed by means of a controlled\nnotion of algebraic fibring called modulated fibring. An\napparently simpler solution to the collapsing problem appeared in\nCaleiro and Ramos 2007, using a variant of the algebraic fibring\ntechnique called cryptofibring. As mentioned in\n subsection 4.6,\n the graph-theoretic fibring leads to an additional solution to this\nproblem. Another solution to the collapsing problem was obtained by\nmeans of the meet combination of logics (see\n subsection 4.6).\n Given that the combined connectives inherit the common properties\nenjoyed in both logics, the interaction between the component logics\nwithin the resulting logic is minimized, which allows to overcome the\ncollapsing problem. \nIndependently, in Beziau 2004 it was observed that by putting together\nthe sequent rules for classical conjunction and the rules for\nclassical disjunction, the resulting sequent calculus will\n(unexpectedly) prove the distributivity between conjunction and\ndisjunction. The same phenomenon occurs if we join the (two-valued)\nvaluation clauses for classical conjunction with the valuation clauses\nfor classical disjunction. However, this is avoided by considering\nalgebraic fibring in the usual categories (Hilbert calculi or\nconsequence relations) with translations between logics as morphisms:\nthe logic obtained is the logic of lattices, which does not satisfy\ndistributivity (see Beziau and Coniglio 2005, 2011). \nThis situation, in which new interaction rules between the connectives\narise, is arguably undesirable. In fact, it contradicts a basic\ncriterion of fibring (and also of fusion), as expressed in Gabbay\n1999: given logic systems \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), the\ncombination of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) should be the\nsmallest logic system in the combined language which is a conservative\nextension of both \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). \nIndeed, the distributivity problem and the collapsing problem are two\ninstances of the same phenomenon of emergence of unexpected\ninteractions (such as bridge principles) between connectives caused by\ncombination processes. In the case of combination of conjunction with\ndisjunction, the distributive law emerges: this interaction is due to\nthe combination process and appears without any apparent reason. In\nturn, the collapsing problem is a limit case of interactions: the\ninterderivability between classical and intuitionistic implication\n(nothing else than two interaction laws between different connectives)\nis also spontaneously created by the combination process. \nIt can be argued that the combined logics are excessively strong in\nsuch cases, because they derive too many propositions in the new\ncombined language. \nOn the other hand, the opposite (or dual) situation may also be\nproblematic: suppose, to help intuition, that the logic of classical\nnegation is combined with the logic of classical disjunction. These\nlogics can be presented, for instance, axiomatically (through Hilbert\ncalculi) or semantically, say, through valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)\n(that is, by means of classical truth-tables). The semantical\npresentation of the logic of classical negation consists of the set of\nall valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) satisfying the following clause:\n\n\\[v(\\neg\\varphi)=0 \\textrm{ iff } v(\\varphi)=1.\\]\n\n On the other hand, the logic of classical disjunction can\nbe characterized by the set of all valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) such\nthat: \n\n\\[v(\\varphi \\vee \\psi)=0  \\textrm{ iff } v(\\varphi)=0 \\textrm{ and  } v(\\psi)=0.\\]\n\n  \nAs a consequence, the combined logic of negation and disjunction\n(which can be defined as the logic over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\)\ncharacterized by the valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) satisfying both\nclauses above) validates \\((\\varphi \\vee \\neg \\varphi)\\), and so\nclassical logic is recovered. This is the result obtained by the\ncombination method called direct union of matrices,\nintroduced in Coniglio and Fernández 2005. However, if\nalgebraic fibring is considered in categories such as those of Hilbert\ncalculi or consequence relations, the combination between the logic of\nnegation and the logic of disjunction results in a logic defined over\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) which is weaker than classical logic: the\ninteraction law \\((\\varphi \\vee \\neg \\varphi)\\) is no longer valid.\nThat is, an arguably desirable interaction between the connectives is\nlost in the combination process, and classical logic expressed over\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) cannot be recovered from its fragments, as long\nas algebraic fibring in these categories of logics is used. \nAnother example of the same kind is the following: the algebraic\nfibring between the logic of classical negation \\(\\neg\\) and the logic\nof classical implication \\(\\to\\) regarded in the categories above does\nnot recover classical logic expressed over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\to\\).\nIndeed, the resulting logic system, defined over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\to\\),\ncannot validate Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet when\npresented as an axiom: \n\n\\[\\not\\vdash(\\varphi \\to(\\neg\\varphi \\to \\psi)).\\]\n\n  \nInterestingly enough, Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet,\npresented as a derivation, holds in the fibred logic: \n\n\\[\\varphi, \\neg\\varphi \\vdash \\psi.\\]\n\n \nObserve that \\((\\varphi \\to(\\neg\\varphi \\to \\psi))\\) is an interaction\nrule between the connectives of the logics being combined which cannot\nbe obtained by algebraic fibring in the categories under consideration\n(however, this principle can be recovered, e.g., by direct union of\nmatrices). If one is interested in recovering a logic from its\nfragments, this result is disappointing.   \nConcerning the study of the expressive power of the combination of \nfragments of classical logic mentioned above, both at the axiomatic \nlevel, as well as considered as subalgebras of the 2-valued Boolean \nalgebra, Rautenberg obtained several interesting results in Rautenberg \n1981. One of his main contributions was the proof that any 2-valued matrix \ncan be effectively axiomatized. In turn, the  question of combination \nof fragments of classical logic by fibring was additionally investigated \nin Caleiro et al 2019, based on the description of \nthe 2-valued clones made in Post 1941, on the axiomatization \nprocedures for 2-valued matrices introduced in Rautenberg 1981, and \non the results on fibring (N)matrices presented in Marcelino and \nCaleiro 2017b (see subsection 4.3). \nIn particular, the  paper studied the\nconditions under which the fibring of the Hilbert calculi of disjoint\nfragments of classical logic recovers the union of the fragments. \nSeveral examples of combinations by fibring of the logics of classical \nconnectives were analyzed, obtaining their characterizations by \n(N)matrices, as well as the additional inference rules (bridge principles) needed \nfor recovering the corresponding fragment of classical logic. Among \nseveral examples, it was shown that the fibring of two copies of the logic \nof classical conjunction collapses into the logic of a single conjunction. \nOn the other hand, neither the combination of two copies of the logic of the \nclassical negation nor the combination of two copies of  the logic of the \nclassical disjunction produces an analogous collapse: the fibring of two \ncopies of the logic of \nclassical negation is not finite-valued, but can be characterized by a \n5-valued Nmatrix; and the fibring of two copies of the logic of classical \ndisjunction cannot be characterized by a single finite-valued Nmatrix. \nBy analyzing once again the combination by fibring of the logic of \nclassical disjunction and the logic of classical conjunction (that is, \nthe least conservative extension of both logics) it was shown that the \ncombined logic cannot be characterized by a single finite-valued Nmatrix. \nThe same happens with the fibring of the logic of classical disjunction \nand the logic of classical negation, thus showing that the fibred logics \nare strictly subclassical in both cases. \nThese examples, as well as other along the same lines, suggest a\nproblem dual to that of collapsing and distributivity between\nconjunction and disjunction: some expected interaction laws fail to be\ncreated by some combination processes. \nIn such cases, it could be said that the combined logics are too weak\nbecause they are unable to derive certain intended propositions in the\nnew combined language. \nWhat could be expected when combining logics? Strong logics\n(guaranteeing, for instance, that a logic can be recovered from its\nfragments) or weaker ones (in which undesirable interactions between\nconnectives are blocked)? \nThe examples above are evidence against and in favor of both\nsituations: in order to avoid del Cerro and Herzig’s collapsing problem, a careful\nsplicing process should be expected (and so the interaction between\nboth implications would disappear). On the other hand, if one wants to\nrecover, say, classical logic from some of its fragments, a more liberal\nsplicing process would be more appropriate as some intended\ninteractions between connectives of both logics would be\nrecovered. \nWith respect to the distributivity problem when combining conjunction\nand disjunction, the choice of method is also not determined:\ndistributivity could be a desired feature if we adopted the viewpoint\nof recovering a logic from its fragments. In this case, a combination\nmethod defining a stronger logic (such as the direct union of\nmatrices) would be more appropriate than, for instance, algebraic\nfibring of Hilbert calculi. But if, as argued in Beziau 2004,\ndistributivity is regarded as an intruder, then a more cautious\nprocess would be recommended: algebraic fibring of Hilbert calculi\nwould be more appropriate in this case. To sum up: the choice of the\nmost adequate combining process depends upon what one wants to\nobtain. \nAt this point, it is convenient to notice that the question about\nwhether or not interactive principles are generated when combining\nmodal logics, is intrinsically related to Hume’s ‘is-ought\nproblem’ discussed in\n section 1.\n Indeed, as proven in Schurz 1991, it is possible to obtain nontrivial\n‘is-ought’ deductions in the combination of alethic and\ndeontic logics provided that some bridge principles are allowed. The\nvalidity of bridge principles as \\(\\obcirc \\varphi \\rightarrow\n\\lozenge \\varphi\\) is nothing else than interaction rules between\nconnectives of the logics being combined. Such principles enjoy a\nsimilar conceptual status as the distributivity laws between\nconjunction and disjunction, or as the collapsing example mentioned\nabove. Thus, in order to satisfy Hume’s thesis, a combination\nprocess generating logics without interactions should be preferred. On\nthe other hand, a combination process allowing the creation of\ninteractions between the connectives could grant bridge principles\nviolating Hume’s thesis. \nFinally, it is noteworthy to observe that algebraic fibring does not\nintrinsically forbid the emergence of interactions between connectives\nof the logics being combined. In fact, the notion of morphism in the\ncategory of logic systems being employed is the key to creating or\nblocking interactions. In order to exemplify this assertion, consider\nthe case of the failure to recover classical logic from its\n\\(\\{\\neg\\}\\)-fragment and \\(\\{\\vee\\}\\)-fragment by algebraic fibring.\nFrom a proof-theoretic perspective, the key reason for this failure is that the rule \n\n\\[\n\\tag{* }\n\\frac{\\Gamma, \\varphi\\vdash \\psi \\;\\quad\\; \\Delta, \\neg\\varphi\\vdash \\psi}\n{\\Gamma, \\Delta\\vdash \\psi}\n\\]\n\n of the\nlogic of classical negation is not preserved by algebraic fibring in\ncategories of logic systems having translations between logics as\nmorphisms (recall\n subsection 4.4),\n such as the category of Hilbert calculi or consequence relations. \nWhen considering algebraic fibring of classical implication with\nclassical negation in those categories, the missing rule is the\nDeduction Metatheorem: \n\n\\[\\tag{**} \\frac{\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi}\n{\\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to\\psi)}.\\]\n\n  \nCategories of logic systems having logic translations as morphisms are\nsuch that the canonical injections of the coproduct are just inclusion\nmappings. Then, given two logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), the only rules of these logics which are preserved by\nalgebraic fibring are those of the form: \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi.\\]\n\n  \nOn the other hand, suppose that we are dealing with a category of\nlogic systems in which the preservation of rules such as \\((*)\\) or\n\\((**)\\) above is required by the very notion of morphism. Thus, if a\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is obtained as a combination of two other systems\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) then the rules of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) would be faithfully transferred to\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\). This is the proposal of Coniglio 2007, in which\nalgebraic fibring in categories of sequent calculi is investigated,\ntaking into account a notion of morphism which preserves logical rules\nof the form \n\n\\[\n\\textit{If  }\\;\\; \\Gamma_1\\vdash\\varphi_1 \\;\\;\\textit{ and  …  and  }\\;\\; \\Gamma_n\\vdash\\varphi_n \\;\\;\\textit{  then }\\;\\;\n\\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi.\n\\]\n\n  \nIn such categories, when a logic system is embedded into a larger one\nby algebraic fibring, any rule as above, which can be considered as a\nmeta-theorem of the logic, is preserved by the canonical injections.\nThis is why this process is called meta-fibring. From the\ncategorial point of view, the process is the same as for algebraic\nfibring, the only difference being that the notion of morphism is\nstronger. \nIn Coniglio and Figallo 2015, Coniglio and Figallo extended the idea\nof meta-fibring (that is, algebraic fibring of formal sequent calculi)\nto hypersequents, which allows preserving even stronger\nmeta-properties of the logics being combined. Hypersequents, which are\nfinite multisets of ordinary sequents, constitute a natural\ngeneralization of the proof-method of sequents and turn out to be a\nsuitable tool for presenting cut-free Gentzen-type formulations for\nseveral non-classical logics. \nThese examples illustrate the advantages of using category theory and\ntheir tools for defining combination procedures as universal\nconstructions: the same construction (in this case, algebraic fibring)\ncan be performed in categories of logic systems with different\nfeatures obtaining, as a consequence of this, stronger or weaker logic\nsystems.","contact.mail":"coniglio@cle.unicamp.br","contact.domain":"cle.unicamp.br"}]
