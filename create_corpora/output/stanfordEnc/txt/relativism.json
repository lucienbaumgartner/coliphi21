Relativists characteristically\ninsist, furthermore, that if something is only relatively so,\nthen there can be no framework-independent vantage point from which\nthe matter of whether the thing in question is so can be\nestablished.\n\nRelativism has been, in its various guises, both one of the most\npopular and most reviled philosophical doctrines of our\ntime. Defenders see it as a harbinger of tolerance and the only\nethical and epistemic stance worthy of the open-minded and\ntolerant. Detractors dismiss it for its alleged incoherence and\nuncritical intellectual permissiveness.  Debates about relativism\npermeate the whole spectrum of philosophical sub-disciplines. From\nethics to epistemology, science to religion, political theory to\nontology, theories of meaning and even logic, philosophy has felt the\nneed to respond to this heady and seemingly subversive\nidea. Discussions of relativism often also invoke considerations\nrelevant to the very nature and methodology of philosophy and to the\ndivision between the so-called “analytic and continental”\ncamps in philosophy. And yet, despite a long history of debate going\nback to Plato and an increasingly large body of writing, it is still\ndifficult to come to an agreed definition of what, at its core,\nrelativism is, and what philosophical import it has. This entry\nattempts to provide a broad account of the many ways in which\n“relativism” has been defined, explained, defended and\ncriticized.\n\nThe label “relativism” has been attached to a wide\nrange of ideas and positions which may explain the lack of consensus\non how the term should be defined. The profusion of the use of the\nterm “relativism” in contemporary philosophy means that\nthere is no ready consensus on any one definition. Here are three\nprominent, but not necessarily incompatible, approaches: A standard way of defining and distinguishing between different\ntypes of relativism is to begin with the claim that a\nphenomenon x (e.g., values, epistemic, aesthetic and ethical\nnorms, experiences, judgments, and even the world) is somehow\ndependent on and co-varies with some underlying, independent\nvariable y (e.g., paradigms, cultures, conceptual schemes,\nbelief systems, language). The type of dependency relativists propose\nhas a bearing on the question of definitions. Let us take some\nexamples. Each of (a)–(c) exhibits a relation of dependence where a\nchange in the independent variable y will result in variations\nin the dependent variable x. However, of the three examples\ncited above, normally only (a) and (b) are deemed relevant to\nphilosophical discussions of relativism, for one main attraction of\nrelativism is that it offers a way of settling (or explaining away)\nwhat appear to be profound disagreements on questions of value,\nknowledge and ontology and the relativizing parameter often involves\npeople, their beliefs, cultures or languages. The co-variance definition proceeds by asking the dual\nquestions: (i) what is relativized? and (ii) what is it relativized\nto? The first question enables us to distinguish forms of relativism\nin terms of their objects, for example, relativism about\ntruth, goodness, beauty, and their subject matters, e.g., science,\nlaw, religion. The answer to the second question individuates forms of\nrelativism in terms of their domains or frames of\nreference—e.g., conceptual frameworks, cultures, historical\nperiods, etc. Such classifications have been proposed by Haack (1996),\nO’Grady (2002), Baghramian (2004), Swoyer (2010), and Baghramian\n& Coliva (2019). The following table classifies different\nrelativistic positions according to what is being relativized, or its\nobjects, and what is being relativized to, or its domains. Table 1:\nDomains of Relativization (y) Table 1 reflects the availability of fine-grained distinctions\nbetween different forms of relativism as functions of both objects\n(x) and domains (y) of relativization. In practice,\nhowever, much contemporary discussions of relativism focus on\nsubjectivism, historicism, cultural relativism and conceptual\nrelativism, along the axis of y, and cognitive/epistemic\nrelativism, ethical or moral relativism and aesthetic relativism,\nalong the axis of x. As we shall see\nin §5, New Relativism, where\nthe objects of relativization (in the left column) are\nutterance tokens expressing claims about cognitive norms,\nmoral values, etc.  and the domain of relativization is the standards\nof an assessor, has also been the focus of much recent\ndiscussion.  A second approach to defining relativism casts its net more widely\nby focusing primarily on what relativists deny. Defined\nnegatively, relativism amounts to the rejection of a number of\ninterconnected philosophical positions. Traditionally, relativism is\ncontrasted with: Absolutism, the view that at least some\ntruths or values in the relevant domain apply to all times, places or\nsocial and cultural frameworks. They are universal and not bound by\nhistorical or social conditions. Absolutism is often used as the key\ncontrast idea to relativism. Objectivism or the position that cognitive,\nethical and aesthetic norms and values in general, but truth in\nparticular, are independent of judgments and beliefs at particular\ntimes and places, or in other words they are (non-trivially)\nmind-independent. The anti-objectivist on the other hand, denies that\nthere is such thing as simply being ‘true’,\n‘good’, ‘tasty’ or ‘beautiful’ but\nargues that we can coherently discuss such values only in relation to\nparameters that have something to do with our mental lives.  Monism or the view that, in any given area\nor topic subject to disagreement, there can be no more than one\ncorrect opinion, judgment, or norm. The relativist often wishes to\nallow for a plurality of equally valid values or even truths.  Realism, when defined in such a way that\nit entails both the objectivity and singularity of truth, also stands\nin opposition to relativism. Relativism in this negative sense is a prominent feature of the\nwork of the relativists malgré eux such as Richard\nRorty (1979) and Jacques Derrida (1974). What justifies the\nappellation ‘relativist’, rather than\n‘skeptic’, is not only these philosophers’ suspicion\nof the possibility of objectivity but their insistence on the role of\nsocio-historical, psychological and textual contexts in accounts of\n‘truth’ and ‘knowledge’ claims. What also binds various forms of relativism is an underlying idea\nthat claims to truth, knowledge or justification have an implicit,\nmaybe even unnoticed, relationship to a parameter or domain. Gilbert\nHarman (1975), Robert Nozick (2001), and Crispin Wright (2008b) are\namong the philosophers to propose versions of this thesis. Paul\nBoghossian summarizes the position this way:  the relativist about a given domain, D,\npurports to have discovered that the truths of D\ninvolve an unexpected relation to a parameter. (Boghossian\n2006b: 13) \n\nTo take an example, moral relativism, according to this approach, is\nthe claim that the truth or justification of beliefs with moral\ncontent is relative to specific moral codes. So the sentence “It\nis wrong to sell people as slaves” is elliptical for “It\nis wrong to sell people as slaves relative to the moral code\nof …”.  Or alternatively, as Kusch (2010) formulates the\nidea on behalf of the relativist: “It\nis wrong-relative-to-the-moral-code-of-…” to\nsell people as slaves. The resulting sentence(s) turns out to be true,\naccording to the relativist, depending on how we fill in the\n“…”. So, “It is wrong to sell people as\nslaves” comes out true relative to the moral code of the United\nNations Charter of Human Rights and false relative to the moral code\nof ancient Greece. The justifying thought is that judgments about the\nmorality of slavery, or any other ethical issue, are based on\ndiffering conventions, and there is no universal or objective\ncriterion for choosing among differing competing socio-historically\nconstituted conventions. Moreover, as a corollary of this approach,\nthere is no truth of the matter of whether it is wrong to sell people\nas slaves, independently of the specification of some\nstandard. Thus on the hidden parameter account, a consequence is that\nthe relevant claims will be true, if at all, only relative to some\nparameter. This particular approach to relativism is often expressed in\nexplicitly linguistic terms and is favored by philosophers interested\nin the semantic dimensions of relativism. The claim is that predicates\nsuch as “is true”, “is rational”, “is\nright”, “is good” etc. in a natural language have\nthe apparent logical form of one-place predicates, but their surface\ngrammatical form is misleading, because upon further investigation\nthey prove to be elliptical for two-place predicates such as “is\ntrue relative to…”, “is right according to”,\netc., (of course, where such predicates are available).  Relativism,\naccording to this approach, is the claim that a statement of the form\n“A is P” within a given domain (e.g.,\nscience, ethics, metaphysics, etc.) is elliptical for the statement\n“A is P in relation to C”,\nwhere A stands for an assertion, belief, judgment or\naction, P stands for a predicate such as “true”,\n“beautiful”, “right”, “rational”,\n“logical”, “known” etc., and C stands\nfor a specific culture, epistemic framework, language, belief-system,\netc. The three approaches outlined here are compatible and sometimes\ncomplementary. A relativistic thesis as captured by the approach\noutlined in §1.1 for instance, will also\nbe relativistic in at least one of the negative senses outlined\nin §1.2. Moreover, as we shall see, since\nvarious subdivisions of relativism appearing\nin table 1 could, with appropriate modification,\nbe expressed as claims about the truth of sentences falling\nin a particular domain, then the hidden predicate approach is\napplicable to them as well.  (See §5 for a\nmore detailed way to give expression to the hidden parameter insight\nwithin recent work in the philosophy of language.) A further consideration relevant to defining relativism is its\nscope. The basic idea of global relativism is captured by the oft-repeated\nslogan “all is relative”. The claim is that all beliefs,\nregardless of their subject matter, are true only relative to a\nframework or parameter.  Local relativists, by contrast, limit their\nclaim of relativization to self-contained areas of discourse, e.g.,\nethics, aesthetics and taste but argue that, for instance, scientific\ntruths are not suitable candidates for a relativistic understanding\n(but also see §4.4.3).  It is worth\nnoting that local relativisms, typically, are endorsed on the basis of\nphilosophical considerations connected to the kinds\nof features that are claimed to be relative (e.g., aesthetic\nstandards, epistemic principles), or relatedly, semantic\nconsiderations to do with discourse where such features are\nattributed. Global relativism, by contrast, seems to be motivated not\nso much by considerations about particular features, but by more\ngeneral considerations about truth itself.  As we will see, global relativism is open to the charge of\ninconsistency and self-refutation, for if all is relative, then so is\nrelativism. Local relativism is immune from this type of criticism, as\nit need not include its own statement in the scope of what is to be\nrelativized. Unsurprisingly, local rather than global relativism is\nmuch more common within contemporary debates. There is also a question\nmark on whether we could apply relativism to all truths in a\ncompletely unrestricted way; for instance, Kölbel (2011) has\nargued that claims such as “an object is beautiful and not\nbeautiful” and “an object is identical to itself”\nhave to be excluded. A further distinction is made between weak and strong\nforms of relativism.  Strong relativism is the claim that one and\nthe same belief or judgment may be true in one context (e.g., culture\nor framework or assessment) and false in another.  Weak\nrelativism is the claim that there may be beliefs or judgments\nthat are true in one framework but not true in a second simply because\nthey are not available or expressible in the second. Bernard\nWilliams’ “relativism of distance” (Williams 1985)\nand Ian Hacking’s (1982) defense of variability in styles of\nreasoning are instances of weak relativism. Williams argues that\ncertain concepts are only available to people who live a particular\nform of life. These are concepts that are not a part of what Williams\ncalls the “absolute conception of the world” and do not\nexpress truths that any rational creature, regardless of her culture,\nwould in principle acknowledge. Truths that require these concepts for\ntheir formulation are expressible only in languages whose speakers\ntake part in that particular form of life. Such truths need not be\ntrue in a relativized sense—true relative to some parameters,\nfalse relative to others; rather, such truths are perspectival: real\nbut visible only from a certain angle, i.e., for people who adopt a\ncertain way of life. This weaker form of relativism, in so far as it\ndenies the universality of certain truth claims, is captured more\nreadily by the negative definition (§1.2)\nof relativism. Interest in relativism as a philosophical doctrine goes back to\nancient Greece. In more recent decades, however, relativism has also\nproven popular not only as a philosophical position but also as an\nidea underwriting a normative—ethical and political-outlook.\n(see Bloom 1987, in particular the Introduction, and Kusch (ed.)\n2019). A number of philosophical considerations as well as\nsocio-historical developments explain the enduring interest in and the\nmore recent popularity of relativism.  Data regarding diversity of belief systems, conceptual frameworks\nand ways of life have frequently been used by philosophers and\nanthropologists alike to give credibility to philosophical arguments\nfor relativism (For example see Hollis & Lukes 1982 and Wilson\n1970). The mere fact of empirical diversity does not lead to\nrelativism, but, relativism as a philosophical doctrine, has often\nbeen taken as a natural position to adopt in light of\nempirical diversity, in part, because relativism helps to make sense\nof such diversity without the burden of explaining who is in\nerror. Descriptive relativism, an empirical and methodological position\nadopted by social anthropologists, relies on ethnographic data to\nhighlight the paucity of universally agreed upon norms, values and\nexplanatory frameworks. From polygamy to cannibalism, from witchcraft\nto science we find major differences between the worldviews and\noutlooks of individuals and groups. Descriptive relativism is often\nused as the starting point for philosophical debates on relativism in\ngeneral and cultural relativism in particular. The observed radical\ndifferences among cultures, it is argued, show the need for a\nrelativistic assessment of value systems and conceptual commitments.\nSome anti-relativist universalists, on the other hand, argue that\nunderlying the apparent individual and cultural differences, there are\nsome core commonalities to all belief systems and socio-cultural\noutlooks (e.g., Nussbaum 1997). But the relativistically inclined\nrespond by first pointing to the seeming incommensurability of various\nethical and conceptual frameworks and the variability of cognitive\nnorms and practices in difference cultures, and then, on this basis,\nmaintain that the so-called “commonalities” belie\nsignificant differences. The anti-relativist may concede the point and\ninsist that where such disagreements exist, at most one view is\ncorrect and the rest mistaken. But in so far as we are reluctant to\nimpute widespread and systematic error to other cultures, or to our\nown, relativism remains an attractive option. Descriptive relativism\nis also central to the brand of relativism advocated by the\nsociologists of scientific knowledge and other social constructionists\nwho argue that, even in the so-called “hard sciences”, we\ncannot escape the specter of irresolvable differences and even\nincommensurability (see §4.4.3). There is not only a marked diversity of views on questions\nof right and wrong, truth and falsehood, etc., but more significantly,\nmany disputes arising from such differences seem intractable.\nThere are instances of long-standing disagreement, such that the\ndisputants are very plausibly talking about the same subject matter\n(thus avoiding incommensurability) and genuinely disagreeing with each\nother; and yet, no amount of information and debate enables them or us\nto resolve the disagreement. And moreover, in such cases, it can seem\nthat neither side seems to have made any obvious mistake (see, e.g.,\nHales 2014 and Beddor 2019). If well-informed, honest and intelligent people are unable to\nresolve conflicts of opinion, we should, some relativists argue,\naccept that all parties to such disputes could be right and their\nconflicting positions have equal claims to truth, each according to\ntheir own perspective or point of view. Their disagreement is\nfaultless (Kölbel 2004; Brogaard 2007; Hales 2014). Many\nrelativistically inclined philosophers, (e.g., Max Kölbel\n(2004), Wright (2006) and John MacFarlane with terminological\nqualification (2014: 133–136)) see the presence of faultless\ndisagreements as central to motivating and justifying relativism. The\nanti-relativists counter that the very notion of a\n“faultless” disagreement is incompatible with our common\nunderstanding of what it means to disagree. It is a hallmark of\ndisagreement, as commonly understood, that the parties involved find\nfault with the other sides’ views. When people disagree at\nleast one of them is making a mistake or is failing to\nbelieve what he or she ought to believe given his or her cognitive\naims.  Relativism accordingly offers a revisionary account of what it\nmeans to disagree (e.g., MacFarlane 2007, 2014; see\n§5 where the point has been discussed in\nsome detail); but it is not clear if the account can explain what is\nleft of a disagreement to preserve once we allow that both parties to\na disagreement could be right (Carter 2013; Dreier\n2009). A sophisticated semantic version of relativism about truth, known\nas truth-relativism, and alternatively as “new\nrelativism”, has been proposed in recent years and which\nattempts to deal with some of these issues (e.g., MacFarlane 2014 and\nFerrari 2019 for an overview). We will return to this variety of\nrelativism in\n§5. A different perspective on the move from disagreement to relativism\nis offered in recent work by Carol Rovane (2012 and 2013), who rejects\nthe prevailing consensus on what she calls the “disagreement\nintuition of relativism” in favor of an “alternatives\nintuition”. According to Rovane, relativism is motivated by the\nexistence of truths that cannot be embraced together, not because they\ncontradict and hence disagree with each other but because they are not\nuniversal truths. The example Rovane gives is conflict between a\nbelief that deference to parents is morally obligatory in Indian\ntraditionalist sense and the belief that it is not morally obligatory\nin the American individualist sense. Each belief is true within its\nparticular ethical framework but the two beliefs cannot be conjoined\nor embraced together. Or more generally, it is not possible both to\nexercise full autonomy and simultaneously be dedicated to one’s\ncommunity and its norms. The underlying thought, for Rovane, is that\nnot all truth-value-bearers are in logical relations to one another,\nthat there are many noncomprehensive bodies of truths that cannot be\nconjoined. What the two approaches have in common is the claim that truth and\njustification are plural, that there could be more than\none correct account of how things stand in at least some\ndomains and their correctness has to be decided relative to a\nframework of context of assessment.  Additionally, the relativistically inclined find further support\nfor their position in the contention that there is no\nmeta-justification of our evaluative or normative systems, that all\njustifications have to start and end somewhere (see Sankey 2010 and\n2011) and that there are no higher-order or meta-level standards\navailable for adjudicating clashes between systems in a non-question\nbegging way. Steven Hales, for instance, argues that faced with\ndisagreement and given non-neutrality, relativism is the most\nviable non-skeptical conclusion to draw (Hales 2006: 98;\n2014). Similar considerations apply to attempts to anchor beliefs on\nsecure foundations. Various intellectual developments, leading to loss\nof old certainties in the scientific and social arena have\nstrengthened the appeal of this point.  The scientific revolution of\nthe early 20th century, brought about by, for instance, the\nadvent of Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics and the loss of\nfaith in lasting religious or political truths (Marxism in\nparticular), as well as the failure of foundationalist philosophical\nprograms have been used in arguments to vindicate relativistic views\n(for relativism about science\nsee §4.4.3). The relativists often argue\nthat justifications are not only perspectival but also\ninterest-relative and there is no neutral or objective starting ground\nfor any of our beliefs (see Seidel 2014; Carter 2015: ch. 4 and Siegel\nin Hales 2011: 205 for criticisms of this type of justification of\nrelativism). Pierre Duhem’s (1861–1916) thesis of\nunderdetermination of theory by data, the claim that empirical\nevidence alone is not adequate for providing justification for any\ngiven scientific theory, has played an important role in building up a\ncase both for conceptual relativism (§4.2)\nand for constructionism and relativism about science\n(§4.4.2\nand §4.4.3). According to the\nunderdetermination thesis, incompatible theories can be consistent\nwith available evidence. Relativism threatens whenever conflicting\ntheories or views appear to have equal claim to truth or\njustification. The relativistically inclined use underdetermination to\nclaim that evidence could be brought to justify opposing explanations\nand justification.  The underdetermination thesis is also used to\nhighlight the absence of neutral starting points for our\nbeliefs. Choices between incompatible but equally well-supported rival\ntheories, it is argued, are often made based on interests and local\npreferences rather than neutral universal grounds. Relativists argue that beliefs and values get their justification\nor truth only relative to specific epistemic systems or practices (see\nKusch forthcoming). Strong support for this view has come\nfrom social scientists and cultural theorist who focus on the\nsocio-cultural determinants of human beliefs and actions. The social\nsciences, from their very inception, were hospitable to relativism.\nIndeed, August Comte, the father of sociology, claimed that a strength\nof “positive sociology” was its “tendency to render\nrelative the ideas which were at first absolute” (Comte 1976\n[1830–42]: 89). Comte also was responsible for the battle cry\n“all is relative”, but immediately and no doubt\nself-consciously contradicted himself by adding “and\nthat’s the only absolute”. Other social scientists, under\nthe influence of Karl Marx (1818–1883), Max Weber\n(1864–1920), and Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911), have given\ncredence to the idea that human beliefs and actions could be\nunderstood and evaluated only relative to their social and economic\nbackground and context (cf., Kinzel 2019). Beliefs, desires and actions, the argument\ngoes, are never independent of a background of cultural\npresuppositions, interests and values. We cannot step out of our\nlanguage, culture and socio-historical conditions to survey reality\nfrom an Archimedean vantage point. Even perceptions are\n“theory-laden” and could vary between linguistic and\ncultural groupings. The sociological view that beliefs are\ncontext-dependent, in the sense that their context helps explain why\npeople have the beliefs they do, has also been used to support what is\nsometimes called “social” or “sociological\nrelativism” or the view that truth or correctness is relative to\nsocial contexts because we can both understand and judge beliefs and\nvalues only relative to the context out of which they\narise. Context-dependence is also used to explain empirical\nobservations of diversity in beliefs and values; different social\ncontexts, the argument goes, give rise to differing, possibly\nincompatible norms and values. Advocates of relativism, particularly outside philosophical\ncircles, often cite tolerance as a key normative reason for becoming a\nrelativist. On this rationale, all ways of life and cultures are\nworthy of respect in their own terms, and it is a sign of unacceptable\nethnocentrism to presume that we could single out one outlook or point\nof view as objectively superior to others. The Principle of Tolerance\nacquires an overtly socio-political form in the hand of Paul\nFeyerabend who maintains that “A free society is a society in\nwhich all traditions are given equal rights” (Feyerabend 1978:\n30).  Anti-relativists find this normative advocacy of relativism\nunconvincing for two key kinds of reasons. Some anti-relativists\n(e.g., Rachels 2009) often appeal to cases at the limits (e.g.,\ntoleration of heinous crimes) to show the thesis to be implausibly\noverpermissive (see §4.5). Others argue\nthat if all values are relative then tolerance and maximizing freedom\nare valuable only to those who have already embraced them. Relativists\ncounter that they are not defending a global version of relativism\nregarding all truths and justification but local versions concerning\nthe ethics and politics of belief and the usefulness of relativism in\nour attempt to become better, or at least more flexible and less\ndogmatic, thinkers and more tolerant citizens (e.g., Feyerabend 1978:\n82–84).  \nThe anti-relativists counter-argue that even if we grant that\npolitical tolerance is an important value, and that accepting\nrelativism would promote it, we should never adopt philosophical views\nabout the nature of truth or justification simply because of their\nassumed good moral or political consequences. Second, and more\nimportantly: political toleration does not require the strong\ndoctrine of philosophical relativism. Increased awareness of diversity\ntogether with an awareness of the historical contingency of\none’s own convictions will promote political toleration just as\neffectively.  As Knobe and Nichols point out, simply being made aware\nof radically different view points can lead to a:  …crisis akin to that of the [Christian] child\nconfronted with religious diversity… For the discovery of\nreligious diversity can prompt the thought that it’s in some\nsense accidental that one happens to be raised in a Christian\nhousehold rather than a Hindu household. This kind of arbitrariness\ncan make the child wonder whether there’s any reason to think\nthat his religious beliefs are more likely to be right than those of\nthe Hindu child (Knobe & Nichols 2007: 11)  \nA separate strand of argument connecting tolerance and relativism has\nappealed to the claimed virtues of relativism as a kind\nof philosophical stance (e.g., Bloor 2011; Baghramian 2019),\none that is characterised by anti-absolutist intellectual virtues such\nas curiosity and anti-dogmatism. The idea that a relativistic stance\ninvolves the manifesting of intellectually beneficial attitudes has\nbeen championed by, along with Bloor, Feyerabend (1975) and Code\n(1995), the latter of whom have emphasised the value of emancipatory\nthinking, e.g., thinking that is not artificially constrained by\nattempts to “enforce a universalist truth”. \n\nHowever, critics of relativism as a stance have countered such\narguments from ‘relativist virtues’ with arguments from\nvice. Baghramian (2019), for instance, has suggested that even if we\ngrant that a relativist stance aligns with a cluster of intellectually\nvirtuous dispositions in thinking, the stance also has the consequence\nof encouraging several corresponding vices, including intellectual\ninsouciance (e.g., Cassam 2019), and lack of conviction (Baghramian\n2019: 265; cf., Kusch 2019 for replies). The English term “relativism” came into usage only in\nthe 19th Century. John Grote was probably the first to\nemploy it when in Exploratio Philosophica (1865) he wrote:  The notion of the mask over the face of nature\nis…. what I have called “relativism”. If “the\nface of nature” is reality, then the mask over it, which is what\ntheory gives us, is so much deception, and that is what relativism\nreally comes to. (Grote 1865: I.xi, 229).   \nIts German counterpart, “Relativismus”, has a\nlonger history. Wilhelm Traugott Krug, who succeeded Kant in the\nUniversity of Königsberg in his philosophical lexicon, defines it as  the assumption that everything which we\nexperience and think (the self, the idea of reason, truth, morality,\nreligion etc.) is only something relative, and therefore has no\nessential endurance and no universal validity. (Krug 2010 [1838]:\n224) Although the term “relativism” is of recent coinage,\ndoctrines and positions, with some of the hallmarks of contemporary\nrelativism, date back to the very beginnings of Western\nphilosophy. Protagoras of Abdera (c. 490–420 BC) is often\nconsidered the first overt champion of relativism, and his dictum Man (anthrôpos) is the measure\n(metron) of all things (chrêmatôn), of\nthe things which are, that they are, and of the things which are not,\nthat they are not (tôn men ontôn hôs esti,\ntôn de mê ontôn hôs ouk estin) (from\nPlato’s Theaetetus 152a 2–4) its first battle-cry. According to Plato,\nProtagoras thought: Each thing appears (phainesthai) to me,\nso it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it is for you—you\nand I each being a man. (Theaetetus 152a 6–8) For instance, the same wind could be cold to one\nperson and hot to another. The extent to which Protagoras’s\nview, or at least what comes down to us from Plato, amounts to\ngenuine relativism remains somewhat controversial. As Burnyeat\n(1976b: 172) notes, Sextus Empiricus thought—though Burnyeat\nthinks mistakenly—that the Protagorean measure doctrine was to\nbe understood as the subjectivist thesis that\nevery appearance is true (simpliciter). This kind\nof radical subjectivism, though, quickly can be shown to turn on\nitself: it can appear that the thesis that “every\nappearance is true” is false. And so this radical subjectivist\ninterpretation, regardless of whether it is accurate, is as Sextus\nhad thought, untenable. However, Plato also ascribes a social or\nethical dimension to Protagorean relativism which seem to go beyond\nindividualistic subjectivism. In Theaetetus 172a 2–6\nhe says what may or may not fittingly be done, of just and\nunjust, of what is sanctioned by religion and what is not; and here\nthe theory may be prepared to maintain that whatever view a\ncity takes on these matters and establishes as its law or\nconvention, is truth and fact for that city. In such matters,\nneither any individual nor any city can claim superior\nwisdom. [emphasis added] Plato’s attempted refutation of Protagoras,\nknown as peritrope or “turning around”, is the\nfirst of the many attempts to show that relativism is self-refuting. Protagorean relativism directly influenced the Pyrrhonian Skeptics,\nwho saw the “man is the measure” doctrine as a precursor\nto their brand of skepticism. Sextus Empiricus, for instance, in his\n“Relativity Mode” states that judgments and observations\nare relative to the person who makes them, to their context as well as\nthe object being observed and goes on to say, since we have established in this way that\neverything is relative (pros ti), it is clear then that we\nshall not be able to say what an existing object is like in its own\nnature and purely, but only what it appears to be like relative to\nsomething. (Sextus Empiricus PH I 140) But the conclusion he draws favors skepticism\nrather than relativism as understood in modern philosophy, for he\nconcludes, “It follows that we must suspend judgment about the\nnature of objects” (ibid.). Glimpses of relativistic thinking were in evidence in Boethius\n(480–524) (see Marenbon 2003) as well as in the double truth\ndoctrine, or the view that religion and philosophy are separate and at\ntimes conflicting sources of truth, originally found in Averroes\n(1126–1198) and the 13th century Latin Averroists.\nHowever, the dominant belief in a singular and absolute revealed truth\nwithin a Christian framework, on the whole, made the medieval period\ninhospitable to relativism. There was a renewed interest in both\nrelativism and skepticism at the inception of modern philosophy\ninspired, in part, by Latin translations of Sextus Empiricus in the\n16th century. Michel de Montaigne’s work\n(1533–1592), in common with others sympathetic towards\nrelativism, ancient or contemporary, relies on accounts of faraway\ncultures to argue that “we have no other criterion of truth or\nright-reason than the example and form of the opinion and customs of\nour own country” (Montaigne 1580 [1991: 152]) (but also see\nFricker 2013 for a dissenting view). His advocacy of toleration, even\nfor the cannibal, paved the way for not only the acceptance but the\nvalorization of idealized versions of alien creeds and distant\ncultures by Enlightenment figures such as Rousseau (1712–1778),\nVoltaire (1694–1778), Diderot (1713–1784), Montesquieu\n(1689–1755) and Condorcet (1743–1794), who in turn, were\ninstrumental in establishing an intellectual climate hospitable to\ncultural relativism. These authors were also the first to explore the\nidea of viewing one’s culture from an outsider’s point of\nview and using this external perspective as a vehicle to criticize\nlocal customs and norms. To take just one example, Diderot, in his\n“Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville”, tells us that\nthe Tahitian is mild, innocent, and happy while civilized people are\ncorrupt, vile, and wretched; the natives live according to customs and\nrules that vary greatly from the Western ones. They do not possess\nprivate property or operate their affairs based on egalitarian\nprinciples, and they exercise sexual freedom not accepted in\n“civilized societies”. Diderot accordingly opposes the\nEuropean mission of civilizing the natives, and despite his belief in\na common human nature, he advocates the relativistic sounding maxim to be monks in France and savages in Tahiti. Put on\nthe costume of the country you visit, but keep the suit of clothes you\nwill need to go home in. (Diderot 1956 [1772]: 228 in Baghramian 2010:\n37) Discussions of relativism in the 19th century had two\nsources (see Gardiner 1981). On the one hand, figures from the\nso-called Counter-Enlightenment, a philosophical movement which arose\nin the late 18th century and the early 19th\ncentury in opposition to the Enlightenment, Johann Georg Hamann\n(1730–1788), Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), Wilhelm\nvon Humboldt (1767–1835) emphasized the diversity of languages\nand customs and their role in shaping human thought. Hamann’s\nviews on language, for instance, foreshadow contemporary conceptual\nand epistemic relativism. He maintained that language is the\n“instrument and criterion of reason” as well as the source\nof all the confusions and fallacies of reason. Furthermore, the rules\nof rationality are embedded within language, which in turn, is\ngoverned by local norms of custom and use (Hamann 1967\n[1759]). Relativism ensues because languages and their rules of\nrationality vary a great deal. Herder, on the other hand, not only\nrailed against the rational, universalizing and science-oriented ethos\nof the Enlightenment but, much like later relativists, also argued\nthat different nations and epochs have their distinct preferences in\nethical and aesthetics matters as well as their varied conceptions of\ntruth and we are not in a position to adjudicate between them (Herder\n1774 [2002: 272–358]). The Counter Enlightenment had a significant influence on Hegel,\nNietzsche, and Dilthey, who in turn have shaped relativistic thinking\nin certain strands of continental philosophy, postmodernism and\ncultural studies. Hamann’s rejection of objectivism was central\nto Nietzsche’s even more profound recoil from objectivity.  And\nindeed, Nietzsche is possibly the single most influential voice in\nshaping relativistic sensibilities in 20th century\ncontinental philosophy. His declaration that all human conceptions and\ndescriptions, including those advanced by scientists, are only an interpretation and arrangement of the\nworld (according to our own requirements, if I may say so!)—and\nnot an explanation of the world. (Nietzsche 1886a [1996]: §14) and that “there is only a perspective\nseeing, only a perspective knowing” (Nietzsche 1886b [1968]:\n§540), irrespective of how Nietzsche himself intended them, have\nbeen taken to express a core contention of relativism that no single\naccount of truth or reality can occupy a privileged position, for\nsuch accounts are only one of many perspectives that prevail at a\ngiven time in history. We cannot appeal to any facts or standards of\nevaluation independently of their relation to the perspectives\navailable to us; we can do little more than to insist on the\nlegitimacy of our own perspective and try to impose it on other\npeople through our “will to power”.  A second source was the German post-Kantian and British Idealist\ndiscussions of the “relativity of knowledge” taking place\nin the context of the distinction between being-for-other\n(für anderes sein) and being-for-itself\n(fürsichsein)—a distinction influenced by the\nKantian idea that all knowledge is ultimately relational because\nknowledge of the Real or “the thing in itself” is\nimpossible. John Stuart Mill, for instance ascribes to the Kantian\nWilliam Hamilton the “doctrine of relativity of our human\nknowledge” because Hamilton, according to Mill, believed that\nthere could be no unconditional or absolute knowledge for all\nknowledge is dependent on the knowing mind (Mill 1884: 8). The end of the 19th century witnessed the emergence of yet\nanother strand of relativism motivated by empirical-psychological and\nphysiological interpretations of Kantian categories. The view, known\nas species relativism, and defended by neo-Kantian\npsychologists such as Theodore Lipps (1851–1914), holds that the\nrules of logic are products of the human mind and psychology and\ntherefore may be unique to the human species; different species could\nhave and use different logical principles. The view was vehemently,\nbut quite effectively, attacked by Frege and Husserl as part of\ntheir arguments against what they called “psychologism”\nand “speciesism” (Kusch 1995: 47). Logic in this approach is\nidentified with the actual thinking processes of individuals or\ncommunities and its authority is seen to be local, or relative to the\npractices of particular epistemic groupings. But Frege and Husserl\nargued that with such relativization we would lose the ability to\ndistinguish between reasoning correctly and merely seeming to do\nso. Finally, the popularity of the very idea of relativism in the\n20th century owes something to Einstein’s Special\nTheory of Relativity (1905) which was to be used both as model and as\nwell as a vindication for various relativistic claims. Gilbert Harman\nis among the philosophers to use Einsteinian relativity as a model for\nphilosophical versions of relativism. He says:  According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity\neven an object’s mass is relative to a choice of spatio-temporal\nframework. An object can have one mass in relation to one such\nframework and a different mass in relation to another. …. I am\ngoing to argue for a similar claim about moral right and wrong.\n… I am going to argue that moral right and wrong …. are\nalways relative to a choice of moral framework. (Harman 1996:\n3) The Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic relativity\n(see §4.1) is also thought to have been\ninspired by the Relativity Theory. It is however worth noting that\nEinstein did not think that the Theory of Relativity supported\nrelativism in ethics or epistemology because, although in his model\nsimultaneity and sameness of place are relative to reference frames,\nthe physical laws expressing such relativity are constant and\nuniversal and hence in no sense relative. The different strands of the intellectual genealogy of relativism\nhave shaped a variety of relativistic doctrines. Relativism is discussed under a variety of headings some of which\nhave been more prominent in recent philosophical and cultural\ndebates. Public debates about relativism often revolve around the frequently\ncited but unclear notion of cultural relativism. The idea\nthat norms and values are born out of conventions can be traced back\nto the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484–425 BC), but it is only\nin the 20th century, and particularly with the advent of\nsocial anthropology, that cultural relativism has gained wide\ncurrency.  Franz Boas, responsible for the founding of social\nanthropology in the U.S., claimed that The data of ethnology prove that not only our\nknowledge but also our emotions are the result of the form of our\nsocial life and of the history of the people to whom we belong. (Boas\n1940: 636) Boas’s views became the orthodoxy of\nanthropology through M. J. Herskovits’ “principle of\ncultural relativism” stating: “Judgments are based on\nexperience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms\nof his own enculturation” (Herskovits 1955:15). Since those early days, social anthropologists have come to develop\nmore nuanced approaches to cultural relativism (see for instance\nGeertz 1993); however, its core tenet, a claim to the equal standing\nof all cultural perspectives and values which co-vary with their\ncultural and social background, has remained constant. Cultural relativists justify their position by recourse to a\ncombination of empirical, conceptual and normative considerations: Claims (a)–(d) are open to a variety of objections. Some\nanthropologists and biologists have argued against the empirical\nassumption of the variability of cultures and have disputed its\nextent.  Kinship, death and its attendant rituals of mourning, birth,\nthe experience of empathy, expressions of sympathy and fear, and the\nbiological needs that give rise to these, are some of the constant\nelements of human experience that belie the seeming diversity reported\nby ethnographers (Brown 2004). (c) has also been challenged by\nnaturalistically inclined social scientists who believe that an\nevolutionary or a biologically informed approach can provide a\ncontext-independent, universally applicable theoretical framework for\nexplaining what is common to all cultures, despite their superficial\ndifferences. Moreover, Moody-Adams (1997), among others, has argued\nthat cultures are not integrated wholes that could determine\nuni-directionally the beliefs and experiences of their members; they\nare porous, riddled with inconsistencies and amenable to change.\nFinally, (d) is under pressure from the very relativism it\nadvocates. Other critics, Pope Benedict XVI for instance, in his very\nfirst homily delivered upon election (18 April 2005), reject and\ncondemn prescriptive cultural relativism as a harbinger of nihilism\nand an “anything goes” extreme permissiveness. An influential form of descriptive cultural relativism owes its\ngenesis to linguistics. Benjamin Whorf, inspired by his teacher Edward\nSapir, who in turn was supervised by the social anthropologist Franz\nBoas, used ethnographic evidence from American Indian languages, such\nas Hopi, to argue that languages mold our views of the world and\ndifferent languages do so differently, because “we dissect\nnature along lines laid down by our native languages” (Whorf\n1956: 213). In the case of the Hopi, the claim was that their language\nimposes a conception of time very different from that of the speakers\nof the Indo-European languages. The so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,\nand the position known as “linguistic relativity”, became\npopular in both psychology and social anthropology in the mid\n20th century. However, the empirical work by the\npsychologists Berlin and Key (1969) and later by Eleanor Rosch (1974)\npointed to the universality of color terms. The linguistic theories of\nNoam Chomsky regarding the universality of grammar were also widely\ntaken to have discredited linguistic relativity. Moreover, Malotki\n(1983) had argued that, contrary to Whorf’s claim, the Hopi\nlanguage does indeed have tense, as well as units of time, such as\ndays, weeks, months and seasons, and terminology for yesterday and\ntomorrow. Things have changed recently and there has been a slight\nswing of the pendulum back in favor of linguistic relativity on the\npart of so called “neo-Whorfians”. Stephen Levinson, for\ninstance, drawing on experimental evidence, has argued that the frame\nof reference that underlies any given language shapes our spatial\nexperiences and perceptual modalities (see Gumperz & Levinson\n1996). Similar claims have been made about emotions, object\nrepresentation, and memory. But the claims of linguistic relativity in\nall these cases are much more modest than Whorf’s original\nthesis. Historical relativism, or historicism, is the diachronic version of\ncultural relativism. As Clifford Geertz points out, cultural and\nhistorical relativism are in effect the same doctrine with a core\nclaim that “we cannot apprehend another people’s or\nanother period’s imagination neatly, as though it were our\nown” (1993: 44). Historicism originated in reaction to the\nuniversalist tendencies of the Enlightenment but proved most\ninfluential in the social sciences, particularly in the hands of\n19th century theorists such as Karl Marx and Max Weber.\nOswald Spengler, the then-influential turn-of-the-century German\nhistorian and philosopher, also declared that: “There are no\neternal truths. Every philosophy is an expression of its time”\n(Spengler 1918: 58). Karl Mannheim, to whom we owe the sub-discipline of\nsociology of knowledge, pronounced that historicism is a significant\nintellectual force that epitomizes our worldview\n(Weltanschauung). The historicist principle not only organizes, like\nan invisible hand, the work of the cultural sciences\n(Geisteswissenschaften), but also permeates everyday\nthinking. (Mannheim 1952 [1924]:84) As we will see\n(§4.4.3), in more recent times\nhistoricist interpretations of science, chiefly those espoused by\nThomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, have played a major role in\npopularizing relativistic interpretations of scientific knowledge. Conceptual relativism is a narrowly delineated form of\nrelativism where ontology, or what exists, rather than ethical and\nepistemic norms, is relativized to conceptual schemes, scientific\nparadigms, or categorical frameworks. In this sense, conceptual\nrelativism is often characterized as a metaphysical doctrine rather\nthan as variant of epistemic or cultural relativism. The underlying\nrationale for this form of relativism is the anti-realist thesis that\nthe world does not present itself to us ready-made or ready-carved;\nrather we supply different, and at times incompatible, ways of\ncategorizing and conceptualizing it. Reflection on the connections\nbetween mind and the world, rather than empirical observations of\nhistoric and cultural diversity, is the primary engine driving various\nforms of conceptual relativism, but data from anthropology and\nlinguistics are also used in its support. The thought, at least since\nKant, is that the human mind is not a passive faculty merely\nrepresenting an independent reality; rather, it has an active role in\nshaping, if not constructing, the “real”. The conceptual\nrelativist adds, as Kant did not, that human beings may construct the\nreal in different ways thanks to differences in language or\nculture.  In the 20th century, a variety of positions sympathetic\nto conceptual relativism were developed. Quine’s ontological\nrelativity, Nelson Goodman’s “irrealism” with its\nclaim of the plurality of “world-versions” and Hilary\nPutnam’s conceptual relativity are prominent examples. What\nthese authors have in common is an insistence that there could be more\nthan one “right” way of describing what there is, that\nincompatible “manuals of translation” and\n“world-versions” can be equally correct or acceptable. Quine’s thesis of ontological relativity, probably the most\ninfluential of 20th century approaches to conceptual\nrelativity, is expressed both in an epistemic as well as in a stronger\nmetaphysical form. Quine supports an epistemic thesis when he claims\nthat incompatible scientific theories can account equally adequately\nfor the data available to us (his underdetermination thesis)\nand that “there are various defensible ways of conceiving the\nworld”, (Quine 1992: 102). But his thesis of the indeterminacy\nof translation makes the stronger claim that different incompatible\nmanuals of translation, or conceptual schemes, can account for one and\nthe same verbal behavior and the indeterminacy resides at the level of\nfacts rather than our knowledge, a position that leads to unavoidable\nontological relativity. Nelson Goodman’s irrealism is an even more radical claim to\nthe effect that the existence of many adequate, and indeed correct,\nbut irreconcilable descriptions and representations of the world shows\nthat there is no such thing as one unique actual world;\nrather there are many worlds, one for each correct description (e.g.,\nGoodman 1975; cf. Sider 2009). Hilary Putnam disagrees with\nGoodman’s formulation of relativity with its radical talk of\n“world-making” but relies on arguments from conceptual\nplurality to reject metaphysical realism, the view that there is one\nsingle correct account of what the world is like (cf., Arageorgis\n2017). According to Putnam, our most basic metaphysical categories,\ne.g., objecthood and existence, could be defined variously depending\non what conceptual scheme we use. What counts as an object itself, he\nargues, is determined by and hence is relative to the ontological\nframework we opt for. Thomas Kuhn’s highly influential discussion of the governing\nrole of paradigms in science\n(see §4.4.3) has also been interpreted\nas a form of conceptual relativism by friends (Kusch 2002) and critics\n(Davidson 1974) of relativism alike. The key difficulty facing conceptual relativism is that of\nformulating the position in a coherent but non-trivial manner. Trivial\nversions allow that the world can be described in different ways, but\nmake no claims to the incompatibility of these descriptions. The\ncharge of incoherence arises from the claim that there could be\ngenuinely conflicting and equally true accounts or descriptions of one\nand the same phenomenon. To use an example that is the corner-stone of\nHilary Putnam’s conceptual relativity, Putnam claims that the\nsimple question how many objects there are (say on a given table)\ncould be answered variously depending on whether we use “a\nmereological or a Carnapian, common-sense, method of individuating\nobjects”. In circumstances where a Carnapian counts three\nobjects A, B and C, a mereologist will count\nseven: A, B, C, plus the mereological sum\nobjects A+B, A+C, B+C, A+B+C.\nAs Putnam puts it:  The suggestion … is that what is (by\ncommonsense standards) the same situation can be described in many\ndifferent ways, depending on how we use the words. The situation does\nnot itself legislate how words like “object”,\n“entity”, and “exist” must be used. What is\nwrong with the notion of objects existing “independently”\nof conceptual schemes is that there are no standards for the use of\neven the logical notions apart from conceptual choices. (Putnam 1988:\n114) The puzzle is to explain how both the Carnapian and mereological\nanswers to the one and same question could be correct and yet mutually\nincompatible, for unless we abandon the most fundamental law of logic,\nthe law of non-contradiction, we cannot deem one and the same\nproposition true and not true. Relativists respond that both\nanswers are correct, each relative to the conceptual scheme it\ninvokes. So, once we accept the insight that there is no\nArchimedean vantage point for choosing among conflicting frameworks,\nwe no longer face a genuine contradiction. The response invokes, often\nimplicitly, a relativized conception of truth, which as we shall see\nbelow, faces its own difficulties. Relativism about truth, or alethic relativism, at its\nsimplest, is the claim that what is true for one individual or social\ngroup may not be true for another, and there is no context-independent\nvantage point to adjudicate the matter. What is true or false is\nalways relative to a conceptual, cultural, or linguistic\nframework. Alethic relativism is the most central of all relativistic\npositions since other subdivisions of the philosophical theses of\nrelativism—with the possible exception of some narrowly defined\nversions of conceptual relativism such as Nelson Goodman’s\nirrealism (see §4.2)—are in\nprinciple, reducible to it (Baghramian 2004: 92). For instance,\nrelativism about logic may be restated as a view according to which\nthe standing of logical truths (including truths about consequence\nrelations) is relative to cultures or cognitive schemes.  Ethical\nrelativism can be seen as the claim that the truth of ethical\njudgments, if such truths exist, is relative to context or culture. If\ntruth is to be seen as equally applicable to all areas of discourse\nand also unitary, rather than domain specific or plural, then alethic\nrelativism is not only a strong form of global relativism but it also\nentails the denial of the possibility of more local forms of\nrelativism because all localized relativistic claims are also attempts\nat relativizing truth (seemingly in a particular domain of\ndiscourse).  The central claim of alethic relativism is that “is\ntrue”, despite appearances to the contrary, is (at least, in\nsome relevant domains of discourse) not a one-place but a two-place\npredicate such that “P is true” should correctly be\nunderstood as (modulo differences in particular ways of\ndeveloping this idea) shorthand for “P is true for\nX”, where X is a culture, conceptual scheme,\nbelief framework, etc. And within the broad camp of alethic\nrelativists, the matter of how it is that which we should opt for\n“P-is-true-for-X”, rather than\n“P is true”, simpliciter, is developed in different\nways (e.g., see Meiland 1977; MacFarlane 2014: ch. 5; Egan 2007;\nFerrari & Moruzzi 2018).  One shared commitment of relativizing\nthe truth predicate is that claims such as “misfortune is caused\nby witchcraft” could be true according to the Azande cultural\nframework and false in the Western scientific framework. One major\ndifficulty facing alethic relativists is to explain what “true\nfor” actually means, and how “true for” should be\nunderstood as related to the more familiar absolutist truth\npredicate. For instance, should relative truth be understood as a\nmodification on an already familiar strategy for thinking about truth\n(e.g., the correspondence, pragmatic or epistemic model) or in some\ndifferent way, entirely? (MacFarlane 2014: ch. 2). Much of the work of\nNew Relativists such as John MacFarlane (see §5) can be see as an attempt to clarify this\nthorny issue. The strongest and most persistent charge leveled against all types\nof relativism, but (global) alethic relativism in particular, is the\naccusation of self-refutation. Here is for instance Harvey Siegel:  This incoherence charge is by far the most difficult\nproblem facing the relativist. It is worth noting that attempts to\novercome the problem by appealing to the notion of relative\ntruth appear not to succeed. Many versions of relativism rely on\nsuch a notion, but it is very difficult to make sense of it. An\nassertion that a proposition is “true for me” (or\n“true for members of my culture”) is more readily\nunderstood as a claim concerning what I (or members of my culture,\nscheme, etc.) believe than it is as a claim ascribing to that\nproposition some special sort of truth. Constructing a conception of\nrelative truth such that “p is relatively true” (or\n“p is true for S”, or “p is\ntrue for members of culture C”) amounts to something\nstronger than “S believes that p” (or\n“members of culture C believe that p”), but\nweaker than “p is true (simpliciter)”, has\nproved to be quite difficult, and is arguably beyond the conceptual\nresources available to the relativist. (Siegel 2011:\n203) The original argument goes back to Plato’s criticism of\nProtagoras in the Theaetetus where he argues: Most people believe that Protagoras’s doctrine is false. Protagoras, on the other hand, believes his doctrine to be\ntrue. By his own doctrine, Protagoras must believe that his\nopponents’ view is true. Therefore, Protagoras must believe that his own doctrine is false\n(see Theaetetus: 171a–c) Plato’s argument, as it stands, appears to be damaging only\nif we assume that Protagoras, at least implicitly, is committed to the\nuniversal or objective truth of relativism. On this view, Plato begs\nthe question on behalf of an absolutist conception of truth (Burnyeat\n1976a: 44). Protagoras, the relativists counter, could indeed accept\nthat his own doctrine is false for those who accept\nabsolutism but continue believing that his doctrine is true\nfor him. He could also try to persuade others to become the sort\nof thinker for whom relativism is true without being entangled in\nself-contradiction.  Such an effort at persuasions, however, could\ninvolve Protagoras in a performative contradiction as the relativist\ncannot assume that her arguments are good for persuading\nothers. Ordinarily, the very act of defending a philosophical position\ncommits us to the dialectical move of attempting to convince our\ninterlocutors of the superior value of what we are arguing\nfor. The relativist cannot make such a commitment and therefore his\nattempts to persuade others to accept his position may be\npragmatically self-refuting. The relativist can avoid the standard\ncharge of self-refutation by accepting that relativism cannot be\nproven true in any non-relative sense—viz., that\nrelativism itself as a philosophical position is at best true only\nrelative to a cultural or historical context and therefore could be\nfalse in other frameworks or cultures.  But such an admission will\nundermine the relativist’s attempt to convince others of her\nposition, for the very act of argumentation, as it is commonly\nunderstood, is an attempt to convince those who disagree with us of\nthe falsehood of their position. In other words, if Protagoras really\nbelieves in relativism why would he bother to argue for it? It may be argued that Protagoras could have opted for a more\nsensible form of alethic relativism where a person’s beliefs are\nnot automatically true relative to the framework she\naccepts. Rather a belief p is true according\nto X’s framework iff (roughly) X would\nbelieve that p if she were to reason cogently by her own\nstandards on the basis of full relevant information. This form of\nalethic relativism allows for argument and persuasion among people who\ninitially disagree, for despite their disagreement they may share or\ncome to share a framework.  Protagoras may, on this reinterpretation,\nbe trying to persuade his interlocutor that if she were to reason\ncogently by her own standards from their shared framework, she would\naccept relativism. However, it is not clear how the relativist could\nshare a framework with the absolutist on the nature of truth or what\nargumentative strategies he can use to convert the absolutist without\npresupposing a shared (relativist or absolutist) conceptions of\ntruth. In particular, a consistent relativist will have only a\nrelativized criteria of what counts as “true” information,\nwhich presumably will not be shared by the absolutist. A second strand of the self-refutation argument focuses on the\nnature and role of truth. J.L. Mackie, for instance, has argued that\nalethic absolutism is a requisite of a coherent notion of truth and\nthat a claim to the effect that “There are no absolute\ntruths” is absolutely self-refuting (Mackie 1964: 200). But the\nrelativists reject the quick move that presupposes the very conception\nof truth they are at pains to undermine and have offered sophisticated\napproaches of defense. A good example of such a defense is\nHales’ (1997)—who uses a “u” operator to\nrepresent “It is true in some perspectives that” and a\n“n” operator to represent “It is true in all\nperspectives that”—in order to establish that there could\nindeed be a consistent relativist logic which avoids the charge of\nself-refutation. Key to this approach, according to Hales, is that we\nabandon a conception of global relativism on which the lose thesis\n“everything is relative” is embraced—a thesis Hales\nconcedes to be inconsistent—for the thesis “everything\nthat is true is relatively true”, which he maintains is not\n(cf. Shogenji 1997 for a criticism of Hales on this\npoint). It has also been claimed that alethic relativism gives rise to what\nJ.L. Mackie calls “operational” (Mackie 1964: 202) and Max\nKölbel “conversational” self-refutation (Kölbel\n2011) by flouting one or more crucial norms of discourse and thereby\nundermines the very possibility of coherent discourse. One version of\nthe argument, advanced most notably by Gareth Evans (1985:\n346–63), begins with the premise that a publicly shared\ndistinction between correct and incorrect, and hence true and false,\nassertion is a necessary condition for coherent assertoric\ndiscourse. As Evans puts it, a theory that permits a subject to deduce merely that a\nparticular utterance is now correct but later will be incorrect\n… cannot assist the subject in deciding what to say, nor in\ninterpreting the remarks of others. What should we aim at, or take\nothers to be aiming at?. (1985: 349) And if truth is relative, then there is no single\nshared definite aim for any given assertion (see MacFarlane\n2014: ch. 12 for a discussion). The relativists however, could\nrespond that truth is relative to a group (conceptual scheme,\nframework) and they take speakers to be aiming a truth relative to\nthe scheme that they and their interlocutors are presumed to\nshare. The difficulty with this approach is that it seems to make\ncommunication across frameworks impossible. Such a response, however, will be answerable to the charge of\nincoherence raised by Donald Davidson against both alethic and\nconceptual relativism. According to Davidson, the principle of\ncharity—the assumption that other speakers by and large speak\ntruly (by our lights)—is a pre-requisite of all interpretation.\nHe takes this to imply that there could not be languages or conceptual\nschemes that we cannot in principle understand and interpret, in other\nwords, if a system of signs L is not recognizable as a language\nby us then L is not a language. Languages are either\ninter-translatable and hence not radically different from ours, or\nincommensurable and beyond our ability to recognize them as languages\n(Davidson 1974). The relativist, in effect, places other speakers and\ntheir languages beyond our recognitional reach and thereby undermines\nthe initial claim that they could be radically different or\nincommensurable. New Relativism, as we shall see, offers a novel take on the old\nquestion of alethic relativism and gives weight to Alasdair\nMacIntyre’s observation that relativism may have been refuted a\nnumber of times too often, whereas genuinely refutable doctrines only\nneed to be refuted once (MacIntyre 1982: 22). Claims to knowledge and justification have proven receptive to\nrelativistic interpretations. Epistemic relativism is the thesis that\ncognitive norms that determine what counts as knowledge, or whether a\nbelief is rational, justifiable, etc. could vary with and are\ndependent on local conceptual or cultural frameworks and lack the\nuniversality they aspire or pretend to. The three key assumptions\nunderlying epistemic relativism are: The epistemic relativist, as Paul Boghossian in developing his\ntrenchant criticisms of relativism points out, is committed to a\n“doctrine of equal validity”, the view that “there\nare many radically different, incompatible, yet, ‘equally\nvalid’ ways of knowing the world, with science being just one of\nthem” (Boghossian 2006a: 2). The relativist’s key claim is\nthat either we can chauvinistically maintain that our epistemic system\nis superior to all or accept the equal legitimacy of varying epistemic\nsystems. One crucial question facing epistemic relativism is how to identify\nand individuate alternative epistemic systems. The intuitive idea is\nthat varying and possibly incompatible cognitive principles,\nground-level beliefs and presuppositions, or what Wittgenstein calls\n“hinge” and “bedrock” propositions\n(Wittgenstein 1969: §§341–343) separate non-convergent\nepistemic schemes. A simple and quite commonly used example is the\ncontrast between scientific and religious belief systems. Boghossian,\nfor instance, uses the debate between Galileo and Cardinal Bellarmine\nas a case study of an encounter between antagonists operating within\nputatively different epistemic frameworks, who use different\nframeworks, or as Rorty (1979) put it “grids”, for\ndetermining what would count as appropriate evidence on planetary\nmovements. The relativist claims that there is no fact of the matter\nabout whether the Copernican theory or the geocentric view is\njustified by the evidence, “for there are no absolute facts\nabout what justifies what” (Boghossian 2006a: 62) while the\nanti-relativist attempts to show the unintelligibility or the\nimplausibility of such a claim. Boghossian has been criticized however for his characterization of\nepistemic relativism. One notable such criticism has been advanced by\nCrispin Wright (2008), who takes issue with Boghossian’s\nattributing to the epistemic relativist a version\nof (a) above, what Boghossian\ncalls epistemic relationism, or the thesis that any claim of\nthe form “Evidence E justifies belief B”, if\nit is to have any prospect of being true, must be construed as\nexpressing the claim According to the epistemic system C, that I,\nS accept, information E justifies belief B\n(Boghossian 2006a:73). Having characterized the relativist’s\nposition in this fashion, Boghossian suggests—after considering\nvarious ways of articulating what the relativist might say about\nthe untruth of claims of the form “Evidence E\njustifies belief B”—that the relativist is left,\nultimately, with no coherent way to account for how she should count\nas accepting or adhering to a given epistemic system. And on this\nbasis, Boghossian concludes that there is no coherent way to formulate\nthe position because the relativist in formulating his position and\nsetting up the opposition between two or more alternative\nnon-convergent epistemic systems cannot but assume the universality of\nat least some epistemic principles, including deduction, induction,\nwarrant through empirical evidence, etc. (see Boghossian 2006a). As Wright sees it, however, Boghossian’s attributing the\nrelationist clause to the epistemic relativist is to simply fail to take seriously the thesis that claims such\nas [Evidence E justifies belief B] can indeed by true or\nfalse, albeit only relatively so. (Wright 2008: 383, our\nitalics) Moreover, Wright argues, the epistemic relationist clause\nBoghossian includes in the kind of epistemic relativism he challenges\nbetrays a failure to distinguish between (i) making a judgment in the\nlight of certain standards and (ii) judging that those standards\nmandate that judgment.  (See also MacFarlane (2008b and Carter &\nMcKenna forthcoming for different critiques of Boghossian’s argument\nagainst the epistemic relativist.) Conceptions of rationality, and its key components of logic and\njustification, are some of the principles that are often used to\ndifferentiate between epistemic systems. Below we look at attempts at\nrelativizing each. Earlier defenses of epistemic relativism centered on the idea of\nalternative rationalities and were often developed as a reaction to\nthe charge of irrationality leveled at non-Western tribal people.\nRationality traditionally is seen as a cognitive virtue as well as a\nhallmark of the scientific method. The complex notion of rationality\nis intimately tied to requirements of consistency, justification,\nwarrant and evidence for beliefs. Relativists about rationality cast\ndoubt on the universal applicability of one or more of these features\nof rational thought, and deem them merely local epistemic values.\nPeter Winch’s treatment of E.E. Evans-Pritchard’s account\nof the Azande tribe’s beliefs in witchcraft and magic is now a\nclassic of the “rationality wars” of the 1960s and 70s.\nWinch had argued that since standards of rationality in different\nsocieties do not always coincide, we should use only contextually and\ninternally given criteria of rationality in our assessment of the\nsystems of belief of other cultures and societies. Under the influence\nof the later Wittgenstein, he maintained that it does not make sense\nto speak of a universal standard of rationality because what is\nrational is decided by a backdrop of norms governing a given language\nand form of life. As outside observers, we are not in a position to\nimpute irrationality or illogicality to the Azande or any other group\nwhose practices and language-games may differ from ours. Critics of\nWinch, Steven Lukes, for instance, using considerations reminiscent of\nDavidson’s principle of charity, have argued that we will not be\nin a position to understand a language or culture with standards of\nrationality radically different from ours, and that we must have at\nleast some core principles, or what Martin Hollis had called a\n“bridgehead” with elements such as consistency and the\ngoal of truth, in common with the Azande in order to understand them\n(Hollis 1968; Lukes 1970). They, thereby, conclude that an all-out or\nstrong relativism about rationality is not tenable.  The weaker claim\nis that some elements of rationality, for instance what counts as good\nevidence or a better style of reasoning, could vary with historic\nconditions and traditions of enquiry and therefore a degree of\nrelativization of such norms, without succumbing to irrationalism, is\nacceptable (see Hacking 1982 and MacIntyre 1988).  Being rational also means having warrant, in the form of good\nreasons and justification for one’s beliefs. Epistemic\nrelativists maintain that the legitimacy of a justificatory system and\nthe presumed strength of epistemic warrants are decided locally.\nRichard Rorty has made the influential claim that there is nothing to be said about either truth or\nrationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of\njustification which a given society—ours—uses in\none or another area of inquiry. (Rorty 1991: 23) For Rorty, warrant is a “sociological\nmatter, to be ascertained by observing the reception of [a\nspeaker’s] statement by her peers” (1993: 449). Rorty also\nclaims that knowledge and truth are compliments “paid to beliefs\nwhich we think so well justified that, for the moment, further\njustification is not needed” (Rorty 1991: 24) where the\n“we” is a historically conditioned community of\nenquirers. Rorty rejects the label “relativist” because he\ninsists that, unlike the relativists, he does not subscribe to the\nview that all beliefs are equally true or good. He calls his position\n“ethnocentrism”, because the only form of warrant\navailable to any of us is the one provided through solidarity with our\npeers.  His rejection of the label “relativist” has had\nlittle effect on critics such as Hilary Putnam\n(1999) or Paul Boghossian\n(2006a) who do not see the distinction Rorty wishes to draw between\nhis brand of ethnocentrism and relativism Debates about the scope and authority of logic are also focal to\ndiscussions of rationality. The argument for relativism about logic is\nusually traced to the French anthropologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl\n(1857–1939) who claimed that tribal or “primitive”\ncultures did not subscribe to universal laws of logic such as the\nprinciples of non-contradiction and identity and were in a pre-logical\nstage of thinking (Lévy-Bruhl 1922/1923). In a posthumous\npublication, Lévy-Bruhl renounced his earlier views, finding\nthem “simplistic and rather crude” (Lévy-Bruhl\n1949/1975: 48) but he remains the standard bearer for relativism about\nlogic. Peter Winch’s interpretation of the Azande material became\nthe impetus for a new wave of arguments for relativism about\nlogic. Barry Barnes and David Bloor, for instance, have argued that\ndifferent societies may have incompatible but internally coherent\nsystems of logic because validity and rules of inference are defined\nby, and hence are relative to, the practices of a given community,\nrather than a priori universal restrictions on all\nthought. According to Bloor, The Azande have the same psychology as us but\nradically different institutions. If we relate logic to the psychology\nof reasoning we shall be inclined to say that they have the same\nlogic; if we relate logic more closely to the institutional framework\nof thought then we shall incline to the view that the two cultures\nhave different logics. (Bloor 1976: 129–130) Even the status of “contradictions”\nis at times seen as culturally relative and the Azande’s\napplication of witchcraft in determining guilt is cited as an\nexample. The Azande, according to Evans-Prichard, believe that it is\npossible to identify a witch by examining the contents of his\nintestine (through the use of a poison oracle). They also believe\nthat Witchhood is inherited patrilineally.  Since the Azande clan\nmembers are related to each other through the male line, it follows\nthat if one person is shown to be a witch, then all the members of\nhis clan must also be witches. Evans-Pritchard tells us that although\nthe Azande see the sense of this argument they do not accept the\nconclusion; they seem to side-step the contradiction in their\nbelief-system. Relativistically inclined commentators have argued\nthat the Azande both do and do not contradict themselves depending\non, or relative to, the culture that is being taken as the vantage\npoint (Bloor 1976: 124 and Jennings 1989: 281). See Seidel (2014) for\na sustained critique. More recently, Peng and Nisbett, using experimental data, have\nargued that Chinese and American students have different attitudes\ntowards the Law of Non-Contradiction. The Chinese, they claim, are\nmore willing to accept that conflicting views may be compatible and\ntherefore are less disposed to recognize or condemn contradictions\n(Peng & Nisbett 1999). In his The Geography of Thought\n(2003), Nisbett has generalized his results to claim that Asian and\nEuropean structures of thinking, including perception and\nconceptualization, differ significantly. Nisbitt’s data, as well as the claims by Barnes and Bloor,\nare contributions to a long-standing debate about the status of logic.\nTheir approach attempts to naturalize logic by tying it to actual\npractices of the human subjects. The relativistically inclined,\nhowever, argue that to think of logic as singular, a priori, and\nuniversal speaks of a philosophical prejudice and does not sit well\nwith a naturalistic and scientific attitude. As to the claim by Quine\nand Davidson, that an allegedly illogical culture is in fact a\nmisinterpreted or badly interpreted culture—that if the speakers\nof a language seem to accept sentence of the form “P and\nnot-P”, this is conclusive evidence that\n“and” and “not” in their language do not mean\nwhat these words mean in English (Quine 1960)—the relativists and their sympathisers point out that reasoning in deviant ways is\nquite common and is not an impediment to understanding or translating\nothers (e.g., Stich 2012). They further argue that such diversity is\nbetter explained by the relativist’s claim that the correctness\nof the principles of reasoning is relative to their cultural\nbackground rather than by the absolutist approach that attributes\nwholesale error to alternative epistemic systems or to the members of\nother cultures. \nA different line of support for relativism about logic starts with\npluralism about logic, the view that there can be a multitude of\ncorrect but not fully compatible conceptions of logic where differing\naccounts of logical consequence, logical connectives or even validity\nare on offer. Relativism ensues if we also assume that there is no\nneutral framework for adjudicating between the differing accounts.\nWhat counts as a correct account of logical consequence and validity\nor even the choice of logical vocabulary are relative to the system of\nlogic that embed and justify these accounts and choices. (See\nSteinberger 2019 for a useful survey.) \nStewart Shapiro (2014) is probably the most vocal defender of this\napproach. His argument for relativism about logic is similar to\ndefences of relativism in other areas where intractable differences in\na particular domain and an inability to reconcile them are used as the\nmotivators for relativism. Shapiro advocates what, following Crispin\nWright, he calls “folk-relativism” and its slogan that “There is no\nsuch thing as simply being Φ” (Shapiro, 2014: 7; Wright 2008a:\n158) and applies it to validity and logical consequence. The claim is\nthat there are different conceptions of logical consequence. in\nclassical and non-classical logic, which although not compatible can\nstill capture correct accounts of the idea of logical\nconsequence. Therefore, it does not make sense to think that there is\na uniquely correct conception of validity and logical\nconsequence. Different conceptions can be legitimate in so far as each\nis (internally) consistent and also non-trivial in the sense that it\nis the basis a workable mathematical systems, i.e., the means of\nmaking sense of “the practice of pursuing and applying mathematics”\n(Shapiro 2014: 81). Intuitionism and fuzzy logic are notable examples.\nChoices between different logical vocabularies also can lead to a\nrelativized conception of logic in so far a these vocabularies play a\ndecisive role in generating different relations of logical\nconsequence. \nFor further discussion, see the entry on \n  logical pluralism. Discussions of relativism about science gained currency with the\npublication of Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions (1962) and the emergence of a historicist approach to\nquestion of change and progress in science. Pronouncements such as In so far as their only recourse to [the] world is\nthrough what they see and do, we may want to say that after a\nrevolution scientists are responding to a different world (Kuhn 1970\n[1962]: 111) and The very ease and rapidity with which astronomers\nsaw new things when looking at old objects with old instruments may\nmake us wish to say that, after Copernicus, astronomers lived in a\ndifferent world (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 117) were taken to suggest that not only standards of\nepistemic appraisal but even the data gathered by scientists were, to\na significant extent, determined by governing paradigms and hence\nrelative to them. Although Kuhn stepped back from such radical\nrelativism, his views gave currency to relativistic interpretations\nof science (though see Sankey 2018). Relativism about science is motivated by considerations arising\nfrom the methodology and history of science (Baghramian 2007). As we\nsaw in §4.2, Quine has argued that\n Physical theories can be at odds with each other\nand yet compatible with all possible data even in the broadest\npossible sense. In a word, they can be logically incompatible and\nempirically equivalent. (1970: 179)   Relativists about science have argued that only with the addition\nof auxiliary hypotheses could the scientist choose between various\ntheories and that such auxiliary hypotheses are colored by socially\nand historically grounded norms as well as by personal and group\ninterests. Paul Feyerabend’s “democratic\nrelativism”—the view that different societies may look at\nthe world in different ways and regard different things as acceptable\n(1987: 59) and that we need to give equal voice to these differing\nperspectives—is one instance of the use of the\nunderdetermination thesis in support of relativism. According to\nFeyerabend, underdetermination ultimately demonstrates that  for every statement, theory, point of view\nbelieved (to be true) with good reason there exist arguments showing a\nconflicting alternative to be at least as good, or even better. (1987:\n76) Larry Laudan usefully lists the ways\nunderdetermination is used to motivate relativism or its proximate\ndoctrines. He says:  Lakatos and Feyerabend have taken the\nunderdetermination of theories to justify the claim that the only\ndifference between empirically successful and empirically unsuccessful\ntheories lies in the talents and resources of their respective\nadvocates (i.e., with sufficient ingenuity, more or less any theory\ncan be made to look methodologically respectable). Hesse and Bloor\nhave claimed that underdetermination shows the necessity for bringing\nnoncognitive, social factors into play in explaining the theory\nchoices of scientists (on the grounds that methodological and\nevidential considerations alone are demonstrably insufficient to\naccount for such choices). H. M. Collins, and several of his fellow\nsociologists of knowledge, have asserted that underdetermination lends\ncredence to the view that the world does little if anything to shape\nor constrain our beliefs about it. (Laudan 1990: 321) Laudan even connects Derrida’s deconstructionism and the view\nthat texts do not lend themselves to determinate readings with\nunderdetermination (ibid.). He also believes that an appropriately\nmodest understanding of what underdetermination entails will distance\nit from relativism, but most relativistically inclined advocates of\nunderdetermination are not willing to follow Laudan’s advice to\ncircumscribe its scope. The key issue is that both the relativists and\nthe anti-relativists could agree that the totality of evidence\navailable does not prove the truth of any given theory. But the\nanti-relativists responds to this fact of underdetermination by\npointing out that the we have good reasons for embracing the best\ntheory available and moreover that there are indeed objective facts\nabout the world, even if we are not in possession of them. The\nrelativist, in contrast, argues that there are many, equally\nacceptable principles for accepting theories, all on the basis of\nevidence available, but such theories could result in very different\nverdicts. They also argue that in the absence of any strong epistemic\ngrounds for accepting the existence of absolute facts in any given\ndomain, we have no grounds, other than some kind of metaphysical\nfaith, for thinking that there are such facts. Relativism about science is also influenced by the related doctrine\nthat all observations are theory-laden. Even anti-relativists such as\nKarl Popper admit that the idea that observations are not in some way\ntinted by theoretical assumptions is naïve. But some relativists\nabout science offer a particularly extreme form of the doctrine of the\nwidely accepted thesis of theory-ladenness. Feyerabend, for instance,\ngoes so far as to argue that different systems of classification can\nresult in perceptual objects that are not easily comparable. Relativists about science also point to the prevalence of both\nsynchronic and diachronic disagreement among scientists as a\njustification of their view. Looking at the history of science, Kuhn\nand his followers argued that Aristotelian physics presupposes a\ntotally different conception of the universe compared to Newtonian\nphysics; the same is true of Einsteinian physics compared to its\npredecessors. Moreover, these differing conceptions may be\nincommensurable in the sense that they are not readily amenable to\ncomparison or inter-theoretical translation. There are also strong and\nunresolved disagreements between scientists working\ncontemporaneously. The many different interpretations of quantum\nmechanics are a case in point. Anti-relativist philosophers of science are often willing to\nconcede all three points above, but insist that they do not, singly or\njointly, justify the claim that scientific knowledge, in any\nphilosophically interesting sense, is relative to its context of\nproduction. The success of science, both theoretical and applied,\nindicates that progress does take place. Fallibilism, the view that\nall scientific claims are provisional and liable to fail, they argue,\nis sufficient for dealing with difficulties arising from\nconsiderations of underdetermination and theory-ladenness of\nobservations. Relativism, with its attendant denial that there could\nbe objective and universal scientific truths or knowledge exacts too\nhigh a price for dealing with these allegedly troublesome features of\nthe methodology and history of science. Social constructionism is a particularly radical form of conceptual\nrelativism with implications for our understanding of the methodology\nand subject matter of the sciences. According to social\nconstructionism, nature as studied by scientists does not come carved\nat its joints (to use Plato’s metaphor from Phaedrus:\n265d–266a). Reality—with its objects, entities, properties\nand categories—is not simply “out there” to be\ndiscovered only by empirical investigation or observation; rather, it\nis constructed through a variety of norm-governed socially sanctioned\ncognitive activities such as interpretation, description, manipulation\nof data, etc. Social constructionism has relativistic consequences\ninsofar as it claims that different social forces lead to the\nconstruction of different “worlds” and that there is no\nneutral ground for adjudicating between them. The “Science\nStudies” approach of Bruno Latour is a prime example of\nconstructionism with relativistic consequences. Latour and Woolgar\n(1986) have argued that so-called “scientific facts” and\nthe “truths” of science emerge out of social and\nconceptual practices and inevitably bear their imprints. This is\nbecause the very idea of a mind-independent reality open to scientific\nstudy, or as they call it “out-there-ness”, itself is the\nconsequence of scientific work rather than the cause. A crucial\ndifference between scientific realists and constructionists is that\nwhereas the realists see nature and society as the causes\nthat explain the outcomes of scientific enquiry, for the\nconstructionists the activity of scientists and engineers and of all their human\nand non-human allies is the cause, of which various states of nature\nand societies are the consequence. (Callon & Latour 1992:\n350–1) Scientific theories are also products of socially constituted\npractices. They are  contextually specific constructions which bear\nthe mark of the situated contingency and interest structure of the\nprocess by which they are generated. (Knorr-Cetina 1981:\n226) So called “scientific facts” and\n“natural kinds”, the primary subjects of scientific\ninvestigation are, at least in part, the products of the contingent\nsocial and epistemic norms that define the very subject matter of\nscience. It may be argued that the view, if taken literally, entails\na counter-intuitive form of backward causation to the effect that,\nfor instance, the scientific facts about dinosaur anatomy 50 million\nyears ago were caused in the 20th century when a\nscientific consensus about dinosaur anatomy was formed (see\nBoghossian 2006a). But constructionism, at least in its most extreme\nform, accepts this consequence, insisting that there are indeed no\nfacts except for socially constructed ones, created and modified at\nparticular times and places courtesy of prevailing theoretical and\nconceptual frameworks. Moral or ethical relativism is simultaneously the most influential\nand the most reviled of all relativistic positions. Supporters see it\nas a harbinger of tolerance (see §2.6),\nopen-mindedness and anti-authoritarianism. Detractors think it\nundermines the very possibility of ethics and signals either confused\nthinking or moral turpitude.  Briefly stated, moral relativism is the view that moral judgments,\nbeliefs about right and wrong, good and bad, not only vary greatly\nacross time and contexts, but that their correctness is dependent on\nor relative to individual or cultural perspectives and\nframeworks.  Moral subjectivism is the view that\nmoral judgments are judgments about contingent and variable\nfeatures of our moral sensibilities. For the subjectivist, to say that\nabortion is wrong is to say something like, “I disapprove of\nabortion”, or “Around here, we disapprove of\nabortion”. Once the content of the subjectivist’s claim is\nmade explicit, the truth or acceptability of a subjectivist moral\njudgment is no longer a relative matter. Moral relativism proper, on\nthe other hand, is the claim that facts about right and wrong vary\nwith and are dependent on social and cultural background. Understood\nin this way, moral relativism could be seen as a sub-division of\ncultural relativism. Values may also be relativized to frameworks of\nassessment, independent of specific cultures or social settings. Moral relativism, like most relativistic positions, comes in\nvarious forms and strengths. It is customary to distinguish between\ndescriptive or empirical, prescriptive or normative, and meta-ethical\nversions of moral relativism. These views in turn are motivated by a\nnumber of empirical and philosophical considerations similar to those\nintroduced in defense of cultural relativism.  The purported fact of ethical diversity, the claim\nthat there are no universally agreed moral norms or values, conjoined\nwith the intractability of the arguments about them, are the core\ncomponents of descriptive moral relativism. The anti-relativists\ncounter-argue that the observed diversity and lack of convergence in\nlocal norms can in fact be explained by some very general universal\nnorms, which combine with the different circumstances (or false\nempirical beliefs) of the different groups to entail different\nparticular norms. The objectivist thereby can accommodate diversity\nand lack of agreement at this higher level of generalization (see\nPhilippa Foot (1982) for this type of argument). As in the case of cultural relativism, the imperative of tolerance\nis often seen as a normative reason for adopting moral relativism.\nMoral relativism, it is argued, leads to tolerance by making us not\nonly more open-minded but also alerting us to the limitations of our\nown views. Edward Westermarck, for instance, in his early classic\ndefense of relativism writes:  Could it be brought home to people that there is\nno absolute standard in morality, they would perhaps be on the one\nhand more tolerant and on the other more critical in their\njudgments. (Westermarck 1932: 59) Critics however point out that for the consistent relativist\ntolerance can be only a framework-dependent virtue, while Westermarck,\nand others, seem to recommend it as a universal desideratum. A second\nproblem with arguing for normative moral relativism on the grounds of\ntolerance is known as the Argumentum ad Nazium.  Relativists,\nas this argument goes, are not in a position to condemn even the most\nabhorrent of worldviews as they are forced to admit that every point\nof view is right (relative to the perspective of its\nbeholder). W.T. Stace, arguing against Westermarck’s relativism\ngives an early example of this type of criticism:  Certainly, if we believe that any one moral standard\nis as good as any other, we are likely to be more tolerant. We shall\ntolerate widow-burning, human sacrifice, cannibalism, slavery, the\ninfliction of physical torture, or any other of the thousand and one\nabominations which are, or have been, from time approved by moral code\nor another.  But this is not the kind of toleration that we want, and\nI do not think its cultivation will prove “an advantage to\nmorality”. (Stace 1937: 58–59) More moderate forms of normative moral relativism, positions that\nsometimes are characterized as moral pluralism, have been defended by\nDavid Wong (2006) and David Velleman (2013). Moderate moral\nrelativists endorse the idea of diversity and plurality of ethical\nvalues and accept that such values are justified according to\ndiffering local normative frameworks, but they avoid a full blown\n“anything goes” relativism by maintaining that all such\nframeworks are ultimately answerable to conditions for human\nflourishing and other overarching universal constraints such as the\nvalue of accommodation (Wong 2006). (It should however be noted that\nwhile theses under the description of pluralism needn’t entail a\ncommitment to relativism, some formulations of relativism (such as\nBoghossian’s 2006b), include, as an essential ingredient, a\n“pluralist” clause. Whether particular instances of moral\npluralism entail moral relativism depends entirely on the details of\nrelevant claim to pluralism).  Metaethical versions of moral relativism are often motivated by the\nthought that ethical positions, unlike scientific beliefs, are not apt\nfor objective truth-evaluation. Strong realists about science such as\nGilbert Harman have argued that the intractability of moral\ndisagreements, the absence of convergence in ethics as opposed to the\nnatural sciences and mathematics, point to fundamental differences\nbetween natural facts and ethical values (Harman & Thompson\n1996). This is a metaethical, rather than a descriptive or normative\nposition, because it is a theory about the nature of ethics or\nmorality. The ethical domain, Harman argue, is such that all relevant\nevaluations could be undertaken only in the context of social norms or\npersonal preferences and commitments.  Values are not\nobjective—they are not part of the fabric of the\nuniverse. Rather they always arise from some form of convention and\nagreement among people. Therefore, there can be no objective or\nexternally justified ethical knowledge or judgment (Harman 1975). In\nthis sense, metaethical relativism shares common concerns with\nnon-cognitivist approaches to ethics. What distinguishes it, however,\nis the insistence on the part of metaethical relativists that moral\njudgments contain an implicit relativization to the speaker’s\nmoral outlook (Dreier 2006: 261). It is possible to talk about the\ntruth or falsity of a moral judgment but only in the context of\npre-existing standards or value systems. For instance, we can ask\nquestions about just actions or judgments in the context of standards\nof justice prevalent in a society at a given time; but questions about\nthe objective standing of these standards do not make sense (cf., Boghossian 2017). (For\nfurther discussion of moral relativism see the separate entry on this\ntopic. What has become known as New Moral Relativism will be discussed\nbelow). There is a recent version of relativism according to which some of\nthe views considered so far—for instance, Harman’s (1975)\nvariety of moral relativism—will be regarded varieties\nof contextualism as opposed to bona fide relativism.\nThis recent version—sufficiently distinct from the relativisms\nso far considered that it is deserving of attention in its own\nright—we are calling “New Relativism”, a variety of\nrelativism that has arisen out of work in the philosophy of language\nin the analytic tradition, and for which the leading proponents have\nincluded Max Kölbel (2003, 2004), Peter Lasersohn (2005), Crispin\nWright (2006) and, in particular, John MacFarlane (2005b, 2007, 2014);\ncf., Marques (2019).  In this section we aim to (i) outline several\nfeatures that individuate New Relativism; (ii) consider in turn\nmotivations for (and objections to) several prominent strands of it;\nand, finally, (iii) conclude with some philosophical problems that\nface New Relativism more generally. It is a commonplace that the truth-value of an utterance can depend\non the context in which it is uttered. If you say “I’m\nhappy” and I say the same sentence, your utterance may be true\nand mine false. In such cases, the context of utterance plays a role\nin determining which proposition the sentence expresses. This can\nhappen even when the sentence does not contain an overtly indexical\nexpression. Thus Harman and Dreier hold that a statement of the form\n“A is wrong” is roughly equivalent to\n“A is wrong according to the moral system I\naccept”. So two utterances of (say) “Torture is\nwrong” can differ in truth-value if they are uttered by speakers\nwho accept very different moral systems. Contextualists about\n(for instance) moral, aesthetic and epistemic discourse will view\nmoral, aesthetic and epistemic expressions likewise as indexical\nexpressions but (as we’ll see) with some difficulty explaining\napparent genuine disagreement in these areas of discourse. On\nthis point, New Relativists claim an important advantage over\ncontextualists. New relativism, by contrast with\ncontextualism, aims to achieve this advantage via a much less\nfamiliar form of context dependence. Truth-relativism with respect to utterances in area of\ndiscourse D is the claim that, following MacFarlane’s\nnotable version of the view: the truth\nof S’s D-utterance u depends (in part) on\na context of assessment; that is (and in short) what S\nasserts, u, gets a truth value—according to the\ntruth-relativist’s D-semantics—only once\nthe D-standard of the assessor is\nspecified. Independent of the specification of such a\nstandard, S’s u assertion lacks a truth-value much\nas, by comparison, indexical expressions such as “The barn is\nnearby” do not get a truth-value independent of contextual facts\nabout the context of use (i.e. the context in which the\nutterance is made). And, as a further point of clarification here:\nwhile the contextualist can, no less than the relativist, recognize a\n“standards” or “judge” parameter, for the\ncontextualist, its value will be supplied by the context\nof use, whereas the relativist takes it to be supplied\ncompletely independently of the context of use, by the context of\nevaluation (or, as MacFarlane calls it, the context of\nassessment). To see how this view is claimed to offer a satisfying take on\ndisagreement in types of discourse (see Beddor 2019), consider a simple example, concerning predicates of\npersonal taste. A utters, “Pretzels are tasty”,\nand B utters, “Pretzels are not tasty”. While the\nsemantic invariantist (for whom the truth-value of taste\npredications is in no way context sensitive) will insist that the\nabove exchange constitutes a genuine disagreement about whether\npretzels are tasty and that at least one party is wrong,\ncontextualists and truth-relativists have the prima facie\nadvantageous resources to avoid the result that at least one party to\nthe apparent disagreement has made a mistake. The contextualist claims that the truth-evaluable content\nexpressed by A’s utterance encodes A’s\nstandards (cf. non-indexical contextualism). Thus,\nin this apparent disagreement, the proposition expressed by A\nis “Pretzels are tasty relative to my [A’s]\nstandards” while B expresses the proposition\n“Pretzels are not tasty relative to my [B’s]\nstandards”. This maneuver avoids the result that at least one of\nthe two parties has uttered something false, but (as the new\nrelativist points out) this result comes at the price of being unable\nto offer a clear explanation of our intuition that there is some\nuniform content about which A and B disagree. The new relativist, on the other hand, claims to be able to\npreserve both the apparent subjectivity of taste\ndiscourse and (and, unlike the contextualist) our intuition\nthat exchanges of the form mentioned constitute genuine\ndisagreements. They do this by first insisting (unlike the\ncontextualist—though see Suikkanen 2019) that there is a single truth-evaluable proposition\nwhich A affirms and B denies. In the case where A\nsays “Pretzels are tasty”, and B denies this, there\nis a uniform content that is affirmed by A’s utterance\nand denied by B’s, namely the proposition that\npretzels are tasty, period. So we have a genuine\ndisagreement. Unlike the truth-absolutist, however, the new relativist\nwill add that the disagreement is faultless because the\nproposition affirmed in A’s utterance has a truth value\nonly relative to a judge or standards parameter, and\nin this case: A’s standards, when A is the\nassessor, B’s standards, when B is the\nassessor. Hence, the truth-relativist about predicates of personal\ntaste will, by insisting that the truth of Pretzels are tasty\ndepends on the context of assessment, allow a single proposition to be\n(at the same time): New Relativist views, which endorse truth-relativism\nlocally for some domain of discourse, stand in opposition to the more\ntraditional view of propositional content (what Cappelen &\nHawthorne call “The Simple View”) according to which\npropositions bear truth and falsity as monadic properties\n(cf.  however, MacFarlane 2011a for some resistance to Cappelen & Hawthorne’s\nclaim that this simple characterization should be regarded as the\n“received” view.) A key source of philosophical motivation for relativizing truth in\nthe fashion of New Relativism traces to Lewis’s (1980) and\nKaplan’s (1989) foundational work in semantics, according to which\nsentence truth is to be understood as relative to a circumstance of\nevaluation that includes world, time and location. New Relativists\ninherit the formal apparatus of Lewis and Kaplan and add another\nparameter, but their reasons for doing so are quite different from the\nreasons that motivated the framework in the first place. While\nLewis’s and Kaplan’s reasons for\n“proliferating” parameters were primarily based on\nconsiderations to do with intensional operators (though see Yli-Vakkuri et al. 2019), the more contemporary\nreasons for adding a judge or standard parameter are often to do with\nrespecting (for instance) disagreement data. (For further discussion\nhere, see\nKölbel (2015)). (Note that “old-style contextualism” can\nalso be stated in Kaplan’s framework; it involves variation in\ncontent with respect to the context of utterance rather than in truth\nvalue with respect to the circumstance of evaluation). Kaplan’s view specifically was that the need for particular\nparameters in the circumstance of evaluation was a function of\nthe non-specificity of certain propositional contents with\nrespect to world, time and location (see Kaplan’s (1989)\nanalysis of indexicals). On Kaplan’s view:  A circumstance will usually include a possible\nstate or history of the world, a time, and perhaps other features as\nwell. The amount of information we require from a circumstance is\nlinked to the degree of specificity of contents and thus to the kinds\nof operators in the language…. (1989: 502) John MacFarlane, a leading contemporary relativist, writes:  Taking this line of thought a little farther, the\nrelativist might envision contents that are “sense-of-humor\nneutral” or “standard-of-taste neutral” or\n“epistemic-state neutral”, and circumstances of evaluation\nthat include parameters for a sense of humor, a standard of taste or\nan epistemic state. This move would open up room for the truth value\nof a proposition to vary with these “subjective” factors\nin much the same way that it varies with the world of\nevaluation. (MacFarlane 2007: 6–7) Similarly, Cappelen and Hawthorne write:  Contemporary analytic relativists reason as follows:\n‘Lewis and Kaplan have shown that we need to relativize truth to\ntriples of <world, time, location>[’]. … But,\nhaving already started down this road, why not exploit these\nstrategies further? In particular, by adding new and exotic parameters\ninto the circumstances of evaluation, we can allow the contents of\nthought and talk to be non-specific (in Kaplan’s sense) along\ndimensions other than world, time and location. (2009:\n10; edited) A question on which New Relativists are divided, however,\nis: what contents are non-specific along dimensions other\nthan world, time and location? It is with respect to this general\nquestion that different families of New Relativism are generated. The taxonomy we offer is that a view falls within the category\nof New Relativism if, and only if, the view endorses a\ntruth-relativist semantics (as previously outlined) for utterance\ntokens in some domain of discourse, such as: discourse about\npredicates of personal taste (Lasersohn 2005; Kölbel 2003),\nepistemic modals (Egan 2007; Egan, Hawthorne & Weatherson\n2005; MacFarlane\n2011b; Stephenson\n2007), future contingents (MacFarlane 2003), indicative conditionals\n(Weatherson 2009; Kolodny & MacFarlane 2010) gradable adjectives\n(Richard 2004), deontic\nmodals (Kolodny & MacFarlane 2010 and MacFarlane 2014: ch. 11) and\nknowledge attributions (Richard 2004); MacFarlane 2005b, 2011c,\n2014). The motivations for truth-relativism in each of these domains\ninclude various considerations unique to those domains. We consider\nsome of the arguments for New Relativism in four of these domains in\nthe following sections. One area of discourse that has been particularly fertile ground for\nNew Relativism is discourse that concerns predicates of personal\ntaste (e.g., “tasty” and “fun”.) Take a case where Mary says: “The chili is tasty” and\nJohn says, “The chili is not tasty”. Lasersohn argues\n(much as Kölbel does) that only the truth-relativist can\nmake sense of the nature of John and Mary’s disagreement: It is\na genuine disagreement. One affirms what the other denies.  And yet\nneither is wrong. Lasersohn argues that there is an elegant way to\nmake sense of the idea that John and Mary are both (in some sense)\nright, even though John asserts the negation of what is expressed by\nMary. What Lasersohn) suggests, more formally, is the introduction of\na judge parameter.  Instead of treating the content of a sentence as a\nset of time-world pairs, we should treat it as a set of\ntime-world-individual triples. We assume that the content will provide\nan individual to be used in evaluating the sentences for truth and\nfalsity, just as it provides a time and world. (Lasersohn: 2005:\n17) Lasersohn adds (2005: 23) that in order to maintain an\nauthentically subjective assignment of truth-values to\nsentences containing predicates of personal taste, we must allow that\nthe objective facts of the situation of utterance do not uniquely\ndetermine a judge. But who is the judge? Typically, it\nis us, and when it is, the evaluation is from what Lasersohn\ncalls an autocentric perspective. Importantly, Lasersohn\nallows that in certain circumstances we take an exocentric\nperspective when assessing predicates of personal taste:\nassessing these sentences for truth relative to contexts in which\nsomeone other than ourselves is specified as the judge (cf.\n“Come on, it’ll be fun!” “Is this fun?”\n(2005: 26); cf. Stanley (2005: 10) for a response to\nLasersohn’s program). Kölbel’s (2003) faultless disagreement argument\nfor relativism about predicates of personal taste features a\n“proof” that there is no faultless disagreement\nfollowed by a demonstration that the proof is indefensible. The proof\nproceeds from two premises: an equivalence schema and an apparent truism about mistakes: (ES) and (T) generate the conclusion that there is no faultless\ndisagreement through the following proof (see also Wright 2001:52) But because Kölbel takes (9) to be implausible in what\nKölbel takes to be “discretionary” (non-objective, as\nKölbel sees it) areas of discourse he contends that we should\nintroduce a relativized version of (T) to avoid the conclusion that at\nleast one party has made a mistake. Kölbel claims further that, for reasons of uniformity, we\nshould “relativize truth of all propositions across the\nboard…” and he accordingly endorses the following version\nof truth relativism: Kölbel (2003: 71) thinks that this position allows the\npossibility of maintaining that faultless disagreement is impossible\nin some non-discretionary (objective) areas, and this will\ndepend on the relation of perspective possession (but see also\nBoghossian 2011 for the contrary view). An implication of the position\nis that Kölbel’s view will allow assertions of the form:\n“Pretzels are not tasty, though John believes they are. And yet\nJohn is not mistaken”. For other discussions of faultless\ndisagreement, see Richard (2008), MacFarlane (2012, 2014: ch. 6), and\nZeman (2019). For an attempt to countenance faultless disagreement\nwithin an absolutist framework, see Baker & Robson (2017). There is a version of moral relativism (e.g., Kölbel\n2004) that falls squarely within the New Relativist tradition. We can\nthink of this relativism simply as a generalization of the position\njust discussed that treats moral terms (e.g.,\n“right”, “good”) as assessment-sensitive along\nwith predicates of personal taste. Such an extension faces problems analogous to those faced by\ntruth-relativists about predicates of personal taste (cf. \nBeebe (2010) for a helpful discussion of truth-relativist semantics\nversus varieties of contextualist competitors). A broader kind of problem for this semantic thesis (as well as to\nmoral relativists more generally), raised by Coliva and Moruzzi (2012)\nis that it succumbs to the progress argument, an argument\nthat famously challenges, in particular, cultural relativists (as well\nas indexical contextualists) about moral judgments by insisting that\nmoral progress is both evident and not something the relativist can\ncountenance (e.g., Rachels 2009). A third and particularly important\nkind of worry, addressed by Capps, Lynch and Massey (2009),\ninvolves explaining the source and nature of moral\nrelativity, on a truth-relativist framework. Specifically, they claim\nthat  we ought to have some account of why it\nis that truth in the moral domain is such that it varies with a\nparameter set by the context of assessment. (Capps, Lynch & Massey\n2009: 416) \nAn additional problem concerns the plausibility of simply extending disagreement based arguments for relativism about predicates of personal taste over to moral predicates like ‘right’ and ‘good’. As Wedgwood (2019) has suggested, moral disagreements, in a way that is disanalogous to  disagreements about what’s tasty, implicate a kind of ‘inexcusable irrationality’ (2019: 97)—at least, if the moral truths that constitute moral principles are a priori knowable. To the extent that there is a difference in inexcusability across the two cases of disagreement, it would be contentious to think that an argument from ‘faultless disagreement’ to relativism in the arena of predicates of personal taste would extend, mutatis mutandis, to an analogous argument in the moral arena. Epistemic modality (e.g., claims of the form “S might\nbe F”) is another particularly fertile ground for New\nRelativists. A key reason for this is the dialectical force\nof Eavesdropper Arguments, which attempt to show the perils\nof contextualist treatments of utterances containing epistemic\nmodals. Another prominent argument concerns metasemantic\ncomplexity. We will examine both of these argument strategies. But\nfirst, let’s distinguish epistemic modality\nfrom metaphysical modality. To say that p is\nmetaphysically possible is to say that p might have been\nthe case in the sense that: in some possible world, p is\ntrue. To say that p is epistemically possible is by\ncontrast to say that p might be the case, or\nthat p is the case for all we know (see the entry on\nVarieties of Modality).  A\ncanonical example of a statement expressing an epistemic modal is the\nclaim A might be F. The truth of claims of the\nform A might be F will depend on\nwhether F is an epistemic possibility for some individual or\ngroup, which is to say, that F must not be ruled out by what\nsome individual or group knows. But which individual or\ngroup? This is not always clear. As Egan and Weatherson (2011: 4)\nremark:  …statements of epistemic possibility in\nplain English do not make any explicit reference to such a person,\ngroup, evidence set, or information state. One of the key issues\nconfronting a semanticist attempting to theorize about epistemic\nmodals is what to do about this lack of reference. Eavesdropper-style cases highlight the difficulty of determining\nexactly which individual’s or group’s body of information\nis relevant to the truth of claims of epistemic possibility and are\ntaken by defenders of truth-relativism about epistemic modals to\nmotivate their position. A variety of different eavesdropper cases\nhave been given by different proponents (and attempted refuters) of\ntruth-relativism about epistemic modals in the literature. For ease of\nexposition, we will use an especially simple version of the case, from\nHawthorne’s (2007), slightly amended:  EAVESDROPPER: [Sandra] is on the way to the grocery\nstore. I hear her say: “Susan might be at the store. I could run\ninto her”. No party to the conversation that I am listening in\non knows that Susan is on vacation. But I know that she is. Despite\nthe fact that it is compatible with what the conversants know that\nSusan is in the store and that the speaker will run into her, I am\ninclined to judge the speaker’s [Sandra’s] modal judgments\nto be incorrect. (Hawthorne 2007: 92) Egan (2007), Egan, Hawthorne and Weatherson (2005) and MacFarlane\n(2011b) share a similar set\nof diagnoses here: (i) it seems that while Sandra and I disagree about\nthe truth value of Sandra’s statement, neither she nor I have\nmade a mistake; (ii) the contextualist can’t explain this; (iii)\nthe truth-relativist can. Why can’t the contextualist explain this? As noted, the truth\nof claims expressing epistemic modals must depend on what some\nindividual or group knows. But in these cases the context of\nuse does not pick out a single such individual or\ngroup. After all, if it did, then either Sandra or I would be wrong,\nbut it seems that neither of us is. That the context of use does not\nuniquely pick out one relevant body of knowledge for determining the\ntruth of epistemic modal statements is not, as MacFarlane notes,\nsomething that can be accommodated by “the framework of\ncontextualism, which requires that the relevant body of knowledge be\ndetermined by features of the context of use”. (MacFarlane 2011c) Additionally, as Egan and Weatherson (2011) suggest, any\ncontextualist account of the semantics of epistemic modals\nthat could handle eavesdropper-style cases in a principled\nway would be hideously complicated. This motivates a metasemantic\nargument against contextualism (and a corresponding argument for\nrelativism): if contextualism about epistemic modals is correct, then\nthe semantics for epistemic modals will be hideously complicated; the\nsemantics is not hideously complicated on the truth-relativist’s\nproposal, therefore, ceteris paribus, truth-relativism for\nepistemic modals is more plausible than contextualism. However,\nGlanzberg (2007) notably denies that metasemantic complexity in this\ncase must be problematic. How can the relativist accommodate eavesdropper cases? MacFarlane\n(2011b) articulates the relativist solution: Sandra and I disagree\nabout the truth-value of a single proposition, the\nproposition that Susan might be at the store. This proposition, even\nwhen fully articulated, makes no reference to any particular body of\nknowledge. But such propositions cannot be true or false\nsimpliciter. They are true only relative to a context of assessment\nthat includes a body of knowledge. In this case, the proposition is\ntrue relative to a context of assessment where what Sandra\nknows is operative—a context in which Sandra is the\nevaluator—and false relative to a context of assessment where\nwhat I know is operative because I am the evaluator. Thus:\nboth disagreement and faultlessness are preserved (cf. Ross\n& Schroeder 2013 for criticism and Kindermann & Egan (2019)\nfor an alternative proposal). Along with MacFarlane, Egan (2007) and Stephenson (2007) have also\noffered positive defenses of truth-relativism about epistemic modals;\ntheir defenses share MacFarlane’s view that propositions\nexpressing epistemic modals are non-specific along dimensions that\ninclude the body of information possessed by a judge or assessor. More recently, experimental philosophy has contributed to this\ndebate. Empirical studies reported by Knobe & Yalcin (2014) and\nKhoo (2015) indicate that folk judgments about the truth of claims\nfeaturing epistemic modals aligns more closely with what contextualism\nrather than relativism would predict. However, see Beddor and Egan\n(2019) for experimental results that are argued to better support (a\nversion of) relativism than contextualism. Propositions termed “future contingents” are about the\nfuture and their truth-values are not settled by the state of the\nworld in the past or present (see entry on\nFuture Contingents, and\nMacFarlane 2014: ch. 9). In a deterministic world there are no future\ncontingent statements in this sense. But in an indeterministic world,\nstatements partly about the future will often satisfy these\nconditions. Consider Aristotle’s oft-cited example: the\nproposition There will be a sea battle tomorrow, uttered\nat t. Contrast now two intuitions: the determinacy intuition\nthat utterances that “turned out true” were true at the\ntime of utterance; and the indeterminacy intuition that, at\nthe time of the utterance, multiple histories are possible, including\none where there was a sea battle and the proposition is true, and one\nwhere there was not, and the proposition is false.\nThe indeterminacy intuition leads us to think the truth-value\nof future contingents is indeterminate at the time of utterance, and\neither true or false at a later time (cf. MacFarlane 2003;\nCarter 2011). John MacFarlane (2003)\nthinks that both the indeterminacy intuition and\nthe determinacy intuition should be taken at face value and\nthat the only way to account for the semantics of future contingents\nis to allow the truth of future contingent statements to be, as he\nputs it, doubly relativized: to both the context of utterance and the\ncontext of assessment. When we evaluate a single token utterance of\n“There will be a sea battle tomorrow” produced on (say)\nMonday, this counts as neither true nor false when the context of\nassessment is the context in which the utterance is being made (as\nmultiple possible histories are open at this point). However the very\nsame statement will have a determinate truth-value relative to the\ncontext of assessment of the following day.  So we can have faultless\ntranstemporal disagreement about the truth-value of a single utterance\n(MacFarlane 2003: 36; cf. Carter 2011). MacFarlane (2005b) argues\nthat “know” is sensitive to the epistemic standards at\nplay in the context of assessment; that is, the extension of\n“know” varies with the context of assessment.  Much as the\nrelativist about future contingents aimed to accommodate both the\ndeterminacy and indeterminacy intuitions, the relativist about\n\nknowledge attributions can be viewed as offering an attempted\n\nsynthesis between the contextualist and both sensitive and insensitive\n\nvarieties of invariantist (see entry on\nEpistemic Contextualism).\nAs MacFarlane (2014: 190) puts it:  Invariantism is right that there is a single\n\nknowledge relation, and that the accuracy of knowledge ascriptions\ndoes not depend on which epistemic standard is relevant at the context\nof use. But contextualism is right that the accuracy of such\nascriptions depends somehow on contextually relevant\nstandards. Relativism seeks to synthesize these insights into a more\nsatisfactory picture. To apply this view, suppose George says, “Bill knows that his\ncar is in the driveway”, while Barry says, “Bill\ndoesn’t know that his car is in the driveway”. According\nto the relativist, the assessment of the truth-values of Bill’s\nand Barry’s statements depends also on the specification of some\nepistemic standard. For the truth-relativist, the standard will be the\noperative standard in the context of assessment. George’s\nutterance may be true (and Barry’s false) relative to a context\nof assessment in which ordinary “low” standards are in\nplace, whereas Barry’s may be true (and George’s false)\nrelative to a context of assessment in which high\n“Cartesian” standards are in place. See Stanley (2005:\nch. 7) for a detailed criticism of this position, though see also\nMacFarlane (2014: §8.5 for a reply). See also Richard\n(2004), for another\nversion of truth-relativism for knowledge attributions. In\nMacFarlane’s more recent (2014) defense of a truth-relativist\nsemantics for “knows”, the context of assessment is taken\nto fix which alternatives count as relevant. See, however, Carter 2015\nfor an argument that MacFarlane’s more recent view generates\ncounterintuitive results in cases of environmental epistemic luck\n(e.g., barn façade-style cases) and normative defeaters. We turn now to two general arguments against New Relativism in all\nits forms. The first is an argument from assertion, the\nsecond an argument from simplicity. Two assertion-related objections to New Relativism arise from work\nby Gareth Evans (1985) and Robert Stalnaker (1978), respectively.\nGreenough (2010: 2) concisely captures Evans’s challenge to\ntruth-relativism on assertoric grounds as follows: The relativist must plausibly take issue with (2) or (3), (or\nboth).  For an attempt to meet Evans’ challenge, MacFarlane has\ndefended a way to effectively reject (2) via what Marques has called a\n“meet-the-challenge” norm of assertion (cf.\nMacFarlane 2003; though see also his 2014: ch. 5; cf., Stanley 2016: 181–2)—according to\nwhich (à la Brandom 1983), in asserting p one\nundertakes a commitment to either defending p or giving\nup p if the challenge cannot be met satisfactorily (see\nKölbel (2004: 308) for some other discussions of this\nobjection). A related assertion-based challenge to truth-relativism emerges by\nappeal to Stalnaker’s (1978) belief transfer model of\nassertion (cf. 2011). The idea here is to appeal to a\nplausible view of the purpose of assertion—to “transfer\nbeliefs from assertor to members of her audience” (Egan 2007:\n15) and then to object that what is asserted, according to the\ntruth-relativist, cannot play this characteristic role; specifically,\nthis will be because, for the truth-relativist, the asserted contents\nare liable to be true relative to the speaker but false relative to\nthe audience. For instance, Sam hardly (on the\ntruth-relativist’s program) seems to\n“transfer” to Dean his belief Apples are\ntasty (which is true) by asserting this to Dean, when what Dean\ncomes to believe Apples are tasty is something (on the\nassumption that Dean doesn’t like apples) that will be\nfalse. Thus, and more generally, it’s not clear what, exactly,\ncould be said to be transferred and a fortiori\nasserted. See Egan (2007) and Dinges (2017) for attempts to reconcile truth-relativism\n(about epistemic modals) with Stalnaker’s belief-transfer model\nof assertion. Cappelen and Hawthorne (2009) assess the merits of New Relativism\nas it stands to challenge what they take to be the received view of\nthe objects of thought and talk, “Simplicity”, the core\ntenets of which are: Cappelen and Hawthorne understand New Relativism (what they call\nanalytic relativism) as a direct challenge to (T1) and that,\nif this challenge were successful, it would consequently bring down\nthe more general picture they call “simplicity” (cf.,\nFerrari & Wright 2017). Accordingly, Cappelen and\nHawthorne’s central objective is to show that\ntruth-relativist’s arguments aimed at undermining (T1) are\nultimately unsuccessful; more specifically, their broad strategy is to\ninsist that the arguments adduced in favor of\ntruth-relativism—when thoroughly understood—constitute a\npresumptive case for contextualism (in the domains where\nrelativism was defended, and in particular, in the domain of\npredicates of personal taste). Relativism comes in a plethora of forms that are themselves\ngrounded in disparate philosophical motivations. There is no such\nthing as Relativism simpliciter, and no single argument that would\nestablish or refute every relativistic position that has been\nproposed. Despite this diversity, however, there are commonalities and\nfamily resemblances that justify the use of the label\n“relativism” for the various views we have discussed.\nRelativism remains a hotly disputed topic still surviving various\nattempts to eliminate it from philosophical discourse. What is most\nsurprising, however, is the recent popularity of some versions of the\ndoctrine in at least some circles of analytic philosophy.","contact.mail":"maria.baghramian@ucd.ie","contact.domain":"ucd.ie"},{"date.published":"2015-09-11","date.changed":"2020-09-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/","author1":"Maria Baghramian","author1.info":"http://www.jadamcarter.com/","entry":"relativism","body.text":"\n\nRelativism, roughly put, is the view that truth and falsity, right\nand wrong, standards of reasoning, and procedures of justification are\nproducts of differing conventions and frameworks of assessment and\nthat their authority is confined to the context giving rise to them.\nMore precisely, “relativism” covers views which maintain\nthat—at a high level of abstraction—at least some class of\nthings have the properties they have (e.g., beautiful, morally good,\nepistemically justified) not simpliciter, but only relative\nto a given framework of assessment (e.g., local cultural norms,\nindividual standards), and correspondingly, that the truth of claims\nattributing these properties holds only once the relevant framework of\nassessment is specified or supplied. Relativists characteristically\ninsist, furthermore, that if something is only relatively so,\nthen there can be no framework-independent vantage point from which\nthe matter of whether the thing in question is so can be\nestablished.\n\nRelativism has been, in its various guises, both one of the most\npopular and most reviled philosophical doctrines of our\ntime. Defenders see it as a harbinger of tolerance and the only\nethical and epistemic stance worthy of the open-minded and\ntolerant. Detractors dismiss it for its alleged incoherence and\nuncritical intellectual permissiveness.  Debates about relativism\npermeate the whole spectrum of philosophical sub-disciplines. From\nethics to epistemology, science to religion, political theory to\nontology, theories of meaning and even logic, philosophy has felt the\nneed to respond to this heady and seemingly subversive\nidea. Discussions of relativism often also invoke considerations\nrelevant to the very nature and methodology of philosophy and to the\ndivision between the so-called “analytic and continental”\ncamps in philosophy. And yet, despite a long history of debate going\nback to Plato and an increasingly large body of writing, it is still\ndifficult to come to an agreed definition of what, at its core,\nrelativism is, and what philosophical import it has. This entry\nattempts to provide a broad account of the many ways in which\n“relativism” has been defined, explained, defended and\ncriticized.\n\nThe label “relativism” has been attached to a wide\nrange of ideas and positions which may explain the lack of consensus\non how the term should be defined. The profusion of the use of the\nterm “relativism” in contemporary philosophy means that\nthere is no ready consensus on any one definition. Here are three\nprominent, but not necessarily incompatible, approaches: A standard way of defining and distinguishing between different\ntypes of relativism is to begin with the claim that a\nphenomenon x (e.g., values, epistemic, aesthetic and ethical\nnorms, experiences, judgments, and even the world) is somehow\ndependent on and co-varies with some underlying, independent\nvariable y (e.g., paradigms, cultures, conceptual schemes,\nbelief systems, language). The type of dependency relativists propose\nhas a bearing on the question of definitions. Let us take some\nexamples. Each of (a)–(c) exhibits a relation of dependence where a\nchange in the independent variable y will result in variations\nin the dependent variable x. However, of the three examples\ncited above, normally only (a) and (b) are deemed relevant to\nphilosophical discussions of relativism, for one main attraction of\nrelativism is that it offers a way of settling (or explaining away)\nwhat appear to be profound disagreements on questions of value,\nknowledge and ontology and the relativizing parameter often involves\npeople, their beliefs, cultures or languages. The co-variance definition proceeds by asking the dual\nquestions: (i) what is relativized? and (ii) what is it relativized\nto? The first question enables us to distinguish forms of relativism\nin terms of their objects, for example, relativism about\ntruth, goodness, beauty, and their subject matters, e.g., science,\nlaw, religion. The answer to the second question individuates forms of\nrelativism in terms of their domains or frames of\nreference—e.g., conceptual frameworks, cultures, historical\nperiods, etc. Such classifications have been proposed by Haack (1996),\nO’Grady (2002), Baghramian (2004), Swoyer (2010), and Baghramian\n& Coliva (2019). The following table classifies different\nrelativistic positions according to what is being relativized, or its\nobjects, and what is being relativized to, or its domains. Table 1:\nDomains of Relativization (y) Table 1 reflects the availability of fine-grained distinctions\nbetween different forms of relativism as functions of both objects\n(x) and domains (y) of relativization. In practice,\nhowever, much contemporary discussions of relativism focus on\nsubjectivism, historicism, cultural relativism and conceptual\nrelativism, along the axis of y, and cognitive/epistemic\nrelativism, ethical or moral relativism and aesthetic relativism,\nalong the axis of x. As we shall see\nin §5, New Relativism, where\nthe objects of relativization (in the left column) are\nutterance tokens expressing claims about cognitive norms,\nmoral values, etc.  and the domain of relativization is the standards\nof an assessor, has also been the focus of much recent\ndiscussion.  A second approach to defining relativism casts its net more widely\nby focusing primarily on what relativists deny. Defined\nnegatively, relativism amounts to the rejection of a number of\ninterconnected philosophical positions. Traditionally, relativism is\ncontrasted with: Absolutism, the view that at least some\ntruths or values in the relevant domain apply to all times, places or\nsocial and cultural frameworks. They are universal and not bound by\nhistorical or social conditions. Absolutism is often used as the key\ncontrast idea to relativism. Objectivism or the position that cognitive,\nethical and aesthetic norms and values in general, but truth in\nparticular, are independent of judgments and beliefs at particular\ntimes and places, or in other words they are (non-trivially)\nmind-independent. The anti-objectivist on the other hand, denies that\nthere is such thing as simply being ‘true’,\n‘good’, ‘tasty’ or ‘beautiful’ but\nargues that we can coherently discuss such values only in relation to\nparameters that have something to do with our mental lives.  Monism or the view that, in any given area\nor topic subject to disagreement, there can be no more than one\ncorrect opinion, judgment, or norm. The relativist often wishes to\nallow for a plurality of equally valid values or even truths.  Realism, when defined in such a way that\nit entails both the objectivity and singularity of truth, also stands\nin opposition to relativism. Relativism in this negative sense is a prominent feature of the\nwork of the relativists malgré eux such as Richard\nRorty (1979) and Jacques Derrida (1974). What justifies the\nappellation ‘relativist’, rather than\n‘skeptic’, is not only these philosophers’ suspicion\nof the possibility of objectivity but their insistence on the role of\nsocio-historical, psychological and textual contexts in accounts of\n‘truth’ and ‘knowledge’ claims. What also binds various forms of relativism is an underlying idea\nthat claims to truth, knowledge or justification have an implicit,\nmaybe even unnoticed, relationship to a parameter or domain. Gilbert\nHarman (1975), Robert Nozick (2001), and Crispin Wright (2008b) are\namong the philosophers to propose versions of this thesis. Paul\nBoghossian summarizes the position this way:  the relativist about a given domain, D,\npurports to have discovered that the truths of D\ninvolve an unexpected relation to a parameter. (Boghossian\n2006b: 13) \n\nTo take an example, moral relativism, according to this approach, is\nthe claim that the truth or justification of beliefs with moral\ncontent is relative to specific moral codes. So the sentence “It\nis wrong to sell people as slaves” is elliptical for “It\nis wrong to sell people as slaves relative to the moral code\nof …”.  Or alternatively, as Kusch (2010) formulates the\nidea on behalf of the relativist: “It\nis wrong-relative-to-the-moral-code-of-…” to\nsell people as slaves. The resulting sentence(s) turns out to be true,\naccording to the relativist, depending on how we fill in the\n“…”. So, “It is wrong to sell people as\nslaves” comes out true relative to the moral code of the United\nNations Charter of Human Rights and false relative to the moral code\nof ancient Greece. The justifying thought is that judgments about the\nmorality of slavery, or any other ethical issue, are based on\ndiffering conventions, and there is no universal or objective\ncriterion for choosing among differing competing socio-historically\nconstituted conventions. Moreover, as a corollary of this approach,\nthere is no truth of the matter of whether it is wrong to sell people\nas slaves, independently of the specification of some\nstandard. Thus on the hidden parameter account, a consequence is that\nthe relevant claims will be true, if at all, only relative to some\nparameter. This particular approach to relativism is often expressed in\nexplicitly linguistic terms and is favored by philosophers interested\nin the semantic dimensions of relativism. The claim is that predicates\nsuch as “is true”, “is rational”, “is\nright”, “is good” etc. in a natural language have\nthe apparent logical form of one-place predicates, but their surface\ngrammatical form is misleading, because upon further investigation\nthey prove to be elliptical for two-place predicates such as “is\ntrue relative to…”, “is right according to”,\netc., (of course, where such predicates are available).  Relativism,\naccording to this approach, is the claim that a statement of the form\n“A is P” within a given domain (e.g.,\nscience, ethics, metaphysics, etc.) is elliptical for the statement\n“A is P in relation to C”,\nwhere A stands for an assertion, belief, judgment or\naction, P stands for a predicate such as “true”,\n“beautiful”, “right”, “rational”,\n“logical”, “known” etc., and C stands\nfor a specific culture, epistemic framework, language, belief-system,\netc. The three approaches outlined here are compatible and sometimes\ncomplementary. A relativistic thesis as captured by the approach\noutlined in §1.1 for instance, will also\nbe relativistic in at least one of the negative senses outlined\nin §1.2. Moreover, as we shall see, since\nvarious subdivisions of relativism appearing\nin table 1 could, with appropriate modification,\nbe expressed as claims about the truth of sentences falling\nin a particular domain, then the hidden predicate approach is\napplicable to them as well.  (See §5 for a\nmore detailed way to give expression to the hidden parameter insight\nwithin recent work in the philosophy of language.) A further consideration relevant to defining relativism is its\nscope. The basic idea of global relativism is captured by the oft-repeated\nslogan “all is relative”. The claim is that all beliefs,\nregardless of their subject matter, are true only relative to a\nframework or parameter.  Local relativists, by contrast, limit their\nclaim of relativization to self-contained areas of discourse, e.g.,\nethics, aesthetics and taste but argue that, for instance, scientific\ntruths are not suitable candidates for a relativistic understanding\n(but also see §4.4.3).  It is worth\nnoting that local relativisms, typically, are endorsed on the basis of\nphilosophical considerations connected to the kinds\nof features that are claimed to be relative (e.g., aesthetic\nstandards, epistemic principles), or relatedly, semantic\nconsiderations to do with discourse where such features are\nattributed. Global relativism, by contrast, seems to be motivated not\nso much by considerations about particular features, but by more\ngeneral considerations about truth itself.  As we will see, global relativism is open to the charge of\ninconsistency and self-refutation, for if all is relative, then so is\nrelativism. Local relativism is immune from this type of criticism, as\nit need not include its own statement in the scope of what is to be\nrelativized. Unsurprisingly, local rather than global relativism is\nmuch more common within contemporary debates. There is also a question\nmark on whether we could apply relativism to all truths in a\ncompletely unrestricted way; for instance, Kölbel (2011) has\nargued that claims such as “an object is beautiful and not\nbeautiful” and “an object is identical to itself”\nhave to be excluded. A further distinction is made between weak and strong\nforms of relativism.  Strong relativism is the claim that one and\nthe same belief or judgment may be true in one context (e.g., culture\nor framework or assessment) and false in another.  Weak\nrelativism is the claim that there may be beliefs or judgments\nthat are true in one framework but not true in a second simply because\nthey are not available or expressible in the second. Bernard\nWilliams’ “relativism of distance” (Williams 1985)\nand Ian Hacking’s (1982) defense of variability in styles of\nreasoning are instances of weak relativism. Williams argues that\ncertain concepts are only available to people who live a particular\nform of life. These are concepts that are not a part of what Williams\ncalls the “absolute conception of the world” and do not\nexpress truths that any rational creature, regardless of her culture,\nwould in principle acknowledge. Truths that require these concepts for\ntheir formulation are expressible only in languages whose speakers\ntake part in that particular form of life. Such truths need not be\ntrue in a relativized sense—true relative to some parameters,\nfalse relative to others; rather, such truths are perspectival: real\nbut visible only from a certain angle, i.e., for people who adopt a\ncertain way of life. This weaker form of relativism, in so far as it\ndenies the universality of certain truth claims, is captured more\nreadily by the negative definition (§1.2)\nof relativism. Interest in relativism as a philosophical doctrine goes back to\nancient Greece. In more recent decades, however, relativism has also\nproven popular not only as a philosophical position but also as an\nidea underwriting a normative—ethical and political-outlook.\n(see Bloom 1987, in particular the Introduction, and Kusch (ed.)\n2019). A number of philosophical considerations as well as\nsocio-historical developments explain the enduring interest in and the\nmore recent popularity of relativism.  Data regarding diversity of belief systems, conceptual frameworks\nand ways of life have frequently been used by philosophers and\nanthropologists alike to give credibility to philosophical arguments\nfor relativism (For example see Hollis & Lukes 1982 and Wilson\n1970). The mere fact of empirical diversity does not lead to\nrelativism, but, relativism as a philosophical doctrine, has often\nbeen taken as a natural position to adopt in light of\nempirical diversity, in part, because relativism helps to make sense\nof such diversity without the burden of explaining who is in\nerror. Descriptive relativism, an empirical and methodological position\nadopted by social anthropologists, relies on ethnographic data to\nhighlight the paucity of universally agreed upon norms, values and\nexplanatory frameworks. From polygamy to cannibalism, from witchcraft\nto science we find major differences between the worldviews and\noutlooks of individuals and groups. Descriptive relativism is often\nused as the starting point for philosophical debates on relativism in\ngeneral and cultural relativism in particular. The observed radical\ndifferences among cultures, it is argued, show the need for a\nrelativistic assessment of value systems and conceptual commitments.\nSome anti-relativist universalists, on the other hand, argue that\nunderlying the apparent individual and cultural differences, there are\nsome core commonalities to all belief systems and socio-cultural\noutlooks (e.g., Nussbaum 1997). But the relativistically inclined\nrespond by first pointing to the seeming incommensurability of various\nethical and conceptual frameworks and the variability of cognitive\nnorms and practices in difference cultures, and then, on this basis,\nmaintain that the so-called “commonalities” belie\nsignificant differences. The anti-relativist may concede the point and\ninsist that where such disagreements exist, at most one view is\ncorrect and the rest mistaken. But in so far as we are reluctant to\nimpute widespread and systematic error to other cultures, or to our\nown, relativism remains an attractive option. Descriptive relativism\nis also central to the brand of relativism advocated by the\nsociologists of scientific knowledge and other social constructionists\nwho argue that, even in the so-called “hard sciences”, we\ncannot escape the specter of irresolvable differences and even\nincommensurability (see §4.4.3). There is not only a marked diversity of views on questions\nof right and wrong, truth and falsehood, etc., but more significantly,\nmany disputes arising from such differences seem intractable.\nThere are instances of long-standing disagreement, such that the\ndisputants are very plausibly talking about the same subject matter\n(thus avoiding incommensurability) and genuinely disagreeing with each\nother; and yet, no amount of information and debate enables them or us\nto resolve the disagreement. And moreover, in such cases, it can seem\nthat neither side seems to have made any obvious mistake (see, e.g.,\nHales 2014 and Beddor 2019). If well-informed, honest and intelligent people are unable to\nresolve conflicts of opinion, we should, some relativists argue,\naccept that all parties to such disputes could be right and their\nconflicting positions have equal claims to truth, each according to\ntheir own perspective or point of view. Their disagreement is\nfaultless (Kölbel 2004; Brogaard 2007; Hales 2014). Many\nrelativistically inclined philosophers, (e.g., Max Kölbel\n(2004), Wright (2006) and John MacFarlane with terminological\nqualification (2014: 133–136)) see the presence of faultless\ndisagreements as central to motivating and justifying relativism. The\nanti-relativists counter that the very notion of a\n“faultless” disagreement is incompatible with our common\nunderstanding of what it means to disagree. It is a hallmark of\ndisagreement, as commonly understood, that the parties involved find\nfault with the other sides’ views. When people disagree at\nleast one of them is making a mistake or is failing to\nbelieve what he or she ought to believe given his or her cognitive\naims.  Relativism accordingly offers a revisionary account of what it\nmeans to disagree (e.g., MacFarlane 2007, 2014; see\n§5 where the point has been discussed in\nsome detail); but it is not clear if the account can explain what is\nleft of a disagreement to preserve once we allow that both parties to\na disagreement could be right (Carter 2013; Dreier\n2009). A sophisticated semantic version of relativism about truth, known\nas truth-relativism, and alternatively as “new\nrelativism”, has been proposed in recent years and which\nattempts to deal with some of these issues (e.g., MacFarlane 2014 and\nFerrari 2019 for an overview). We will return to this variety of\nrelativism in\n§5. A different perspective on the move from disagreement to relativism\nis offered in recent work by Carol Rovane (2012 and 2013), who rejects\nthe prevailing consensus on what she calls the “disagreement\nintuition of relativism” in favor of an “alternatives\nintuition”. According to Rovane, relativism is motivated by the\nexistence of truths that cannot be embraced together, not because they\ncontradict and hence disagree with each other but because they are not\nuniversal truths. The example Rovane gives is conflict between a\nbelief that deference to parents is morally obligatory in Indian\ntraditionalist sense and the belief that it is not morally obligatory\nin the American individualist sense. Each belief is true within its\nparticular ethical framework but the two beliefs cannot be conjoined\nor embraced together. Or more generally, it is not possible both to\nexercise full autonomy and simultaneously be dedicated to one’s\ncommunity and its norms. The underlying thought, for Rovane, is that\nnot all truth-value-bearers are in logical relations to one another,\nthat there are many noncomprehensive bodies of truths that cannot be\nconjoined. What the two approaches have in common is the claim that truth and\njustification are plural, that there could be more than\none correct account of how things stand in at least some\ndomains and their correctness has to be decided relative to a\nframework of context of assessment.  Additionally, the relativistically inclined find further support\nfor their position in the contention that there is no\nmeta-justification of our evaluative or normative systems, that all\njustifications have to start and end somewhere (see Sankey 2010 and\n2011) and that there are no higher-order or meta-level standards\navailable for adjudicating clashes between systems in a non-question\nbegging way. Steven Hales, for instance, argues that faced with\ndisagreement and given non-neutrality, relativism is the most\nviable non-skeptical conclusion to draw (Hales 2006: 98;\n2014). Similar considerations apply to attempts to anchor beliefs on\nsecure foundations. Various intellectual developments, leading to loss\nof old certainties in the scientific and social arena have\nstrengthened the appeal of this point.  The scientific revolution of\nthe early 20th century, brought about by, for instance, the\nadvent of Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics and the loss of\nfaith in lasting religious or political truths (Marxism in\nparticular), as well as the failure of foundationalist philosophical\nprograms have been used in arguments to vindicate relativistic views\n(for relativism about science\nsee §4.4.3). The relativists often argue\nthat justifications are not only perspectival but also\ninterest-relative and there is no neutral or objective starting ground\nfor any of our beliefs (see Seidel 2014; Carter 2015: ch. 4 and Siegel\nin Hales 2011: 205 for criticisms of this type of justification of\nrelativism). Pierre Duhem’s (1861–1916) thesis of\nunderdetermination of theory by data, the claim that empirical\nevidence alone is not adequate for providing justification for any\ngiven scientific theory, has played an important role in building up a\ncase both for conceptual relativism (§4.2)\nand for constructionism and relativism about science\n(§4.4.2\nand §4.4.3). According to the\nunderdetermination thesis, incompatible theories can be consistent\nwith available evidence. Relativism threatens whenever conflicting\ntheories or views appear to have equal claim to truth or\njustification. The relativistically inclined use underdetermination to\nclaim that evidence could be brought to justify opposing explanations\nand justification.  The underdetermination thesis is also used to\nhighlight the absence of neutral starting points for our\nbeliefs. Choices between incompatible but equally well-supported rival\ntheories, it is argued, are often made based on interests and local\npreferences rather than neutral universal grounds. Relativists argue that beliefs and values get their justification\nor truth only relative to specific epistemic systems or practices (see\nKusch forthcoming). Strong support for this view has come\nfrom social scientists and cultural theorist who focus on the\nsocio-cultural determinants of human beliefs and actions. The social\nsciences, from their very inception, were hospitable to relativism.\nIndeed, August Comte, the father of sociology, claimed that a strength\nof “positive sociology” was its “tendency to render\nrelative the ideas which were at first absolute” (Comte 1976\n[1830–42]: 89). Comte also was responsible for the battle cry\n“all is relative”, but immediately and no doubt\nself-consciously contradicted himself by adding “and\nthat’s the only absolute”. Other social scientists, under\nthe influence of Karl Marx (1818–1883), Max Weber\n(1864–1920), and Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911), have given\ncredence to the idea that human beliefs and actions could be\nunderstood and evaluated only relative to their social and economic\nbackground and context (cf., Kinzel 2019). Beliefs, desires and actions, the argument\ngoes, are never independent of a background of cultural\npresuppositions, interests and values. We cannot step out of our\nlanguage, culture and socio-historical conditions to survey reality\nfrom an Archimedean vantage point. Even perceptions are\n“theory-laden” and could vary between linguistic and\ncultural groupings. The sociological view that beliefs are\ncontext-dependent, in the sense that their context helps explain why\npeople have the beliefs they do, has also been used to support what is\nsometimes called “social” or “sociological\nrelativism” or the view that truth or correctness is relative to\nsocial contexts because we can both understand and judge beliefs and\nvalues only relative to the context out of which they\narise. Context-dependence is also used to explain empirical\nobservations of diversity in beliefs and values; different social\ncontexts, the argument goes, give rise to differing, possibly\nincompatible norms and values. Advocates of relativism, particularly outside philosophical\ncircles, often cite tolerance as a key normative reason for becoming a\nrelativist. On this rationale, all ways of life and cultures are\nworthy of respect in their own terms, and it is a sign of unacceptable\nethnocentrism to presume that we could single out one outlook or point\nof view as objectively superior to others. The Principle of Tolerance\nacquires an overtly socio-political form in the hand of Paul\nFeyerabend who maintains that “A free society is a society in\nwhich all traditions are given equal rights” (Feyerabend 1978:\n30).  Anti-relativists find this normative advocacy of relativism\nunconvincing for two key kinds of reasons. Some anti-relativists\n(e.g., Rachels 2009) often appeal to cases at the limits (e.g.,\ntoleration of heinous crimes) to show the thesis to be implausibly\noverpermissive (see §4.5). Others argue\nthat if all values are relative then tolerance and maximizing freedom\nare valuable only to those who have already embraced them. Relativists\ncounter that they are not defending a global version of relativism\nregarding all truths and justification but local versions concerning\nthe ethics and politics of belief and the usefulness of relativism in\nour attempt to become better, or at least more flexible and less\ndogmatic, thinkers and more tolerant citizens (e.g., Feyerabend 1978:\n82–84).  \nThe anti-relativists counter-argue that even if we grant that\npolitical tolerance is an important value, and that accepting\nrelativism would promote it, we should never adopt philosophical views\nabout the nature of truth or justification simply because of their\nassumed good moral or political consequences. Second, and more\nimportantly: political toleration does not require the strong\ndoctrine of philosophical relativism. Increased awareness of diversity\ntogether with an awareness of the historical contingency of\none’s own convictions will promote political toleration just as\neffectively.  As Knobe and Nichols point out, simply being made aware\nof radically different view points can lead to a:  …crisis akin to that of the [Christian] child\nconfronted with religious diversity… For the discovery of\nreligious diversity can prompt the thought that it’s in some\nsense accidental that one happens to be raised in a Christian\nhousehold rather than a Hindu household. This kind of arbitrariness\ncan make the child wonder whether there’s any reason to think\nthat his religious beliefs are more likely to be right than those of\nthe Hindu child (Knobe & Nichols 2007: 11)  \nA separate strand of argument connecting tolerance and relativism has\nappealed to the claimed virtues of relativism as a kind\nof philosophical stance (e.g., Bloor 2011; Baghramian 2019),\none that is characterised by anti-absolutist intellectual virtues such\nas curiosity and anti-dogmatism. The idea that a relativistic stance\ninvolves the manifesting of intellectually beneficial attitudes has\nbeen championed by, along with Bloor, Feyerabend (1975) and Code\n(1995), the latter of whom have emphasised the value of emancipatory\nthinking, e.g., thinking that is not artificially constrained by\nattempts to “enforce a universalist truth”. \n\nHowever, critics of relativism as a stance have countered such\narguments from ‘relativist virtues’ with arguments from\nvice. Baghramian (2019), for instance, has suggested that even if we\ngrant that a relativist stance aligns with a cluster of intellectually\nvirtuous dispositions in thinking, the stance also has the consequence\nof encouraging several corresponding vices, including intellectual\ninsouciance (e.g., Cassam 2019), and lack of conviction (Baghramian\n2019: 265; cf., Kusch 2019 for replies). The English term “relativism” came into usage only in\nthe 19th Century. John Grote was probably the first to\nemploy it when in Exploratio Philosophica (1865) he wrote:  The notion of the mask over the face of nature\nis…. what I have called “relativism”. If “the\nface of nature” is reality, then the mask over it, which is what\ntheory gives us, is so much deception, and that is what relativism\nreally comes to. (Grote 1865: I.xi, 229).   \nIts German counterpart, “Relativismus”, has a\nlonger history. Wilhelm Traugott Krug, who succeeded Kant in the\nUniversity of Königsberg in his philosophical lexicon, defines it as  the assumption that everything which we\nexperience and think (the self, the idea of reason, truth, morality,\nreligion etc.) is only something relative, and therefore has no\nessential endurance and no universal validity. (Krug 2010 [1838]:\n224) Although the term “relativism” is of recent coinage,\ndoctrines and positions, with some of the hallmarks of contemporary\nrelativism, date back to the very beginnings of Western\nphilosophy. Protagoras of Abdera (c. 490–420 BC) is often\nconsidered the first overt champion of relativism, and his dictum Man (anthrôpos) is the measure\n(metron) of all things (chrêmatôn), of\nthe things which are, that they are, and of the things which are not,\nthat they are not (tôn men ontôn hôs esti,\ntôn de mê ontôn hôs ouk estin) (from\nPlato’s Theaetetus 152a 2–4) its first battle-cry. According to Plato,\nProtagoras thought: Each thing appears (phainesthai) to me,\nso it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it is for you—you\nand I each being a man. (Theaetetus 152a 6–8) For instance, the same wind could be cold to one\nperson and hot to another. The extent to which Protagoras’s\nview, or at least what comes down to us from Plato, amounts to\ngenuine relativism remains somewhat controversial. As Burnyeat\n(1976b: 172) notes, Sextus Empiricus thought—though Burnyeat\nthinks mistakenly—that the Protagorean measure doctrine was to\nbe understood as the subjectivist thesis that\nevery appearance is true (simpliciter). This kind\nof radical subjectivism, though, quickly can be shown to turn on\nitself: it can appear that the thesis that “every\nappearance is true” is false. And so this radical subjectivist\ninterpretation, regardless of whether it is accurate, is as Sextus\nhad thought, untenable. However, Plato also ascribes a social or\nethical dimension to Protagorean relativism which seem to go beyond\nindividualistic subjectivism. In Theaetetus 172a 2–6\nhe says what may or may not fittingly be done, of just and\nunjust, of what is sanctioned by religion and what is not; and here\nthe theory may be prepared to maintain that whatever view a\ncity takes on these matters and establishes as its law or\nconvention, is truth and fact for that city. In such matters,\nneither any individual nor any city can claim superior\nwisdom. [emphasis added] Plato’s attempted refutation of Protagoras,\nknown as peritrope or “turning around”, is the\nfirst of the many attempts to show that relativism is self-refuting. Protagorean relativism directly influenced the Pyrrhonian Skeptics,\nwho saw the “man is the measure” doctrine as a precursor\nto their brand of skepticism. Sextus Empiricus, for instance, in his\n“Relativity Mode” states that judgments and observations\nare relative to the person who makes them, to their context as well as\nthe object being observed and goes on to say, since we have established in this way that\neverything is relative (pros ti), it is clear then that we\nshall not be able to say what an existing object is like in its own\nnature and purely, but only what it appears to be like relative to\nsomething. (Sextus Empiricus PH I 140) But the conclusion he draws favors skepticism\nrather than relativism as understood in modern philosophy, for he\nconcludes, “It follows that we must suspend judgment about the\nnature of objects” (ibid.). Glimpses of relativistic thinking were in evidence in Boethius\n(480–524) (see Marenbon 2003) as well as in the double truth\ndoctrine, or the view that religion and philosophy are separate and at\ntimes conflicting sources of truth, originally found in Averroes\n(1126–1198) and the 13th century Latin Averroists.\nHowever, the dominant belief in a singular and absolute revealed truth\nwithin a Christian framework, on the whole, made the medieval period\ninhospitable to relativism. There was a renewed interest in both\nrelativism and skepticism at the inception of modern philosophy\ninspired, in part, by Latin translations of Sextus Empiricus in the\n16th century. Michel de Montaigne’s work\n(1533–1592), in common with others sympathetic towards\nrelativism, ancient or contemporary, relies on accounts of faraway\ncultures to argue that “we have no other criterion of truth or\nright-reason than the example and form of the opinion and customs of\nour own country” (Montaigne 1580 [1991: 152]) (but also see\nFricker 2013 for a dissenting view). His advocacy of toleration, even\nfor the cannibal, paved the way for not only the acceptance but the\nvalorization of idealized versions of alien creeds and distant\ncultures by Enlightenment figures such as Rousseau (1712–1778),\nVoltaire (1694–1778), Diderot (1713–1784), Montesquieu\n(1689–1755) and Condorcet (1743–1794), who in turn, were\ninstrumental in establishing an intellectual climate hospitable to\ncultural relativism. These authors were also the first to explore the\nidea of viewing one’s culture from an outsider’s point of\nview and using this external perspective as a vehicle to criticize\nlocal customs and norms. To take just one example, Diderot, in his\n“Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville”, tells us that\nthe Tahitian is mild, innocent, and happy while civilized people are\ncorrupt, vile, and wretched; the natives live according to customs and\nrules that vary greatly from the Western ones. They do not possess\nprivate property or operate their affairs based on egalitarian\nprinciples, and they exercise sexual freedom not accepted in\n“civilized societies”. Diderot accordingly opposes the\nEuropean mission of civilizing the natives, and despite his belief in\na common human nature, he advocates the relativistic sounding maxim to be monks in France and savages in Tahiti. Put on\nthe costume of the country you visit, but keep the suit of clothes you\nwill need to go home in. (Diderot 1956 [1772]: 228 in Baghramian 2010:\n37) Discussions of relativism in the 19th century had two\nsources (see Gardiner 1981). On the one hand, figures from the\nso-called Counter-Enlightenment, a philosophical movement which arose\nin the late 18th century and the early 19th\ncentury in opposition to the Enlightenment, Johann Georg Hamann\n(1730–1788), Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), Wilhelm\nvon Humboldt (1767–1835) emphasized the diversity of languages\nand customs and their role in shaping human thought. Hamann’s\nviews on language, for instance, foreshadow contemporary conceptual\nand epistemic relativism. He maintained that language is the\n“instrument and criterion of reason” as well as the source\nof all the confusions and fallacies of reason. Furthermore, the rules\nof rationality are embedded within language, which in turn, is\ngoverned by local norms of custom and use (Hamann 1967\n[1759]). Relativism ensues because languages and their rules of\nrationality vary a great deal. Herder, on the other hand, not only\nrailed against the rational, universalizing and science-oriented ethos\nof the Enlightenment but, much like later relativists, also argued\nthat different nations and epochs have their distinct preferences in\nethical and aesthetics matters as well as their varied conceptions of\ntruth and we are not in a position to adjudicate between them (Herder\n1774 [2002: 272–358]). The Counter Enlightenment had a significant influence on Hegel,\nNietzsche, and Dilthey, who in turn have shaped relativistic thinking\nin certain strands of continental philosophy, postmodernism and\ncultural studies. Hamann’s rejection of objectivism was central\nto Nietzsche’s even more profound recoil from objectivity.  And\nindeed, Nietzsche is possibly the single most influential voice in\nshaping relativistic sensibilities in 20th century\ncontinental philosophy. His declaration that all human conceptions and\ndescriptions, including those advanced by scientists, are only an interpretation and arrangement of the\nworld (according to our own requirements, if I may say so!)—and\nnot an explanation of the world. (Nietzsche 1886a [1996]: §14) and that “there is only a perspective\nseeing, only a perspective knowing” (Nietzsche 1886b [1968]:\n§540), irrespective of how Nietzsche himself intended them, have\nbeen taken to express a core contention of relativism that no single\naccount of truth or reality can occupy a privileged position, for\nsuch accounts are only one of many perspectives that prevail at a\ngiven time in history. We cannot appeal to any facts or standards of\nevaluation independently of their relation to the perspectives\navailable to us; we can do little more than to insist on the\nlegitimacy of our own perspective and try to impose it on other\npeople through our “will to power”.  A second source was the German post-Kantian and British Idealist\ndiscussions of the “relativity of knowledge” taking place\nin the context of the distinction between being-for-other\n(für anderes sein) and being-for-itself\n(fürsichsein)—a distinction influenced by the\nKantian idea that all knowledge is ultimately relational because\nknowledge of the Real or “the thing in itself” is\nimpossible. John Stuart Mill, for instance ascribes to the Kantian\nWilliam Hamilton the “doctrine of relativity of our human\nknowledge” because Hamilton, according to Mill, believed that\nthere could be no unconditional or absolute knowledge for all\nknowledge is dependent on the knowing mind (Mill 1884: 8). The end of the 19th century witnessed the emergence of yet\nanother strand of relativism motivated by empirical-psychological and\nphysiological interpretations of Kantian categories. The view, known\nas species relativism, and defended by neo-Kantian\npsychologists such as Theodore Lipps (1851–1914), holds that the\nrules of logic are products of the human mind and psychology and\ntherefore may be unique to the human species; different species could\nhave and use different logical principles. The view was vehemently,\nbut quite effectively, attacked by Frege and Husserl as part of\ntheir arguments against what they called “psychologism”\nand “speciesism” (Kusch 1995: 47). Logic in this approach is\nidentified with the actual thinking processes of individuals or\ncommunities and its authority is seen to be local, or relative to the\npractices of particular epistemic groupings. But Frege and Husserl\nargued that with such relativization we would lose the ability to\ndistinguish between reasoning correctly and merely seeming to do\nso. Finally, the popularity of the very idea of relativism in the\n20th century owes something to Einstein’s Special\nTheory of Relativity (1905) which was to be used both as model and as\nwell as a vindication for various relativistic claims. Gilbert Harman\nis among the philosophers to use Einsteinian relativity as a model for\nphilosophical versions of relativism. He says:  According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity\neven an object’s mass is relative to a choice of spatio-temporal\nframework. An object can have one mass in relation to one such\nframework and a different mass in relation to another. …. I am\ngoing to argue for a similar claim about moral right and wrong.\n… I am going to argue that moral right and wrong …. are\nalways relative to a choice of moral framework. (Harman 1996:\n3) The Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic relativity\n(see §4.1) is also thought to have been\ninspired by the Relativity Theory. It is however worth noting that\nEinstein did not think that the Theory of Relativity supported\nrelativism in ethics or epistemology because, although in his model\nsimultaneity and sameness of place are relative to reference frames,\nthe physical laws expressing such relativity are constant and\nuniversal and hence in no sense relative. The different strands of the intellectual genealogy of relativism\nhave shaped a variety of relativistic doctrines. Relativism is discussed under a variety of headings some of which\nhave been more prominent in recent philosophical and cultural\ndebates. Public debates about relativism often revolve around the frequently\ncited but unclear notion of cultural relativism. The idea\nthat norms and values are born out of conventions can be traced back\nto the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484–425 BC), but it is only\nin the 20th century, and particularly with the advent of\nsocial anthropology, that cultural relativism has gained wide\ncurrency.  Franz Boas, responsible for the founding of social\nanthropology in the U.S., claimed that The data of ethnology prove that not only our\nknowledge but also our emotions are the result of the form of our\nsocial life and of the history of the people to whom we belong. (Boas\n1940: 636) Boas’s views became the orthodoxy of\nanthropology through M. J. Herskovits’ “principle of\ncultural relativism” stating: “Judgments are based on\nexperience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms\nof his own enculturation” (Herskovits 1955:15). Since those early days, social anthropologists have come to develop\nmore nuanced approaches to cultural relativism (see for instance\nGeertz 1993); however, its core tenet, a claim to the equal standing\nof all cultural perspectives and values which co-vary with their\ncultural and social background, has remained constant. Cultural relativists justify their position by recourse to a\ncombination of empirical, conceptual and normative considerations: Claims (a)–(d) are open to a variety of objections. Some\nanthropologists and biologists have argued against the empirical\nassumption of the variability of cultures and have disputed its\nextent.  Kinship, death and its attendant rituals of mourning, birth,\nthe experience of empathy, expressions of sympathy and fear, and the\nbiological needs that give rise to these, are some of the constant\nelements of human experience that belie the seeming diversity reported\nby ethnographers (Brown 2004). (c) has also been challenged by\nnaturalistically inclined social scientists who believe that an\nevolutionary or a biologically informed approach can provide a\ncontext-independent, universally applicable theoretical framework for\nexplaining what is common to all cultures, despite their superficial\ndifferences. Moreover, Moody-Adams (1997), among others, has argued\nthat cultures are not integrated wholes that could determine\nuni-directionally the beliefs and experiences of their members; they\nare porous, riddled with inconsistencies and amenable to change.\nFinally, (d) is under pressure from the very relativism it\nadvocates. Other critics, Pope Benedict XVI for instance, in his very\nfirst homily delivered upon election (18 April 2005), reject and\ncondemn prescriptive cultural relativism as a harbinger of nihilism\nand an “anything goes” extreme permissiveness. An influential form of descriptive cultural relativism owes its\ngenesis to linguistics. Benjamin Whorf, inspired by his teacher Edward\nSapir, who in turn was supervised by the social anthropologist Franz\nBoas, used ethnographic evidence from American Indian languages, such\nas Hopi, to argue that languages mold our views of the world and\ndifferent languages do so differently, because “we dissect\nnature along lines laid down by our native languages” (Whorf\n1956: 213). In the case of the Hopi, the claim was that their language\nimposes a conception of time very different from that of the speakers\nof the Indo-European languages. The so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,\nand the position known as “linguistic relativity”, became\npopular in both psychology and social anthropology in the mid\n20th century. However, the empirical work by the\npsychologists Berlin and Key (1969) and later by Eleanor Rosch (1974)\npointed to the universality of color terms. The linguistic theories of\nNoam Chomsky regarding the universality of grammar were also widely\ntaken to have discredited linguistic relativity. Moreover, Malotki\n(1983) had argued that, contrary to Whorf’s claim, the Hopi\nlanguage does indeed have tense, as well as units of time, such as\ndays, weeks, months and seasons, and terminology for yesterday and\ntomorrow. Things have changed recently and there has been a slight\nswing of the pendulum back in favor of linguistic relativity on the\npart of so called “neo-Whorfians”. Stephen Levinson, for\ninstance, drawing on experimental evidence, has argued that the frame\nof reference that underlies any given language shapes our spatial\nexperiences and perceptual modalities (see Gumperz & Levinson\n1996). Similar claims have been made about emotions, object\nrepresentation, and memory. But the claims of linguistic relativity in\nall these cases are much more modest than Whorf’s original\nthesis. Historical relativism, or historicism, is the diachronic version of\ncultural relativism. As Clifford Geertz points out, cultural and\nhistorical relativism are in effect the same doctrine with a core\nclaim that “we cannot apprehend another people’s or\nanother period’s imagination neatly, as though it were our\nown” (1993: 44). Historicism originated in reaction to the\nuniversalist tendencies of the Enlightenment but proved most\ninfluential in the social sciences, particularly in the hands of\n19th century theorists such as Karl Marx and Max Weber.\nOswald Spengler, the then-influential turn-of-the-century German\nhistorian and philosopher, also declared that: “There are no\neternal truths. Every philosophy is an expression of its time”\n(Spengler 1918: 58). Karl Mannheim, to whom we owe the sub-discipline of\nsociology of knowledge, pronounced that historicism is a significant\nintellectual force that epitomizes our worldview\n(Weltanschauung). The historicist principle not only organizes, like\nan invisible hand, the work of the cultural sciences\n(Geisteswissenschaften), but also permeates everyday\nthinking. (Mannheim 1952 [1924]:84) As we will see\n(§4.4.3), in more recent times\nhistoricist interpretations of science, chiefly those espoused by\nThomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, have played a major role in\npopularizing relativistic interpretations of scientific knowledge. Conceptual relativism is a narrowly delineated form of\nrelativism where ontology, or what exists, rather than ethical and\nepistemic norms, is relativized to conceptual schemes, scientific\nparadigms, or categorical frameworks. In this sense, conceptual\nrelativism is often characterized as a metaphysical doctrine rather\nthan as variant of epistemic or cultural relativism. The underlying\nrationale for this form of relativism is the anti-realist thesis that\nthe world does not present itself to us ready-made or ready-carved;\nrather we supply different, and at times incompatible, ways of\ncategorizing and conceptualizing it. Reflection on the connections\nbetween mind and the world, rather than empirical observations of\nhistoric and cultural diversity, is the primary engine driving various\nforms of conceptual relativism, but data from anthropology and\nlinguistics are also used in its support. The thought, at least since\nKant, is that the human mind is not a passive faculty merely\nrepresenting an independent reality; rather, it has an active role in\nshaping, if not constructing, the “real”. The conceptual\nrelativist adds, as Kant did not, that human beings may construct the\nreal in different ways thanks to differences in language or\nculture.  In the 20th century, a variety of positions sympathetic\nto conceptual relativism were developed. Quine’s ontological\nrelativity, Nelson Goodman’s “irrealism” with its\nclaim of the plurality of “world-versions” and Hilary\nPutnam’s conceptual relativity are prominent examples. What\nthese authors have in common is an insistence that there could be more\nthan one “right” way of describing what there is, that\nincompatible “manuals of translation” and\n“world-versions” can be equally correct or acceptable. Quine’s thesis of ontological relativity, probably the most\ninfluential of 20th century approaches to conceptual\nrelativity, is expressed both in an epistemic as well as in a stronger\nmetaphysical form. Quine supports an epistemic thesis when he claims\nthat incompatible scientific theories can account equally adequately\nfor the data available to us (his underdetermination thesis)\nand that “there are various defensible ways of conceiving the\nworld”, (Quine 1992: 102). But his thesis of the indeterminacy\nof translation makes the stronger claim that different incompatible\nmanuals of translation, or conceptual schemes, can account for one and\nthe same verbal behavior and the indeterminacy resides at the level of\nfacts rather than our knowledge, a position that leads to unavoidable\nontological relativity. Nelson Goodman’s irrealism is an even more radical claim to\nthe effect that the existence of many adequate, and indeed correct,\nbut irreconcilable descriptions and representations of the world shows\nthat there is no such thing as one unique actual world;\nrather there are many worlds, one for each correct description (e.g.,\nGoodman 1975; cf. Sider 2009). Hilary Putnam disagrees with\nGoodman’s formulation of relativity with its radical talk of\n“world-making” but relies on arguments from conceptual\nplurality to reject metaphysical realism, the view that there is one\nsingle correct account of what the world is like (cf., Arageorgis\n2017). According to Putnam, our most basic metaphysical categories,\ne.g., objecthood and existence, could be defined variously depending\non what conceptual scheme we use. What counts as an object itself, he\nargues, is determined by and hence is relative to the ontological\nframework we opt for. Thomas Kuhn’s highly influential discussion of the governing\nrole of paradigms in science\n(see §4.4.3) has also been interpreted\nas a form of conceptual relativism by friends (Kusch 2002) and critics\n(Davidson 1974) of relativism alike. The key difficulty facing conceptual relativism is that of\nformulating the position in a coherent but non-trivial manner. Trivial\nversions allow that the world can be described in different ways, but\nmake no claims to the incompatibility of these descriptions. The\ncharge of incoherence arises from the claim that there could be\ngenuinely conflicting and equally true accounts or descriptions of one\nand the same phenomenon. To use an example that is the corner-stone of\nHilary Putnam’s conceptual relativity, Putnam claims that the\nsimple question how many objects there are (say on a given table)\ncould be answered variously depending on whether we use “a\nmereological or a Carnapian, common-sense, method of individuating\nobjects”. In circumstances where a Carnapian counts three\nobjects A, B and C, a mereologist will count\nseven: A, B, C, plus the mereological sum\nobjects A+B, A+C, B+C, A+B+C.\nAs Putnam puts it:  The suggestion … is that what is (by\ncommonsense standards) the same situation can be described in many\ndifferent ways, depending on how we use the words. The situation does\nnot itself legislate how words like “object”,\n“entity”, and “exist” must be used. What is\nwrong with the notion of objects existing “independently”\nof conceptual schemes is that there are no standards for the use of\neven the logical notions apart from conceptual choices. (Putnam 1988:\n114) The puzzle is to explain how both the Carnapian and mereological\nanswers to the one and same question could be correct and yet mutually\nincompatible, for unless we abandon the most fundamental law of logic,\nthe law of non-contradiction, we cannot deem one and the same\nproposition true and not true. Relativists respond that both\nanswers are correct, each relative to the conceptual scheme it\ninvokes. So, once we accept the insight that there is no\nArchimedean vantage point for choosing among conflicting frameworks,\nwe no longer face a genuine contradiction. The response invokes, often\nimplicitly, a relativized conception of truth, which as we shall see\nbelow, faces its own difficulties. Relativism about truth, or alethic relativism, at its\nsimplest, is the claim that what is true for one individual or social\ngroup may not be true for another, and there is no context-independent\nvantage point to adjudicate the matter. What is true or false is\nalways relative to a conceptual, cultural, or linguistic\nframework. Alethic relativism is the most central of all relativistic\npositions since other subdivisions of the philosophical theses of\nrelativism—with the possible exception of some narrowly defined\nversions of conceptual relativism such as Nelson Goodman’s\nirrealism (see §4.2)—are in\nprinciple, reducible to it (Baghramian 2004: 92). For instance,\nrelativism about logic may be restated as a view according to which\nthe standing of logical truths (including truths about consequence\nrelations) is relative to cultures or cognitive schemes.  Ethical\nrelativism can be seen as the claim that the truth of ethical\njudgments, if such truths exist, is relative to context or culture. If\ntruth is to be seen as equally applicable to all areas of discourse\nand also unitary, rather than domain specific or plural, then alethic\nrelativism is not only a strong form of global relativism but it also\nentails the denial of the possibility of more local forms of\nrelativism because all localized relativistic claims are also attempts\nat relativizing truth (seemingly in a particular domain of\ndiscourse).  The central claim of alethic relativism is that “is\ntrue”, despite appearances to the contrary, is (at least, in\nsome relevant domains of discourse) not a one-place but a two-place\npredicate such that “P is true” should correctly be\nunderstood as (modulo differences in particular ways of\ndeveloping this idea) shorthand for “P is true for\nX”, where X is a culture, conceptual scheme,\nbelief framework, etc. And within the broad camp of alethic\nrelativists, the matter of how it is that which we should opt for\n“P-is-true-for-X”, rather than\n“P is true”, simpliciter, is developed in different\nways (e.g., see Meiland 1977; MacFarlane 2014: ch. 5; Egan 2007;\nFerrari & Moruzzi 2018).  One shared commitment of relativizing\nthe truth predicate is that claims such as “misfortune is caused\nby witchcraft” could be true according to the Azande cultural\nframework and false in the Western scientific framework. One major\ndifficulty facing alethic relativists is to explain what “true\nfor” actually means, and how “true for” should be\nunderstood as related to the more familiar absolutist truth\npredicate. For instance, should relative truth be understood as a\nmodification on an already familiar strategy for thinking about truth\n(e.g., the correspondence, pragmatic or epistemic model) or in some\ndifferent way, entirely? (MacFarlane 2014: ch. 2). Much of the work of\nNew Relativists such as John MacFarlane (see §5) can be see as an attempt to clarify this\nthorny issue. The strongest and most persistent charge leveled against all types\nof relativism, but (global) alethic relativism in particular, is the\naccusation of self-refutation. Here is for instance Harvey Siegel:  This incoherence charge is by far the most difficult\nproblem facing the relativist. It is worth noting that attempts to\novercome the problem by appealing to the notion of relative\ntruth appear not to succeed. Many versions of relativism rely on\nsuch a notion, but it is very difficult to make sense of it. An\nassertion that a proposition is “true for me” (or\n“true for members of my culture”) is more readily\nunderstood as a claim concerning what I (or members of my culture,\nscheme, etc.) believe than it is as a claim ascribing to that\nproposition some special sort of truth. Constructing a conception of\nrelative truth such that “p is relatively true” (or\n“p is true for S”, or “p is\ntrue for members of culture C”) amounts to something\nstronger than “S believes that p” (or\n“members of culture C believe that p”), but\nweaker than “p is true (simpliciter)”, has\nproved to be quite difficult, and is arguably beyond the conceptual\nresources available to the relativist. (Siegel 2011:\n203) The original argument goes back to Plato’s criticism of\nProtagoras in the Theaetetus where he argues: Most people believe that Protagoras’s doctrine is false. Protagoras, on the other hand, believes his doctrine to be\ntrue. By his own doctrine, Protagoras must believe that his\nopponents’ view is true. Therefore, Protagoras must believe that his own doctrine is false\n(see Theaetetus: 171a–c) Plato’s argument, as it stands, appears to be damaging only\nif we assume that Protagoras, at least implicitly, is committed to the\nuniversal or objective truth of relativism. On this view, Plato begs\nthe question on behalf of an absolutist conception of truth (Burnyeat\n1976a: 44). Protagoras, the relativists counter, could indeed accept\nthat his own doctrine is false for those who accept\nabsolutism but continue believing that his doctrine is true\nfor him. He could also try to persuade others to become the sort\nof thinker for whom relativism is true without being entangled in\nself-contradiction.  Such an effort at persuasions, however, could\ninvolve Protagoras in a performative contradiction as the relativist\ncannot assume that her arguments are good for persuading\nothers. Ordinarily, the very act of defending a philosophical position\ncommits us to the dialectical move of attempting to convince our\ninterlocutors of the superior value of what we are arguing\nfor. The relativist cannot make such a commitment and therefore his\nattempts to persuade others to accept his position may be\npragmatically self-refuting. The relativist can avoid the standard\ncharge of self-refutation by accepting that relativism cannot be\nproven true in any non-relative sense—viz., that\nrelativism itself as a philosophical position is at best true only\nrelative to a cultural or historical context and therefore could be\nfalse in other frameworks or cultures.  But such an admission will\nundermine the relativist’s attempt to convince others of her\nposition, for the very act of argumentation, as it is commonly\nunderstood, is an attempt to convince those who disagree with us of\nthe falsehood of their position. In other words, if Protagoras really\nbelieves in relativism why would he bother to argue for it? It may be argued that Protagoras could have opted for a more\nsensible form of alethic relativism where a person’s beliefs are\nnot automatically true relative to the framework she\naccepts. Rather a belief p is true according\nto X’s framework iff (roughly) X would\nbelieve that p if she were to reason cogently by her own\nstandards on the basis of full relevant information. This form of\nalethic relativism allows for argument and persuasion among people who\ninitially disagree, for despite their disagreement they may share or\ncome to share a framework.  Protagoras may, on this reinterpretation,\nbe trying to persuade his interlocutor that if she were to reason\ncogently by her own standards from their shared framework, she would\naccept relativism. However, it is not clear how the relativist could\nshare a framework with the absolutist on the nature of truth or what\nargumentative strategies he can use to convert the absolutist without\npresupposing a shared (relativist or absolutist) conceptions of\ntruth. In particular, a consistent relativist will have only a\nrelativized criteria of what counts as “true” information,\nwhich presumably will not be shared by the absolutist. A second strand of the self-refutation argument focuses on the\nnature and role of truth. J.L. Mackie, for instance, has argued that\nalethic absolutism is a requisite of a coherent notion of truth and\nthat a claim to the effect that “There are no absolute\ntruths” is absolutely self-refuting (Mackie 1964: 200). But the\nrelativists reject the quick move that presupposes the very conception\nof truth they are at pains to undermine and have offered sophisticated\napproaches of defense. A good example of such a defense is\nHales’ (1997)—who uses a “u” operator to\nrepresent “It is true in some perspectives that” and a\n“n” operator to represent “It is true in all\nperspectives that”—in order to establish that there could\nindeed be a consistent relativist logic which avoids the charge of\nself-refutation. Key to this approach, according to Hales, is that we\nabandon a conception of global relativism on which the lose thesis\n“everything is relative” is embraced—a thesis Hales\nconcedes to be inconsistent—for the thesis “everything\nthat is true is relatively true”, which he maintains is not\n(cf. Shogenji 1997 for a criticism of Hales on this\npoint). It has also been claimed that alethic relativism gives rise to what\nJ.L. Mackie calls “operational” (Mackie 1964: 202) and Max\nKölbel “conversational” self-refutation (Kölbel\n2011) by flouting one or more crucial norms of discourse and thereby\nundermines the very possibility of coherent discourse. One version of\nthe argument, advanced most notably by Gareth Evans (1985:\n346–63), begins with the premise that a publicly shared\ndistinction between correct and incorrect, and hence true and false,\nassertion is a necessary condition for coherent assertoric\ndiscourse. As Evans puts it, a theory that permits a subject to deduce merely that a\nparticular utterance is now correct but later will be incorrect\n… cannot assist the subject in deciding what to say, nor in\ninterpreting the remarks of others. What should we aim at, or take\nothers to be aiming at?. (1985: 349) And if truth is relative, then there is no single\nshared definite aim for any given assertion (see MacFarlane\n2014: ch. 12 for a discussion). The relativists however, could\nrespond that truth is relative to a group (conceptual scheme,\nframework) and they take speakers to be aiming a truth relative to\nthe scheme that they and their interlocutors are presumed to\nshare. The difficulty with this approach is that it seems to make\ncommunication across frameworks impossible. Such a response, however, will be answerable to the charge of\nincoherence raised by Donald Davidson against both alethic and\nconceptual relativism. According to Davidson, the principle of\ncharity—the assumption that other speakers by and large speak\ntruly (by our lights)—is a pre-requisite of all interpretation.\nHe takes this to imply that there could not be languages or conceptual\nschemes that we cannot in principle understand and interpret, in other\nwords, if a system of signs L is not recognizable as a language\nby us then L is not a language. Languages are either\ninter-translatable and hence not radically different from ours, or\nincommensurable and beyond our ability to recognize them as languages\n(Davidson 1974). The relativist, in effect, places other speakers and\ntheir languages beyond our recognitional reach and thereby undermines\nthe initial claim that they could be radically different or\nincommensurable. New Relativism, as we shall see, offers a novel take on the old\nquestion of alethic relativism and gives weight to Alasdair\nMacIntyre’s observation that relativism may have been refuted a\nnumber of times too often, whereas genuinely refutable doctrines only\nneed to be refuted once (MacIntyre 1982: 22). Claims to knowledge and justification have proven receptive to\nrelativistic interpretations. Epistemic relativism is the thesis that\ncognitive norms that determine what counts as knowledge, or whether a\nbelief is rational, justifiable, etc. could vary with and are\ndependent on local conceptual or cultural frameworks and lack the\nuniversality they aspire or pretend to. The three key assumptions\nunderlying epistemic relativism are: The epistemic relativist, as Paul Boghossian in developing his\ntrenchant criticisms of relativism points out, is committed to a\n“doctrine of equal validity”, the view that “there\nare many radically different, incompatible, yet, ‘equally\nvalid’ ways of knowing the world, with science being just one of\nthem” (Boghossian 2006a: 2). The relativist’s key claim is\nthat either we can chauvinistically maintain that our epistemic system\nis superior to all or accept the equal legitimacy of varying epistemic\nsystems. One crucial question facing epistemic relativism is how to identify\nand individuate alternative epistemic systems. The intuitive idea is\nthat varying and possibly incompatible cognitive principles,\nground-level beliefs and presuppositions, or what Wittgenstein calls\n“hinge” and “bedrock” propositions\n(Wittgenstein 1969: §§341–343) separate non-convergent\nepistemic schemes. A simple and quite commonly used example is the\ncontrast between scientific and religious belief systems. Boghossian,\nfor instance, uses the debate between Galileo and Cardinal Bellarmine\nas a case study of an encounter between antagonists operating within\nputatively different epistemic frameworks, who use different\nframeworks, or as Rorty (1979) put it “grids”, for\ndetermining what would count as appropriate evidence on planetary\nmovements. The relativist claims that there is no fact of the matter\nabout whether the Copernican theory or the geocentric view is\njustified by the evidence, “for there are no absolute facts\nabout what justifies what” (Boghossian 2006a: 62) while the\nanti-relativist attempts to show the unintelligibility or the\nimplausibility of such a claim. Boghossian has been criticized however for his characterization of\nepistemic relativism. One notable such criticism has been advanced by\nCrispin Wright (2008), who takes issue with Boghossian’s\nattributing to the epistemic relativist a version\nof (a) above, what Boghossian\ncalls epistemic relationism, or the thesis that any claim of\nthe form “Evidence E justifies belief B”, if\nit is to have any prospect of being true, must be construed as\nexpressing the claim According to the epistemic system C, that I,\nS accept, information E justifies belief B\n(Boghossian 2006a:73). Having characterized the relativist’s\nposition in this fashion, Boghossian suggests—after considering\nvarious ways of articulating what the relativist might say about\nthe untruth of claims of the form “Evidence E\njustifies belief B”—that the relativist is left,\nultimately, with no coherent way to account for how she should count\nas accepting or adhering to a given epistemic system. And on this\nbasis, Boghossian concludes that there is no coherent way to formulate\nthe position because the relativist in formulating his position and\nsetting up the opposition between two or more alternative\nnon-convergent epistemic systems cannot but assume the universality of\nat least some epistemic principles, including deduction, induction,\nwarrant through empirical evidence, etc. (see Boghossian 2006a). As Wright sees it, however, Boghossian’s attributing the\nrelationist clause to the epistemic relativist is to simply fail to take seriously the thesis that claims such\nas [Evidence E justifies belief B] can indeed by true or\nfalse, albeit only relatively so. (Wright 2008: 383, our\nitalics) Moreover, Wright argues, the epistemic relationist clause\nBoghossian includes in the kind of epistemic relativism he challenges\nbetrays a failure to distinguish between (i) making a judgment in the\nlight of certain standards and (ii) judging that those standards\nmandate that judgment.  (See also MacFarlane (2008b and Carter &\nMcKenna forthcoming for different critiques of Boghossian’s argument\nagainst the epistemic relativist.) Conceptions of rationality, and its key components of logic and\njustification, are some of the principles that are often used to\ndifferentiate between epistemic systems. Below we look at attempts at\nrelativizing each. Earlier defenses of epistemic relativism centered on the idea of\nalternative rationalities and were often developed as a reaction to\nthe charge of irrationality leveled at non-Western tribal people.\nRationality traditionally is seen as a cognitive virtue as well as a\nhallmark of the scientific method. The complex notion of rationality\nis intimately tied to requirements of consistency, justification,\nwarrant and evidence for beliefs. Relativists about rationality cast\ndoubt on the universal applicability of one or more of these features\nof rational thought, and deem them merely local epistemic values.\nPeter Winch’s treatment of E.E. Evans-Pritchard’s account\nof the Azande tribe’s beliefs in witchcraft and magic is now a\nclassic of the “rationality wars” of the 1960s and 70s.\nWinch had argued that since standards of rationality in different\nsocieties do not always coincide, we should use only contextually and\ninternally given criteria of rationality in our assessment of the\nsystems of belief of other cultures and societies. Under the influence\nof the later Wittgenstein, he maintained that it does not make sense\nto speak of a universal standard of rationality because what is\nrational is decided by a backdrop of norms governing a given language\nand form of life. As outside observers, we are not in a position to\nimpute irrationality or illogicality to the Azande or any other group\nwhose practices and language-games may differ from ours. Critics of\nWinch, Steven Lukes, for instance, using considerations reminiscent of\nDavidson’s principle of charity, have argued that we will not be\nin a position to understand a language or culture with standards of\nrationality radically different from ours, and that we must have at\nleast some core principles, or what Martin Hollis had called a\n“bridgehead” with elements such as consistency and the\ngoal of truth, in common with the Azande in order to understand them\n(Hollis 1968; Lukes 1970). They, thereby, conclude that an all-out or\nstrong relativism about rationality is not tenable.  The weaker claim\nis that some elements of rationality, for instance what counts as good\nevidence or a better style of reasoning, could vary with historic\nconditions and traditions of enquiry and therefore a degree of\nrelativization of such norms, without succumbing to irrationalism, is\nacceptable (see Hacking 1982 and MacIntyre 1988).  Being rational also means having warrant, in the form of good\nreasons and justification for one’s beliefs. Epistemic\nrelativists maintain that the legitimacy of a justificatory system and\nthe presumed strength of epistemic warrants are decided locally.\nRichard Rorty has made the influential claim that there is nothing to be said about either truth or\nrationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of\njustification which a given society—ours—uses in\none or another area of inquiry. (Rorty 1991: 23) For Rorty, warrant is a “sociological\nmatter, to be ascertained by observing the reception of [a\nspeaker’s] statement by her peers” (1993: 449). Rorty also\nclaims that knowledge and truth are compliments “paid to beliefs\nwhich we think so well justified that, for the moment, further\njustification is not needed” (Rorty 1991: 24) where the\n“we” is a historically conditioned community of\nenquirers. Rorty rejects the label “relativist” because he\ninsists that, unlike the relativists, he does not subscribe to the\nview that all beliefs are equally true or good. He calls his position\n“ethnocentrism”, because the only form of warrant\navailable to any of us is the one provided through solidarity with our\npeers.  His rejection of the label “relativist” has had\nlittle effect on critics such as Hilary Putnam\n(1999) or Paul Boghossian\n(2006a) who do not see the distinction Rorty wishes to draw between\nhis brand of ethnocentrism and relativism Debates about the scope and authority of logic are also focal to\ndiscussions of rationality. The argument for relativism about logic is\nusually traced to the French anthropologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl\n(1857–1939) who claimed that tribal or “primitive”\ncultures did not subscribe to universal laws of logic such as the\nprinciples of non-contradiction and identity and were in a pre-logical\nstage of thinking (Lévy-Bruhl 1922/1923). In a posthumous\npublication, Lévy-Bruhl renounced his earlier views, finding\nthem “simplistic and rather crude” (Lévy-Bruhl\n1949/1975: 48) but he remains the standard bearer for relativism about\nlogic. Peter Winch’s interpretation of the Azande material became\nthe impetus for a new wave of arguments for relativism about\nlogic. Barry Barnes and David Bloor, for instance, have argued that\ndifferent societies may have incompatible but internally coherent\nsystems of logic because validity and rules of inference are defined\nby, and hence are relative to, the practices of a given community,\nrather than a priori universal restrictions on all\nthought. According to Bloor, The Azande have the same psychology as us but\nradically different institutions. If we relate logic to the psychology\nof reasoning we shall be inclined to say that they have the same\nlogic; if we relate logic more closely to the institutional framework\nof thought then we shall incline to the view that the two cultures\nhave different logics. (Bloor 1976: 129–130) Even the status of “contradictions”\nis at times seen as culturally relative and the Azande’s\napplication of witchcraft in determining guilt is cited as an\nexample. The Azande, according to Evans-Prichard, believe that it is\npossible to identify a witch by examining the contents of his\nintestine (through the use of a poison oracle). They also believe\nthat Witchhood is inherited patrilineally.  Since the Azande clan\nmembers are related to each other through the male line, it follows\nthat if one person is shown to be a witch, then all the members of\nhis clan must also be witches. Evans-Pritchard tells us that although\nthe Azande see the sense of this argument they do not accept the\nconclusion; they seem to side-step the contradiction in their\nbelief-system. Relativistically inclined commentators have argued\nthat the Azande both do and do not contradict themselves depending\non, or relative to, the culture that is being taken as the vantage\npoint (Bloor 1976: 124 and Jennings 1989: 281). See Seidel (2014) for\na sustained critique. More recently, Peng and Nisbett, using experimental data, have\nargued that Chinese and American students have different attitudes\ntowards the Law of Non-Contradiction. The Chinese, they claim, are\nmore willing to accept that conflicting views may be compatible and\ntherefore are less disposed to recognize or condemn contradictions\n(Peng & Nisbett 1999). In his The Geography of Thought\n(2003), Nisbett has generalized his results to claim that Asian and\nEuropean structures of thinking, including perception and\nconceptualization, differ significantly. Nisbitt’s data, as well as the claims by Barnes and Bloor,\nare contributions to a long-standing debate about the status of logic.\nTheir approach attempts to naturalize logic by tying it to actual\npractices of the human subjects. The relativistically inclined,\nhowever, argue that to think of logic as singular, a priori, and\nuniversal speaks of a philosophical prejudice and does not sit well\nwith a naturalistic and scientific attitude. As to the claim by Quine\nand Davidson, that an allegedly illogical culture is in fact a\nmisinterpreted or badly interpreted culture—that if the speakers\nof a language seem to accept sentence of the form “P and\nnot-P”, this is conclusive evidence that\n“and” and “not” in their language do not mean\nwhat these words mean in English (Quine 1960)—the relativists and their sympathisers point out that reasoning in deviant ways is\nquite common and is not an impediment to understanding or translating\nothers (e.g., Stich 2012). They further argue that such diversity is\nbetter explained by the relativist’s claim that the correctness\nof the principles of reasoning is relative to their cultural\nbackground rather than by the absolutist approach that attributes\nwholesale error to alternative epistemic systems or to the members of\nother cultures. \nA different line of support for relativism about logic starts with\npluralism about logic, the view that there can be a multitude of\ncorrect but not fully compatible conceptions of logic where differing\naccounts of logical consequence, logical connectives or even validity\nare on offer. Relativism ensues if we also assume that there is no\nneutral framework for adjudicating between the differing accounts.\nWhat counts as a correct account of logical consequence and validity\nor even the choice of logical vocabulary are relative to the system of\nlogic that embed and justify these accounts and choices. (See\nSteinberger 2019 for a useful survey.) \nStewart Shapiro (2014) is probably the most vocal defender of this\napproach. His argument for relativism about logic is similar to\ndefences of relativism in other areas where intractable differences in\na particular domain and an inability to reconcile them are used as the\nmotivators for relativism. Shapiro advocates what, following Crispin\nWright, he calls “folk-relativism” and its slogan that “There is no\nsuch thing as simply being Φ” (Shapiro, 2014: 7; Wright 2008a:\n158) and applies it to validity and logical consequence. The claim is\nthat there are different conceptions of logical consequence. in\nclassical and non-classical logic, which although not compatible can\nstill capture correct accounts of the idea of logical\nconsequence. Therefore, it does not make sense to think that there is\na uniquely correct conception of validity and logical\nconsequence. Different conceptions can be legitimate in so far as each\nis (internally) consistent and also non-trivial in the sense that it\nis the basis a workable mathematical systems, i.e., the means of\nmaking sense of “the practice of pursuing and applying mathematics”\n(Shapiro 2014: 81). Intuitionism and fuzzy logic are notable examples.\nChoices between different logical vocabularies also can lead to a\nrelativized conception of logic in so far a these vocabularies play a\ndecisive role in generating different relations of logical\nconsequence. \nFor further discussion, see the entry on \n  logical pluralism. Discussions of relativism about science gained currency with the\npublication of Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions (1962) and the emergence of a historicist approach to\nquestion of change and progress in science. Pronouncements such as In so far as their only recourse to [the] world is\nthrough what they see and do, we may want to say that after a\nrevolution scientists are responding to a different world (Kuhn 1970\n[1962]: 111) and The very ease and rapidity with which astronomers\nsaw new things when looking at old objects with old instruments may\nmake us wish to say that, after Copernicus, astronomers lived in a\ndifferent world (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 117) were taken to suggest that not only standards of\nepistemic appraisal but even the data gathered by scientists were, to\na significant extent, determined by governing paradigms and hence\nrelative to them. Although Kuhn stepped back from such radical\nrelativism, his views gave currency to relativistic interpretations\nof science (though see Sankey 2018). Relativism about science is motivated by considerations arising\nfrom the methodology and history of science (Baghramian 2007). As we\nsaw in §4.2, Quine has argued that\n Physical theories can be at odds with each other\nand yet compatible with all possible data even in the broadest\npossible sense. In a word, they can be logically incompatible and\nempirically equivalent. (1970: 179)   Relativists about science have argued that only with the addition\nof auxiliary hypotheses could the scientist choose between various\ntheories and that such auxiliary hypotheses are colored by socially\nand historically grounded norms as well as by personal and group\ninterests. Paul Feyerabend’s “democratic\nrelativism”—the view that different societies may look at\nthe world in different ways and regard different things as acceptable\n(1987: 59) and that we need to give equal voice to these differing\nperspectives—is one instance of the use of the\nunderdetermination thesis in support of relativism. According to\nFeyerabend, underdetermination ultimately demonstrates that  for every statement, theory, point of view\nbelieved (to be true) with good reason there exist arguments showing a\nconflicting alternative to be at least as good, or even better. (1987:\n76) Larry Laudan usefully lists the ways\nunderdetermination is used to motivate relativism or its proximate\ndoctrines. He says:  Lakatos and Feyerabend have taken the\nunderdetermination of theories to justify the claim that the only\ndifference between empirically successful and empirically unsuccessful\ntheories lies in the talents and resources of their respective\nadvocates (i.e., with sufficient ingenuity, more or less any theory\ncan be made to look methodologically respectable). Hesse and Bloor\nhave claimed that underdetermination shows the necessity for bringing\nnoncognitive, social factors into play in explaining the theory\nchoices of scientists (on the grounds that methodological and\nevidential considerations alone are demonstrably insufficient to\naccount for such choices). H. M. Collins, and several of his fellow\nsociologists of knowledge, have asserted that underdetermination lends\ncredence to the view that the world does little if anything to shape\nor constrain our beliefs about it. (Laudan 1990: 321) Laudan even connects Derrida’s deconstructionism and the view\nthat texts do not lend themselves to determinate readings with\nunderdetermination (ibid.). He also believes that an appropriately\nmodest understanding of what underdetermination entails will distance\nit from relativism, but most relativistically inclined advocates of\nunderdetermination are not willing to follow Laudan’s advice to\ncircumscribe its scope. The key issue is that both the relativists and\nthe anti-relativists could agree that the totality of evidence\navailable does not prove the truth of any given theory. But the\nanti-relativists responds to this fact of underdetermination by\npointing out that the we have good reasons for embracing the best\ntheory available and moreover that there are indeed objective facts\nabout the world, even if we are not in possession of them. The\nrelativist, in contrast, argues that there are many, equally\nacceptable principles for accepting theories, all on the basis of\nevidence available, but such theories could result in very different\nverdicts. They also argue that in the absence of any strong epistemic\ngrounds for accepting the existence of absolute facts in any given\ndomain, we have no grounds, other than some kind of metaphysical\nfaith, for thinking that there are such facts. Relativism about science is also influenced by the related doctrine\nthat all observations are theory-laden. Even anti-relativists such as\nKarl Popper admit that the idea that observations are not in some way\ntinted by theoretical assumptions is naïve. But some relativists\nabout science offer a particularly extreme form of the doctrine of the\nwidely accepted thesis of theory-ladenness. Feyerabend, for instance,\ngoes so far as to argue that different systems of classification can\nresult in perceptual objects that are not easily comparable. Relativists about science also point to the prevalence of both\nsynchronic and diachronic disagreement among scientists as a\njustification of their view. Looking at the history of science, Kuhn\nand his followers argued that Aristotelian physics presupposes a\ntotally different conception of the universe compared to Newtonian\nphysics; the same is true of Einsteinian physics compared to its\npredecessors. Moreover, these differing conceptions may be\nincommensurable in the sense that they are not readily amenable to\ncomparison or inter-theoretical translation. There are also strong and\nunresolved disagreements between scientists working\ncontemporaneously. The many different interpretations of quantum\nmechanics are a case in point. Anti-relativist philosophers of science are often willing to\nconcede all three points above, but insist that they do not, singly or\njointly, justify the claim that scientific knowledge, in any\nphilosophically interesting sense, is relative to its context of\nproduction. The success of science, both theoretical and applied,\nindicates that progress does take place. Fallibilism, the view that\nall scientific claims are provisional and liable to fail, they argue,\nis sufficient for dealing with difficulties arising from\nconsiderations of underdetermination and theory-ladenness of\nobservations. Relativism, with its attendant denial that there could\nbe objective and universal scientific truths or knowledge exacts too\nhigh a price for dealing with these allegedly troublesome features of\nthe methodology and history of science. Social constructionism is a particularly radical form of conceptual\nrelativism with implications for our understanding of the methodology\nand subject matter of the sciences. According to social\nconstructionism, nature as studied by scientists does not come carved\nat its joints (to use Plato’s metaphor from Phaedrus:\n265d–266a). Reality—with its objects, entities, properties\nand categories—is not simply “out there” to be\ndiscovered only by empirical investigation or observation; rather, it\nis constructed through a variety of norm-governed socially sanctioned\ncognitive activities such as interpretation, description, manipulation\nof data, etc. Social constructionism has relativistic consequences\ninsofar as it claims that different social forces lead to the\nconstruction of different “worlds” and that there is no\nneutral ground for adjudicating between them. The “Science\nStudies” approach of Bruno Latour is a prime example of\nconstructionism with relativistic consequences. Latour and Woolgar\n(1986) have argued that so-called “scientific facts” and\nthe “truths” of science emerge out of social and\nconceptual practices and inevitably bear their imprints. This is\nbecause the very idea of a mind-independent reality open to scientific\nstudy, or as they call it “out-there-ness”, itself is the\nconsequence of scientific work rather than the cause. A crucial\ndifference between scientific realists and constructionists is that\nwhereas the realists see nature and society as the causes\nthat explain the outcomes of scientific enquiry, for the\nconstructionists the activity of scientists and engineers and of all their human\nand non-human allies is the cause, of which various states of nature\nand societies are the consequence. (Callon & Latour 1992:\n350–1) Scientific theories are also products of socially constituted\npractices. They are  contextually specific constructions which bear\nthe mark of the situated contingency and interest structure of the\nprocess by which they are generated. (Knorr-Cetina 1981:\n226) So called “scientific facts” and\n“natural kinds”, the primary subjects of scientific\ninvestigation are, at least in part, the products of the contingent\nsocial and epistemic norms that define the very subject matter of\nscience. It may be argued that the view, if taken literally, entails\na counter-intuitive form of backward causation to the effect that,\nfor instance, the scientific facts about dinosaur anatomy 50 million\nyears ago were caused in the 20th century when a\nscientific consensus about dinosaur anatomy was formed (see\nBoghossian 2006a). But constructionism, at least in its most extreme\nform, accepts this consequence, insisting that there are indeed no\nfacts except for socially constructed ones, created and modified at\nparticular times and places courtesy of prevailing theoretical and\nconceptual frameworks. Moral or ethical relativism is simultaneously the most influential\nand the most reviled of all relativistic positions. Supporters see it\nas a harbinger of tolerance (see §2.6),\nopen-mindedness and anti-authoritarianism. Detractors think it\nundermines the very possibility of ethics and signals either confused\nthinking or moral turpitude.  Briefly stated, moral relativism is the view that moral judgments,\nbeliefs about right and wrong, good and bad, not only vary greatly\nacross time and contexts, but that their correctness is dependent on\nor relative to individual or cultural perspectives and\nframeworks.  Moral subjectivism is the view that\nmoral judgments are judgments about contingent and variable\nfeatures of our moral sensibilities. For the subjectivist, to say that\nabortion is wrong is to say something like, “I disapprove of\nabortion”, or “Around here, we disapprove of\nabortion”. Once the content of the subjectivist’s claim is\nmade explicit, the truth or acceptability of a subjectivist moral\njudgment is no longer a relative matter. Moral relativism proper, on\nthe other hand, is the claim that facts about right and wrong vary\nwith and are dependent on social and cultural background. Understood\nin this way, moral relativism could be seen as a sub-division of\ncultural relativism. Values may also be relativized to frameworks of\nassessment, independent of specific cultures or social settings. Moral relativism, like most relativistic positions, comes in\nvarious forms and strengths. It is customary to distinguish between\ndescriptive or empirical, prescriptive or normative, and meta-ethical\nversions of moral relativism. These views in turn are motivated by a\nnumber of empirical and philosophical considerations similar to those\nintroduced in defense of cultural relativism.  The purported fact of ethical diversity, the claim\nthat there are no universally agreed moral norms or values, conjoined\nwith the intractability of the arguments about them, are the core\ncomponents of descriptive moral relativism. The anti-relativists\ncounter-argue that the observed diversity and lack of convergence in\nlocal norms can in fact be explained by some very general universal\nnorms, which combine with the different circumstances (or false\nempirical beliefs) of the different groups to entail different\nparticular norms. The objectivist thereby can accommodate diversity\nand lack of agreement at this higher level of generalization (see\nPhilippa Foot (1982) for this type of argument). As in the case of cultural relativism, the imperative of tolerance\nis often seen as a normative reason for adopting moral relativism.\nMoral relativism, it is argued, leads to tolerance by making us not\nonly more open-minded but also alerting us to the limitations of our\nown views. Edward Westermarck, for instance, in his early classic\ndefense of relativism writes:  Could it be brought home to people that there is\nno absolute standard in morality, they would perhaps be on the one\nhand more tolerant and on the other more critical in their\njudgments. (Westermarck 1932: 59) Critics however point out that for the consistent relativist\ntolerance can be only a framework-dependent virtue, while Westermarck,\nand others, seem to recommend it as a universal desideratum. A second\nproblem with arguing for normative moral relativism on the grounds of\ntolerance is known as the Argumentum ad Nazium.  Relativists,\nas this argument goes, are not in a position to condemn even the most\nabhorrent of worldviews as they are forced to admit that every point\nof view is right (relative to the perspective of its\nbeholder). W.T. Stace, arguing against Westermarck’s relativism\ngives an early example of this type of criticism:  Certainly, if we believe that any one moral standard\nis as good as any other, we are likely to be more tolerant. We shall\ntolerate widow-burning, human sacrifice, cannibalism, slavery, the\ninfliction of physical torture, or any other of the thousand and one\nabominations which are, or have been, from time approved by moral code\nor another.  But this is not the kind of toleration that we want, and\nI do not think its cultivation will prove “an advantage to\nmorality”. (Stace 1937: 58–59) More moderate forms of normative moral relativism, positions that\nsometimes are characterized as moral pluralism, have been defended by\nDavid Wong (2006) and David Velleman (2013). Moderate moral\nrelativists endorse the idea of diversity and plurality of ethical\nvalues and accept that such values are justified according to\ndiffering local normative frameworks, but they avoid a full blown\n“anything goes” relativism by maintaining that all such\nframeworks are ultimately answerable to conditions for human\nflourishing and other overarching universal constraints such as the\nvalue of accommodation (Wong 2006). (It should however be noted that\nwhile theses under the description of pluralism needn’t entail a\ncommitment to relativism, some formulations of relativism (such as\nBoghossian’s 2006b), include, as an essential ingredient, a\n“pluralist” clause. Whether particular instances of moral\npluralism entail moral relativism depends entirely on the details of\nrelevant claim to pluralism).  Metaethical versions of moral relativism are often motivated by the\nthought that ethical positions, unlike scientific beliefs, are not apt\nfor objective truth-evaluation. Strong realists about science such as\nGilbert Harman have argued that the intractability of moral\ndisagreements, the absence of convergence in ethics as opposed to the\nnatural sciences and mathematics, point to fundamental differences\nbetween natural facts and ethical values (Harman & Thompson\n1996). This is a metaethical, rather than a descriptive or normative\nposition, because it is a theory about the nature of ethics or\nmorality. The ethical domain, Harman argue, is such that all relevant\nevaluations could be undertaken only in the context of social norms or\npersonal preferences and commitments.  Values are not\nobjective—they are not part of the fabric of the\nuniverse. Rather they always arise from some form of convention and\nagreement among people. Therefore, there can be no objective or\nexternally justified ethical knowledge or judgment (Harman 1975). In\nthis sense, metaethical relativism shares common concerns with\nnon-cognitivist approaches to ethics. What distinguishes it, however,\nis the insistence on the part of metaethical relativists that moral\njudgments contain an implicit relativization to the speaker’s\nmoral outlook (Dreier 2006: 261). It is possible to talk about the\ntruth or falsity of a moral judgment but only in the context of\npre-existing standards or value systems. For instance, we can ask\nquestions about just actions or judgments in the context of standards\nof justice prevalent in a society at a given time; but questions about\nthe objective standing of these standards do not make sense (cf., Boghossian 2017). (For\nfurther discussion of moral relativism see the separate entry on this\ntopic. What has become known as New Moral Relativism will be discussed\nbelow). There is a recent version of relativism according to which some of\nthe views considered so far—for instance, Harman’s (1975)\nvariety of moral relativism—will be regarded varieties\nof contextualism as opposed to bona fide relativism.\nThis recent version—sufficiently distinct from the relativisms\nso far considered that it is deserving of attention in its own\nright—we are calling “New Relativism”, a variety of\nrelativism that has arisen out of work in the philosophy of language\nin the analytic tradition, and for which the leading proponents have\nincluded Max Kölbel (2003, 2004), Peter Lasersohn (2005), Crispin\nWright (2006) and, in particular, John MacFarlane (2005b, 2007, 2014);\ncf., Marques (2019).  In this section we aim to (i) outline several\nfeatures that individuate New Relativism; (ii) consider in turn\nmotivations for (and objections to) several prominent strands of it;\nand, finally, (iii) conclude with some philosophical problems that\nface New Relativism more generally. It is a commonplace that the truth-value of an utterance can depend\non the context in which it is uttered. If you say “I’m\nhappy” and I say the same sentence, your utterance may be true\nand mine false. In such cases, the context of utterance plays a role\nin determining which proposition the sentence expresses. This can\nhappen even when the sentence does not contain an overtly indexical\nexpression. Thus Harman and Dreier hold that a statement of the form\n“A is wrong” is roughly equivalent to\n“A is wrong according to the moral system I\naccept”. So two utterances of (say) “Torture is\nwrong” can differ in truth-value if they are uttered by speakers\nwho accept very different moral systems. Contextualists about\n(for instance) moral, aesthetic and epistemic discourse will view\nmoral, aesthetic and epistemic expressions likewise as indexical\nexpressions but (as we’ll see) with some difficulty explaining\napparent genuine disagreement in these areas of discourse. On\nthis point, New Relativists claim an important advantage over\ncontextualists. New relativism, by contrast with\ncontextualism, aims to achieve this advantage via a much less\nfamiliar form of context dependence. Truth-relativism with respect to utterances in area of\ndiscourse D is the claim that, following MacFarlane’s\nnotable version of the view: the truth\nof S’s D-utterance u depends (in part) on\na context of assessment; that is (and in short) what S\nasserts, u, gets a truth value—according to the\ntruth-relativist’s D-semantics—only once\nthe D-standard of the assessor is\nspecified. Independent of the specification of such a\nstandard, S’s u assertion lacks a truth-value much\nas, by comparison, indexical expressions such as “The barn is\nnearby” do not get a truth-value independent of contextual facts\nabout the context of use (i.e. the context in which the\nutterance is made). And, as a further point of clarification here:\nwhile the contextualist can, no less than the relativist, recognize a\n“standards” or “judge” parameter, for the\ncontextualist, its value will be supplied by the context\nof use, whereas the relativist takes it to be supplied\ncompletely independently of the context of use, by the context of\nevaluation (or, as MacFarlane calls it, the context of\nassessment). To see how this view is claimed to offer a satisfying take on\ndisagreement in types of discourse (see Beddor 2019), consider a simple example, concerning predicates of\npersonal taste. A utters, “Pretzels are tasty”,\nand B utters, “Pretzels are not tasty”. While the\nsemantic invariantist (for whom the truth-value of taste\npredications is in no way context sensitive) will insist that the\nabove exchange constitutes a genuine disagreement about whether\npretzels are tasty and that at least one party is wrong,\ncontextualists and truth-relativists have the prima facie\nadvantageous resources to avoid the result that at least one party to\nthe apparent disagreement has made a mistake. The contextualist claims that the truth-evaluable content\nexpressed by A’s utterance encodes A’s\nstandards (cf. non-indexical contextualism). Thus,\nin this apparent disagreement, the proposition expressed by A\nis “Pretzels are tasty relative to my [A’s]\nstandards” while B expresses the proposition\n“Pretzels are not tasty relative to my [B’s]\nstandards”. This maneuver avoids the result that at least one of\nthe two parties has uttered something false, but (as the new\nrelativist points out) this result comes at the price of being unable\nto offer a clear explanation of our intuition that there is some\nuniform content about which A and B disagree. The new relativist, on the other hand, claims to be able to\npreserve both the apparent subjectivity of taste\ndiscourse and (and, unlike the contextualist) our intuition\nthat exchanges of the form mentioned constitute genuine\ndisagreements. They do this by first insisting (unlike the\ncontextualist—though see Suikkanen 2019) that there is a single truth-evaluable proposition\nwhich A affirms and B denies. In the case where A\nsays “Pretzels are tasty”, and B denies this, there\nis a uniform content that is affirmed by A’s utterance\nand denied by B’s, namely the proposition that\npretzels are tasty, period. So we have a genuine\ndisagreement. Unlike the truth-absolutist, however, the new relativist\nwill add that the disagreement is faultless because the\nproposition affirmed in A’s utterance has a truth value\nonly relative to a judge or standards parameter, and\nin this case: A’s standards, when A is the\nassessor, B’s standards, when B is the\nassessor. Hence, the truth-relativist about predicates of personal\ntaste will, by insisting that the truth of Pretzels are tasty\ndepends on the context of assessment, allow a single proposition to be\n(at the same time): New Relativist views, which endorse truth-relativism\nlocally for some domain of discourse, stand in opposition to the more\ntraditional view of propositional content (what Cappelen &\nHawthorne call “The Simple View”) according to which\npropositions bear truth and falsity as monadic properties\n(cf.  however, MacFarlane 2011a for some resistance to Cappelen & Hawthorne’s\nclaim that this simple characterization should be regarded as the\n“received” view.) A key source of philosophical motivation for relativizing truth in\nthe fashion of New Relativism traces to Lewis’s (1980) and\nKaplan’s (1989) foundational work in semantics, according to which\nsentence truth is to be understood as relative to a circumstance of\nevaluation that includes world, time and location. New Relativists\ninherit the formal apparatus of Lewis and Kaplan and add another\nparameter, but their reasons for doing so are quite different from the\nreasons that motivated the framework in the first place. While\nLewis’s and Kaplan’s reasons for\n“proliferating” parameters were primarily based on\nconsiderations to do with intensional operators (though see Yli-Vakkuri et al. 2019), the more contemporary\nreasons for adding a judge or standard parameter are often to do with\nrespecting (for instance) disagreement data. (For further discussion\nhere, see\nKölbel (2015)). (Note that “old-style contextualism” can\nalso be stated in Kaplan’s framework; it involves variation in\ncontent with respect to the context of utterance rather than in truth\nvalue with respect to the circumstance of evaluation). Kaplan’s view specifically was that the need for particular\nparameters in the circumstance of evaluation was a function of\nthe non-specificity of certain propositional contents with\nrespect to world, time and location (see Kaplan’s (1989)\nanalysis of indexicals). On Kaplan’s view:  A circumstance will usually include a possible\nstate or history of the world, a time, and perhaps other features as\nwell. The amount of information we require from a circumstance is\nlinked to the degree of specificity of contents and thus to the kinds\nof operators in the language…. (1989: 502) John MacFarlane, a leading contemporary relativist, writes:  Taking this line of thought a little farther, the\nrelativist might envision contents that are “sense-of-humor\nneutral” or “standard-of-taste neutral” or\n“epistemic-state neutral”, and circumstances of evaluation\nthat include parameters for a sense of humor, a standard of taste or\nan epistemic state. This move would open up room for the truth value\nof a proposition to vary with these “subjective” factors\nin much the same way that it varies with the world of\nevaluation. (MacFarlane 2007: 6–7) Similarly, Cappelen and Hawthorne write:  Contemporary analytic relativists reason as follows:\n‘Lewis and Kaplan have shown that we need to relativize truth to\ntriples of <world, time, location>[’]. … But,\nhaving already started down this road, why not exploit these\nstrategies further? In particular, by adding new and exotic parameters\ninto the circumstances of evaluation, we can allow the contents of\nthought and talk to be non-specific (in Kaplan’s sense) along\ndimensions other than world, time and location. (2009:\n10; edited) A question on which New Relativists are divided, however,\nis: what contents are non-specific along dimensions other\nthan world, time and location? It is with respect to this general\nquestion that different families of New Relativism are generated. The taxonomy we offer is that a view falls within the category\nof New Relativism if, and only if, the view endorses a\ntruth-relativist semantics (as previously outlined) for utterance\ntokens in some domain of discourse, such as: discourse about\npredicates of personal taste (Lasersohn 2005; Kölbel 2003),\nepistemic modals (Egan 2007; Egan, Hawthorne & Weatherson\n2005; MacFarlane\n2011b; Stephenson\n2007), future contingents (MacFarlane 2003), indicative conditionals\n(Weatherson 2009; Kolodny & MacFarlane 2010) gradable adjectives\n(Richard 2004), deontic\nmodals (Kolodny & MacFarlane 2010 and MacFarlane 2014: ch. 11) and\nknowledge attributions (Richard 2004); MacFarlane 2005b, 2011c,\n2014). The motivations for truth-relativism in each of these domains\ninclude various considerations unique to those domains. We consider\nsome of the arguments for New Relativism in four of these domains in\nthe following sections. One area of discourse that has been particularly fertile ground for\nNew Relativism is discourse that concerns predicates of personal\ntaste (e.g., “tasty” and “fun”.) Take a case where Mary says: “The chili is tasty” and\nJohn says, “The chili is not tasty”. Lasersohn argues\n(much as Kölbel does) that only the truth-relativist can\nmake sense of the nature of John and Mary’s disagreement: It is\na genuine disagreement. One affirms what the other denies.  And yet\nneither is wrong. Lasersohn argues that there is an elegant way to\nmake sense of the idea that John and Mary are both (in some sense)\nright, even though John asserts the negation of what is expressed by\nMary. What Lasersohn) suggests, more formally, is the introduction of\na judge parameter.  Instead of treating the content of a sentence as a\nset of time-world pairs, we should treat it as a set of\ntime-world-individual triples. We assume that the content will provide\nan individual to be used in evaluating the sentences for truth and\nfalsity, just as it provides a time and world. (Lasersohn: 2005:\n17) Lasersohn adds (2005: 23) that in order to maintain an\nauthentically subjective assignment of truth-values to\nsentences containing predicates of personal taste, we must allow that\nthe objective facts of the situation of utterance do not uniquely\ndetermine a judge. But who is the judge? Typically, it\nis us, and when it is, the evaluation is from what Lasersohn\ncalls an autocentric perspective. Importantly, Lasersohn\nallows that in certain circumstances we take an exocentric\nperspective when assessing predicates of personal taste:\nassessing these sentences for truth relative to contexts in which\nsomeone other than ourselves is specified as the judge (cf.\n“Come on, it’ll be fun!” “Is this fun?”\n(2005: 26); cf. Stanley (2005: 10) for a response to\nLasersohn’s program). Kölbel’s (2003) faultless disagreement argument\nfor relativism about predicates of personal taste features a\n“proof” that there is no faultless disagreement\nfollowed by a demonstration that the proof is indefensible. The proof\nproceeds from two premises: an equivalence schema and an apparent truism about mistakes: (ES) and (T) generate the conclusion that there is no faultless\ndisagreement through the following proof (see also Wright 2001:52) But because Kölbel takes (9) to be implausible in what\nKölbel takes to be “discretionary” (non-objective, as\nKölbel sees it) areas of discourse he contends that we should\nintroduce a relativized version of (T) to avoid the conclusion that at\nleast one party has made a mistake. Kölbel claims further that, for reasons of uniformity, we\nshould “relativize truth of all propositions across the\nboard…” and he accordingly endorses the following version\nof truth relativism: Kölbel (2003: 71) thinks that this position allows the\npossibility of maintaining that faultless disagreement is impossible\nin some non-discretionary (objective) areas, and this will\ndepend on the relation of perspective possession (but see also\nBoghossian 2011 for the contrary view). An implication of the position\nis that Kölbel’s view will allow assertions of the form:\n“Pretzels are not tasty, though John believes they are. And yet\nJohn is not mistaken”. For other discussions of faultless\ndisagreement, see Richard (2008), MacFarlane (2012, 2014: ch. 6), and\nZeman (2019). For an attempt to countenance faultless disagreement\nwithin an absolutist framework, see Baker & Robson (2017). There is a version of moral relativism (e.g., Kölbel\n2004) that falls squarely within the New Relativist tradition. We can\nthink of this relativism simply as a generalization of the position\njust discussed that treats moral terms (e.g.,\n“right”, “good”) as assessment-sensitive along\nwith predicates of personal taste. Such an extension faces problems analogous to those faced by\ntruth-relativists about predicates of personal taste (cf. \nBeebe (2010) for a helpful discussion of truth-relativist semantics\nversus varieties of contextualist competitors). A broader kind of problem for this semantic thesis (as well as to\nmoral relativists more generally), raised by Coliva and Moruzzi (2012)\nis that it succumbs to the progress argument, an argument\nthat famously challenges, in particular, cultural relativists (as well\nas indexical contextualists) about moral judgments by insisting that\nmoral progress is both evident and not something the relativist can\ncountenance (e.g., Rachels 2009). A third and particularly important\nkind of worry, addressed by Capps, Lynch and Massey (2009),\ninvolves explaining the source and nature of moral\nrelativity, on a truth-relativist framework. Specifically, they claim\nthat  we ought to have some account of why it\nis that truth in the moral domain is such that it varies with a\nparameter set by the context of assessment. (Capps, Lynch & Massey\n2009: 416) \nAn additional problem concerns the plausibility of simply extending disagreement based arguments for relativism about predicates of personal taste over to moral predicates like ‘right’ and ‘good’. As Wedgwood (2019) has suggested, moral disagreements, in a way that is disanalogous to  disagreements about what’s tasty, implicate a kind of ‘inexcusable irrationality’ (2019: 97)—at least, if the moral truths that constitute moral principles are a priori knowable. To the extent that there is a difference in inexcusability across the two cases of disagreement, it would be contentious to think that an argument from ‘faultless disagreement’ to relativism in the arena of predicates of personal taste would extend, mutatis mutandis, to an analogous argument in the moral arena. Epistemic modality (e.g., claims of the form “S might\nbe F”) is another particularly fertile ground for New\nRelativists. A key reason for this is the dialectical force\nof Eavesdropper Arguments, which attempt to show the perils\nof contextualist treatments of utterances containing epistemic\nmodals. Another prominent argument concerns metasemantic\ncomplexity. We will examine both of these argument strategies. But\nfirst, let’s distinguish epistemic modality\nfrom metaphysical modality. To say that p is\nmetaphysically possible is to say that p might have been\nthe case in the sense that: in some possible world, p is\ntrue. To say that p is epistemically possible is by\ncontrast to say that p might be the case, or\nthat p is the case for all we know (see the entry on\nVarieties of Modality).  A\ncanonical example of a statement expressing an epistemic modal is the\nclaim A might be F. The truth of claims of the\nform A might be F will depend on\nwhether F is an epistemic possibility for some individual or\ngroup, which is to say, that F must not be ruled out by what\nsome individual or group knows. But which individual or\ngroup? This is not always clear. As Egan and Weatherson (2011: 4)\nremark:  …statements of epistemic possibility in\nplain English do not make any explicit reference to such a person,\ngroup, evidence set, or information state. One of the key issues\nconfronting a semanticist attempting to theorize about epistemic\nmodals is what to do about this lack of reference. Eavesdropper-style cases highlight the difficulty of determining\nexactly which individual’s or group’s body of information\nis relevant to the truth of claims of epistemic possibility and are\ntaken by defenders of truth-relativism about epistemic modals to\nmotivate their position. A variety of different eavesdropper cases\nhave been given by different proponents (and attempted refuters) of\ntruth-relativism about epistemic modals in the literature. For ease of\nexposition, we will use an especially simple version of the case, from\nHawthorne’s (2007), slightly amended:  EAVESDROPPER: [Sandra] is on the way to the grocery\nstore. I hear her say: “Susan might be at the store. I could run\ninto her”. No party to the conversation that I am listening in\non knows that Susan is on vacation. But I know that she is. Despite\nthe fact that it is compatible with what the conversants know that\nSusan is in the store and that the speaker will run into her, I am\ninclined to judge the speaker’s [Sandra’s] modal judgments\nto be incorrect. (Hawthorne 2007: 92) Egan (2007), Egan, Hawthorne and Weatherson (2005) and MacFarlane\n(2011b) share a similar set\nof diagnoses here: (i) it seems that while Sandra and I disagree about\nthe truth value of Sandra’s statement, neither she nor I have\nmade a mistake; (ii) the contextualist can’t explain this; (iii)\nthe truth-relativist can. Why can’t the contextualist explain this? As noted, the truth\nof claims expressing epistemic modals must depend on what some\nindividual or group knows. But in these cases the context of\nuse does not pick out a single such individual or\ngroup. After all, if it did, then either Sandra or I would be wrong,\nbut it seems that neither of us is. That the context of use does not\nuniquely pick out one relevant body of knowledge for determining the\ntruth of epistemic modal statements is not, as MacFarlane notes,\nsomething that can be accommodated by “the framework of\ncontextualism, which requires that the relevant body of knowledge be\ndetermined by features of the context of use”. (MacFarlane 2011c) Additionally, as Egan and Weatherson (2011) suggest, any\ncontextualist account of the semantics of epistemic modals\nthat could handle eavesdropper-style cases in a principled\nway would be hideously complicated. This motivates a metasemantic\nargument against contextualism (and a corresponding argument for\nrelativism): if contextualism about epistemic modals is correct, then\nthe semantics for epistemic modals will be hideously complicated; the\nsemantics is not hideously complicated on the truth-relativist’s\nproposal, therefore, ceteris paribus, truth-relativism for\nepistemic modals is more plausible than contextualism. However,\nGlanzberg (2007) notably denies that metasemantic complexity in this\ncase must be problematic. How can the relativist accommodate eavesdropper cases? MacFarlane\n(2011b) articulates the relativist solution: Sandra and I disagree\nabout the truth-value of a single proposition, the\nproposition that Susan might be at the store. This proposition, even\nwhen fully articulated, makes no reference to any particular body of\nknowledge. But such propositions cannot be true or false\nsimpliciter. They are true only relative to a context of assessment\nthat includes a body of knowledge. In this case, the proposition is\ntrue relative to a context of assessment where what Sandra\nknows is operative—a context in which Sandra is the\nevaluator—and false relative to a context of assessment where\nwhat I know is operative because I am the evaluator. Thus:\nboth disagreement and faultlessness are preserved (cf. Ross\n& Schroeder 2013 for criticism and Kindermann & Egan (2019)\nfor an alternative proposal). Along with MacFarlane, Egan (2007) and Stephenson (2007) have also\noffered positive defenses of truth-relativism about epistemic modals;\ntheir defenses share MacFarlane’s view that propositions\nexpressing epistemic modals are non-specific along dimensions that\ninclude the body of information possessed by a judge or assessor. More recently, experimental philosophy has contributed to this\ndebate. Empirical studies reported by Knobe & Yalcin (2014) and\nKhoo (2015) indicate that folk judgments about the truth of claims\nfeaturing epistemic modals aligns more closely with what contextualism\nrather than relativism would predict. However, see Beddor and Egan\n(2019) for experimental results that are argued to better support (a\nversion of) relativism than contextualism. Propositions termed “future contingents” are about the\nfuture and their truth-values are not settled by the state of the\nworld in the past or present (see entry on\nFuture Contingents, and\nMacFarlane 2014: ch. 9). In a deterministic world there are no future\ncontingent statements in this sense. But in an indeterministic world,\nstatements partly about the future will often satisfy these\nconditions. Consider Aristotle’s oft-cited example: the\nproposition There will be a sea battle tomorrow, uttered\nat t. Contrast now two intuitions: the determinacy intuition\nthat utterances that “turned out true” were true at the\ntime of utterance; and the indeterminacy intuition that, at\nthe time of the utterance, multiple histories are possible, including\none where there was a sea battle and the proposition is true, and one\nwhere there was not, and the proposition is false.\nThe indeterminacy intuition leads us to think the truth-value\nof future contingents is indeterminate at the time of utterance, and\neither true or false at a later time (cf. MacFarlane 2003;\nCarter 2011). John MacFarlane (2003)\nthinks that both the indeterminacy intuition and\nthe determinacy intuition should be taken at face value and\nthat the only way to account for the semantics of future contingents\nis to allow the truth of future contingent statements to be, as he\nputs it, doubly relativized: to both the context of utterance and the\ncontext of assessment. When we evaluate a single token utterance of\n“There will be a sea battle tomorrow” produced on (say)\nMonday, this counts as neither true nor false when the context of\nassessment is the context in which the utterance is being made (as\nmultiple possible histories are open at this point). However the very\nsame statement will have a determinate truth-value relative to the\ncontext of assessment of the following day.  So we can have faultless\ntranstemporal disagreement about the truth-value of a single utterance\n(MacFarlane 2003: 36; cf. Carter 2011). MacFarlane (2005b) argues\nthat “know” is sensitive to the epistemic standards at\nplay in the context of assessment; that is, the extension of\n“know” varies with the context of assessment.  Much as the\nrelativist about future contingents aimed to accommodate both the\ndeterminacy and indeterminacy intuitions, the relativist about\n\nknowledge attributions can be viewed as offering an attempted\n\nsynthesis between the contextualist and both sensitive and insensitive\n\nvarieties of invariantist (see entry on\nEpistemic Contextualism).\nAs MacFarlane (2014: 190) puts it:  Invariantism is right that there is a single\n\nknowledge relation, and that the accuracy of knowledge ascriptions\ndoes not depend on which epistemic standard is relevant at the context\nof use. But contextualism is right that the accuracy of such\nascriptions depends somehow on contextually relevant\nstandards. Relativism seeks to synthesize these insights into a more\nsatisfactory picture. To apply this view, suppose George says, “Bill knows that his\ncar is in the driveway”, while Barry says, “Bill\ndoesn’t know that his car is in the driveway”. According\nto the relativist, the assessment of the truth-values of Bill’s\nand Barry’s statements depends also on the specification of some\nepistemic standard. For the truth-relativist, the standard will be the\noperative standard in the context of assessment. George’s\nutterance may be true (and Barry’s false) relative to a context\nof assessment in which ordinary “low” standards are in\nplace, whereas Barry’s may be true (and George’s false)\nrelative to a context of assessment in which high\n“Cartesian” standards are in place. See Stanley (2005:\nch. 7) for a detailed criticism of this position, though see also\nMacFarlane (2014: §8.5 for a reply). See also Richard\n(2004), for another\nversion of truth-relativism for knowledge attributions. In\nMacFarlane’s more recent (2014) defense of a truth-relativist\nsemantics for “knows”, the context of assessment is taken\nto fix which alternatives count as relevant. See, however, Carter 2015\nfor an argument that MacFarlane’s more recent view generates\ncounterintuitive results in cases of environmental epistemic luck\n(e.g., barn façade-style cases) and normative defeaters. We turn now to two general arguments against New Relativism in all\nits forms. The first is an argument from assertion, the\nsecond an argument from simplicity. Two assertion-related objections to New Relativism arise from work\nby Gareth Evans (1985) and Robert Stalnaker (1978), respectively.\nGreenough (2010: 2) concisely captures Evans’s challenge to\ntruth-relativism on assertoric grounds as follows: The relativist must plausibly take issue with (2) or (3), (or\nboth).  For an attempt to meet Evans’ challenge, MacFarlane has\ndefended a way to effectively reject (2) via what Marques has called a\n“meet-the-challenge” norm of assertion (cf.\nMacFarlane 2003; though see also his 2014: ch. 5; cf., Stanley 2016: 181–2)—according to\nwhich (à la Brandom 1983), in asserting p one\nundertakes a commitment to either defending p or giving\nup p if the challenge cannot be met satisfactorily (see\nKölbel (2004: 308) for some other discussions of this\nobjection). A related assertion-based challenge to truth-relativism emerges by\nappeal to Stalnaker’s (1978) belief transfer model of\nassertion (cf. 2011). The idea here is to appeal to a\nplausible view of the purpose of assertion—to “transfer\nbeliefs from assertor to members of her audience” (Egan 2007:\n15) and then to object that what is asserted, according to the\ntruth-relativist, cannot play this characteristic role; specifically,\nthis will be because, for the truth-relativist, the asserted contents\nare liable to be true relative to the speaker but false relative to\nthe audience. For instance, Sam hardly (on the\ntruth-relativist’s program) seems to\n“transfer” to Dean his belief Apples are\ntasty (which is true) by asserting this to Dean, when what Dean\ncomes to believe Apples are tasty is something (on the\nassumption that Dean doesn’t like apples) that will be\nfalse. Thus, and more generally, it’s not clear what, exactly,\ncould be said to be transferred and a fortiori\nasserted. See Egan (2007) and Dinges (2017) for attempts to reconcile truth-relativism\n(about epistemic modals) with Stalnaker’s belief-transfer model\nof assertion. Cappelen and Hawthorne (2009) assess the merits of New Relativism\nas it stands to challenge what they take to be the received view of\nthe objects of thought and talk, “Simplicity”, the core\ntenets of which are: Cappelen and Hawthorne understand New Relativism (what they call\nanalytic relativism) as a direct challenge to (T1) and that,\nif this challenge were successful, it would consequently bring down\nthe more general picture they call “simplicity” (cf.,\nFerrari & Wright 2017). Accordingly, Cappelen and\nHawthorne’s central objective is to show that\ntruth-relativist’s arguments aimed at undermining (T1) are\nultimately unsuccessful; more specifically, their broad strategy is to\ninsist that the arguments adduced in favor of\ntruth-relativism—when thoroughly understood—constitute a\npresumptive case for contextualism (in the domains where\nrelativism was defended, and in particular, in the domain of\npredicates of personal taste). Relativism comes in a plethora of forms that are themselves\ngrounded in disparate philosophical motivations. There is no such\nthing as Relativism simpliciter, and no single argument that would\nestablish or refute every relativistic position that has been\nproposed. Despite this diversity, however, there are commonalities and\nfamily resemblances that justify the use of the label\n“relativism” for the various views we have discussed.\nRelativism remains a hotly disputed topic still surviving various\nattempts to eliminate it from philosophical discourse. What is most\nsurprising, however, is the recent popularity of some versions of the\ndoctrine in at least some circles of analytic philosophy.","contact.mail":"jadamcarter@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
