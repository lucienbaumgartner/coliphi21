The Sanskrit term\nabhidharma seems to derive from the expression\n“concerning (abhi) the teaching(s) (Skt.,\ndharma, Pali, dhamma).” For the Buddhist\nexegetical tradition, however, the term means approximately\n“higher” or “further” teaching, and it refers\nboth to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement and\nto the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of Buddhist\nthought. This body of literature includes the third of the “three\nbaskets” (Skt., tripiṭaka, Pali,\ntipiṭaka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the\nAbhidharma-piṭaka (Pali,\nAbhidhamma-piṭaka), its commentaries, and later\nexegetical texts.\n\n\n\nBoth as an independent literary genre and a branch of thought and\ninquiry, Abhidharma is to be contrasted with Sūtrānta, the\nsystem of the Buddha’s discourses (Skt., sūtras,\nPali, suttas). Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that are\ncolloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the Buddha’s\nteachings in technical terms that are carefully defined to ensure\nanalytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive in its\nefforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist practice\nof meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of sentient\nexperience. It does so by analyzing conscious experience—and in\nthis sense one’s “world”—into its constituent\nmental and physical events (Skt., dharmā, Pali,\ndhammā, hereafter dharmas/dhammas respectively).\nThe overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas\ninto multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure\nby means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is\nreferred to as the “dharma theory.” The exhaustive\ninvestigations into the nature and interaction of dharmas\nextended into the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology,\nand generated doctrinal controversies among different Buddhist schools.\nThe Abhidharma analysis of and methods of argumentation about these\ncontroversies provided the framework of reference and defined the\nagenda for the Mahāyāna schools of Madhyamaka and\nYogācāra. As a distinct doctrinal movement, then, Abhidharma\nhad a remarkable impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and gave rise to\nBuddhist systematic philosophy and hermeneutics.\n\n\n\nThe early history of Buddhism in India is remarkably little known\nand the attempt to construct a consistent chronology of that history\nstill engrosses the minds of contemporary scholars. A generally\naccepted tradition has it that some time around the beginning of the\nthird century BCE, the primitive Buddhist community divided into two\nparties or fraternities: the Sthaviras (Pali, Theriyas) and the\nMahāsāṅghikas, each of which thenceforth had its own\nordination traditions. Throughout the subsequent two centuries or so,\ndoctrinal disputes arose between these two parties, resulting in the\nformation of various schools of thought (vāda;\nācariyavāda) and teacher lineages\n(ācariyakula) (Vin 51–54; Mhv V\n12–13. See Cousins 1991, 27–28; Frauwallner 1956, 5ff &\n130ff; Lamotte 1988, 271ff). \n\nAccording to traditional Buddhist accounts, by the time the\nMahāyāna doctrines arose, roughly in the first century BCE,\nthere were eighteen sub-sects or schools of Sthaviras, the tradition\nancestral to the Theravāda (“advocates of the doctrine of\nthe elders”). The number eighteen, though, became conventional in\nBuddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons (Obeyesekere\n1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve divergent lists\nof schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The likelihood is that\nthe early formative period of the Buddhist community gave rise to\nmultiple intellectual branches that developed spontaneously due to the\ngeographical extension of the community over the entire Indian\nsubcontinent and subject to the particular problems that confronted\neach monastic community (saṅgha). Each\nsaṅgha tended to specialize in a specific branch of\nlearning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay circles,\nand was influenced by the particular territories, economy, and use of\nlanguage and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed, the names of\nthe “eighteen schools” are indicative of their origins in\ncharacteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or the legacy of\nparticular founders: for instance, Sarvāstivāda\n(“advocates of the doctrine that all things exist”),\nSautrāntikas (“those who rely on the\nsūtras”)/Dārṣṭāntikas\n(“those who employ\n examples”),[1]\nand Pudgalavāda\n(“those who affirm the existence of the person”);\nHaimavatas (“those of the snowy mountains”); or\nVātsīputrīyas (“those affiliated with\nVātsīputra”) respectively. As noted by Gethin (1998,\n52), rather than sects or denominations as in Christianity, “at\nleast some of the schools mentioned by later Buddhist tradition are\nlikely to have been informal schools of thought in the manner of\n‘Cartesians,’ ‘British Empiricists,’ or\n‘Kantians’ for the history of modern\n philosophy.”[2] \n\nIt is customarily assumed that the multiple ancient Buddhist schools\ntransmitted their own versions of Abhidharma collections, but only two\ncomplete canonical collections are preserved, representing two schools:\nthe Sarvāstivāda, who emerged as an independent school from\nwithin the Sthaviras around the second or first century BCE, became\ndominant in north, especially northwest India, and spread to central\nAsia; and the Sinhalese Theravāda, a branch of the Sthaviras that\nspread out in south India and parts of southeast Asia. These two extant\ncollections comprise the third of the “three baskets”\n(Skt., tripiṭaka, Pali, tipiṭaka) of the\nBuddhist canon. The exegetical traditions of the Sarvāstivāda\nand Theravāda understand their respective canonical Abhidharma to\nconsist of a set of seven texts, though each school specifies a\ndifferent set of texts. The Sarvāstivādin\nAbhidharma-piṭaka consists of the\nSaṅgītiparyāya (Discourse on the\nCollective Recitation), the Dharmaskandha (Compendium\nof Dharmas), the\nPrajñaptiśāstra (Manual of\nConcepts), the Vijñānakāya\n(Compendium of Consciousness), the\nDhātukāya (Compendium of Elements), the\nPrakaraṇapāda (Literary\nExposition), and the Jñānaprasthāna\n(The Foundation of Knowledge). These seven texts survive in\nfull only in their ancient Chinese translations. The Theravādin\nAbhidhamma-piṭaka comprises the\nDhammasaṅgaṇi (Enumeration of\nDhammas), the Vibhaṅga (Analysis), the\nDhātukathā (Discourse on Elements), the\nPuggalapaññatti (Designation of\nPersons), the Kathāvatthu (Points of\nDiscussion), the Yamaka (Pairs), and the\nPaṭṭhāna (Causal Conditions). These\nseven texts are preserved in Pali and all but the Yamaka have\nbeen translated into English. \n\nLater generations composed commentaries on the canonical Abhidharma\nand introduced a variety of exegetical manuals that expound the\nessentials of the canonical systems. These post-canonical texts are the\nproducts of single authors and display fully developed polemical\nstances and sectarian worldviews of their respective schools. Much of\nthe Theravāda Abhidhamma system is contained in\nBuddhaghosa’s comprehensive Visuddhimagga (The Path\nof Purification, fifth century CE). More direct introductory\nAbhidhamma manuals are Buddhadatta’s\nAbhidhammāvatāra (Introduction to\nAbhidhamma, fifth century CE) and Anuruddha’s\nAbhidhammatthasaṅgaha (Compendium of the Topics of\nAbhidhamma, twelfth century CE). The Sarvāstivāda\ntradition preserves in Chinese translation three different recensions\nof an authoritative Abhidharma commentary or\nvibhāṣā dated to the first or second century\nCE, the last and best known of which is called the\nMahāvibhāṣā. The\nvibhāṣā compendia document several centuries\nof scholarly activity representing multiple Sarvāstivāda\nbranches, most notably the Sarvāstivādins of Kashmir who are\nknown as Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika. The\nSarvāstivāda manual most influential for later Chinese and\nTibetan Buddhism, however, is Vasubandhu’s\nAbhidharmakośa (Treasury of Abhidharma, fifth\ncentury CE). The Abhidharmakośa’s auto-commentary\ncontains substantial criticism of orthodox Sarvāstivāda\npositions, which later Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika\nmasters attempted to refute. Particularly famous in this category is\nthe Nyāyānusāra (Conformance to Correct\nPrinciple) of Saṅghabhadra, a contemporary of Vasubandhu.\nThis comprehensive treatise reestablishes orthodox\nSarvāstivāda views and is considered one of the final\nSarvāstivāda works to have \nsurvived.[3] \n\nIn sum, the Abhidharma/Abhidhamma texts are by and large\ncompositions contemporary with the formative period in the history of\nthe early Buddhist schools, providing the means by which one group\ncould define itself and defend its position against the divergent\ninterpretations and criticisms of other parties. Although much of the\nAbhidharma mindset and something of its method draw on the\nĀgamas/Nikāyas, i.e., the collections of sūtras\n(Pali, suttas), the main body of its literature contains\ninterpretations of the Buddha’s discourses specific to each\nschool of thought and philosophical elaborations of selectively\nemphasized doctrinal issues. These continued to be refined by\nsubsequent generations of monks who contributed to the consolidation of\nthe two surviving Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda\nschools. \n\nScholarly opinion has generally been divided between two alternative\ninterpretations of the term abhidharma, both of which hinge\nupon the denotation of the prefix abhi. First, taking\nabhi in the sense of “with regard to,”\nabhidharma is understood as a discipline whose subject matter\nis the Dharma, the Buddha’s teachings. Second, using\nabhi in the sense of preponderance and distinction,\nabhidharma has also been deemed a distinct, higher teaching;\nthe essence of the Buddha’s teachings or that which goes beyond\nwhat is given in the Buddha’s discourses, in a sense somewhat\nreminiscent of the term “metaphysics” (e.g., Dhs-a\n2–3; Horner 1941; von Hinüber 1994). Buddhist tradition\nitself differentiates between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma\nmethods of instructing the teachings by contrasting the\nSūtrānta “way of putting things” in partial,\nfigurative terms that require further clarification, versus the\nAbhidharma exposition and catechism that expound the teachings fully,\nin non-figurative terms (A IV 449–456; Dhs-a\n154). This coincides with additional distinctions the tradition makes\nbetween texts that have implicit meaning (Skt., neyārtha,\nPali, neyyattha) versus those that have explicit meaning\n(Skt., nītārtha, Pali nītattha)\n(A I 60; Ps I 18), and texts that are expressed in\nconventional terms (Skt., saṃvṛti, Pali,\nsammuti) versus others that are expressed in ultimate terms\n(Skt., paramārtha, Pali, paramattha)\n(Vibh 100–101; Mp I\n 94–97).[4]\nFrom Abhidharma\nperspective, the sūtras were conveyed in conventional\nterms whose ultimate meaning required further interpretation. \n\nThe texts of the canonical Abhidharma are works that evolved over\ndecades, if not centuries, out of materials already present in the\nSūtra and Vinaya portions of the canon. This is evidenced in two\ncharacteristics of the genre that can be traced to earlier Buddhist\nliterature. The first is the analytical style of the texts, which\nattempt to summarize meticulously the significant points of the Dharma\nand provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the mental and physical factors\nthat constitute sentient experience. This analytical enterprise\nincludes the arrangement of major parts of the material around\ndetailed lists of factors and combinations of sets of their categories\nyielding matrices (Skt., mātṛkā, Pali,\nmātikā) of doctrinal topics. Already in the\ncollections of the Buddha’s discourses, certain texts are\narranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment of\ndoctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Lists were clearly\npowerful mnemonic devices, and their prevalence in early Buddhist\nliterature can be explained partly as a consequence of its being\ncomposed and for some centuries preserved\n orally.[5]\nFor instance, one of the four\nprimary Āgamas/Nikāyas, the collection of\n“grouped” sayings (saṃyukta/saṃyutta),\ngroups the Buddha’s teachings according to specific topics,\nincluding the four noble truths, the four ways of establishing\nmindfulness, the five aggregates, the six sense faculties, the seven\nconstituents of awakening, the noble eightfold path, the twelve links\nof dependent origination, and others. Similar taxonomic lists form the\ntable of contents of the Vibhaṅga and\nPuggalapaññatti of the Theravāda and the\nSaṅgītiparyāya and Dharmaskandha of\nthe Sarvāstivāda, which are structured as commentaries on\nthose lists. \n\nThe second characteristic of Abhidharma literature is its bent for\ndiscursive hermeneutics through catechetical exposition. The texts seem\nto be the products of discussions about the doctrine within the early\nBuddhist community. Again, such discussions are already found in the\nĀgama/Nikāya collections (e.g., M I 292–305, III\n202–257): they often begin with a doctrinal point to be clarified and\nproceed to expound the topic at stake using a pedagogical method of\nquestion and answer. The texts also record more formal methods of\nargumentation and refutation of rival theories that shed light on the\nevolution of the Abhidharma as responding to the demands of an\nincreasingly polemical environment. The process of institutionalization\nundergone by Buddhist thought at the time and the spread of the\nBuddhist community across the Indian subcontinent coincided with a\ntransition from oral to written methods of textual transmission and\nwith the rise of monastic debates concerning the doctrine among the\nvarious Buddhist schools. Intellectual assimilation and doctrinal\ndisputes also existed between the Buddhist monastic community and the\ncontemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and Brahmanical\nschools with their evolving scholastic and analytical movements, which\nmust also have contributed to the Abdhidharma discursive hermeneutics\nand argumentative style. The dialectic format and the display of\nawareness of differences in doctrinal interpretation are the hallmarks\nof the Kathāvatthu and the\nVijñānakāya. Later on, post-canonical\nAbhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing\nsophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations\nthat resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their\ncanonical antecedents. \n\nAbhidharma literature, then, arose from two approaches to discussing\nthe Dharma within the early Buddhist community: the first intended to\nsummarize and analyze the significant points of the Buddha’s\nteachings, the second to elaborate on and interpret the doctrines by\nmeans of monastic disputations (Cousins 1983, 10; Gethin 1992b,\n165). \n\nThe Buddha’s discourses collected in the\nĀgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different\nstandpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa),\nthe five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the\ntwelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense\nelements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide\ndescriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and\nmental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and\nconditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and\nthe Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale\nof these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to\nmoment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which\nthe sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to\ndiscrete, momentary events (Cousins 1983, 7; Ronkin 2005, 66–78). \n\nThese events are referred to as dharmas (Pali,\ndhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma\nthat signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The\nĀgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a\npluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory\nphenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six\nsense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind\n[manas]). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw\nsubtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the\ndifferences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within\nthis context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific\nmental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt.,\nmanovijñāṇa, Pali,\nmanoviññāṇa) that is considered the\ncentral cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception.\nMental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that\ndiscerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and\nthat emerges when the requisite conditions come together.\nDharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or\nmemories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness,\ndharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid\nconsciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential\nstreams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five\nexternally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of\ncognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray\ndharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse\ncapacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a\nparticular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set\nor mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and\nconceptualizing\n it.[6] \n\nUltimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential\nevents are understood as arising from the interaction of\ndharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here,\ndharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena,\nand are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or\ndynamic properties rather than enduring\n substances.[7]\nThe Abhidharma exegesis thus\nattempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of\nexperience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present\nitself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent\ndharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of\nordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas\nand clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching\ninquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple\ncategories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of\ntheir manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as\nthe “dharma theory.” \n\nThe Abhidharma attempts to individuate and determine the unique\nidentity of each dharma yield complex intersecting taxonomies\nof dharmas organized by multiple criteria or sets of\nqualities. Abhidharma texts of different schools proposed different\ndharma taxonomies, enumerating a more or less finite number of\ndharma categories. It is important to remember, though, that\nthe term dharma signifies both any category that represents a\ntype of occurrence as well as any of its particular tokens or\ninstances. The Theravāda introduced a system of eighty-two\ndhamma categories, meaning that there are eighty-two possible\ntypes of occurrence in the experiential world, not eighty-two\noccurrences. These are organized into a fourfold categorization. The\nfirst three categories include the bare phenomenon of consciousness\n(citta) that encompasses a single dhamma type and of\nwhich the essential characteristic is the cognizing of an object;\nassociated mentality (cetasika) that encompasses fifty-two\ndhammas; and materiality or physical phenomena\n(rūpa) that include twenty-eight dhammas that\nmake up all physical occurrences (Abhidh-av 1). All the\neighty-one dhamma types in these three broad categories are\nconditioned (saṅkhata). Conditioned dhammas\narise and cease subject to numerous causes and conditions and\nconstitute sentient experience in all realms of the round of rebirth\n (saṃsāra).[8]\nThe eighty-second dhamma that\ncomprises the fourth category is unconditioned\n(asaṅkhata): it neither arises nor ceases through causal\ninteraction. The single occurrence in this fourth category is nirvana\n(Pali, nibbāna). \n\nThe Sarvāstivāda adopted a system of seventy-five basic\ntypes of dharmas organized into a fivefold categorization. The\nfirst four categories comprise all conditioned\n(saṃskṛta) dharmas and include, again,\nconsciousness (citta, one single dharma); associated\nmentality (caitta, encompasses forty-six dharmas);\nand physical phenomena (rūpa, eleven dharmas);\nbut also factors dissociated from thought\n(cittaviprayuktasaṃskāra, fourteen\ndharmas). The last category is mentioned neither in the\nsūtras nor in the Theravāda lists, but is found\npredominantly in northern Indian Abhidharma texts of all periods. The\nspecific dharmas included within it vary, but they are all\nunderstood as explaining a range of experiential events, being\nthemselves dissociated from both material form and thought. The fifth\ncategory in the Sarvāstivāda taxonomy, that of the\nunconditioned (asaṃskṛta), comprises three\ndharmas, namely, space and two states of cessation\n(nirodha), the latter being a term that connotes the\nculmination of the Buddhist path (Cox 1995; 2004A, 553–554). \n\nThe Abhidharma analyzes in great detail each of these categories,\nthus creating relational schemata whereby each acknowledged experience,\nphenomenon, or occurrence can be determined and identified by\nparticular definition and function. Especially important is the\nanalysis of consciousness or citta, on which much of\nAbhidharma doctrinal thought is built. Consider the Theravāda\nanalysis of consciousness, whose basic principles are shared with the\nother Abhidharma systems. \n\nThe epitome of the operation of consciousness is citta as\nexperienced in the process of sensory perception that, in Abhidharma\n(as in Buddhism in general), is deemed the paradigm of sentient\nexperience. Citta can never be experienced as bare\nconsciousness in its own origination moment, for consciousness is\nalways intentional, directed to a particular object that is cognized\nby means of certain mental factors. Citta, therefore, always\noccurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental\nfactors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease\ntogether with it, having the same object (either sensuous or mental)\nand grounded in the same sense faculty. Any given consciousness\nmoment—also signified by the very term citta—is\nthus a unique assemblage of citta and its associated mental\nfactors such as feeling, conceptualization, volition, or attention, to\nname several of those required in any thought process. Each assemblage\nis conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then\nfalls away, followed by another citta combination that picks\nup a different object by means of its particular associated mental\nfactors. \n\nThe classic Abhidhamma scheme as gleaned from the first book of the\nAbhidhamma-piṭaka, the\nDhammasaṅgaṇi, and as organized by the\ncommentarial tradition describes eighty-nine basic types of\nconsciousness moments, i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncetasika (Dhs Book I; Vism XIV 81–110;\nAbhidh-av 1–15; Abhidh-s 1–5). It\nclassifies these basic citta types most broadly according to\ntheir locus of occurrence, beginning with the sense-sphere\n(kāmāvacara) that includes forty-five citta\ntypes, most prominently those that concern the mechanics of perception\nof sensuous objects; next come eighteen form-sphere\n(rūpāvacara) consciousnesses that concern the mind\nthat has attained meditative absorption (jhāna);\nfollowed by eight formless-sphere\n(arūpāvacara) consciousnesses that constitute the\nmind that has reached further meditative attainments known as formless\nstates; finally, there are eighteen world-transcending\n(lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the\nmoment of awakening itself: these have nirvana as their object. Within\nthese four broad categories many other classifications operate. For\ninstance, some dhammas are wholesome, others unwholesome; some\nare resultant, others are not; some are motivated, others are without\nmotivations. These attribute matrices, writes Cox (2004A, 552), form\n“an abstract web of all possible conditions and characteristics\nexhibited by actually occurring dharmas. The individual\ncharacter of any particular dharma can then be specified in\naccordance with every taxonomic possibility, resulting in a complete\nassessment of that dharma’s range of possible\noccurrences.” \n\nVarious scholars have argued that this system reflects a dynamic\nconception of dharmas: that Abhidharma understands\ndharmas as properties, activities, or patterns of\ninterconnection that construct one’s world, not as static substances\n(e.g., Cox 2004A, 549ff; Gethin 1992A, 149–150; Karunadasa 2010,\nCh. 4; Nyanaponika 1998, Ch. 2 & 4; Ronkin 2005, Ch. 4; Waldron\n2002, 2–16). The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are\n“explicitly open” and reflect “a certain reluctance\nand hesitancy to say categorically that such and such is the\ndefinitive list of dharmas” (Gethin 2017, 252), leaving room for\ncontinued debates about what is and is not a dharma.  For the\nAbhidharma, as for Buddhism in general, the limits of one’s world are\nset by the limits of one’s lived experience, and the causal foundation\nfor lived experience is the operation of one’s cognitive\napparatus. According to the Buddhist path, the nature of lived\nexperience as based on one’s cognitive apparatus is to be contemplated\nby investigating the very nature of one’s mind through the practice of\nmeditation. From this perspective, Abhidharma represents the\ntheoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation.  Within this\ncontext of Buddhist practice, dharmas are distinct (but\ninterrelated) functions, energies, or causally significant\naspects—in this sense “components”—of\nconsciousness moments. \n\nThe categorial analysis of dharmas is therefore a\nmeditative practice of discernment of dharmas: it is\nnot intended as a closed inventory of all existing dharmas\n“out there” in their totality, but rather “has a dual\nsoteriological purpose involving two simultaneous processes” (Cox\n2004A, 551). First, as “evaluative” analysis, the\ndharma typology maps out the constituents and workings of the\nmind and accounts for what makes up ordinary wholesome consciousness as\nopposed to the awakened mind. For instance, consciousness types that\narise in a mind that has attained meditative absorption become\nincreasingly refined and may never involve certain tendencies or\ndefilements that might potentially occur in ordinary (even wholesome)\nconsciousness. To watch dharmas as dharmas, writes\nGethin (2004, 536), “involves watching how they arise and\ndisappear, how the particular qualities that one wants to abandon can\nbe abandoned, and how the particular qualities that one wants to\ndevelop can be developed. Watching dhammas in this way one\nbegins to understand […] certain truths\n(sacca)—four to be exact—about these\ndhammas: their relation to suffering, its arising, its ceasing\nand the way to its ceasing. And in seeing these four truths one\nrealizes the ultimate truth—dhamma—about\nthe\n world.”[9] \n\nThe second, “descriptive” soteriological process\ninvolved in the categorization of dharmas reveals the fluid\nnature of sentient experience and validates the fundamental Buddhist\nteaching of not-self (Skt., anātman, Pali,\nanatta). The increasingly detailed enumerations of\ndharmas demonstrate that no essence or independent self could\nbe found in any phenomenon or its constituents, since all aspects of\nexperience are impermanent, arising and passing away subject to\nnumerous causes and conditions. Even the handful dharmas that\nare categorized as unconditioned (that is, having no cause and no\neffect) are shown to be not-self. The practice of the discrimination of\ndharmas thus undermines the apparently solid world we\nemotionally and intellectually grasp at that is replete with objects of\ndesire and attachment. “Try to grasp the world of the\nDhammasaṅgaṇi, or the\nPaṭṭhāna,” Gethin notes (1992B, 165),\n“and it runs through one’s fingers.” \n\nNevertheless, the very notion of the plurality of dharmas\nas the building blocks or the final units of analysis of sentient\nexperience signifies a considerable shift in the Buddhist understanding\nof dharma. Abhidharma thought was gradually drawn into\nespousing a naturalistic explanation of dharmas as the\nfundamental constituents of the phenomenal world, increasingly\nassociating dharmas as primary existents. The category of the\nunconditioned within the dharma taxonomy also asserted the\npossibility of enduring or permanent dharmas, in contrast to\nall other dharmas that arise and cease through causal\ninteraction. The Abhidharma exegesis, then, occasioned among Buddhist\ncircles doctrinal controversies that could be termed ontological around\nsuch issues as what the nature of a dharma is; what, in the\ninternal constitution of a dharma, makes it the very\nparticular it is; the manner of existence of dharmas; the\ndynamics of their causal interaction; and the nature of the reality\nthey constitute. The distinctive principles and their ensuing\nontological interpretations constructed by the Buddhist schools were\nlargely shaped by a radical construal of impermanence as\nmomentariness. \n\nBoth the Sarvāstivāda and the post-canonical\nTheravāda constructed a radical doctrine of momentariness (Skt.,\nkṣāṇavāda, Pali,\nkhāṇavāda) that atomizes phenomena temporally\nby dissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events that\npass out of existence as soon as they have originated. Albeit not a\ntopic in its own right in the Buddha’s discourses, the doctrine\nof momentariness appears to have originated in conjunction with the\nprinciple of impermanence (Skt., anitya, Pali,\nanicca). This idea is basic to the Buddha’s\nempirically-oriented teaching about the nature of sentient experience:\nall physical and mental phenomena are in a constant process of\nconditioned construction and are interconnected, being dependently\noriginated (e.g., A I 286; M I 230, 336, 500;\nS II 26, III 24–5, 96–9, IV 214). The Suttanta\nelaboration on these three interlocking ideas results in a formula\n(A I 152) that states that conditioned phenomena (Skt.,\nsaṃskārā, Pali,\nsaṅkhārā) are of the nature of origination\n(uppāda), “change of what endures”\n(ṭhitassa aññathatta), and dissolution or\ncessation (vaya). This formula is known as the “three\ncharacteristics of what is conditioned”\n(tisaṅkhatalakkhaṇa). The\nSarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika introduced four\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena: origination, endurance,\ndecay, and dissolution. These are classified under the dharma\ncategory of “factors dissociated from thought.” \n\nThe Buddhist schools used the characteristics of conditioned\nphenomena as a hermeneutic tool with which to reinterpret impermanence\nin terms of momentariness. The\nSarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika proposed a fully-fledged\ndoctrine of momentariness according to which all physical and mental\nphenomena are momentary. The Sarvāstivādins use the term\n“moment” (kṣaṇa) in a highly technical\nsense as the smallest, definite unit of time that cannot be subdivided,\nthe length of which came to be equated with the duration of mental\nevents as the briefest conceivable entities. There is no\nSarvāstivādin consensus on the length of a moment, but the\ntexts indicate figures between 0.13 and 13 milliseconds in modern terms\n(Gethin 1998, 221; von Rospatt 1995, 94–110). This usage presupposes an\natomistic conception of time, for time is not reckoned indefinitely\ndivisible. Indeed, the term kṣaṇa is often\ndiscussed in juxtaposition to the concepts of material atoms and\nsyllables, which are likewise comprehended as indivisible. \n\nWithin the Sarvāstivāda framework, material reality\n(rūpa-dharma) is reduced to discrete momentary\natoms, and much attention is drawn to ontological and\nepistemological questions such as whether sense objects are real at any\ntime, or whether atoms contribute separately or collectively to the\ngeneration of perception. Atomic reality is understood as constantly\nchanging: what appears to us as a world made up of enduring substances\nwith changing qualities is, in fact, a series of moments that arise and\nperish in rapid succession. This process is not random, but operates in\naccordance with the specific capability and function of each atom. The\nspirit of this atomistic analysis of material reality applies equally\nto mental reality: consciousness is understood as a succession of\ndiscrete consciousness moments that arise and cease\nextremely\n rapidly.[10]\nThus,\nthe ratio of change between material and mental phenomena in any given\nmoment is one to one: they occur in perfect synchronicity (Kim 1999,\n54). On this point the Sautrāntika agreed with the\nSarvāstivāda. \n\nThe Sarvāstivādins (“advocates of the doctrine that\nall things exist”) were unique in their stance that the\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena exist separately as real\nentities within each moment. Their claim, then, is that all conditioned\ndharmas—whether past, present, or future—exist as\nreal entities (dravyatas) within the span of any given moment.\nThis induced a host of problems, one of which is that the\nSarvāstivāda definition of a moment is difficult to reconcile\nwith its conception as the shortest unit of time (von Rospatt 1995,\n44–46 & 97–98). The Sarvāstivāda replies to\nthis criticism by stating that the activities (kāritra)\nof the four characteristics of conditioned phenomena are sequential:\nthe limits between the birth and dissolution of any event are referred\nto as one moment. This solution, however, implies that a single event\nundergoes four phases within a given moment, which inevitably infringes\nupon its momentariness (Cox 1995, 151; von Rospatt 1995, 52ff). \n\nThe Theravādins created their own distinct version of the\ndoctrine of momentariness. They do not seem to have been as concerned\nas the Sarvāstivādins with the ontology and epistemology of\nmaterial and mental realities per se. Rather, they were more\npreoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of\ncognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between\nmaterial and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical\nAbhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the\nterm “moment” (khaṇa) in the sense of a very\nbrief stretch of time that is divided into origination and cessation\ninstants (Kim 1999, 60–61). Relying on the three characteristics\nof conditioned phenomena, the Pali commentaries later present a scheme\nwherein each moment of every phenomenon is subdivided into three\ndifferent instants of origination (uppādakkhaṇa),\nendurance (ṭhitikkhaṇa) and cessation\n(bhaṅgakkhaṇa)\n(Spk II 266; Mp II 252). These are three phases of a\nsingle momentary phenomenon defined as one single dhamma or\nconsciousness moment. A dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment,\nendures in the second, and ceases in the third (Karunadasa 2010, 234ff). The commentarial\ntradition thus analyzes phenomena temporally by dissecting them into a\nsuccession of discrete, momentary events that fall away as soon as they\nhave originated in consciousness. As one event is exhausted, it\nconditions a new event of its kind that proceeds immediately\nafterwards. The result is an uninterrupted, flowing continuum\n(santāna) of causally connected momentary events. These\nsucceed each other so fast that we conceive of the phenomena they\nconstitute as temporally extended. \n\nThe Theravādins use the term khaṇa as the\nexpression for a brief instant, the dimension of which is not fixed but\nmay be determined by the context. For example,\ncittakkhaṇa refers to the instant\ntaken by one mental event. In this basic sense as denoting a very brief\nstretch of time, the term “moment” does not entail an\natomistic conception of a definite and ultimate, smallest unit of time,\nbut leaves open the possibility that time is infinitely divisible (von\nRospatt 1995, 59–60 & 94–95). Here the three moments of\norigination, endurance, and cessation do not correspond to three\ndifferent entities. Rather, they represent three phases of a single\nmomentary phenomenon and are defined as one single consciousness\nmoment: a dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second sub-moment and perishes in the third one. In this way, the\nTheravādins avoided some of the difficulties faced by the\nSarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣikas, of how to compress the\ncharacteristics of the conditioned into one single indivisible moment\nand of how to account for their ontological status. The\nTheravādins also claimed that only mental phenomena are momentary,\nwhereas material phenomena (e.g., common-sense objects) endure for a\nstretch of time. The Theravādin commentarial tradition\nsubsequently elaborated on this proposition and produced a unique view\nof the ratio between material and mental phenomena, asserting that a\nmaterial phenomenon lasts for sixteen or seventeen consciousness\nmoments (Kv 620; Vibh-a 25–28; Vism XX\n24–26; Kim 1999, 79–80 & §3.1). \n\nDespite their different interpretations of the concept of\nmomentariness, the early Buddhist schools all derived this concept from\nthe analysis of impermanence in terms of the dynamics of\ndharmas qua physical and mental events. The equation of a\nmoment with the duration of these transient events as extremely short\noccurrences—even the shortest conceivable—led to the direct\ndetermination of the moment in terms of these occurrences. Yet the\ndoctrine of momentariness spawned a host of problems for the Buddhist\nschools, particularly with regard to the status of the endurance moment\nand to the explanation of continuity and conditioning interaction among\nthe dharmas (see section 5 below). If dharmas go\nthrough an endurance phase or exist as real entities within the span of\nany given moment, how can they be momentary? And if experience is an\narray of strictly momentary dharmas, how can continuity and\ncausal conditioning be possible? \n\nOne might argue that the conceptual shift from\n“impermanence” to “endurance” is a result of\nscholastic literalism and testifies to the Abhidharma tendency towards\nreification and hypostatization of dharmas (Gombrich 1996,\n36–37, 96–97 & 106–107). Nevertheless, the object of the doctrine\nof momentariness is not so much existence in time or the passage of\ntime per se, but rather, in epistemological terms and a somewhat\nBergsonian sense, the construction of temporal experience. Instead of a\ntranscendental matrix of order imposed on natural events from without,\ntime is seen as an inherent feature of the operation of\ndharmas. The doctrine of momentariness analyzes\ndharmas as they transpire through time: as psycho-physical\nevents that arise and cease in consciousness and, by the dynamics of\ntheir rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of the three times is\ntherefore secondary, generated in and by the process of conditioned and\nconditioning dharmas. In fact, the conceptual shift from the\nprinciple of impermanence to the theory of momentariness is a shift in\ntime scales. While the Sūtrānta worldview interprets the\nthree times as referring to past, present, and future lives, the\nAbhidharma sees them as phases that any conditioned dharma\nundergoes each and every moment. Impermanence marks dharmas\nover a period of time, but is also encapsulated in every single\nconsciousness moment (Vibh-a 7–8; Sv 991; Vism\nXIV 191; Collins 1992, 227). \n\nTo preserve the principle of impermanence and explain continuity and\ncausal conditioning in ordinary experience, the Buddhist schools\nintroduced novel interpretations of the nature of dharmas. At\nthe heart of these interpretations is the concept of intrinsic nature\n(Skt., svabhāva, Pali, sabhāva) that plays\na major role in the systematization of Abhidharma thought, is closely\nrelated to the consolidation of the dharma theory, and is\nregarded as that which gave an impetus to the Abhidharma growing\nconcern with ontology. \n\nThe term svabhāva/sabhāva does not feature in\nthe sūtras/suttas and its rare mentions in other\nSarvāstivāda and Theravāda canonical texts offer no\naccount of dharma as defined by a fixed intrinsic nature that\nverifies its real\n existence.[11]\nThis situation changes significantly in the\npost-canonical literature, in which svabhāva becomes a\nstandard concept extensively used in dharma exegesis. A\nrecurring idea in the exegetical Abhidharma literature from the period\nof the early vibhāṣā compendia onward is that\ndharmas are defined by virtue of their svabhāva.\nFor instance, a definition transmitted in the\nAbhidharmakośabhāṣya reads:\n“dharma means ‘upholding,’ [namely],\nupholding intrinsic nature (svabhāva),” and the\nMahāvibhāṣā states that “intrinsic\nnature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it […] as\nin the case of unconditioned dharmas that are able to uphold\ntheir own identity” (Cox 2004A, 558–559). Similarly, a definition\nprevalent in Theravādin Abhidhamma commentaries is:\n“dhammas are so called because they bear their intrinsic\nnatures, or because they are borne by causal conditions” (e.g.,\nDhs-a 39-40; Paṭis-a I 18;\nVism-mhṭ I 347). The commentaries also regularly equate\ndhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms\ndhamma and sabhāva interchangeably. For example,\nthe Visuddhimagga proclaims that “dhamma means\nbut intrinsic nature” (Vism VIII 246), and the\nsub-commentary to the Dhammasaṅgaṇi indicates that\n“there is no other thing called dhamma apart from the\nintrinsic nature borne by it” and that “the term\nsabhāva denotes the mere fact of being a\ndhamma” (Dhs-mṭ 28 & 94; see also\nKarunadasa 2010: Ch. 1). \n\nThese commentarial definitions of dharmas as carrying their\nintrinsic natures should not be interpreted ontologically as implying\nthat dharmas are substances having inherent existence.\nThe Pali commentaries, cautions Gethin (2004, 533), “are often\nviewed too much in the light of later controversies about the precise\nontological status of dharmas and the Madhyamaka critique of\nthe notion of svabhāva in the sense of ‘inherent\nexistence.’” In fact, defining dharmas as bearing\ntheir intrinsic natures conveys the idea that there is no enduring\nagent behind them. Adding that dharmas are borne by causal\nconditions counters the idea of intrinsic natures borne by underlying\nsubstances distinct from themselves. Just as dharmas are\npsycho-physical events that occur dependently on appropriate conditions\nand qualities, their intrinsic natures arise dependently on other\nconditions and qualities rather than on a substratum more real than\nthey are (ibid; Karunadasa 1996, 13–16; Nyanaponika 1998,\n40–41). \n\nWe must also note that the context within which dharmas are\nrendered in terms of their intrinsic natures is that of categorization,\nwhere multiple criteria and qualities are applied to create a\ncomprehensive taxonomic system that distinguishes the particular\ncharacter of any given dharma. Cox (2004A: 559–561) has shown\nthat in the early period of northern Indian Abhidharma texts, as\nrepresented by the\nŚāriputrābhidharmaśāstra and portions\nof the Mahāvibhāṣā, the concept of\nintrinsic nature develops within the context of the method of inclusion\n(saṃgraha), that is, the process by which the inclusion\nof dharmas within a specific category is to be applied.\nDharmas are determined (pariniṣpanna) by the\nintrinsic nature that defines them and hence should not be considered\nto possess a separately existing intrinsic nature.\n“‘Determination’ implies two further features of\ndharmas […] First, just as categories in a\nwell-structured taxonomic schema are distinct and not subject to\nfluctuation, so also dharmas, as ‘determined,’ are\nclearly and unalterably discriminated: they are uniquely individualized\nand as such are not subject to confusion with other dharmas.\n[Second,] determination by intrinsic nature undergoes no variation or\nmodification, and hence, dharmas, which are in effect types or\ncategories of intrinsic nature, are established as stable and\nimmutable” (ibid, 562). In the early\nSarvāstivāda exegetical texts, then, svabhāva\nis used as an atemporal, invariable criterion determining what\na dharma is, not necessarily that a dharma\nexists. The concern here is primarily with what makes categorial types\nof dharma unique, rather than with the ontological status of\ndharmas. \n\nNevertheless, from the foregoing categorial theory, the mature\nAbhidharma drew ontological conclusions with regard to the reality of\ndharmas. This transition in the conception of dharma\ncoincided with an inherent ambiguity in the term\nsvabhāva, which is grounded logically and etymologically\nin the term bhāva that came to denote “mode of\nexistence” (ibid, 565–568). In the\nvibhāṣā compendia and contemporaneous texts,\n“the explicit emphasis upon categorization per se\nrecedes in importance as the focus shifts to clarifying the character\nand eventually the ontological status of individual dharmas.\nAccordingly, the term svabhāva acquires the dominant\nsense of ‘intrinsic nature’ specifying individual\ndharmas […] And determining individual dharmas\nthrough unique intrinsic nature also entails affirming their existence,\nas a natural function both of the etymological sense of the term\nsvabhāva and of the role of dharmas as the\nfundamental constituents of experience. This then leads to the\nprominence of a new term that expressed this ontological focus: namely,\ndravya” (ibid, 569). Dravya means\n“real existence” and, within the Sarvāstivāda\nframework, dharmas that are determined by intrinsic nature\nexist as real entities (dravyatas), as opposed both to\ncomposite objects of ordinary experience that exist provisionally and\nto relative concepts or contingencies of time and place that exist\nrelatively. The presence of intrinsic nature indicates that a\ndharma is a primary existent, irrespective of its\ntemporal status, namely, whether it is a past, present or future\ndharma, and hence the Sarvāstivāda declaration that\n“all things exist.” \n\nThe Theravāda rejected the Sarvāstivāda ontological\nmodel, claiming that dhammas exist only in the present. But\nthe Theravāda Abhidhamma shares with the Sarvāstivāda\nthe same principles of dhamma analysis as a categorial theory\nthat individuates sentient experience. Here, too, the taxonomic\nfunction of sabhāva gave rise to ontological connotations\nof existence in the characterization of dhammas. As the final\nunits of Abhidhamma analysis, dhammas are reckoned the\nultimate constituents of experience. “There is nothing else,\nwhether a being, or an entity, or a man or a person,” a famous\nPali commentarial excerpt proclaims (Dhs-a\n 155).[12]\nWhile this\nstatement is meant to refute the rival Pudgalavāda position of the\nreality of the person by insisting that there is no being or person\napart from dhammas, there emerges the idea that the phenomenal\nworld is, at bottom, a world of dhammas: that within the\nconfines of sentient experience there is no other actuality apart from\ndhammas and that what constitutes any given dhamma as\na discrete, individualized particular is its intrinsic nature. The\nTheravāda elaborates on the concept of sabhāva in\njuxtaposition to its theory of momentariness, and it acquires the sense\nof what underlies a dhamma’s endurance moment and as a\npoint of reference to the moments of origination and cessation. Before\na dhamma eventuates it does not yet obtain an intrinsic nature\nand when it ceases it is denuded of this intrinsic nature. As a present\noccurrence, though, while possessing its intrinsic nature, it\nexists as an ultimate reality and its intrinsic nature is evidence of\nits actual existence as such (Dhs-a 45; Vism VIII\n234, XV 15). One commentarial passage even goes so far as naming this\ninstant “the acquisition of a self”\n(Vism-mhṭ I 343). \n\nThe Abhidharma’s ontological investigations occasioned a host\nof doctrinal problems that became the subject of an ongoing debate among\nthe Buddhist schools. One primary controversy centered on the principle\nof impermanence: if all phenomena are impermanent, the Sautrāntika\nchallenged the Sarvāstivāda and the Theravāda, then\ndharmas must be changing continuously and can neither exist in\nthe past and future nor endure for any period of time, however short,\nin the present. On the other hand, the systematic analysis of\nexperience in terms of momentary dharmas required the\nAbhidharma to provide a rigorous account of the processes that govern\npsychological and physical continuity. What fuels these processes is\ncausal interaction, but the very notion of causation is allegedly\ncompromised by the theory of momentariness. If causes, conditions, and\ntheir results are all momentary events, how can an event that has ended\nhave a result? How can an event that undergoes distinct stages of\norigination, endurance, and cessation in a brief moment have causal\nefficacy? Notwithstanding their doctrinal differences, both the\nSarvāstivāda and the Theravāda Abhidhamma had to\nconfront these challenges, and they did so by formulating complex\ntheories of immediate contiguity that grant causal efficacy. \n\nThe Sarvāstivāda developed an analysis of causal\nconditioning in terms of intricate interrelations among four types of\ncondition (pratyaya) and six types of cause (hetu).\nAs documented in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (AKB\n2.49) based on canonical texts including the\nVijñānakāya, the\nPrakaraṇapāda, and the\nJñānaprasthāna, the four conditions are: 1)\nroot cause (literally “cause as condition,”\nhetupratyaya), reckoned the foremost in inciting the process\nof fruition and origination; 2) immediate antecedent, which holds\nbetween a consciousness moment and its immediately preceding moment in\nthat consciousness series; 3) object support, which applies to all\ndharmas insofar as they are intentional objects of\nconsciousness; and 4) predominance, which facilitates sensory\ndiscriminative awareness, e.g., the faculty of sight’s\npredominance over visual cognitive awareness. The six causes are: 1)\ninstrumentality (kāraṇahetu), deemed the primary\nfactor in the production of a result; 2) simultaneity or coexistence,\nwhich connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity,\nexplaining the homogenous flow of dharmas that evokes the\nseeming continuity of phenomena; 4) association, which operates only\nbetween mental dharmas and explains why the elements of\nconsciousness always appear as assemblages of mental factors; 5)\ndominance, which forms one’s habitual cognitive and behaviorist\ndispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the result of\nactively wholesome or unwholesome dharmas. The four conditions\nand six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal\nexperience: for instance, each consciousness moment acts both as the\nhomogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent condition of the\nrise of consciousness and its concomitants in a subsequent\n moment.[13] \n\nUnderlying this analysis of causal conditioning is the notion of\nexistence as efficacious action, or karma. Karma, a fundamental\nprinciple in Buddhist thought from its inception, is what fuels the\nrepetitive experience in saṃsāra, the round\nof\n rebirth.[14]\nIn\nAbhidharma exegesis, the efficacious action or distinctive functioning\nof dharmas is understood predominantly as causal functioning.\nFor the orthodox Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika, the\nexistence of dharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is\ndetermined by both their intrinsic nature and particular causal\nfunctioning. Intrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of\nreal existence. What determines a dharma’s\nspatio-temporal existence is its distinctive causal functioning:\npast and future dharmas have capability\n(sāmarthya) of functioning, while present\ndharmas also exert a distinctive activity\n(kāritra). Present activity is an internal causal\nefficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a\ndharma’s own consciousness series. It is this activity\nthat determines a dharma’s present existence and defines\nthe limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by contrast,\nis a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards another\nconsciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists another\ndharma in the production of its own effect (Cox 2004A, 570–573;\nWilliams 1981, 240–243). A dharma’s present\nactivity arises and falls away, but past and future dharmas\nall have potential for causal functioning and exist as real entities\ndue to their intrinsic nature. For the Sarvāstivāda, this\nmodel—which insists on constant change within the limits of the\npresent moment and implies the existence of dharmas in the\nthree time periods—preserves both the principle of impermanence\nyet explains continuity and causal efficacy. \n\nThe Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika distinction between\na dharma’s activity and capability implies that each\ndharma or consciousness moment effects the next moment within\nits series, but it can also act as a contributory condition towards\nproducing a different sort of effect. Activity engenders the next\nmoment within a dharma’s series, while capability\ngenerates a different effect and explains the causal efficacy of past\ndharmas. Williams (1981, 246–247) helpfully notes that\nwe may render this “horizontal” and “vertical”\ncausality, within a consciousness series and transcending it\nrespectively. For example, an instant of visual awareness horizontally\nproduces the next moment of visual awareness and may or may not,\ndepending on other factors such as light and so on, vertically produce\nvision of the object. “It follows that to be present is to have\nhorizontal causality, which may or may not include vertical\ncausality—a fact which serves to remind us that we are dealing\nhere with primary existents which are frequently positioned within the\nsystem in terms of what they do” (ibid). Thus activity\nor horizontal causality—a dharma’s function of\nprecipitating the next moment of its own consciousness\nseries—individuates that\ndharma as a particular event of its kind. A\ndharma’s capability or vertical causality, by which it\nfacilitates the occurrence of other dharmas outside its\nconsciousness series, locates it within the web of interrelations that\nconnects it with the incessant rise and fall of other\ndharmas, and hence further individuates it as that very\nparticular dharma by manifesting its unique quality and\nintensity of operation. \n\nThe Saturāntika and the Theravāda developed alternative\ntheories of causal conditioning in conjunction with their rejection of\nthe Sarvāstivāda ontological model and their claim that\ndharmas exist only in the present. The Sautrāntika\nexplained causal interaction among past and future dharmas by\nreference to the idea of “seeds” (bīja), or\nmodifications in subsequent dharma series. The\nSautrāntika theory of seeds is the precursor of two extremely\nimportant concepts of later Mahāyāna Buddhist thought,\nnamely, the Yogācāra’s concepts of “store\nconsciousness” (ālayavijñāna) and of\nBuddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha) (Cox 1995, 94-95; Gethin\n1998, 222). The Theravāda theory of causal conditioning, as set\nout in the Paṭṭhāna, proposes a set of\ntwenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) that account for\nall possible ways in which a phenomenon may function in conditioning\nthe rise of another phenomenon. The twenty-four conditional relations\nare: 1) root cause (hetupaccaya); 2) object support; 3)\npredominance; 4) proximity; 5) contiguity; 6) simultaneity; 7)\nreciprocity; 8) support; 9) decisive support; 10)\npre-existence 11) post-existence; 12) habitual\ncultivation; 13) karma; 14) fruition; 15) nutriment; 16) controlling\nfaculty; 17) jhāna – a relation specific to\nmeditation attainments; 18) path – a relation specific to the\nstages on the Buddhist path; 19) association; 20) dissociation; 21)\npresence; 22) absence; 23) disappearance; 24)\n non-disappearance.[15]\nThe majority of\nthe Theravāda twenty-four conditions have counterparts in the\nSarvāstivāda theory and both systems show various other\nparallel interests and points of resemblance. The likelihood, then, is\nthat the two systems originated before the two schools separated and\ncontinued to evolve after their separation (Conze 1962, 152–153;\nKalupahana 1961, 173). \n\nTheir differences notwithstanding, both the Sarvāstivāda\nand the Theravāda theories of causal conditioning are based on the\nnotions that dharmas are psycho-physical events that perform\nspecific functions, and that to define what a dhamma is\nrequires one to determine what it does (Gethin 1992A, 150). It turns\nout, then, that the relative positioning of each dharma within\na network of causes and conditions is, first and foremost, a means\nfor its individuation. Only in a subsidiary sense is\nthis network an analysis of causal efficacy. What reappears here is the\ncategorial dimension of the dharma analysis qua a metaphysical\ntheory of mental events in terms of sameness of conditional relations.\nAnalogous to the space-time coordinate system that enables one to\nidentify and describe material objects, the network of conditional\nrelations may be seen as a coordinate system that locates within it any\ngiven dharma, implying that to be a dharma is to be\nan event that has a place in that web of relations—an idea\nreminiscent of Donald Davidson’s principle of sameness of causes\nand effects as a condition of identity of events (2001 119–120\n& 154–161). Two dharma instances of the same type\nwould fit into the web of causal conditions in exactly the same way,\nbut would then be distinguished as individual instances on the grounds\nof their unique degrees and modes of causal efficacy. \n\nIn attempting to account for what effects liberating insight and\nwhat makes up the awakened mind, Abhidharma inquiries extended into the\nfield of epistemology. We have seen that the Abhidharma’s\nanalysis of sentient experience reveals that what we perceive as a\ntemporally extended, uninterrupted flow of phenomena is, in fact, a\nrapidly occurring sequence of causally connected consciousness moments\nor cittas (i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncaitta/cetasika), each with its particular object. The mature\nAbhidharma thus assimilates the analysis of\nphenomena-in-time-as-constituted-by-consciousness with a highly complex\ndescription of the consciousness process, dissolving the causal\nrelations between ordered successions of consciousness moments into the\nactivity of perception. As previously noted in section 2, for the\nAbhidharma, as in Buddhist epistemology in general, sensory perception\nis the paradigm of perceptual, sentient experience. Like every instance\nof consciousness, sensory perception is intentional, encapsulated in\nthe interaction among the sense faculties, their corresponding types of\ndiscriminative consciousness, and their appropriate sense objects.\nDifferent Buddhist schools, however, held different positions on the\ndistinctive nature of perceptual experience, and on the specific roles\nof the sense faculties and status of sense objects in it. The\nTheravāda Abhidhamma and the\nSarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika both espouse a view that\nproposes a direct contact between perceptual consciousness and its\nsense objects, the latter being understood as sensibilia, for\nwhat we perceive are not objects of common sense but their sensible\nqualities. We may characterize this view as phenomenalist realism\n(Dreyfus 1997, 331 & 336). \n\nThe Theravāda Abhidhamma sets out its theory of the\nconsciousness process (citta-vīthi) in its commentaries\nand manuals, mainly in the works of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta (5th\ncentury CE), and Anuruddha (10th or 11th century CE), based on earlier\ndescriptions in the Dhammasaṅgaṇi and the\nPaṭṭhāna (Vism XIV 111–124,\nXVII 126–145; Dhs-a 82–106 & 267–287;\nVibh-a 155–160; Abhidh-s 17–21). The\ntheory is not separate from the dhamma taxonomy and the\nanalysis of citta as previously outlined in section 2. Rather,\nin congruency with the notion of existence (whether categorial or\nontological) as functioning, it analyzes sensory perception as\nresulting from particular functions that are performed by the\neighty-nine citta types revealed by the foregoing taxonomy.\nAccording to this analysis, the specific functions in the consciousness\nflow occur at particular instants of that continuum, as the normal flow\nof consciousness involves the mind picking up and putting down sense\nobjects by means of successive sets of associated mental factors. The\nresult is a fairly static account of mental and material phenomena as\nthey arise in consciousness over a series of consciousness\n moments.[16] \n\nRestricting the account to the consciousness process of ordinary\nbeings, two types of process are described: five-sense-door processes\n(pañcadvāra) and mind-door processes\n(manodvāra). These may occur in succession, or mind-door\nprocesses may occur independently. Five-sense-door processes account\nfor sensory perception as information is directly received from the\nfields of the five physical sense faculties. Mind-door processes\ninternalize the information received through the sense faculties and\ncharacterize the mind that is absorbed in thought or memory. Objects at\nthe “door” of the mind, which is treated in Buddhist\nthought as a sixth sense faculty, may be past, present, or future,\npurely conceptual or even transcendent. Normally, however, the object\nat the mind door will be either a past memory or a concept. If there is\nno perceptual activity, as is the case in deep, dreamless sleep, the\nmind is in a state of rest called inactive mode\n(bhavaṅga). Throughout one’s life, the same type\nof citta performs this function of the inactive mind that is\nthe natural mode to which the mind reverts. The mind switches from its\ninactive mode to a simple mind-door process when a concept or memory\noccurs and no attention is directed to the other five sense fields. The\nsimplest mind-door process is a succession of the following functions:\n1) adverting to the object of thought: a function that lasts one moment\nand becomes internalized as an object support; 2) impulsion: occurs for\nup to seven moments and performs the function of the mind’s\nresponding actively to the object with wholesome or unwholesome karma;\n3) retaining: holding on to the object of the consciousness process for\none or two moments. \n\nThe mind switches from its inactive mode to any of the\nfive-sense-door processes when an object occurs at the\n“door” of the appropriate sense faculty. This process of\nsensory perception involves a greater number of functions: 1) disturbed\ninactive mind: a function that arises due to the stimulus of the sense\nobject. It lasts for two moments, during which sensory contact takes\nplace, i.e., a physical impact of the sense object on the physical\nmatter of the appropriate sense faculty; 2) adverting: lasts one\nmoment, during which the mind turns towards the object at the\nappropriate sense “door;” 3) perceiving: lasts one moment\nand is the sheer perception of the sense object with minimal\ninterpretation; 4) receiving: lasts one moment and performs the\nintermediary role of enabling transit to and from the appropriate\ndiscriminative consciousness, whether visual, auditory, etc.; 5)\ninvestigating: lasts one moment and performs the role of establishing\nthe nature of the sense object and of determining the mind’s\nresponse to that object that has just been identified; 6) impulsion:\nsame as in the mind-door process; 7) retaining: same as in the\nmind-door process. As an example, visual perception involves not only\nseeing itself, but also a succession of moments of fixing of the visual\nobject in the mind, recognition of its general features, and\nidentification of its nature. In both the mind-door and five-sense door\nprocesses, the sense faculty and its sense object condition the arising\nof a present moment of a corresponding apprehending consciousness, that\nis, perception here is modeled on simultaneous conditioning. And in\nboth the mind-door and five-sense door processes, when the retaining\nfunction ceases, the mind reenters its inactive mode. \n\nThe consciousness types that perform most of the functions that make\nup the mind-door and the five-sense-door processes fall into the\ncategory of resultant cittas, that is, those that are the\nresult of past actively wholesome or unwholesome consciousness. This\nmeans that the experience of the sense data presented to one’s\nmind is determined by one’s previous actions and is beyond of\none’s immediate control. Whenever one remembers or\nconceptualizes, sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches something that\nis desirable or pleasing, one experiences a result of previous\nwholesome consciousness. And vice versa with objects that are\nundesirable or unpleasing and previous unwholesome consciousness\nrespectively. Only in the final stage of the consciousness process,\nwhen the mind has chosen to respond actively to its object in some way,\nactively present wholesome or unwholesome consciousness operates and\nconstitutes karma that will bear future results. The Abhidhamma thus\n“provides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of\ndependent arising” (Gethin 1998, 216). \n\nThe Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika proposes a similar\naccount of sensory perception, but argues that the sensory object\nexists as a real entity. The Sautrāntika theory of perception,\nhowever, is rather different. It rests on the Sautrāntika radical\nview of momentariness, according to which there is no real duration but\nonly a succession of infinitesimal moments, and on its view of\ncausation, according to which causes cease to exist when their effects\ncome into existence. The application of these principles to sensory\nperception makes it difficult to explain how perception directly\napprehends sense objects, for it implies that objects have ceased when\ntheir apprehending consciousness arises. The Sautrāntika reply is\nthat consciousness does not have direct access to its sense objects. By\ncontrast to phenomenalist realism, the Sautrāntika view of\nperceptual consciousness may be characterized as representationalism:\nit sees perception as apprehending its objects indirectly, through the\nmediation of aspects (ākāra) representative of their\nobjects (Dreyfus 1997, 335 & 380–381). \n\nWhat is common to all the three main Abhidharma\ntraditions—Theravāda, Sarvāstivāda, and\nSautrāntika—is that they manifest a somewhat similar\nparadigm shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned\nworld into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was\npart of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain,\nand Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical\nquestions about the nature of the external world and the self, and\nfocused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language.\nTheir purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and means\nof valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this epistemological turn\nsaw the rise of thinkers such as Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, the\nfounders of the Yogācāra (400–480 CE), and, most notably,\nDignāga and Dharmakīrti (around 500 CE) who developed\nsophisticated logical and philosophical systems (ibid, 15–19).\nThe Abhidharma, then, sets the stage for this epistemological turn.\nThe new emphasis becomes dominant from the period of the\nvibhāṣā compendia onward and is evident in a\nshift in the terminology used by the Abhidharma to describe the nature\nof dharmas. This terminological shift is indicated by the\nterms “particular inherent characteristic” (Skt.,\nsvalakṣaṇa, Pali, salakkhaṇa) and\n“general characteristic” (Skt.,\nsāmānyalakṣaṇa, Pali,\nsāmānyalakkhaṇa). \n\nThe term lakṣaṇa/lakkhaṇa means a mark,\nor a specific characteristic that distinguishes an indicated object\nfrom others. The Logicians use this term in the sense of\n“definition” of a concept or logical category. The\nAbhidharma applies it to the practice of the discernment of\ndharmas, distinguishing between multiple generic\ncharacteristics a dharma shares with other dharmas\nand (at least) one particular inherent characteristic that defines a\ndharma as that very individual occurrence distinct from any\nother instances of its type. The post-canonical Abhidharma thus\nassimilates the concept of the particular inherent characteristic with\nthat of intrinsic nature. “Dhammas,” the\nTheravādin commentarial literature states, “are so called\nbecause they bear their particular inherent characteristics”\n(Vibh-a 45; Vibh-mṭ 35; Paṭis-a\nI 79; Vism XV 3), and a particular characteristic “is\nthe intrinsic nature that is not held in common by other\ndhammas” (Vism-mhṭ II 137). Used in\nconjunction or interchangeably with intrinsic nature, the particular\ninherent characteristic constitutes a dhamma’s unique\ndefinition (Vism VI 19, 35). It is an epistemological and\nlinguistic determinant of a dhamma as a knowable instance that\nis defined by a distinct verbal description. \n\nThe Mahāvibhāṣā of the\nSarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika similarly distinguishes\nbetween a dharma’s particular inherent and generic\ncharacteristics and identifies the former with intrinsic nature, thus\ndiscriminating “levels in the apprehension or discernment of\ndharmas that serve to clarify the ambiguity encountered in the\napplication of the term svabhāva to both individual\ndharmas and to categorial groups” (Cox 2004A, 575). The\ndifference between the analytical description of dharmas in\nterms of their intrinsic nature or their characteristics, notes Cox\n(ibid, 576), is that “whereas intrinsic nature acquires\nits special significance in the context of exegetical categorization,\nthe starting point for the characteristics lies in perspectivistic\ncognition. Ontology is a concern for both systems, but the shift in\nterminology from intrinsic nature to the characteristics reflects a\nconcurrent shift from a category-based abstract ontology to an\nepistemological ontology that is experientially or cognitively\ndetermined.” This new epistemological emphasis looms in through a\nmodified definition of existence proposed by the mature\nSarvāstivāda exegesis that sees the causal efficacy\nunderlying all existence as cognitive. Representing this development in\nthe history of Sarvāstivāda thought is Saṅghabhadra\n(fifth century CE), who states in his\nNyāyānusāra: “to be an object-field that\nproduces cognition (buddhi) is the true characteristic of\nexistence” (ibid). This means that dharmas as\nthe constituents of our experiential world are objectively identifiable\nthrough cognition. \n\nIn sum, the Abhidharma project, as evident by the dharma\ntheory and its supporting doctrines, is, at bottom,\nepistemologically oriented. Yet the project also intends to ascertain\nthat every constituent of the experiential world is knowable and\nnameable, and that the words and concepts used in the discourse that\ndevelops around the discernment of these constituents uniquely define\ntheir corresponding referents. The dharma analysis therefore\npaves the way for conceptual realism: a worldview that is based on the\nnotion of truth as consisting in a correspondence between our\nconcepts and statements, on the one hand, and the features of an\nindependent, determinate reality, on the other hand. Conceptual realism\ndoes not necessarily have implications for the ontological status of\nthis reality as externally existing. But to espouse such a position is\nto make a significant move away from the earliest Buddhist teaching\nthat presents the Buddha’s view of language as\n conventional.[17]","contact.mail":"noa.ronkin@wolfson.oxon.org","contact.domain":"wolfson.oxon.org"}]
