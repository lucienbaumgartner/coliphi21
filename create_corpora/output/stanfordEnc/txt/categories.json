Traditionally, following Aristotle, these have been thought of\nas highest genera of entities (in the widest sense of the term), so\nthat a system of categories undertaken in this realist spirit would\nideally provide an inventory of everything there is, thus answering\nthe most basic of metaphysical questions: “What is there?”\nSkepticism about our ability to discern a unique system of basic\ncategories of ‘reality itself’ has led others to approach\ncategory systems not with the aim of cataloging the highest kinds in\nthe world itself, but rather with the aim of elucidating the\ncategories of our conceptual system or language. Thus Kant makes the\nshift to a conceptualist approach by drawing out the categories that\nare a priori necessary for any possible cognition of\nobjects. Since such categories are guaranteed to apply to any possible\nobject of cognition, they retain a certain sort of ontological import,\nalthough this application is limited to phenomena, not the thing in\nitself. After Kant, it has been common to approach the project of\ncategories in a neutral spirit that Brian Carr (1987, 7) calls\n“categorial descriptivism”, as describing the categorial\nstructure that the world would have\naccording to our thought, experience, or language, while\nrefraining from making commitments about whether or not these\ncategories are occupied, or are ontically fundamental. Edmund Husserl\napproaches categories in something like this way, since he begins by\nlaying out categories of\nmeanings, which may then be used to draw out\nontological categories (categories of possible objects meant)\nas the correlates of the meaning categories, without concern for any\nempirical matter about whether or not there really are objects of the\nvarious ontological categories discerned.\n\n\n\nA system of ontological categories drawn out in any of these modes has\nthe potential for a great many uses in philosophy, but those who would\noffer such systems of categories also face a variety of\ndifficulties. They must address the issue of what the proper methods\nare by means of which categories are to be distinguished, how many\ncategories there are and what they are, whether or not there is a\nsingle summum genus subsuming all other categories, and\nwhether we should distinguish a single system of categories or\nmultiple dimensions of categories – issues on which there has\nbeen little agreement.\n\n\n\nOver the past hundred years, skepticism about the possibility of\noffering a uniquely true and complete system of ontological categories\nhas led discussion of categories to shift from attempts to offer\ncomplete systems of categories to attempts merely to draw particular\ndistinctions, especially among our conceptual or linguistic categories.\nWork on category differences, unlike that on category systems, does not\ngenerally purport to answer deep metaphysical questions about what\nthings or kinds of things exist; instead, category differences are typically\narticulated as a way of diagnosing and avoiding various philosophical\nproblems and confusions. Nonetheless, even those who merely argue for\ncategory differences owe an account of the conditions under which two\nconcepts, terms, or objects belong to different categories.\n\n\n\nPhilosophical interest in categories may be traced back to Aristotle\nwho, in his treatise Categories, attempts to enumerate the\nmost general kinds into which entities in the world divide. He does not\nbegin from a single highest kind, but rather lists the following as the\nten highest categories of things “said without any\ncombination” (Categories 1b25): \n\nThere are two sorts of substance: a primary substance is, e.g., an\nindividual man or horse; the species (and genera) of these\nindividuals (e.g., man, animal) are secondary\nsubstances. While the ten categories are all equally highest kinds,\nprimary substances nonetheless have a certain sort of priority, since\n“all the other things are either said of the primary substances\nas subjects or in them as subjects. So if the primary substances did\nnot exist it would be impossible for any of the other things to\nexist” (Categories 2b4). \n\nElsewhere, in Metaphysics (998b22), Aristotle argues\nexplicitly that there cannot be a highest genus (e.g., of\nbeing or unity) shared by entities of different\ncategories (cf. Ackrill 1963, 81). For a species is defined in terms of\nits subsuming genus and differentia (e.g., man is definable as an\nanimal that is rational), and while the genus (animal) may be\npredicated of the species (man), it may not be predicated of the\ndifferentia (rational). As a result, if being (or unity) were\na genus, no differentiae could be said to have being (or to be one);\nbut “the differentiae of any genus must each of them both have\nbeing and be one” (Metaphysics 998b22–3). \n\nThe ancient Greek term ‘kategoria’ described what could be\nsaid against someone in a court of law, and indeed Aristotle uses what\ncan be said of or in a subject as a route to\ndistinguishing categories. There is controversy in the literature,\nhowever, about precisely how he arrived at his categories (Studtmann\n2007). On one prominent interpretation, put forward by J. L. Ackrill,\nAristotle arrived at his list of categories by way of distinguishing\n“different questions which may be asked about something”\nand noting “that only a limited range of answers can be\nappropriately given to any particular question” (Ackrill 1963,\n78–9), e.g., the question ‘what is it’ can only be\nasked of a substance, and only answers describing substances are\nappropriate. The question ‘how much’, by contrast,\nrequires a quantity for an answer, and so on. \n\nBut although on this interpretation Aristotle seems to have arrived at\nhis categories by considering different sorts of question and answer,\nthe categories he was offering were supposed to be categories of\nentities, not of language; language was just a clue to truths\nabout the world.  As J. L. Ackrill writes,\nAristotle’s Categories “is not primarily or explicitly\nabout names, but about the things that names signify…Aristotle\nrelies greatly on linguistic facts and tests, but his aim is to\ndiscover truths about non-linguistic items” (1963, 71). \nOther interpretations have also been suggested about how Aristotle’s\ncategories were derived. Some hold that Aristotle’s list was arrived\nat by reflecting on grammatical categories, and assuming a parallelism\nbetween structures of language and structures of the world (Baumer\n1993). But others have developed interpretations that do not consider\nAristotle to have arrived at his categories by considering linguistic\nmatters such as grammatical structure or the questions we may\nask. Instead, they take them to arise from more worldly considerations\nsuch as which types of entity any sensible particular must be related\nto (Moravcsik 1967). For an overview of the interpretive options, see\nStudtmann (2007).  \nIn any case, regardless of how the categories were derived,\nAristotle’s approach to categories is generally taken to be in the\nspirit of what Brian Carr calls “categorial\nrealism” – an approach conceiving of a system of categories\nas a list of the highest genera of beings (not merely of language or\nthought – even if those may be used in deriving the metaphysical\ncategories). As Studtmann (2007) puts it, Aristotle “ assumes\nrather than defends a posture of realism with respect to the\nmetaphysical structures of the world”. Given this approach, a\ncomplete system of categories would offer a systematic inventory of\nwhat there is, considered at the most abstract level (although it is\nnot clear whether Aristotle intended his categories to be\nexhaustive). Thus on a categorial realist approach, providing a system\nof categories can be seen as one, or even\nthe central task of metaphysics (cf. Grossman 1983, 3). Such a\nsystem of categories may also play a central role in answering\nindividual questions of nature, providing the most general sort of\nanswer to questions of the form “What is this?”, and\nproviding the basis for definitions of narrower sorts of things by\nspecifying the most general category (genus) under which things of this\nsort fall, and the differentia that distinguishes them from other\nthings of the same category. This has endured as the paradigmatic\napproach to categories, and several recent authors have offered new\ntheories of categories in this spirit of Aristotelian realism (see\n§1.4 below). \n\nOthers, however, have shied away from this robustly realist approach\nto categories, generally on grounds of skepticism about our ability to\ndiscern intrinsic divisions in ‘reality itself’, and have\ninstead treated the project of categories as a matter of laying out the\nhighest categories governing our conceptual scheme. This shift in\napproach to what Carr (1987, 6) calls “categorial\nconceptualism” was made famous by Immanuel Kant. While Kant\nfamously denied that we have access to intrinsic divisions (if any) of\nthe thing in itself that lies behind appearances or phenomena, he held\nthat we can discover the essential categories that govern\nhuman understanding, which are the basis for any possible cognition of\nphenomena. Thus, as H. J. Paton puts it, for Kant “We can have\na priori knowledge by means of the categories, only if the\ncategories are due to the nature of the mind and are imposed by the\nmind on the objects which it knows” (1936, 258). \n\nIn his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant arrives at his list of\ncategories by first enumerating the forms of possible judgment\n(A70/B95-A93/B109). On this view, objective empirical judgments (i.e.,\nempirical judgments which purport to refer to objects rather than\nmerely subjective seemings or connections of sense impressions, and\nwhich purport to be universally valid for all judging subjects) are\nendowed with their objectivity and generality in virtue of the a priori\nconcepts embodied in the relevant forms of judgment. If we can identify\nall of the possible forms of objective empirical judgment, we can then\nhope to use them as the basis to discover all of the most general\nconcepts or categories that are employed in making such judgments, and\nthus that are employed in any cognition of objects (Körner 1955,\n48–49). \n\nThus in distinguishing his categories, Kant begins from Aristotelian\nlogic in outlining four respects in which one can classify any\njudgment: according to its quantity, quality, relation, or modality. In\neach of these respects or ‘moments’ of judgment, there are\nthree alternative classifications; thus, e.g., in respect of quantity,\na judgment may be universal, particular, or singular; in respect of its\nrelation, a judgment may be categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive,\nand so on. These Aristotelian ways of classifying judgments are the\nclue to discerning the twelve correlated concepts of the understanding.\nSo, e.g., from noting that all judgments are either universal (e.g.,\nAll swans are white), particular (e.g., Some swans are white) or\nsingular (e.g., Cygmund is white), we can arrive at the three\ncorresponding categories of quantity: unity, plurality, and totality.\nVia this route, Kant ultimately distinguishes twelve pure concepts of\nthe understanding (A80/B106), divided into four classes of three: \n\nThe categories are presented as forming a single exhaustive list,\nwith the four classes of categories imposing four different forms of\nunity on the object known (Paton 1936, 295–9). Thus, one may separately\ninquire after an object’s quantity, quality, relation, and modality,\nreceiving one of the three sub-answers in each case on the way to a\nmore complete characterization of the object. \n\nAlthough these are categories of the understanding, they nonetheless\nretain a certain sort of ontological import, as it is a priori\nthat they apply universally to all objects of possible cognition\n(A79/B105). In this way, by delineating the concepts that are a\npriori necessary for the cognition of objects, we can\nacquire knowledge of categories governing any possible object\nof cognition, and so acquire a sort of descriptive set of ontological\ncategories, though these must be understood explicitly as categories\nof objects of possible cognition, not of the thing in itself.\nThus Kant was able to treat his system of concepts as a system of\ncategories in something like the Aristotelian sense, “for our\nprimary purpose is the same as his [Aristotle’s], although widely\ndiverging from it in manner of execution” (A80/B105).\nNonetheless, it is clear that for Kant the categories find their\noriginal source in principles of human understanding, not in intrinsic\ndivisions in mind-independent reality, and are discoverable by paying\nattention to possible forms of human judgment, not by study of the\nworld itself, nor by study of our contingent manners of speaking. \n\nEdmund Husserl introduced two sorts of innovation to the study of\ncategories. First, while Aristotle used language as a clue to\nontological categories, and Kant treated concepts as the route to\ncategories of objects of possible cognition, Husserl explicitly\ndistinguished categories of meanings from categories of\nobjects, and attempted to draw out the law-like correlations\nbetween categories of each sort (Smith 2007, 139ff.). Secondly,\nwhereas Aristotle and Kant each lay out a single system of categories,\nHusserl distinguishes two ways of arriving at top-level ontological\nclassifications: by\nformalization and by generalization, yielding two\nseparate, orthogonal, systems of categories, in two different\ndimensions (cf. Smith 2004, chapter 8). \n\nHusserl is careful to distinguish categories of meanings (by\nway of which we can think about the highest kinds or\n‘essences’ of objects) from the\ncategories meant – the latter are the categories of\nobjects, or\nontological categories, considered as the highest essences\nthat entities might have: “by ‘categories’ we can\nunderstand, on the one hand, concepts in the sense of meanings, but on\nthe other also, and to better effect, the formal essences themselves\nwhich find their expression in these meanings” (1913 [1962],\n61–2).  But although the two sorts of categories must be\ndistinguished, according to Husserl categories of the two sorts are\nessentially correlated (see below), so we can learn about one by way\nof the other. \n\nRegardless of whether we are studying categories of meanings or of\nobjects, Husserl is quite clear that the study of categories, for him,\nis an entirely a priori matter; the categories of meanings and\nobjects alike “arise … solely in relation to our varying\nthought-functions: their concrete basis is solely to be found in\npossible acts of thought, as such, or in the correlates which can be\ngrasped in these” (1913 [2000], 237). As he puts it later, in the\nIdeas, the study of categories is a study of essences, based\nin essential insights about the types of meanings and\ncorrelative types of things. Such studies of essence may be conducted\nby way of imaginative variation of cases, independently of any matter\nof fact, including whether or not there actually is anything\nof the ontological kinds distinguished (1913 [1962], 51). Thus\nHusserl’s ontological categories, in this sense, are\ndescriptive categories of highest essences of possible things\n(that might fall under those essences), and do not purport to provide\nan inventory of what things actually exist (as a matter of\nempirical fact). \n\nHusserl provides an extensive discussion of categories of meaning in\nthe Logical Investigations, arguing that differences in\ncategories of meaning (which seem to be more like syntactic than\nsemantic categories) can be distinguished by noting where nonsense\nresults from substituting one term for another. E.g., in the sentence\n“This tree is green” we may substitute\n“chair” – but not “careless” – for\n“tree” without turning sense into nonsense, marking the\ndifference between the meaning categories of nominative\nmaterial and adjectival material (1913 [2000],\n511–512). Husserl’s understanding of ‘nonsense’ is\nrather strict: he counts only those strings of words that\nare syntactically incorrect (so that they form a mere\n‘heap of words’ and cannot be combined into any unified\nmeaning (Husserl 1913 [2000], 522)) as strictly nonsensical, and thus as\nsigns of differences in categories of meaning. (Husserl repeatedly\ndistinguishes the nonsense of verbal formations like “a round\nor” (in which no unified meaning emerges) from cases of\nmere absurdity such as “a round square”, in which\nthe expression has a unified meaning, although it is a priori\nthat no object can correspond to the expression (1913 [2000],\n516–17)). \n\nCorrelated with the categories of meanings are ontological\ncategories; e.g., object, state of affairs, unit, plurality, number,\nand relation are (formal) categories that categorize objects, not\nmeanings (Husserl 1913 [2000], 237). Categories of the two sorts are,\naccording to Husserl, connected by ‘ideal laws’. Thus, for\nexample, presumably objects are the ontological correlates of the\nmeaning category of nominative expressions, properties are the\nontological correlates of adjectival expressions, and states of affairs\nare the ontological correlates of propositions. So while Husserl does\nnot (to my knowledge) explicitly lay out a method of discerning\nontological categories, it may be that we can derive them by\nbeginning from the above nonsense test for distinguishing meaning\ncategories, and then shifting attention to the correlative ontological\ncategories, since “pure truths concerning meaning can be\ntransformed into pure truths concerning the object” (1913 [1962],\n61). \n\nAs well as explicitly distinguishing categories of meanings from\ncategories of the correlated objects that could possibly be\n‘meant’, Husserl introduced a second innovation to the\nstudy of categories by distinguishing highest formal essences\n(which Husserl calls ‘categories’) from highest\nmaterial essences (which he calls ‘regions’)\n(1913 [1962], §10; cf. Smith 1995, 329–330 and Smith 2007,\n142–148). Thus far I have been describing the formal\nontological categories, the correlates of the different meaning\ncategories distinguishable by the nonsense test. In fact, Husserl\nreserves the term ‘category’ for the highest formal\ngenera, which are distinguished by a process of\nformalization – a removal of content. These\n‘categorial essences’ begin with ‘object in\ngeneral’ at the top of the tree, which is then divided at the\nnext level into categories including (as examples) object, state of\naffairs, property, relation, number, etc. (compare lists 1913 [2000], 237\nand 1913 [1962], 61). Much as Aristotle distinguished (independent)\nprimary substances from (dependent) things of other kinds, within his\nformal categories Husserl distinguishes the ‘substrative’\ncategory of individuals (or, more properly, the mere\nthis-there) from the dependent ‘syntactic\nobjectivities’ – the correlates of nominative terms that\nare derived from ways in which we speak about the primary substances\n(1913 [1962], 62–3 and 67) (as, e.g., the nominative term ‘this\nrelation of brightness’ may be derived from claims that ‘A\nis brighter than B’ (1913 [2000], 797–8)). \n\nHusserl’s material categories, by contrast, classify entities\naccording to their nature or essence, with the highest material genera\nto be arrived at by a process of generalization to the most\ngeneral kind of content involved, rather than by the\nformalization that involves an emptying of all content\n(1913 [1962], 65). The highest material categories are the three\nregions: nature (including physical objects and events), culture\n(including artifacts, social entities, and values), and consciousness\n(cf. Smith 2004). While formal and material category systems each form\na hierarchy (1913 [1962], 64), considered jointly their categories are\nnot mutually exclusive, since one and the same entity may be\ncategorized either in terms of its material nature or its form. For\nfurther discussion of Husserl’s categories, see Smith (2007,\n135–161). \n\nHusserl is nowhere explicit about the proper method for\ndistinguishing material ontological categories, but he does distinguish\nmaterial absurdity from formal absurdity, and from the formal nonsense\nthat marks the difference in meaning categories (1913 [2000], 523).\nExpressions are formally absurd if it is a priori\nthat no object could correspond to them, based purely on formal,\nlogical laws, without regard to which particular material concepts are\nemployed, e.g., “a round not-round thing” is formally\nabsurd; its absurdity would remain regardless of which adjective we\nsubstituted for ‘round’ or which noun for\n‘thing’. On the other hand, expressions are materially\nabsurd if the impossibility of there being any corresponding object is\nbased in the particular material concepts employed, e.g., ‘a\nround square’ is a materially absurd expression based in the\nparticular meanings of ‘round’ and ‘square’.\nThus presumably one could attempt to distinguish material ontological\ncategories by the material absurdity that results from substituting\nexpressions for objects of different material kinds; ‘a\nround table’, for example, makes perfect sense, but if we\nsubstitute for ‘table’ a term for a geometric figure such\nas ‘square’ or for a day of the week such as\n‘Thursday’, we get a materially absurd statement (to which\nit is a priori that nothing corresponds). As we will see in\n§2.2 below, Gilbert Ryle developed Husserl’s nonsense test for\ncategory differences in something like this way. \n\nRoman Ingarden (1960 [1964], 22ff) took Husserl’s multi-dimensional\nontology one step further. Like Husserl, he distinguished formal\ncategories from material categories, but he also distinguished\ncategories in a third dimension: existential categories (those\ndescribing an entity’s mode of being). The highest existential\ncategories on Ingarden’s list are the real (spatio-temporal\nbeing), the ideal (abstract), the absolute (completely independent,\natemporal), and purely intentional (consciousness-dependent). While any\nconceivable entity should be uniquely locatable in a single category of\neach dimension, the three sorts of ontology are mutually orthogonal,\nproviding different most abstract ways of considering the putative\nentity in question. Thus, e.g., a sculpture might be categorized\nformally as an object, materially as a work of art, and existentially\nas purely intentional. \n\nIn the twentieth century, systems of ontological categories fell\nsomewhat out of fashion (for reasons I will discuss in\n§1.5 below), with most discussion of categories shifting to\nmerely articulating category differences rather than aiming to outline a\ncomprehensive system of categories. \nOne important exception to this comes in the work of Samuel Alexander,\nwho, in his 1920 work Space, Time and Deity develops a theory\nof categories in the realist spirit. Alexander defends a monist\nontology in which he posits Space-Time as \"the one monistic entity\nthat encompasses every entity and every feature in reality\" (Fisher\n2015, 246). He sees the categories as grounded on the intrinsic nature\nof Space-Time, and posits as categorial features only those which are\n'pervasive', that is, instantiated by every entity. The categories he\nidentifies come in three 'grades' (or ranks of increasing complexity,\nin which the latter grades presuppose the former), giving us the\nfollowing system:  \n\nIn recent years there have also been several notable attempts to offer\nnew systems of categories in either the realist or descriptivist\nspirit, although little agreement exists about what the categories are\nor how one could decide among competing systems. \n\nIngvar Johansson (1989) and Roderick Chisholm (1996) both take a\nneo-Aristotelian realist approach to categories, attempting to lay out\na complete system of the categories, where this is understood as\nproviding a list of categories of real entities in the world. Ingvar\nJohansson explicitly insists that his interest is in the world:\n“This book is a book about the world. I am concerned with\nontology, not merely with language” (1989, 1), and attempts to\noffer “a realist theory of categories regarded as real aspects of\nbeing” (1989, 2). His list (1989, 20) includes nine main\ncategories (some of which subdivide further): \n\nUnlike Aristotle, Johansson makes no explicit use of language in\ndiscerning ontological categories, instead appealing to the method of\nsuccessive abstraction (Johansson 1989, 1–2). Thus, e.g., we arrive at\nthe category ‘quality’ by moving up in abstraction from a\nparticular shade of dark red, to red, color, and finally quality.\nSimilarly (to use an example of Sellars’) one might try to arrive at\nthe category of ‘substance’ by considering an individual\nentity, say, Fido, and moving by successive abstraction from\n“Fido is a dachshund” through “Fido is a dog”\nand “Fido is an animal”, ultimately reaching “Fido is\na substance” (1970 [1974], 321). Like Aristotle’s categories,\nJohansson’s categories top out with a number of distinctions without a\nhighest single category subsuming them all. \n\nLike Aristotle and Johansson, Roderick Chisholm presents his work on\ncategories as being “about the ultimate categories of\nreality” (1996, 3). Unlike them, however, Chisholm (1996, 3)\nlays out categories in the form of a porphyrian tree starting from a\nsingle most general category comprising everything, but divided into\nsuccessively narrower genera at lower levels of branching. (For an\ninteresting discussion of whether such general terms as\n‘entity’ or ‘thing’ could be seen as naming a\nhighest category, see Thompson 1957, cf. §2.3 below). Chisholm’s\nsystem of categories thus reads: \n\nOther contemporary authors have approached the issue of categories\nin a purely descriptive spirit. Reinhardt Grossman, for example,\ndistinguishes eight highest categories (1983, xvi): \n\nBut although Grossman characterizes his book as an attempt to\n“bring Aristotle’s Categories up-to-date” (1983,\nxv), he is explicit in denying that he is making any claims about\nwhether or not there are things belonging to any of the eight\ncategories he distinguishes, taking this as beyond the scope of\nontology (1983, 10–12). \n\nJoshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz (1994) lay out a tree-form\nsystem of categories, with entity the summum genus,\nsubdivided into abstract and concrete (rather than\nChisholm’s contingent and necessary), each of which\nis further subdivided: \n\nThey, too, explicitly offer their system of categories in the spirit\nof categorial description, as offering an analysis of the various\npossible categories of being, rather than making any claims about which\nof these categories is non-empty (1994, 7–8). \n\nE. J. Lowe takes categories to be categories of “what kinds of\nthings can exist and coexist” (2006, 5). Such categories, he\nargues, are to be individuated according to the existence and/or\nidentity conditions of their members; fundamental categories are those\nregarding which the existence and identity conditions for their\nmembers cannot be exhaustively specified in terms of ontological\ndependence relations they bear to entities of other categories (2006,\n8). Accordingly, he argues that there are four fundamental ontological\ncategories: objects (individual substances such as Fido), modes\n(property or relation instances such as Fido’s four-leggedness), kinds\n(substantial universals such as the kind dog), and attributes\n(property or relation universals, such as being\nfour-legged). But although he argues that there are exactly\nfour fundamental categories, Lowe nonetheless takes a\nhierarchical approach to arranging categories. The four fundamental\ncategories appear at the third level of his hierarchical chart; the\ncategories that appear at the higher levels (particulars and\nuniversals at the second level; entity at the top) are “mere\nabstractions and do no serious ontological work on their own\naccount” (2006, 39). His fuller chart of categories appears as\nfollows: Others, taking the project of developing categories in an\nexplicitly realist spirit and driven by the goal of offering a\nparsimonious ontology, have aimed to offer a more minimal system of\nfundamental ontological categories. For example, Laurie Paul (2016)\nhas recently defended a ‘one-category’ ontology that accepts (at the\nfundamental level) only the existence of intrinsic characters or\nqualities. Against those who accept more categories, she argues that\nwe have no need (for example) for a fundamental division between\nindividuals and their properties, and that a one-category ontology is\nboth more parsimonious and has a better claim to carve the world at\nits ‘ontological joints’. \n\nBoth realist and descriptivist category systems, at least as\ntraditionally presented, seem to presuppose that there is a unique true\nanswer to the question of what categories of entity there are – indeed\nthe discovery of this answer is the goal of most such inquiries into\nontological categories. Grossman, for example, argues that a list of\ncategories must be complete, contain everything, with everything in its\nproper place (1983, 4). Johansson similarly takes his project\nas to “develop a coherent system of all the most\nabstract categories needed to give a true description of the\nworld” (1989, 1). Arguments about which of the many systems of\ncategories offered is correct likewise seem to presuppose that there is\na uniquely correct list of categories. \n\nBut actual category systems offered vary so much that even a short\nsurvey of past category systems like that above can undermine the\nbelief that such a unique, true and complete system of categories may\nbe found. Given such a diversity of answers to the question of what the\nontological categories are, by what criteria could we possibly choose\namong them to determine which is uniquely correct? \n\nSome minimal standards of adequacy immediately suggest themselves\n(Butchvarov 1995, 75). Whether one takes a realist or descriptivist\napproach to providing a system of categories, if that system is\nsupposed to be comprehensive, it clearly must meet at least the\nstandard of being exhaustive – providing a category for everything\nthere is (on the realist approach) or might be (on the descriptive\napproach). Nonetheless, one may, as Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994,\n140) do, present a system of some fundamental categories\nwithout taking it to be exhaustive. \n\nAnother minimal criterion of adequacy is generally taken to be that\nthe highest categories (or, for tree systems, the categories at each\nlevel of branching) be mutually exclusive, ensuring that whatever\nthere is (or might be) finds its place in exactly one highest\ncategory, or one category at each level (Chisholm 1989, 162). (This\nstill allows for nested categories, so that something may belong to\nboth a more specific category like substance and a more general\ncategory like individual.) \n\nBut these criteria are not enough to provide the needed reassurance.\nFirst, we lack assurance that most proposed category systems meet even\nthese minimal conditions. As mentioned above, Aristotle drew out his\ncategories largely by considering the types of question that could be\nasked (and the types of answer appropriate to them). It is difficult to\nknow, however, how one can be assured that all kinds of questions have\nbeen surveyed, and so difficult to know that an exhaustive list of\ncategories has been offered – a point Aristotle does not attempt\nto demonstrate (Ackrill 1963, 80–81). Indeed, the fact that Aristotle\nprovides different lists of categories in different places suggests\nthat he did not consider his list final and exhaustive. Similarly,\nKant’s system of categories can be thought to be exhaustive only\nas long as the list of forms of judgment from which he derives them\nexhausts the possible forms of judgment – but we have reason to\nthink this is not so (Körner 1955, 50). Johansson, as we have\nseen, instead uses the method of successive abstraction. But it is not\nclear how following such a method could ensure either that the\ncategories thereby distinguished are exhaustive (how do we know we have\nconsidered something of each highest kind if we do not yet know what\nthe highest kinds are?) or even mutually exclusive. \n\nSecondly, even if we can verify that the standards of mutual\nexclusivity and exhaustiveness are met, these conditions alone are far\ntoo weak to uniquely pick out a system of categories. Provided one\naccepts the law of the excluded middle, an endless supply of mutually\nexclusive and exhaustive classifications can be generated at will: we\ncan divide things into the spatio-temporally located and the\nnot-spatio-temporally-located, the intentional and the non-intentional,\nthe extended and the non-extended, to name but a few of the more\nrelevant ways in which things could be divided. Indeed one of the\nsources of puzzlement about categories comes from the fact that\nphilosophers have selected so many different sorts of divide as\nthe fundamental category difference – for Descartes, the\nextended and the thinking (unextended), for Chisholm the contingent and\nthe necessary, for Hoffman and Rosenkrantz the concrete and the\nabstract, and so on. Thus another reason for skepticism about the\nexistence of a unique set of categories comes from the fact\nthat categories are supposed to be the most abstract genera under which\nthings (may) fall. But from any given entity, abstraction may\napparently be done in a variety of ways – even if we are careful\nto do so in ways that ensure mutual exclusivity and exhaustiveness. \n\nDoubts about possibilities for discovering the one true category\nsystem have led many to eschew talk of category systems altogether, and\nothers to adopt some kind of relativism about category systems that\nceases to take systems of categories seriously as candidate lists of\nthe single set of highest genera under which anything falls\n(or could fall). Jan Westerhoff (2005), for example, argues that there\nis no unique, absolute set of ontological categories. On his view\ncategories in metaphysics turn out to be analogous to axioms in\nmathematical theories; in each case, there may be more than one way to\nsystematize our knowledge from a relatively simple basis. The result\nis a kind of relativity about systems of categories: “which set\nof ontological categories we choose is primarily a matter of\nconvenience, in the same way as specific axiomatizations of\npropositional logic or Newtonian mechanics are more convenient to use\nthan others” (2005, 218). As a result, Westerhoff argues, we\nmust reassess the importance of ontological categories in\nmetaphysics – these should not be considered “the most\nfundamental parts of the world, but... the most fundamental parts\nof our systematization of the world” (2005, 135).  \n\nOthers have taken the variety of category systems explicitly offered\nor presupposed by philosophers as mere evidence of the particular\npresuppositions of their thought, or prejudices of their age – not\nas evidence about anything to do with the world and its\ndivisions. Thus, e.g., Stephan Körner’s discussion of categorial\nframeworks is designed to make explicit how a thinker’s\nframework categorizes objects, making use of certain individuative\nprinciples, and making clear his reasons for holding that framework\n(1970, 10). R. G. Collingwood, in similar vein, treats the task of\nmetaphysics generally as merely uncovering the “presuppositions\nunderlying ordinary science” (1940 [1998]). \n\nThe specific worries about (1) guaranteeing the mutual exclusiveness\nand joint exhaustiveness of the categories, and (2) whether or not any\nsingle system of categories could purport to be uniquely correct, can, however,\nbe met by certain ways of formulating ontological categories. The first\nsort of worry can be met by ensuring that categories (of the same\nlevel) are defined in ways that guarantee mutual exclusiveness and\nexhaustiveness. Thus, e.g., Thomasson (1999, chapter 8) distinguishes\ncategories in terms of what relations of dependence a purported entity\nhas or lacks on mental states (and a second dimension is\ndistinguished in terms of what relations of dependence a purported\nentity has or lacks on spatio-temporally located objects), so that the\nlaw of the excluded middle alone ensures mutual exclusiveness and\nexhaustiveness of the categories distinguished. (Dummett’s method\nof distinguishing categories provides another route for guaranteeing\nmutual exclusivity – see §2.3 below). \n\nMulti-dimensional systems (Husserl 1913 [1962], §10; Ingarden\n1960 [1964], Chapter 2; Thomasson 1999, Chapter 8; Smith forthcoming,\nChapter 8) address the second worry to some extent by acknowledging\nthat the different dimensions of categorization are possible, and that\nno one-dimensional list can purport to completeness. In principle,\nmulti-dimensionalists may even accept that there is no fixed number or\nlimit on how many one-dimensional lists of categories there may be,\nthough each such list may purport to provide a unique, correct,\nexhaustive categorization of entities considered in the chosen\nrespect. \n\nIn any case, given the great potential uses of a system of categories\n(many of which do not depend on claims that that category system is\nuniquely ‘correct’), we should not prematurely abandon\nattempts at developing and evaluating systems of categorization. Even\nif we do not think of a category system as providing a realist\ninventory of all that exists or a description of the fundamental\nintrinsic ‘divisions of reality’, a system of categories laid\nout in the descriptivist spirit provides a framework within which\nexistence questions can be answered in a systematic and wholesale way,\nby enumerating categories so that we can then undertake further\ninvestigations into whether or not there really is anything of each\nkind. Working from within a categorial framework can help ensure that\nwhatever ontology we provide is principled and unified,\navoiding ad hoc and piecemeal decisions. The descriptivist’s\ncategories also provide a tool that may be used elsewhere in ontology,\ne.g., in helping to ensure that comparisons of parsimony are\nlegitimately made (by examining which categories of entity are\naccepted and which denied by various theories), and in checking that\npotential solutions to metaphysical problems are not overlooked by\ntacit use of a category system that is not exhaustive (Thomasson 1999,\nChapters 8 and 9). Another important use of systems of categories is that, with a proposed set of categories laid out, we can, as Daniel Nolan (2011) suggests, go on to investigate questions about the relationships among entities that are placed in different categories: for example,  questions about whether events depend on or are grounded in things, or (as Nolan suggests) whether things and events may ultimately be identified as belonging to a single category. Assumptions about categorizations play such\na strong role in philosophical discussions (e.g., discussions of the\nCartesian theory of mind, Platonist theories of mathematics, etc.),\nthat doing the work on categories necessary to make these categorial\nassumptions explicit and open them for examination must remain a\nhighly useful exercise regardless of doubts about the prospects for\ndiscovering a uniquely correct system of categories. \nFor those who approach categories in a descriptive spirit, as a matter\nof determining the categories of our language or thought, it is\nnatural to turn to linguistics or cognitive science for\nassistance.  \nA prominent approach to determining the ontological categories that\nare implicit in the use of natural language is via Natural Language\nOntology, which provides one way of undertaking a descriptivist\napproach to categories. As Friederike Moltmann (2017) makes clear,\nhowever, the methodology for doing natural language ontology is\nimportantly different from attempts to determine a common sense\nontology by simply asking what ontological claims or categories people\nexplicitly accept or would accept on reflection. So, for example,\nNatural Language Ontology doesn’t determine the ontological categories\nof a natural language by looking to explicit assertions speakers make\n(or would assent to) about categories, such as “objects are not\nevents”. Instead, natural language category distinctions are revealed\nby uncovering the presuppositions of sentences used by\nordinary speakers. For example, the fact that one can acceptably say\n“The building existed last year” but not “The building took place last\nyear”, and “John’s arrival took place last week” but not “John’s\narrival existed last week”, it has been argued, presupposes a\ndifference of category between material objects and events, since the\nconditions of applicability for these predicates apparently presuppose\nthat they apply to entities of different categories (Moltmann 2017,\nSection 3.1). Since Natural Language Ontology “concerns itself with\nthe ontological categories and structures a speaker accepts when using\na language, not those a speaker accepts when engaging in some form of\nphilosophical reflection”, its results may differ widely from the\nontological categories many philosophers would reflectively accept,\nand even from those commonly attributed to natural language (Moltmann\n2017, Section 1). We have reason to engage in natural language\nontology, Moltmann argues, since it may give us “the best indication\nof how we, implicitly, conceive of things” (2017, Section 7). A\nquestion that remains is whether there will be a uniform ontology\nfound across all natural languages, perhaps one fixed by our cognitive\nstructure. \nOne might, of course, turn to cognitive science to attempt to address\nthe question of whether there is a fixed system of categories\ndetermined by our cognitive structure. And indeed, discussions of\ncategories also play an important role in cognitive science, where the\ngoal is not to discover the fundamental categories of being, but\nrather the means by which experiencers come to categorize their\nworld. Here, debates have centered on how humans in fact come to group\nthings into categories – whether this involves lists of definitional\n(observable or hidden) features, resemblance to prototypes, prominent\nfeatures weighted probabilistically, etc. Debates also concern the\nrelation between conceptual and linguistic categories, which levels of\ncategory are more basic, whether there is a most basic set of\ncategories, whether or to what extent categorizations are consistent\nacross cultural groups, and whether or not some fundamental categories\nare innate. The psychologist Susan Carey (2011) has engaged in a\nnumber of studies on infants and primates which, she argues, suggest\nthat there are a number of concepts of ‘core cognition’ that are\ninnate, designed to represent certain classes of entity in the world,\nand that are shared across pre-linguistic human infants, adults, and\nother primates. These include the concept of object (taken as a sortal\nconcept that makes use of boundedness and spatio-temporal continuity\nin individuation), quantity, intentional agency, and causation. For\nfurther discussion of the debates about categorization in cognitive\nscience see Lakoff (1987) and Rakison and Oakes (2003). \nRecently, work on ontological categories has attracted interest not\nonly among philosophers, but also in information science and the\nbiomedical sciences, where ontologies are used to organize the\nknowledge represented in information systems (Smith 2003). In some\ncases, the ontologies developed are domain-specific (e.g. specific to\nmedical information, geographic information, etc.), but there has also\nbeen a great deal of interest in developing a ‘top-level’\nontology of maximally general categories applicable to all specific\ndomains and enabling data sharing across systems. It is such top-level\nontologies that draw upon philosophical work on ontological categories\nmost directly, although categorial distinctions also play a crucial\nrole in domain-specific ontologies. Both sorts of philosophical work\non categorization promise to have a wide variety of practical\napplications to information management that are just beginning to be\nexplored (see Sowa 1995, Munn & Smith (eds.) 2008) \n\nMuch recent work on categories has been influenced by skepticism about\nthe possibility of offering a system of ontological categories.\nDifficulties like those mentioned above have undermined the idea that\na uniquely true and comprehensive system of ontological categories can\nbe found. The skepticism that comes from noting the proliferation of\ncategory systems is compounded by general skepticism about\nmetaphysics. In some cases this has come from imputations of logical\npositivists that all metaphysical talk is nonsense. More recently, the\nskepticism has arisen from general doubts about the epistemology of\nmetaphysics (Bennett 2009, Kriegel 2013, Thomasson 2015), as well as\nmore specific doubts that we can make sense of the idea that the world\nhas a distinctly ‘ontological structure’, or that if it\ndoes make sense, we could discover what that structure is. \nAs a result, while categories have continued to play a central role in\nanalytic philosophy in the past century, and while some have continued\nto pursue work on categories in the realist spirit, others have\nshifted their focus to identifying differences\nin semantic categories rather than drawing\nout systems of ontological categories.  Thus when\nGilbert Ryle (1949, 1938 [1971]) talks of categories, he does not speak\ndirectly of categories of entities, but rather of differing logical\ntypes of concepts, where such type differences are detectable by the\nabsurdities that result from substituting in terms of one sort for\nterms of another in sentences of certain kinds (see §2.2\nbelow). Wilfrid Sellars, developing a strategy of Ockham’s,\nargues explicitly that we may construe category statements as\ndisguised metalinguistic statements about the role of certain\nexpressions (and their functional counterparts in other\nlanguages). According to Sellars, “Socrates is a\nsubstance”, for example, has the sense of “The\n·Socrates· is a basic mental singular term”, and\n“Yellow is a quality” has the sense of “The\n·yellow· is a (one-place) predicate (in\nmentalese)” (1970 [1974], 328) (where the\n“·___·” notation has the function of\nenabling us to speak about linguistic roles without being tied to a\nparticular natural language). As a result, we can replicate the work\ndone by traditional category distinctions between, e.g., substance and\nquality, without committing ourselves ontologically to the existence\nof qualities or other abstracta (1970 [1974], 329). \n\nThose who focus on articulating category distinctions rather than on\nlaying out complete systems of categories generally invoke categories\nnot in hopes of providing answers to such basic metaphysical questions\nas ‘what exists’, but rather as a way of exposing,\navoiding, or dissolving various presumed philosophical mistakes,\nconfusions, and paradoxes. \n\nThus, e.g., Russell and Whitehead introduced type theory (which\nmight in some sense be considered a theory of categories) to avoid a\ncertain form of paradox found in Fregean set theory (where we must\nconsider the putative set of all non-self membered sets, which is a\nmember of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself),\nliar’s paradoxes (“This sentence is false”, which is\ntrue if and only if it is false), etc. On their analysis, paradoxes\nlike these arise from the attempt to form an illegitimate totality by\ntrying to collect into a single totality a collection that has members\nthat presuppose the existence of the totality. To avoid such paradoxes,\nwe must accept that “Whatever involves all of a\ncollection must not be one of the collection” (1913 [1962], 37) and\nthus that such totalities (involving all of a collection) must be of a\nhigher type, making, e.g., classes of sets of a higher type than are\nsets of individuals, and so on, leading to an infinite hierarchy of\ntypes. The type-mixing paradox-generating claims are rejected as\nill-formed and meaningless (1913 [1962]). \n\nMost famously, Ryle (1949) introduced the idea of the category mistake\nas a way of dispelling the confusions he thought to be rampant in the\nCartesian theory of the mind, and thus of dissolving many apparent\nproblems in philosophy of mind. According to Ryle, one makes a\ncategory mistake when one mistakes the logical type or category of a\ncertain expression (1949, 16–17). Thus, e.g., a foreigner would\nmake a category mistake if he observed the various colleges,\nlibraries, and administrative offices of Oxford, and then asked to be\nshown the university. The foreigner mistakes the university for\nanother institution like those he has seen, when in fact it is\nsomething of another category altogether: “the way in which all\nthat he has already seen is organized” (1949, 16). The category\nmistake behind the Cartesian theory of mind, on Ryle’s view, is\nbased in representing mental concepts such as believing, knowing,\naspiring, or detesting as acts or processes (and concluding they must\nbe covert, unobservable acts or processes), when the concepts of\nbelieving, knowing, and the like are actually dispositional (1949,\n33). Properly noting category distinctions may help alleviate a\nvariety of philosophical problems and perplexities, and the idea of\nthe category mistake was widely wielded (by Ryle and others) with this\naim. Ofra Magidor suggests that it is “far from clear what Ryle\ntook the central mistake in the dualistic position to be” (2013,\n10).  Jonah Goldwater (forthcoming), however, argues that, in The\nConcept of Mind, the category mistakes Ryle identifies all have\nthe form of mistakenly conjoining entities that belong in two\ndifferent categories – implicitly assigning their conjuncts to a\nshared category. But on Ryle’s view (Goldwater argues) there is\noften no single highest category (‘existent’) under which\nwe can subsume the conjoined entities, and so we cannot sensibly\nconjoin, count, or quantify over them together. This, Goldwater\nargues, not only clarifies the basis for Ryle’s critique of both\nCartesian and physicalist theories of mind, but also has the potential\nto dissolve various current debates in metaphysics, such as arguments\nagainst co-location that are based on denying (for example) that there\nis a statute and a lump both on the pedestal. \n\nAlong similar lines, Thomasson (2007) argues\nthat various mistakes and puzzlements in ontology can be traced to the\nmistaken use of category-neutral existential and quantificational\nclaims. A great many\narguments in ontology rely on claims about whether, in various\nsituations, there is some object present (or how many objects\nthere are), where the term ‘object’ must be used in a category-neutral\nway for the argument to go through (Thomasson 2007, 112–118). But if\nexistential and quantificational claims must tacitly\npresuppose some category or categories of entity over which we are\nquantifying, then such arguments go astray. Thomasson (2007) gives\nindependent grounds for thinking that all quantification must at least\ntacitly presuppose a category or categories of entity over which we\nare quantifying, and argues that adopting that view provides the\nuniform basis for dissolving a number of problems supposed to arise\nwith accepting an ontology of ordinary objects. \nWork on category distinctions is also relevant to debates in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language about what, exactly, a category\nmistake is, and why category mistakes are infelicitous. Ofra Magidor\n(2013) surveys past answers to the question of what makes a category\nmistake infelicitous, including: that they are syntactically\nill-formed, that they are meaningless, that they are meaningful but\nlacking in truth-value, and that they are (despite being well formed,\nmeaningful and having truth-value) pragmatically\ninappropriate. Magidor argues against the first three options, and\ndefends instead a presuppositional account of why sentences that seem\nto contain category mistakes are infelicitous. Roughly, on her view, a\nsentence like ‘Two is green’ triggers the presupposition\nthat two is colored – a presupposition that is difficult to\naccommodate (2013, 132). Thus, on her analysis, the sentence is\ninfelicitous, but still has a truth-value (it is false). \n\nWhile those who only make use of the idea of category differences\n(rather than purporting to offer a category system) have no need to\nworry about how to provide an exhaustive list of categories, they\nnonetheless owe an account of the conditions under which we can\nlegitimately claim that two entities, concepts, or terms are of\ndifferent categories, so that we know when a category mistake is (and\nis not) being made. Otherwise, they would face the charge of\narbitrariness or ad hocery in views about which categories\nthere are or where category differences lie. Yet there is little more\nagreement about the proper criteria for distinguishing categories than\nthere is about what categories there are. \n\nRyle famously considered absurdities to be the key to detecting\ncategory differences. But although Ryle made the method famous, he\napparently derived the idea from Husserl’s method of distinguishing\ncategories of meaning (cf. Ryle 1970, 8; Simons 1995, 120; Thomasson\n2002, 124–8, and §1.3 above). But while Husserl used\nsyntactic nonsense as a way of detecting differences in\ncategories of meaning (yielding different grammatical\ncategories), Ryle broadened the idea, taking absurdities more\nwidely conceived to be symptoms of differences in logical or\nconceptual categories (1938 [1971], 180). Thus, e.g., the\nstatement “She came home in a flood of tears and a\nsedan-chair” (Ryle 1949, 22) is perfectly well-formed\nsyntactically, but nonetheless Ryle classifies it as a sentence that\nis absurd, where the absurdity is a symptom of the fact that the\nsentence conjoins terms of different categories. \n\nIn his earlier paper “Categories”, Ryle describes the test\nfor category differences as follows: “Two proposition-factors\nare of different categories or types, if there are sentence-frames\nsuch that when the expressions for those factors are imported as\nalternative complements to the same gap-signs, the resultant sentences\nare significant in the one case and absurd in the other”\n(1938 [1971], 181) – in other words, two expressions (or rather:\nwhat they signify) differ in category if there are contexts in which\nsubstituting one expression for the other results in absurdity. This\ntest, of course, provides no way of establishing that two\nexpressions are of the same category (but only that they are\nnot), since there is an infinite number of sentence-frames, and one\nmay always yet be found that does not permit the substitution to be\nmade without absurdity. It also leaves open and merely intuitive the\nnotion of ‘absurdity’ itself; in fact, Ryle concludes his\npaper “Categories” with the question “But what are\nthe tests of absurdity?” (1938 [1971], 184). Ryle’s approach\nwas further developed, in a more formal fashion, by Fred Sommers\n(1959, 1971). \n\nJ. J. C. Smart (1953) criticized Ryle’s criterion for drawing\ncategory distinctions on grounds that it could apparently be used to\nestablish a category difference between any two expressions\nwhatsoever.  “Thus ‘the seat of the – is hard’\nworks if ‘chair’ or ‘bench’ is put into the\nblank, but not if ‘table’ or ‘bed’ is. And if\nfurniture words do not form a category, we may well ask what do”\n(1953, 227). Without a test for absurdity apart from a certain kind of\nintuitive unacceptability to native speakers, we seem to be left\nwithout a means of declaring ‘Saturday is in bed’ to be a\ncategory violation but ‘The seat of the bed is hard’ not\nto be. Bernard Harrison attempts to meet this challenge by\ndistinguishing the sorts of inappropriateness that result from\nviolations of category facts (such as the former) from those that\nresult from mere violations of facts of usage (the latter) (1965,\n315–16). The use of the term ‘bed’ could conceivably\nbe extended in ways that would make ‘The seat of the bed is\nhard’ acceptable (e.g., if beds came to be made with seats),\nwhereas ‘Saturday’ could not conceivably be extended in a\nway that would make ‘Saturday is in bed’\nacceptable – any such attempted ‘extension’ would just\ninvolve using ‘Saturday’ homonymously (e.g., as the name\nfor a day of the week and for a person) (1965, 316–18). For\nfurther discussion of intersubstitutability approaches to drawing\ncategory distinctions, see Westerhoff (2005, 40–59 and 2002,\n338–339). Westerhoff (2004) develops a method of distinguishing\ncategories based on substitutability in worldly states of affairs\nrather than language. \n\nFrege treats distinctions in categories as correlates of distinctions\nin types of linguistic expression. The category of object,\nfor example, is distinguished by reference to the linguistic category\nof proper name (Dummett 1973 [1981], 55–56; cf. Wright\n1983, 13 and Hale 1987, 3–4) – i.e., an object just is the\ncorrelate of a proper name, where proper names are held to include all\nsingular terms (including singular substantival phrases preceded by\nthe definite article). Broadly Fregean approaches have been more\nrecently developed and defended by Michael Dummett (1973 [1981]) and Bob\nHale (2010). \nHale develops and defends the Fregean idea that “the division of\nnon-linguistic entities into different types or categories [is]\ndependent upon a prior categorization of the types of expressions by\nmeans of which we refer to them” (2010, 403). As he develops the\nidea, to be an object is “to be the referent of\na possible singular term, to be a property is to be the\nreferent of a possible (first-level) predicate, and so on for\nother cases” (2010, 411). He also argues that this encourages a\ndeflationary approach to existence questions according to which we may\nargue for the existence of entities of a certain kind by simply\narguing “that there are true statements involving expressions of\nthe relevant kind” (2010, 406). \nDummett (1973 [1981]) also aims to develop and precisify a broadly\nFregean approach to category distinctions. Frege leaves the\ndistinction between so-called ‘proper names’ and other\nparts of speech merely intuitively understood, but Dummett argues\nthat, e.g., one could make a start at criteria for distinguishing\nproper names by requiring substitutability of terms while preserving\nthe well-formedness of a sentence (which, as we have seen in\n§1.3, also plays a role in Husserl’s distinction of meaning\ncategories), and while preserving the validity of various patterns of\ninference (where the latter requirement is needed to distinguish\nproper names from other substantival terms such as\n‘someone’ and ‘nobody’) (1973 [1981], 58 ff.).\n(For further refinements of these criteria, see Dummett (1973 [1981],\n61–73) and Hale (1987, Chapter 2).) \n\nIn line with Frege’s requirement (1884 [1968], §62) that names\nmust be associated with a criterion of identity, Dummett argues that an\nadditional test (beyond these formal tests) is needed to distinguish\ngenuine proper names (to which objects correspond) from other sorts of\nexpression: “Even though an expression passes the more formal\ntests we devised, it is not to be classified as a proper name, or\nthought of as standing for an object, unless we can speak of a\ncriterion of identity, determined by the sense of the expression, which\napplies to the object for which it stands” (1973 [1981], 79). \n\nThus once grammatical categories are distinguished, enabling us to\nthereby distinguish the logical category object by reference\nto the linguistic category of proper name, we can go on to\ndraw out category distinctions among objects. To avoid confusion,\nDummett calls the first range of distinctions (among logical\ncategories of objects, properties, relations, etc.) distinctions among\n‘types’ and the second range of distinctions (within the\ntype object) distinctions among ‘categories’\n(1973 [1981], 76). \n\nSince, as Dummett argues (in a point further developed in Lowe 1989\nand Wiggins 2001), proper names and sortal terms must be associated\nwith a criterion of identity that determines the conditions under\nwhich the term may be correctly applied again to one and the same\nthing (1973 [1981], 73–75), we may use the associated criteria of\nidentity in order to distinguish categories of objects referred\nto. All of those names and general sortal terms (usable in forming\ncomplex names) that share a criterion of identity are said to be terms\nof the same category, even if the criteria of application for\nthe associated sortals vary (1973 [1981], 546). Thus, e.g., the sortal\nterms ‘horse’ and ‘cow’ (similarly, names of\nhorses and cows) are terms of the same category, since they share the\nidentity criteria suitable for animals. \n\nAs Lowe (1989, 108–118) notes, this approach to categories blocks\ncertain reductivist moves in metaphysics. For, e.g., if sortal terms\nsuch as ‘person’ and ‘organism’ are associated\nwith different identity conditions, then those who seek to reductively\nidentify persons with biological organisms are involved in a category\nmistake. \n\nThe idea that category distinctions among objects may be drawn out in\nterms of the identity and/or existence conditions associated with\nterms of each category has recently gained popularity. Though they\ndiffer in details, versions of the approach have been utilized not\nonly by Frege, Dummett and Hale but also by Lowe (2006, 6) and\nThomasson (2007).  \nThis approach to drawing category distinctions among objects can avoid\nvarious potential problems and sources of skepticism. It is not subject\nto problems like those Smart raised for Ryle’s criterion, for\ndays of the week clearly have different identity conditions than do\npersons, whereas beds and chairs seem to share identity conditions\n(those suitable for artifacts). Such a method of drawing out categories\nalso is not subject to the sorts of skepticism raised above for\ncategory systems. Here there is no claim to provide an exhaustive list\nof categories, and for a principled reason: different categories may\ncome into discussion as long as nominative terms or concepts associated\nwith distinct identity conditions may be invented. \n\nFollowing this method also guarantees that the categories\ndistinguished are mutually exclusive, for it is a corollary of this\nposition that entities may be identified only if they are governed by\nthe same identity conditions (and meet those), so that it is ruled\nout a priori that one and the same entity could belong to two\nor more distinct categories, in violation of the mutual exclusivity\nrequirement. \n\nThis method of distinguishing categories also provides a principled\nway of answering some of the central questions for theories of\ncategories, including whether or not there is a single summum\ngenus, and what the relationship is between linguistic/conceptual\nand ontological categories. Such completely general terms as\n“thing” “entity” or “object”, on\nDummett’s view, are not genuine sortal terms, since they fail to\nprovide any criteria of identity. Thus clearly on this view (as on\nAristotle’s) there is no summum genus under which categories\nsuch as artifact, animal, etc. could be arranged as\nspecies, since (lacking criteria of identity) such candidate catch-all\nterms as ‘object’, ‘being’,\n‘entity’ and the like are not even sortal terms and so\ncannot be categorial terms. \n\nViews that, like the Rylean and Fregean approaches, distinguish categories by\nway of language, are sometimes criticized as\ncapable only of noting differences in category of certain linguistic\nexpressions. For why, it might be asked, should that have anything to\ntell us about differences in the categories of real things?  \n\nHale argues that there is no serious alternative to using types of\nexpression that aim at referring to entities of different types if we\nhope to characterize such basic logical categories (or types) as\nobject and property (2010, 408). For what it is to be an object or\nproperty evidently cannot be conveyed merely by ostension, nor by more\nsubstantive criteria, without being restrictive in ways that beg the\nquestion against various views of what objects or properties there\nare. Moreover, he argues that we can avoid making our (logical)\ncategories unduly dependent on what language we actually have by\ntreating objects and properties as correlates of possible,\nnot merely actual, expressions of the relevant sorts (2010, 411). \n\nDummett’s way of understanding categories of objects also opens the\nway for a reply to this objection. For Dummett argues that, without\nsome associated categorial concept, we cannot single out objects (even\nusing names or demonstratives) (1973 [1981], 571). Categorial concepts\nare necessary for us to single out ‘things’ at all, and\ncannot be derived from considering ‘things’ preidentified\nwithout regard to categories. (It would thus follow from this that\nJohansson’s idea that we could arrive at categories by\nabstraction from considering individual things would be\nwrong-headed.) On this view, then, categories not only may\nbut must be distinguished primarily by way of distinguishing\nthe identity conditions criterially associated with the proper use of\ndifferent sortal terms and names. If we cannot refer to, discover, or\nsingle out objects at all except by way of a certain categorial\nconception (providing application and identity conditions), then the\ncategorial differences in our sortal terms or names (marked by their\ndifferences in identity conditions) are\nipso facto, and automatically, category differences in the\nthings singled out by these terms – the possibility of a\n‘mistake’ here just does not arise, and the connection\nbetween the category of an expression used to refer to a given entity\nand the category of the entity referred to is ensured.","contact.mail":"amie.l.thomasson@dartmouth.edu","contact.domain":"dartmouth.edu"}]
