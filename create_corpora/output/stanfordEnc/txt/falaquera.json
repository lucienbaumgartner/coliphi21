Falaquera’s primary goal seems to have been to interest\nand educate his co-religionists in philosophy and science, both for\nits own sake and for the sake of understanding Scripture properly. In\nso doing, he made important contributions to the history of Jewish\nphilosophy.\n\n\n\nNot very much is known of Falaquera’s life, apart from his\nwritings. Most scholars believe that Falaquera was born and lived in\nSpain, but even this is not known with certainty (see Jospe, Torah\nand Sophia, 2–4). His approximate year of birth is\ncalculated from his comment in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh (9;\ntrans. 2), written in October-November 1263 (Heshvan 5024), that he\nhad passed the midpoint of seventy years and was approaching his\nfortieth year. His year of death is estimated from references in his\nlast known writing, the letter in defense of Maimonides’ Guide of\nthe Perplexed.  The “midpoint” of life, mentioned by\nFalaquera in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, may have had some\nsignificance for him. He explains there (11; trans. 5): \n\nWhether or not Falaquera himself went through some sort of mid-life\ncrisis, he tells us that his book is a “bill of\ndivorcement” from the poetry of his youth – an art in which,\nby his own account, he excelled and composed some 20,000 stanzas of\nrhymed verse, about half of which he wrote down. In the same breath he\nannounces his betrothal to wisdom, with the implication that a\nbigamous attachment to both poetry and wisdom is not desirable and\nshould not be tolerated. Falaquera’s new attitude toward poetry\nreflects the concern with this art shared by ancient and medieval\nphilosophers: Poetry is dangerous because it persuades men not by its\ncontent and its truth, but by its beauty and eloquence (on Falaquera’s\nattitude toward poetry, see Harvey, Falaquera’s Epistle,\n128–132). While Falaquera seems, for the most part, indeed to\nhave abandoned writing poetry, he was hardly faithful to her, even in\nhis youth. He openly acknowledges his flirtation with wisdom in\nSefer ha-Mevaqqesh, listing seven works that he calls\n“the progeny of my thoughts during my early years” (12;\ntrans., 7–8). It is hard to know how seriously to take such\nproclamations, although it is certainly true that Falaquera’s two\nlengthy philosophic works, the encyclopedic De‘ot\nha-Filosofim and his commentary on Maimonides’ Guide of\nthe Perplexed, are not listed among these writings. The latter\nwork was written in 1280 (5040) (Moreh ha-Moreh, 365), and is\none of his most mature writings. Steinschneider wrote of\nthis work that the “abundance of its citations was sufficient to\nconfer on those who copied from it the appearance of great\nerudition” (Hebraeischen Übersetzungen, 422), and\nthe same can be said regarding the De‘ot\nha-Filosofim. An additional point of interest for Falaquera’s\nbiography is his plaint in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh (11–12; trans.,\n7–8) of the “difficult times under the powerful hand of the\nnon-Jewish nations who prevailed over us.” This is a theme found\nin several of his works, and apparently the subject of his lost\nMegillat ha-Zikkaron. It is a stark reminder today of the\nbackground against which medieval Jewish thinkers such as Falaquera\nengaged in their writing and study. \n\nJospe makes a reasoned attempt at a chronology of Falaquera’s\nwritings, based in part on Falaquera’s listing in Sefer\nha-Mevaqqesh, but it is not completely convincing (Torah and\nSophia, 31–33). For example, it is not clear that\nFalaquera’s listing of books is itself chronological and\ncomplete. Moreover, it is possible that a reference in one book to\nanother may be a later addition and not necessarily an indication of\nwhich book was written first. An important factor that must be\nconsidered in any future attempt to fix the chronology of Falaquera’s\nwritings is the technical terms he uses and the wording of his\ntranslations from other authors. As Jospe himself points out in his\nbook, Falaquera paid great attention to terminology and chose his\nphilosophic terms carefully (18–29). He also, in the course of\nhis career, changed his preference for certain Hebrew words that\ntranslate key Arabic philosophic terms. This can be seen most clearly\nby comparing his different translations in different works of the same\nArabic passages. Consider, for example, Shelemut\nha-Ma‘asim, the first six chapters of which comprise an\nabridged Hebrew version of the Summa Alexandrinorum, an\nepitome of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. The language here\ndiffers from Falaquera’s citations from the Summa in his\nyouthful Sefer ha-Ma‘alot. On the other hand,\nFalaquera’s citations from the Summa in the Moreh\nha-Moreh seem to be drawn from his own Shelemut\nha-Ma‘asim. Thus the Sefer ha-Ma‘alot was\nwritten before the Shelemut ha-Ma‘asim, which was\nwritten before the Moreh ha-Moreh. \n\nScholars of the past century have, in general, been quick to dismiss\nFalaquera as a mediocre and unoriginal thinker, and thus hardly worthy\nof our attention. While it is no doubt true that Falaquera himself did\nnot seek originality, research of the past decades has shown him\nto be a remarkably industrious, well-read, and impressive scholar.\nMoreover, in certain respects, as we shall see, Falaquera was quite\noriginal. That Falaquera did not seek originality is clear from his\nown statements. For example, he writes in his introduction to\nReshit Hokhmah (9): \n\nWhat then was he trying to do in such compilations?  Falaquera’s\nagenda is clearly seen in his delightful little treatise, Iggeret\nha-Vikkuah (The Epistle of the Debate), whose subtitle is:\n“In Explanation of the Agreement that Exists between the Law and\nWisdom.” At the outset of this treatise he makes known that its\npurpose is “to explain that the study of the true sciences by\nwhoever is worthy of them and whom God in his mercy has favored with\nan intellect to discover their depths is not prohibited from the point\nof view of our Law, and that the truth hidden in them does not\ncontradict a word of our belief” (56; trans., 14–15)\nUnlike the first two great Jewish Aristotelian philosophers of the\ncentury before him, Abraham Ibn Daud and Maimonides, who sought in the\nintroductions to their philosophico-theological works to dissuade the\nunworthy from reading on, Falaquera wished to awaken his\nco-religionists to the importance of philosophy. Falaquera, like his\ndistinguished predecessors, realized that philosophy is not for\neveryone. He explicitly stated that it “is not necessary for all\nmen, but for the one who is meticulous in his faith and endeavors to\nascend the rank of the perfect man and to conceive what he conceives\nby way of the intellect, not by way of the imagination. As for the\nothers who do not perceive this degree, tradition without their\nknowing the reason is sufficient” (65; trans., 29). Yet, there\nis a definite sense that Falaquera believed that philosophy could be\nof benefit to a far greater percentage of Jews than Ibn Daud or\nMaimonides thought. His Iggeret ha-Vikkuah, which is intended\nas an introduction to philosophy, provides a good indication of\nthis. It is a dialogue between a scholar and a pietist, both observant\nJews, in which the scholar – who investigates the secrets of\nwisdom and studies the philosophic books – tries to persuade the\npietist – who considers such books a stumbling-block and cause of\nheresy and therefore forbidden – of the permissibility and\ndesirability of philosophic study. The pietist is not perplexed and\nwould certainly not be considered by Maimonides among the few for whom\nhe intended the Guide, yet he is the type of reader Falaquera\nseeks to win over to philosophy. There may have been an additional\nreason for Falaquera’s interest in persuading the pietist. Falaquera\nwrote during the respite between the Maimonidean controversy of the\n1230s and the controversy that culminated in 1305 with the ban issued\nby Solomon ibn Adret against the study of Greek philosophy and science\nby anyone under the age of twenty-five. In writing the Iggeret\nha-Vikkuah, he was influenced by the epistolary debate of the\nformer controversy between David Kimhi and Judah Alfakhar, and\napparently sought in his dialogue to have his scholar accomplish what\nKimhi and the other Maimonideans could not. Perhaps he hoped that if\nhe could counter in his debate the real objections of the\nanti-Maimonideans with sensitive convincing responses, he could\npersuade future anti-rationalists of the religious importance of\nphilosophy and the sciences and that the study of them was permissible\nand required of those who had the intellectual ability to undertake it\n(Harvey, “Maimonidean Controversy of the 1230s”). If he\nwished thereby to prevent future such controversies, he did not\nsucceed (cf. in this connection, his much later Mikhtav ‘al\nDevar ha-Moreh, in defense of Maimonides’ Guide). In any\ncase, by the end of the dialogue, the scholar indeed convinces the\npietist, and promises to write for him three books: Reshit\nHokhmah, Sefer ha-Ma‘alot, and De‘ot\nha-Filosofim. Falaquera in fact wrote this trilogy. These works\ncondense into three volumes the finest writings of the Greco-Islamic\nphilosophic tradition and offer the Hebrew reader a rich program of\neducation, beginning with a classification of the sciences and\nculminating with an encyclopedia of Aristotelian natural science and\nmetaphysics. For Falaquera, philosophy and science are necessary for a\ncomplete and true understanding of the Divine Law and for the\nattainment of ultimate human felicity. His goal in the trilogy seems\nto have been to interest his fellow Jews in philosophy and science and\nthen to educate them by making available to them the choicest fruits\nof the philosophic tradition in a form and language they could\nunderstand.  The Iggeret ha-Vikkuah was one attempt at\nleading his readers to philosophy and the path to perfection. Another\nattempt – quite well known to students of Hebrew\nliterature – whose maqâmah form bespeaks the\nauthor’s desire to reach a wide audience and popularize philosophy,\nwas his Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, the tale of a young man’s search\nfor wisdom.  The search concludes with the seeker’s encounter with a\nphilosopher. \n\nFalaquera sought to make available in Hebrew the most important\nwritings of the Greek and Islamic philosophers. Interestingly,\nFalaquera rarely simply translated a text and rarely identified his\nprecise source. A good illustration of this is Falaquera’s Reshit\nHokhmah. His intention in this book is to treat concisely\n“whatever the seeker of wisdom needs to apprehend at the\nbeginning of his studies” (9). He divides it into three parts.\nPart one is on the moral virtues, for as Falaquera explains,\n“Whoever wishes to engage in the study of science and to\napprehend its truth must begin to accustom himself to the moral\nvirtues” (10). This part blends Biblical verses and rabbinic\nsayings with short passages from the Summa Alexandrinorum and\nconcludes with a pseudo-Aristotelian letter.  The second part is an\nenumeration of the sciences, which is primarily an abridged version of\nAlfarabi’s Ihsâ’ al-‘ulûm\n(Enumeration of the Sciences), but also incorporates other writings by\nAlfarabi such as his Kitâb al-hurûf (Book of\nLetters) and small sections from Avicenna’s Fî aqsâm\nal-‘ulûm al-‘aqliyyah (On the Division of the\nRational Sciences).  Falaquera integrates these texts into his version\nof Alfarabi’s enumeration of the sciences in order to make a new\ncoherent work, which provides important material not present in his\nprimary text. Thus, for example, chapters 2 and 4 from part 2 of\nReshit Hokhmah, “On How Language Originates in a\nNation” and “On How the Sciences Originate among\nMen” – the two selections from the Kitâb\nal-hurûf – introduce respectively chapters 3 on\nlanguage and chapters 5–9 on logic and the sciences – chapters \ntranslated from Ihsâ’\nal-‘ulûm. For another example, a section on\npolitical science from Avicenna’s division of the sciences follows the\nparallel discussion in Alfarabi, and provides the reader with the\ntraditional Aristotelian division of practical science into governance\nof the city, governance of the household, and governance of oneself or\nethics. Part 3 of Reshit Hokhmah, on explaining that\nphilosophy is necessary for the attainment of true happiness, is an\nabridged translation of Alfarabi’s trilogy on the philosophy of Plato\nand Aristotle. In this part, Falaquera focuses on the Alfarabian texts\nhe is presenting and incorporates no other texts, but through a\njudicious choice of what to translate and what not, Falaquera is able\nto adapt the works to suit his own purposes. Thus, he omits from his\nparaphrase Alfarabi’s controversial statements on the relation between\nphilosophy and religion, such as those that suggest that philosophy\nalone is necessary for human happiness and perfection, and\nthat religion is an imitation of philosophy that is useful for\nteaching and governing the multitude, but does not contribute to the\nperfection of the philosopher’s intellect (see Harvey,\n“Falaquera’s Alfarabi”). Another aspect of Falaquera’s\nparaphrasing of texts is his occasional Judaizing of his sources\nthrough the insertion of Biblical or Talmudic citations and references\nor the addition of Jewish material. An example of the latter is in the\nbeginning of Reshit Hokhmah, part 2, where he adds to\nAlfarabi’s list of benefits of an enumeration of sciences that it\nmakes clear that these sciences do not contradict the Torah and that\nit is permissible for Jews to study them. It may be added that\nFalaquera’s Hebrew abridgements of Alfarabi’s books in parts two and\nthree are not attributed to their author; Falaquera simply explains\nthat all “these words on the sciences are the words of Aristotle\nor those philosophers of his school” (61).  Falaquera’s\nselective translation of texts and his not mentioning his sources give\nhim the leeway to alter the content and message of those texts in ways\nthat are not possible for faithful translators. \n\nWhile in books like Reshit Hokhmah (particularly parts 2 and\n3), Falaquera basically pieces together abridged versions of books by\nothers without mentioning their names, the Sefer\nha-Ma‘alot – the book that follows Reshit\nHokhmah in the trilogy – is filled with numerous short\nquotations, most of which are attributed to an author, such as Plato,\nAristotle (although often in connection with citations from the\nSumma Alexandrinorum and the Pseudo-Aristotle, Theology\nof Aristotle), Alfarabi, and Maimonides, or to the Philosopher\n(by which he usually means Ibn Bâjjah) or to the Scholar (by\nwhich he usually means Averroes). This work is also replete with\nquotations from the Bible and rabbinic literature \n\nFalaquera’s use of his sources is a bit different in his\nDe‘ot ha-Filosofim, one of the first Hebrew\nencyclopedias of science and philosophy, and the third book of the\ntrilogy. Falaquera states his goals and methods in his encyclopedia in\nhis introduction. \n\nFalaquera’s goal in the encyclopedia, his longest work, was to make\npossible the serious study of the sciences by his fellow Jews. The\nencyclopedia is divided into two parts, one on the natural beings and\none on the divine ones. The first part basically follows the\ntraditional order of Aristotle’s books on natural science. When\nFalaquera writes that there “is not a word in this entire\ncomposition that I say of my own,” he is hardly\nexaggerating. His main source in the work is usually the middle\ncommentaries of Averroes or his epitomes when the middle commentaries\nwere not available. These texts are often translated literally, but\nwith no hesitation to abridge them and to blend them with other\nsources, in particular other commentaries by Averroes, for the sake of\nclarification or completeness. Short passages from other works and\nother authors are inserted when it suits Falaquera’s purposes. But\napart from connecting phrases, references to other parts of the book,\nand occasional attributions, there is indeed hardly a word that is\nFalaquera’s own. It is thus remarkable that Falaquera was often able\nto improve upon his sources and even intentionally part from them\nsolely through his combining of texts. It has been shown, for example,\nthat “by advisedly and creatively combining [Averroes’]\ncommentaries [on the Meteorology],” Falaquera was able\nto present an account of Aristotle’s teachings clearer than that of\neither of Averroes’ commentaries [Fontaine, “Why Is the Sea\nSalty?” 213–218], and that by inserting a brief passage\nfrom Avicenna into his abridged paraphrase of Averroes’ Epitome of\nthe Parva naturalia, he was able to provide a response to\nAverroes’ argument therein that theoretical knowledge cannot be\nacquired in dreams [Harvey, “Falaquera’s De‘ot\nha-Filosofim,” 232–233]. Other such examples abound, but\ncan usually be detected only through a careful comparison of the\nencyclopedia with its sources. Falaquera’s intended reader, who did\nnot know Arabic, would thus have been unaware of his skill and\nparticular goals in weaving together his sources, but this would not\nhave bothered Falaquera. He had a far greater goal in mind. The\nDe‘ot ha-Filosofim presents the reader with an\nambitious and comprehensive account of Aristotelian science and\nphilosophy, indeed the first full in-depth treatment of Aristotelian\nscience in Hebrew. \n\nReference has been made to Falaquera’s Moreh ha-Moreh, one of\nthe first commentaries on Maimonides’ Guide of the\nPerplexed. The commentary is not on the entire book, but on only\na little over a quarter of its chapters. Yet Maimonides had urged\nreaders of the Guide “not to comment upon a single word\nof it and not to explain to another anything in it.” Falaquera\nwas aware of this plea, but also knew that people were already\nmisreading and misinterpreting the text. His own commentary is the\nfirst scholarly study of Maimonides’ philosophic sources, a topic that\ncontinues to engage scholars to this day. The knowledge of these\nsources – usually cited by Falaquera by name or epithet –\nand Maimonides’ agreement or disagreement with them is essential for a\nproper understanding of the Guide. Like the\nDe‘ot ha-Filosofim, most of the\ncommentary is pieced together from translated passages from other\nworks, although here in the commentary he allows himself to comment,\nusually briefly and in his own name, on these passages. In addition to\ntranslating these sources, Falaquera retranslated his selections from\nthe Guide. \n\nIt is noteworthy that Falaquera speaks explicitly in his own name in\nthe commentary, but rarely in most of his other works. Shiffman\ncharacterizes Falaquera in the commentary as a “critical thinker\nwho does not hesitate to disagree with those he cites, accepting only\nthose opinions which he considers philosophically sound”\n(“Falqerah As Interpreter,” 7 [219]). On occasion\nFalaquera disagrees with and even criticizes Maimonides. At times the\nsources cited by Falaquera strengthen Maimonides’ views and at\ntimes they part from them. In one instance, in his commentary\non Guide I, 68, Falaquera uncharacteristically adds a word\n(ha-maskil, the intellecting Subject) in his citation of the\nArabic translation of Metaphysics Λ, perhaps in order\nfor it to agree exactly with Maimonides’ statement with\nreference to God that He is Intellect, intellecting Subject, and\nObject of intellection [Harvey, “Notes on Maimonides’\nFormulations”]. The idea to explain the Guide and its\nteachings through citations of Maimonides’ possible sources is\nthe great innovation of the commentary. Usually these passages speak\nfor themselves with only short comments added by Falaquera.\nOccasionally he is more verbose, but even when not, there is a sense\nthat he is considering the passage at hand carefully to determine to\nwhat extent Maimonides followed its teachings and to what extent he\nhimself should. This is one of Falaquera’s last writings and\nlikely the most useful of his books for discerning his own views on\ntheological-philosophical matters, such as creation from eternal\nmatter; God’s will; the negation of corporeality, privation, and\npotentiality with regard to God; the nature of prophecy; the\npossibility of conjunction with the Active Intellect; and the ultimate\nand intermediate causes in nature, will, and chance. \n\nFalaquera in his various writings shows great familiarity with the\nBible and rabbinic literature. It is possible to understand quite a\nbit from these books on how Falaquera read the Bible. In general,\nFalaquera repeatedly states that he views the Torah as a source of\ntruth, and that its teachings are in accord with the true teachings of\nphilosophy and science for which there are demonstrative proofs. In\nother words, if the Torah seems to contradict something that has been\nproven demonstratively, the passage in the Torah needs to be\ninterpreted.  Indeed, for Falaquera, philosophy is at times necessary\nfor the correct interpretation of Scripture. The correct\ninterpretation of it is not always apparent, but philosophy can help\nus to uncover it. Moreover, for Falaquera, Scripture is replete with\nscientific teachings and allusions (Iggeret ha-Vikkuah,\n69–71; trans., 34–37). On the other hand, he never tires of\nreiterating in almost all his works that if a statement of the\nphilosophers contradicts something from the Torah, we reject it. A\nclose examination of Falaquera’s proof texts in his various writings\nreveals his methods of Biblical interpretation. For example, the\nallegorical interpretation of Prov.  27:26 and Song of Songs 4:11 as\nreferring to the need to conceal certain profound matters from the\nmany (Iggeret ha-Vikkuah, 74; trans., 42); or the reading of\nJer. 9:22 as referring to man’s confusing the pseudo-perfections for\nthe true one (Reshit Hokhmah, 72); or the understanding of\nProv. 25:5 as teaching that man needs divine help in order to attain\nthe truth (Iggeret ha-Halom, 488); or simply taking\nPs. 31:20, 27:13, and 69:29 to each be referring to man’s eternal life\n(Sefer ha-Ma‘alot, 15). \n\nA clearer picture of Falaquera as an exegete may be drawn from the\nrecent editions and translations of extant passages from his lost\ncommentaries on the Bible (Jospe, Torah and Sophia,\n468–484, and Jospe and Schwartz, “Falaquera’s Lost Bible\nCommentary,” 186–200). \n\nHere one can see Falaquera’s focus on understanding the meaning of\ncertain equivocal terms in Scripture; on explicating certain ambiguous\nterms; on providing scientific explanations of certain terms; on\npointing out that certain verses must be taken metaphorically; and on\nsuggesting the inner meaning (‘inyan penimi) when\nappropriate. At times Falaquera strove to understand and explain the\nliteral meaning of the verse, while at other times he sought to\nuncover its allegorical interpretation and secret meaning. \n\nShem-Tov Falaquera sought to interest his fellow Jews in philosophy\nand science and to make available to them in Hebrew the most important\nteachings of the ancient Greek and medieval Islamic philosophers. As\nis clear from his encyclopedia of science, he was an Aristotelian, and\nlike virtually all post-Maimonidean Jewish Aristotelians, his two\nleading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides.\nNonetheless, he had an open mind and seems to have been influenced\nalso by Neoplatonic writings. This is most evident from his decision\nto prepare Hebrew versions of Ibn Gabirol’s Fons vitae and\nPseudo-Empedocles’ Five Substances, and from his many\ncitations from Ibn Gabirol in his Moreh ha-Moreh (see\nShiffman’s intro., 83–85). He knew the works of the Islamic\nfalâsifah better than any Jewish thinker of his time,\nand made many of them available to the Hebrew reader – often\nwithout attribution (as in Reshit Hokhmah); yet he was not\nhesitant to modify unobtrusively their texts when it suited his\npurposes. In this way, for example, he turned Alfarabi’s account of\nthe origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of\nthe virtuous city (Harvey, “Falaquera’s Alfarabi,”\n104–109). \n\nFalaquera did not seek originality, yet was quite creative in his\npresentation of philosophy and science. He was, for example, one of\nthe first Hebrew authors to write a philosophic dialogue, an\nencyclopedia of science and philosophy, a commentary on the Guide\nof the Perplexed, and poetic philosophic tales. His method of\nseamlessly blending various philosophic texts together to form a\ncoherent whole is perhaps unique to him. But the fact is that his most\nimportant works are comprised of Hebrew versions of the writings of\nothers. We have seen that his personal views on\ntheological-philosophical matters may be discerned from his Moreh\nha-Moreh, particularly when he speaks in his own name. Yet even\nin his earlier works, he often asserted his personal views, but he\nusually let his sources do the talking. When proper care is taken in\nthe study of these works not to jump to conclusions regarding his\nviews on the basis of his translations, it is possible to uncover his\nown theology. The role played by his occasional critical comments in\nhis commentary is played by the selection, blending, and abridgment of\nsources in the earlier works. The theology derived from such careful\nstudy of his translations and from his commentary may not always\naccord completely with that expressed in his more popular independent\ntreatises (such as the Iggeret ha-Vikkuah and Iggeret\nha-Halom), where he explicitly maintains the existence and unity\nof God, His knowledge of particulars, His providence over human\nindividuals, His creation of the world, divine prophecy, miracles,\nreward and punishment, and eternal life, which is the World to\nCome. Scholars will no doubt debate his views on particular topics,\nbut the thinker who emerges from virtually all his writings is a\nmoderate Maimonidean, committed to the essential harmony between the\ntrue teachings of Torah and those of philosophy. \n\nThe problem of creation of the world is a good illustration of a topic\nwhere Falaquera seems to convey different opinions in different\nworks. In his popular introductory works, Falaquera writes that among\nthe true opinions of the Torah is that God “brought into\nexistence the rest of the existents from non-existence”\n(Iggeret ha-Halom, 489), that it is the “root of the\nTorah to believe that there is a Creator of the world … and He\nbrought into existence all the created beings from nothing, and to\nbelieve that the world is produced and is not eternal”\n(Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, 65), and that while most of the\nphilosophers disagree with our beliefs concerning creation, some of\nthem actually do “believe in the production [of the world], but\nnot in the way that we believe in it” (Iggeret\nha-Vikkuah, 77; trans., 46). He thus seems to propound a view of\ncreation ex nihilo, while acknowledging that most\nphilosophers believe in eternity, although some believe in creation,\nbut in a way different than we do, that is perhaps, creation from\neternal matter. Falaquera does state in these works that knowledge of\nthe true sciences is needed to comprehend the secrets of the Torah\n(e.g., Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, 70–72).  One could wonder that if\nknowledge of philosophy and science is necessary for understanding the\nsecrets of the Torah and if creation is one of these secrets, why the\nphilosophers do not believe in it “in the way that we believe in\nit.” In the Moreh ha-Moreh, Falaquera clearly states\nthat among the divine secrets is “how God, may He be exalted,\ncreated the created beings” (116). In this commentary, perhaps\nof all Falaquera’s writings the least likely to be read by the\nmultitude, he reveals his own opinion that the world is not created\nfrom nothing. His precise view is debated, but he seems to hold that\nthe world is created from eternal matter, a view that Maimonides had\nascribed to Plato. In his introduction, he suggests that Plato’s view\nthat the world is created and never destroyed derives from the Sages,\nbut since the Sages knew the true interpretation of the Torah, this\nwould seem to mean that Plato’s view was the true one (117). Later in\nthe commentary, he repeats this view and writes that it appears to him\nthat “Plato’s opinion inclines toward the opinion of our holy\nTorah” (259, on Guide II, 13). A bit later in the\nchapter he writes explicitly (261): \n\nIn other words, Falaquera in the context of his commentary on\nMaimonides’ Guide reveals his own view on creation of the\nworld, one of the secrets of the Torah. This view differs from the one\ncommonly held in the Jewish community of his time, which he himself\ncalled a root and true opinion of the Torah in his more popular works.\nThe view presented in the commentary – for Falaquera, the true\ninterpretation of the teaching of the Torah and a precise formulation\nof it – still speaks of God’s creation, not ex nihilo,\nbut rather after non-existence (ahar\nha-he‘der) or after privation of form. In other words, it\nappears that for Falaquera, creation is through informing prime matter\n(cf. Shiffman, “Falqerah As Interpreter,” 7–14\n[220]). This interpretation of Falaquera’s teaching is strengthened by\nhis explanation of ‘creation’ (beri‘ah) in\nhis Commentary on the Torah: “The word\n‘creation’ teaches creation of the substance and quiddity\nof the thing, through which it is what it is … for the giving\nof the spirit to the bodies of this world is called\n‘creation’. … [God] gives all creatures substantive\nform, that is, specific form, by which the thing is distinguished from\nsomething else” (Jospe, Torah and Sophia, 468). For\nFalaquera then, some of the philosophers do share a view of creation\nof the world precisely “in the way that we believe in\nit.” \n\nThe importance of Falaquera for the history of philosophy is not,\nhowever, in his personal beliefs regarding theological-philosophical\nsubjects. It is rather in his broad and profound knowledge of the\nteachings of the ancient and medieval philosophers, his mastery of\ntheir science, his commitment to the ultimate accord between their\ntrue teachings and the correctly interpreted teachings of the Torah,\nand his life-long effort to interest his fellow Jews in science and\nphilosophy and to make their teachings available to them. To\naccomplish his goals, as we have seen, Falaquera, perhaps more than\nany other medieval Jewish philosopher, employed a wide variety of\ndifferent literary forms (see further, Hughes and\nRobinson 2019).","contact.mail":"steven.harvey@biu.ac.il","contact.domain":"biu.ac.il"}]
