It is concerned with analyzing the various entities in\nthe world that arise from social interaction.\n\n\nA prominent topic in social ontology is the analysis of social groups.\nDo social groups exist at all? If so, what sorts of entities are they,\nand how are they created? Is a social group distinct from the\ncollection of people who are its members, and if so, how is it\ndifferent? What sorts of properties do social groups have? Can they\nhave beliefs or intentions? Can they perform actions? And if so, what\ndoes it take for a group to believe, intend, or act?\n\n\nOther entities investigated in social ontology include money,\ncorporations, institutions, property, social classes, races, genders,\nartifacts, artworks, language, and law. It is difficult to delineate a\nprecise scope for the field (see\n section 2.1).\n In general, though, the entities explored in social ontology largely\noverlap with those that social scientists work on. A good deal of the\nwork in social ontology takes place within the social sciences (see\n sections 5.1–5.8).\n \n\nSocial ontology also addresses more basic questions about the nature\nof the social world. One set of questions pertains to the\nconstituents, or building blocks, of social things in general. For\ninstance, some theories argue that social entities are built out of\nthe psychological states of individual people, while others argue that\nthey are built out of actions, and yet others that they are built out\nof practices. Still other theories deny that a distinction can even be\nmade between the social and the non-social.\n\n\nA different set of questions pertains to how social categories are\nconstructed or set up. Are social categories and kinds produced by our\nattitudes? By our language? Are they produced by causal patterns? And\nis there just one way social categories are set up, or are there many\nvarieties of social construction?\n\n\nThe term ‘social ontology’ has only come into wide\ncurrency in recent years, but the nature of the social has been a\ntopic of inquiry since ancient Greece. As a whole, the field can be\nunderstood as a branch of metaphysics, the general inquiry into the\nnature of entities.\n\n\n\n\nThe following short discussion mentions some key themes and\ninnovations in the history of social ontology. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of historical developments in social ontology as well as\nreferences, see the supplementary document:\n Social ontology: History. \nAncient inquiries into the nature of social phenomena introduced\nquestions that remain active today: Which features of the world are\nproducts of humans or society, and which are products of nature? What\ndoes it mean to say that something is a social creation? A central\nconcern of Sophism, a school of Greek philosophy in the fifth century\nBCE, was the contrast between nature (phusis) and custom,\nlaw, habit, or convention (nomos). In particular, they\ndebated the sources of justice, law, and language: are these rooted in\nphusis or in nomos? \nAncient philosophers explored the mix between natural and human\ncontributions in the construction of familiar features of the world.\nThey did not, however, theorize much about exactly what\npeople do in order to create the social world. Instead, they wrote of\nagreements, compacts, conventions, habits, laws, customs, and so on,\nwithout paying particular notice to separating these from one another.\nIn the early modern period, theories of these sources broadened\nconsiderably, as did the variety of social phenomena being\ninvestigated. Approaches developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies include: Social entities as products of covenants: Hobbes, in\nLeviathan (1651), argues that a stable commonwealth is generated by\ncovenants among all the people in a society. Hobbes’s analysis\nis reflexive: the people who institute the commonwealth are those who\nare members of the commonwealth. Hobbes analyzes covenants in terms of\nagreements, and also provides an analysis of agreement, a crucial part\nof which is to explain what makes agreements binding. Social entities as products of convention: As an\nalternative to ‘compact’ or ‘agreement,’ the\nlegal theorist Samuel Pufendorf, in De Officio Hominis et\nCivis (1673), uses\nthe term ‘convention’ as the basis for law and language.\nHe argues that conventions do not need to be explicitly formed or\nagreed to. Instead, we can have tacit conventions—i.e.,\nconventions that we may not even be aware we have. Hume greatly\nadvances the analysis of convention and of social phenomena in terms\nof it (Hume 1740). He expands the scope of convention to include a\nwide variety of social entities—not only law, property, and\nlanguage, but also money, government, justice, and promises. Social entities as products of God and Nature: Other\nearly modern philosophers root the social world in the\nnatural—both in divine commandment and in human nature. Robert\nFilmer, a seventeenth century monarchist, argues in\nPatriarcha (1680) that the state is a family. This implies, according to\nFilmer, that state authority is no different from the authority of a\nfather over his family. Locke’s Two Treatises on\nGovernment (1689)\nsharply criticize Filmer and provide a competing analysis, though\nLocke, too, sees God and nature as the sources of the state and of\nproperty. Locke rejects Filmer’s comparison of the state with a\nfamily, arguing instead that political authority has its source in the\nnatural rights of each individual created equally.  Social entities as products of the individual mind:\nLocke’s theory of “nominal essence” is important for\na number of contemporary approaches to social ontology, even though\nLocke does not himself associate nominal essences with the social\nworld in particular. A nominal essence is a definition of a species or\nsort of thing, which people assemble in their minds out of ideas.\nIndividuals generate these definitions when they observe things in the\nworld and classify them according to their apparent similarities.\nNominal essences, in Locke’s approach, are generated\nmentalistically: they are formed from the association of ideas in the\nmind. Moreover, they are generated individualistically: a nominal\nessence defined by any given person is fully defined by that\nperson’s own mental states. \nIn Locke’s work, we also see the foundations for a new inquiry\nthat blossomed in the eighteenth century—not into the\nsources of social phenomena, but into their\nconstituents or building blocks. (See also sections\n 2.3,\n 3, and\n 4\n for contemporary theories of constituents vs. sources of social\nentities.) \nAdvances in science and interest in political governance led theorists\nto draw analogies between the traditional domains of\nscience—such as heavenly bodies, chemicals, and\norganisms—and the newly salient domains of economies and\nsocieties. The push to develop a science of society motivates a\ndifferent emphasis in social ontology, as compared to earlier\ntheories. Whereas ancient and early modern theorists largely\ninvestigated the sources or generators of social entities, these\ntheorists devoted more attention to analyzing social entities into\ntheir constituent parts. \nPhilosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment argue that social order\narises from aggregates of individuals interacting with one another,\neven if the individuals did not plan the order. “Nations stumble\non establishments”, Ferguson 1767 writes, “which are\nindeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human\ndesign”. Later attempts to develop a rigorous science of the\nsocial world also employ a similar picture of the components of\nsociety. J.S. Mill builds on Comte 1830–1842 to argue that\nsocial science is a branch of psychology. Society, according to Mill,\nis the aggregate of human minds, and the topic of the social sciences\nis to derive laws governing such aggregates. (Mill 1843) Altogether,\nhis approach to social phenomena is “psychologistic”: he\ntakes social phenomena to be built exclusively out of psychological\nstates of individual people. (The interpretation and expansion of\npsychologism becomes an important topic in twentieth century\nindividualism; see sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2.) \nThe historicist tradition in eighteenth and nineteenth century German\nphilosophy inverts the relation between individuals and societies.\nRather than seeing individuals as primary, these philosophers stress\nthe primacy of societies, with individuals a product of the societies\nin which they are brought up. Hegel argues that even\nself-consciousness is not something that an individual can possess\nindependently of others. Instead, it depends on our having a sense of\nourselves as individuals as distinct from others, which in turn\ndepends on mutual interactions (Hegel 1807). Hegel also develops the\nidea, following Hölderlin, of a “World-Soul” or\nuniversal human spirit, of which individual actions are a\nmanifestation. Hegel’s universal spirit is sometimes used as an\nexample of “ontological holism”—i.e., the claim that\nsocial entities are fundamental, independent, or autonomous entities,\nas opposed to being derived from individuals or non-social\nentities. \nNineteenth century criminologists, including Taine 1887, Ferri 1884,\nSighele 1891, and Le Bon 1895 investigated mental properties of\ncrowds, such as impetuousness and irrationality. Tarde 1890 postulated\nmechanisms by which crowds acquire these characteristics, by way of\nthe psychology of individuals and interactions among people. Durkheim\n1894 challenged these explanations, arguing that such individualistic\nlaws cannot be adequate to explain crowd psychology or other social\nphenomena. Durkheim argues that “social facts” are\nautonomous of individuals and have the power to constrain and affect\ntheir actions. In social ontology, Tarde is often seen as a\nrepresentative of “individualism” and Durkheim of\n“holism” regarding the social world, and their positions\nremain a touchstone for contemporary debates (see\n section 3). \nNineteenth-century social criticism reopened the question of the\nsources of social categories. Philosophers scrutinized commonplace\ncategories—often ones that we employ in our daily\npractices—revealing that they have darker (or at least richer)\nunderpinnings than we realize. Their approaches raise questions about\nthe motivations for using these categories, as well as their nature\nand metaphysical sources. \nIn a section of Capital titled “The Fetishism of\nCommodities and the Secret Thereof”, Karl Marx argues that\ncertain social categories that might appear natural are in fact the\nproducts of social and economic relations among people (Marx 1867).\nSubsequent philosophers put claims of the constructedness of social\nentities at the center of social critique. Lukács 1923 argues\nthat capitalism extensively “reifies” social\nentities—that is, it turns phenomena that arise from an\noppressive economic system into features of the world that we regard\nas natural. \nFriedrich Nietzsche employs a historical or “genealogical”\nmethod in On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) to critique the basic\ncategories of Christian morality. Challenging the idea that this\nmorality is basic to human nature, he argues that prevailing moral\ncategories were tools intentionally wielded in a struggle for power.\nIdeals of humility and self-denial, for instance, were introduced by\nleaders of a resentful population to undermine the aristocratic values\nof Greco-Roman society. In Nietzsche’s account, the sources of\nsuch categories are largely cognitive and intentional, as opposed to\narising from material relations, as they do in Marx’s\naccount. \nMembers of the Frankfurt School, especially Theodor Adorno and Max\nHorkheimer, draw on Marx and Nietzsche to argue not just that the\nsocial world becomes “second nature” to us, but that our\ncurrent social order is maintained, at least in part, by the causal\neffects of our treating social entities and categories as if they were\nnatural (Adorno & Horkheimer 1947, Adorno 1966). Uncovering social\ncategories becomes a centerpiece of subsequent social criticism. If\noppressive structures are to be dismantled, the social nature of the\neveryday world first needs to be revealed. The work of the Frankfurt\nSchool in particular is influential in contemporary feminist and race\ntheory (see\n section 5.4). \nSocial ontology is the study of social entities and\nproperties. But which things are social? How are they distinguished\nfrom those that are not social? Not every theory in social ontology\nneeds to make this distinction—but many rely on it. Michael\nBratman, for instance, analyzes “shared intentions” of a\ngroup in terms of the knowledge and intentions of individual members\nof the group (Bratman 1993, 2014). His project is designed to remove\nthe mystery behind shared intention by analyzing it in terms of\nnon-social mental states of individual people. More generally,\n“psychologistic” theories of the social world sharply\ndistinguish the social from the non-social. These\ntheories—descendants of Mill 1843—hold that all social\nfacts are determined by the psychological states of individual\npeople. \nThe “level of the social” is often divided from other\n“lower levels” in arrangements of the sciences into\nhierarchies (Comte 1830–1842, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). This\narrangement of the sciences into levels is sometimes challenged\naltogether (e.g., Wimsatt 1976, Thalos 2013). But even if certain\ndomains of science can be arranged into levels, the level of the\nsocial has difficulties unique to it. One is the problem of\nidentifying just which entities are the social ones. Even cases that\nwould seem straightforward can be contentious. A crowd, for instance,\nwas regarded by many in the late nineteenth century as the\nparadigmatic social object. But in recent years it has become less\nobvious that this is so. Margaret Gilbert, for instance, hesitates to\nattribute “sociality” to crowds: sociality, she argues,\narises from norms and commitments, which many crowds lack. According\nto Gilbert, it is with joint commitment that a group is genuinely\nsocial (Gilbert 1989). Other philosophers and sociologists make\nalternative claims about the “mark of the social”, while\nstill others deny that there is any criterion for distinguishing the\nsocial from the non-social (see Greenwood 1997). \nA second problem is to identify which categories of social entities\nare the best focus for analysis of the social world. Social theorists\nhave treated a variety of different categories of social entities as\nbasic, including social laws (Mill 1843, Spencer 1895);\nsocial facts (Durkheim 1894, Mandelbaum 1955); social\ngroups (Oppenheim & Putnam 1958, Gilbert 1989, Tuomela 2013);\nhuman kinds (Boyd 1991, 1999b; Millikan 1999, Mallon 2016); institutional\nfacts (Searle 1995); social objects and social\nproperties (Macdonald & Pettit 1981, Ruben 1985); social\npredicates (Kincaid 1986); social practices (Bourdieu\n1977, Giddens 1984, Schatzki 1996); and social processes\n(Whitehead 1929, Rescher 2000, Livet & Nef 2009). Some theories\nfocus on a category because it is significant, but do not claim that\nit comprehensively covers the social world. Others choose a category\nof social entities in order to be comprehensive. In doing this, a\ntheory may aim to set up an exhaustive determination claim: for\ninstance, it may claim that all social objects are\ncomposed of individual people interacting with one another,\nor that all social properties supervene on individualistic\nproperties, or that all social facts are grounded by\nphysical facts. As these examples illustrate, the category of social\nentities a theory focuses on is tied to how the theory interprets\n“determination” (for more on this, see\n section 2.3). \nEven more contentious is which objects are not social. To\nmany theorists, individual people are paradigmatically non-social.\nMany philosophers, however, argue that individuals are socially\nconstituted (see sections\n 1.2,\n 3.1.2, and the sections\n A.3.2,\n and\n A.4.2 of the\n  supplement on the history of social ontology).\n Thus some projects in social ontology look for a middle ground. They\nintend to accommodate the social nature of individuals, and yet to\naccount fully for the social in terms of individuals (see\n section 3.2.2). \nOne option for interpreting the “non-social entities” is\nthat they include only the objects of physics, chemistry, biology, and\nother “hard sciences”. According to some theorists, even\nthese are socially constructed and therefore fall on the social side\nof the division (Pickering 1984, Woolgar 1988). But even presuming\nthat objects of the “hard sciences” are non-social, they\nmay be inadequate for practical purposes as a characterization of the\nset of non-social things. After all, social theory aims to say more\nthan merely that the social world is somehow built out of physical\nentities (see\n section 3.1.4).\n A variety of approaches to the building blocks of the social are\ndiscussed in\n section 3. \nA second difficulty in analyzing social entities is in distinguishing\nontological from merely causal relations. In many cases, the\ndistinction is straightforward. The Battle of the Somme, for instance,\nis part of World War I. That battle is not a cause of the war. It is a\nconstituent of it: the Battle of the Somme is ontologically rather\nthan causally related to World War I. The 1881 formation of the Triple\nAlliance, on the other hand, is causally related to the war, not\nontologically. \nMany cases, however, are less straightforward, and it is not always\neasy to distinguish when entities stand in ontological rather than\ncausal relations. We could argue that the formation of the Triple\nAlliance is only causally related to the war because it took place\nlong before the war began. But temporal remoteness is not always good\nevidence. Even if causes must always precede their effects,\nidentifying causally related events is complicated by the fact that\nevents extend over long periods of time. (The weather in January 1916\nis causally and not ontologically related to World War I, although the\nwar stretched on before and after that month.) Furthermore, there\nmight be instantaneous or even backward causation (see entry on\n backward causation). \nThe more significant complication, however, is that ontological\nrelations need not be synchronic. For a mental state to be a\nmemory, for instance, it must be caused by the event of which\nit is a memory. Likewise, a mark’s being a footprint\npartly depends on historical events: it requires that the mark was\nmade by the strike of a foot (Dretske 1988, Stalnaker 1989). And for a\nperson to be President of the United States, an election must\nhave taken place beforehand. Some theories of the social world insist\nthat a social entity can only ontologically depend on synchronic facts\nabout the world. Classical structuralism, influenced by Saussure 1916,\nregards social structures as synchronic, with the social structure at\ntime t being a product of the mental states of individuals at\ntime t (see\n section 4.1).\n John Searle’s theory of institutional facts (Searle 1995, 2010)\nalso regards social entities as being synchronically dependent: the\ninstitutional facts at time t are a product of attitudes in the\ncommunity at time t together with a synchronic residue of\nhistorical events that Searle calls the “background”. Work\nin a variety of domains, however, argues for an ontological role of\nhistorical factors. Among these are theories of semantic content\n(Kripke 1972, Putnam 1975, Davidson 1987), biological and social kinds\n(Millikan 1984), artworks (Levinson 1980), and artifacts (Bloom 1996,\nThomasson 2003). \nDistinguishing causation from ontology does not imply that causal\nrelations are ontologically irrelevant. Having causal effects may be a\ncriterion for an entity to be real (Gellner 1956, Bhaskar 1975, Elder-Vass\n2010). Causal structure is also often regarded as central to the\nnature of various entities. Several theorists argue that\nkinds are individuated by their causal roles (Fodor 1974,\nKhalidi forthcoming). Some theorists of biological and artifactual\nkinds regard patterns of reproduction to be part of what individuates\nthese kinds. And some theorists of human kinds regard certain causal\nfeedback loops to be characteristic of human kinds (see\n section 4.3.3).\n The burden of such accounts is to distinguish the causal factors that\nare part of an account of ontology from those that are\n“merely” causally connected. \nFor more discussion of the distinction between “causal”\nand “constitutive” social construction, see Kukla 2000,\nHaslanger 2003. Discussion of non-causal determination relations can\nbe found in the recent literature on “grounding” and\n“ontological dependence”, including Rosen 2010, Audi 2012, Correia & Schnieder 2012, Fine 2012, Raven 2015, the entry on metaphysical grounding, and the entry on ontological dependence. \nAs seen in\n section 1\n (and the supplement on history), it is useful to break social\nontology down into two broadly different inquiries. One inquiry is to\nanalyze the constituents or essential properties of\nsocial entities. A second is to analyze the metaphysical\nsources or generators of social kinds or\ncategories. \nTo illustrate the distinction, consider a category such as animal\nsacrifice. This is a kind of ritual act performed in both\nhistorical and contemporary cultures. The boundaries of this category\nare not simple. Animal sacrifice is not the same as ritual slaughter,\nthough the two acts have many properties in common: the animals killed\nin both may be eaten, both acts may be performed by specially\nqualified individuals, and both may be subject to specific rules and\nperformed in specific contexts. The first inquiry into the nature of\nanimal sacrifice, then, is to clarify the conditions for something to\nbe in the category: what are the essential properties of an animal\nsacrifice, or the constituents of an animal sacrifice? \nOnce this is settled, however, there is a second set of ontological\nquestions regarding the sources of the category animal\nsacrifice. What features of the world—social, intellectual,\npractical or otherwise—puts this category in place? What sets up\nthe category animal sacrifice to have the boundaries or\nessential properties it does (as analyzed in the first inquiry)? \nA task for each inquiry is to clarify the respective notion of\nbuilding. \nWhat is being claimed by a theorist who argues, as Bratman does, that\ngroup intentions are “built out of” the attitudes of group\nmembers? Or, as Dretske does, that footprints are “partly built\nout of” a foot-strike? A social entity (a group intention or a\nfootprint) is held to stand in some relation R1 to other entities\n(member attitudes or a past foot-strike). What is this relation\nR1—and is there just one such relation, or are there many ways\nthat social entities are “built out of” their\nconstituents? \nOne of the more precise ways of clarifying claims about the building\nof social entities is to use various forms of the supervenience\nrelation (see the entry on\n supervenience).\n A virtue of the supervenience relation is that it makes it easy to\narticulate important distinctions in precise ways. For instance, maybe\nthe social properties of the U.S. Senate are exhaustively determined\nby the properties of U.S. Senators. Or maybe the social properties of\nthe U.S. Senate are exhaustively determined by properties of the\npopulation of the entire U.S., or even of the entire world, not just\nby properties of Senators. This distinction can be clarified using the\nnotion of “global supervenience” (see Macdonald &\nPettit 1981, Currie 1984, Kincaid 1986, Epstein 2009). There are,\nhowever, well-known shortcomings to the supervenience relation as well\n(see Fine 2001, Shagrir 2002, K. Bennett 2004a, Correia 2005). People\ninterested in the building blocks of the social world often discuss\ndifferent relations apart from supervenience, including identity,\nparthood, fusion, aggregation, set membership, constitution, and\ngrounding (see entry on\n ontological dependence,\n Copp 1984, Ruben 1985, Baker 2004, Sheehy 2006, Effingham 2010, List\n& Pettit 2011). \nThe relation in the second inquiry is less discussed. Specific\ntheories of the setup of the social world include theories of\nconvention, law, collective acceptance, structure, practices, and more\n(see\n section 4).\n A theory of law, for instance, may propose that certain lawmaking\nsystems are set up by specific beliefs and practices of members of the\nsociety. Here, a set of social entities—legislative\nsystems—stand in some relation R2 to a set of other\nentities—member beliefs and practices. Perhaps the R2 relation\n(or relations) is the same as the R1 relation. Or perhaps it is\ndifferent; this topic remains little explored. \nEpstein 2015 argues that R1 and R2 are the distinct\n“grounding” and “anchoring” relations. On this\nunderstanding, the topics discussed in\n section 3\n pertain to the grounding of social facts, and those discussed in\n section 4\n pertain to the anchoring of social categories and kinds. \nClarifying the “building relations” is part of\nunderstanding the different roles that even a single kind of building\nblock can play in making the social world. Certain theories, for\ninstance, propose that social entities are built out of individual\npeople’s psychological states. But psychological states play a\ndifferent role in the first inquiry—see\n section 3.1—than\n they do in the second—see\n section 4.1. \nWhat are the parts of a crowd or of a corporation? What are the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for an event to be an animal\nsacrifice? What facts determine that Massachusetts is a state in the\nUnited States? \nSome theories strive to give very general answers to questions like\nthese. They aim to fill in for X in the formula: All social\nentities are exhaustively determined by (or are constituted by, or\nsupervene on, or are grounded by, etc.) entities of type X. That\nis, they argue for a particular “determination base” for\nthe social entities. A large class of theories fill in ‘X’\nwith strictly non-social entities. Others argue that this asks too\nmuch: they agree that we can analyze constituents of social entities,\nbut deny that social entities decompose into non-social parts. Still\nothers reject the question altogether. And within all these views a\nvariety of positions are taken on what the “determination”\nor building relation is (see\n section 2.3). \nOther theories make less ambitious claims. Instead of searching for an\nexhaustive determination base for all social entities, they\nfocus on a particular subset of social entities. Or even more\nmodestly, they aim to analyze certain social entities in terms of\nother social parts—such as a battalion in terms of platoons, or\nan industry in terms of corporations. \nMany positions on these matters descend from the debates between\nindividualism versus holism that took place in the early part of the\ntwentieth century (cf. O’Neill 1973, Udehn 2001, Zahle &\nCollin 2014a). Individualism is the somewhat vague thesis that the\nsocial is built exclusively out of individual people. Holism is the\neven vaguer thesis that social entities are “sui generis”,\nor ontologically fundamental in some sense. Some recent work aims to\nclarify these (cf. List & Spiekermann 2013, Epstein 2014a, entry on\n methodological holism in the social sciences),\n while some rejects the terms of that debate. \nMany theories aim to remove the mystery from the social world by\ncharacterizing a non-social “determination base”: i.e., a\ndomain of non-social entities that exhaustively determines the social.\nSome put forward a strong claim about the relation between the social\nand the non-social: for instance, they claim that social entities are\nreducible to some particular set of non-social entities (see\nentry on\n scientific reduction).\n Others make weaker claims, such as that the set of social properties\nglobally supervenes (see\n section 2.3)\n on some set of non-social properties. \nPsychologism is the view that social facts are composed exclusively\nout of the psychological states of individual people. This is the view\nadvanced by Mill 1843 (see section\n 1.2\n and also section \n A.3.1 of the supplement \n  on the history of social ontology)\n and endorsed by subsequent theorists of the “social mind”\nsuch as Tarde 1898, 1901. Economists in the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries also advocated psychologism (Jevons 1871,\nWicksteed 1910, Pareto 1916), as did mid-century social theorists\n(Popper 1945, Watkins 1952). The term ‘psychologism’ is a\nlittle confusing. Karl Popper, for instance, uses this word as a\npejorative regarding a particular kind of methodology in social\nscience. But when it comes to ontology, he endorses Mill’s view\n(Popper 1945). \nMost historical versions of psychologism are “internalist”\nin that they regard the contents of mental states as depending only on\nwhat is inside a person’s head. (“Externalist”\npsychologism is discussed in\n section 3.2.1.\n For discussion of internalism versus externalism, see entry on\n externalism about mental content.) \nPsychologism is a claim about ontology; it is compatible with taking\npsychological states to be caused by non-psychological\nfactors. Jane’s belief that the wind is blowing is caused in\npart by the blowing of the wind. But her psychological state,\naccording to internalists, is a matter of her brain or other internal\nstates, and does not include the wind. According to psychologism, the\nsocial world is determined exclusively by these internal psychological\nstates. \nVersions of psychologism differ when it comes to whose\npsychological states a given social entity or fact is determined\nby or depends on. Some theories are “globally dependent”:\nthey take a fact like Gallius and Tiberius are slaves to\ndepend on the psychological states of a larger population, not just\nthose of Gallius and Tiberius (Currie 1984). Other theories are\n“locally dependent”. Many theories of group attitudes\nargue that the beliefs, intentions, and other attitudes of a given\ngroup depend only on the attitudes of the members of that group\n(Tuomela & Miller 1988, Bratman 1993, List & Pettit 2002). \nTheories also differ when it comes to which psychological\nstates determine social entities or facts. The theories of group\nattitudes just mentioned hold that group attitudes are determined not\njust by psychological states in general, but by particular attitudes\non the part of members. Broader versions of psychologism (e.g.,\nMill’s) are less specific about which psychological states are\ninvolved. \nFinally, theories differ when it comes to which social\nentities are determined by psychological states. Theories of\ngroup attitudes, for instance, limit their claims to the group\nattitudes alone. Other views, such as those of Mill and Popper,\npropose that psychological states exhaustively determine social facts\nin general. \nSocial atomism (or atomistic individualism) holds\nthat the social world is built out of individual people understood as\nisolated “atoms”. As Taylor 1985 points out, the term\n‘atomism’ is mostly used by its enemies, so its\ncharacterization often depends on what it is used to be a foil for.\nBut, typically, atomism is a combination of two claims: the view that\nsociety is exclusively built out of individual people, and that\nindividual people are somehow isolated from one another, as opposed to\nbeing mutually interdependent. \n‘Atomism’ is taken fairly literally by theories that apply\nthe methods of statistical physics to society. The idea is to model\nsocieties as large aggregates of people, much as liquids and gases are\naggregates of molecules, or ant colonies aggregates of ants.\nHistorical examples include Quetelet’s On the Social System\nof 1848 and Spencer 1895.\nContemporary representatives include models in sociophysics and\neconophysics (see Chakrabarti et al. 2007). The simplest of these\nmodels take individual interactions to be governed by deterministic\nrules, and take a society or market to be an aggregate of these\ninteracting individuals. \nSome theories are accused of being atomistic in the sense that they\ntreat individuals as isolated and non-interacting. Neoclassical\neconomic theory is sometimes challenged on this basis; others point\nout that even in basic neoclassical models relations among individuals\nare incorporated in markets, prices, and other features (see Samuelson\n1966, Arrow 1994). \nThe term ‘atomism’ is also used to indicate theories that\nneglect the causal or historical influences of society on individuals.\nA model may neglect social conditioning altogether, for instance by\ntreating individual preferences as exogenous or given parts of a\nsocial model. Or, instead, people at a historical starting point may\nbe regarded as isolated or non-social. ‘Atomism’ in this\nsense is applied to Hobbesian or “state or nature” views\nthat give an account of the development of society starting with\nnon-social individuals encountering one another (see Pettit 1993). \nTheorists in several fields have turned away from mentalistic\ntreatments of the building blocks of the social. Psychologism\npresupposed that the social sciences are sciences of the\n“mind” or “psyche” of society. However, the\nsocial sciences study not just social thoughts, but actions. This\nsuggests a different and larger determination-base for the\nsocial—that is, a larger set of blocks out of which the social\nworld is built. After all, actions are not the same as thoughts or\nbehaviors, but involve the world. \nEven behaviorism (Skinner 1953) rejects the idea that the social is\nbuilt out of internal psychological states. Instead, it argues that\nonly externally observable human behaviors can be the basis of a\nscientific inquiry into the psychological and social sciences. Still,\nbehaviorism resembles psychologism more than it departs from it: it\nreplaces the internal states of minds with the “outputs”\nof the mind in behavior, and takes the social to be exhaustively\ndetermined by those outputs or behaviors (see entry on\n behaviorism). \nMore recent theories depart from psychologism by introducing\nadditional entities into the determination base of social entities.\nKincaid 1986, for instance, claims that the social supervenes on\nindividualistic properties and relations and\nactions. Other theories argue that among the constituents of the\nsocial are also resources and other features of the world. For\ninstance, many microeconomic models include variables not only for\nattributes of individual people, but also for bundles of resources\npossessed by those people, or for such things as capital goods or\ngeographic locations. Another example is Edith Penrose’s\n“resource theory” of the firm (Penrose 1959). Penrose\nproposes that firms (corporations, partnerships, etc.) be understood\nas collections of distinctive resources, including real estate,\ncapital goods, and material processes. \nDespite such examples, it is often unclear whether such theories\ngenuinely take goods and resources to be ontologically\nrelated to social entities. Or instead, whether they regard resources\nto interact causally with social entities, but not to constitute them.\nMoreover, even in models that include resources, often only individual\nchoices are modeled as having causal powers: resources have no causal\nimport except as mediated by the attitudes and actions of individuals.\nEven Penrose’s theory of the firm focuses most of its attention\non “capabilities”, understood as knowledge and skills of\nhuman actors, and subsequent literature derived from Penrose focuses\neven more on capabilities as the exemplar of resources (e.g., Teece et\nal. 1997). \nA more unequivocal turn away from mentalism and toward the external\nworld in constituting social entities occurred in the 1980s in\nsociology and anthropology. Theorists in these fields began to pay a\ngreat deal of attention to how bodies cope in the practical\nworld, as discussed in\n section 3.2\n below. \nThe most prominent theories arguing for non-social building blocks of\nthe social are individualistic in either a narrow or broad sense.\nEither the social is exhaustively determined by the psychological\nstates of individual people, or by these plus behaviors, bodies, and\nactions, or by these plus resource bundles allocated to individuals.\nAn alternative is to reject individualism altogether, and instead\nregard the determination base of the social to include (at least\npotentially) any physical entities whatever (see Epstein 2009,\nHindriks 2013, Ylikoski 2014). Physicalism is often understood to be\nthe view that all facts—the social ones included—are\nphysical facts (see entry on\n physicalism). \nPhysicalism—on this and related understandings—has\ndifficulties as well. First, even if it is true, it would be\nsurprising if this is all we can say about the facts that determine\nthe social ones. Physicalism seems at best a starting point in an\naccount of the ontology of the social. Some theorists have put forward\nalternative approaches to stratification and hierarchy (Wimsatt 1976,\n1994; Potochnik 2010; Potochnik & McGill 2012; Thalos 2013), and\nYlikoski 2014 does so for the social world. But these are largely\ndesigned to make sense of levels of a sort in scientific methodology,\nrather than to put forward claims about ontological determination. \nSecond, it is difficult to define physicalism, and in particular to\nensure that it is not trivial (see entry on\n physicalism).\n Clarifying the thesis of physicalism involves circumscribing what\ncounts as “physical”, just as individualism involves\nclarifying what counts as “individualistic”. If the\nphysical entities are to be a non-social “base” that\nexhaustively determines the social, then it is required that the\nsocial not be included in that base. (See sections\n 3.2\n and\n 3.3\n on the separation of the social from the nonsocial.) Clarifying\nphysicalism likewise requires clarifying what dependence relation\nvarious facts are taken to stand in, with regard to the physical. Are\nsocial facts, for instance, taken to be physical facts? To supervene\non physical facts? To be exhaustively grounded by physical facts? (See\n section 2.3.1\n for analogous considerations in interpreting individualism.) \nThird, it is unclear if physicalism is true. In fact, certain social\nentities seem to be good candidates for counterexamples to at least\nsome versions of physicalism. One widely discussed problem with a\nsupervenience interpretation of physicalism, for instance, is the\n“grounding” problem regarding the modal properties of\ncoinciding objects (K. Bennett 2004b). The classic example used to discuss coinciding objects\nis an artwork—a statue—and the clay that constitutes it\n(Gibbard 1975). Other social entities work equally well for the same\npoint, such as Gilbert’s cases of two distinct social groups\nwith the same members (Gilbert 1987) and Epstein’s extension of\nsuch cases (Epstein 2015). \nMany theorists in social ontology reject the approaches discussed in\n section 3.1.\n It is fruitless, they hold, to search for non-social building blocks\nof the social world. That does not mean, however, that they renounce\nanalysis of the social altogether. Instead, they try to shed light on\nthe determination of the social in terms of other social\ncomponents. \nSome of these projects make similar claims to the ones in the last\nsection. That is, they propose sets of entities that exhaustively\ndetermine the social world—but they propose sets consisting of\nsocial entities. Other projects are more modest. They aim at\npartial accounts, rather than exhaustive ones. Just as one might break\na car down into chassis, engine, transmission, etc., one might break\nsocial entities into mid-sized parts even if that breakdown is not\nfully exhaustive, and even if those parts are not themselves\nanalyzed. \nFor those projects that do attempt to give an exhaustive analysis of\nthe social in terms of other social building blocks, a recurring worry\nis whether they can avoid being circular. If we were trying to explain\nthe nature of water, it would hardly do to say that it is built out of\nwatery parts. Likewise, it is unclear what we have accomplished if we\nargue that social entity x is ontologically determined by\nsocial entity y, and then that y in turn is partly\nontologically determined by x. \nA variant of psychologism takes an externalist approach to mental\nstates. Externalism is the view that mental states ontologically\ndepend on facts about the external world. It holds that, for instance,\nthe content of a person’s concept of water partly depends on the\nactual structure of samples of water in the person’s\nenvironment; and likewise that the content of a person’s concept\nof the U.S. Government partly depends on the external entity that is\nthe U.S. Government (see the entry on\n externalism about mental content). \nThis version of psychologism regards the social to be exhaustively\ndetermined by externalist mental states. Mid-century opponents of\nstandard psychologism (Mandelbaum 1955, Gellner 1956, Goldstein 1958) had raised the\nproblem of attitudes toward social entities, but it is not clear in\nthose views whether the external world was causally or constitutively\nrelated to the mental states. Following Kripke 1972 and Putnam 1975,\nthe explicitly externalist view was developed by Bhargava 1992 and\nPettit 1993. Pettit argues for externalist psychologism as a qualified\nversion of individualism. Like more standard psychologism, he takes\nsocial phenomena to be exhaustively determined by mental states. The\nmental states in question, however, are partly constituted by external\nstuff. \nExternalist psychologism, if correct, would pare down the\ndetermination base of the social world to one kind of (partly social)\nentity. It faces hurdles, however. First, it must explain how it\navoids circularity—that is, social entities depend on attitudes\ntoward those entities that depend on the social entities themselves.\nSecond and more seriously, it needs to explain why this is a plausible\ndetermination base for the social. According to this view, the\nexternal world figures profoundly into the determination of the\nsocial—but only when it is a constituent of attitudes.\nStrangely, when the external world is not a constituent of attitudes,\nit plays no role in the determination of the social. \nOther theorists argue that people or selves are socially constituted.\nHusserl argues that even the content of an individual’s sensory\nperception is conditioned by the community of other conscious\nindividuals. A person’s subjectivity thus depends on\nintersubjectivity (Husserl 1936: Sec. 71, 1950: Secs.\n55–60). \nA view like this—much like the externalist psychologism\ndiscussed above—can be seen as individualistic in some sense.\nThough it does not argue that the social world is determined by\nnon-social or pre-social individuals, it still holds that the social\nis determined by individuals. Husserl, for one, argues that the social\nworld is the community of intersubjectively constituted\nindividuals. \nMany views of the self as socially constituted implicitly equate the\nself with the individual mind, consciousness, or mental states. Among\nmany others, Hegel argues that self-consciousness—and hence the\nexistence of the self—depends on recognition from others (see\nsection\n 1.2, and also section \n A.3.2 of the supplement);\n Scheler 1913 that the fundamental kind of experience is\nexperience-with-one-another; Mead 1913, 1934 that individual\nexperience and self-consciousness emerge from a social matrix of\ncommunication processes; and Berger and Luckmann 1966 that individuals\nare constituted by the social roles with which they identify.\nMacIntyre 1984 argues that selves are constituted by social\nnarratives; Taylor 1989 that the self is constituted through the\nparticipation in moral frameworks; and Davis 2003 develops a social\nnarrative theory of the individual in economics. \nOther views focus on the social constitution of the body. Foucault\n1976, 1977a and Butler\n1988, 1990, 1993, among others, hold that an adequate theory of the\nself involves the construction of bodies as much as it does the\nconstruction of mental states. And they argue that human bodies are\nlargely products of discourse and the exercise of social power.\nHowever, in interpreting these views it is important to distinguish\nclaims about the constituents of selves and bodies from\nclaims about how kinds and categories are set up. At least to\nsome extent, these are theories of how narratives and practices set up\ncategories for classifying bodies (see sections\n 4.4\n and\n 5.4). \nTo be useful, it is not necessary to provide a complete account of the\nsocial world, nor to analyze social entities “all the way\ndown” to some fundamental level. It can also be illuminating\neven to give a partial account of one particular social entity in\nterms of others. \nA certain type of hate-crime, for instance, might be usefully analyzed\nas constituted in part by a speech act. That may be useful for social\nscience or law, whether or not we can say much about the nature of\nspeech acts. In economics, general equilibrium models are often\ndesigned to represent sets of households (as opposed to individuals),\nendowments of resources, sets of firms, goods, and other entities such\nas bonds and governments (Mas-Colell et al. 1995: Ch. 19). In models\nlike these, some ontological work is implicitly done, in their partial\nanalysis of economic systems into components. It is also common in\nsociological theory to analyze social entities into other social parts\n(see section\n 5.3). \nPopper and his students put forward a hybrid methodology for social\nscience, which favors individualistic explanations in a local context\nor “situation”, but takes institutions as background\nconditions that are treated as exogenous. This methodology is often\nknown as “institutional individualism” (Agassi 1975, J.S.\nColeman 1990, Jarvie 1998, Udehn 2001). This, however, is an approach\nto methodology, not a claim about the nature of the social. These\nmodels do not generally commit themselves to ontological claims either\nabout the nature of these entities or about which social entities the\nvarious components constitute. Popper, for one, argues for the\nindispensability of institutions in social explanation, but has a\npsychologistic ontology of institutions (and all social entities). \nTheories of practice, developed in anthropology in the 1970s and\n1980s, turn their attention to actions, routines, and the engagement\nof people with the world. A range of theories are now classified under\nthe broad rubric of “theories of practice”: Bourdieu 1977\nand Giddens 1984 are the most prominent, but theorists as diverse as\nFoucault, Garfinkel, Butler, Latour, Taylor, Ortner, and Schatzki are\nalso counted among the practice theorists. \nA practice is a “way of doing” some activity, involving\nhow people in a culture not only think, but also behave, speak, feel,\nand interact with objects in the environment. Consider, for instance,\na way of cooking in a given culture. Cooking involves bodily movements\nthat individuals reproduce, objects in the environment that\nindividuals handle in routine ways, explicit and background knowledge,\nand people’s intentions and choices. Individuals, according to\npractice theory, are always involved in the performance of practices,\nbut those performances are not limited to the bodies and minds of the\nperforming individuals. Bourdieu 1990 takes practices to be\nexhaustively determined by sets of objectively observable behaviors.\nBut other theories argue for the primacy of the “type”\nover the “token”: it does not make sense to say that a\npractice supervenes on its performances, since the performances are\nindividuated by reference to the practice. \nSome theories of practice are, to a certain extent, individualistic.\nPractice theory is largely concerned with bodily activity—the\nways people move, carry themselves, and act skillfully—as it is\nreproduced in a culture. Individual agents are the\n“carriers” of practices (Reckwitz 2002, Rouse 2007).\nStill, practices involve not only attitudes and mental\nrepresentations, but also objects in the world: pans, stoves,\nvegetables, and sauces are among the constituents of cooking\npractices. Moreover, individual activities themselves depend on the\nsocial: they are partly constituted by the cultural practices of which\nthey are instances. \nAlthough it is common to distinguish individualism and holism as the\ntwo poles in debates over social ontology, the range of views\ndiscussed in sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2\n show that individualism is not the only alternative to holism. Even\namong those in 3.1—ones that take the social to be built out of\nnon-social components—there are both individualistic and\nnon-individualistic alternatives to holism. \n“Holism” too is diverse. Some theories are dualist: they\npropose separate spheres of the individualistic and the social, akin\nto the Cartesian distinction between bodies and mind. Others are\nmonist: they take the social to be fundamental or to have ontological\npriority. Still other theories put forward a “flat”\nontology, according to which entities of all kinds exist and yet stand\nin no ontological priority with respect to one another. \nDualism about the social is the view that social and non-social\nentities—such as societies and individuals, or structures and\nagents—are distinct, and neither is grounded in the other. In\nthe mid-twentieth-century individualism/holism debates (see Jarvie\n1972, O’Neill 1973), holists were widely understood as endorsing\nversions of dualism. In those debates, defenders of holism did not\ndeny the existence of the non-social. Instead, they argued that the\nsocial cannot be reduced to individualistic entities. \nWork on the relation between minds and bodies strongly influences\narguments about social dualism. In particular, many philosophers of\nsocial science have adopted anti-dualist strategies pioneered by\nphilosophers of mind, especially the “non-reductive\nphysicalism” developed by Davidson, Putnam, Fodor, Kim, and\nothers. As applied to minds, this is the view that there may be\nin-principle obstacles to reducing mental properties or facts to\nphysical properties or facts, even though the mental is exhaustively\ndetermined by the physical. Philosophers of the social sciences\napplied this to social entities in the form of “non-reductive\nindividualism”. There may be obstacles, this view holds, to the\nreduction of social phenomena to individualistic ones, even though the\nsocial is exhaustively determined by the individualistic (Macdonald\n& Pettit 1981; Mellor 1982; Currie 1984; Kincaid 1986, 1997, 1998;\nTuomela 1989; Little 1991; Bhargava 1992; Pettit 1993, 2003; Hoover\n1995, 2001a, 2009;\nStalnaker 1996; Sawyer 2002, 2005; Schmitt 2003a; List &\nSpiekermann 2013). More recently, some philosophers have challenged\nthese arguments as inadequately characterizing the\n“supervenience base” (see sections\n 3.1.3\n and\n 3.1.4).\n These philosophers agree with the basic strategy for denying dualism.\nBut they deny that the “individualistic” is the proper way\nto understand the building blocks of the social, arguing instead for a\nbroader set of building blocks. \nDualism has seen a resurgence among some philosophers of mind, e.g.,\nChalmers 1996. It is not clear, however, that the sorts of argument\nmarshalled in favor of mental dualism could apply to social dualism.\nFor instance, even if Chalmers’ “zombie” argument\nsucceeds for minds, there may not be a social analogue to the\n“hard problem of consciousness” (see entry on\n zombies). \nA different version of social holism is monist rather than dualist.\nInstead of postulating two or more spheres of substances—social\nand non-social—this version regards social entities to be\nontologically prior or fundamental, and individual people (and other\nentities) to be ontologically derivative on the social. This sort of\nmonism is often associated with Hegel (see\n section A.3.2 of the supplement)\n and the British idealists, such as Green 1866 and Bradley 1893. \nSome mid-century social theories also seem to take this position.\nClassical structuralism emphasizes the priority of structure over the\nindividual, following Saussure’s arguments for the ontological\npriority of the linguistic system over the individual sign (1916). In\nits initial applications to anthropology, roles in a cultural system\nwere analyzed in terms of the system as a whole. By the 1960s,\nhowever, the point was applied not just to roles but to individuals\nthemselves. Althusser 1965 and Balibar 1965, for instance, argue for a\n“theoretical anti-humanism” in which causal explanation is\npredominantly structural:  \nMen only appear in the theory as supports for the relationships\nimplied in the structure, and the forms of their individuality only\nappear as the determined effects of the structure. (Balibar 1965)  \nThe functionalist sociology of Talcott Parsons (1951) also prioritizes\nsocial structure over individual agency. Parsons is often understood\nas arguing that individual action is little more than a manifestation\nof social functions, and is severely criticized (e.g., by Garfinkel\n1967) on the grounds that he inappropriately discounts individual\nagency. It is not always clear, however, whether the explanatory\npriority of the social over the individual entails a claim about\nontological priority. Functional systems, even ones that strip\nindividuals of their freedom to act independently, may nonetheless be\nexhaustively grounded in “low-level” entities. \nOther approaches reject any ordering or hierarchy of entities\naltogether. Some views deny that the sciences can be divided into\nhierarchies, but allow that certain entities are composed of others. A\nmore radical view is that there is no building at all among entities.\nA prominent example is Actor-Network Theory (Latour 2005, Callon 1999,\nLaw 2009). All entities, in this approach, are potentially on a par\nwith one another. Even identifying an entity or a class of things as\n“social” is a mistake, according to Latour. Latour\ndistinguishes certain roles that objects can play: they can act as\n“mediators”, transforming meaning, and they can act as\n“intermediaries”, transmitting meaning without\ntransforming it. An atom, a person, a machine, a mountain, or a bank,\nhave equal potential to play these roles. All the\nscientist—social or natural—can do is to write narratives\nthat trace associations. Other approaches to flat ontology include\n“assemblage theory” (DeLanda 2006), “object-oriented\nontology” (Harman 2005), and “scale-free\nmetaphysics” (Thalos 2013). \nInquiry into the constituents or “stuff” of the social\nworld, discussed in the last section, is a huge field. But there is\nanother field of inquiry with an array of approaches in social\nontology: the inquiry into how social categories or kinds are set up.\nConsider, for instance, the fact Kanye and Kim are dancing the\ncha-cha. The “stuff” of the dance is the two people\nmoving around in some pattern. But, we might ask, what sets up the\ncategory cha-cha? Why do the moves determine what dance it\nis, rather than the material of floor they are dancing on or the brand\nof shoes they are wearing? What makes it the case that dances are\ncategorized into cha-chas versus sambas versus salsas; or, for that\nmatter, certain sequences of movement into dances versus strolls\nversus marches? \nHere are a few options one might start with: \nThe following sections discuss more developed views taking off from\nthese ideas.\n Section 4.1\n discusses theories that are both mentalistic and\nindividualistic: i.e., those holding that the metaphysical source\nof a person’s social categories is that person’s own\nmental states.\n Section 4.2\n discusses mentalistic theories that involve many or all the mental\nstates of people in a community, rather than each person for herself.\n Section 4.3\n discusses theories that regard social categories to be set up by\npatterns of properties and causes.\n Section 4.4\n discusses theories that include practices in setting up social\ncategories, and\n section 4.5\n discusses pluralistic and heterogeneous theories.\n Section 4.6\n discusses the potential roles for language in setting up social\ncategories. \nImportantly, any given theory of the source of social categories can\ntake different positions on the topics discussed in\n section 3—i.e.,\n on what the constituents or building blocks of social entities are. A\nset of theorists might disagree about how cha-chas (or other social\nentities, or entities in general) are constituted—e.g.,\nby people, or patterns, or physical configurations of atoms, or\nsensible particulars, or impressions, etc. And yet all might agree\nthat a person’s categories are set up by that\nperson’s own mental states (compare, for instance, Berkeley\n1710, Russell 1929, and Dennett 1991). Conversely, a set of theorists\nmight all agree on how cha-chas are constituted, yet disagree on what\nmetaphysically sets up that category. \nMany philosophical traditions investigate how individuals mentally\nconstruct, organize, categorize, or represent social objects—and\nobjects more generally. Some views regard social categories to be\nconcepts that individual minds assemble in order to organize\nsubjective impressions. An example is a Lockean “nominal\nessence” theory of social categories (see\n section A.2.4 of the supplement).\n In this theory, a given person’s social category\ncha-cha is an idea in that person’s mind, formed out of\ncombinations of impressions or other ideas internal to that\nperson’s mind. \nAt least until the middle of the twentieth century, the\nindividualistic-and-mentalistic theories were the prevailing\napproaches to the setup of the social world. These theories come in\nstaggering variety. Even classical structuralism in anthropology\n(e.g., Lévi-Strauss 1945, 1963) falls into this class, holding\nthat structures are unconscious sets of mental states. This brand of\nstructuralism has an individualistic rather than a distributed theory\nof how structure determines a person’s social categories: each\nperson, according to Lévi-Strauss, has a mental structure that\ndetermines his or her own social categories. Later versions of\nstructuralism reject this individualistic treatment of structure. \nTo organize the class of individualistic-and-mentalistic theories, we\nmight distinguish the positions they take with respect to dimensions\nsuch as the following: The extent to which social categories differ from person to\nperson: We seem to live in a single world, to have attitudes\nabout the same objects and propositions as one another, and to\ncommunicate about them. Are categories shared among people in a\nculture, between cultures, or universally? Intersubjectivity and\nobjectivity are acute problems for mentalistic theories of social\ncategories. In certain views, each person’s private\n“conceptual scheme” may differ in subtle or stark ways\nfrom the schemes of others. Some hold that conceptual schemes may be\nsimilar among members of a community, as a result of collaboration and\ncausal feedback, but never identical. Alternatively, conceptual\nschemes and social categories may be less fine-grained, so that\ndifferences in people’s mental states may not yield differences\nin their categories (cf. Mach 1886, Natorp 1888, Cassirer 1910, Quine\n1960, Foucault 1966 [1970]). How integrated a person’s category-determining mental\nstates are: Quine 1951 argues that our beliefs about the world\nare interconnected with one another, and that no belief can be\nassessed against our experience of the world on its own, in isolation\nfrom our other beliefs. Each person, according to Quine, forms a\n“web of belief” by systematizing the stimuli the person\nreceives from the world. A person’s ontological categories are a\nproduct of that network, and any change to the network affects the\nnetwork as a whole. Other approaches to the mentalistic construction\nof social categories are more piecemeal, with the determination of\neach category ontologically independent of one another. How a person’s social categories are related to that\nperson’s concepts: Many theories of categorization in\npsychology (see Cohen & Lefebvre 2005) treat a person’s\nconcepts interchangeably with the categories that person imposes on\nthe world. The so-called internalist versions of these theories take a\nperson’s concepts to ontologically depend on states of the\nperson’s brain alone. These theories take a person’s\nsocial categories to be the same as her concepts, which are internal\nmental states. Other mentalistic theories of social categories do not\nfit this mold. It may be that a person’s social categories are\ngenerated by that person’s mental states, without the categories\nhaving to be conceptualized. Whether the mind “organizes” the world:\nMentalistic theories of how social categories are set up often\nimplicitly draw on a picture of the mind as “organizing”\nthe content that is “given” to it by the senses. Sellars\n1956 and Davidson 1973 criticize this picture, denying that there is\nany such “given”. Davidson rejects the distinction between\n“scheme” and “content”, arguing that it is\nincoherent to hold that different people, or people in different\ncultures, have different “conceptual schemes”. In\nresponse, one might defend the scheme/content distinction, or else\nturn to a less mentalistic picture of the determination of categories\n(see\n section 4.4).\n Still other views—such as various forms of idealism—take\na mentalistic view of the setup of social categories without endorsing\na scheme/content distinction. Whether and how category-determining mental states are\nconstrained: Theories inspired by structural linguistics\n(Saussure 1916, Jakobson 1931, Chomsky 1965) hold that the mind limits\nthe possible variations among categories, and that a person’s\ncategories are linked with one another. According to\nLévi-Strauss, kinship structures are governed by universal\nrules, so only a limited number of forms of kinship are human\npossibilities (Lévi-Strauss 1945). Some recent psychological\ntheories of categorization see humans as having specialized neural\ncircuits for processing different categories of objects (see Carey\n& Spelke 1994,\nCapitani et al. 2003,\nMahon & Caramazza 2009). Other theories propose constraints on the mechanisms by\nwhich categories are constructed by the mind (Kant 1781/1787, Cohen 1871). Still other\ntheorists regard the mental construction of social categories to\ninvolve generic mental processes (Piaget 1926, Mandler 2004). \nInstead of taking social categories to be products of individual\nminds, another class of theories holds that they are the products of\nthe minds in a community taken together. Hume 1740 argues that\npromises are a product of a social convention. We have a convention,\naccording to Hume, of the following form: words uttered according to a\ncertain formula incur an obligation. When someone utters a phrase of\nthe form ‘I promise to S’, the speaker is obligated\nto perform S. According to this theory, the conditions for an\nutterance to be a promise are set up by beliefs and expectations of\nthe members of the community at large. \nTheories in this broad class take different approaches to how\ncommunity mental states set up social categories. \nAgreement, according to some historical theories, is the source of\nlaw, language, and the state (see section\n 1.1, and \n also sections A.1 and\n A.2.1 of the supplement).\n Agreement still plays a role in contemporary theories of some social\nphenomena, but that role is typically to ground the obligations\nassociated with phenomena. For instance, according to the “will\ntheory of contract”, contractual obligations are grounded by the\nintentional choices of each party to be bound to a commitment (see\nFried 1981, Barnett 1985). When it comes to setting up social\ncategories, it seems less likely that actual agreements are available\nto be their metaphysical sources. Instead, even theories that are\nputatively agreement-based tend to place agreement in a different\nrole. Gauthier 1986, for instance, advances an agreement-based theory\nof morality. By his account, however, the justification for moral\nclaims is based on what people rationally would agree to:\nidealized agreements, rather than actual ones, serve as the basis for\nmoral categories. \nAnother difficulty—even if a given social category is the\nproduct of agreement—is identifying which feature of an\nagreement does the “metaphysical labor” in setting up the\ncategory. Suppose we employ a social category at time t′\nwhich was a product of an agreement at time t. It may be that\nthe features of that category are a product of the mental states of\nparticipants at t, or of the utterances or acts of participants\nat t. Or perhaps what matters is the mental states of community\nmembers at t′: that is, it is the synchronic trace of the\nagreement that sets up the social categories in a community at\nt, not the agreement itself. \nConvention-based theories are widely proposed for many social\nphenomena, including traffic rules, etiquette, laws, language, norms,\ninstitutions, morality, gender, codes of dress, and religion—as\nwell as geometry, logic, truth, and necessity (see, among many others,\nQuine 1936, Lewis 1969, Schiffer 1972, Carter & Patterson 1982,\nGilbert 1983, Kekes 1985, Sugden 1986, Sidelle 1989, Friedman 1995,\nLagerspetz 1995, Young 1996, Bicchieri 2005, Bickhard 2008, Schotter\n2008, Marmor 2009, Azzouni 2014, Guala 2016). \nTo say that a social phenomenon is “conventional”\nsometimes means little more than that it is social, or that something\nabout the phenomenon is arbitrary, or a matter of choice. In social\nontology, however, conventionalist theories are understood more\nprecisely, following variants of David Lewis’s 1969 analysis of\nconvention, or else following analyses of convention that challenge\nLewis’s approach. \nLewis argues that conventions are solutions to coordination problems.\nIn interactive situations that have more than one\nequilibrium—for instance, where it is rational for us all to\ndrive on the left or for us all to drive on the\nright—conventions resolve the question of which actions to\nchoose. In his analysis, convention does not require explicit or tacit\nagreement, but instead involves the possession of various attitudes by\nmembers of the community, including beliefs, knowledge, expectations,\nand preferences (see the entry on\n convention). \nAmong the critiques of Lewis-style conventionalist theories are: that\nmany social phenomena do not appear to be solutions to coordination\nproblems; that they are excessively mentalistic, involving a complex\nstructure of beliefs, knowledge, expectations, and preferences of the\npopulation; and that they regard conventions as regularities in\nbehavior having certain characteristics, so the analysis rules out as\nconventions anything that is not exemplified in behavioral regularity\n(see Burge 1975, Millikan 2005). The critiques, however, are\ncomplicated by the malleability of the notion of convention: it is not\nclear whether these should be regarded as difficulties for\nconventionalism or for Lewis’ analysis. \nAnother prominent set of approaches is closely related to\nconventionalism, but instead of appealing to structures of individual\nattitudes, these approaches take the social world to be set up by\ncollective attitudes and dispositions. (Some, though not all,\nof these accounts go on to analyze collective attitudes in terms of\nindividual attitudes. See\n section 5.2.) \nHart (1961) proposes a sociological basis for certain kinds of\nrules—in particular, the rule regarding how valid laws are made\nin a society. A rule R, for Hart, is a rule in a society\nif two requirements hold: that members of the society behave in\nconformance to R, and that members of the society accept\nR as a standard of behavior in the society. \nSearle (1995, 2010) proposes a theory of those social facts he calls\n“institutional facts”. He modifies a Hart-style approach\nin three ways. First, he augments Hart’s account of what it\ntakes for members of a society to accept a rule: he argues that the\ncommunity must collectively accept the rule (see\n 5.2\n on collective attitudes). Second, he does not require that rules be\nimplemented in behavior: institutional facts depend only on mental\nstates in a society, not on practices. Third, he argues that the\n“constitutive rules” for institutional facts all share a\ncommon form: they involve a certain kind of status assigned to objects\nin the world. The general form of constitutive rules, according to\nSearle, is “X counts as Y in context\nC”. An object X counts as having the status or\nsymbolic function of Y in the context of a community. For\nexample: a line of stones (X) counts as having the status\nof functioning as a border wall (Y) in a village\n(C). Another example: a piece of paper issued by the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing (X) counts as having the\nstatus of functioning as money (Y) in the United States\n(C). Among the institutional facts, according to Searle,\nare social categories such as money, borders, cocktail parties, and\npublic offices. Tuomela (2002) advances a related collective\nacceptance theory of social entities. \nÁsta Sveinsdóttir (2008, 2010, 2013) also regards many\nsocial properties to be a product of collective attitudes, but in a\nweaker sense than Searle. A social property is “conferred”\non an object, according to Ásta, if the object has the property\nbecause of some attitudes of people. A baseball umpire, for instance,\nconfers the property of being a strike on certain pitches. Many\nproperties, Ásta argues, should not be understood as being\nconferred by actual beliefs or acceptances of community members.\nInstead, conferrals should be understood in terms of ideal versions of\ncommunity members. At bottom, she understands conferrals to be a\nproduct of community dispositions: i.e., how members are disposed to\nuse concepts in counterfactual situations. \nOther approaches also see social categories as being set up by the\ndistributed mental states of members of a society. Many of these\ntheories are less specific about the particular states that\nindividuals must be in. Husserl (1936, 1950) argues that how an\nindividual represents an object depends, in part, on the\npresupposition that others are representing it as well. Individual\nempathy for the representations of others plays a part in how the\nindividual herself constructs representations. The representations of\nobjects in a society, therefore, are a product of harmonized mental\nstates among its members. But these mental states are not required to\nbe attitudes or dispositions. Other theorists associate different\nmental characteristics with structuring social categories. Berger and\nLuckmann (1966), for instance, regard the identification of people in\na society with social roles as central to the characteristics of those\nroles. \nMentalistic theories of social categories, whether individualistic or\nsocial, are sometimes criticized for overly fictionalizing the social\nworld. Some philosophers emphasize that social categories are\nroutinely used in the social sciences: the categories support\ninductive inferences, can be assessed statistically, and have causal\neffects. Such theorists argue that social categories are “real\nkinds” in the world, much like water and gold are “natural\nkinds”. Some deny the distinction between social kinds and\nnatural kinds altogether, even while seeking to retain a role for\npeople in setting up social categories. Instead of regarding social\nkinds to be generated principally by mental states that we overlay on\nthe world, they treat social kinds as products of patterns—often\npatterns of causes and effects—in the world. \nFunctionalism in social theory is predominantly an approach to social\nexplanation, providing causal accounts for the existence and\nmaintenance of social entities in terms of the functions they serve\nfor society. Some functionalist theories also make ontological claims,\narguing that the nature of social entities involves their\nfunctions. \nA common theme in functionalism is that people are often unaware of\nthe functions that their own activities perform. Merton (1957)\ndistinguishes the “latent” functions of an activity from\nits “manifest” functions. In many contemporary societies,\nfor instance, people choose whom to marry on the basis of strong\nromantic attachments. One function of this practice is the manifest\nfunction of promoting happy long-term relationships. This motivates\nindividuals to marry for love. But, Merton argues, the practice also\nhas an underlying goal (the latent function): to minimize the role of\nfamily in the selection of a mate, thus leading to a kinship structure\nwith many marriages that join individuals from different communities.\nFunctionalists, then, often disagree with theories that treat social\nphenomena as cognitively transparent to members of a society. \nA function may figure into the ontology of a social kind K in any of\nseveral ways. The simplest is for K to be defined by a causal\nrole R that its instances perform. In that case, K is a “causal\nrole kind”. Take, for instance, the role serving to minimize\nthe role of family in selecting a mate. Alternatively, certain\nsocial categories may better be understood as realizers of\nfunctional roles. A realizer-kind is often defined in terms of process\nor physical characteristics, where things that have those\ncharacteristics normally perform a role (see Block 1980, McLaughlin\n2006). \nAs analyses of social functional kinds, both role-kinds and\nrealizer-kinds have shortcomings. In particular, they miss out on the\nnormative character of functions. Cummins (1975) analyzes functions in\nterms of the capacities of the components of a system to contribute to\na capacity of a larger system. On his account, the function that an\nentity plays is sensitive to the context of the larger system in which\nit is embedded. Social kinds, then, may arise from components of\nsocial systems having particular Cummins-functions. \nMillikan (1984) proposes a different approach to functional kinds,\narguing that they arise from the successive copying or reproduction of\nnew objects from older ones. A population of objects copied in the\nright way, and copied because they perform a function, form a\n“reproductively established family”. Millikan (1999, 2005)\napplies this account to linguistic and social kinds as well as\nbiological ones. Millikan also analyzes social convention in terms of\nreproductively established families, and other theorists have recently\napplied her theory to artifacts (see\n section 5.5). \nA significant contribution of Millikan’s approach is the\nconstitutive role of particular tokens in the world in setting up the\nkinds of which they are members. In her approach, the kind\nmarriage is partly set up by millions of particular marriages\ncopied one from another in a reproductively established family.\nParticular marriages—the actual members of the kind—figure\ninto setting up the kind marriage to have the membership\nconditions it does. Contrast this with a mentalistic account of the\nkind marriage. According to that sort of theory, particular\nmarriages are members of the kind, and may play a causal role in\ntriggering people to have certain attitudes. But it is the attitudes\nthat define the kind; the tokens do not play an ontological role. Thus\nMillikan proposes a more “world-involving” and less\nmentalistic theory of how kinds are set up. Also see Burge 1986 for a\nsimilar insight. \nSystems theorists in the 1940s and 1950s began to investigate feedback\nmechanisms of regulation and control, such as electronic circuits that\nloop their outputs back into their inputs in order to arrive at a\nstable equilibrium. Wiener (1948, 1950) applies this\n“cybernetics” to social systems, as do Mead et al.\n1950–1956, Parsons 1951, Ashby 1956. Bateson (1972) elaborates\nthese applications, describing social systems as involving\nhomeostasis, i.e., mechanisms that self-correct to stabilize their\nproperties. \nBoyd (1999a) applies\nhomeostasis to the analysis of kinds, both natural and social.\nAccording to Boyd, kinds are clusters of entities that stably have\nsimilar properties, with these similarities sustained by a causal\nhomeostatic mechanism. Marriage, for instance, is a kind because there\nare many particular entities with similar properties (such as being\nformed by ceremonies, involving couples paired up, and so on), and\nbecause there are mechanisms causing entities to have and keep these\nproperties. Like Millikan, Boyd argues that kinds are a product of\nactual tokens in the world and the causal processes in which those\ntokens are involved. Since his account involves actual causal patterns\nover time, kinds are historical, but they do not need to involve\nfunctional roles or evolution. \nHacking (1995) employs feedback mechanisms in a different way: rather\nthan emphasizing stability, he regards causal change to be\ncharacteristic of “human kinds”. Hacking argues that human\nkinds are generated through histories of causal loops, in which\nobjects having a cluster of properties are named as being members of a\nkind. That label then affects the property cluster that they have,\nwhich changes the classification, and so on repeatedly, with human\ninterests changing the properties that get classified into the\ncategory. Hacking discusses the example of the kind refugee,\nin which categorizing people as refugees changes how they are treated,\nwhich then loops back to affect how we categorize refugees. In\nHacking’s account, each loop includes a mentalistic\naspect—the classification—and an instantiated\naspect—the causal effects on the properties. Butler 1993 and\nHayles 1999 develop accounts of the looping effects of classification\nsystems on human bodies (see also Schilling 2001). Mallon (2003, 2016)\ncombines the looping theories with homeostatic property clusters, and\napplies them to social kinds, races in particular. \nA different large class of theories hold that practical engagement\nwith the environment is the basis for the setup of social categories.\nMany of these theories are influenced by Heidegger 1927, Merleau-Ponty\n1945, and Wittgenstein 1953. And still other theories are pluralistic\nand heterogeneous: they hold that social categories are not just set\nup in one uniform way, but in a variety of distinct ways. \nTheories of practice were discussed in\n section 3.2.4,\n as theories of the constituents or parts of social phenomena. Dances,\nfor instance, involve physical and mental routines: among the\nconstituents of a cha-cha are people’s thoughts and actions on\nthe dance floor. However, theories of practice are not so easily\ncategorized. Particular tokens of dance routines might be understood\nas playing a dual role: not only are they the constituents of\ncha-chas, but they also are among the sources of the category cha-cha.\nIn this respect, theories of practice share an insight with certain\n“pattern” theories (see sections\n 4.3.2\n and\n 4.3.3):\n the tokens of the practices themselves do some of the work in\nstructuring the social categories into which the practices fall.\nGiddens (1984) gives an account of what he calls\n“structuration”, the process by which social structures\nare dynamically generated by practices and also condition them.\nSahlins (1981, 1985) describes the formation of cultural categories\nthrough collisions between cultures and the actions of individuals.\nOther theories as well, such as Foucault (1976, 1977a) and Geertz (1973) can also be\nunderstood as giving accounts of how practices set up social\ncategories. \nBecause practices are so general and play so many roles in these\ntheories, it is a challenge to interpret them from the perspective of\nsocial ontology. It is hard to tease apart different kinds of\nontological claims they make, and also hard even to know when these\ntheories are making an ontological claim, as opposed merely to telling\na narrative of causal influence. Some theories of practice insist on\nthe importance of material routines in the world, and yet return to\nmentalistic-sounding accounts of the conceptual creation of the social\nworld. The centerpiece of Bourdieu 1972 [1977], for instance, is the\nclaim that social practice is generated by a\n“habitus”—a mentally internalized system of\ndiscrimination and perception, embodied as dispositions. (See also\nOrtner 1984). \nAs seen in the “pattern theories” discussed in\n section 4.3,\n approaches to biological and other scientific kinds are sometimes\nextended to social categories. Some participants in these debates,\nincluding Dupré (1995) and Hacking (2007), argue for a sweeping\npluralism about scientific kinds: they contend that there are myriad\nkinds of kinds, and that it is an error to regard some kinds as more\n“natural” than others. Others argue for a more modest form\nof pluralism. Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015) argue that there are\nseveral distinct kinds of scientific kinds, including non-causal\nkinds, functional kinds, and heterostatic kinds. Along similar lines,\nmany theorists of race argue for pluralism with respect to racial\nkinds: though contemporary race theorists deny “biological\nessentialism”, they argue that there are many ways racial kinds\nare constructed and used in contemporary societies (see\n section 5.4). \nEpstein (2008, 2014a) argues\nfor modest pluralism about the ways social categories are set up. He\nintroduces the term ‘anchoring’ to denote the setting up\nor putting in place of social categories or kinds. He proposes that\nall the theories discussed in\n section 4\n are theories of anchoring, but denies that social categories are all\nanchored in the same way. Instead, there are various “anchoring\nschemas”. He cautions that we sometimes classify kinds according to\nhow they are anchored, but not in all cases. \nIn addition to pluralism about anchoring schemas, he also argues that\nanchors are heterogeneous (Epstein 2015): even for a single anchoring schema, the anchors\nthat feed into that schema—i.e., the facts that metaphysically\nset up a social category—are often diverse. Legal categories in\nthe U.S., for instance, are anchored by facts such as jury\ninstructions, trial results, legislative enactments, judicial\ninterpretation, and environmental regularities. Even theories of\npractice, he argues, do not have the resources to accommodate this\nheterogeneity. \nMany theories in social ontology assign a central role to language. In\nconsidering the relation between language and sociality, we should\nseparate the following questions: \nAnswers to this third question can, in turn, be divided into two broad\nkinds of role for language: (a) social categories correspond to\nsemantic values, or meanings, of words; (b) social categories are set\nup by speech acts, discourse, or other features of a community’s\nlanguage. \n‘Cha-cha’ is a word in the English language (yes, imported\nfrom Spanish). In some semantic theories, the meaning of that word\njust is the social kind cha-cha: the semantic value of the\nword is identical with the social category. This may or may not imply\nthat language plays a key role in social ontology. On a\ndirect-reference theory of meaning (see Soames 1987, Kaplan 1989,\nRecanati 1993), it does not. That theory argues that we encounter the\nkind cha-cha in the world—a kind that is presumably\nsocially constructed—and then connect the word\n‘cha-cha’ to that kind. The inclusion of that word in our\nlanguage does not have any metaphysical bearing on the category. \nThe same may apply even if the name has causal influence on the\ncategory cha-cha. Hacking 1995 argues that the term we apply\nto a category has an influence on our practices, which in turn changes\nthe category. Even in this account, it is not clear that language has\na metaphysical bearing on the category: the practices ontologically\ndetermine the contours of the category, and the uses of the word are\nmerely one among many causal influences on those practices. \nBut in other theories of meaning, the order of metaphysical\ndetermination is reversed. Consider, for instance, a theory in which\nword meaning is derived from patterns of usage—a theory, for\ninstance, in which the word ‘cha-cha’ derives its meaning\nat a time from uses of that word up to that time. Or consider a\ndescriptive theory of meaning—a theory in which the word\n‘cha-cha’ derives its meaning from the cluster of\ndescriptions that the English-speaking community associates with it.\nIf we add to these theories of linguistic meaning the further claim\nthat social categories are identified with semantic values, then it is\nlinguistic building blocks that set up the social kind\ncha-cha. \nThere are grounds for skepticism about equating social categories with\nsemantic ones. Sociologists often discover social categories that have\nnot been previously named, spoken of, or even conceptualized. This\nsuggests that semantic categories may not play quite so central a role\nin the metaphysics of the social world. \nAustin (1961, 1962) points out that language is not only reserved for\ndescribing states of affairs in the world. Certain utterances are\n“performative”: merely in uttering them, we establish\nfacts in the world. A minister, for instance, marries a couple with an\ninvocation. Searle (1995, 2010) argues that all “institutional\nfacts” are generated in this way. Every constitutive rule, he\nargues, is a product of a declarative speech act, although he\nqualifies this by holding that some declarations may be replaced with\nattitudes that have the same function (Searle 2010). He expresses\nskepticism that, in such acts, we genuinely create new entities in the\nworld, rather than merely taking attitudes towards “brute\nreality” (cf. Sider 2001, Effingham 2010). Thomasson (2003)\nargues on the contrary for the reality of entities generated with\nspeech acts (cf. Wiggins 1980, Schiffer 2003). \nSeveral theorists argue not just that particular social entities are\nproduced by speech acts, but that the social world is the product of\ndiscourse more generally. This view has many historical antecedents in\nthe enlightenment and post-enlightenment (Aarsleff 1982, Ricken 1994,\nand Forster 2010), as well as in the early twentieth century, such as\nCassirer 1925 and Whorf 1944. But Wittgenstein (1953) is generally\ncredited with crystallizing this “linguistic turn”. Winch\n(1958) draws on Wittgenstein to argue that “our language and our\nsocial relations are just two different sides of the same coin”.\nSocial phenomena and their meanings, according to Winch, are\nmanifestations of the “form of life” in which a\nsociety’s language-games are a part. This perspective has been\ninfluential in post-structuralism in particular, with a wide range of\ntheories advocating the linguistic construction of social reality.\nIncluded among these are Foucault’s discourse analysis (Foucault\n1984, 2001) and Butler (1988)’s treatment of the performativity\nof gender, with the speech acts that would appear to express gender\nactually being constitutive of gender identities. See Tannen, Hamilton\net al. 2015. \nRecent theories in post-structuralism have begun to de-emphasize\nlanguage, partly as a result of critiques that such theories focus too\nlittle on human bodies and physical experience. The notion of\n“discourse” is also often expanded to include practical\nactivities in the world (such as the “architectural\ndiscourse” of constructed spaces). Theories of discourse,\nconstrued in this way, are difficult to distinguish from more general\ntheories of practice and heterogeneous theories. \nThe preceding sections discuss general theories of social ontology.\nInforming these—and informed by them—is work on specific\napplications. The following sections briefly discuss prominent domains\nin social ontology to give a sense of the variety of these\napplications, to introduce some key topics, and to point to resources\nfor further reading. Corresponding to each these sections is an entire\nsubfield of philosophy and/or social science. \nWhat are social groups? One debate in the literature concerns the kind\nof entities that social groups are: collections, classes, sets,\nfusions, structures, or some other kind of entity. It may seem natural\nto think of a group as a set of people in the mathematical sense.\nHowever, groups can persist through changes in membership, while sets\nare generally understood as having their members essentially (see\nSharvy 1968, Ruben 1985, Uzquiano 2004, Sheehy 2006). Effingham (2010)\nproposes an account that identifies groups with complex sets, so that\nthey can have different members at different times and at different\nworlds. Others (including Macdonald & Pettit 1981, Copp 1984,\nSheehy 2006) argue that groups are fusions of people. A problem with\nthis is the transitivity of parthood: since Alice’s finger is a\npart of Alice, it follows from the fusion view that if Alice is a part\nof a group, then so is Alice’s finger. That is a problem,\nbecause while Alice is a member of the group her finger is not.\nAnother view is that groups are realizations of structures: Schmitt\n(2003a) considers and objects to this, and Ritchie (2013) defends it.\nOthers argue that groups are distinct from their members but are\nconstituted by them (Uzquiano 2004, Jansen 2009, Epstein 2015). \nDifferent approaches to groups make different commitments with regard\nto the entities that should be included among the social\ngroups—e.g., committees, teams, corporations, universities,\nnations, races, genders, red-haired people. Some theorists also\npropose that social groups must have certain distinctive\ncharacteristics, such as the members being in certain cognitive states\nor being subject to certain norms. Related to this is the question of\nwhether there are distinct types of groups. Ritchie (2015) argues that\nthere are two prominent types—organized groups, which\nare realizations of structured sets of nodes that stand in a\nfunctional relation to one another, and feature groups, which\nare collections of people who have a property or feature in common\nwith one another. Thomasson (forthcoming) argues that an important way\nof characterizing groups is in terms of the norms they bear. Epstein\n(forthcoming) challenges simple typologies of groups and proposes a\nframework for the metaphysics of groups involving multiple\ndimensions. \nCan groups take actions? Can they have intentions or beliefs? Can they\nbear responsibility? If so, how are these to be understood? Through\nmuch of the twentieth century ascriptions of intentions and actions to\ngroups were widely regarded as either erroneous or else merely\n“summative”: that is, for a group to have an intention or\ntake an action is merely for all the members of the group to have that\nintention or take that action (see Tollefsen 2015). \nSchweikard and Schmid (see entry on\n collective intentionality)\n find more nuanced approaches in Scheler 1913 and Walther 1923.\nScheler identifies various kinds of social entities, some of which\ninvolve people acting in solidarity, and Walther proposes an account\nof structured attitudes in terms of empathy. In the recent literature,\nGilbert (1989, 1990) introduces new reasons for denying summative\napproaches: members of social groups are subject to norms that do not\napply merely to individuals who have matching attitudes. If a couple\nis walking together to the store, one person violates a norm if she\nsuddenly takes off in a different direction without excusing herself.\nBut this would not violate any norms if collective intentions were\nmerely summative. Gilbert argues that social groups, as opposed to\nmere collections of individuals, are formed by the members making\njoint commitments. She describes the formation of such commitments,\nand analyzes group attitudes in terms of them. \nBratman (1993, 2014) is more concerned with demystifying shared\nintentions by explaining how they can arise from individual attitudes.\nInstead of searching for a general analysis, he proposes sufficient\nconditions for the formation of shared intention, as applied to the\ncase of “modestly social” groups. These are small,\nunstructured groups of people, in which all members participate\nknowledgably in coordination with one another. Bratman analyzes shared\nintention in terms of the common knowledge of group members, together\nwith “meshing” intentions by group members to perform an\naction by way of the actions and plans of the other members. Bratman\nargues that the norms Gilbert observes can be derived from these\ninterpersonal intentions together with standard moral obligations. \nTuomela and Miller (1988) and Searle (1990) account for group\nintention differently. Following Sellars (1968, 1980), they propose\nthat there is an overlooked class of attitudes that individual people\npossess: in addition to “I-attitudes”, individuals also\nhave “we-attitudes”. According to Searle, these are\ndistinct primitive mental states. For a group to collectively intend\nJ, according to Searle, is for all the members of the group to\nwe-intend J. His view is somewhat similar to a “summative”\nview of group attitudes, except that collective attitudes are sums of\nwe-attitudes rather than I-attitudes. Tuomela and Miller also\ndistinguish attitudes in the “we-mode” from attitudes in\nthe “I-mode”. The most unified form of group attitude, in\ntheir view, is made up of the members having we-mode attitudes. But\nfor Tuomela and Miller, we-mode attitudes are not primitive, but are\nbuilt out of more standard attitudes. They also admit different\nspecies of group attitudes, some of which are built of I-mode\nattitudes of group members, much like Bratman does. In recent years,\npsychologists and cognitive scientists have begun to investigate\nwhether there are distinctively social attitudes (see Knoblich,\nButterfill et al. 2011, Gallotti & Frith 2013, Tomasello\n2014). \nIn addition to collective intentions, other philosophers have worked\non the analysis of other attitudes, such collective belief and\njudgment (Gilbert 1987, Wray 2001, Hakli 2006, List 2014). \nThe analysis of collective attitudes raises questions about the nature\nof group minds more generally, and whether or not they are to be\nunderstood as extensions of individual properties applied to groups. A\nnumber of theorists take a functionalist approach to group minds and\nagency. On this approach, group agents or group cognitive systems are\nunderstood to function in a similar way as individuals do, at a\ncertain level of description. A widely accepted theory of individual\nagency is that people have a modular system that we use to navigate\nthe world. We have beliefs, knowledge, form intentions, plan, reason,\nand take action. All of these components can be described in terms of\ntheir functional contributions to the system, and they integrate with\none another to perform unified functions. They compose, in other\nwords, a “system of practical activity”. Group agency is\nunderstood on this model: for group agents, the same functional system\nis realized, but by groups or distributed systems rather than by\nindividuals. (See Bratman 1987, 1993, 2014; List & Pettit 2011; Theiner &\nO’Connor 2010; Theiner 2014; Epstein forthcoming). List and\nPettit argue that such realizers constitute new “loci of\nagency”, or “groups with minds of their own”. \nOthers challenge group minds by arguing against functional treatments\nof mind altogether. Rupert (2014), for instance, argues that having\nphenomenal states is a requirement for intentionality, but that groups\ncannot have such states (see also Schwitzgebel 2015, List\nforthcoming). Other theorists object to the typical focus of this\nliterature on small unstructured collectives of adults interacting\nwith one another. They instead work on the attitudes of complex\ngroups, corporations, and large-scale systems (Hutchins 1995, Huebner\n2013). Questions of moral agency and corporate\nresponsibility may also bear on how to analyze group agency and group\nminds (see French 1979, Tollefsen 2002, Pettit 2007, Hess 2010, List\n& Pettit 2011). \nThe nature of institutions, organizations, and firms is treated more\nextensively in sociology and economics than in philosophy. Coase\n(1937, 1960) pioneered the literature on firms in economics. In\n“The Nature of the Firm”, Coase examines the question of\nwhy firms exist at all: he argues that the function of firms is to\nlower transaction costs that would otherwise have to be incurred in\nforming contracts among individuals. Coase does not distinguish the\nquestion of the function of firms from the question of what firms are.\nBut subsequent work engages more directly with ontological questions,\nincluding eliminativism about firms (Alchian & Demsetz 1972), the\n“nexus of contracts” view (Jensen & Meckling 1976),\nthe “property rights” view (Grossman & Hart 1986, Hart\n& Moore 1990), and the “resource view” (Penrose 1959,\nBarney 1991, Conner & Prahalad 1996). \nWork on firms is also tied to theories of in institutions in\neconomics, spearheaded by Oliver Williamson, Douglas North, and Elinor\nOstrom. Williamson (1979, 1981, 1996) popularized a Coase-style\napproach with theories of how institutional structures such as\nmarkets, hierarchies, multidivisional corporations, and alliances\nsolve problems of transaction costs. Ostrom’s influential work\non common pool resources treats institutions as sets of rules that\ncommunities put in place in order to change incentives and to induce\nsocially beneficial choices. The “new institutional\neconomics” program develops this largely game-theoretic\nunderstanding of institutions, tying them to analyses of the nature of\nconventions and norms (see Shepsle 1986; Sugden 1986; North 1990;\nOstrom 1990, 1995; Binmore 1998; Schotter 2008; Guala 2016). \nRecent work in organizational sociology also focuses on systems of\nrules, with organizations analyzed in terms of their\n“institutionalized” features. Rather than the explicitly\nchosen rules discussed by economists, however, here systems of rules\nare regarded as tacit and non-intentionally followed (Powell &\nDiMaggio 2012). Sociological approaches have been developed for\ninterpreting organizations, largely focused on causal explanations for\ntheir structure, power, and influence. Work on the nature of\norganizations in sociology often involves analyzing them in terms of\nsocial components or properties (see Clegg, Hardy et al. 1996, Scott\n2014). \nMuch recent interest in social ontology has been sparked by new\napproaches to race, gender, disability, and related social categories.\nHistorically, erroneous ontological claims have contributed to and\nbeen used to justify social oppression. Claims about the genetic\nnature of race, for instance, are historically tied to claims about\nintellectual, character, and cultural differences between racial\ngroups. Likewise, claims about the nature of gender differences are\nhistorically tied to claims about how women ought to behave. \nControversy over race categories, gender categories, and other\ncategories, pertains both to their construction and their essential\nproperties. The term ‘essentialism’, as applied to\ncategories such as race and gender, has a different meaning than it\ndoes in mainstream metaphysics. As applied to race, for instance,\n‘essentialism’ is often understood as synonymous with\n‘biological essentialism’—the view that races have\nsimple, natural, and heritable biological properties, such that every\nmember of a racial group has that biological property. This should not\nbe confused with a metaphysical claim that might be made by a social\nconstructivist proposing a “social essence” of race: for\ninstance, a claim that membership in a racial group essentially\ninvolves identifying with other people for reasons of solidarity, or\nthat it involves being descended from a historically and\ngeographically situated population. Such a theorist would flatly deny\n“essentialism” in the old sense, which still analyzing the\n(socially set up) essential properties of race (for a critique of\nessentialism, see Phillips 2010; see also entry on\n race). \nEliminativists argue that biological essentialism in the old sense is\ninseparable from our racial categories, so debunking racist views\nimplies that racial categories are an illusion: there are no races\n(Appiah 1985, 1994; Zack 1994, 1995). A different set of approaches\nmaintains that races are social kinds without having simple biological\nessences. Among these are historico-geographic theories,\ngenetic-bundle theories, identity theories, etc. (see Bernasconi &\nLott 2000, Zack 2002, Glasgow 2009). Other theories hold that although\nsimple biological theories are false, racial differences can be\nidentified using the methods of population biology (Andreasen 1998,\nKitcher 2007, Hardimon 2012; see also Kaplan & Winther 2014). In\nthe face of competing conceptions of race, some theorists propose\npluralism about race-like kinds (Hochman 2013, McPherson 2015). In\nmany theories of race, bi-racialism and multi-racialism have been\ntreated as boundary or marginal cases. Others argue, on the contrary,\nthat multiracialism is central to the construction of racial\ncategories (see Alcoff, Sundstrom et al. 2016). \nIn some ways, questions pertaining to the metaphysics of sex and\ngender resemble those pertaining to race: historically, descriptive\nand normative categories were conflated in simplistic biological\ntheories. An important difference between sex/gender and race,\nhowever, concerns the distinction between sex and gender (Beauvoir\n1949, West & Zimmerman 1987). Many theorists propose that sexes\nare biological categories and that genders are categories of social\nnorms and behaviors that are traditionally attached to sexes. However,\nother theorists argue that it is incorrect to regard sex as biological\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000, Butler 2004). Thus in the case of sex/gender,\nthere are arguably multiple socially constructed categories that\ninteract with one another; and some theorists reject the distinction\nbetween sex and gender (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender). \nA question pertaining to racial and gender categories alike is whether\nthese are descriptively adequate categories in the first place. Many\nof the political phenomena associated with differential treatment of\ngroups and oppression cut across lines of race, gender, and class.\nSome theorists of intersectionality argue that it is misleading to\nregard standard gender and racial groups as if they were unified (see\nCrenshaw 1991, McCall 2005, Jones 2014). \nA central problem in the ontology of race, gender, and other\ncategories is that how we categorize not only has ethical\nimplications, but is affected by ethically-laden facts. Some theorists\nchallenge the idea of a purely descriptive analysis of such groups.\nOthers propose that there can be descriptive analyses, but that such\nanalyses are a stepping stone to ethically preferable categories.\nHaslanger (2000, 2012) in particular has argued for the\n“ameliorative” analysis of racial and gender categories.\nPart of the role of social ontology is to analyze the concepts and\ncategories that are “operative” in a social system, but an\nequally important aim is to explore how we might otherwise construct\nsocial categories with the aim of social improvement. Barnes (2016)\nargues for an ameliorative account of disability (see entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience). \nThe term ‘artifact’ denotes a broad class of objects that\nare products of human activity. The paradigmatic examples are tools,\nsuch as hammers, knives, and cups, but the category of artifacts\nincludes more complex objects as well, such as cars, houses, and\ncomputers. Some theorists conceive of artifacts broadly enough that\nthe category includes nearly all social entities, from hammers to\nHamlet. \nThe standard rough characterization of an artifact is that it is an\nobject created by people to perform some function (see Hilpinen\n1992a, Dipert 1993; entry\non\n artifact).\n This characterization excludes objects that are used to perform\nfunctions but are not made by a person. A rock might be used as a\nhammer, or a piece of driftwood as decoration. Other objects are made\nby people but without any functional intention, such as scraps of\nmetal produced in making a blade. The functionality of an object can\nalso be de-coupled from its making: someone might, for instance,\ndecide that an unmodified pile of scrap metal is sculpture. \nThis definition requires an understanding of the role—and\nperhaps the necessity—of intention. Many objects that we presume\nto be artifacts are not accompanied by human intentions directly. A\nmachine, for example, might automatically hammer out thousands of\nblades, which the machine stacks into boxes. A particular blade in one\nof those boxes would typically be considered an artifact even though\nno human was ever aware of that blade’s existence, to say\nnothing of having created it for a reason. Millikan (1984) argues that\ncertain entities can be understood as having “derived\nfunctions”, when their intended role is part of the explanation\nfor their being reproduced. Thomasson (2003, 2007) develops this idea\nfurther, arguing that the function of an artifact is always in\nprinciple knowable to the creator. Elder (2004, 2007) develops\nMillikan’s approach in an opposing direction, arguing that\nartifacts are copied kinds but need not be accompanied by creator\nintention. \nThese and other accounts hold that artifacts ontologically depend on\nhistorical facts, often historical intentions of the creator. Others\nargue that the emphasis on historical processes is misguided, and that\nwhat matters is how an object is used in the present (Keil, Greif et\nal. 2007; Preston 2009, 2013). Not everyone agrees that artifacts must\nhave a function (or an intended function). Objects such as doodles and\nrock stacks are created without either functions or functional\nintentions. Even if artifacts necessarily involve functions, the role\nof functions in distinguishing artifactual kinds from one another\nmight be debated. It may be that artifactual kinds are individuated by\nfunction, but many artifactual kinds (such as houses) seem to have\nmultiple functions, and some sets of distinct artifactual kinds (such\nas bicycles and tricycles) may all have the same function. \nTheories of artifacts draw from the literature on the ontology of art\n(see, for instance, Bloom 1996, Levinson 2007), and many theories of\nartworks regard them to be kinds of artifacts (see Eaton 1969,\nIseminger 1973, Hilpinen 1992b, Thomasson 1999). \nProblems in the ontology of art include the ontological categories\ninto which artworks fall, the unity or diversity of kinds of entities\nwithin artistic domains and across domains (e.g., in painting,\nsculpture, music, dance), the individuation of particular artworks,\nthe definition of art in general, and the dynamic changes in artistic\ncategories. See entries on the\n definition of art,\n history of the ontology of art,\n the philosophy of music,\n the philosophy of dance,\n conceptual art,\n and\n the philosophy of digital art. \nMenger (1892) tells a story of the emergence of money from trading\npractices. For a society to come to have money, Menger argues, it is\nnot required that anyone in the society made a choice to adopt a\nmedium as money. Instead, in the course of transactions in the\nmarketplace, the marketability of certain goods will tend to increase,\nand as a result, these goods acquire a degree of\n“money-character”. Money, in Menger’s view, is\nsimply a good that is highly marketable in transactions, and therefore\nhighly liquid. \nThe centerpiece of Menger’s account is the non-intentional\nemergence of money (see Aydinonat 2008, Tieffenbach 2010). But his\naccount also gives an implicit theory of the nature of money. Money is\na simple causal-role kind, with any good that is highly liquid and\nmarketable being money. Introductory economics textbooks tend to\ndefine money as a slightly more complicated role-kind: money is a\nstore of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account (Arnold\n2008, Mankiw 2016). Recent work in economics suggests a different set\nof functions for money. A striking feature of standard economic models\nis that money seems superfluous. In idealized neo-classical economies,\nthere is no need for a medium of exchange, nor is it clear why price\nlevels should affect the “real economy” of production and\nconsumption. Thus economists have recently investigated the economic\n“frictions” that make money useful, and find that money\ncontributes to efficiency in a market that has imperfect\nenforceability of contracts and limited record-keeping. In such an\neconomy, money helps perform operations such as the search for trading\npartners. The overcoming of such economic “frictions”\nseems to be an alternative and perhaps underlying function of money.\n(See Diamond 1984, Kiyotaki & Wright 1989, Kocherlakota 1998,\nWright 2010, Smit, Buekens et al. 2016.) \nThese discussions imply that money is a causal-role kind of some sort.\nThis is questionable, however: such a definition fails to accommodate\ntokens of money that fail to perform those roles (such as a coin\nburied in the ground). Instead, money may be better understood as a\ndifferent sort of functional kind, or perhaps as an artifactual kind\n(see\n section 5.5).\n Alternatively, the nature of money may not involve its functions at\nall. Aristotle (Politics 1.8–10) notes that there are\nseveral distinct functions performed by money, each of which would\nnaturally have its own essence; but he points out that we use the same\nmedium for all of these. The money in any given society, he argues, is\na product of agreement in that society. \nA story is sometimes told of a historical progression from barter to\nthe use of “commodity money” (such as gold, cowrie shells,\nor beads) to the use of “fiat money” (such as\ngovernment-issued paper currency) (see Searle 1995, McEachern 2011).\nSearle argues that all kinds of money are “institutional\nkinds”, which he analyzes in terms of the collective assignment\nof a function to a substrate. Commodity money, in his view, involves\nassignment to a good with some intrinsic value, while fiat money\ninvolves assignment to a piece of paper printed by the government. \nHistorians of money and monetary theorists divide kinds of money along\nmore nuanced dimensions. A few historical cases may qualify as fiat\nmoney, such as in Ming dynasty China, revolutionary France, and the\nAmerican Confederacy, but these were fragile and subject to collapse\n(Yang 1952, Ferguson 2008, Spang 2015). But many contemporary\napproaches emphasize the role of private interactions in the creation\nof money, and importantly, reserve banking as well as credit and debt\nmarkets. Other theories emphasize the role of the state, and in\nparticular the central roles of interest-rate-setting institutions,\ngovernment debt, and the collection of taxes (see Friedman &\nSchwartz 1963, Kaldor 1985, Moore 1988, Deleplace & Nell 1996). In\nthese approaches, questions about the “substance” of money\nbecome rather peripheral. \nSome controversies persist on the substance of money. It was part of\nhistorical debates over the gold standard and\n“bimetallism”, and more recently there has been\nphilosophical discussion of electronic money (Smith & Searle 2003)\nand “cryptocurrencies” such as bitcoin. An ongoing problem\nfor work in the nature of money is the blurring of distinctions\nbetween questions about ontology, about the evolution of money, about\nwhat drives the money supply, and about what makes a monetary system\nstable. \nMany important questions in social ontology are connected to\njurisprudence, or the study of the nature of law itself. Consider a\ngiven legal obligation or prohibition in a locality, such as a U.S.\nfederal law on reporting requirements for public corporations, or a\nstate law governing medical reimbursements. Lawyers and judges mainly\nwork on specific applications of such laws, such as whether a\nparticular corporation satisfying a particular reporting requirement.\nIn certain circumstances lawyers and judges investigate and interpret\nthe content of the law, such as whether some provision is incompatible\nwith the Constitution. \nThe study of the nature of law is distinct from these. It can be\ndivided into two principal inquiries, corresponding to the division\nbetween the “constituents” and “sources”\ndiscussed in sections\n 3\n and\n 4.\n The first inquiry examines what determines or grounds the content of\nlaws in general, within a legal system. For instance, is the content\nof a law exhaustively determined by the statutes recorded in the legal\ncode? Or is that only a part of what determines the content of a law?\nOther candidate contributors to the content of a law are historical\njudicial interpretations, jury decisions, patterns of practices,\nlegislative actions and intentions, executive statements, general\nlegal principles, and moral principles. Hart (1961) casts this\nquestion as the inquiry into the “rule of recognition” in\na legal system: that is, what conditions a proposition needs to\nsatisfy in order for it to be a law (see also Dworkin 1967, 1978,\n1986; Greenawalt 1986; Shapiro 2007, 2009). \nA second question is: What are the sources of these contributors to\nthe content of the law? In virtue of what do texts or enactments or\ninterpretations or moral considerations figure into grounding the\ncontent of a nation’s laws? Positivist theories hold that social\npractices and other sociological facts are the sources of legality;\nnatural law theories argue instead that legality is rooted in human\nnature and that legal standards are independent of human decision and\npractice. A central problem for any theory of the sources of law is\nthe authority, or bindingness, which law carries (if it does carry\nthese). See the articles in J.L. Coleman, Shapiro, & Himma 2002,\nas well as entries on the\n nature of law,\n natural law theories,\n legal positivism,\n and\n the economic analysis of law. \nOther issues in the ontology of law pertain to the nature of entities\nthat pervade the law, such as contracts (Fried 1981, Barnett 1985,\nHart & Holmstrom 1986), promises (Scanlon 1990, Kolodny &\nWallace 2003, Owens 2006, Shiffrin 2008), and torts (J.L. Coleman\n1982, 1983, Postema 2001). The law also plays a central role in\nsetting up certain social categories, such as marriage and\ncorporations. Marriage is tightly regulated by the law in many\ncultures. Does the law define what marriage is, or is marriage set up\nwholly or in part by social practices? Likewise for corporations: does\nthe law have a privileged role in determining what types of\ncorporations exist in a modern society, or are corporations products\nof social and economic systems? (See\n section 5.3.) \nSocial ontology also has implications for the practice of lawmaking\nand adjudication. Theorists of corporate liability, for instance,\ninvestigate the nature of corporate agency and responsibility, and the\nrelation between these and the agency and responsibility of individual\npeople connected to the corporation (French 1984, Fisse &\nBraithwaite 1993, Erskine 2003, Gobert & Punch 2003, Pettit 2007).\nThe law is also often called on to adjudicate ontological questions,\nsuch as whether goods of a certain kind fall under a clause of a trade\nagreement, or whether a particular act is an instance of a\ncriminalized activity. \nMuch work in linguistics and the philosophy of language involves\nclaims and assumptions about the nature of linguistic entities, such\nas linguistic rules, components of the language faculty, and semantic\ncontent. Theories of the nature of language and meaning are also\ninfluential models for the metaphysics of other social entities (such\nas artifacts, institutions, and laws). \nThe most conspicuous debate about the “nature of\nlanguage”—namely, the debate over innateness—does\nnot have much to do with the metaphysics of language. Like most\nphenomena involving the human mind, language is causally affected by\nsocial factors. A person’s vocabulary and grammar, for instance,\nare affected by interactions with parents, peers, and other community\nmembers. Just how significant these causal effects are is widely\ndebated in linguistics, with many in the Chomskian tradition favoring\ninnate constraints on the mental structures of language and others\nrejecting innatism (see Chomsky 1986, 2000; Tomasello 1992, 1995;\nElman, Bates et al. 1996; Kirby 1999). The question of the nature of\nlanguage, however, is to a large extent independent of innatism versus\nanti-innatism. Interactions with other people may contribute only a\nbit to an individual’s mental structures, or they may\nfundamentally shape them—but in either case a person’s\nlanguage may or may not ontologically depend only on that\nperson’s brain states. \nChomsky (1986) does take an explicit position on the nature of\nlanguage and its ontological building blocks. He argues that\nlinguistics is the science of “I-languages”—i.e.,\ninternalized languages, the mental rules of grammar, phonology, and so\non, that individuals use in expressing themselves or understanding the\nutterances of others. He rejects\n“E-languages”—externalized or public languages like\nEnglish, Chinese, and Khosa—as unscientific fictions. Others\ndisagree on various grounds. Katz and Postal (1991) share\nChomsky’s view that each person has his or her own language, but\nargue that languages are abstract or mathematical entities rather than\npsychological ones (see also Higginbotham 1991). Wittgenstein (1953)\nand his successors have a more substantive disagreement: Wittgenstein\ndenies the possibility of a “private language” altogether,\narguing that language is a matter of engagement of people with one\nanother and with the world. Other philosophers have argued for the\npublicity and externality of language on a variety of grounds,\nincluding the communicative basis of language, the nature of rules,\nand theories of semantic content (see Kripke 1972, 1982; Schiffer\n1972; Lewis 1975; Putnam 1975; Burge 1979; Brandom 1994; Dummett 1989;\nand entries on\n theories of meaning,\n externalism about mental content,\n names,\n and\n the normativity of meaning and content). \nTheories of words, phonemes, and other linguistic entities are tied to\nthe metaphysics of language more generally, but also are subjects of\nseparate inquiries. The extent to which these are questions for social\nontology, rather than, say, the metaphysics of psychological states,\ndepends in part on whether and how language is public. Kaplan (1990),\nfor instance, argues that words are entities extended over time and\nacross a population: “utterances and inscriptions are\nstages of words, which are the continuants made up\nof these interpersonal stages”. This approach is in contrast to\ntype-token theories, some of which regard word-types to be socially\nindividuated, and others individualistically individuated (see Hugly\n& Sayward 1981, Bromberger 1989, McCulloch 1991, Cappelen 1999,\nWetzel 2009, Hawthorne & Lepore 2011). The nature of words is also\ntied to the question of whether a word’s meaning is essential to\nit (Kaplan 1990, Alward 2005, Simchen 2012), and to the distinctions\nbetween various types of words in linguistics, such as phonological\nwords, syntactic atoms, morphological words, and lexical words (see\nSelkirk 1984, Di Sciullo & Williams 1987, Hall 1999, Raffelsiefen\n1999, Julien 2007). Similar issues arise in connection with sentences,\nutterances, and quotation (Davidson 1979, J. Bennett 1988, Washington\n1992, Cappelen & Lepore 1997, Recanati 2001,\nGarcía-Carpintero 2004b, Predelli 2008, Saka 2013). \nSpeech acts make up another domain in which social factors are\nplausibly constitutive. Austin (1962) and Searle (1969) argue that the\nforce of any speech act is a product of a social convention pertaining\nto speech acts of that type. Others use an\n“intentionalist” approach, in which the force of a speech\nact is a product only of the intentions of the speaker. Yet others\nargue that this force is a product of the uptake by hearers in\naddition to speaker intentions (see Strawson 1964, Bach & Harnish\n1979, Clark & Carlson 1982, García-Carpintero 2004a, and entries on\n speech acts,\n assertion).","contact.mail":"brian.epstein@tufts.edu","contact.domain":"tufts.edu"}]
