But it is often not any easier with smaller groups,\nsuch as, when a committee must select a candidate to hire, or when a\ngroup of friends must decide where to go for dinner. Mathematicians,\nphilosophers, political scientists and economists have devised various\nvoting methods that select a winner (or winners) from a set of\nalternatives taking into account everyone’s opinion. It is not hard to\nfind examples in which different voting methods select different\nwinners given the same inputs from the members of the group. What\ncriteria should be used to compare and contrast different voting\nmethods? Not only is this an interesting and difficult theoretical\nquestion, but it also has important practical ramifications. Given the\ntumultuous 2016 election cycle, many people (both researchers and\npoliticians) have suggested that the US should use a different voting\nmethod. However, there is little agreement about which voting method\nshould be used. \n\n\nThis article introduces and critically examines a number of different\nvoting methods. Deep and important results in the theory of social\nchoice suggest that there is no single voting method that is best in\nall situations (see List 2013 for an overview). My objective in this\narticle is to highlight and discuss the key results and issues that\nfacilitate comparisons between voting methods. \n\nSuppose that there is a group of 21 voters who need to make a decision\nabout which of four candidates should be elected. Let the names of the\ncandidates be \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). Your job, as a social\nplanner, is to determine which of these 4 candidates should win the\nelection given the opinions of all the voters. The first step\nis to elicit the voters’ opinions about the candidates. Suppose that\nyou ask each voter to rank the 4 candidates from best to worst (not\nallowing ties). The following table summarizes the voters’ rankings of\nthe candidates in this hypothetical election scenario.  \nRead the table as follows: Each row represents a ranking for a group of voters\nin which candidates to the left are ranked higher. The numbers in the first column\n indicate the number of voters with that particular\nranking. So, for example, the third row in the table indicates that\n7 voters have the ranking \\(B\\s D\\s C\\s A\\) which means that each of the 7 voters \nrank \\(B\\) first, \\(D\\) second, \\(C\\) third and \\(A\\) last.\nSuppose that, as the social planner, you do not have any personal\ninterest in the outcome of this election. Given the voters’ expressed\nopinions, which candidate should win the election? Since the voters\ndisagree about the ranking of the candidates, there is no obvious\ncandidate that best represents the group’s opinion. If there were\nonly two candidates to choose from, there is a very straightforward\nanswer: The winner should be the candidate or alternative that is supported\nby more than 50 percent of the voters (cf. the discussion below about\nMay’s Theorem in Section 4.2). However, if there are more than two\ncandidates, as in the above example, the statement “the\ncandidate that is supported by more than 50 percent of the\nvoters” can be interpreted in different ways, leading to\ndifferent ideas about who should win the election.  \nOne candidate who, at first sight, seems to be a good choice to win\nthe election is \\(A\\). Candidate \\(A\\) is ranked first by more voters\nthan any other candidate. (\\(A\\) is ranked first by 8 voters,\n\\(B\\) is ranked first by 7; \\(C\\) is ranked first by 6; and\n\\(D\\) is not ranked first by any of the voters.) Of course, 13 people\nrank \\(A\\) last. So, while more voters rank \\(A\\) first than\nany other candidate, more than half of the voters rank \\(A\\) last.\nThis suggests that \\(A\\) should not be elected.  \nNone of the voters rank \\(D\\) first. This fact alone does not rule out\n\\(D\\) as a possible winner of the election. However, note that\nevery voter ranks candidate \\(B\\) above candidate \\(D\\). While this\ndoes not mean that \\(B\\) should necessarily win the election, it does\nsuggest that \\(D\\) should not win the election.  \nThe choice, then, boils down to \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). It turns out that  there are good\narguments for each of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to be elected. The debate about\nwhich of \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) should be elected started in the 18th-century\nas an argument between the two founding fathers of voting theory,\nJean-Charles de Borda (1733–1799) and M.J.A.N. de Caritat,\nMarquis de Condorcet (1743–1794). For a history of voting theory\nas an academic discipline, including Condorcet’s and Borda’s writings,\nsee McLean and Urken (1995). I sketch the intuitive arguments for the\nelection of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) below. \nCandidate \\(C\\) should win. Initially, this might seem like\nan odd choice since both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) receive more first place\nvotes than \\(C\\) (only 6 voters rank \\(C\\)  first while 8 voters  rank \\(A\\) \nfirst  and 7 voters  rank \\(B\\) first). However, note \nhow the population would vote in the various two-way elections comparing \n\\(C\\) with each of the other candidates:  \nCondorcet’s idea is that \\(C\\) should be declared the winner since she beats\nevery other candidate in a one-on-one election. A candidate with this\nproperty is called a Condorcet winner. We can similarly define\na Condorcet loser. In fact, in the above example, candidate\n\\(A\\) is the Condorcet loser since she loses to every other candidate\nin  a one-on-one election. \nCandidate \\(B\\) should win. Consider \\(B\\)’s performance in\nthe one-on-one elections.  \nCandidate \\(B\\) performs the same as \\(C\\) in a head-to-head election\nwith \\(A\\), loses to \\(C\\) by only one vote and beats \\(D\\) in a\nlandslide (everyone prefers \\(B\\) over \\(D\\)). Borda suggests that we should\ntake into account all of these facts when determining which\ncandidate best represents the overall group opinion.   To do this, Borda \nassigns a score to each candidate that reflects  how much support he or she has \namong the electorate. Then, the\ncandidate with the largest score is declared the winner. One way to\ncalculate the score for each candidate is as follows (I will give an\nalternative method, which is easier to use, in the next section):  \nThe candidate with the highest score (in this case, \\(B\\)) is the one\nwho should be elected.  Both Condorcet and Borda suggest comparing candidates in\none-on-one elections in order to determine the winner. While Condorcet\ntallies how many of the head-to-head races each candidate wins, Borda\nsuggests that one should look at the margin of victory or loss.   \nThe debate about whether to elect the Condorcet winner or the Borda\nwinner is not settled. Proponents of electing the Condorcet winner\ninclude Mathias Risse (2001, 2004, 2005) and Steven Brams (2008);\nProponents of electing the Borda winner include Donald Saari (2003,\n2006) and Michael Dummett (1984).   See Section 3.1.1\nfor further issues comparing the Condorcet and Borda winners. \n \nThe take-away message from this discussion is that in many election\nscenarios with more than two candidates, there may not always be one\nobvious candidate that best reflects the overall group opinion. The\nremainder of this entry will discuss different methods, or procedures,\nthat can be used to determine the winner(s) given the a group of\nvoters’ opinions. Each of these methods is intended to be an answer to\nthe following question:  \nGiven a group of people faced with some decision, how should a central\nauthority combine the individual opinions so as to best reflect the\n“overall group opinion”?\n \nA complete analysis of this question would incorporate a number of\ndifferent issues ranging from central topics in political philosophy\nabout the nature of democracy and the “will of the people”\nto the psychology of decision making. In this article, I focus on one\naspect of this question: the formal analysis of algorithms that aggregate \nthe  opinions of a group  of  voters (i.e., voting methods).  Consult, for \nexample, Riker 1982, Mackie 2003, and Christiano 2008 for a more comprehensive \nanalysis of the above question, incorporating many of the issues raised in \nthis article.  \nIn this article, I will keep the formal details to a minimum; however,\nit is useful at this point to settle on some terminology. Let \\(V\\)\nand \\(X\\) be finite sets. The elements of \\(V\\) are called voters and\nI will use lowercase letters \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) or integers \\(1, 2,\n3, \\ldots\\) to denote them. The elements of \\(X\\) are called\ncandidates, or alternatives, and I will use uppercase letters \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots \\) to denote them.  \nDifferent voting methods require different types of information from\nthe voters as input. The input requested from the voters are called\nballots. One standard example of a ballot is a ranking\nof the set of candidates. Formally, a ranking of \\(X\\) is a relation\n\\(P\\) on \\(X\\), where \\(Y\\mathrel{P} Z\\) means that “\\(Y\\) is\nranked above \\(Z\\),” satisfying three constraints: (1) \\(P\\) is\ncomplete: any two distinct candidates are ranked (for all\ncandidates \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\), if \\(Y\\ne Z\\), then either \\(Y\\mathrel{P}\nZ\\) or \\(Z\\mathrel{P} Y\\)); (2) \\(P\\) is transitive: if a\ncandidate \\(Y\\) is ranked above a candidate \\(W\\) and \\(W\\) is\nranked above a   candidate \\(Z\\), then \\(Y\\) is ranked above\n\\(Z\\) (for all\ncandidates \\(Y, Z\\), and \\(W\\), if \\(Y\\mathrel{P} W\\) and \\(W\\mathrel{P} Z\\), then \\(Y\\mathrel{P} Z\\)); and (3) \\(P\\) is irreflexive: no candidate is ranked\nabove itself (there is no candidate \\(Y\\) such that \\(Y\\mathrel{P}\nY\\)). For example, suppose that there are three candidates \\(X =\\{A,\nB, C\\}\\). Then, the six possible rankings of \\(X\\) are listed in the\nfollowing table:  \nI can now be more precise about the definition of a Condorcet winner\n(loser). Given a ranking  from each voter, the majority\nrelation orders the candidates in terms of how they perform in\none-on-one elections. More precisely, for candidates \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\),\nwrite \\(Y \\mathrel{>_M} Z\\), provided that more voters rank candidate\n\\(Y\\) above candidate \\(Z\\) than the other way around. So, if the\ndistribution of rankings is given in the above table, we have:  \nA candidate \\(Y\\) is called the Condorcet winner in an election\nscenario if \\(Y\\) is the maximum of the majority ordering \\(>_M\\) for\nthat election scenario (that is, \\(Y\\) is the Condorcet winner if\n\\(Y\\mathrel{>_M} Z\\) for all other candidates \\(Z\\)). The Condorcet\nloser is the candidate that is the minimum of the majority\nordering.  \nRankings are one type of ballot. In this article, we will see examples\nof other types of ballots, such as selecting a single candidate,\nselecting a subset of candidates or assigning grades to candidates.\nGiven a set of ballots \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), a profile for a set of\nvoters specifies  the ballot selected by each voter. Formally, a\nprofile for set of voters \\(V=\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}\\) and a set of ballots\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a sequence \\(\\bb=(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)\\), where\nfor each voter \\(i\\), \\(b_i\\) is the ballot from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)\nsubmitted by voter \\(i\\).  \nA voting method is a function that assigns to each possible\nprofile a group decision. The group decision may be a single\ncandidate (the winning candidate), a set of candidates (when ties are\nallowed), or an ordering of the candidates (possibly allowing ties). \nNote  that since a profile identifies the voter associated with each  ballot, a\n voting method may take this information into account.  This means that\n voting methods can be designed that select a winner (or winners) based only\n on the ballots  of some subset of voters while ignoring all  the other voters’ ballots.  \n An extreme example of this  is the so-called Arrovian dictatorship for voter \\(d\\) \n that assigns to each profile the candidate ranked first by  \\(d\\). \n A natural way  to  rule out these types of  voting methods  is to require that \n  a voting method is anonymous: the group decision should \n depend only on  the number of voters that chose each ballot. This means that \n if two profiles are permutations of each other, then a voting method that is \n anonymous must assign the same group decision to both profiles. When studying \n voting methods that are anonymous, it is convenient to assume the inputs are anonymized\nprofiles. An anonymous profile for a set of ballots\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a function from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) to the set of\nintegers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). The election scenario discussed in the\nprevious section is an example of an anonymized profile (assuming that\neach ranking not displayed in the table is assigned the number 0). In\nthe remainder of this article (unless otherwise specified), I will\nrestrict attention to anonymized profiles. \n  \nI conclude this section with a few comments on the relationship\nbetween the ballots in a profile and the voters’ opinions about the\ncandidates. Two issues are important to keep in mind. First, the\nballots used by a voting method are intended to reflect some\naspect of the voters’ opinions about the candidates. Voters may choose\na ballot that best expresses their personal preference about the set\nof candidates or their judgements about the relative strengths of the\ncandidates. A common assumption in the voting theory literature is\nthat a ranking of the set of candidates expresses a voter’s\nordinal preference ordering over the set of candidates (see\nthe entry on preferences, Hansson and Grüne-Yanoff 2009, for an\nextended discussion of issues surrounding the formal modeling of\npreferences). Other types of ballots represent information that cannot\nbe inferred directly from a voter’s ordinal preference\nordering, for example, by describing the intensity of a\npreference for a particular candidate (see Section 2.3). Second, it is\nimportant to be precise about the type of considerations voters take\ninto account when selecting a ballot. One approach is to assume that\nvoters choose sincerely by selecting the ballot that best\nreflects their opinion about the the different candidates. A second\napproach assumes that the voters choose strategically. In\nthis case, a voter selects a ballot that she expects to lead\nto her most desired outcome given the information she has about how\nthe other members of the group will vote. Strategic voting is an\nimportant topic in voting theory and social choice theory (see Taylor\n2005 and Section 3.3 of List 2013 for a discussion and pointers to the \nliterature), but in this article, unless otherwise stated, I assume \nthat voters choose sincerely (cf. Section 4.1). \nA quick survey of elections held in different democratic societies\nthroughout the world reveals a wide variety of voting methods. In this\nsection, I discuss some of the key methods that have been analyzed in\nthe voting theory literature. These methods may be of interest because\nthey are widely used (e.g., Plurality Rule or Plurality Rule with\nRunoff) or because they are of theoretical interest (e.g., Dodgson’s\nmethod).  \nI start with the most widely used method: \nPlurality Rule:\n\nEach voter selects one candidate (or none if voters can abstain), and\nthe candidate(s) with the most votes win.\n \nPlurality rule (also called First Past the Post) is a very\nsimple method that is widely used despite its many problems. The most\npervasive problem is the fact that plurality rule can elect a\nCondorcet loser. Borda (1784) observed this phenomenon in the 18th\ncentury (see also the example from Section 1).  \nCandidate \\(A\\) is the Condorcet loser (both \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) beat\ncandidate \\(A\\), 13 – 8); however, \\(A\\) is the plurality rule\nwinner (assuming the voters vote for the candidate that they rank first). \nIn fact, the plurality ranking (\\(A\\) is first with 8\nvotes, \\(B\\) is second with 7 votes and \\(C\\) is third with 6\nvotes) reverses the majority ordering \\(C\\mathrel{>_M} B\\mathrel{>_M}\nA\\). See Laslier 2012 for further criticisms of Plurality Rule and\ncomparisons with other voting methods discussed in this article. One\nresponse to the above phenomenon is to require that candidates pass a\ncertain threshold to be declared the winner.  \nQuota Rule:\n\nSuppose that \\(q\\), called the quota, is any number between 0\nand 1. Each voter selects one candidate (or none if voters can\nabstain), and the winners are the candidates that receive at least\n\\(q \\times \\# V\\) votes, where \\(\\# V\\) is the number of voters. \nMajority Rule is a quota rule with \\(q=0.5\\) (a candidate is the\nstrict or absolute majority winner if that candidate\nreceives strictly more than \\(0.5 \\times \\# V\\) votes). Unanimity\nRule is a quota rule with \\(q=1\\).\n \nAn important problem with quota rules is that they do not identify a\nwinner in every election scenario. For instance, in the above election\nscenario, there are no majority winners since none of the candidates\nare ranked first by more than 50% of the voters.  \nA criticism of both plurality and quota rules is that they severely\nlimit what voters can express about their opinions of the candidates.\nIn the remainder of this section, I discuss voting methods that use\nballots that are more expressive than simply selecting a single\ncandidate. Section 2.1 discusses voting methods that require voters to\nrank the alternatives. Section 2.2 discusses voting methods that\nrequire voters to assign grades to the alternatives (from some fixed\nset of grades). Finally, Section 2.3 discusses two voting methods in\nwhich the voters may have different levels of influence on the group\ndecision. In this article, I focus on voting methods that either are\nfamiliar or help illustrate important ideas. Consult Brams and\nFishburn 2002, Felsenthal 2012, and Nurmi 1987 for discussions of\nvoting methods not covered in this article.  \nThe voting methods discussed in this section require the voters to\nrank the candidates (see section 1.1 for the definition of a\nranking). Providing a ranking of the candidates is much more\nexpressive than simply selecting a single candidate. However,\nranking all of the candidates can be very demanding,\nespecially when there is a large number of them, since it can be\ndifficult for voters to make distinctions between all the\ncandidates. The most well-known example of a voting method that uses\nthe voters’ rankings is Borda Count:  \nBorda Count:\n\nEach voter provides a ranking of the candidates. Then, a score (the\nBorda score) is assigned to each candidate by a voter as follows: If\nthere are \\(n\\) candidates, give \\(n-1\\) points to the candidate ranked\nfirst, \\(n-2\\) points to the candidate ranked second,…, 1 point to\nthe candidate ranked second to last and 0 points to candidate ranked\nlast. So, the Borda score of candidate \\(A\\), denoted \\(\\BS(A)\\), is\ncalculated as follows (where \\(\\#U\\) denotes the number elements in\nthe set \\(U)\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\BS(A) =\\ &(n-1)\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) first}\\}\\\\\n  &+ (n-2)\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) second}\\} \\\\\n  &+ \\cdots \\\\\n  &+ 1\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) second to last}\\}\\\\\n  &+ 0\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) last}\\} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\nThe candidate with the highest Borda score wins.\n \nRecall the example discussed in the introduction to Section 1. For\neach alternative, the Borda scores can be calculated using the above\nmethod:  \nBorda Count is an example of a scoring rule. A scoring rule is\nany method that calculates a score based on weights assigned to\ncandidates according to where they fall in the voters’ rankings. That\nis, a scoring rule for \\(n\\) candidates is defined as follows: Fix a\nsequence of numbers \\((s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n)\\) where \\(s_k\\ge\ns_{k+1}\\) for all \\(k=1,\\ldots, n-1\\). For each \\(k\\),  \\(s_k \\)\nis the score assigned to a alternatives ranked in position \\(k\\).\nThen, the score for alternative \\(A\\), denoted \\(Score(A)\\), is\ncalculated as follows: \nBorda count for \\(n\\) alternatives uses scores \\((n-1, n-2, \\ldots,\n0)\\) (call \\(\\BS(X)\\)  the Borda score for candidate \\(X\\)).  \nNote that Plurality Rule can be viewed as a scoring rule that\nassigns 1 point to the first ranked candidate and 0 points to the\nother candidates. So, the plurality score of a candidate \\(X\\) is the number \nof voters that rank \\(X\\)  first.  Building on this idea, \\(k\\)-Approval Voting\nis a scoring method that gives 1 point to each candidate that is\nranked in position \\(k\\) or higher, and 0 points to all other\ncandidates. To illustrate \\(k\\)-Approval Voting, consider the\nfollowing election scenario:  \n Note that the Condorcet winner is \\(A\\), so none of the above\nmethods guarantee that the Condorcet winner is elected\n(whether \\(A\\) is elected using 1-Approval or 3-Approval depends on\nthe tie-breaking mechanism that is used).  \nA second way to make a voting method sensitive to more than the\nvoters’ top choice is to hold “multi-stage” elections. The\nidea is to successively remove candidates that perform poorly in the\nelection until there is one candidate that is ranked first by more\nthan 50% of the voters (i.e., there is a strict majority winner). The\ndifferent stages can be actual “runoff” elections in which\nvoters are asked to evaluate a reduced set of candidates; or they can\nbe built in to the way the winner is calculated by asking voters to\nsubmit rankings over the set of all candidates. The first example of a\nmulti-stage method is used to elect the French president.  \nPlurality with Runoff:\n\nStart with a plurality vote to determine the top two candidates (the\ncandidates ranked first and second according to their plurality scores).\nIf a candidate is ranked first by more than 50% of the voters, then\nthat candidate is declared the winner. If there is no candidate with\na strict majority of first place votes, then there is a runoff\nbetween the top two candidates (or more if there are ties). The\ncandidate(s) with the most votes in the runoff elections is(are) declared the\nwinner(s).\n \nRather than focusing on the top two candidates, one can also\niteratively remove the candidate(s) with the fewest first-place votes:\n \nThe Hare Rule:\n\nThe ballots are rankings of the candidates. If a candidate is ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters, then that candidate is declared\nthe winner. If there is no candidate with a strict majority of first\nplace votes, repeatedly delete the candidate or candidates that\nreceive the fewest first-place votes (i.e., the candidate(s) with the lowest plurality \nscore(s)). The first candidate to be ranked\nfirst by strict majority of voters is declared the winner (if there is\nno such candidate, then the remaining candidate(s) are declared the\nwinners).\n \n\t\nThe Hare Rule is also called Ranked-Choice Voting, Alternative Vote, and \nInstant Runoff.  If there are only three candidates, then the above two voting methods\nare the same (removing the candidate with the lowest plurality score is\nthe same as keeping the two candidates with highest and second-highest plurality score). The following example\nshows that they can select different winners when there are more than\nthree candidates:  \nCandidate \\(A\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner: Candidates \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are the top two candidates, being ranked first by 7 and 5\nvoters, respectively. In the runoff election (using the rankings from\nthe above table), the groups voting for candidates \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)\ntransfer their support to candidates \\(B\\) and \\(A,\\) respectively,\nwith \\(A\\) winning 10 – 9.  \nCandidate \\(D\\) is the Hare Rule winner: In the first round, candidate\n\\(C\\) is eliminated since she is only ranked first by 3 voters. This\ngroup’s votes are transferred to \\(D\\), giving him 7 votes. This means\nthat in the second round, candidate \\(B\\) is ranked first by the\nfewest voters (5 voters rank \\(B\\) first in the profile with candidate\n\\(C\\) removed), and so is eliminated. After the elimination of\ncandidate \\(B\\), candidate \\(D\\) has a strict majority of the\nfirst-place votes: 12 voters ranking him first (note that in this\nround the group in the second column transfers all their votes to\n\\(D\\) since \\(C\\) was eliminated in an earlier round).  \nThe core idea of multi-stage methods is to successively remove\ncandidates that perform \"poorly\" in an election. For the Hare Rule,\nperforming poorly is interpreted as receiving the fewest first place\nvotes. There are other ways to identify \"poorly performing\" candidates\nin an election scenario. For instance, the Coombs Rule successively\nremoves candidates that are ranked last by the most voters (see\nGrofman and Feld 2004 for an overview of Coombs Rule).  \nCoombs Rule:\n\nThe ballots are rankings of the candidates. If a candidate is ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters, then that candidate is declared\nthe winner. If there is no candidate with a strict majority of first\nplace votes, repeatedly delete the candidate or candidates that\nreceive the most last-place votes. The first candidate to be ranked\nfirst by a strict majority of voters is declared the winner (if there is\nno such candidate, then the remaining candidate(s) are declared the\nwinners).\n \nIn the above example, candidate \\(B\\) wins the election using Coombs\nRule. In the first round, \\(A\\), with 9 last-place votes, is\neliminated. Then, candidate \\(B\\) receives 12 first-place votes, which\nis a strict majority, and so is declared the winner.   There is  a technical issue that is important to keep in mind regarding \n\tthe above definitions of the multi-stage voting methods.  When  identifying \n\tthe poorly performing candidates in each round, there may be ties (i.e., there \nmay  be more than one candidate with the lowest plurality  score or more  than one candidate\nranked last by the most voters).  In the above definitions, I assume that all of the poorly \nperforming candidates will be removed in each round.   An alternative approach would use a tie-breaking rule to select one of the poorly performing candidates to be removed at each round.    \n \nThe voting methods discussed in this section can be viewed as\ngeneralizations of scoring methods, such as Borda Count. In a scoring\nmethod, a voter’s ranking is an assignment of grades (e.g.,\n\"1st place\", \"2nd place\", \"3rd place\", ... , \"last place\") to the\ncandidates. Requiring voters to rank all the candidates means that (1)\nevery candidate is assigned a grade, (2) there are the same number of\npossible grades as the number of candidates, and (3) different\ncandidates must be assigned different grades. In this section, we drop\nassumptions (2) and (3), assuming a fixed number of grades for every\nset of candidates and allowing different candidates to be assigned the\nsame grade.  \nThe first example gives voters the option to either select a candidate\nthat they want to vote for (as in plurality rule) or to\nselect a candidate that they want to vote against. \nNegative Voting:\n\nEach voter is allowed to choose one candidate to either vote\nfor (giving the candidate one point) or to vote\nagainst (giving the candidate –1 points). The winner(s)\nis(are) the candidate(s) with the highest total number of points (i.e., the candidate\nwith the greatest score, where the score is the total number of positive votes minus the total \nnumber of negative votes).\n \nNegative voting is tantamount to allowing the voters to support either\na single candidate or all but one candidate (taking a point away from\na candidate \\(C\\) is equivalent to giving one point to all candidates\nexcept \\(C\\)). That is, the voters are asked to choose a set of\ncandidates that they support, where the choice is between sets\nconsisting of a single candidate or sets consisting of all except one\ncandidate. The next voting method generalizes this idea by allowing\nvoters to choose any subset of candidates:  \nApproval Voting:\n\nEach voter selects a subset of the candidates (where the\nempty set means the voter abstains) and the candidate(s) with selected by \nthe most voters wins.   \n \nIf a candidate \\(X\\) is in the set of candidates selected by \na voter, we say that the voter approves of candidate \\(X\\).  Then, the approval winner is the \ncandidate with the most approvals. Approval voting has been extensively discussed by Steven Brams and Peter Fishburn (Brams and Fishburn 2007; Brams 2008). See, also, the\nrecent collection of articles devoted to approval voting (Laslier and\nSanver 2010).  \nApproval voting forces voters to think about the decision problem\ndifferently: They are asked to determine which candidates they\napprove of rather than selecting a single candidate to voter\nfor or determining the relative ranking of the candidates.\nThat is, the voters are asked which candidates are above a certain\n“threshold of acceptance”. Ranking a set of candidates and\nselecting the candidates that are approved are two different aspects\nof a voters overall opinion about the candidates. They are related but\ncannot be derived from each other. See Brams and Sanver 2009, for\nexamples of voting methods that ask voters to both select a set of\ncandidates that they approve and to (linearly) rank the\ncandidates.  \nApproval voting is a very flexible method. Recall the election\nscenario illustrating the \\(k\\)-Approval Voting methods:  \nIn this election scenario, \\(k\\)-Approval for \\(k=1,2,3\\) cannot\nguarantee that the Condorcet winner \\(A\\) is elected. The Approval\nballot \\((\\{A\\},\\{B\\}, \\{A, C\\})\\) does elect the Condorcet winner. In\nfact, Brams (2008, Chapter 2) proves that if there is a unique\nCondorcet winner, then that candidate may be elected under approval\nvoting (assuming that all voters vote sincerely: see Brams\n2008, Chapter 2, for a discussion). Note that approval voting may also\nelect other candidates (perhaps even the Condorcet loser). Whether\nthis flexibility of Approval Voting should be seen as a virtue or a\nvice is debated in Brams, Fishburn and Merrill 1988a, 1988b and Saari\nand van Newenhizen 1988a, 1988b.  \nApproval Voting asks voters to express something about their\nintensity of preference for the candidates by assigning one\nof two grades: \"Approve\" or \"Don’t Approve\". Expanding on this idea,\nsome voting methods assume that there is a fixed set of grades, or a\ngrading language, that voters can assign to each candidate.\nSee Chapters 7 and 8 from Balinksi and Laraki 2010 for examples and a\ndiscussion of grading languages (cf. Morreau 2016).  \nThere are different ways to determine the winner(s) given a profile of\nballots that assign grades to each candidate. The main approach is to\ncalculate a \"group\" grade for each candidate, then select the\ncandidate with the best overall group grade. In order to calculate a\ngroup grade for each candidate, it is convenient to use numbers for\nthe grading language. Then, there are two natural ways to determine\nthe group grade for a candidate: calculating the mean, or average, of\nthe grades or calculating the median of the grades. \nCumulative Voting:\n\nEach voter is asked to distribute a fixed number of points, say ten,\namong the candidates in any way they please. The candidate(s) with the\nmost total points wins the election.\n \nScore Voting (also called Range Voting):\n\nThe grades are a finite set of numbers. The ballots are an assignment\nof grades to the candidates. The candidate(s) with the largest average\ngrade is declared the winner(s).\n \nCumulative Voting and Score Voting are similar. The important\ndifference is that Cumulative Voting requires that the sum of the\ngrades assigned to the candidates by each voter is the same.  The next\nprocedure, proposed by Balinski and Laraki 2010 (cf. Bassett and\nPersky 1999 and \n the discussion of this method at rangevoting.org),\n selects the candidate(s) with the largest median grade rather\nthan the largest mean grade.  \nMajority Judgement:\n\nThe grades are a finite set of numbers (cf. discussion of common grading languages). \nThe ballots are an assignment of grades to the candidates. The candidate(s) \nwith the largest median grade is(are) declared the winner(s). See \nBalinski and Laraki 2007 and 2010 for further refinements of this voting method \nthat use different methods for breaking ties when there are multiple candidates \nwith the largest  median grade.\n \nI conclude this section with an example that illustrates Score Voting\nand Majority Judgement. Suppose that there are 3 candidates \\(\\{A, B,\nC\\}\\), 5 grades \\(\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\) (with the assumption that the larger\nthe number, the higher the grade), and 5 voters. The table below\ndescribes an election scenario. The candidates are listed in the first row.\n Each row describes an assignment of grades to a candidate by a set of voters.  \nThe bottom two rows give the mean and median grade for each\ncandidate. Candidate \\(A\\) is the score voting winner with the greatest\nmean grade, and candidate \\(B\\) is the majority judgement winner with\nthe greatest median grade. \n\n \nThere are two types of debates about the voting methods introduced in this section.   \nThe first concerns the choice of the grading language that voters use \nto evaluate the candidates.  Consult Balinski and Laraki 2010 amd Morreau 2016 for an extensive discussion of the types of considerations that  influence the choice of a grading language. Brams and Potthoff 2015 argue that two grades, as in Approval Voting,  is best to avoid certain paradoxical outcomes.   To illustrate, note that, in the above example, if the candidates are ranked by\nthe voters according to the grades that are assigned, then candidate\n\\(C\\) is the Condorcet winner (since 3 voters assign higher grades to\n\\(C\\) than to \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)).   However, neither Score Voting nor Majority Judgement selects candidate \\(C\\).  \n\n \n\nThe second type of debate concerns the method used to calculate  the group grade for each candidate (i.e., whether to use the mean as in Score Voting or the median as in Majority Judgement).   One important issue is whether voters have an incentive to misrepresent their evaluations of the candidates.    Consider the voter in  the middle column  that assigns the grade of 2 to  \\(A\\), 0 to \\(B\\), and 3 to \\(C\\).   Suppose that these grades represents the voter’s true evaluations of the candidates.  If  this  voter increases the grade for \\(C\\) to 4 and decreases the grade for \\(A\\) to  1 (and the other voters do not change their grades), then the average grade for \\(A\\) becomes 2.4 and the average grade for \\(C\\) becomes 2.6, which better reflects the voter’s true evaluations of the candidates (and results in \\(C\\) being elected according to Score Voting). Thus, this voter has an incentive to misrepresent her grades.   Note that the median grades for the candidates do not change after this voter changes her grades.   Indeed, Balinski and Laraki 2010, chapter 10, argue that using the median to assign group grades to candidates encourages voters to submit grades that reflect their true evaluations of the candidates. The key  idea of their argument is as follows: If a voter’s true grade matches  the median grade for a candidate, then the voter does not have an incentive to assign a different grade.  If a voter’s true grade is greater than the median grade for a candidate, then raising the grade will not change the candidate’s grade and lowering the voter’s grade may result in the candidate receiving a grade that is lowering than the voter’s true evaluation. Similarly, if a voter’s true grade is lower than the median grade for a candidate, then lowering the grade will not change the candidate’s grade and raising the voter’s grade may result in the candidate receiving a grade that is higher than the voter’s true evaluation.  Thus, if voters are focused on ensuring that the group grades for the candidates best reflects their true evaluations of the candidates, then voters do not have an incentive to misrepresent their grades. However, as pointed out in Felsenthal and Machover 2008 (Example 3.3), voters can manipulate the outcome of an election using Majority Judgement to ensure  a preferred candidate is elected  (cf. the discussion of strategic voting in Section 4.1 and Section 3.3 of List 2013).   Suppose that the voter in the middle column  assigns the grade of  4 to candidate \\(A\\), 0 to candidate \\(B\\) and 3 to candidate \\(C\\).  Assuming the other voters do not change their grades, the majority judgement winner is now  \\(A\\), which the voter ranks higher than the original majority judgement winner  \\(B.\\)   Consult Balinski and Laraki 2010, 2014 and Edelman 2012b  for  arguments in favor of electing candidates with the greatest median grade;  and Felsenthal and Machover 2008, Gehrlein and Lepelley 2003, and Laslier 2011 for arguments against electing candidates with the greatest median grade. \n  \n\n \nIn this section, I briefly discuss two new approaches to voting that\ndo not fit nicely into the categories of voting methods introduced in\nthe previous sections. While both of these methods can be used to\nselect representatives, such as a president, the primary application\nis a group of people voting directly on propositions, or referendums.\n \nQuadratic Voting: When more than 50% of the voters support an\nalternative, most voting methods will select that alternative. Indeed,\nwhen there are only two alternatives, such as when voting for or\nagainst a proposition, there are many arguments that identify majority\nrule as the best and most stable group decision method (May 1952;\nMaskin 1995). One well-known problem with always selecting the\nmajority winner is the so-called tyranny of the majority. A\ncomplete discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this article.\nThe main problem from the point of view of the analysis of voting\nmethods is that there may be situations in which a majority of the\nvoters weakly support a proposition while there is a sizable minority\nof voters that have a strong preference against the proposition.  \nOne way of dealing with this problem is to increase the quota required\nto accept a proposition. However, this gives too much power to a small\ngroup of voters. For instance, with Unanimity Rule a single voter can\nblock a proposal from being accepted. Arguably, a better solution is\nto use ballots that allow voters to express something about their\nintensity of preference for the alternatives. Setting aside issues\nabout interpersonal comparisons of utility (see, for instance, Hausman\n1995), this is the benefit of using the voting methods discussed in\nSection 2.2, such as Score Voting or Majority Judgement. These voting\nmethods assume that there is a fixed set of grades that the\nvoters use to express their intensity of preference. One challenge is\nfinding an appropriate set of grades for a population of voters. Too\nfew grades makes it harder for a sizable minority with strong\npreferences to override the majority opinion, but too many grades\nmakes it easy for a vocal minority to overrule the majority opinion.\n \nUsing ideas from mechanism design (Groves and Ledyard 1977; Hylland and\nZeckhauser 1980), the economist E. Glen Weyl developed a voting method\ncalled Quadratic Voting that mitigates some of the above issues\n(Lalley and Weyl 2018a). The idea is to think of an election as a\nmarket (Posner and Weyl, 2018, Chapter 2). Each voter can purchase\nvotes at a costs that is quadratic in the number of votes. For\ninstance, a voter must pay $25 for 5 votes (either in favor or against\na proposition). After the election, the money collected is distributed\non a pro rata basis to the voters. There are a variety of\neconomic arguments that justify why voters should pay \\(v^2\\) to\npurchase \\(v\\) votes (Lalley and Weyl 2018b; Goeree and Zhang 2017).\nSee Posner and Weyl 2015 and 2017 for further discussion and a\nvigorous defense of the use of Quadratic Voting in national elections. \nConsult Laurence and Sher 2017 for  two arguments against the use of Quadratic Voting.   \nBoth arguments are derived from the presence of wealth inequality.   The first \nargument is that it is ambiguous whether the Quadratic Voting decision really  outperforms a decision using majority rule from the perspective of utilitarianism \n(see Driver 2014 and Sinnott-Armstrong 2019 for overviews of utilitarianism).  \nThe second argument is that any vote-buying mechanism will have a hard \ntime meeting a legitimacy requirement, familiar from the theory of democratic \ninstitutions (cf. Fabienne 2017). \n\n\n \nLiquid Democracy: Using Quadratic Voting, the voters’ opinions\nmay end up being weighted differently: Voters that purchase more of a\nvoice have more influence over the election. There are other reasons\nwhy some voters’ opinions may have more weight than others when making\na decision about some issue. For instance, a voter may have been\nelected to represent a constituency, or a voter may be recognized as\nan expert on the issue under consideration. An alternative approach to\ngroup decision making is direct democracy in which every\ncitizen is asked to vote on every political issue. Asking the citizens\nto vote on every issue faces a number of challenges, \n nicely explained by Green-Armytage (2015, pg. 191): \nOne way  to deal with some of the problems raised in the above quote is to \nuse proxy voting, in which voters can delegate their vote \non some issues (Miller 1969). Liquid Democracy is a form of proxy voting \nin which voters can delegate their votes to other voters (ideally, to voters that are\nwell-informed about the issue under consideration). What distinguishes\nLiquid Democracy from proxy voting is that proxies may further\ndelegate the votes entrusted to them. For example, suppose that there\nis a vote to accept or reject a proposition. Each voter is given the\noption to delegate their vote to another voter, called a proxy. The\nproxies, in turn, are given the option to delegate their votes to yet\nanother voter. The voters that decide to not transfer their votes cast\na vote weighted by the number of voters who entrusted them as a proxy,\neither directly or indirectly.  \nWhile there has been some discussion of proxy voting in the political\nscience literature (Miller 1969; Alger 2006; Green-Armytage 2015),\nmost studies of Liquid Democracy can be found in the computer science\nliterature. A notable exception is Blum and Zuber 2016 that justifies\nLiquid Democracy, understood as a procedure for democratic\ndecision-making, within normative democratic theory. An overview of\nthe origins of Liquid Democracy and pointers to other online\ndiscussions can be found in Behrens 2017. Formal studies of Liquid\nDemocracy have focused on: the possibility of delegation cycles and\nthe relationship with the theory of judgement aggregation (Christoff\nand Grossi 2017); the rationality of delegating votes (Bloembergen,\nGrossi and Lackner 2018); the potential problems that arise when many\nvoters delegate votes to only a few voters (Kang et al. 2018; Golz et\nal. 2018); and generalizations of Liquid Democracy beyond binary\nchoices (Brill and Talmon 2018; Zhang and Zhou 2017).  \nThis section introduced different methods for making a group decision.\nOne striking fact about the voting methods discussed in this section\nis that they can identify different winners given the same collection\nof ballots. This raises an important question: How should we\ncompare the different voting methods? Can we argue that some\nvoting methods are better than others? There are a number of different\ncriteria that can be used to compare and contrast different voting\nmethods:  \nIn this section, I introduce and discuss a number of voting\nparadoxes — i.e., anomalies that highlight problems with\ndifferent voting methods. Consult Saari 1995 and Nurmi 1999 for\npenetrating analyses that explain the underlying mathematics behind\nthe different voting paradoxes.  \nA very common assumption is that a rational preference\nordering must be transitive (i.e., if \\(A\\) is preferred to\n\\(B\\), and \\(B\\) is preferred to \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) must be preferred\nto \\(C\\)). See the entry on preferences (Hansson and Grüne-Yanoff\n2009) for an extended discussion of the rationale behind this\nassumption. Indeed, if a voter’s preference ordering is not\ntransitive, for instance, allowing for cycles (e.g., an ordering of \\(A, B, C\\) with \n\\(A \\succ B \\succ C \\succ A\\), where \\(X\\succ Y\\) means \\(X\\) is strictly preferred to \\(Y\\)), then there is  no alternative that the voter can be said to actually support (for each\nalternative, there is another alternative that the voter strictly prefers). Many\nauthors argue that voters with cyclic preference orderings have\ninconsistent opinions about the candidates and should be\nignored by a voting method (in particular, Condorcet\nforcefully argued this point). A key observation of Condorcet (which\nhas become known as the Condorcet Paradox) is that the majority ordering\nmay have cycles (even when all the voters submit rankings of the alternatives).  \nCondorcet’s original example was more complicated, but the following\nsituation with three voters and three candidates illustrates the\nphenomenon: \nNote that we have:  \nThat is, there is a majority cycle \\(A>_M B >_M C >_M A\\). This\nmeans that there is no Condorcet winner. This simple, but fundamental\nobservation has been extensively studied (Gehrlein 2006; Schwartz\n2018).  \nThe Condorcet Paradox shows that there may not always be a Condorcet\nwinner in an election. However, one natural requirement for a voting\nmethod is that if there is a Condorcet winner, then that candidate\nshould be elected. Voting methods that satisfy this property are\ncalled Condorcet consistent. Many of the methods introduced\nabove are not Condorcet consistent. I already presented an example\nshowing that plurality rule is not Condorcet consistent (in fact,\nplurality rule may even elect the Condorcet loser).  \nThe example from Section 1 shows that Borda Count is not Condorcet\nconsistent. In fact, this is an instance of a general phenomenon that\nFishburn (1974) called Condorcet’s other paradox. Consider the\nfollowing voting situation with 81 voters and three candidates from\nCondorcet 1785.  \nThe majority ordering is \\(A >_M B >_M C\\), so \\(A\\) is the Condorcet\nwinner. Using the Borda rule, we have:  \nSo, candidate \\(B\\) is the Borda winner. Condorcet pointed out\nsomething more: The only way to elect candidate \\(A\\) using\nany scoring method is to assign more points to candidates\nranked second than to candidates ranked first. Recall that a scoring\nmethod for 3 candidates fixes weights \\(s_1\\ge s_2\\ge s_3\\), where\n\\(s_1\\) points are assigned to candidates ranked 1st, \\(s_2\\) points\nare assigned to candidates ranked 2nd, and \\(s_3\\) points are assigned\nto candidates ranked last. To simplify the calculation, assume that\ncandidates ranked last receive 0 points (i.e., \\(s_3=0\\)). Then, the\nscores assigned to candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are:  \nSo, in order for \\(Score(A) > Score(B)\\), we must have \\((s_1 \\times\n31 + s_2 \\times 39) > (s_1 \\times 39 + s_2 \\times 31)\\), which implies\nthat \\(s_2 > s_1\\). But, of course, it is counterintuitive to give\nmore points for being ranked second than for being ranked first. Peter\nFishburn generalized this example as follows:  \nTheorem (Fishburn 1974).\n\nFor all \\(m\\ge 3\\), there is some voting situation with a Condorcet\nwinner such that every  scoring rule will have at least\n\\(m-2\\) candidates with a greater score than the Condorcet winner.\n \nSo, no scoring rule is Condorcet consistent, but what about other\nmethods? A number of voting methods were devised specifically to\nguarantee that a Condorcet winner will be elected, if one\nexists. The examples below give a flavor of different types of\nCondorcet consistent methods. (See Brams and Fishburn, 2002, and\nFishburn, 1977, for more examples and a discussion of \nCondorcet consistent methods.)  \nCondorcet’s Rule:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. If there is a\nCondorcet winner, then that candidate wins the election. Otherwise,\nall candidates tie for the win.  \nBlack’s Procedure:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. If there is a\nCondorcet winner, then that candidate is the winner. Otherwise, use \nBorda Count to determine the winners. \n \nNanson’s Method:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. Calculate the Borda\nscore for each candidate. The candidates with a Borda score below the\naverage of the Borda scores are eliminated. The Borda scores of the\ncandidates are re-calculated and the process continues until there is\nonly one candidate remaining. (See Niou, 1987, for a discussion of\nthis voting method.)  \nCopeland’s Rule:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. A win-loss\nrecord for candidate \\(B\\) is calculated as follows: \nThe Copeland winner is the candidate that maximizes the win-loss\nrecord. \nSchwartz’s Set Method:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. The winners are the\nsmallest set of candidates that are not beaten in a one-on-one\nelection by any candidate outside the set (Schwartz 1986).  \nDodgson’s Method:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. For each candidate,\ndetermine the fewest number of pairwise swaps in the voters’ rankings \nneeded to make that candidate the Condorcet winner. The candidate(s) \nwith the fewest swaps is(are) declared the winner(s).  \nThe last method was proposed by Charles Dodgson (better known by the\npseudonym Lewis Carroll). Interestingly, this is an example of a\nprocedure in which it is computationally difficult to compute the\nwinner (that is, the problem of calculating the winner is\nNP-complete). See Bartholdi et al. 1989 for a discussion.\n \nThese voting methods (and the other Condorcet consistent methods)\nguarantee that a Condorcet winner, if one exists, will be elected.\nBut, should a Condorcet winner be elected? Many people argue\nthat there is something amiss with a voting method that does not\nalways elect a Condorcet winner (if one exists). The idea is that a\nCondorcet winner best reflects the overall group opinion and is\nstable in the sense that it will defeat any challenger in a one-on-one\ncontest using Majority Rule. The most persuasive argument that the\nCondorcet winner should not always be elected comes from the work of\nDonald Saari (1995, 2001). Consider again Condorcet’s example of 81\nvoters.  \nThis is another example that shows that Borda’s method need not elect\nthe Condorcet winner. The majority ordering is \nwhile the ranking given by the Borda score is  \nHowever, there is an argument that candidate \\(B\\) is the best choice\nfor this electorate. Saari’s central observation is to note that the\n81 voters can be divided into three groups: \nGroups 1 and 2 constitute majority cycles with the voters evenly\ndistributed among the three possible rankings. Such profiles are\ncalled Condorcet components.  These profiles form a\nperfect symmetry among the rankings. So, within each of these groups,\nit is natural to assume that the  voters’ opinions cancel each other out; therefore, the decision\nshould depend only on the voters in group 3. In group 3, candidate\n\\(B\\) is the clear winner.  \nBalinski and Laraki (2010, pgs. 74–83) have an interesting spin on\nSaari’s argument. Let \\(V\\) be a ranking voting method (i.e., a voting\nmethod that requires voters to rank the alternatives). Say that \\(V\\)\ncancels properly if for all profiles \\(\\bR\\), if \\(V\\)\nselects \\(A\\) as a winner in \\(\\bP\\), then \\(V\\) selects \\(A\\) as\na winner in any profile \\(\\bP+\\bC\\), where \\(\\bC\\) is a\nCondorcet component and \\(\\bP+\\bC\\) is the profile that\ncontains all the rankings from \\(\\bP\\) and \\(\\bC\\). Balinski\nand Laraki (2010, pg. 77) prove that there is no Condorcet consistent\nvoting method that cancels properly. (See the discussion of the\nmultiple districts paradox in Section 3.3 for a proof of a closely\nrelated result.)  \nA voting method is monotonic provided that receiving more\nsupport from the voters is always better for a candidate. There are\ndifferent ways to make this idea precise (see Fishburn, 1982, Sanver\nand Zwicker, 2012, and Felsenthal and Tideman, 2013). For instance,\nmoving up in the rankings should not adversely affect a\ncandidate’s chances to win an election. It is easy to see that\nPlurality Rule is monotonic in this sense: The more voters that rank a\ncandidate first, the better chance the candidate has to\nwin. Surprisingly, there are voting methods that do not satisfy this\nnatural property. The most well-known example is Plurality with\nRunoff. Consider the two scenarios below. Note that the only\ndifference between the them is the ranking of the fourth group of\nvoters. This group of two voters ranks \\(B\\) above \\(A\\) above \\(C\\)\nin scenario 1 and swaps \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) in scenario 2 (so, \\(A\\) is\nnow their top-ranked candidate; \\(B\\) is ranked second; and \\(C\\) is\nstill ranked third).\n \nIn scenario 1, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both have a plurality score\nof 6 while candidate \\(C\\) has a plurality score of 5.  So, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) move on to the runoff election.  Assuming the voters do not\nchange their rankings, the 5 voters that rank \\(C\\) transfer their\nsupport to candidate \\(A\\), giving her a total of 11 to win the runoff\nelection.  However, in scenario 2, even after moving up in the\nrankings of the fourth group (\\(A\\) is now ranked first by this\ngroup), candidate \\(A\\) does not win this election. In fact,\nby trying to give more support to the winner of the election in\nscenario 1, rather than solidifying \\(A\\)’s win, the last\ngroup’s least-preferred candidate ended up winning the election!\nThe problem arises because in scenario 2, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare swapped in the last group’s ranking.  This means that\n\\(A\\)’s plurality score increases by 2 and \\(B\\)’s\nplurality score decreases by 2. As a consequence, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) move\non to the runoff election rather than \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  Candidate\n\\(C\\) wins the runoff election with 9 voters that rank \\(C\\) above\n\\(A\\) compared to 8 voters that rank \\(A\\) above \\(C\\).\n \nThe above example is surprising since it shows that, when using\nPlurality with Runoff, it may not always be beneficial for a candidate\nto move up in some of the voter’s rankings. The other voting methods\nthat violate monotonicity include Coombs Rule, Hare Rule, Dodgson’s\nMethod and Nanson’s Method.  See Felsenthal and Nurmi 2017 for further \ndiscussion of voting methods that are not monotonic.  \nIn this section, I discuss two related paradoxes that involve changes\nto the population of voters.  \nNo-Show Paradox: One way that a candidate may receive\n“more support” is to have more voters show up to an\nelection that support them. Voting methods that do not satisfy this\nversion of monotonicity are said to be susceptible to the no-show\nparadox (Fishburn and Brams 1983). Suppose that there are 3\ncandidates and 11 voters with the following rankings: \n \nIn the first round, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are both ranked first\nby 4 voters while \\(B\\) is ranked first by only 3 voters. So, \\(A\\)\nand \\(C\\) move to the runoff round. In this round, the voters in the\nsecond column transfer their votes to candidate \\(C\\), so candidate\n\\(C\\) is the winner beating \\(A\\) 7-4. Suppose that 2 voters in the\nfirst group do not show up to the election:  \nIn this election, candidate \\(A\\) has the lowest plurality score in\nthe first round, so candidates \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) move to the runoff\nround. The first group’s votes are transferred to \\(B\\), so \\(B\\) is\nthe winner beating \\(C\\) 5-4. Since the 2 voters that did not show up\nto this election rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\), they prefer the outcome of\nthe second election in which they did not participate!  \nPlurality with Runoff is not the only voting method that is\nsusceptible to the no-show paradox. The Coombs Rule, Hare Rule and\nMajority Judgement (using the tie-breaking mechanism from Balinski and Laraki 2010)\nare all susceptible to the no-show paradox. It turns out that always\nelecting a Condorcet winner, if one exists, makes a voting method\nsusceptible to the above failure of monotonicity. \nTheorem (Moulin 1988).\n\nIf there are four or more candidates, then every Condorcet consistent\nvoting method is susceptible to the no-show paradox.\n \nSee Perez 2001, Campbell and Kelly 2002, Jimeno et al.\n2009, Duddy 2014, Brandt et al. 2017, 2019, and Nunez and Sanver 2017\nfor further discussions and generalizations of this result.  \nMultiple Districts Paradox: Suppose that a population is\ndivided into districts. If a candidate wins each of the districts, one\nwould expect that candidate to win the election over the entire\npopulation of voters (assuming that the two districts divide the set of voters \ninto disjoint sets). This is certainly true for Plurality Rule: If a\ncandidate is ranked first by  the most  voters in  each of\nthe districts, then that candidate will also be ranked first by a\nthe most voters over the entire population. Interestingly, this is\nnot true for all voting methods (Fishburn and Brams 1983). The example\nbelow illustrates the paradox for Coombs Rule.  \nCandidate \\(B\\) wins both districts:  \n\nDistrict 1: There are a total of 10 voters in this district.\nNone of the candidates are ranked first by 6 or more voters, so\ncandidate \\(A\\), who is ranked last by 4 voters (compared to 3 voters\nranking each of \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) last), is eliminated.\nIn the second round, candidate \\(B\\) wins the election since 6 voters rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\) and 4 voters rank \\(C\\) above \\(B\\). \n \nDistrict 2: There are a total of 5 voters in this district.\nCandidate \\(B\\) is ranked first by a strict majority of voters, so\n\\(B\\) wins the election.  \nCombining the two districts gives the following table: \nThere are 15 total voters in the combined districts. None of the\ncandidates are ranked first by 8 or more of the voters. Candidate\n\\(C\\) receives the most last-place votes, so is eliminated in the\nfirst round. In the second round, candidate \\(A\\) is beats candidate\n\\(B\\) by 1 vote (8 voters rank \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) and 7 voters rank\n\\(B\\) above \\(A\\)), and so is declared the winner. Thus, even though\n\\(B\\) wins both districts, candidate \\(A\\) wins the election when the\ndistricts are combined.  \nThe other voting methods that are susceptible to the\nmultiple-districts paradox include Plurality with Runoff, The Hare\nRule, and Majority Judgement. Note that these methods are also\nsusceptible to the no-show paradox. As is the case with the no-show\nparadox, every Condorcet consistent voting method is susceptible to\nthe multiple districts paradox (see Zwicker, 2016, Proposition 2.5). I\nsketch the proof of this from Zwicker 2016 (pg. 40) since it adds to\nthe discussion at the end of Section 3.1 about whether the Condorcet\nwinner should be elected.  \nSuppose that \\(V\\) is a voting method that always selects the\nCondorcet winner (if one exists) and that \\(V\\) is not susceptible to\nthe multiple-districts paradox. This means that if a candidate \\(X\\)\nis among the winners according to \\(V\\) in each of two districts, then\n\\(X\\) must be among the winners according to \\(V\\) in the combined\ndistricts. Consider the following two districts. \nNote that in district 2 candidate \\(B\\) is the Condorcet winner, so\nmust be the only winner according to \\(V\\). In district 1, there are\nno Condorcet winners. If candidate \\(B\\) is among the winners\naccording to \\(V\\), then, in order to not be susceptible to the\nmultiple districts paradox, \\(B\\) must be among the winners in the\ncombined districts. In fact, since \\(B\\) is the only winner in\ndistrict 2, \\(B\\) must be the only winner in the combined districts.\nHowever, in the combined districts, candidate \\(A\\) is the Condorcet\nwinner, so must be the (unique) winner according to \\(V\\). This is a\ncontradiction, so \\(B\\) cannot be among the winners according to \\(V\\)\nin district 1. A similar argument shows that neither \\(A\\) nor \\(C\\)\ncan be among the winners according to \\(V\\) in district 1 by swapping\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in the first case and \\(B\\) with \\(C\\) in the second\ncase in the rankings of the voters in district 2. Since \\(V\\) must\nassign at least one winner to every profile, this is a contradiction;\nand so, \\(V\\) is susceptible to the multiple districts paradox.  \nOne last comment about this paradox: It is an example of a more\ngeneral phenomenon known as Simpson’s Paradox (Malinas and Bigelow\n2009). See Saari (2001, Section 4.2) for a discussion of Simpson’s\nParadox in the context of voting theory.  \nThe paradox discussed in this section, first introduced by Brams,\nKilgour and Zwicker (1998), has a somewhat different structure from\nthe paradoxes discussed above. Voters are taking part in a\nreferendum, where they are asked their opinion directly about\nvarious propositions (cf. the discussion of Quadratic Voting and Liquid Democracy\n in Section 2.3). So, voters must select either “yes”\n(Y) or “no” (N) for each proposition. Suppose that there\nare 13 voters who cast the following votes for the three propositions (so\nvoters can cast one of eight possible votes):  \nWhen the votes are tallied for each proposition separately, the\noutcome is N for each proposition (N wins 7–6 for all three\npropositions). Putting this information together, this means that NNN\nis the outcome of this election. However, there is no support\nfor this outcome in this population of voters.  This raises an important \nquestion about what outcome reflects the group opinion: Viewing each proposition \nseparately, there is clear support for N on each proposition; however, \nthere is no support for the entire package of N for all propositions. \nBrams et al. (1998,  pg. 234) nicely summarise the issue as follows:  \nSee Scarsini 1998, Lacy  and Niou 2000, Xia et al. 2007, and Lang and Xia 2009 for further discussion of this paradox. \n \nA similar issue is raised by Anscombe’s paradox (Anscombe\n1976), in which:  \nThis phenomenon is illustrated by the following example with five\nvoters voting on three different issues (the voters either vote\n‘yes’ or ‘no’ on the different issues). \nHowever, a majority of the voters (voters 1, 2 and 3) do not\nsupport the majority outcome on a majority of the issues (note that\nvoter 1 does not support the majority outcome on issues 2 and 3; voter\n2 does not support the majority outcome on issues 1 and 3; and voter 3\ndoes not support the majority outcome on issues 1 and 2)!  \nThe issue is more interesting when the voters do not vote directly on\nthe issues, but on candidates that take positions on the different\nissues. Suppose there are two candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) who take the\nfollowing positions on the three issues:  \nCandidate \\(A\\) takes the majority position, agreeing with a majority\nof the voters on each issue, and candidate \\(B\\) takes the opposite,\nminority position. Under the natural assumption that voters will vote\nfor the candidate who agrees with their position on a majority of the\nissues, candidate \\(B\\) will win the election (each of the voters 1, 2\nand 3 agree with \\(B\\) on two of the three issues, so \\(B\\) wins the\nelection 3–2)! This version of the paradox is known as\nOstrogorski’s Paradox (Ostrogorski 1902). See Kelly 1989; Rae\nand Daudt 1976; Wagner 1983, 1984; and Saari 2001, Section 4.6, for\nanalyses of this paradox, and Pigozzi 2005 for the relationship with \n\tthe judgement aggregation literature (List 2013, Section 5). \nIn the discussion above, I have assumed that voters select ballots\nsincerely. That is, the voters are simply trying to\ncommunicate their opinions about the candidates under the constraints\nof the chosen voting method. However, in many contexts, it makes sense to \nassume that voters choose strategically. One need only look to recent\nU.S. elections to see concrete examples of strategic voting. The most\noften cited example is the 2000 U.S. election: Many voters who ranked\nthird-party candidate Ralph Nader first voted for their second choice\n(typically Al Gore). A detailed overview of the literature on\nstrategic voting is beyond the scope of this article (see Taylor 2005 and  \nSection 3.3 of List 2013 for   discussions and pointers to the relevant literature; also see\nPoundstone 2008 for an entertaining and informative discussion of the\noccurrence of this phenomenon in many actual elections). I will\nexplain the main issues, focusing on specific voting rules.  \nThere are two general types of manipulation that can be studied in the\ncontext of voting. The first is manipulation by a moderator or outside\nparty that has the authority to set the agenda or select the voting\nmethod that will be used. So, the outcome of an election is not\nmanipulated from within by unhappy voters, but, rather, it is\ncontrolled by an outside authority figure. To illustrate this\ntype of control, consider a population with three voters whose\nrankings of four candidates are given in the table below:  \nNote that everyone prefers candidate \\(B\\) over candidate \\(D\\).\nNonetheless, a moderator can ask the right questions so that candidate\n\\(D\\) ends up being elected. The moderator proceeds as follows: First,\nask the voters if they prefer candidate \\(A\\) or candidate \\(B\\).\nSince the voters prefer \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) by a margin of 2 to 1, the\nmoderator  declares that candidate \\(B\\) is no longer in the running.\nThe moderator then asks voters to choose between candidate \\(A\\) and\ncandidate \\(C\\). Candidate \\(C\\) wins this election 2–1, so\ncandidate \\(A\\) is removed. Finally, in the last round the chairman\nasks voters to choose between candidates \\(C\\) and  \\(D\\).\nCandidate \\(D\\) wins this election 2–1 and is declared the\nwinner.  \nA second type of manipulation focuses on how the voters themselves can\nmanipulate the outcome of an election by misrepresenting\ntheir preferences. Consider the following two election scenarios \nwith 7 voters and 3 candidates: \nThe only difference between the two election scenarios is that the third voter\nchanged the ranking of the bottom three candidates.  In election scenario 1, the third \nvoter has candidate \\(A\\) ranked first, then \\(C\\) ranked second, \\(B\\) ranked third \nand \\(D\\) ranked last.   In election scenario 2, this voter still has \\(A\\) ranked\nfirst, but ranks \\(B\\) second, \\(D\\) third and \\(C\\) last. In  election scenario 1, candidate \\(C\\) is the Borda Count winner (the Borda scores are \\(\\BS(A)=9, \\BS(B)=5, \\BS(C)=10\\), and \\(\\BS(D)=6\\)).   In the  election scenario 2, candidate \\(A\\) is \nthe Borda Count winner (the Borda scores are \\(\\BS(A)=9, \\BS(B)=6, \\BS(C)=8\\), and \\(\\BS(D)=7\\)).   \nAccording to her ranking in election scenario 1, this voter prefers the outcome in election scenario 2 (candidate \\(A\\), the Borda winner in election scenario 2, is ranked above candidate \\(C\\), the Borda winner in election scenario 1).    So, if we assume that\nelection scenario 1 represents the “true” preferences of the\nelectorate, it is in the interest of the third voter  to misrepresent\nher preferences as in election scenario 2.  This is an instance of a general result known as the\nGibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite\n1975): Under natural assumptions, there is no voting method that\nguarantees that voters will choose their ballots sincerely\n(for a precise statement of this theorem \nsee Theorem 3.1.2 from Taylor 2005 or Section 3.3 of List 2013).  \nMuch of the literature on voting theory (and, more generally, social\nchoice theory) is focused on so-called axiomatic characterization\nresults. The main goal is to characterize different voting\nmethods in terms of abstract principles of collective decision making.\nSee Pauly 2008 and Endriss 2011 for interesting discussions of\naxiomatic characterization results from a logician’s point-of-view.\n \nConsult  List  2013  and Gaertner 2006 for introductions to \nthe vast literature on axiomatic characterizations in social choice theory. \nIn this article, I focus on a few key axioms and results and how they \nrelate to the voting methods and paradoxes discussed above. I start with \nthree core principles.  Anonymity: The names of the voters do not matter: If two\nvoters swap their ballots, then the outcome of the election is\nunaffected. Neutrality: The names of the candidates, or alternatives, do not\nmatter: If two candidates are exchanged in every ballot, then the\noutcome of the election changes accordingly.  Universal Domain: There are no restrictions on the voter’s\nchoice of ballots. In other words, no profile of ballots can be\nignored by a voting method. One way to make this precise is to require\nthat voting methods are total functions on the set of all\nprofiles (recall that a profile is a sequence of ballots, one from\neach voter).  \nThese properties ensure that the outcome of an election depends only\non the voters’ ballots, with all the voters and candidates being treated equally.\nOther properties are intended to rule out some of the paradoxes and\nanomalies discussed above. In section 4.1, there is an example of a\nsituation in which a candidate is elected, even though all\nthe voters prefer a different candidate. The next principle rules out\nsuch situations:  \nUnanimity (also called the Pareto Principle): If candidate\n\\(A\\) is ranked above candidate \\(B\\) by all voters, then\ncandidate \\(B\\) should not win the election.  \nThese are natural properties to impose on any voting method. A\nsurprising consequence of these properties is that they rule out\nanother natural property that one may want to impose: Say that a\nvoting method is resolute if the method always selects one\nwinner (i.e., there are no ties). Suppose that  \\(V\\) is a voting\nmethod that requires voters to rank the candidates and that there are\nat least 3 candidates and enough voters to form a Condorcet\ncomponent (a profile generating a majority cycle with voters evenly\ndistributed among the different rankings).  First, consider the situation when \nthere are exactly 3 candidates (in this case, we do not need to assume Unanimity).   \nDivide the set of voters into \nthree groups of size \\(n\\) and consider the Condorcet component: \n \nBy  Universal Domain and resoluteness, \\(V\\) must select exactly one of \n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), or \\(C\\) as the winner.   Assume that \\(V\\) select \\(A\\) \nas the winner (the argument when \\(V\\) selects the other candidates is similar).  \nNow, consider the profile in which every  voter swaps candidate \\(A\\) \nand \\(B\\) in their rankings: \n \nBy Neutrality and Universal Domain, \\(V\\) must elect candidate \\(B\\) in this election scenario.  Now, consider the profile in which every voter in the above election scenario swaps candidates \\(B\\) and \\(C\\): \n \nBy Neutrality and Universal Domain, \\(V\\) must elect candidate \\(C\\)\nin this election scenario.  Notice that this last election scenario\ncan be generated by permuting the voters in the first election\nscenario (to generate the last election scenario from the first\nelection scenario, move the first group of voters to the 2nd position,\nthe 2nd group of voters to the 3rd position and the 3rd group of\nvoters to the first position).  But this contradicts Anonymity since\nthis requires \\(V\\) to elect the same candidate in the first and third\nelection scenario. To extend this result to more than 3 candidates,\nconsider a profile in which candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are all\nranked above any other candidate and the restriction to these three\ncandidates forms a Condorcet component.  If \\(V\\) satisfies Unanimity,\nthen no candidate except \\(A\\), \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) can be elected. Then,\nthe above argument shows that \\(V\\) cannot satisfy Resoluteness,\nUniversal Domain, Neutrality, and Anonymity.  That is, there are no\nResolute voting methods that satisfy Universal Domain, Anonymity,\nNeutrality, and Unanimity for 3 or more candidates (note that I have\nassumed that the number of voters is a multiple of 3, see Moulin 1983\nfor the full proof).\n \nSection 3.2 discussed examples in which candidates end up losing an\nelection as a result of more support from some of the voters. There\nare many ways to state properties that require a voting method to be\nmonotonic. The following strong version (called Positive\nResponsiveness in the literature) is used to characterize majority\nrule when there are only two candidates:  \nPositive Responsiveness: If candidate \\(A\\) is a winner or\ntied for the win and moves up in some of the voter’s rankings, then\ncandidate \\(A\\) is the unique winner.  \nI can now state our first characterization result. Note that in all of\nthe example discussed above, it is crucial that there are three or\nmore candidates (for example, stating Condorcet’s paradox requires there \nto be  three or more candidates). When there are only two\ncandidates, or alternatives, Majority Rule (choose the alternative ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters) can be singled out as “best”:  \nTheorem (May 1952).\n\n  A voting method for choosing between two candidates satisfies\nNeutrality, Anonymity, Unanimity and Positive Responsiveness if and only if the\nmethod is majority rule.\n \nSee May 1952 for a precise statement of this theorem and Asan and\nSanver 2002, Maskin 1995, and Woeginger 2003 for \nalternative characterizations of majority rule. \n \nA key  assumption in the proof May’s theorem and  subsequent  results is the \nrestriction to voting on  two  alternatives.  When there are only two \nalternatives, the definition of a ballot can be simplified since a \nranking of two alternatives boils down to selecting the alternative \nthat is ranked first.  The  above characterizations of Majority \nRule work in a more general setting since they  also allow  \nvoters to abstain  (which is ambiguous between not voting \nand being indifferent between the alternatives).  So, if the alternatives \nare  \\(\\{A,B\\}\\), then there are three possible ballots: selecting \\(A\\), \nselecting \\(B\\), or abstaining (which is treated as selecting both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)).  \nA natural question is whether there are May-style  characterization theorems \nfor more than two alternatives.    A crucial issue is  that  rankings of more than \ntwo alternatives are much more informative than selecting an alternative or abstaining.  By  restricting the information required \nfrom a  voter to selecting one of the alternatives or abstaining, \nGoodin and List 2006 prove that the  axioms used in May’s Theorem characterize \nPlurality  Rule when there are more than two alternatives.  They also show that a\n minor  modification of the axioms characterize Approval Voting when voters are allowed to \n select more than one alternative. \n \n Note that  focusing on voting methods that limit the information required from \n the voters  to selecting one or more of the alternatives  hides all the interesting \n phenomena discussed in the previous sections, such as the existence of a Condorcet paradox.  \nReturning to the study of voting methods  that require voters to rank the alternatives, \nthe most important characterization result is Ken Arrow’s celebrated impossibility \ntheorem (1963). Arrow showed that there is no social welfare function (a social\nwelfare function maps the voters’ rankings (possibly allowing ties) to\na single social ranking) satisfying universal domain, unanimity,\nnon-dictatorship (there is no voter \\(d\\) such that for all profiles,\nif \\(d\\) ranks \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) in the profile, then the social\nordering ranks \\(A\\) above \\(B\\)) and the following key property: \n \nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives: The social ranking\n(higher, lower, or indifferent) of two candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\ndepends only on the relative rankings of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for each\nvoter.  \nThis means that if the voters’ rankings of two candidates \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are the same in two different election scenarios, then the\nsocial rankings of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be the same. This is a very\nstrong property that has been extensively criticized (see Gaertner,\n2006, for pointers to the relevant literature, and Cato, 2014, for a\ndiscussion of generalizations of this property). It is beyond the\nscope of this article to go into detail about the proof and the\nramifications of Arrow’s theorem (see Morreau, 2014, for this\ndiscussion), but I note that many of the voting methods we have\ndiscussed do not satisfy the above property. A striking example of a\nvoting method that does not satisfy Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives is Borda Count. Consider the following two election\nscenarios: \nNotice that the relative rankings of candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)\nare the same in both election scenarios. In the election scenario 2, the\nranking  of candidate \\(X\\), that is uniformly ranked in last place in\n election scenario 1, is changed. The ranking according to the\nBorda score of the candidates in election scenario 1 puts \\(A\\) first with 15\npoints, \\(B\\) second with 14 points, \\(C\\) third with 13 points, and\n\\(X\\) last with 0 points. In election scenario 2, the ranking of \\(A\\), \\(B\\)\nand \\(C\\) is reversed: Candidate \\(C\\) is first with 13 voters;\ncandidate \\(B\\) is second with 12 points; candidate \\(A\\) is third\nwith 11 points; and candidate \\(X\\) is last with 6 points. So, even\nthough the relative rankings of candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) do\nnot differ in the two election scenarios, the position of candidate \\(X\\)\nin the voters’ rankings reverses the Borda rankings of these candidates.  \nIn Section 3.3, it was noted that a number of methods (including all\nCondorcet consistent methods) are susceptible to the multiple\ndistricts paradox. An example of a method that is not susceptible to\nthe multiple districts paradox is Plurality Rule: If a candidate\nreceives the most first place votes in two different districts, then\nthat candidate must receive the most first place votes in the combined\nthe districts. More generally, no scoring rule is susceptible to the\nmultiple districts paradox. This property is called reinforcement:\n \nReinforcement:\nSuppose that \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) are\ndisjoint sets of voters facing the same set of candidates. Further,\nsuppose that \\(W_1\\) is the set of winners for the population \\(N_1\\),\nand \\(W_2\\) is the set of winners for the population \\(N_2\\). If there\nis at least one candidate that wins both elections, then the winner(s)\nfor the entire population (including voters from both \\(N_1\\) and\n\\(N_2\\)) is the set of candidates that are in both \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\)\n(i.e., the winners for the entire population is \\(W_1\\cap W_2\\)). \nThe reinforcement property explicitly rules out the multiple-districts\nparadox (so, candidates that win all sub-elections are guaranteed to\nwin the full election). In order to characterize all scoring rules,\none additional technical property is needed:  \nContinuity: Suppose that a group of voters \\(N_1\\) elects a\ncandidate \\(A\\) and a disjoint group of voters \\(N_2\\) elects a\ndifferent candidate \\(B\\). Then there must be some number \\(m\\) such\nthat the population consisting of the subgroup \\(N_2\\) together with\n\\(m\\) copies of \\(N_1\\) will elect \\(A\\).\n We then have: \nTheorem (Young 1975).\n\nSuppose that \\(V\\) is a voting method that requires voters to rank the\ncandidates. Then, \\(V\\) satisfies Anonymity, Neutrality, Reinforcement\nand Continuity if and only if the method is a scoring rule.\n \nSee Merlin 2003 and Chebotarev and Smais 1998 for surveys of other\ncharacterizations of scoring rules. Additional axioms single out Borda\nCount among all scoring methods (Young 1974; Gardenfors 1973; Nitzan\nand Rubinstein 1981). In fact, Saari has argued that “any fault\nor paradox admitted by Borda’s method also must be admitted by all\nother positional voting methods” (Saari 1989, pg. 454). For\nexample, it is often remarked that Borda Count (and all scoring rules)\ncan be easily manipulated by the voters. Saari (1995, Section 5.3.1)\nshows that among all scores rules Borda Count is the least susceptible\nto manipulation (in the sense that it has the fewest profiles where a\nsmall percentage of voters can manipulate the outcome).  \nI have glossed over an important detail of Young’s characterization of\nscoring rules. Note that the reinforcement property refers to the\nbehavior of a voting method on different populations of voters. To\nmake this precise, the formal definition of a voting method must allow for \ndomains that include profiles (i.e., sequences of ballots) of different\nlengths. To do this, it is convenient to assume that the domain of a\nvoting method is an anonymized profile: Given a set of ballots\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), an anonymous profile is a function\n\\(\\pi:\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}\\). Let \\(\\Pi\\) be the set of\nall anonymous profiles. A variable domain voting method assigns\na non-empty set of voters to each anonymous profile—i.e., it is a function\n\\(V:\\Pi\\rightarrow \\wp(X)-\\emptyset\\)). Of course, this builds in the\nproperty of Anonymity into the definition of a voting method. For this\nreason, Young (1975) does not need to state Anonymity as a\ncharacterizing property of scoring rules.  \nYoung’s axioms identify scoring rules out of the set of all functions\ndefined from ballots that are rankings of candidates. In order to\ncharacterize the voting methods from Section 2.2, we need to change\nthe set of ballots. For example, in order to characterize Approval\nVoting, the set of ballots \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is the set of non-empty\nsubsets of the set of candidates—i.e.,\n\\(\\mathcal{B}=\\wp(X)-\\emptyset\\) (selecting the ballot \\(X\\)\nconsisting of all candidates means that the voter abstains).\nTwo additional axioms are needed to characterize Approval Voting: \nFaithfulness: If there is exactly one voter in the population,\nthen the winners are the set of voters chosen by that voter.  \nCancellation: If all candidates receive the same number of\nvotes (i.e., they are elements of the same number of ballots) from the\nparticipating voters, then all candidates are winning.  We then have: \nTheorem (Fishburn 1978b; Alos-Ferrer 2006 ).\n\nA variable domain voting method where the ballots are non-empty sets\nof candidates is Approval Voting if and only if it satisfies\nFaithfulness, Cancellation, and Reinforcement.\n \nNote that Approval Voting satisfies Neutrality even though it is not\nlisted as one of the characterizing properties in the above\ntheorem. This is because Alos-Ferrer (2006) showed that Neutrality is\na consequence of Faithfulness, Cancellation and Reinforcement. See\nFishburn 1978a and Baigent and Xu 1991 for alternative\ncharacterizations of Approval Voting, and Xu 2010 for a survey of the\ncharacterizations of Approval Voting (cf. the characterization of\nApproval Voting from Goodin and List 2006).  \nMyerson (1995) introduced a general framework for characterizing\nabstract scoring rules that include Borda Count and Approval\nVoting as examples. The key idea is to think of a ballot, called a\nsignal or a vote, as a function from candidates to a set\n\\(\\mathcal{V}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a set of numbers. That is,\nthe set of ballots is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{V}^X\\) (the set of functions\nfrom \\(X\\) to \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)). Then, an anonymous profile of signals\nassigns a score to each candidate \\(X\\) by summing the numbers\nassigned to \\(X\\) by each voter. This allows us to define voting methods \nby specifying the set of ballots:  \nMyerson (1995) showed that an abstract voting rule is an abstract\nscoring rule if and only if it satisfies Reinforcement, Universal\nDomain (i.e. it is defined for all anonymous profiles), a version of\nthe Neutrality property (adapted to the more abstract setting), and\nthe Continuity property, which is called Overwhelming Majority.\nPivato (2013) generalizes this result, and Gaertner and Xu (2012)\nprovide a related characterization result (using different\nproperties). Pivato (2014) characterizes Formal Utilitarian and Range\nVoting within the class of abstract scoring rules, and Mace (2018)\nextends this approach to cover a wider class of grading voting methods\n(including Majority Judgement).  \nThe voting methods discussed above have been judged on\nprocedural grounds. This “proceduralist approach to\ncollective decision making” is defined by Coleman and Ferejohn\n(1986, p. 7) as one that “identifies a set of ideals with which\nany collective decision-making procedure ought to comply. … [A]\nprocess of collective decision making would be more or less\njustifiable depending on the extent to which it satisfies them.”\nThe authors add that a distinguishing feature of proceduralism is that\n“what justifies a [collective] decision-making procedure is\nstrictly a necessary property of the procedure — one entailed by\nthe definition of the procedure alone.” Indeed, the\ncharacterization theorems discussed in the previous section can be\nviewed as an implementation of this idea (cf. Riker 1982). The general\nview is to analyze voting methods in terms of “fairness\ncriteria” that ensure that a given method is sensitive to\nall of the voters’ opinions in the right way.  \nHowever, one may not be interested only in whether a collective\ndecision was arrived at “in the right way,” but in whether\nor not the collective decision is correct. This\nepistemic approach to voting is nicely explained by Joshua\nCohen (1986, p. 34):  \nUnder this interpretation of voting, a given method is judged on how\nwell it “tracks the truth” of some objective fact (the\ntruth of which is independent of the method being used). A\ncomprehensive comparison of these two approaches to voting touches on\na number of issues surrounding the justification of democracy (cf.\nChristiano 2008); however, I will not focus on these broader issues\nhere. Instead, I briefly discuss an analysis of Majority Rule that\ntakes this epistemic approach.  \nThe most well-known analysis comes from the writings of Condorcet\n(1785). The following theorem, which is attributed to Condorcet and\nwas first proved formally by Laplace, shows that if there are only two\noptions, then majority rule is, in fact, the best procedure from an\nepistemic point of view. This is interesting because it also shows\nthat a proceduralist analysis and an epistemic analysis both single\nout Majority Rule as the “best” voting method when there\nare only two candidates.  \nAssume that there are \\(n\\) voters that have to decide between two\nalternatives. Exactly one of these alternatives is (objectively)\n“correct” or “better.” The typical example\nhere is a jury deciding whether or not a defendant is guilty. The two\nassumptions of the Condorcet jury theorem are:  Independence: The voters’ opinions are probabilistically\nindependent (so, the probability that two or more voters are correct\nis the product of the probability that each individual voter is\ncorrect).  Voter Competence: The probability that a voter makes the\ncorrect decision is greater than 1/2 (and this probability is the same\nfor all voters, though this is not crucial).  \nSee Dietrich 2008 for a critical discussion of these two assumptions.\nThe classic theorem is:  \nCondorcet Jury Theorem.\n\nSuppose that Independence and Voter Competence are both satisfied.\nThen, as the group size increases, the probability that the majority\nchooses the correct option increases and converges to certainty.\n \nSee Nitzan 2010 (part III) and Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013 for modern\nexpositions of this theorem, and Goodin and Spiekermann 2018 for\nimplications for the theory of democracy.  \nCondorcet envisioned that the above argument could be adapted to\nvoting situations with more than two alternatives. Young (1975, 1988, 1995) \nwas the first to fully work out this\nidea (cf. List and Goodin 2001 who generalize the Condorcet Jury  \nTheorem to more than two alternatives in a different framework). \nHe showed (among other things) that the Borda Count can be\nviewed as the maximum likelihood estimator for identifying\nthe best candidate. Conitzer and Sandholm (2005), Conitzer et\nal. (2009), Xia et al. (2010), and Xia (2016) take these ideas further\nby classifying different voting methods according to whether or not\nthe methods can be viewed as a maximum likelihood estimator\n(for a noise model). The most general results along these lines can be\nfound in Pivato 2013 which contains a series of results showing when\nvoting methods can be interpreted as different kinds of statistical\n‘estimators’.  \nOne of the most active and exciting areas of research that is focused,\nin part, on the study of voting methods and voting paradoxes is\ncomputational social choice. This is an interdisciplinary\nresearch area that uses ideas and techniques from theoretical computer\nscience and artificial intelligence to provide new perspectives and to\nask new questions about methods for making group decisions; and to use\nvoting methods in computational domains, such as recommendation\nsystems, information retrieval, and crowdsourcing. It is beyond the\nscope of this article to survey this entire research area. Readers are\nencouraged to consult the Handbook of Computational Social\nChoice (Brandt et al. 2016) for an overview of this field (cf.\nalso Endriss 2017). In the remainder of this section, I briefly\nhighlight some work from this research area related to issues\ndiscussed in this article.  \nSection 4.1 discussed election scenarios in which voters choose their\nballots strategically and briefly introduced the Gibbard-Satterthwaite\nTheorem. This theorem shows that every voting method satisfying\nnatural properties has profiles in which there is some voter, called a\nmanipulator, that can achieve a better outcome by selecting a\nballot that misrepresents her preferences. Importantly, in order to\nsuccessfully manipulate an election, the manipulator must not only\nknow which voting method is being used but also how the other members\nof society are voting. Although there is some debate about whether\nmanipulation in this sense is in fact a problem (Dowding and van Hees\n2008; Conitzer and Walsh, 2016, Section 6.2), there is interest in\nmechanisms that incentivize voters to report their\n“truthful” preferences. In a seminal paper, Bartholdi et\nal. (1989) argue that the complexity of computing which ballot will\nlead to a preferred outcome for the manipulator may provide a barrier\nto voting insincerely. See Faliszewski and Procaccia 2010, Faliszewski\net al. 2010, Walsh 2011, Brandt et al. 2013, and Conitzer and Walsh\n2016 for surveys of the literature on this and related questions, such\nas the the complexity of determining the winner given a voting method\nand the complexity of determining which voter or voters should be\nbribed to change their vote to achieve a given outcome.  \nOne of the most interesting lines of research in computational social\nchoice is to use techniques and ideas from AI and theoretical computer\nscience to design new voting methods. The main idea is to think of\nvoting methods as solutions to an optimization problem. Consider the\nspace of all rankings of the alternatives \\(X\\). Given a profile of\nrankings, the voting problem is to find an “optimal” group\nranking (cf. the discussion or distance-based\nrationalizations of voting methods from Elkind et al. 2015). What\ncounts as an “optimal” group ranking depends on\nassumptions about the type of the decision that the group is making.\nOne assumption is that the voters have real-valued utilities\nfor each candidate, but are only able to report rankings of the\nalternatives (it is assumed that the rankings represent the utility\nfunctions). The voting problem is to identify the candidates that\nmaximizes the (expected) social welfare (the average of the voters’\nutilities), given the  partial information about the voters’\nutilities—i.e., the profile of rankings of the candidates. See\nPivato 2015 for a discussion of this approach to voting and Boutilier\net al. 2015 for algorithms that solve different versions of this\nproblem. A second assumption is that there is an objectively correct\nranking of the alternatives and the voters’ rankings are noisy\nestimates of this ground truth. This way of thinking about the voting\nproblem was introduced by Condorcet and discussed in Section 4.3.\nProcaccia et al. (2016) import ideas from the theory of\nerror-correcting codes to develop an interesting new approach to\naggregate rankings viewed as noisy estimates of some ground truth.\n \nAs with any mathematical analysis of social phenomena, questions\nabound about the “real-life” implications of the\ntheoretical analysis of the voting methods given above. The main\nquestion is whether the voting paradoxes are simply features of the\nformal framework used to represent an election scenario or\nformalizations of real-life phenomena. This raises a number of subtle\nissues about the scope of mathematical modeling in the social\nsciences, many of which fall outside the scope of this article. I\nconclude with a brief discussion of two questions that shed some light\non how one should interpret the above analysis.  \nHow likely is a Condorcet Paradox or any of the other\nvoting paradoxes?  There are two ways to approach this question.\nThe first is to calculate the probability that a majority cycle will\noccur in an election scenario. There is a sizable literature devoted\nto analytically deriving the probability of a majority cycle occurring\nin election scenarios of varying sizes (see Gehrlein 2006, and\nRegenwetter et al. 2006, for overviews of this literature).\nThe calculations depend on assumptions about the distribution of\nrankings among the voters. One distribution that is\ntypically used is the so-called impartial culture, where each\nranking is possible and occurs with equal probability. For\nexample, if there are three candidates, and it is assumed that the\nvoters’ ballots are rankings of the candidates, then each possible ranking \ncan occur with probability 1/6. Under this assumption,\nthe probability of a majority cycle occurring has been calculated (see\nGehrlein 2006, for details). Riker (1982, p. 122) has a table of the\nrelevant calculations. Two observations about this data: First, as the\nnumber of candidates and voters increases, the probability of a\nmajority cycles increases to certainty. Second, for a fixed number of\ncandidates, the probability of a majority cycle still increases,\nthough not necessarily to certainty (the number of voters is the\nindependent variable here). For example, if there are five candidates\nand seven voters, then the probability of a majority cycle is 21.5\npercent. This probability increases to 25.1 percent as the number of\nvoters increases to infinity (keeping the number of candidates fixed)\nand to 100 percent as the number of candidates increases to infinity\n(keeping the number of voters fixed). Prima facie, this result\nsuggests that we should expect to see instances of the Condorcet and\nrelated paradoxes in large elections. Of course, this interpretation\ntakes it for granted that the impartial culture is a realistic\nassumption. Many authors have noted that the impartial culture is a\nsignificant idealization that almost certainly does not occur in\nreal-life elections. Tsetlin et al. (2003) go even further arguing\nthat the impartial culture is a worst-case scenario in the sense that\nany deviation results in lower probabilities of a majority\ncycle (see Regenwetter et al. 2006, for a complete discussion\nof this issue, and List and Goodin  2001, Appendix 3,  for a related result).  \nA second way to argue that the above theoretical observations are\nrobust is to find supporting empirical evidence. For instance, is\nthere evidence that majority cycles have occurred in actual elections?\nWhile Riker (1982) offers a number of intriguing examples, the most\ncomprehensive analysis of the empirical evidence for majority cycles\nis provided by Mackie (2003, especially Chapters 14 and 15). The\nconclusion is that, in striking contrast to the probabilistic analysis\nreferenced above, majority cycles typically have not occurred in\nactual elections. However, this literature has not reached a consensus\nabout this issue (cf. Riker 1982): The problem is that the available\ndata typically does not include voters’ opinions about all\npairwise comparison of candidates, which is needed to determine if\nthere is a majority cycle. So, this information must be\ninferred (for example, by using statistical methods) from the\ngiven data.  \nA related line of research focuses on  the  influence of  factors, \nsuch as polls (Reijngoud and Endriss 2012), \nsocial networks (Santoro and Beck 2017, Stirling 2016) and deliberation \namong the voters (List 2018), on the profiles of ballots that are actually \nrealized  in an election.  For instance, List et al. 2013 has evidence \nsuggesting that deliberation reduces the probability of a Condorcet cycle occurring. \n \nHow do the different voting methods compare in actual elections?\n In this article, I have analyzed voting methods under highly\nidealized assumptions. But, in the end, we are interested in a very\npractical question: Which method should a group adopt? Of\ncourse, any answer to this question will depend on many factors that\ngo beyond the abstract analysis given above  (cf. Edelman 2012a). An interesting line of\nresearch focuses on incorporating empirical evidence into the\ngeneral theory of voting. Evidence can come in the form of a computer\nsimulation, a detailed analysis of a particular voting method in\nreal-life elections (for example, see Brams 2008, Chapter 1, which\nanalyzes Approval voting in practice), or as in situ\nexperiments in which voters are asked to fill in additional ballots\nduring an actual election (Laslier 2010, 2011).  \nThe most striking results  can be found in the work of\nMichael Regenwetter and his colleagues. They have analyzed datasets\nfrom a variety of elections, showing that many of the usual voting\nmethods that are considered irreconcilable (e.g., Plurality Rule, Borda\nCount and the  Condorcet consistent methods from Section 3.1.1) are, in fact, in\nperfect agreement. This suggests that the “theoretical\nliterature may promote overly pessimistic views about the likelihood\nof consensus among consensus methods” (Regenwetter et\nal. 2009, p. 840). See Regenwetter et al. 2006 for an\nintroduction to the methods used in these analyses and Regenwetter\net al. 2009 for the current state-of-the-art. \n \nMy objective in this article has been to introduce different voting methods\nand to highlight key results and issues that facilitate comparisons\nbetween the voting methods. To dive more into the details of the\ntopics introduced in this article, see Saari 2001, 2008, Nurmi 1998,\nBrams and Fishburn 2002, Zwicker 2012, and the collection of articles\nin Felsenthal and Machover 2012.
