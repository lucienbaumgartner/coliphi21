He received\nhis Bachelor of Arts from the University of Prague in 1379, but spent\nthe greatest part of his academic life in Oxford, where he was fellow\nat Queen’s College from 1391 to 1403, and where he became a Master of\nArts and a Doctor of Theology. In 1415 he was lector\nordinarius in Lüneburg (Saxony) (see Conti 1990, p. xvii).\nThe date of his death is unknown. \nHe established a reputation as a philosopher and a theologian. The\nnumber of extant manuscripts of his works and their widespread\ndistribution attest to his importance and notoriety throughout the\n15th century. The following writings are attributed to\nhim: \nRealism and nominalism were the two major theoretical alternatives in\nthe later Middle Ages concerning the reality and kinds of general\nobjects, and the status and mutual relationships of the basic items of\nthe world (individual and universal substances, individual and\nuniversal accidents) as well as their connection to language. Realists\nbelieved in the extra-mental existence of common natures (or\nessences); nominalists did not. Realists held that Aristotle’s table\nof categories was first of all a partition of things grounded on\nontological criteria and only secondarily a classification of (mental,\nwritten, and spoken) terms, and therefore that the world is divided\ninto ten kinds of things (in a broad sense of ‘thing’), not one of\nwhich can be reduced to any other. Nominalists maintained that the\ndivision into ten categories was a partition of terms on the basis of\nsemantic criteria, and that there are only two or three real\ncategories (substance and quality, and perhaps quantity too). Realists\nbelieved that thought was linguistically constrained by its own\nnature, and accordingly they considered thought to be related to\nreality in its elements and constitution, and deemed language,\nthought, and external reality to be of the same logical coherence.\nNominalists sharply distinguished between things as they exist in the\nexternal world and the various forms by means of which we think-of and\ntalk-about them, since for them our (mental, spoken, and written)\nlanguage does not reproduce the world, but merely regards it, as our\n(mental, spoken, and written) language and the world are logically\nindependent systems. \nIn the third decade of the fourteenth century, Ockham argued that the\ncommon realist account of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals was inconsistent with the standard definition of real\nidentity, according to which two items a and b are identical if and\nonly if for all x, x is predicated of a if\nand only x is predicated of b. If universals are\nsomething existing in the world, really identical with their\nindividuals considered as instances of a given type (e.g., the\nuniversal man qua man is identical with Socrates), but\ndifferent considered as properly universals and individuals (e.g., man\nqua universal is different from Socrates considered qua\nindividual), then whatever is predicated of the individuals must be\npredicated of their universals too, and so a unique general object\n(say, the human nature) would possess contrary attributes\nsimultaneously via the attributes of different individuals.\nFurthermore, a same thing would be in different places at the same\ntime, since, for example, the universal-man (homo universalis)\nwould be present at the same time in this man here (in Rome) and in\nthat man there (in Oxford) (cf. Ockham, Expositio in librum\nPraedicamentorum Aristotelis, cap. 8.1, in Opera\nphilosophica, vol. 2, p. 166; and Summa logicae, p. I,\ncap. 15, in Opera philosophica, vol. 1, p. 51). \nLater medieval Realists were persuaded that Ockham’s criticism was\nsufficient to show that the traditional realist account of the\nrelation between universals and particulars was unacceptable, but not\nthat realism as a whole was untenable. Thus, they tried to remove the\nunclear and aporetic points stressed by Ockham by two fundamental\nstrategies: (1) the real distinction between universals and\nindividuals; (2) new notions of identity and distinction. The first\nstrategy is that of Walter Burley, who in his later years (after 1324)\nmany times claimed that universals fully exist outside the mind and\nare really distinct from the individuals in which they are present and\nof which they are predicated, so moving toward a sort of Platonism.\nThe second strategy was that most commonly developed in the later\nMiddle Ages all over the Europe. There were two main lines of this\nstrategy. The first was that of some Italian Dominican masters, such\nas Francis of Prato and Stephen of Rieti in the 1340s, who worked out\nnew definitions for identity and distinction that were inspired by\nHervaeus Natalis’s notion of conformity (see Amerini 2005). The second\napproach was that of the most important school of later medieval\nrealists: the so-called “Oxford Realists,” started by John Wyclif.\nBesides Wyclif himself, this school includes the Englishmen Robert\nAlyngton, William Milverley, William Penbygull, Roger Whelpdale, and\nJohn Tarteys, as Johannes Sharpe (or Scharpe) and Paul of Venice.\nAccording to the Oxford Realists, universals and individuals are\nreally identical but formally distinct. In addition, they claimed that\n(1) the two notions of formal difference and real identity are\nlogically compatible; (2) predication is a real relation between\nthings; and (3) the ten Aristotelian categories are ten really\ndistinct kinds of things (res in the strict sense of the term). \nThe basic idea of the standard medieval realist theories of meaning\nwas that semantic classifications derive from ontological differences\namong the signified objects. So, according to this approach, the\nsimple expressions of our language (i.e., names) are distinct from the\ncomplex expressions (i.e., sentences) by virtue of their own\nsignificata, that is by virtue of the different kinds of\nobjects they make known. In fact, the objects signified by complex\nexpressions are compounds of (at least) two of the objects signified\nby simple expressions and a relation of identity (or non-identity, in\nthe case of a true negative sentence), while a simple object is an\nitem in a category (i.e., either a singular substance, or a\nsubstantial form, or an accidental form). Furthermore, every simple\nexpression of our language is like a label naming just one\nobject in the world, but whereas proper names and singular expressions\nlabel individuals (i.e., token-objects), general terms label common\nnatures (i.e., type-objects), which are the main metaphysical\nconstituents of the set of individuals instantiating them. For\ninstance, the general expression ‘man’ labels and can\nstand for each and every man only because of its primarily signifying\nthe universal form of humanity qua being present in each and\nevery man as the main constitutive principle of his essence. \nSharpe rejects the standard realist criteria for the generality (or\nuniversality, according to his terminology) of terms, and\nsubstantially accepts the sense of nominalist criticisms. In his\nopinion, to be matched by a common nature really existing in the world\nis no longer the necessary and sufficient condition for being a\ngeneral term. Rather, signifying universally (that is, signifying a\nunitary concept that in turn refers to a multiplicity of things\ndisplaying at least a similar mode of being [QsU, pp.\n129–30]) is a condition for semantic universality of equal importance.\nHe thinks that those terms which signify universally have to be viewed\nas common, as well as those signifying a common nature existing\noutside the intellect (ibid., p. 69). Thus, according to\nSharpe, there are six different kinds of general expressions, both\nspoken and written: \nAs is evident, Sharpe’s analysis of the types of universality for\nlinguistic terms is based on two distinct but compatible criteria: (i)\nthe existence of a common nature directly or indirectly signified by\nthem, and (ii) the universal mode of signifying – the latter\nbeing more important than the former. Thus, based on the satisfaction\nof these two criteria, Sharpe himself reduces the preceding division\nof the kinds of universality to a threefold partition: (i) terms that\nsignify in a universal mode a common nature existing in re\nand which are thus properly common, such as\n‘homo’; (ii) terms that signify in a universal\nmode but do not refer to any common nature in re and which\nare thus common in a less proper way, such as\n‘chimaera’ and ‘persona’;\nfinally, (iii) terms that do not signify in a universal mode and which\nare thus common in an improper way whenever they refer to a common\nnature existing in re , such as ‘hoc’\nand other demonstrative pronouns (QsU, p. 71). \nIn turn, mental concepts are common in four ways only, corresponding\nto the first four ways of universality peculiar to spoken (and\nwritten) terms, since there are no universal concepts that correspond\nto demonstrative pronouns or equivocal terms as such\n(ibidem). \nThe fourth kind of general term deserves particular attention, since\nit is connected with Sharpe’s solution to the question of the semantic\nand ontological status of terms of second intention like\n‘individual’ or ‘singular. This was a highly\ncontroversial question in Oxford at the end of the 14th\ncentury. The most common explanation was that proposed by Robert\nAlyngton, a fellow of Queen’s College in the 1380s. According to\nAlyngton, terms like ‘individual’ have to be considered\nsingular expressions; more precisely they are “range-narrowed”\nexpressions, like ‘this man’, because they identify a\nsingular referent as a member of a given set of individuals. In fact,\na term like ‘individual’ presupposes a general concept\n(that of being), the range of which is narrowed to a unique object\namong beings by an act of our intellect – to one object that is\nnot common. Sharpe, however, argues that Alyngton’s answer goes\nagainst linguistic usage as well as an established fact: if Alyngton\nwere right, then the following argument (which everybody will admit)\nwould be formally incorrect: \njust like this one: \nsince the syntagm ‘an individual man’ (‘homo\nsingularis’) would be a singular term standing precisely\nfor one individual, e.g., ‘Socrates’\n(‘Sortes’). Furthermore, it is a fact that anyone\ncan understand the sentence ‘an individual man runs’ even\nwithout knowing the identity of the man who is running – which\nis required according to Alyngton’s theory. Therefore, Sharpe regarded\nsecond intentions of this kind as common ones (ibid., pp.\n132–33). \nIn this way, Sharpe admits that the nominalist explanation of the\nuniversality of signs holds in the particular context of second\nintentions, implicitly rejecting Alyngton’s reduction of epistemology\nto ontology, since according to Sharpe’s account the former has its\nown range and rules partially independent of the latter. Furthermore,\nhe restores the semantic rank that intuitively would be assigned to\nthe ‘individual’-like terms (something Alyngton was unable\nto do). On the other hand, his defence of realism on the problem of\nuniversals is partially invalidated by his qualified acceptance of the\nnominalist principle of the autonomy of thought in relation to the\nworld. In fact, it is evident that from a semantic and/or\nepistemological point of view, he can no longer justify the\nextra-mental reality of universals. \nLike Burley, Sharpe’s semantics lists a third kind of expression\nbetween simple and complex expressions: concrete accidental terms\n(like ‘white’ or ‘father’), whose\nsignificata are neither simple nor complex objects but\nsomething in between. He affirms that concrete accidental terms do not\nsignify simple objects but aggregates composed of a substance and an\naccidental form. Such aggregates are lacking in numerical unity, and\nhence do not fall into any of the ten categories, because they are not\nproperly beings (entia). For that reason concrete accidental\nterms, although simple expressions from a merely grammatical point of\nview, are not names. The two metaphysical components of such\naggregates (i.e., substance and accidental form) are related to the\nconcrete accidental term as follows: although the concrete accidental\nterm connotes the accidental form, this is not its direct\nsignificatum, so that the concrete accidental term can\nsupposit for the substance only. In other words, the concrete\naccidental terms label substances by means of the accidental forms\nfrom which they draw their names, so that they name substances only\nqua bearers (subiecta) of a form. This fact accounts\nfor the difference between general names in the category of substance\n(like ‘man’) and concrete accidental terms. General names\nin the category of substance are concrete terms as well, but the form\nthey primarily signify is really identical with the substances they\nlabel. Therefore, in this case, the name itself of the form can be\nused as a name of the substance. This obviously implies a slight\ndifference in meaning between abstract and concrete substantial terms,\nsuch as ‘humanity’ (‘humanitas’) and\n‘man’ (‘homo’). While\n‘humanity’ is not the name of the form considered in its\ntotality, but rather the name only of the essential principle of the\nform, that is, of the intensional content carried by the term\n‘man’, this latter term signifies the substantial form\nconsidered as a constitutive element of the reality (esse) of\na certain set of individual substances that instantiate it. As a\nconsequence, according to Sharpe, ‘man is humanity’\n(‘homo est humanitas’) is a well formed and true\nsentence, since both subject and predicate signify the same entity,\nbut ‘white is whiteness’ (‘album est\nalbedo’) is not, since ‘white’ does not\ndirectly signify the accidental form, but only the substrate in which\nit inheres, as bearer of that form, and therefore ‘white’\ncannot stand for such a form in any sentence (ibid., pp.\n71–73). \nThe core of Sharpe’s metaphysics lies in his theory of universals. He\nis a realist, since he defends the extra-mental existence of\nuniversals (ibid., p. 68), but he is open to nominalism, as\nhe thinks that there is not a close correspondence between the\nelements and structures of language and elements and structures of the\nworld. His approach to the whole matter can be defined as\n“analytical,” since he seems to believe that (i) any ontology has to\nbe built up in relation to the resolution of semantic problems, (ii)\nany philosophical explanation of reality has to be preceded by a\nsemantic explanation of the function of our language. \nSharpe wrote the most interesting treatise on universals of the late\nMiddle Ages other than those of Wyclif and Paul of Venice, arguing\nabout logic and metaphysics, explaining his positions on being and\nessence, universals, singulars, predication, identity and distinction,\nand truth and falsity. His tract is very similar to that of Paul of\nVenice with regard to many metaphysical theses supported, the\nstructure of the work, the textual material utilized, and the opinions\ndiscussed. In his Quaestio super universalia Sharpe lists\neight opinions on universals (Buridan, Ockham, Auriol, Albert the\nGreat and Giles of Rome, Plato, Duns Scotus, Burley, and Wyclif) and\nso does Paul of Venice in his Quaestio de universalibus\n(Ockham, Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, Auriol, Burley, Wyclif,\nPlato, and two other unidentified realist authors). Yet, there are\nsome noteworthy doctrinal differences between them and the other\nOxford realists, which testify to Sharpe’s (and Paul of Venice’s)\nindependence of thought. \nThe starting point of Sharpe’s theory of universals and predication\n(as well as identity and distinction) is the theory worked out by\nWyclif and some of his Oxford successors, such as Alyngton and\nPenbygull. Like Duns Scotus and Walter Burley, Wyclif held that\nuniversals in re (or formal universals) exist outside our\nminds in actu and not in potentia, as moderate\nrealists thought. On the other hand, unlike Burley, he maintained that\nthey are really identical with their own individuals, thus accepting\nthe very core of the traditional realist account of the relationship\nbetween universals and individuals. According to Wyclif, since (1)\nuniversals and individuals share the same empirical reality, which is\nthat of individuals, but (2) have opposite constituent principles,\nwhen properly considered as universals and individuals, they are\nreally the same but formally distinct. On his view, because of this\nformal distinction, not everything predicable of individuals can be\ndirectly predicated of universals and vice versa, although an\nindirect predication is always possible. As a consequence, Wyclif\ndistinguished three main non-mutually exclusive types of predication\n(which he conceives as a real relation holding between metaphysical\nentities), each more general than the preceding one (or ones). In the\nTractatus de universalibus they are the following: formal\npredication, predication by essence, and habitudinal predication (see\nthe entry on Wyclif, §2.3). Since habitudinal predication does\nnot require any kind of identity between the entity signified by the\nsubject-term and the entity signified by the predicate-term, but\nformal predication and essential predication do, the ontological\npresuppositions of the most general type of predication, implied by\nthe other types, are completely different from those of the other\ntwo. \nThe final result of this way of approaching the problem of universals\nwas a system of intensional logic where (1) the copula of (almost) any\nstandard (philosophical) proposition, such as ‘Socrates is\nwhite’ or ‘man is an animal’, has to be interpreted\nin terms of degrees of identity between the things signified by the\nsubject-term and the predicate-term; and (2) individuals and\nuniversals, considered qua beings, appear to be a sort of\nhypostatization of intensions, since they are what is signified by\nproper and common nouns respectively. \nSharpe shares the metaphysical view and principles of Wyclif’s\nphilosophical system. His position on the problem of universals can be\nsummed up as follows. \nAs the being of real universals coincides with the being of their\ncorresponding individuals, real universals can be said to be\neverlasting because of the continuous succession of their individuals,\nand also really identical with them. But universals and individuals\nare also formally different from each other, as they have distinct\nconstitutive formal principles, and therefore different properties\n(ibid., pp. 91–92). The most important among universal signs\nare mental universals, which are both the acts of intellection through\nwhich our mind grasps the nature of universal forms and the concepts\nthrough which it connects general names with the things to which they\nrefer (ibid., pp. 68–69). \nThe description of the relationship between universals and individuals\nin terms of real identity and formal distinction entails (i) that not\nall that is predicated of individuals can be directly\n(formaliter) attributed to their universals and vice\nversa, but (ii) that all that is predicated of individuals has to\nbe in some way or another attributed to universals and vice\nversa. Therefore, a redefinition of the standard kinds of\npredication was required. \nLike Alyngton, Penbygull, Tarteys, and Whelpdale, Sharpe modifies\nWyclif’s theory. Agreeing with Alyngton, but against the others, he\ndivides real predication into formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis) and predication by essence (praedicatio essentialis\nvel secundum essentiam), removing habitudinal predication, as it\nis not homogeneous with the first two. According to him, predication\nby essence (1) shows a partial identity between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing, which share some metaphysical component parts,\nand (2.1) does not require (or even (2.2) excludes) that the form\nconnoted by the predicate-term is directly present in the essence\nsignified by the subject-term. ‘(What is) singular is (what is)\nuniversal’ (‘singulare est universale’) is\nan instance of predication by essence. Formal predication, on the\ncontrary, requires such a direct presence. ‘Man is an\nanimal’ and ‘man is white’ are instances of formal\npredication (ibid., pp. 89–91). \nAs is evident from his formulations, Sharpe does not explicitly divide\nformal predication into formal essential and formal accidental\npredication, and offers two different readings of the distinction\nbetween formal predication and predication by essence. According to\nthe common view, predication by essence is more general than formal\npredication. As a consequence, in the standard theory of the Oxford\nrealists, formal predication is a sub-type of predication by essence.\nSharpe introduces another interpretation, according to which the two\nkinds of predication at issue are complementary and mutually\nexclusive. This happens when predication by essence excludes the the\nform connoted by the predicate-term being directly present in the\nessence signified by the subject-term (ibid., p. 91).\nAlthough, according to the latter reading, formal predication is not a\nkind of predication by essence, this reading nevertheless implies an\ninterpretation of the ‘is’ of predication in terms of\nidentity and, therefore, a new definition of the pair of antonymous\nnotions of identity and difference (or distinction). \nSharpe’s theory of identity and distinction combines in an original\nway those of Duns Scotus, Wyclif, and Penbygull. \nPenbygull (De universalibus, pp. 189–90) had (1)\ndistinguished between the notion of non-identity and that of\ndifference (or distinction); (2) denied that the notion of difference\nimplies that of non-identity; (3) affirmed that the two notions of\ndifference and real identity are logically compatible, thus admitting\nthat (3.1) there are degrees in distinction, and (3.2) that the\ndegrees of distinction between two things can be read as the inverse\nmeasure of their (partial) identity; and (4) suggested the following\ndefinitions for these three notions, that is non-identity, difference\n(or distinction), and (absolute) identity: (4.1) an entity a\nis non-identical with an entity b if and only if there is not\nany form F such that F is present in the same way\nin a and\nb; (4.2) an entity a differs from an entity\nb if and only if there is at least a form F such\nthat F is directly present in a but not in b,\nor vice versa; (4.3) an entity a is absolutely\nidentical with an entity b if and only if for any\nform F, it is the case that F is present in a\nif and only if it is present in the same way in b (see the\nentry on William Penbygull, §3). \nLike Penbygull, Sharpe considers identity and distinction (or\ndifference) as the two possible inverse measures of the coincidence of\nthe metaphysical components of two given entities (QsU., p.\n92). Moreover, he speaks of formal and real (or essential) identity,\nand formal and real (or essential) distinction (or difference), and\nstates that formal identity is stronger than real (or essential)\nidentity, since the former entails the latter, while, on the contrary,\nreal difference is stronger than formal distinction, since the latter\nis entailed by the former (ibid., pp. 91–92). \nFinally, he admits degrees in formal distinction, as he recognizes two\ndifferent types, the first of which comes very close to that proposed\nby Scotus in his Ordinatio, while the second is drawn from\nWyclif’s Tractatus de universalibus (ch. 4, pp. 90–92). The\nfirst type of formal distinction holds among things such as the\nintellective faculties of the soul, whereas the second holds between\nsuch things as the essence of the soul and its intellective faculties\nand a species and its individuals (Quaestio super libros De\nanima, q. 2, fol. 236r-v). \nThe two different sets of conditions for the formal distinction can be\nformalized as follows: \nAccordingly, real identity, which is presupposed by the formal\ndistinction, has to be defined in these terms (QsU, p.\n98): \nAs a result, Sharpe’s world consists of finite beings (that is,\n“things” like men, horses, stones etc.), really existing\noutside the mind, made up of an individual substance and a host of\nformal entities (common substantial natures and accidental forms, both\nuniversal and singular) existing in it and through it, since none of\nthese formal entities can exist by themselves. They are real only\ninsofar as they constitute individual substances or are present in\nindividual substances qua their properties. Specific\nsubstantial natures (or essences) can be conceived from two points of\nview: intensionally (in abstracto) and extensionally (in\nconcreto). Viewed intensionally, specific substantial natures are\nnothing but the set of essential properties that individual substances\nare to instantiate, but considered without any reference to such\ninstantiations. Viewed extensionally, specific substantial natures are\nthose same forms conceived of as instantiated by at least one singular\nsubstance. For instance, human nature considered intensionally is\nhumanity (humanitas), extensionally the universal-man\n(homo in communi). Humanity is properly a form, or more\naccurately, the essential principle of a substantial form, that is,\nsomething existentially incomplete and dependent; the universal-man is\nthis same form considered according to its own mode of being, and\ntherefore as a sort of existentially autonomous and independent entity\n(ibid., p 102). Consequently, like Wyclif, Sharpe holds that\na formal universal actually exists outside the mind if at least one\nindividual instantiates it, so that without individuals, common\nnatures (or essences) are not really universals (ibid., pp.\n105–06). This means that the relationship between common natures and\nsingulars is ultimately based on individuation, since no actual\nuniversality and no instantiation is possible without individuation.\nOn this subject Sharpe seems to accept the essentials of\nAquinas’ doctrine, since he affirms that (i) the universal-man\nis compounded of both common matter and form and that (ii) matter as\naffected by dimensive quantity and other accidental properties\n(materia quanta et accidentibus substrata) is the very\nprinciple of individuation, since it causes the passage from the level\nof universals to that of singulars (ibid., pp. 137–39). Thus,\naccording to Sharpe, explaining individuation means explaining how a\nmultiplicity of individuals can be obtained from a single specific\nnature, the problem at issue being the dialectical development from\none to many and not the passage from abstract to concrete. \nSharpe’s world counts many types of entities: universal and individual\nsubstances and accidents (like homo in communi and Socrates,\nand like the general form of whiteness and this particular form of\nwhiteness), universal abstract substantial essences (like humanity),\nuniversal and individual substantial forms (like the human soul in\ngeneral and the soul of Socrates), general and individual differences\n(like the universal-rationality and the rationality proper to\nSocrates) – each one characterized by its own mode of being. This\nworld is certainly very complex, but its complexity is exceeded by\ncomplexity in language. Sharpe denies that there is a close\ncorrespondence between language and the world, as he believes that our\nthought is caused by the world, and our language by our thought, and\nthe relation between causes and effects is a relation of one to\nmany. \nThe sources of Sharpe’s psychological and epistemological theories are\nSt. Thomas, Duns Scotus, and Ockham, although the latter is chiefly a\npolemical source, as Kennedy 1969 pointed out (pp. 253 and 270). Like\nAquinas, Sharpe \nLike Duns Scotus, Sharpe thinks there is not a real distinction\nbetween the soul and its intellective faculties (i.e., the active\nintellect, the passive intellect, and the will) or among the\nintellective faculties themselves, but only a formal distinction. On\nthe other hand, the soul’s corporeal powers (potentiae\nincorporatae), which depend on bodily organs for their\noperations, are really distinct from the soul and from each other\n(ibid., fol. 236v). \nLike Aquinas and Duns Scotus, and against Ockham, Sharpe affirms that\nintelligible species are required for intellection (ibid.,\nfol. 244r). The main arguments he uses in favor of this thesis are the\nfollowing: \nFinally, like Duns Scotus and Ockham, and against St. Thomas, Sharpe\nstates that our intellect can know perfectly even individual material\nthings (ibid., fol. 253r). What is more, it can know\nimmaterial beings as well, since the most general and proper object of\nour intellect is being in all its amplitude (ibid., fol.\n253v). Sharpe here distinguishes perfect knowledge from complete\nknowledge. For a perfect knowledge of something it is sufficient that\nour intellect is able to single out the object in question against\nothers by means of a proper concept. For a complete knowledge of\nsomething it is necessary that our intellect is able to list all the\nproperties, both substantial and accidental, of the object at issue.\nIt is therefore evident that we can have a perfect knowledge of\nsomething without completely knowing it, as is the case with\nindividual material things and immaterial beings (ibid., fol.\n254r-v). \nSharpe’s commentary on Aristotle’s Physics (ms. Oxford, New\nCollege 238, fols. 53r-208v) contains nine large questions, one for\neach book of Aristotle’s work, except for the fourth book to which\ntwo questions are dedicated, one concerning place and one time. Each\nquestion is divided into two main parts: in the first, Sharpe lists a\nseries of arguments against the question itself (contra questionem\nin se), namely, in general, for supporting a negative answer to\nthe main question. In the second part, he expounds his own opinion and\nrefutes the arguments quod non. \nThe first question (fols. 53r-88v) is whether, from the point of view\nof the natural philosophy, material things have three constitutive\nprinciples only, that is: matter, form, and privation, or not.\nSharpe’s answer is affirmative, but he points out that the\nconstitutive principles of material things are three by species and\nnot in number. Indeed, material things have more than three principles\nin number, but each of them is reducible to matter, or form, or\nprivation. \nThe second question (fols. 89r-128v) is whether there are four kinds\nof causes in the natural world or not. According to Sharpe, the\nefficient, formal, material, and final causes alone are properly\ncauses, while chance and fortune are accidental, and therefore\nimproper (per accidens) causes.  \nThe third question (fols. 128v-143v) is whether motion (motus),\nwhich is an imperfect act of those beings that are in potentia\nto something, is the same item in essentia as action and\npassion. Before answering, Sharpe remarks that we can consider action\nand passion in two ways: either materially or formally. In the first\ncase, the answer is affirmative, since action and passion share the\nphysical reality of the motion itself. But formally conceived, action\nand passion are different from each other and from the motion, since\nthey are distinct relational properties (respectus) of the\nmotion. \nThe fourth question (fols. 144r-160r) is whether the immobile place of\na certain body is the ultimate surface of what that contains that body\nor not. According to Sharpe, it is false that the last surface of the\ncontaining body is absolutely immobile, as only the ninth and tenth\nheavens are such. \nThe fifth question (fols. 160v-175r), but second related to the fourth\nbook of Aristotle’s Physics, is whether time is the measure\nof change in respect of the before and after. Sharpe’s answer is\naffirmative, as always, but he specifies that this is not properly the\ndefinition of time, but rather the description of its nature. In his\nview, it follows from this description that (1) time measures mutable\nthings only, but not immutable; and (2) time is closely connected\nexclusively with that kind of motion which entails a before and an\nafter. \nThe sixth question (fols. 175r-185r) is whether continuity and\ncontrariety of motion (continuitas et contrarietas motuum) are\npresent only in the categories of quantity, quality, and where. Sharpe\nthinks it is so, as only these three categories are properly\ncharacterized by the existence in them of distance. As a matter of\nfact, in these three categories are present sequences of items such\nthat in order to move from one term to the other of the series, it is\nnecessary to pass through intermediate terms. \nThe seventh question (fols. 185v-195r) is whether continuous physical\nmagnitudes are compounded by atomic elements not further divisible.\nSharpe’s answer is negative, for continuous magnitudes are divisible\nad infinitum by definition. \nThe eight question (195v-201r) is whether, in order to compare two\nmotions belonging to the same genus (of motion), it is necessary that\nthe mover and the mobile be simultaneous. Sharpe’s answer is\naffirmative, but he specifies that it is not always possible to\ncompare two motions belonging to the same genus. This is possible only\nwhen the motions that have to be compared belong to the same kind\n(species specialissima). \nThe last question (fols 201v-208v) is whether the perpetual motion of\nthe heavens depends on the prime mover or not. Sharpe’s answer is\naffirmative and very short. Almost all of the second part of the\nquestion deals with the problem of the nature and properties of the\nprime mover.","contact.mail":"alessandro.conti@cc.univaq.it","contact.domain":"cc.univaq.it"}]
