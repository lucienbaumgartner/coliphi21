Hobbes is famous for his early and\nelaborate development of what has come to be known as “social\ncontract theory”, the method of justifying political principles\nor arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made among\nsuitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamous\nfor having used the social contract method to arrive at the\nastonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an\nabsolute—undivided and unlimited—sovereign power.

Hobbes’s moral philosophy has been less\ninfluential than his political philosophy, in part because that theory\nis too ambiguous to have garnered any general consensus as to its\ncontent. Most scholars have taken Hobbes to have affirmed some sort of\npersonal relativism or subjectivism; but views that Hobbes espoused\ndivine command theory, virtue ethics, rule egoism, or a form of\nprojectivism also find support in Hobbes’s texts and among\nscholars. Because Hobbes held that “the true doctrine of the\nLawes of Nature is the true Morall philosophie”, differences in\ninterpretation of Hobbes’s moral philosophy can be traced to differing\nunderstandings of the status and operation of Hobbes’s “laws of\nnature”, which laws will be discussed below. The formerly\ndominant view that Hobbes espoused psychological egoism as the\nfoundation of his moral theory is currently widely rejected, and there\nhas been to date no fully systematic study of Hobbes’s moral\npsychology.\n\n\n\nHobbes wrote several versions of his political philosophy, including\nThe Elements of Law, Natural and Politic (also under the\ntitles Human Nature and De Corpore Politico)\npublished in 1650, De Cive (1642) published in English as\nPhilosophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society in\n1651, the English Leviathan published in 1651, and its Latin\nrevision in 1668. Others of his works are also important in\nunderstanding his political philosophy, especially his history of the\nEnglish Civil War, Behemoth (published 1679), De\nCorpore (1655), De Homine (1658), Dialogue Between a\nPhilosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England (1681),\nand The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance\n(1656). All of Hobbes’s major writings are collected in The\nEnglish Works of Thomas Hobbes, edited by Sir William Molesworth\n(11 volumes, London 1839–45), and Thomae Hobbes Opera Philosophica\nQuae Latina Scripsit Omnia, also edited by Molesworth (5 volumes;\nLondon, 1839–45). Oxford University Press has undertaken a projected\n26 volume collection of the Clarendon Edition of the Works of\nThomas Hobbes. So far 3 volumes are available: De Cive\n(edited by Howard Warrender), The Correspondence of Thomas\nHobbes (edited by Noel Malcolm), and Writings on Common Law\nand Hereditary Right (edited by Alan Cromartie and Quentin\nSkinner). Recently Noel Malcolm has published a three volume edition\nof Leviathan, which places the English text side by side with\nHobbes’s later Latin version of it. Readers new to Hobbes should begin\nwith Leviathan, being sure to read Parts Three and Four, as well as\nthe more familiar and often excerpted Parts One and Two. There are many\nfine overviews of Hobbes’s normative philosophy, some of which are\nlisted in the following selected bibliography of secondary works. \n\nHobbes sought to discover rational principles for the construction of\na civil polity that would not be subject to destruction from within.\nHaving lived through the period of political disintegration\nculminating in the English Civil War, he came to the view that the\nburdens of even the most oppressive government are “scarce\nsensible, in respect of the miseries, and horrible calamities, that\naccompany a Civill Warre”. Because virtually any government\nwould be better than a civil war, and, according to Hobbes’s analysis,\nall but absolute governments are systematically prone to dissolution\ninto civil war, people ought to submit themselves to an absolute\npolitical authority.  Continued stability will require that they also\nrefrain from the sorts of actions that might undermine such a\nregime. For example, subjects should not dispute the sovereign power\nand under no circumstances should they rebel. In general, Hobbes aimed\nto demonstrate the reciprocal relationship between political obedience\nand peace. \n\nTo establish these conclusions, Hobbes invites us to consider what\nlife would be like in a state of nature, that is, a condition without\ngovernment. Perhaps we would imagine that people might fare best in\nsuch a state, where each decides for herself how to act, and is judge,\njury and executioner in her own case whenever disputes arise—and\nthat at any rate, this state is the appropriate baseline against which\nto judge the justifiability of political arrangements. Hobbes terms\nthis situation “the condition of mere nature”, a state of\nperfectly private judgment, in which there is no agency with\nrecognized authority to arbitrate disputes and effective power to\nenforce its decisions. \n\nHobbes’s near descendant, John Locke, insisted in his Second\nTreatise of Government that the state of nature was indeed to be\npreferred to subjection to the arbitrary power of an absolute\nsovereign. But Hobbes famously argued that such a “dissolute\ncondition of masterlesse men, without subjection to Lawes, and a\ncoercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge” would\nmake impossible all of the basic security upon which comfortable,\nsociable, civilized life depends. There would be “no place for\nindustry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no\nculture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that\nmay be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of\nmoving and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of\nthe face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; and\nwhich is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death;\nAnd the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.”\nIf this is the state of nature, people have strong reasons to avoid it,\nwhich can be done only by submitting to some mutually recognized public\nauthority, for “so long a man is in the condition of mere nature,\n(which is a condition of war,) as private appetite is the measure of\ngood and evill.” \n\nAlthough many readers have criticized Hobbes’s state of nature as\nunduly pessimistic, he constructs it from a number of individually\nplausible empirical and normative assumptions. He assumes that people\nare sufficiently similar in their mental and physical attributes that\nno one is invulnerable nor can expect to be able to dominate the\nothers. Hobbes assumes that people generally “shun death”,\nand that the desire to preserve their own lives is very strong in most\npeople. While people have local affections, their benevolence is\nlimited, and they have a tendency to partiality. Concerned that others\nshould agree with their own high opinions of themselves, people are\nsensitive to slights. They make evaluative judgments, but often use\nseemingly impersonal terms like ‘good’ and\n‘bad’ to stand for their own personal preferences. They are\ncurious about the causes of events, and anxious about their futures;\naccording to Hobbes, these characteristics incline people to adopt\nreligious beliefs, although the content of those beliefs will differ\ndepending upon the sort of religious education one has happened to\nreceive. \n\nWith respect to normative assumptions, Hobbes ascribes to each\nperson in the state of nature a liberty right to preserve herself,\nwhich he terms “the right of nature”. This is the right to\ndo whatever one sincerely judges needful for one’s preservation; yet\nbecause it is at least possible that virtually anything might be judged\nnecessary for one’s preservation, this theoretically limited right of\nnature becomes in practice an unlimited right to potentially anything,\nor, as Hobbes puts it, a right “to all things”. Hobbes\nfurther assumes as a principle of practical rationality, that people\nshould adopt what they see to be the necessary means to their most\nimportant ends. \n\nTaken together, these plausible descriptive and normative\nassumptions yield a state of nature potentially fraught with divisive\nstruggle. The right of each to all things invites serious conflict,\nespecially if there is competition for resources, as there will surely\nbe over at least scarce goods such as the most desirable lands,\nspouses, etc. People will quite naturally fear that others may (citing\nthe right of nature) invade them, and may rationally plan to strike\nfirst as an anticipatory defense. Moreover, that minority of prideful\nor “vain-glorious” persons who take pleasure in exercising\npower over others will naturally elicit preemptive defensive responses\nfrom others. Conflict will be further fueled by disagreement in\nreligious views, in moral judgments, and over matters as mundane as\nwhat goods one actually needs, and what respect one properly merits.\nHobbes imagines a state of nature in which each person is free to\ndecide for herself what she needs, what she’s owed, what’s respectful,\nright, pious, prudent, and also free to decide all of these questions\nfor the behavior of everyone else as well, and to act on her judgments\nas she thinks best, enforcing her views where she can. In this situation\nwhere there is no common authority to resolve these many and serious\ndisputes, we can easily imagine with Hobbes that the state of nature\nwould become a “state of war”, even worse, a war of\n“all against all”. \n\nIn response to the natural question whether humanity ever was\ngenerally in any such state of nature, Hobbes gives three examples of\nputative states of nature. First, he notes that all sovereigns are in\nthis state with respect to one another. This claim has made Hobbes the\nrepresentative example of a “realist” in international\nrelations. Second, he opined that many now civilized peoples were\nformerly in that state, and some few peoples—“the savage\npeople in many places of America” (Leviathan, XIII),\nfor instance—were still to his day in the state of nature. Third\nand most significantly, Hobbes asserts that the state of nature will\nbe easily recognized by those whose formerly peaceful states have\ncollapsed into civil war. While the state of nature’s condition of\nperfectly private judgment is an abstraction, something resembling it\ntoo closely for comfort remains a perpetually present possibility, to\nbe feared, and avoided. \n\nDo the other assumptions of Hobbes’s philosophy license the existence\nof this imagined state of isolated individuals pursuing their private\njudgments? Probably not, since, as feminist critics among others have\nnoted, children are by Hobbes’s theory assumed to have undertaken an\nobligation of obedience to their parents in exchange for nurturing,\nand so the primitive units in the state of nature will include\nfamilies ordered by internal obligations, as well as individuals. The\nbonds of affection, sexual affinity, and friendship—as well as\nof clan membership and shared religious belief—may further\ndecrease the accuracy of any purely individualistic model of the state\nof nature. This concession need not impugn Hobbes’s analysis of\nconflict in the state of nature, since it may turn out that\ncompetition, diffidence and glory-seeking are disastrous sources of\nconflicts among small groups just as much as they are among\nindividuals. Still, commentators seeking to answer the question how\nprecisely we should understand Hobbes’s state of nature are\ninvestigating the degree to which Hobbes imagines that to be a\ncondition of interaction among isolated individuals. \n\nAnother important open question is that of what, exactly, it is about\nhuman beings that makes it the case (supposing Hobbes is right) that\nour communal life is prone to disaster when we are left to interact\naccording only to our own individual judgments. Perhaps, while people\ndo wish to act for their own best long-term interest, they are\nshortsighted, and so indulge their current interests without properly\nconsidering the effects of their current behavior on their long-term\ninterest. This would be a type of failure of\nrationality. Alternatively, it may be that people in the state of\nnature are fully rational, but are trapped in a situation that makes\nit individually rational for each to act in a way that is sub-optimal\nfor all, perhaps finding themselves in the familiar ‘prisoner’s\ndilemma’ of game theory. Or again, it may be that Hobbes’s state\nof nature would be peaceful but for the presence of persons (just a\nfew, or perhaps all, to some degree) whose passions overrule their\ncalmer judgments; who are prideful, spiteful, partial, envious,\njealous, and in other ways prone to behave in ways that lead to\nwar. Such an account would understand irrational human passions to be\nthe source of conflict. Which, if any, of these accounts adequately\nanswers to Hobbes’s text is a matter of continuing debate among Hobbes\nscholars. Game theorists have been particularly active in these\ndebates, experimenting with different models for the state of nature\nand the conflict it engenders. \n\nHobbes argues that the state of nature is a miserable state of war\nin which none of our important human ends are reliably realizable.\nHappily, human nature also provides resources to escape this miserable\ncondition. Hobbes argues that each of us, as a rational being, can see\nthat a war of all against all is inimical to the satisfaction of her\ninterests, and so can agree that “peace is good, and therefore\nalso the way or means of peace are good”. Humans will recognize\nas imperatives the injunction to seek peace, and to do those things\nnecessary to secure it, when they can do so safely. Hobbes calls these\npractical imperatives “Lawes of Nature”, the sum of which\nis not to treat others in ways we would not have them treat us. These\n“precepts”, “conclusions” or\n“theorems” of reason are “eternal and\nimmutable”, always commanding our assent even when they may not\nsafely be acted upon. They forbid many familiar vices such as iniquity,\ncruelty, and ingratitude. Although commentators do not agree on whether\nthese laws should be regarded as mere precepts of prudence, or rather\nas divine commands, or moral imperatives of some other sort, all agree\nthat Hobbes understands them to direct people to submit to political\nauthority. They tell us to seek peace with willing others by laying\ndown part of our “right to all things”, by mutually\ncovenanting to submit to the authority of a sovereign, and further\ndirect us to keep that covenant establishing sovereignty. \n\nWhen people mutually covenant each to the others to obey a common\nauthority, they have established what Hobbes calls “sovereignty\nby institution”. When, threatened by a conqueror, they covenant\nfor protection by promising obedience, they have established\n“sovereignty by acquisition”. These are equally legitimate\nways of establishing sovereignty, according to Hobbes, and their\nunderlying motivation is the same—namely fear—whether of\none’s fellows or of a conqueror. The social covenant involves both the\nrenunciation or transfer of right and the authorization of the\nsovereign power. Political legitimacy depends not on how a government\ncame to power, but only on whether it can effectively protect those\nwho have consented to obey it; political obligation ends when\nprotection ceases. \n\nAlthough Hobbes offered some mild pragmatic grounds for preferring\nmonarchy to other forms of government, his main concern was to argue\nthat effective government—whatever its form—must have absolute\nauthority. Its powers must be neither divided nor limited. The powers\nof legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation, war-making (and\nthe less familiar right of control of normative doctrine) are connected\nin such a way that a loss of one may thwart effective exercise of the\nrest; for example, legislation without interpretation and enforcement\nwill not serve to regulate conduct. Only a government that possesses\nall of what Hobbes terms the “essential rights of\nsovereignty” can be reliably effective, since where partial sets\nof these rights are held by different bodies that disagree in their\njudgments as to what is to be done, paralysis of effective government,\nor degeneration into a civil war to settle their dispute, may\noccur. \n\nSimilarly, to impose limitation on the authority of the government\nis to invite irresoluble disputes over whether it has overstepped those\nlimits. If each person is to decide for herself whether the government\nshould be obeyed, factional disagreement—and war to settle the\nissue, or at least paralysis of effective government—are quite\npossible. To refer resolution of the question to some further\nauthority, itself also limited and so open to challenge for\noverstepping its bounds, would be to initiate an infinite regress of\nnon-authoritative ‘authorities’ (where the buck never\nstops). To refer it to a further authority itself unlimited, would be\njust to relocate the seat of absolute sovereignty, a position entirely\nconsistent with Hobbes’s insistence on absolutism. To avoid the\nhorrible prospect of governmental collapse and return to the state of\nnature, people should treat their sovereign as having absolute\nauthority. \n\nWhen subjects institute a sovereign by authorizing it, they agree, in\nconformity with the principle “no wrong is done to a consenting\nparty”, not to hold it liable for any errors in judgment it may\nmake and not to treat any harms it does to them as actionable\ninjustices. Although many interpreters have assumed that by\nauthorizing a sovereign, subjects become morally responsible for the\nactions it commands, Hobbes instead insists that “the external\nactions done in obedience to [laws], without the inward approbation,\nare the actions of the sovereign, and not of the subject, which is in\nthat case but as an instrument, without any motion of his own at\nall” (Leviathan xlii, 106). It may be important to Hobbes’s\nproject of persuading his Christian readers to obey their sovereign\nthat he can reassure them that God will not hold them responsible for\nwrongful actions done at the sovereign’s command, because they cannot\nreasonably be expected to obey if doing so would jeopardize their\neternal prospects. Hence Hobbes explains that “whatsoever a\nsubject...is compelled to do in obedience to his sovereign, and doth\nit not in order to his own mind, but in order to the laws of his\ncountry, that action is not his, but his sovereign’s.”\n(Leviathan xlii. 11) This position reinforces absolutism by permitting\nHobbes to maintain that subjects can obey even commands to perform\nactions they believe to be sinful without fear of divine\npunishment. \n\nWhile Hobbes insists that we should regard our governments as having\nabsolute authority, he reserves to subjects the liberty of disobeying\nsome of their government’s commands. He argues that subjects retain a\nright of self-defense against the sovereign power, giving them the\nright to disobey or resist when their lives are in danger. He also\ngives them seemingly broad resistance rights in cases in which their\nfamilies or even their honor are at stake. These exceptions have\nunderstandably intrigued those who study Hobbes. His ascription of\napparently inalienable rights—what he calls the “true\nliberties of subjects”—seems incompatible with his defense\nof absolute sovereignty. Moreover, if the sovereign’s failure to\nprovide adequate protection to subjects extinguishes their obligation\nto obey, and if it is left to each subject to judge for herself the\nadequacy of that protection, it seems that people have never really\nexited the fearsome state of nature. This aspect of Hobbes’s political\nphilosophy has been hotly debated ever since Hobbes’s time. Bishop\nBramhall, one of Hobbes’s contemporaries, famously\naccused Leviathan of being a “Rebell’s\nCatechism.” More recently, some commentators have argued that\nHobbes’s discussion of the limits of political obligation is the\nAchilles’ heel of his theory. It is not clear whether or not this\ncharge can stand up to scrutiny, but it will surely be the subject of\nmuch continued discussion. \n\nThe last crucial aspect of Hobbes’s political philosophy is his\ntreatment of religion. Hobbes progressively expands his discussion of\nChristian religion in each revision of his political philosophy, until\nit comes in Leviathan to comprise roughly half the book. There\nis no settled consensus on how Hobbes understands the significance of\nreligion within his political theory. Some commentators have argued\nthat Hobbes is trying to demonstrate to his readers the compatibility\nof his political theory with core Christian commitments, since it may\nseem that Christians’ religious duties forbid their affording the sort\nof absolute obedience to their governors which Hobbes’s theory requires\nof them. Others have doubted the sincerity of his professed\nChristianity, arguing that by the use of irony or other subtle\nrhetorical devices, Hobbes sought to undermine his readers’ religious\nbeliefs. Howsoever his intentions are properly understood, Hobbes’s\nobvious concern with the power of religious belief is a fact that\ninterpreters of his political philosophy must seek to explain. Scholars are increasingly interested in how Hobbes thought of the\nstatus of women, and of the family.  Hobbes was one of the earliest\nwestern philosophers to count women as persons when devising a social\ncontract among persons.  He insists on the equality of all people,\nvery explicitly including women. People are equal because they are all\nsubject to domination, and all potentially capable of dominating\nothers.  No person is so strong as to be invulnerable to attack while\nsleeping by the concerted efforts of others, nor is any so strong as\nto be assured of dominating all others. \nIn this relevant sense, women are naturally equal to men.  They are\nequally naturally free, meaning that their consent is required before\nthey will be under the authority of anyone else.  In this, Hobbes’s\nclaims stand in stark contrast to many prevailing views of the time,\naccording to which women were born inferior to and subordinate to\nmen. Sir Robert Filmer, who later served as the target of John\nLocke’s First Treatise of Government, is a well-known\nproponent of this view, which he calls patriarchalism.  Explicitly\nrejecting the patriarchalist view as well as Salic law, Hobbes\nmaintains that women can be sovereigns; authority for him is\n“neither male nor female”. He also argues for natural\nmaternal right: in the state of nature, dominion over children is\nnaturally the mother’s.  He witnesses the Amazons. In seeming contrast to this egalitarian foundation, Hobbes spoke of\nthe commonwealth in patriarchal language. In the move from the state\nof nature to civil society, families are described as\n“fathers”, “servants”, and\n“children”, seemingly obliterating mothers from the\npicture entirely. Hobbes justifies this way of talking by saying that\nit is fathers not mothers who have founded societies. As true as that\nis, it is easy to see how there is a lively debate between those who\nemphasize the potentially feminist or egalitarian aspects of Hobbes’s\nthought and those who emphasize his ultimate exclusion of women.  Such\ndebates raise the question: To what extent are the patriarchal claims\nHobbes makes integral to his overall theory, if indeed they are\nintegral at all?

In this situation\nwhere there is no common authority to resolve these many and serious\ndisputes, we can easily imagine with Hobbes that the state of nature\nwould become a “state of war”, even worse, a war of\n“all against all”. \n\nIn response to the natural question whether humanity ever was\ngenerally in any such state of nature, Hobbes gives three examples of\nputative states of nature. First, he notes that all sovereigns are in\nthis state with respect to one another. This claim has made Hobbes the\nrepresentative example of a “realist” in international\nrelations. Second, he opined that many now civilized peoples were\nformerly in that state, and some few peoples—“the savage\npeople in many places of America” (Leviathan, XIII),\nfor instance—were still to his day in the state of nature. Third\nand most significantly, Hobbes asserts that the state of nature will\nbe easily recognized by those whose formerly peaceful states have\ncollapsed into civil war. While the state of nature’s condition of\nperfectly private judgment is an abstraction, something resembling it\ntoo closely for comfort remains a perpetually present possibility, to\nbe feared, and avoided. \n\nDo the other assumptions of Hobbes’s philosophy license the existence\nof this imagined state of isolated individuals pursuing their private\njudgments? Probably not, since, as feminist critics among others have\nnoted, children are by Hobbes’s theory assumed to have undertaken an\nobligation of obedience to their parents in exchange for nurturing,\nand so the primitive units in the state of nature will include\nfamilies ordered by internal obligations, as well as individuals. The\nbonds of affection, sexual affinity, and friendship—as well as\nof clan membership and shared religious belief—may further\ndecrease the accuracy of any purely individualistic model of the state\nof nature. This concession need not impugn Hobbes’s analysis of\nconflict in the state of nature, since it may turn out that\ncompetition, diffidence and glory-seeking are disastrous sources of\nconflicts among small groups just as much as they are among\nindividuals. Still, commentators seeking to answer the question how\nprecisely we should understand Hobbes’s state of nature are\ninvestigating the degree to which Hobbes imagines that to be a\ncondition of interaction among isolated individuals. \n\nAnother important open question is that of what, exactly, it is about\nhuman beings that makes it the case (supposing Hobbes is right) that\nour communal life is prone to disaster when we are left to interact\naccording only to our own individual judgments. Perhaps, while people\ndo wish to act for their own best long-term interest, they are\nshortsighted, and so indulge their current interests without properly\nconsidering the effects of their current behavior on their long-term\ninterest. This would be a type of failure of\nrationality. Alternatively, it may be that people in the state of\nnature are fully rational, but are trapped in a situation that makes\nit individually rational for each to act in a way that is sub-optimal\nfor all, perhaps finding themselves in the familiar ‘prisoner’s\ndilemma’ of game theory. Or again, it may be that Hobbes’s state\nof nature would be peaceful but for the presence of persons (just a\nfew, or perhaps all, to some degree) whose passions overrule their\ncalmer judgments; who are prideful, spiteful, partial, envious,\njealous, and in other ways prone to behave in ways that lead to\nwar. Such an account would understand irrational human passions to be\nthe source of conflict. Which, if any, of these accounts adequately\nanswers to Hobbes’s text is a matter of continuing debate among Hobbes\nscholars. Game theorists have been particularly active in these\ndebates, experimenting with different models for the state of nature\nand the conflict it engenders. \n\nHobbes argues that the state of nature is a miserable state of war\nin which none of our important human ends are reliably realizable.\nHappily, human nature also provides resources to escape this miserable\ncondition. Hobbes argues that each of us, as a rational being, can see\nthat a war of all against all is inimical to the satisfaction of her\ninterests, and so can agree that “peace is good, and therefore\nalso the way or means of peace are good”. Humans will recognize\nas imperatives the injunction to seek peace, and to do those things\nnecessary to secure it, when they can do so safely. Hobbes calls these\npractical imperatives “Lawes of Nature”, the sum of which\nis not to treat others in ways we would not have them treat us. These\n“precepts”, “conclusions” or\n“theorems” of reason are “eternal and\nimmutable”, always commanding our assent even when they may not\nsafely be acted upon. They forbid many familiar vices such as iniquity,\ncruelty, and ingratitude. Although commentators do not agree on whether\nthese laws should be regarded as mere precepts of prudence, or rather\nas divine commands, or moral imperatives of some other sort, all agree\nthat Hobbes understands them to direct people to submit to political\nauthority. They tell us to seek peace with willing others by laying\ndown part of our “right to all things”, by mutually\ncovenanting to submit to the authority of a sovereign, and further\ndirect us to keep that covenant establishing sovereignty. \n\nWhen people mutually covenant each to the others to obey a common\nauthority, they have established what Hobbes calls “sovereignty\nby institution”. When, threatened by a conqueror, they covenant\nfor protection by promising obedience, they have established\n“sovereignty by acquisition”. These are equally legitimate\nways of establishing sovereignty, according to Hobbes, and their\nunderlying motivation is the same—namely fear—whether of\none’s fellows or of a conqueror. The social covenant involves both the\nrenunciation or transfer of right and the authorization of the\nsovereign power. Political legitimacy depends not on how a government\ncame to power, but only on whether it can effectively protect those\nwho have consented to obey it; political obligation ends when\nprotection ceases. \n\nAlthough Hobbes offered some mild pragmatic grounds for preferring\nmonarchy to other forms of government, his main concern was to argue\nthat effective government—whatever its form—must have absolute\nauthority. Its powers must be neither divided nor limited. The powers\nof legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation, war-making (and\nthe less familiar right of control of normative doctrine) are connected\nin such a way that a loss of one may thwart effective exercise of the\nrest; for example, legislation without interpretation and enforcement\nwill not serve to regulate conduct. Only a government that possesses\nall of what Hobbes terms the “essential rights of\nsovereignty” can be reliably effective, since where partial sets\nof these rights are held by different bodies that disagree in their\njudgments as to what is to be done, paralysis of effective government,\nor degeneration into a civil war to settle their dispute, may\noccur. \n\nSimilarly, to impose limitation on the authority of the government\nis to invite irresoluble disputes over whether it has overstepped those\nlimits. If each person is to decide for herself whether the government\nshould be obeyed, factional disagreement—and war to settle the\nissue, or at least paralysis of effective government—are quite\npossible. To refer resolution of the question to some further\nauthority, itself also limited and so open to challenge for\noverstepping its bounds, would be to initiate an infinite regress of\nnon-authoritative ‘authorities’ (where the buck never\nstops). To refer it to a further authority itself unlimited, would be\njust to relocate the seat of absolute sovereignty, a position entirely\nconsistent with Hobbes’s insistence on absolutism. To avoid the\nhorrible prospect of governmental collapse and return to the state of\nnature, people should treat their sovereign as having absolute\nauthority. \n\nWhen subjects institute a sovereign by authorizing it, they agree, in\nconformity with the principle “no wrong is done to a consenting\nparty”, not to hold it liable for any errors in judgment it may\nmake and not to treat any harms it does to them as actionable\ninjustices. Although many interpreters have assumed that by\nauthorizing a sovereign, subjects become morally responsible for the\nactions it commands, Hobbes instead insists that “the external\nactions done in obedience to [laws], without the inward approbation,\nare the actions of the sovereign, and not of the subject, which is in\nthat case but as an instrument, without any motion of his own at\nall” (Leviathan xlii, 106). It may be important to Hobbes’s\nproject of persuading his Christian readers to obey their sovereign\nthat he can reassure them that God will not hold them responsible for\nwrongful actions done at the sovereign’s command, because they cannot\nreasonably be expected to obey if doing so would jeopardize their\neternal prospects. Hence Hobbes explains that “whatsoever a\nsubject...is compelled to do in obedience to his sovereign, and doth\nit not in order to his own mind, but in order to the laws of his\ncountry, that action is not his, but his sovereign’s.”\n(Leviathan xlii. 11) This position reinforces absolutism by permitting\nHobbes to maintain that subjects can obey even commands to perform\nactions they believe to be sinful without fear of divine\npunishment. \n\nWhile Hobbes insists that we should regard our governments as having\nabsolute authority, he reserves to subjects the liberty of disobeying\nsome of their government’s commands. He argues that subjects retain a\nright of self-defense against the sovereign power, giving them the\nright to disobey or resist when their lives are in danger. He also\ngives them seemingly broad resistance rights in cases in which their\nfamilies or even their honor are at stake. These exceptions have\nunderstandably intrigued those who study Hobbes. His ascription of\napparently inalienable rights—what he calls the “true\nliberties of subjects”—seems incompatible with his defense\nof absolute sovereignty. Moreover, if the sovereign’s failure to\nprovide adequate protection to subjects extinguishes their obligation\nto obey, and if it is left to each subject to judge for herself the\nadequacy of that protection, it seems that people have never really\nexited the fearsome state of nature. This aspect of Hobbes’s political\nphilosophy has been hotly debated ever since Hobbes’s time. Bishop\nBramhall, one of Hobbes’s contemporaries, famously\naccused Leviathan of being a “Rebell’s\nCatechism.” More recently, some commentators have argued that\nHobbes’s discussion of the limits of political obligation is the\nAchilles’ heel of his theory. It is not clear whether or not this\ncharge can stand up to scrutiny, but it will surely be the subject of\nmuch continued discussion. \n\nThe last crucial aspect of Hobbes’s political philosophy is his\ntreatment of religion. Hobbes progressively expands his discussion of\nChristian religion in each revision of his political philosophy, until\nit comes in Leviathan to comprise roughly half the book. There\nis no settled consensus on how Hobbes understands the significance of\nreligion within his political theory. Some commentators have argued\nthat Hobbes is trying to demonstrate to his readers the compatibility\nof his political theory with core Christian commitments, since it may\nseem that Christians’ religious duties forbid their affording the sort\nof absolute obedience to their governors which Hobbes’s theory requires\nof them. Others have doubted the sincerity of his professed\nChristianity, arguing that by the use of irony or other subtle\nrhetorical devices, Hobbes sought to undermine his readers’ religious\nbeliefs. Howsoever his intentions are properly understood, Hobbes’s\nobvious concern with the power of religious belief is a fact that\ninterpreters of his political philosophy must seek to explain. Scholars are increasingly interested in how Hobbes thought of the\nstatus of women, and of the family.  Hobbes was one of the earliest\nwestern philosophers to count women as persons when devising a social\ncontract among persons.  He insists on the equality of all people,\nvery explicitly including women. People are equal because they are all\nsubject to domination, and all potentially capable of dominating\nothers.  No person is so strong as to be invulnerable to attack while\nsleeping by the concerted efforts of others, nor is any so strong as\nto be assured of dominating all others. \nIn this relevant sense, women are naturally equal to men.  They are\nequally naturally free, meaning that their consent is required before\nthey will be under the authority of anyone else.  In this, Hobbes’s\nclaims stand in stark contrast to many prevailing views of the time,\naccording to which women were born inferior to and subordinate to\nmen. Sir Robert Filmer, who later served as the target of John\nLocke’s First Treatise of Government, is a well-known\nproponent of this view, which he calls patriarchalism.  Explicitly\nrejecting the patriarchalist view as well as Salic law, Hobbes\nmaintains that women can be sovereigns; authority for him is\n“neither male nor female”. He also argues for natural\nmaternal right: in the state of nature, dominion over children is\nnaturally the mother’s.  He witnesses the Amazons. In seeming contrast to this egalitarian foundation, Hobbes spoke of\nthe commonwealth in patriarchal language. In the move from the state\nof nature to civil society, families are described as\n“fathers”, “servants”, and\n“children”, seemingly obliterating mothers from the\npicture entirely. Hobbes justifies this way of talking by saying that\nit is fathers not mothers who have founded societies. As true as that\nis, it is easy to see how there is a lively debate between those who\nemphasize the potentially feminist or egalitarian aspects of Hobbes’s\nthought and those who emphasize his ultimate exclusion of women.  Such\ndebates raise the question: To what extent are the patriarchal claims\nHobbes makes integral to his overall theory, if indeed they are\nintegral at all?
