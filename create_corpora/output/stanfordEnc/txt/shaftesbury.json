Gill","entry":"shaftesbury","body.text":"\n\n\nAnthony Ashley Cooper, the third Earl of Shaftesbury, lived from 1671\nto 1713. He was one of the most important philosophers of his day, and\nexerted an enormous influence on European thought throughout the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Shaftesbury received less\nattention in the twentieth century, but in the twenty-first century\nthere has been a significant increase in scholarship on his work.\n\n\nShaftesbury believed that humans are designed to appreciate order and\nharmony, and that proper appreciation of order and harmony is the\nbasis of correct judgments about morality, beauty, and religion. He\nwas at the forefront of developing the idea of a moral sense, of\nexplicating aesthetic experience, of defending political liberty and\ntolerance, and of arguing for religious belief based on reason and\nobservation rather than revelation or scripture. Shaftesbury thought\nthe purpose of philosophy was to help enable people to live better\nlives. Towards that end, he aimed to write persuasively and for the\neducated populace as a whole, deploying a wide variety of styles and\nliterary forms.\n\nShaftesbury lived from 1671 to 1713. His grandfather, the first Earl\nof Shaftesbury, oversaw Shaftesbury’s early upbringing and put\nJohn Locke in charge of his education. Shaftesbury would eventually\ncome to disagree with many aspects of Locke’s philosophy, but\nLocke was clearly a crucially important influence on\nShaftesbury’s philosophical development, and the two remained\nfriends until Locke’s death. Shaftesbury served in Parliament\nand the House of Lords, but ill health curtailed his political career\nwhen he was 30 years old. From then on, he concentrated his energies\non his philosophical and literary writings. (The standard biography of\nShaftesbury is Voitle 1984). \nThe first work Shaftesbury published was an edited collection of\nsermons by Benjamin Whichcote, in 1698. Shaftesbury wrote an unsigned\npreface to the sermons in which he praised Whichcote’s belief in\nthe goodness of human beings and urged his readers to use\nWhichcote’s “good nature” as an antidote to the\npoisonous egoism of Hobbes and the pessimistic supralapsarianism of\nthe Calvinists. \nIn 1699, John Toland published an early version of Shaftesbury’s\nInquiry concerning Virtue or Merit. Shaftesbury renounced\nthis version of the Inquiry, claiming that it was produced\nwithout his authorization, although the details of the episode are\nunclear. \nMost of the works for which Shaftesbury is famous were written between\n1705–1710. It was during this period that he rewrote the\nInquiry concerning Virtue or Merit and completed versions of\nA Letter concerning Enthusiasm, Sensus Communis: An Essay\non the Freedom of Wit and Humour, The Moralists, and\nSoliloquy, or Advice to an Author. \nIn 1711, Shaftesbury collected his mature works into a single volume\nand added to them extensive notes and commentary, naming the book\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times. He revised\nCharacteristicks over the course of the next two years, up\nuntil his death in 1713, and a version with his final changes appeared\nin 1714. \nThere have been three recent editions of Characteristicks: a\nsingle volume edited and with an introduction and scholarly apparatus\nby Klein (1999), with modernized spelling and punctuation; two volumes\nedited and with an introduction and scholarly apparatus by Ayers\n(1999), with original typography; and three volumes with an\nintroduction by Den Uyl (2001), with original typography. In this\nentry, I will refer (as ‘C’) to the online-accessible\nversion of Den Uyl’s Liberty Fund edition, citing the volume and\noriginal page numbers. \nNot all of Shaftesbury’s writings are collected in\nCharacteristicks. Some, such as Second Characters,\nhe intended to publish but did not complete. Others, such as The\nAdept Ladies, he may have circulated privately but decided not to\npublish. Still others, such as Askemata, he might have\nwritten for personal or therapeutic purposes rather than for public\nconsumption. The most comprehensive collection of Shaftesbury’s\npublished and unpublished writings is the Standard Edition:\nComplete Works, Correspondence and Posthumous Writings, edited by\nWolfram Benda et al. (1981–present). \nAccording to Shaftesbury, the purpose of philosophy is to make us\nbetter people. Philosophy’s job is to help us to improve\nourselves—help us “so regulate our governing Fancys,\nPassions, and Humours” (C 1.283)—so that we can become\nwiser, more virtuous, and more organized selves. Philosophy is\n“Mastership in Life and\n Manners”\n(C 3.159; see also 3.303). As Rivers\nputs it, philosophy for Shaftesbury is “the art of learning to\nlive well” (Rivers 2000a: 87; see Klein 1994: 82). Or as Den Uyl\nsays, Shaftesbury’s “main purpose [is] to encourage,\npromote, or otherwise foster an environment conducive to the exercise\nof virtue” (Den Uyl 1998: 282). \nShaftesbury’s belief in the fundamentally\n“self-improving” (C 2.427) purpose of philosophy leads him\nto criticize the turgid, analytic methods of the Scholastics and of\nmodern thinkers such as Descartes and Locke (Schneewind 1998: 307 and\nRivers 2000a: 87). As one of his characters puts it, philosophy must\nbe rescued from its imprisonment in “Colleges and Cells”\nwhere it has been immured by “Empiricks, and pedantick\nSophists” (C 2.184). To achieve its proper goals, philosophy\nneeds to assume guises very different from the dry, unmoving texts of\nShaftesbury’s recent predecessors. \nBecause he thinks that “straightforward discursive writing could\nhave little chances of successfully promoting virtue in a modern\ncontext”, Shaftesbury presents his own ideas in “a\ndaunting array of formats” (Den Uyl 1998: 276). These formats\ninclude: a letter to a friend, a manual for writers, an epistolary\nnovelistic dialogue, a series of “random”\nreflections delivered without “Regularity and\nOrder” (C 3.8, 3.2), an argumentative inquiry, and a\nwitty essay that eschews “the Gravity of strict Argument”\nin favor of the “way of Chat” (C 3.97).  \nGrean claims that Shaftesbury’s forms are “determined by\nthe means of persuasion” more than argumentative rigor, which\nposes a challenge for interpretation (Grean 1967: xviii). Carey says,\n“we cannot look to his work for an argument structured by\npremises and logical deductions” (Carey 2006: 106). To\ncomplicate matters, Shaftesbury adopts different personae in different\nliterary performances, and there are significant interpretative\nquestions about the extent to which we ought to identify the views of\nShaftesbury’s first-person narrators with Shaftesbury\nhimself—especially when one persona explicitly distinguishes\nhimself from another (C 2.263 and 3.12; see Marshall 1986; Prince\n1996; Chaves 2008). In addition, some commentators take\nShaftesbury’s works to be laced with self-distancing irony\n(Klein 1994: 96–99; Jaffro 2008). This diversity of forms,\nstyles, tones, and personae makes it difficult to attribute to\nShaftesbury a single philosophical system of thought. Perhaps we ought\nnot to expect too much systematicity from someone who wrote:\n“The most ingenious way of becoming foolish, is by a\nSystem” (1.290). \nAnother noteworthy feature of Shaftesbury interpretation is his use of\nillustrations. Shaftesbury worked on numerous allegorical\nillustrations for the second edition of Characteristics,\nputting tremendous effort into both the overall plan and the minute\ndetails of these illustrations and engaging in extensive\ncorrespondence with the artists he hired to execute the pictures. He\nseemed to want his audience to read the illustrations as carefully as\nthe words, their meanings (some readily apparent, others subtle to the\npoint of hiddenness) essential to a full understanding of the text.\n(The fullest discussion of the illustrations is Paknadel 1974. Rivers\n2000a and Müller 2010, 2012, and 2013 also shed light on how the\nillustrations interact with and enhance the message of\nShaftesbury’s text.) Shaftesbury took care, as well, to compose\nthe marginal headings and index to Characteristicks, and his\nchoices in those places can also be cited as evidence for certain\ninterpretative views (see Rivers 2000b). \nYet another issue in Shaftesbury interpretation is the role to give to\nwritings not included in Characteristicks. These include\ncompleted works, unfinished versions of projected publications, and\ncorrespondence. Perhaps most important in this regard are\nShaftesbury’s private notebooks, which he called\nAskemata (some of which are collected in Rand’s The\nLife, Unpublished Letters, and Philosophical Regimen [1900]).\nSome commentaries suggest that when we take the Askemata and\nother unpublished writings into account, the picture of\nShaftesbury’s thought that emerges is more Stoical than\nCharacteristicks on its own might have led us to believe\n(Klein 1994: 60, 81–88; Rivers 2000a: 92; Taylor 1989:\n251–2; Maurer and Jaffro 2012; Gatti 2014). There is a question,\nhowever, of whether Askemata and other unpublished writings\nconstitute a more accurate picture of Shaftesbury’s real views,\nor whether at least some of those writings should be taken to have\nserved private therapeutic purposes that differ from the stating of\nhis settled, fully considered positions. Shaftesbury has one of his\nnarrators in Characteristicks object to the publication of\nprivate ruminations (1.162–4), and he himself did not intend for\nAskemata ever to be published.  Moreover, Jaffro has\nargued that Shaftesbury thought that the private self should be\n“secreted” from the public self—that there should be\na “gap” between them (Jaffro 2008: 349)—which only\ncomplicates further the attempt to corral everything Shaftesbury wrote\ninto a systematic, or even fully coherent, single philosophical\nposition. \nShaftesbury maintains that virtue is the promotion of the good of all\nhumankind.  \nTo love the Publick, to study universal Good, and to promote the\nInterest of the whole World, as far as lies within our power, is\nsurely the Height of Goodness. (C 1.37)  \nThe virtuous person strives to develop an “equal, just, and\nuniversal Friendship” with humanity as a whole (C 2.242). \nShaftesbury’s view of virtue is part of his larger view of\ngoodness. Something is good, according to Shaftesbury, if it\ncontributes to the “Existence or Well-being” of the system\nof which it is a part (C 2.18). Every animal is a part of its species.\nSo a particular animal, say a tiger, is a good member of its\nspecies—it’s a good tiger—if it contributes to the\nwell-being of the tiger species as a whole. There is also “a\nsystem of all animals”, which consists of the\n“order” or “economy” of all the different\nanimal species (C 2.19). So a good animal is one that contributes to\nthe well-being of “animal Affairs” in general (C 2.19).\nThe system of all animals, moreover, works with the system “of\nVegetables, and all other things in this inferior World” to\nconstitute “one system of a Globe or Earth” (C\n2.19). So something is a good earthly thing if it contributes to the\nexistence of earthly things in general. And the system of this earth\nis itself part of a “Universal System” or\n“a System of all Things”\n(C 2.20). So to be “wholly and really”\ngood a thing must contribute to the good of the universe as a whole (C\n2.20). This progression of ever-larger systems is a bit dazzling, and\nwe might wonder how we can know (or even make sense of) whether\nsomething is contributing to the well-being of the universe as a\nwhole. But Shaftesbury avoids this problem by discussing in detail\nonly that which makes “a sensible Creature” a good member\nof its species—by focusing on whether an individual creature is\npromoting the well-being of its species (C 2.21). Perhaps Shaftesbury\nbelieves that a creature that contributes to the well-being of its\nspecies will also always contribute to the well-being of the universe\nas a whole, in which case being a good member of one’s species\nwould be coextensive with being “wholly and really”\ngood. \nThe goodness or evilness of a sensible creature, according to\nShaftesbury, is based on the creature’s motives, and not simply\non the results of the creature’s actions (C 2.21–22). This\nleads to a crucial claim: every motive to action involves affection or\npassion (C 2.40–44). Reason alone cannot motivate (C\n2.28–52, 77–81). Shaftesbury strongly emphasizes the\nimportance of motive, arguing that if creatures promote the good of\nthe species only because they are forced to or only because promoting\nthe good is a means to other ends, then they are not actually good\nthemselves. Creatures are good only if their motivating affections are\ndirected “primarily and immediately” at the good\nof the species, not if the connection between their affection and the\ngood of the species is accidental (C 2.26).  \nGoodness is something that is within the reach of all sensible\ncreatures, not only humans but also non-human animals. A creature is\ngood if its affections promote the well-being of the system of which\nit is a part, and non-human animals are just as capable of possessing\nthis type of affection as humans. “Virtue or Merit”, on\nthe other hand, is within the reach of “Man only”\n(C 2.28), and that is because virtue or merit is tied to a special\nkind of affection that only humans possess. This special kind of\naffection is a second-order affection, an affection that has as its\nobject another affection. We humans experience these second-order\naffections because we, unlike non-human animals, are conscious of our\nown passions. Not only do we possess passions, but we also reflect on\nor become aware of the passions we have. And when we reflect on our\nown passions, we develop feelings about them. Imagine you feel the\ndesire to help a person in distress. In addition to simply feeling\nthat desire, you may also become aware that you are feeling that\ndesire. And when you become aware of that, you may experience a\npositive feeling (or “liking”) towards your desire to\nhelp. Or imagine you feel the desire to harm a person who has bested\nyou in a fair competition. In addition to simply feeling the desire to\nharm, you may also become aware that you are feeling that desire. And\nwhen you become aware of that, you may experience a negative feeling\n(or “dislike”) towards your desire to harm. These are the\nkinds of phenomena Shaftesbury has in mind when he writes that  \nthe Affections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their\nContrarys, being brought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects.\nSo that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind\nof Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been\nalready felt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or\nDislike. (C 2.28) \nShaftesbury calls this capacity to feel second-order affections the\n“Sense of Right and Wrong” or the “Moral\nSense” (C 2.28–36, 2.40–46, 2.51, 2.53, 2.60),\nalthough the term is not one he emphasizes or explains in detail (see\nRivers 2000a: 124). There is little evidence that he thinks the moral\nsense is a distinct psychological faculty in the way that Hutcheson\ndid. Nevertheless, Shaftesbury does think that the moral sense\n(whether one faculty or a general disposition) is that which produces\nin us feelings of “like” or “dislike” for our\nown (first-order) affections. When the moral sense is operating\nproperly, it produces positive feelings towards affections that\npromote the well-being of humanity and negative feelings towards\naffections that detract from the well-being of humanity. The\nsecond-order feelings that the moral sense produces can themselves\nmotivate one to action, and people are virtuous if they act from those\nsecond-order feelings. In contrast, non-human animals, because they\nlack the powers of reflection necessary for consciousness of their own\naffections, do not possess a moral sense. So non-human animals are\nincapable of achieving virtue (C 2.28–31). \nShaftesbury argues that because our sense of morality is a sentiment,\nit can be opposed only by another sentiment, and not by reason or\nbelief.  \nSense of Right and Wrong therefore being as natural to us as\nnatural Affection itself, and being a first Principle in our\nConstitution and Make; there is no speculative Opinion, Persuasion or\nBelief, which is capable immediately or directly to\nexclude or destroy it… And this Affection being an original\none of earliest rise in the Soul or affectionate Part; nothing\nbeside contrary Affection, by frequent check and controul, can operate\nupon it, so as either to diminish it in part, or destroy it in the\nwhole. (C 2.44). \nHow to interpret the moral sense is one of the most intensely debated\nissues in Shaftesbury scholarship. The two main camps can be called\nthe constitutive interpretation and the representative\ninterpretation. \nThe constitute interpretation holds that morality is constituted by\nthe subjective affective responses of each human. Sidgwick is often\ncited as a proponent of this interpretation. Sidgwick claims that\n“Shaftesbury is the first moralist who distinctly takes\npsychological experience as the basis of ethics” (Sidgwick 1902:\n187) and that Shaftesbury thinks morality is based on a “sense\n[that] may naturally vary from man to man as the palate does”\n(Sidgwick 1902: 212–13). Sidgwick thought that this subjectivist\naspect of Shaftesbury’s view did damage to morality because it\nundermined the reasons that might be given for being moral. Price\nthought something similar, contending that Shaftesbury’s focus\non “affection” led to his “overlooking entirely\n… the authority belonging to virtue” (Price\n1769: 317). Tuveson is in the same camp, contending that\nShaftesbury’s view differed from prior versions of a moral sense\n(such as Henry More’s) by eliminating the role of reason\naltogether.  \nIt is the feeling, not reason, which is the right moral judge; it is\nthe emotions, according to the Inquiry, which are the right\nmoral guide. (Tuveson 1948: 258)  \nIn saying this, Tuveson claims that Shaftesburean moral judgments are\nbased on an immediate reaction—an inclining to or recoiling\nfrom—and not on a discursively-arrived upon “opinion or\nformal judgment” (Tuveson 1960: 53; see Filonowiz 1989: 192).\nTuveson also claims that Shaftesburean moral judgments do not\nrepresent anything in mind-independent reality. According to Tuveson,\nShaftesbury thought that “that the value area of the mind must\nconstitute a world to itself, outside the process of cognition”\n(Tuveson 1960: 54). Those in the constitutive camp may also choose to\nemphasize Shaftesbury’s influence on Hutcheson and Hume, whose\nsentimentalism is sometimes taken to eschew commitment to\nmind-independent moral properties. \nThe representative interpretation holds, in contrast, that the\naffective responses of Shaftesbury’s moral sense represent moral\nfacts or properties that exist independently of our reactions to them.\nIrwin advances this view when he claims that Shaftesbury “treats\nthe moral sense as a sign of objective moral properties, not as their\nmetaphysical basis” (Irwin 2008: 369), and that the moral sense\nhas “an indicative (or detective) role”. According to\nIrwin, Shaftesbury believes that moral properties have a\n“logical independence from” our beliefs and judgments\nabout them (Irwin 2015: 866–7). Schneewind also believes that\nShaftesbury’s moral sense detects objective moral properties,\ncontending that the moral faculty  \nis special because through it we become aware of an objective\norder… The approval and disapproval themselves are feelings,\nbut they reveal that the set of passions being considered either is or\nis not harmonious. (Schneewind 1998: 302)  \nRivers develops a similar view, arguing that our moral faculty enables\nus to “recognize and respond” to the objective property of\nharmony (Rivers 2000a: 143; see also 126). Those in the representative\ncamp may emphasize the influence on Shaftesbury of the Cambridge\nPlatonists, whose rationalist moral theories included a clear\ncommitment to the existence of moral properties independent of our\nreactions (Cassirer 1953: 159–202; Gill 2006: 77–82). \nThe representative and constitutive camps can both cite passages that\npose interpretative challenges to the other side. \nIn favor of the representative interpretation and challenging for the\nconstitutive are claims Shaftesbury makes that seem to imply that\nmoral properties are independent of human reactions. He maintains, for\ninstance, that what is destructive of the human species can never be\n \nVirtue of any kind, or in any sense; but must remain still\nhorrid Depravity, notwithstanding any Fashion, Law, Custom, or\nReligion; which may be ill and vitious it-self, but can never\nalter the eternal Measures, and immutable independent Nature\nof Worth and Virtue. (C\n2.35–36)  \nHe also calls himself a “realist”, and seems to do so in a\nway that precludes a constitutive reading (see Irwin 2015 and Carey\n2006: 98–99, 130–4). As one of his characters puts it when\nspeaking of the author of the Inquiry:  \nFor being, in respect of Virtue, what you\nlately call’d a Realist; he endeavours to shew,\n“That it is really something in it-self, and in the\nnature of Things: not arbitrary or factitious, (if I may so\nspeak) not constituted from without, or dependent on Custom,\nFancy, or Will; not even on the Supreme\nWill it-self, which can no-way govern it: but being necessarily\ngood, is govern’d by it, and ever uniform with it.” (C\n2.267)  \nShaftesbury says as well that “the principal End” of\nCharacteristicks is  \n“To assert the Reality of a Beauty and\nCharm in moral as well as\nnatural Subjects; and to demonstrate the Reasonableness of a\nproportionate Taste, and\ndeterminate Choice, in Life\nand Manners.” The Standard of\nthis kind, and the noted Character of Moral Truth\n[are] firmly establish’d in Nature\nit-self. (C 3.303; see 1.336)  \nThose in the representative camp can also claim support from\nShaftesbury’s comparison of virtue to beauty. Shaftesbury\ncontends that beauty is a mind-independent, objective property. But\nsince aesthetic responses are representative of mind-independent\nreality, and our moral responses are similar or perhaps identical to\nour aesthetic responses, it follows that our moral responses are\nrepresentative as well (Schneewind 1998: 303–4; Carey 2006: 107,\n125, 132–4). \nIn favor of the constitutive interpretation and challenging for the\nrepresentative are statements Shaftesbury makes that seem to imply\nthat the basis for virtue is dependent only on human reactions and\nthus insensitive to any mind-independent fact (Taylor 1989:\n256–7; Den Uyl 1998: 90; Gill 2000: 538–47). He says, for\ninstance, that our reason to be virtuous is impervious even to the\nsupposition that we know nothing of the external world.  \nFor let us carry Scepticism ever so far, let us doubt, if we\ncan, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes\nwithin our-selves. Our Passions and Affections are known to\nus. They are certain, whatever the Objects may be,\non which they are employ’d. Nor is it of any concern to our\nArgument, how these exterior Objects stand; whether they are Realitys,\nor mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For ill Dreams\nwill be equally disturbing. And a good Dream, if Life be\nnothing else, will be easily and happily pass’d. In this Dream\nof Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have the same force; our\nBalance and Economy hold good, and our Obligation to\nVirtue is in every respect the same. (C 2.173)\n \nIn a similar vein he writes,  \nIf there be no real Amiableness or Deformity in moral Acts,\nthere is at least an imaginary one of full force. (C\n2.43) \nCommentators on either side of the representative-constitutive divide\nmay try to show that passages that seem troublesome for their\ninterpretation do not mean what the other side claims. Towards that\nend, commentators may try to soft-pedal one set of Shaftesbury’s\nstatements, perhaps emphasizing the different purposes and different\npersonae in Shaftesbury’s writings, or explicating the fuller\ncontext of various quotations in a way that reveals that Shaftesbury\nis not himself endorsing certain claims but rather arguing that even\non assumptions he does not accept his main points about virtue will\nstill stand. Jaffro has argued that Shaftesbury consciously changed\nhis mind, or at least decided that he should change how to express his\nviews, moving from an early account that had subjectivist implications\nto a later account that was more objectivist (Jaffro 2007). Another\npossible response to this interpretative issue is to hold that\nShaftesbury is simply inconsistent, or that he is unaware of the\nimplications of some of his own claims. As Raphael puts it, “The\nfact is that no coherent view can be extracted from Shaftesbury about\nthe moral faculty or about moral theory in general” (Raphael\n1947: 17). Kivy writes,  \nIt has been the opinion of many, from Shaftesbury’s time to our\nown, that no coherent view emerges; and I am inclined, in the last\nanalysis, to agree. (Kivy 2003: 16) \nDarwall (1995) has developed an interpretation of Shaftesbury’s\nmoral sense that does not fit in either the constitutive or the\nrepresentative camp. According to Darwall, Shaftesbury believes that\nthe normative authority of morality leads to the view that the basis\nof morality is within each agent, which conflicts with interpretations\nthat hold that the moral sense represents something external. But\nDarwall also holds that Shaftesbury believes that there is a\nrationally necessary view of morality that each agent should come to,\nwhich conflicts with interpretations that hold that the moral sense\nproduces subjective and contingent emotional experiences. On\nDarwall’s interpretation, Shaftesbury is concerned with autonomy\nand rationality in a way that warrants classifying him as a clear\nprecursor to Kant. Den Uyl has raised concerns about Darwall’s\ninterpretation by contending that the moral sense is the source of\nfavorable attitudes rather than the law-like rules of a proto-Kantian\nrationalist (Den Uyl 1998: 304). Another objection to Darwall’s\ninterpretation can be found in Irwin, who claims that\nShaftesbury’s moral sense view is externalist—i.e., that\none’s moral sense produces responses that have no necessary\nconnection to one’s motivation or reason to act morally (Irwin\n2015: 877 and 880). Darwall’s interpretation, in contrast,\nrequires a strongly internalist reading of Shaftesbury. \nThroughout his works, Shaftesbury attacks a view of human motivation\nthat he associates with Hobbesian and voluntarism. Some commentators\nhave thought that the view of human motivation Shaftesbury advances in\nthese anti-Hobbesian and anti-voluntarist passages is ardently\nnon-egoistic—i.e., that Shaftesbury believes that human agents\ncan be motivated by considerations other than self-interest (Den Uyl\n1998; Schneewind 1998; Irwin 2008; Carey 2006). Other commentators\nhave argued that Shaftesbury himself holds an egoist view of human\nmotivation—that he thinks every human’s actions are\nmotivated by self-interested desires—and that his attacks on\nHobbes and the voluntarists are directed only at what he takes to be\nan incorrect view of self-interested incentives (Sidgwick 1902; Peach\n1958; Trianosky 1998; Grote 2010). Still other commentators have\nclaimed that Shaftesbury is inconsistent, opposing egoist views of\nhuman motivation in some passages and assuming them in other passages\n(Martineau 1886: 508; Wiley 1940: 74). \nThose who interpret Shaftesbury as an anti-egoist point to passages in\nwhich he argues that theories that rely exclusively on selfish\nmotivation cannot explain plainly observable human behavior. In\nWit and Humour, Shaftesbury attacks those who  \nwou’d new-frame the human Heart; and … reduce all its\nMotions, Balances and Weights, to that one Principle and Foundation of\na cool and deliberate Selfishness. (C 1.116)  \nIn fact, Shaftesbury argues, careful observation reveals that humans\nare motivated by many non-selfish considerations.  \n[W]hoever looks narrowly into the Affairs of it, will find, that\nPassion, Humour, Caprice, Zeal,\nFaction, and a thousand other Springs, which are counter to\nSelf-Interest, have as considerable a part in the Movements\nof this Machine. There are more Wheels and Counter-Poises in\nthis Engine than are easily imagin’d. ’Tis of too complex\na kind, to fall under one simple View, or be explain’d thus\nbriefly in a word or two. The Studiers of this Mechanism must\nhave a very partial Eye, to overlook all other Motions besides [selfishness]. (C 1.115)  \nPeople exhibit non-selfish “Civility,\nHospitality, Humanity towards Strangers or People in distress”\n(C 1.118). Their concern for  \nRelations, Friends, Countrymen,\nLaws, Politick Constitutions, the Beauty of\nOrder and Government, and the Interest of Society and\nMankind … naturally raise a stronger Affection\nthan any which was grounded upon the narrow bottom of mere Self.\n(C 1.117)  \nIndeed, even those tendencies that are most destructive are usually\nbased in sociable, non-selfish concerns. War and social disruption are\nusually caused not by selfishness but by a powerful concern for party\nor clan. It is love and fellowship for those in one’s group that\nlead to widespread conflict, not self-love.  \nIn short, the very Spirit of Faction, for the greatest part,\nseems to be no other than the Abuse or Irregularity of that social\nLove, and common Affection, which is natural to Mankind.\nFor the Opposite of Sociableness is Selfishness. And\nof all Characters, the thorow-selfish one is the least forward in\ntaking Party. (C 1.114–15)  \nShaftesbury acknowledges that some have tried to show that all of\nthese seemingly sociable tendencies result only from “a more\ndeliberate, or better-regulated Self-love” (C\n1.118). But he contends that such views either fail to explain what\npeople actually do or collapse into tautology (C 2.226–7). \nAgainst Hobbes himself, Shaftesbury presents a pleasantly ironic\nad hominem argument. If Hobbes had truly been entirely\nconcerned with his own self-interest, he would never have publically\nadvanced the view that people are motivated entirely by self-interest.\nHe would, rather, have spoken “the best of human Nature”\nso that he could “the easier abuse it” (C 1.94). But\nHobbes did not behave in this way. He tried to convince people of the\nselfishness of human beings precisely because he wanted to help humans\nbeings, even though this conduct placed him at great peril. His very\nadvancement of the selfish thesis refutes it. That  \ngood sociable Man, as savage and unsociable as he wou’d make\nhimself and all Mankind appear by his Philosophy, expos’d\nhimself during his Life, and took the utmost pains, that after his\nDeath we might be deliver’d from the occasion of these Terrors.\nHe did his utmost to shew us … that there was nothing which by\nNature … drew us to the Love of what was without, or beyond\nour-selves: Tho the Love of such great Truths and sovereign\nMaxims as he imagin’d these to be, made him the most laborious\nof all Men in composing Systems of this kind for our Use; and\nforc’d him, notwithstanding his natural Fear, to run continually\nthe highest risk of being a Martyr for our Deliverance. (C\n1.89–90) \nAccording to Shaftesbury, both Hobbes and the voluntarists believed\nthat the only motive humans have to be moral is that a powerful being\nwill reward them for virtue and punish them for vice. The\nHobbesian’s rewards and punishments are meted out by the\nsovereign, the voluntarist’s by God. Were it not for this\npowerful being’s rewards and punishments, according to\nShaftesbury’s understanding of Hobbesianism and the voluntarism,\nhumans would have no motivating reasons to be moral. In an oft-cited\nletter, Shaftesbury places Locke in the same category as Hobbes and\nthe voluntarists, condemning the lot of them for reducing all moral\nmotivation to these selfish concerns. (For discussion of this letter\nand Shaftesbury’s philosophical relationship to Locke, see Carey\n2006: 98 and 138). Central to much of Shaftesbury’s account of\nmorality, in contrast, is the claim that people are virtuous only to\nthe extent that they are motivated by something other than selfish\nconcern to gain reward and avoid punishment (C 2.23, 2.25, 2.60,\n2.66). According to Shaftesbury, virtue consists not in the actions\npeople perform, but in their motives for performing them. And the\nmotive with which we identify virtue is concern for humanity, not\nselfishness. Shaftesbury emphasizes this point by drawing attention to\nthe difference between knaves and saints. In order to be motivated to\ndo the right thing, knaves “stand in need of such a rectifying\nObject as the Gallows before their eyes”, but someone\ntruly honest will not have such a need.  \nAnd if a Saint had no other Virtue than what\nwas rais’d in him by the same Objects of Reward and Punishment,\nin a more distant State; I know not whose Love or Esteem he might gain\nbesides, but for my own part, I shou’d never think him worthy of\nmine. (C 1.127)  \nWe judge saints to be virtuous because we think they are motivated by\nsomething other than the selfishness of the knave. If we came to\nbelieve that the saints were motivated by self-interest as well, we\nwould no longer judge them to be virtuous. As Shaftesbury puts it,\n \nIf the Love of doing good, be not, of it-self, a good and\nright Inclination; I know not how there can possibly be such\na thing as Goodness or Virtue. (C 1.98) \nShaftesbury maintains, further, that stressing reward and punishment\nis actually counterproductive to the promotion of virtue. This is\nbecause a stress on reward and punishment tends to crowd out or\nobliterate the intrinsic concern for the good of the species that is\nessential to true virtue. He writes,  \nI Have known a Building, which by the Officiousness of the Workmen has\nbeen so shor’d, and screw’d up, on the\nside where they pretended it had a Leaning, that it has at last been\nturn’d the contrary way, and overthrown. There has something,\nperhaps, of this kind happen’d in Morals. Men have not\nbeen contented to shew the natural Advantages of Honesty and Virtue.\nThey have rather lessen’d these, the better, as they thought, to\nadvance another Foundation. They have made Virtue so\nmercenary a thing, and have talk’d so much of its\nRewards, that one can hardly tell what there is in it, after\nall, which can be worth rewarding. (C 1.97; see also 2.33–34 and\n39–40)  \nPeople who dwell on reward and punishment are more likely to become\noverly concerned with their own “Self-good, and private\nInterest”, which must “insensibly diminish the Affections\ntowards publick Good, or the Interest of Society and introduce a\ncertain Narrowness of spirit” (C 2.58). Stressing reward and\npunishment cannot make people more virtuous, and it may very well make\nthem less so (C 1.97–98, 2.52–56). It is for this reason\nthat Shaftesbury has one of his characters in The Moralists\nsay that the author of the Inquiry  \nendeavors chiefly to establish Virtue on Principles, by which\nhe is able to argue with those who are not as yet induc’d to own\na God, or Future State. If he cannot\ndo thus much, he reckons he does nothing. (C 2.266–7) \nIn his discussions of Hobbes and the voluntarists, then, Shaftesbury\nseems to be attacking the view that humans are motivated only by\nself-interest and, relatedly, that self-interest is the only reason\nfor us to be moral. This anti-egoist reading can also point to\nShaftesbury’s aesthetic views, which center on the idea that our\nlove of beauty is entirely non-selfish (see Stolnitz 1961a,b,c).\nShaftesbury makes this seemingly anti-egoistic aesthetic point when he\ndistinguishes the entirely non-selfish appreciation of a thing’s\nbeauty from the self-interested desire to own or command that thing\n(2.396–7). \nOther commentators, however, interpret Shaftesbury egoistically, as\nholding that every human action is motivated by the agent’s\ndesires for his or her own pleasure (Sidgwick 1902: 185; Peach 1958;\nTrianosky 1978; Grote 2010). A crucial text for the egoist reading is\nthe beginning of Book 2 of the Inquiry, where Shaftesbury\nwrites  \nWe have consider’d what Virtue\nis, and to whom the Character belongs. It remains to inquiry,\nWhat Obligation there is to Virtue;\nor what Reason to embrace it. (C\n2.45)  \nShaftesbury goes on to argue that being moral is in every\nperson’s own best interests—that one will be happier if\none is virtuous rather than vicious. As he sums up his argument in the\nconclusion of the Inquiry,  \nThus have we endeavour’d to prove what was propos’d in the\nbeginning… To be wicked or vitious, is to be\nmiserable and unhappy… On the other side; the\nHappiness and Good of Virtue has\nbeen prov’d. (C 2.98–99)  \nAnd again:  \n“That to yield or consent to any thing ill or immoral, is a\nBreach of Interest, and leads to the greatest Ills”: and,\n“That on the other side, Every thing which is an Improvement\nof Virtue, or an Establishment of right Affection and Integrity, is an\nAdvancement of Interest, and leads to the greatest and most solid\nHappiness and Enjoyment.” (C 2.100).  \nThis performance in the Inquiry is the basis for\ninterpretations that claim that Shaftesbury believes that the only\nsalient answer that could be given to the question, Why be moral?, is\nthat being moral is in one’s own self-interest—and, more\ngenerally, that Shaftesbury thinks that self-interest is the only\nultimate reason for action. \nHow do egoistic interpretations handle the many texts in which\nShaftesbury attacks selfish theories of morality and human nature?\nSome have come to the exasperated conclusion that Shaftesbury is\nsimply inconsistent, sometimes assuming egoism sometimes opposing it\n(Martineau 1886: 508; Wiley 1940: 74). Others have argued that Shaftesbury’s\ncriticisms of selfish theories do not conflict with an overall\negoistic interpretation. Grote (2010) maintains that when Shaftesbury\nattacks Hobbes, the voluntarists, and other “selfish”\ntheorists, he is not attacking the view that self-interest is the only\nreason to be virtuous but rather is attacking the view that\nexternally-bestowed rewards and punishments are the only\nreasons to be virtuous. According to Grote, what Shaftesbury means to\nshow is that virtue has decisive “natural\nadvantages”—that being virtuous will make one happier\nregardless of what anyone else may do to you. Shaftesbury’s\nopponents, on this reading, are those who claim that the relevant\nself-interested considerations are the rewards and punishment meted\nout by God or sovereign. The crucial contrast is between, on the one\nhand, the arbitrariness of the rewards and punishments of the\nvoluntarist God and the Hobbesian sovereign and, on the other hand,\nthe naturalness of the internal mental enjoyments that come from being\nvirtuous—not the contrast between self-interested and\nnon-self-interested motives. \nSuch is how egoistic interpretations attempt to explain away what many\nhave taken to be Shaftesbury’s attacks on egoist explanations of\nhuman behavior. How do anti-egoist interpretations attempt to explain\naway the efforts Shaftesbury makes in Book 2 of the Inquiry\nto show that virtue’s conduciveness to one’s own happiness\nis reason to embrace it? Schneewind denies Shaftesbury ever tries\n“to bribe the reader into becoming virtuous, by showing that it\npays” (Schneewind 1998: 308). According to Schneewind, in Book 2\nof the Inquiry Shaftesbury is  \ntrying to show that the natural world—the realm in which the\nnatural good of happiness exists—is such that it makes sense for\nus to act morally within it. (Schneewind 1998: 308)  \nIrwin argues that virtuous Shaftesburean agents have an immediate\naversion to vice that is based on a kind of aesthetic disgust-reaction\nrather than a reflective calculation about what will benefit them in\nthe long run (Irwin 2008: 357). But Irwin also thinks we can find in\nShaftesbury elements of a eudaimonist theory, according to which\n“it is reasonable to examine the contribution of virtue to\nhappiness” because “the pursuit of happiness [is] the\npursuit of rational structure and harmony”—which does not\ncollapse into the Hobbesian egoist view that we should be virtuous\nbecause it maximizes our pleasure (Irwin 2008: 357). Den Uyl also\nlocates in Shaftesbury something akin to “a classical virtue\nethics” (Den Uyl 1998: 292). And Filonowicz makes a similar\npoint, arguing that virtue and happiness are so closely identified in\nShaftesbury that it distorts his view to claim that we seek one as a\nmere means for the other. Shaftesbury is not trying to show  \nthat we are required to be moral by the sheer personal utility of\nbeing so… [H]is point, rather, [is] that questions of expected\noverall benefit or less will seem moot to anyone who has actually\nachieved, and so experienced, moral health or harmony of affection.\nVirtue is experienced as being its own reward. (Filonowicz 2008:\n86) \nIn his Essay on the Passions, Hutcheson addresses the same\nquestion that non-egoist interpretations of Shaftesbury must face in\nlight of Shaftesbury’s arguments for the coincidence of virtue\nand interest—i.e., if virtue is non-self-interested, why show\nthat virtue is in everyone’s self-interest? Hutcheson writes,\n \nIt may perhaps seem strange, that when in this Treatise\nVirtue is supposed disinterested; yet so much Pains is taken,\nby a Comparison of our several Pleasures, to prove\nthe Pleasures of Virtue to be the greatest we are capable of,\nand that consequently it is truest Interest to be\nvirtuous. (Hutcheson 1742: viii)  \nHutcheson goes on to maintain that while virtue does consist of truly\nnon-selfish concern for humanity, it is still useful to show that\nvirtue does not conflict with happiness, as that will prevent people\nfrom believing in a conflict between the two ends that would\nconstitute a great obstacle to virtue. It seems possible that\nShaftesbury was anticipating this Hutchesonian thought (a thought that\nHutcheson attributes to Shaftesbury) when arguing in Book 2 of the\nInquiry for the coincidence of virtue and happiness. \nRegardless of whether or not Shaftesbury is accurately characterized\nas egoistic, he clearly does contend that virtue conduces to\none’s happiness and vice to one’s misery—that\n“Virtue and Interest may be found at last to\nagree” (C 2.16). And he develops a psychological explanation for\nthis agreement. Central to this explanation is his distinction between\npleasures of the body and pleasures of the mind. Shaftesbury argues\nthat a person’s happiness depends more on mental pleasures than\non bodily pleasures. He then seeks to show that living virtuously is\nby far the best way to gain the crucially important mental pleasures\n(C 2.47–73). Shaftesbury bases much of his argument for the\nconnection between virtue and happiness on the idea that the mental\npleasures are within one’s own control, insulated from the\nvicissitudes of “Fortune, Age, Circumstances, and Humour”\n(C 2.434). As one of Shaftesbury’s characters rhetorically asks,\n \nHow can we better praise the goodness of Providence, than in\nthis, ‘That it has plac’d our Happiness and Good in things\nWe can bestow upon ourselves’? (C 2.435; see\n2.228–34)  \nIn arguing for the importance of the mental pleasures, Shaftesbury\nalso develops a view of the difference between higher and lower\npleasures—and of the superiority of the former—that\nclearly anticipates Mill’s use of that distinction in chapter 2\nof Utilitarianism (C 2.228–34). \nMuch of the interpretative discussion of Shaftesbury’s response\nto the question, Why be moral?, has focused on Book 2 of the\nInquiry. But Shaftesbury discusses the issue in Wit and\nHumour and Soliloquy as well, asking in the later:\n“Why shou’d a Man be honest in the dark?”\n(C 1.125). At times Shaftesbury suggests that a person who asks this\nquestion is already lost to virtue—that someone who cares about\nvirtue for its own sake won’t need another reason to act\nvirtuously, and that someone who needs another reason doesn’t\nhave what it takes to be truly virtuous in the first place. Other\ntimes, Shaftesbury suggests that we should be honest even in the dark\n(i.e., virtuous even when we will not be punished for vice) because\nsuch conduct is a necessary condition for having an identity or\nunified self at all (C 1.283–4). The importance of developing a\n(unified) self is a striking, recurring theme in Shaftesbury’s\nwritings, and he suggests that helping one to develop such a self is\nthe raison d’etre of philosophy (see Mijuskovic 1971,\nWinkler 2000, Purviance 2004, and Jaffro 2014). An additional response\nShaftesbury offers is to equate a commitment to morality to the love\nof beauty (Brown 1995; Gill 2014). He writes,  \n[A] real Genius, and thorow Artist, in whatever\nkind, can never, without the greatest unwillingness and shame, be\ninduc’d to act below his Character, and for mere Interest be\nprevail’d with to prostitute his Art or Science, by performing\ncontrary to its known Rules… Be they ever so idle, dissolute,\nor debauch’d; how regardless soever of other Rules; they abhor\nany Transgression in their Art, and wou’d chuse to lose\nCustomers and starve, rather than by a base Compliance with the World,\nto act contrary to what they call the\nJustness and Truth of Work.  \n“Sir”, (says a poor Fellow of this kind, to his rich\nCustomer) “you are mistaken in coming to me, for such a piece of\nWorkmanship. Let who will make it for you, as you fansy; I know it to\nbe wrong. Whatever I have made hither to, has been true\nWork. And neither for your sake or any body’s else, shall I\nput my hand to any other”. \nThis is Virtue! real Virtue, and Love of Truth;\nindependent of Opinion, and above the World.\nThis Disposition transfer’d to the\nwhole of Life, perfects a Character, and makes that\nProbity and Worth which the Learned are often at\nsuch a loss to explain. For is there not a Workmanship and\na Truth in Actions? (C\n1.261–2)  \nHere Shaftesbury points out that we readily accept the possibility of\nartists remaining committed to their art, regardless of the external\nrewards that may result from betraying it. We don’t think such\nartists need an answer to the question, “Why produce excellent\nworks rather than poor ones?” because we understand their\nvaluing the art as an end in itself. But one’s\nlife—one’s character and conduct—can be, or can fail\nto be, morally beautiful. And the commitment people who appreciate\nmoral beauty have to instantiate it can have the same force on their\nconduct as an artist’s commitment to produce excellent works.\nSome might think that connecting morality and beauty in this way\nminimizes or undermines the importance of morality. But given\nShaftesbury’s realist view of beauty—and his equating of\nbeauty and truth—no such thing follows on his account. \nBeauty, for Shaftesbury, is a kind of harmony, proportion, or order\nthat exists independently of human minds. The human responses that are\nthe origin of human judgments of beauty are not the origin of beauty\nitself. As Shaftesbury writes,  \nHarmony is Harmony by Nature, let Men\njudg ever so ridiculously of Musick. So is Symmetry and\nProportion founded still in Nature, let Mens Fancy\nprove ever so barbarous, or their Fashions ever so Gothick in\ntheir Architecture, Sculpture, or whatever other designing Art. (C\n1.216)  \nThat there is a real standard of beauty—i.e., a standard with a\nreal existence independent of human minds—is one of the central\nideas of Shaftesbury’s thought as a whole. He writes, “It\nhas been the main Scope and principal End” of\nCharacteristicks is to “assert the Reality of a Beauty\nand Charm in\nmoral as well as natural Subjects” (C\n3.303). \nShaftesbury places all beauty in a three-part hierarchy. The lowest\norder of beauty belongs to “the dead\nForms”—physical things such as manmade works of art\nand natural objects (C 2.406). The second order of beauty belongs to\nhuman minds, or “the Forms which form, that is, which\nhave Intelligence, Action, and Operation” (C 2.406). The third\norder of beauty belongs to that “which forms not only such as we\ncall mere Forms, but even the Forms which form” (C\n2.408). This highest, most supreme and sovereign beauty, belongs to\nGod, who has created everything in the world, including human minds\n(see Kivy 2003: 12; Den Uyl 1998: 294).  \nShaftesbury discusses the beauty of literature, music, and painting.\nHe takes the primary instances of physical beauty to be landscapes and\nother features of the natural world. Shaftesbury’s characters in\nThe Moralists discuss the beauty of gardens, arguing for the\nsuperiority of naturalness or wildness over the artifice of formal\ngardens (C 2.393–4). For discussion of Shaftesbury’s views\nof gardening and their influences, see Leatherbarrow (1984), Liu\n(2008), and Fleming (2014). \nTheocles, Shaftesbury’s main character in The\nMoralists, says that ‘beauty’ and ‘good’\nare “one and the same” (C 2.399) and that\n“there is no real Good beside the Enjoyment of\nBeauty” (C 2.422). In the Miscellaneous\nReflections, Shaftesbury says that  \nwhat is beautiful is harmonious and\nproportionable; what is harmonious and proportionable, is\ntrue; and what is at once both\nbeautiful and true, is, of consequence,\nagreeable and good[.] (C 3.183)  \nDarwall has suggested that for Shaftesbury “moral goodness is a\nspecies of beauty” (Darwall 1995: 185). Den Uyl has argued\nagainst this interpretation, claiming instead that Shaftesbury meant\nto assert that beauty and goodness were truly one and the same thing,\nboth constituted by the very same property of order and harmony (Den\nUyl 1998: 296; see also Stolnitz 1961a: 103). Rivers thinks\nShaftesbury was ambivalent  \nabout using the language of aesthetics to discuss ethics. In some\nplaces it seems that he is drawing an analogy purely for rhetorical\npurposes between art and morals, in others that he really means that\nthe beautiful is the good. (Rivers 2000a: 143) \nAesthetic responses, for Shaftesbury, involve some kind of affective\nreaction, but there is interpretative disagreement about the extent to\nwhich that affective reaction is immediate or reflective. In some\npassages, Shaftesbury seems to suggest that our sense of beauty\noperates immediately, like our sensations of color.  \nNo sooner the Eye opens upon Figures, the Ear to\nSounds, than straight the Beautiful results, and\nGrace and Harmony are known and acknowledg’d.\n(C 2.414)  \nThe Shapes, Motions, Colours, and Proportions of [Bodys, or\nthe common Subjects of Sense] being presented to our Eye;\nthere necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity, according to the\ndifferent Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several Parts.\n(C 2.28–9; see also 2.285)  \nStolnitz takes these passages to show that for Shaftesbury\n“Aesthetic response is ‘immediate,’ in the sense\nthat it takes place without discursive reflection” (Stolnitz\n1961b: 198; see also 1961a: 112). In other passages, however,\nShaftesbury emphasizes the need for extensive cultivation and\nreflection in order to pass accurate aesthetic judgment.  \nTaste or Judgment … can hardly\ncome ready form’d with us into the World… Use, Practice\nand Culture must precede the Understanding and Wit\nof such an advanc’d Size and Growth as this. A legitimate and\njust Taste can neither be begotten, made,\nconceiv’d, or produc’d, without the antecedent\nLabour and Pains of Criticism.\n(C 3.164)  \nShaftesbury goes on to offer an extensive defense of critics,\nmaintaining that the kind of discursive attention they give to art is\nnecessary for artistic improvement and full appreciation (C\n3.165–9). Such passages have led other commentators to conclude\nthat correct aesthetic taste for Shaftesbury requires well-cultivated\nreflective, discursive abilities (Rivers 2000a: 126–9; Darwall\n1995: 186; Townsend 1982: 210–12). \nShaftesbury clearly distinguishes between a person’s\nappreciating the beauty of an object and a person’s appreciating\nthe benefits an object can produce for him or herself. He writes, for\ninstance, of the obvious difference between the enjoyment of the\nbeauty of an ocean or landscape, on the one hand, and the desire to\ncommand these things and gain advantage from them, on the other (C\n2.396–7). He also contends that the pleasure we experience when\ncoming to appreciate beauty is  \nof a kind which relates not in the least to any private\nInterest…, nor has for its Object any Self-good or Advantage of\nthe private System. The Admiration, Joy, or Love, turns wholly upon\nwhat is exterior, and foreign to our-selves. (C 2.104)  \nA person who is truly responding to beauty does not consider the\ndesirable consequences that may be associated with a beautiful object\nbut rather responds favorably to the object “for its own\nsake” (C 2.59), based purely on “the Excellence of the\nObject” (C 2.273). Such a person’s response is not\nsensitive to external circumstances but results merely from\n“seeing and admiring” (C 2.43). \nOn the basis of these passages, Stolnitz argues that Shaftesbury lays\nthe groundwork for the idea that aesthetic responses are essentially\n“disinterested” (Stolnitz 1961a,b,c; see also Glauser 2002\nand Savile 2002.) According to this idea, which Stolnitz takes to be\nthe defining feature of modern aesthetic theory, an aesthetic response\nis a response solely to the intrinsic features of an object,\nindependent of any other type of consideration, such as the\nobject’s utility to the perceiver or to society, its moral\nvalue, or its capacity to increase knowledge. Aesthetics, on this\nview, is autonomous, self-contained, impersonal, non-instrumental.\nStolnitz is careful (in a way that some of his critics have failed to\nnote) not to claim that Shaftesbury himself held exactly this\naesthetic view. What Stolnitz claims, rather, is that\nShaftesbury’s distinguishing of perceptions of beauty and\njudgments of self-interest was a crucial influence on the\ndisinterested aesthetic views that would come later, even if\nShaftesbury himself also held views that did not fit with those later\nviews (Stolnitz 1961a: 100 and 108). \nTownsend, Rind, and Mortensen have argued against the view that\nShaftesbury advances the notion of aesthetic disinterestedness. On\ntheir view, Shaftesbury intends to contrast an appreciation of an\nobject’s beauty only with certain vicious or selfish concerns,\nnot with all non-aesthetic considerations whatsoever. An appreciation\nof beauty, on this reading of Shaftesbury, is “not to be\nidentified with luxury, covetousness, avarice, ostentation, and\nsimilar … immoral qualities” (Mortensen 1994: 637; see\nalso Rind 2002: 72–3). But an appreciation of beauty can and\nshould involve consideration of virtue and the improvement of moral\ncharacter. As Townsend puts it, Shaftesbury does not ever truly give\n \ndisinterestedness a special significance. It is not really proposed as\nany kind of test, nor does it characterize a special class of\nperceptions or judgments. It is much more important to Shaftesbury to\ndetermine what our true interests are. (Townsend 1982: 211)  \nMortensen argues that Shaftesbury’s central concern with regard\nto art was to show that contemplation of art serves a proper moral\npurpose. According to Mortensen, Shaftesbury’s goal is to\nestablish that proper artistic contemplation improves one’s\nmoral character.  \nWhatever the best interpretation may be of Shaftesbury’s view of\naesthetic responses, Mortensen does marshal plentiful evidence that\none of Shaftesbury’s chief goals was to advance a concept of\ngood “taste” that would improve the moral character of\nBritish gentlemen. Klein (1994) expands on this idea, showing how\nShaftesbury sought to develop the concepts of taste, manners, and\npoliteness in such a way as to provide a moral foundation for British\nlife that would supplant the outdated and unsatisfactory institutional\nsupports of church and court. Den Uyl (1998) also explicates\nShaftesbury view of the moralizing effects of the perception of\nbeauty, pointing to Shaftesbury’s claims that  \nto be a Virtuoso … is a higher step towards the\nbecoming a Man of Virtue and good Sense, than the being what in his\nAge we call a Scholar (C 1.333)  \nand  \nThus are the Arts and Virtues mutually Friends; and\nthus the Science of Virtuoso’s and that of\nVirtue it-self, become, in a manner, one and the same. (C\n1.338) \nThe overriding feature of Shaftesbury’s political thinking is\nthe importance of “Liberty in\ngeneral” (C 3.314). In a letter, he said that “the Triumph\nof Liberty” is “the hinge and Bottom of all three [volumes\nof Characteristicks] and of the whole Work it self” (to\nThomas Micklethwaite, November 24, 1711; see Klein 1994: 124). He\nopposes absolutism and tyranny in all forms, arguing vociferously for\nfree public discourse and toleration of different religious practices.\nHe tries to show that control by church and court is not\nnecessary—is in fact counterproductive—to the virtue,\nsociability, and politeness of citizens (see Klein 1994: 124–135\nand 195–7; Den Uyl 1998: 310; Carey 2006: 126). Klein and\nMüller have argued that proper attention to Shaftesbury’s\ncommitment to liberty and to the weakening of the control of church\nand court reveals that Characteristicks is fundamentally a\npro-Whig, anti-Tory tract (Klein 1994: 125; Müller 2013 and\n2014a).  \nDen Uyl argues that Shaftesbury does not think the state can or should\nactively promote virtue (Den Uyl 1998: 310–315). Schneewind\nmakes a similar point when he writes, “The virtuous agent is not\ncreated by the political structure he inhabits. He brings his\ncharacter to it” (Schneewind 1998: 309; see also 295–8,\n307–9). The best political course, consequently, is for the\nstate to allow as much liberty as possible, because that is most\nlikely to give individuals their own opportunity to fashion morally\nbeautiful characters. Political liberty creates the conditions for\nvirtue, even if politics cannot promote virtue itself. (For possibly\ncountervailing evidence see 2.36–7, where Shaftesbury might be\nsuggesting that proper civic laws can promote virtue).  \nMüller argues that Shaftesbury’s commitment to liberty is\ngrounded in his fundamental moral position that virtue consists not\nmerely of performing certain actions but of acting from the right\nmotives (Müller 2012 and 2013; see 2.12–15, 32, 38). A\nperson who benefits others only because she thinks she will be\nrewarded if she does so, and will be punished if she does not, does\nnot possess virtue. Her beneficence is virtuous only if it is\nmotivated by concern for others, not by selfish considerations\nexternal to others’ welfare. Thus, even if the authorities of\nchurch and court can institute rewards and punishments that may induce\ncertain kinds of behavior, they will have done nothing to promote\nvirtue. \nShaftesbury believes that a free exchange of ideas will produce the\nsame benefits for the intellectual world as a\n“Free-Port” produces for commerce, and he\nmaintains that  \nWit will mend upon our hands and Humour will refine\nit-self; if we take care not to tamper with it, and bring it under\nConstraint. (C 1.64)  \nShaftesbury contends as well that the more liberty there is in a\nsociety, the greater its advancements will be in politeness,\nunderstanding, and the arts. “All Politeness is owing to\nLiberty”, he writes.  \nWe polish one another, and rub off our Corners and rough Sides by a\nsort of amicable Collision. To restrain this, is inevitably\nto bring a Rust upon Mens Understandings. ’Tis a destroying of\nCivility, Good Breeding and even Charity it-self, under pretence of\nmaintaining it. (C 1.64–5)  \nAbout the arts he writes,  \n’Tis easy … to apprehend the Advantages of our Britain\n[over states with less liberty] and what\neffect its establish’d Liberty will produce in every thing which\nrelates to Art. (C 1.219)  \nJustness of Thought and Style, Refinement in Manners, good Breeding,\nand Politeness of every kind, can come only from the Trial and\nExperience of what is best. Let but the Search go freely on, and the\nright Measure of every thing will soon be found. (C 1.10)  \nOn this basis Den Uyl attributes to Shaftesbury a belief in the\nefficacy of a “marketplace of ideas” to “promote\ntruth and the reformation of character” (Den Uyl 1998: 314; see\nalso Darwall 1995: 186). \nThe “Test of Ridicule” is one of the most\nconspicuous elements of Shaftesbury’s belief in the benefits of\nfree speech and other forms of liberty (C 1.11). The state should\nallow the people to engage in public ridicule because it will\nultimately expose the problems in faulty views and leave unscathed the\nstrengths of reasonable views. “I am sure the only way to save\nMens Sense, or preserve Wit at all in the World, is to give Liberty to\nWit” (C 1.19), Shaftesbury writes. For “Truth … may\nbear all Lights” (C 1.61) and “Nothing is\nridiculous except what is deform’d” (C 1.128). Ridicule\nwill reveal the ridiculousness of things that really are ridiculous,\nbut no lasting “Ridicule can lie against Reason” (C 1.11).\nReasonable positions will always be able “to endure a Ridicule\nwrongly plac’d” because while people may be\n“frighted out of their wits”, they will never “be\nlaugh’d out of ‘em” (C 1.96). A prime example of\ntruth and reasonableness being able to withstand ridicule is Socrates,\ntoward whom ridicule was directed but to whom ridicule did not stick\n(C 1.32). The prime example of ridicule undermining what really is\nridiculous is the use of humor and wit to mock fanatical religious\nviews. Indeed, ridicule is the very best way to deal with unhinged\nreligious fanatics. For while governmental restriction on those\nenraptured by “superstition and enthusiasm” is likely only\nto inflame their ardor, witty ridicule (especially in the form of\npuppet shows) will work to deprive such views of the opposition they\nneed to thrive, inevitably leading to their withering in the face of\nthe reasonable and sober (C 1.18). \nShaftesbury does not, however, propose unlimited free speech. While he\nis in favor of a good-humored ridicule, he also thinks there is a\nvicious kind of ridicule that does not serve the purposes of\ntruth—although it is not always clear what principled\ndistinction he draws between the two (Müller 2013 and Chaves\n2008). Even for speech he takes to be a legitimate contribution to\nworthwhile discourse it is not clear how expansive a realm of freedom\nShaftesbury has in mind. Sometimes he suggests that completely free\ndiscussion is appropriate only within a club for elites, and not amid\nthe hurly-burly of the hoi polloi. As he writes in Wit and\nHumour,  \nFor you are to remember (my Friend!) that I am writing to you in\ndefence only of the Liberty of the Club, and of that sort of\nFreedom which is taken amongst Gentlemen and\nFriends, who know one another perfectly well. And that\n’tis natural for me to defend Liberty with this restriction, you\nmay infer from the very Notion I have of Liberty it-self. (C 1.75)\n \n(For discussion of Shaftesbury’s view of the “club”\nand the public, see Carey 2006: 128 and Chaves 2008: 54.) \nShaftesbury’s commitment to liberty extends to toleration of\nreligious difference (see Carey 2006: 144–5 and Klein 1994:\n137). His reasons for this are consonant with his reasons for thinking\nthe best the state can do with regard to personal morality is create\nthe conditions for people to achieve virtue on their own. Just as it\nis impossible to force people to virtue because virtue essentially\ninvolves acting from reasons other than external reward and\npunishment, so too is it impossible to force people to true religious\ndevotion because true religious devotion essentially involves an\ninward feeling of love—“the disinterested Love of\nGod” (C 2. 271), the “love of\nGod for his own sake” (C\n2.58)—and not merely the kind of external behavior that can be\nenforced. Forcing people to love God is no more possible than forcing\nsomeone to romantically love another person (C 1.17–19). In\nfact, attempts to force religious uniformity—“a hopeful\nProject” Shaftesbury sarcastically calls it—are bound to\nfailure, likely resulting only in in the further corruption of\npeople’s characters (C 1.19).  \nBut a new sort of Policy, which extends it-self to another World, and\nconsiders the future Lives and Happiness of Men rather than the\npresent, has made us leap the Bounds of natural Humanity; and out of a\nsupernatural Charity, has taught us the way of plaguing one another\nmost devoutly. It has rais’d an Antipathy which no temporal\nInterest cou’d ever do; and entail’d upon us a mutual\nHatred to all Eternity. (C 1.17)  \nRestrictions on religious practices are likely to be as\ncounterproductive as attempts to enforce virtue. Shaftesbury is not,\nhowever, opposed to state-established religion. “People\nshou’d have a Publick Leading in Religion”, he\nwrites.  \nFor to deny the Magistrate a Worship, or take away a National Church,\nis as mere Enthusiasm as the Notion which sets up Persecution. For why\nshou’d there not be publick Walks, as well as private Gardens?\n(C 1.17)  \nShaftesbury rejects Hobbesian social contract theory. He argues that\nthe selfish beings Hobbes described in his state of nature bear no\nresemblance to humans as they actually are. Humans are naturally\nsociable. Society is humankind’s natural condition.  \nIn short, if Generation be natural, if natural Affection and\nthe Care and Nurture of the Offspring be natural, Things\nstanding as they do with Man, and the Creature being of that Form and\nConstitution he now is; it follows, “That Society must be also\nnatural to him; And “That out of Society and Community he never did, nor ever can subsist”. (C 2.318–19)  \nAccording to\nShaftesbury, there is a contradiction between Hobbes’s\ndescription of an amoral state of nature and his claim to establish a\nduty to obey the laws of society. If there had been no duty to keep\none’s promises in the state of nature, then the original\ncontract could not have created a duty. And if the original contract\ndid create such a duty, then there must have been a duty to keep\none’s promises even in the state of nature (C 1.103–11,\n1.72–76, 2.310–321). \nShaftesbury resists Locke’s attack on innate ideas, particularly\nas it applies to morality. Shaftesbury maintains that the “main\nscope and principal end” of Characteristicks is\n“to assert the Reality of a Beauty and\nCharm in moral as well as\nnatural Subjects” (C 3.303), and he believes that\nLocke’s rejection of innate ideas undermines that moral reality\n(see Carey 2006: 98–99). Locke’s rejection of innate\nideas, as Shaftesbury sees it, implies that our moral ideas must be\nnothing but the result of custom and instruction, and that they are\ntherefore relative to the contingent events of each person’s own\nsociety and upbringing. But morality, if it exists, must be based in a\nuniform nature. Morality is natural or it is nothing at all. And\nLocke’s rejection of innate ideas implies that morality is not\nnatural. \nBecause the word ‘innate’ is ambiguous and controversial,\nShaftesbury chooses to affirm the naturalness of morality in other\nterms (C 2.411–12). “Implanted” is a word he uses\noften, contending that a “sense of Right and Wrong” (C\n2.60), a “Principle of Virtue” (C 2.38), and\n“original ideas of goodness” (C 1.33) are\nimplanted in every human. He also speaks of our\n“Pre-conceptions, or Pre-sensations” of morality, which\nare ideas, principles, and affections that possess moral content but\ndo not originate in experience (C 2.412–3; see also 2.307;\n2.25–6). Another word he uses to express his opposition to\nLocke’s anti-nativism is ‘anticipation,’ as when he\nwrites,  \n[W]e cannot resist our natural Anticipation in behalf of Nature;\naccording to whose suppos’d\nStandard we perpetually approve and disapprove, and to whom\nin all natural Appearances, all moral Actions (whatever we\ncontemplate, whatever we have in debate) we inevitably appeal. (C\n3.214; see also 2.45, 2.412; 2.420; 3.214)  \nHis point here is that we base our moral judgments on a standard that\nwe recognize prior to (or in anticipation of) any of our particular\nexperiences. Similarly, he says that we have a\n“Prepossession of the Mind, in favour of this moral\nDistinction” (C 2.44). The distinction that is important to\nShaftesbury is between aspects of human life that are based in\ninstincts or natural tendencies, and aspects that result from\nartifice, culture, and instruction (C 2.411). Shaftesbury’s main\ncontention is that many morally significant aspects of human life fall\nin into the first category rather than the second. We naturally care\nfor children. We naturally seek company and prefer sociability to\nsolitariness. We naturally form groups bound by “Love of a\ncommon City, Community, or Country” (C 2.308–9). We\nnaturally find some types of conduct beautiful and virtuous, and\nothers not so. \nBut while Shaftesbury claims that all humans naturally (or\ninstinctively) possess (or are imprinted with) a sense of right and\nwrong (a principle of virtue, original ideas of goodness), he also\nbelieves that a great deal of cultivation and refinement is necessary\nin order to develop correct and proper judgment (C 1.190–1).\nVirtue and good taste may be natural, but it turns out that a proper\neducation is needed for most people to achieve them. How can\nShaftesbury both insist on the naturalness of morality and beauty, and\ncontend for the need of intensive critical moral and aesthetic\nreflection? Carey has argued that Shaftesbury believes this apparent\nproblem can be dissolved by the Stoic concept of prolepsis\n(Carey 2006: 110–116). Prolepses are notions that do “not\ndepend on or derive from instruction or experience” (Carey 2006:\n112). But prolepses are merely mental anticipations, not fully formed\nconcepts—they are pre–conceptions—and as\nsuch they can be poorly developed and misapplied. To give prolepses\ntheir most complete form and to apply them properly, practice and\ncultivation are necessary. Shaftesbury can thus hold that ethics\nrequires the “right application of the Affections” (C\n2.35), and he can attribute mistaken ethical judgments to a\n“Defect in the application of that unavoidable\nImpression and first natural Rule of Honesty and\nWorth” (C 3.303–4). \nCentral to Shaftesbury’s religious views is a rejection of the\nvoluntarist claim that morality is determined by divine will. If\nGod’s will determined morality, Shaftesbury argues, it would be\nmeaningless to praise God for being moral.  \nFor whoever thinks there is a God, and\npretends formally to believe that he is just and\ngood, must suppose that there is independently such a thing\nas Justice and Injustice, Truth and\nFalshood, Right and Wrong; according to\nwhich he pronounces that God is just, righteous, and\ntrue. (C 2.49–50)  \nAnyone who believes it is meaningful to love God because of\nGod’s virtue must believe that morality is prior to God’s\nwill. \nAgainst the voluntarists, Shaftesbury maintains that morality is\n“eternal” and “immutable” (C 2.36), and that\nGod’s will is determined by it. As Theocles (of The\nMoralists) says of the position advanced by the author of the\nInquiry,  \n[I]n respect of Virtue, what you lately\ncall’d a Realist; he endeavours to shew, “That it\nis really something in it-self, and in the nature of Things:\nnot arbitrary or factitious, (if I may so speak) not\nconstituted from without, or dependent on Custom,\nFancy, or Will; not even on the Supreme\nWill it-self, which can no-way govern it: but being\nnecessarily good, is govern’d by it, and ever uniform\nwith it”. (C 2.267)  \nThere are certain things we know to be necessarily true, such as that\na contradiction cannot hold and that it must be wrong to punish one\nperson for a different person’s wrongdoing. But voluntarism has\nthe contrary—and thus absurd—implications.  \nIf the mere Will, Decree, or Law of God be\nsaid absolutely to constitute Right and Wrong, then\nare these latter words of no significancy at all. For thus if each\npart of a Contradiction were affirm’d for Truth by the supreme\nPower, they wou’d consequently become true. Thus if one\nPerson were decreed to suffer for another’s fault, the Sentence\nwou’d be just and equitable. And thus, in the\nsame manner, if arbitrarily, and without reason, some Beings were\ndestin’d to endure perpetual Ill, and others as constantly to\nenjoy Good; this also wou’d pass under the same Denomination.\nBut to say of any thing that it is just or unjust,\non such a foundation as this, is to say nothing, or to speak without a\nmeaning (C 2.50)  \nEvident here is Shaftesbury’s belief that our certainty about\nsome things (including our certainty that the conduct supralapsarian\nCalvinists attribute to God is wrong) is sufficient basis for the\nrejection of all theologies that place God’s will prior to\nmorality. In passages such as this, Shaftesbury manifests a profound\naffinity (if not identity) with the Cambridge Platonists (see Cassirer\n1953: 159–202; Rivers 2000a: 88; Gill 2006: 12–29 and\n77–82). \nShaftesbury also argues that belief in voluntarism has significantly\ndeleterious moral effects. If you believe certain actions are wrong\nonly because God arbitrarily commands you not to perform them, then\nyour overwhelming reason for not performing those actions will be the\nself-interested desire to avoid God’s punishment. But if that\nself-interested desire becomes your overwhelming motivation, it will\ncrowd out and eventually destroy the other-loving motives that are\nessential to your own virtue and happiness (C 2.55–6,\n2.58–9; see also 1.97, 2.48–50, 2.267). \nShaftesbury’s own position on religious belief has negative and\npositive aspects. The negative aspect is opposition to belief based on\nrevelation. The positive aspect is affirmation of a perfectly good God\nbased on observation of the natural order.  \nShaftesbury argues against reliance on revelation in the form of\nmiracles, of scripture, and of (certain types of) enthusiastic\nexperiences. \nShaftesbury holds that the occurrence of miracles would contradict\nrather than support proper theological belief. The essential feature\nof the observable world on which proper theological belief is based is\nits order, the operation of myriad different systems\naccording to elegant and harmonious natural laws. But a miracle is an\noccurrence that violates that order, something defined as a\ncontradiction of natural law. As such, a miracle would undermine\nbelief in a Creator who works by “just and uniform” laws\n(C 2.334). A miracle would evince not a single great and good God but\n“either the Chaos and Atoms of the Atheists,\nor the Magick and\nDaemons of the Polytheists” (C\n2.335–6). As Theocles says in The Moralists to a\ncharacter who has made a plea for miracles:  \nFor whilst you are labouring to unhinge Nature; whilst you are\nsearching Heaven and Earth for Prodigys, and studying how to\nmiraculize every thing; you bring Confusion on the World, you\nbreak its Uniformity, and destroy that admirable Simplicity of Order,\nfrom whence the One infinite and perfect\nPrinciple is known. (C 2.335)  \nEven if a miracle could establish the existence of a being with\nunusual power, it would not prove that such a being had the qualities\nof perfect goodness we should rightly attribute to God.  \nFor what tho innumerable Miracles from every part\nassail’d the Sense, and gave the trembling Soul no respite? What\ntho the Sky shou’d suddenly open, and all kinds of Prodigys\nappear, Voices be heard, or Characters read? What wou’d this\nevince more than “That there were certain Powers\ncou’d do all this?” But\n“What Powers; Whether\nOne, or more; Whether Superior, or\nSubaltern; Mortal, or Immortal;\nWise, or Foolish; Just, or Unjust;\nGood, or Bad”: this wou’d still remain a\nMystery; as wou’d the true Intention, the Infallibility or\nCertainty of whatever these Powers\nasserted (C 2.334)  \nBelief in beings with unusual powers is not the same thing as true\ntheism, which is belief in a perfectly good—perfectly\norderly—God (C 2.6). \nShaftesbury raises multiple objections to religious views that claim\nto be based solely on the revealed word of scripture. It is claimed\nthat those who write scripture are divinely inspired. But even if they\nare divinely inspired, they must still write in human language. And\nthe translation from divine inspiration to human language opens up\nspace for interpretation and criticism.  \n’Tis indeed no small Absurdity, to assert a Work or Treatise,\nwritten in human Language, to be above human\nCriticism, or Censure. For if the Art of Writing be from\nthe grammatical Rules of human Invention and Determination; if even\nthese Rules are form’d on casual Practice and various Use: there\ncan be no Scripture but what must of necessity be subject to\nthe Reader’s narrow Scrutiny and strict Judgment; unless a\nLanguage and Grammar, different from any of human Structure, were\ndeliver’d down from Heaven, and miraculously accommodated to\nhuman Service and Capacity. (C 3.229)  \nAt least as problematic for the claim to base religion entirely on\nscripture is the great diversity of texts for which claims of divine\ninspiration have been made. There have been many different versions of\nthe scriptural stories through the centuries. And human\ndecisions—decisions that can be examined, explained, critiqued,\nquestioned—have led to some texts being deemed canonical,\ncomplete, and perfect and others apocryphal, partial, inaccurate. As\nCarey puts Shaftesbury’s point,  \nHow can we establish the text itself, distinguishing the apocryphal\nfrom the canonical corpus of writings, given the range of manuscripts,\ntranscripts, copies, and textual traditions associated with different\nsects, each of which adopts an alternative version when it comes to\npower? (Carey 2006: 144)  \nEven if we can all agree on one text, moreover, we must still apply it\nto our own lives in order to determine how to live according to its\nteachings. And such application once again opens up a space that can\nbe filled only by interpretation. Perhaps we will accept one\nperson’s interpretation above all others, but then we are basing\nour religion on that person’s judgment and not on scripture\nalone.  \nIf we follow any One Translation, or\nany One Man’s Commentary, what\nRule or Direction shall we have, by which to chuse that One\naright? (C 3.324)  \nShaftesbury’s point is not that scripture should be ignored. It\nis that any use anyone ever makes of scripture will necessarily\ninvolve “his own Discernment, and\nUnderstanding”—either one’s own judgment of which\ntext to privilege and how best to interpret it, or one’s own\njudgment that somebody else’s judgment about those things is\nbest (C 3.72). Shaftesbury maintains, as well, that the best\ninterpretations will be those that are deeply informed by\nextra-scriptural knowledge of the history, tradition, and\nlanguage—“collateral Testimony of other antient Records,\nHistorians, and foreign Authors”—of the times in which\nscriptural texts were first composed and complied (C 3.236). To truly\nunderstand scripture, we must approach it the way we would approach\nany other ancient text. The result will be  \na nicely critical Historical Faith, subject to various\nSpeculations, and a thousand different Criticisms of\nLanguages and Literature. (C 3.72)  \nSuch criticism, far from undermining respect for the word of God, is\n“necessary to the Preservation and Purity of Scripture” (C\n3.316). \nShaftesbury also opposes religion that purports to be based entirely\non direct revelation of an enthusiastic experience. Enthusiasts (or,\nrather, the kinds of enthusiasts Shaftesbury opposes; see below) are\nthose who base their religious views on what they claim to be their\nimmediate spiritual experiences of God. Such experiences are\npassionate, emotional, non-rational. And while Shaftesbury does not\ndeny that true contemplation of the divine has an emotional component,\nhe argues that we cannot determine merely from the character of a\npassionate experience itself whether it is the result of divine\ninspiration or human distemper. A single individual in a cave can make\nnoises that, because of echoing and darkness, cause a group of people\nto feel great fear and thus give them to believe they are under threat\nfrom a huge gang of monsters. Their feeling of fear—their\npanic—is certainly real, but that feeling does not on its own\nconstitute proof of the belief about what caused it. In the same way,\na group of people can experience some powerful emotion that they\nattribute to the experience of God, but the power of the emotion\nitself is no proof of the divine cause. For  \nthere are many Panicks in Mankind, besides merely that of\nFear. And thus is Religion also Panick; when Enthusiasm of\nany kind gets up. (C 1.16)  \nShaftesbury thus describes enthusiastic experiences as internal\n“commotions” that may be one of  \nthose Delusions which come arm’d with the specious Pretext of\nmoral Certainty, and Matter of Fact. (C 1.44)  \nEnthusiasm is wonderfully powerful and\nextensive … [and] … it is a matter of nice Judgment, and\nthe hardest thing in the world to know fully and distinctly…\nNor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward Marks, be easily\ndistinguish’d from it. For Inspiration is a real\nfeeling of the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm a false one.\nBut the Passion they raise is much alike. (C 1.52–53)  \nScary noises in a dark cave can produce the same feeling of fear,\nwhether they are caused by many monsters or one trickster. The feeling\nitself does not constitute proof that the feeler’s belief about\nthe cause is correct. \nThe central feature of the positive aspect of Shaftesbury’s\nreligion is belief in a perfectly good God based on an argument from\ndesign. (At 2.364–5, he suggests that it is possible to give an\na priori argument for the existence of God as well). Proper attention\nto the magnificent order of natural phenomena, Shaftesbury argues,\nleads inevitably to the conclusion that the world was created by a\nperfect being. If we found a perfectly designed piece of architecture\non a desert island, we would conclude that a mind had formed it even\nif we could see no intelligent being in the area. Just so, Shaftesbury\nargues, we must conclude that a mind has formed the world as a whole,\neven though such a mind is not present to our senses. Shaftesbury\ndevelops this argument most fully in The Moralists, in which\nTheocles convinces Philocles that perfect theism follows from an\nunderstanding of nature as a whole (C 2.284–5, 2.340–393).\nEverything is “fitted and join’d” together, Theocles\ncontends, each contributing to the “Order, Union, and Coherence\nof the Whole” (C 2.287). “All we can see either\nof the Heavens or Earth, demonstrates Order and Perfection” (C\n2.291). “All things in this world are united” in\na “universal system” (C 2.287). And  \nhaving recogniz’d this uniform consistent fabric, and\nown’d the Universal System, we must of consequence\nacknowledg a universal Mind. (C 2.290)  \nShaftesbury contends that such considerations—the argument from\ndesign—constitute a rational basis for theism. They provide\n“abundant Proof, capable of convincing any fair and just\nContemplator” (C 2.288). \nShaftesbury also insists, however, that essential to true religion is\na passionate love for the Divine and its creation. Shaftesbury’s\nreligion consists not merely of a calm belief in a creator-God but\nalso of a passionate “Admiration” of the\nworld’s “Majesty or Graudure”, of\nsomething that “captivates the Heart” (C 3.31–2).\nIndeed, in what may seem like a surprising twist, Shaftesbury says\nthat in fact the truly religious frame of mind, because it reaches\nbeyond calm understanding, is a kind of enthusiasm. The writer of\nA Letter concerning Enthusiasm, after ridiculing enthusiasts\nthroughout, eventually claims to have “justify’d Enthusiasm,\nand own’d the Word” and\nsigns off as “your Enthusiastick Friend” (C 1.55;\nsee also 2.206–10, 368–376, 218–9, 124, 220, 394;\n3.22, 33). It seems that Shaftesbury wants to develop a religious view\nthat is neither entirely passionate (like the fanatics he ridicules in\nA Letter) nor entirely rational (like the Deists he was\nsometimes associated with). This raises the question of how the\npassionate and rational elements of Shaftesbury’s religion fit\ntogether. Müller and Grean offer two different answers. \nMüller argues that for Shaftesbury the passionate element is\nnecessary because rationality cannot fully establish the existence of\na perfectly good God. Reason alone cannot get us all the way to\nperfect theism. The extra distance can be traversed only by an\nemotional aesthetic response to the beauty of creation. Müller\nwrites,  \nIn contemplating the beauty of nature, fancy transcends the limits of\nthe human mind and ascends into the infinite, imagining the harmonious\nconcatenation of causes. Theocles’ sublime meditations do not\nattempt to produce logically sound arguments; they are allegorical\nverbal paintings of the deity’s creation. The order of the\ndivine cosmos, its inherent goodness, does not lend itself to strict\nphilosophical investigation so that its “Mysterious\nBeauty” (C 2.393) cannot be rationally understood by\nhuman beings. (Müller 2010: 224)  \nThere are “secret truths of divine creation” that we can\nappreciate only through non-rational means (Müller 2010: 224).\nMüller argues for this interpretation through an account of\nShaftesbury’s theodicy, i.e., his response to the seeming evils\nin a world supposedly created by a perfectly good, omnipotent God.\nAccording to Müller, Shaftesbury contends that belief in such a\nGod implies that no real evil can truly exists. All evil is merely\napparent. Everything in the world is actually entirely good. But this\nposition cannot be established rationally. Indeed, according to\nMüller, this position is “anti-rational” (Müller\n2010: 227). We can only come to accept it through an emotional\naesthetic response—an imaginative “Conceit of something\nmajestick” (C 3.30), an “Extasy” (C\n1.36)—to the beauty of the world. \nGrean’s reading, in contrast, takes Shaftesbury to advance a\nmore thoroughly rational basis for perfect theism (Grean 1967:\n19–36). On Grean’s interpretation, an enthusiastic passion\nis “fair and plausible” only if it is tethered to a\nthoroughly rational theological understanding, not if it goes beyond\nsuch an understanding. Such a reading emphasizes statements such as\nthe following from Philocles:  \nNor cou’d God witness for himself, or assert his Being\nany other way to Men, than “By revealing himself to their\nReason, appealing to their Judgment, and submitting\nhis Ways to their Censure, and cool\nDeliberation” (C 2.333).  \nTheocles also seems to eschew the need for any non-rational means to\ntheism when he says that observation provides “abundant Proof,\ncapable of convincing any fair and just Contemplator, of the Works of\nNature” (C 2.288). In addition, Shaftesbury condemns the idea\nthat a person should ever believe anything not supported by “an\nimpartial Use of his Reason” or that is “too hard for his\nUnderstanding” (C 1.35). Contemplation of the order of things is\n“the only means which cou’d establish the sound\nBelief of a Deity” (C 2.333). Without fully rational\nbelief, “Theology must have no Foundation at all” (C\n2.269). \nShaftesbury does believe that true theism involves an emotional\nresponse—that a truly religious frame of mind includes something\nmore than simply a calm, rational belief in Deity (at which the Deists\nmight have been satisfied to stop). But on Grean’s\ninterpretation, that additional emotional element is added to rational\nbelief, not something that is needed to carry us to a belief that\nreason alone cannot reach. The model for this kind of emotional\nelement is the profound aesthetic pleasure that a mathematician may\nexperience upon coming to understand an elegant proof, or that a\nbiologist may experience upon coming to understand the perfect\norganization of a complex set of features of an organism or ecosystem\n(C 2.17 and 2.43). The profound aesthetic pleasure of the\nmathematician and the biologist does not go beyond understanding but,\nrather, is entirely posterior to, or dependent upon it (C\n2.374–5). \nIt is true—as Müller points out in his discussion of\ntheodicy—that Shaftesbury thinks there are certain things that\nappear to us to be bad or evil, things that we cannot understand how\nto reconcile with a perfectly good and all-powerful God. But there is\nin Shaftesbury at least the suggestion of a rational argument for the\nconclusion that even those things are actually for the best (C\n2.288–92, 2.363–5). There are numerous features of the\nworld whose purpose we have not initially understood. Over time,\nhowever, we have come to see the purpose that many of those things\nserve, achieving a rational realization that what had initially seemed\nbad or evil is in actuality entirely to the good. But since we have\nhad so many of these experiences in the past—of initially not\nunderstanding a thing and its appearing to us to be bad or evil, and\nof then coming to understand it and realizing that it is in fact\ngood—it is reasonable to conclude that those things we currently\ndo not understand and that appear to us as evil are also actually for\nthe best. Imagine you know a very brilliant person. In the past she\nhas done things you initially did not understand the rationale for at\nall. But in time you eventually came to see that those things were\nperfectly planned and executed, and you now realize that they were\nexactly the right things to have done (even if you hadn’t been\nable to see that initially). Now imagine that this person does\nsomething in the present that you do not understand the rationale for.\nYour past experience gives you reasonable grounds for trusting that in\nfact she has perfect justification for what she is doing—that\nher actions really are for the best, even if you currently cannot see\nthe reasons for them. Given the finiteness of our minds and the\ninfiniteness of God’s, it is only to be expected that God acts\nin certain ways we cannot understand. But in the past we have had so\nmany experiences of examining natural objects we initially did not\nunderstand and coming to see the harmonious workings of all their\nwondrous mechanisms, it is reasonable to believe that those things we\ncurrently do not understand are in fact for the best. As Shaftesbury\nputs it,  \nNow, in this mighty Union, if there be such\nRelations of Parts one to another as are not easily discover’d;\nif on this account the End and Use of Things does not every-where\nappear, there is no wonder; since ’tis no more indeed than what\nmust happen of necessity: Nor cou’d supreme Wisdom have\notherwise order’d it. For in an Infinity of Things thus\nrelative, a Mind which sees not infinitely, can see nothing\nfully. (C 2.288) \nLet us now turn to another significant feature of Shaftesbury’s\nreligious views, which is his position on the relationship between\nvirtue and belief in God. This is the topic with which Shaftesbury\nbegins the Inquiry, telling us that his goal is  \nto inquire what Honesty or Virtue is,\nconsider’d by it-self; and in what manner it is influenc’d\nby Religion: how far Religion necessarily implies\nVirtue; and whether it be a true Saying, That ‘it\nis impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous, or share any real degree\nof Honesty, or Merit. (C 2.7)  \nIt is in the context of addressing this question that Shaftesbury\ndevelops his ideas of the moral sense—i.e., his view that within\nevery human is the means to understand morality and act in accord with\nit—and the conclusion he draws from this is that one’s\ncapacity to realize virtue is independent of one’s religious\nbelief. Our moral sense naturally leads us to virtue (C 2.16–18\nand 25–6), and atheism does nothing at all to damage that\nnatural tendency (C 2.27). Shaftesbury thus denies “that it\nis impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous,” contending\ninstead that some  \nwho have paid little regard to Religion, and been consider’d as\nmere Atheists, have yet been observ’d to\npractice the Rules of Morality, and act in many Cases with\nsuch good Meaning and Affection towards Mankind, as might seem to\nforce an Acknowledgment of their being virtuous (C 2.4)  \nRivers has suggested that establishing the independence of religion\nand morality is one the most important aspects of, and perhaps the\nprimary motivation for, Shaftesbury’s development of the moral\nsense (Rivers 2000a).  \nShaftesbury does believe, however, that religious belief can affect\none’s moral sense and one’s motivation to be moral. Belief\nin a perfectly good God promotes virtue in a number of ways. For  \nnothing can more highly contribute to the fixing of right\nApprehensions, and a sound Judgment of Sense of Right and Wrong, than\nto believe a God who is ever, and on all accounts, represented such as\nto be actually a true Model and Example of the most exact Justice, and\nhighest Goodness and Worth. (C 2.51)  \nAnd when God is represented as having  \na Concern for the good of All, and an Affection of\nBenevolence and Love towards the Whole; such an Example must\nundoubtedly serve (…) to raise and increase the Affection\ntowards Virtue. (C 2.56)  \nShaftesbury also says that belief in a perfect God increases\none’s motivation to be moral because one will have a strong wish\nto please the Supreme Being and because one will be better able to\nwithstand misfortune and hardship, which are important respects in\nwhich theism conduces to virtue in a way atheism does not (C\n2.56–77). In contrast, belief in an immoral God, which\nShaftesbury calls ‘daemonism,’ will have deleterious\neffects, promoting vice at the expense of virtue. For religious zeal\nbased on belief in a capricious and violent god will promote cruelty\nand barbarity (C 2.13; 2.35–6; 2.47–49).  \n[W]here a real Devotion and hearty Worship is paid to a supreme Being,\nwho in his History or Character is represented otherwise than as\nreally and truly just and good; there must ensure a Loss of Rectitude,\na Disturbance of Thought, and a Corruption of Temper and manners the\nBeliever. His Honesty will, of necessity, be supplanted by his Zeal,\nwhilst he is thus unnaturally influenc’d, and render’d\nthus immorally devout. (C 2.50–51)  \n“Religion”, Shaftesbury concludes,\n“is capable of doing great Good, or Harm” to one’s\nmoral character, while atheism does not have an effect “in\neither way” (C 2.51).","contact.mail":"mgill@ed.ac.uk","contact.domain":"ed.ac.uk"}]
