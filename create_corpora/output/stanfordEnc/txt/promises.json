It is in part this fixed\nplace in our intuitive judgments that makes promises of particular\ninterest to philosophers, as well as a host of social scientists and\nother theorists. Promises are of special interest to ethical theorists,\nas they are generally taken to impose moral obligations. Thus an\nexplanation of how such promissory obligations come about and how they\nfunction is necessary for a complete moral theory.\n\n\n\nAnother feature of promises that make them a topic of philosophical\nconcern is their role in producing trust, and by so doing facilitating\nsocial coordination and cooperation. For this reason promises and\nrelated phenomena, such as vows, oaths, pledges, contracts, treaties\nand agreements more generally are important elements of justice and the\nlaw, and, at least in the Social Contract tradition, of the political\norder as well.\n\n\n\nThe philosophical work on these topics is body of literature that\nspans the ages. Although promising as a phenomenon is rarely the sole\nsubject of a major work, it is quite often a subject treated by\nimportant authors, and many major figures have written on it. \nFrom Aristotle to Aquinas, from Hobbes to Hume, from Kant to Mill, from\nRoss to Rawls to Scanlon, an explanation of the promissory obligation\nhas been a live question.\n\n\n\nWhile the bulk of the corpus is in ethical and political theory and\nthe related fields of legal theory and applied ethics, work on promises\nhas also been done in the philosophy of language, action theory,\nrationality theory, game theory and other areas.\n\n\n\nFor ethical theorists the central task is an explanation of promissory\nobligations: How is it that we come to have a moral obligation to do\nwhat we promise we will? The question is particularly difficult\nbecause promissory obligations differ from other sorts of moral\nobligations in a number of ways. Unlike paradigmatic moral duties, the\nduty not to harm for example, promissory obligations are not owed\nequally to everyone, but rather only those we have promised. For this\nreason promissory obligations are often categorized as\n‘special’ obligations, of a piece with the obligations\nowed to family and friends. This feature makes promissory obligations\nespecially problematic for consequentialist theories of\nmorality. (cf. the entry on\n special obligations). \n\nFurther, promissory obligations are voluntary; we don't have\nto make promises, but we must keep them when we do. Moreover,\npromissory obligations aren't just contingent upon acts of the\nwill, like the obligations we might incur by deliberately damaging\nsomeone's property, but (at least it seems on first reflection) they\nare immediately created by acts of the will. When I promise to do\nsomething, it seems that by so doing I have created the\nobligation to do it. This feature makes promissory obligations a\nspecial puzzle for naturalistic ethical theories that hope to explain\nmoral obligations without recourse to super-natural entities. The idea\nthat we simply manufacture promissory obligations by speaking them,\nlike an incantation, is decidedly mysterious. As Hume acidly remarked\nin the Treatise: \n\nThe traditional account of promissory obligation (the one Hume is\nmocking in the quote above) is a Natural Law view, i.e., one derived\nfrom the various traditions that go under that general title, like the\nvirtue views of the ancients, those of the medieval theologians, the\nearly modern rights theorists and beyond. \n\nRepresentative of the ancient view, for Aristotle promise-keeping is\ndirectly mandated by the virtues, in particular, those of honesty and\njustice (as well as liberality in cases of purely gratuitous\npromises): \n\nThe Roman Jurists like Cicero and Gaius developed this sort of view\nfurther, crucially conceiving of a specific moral duty to keep\npromises, and a specific (and for Cicero particularly Roman)\nvirtue of fidelity to promises (cf. Cicero, De Officiis\nI,8) as well as formalizing promissory obligations, by\nreference to a specific procedure called the stipulatio or\nstipulating: \n\nA verbal obligation is created by question and answer in such form as:\n“Do you solemnly promise conveyance? I solemnly promise\nconveyance”; “Will you convey?  I will convey”;\n“Do you promise? I promise”; “Do you promise on your\nhonour?  I promise on my honour”; “Do you guarantee on\nyour honour? I guarantee on my honour”; “Will you do? I\nwill do” (Gaius, Inst. 3:92, cited in Swain 2013). \n\nAnd the tradition is also later enlarged by Scholastic theorists,\nmost importantly Aquinas. (cf. Aquinas, Summa Theologica II, q.88 &\nq.110) Aquinas used Aristotelian assumptions and techniques to expand\nand detail the theory, deriving from the intentions of the promisor and\nthe underpinning virtues a ‘natural law’ governing promise\nkeeping (cf. Gordley 1991: 10ff). \n\nStill later on, important early modern commentators on promising in\nthe Natural Law tradition such as Locke (Two Treatises On\nGovernment, II–II:14) Reid (Essay on the Active Powers of\nMan 2), Grotius (De iure naturae, ii. xi.), Pufendorf\n(De iure naturae et gentium, iii. v. 9), Stair\n(Institutions of the Laws of Scotland, I. X.1) and others\ndeveloped the doctrine in new directions. \n\nFor an excellent overview of these issues, see chapter 1 of James\nGordley's The Philosophical Origins of Modern Contract\nDoctrine (1991).  \n\nThe 17th Century saw the emergence of a new strand of moral\ntheory, one that employed the notion of a mutual agreement or contract\nbetween the members of a community as a device for grounding moral\nprinciples. This ‘social contract’ movement also produced\nnew approaches to promissory theory, but we should preface our\ndiscussion of these by distinguishing between two different types of\nprojects that have historically occupied social contract\ntheorists. \n\nThe first project is an attempt to ground political, legal and other\njustice-based obligations in the prior obligation to honor agreements.\nIn this endeavor, the obligation to honor one's agreements is\nassumed independently of any appeal to the social contract, and the aim\nis to argue that the sorts of political and legal arrangements that\nexist between the citizen and the state are in fact agreements of the\nsort that would invoke the obligation. The figure most immediately\nassociated with this project is Locke, especially in the Two\nTreaties on Government (although there is some dissent to this\nview, cf. Dunn 1984). \n\nThe other project is to make the social contract out to be the\nground of some (or all) moral principles, including (what is salient\nfor our purposes) the principle mandating that we keep our promises\nor agreements. Hobbes' theory is the paradigm here, and he\nhas a radical one—grounding all moral and political principles in the\nsame way. Hume and Rawls (among others) offer social contract theories\nof more limited scope, as grounding the principles of\n‘justice’ alone. Both projects attempt to ground moral\nprinciples in the social contract, but the Lockean one does so by\nappealing to the antecedently given obligation to honor agreements,\nwhile the Hobbesian project attempts to explain the duty of fidelity\nitself, as one of a piece with other moral principles, in terms of the\nsocial contract. It is these latter sorts of social contract theories\nthat are our focus here, since they contain the new approaches to\nexplaining promissory obligation. \n\nOf the latter sort of contract theories, we should further make a\ndistinction between Contractarians and\nContractualists. Contractarians assume that the rules of\nmorality must appeal to the rational self interest of all parties to\nthe contract, and that people will accept them in pursuit of their own\nends. Contractualists claim that the rules of morality are those that\nwould or could be defensible to all others in the bargaining\narrangement. The two sorts of contract theory have two different\nexplanations of promissory obligations. \n\nAnd we should lastly note that there seems to be an obvious\ncircularity worry for contract theorists in their attempts to explain\npromissory obligation—since a contract (or agreement, or pact,\nor covenant, etc.) seems to be just the same sort of thing as a\npromise, or at least it would seem that they are closely enough related\nthat one would be barred from using one of them to\n‘explain’ the other on pain of vacuity. And indeed, an\nobjection of this sort has been made to the Rawlsian contractualist\napproach (see section 3.4 below). \nBut this apparent circularity is\nperhaps deceiving. To see why, we first need to distinguish between\nactual, flesh-and-blood arrangements, in the law or in society more\ngenerally, that we call ‘contracts’, and the theoretical\napparatus that contract theorists use to ground moral principles, which\nis also called (more metaphorically) a ‘contract’.\nIt's obviously viciously circular to ground promissory\nobligations in a contract of the former sort, but not the latter. Of\ncourse, to avoid this sort of circularity, the ‘contract’\ninvoked by contract theorists can't do its work by appealing to\nthe fact that one has an obligation one to keep one's word in an\nagreement. But there are other, non-circular ways to appeal to the idea\nof the contract. Contractarians, for example, appeal to the rationality\n(in some utility-maximization sense of that notion) of obeying the\nterms of the ‘contract’ (i.e., honoring moral principles),\nwhile Contractualists generally appeal to the\n‘reasonableness’ or the ‘fairness’ of the\nprinciples that are manifest in the social contract. Neither approach\nsuffers from the shallow sort of circularity of just described, that of\nassuming the normative force they set out to explain. \n\nContractarians explain promissory obligations in the same manner as\nother moral obligations grounded in the social contract—by\narguing for the rationality (in the utility-maximization sense) of\naccepting the rule that we ought to keep our promises. The argument\nfor the promising rule goes by appeal to the value that the practice\nof promising has for us as members of a society. The chief value of\nthe practice of promising is social coordination and\ncooperation—promises (and cognate phenomena like contracts and\nagreements) allow people to trust one another, which in turn allows\nfor all sorts of cooperative benefits, e.g., divisions of labor,\nsolutions to coordination problems and collective action problems,\nexits from prisoners dilemmas, etc. The theory is first offered by\nHobbes (Leviathan xiii–xv). \n\nHobbes' framework for assessing the rationality of moral rules\nassumes that the over-arching goal is to exit the state of nature into\na civil society. In the Hobbesian state of nature, our expansive\nnatural rights, our over-large appetites and our natural inclination to\ndominate result in constant, irresolvable conflict, what Hobbes called\nthe war of all against all (Lev. xiii: 88–89). Against this\nbackdrop Hobbes claims that practices that allow us to escape this\ncondition are ‘Laws of Nature’, i.e., mandates of rational\nself-interest, and that keeping promises is one of those practices\n(Lev. xv: 100 ff). Hobbes takes promises to be a part of the larger and more\ncomplex system of contract. A contract for Hobbes is a mutual transfer\nof rights in things. A covenant is a contract where one of the parties\nmust perform after the other, and thus promises the first performer his\nlater performance. Hobbes takes covenants to be the ‘fountain and\noriginal of justice’, and the keeping of covenants is a mandate\nof the Law of Nature (Lev. xiv: 100). \n\nHobbes' picture is complicated by the fact that he\ndoesn't think that the appreciation of the fact that\npromise-keeping is valuable is sufficient to guarantee compliance. He\nthinks this because he thinks that people are passionate creatures\nwhose reason is often overwhelmed by those passions, and because he\nconceives of covenants as cases where the promisee puts himself at risk\nby trusting the promisor. Such risk is forbidden by the first law of\nnature (self defense) unless the promisee has some very good reason to\nassume that the promiser won't betray his trust. And since mere\nreason isn't enough (ex hypothesi) to make that\nguarantee, promisees can't trust promisers. As such, Hobbes\nclaims that promises made merely on the grounds of trust are not\npromises at all (cf. Lev. xiv: 96 & xv: 102). Hobbes'\nsolution is to ground promissory obligations not directly in the\nrationality of keeping promises, but rather in the rational fear of the\nsovereign, whose job it is to enforce contracts by punishing renegers.\nIn this way, Hobbes has an indirect justification of promissory\nobligations by appeal to the rationality of promise-keeping:\nRationality mandates the establishment of a sovereign, who will enforce\ncontracts by threat of punishment. The existence of the plausible\nthreat from the sovereign in turn makes promise keeping rational. So\npromises aren't a way to exit the state of nature,\nrather they are a necessary component of civil society made\npossible by the exit from the state of nature by the establishment\nof a sovereign. \n\nContractarian ethical theory underwent a revival in the\n20th Century, with sophisticated version offered by Jan\nNarveson in The Libertarian Idea (1988) and especially by\nDavid Gauthier in his Morals by Agreement (1986). Contemporary\ntheories, like Gauthier's, differ from traditional Hobbesianism\nin significant ways. For example, Gauthier premises the bargaining\nposition not as an escape from the state of nature, but rather as a\nmethod for achieving an acceptable share of the potential cooperative\nsurplus. Also, Gauthier proposes that the bargainers are constrained by\na ‘Lockean’ proviso. The proviso forbids bettering\none's bargaining position by worsening the position of other\nbargainers. The resultant theory is not dependent on the coercive force\nof an absolute political sovereign, and foresees a relatively liberal\nsocial order. But the general thrust of the theory of promissory\nobligations remains the same in the later theory—promising is a\nrational strategy, and thus promise-keeping is a moral obligation. \n\nA traditional problem for the contractarian approach is that it has\ndifficulty accounting for cases where the breaking of an individual\npromise looks like it would produce more utility for the agent than\nkeeping the promise. Intuitively it seems that many cases where\nkeeping a promise would be less than completely advantageous to the\npromiser are still cases where the promiser has an obligation to\nkeep them. Yet if we take it that morality only demands what is\nrational to further our interests, then it seems that the\ncontractarian must say that in such sub-optimal cases, the promiser\nhas no obligation to keep her promise. \n\nHobbes, who derided the rhetorical proponent of this problem as a\nfool, claims that it is never rational to break a promise\n(Lev. xv: 101 ff). Hobbes defends this firstly by\nreminding us that on his view, covenants made outside of the reach of a\ncivil power with the capacity to enforce the contract by punishing the\nparties are not covenants at all, and thus all contracting parties have\nthe reason of the sovereign's potential punishment to keep their\npromise. And even in ‘state-of-war’ cases, promise-keeping\nis always rational because the state of war requires one to band\ntogether with ‘confederates’ for safety, and having a\nreputation as a promise breaker will make such confederacy\nimpossible. \n\nThis leaves only cases where a person feels that they might evade\nthe sovereign's punishment, and that the benefits they would\nreceive from so doing outweigh the dangers of being caught and\npunished. Hobbes then points out that the correct standard for judging\nthe rationality of an action is one that rests on the expected returns\nof the action, and not the actual ones, and that in cases where promise\nbreakers eluded detection the action could still be irrational, as the\nexpected returns were insufficient to justify the risk. The tough cases\nfor Hobbes are those where breaking a promise would result in the\npromise breaker escaping the reach of the sovereign altogether by\nbecoming a sovereign, i.e., cases of revolution or usurpation. In such\ncases, Hobbes argues, promise breaking is still not rational because\ngaining a throne by revolution inspires those under the new tyrant to\nrepeat the process, and unseat him in turn. These moves just\ndon't seem sufficient to establish the general claim that the\napparent expected return from breaking a promise is never the larger\nvalue, and indeed the general consensus among contemporary scholars is\nthat Hobbes' reply to the fool is unsatisfying (cf. Hampton\n1986:–78-9; Gauthier 1986: 161–162) although there have been\nsome more recent attempts to rehabilitate the view (cf. Kavka 1995;\nHoekstra 1997). \n\nContemporary contractarian theory has a different sort of answer to\nthe problem of the fool, invoking not the threat of the\nsovereign's punishment, but the advantage of promise-keeping as a\ncooperative endeavor. Gauthier (1986: 164ff), as an example, argues\nthat promise-keeping is rational even in cases where the net value of\nreneging is larger than that of honoring the promise. Gauthier's\nreasoning is roughly the following: By constraining their pursuit\nof utility maximization in this fashion (always keeping promises\nregardless of the local utility value of doing so), agents can\n(ceteris paribus) jointly reach solutions to prisoner's\ndilemmas that are out of reach for the ‘foolish’\nstraightforward utility maximizers. What's required to escape a\nprisoner's dilemma is a reason for the participants to trust one\nanother, specifically to trust that the other will do what they\npromise, even though it doesn't maximize their utility to do so.\nSo only a partner who was disposed to keep promises even in cases where\ndoing so wouldn't maximize his utility (i.e., a non-foolish\npromiser) could be relied upon to do his part in a prisoner's\ndilemma scenario, and thus only those sorts of promisors could reach\nthe agreements that constitute these solutions. \n\nThe other branch of contract theory, contractualism, grounds\npromissory obligations by a similar appeal to the utility and value of\nthe practice of promising, but in a less direct fashion. For\ncontractualists, what makes a moral principle valid is its\nacceptability to those who are party to the contract, or to the\nbargaining situation that establishes it. Thus on such an approach the\nutility of the promising convention serves chiefly as a reason for the\ncontractors to endorse a principle mandating that promises be kept, or\nas an argument that the putative contractors would do so. Perhaps the\nmost influential contractualist theory of promising belongs to\nRawls. \n\nAlthough Rawls originally defended a Rule Utilitarian theory of\npromissory obligation (cf. Two Concepts of Rules, passim,\n1955), in A Theory of Justice (1971) he takes promissory\nobligations to be a matter of justice, and as such grounded in the\n(contractual) theory of justice, rather than in any more general moral\ntheory. Rawls famously conceives of the principles of justice as the\nresult of the deliberative choice of a representative group of the\nmembers of the society. The conditions of deliberation are together\ncalled the Original Position (OP), and agents in the OP are constrained\nin terms of the information they have, as information Rawls deems\nirrelevant to their deliberations on justice is excluded by what he\ncalls the Veil of Ignorance. Agents in the OP first choose principles\nof what Rawls calls the basic structure of society, principles that\ndetermine in broad outline what the just arrangements of the basic\ninstitutions of the society will be, and then go on to choose other\nsorts of principles, e.g., principles governing the just conduct of\nindividuals, as well as those governing justice in international\naffairs. \n\nUnlike some contractualists (cf. Scanlon 1998,\n see section 6.2, below) \nRawls conceives of promises not as\nsui generis moral actions, but as essentially institutional\nartifacts, and thus promissory obligations as institutional\nobligations, grounded in the same manner as all such\nobligations. These institutions are comprised of sets of rules that\nprescribe and proscribe certain sorts of behavior for the participants\nin the institution. The dicta of the rules are the contents of moral\nobligations (Rawls 1971: 112). Rawls in turn grounds institutional\nobligations in what he calls the principle of fairness. The principle\nof fairness is a basic moral principle, chosen by contractors in the\nOP. But unlike its more famous Rawlsian cognate the difference\nprinciple, the principle of fairness is an individual principle, one\nthat applies directly to individuals in the society, as opposed to the\nbasic institutions of the society themselves. Rawls lays out the\nprinciple of fairness in the following way: \n…[A] person is required to do his part as defined by the rules\nof an institution when two conditions are met: first the institution\nis just (or fair)…and second, one has voluntarily accepted the\nbenefits of the arrangement or taken advantage of the opportunities it\noffers to further their own interests. (1971: 112) \n\nSo there are two conditions on an action's being an\ninstitutional obligation in the Rawlsian sense: (1) The institution\nwhose rule calls for the action is just, and (2) The person has\n‘voluntarily accepted the benefits’ of the institution. \n\nRawls then introduces three theoretical elements to explain promissory\nobligations in particular. The first is what he calls the rule of\npromising, or the central rule that constitutes the promising\nconvention: \n \n[I]f one says the words ‘I promise to do\nX’ in the appropriate circumstances, one is to do X, unless\ncertain excusing conditions obtain.\n \nRawls doesn't go into the\ncircumstance and conditions mentioned in the rule in any great detail,\nbut he does note that a promise must be voluntary and deliberate. He\nalso notes that a proper rendition of such clauses is necessary to\nevaluate whether the institution of promising the rule defines is\njust (1971: 346). The second piece of theory Rawls employs is the notion\nof a bona fide promise. A bona fide promise is a promise that\n \narises in accordance with the rule of promising, when the\npractice [of promising] it represents is just.\n \nAnd the third\npiece of theory is a moral principle targeted to promises directly,\nwhat Rawls call the Principle of Fidelity. The principle of fidelity\nis merely a derivative of the principle of fairness, fashioned\nspecifically for the institution of promising. And it says simply that\n“[B]ona fide promises are to be kept” (1971: 347). \n\nThus Rawls' explanation for the obligatory force of promises\nis roughly: If you make a promise under a just promising institution,\nthen you are obligated to uphold that institution (and obey its rules)\nbecause to do otherwise would be to ‘free-ride’ on the\ninstitution in a manner forbidden by the principle of fairness. \n\nThe most detailed and sustained criticism of the later Rawlsian theory\nis found in the work of Michael Robins, especially his Promising,\nIntending and Moral Autonomy (1984). One particularly worrisome\nproblem Robins cites is that the ultimate ground of the principle of\nfairness, which is the ground of the obligation not to free ride, and\nthus to keep promises, is something like an agreement between the\nbargaining parties, and that agreement amounts to a set of promises that\nthey will abide by these rules. But this means that the convention of\npromising is ultimately grounded in the promise we (hypothetically)\nmake to keep our promise, and that seems blatantly circular (Robins\n1984: 127 ff). \n\nThe problem with explaining promissory obligations by reference to a\nprior promise to keep promises has been noted by commentators like\nPrichard (1940: 260) and others. Prichard proposes to ease the\nproblem by pointing out that the prior agreement isn't exactly an\nagreement to keep agreements, but rather an agreement to use the word\n‘promise’ in a certain way, but even he sees that this\ndoesn't solve the deeper puzzle, and he leaves this puzzle\nexplicitly unanswered\n \n …what is that something implied in\nthe existence of agreements which looks very much like an agreement and\nyet cannot, strictly speaking, be an agreement? (1940: 265) \n\nRawls tries to solve Prichard's puzzle by appealing to the\nprinciple of fairness, rather than directly to the ‘general\nagreement to keep agreements’, but Robins argues that this move\ndoesn't stop the regress (Robins 1984: 127 ff). Robins\nframes his argument in terms of a dilemma: either the principle of\nfairness is sufficiently strong to generate promissory obligations, in\nwhich case it is a principle of tacit consent, and thus the appeal is\ncircular, or the principle of fairness is weak enough to avoid\ncircularity, and thus too weak to ground promissory obligations. Robins\nargues for the first horn by claiming that in order for the principle\nof fairness to generate strong enough obligations against free riding\nto explain our obligations to keep promises, we must construe the\n‘voluntary’ participation of promisers in the convention to\nmean something like explicit acceptance of the arrangement to pay the\ncosts (obedience to the rules of the convention) in exchange for the\nbenefits, and this looks like an agreement to keep promises by way of\nan agreement to the principle of fairness, which is the circle again.\nOn the other hand, if we relax the demand of ‘voluntary\nparticipation’ to mean merely passive reception of the effects of\nthe convention (like the stability and cooperative bounty of society)\nthen we are like Nozick's radio station listener, apparently\nobligated to support the cooperative endeavor merely because we\npassively derive some benefit from it (cf. Nozick 1974: 90–5). With\nNozick, Robins claims that such a low standard for ‘voluntary\nparticipation’ necessary to engage the free riding principle\nwould mean that people weren't, in fact obligated not to free\nride (Robins 1984: 127–131). \n\nConsequentialist views of promissory obligation fall into two broad\ncamps, corresponding to the difference between act and rule\nutilitarianism. Act utilitarians generally explain promissory\nobligations as arising from the negative consequences of breaking the\npromise, whereas rule utilitarians defend promissory obligations on\nthe grounds that the rule of promise-keeping is productive of the best\nconsequences. \n\nAct utilitarians evaluate individual actions in light of the net\nutility produced by that action as compared to alternative\nactions. The right action is that which promotes the maximum net\nutility. On the face of it, this entirely general and comprehensive\nmaxim leaves no room for considerations of prior promise. The fact\nthat an agent promised someone something has no direct relevance to an\nact consequentialist appraisal of that agent's action at the\ntime the promise is meant to be kept. If breaking the promise would\npromote more utility than keeping it, then the theory seems to mandate\nbreaking the promise. \n\nThis counter-intuitive result has been offered as a criticism of act\nutilitarianism since its inception. That act utilitarians have\ndifficulty in accounting for the force of promises is a touchstone for\ncritics (cf. Prichard 1940; Ross 1930; Hodgson 1967). \n\n But act utilitarians do have some resources to accommodate our\nmoral intuitions about promises, and the sort of theory they employ is\nheld by more than just utilitarians\n (see Section 5.4, below). The act\nutilitarian explanation for promissory obligations is that these\nobligations arise from the negative consequences that attend the\nbreaking of promises, where these negative consequences are, at least\nin part, created by the effects of the promise on the promisee,\nspecifically, the creation in the promisee of the expectation that the\npromiser will keep her promise. A sample list of utilitarianism that\nhave either offered or defended such a view: Bentham (A Comment on\nthe Commentaries, 1–1–6), Sidgwick (The Methods of Ethics\n3–6), Narveson (1967, 1971), Singer (1975), and Ardal (1968, 1976).  In support of this picture utilitarians argue that promises are\nthe sorts of things which are generally made because the promisee\nwants the thing promised, and so wants to be assured of getting\nit. Since a promise is designed to secure his trust, and that trust is\nthen likely to be the source of much pain if it's disappointed, it's\nreasonable to assume that in most cases keeping one's promise will be\nproductive of better consequences than breaking them, given the\nexpectations of the promisee. And there are other potential negative\nconsequences of breaking a promise (e.g., the loss of trust by one's\nfamiliars, the general erosion of trust in the practice of promises)\nthat utilitarians can add to the negative side of the ledger. For an\nastute philosophical survey of Act Utilitarian approaches to promising\nsee Atiyah (1981: 30–79), also Robins (1984: 140–143) and\nVitek (1993: 61–70). \n\nAs mentioned above, the standard critique of the act utilitarian\ntheory of promissory obligations is that it doesn't accord with\nour intuitive judgment that at least some promises that don't\nproduce the maximum utility still ought to be kept. In claiming that\nutilitarianism has unacceptably counter-intuitive results in certain\ncases, this argument it is of a piece with most arguments against the\nview. One sort of counter-intuitive case that has received some\nattention is the so-called ‘Desert Island’ case, where a\npromise is made in isolation (on a desert island) to someone who then\ndies. The question is whether there is any obligation to keep the\npromise, given that the promisee can't have any expectations of\nits fulfillment (being dead) and that no-one else can know of the\npromise (cf. Nowell-Smith 1956; Narveson 1963: 210; Cargile 1964; \nNarveson 1967: 196–7). \n\nA more sophisticated problem outlined by Hodgson (1967: 38) and\nothers is that a promising convention is broadly speaking incompatible\nwith an act utilitarian society. This is so because such a convention\ncouldn't get established (or couldn't be sustained) if\npeople were aware that everyone was a consistent utility maximizer of\nthe act utilitarian sort. If this were the case people would put no\nstock in promises, knowing that when the time came to keep the promise,\nthe promiser would simply apply the utilitarian calculus, without\nregard to the fact that he had previously ‘promised’, as\nthis is what being an act utilitarian means. \n\nNote that the utilitarian cannot reply that we have failed to take\ninto account the expectations of the promisee in our case, because the\nclaim is that the promisee has no reason to generate any special\nexpectations that the promiser will do what she promises, precisely\nbecause he knows the promiser to be an act utilitarian, and\nconsequently knows that she will do what the utility calculus tells her\nis best, without thought of her promise. Of course, the promisee is\nfree to generate some expectations that the promiser will keep her\npromise on the assumption that her promise is indicative of her at\nleast having the (present) intention to perform the promised act. But,\nas Raz (1972), Kolodny and Wallace (2003) and others point out, the\nadvising of the promisee of one's mere intention to do the\npromised act is insufficient ground for the sorts of expectations that\nare meant to attend promises.  More recently there have been some efforts to rehabilitate act\nutilitarianism with regards to promissory obligations. Some theorists,\nlike Michael Smith (1994,2011), propose that sophisticating the theory\nwith the addition of other values might allow it to accommodate\n‘agent-relative’ values like promise keeping (cf. M. Smith\n2011: 208–215). \n\nOthers, like Alastair Norcross, offer a negative defense, arguing\nthat the sorts of counter-examples generally adduced to demonstrate the\nproblem don't survive scrutiny (Norcross 2011: 218). Norcross also\nproposes an indirect form of consequentialism, one where the decision\nprocedure consciously adopted by agents isn't the same as theory\nitself. This sort of approach is outlined by Peter Railton (1984). \n\nThe sorts of difficulties that promises pose for act utilitarian\ntheories discussed above are at least in part the motivation for rule\nutilitarianism (cf. Rawls 1955 and Brandt 1979: 286–305). Rule\nutilitarians change the context of moral evaluation from individual\nacts to rules governing actions. The principle of utility is applied to\nrules and practices, rather than individual acts, and the best rule or\npractice is that produces the best over-all consequences. Some notable\nrule utilitarians are Urmson (1953), Brandt (1959, 1979), and Hooker\n(2000, 2011). \n\nOf special note here is Rawls' 1955 paper Two Concepts of\nRules, which advanced a rule-utilitarian defense of promissory\nobligations and helped to focus the debate on promising\n (see section 6.1 below). By changing the focus\nfrom act to rule, rule utilitarians are better able to explain our\nmoral intuitions regarding individual cases of promise-keeping. But in\nparticular, rule utilitarians claim that their theory can make sense\nof the origin and maintenance of the practice of promising\nitself. Unlike an act utilitarian society, promising and trusting in\npromises makes sense in a rule utilitarian society, because promisees\ncan rest assured that promisors won't do the local utility calculation\nto determine whether or not to keep their promises, but rather will\nobey the rule of promising. \n\nSince the turn of the century Brad Hooker has offered newer versions\nof Brandt-style rule-utilitarianism (he calls it rule-consequentialism)\n(2000,2011) with an eye towards solving these sorts of problems.\nThis work has in turn spawned another chapter in this literature \n(cf. Eggleston 2007; Arneson 2005; Wall 2009; inter alia). \n\nOne influential critique of rule utilitarianism comes from David\nLyons 1965 book Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism. In it\nLyons argues that rule utilitarianism collapses to act utilitarianism,\nbecause for any given rule, in the exceptional case where breaking the\nrule produces more utility, the rule can always be sophisticated by the\naddition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception. But the\nvalidity of this process on the utilitarian framework holds for all\ncases of exceptions, and so the ‘rules’ will have as many\n‘sub-rules’ as there are exceptional cases, which, in the\nend, is to abandon the rule and be guided by the principle of utility,\nto seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility. \n\nLyons (1965, 182–195) levels a version of this criticism in\nterms of promises against Rawls' attempted distinction in Two\nConcepts of Rules between ‘rules of thumb’ and\npractice rules—either rule utilitarians counsel us to\nkeep promises where the outcome would be less than optimal or they claim\nthat the rule of promise keeping admits of exceptions. But if the\nexceptions to the rule of promise keeping are all those cases where\nkeeping a  promise is less than optimal, then the ‘rule’\nis no more than a rule of thumb, and the actual principle governing\ndecisions on promise-keeping is the principle of maximal utility. \n\nIt should be noted here however, that Lyon's argument has received\nsome vigorous criticism. See, e.g., Allan Gibbard (1965) and Holly\nGoldman (1974). I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer of this\npublication for these citations. \n\nAnother problem for the rule utilitarian theory of promissory\nobligations is that it seems that utilitarian society couldn't\nestablish a practice of promising, because prior to the establishment\nof the rule, people could have no expectations that promises would be\nkept. As such, those receiving the first promises would not be able to\nform the expectations necessary to make the rule actually productive of\nthe best consequences. This is so because the consequential value of\nthe rule of promise keeping depends on the expectations of promisees.\nSuch expectations are the grounds of trust, and trust is how promising\ngenerates its benefits (cf. Robins 1984: 142–3). In response, Brandt\nargues for what he calls ideal rule utilitarianism, which\nmakes the frame of reference for rule consideration not the actual\nrules available, but the ideal rule, i.e., the rule that would be\noptimific (productive of the best possible consequences), were it\nemployed. There is substantial criticism of this move (cf. Diggs 1970).\nAgain, an excellent (although now dated) survey of the rule-utilitarian\napproach to promising is found in Atiyah (1981: 79–86).  The above survey divides theories of promissory obligation along\nthe lines of the underlying moral theory, and this is a useful\ntaxonomical approach given that promissory obligations are to be\nexplained as a type of moral obligation. But another way of\nclassifying these theories found in the literature (cf. R.S. Downie\n1985; Atiyah 1981; Vitek 1993; Shiffrin 2008; Owens 2012) makes\nreference to the different approaches to promissory obligations in\nparticular. This sort of taxonomy allows us to see the shape of the\npromissory theories more clearly, and allows us to classify objections\nas either directed at the promissory theory directly, or at the\nunderlying moral theory. Most of the objections listed above are\nexamples of the latter sort of critique. In this section I will\noutline some of the former. The promissory taxonomy is also useful for\nhighlighting philosophical work on particular issues in promissory\ntheory as well as the work in related disciplines, such as legal\ntheory, that are germane to one or another theoretical approach.  (See\nVitek 1993: 5ff & 243 fn 40 for discussion of the taxonomy, and\nShiffrin 2008: 482–484 for a discussion of conventionalism in\nparticular). \n\nThe first group of theories we have already seen, in the survey of\nlater natural law theories—we can call them ‘normative\npower’ views.  On these theories, promising is a special sort of\npower we have over our normative circumstances, the power to invoke\nobligations by promissory utterance. What separates this approach from\nthe others is the self-contained nature of promises. On normative\npower views, promisors obligate themselves directly, by their own\npowers, rather than indirectly, either by appeal to a convention or by\nengendering expectations in the promisee. \n\nNormative power views grew out of the natural law tradition, and\ntheir patron is perhaps Aquinas, with his focus on the will and its\nability to bind itself. Modern versions begin to appear in the\n16th and 17th Centuries, and some notable early\nproponents are Locke and Reid, with Pufendorf and Grotius not far\nbehind. \n\nInitially these views explained the normative power by appeal to the\ndivine, and this is the sort of view Hume has in mind in the quote\nabove in section 1. After Hume, the normative power view waned in\npopularity, although it never disappeared, and it always held more sway\nin legal circles, which were more closely aligned with the natural law\ntradition. \n\nThis decline was part of a more general trend towards naturalism in\nthe later modern period, but by the 20 Century naturalistic versions of\nnormative power views began to appear. Unsurprisingly, naturalistic\nnormative power views are most popular among legal theorists, e.g.,\nH. L. A.\nHart (1955) and Joseph Raz (1972, 1977, 1984, 2012) and Seana Shiffrin\n(2008, 2012). But moral philosophers have also adopted them, some\nexamples being Gary Watson (2004), David Owens (2006, 2008, 2012) and\nConnie Rosati (2011) \n\nThe new normative power views generally ground the power the same\nway other elements of Hohfeldian (1919) systems (e.g., rights and\nprivileges) have been grounded, by appeal to our interests \n(cf. Feinberg 1970, 1974; Hart 1955; Dworkin 1977). Seana Shiffrin (2008,\n2012), for example, grounds the power in the interests we have in\nforming intimate relations with others, an approach shared by others\n(cf. Kimel 2004). \n\nDavid Owens (2006, 2008, 2011, 2012), in a novel approach, proposes a\npower based in what he calls our ‘authority interest’, or the interest\nwe have in having a certain practical authority over others, the\nauthority that being the recipient of a promise gives us. This power is\none of a family of such powers, whose purpose is \n \nto serve our\ninterest in being able to shape the normative landscape by declaration,\nan interest that takes at least two forms: the authority\ninterest, which underwrites promissory obligation and the\npermissive interest that underwrites the power of\nconsent. (Owens 2012: 25) \n\nThe paradigmatic criticism of the traditional normative power view\nis, of course, Hume's. What could possibly explain such a mysterious\npower to generate moral obligations at will? The traditional view seems\nhopeless for the naturalist, emanating as it does from super-natural\n‘rights’ or some similar thing. Of course, one need not embrace\nthis sort of naturalism here, and many don't. But for those who would,\nsome further explanation of the source of the power is needed. \n\nAs to the naturalistic views, many are of recent enough vintage not\nto have garnered much in the way of published criticism, although Neil\nMacCormick (1972) does offer some criticisms of Raz's view. \n\nConventionalist theories share at least two central claims—1)\nthat promising is essentially a human convention, that is, a rule\nbased practice or set of practices, and 2) that the practice of\npromising is very beneficial to both groups and to individuals who\nshare the convention, by making trust-based cooperation and\ncoordination possible. \n\nThe task for a conventionalist theory is to use these claims to\nexplain why it is that we have an obligation to keep our promises.\nConventionalists aim to supply a rationale that extends from general\nclaims about the coordinative benefits of the promising convention to\nthe demand that individuals keep their particular promises. \n\nThe Godfather of this category is Hume, and contemporary adopters\nare contract theorists like Gauthier and Rawls, as well as rule\nutilitarians like Brandt, Urmson and Hooker. (Hume's rather complicated\nand idiosyncratic view has spawned a small literature itself, see, e.g.,\nPitson 1988; Baier 1992; Gauthier 1992; Cohon 2006 inter\nalia) \n\nThere is an obvious natural affinity between the two views. The idea\nthat the value of the maintenance of a convention is the ground of a\nmoral obligation is exemplified in the view that promissory obligation\narises because of the value of the promising convention (although this\naffinity is not universally felt, see Scanlon's theory, below). What's\nneeded is an explanation of how we get from the value of the convention\nto the reification of the obligations it entails. \n\nContractarians bridge the gap by claiming that individual\nparticipation in (i.e., obedience to the rules of) the promising\nconvention is rationally mandated. Different contractarians offer\ndifferent reasons for this claim. Hobbes thinks that participation is\nrational due to the fear of punishment for reneging. Gauthier and\nothers think that the rational appeal of the coordinative benefits of\npromising, specifically its potential for resolving prisoners dilemmas,\nis sufficient to make obedience rational (cf. Gauthier 1986: 167).\nRule utilitarians have a very similar approach, although the final\nmandate is moral, not rational. On that picture, the promising\nconvention is composed of rules that are productive of the best\ncircumstances, and as such deserve obedience not from rational, but\nfrom moral duty (cf. Rawls 1955). \n\nContractualists bridge the gap either by appealing directly to the\nterms of the contract, and claiming that promise-breaking is an\nunacceptable breach, as Hooker does, or, in the more complicated case\nof the later Rawls of Theory of Justice, by claiming that a\npractice of promising that is both just and useful is an institution\nthat contractors have a duty to uphold, which duty includes the duty\nnot to ‘free-ride’ on the institution by not obeying its\nrules (i.e., making but not keeping promises). \n\nThere have been a number of influential critiques of conventionalist\npromissory theory as such, as opposed to the particular versions\noffered by Rawls. Thomas Scanlon offers two criticisms of this sort,\nwhich he says persuaded him to abandon conventionalism (Scanlon 1999:\n297ff). The first is that it requires the presence of a convention\nbetween the parties before promising is possible, and thus rules out\npromises between those who lack such a shared convention. \n\nAn example of why this is a problem is Scanlon's hypothetical\n‘state of nature’ situation, in which two strangers of\ndifferent societies meet on opposite sides of a river. Both have lost\ntheir respective hunting weapons to the other bank, and both realize\nthat the other's weapon is at his feet, and that it is within his\npower to return the weapon to the stranger on the opposite bank.\nScanlon argues that these two people can enter into a promissory\narrangement to return the each other's weapons, with its\nattendant obligations, despite the fact that they do not share a social\ninstitution of promising, or indeed any social institution at all. \n\nThe second criticism is that the conventional view gets the harm of\nbreaking a promise wrong. On the conventional view, when someone breaks\na promise, they harm the convention of promising as a whole, and by\nextension, all those who rely on it. But this clashes with our firm\nintuition that a broken promise harms primarily the jilted promisee. In\nresponse to this, it is open to a conventionalist to move towards a\n‘hybrid’ theory, one that invokes the convention to explain\nthe source of the trust of the promisee, but explains the harm done in\nbreaking a promise (and thus the ground of the obligation to keep one)\nas one of betraying that trust as per the expectational view\n(see section 5.5, below). This is roughly \nthe route that Kolodny and Wallace\n(2003) take. \n\nThere have also been some more recent criticisms advanced. See, e.g.,\nShiffrin (2008) and David Owens (2006, 2012). \n\n Another approach to promissory obligations is an appeal to the\nexpectations that promises create in their promisees. Theories of this\nsort generally agree that: 1) Promises are the sorts of things that are\ndesigned to invite the trust of promisee 2) This trust is a valuable\nthing, and its betrayal causes harm to promisees. Thus expectational\ntheorists conclude that the wrong in breaking a promise (and thus the\nground of promissory obligation) is the production of this harm. \n\nAs we noted, this approach is traditionally adopted by\nconsequentialists, particularly act utilitarians, since the betrayal of\ntrust is precisely a negative consequence of an action that act\nutilitarians can countenance on their theory. But in the past 40 years\nmany theorists with other normative frameworks have also adopted the\nview, e.g., F. S. McNeilly (1972) Neil MacCormick (1972), G. E. M. Anscombe\n(1981: Ch. 1), P. M. Atiyah (1981: Ch. 6), A. I. Melden (1979:\nCh. II),\nJudith Jarvis Thomson (1990: Ch. 12), T. M. Scanlon (1990, 1999: Ch. 7),\nPhilippa Foot (2001: Ch. 1) and Elinor Mason (2005). \n\nThere is a further distinction to be made, between those expectation\ntheorists that hold that a promisee must have experienced a tangible\nharm as the result of a broken promise for a wrong to have been\ncommitted, and those who hold that the mere disappointment is\nsufficient. We can call the first group Reliance theories, and the\nsecond Assurance theories. \n\nIn the last 20 years, T. M. Scanlon has outlined a comprehensive and\ndetailed version of expectational promissory theory that has become\nwidely influential. Scanlon's theory is taxonomically\ninteresting, in that while he adopts an expectational theory of\npromissory obligation, his underlying normative theory is\nstraightforwardly contractualist. Scanlon proposes that the operative\nmoral rules are those that no one at the bargaining table could\n‘reasonably reject’. Scanlon claims that promissory\nobligations derive from another sort of more basic moral obligations,\nspecifically obligations not to ‘unfairly manipulate’\nothers. One has a moral duty to keep one's promises because\nmaking a promise will lead others to believe that you will do what you\npromise. Breaking the promise is then tantamount to deceiving those one\npromised, and since one has a moral duty not to do this, one has a\nmoral duty to keep one's promises. \n\nScanlon's principle governing a promise's generation of\nan obligation (the Principle of Fidelity, or Principle F) is: \nPrinciple F: If (1) A voluntarily and intentionally\nleads B to expect that A will do X\n(unless B consents to A's not doing so); (2) A\nknows that B wants to be assured of this; (3) A acts\nwith the aim of providing this assurance, and has good reason to\nbelieve that he or she has done so; (4) B knows that A\nhas the intentions and beliefs just described; (5) A intends\nfor B to know this, and knows that B does know it;\n(6) B knows that A has this knowledge and intent, then,\nin the absence of special justification, A must do X\nunless B consents to X's not being done. (Scanlon 1998:\n304) \n\nPrinciple F is reasonable (i.e., a real moral principle with\nnormative force) because the reasons potential promisees have not to be\ndeceived outweigh the reasons potential promisors have to deceive. \n\nThere are a number of criticisms and objections in the literature to\nthe expectational approach to promissory obligations (in addition to\nthe ones above focused more specifically on the act utilitarian version\nof it). One group of problems revolves around the claim that by making\npromises out to be merely expectation-producing mechanisms,\nexpectationalists collapse the distinction between promising and other\nthings, like advising, warning and threatening (cf. Raz 1972; Vera\nPeetz 1977; see also Pall Ardal 1979, in response). \n\nAdjunct to these problems is the charge that the expectationalist\ncan't explain why promissory expectations produce obligations, in\na way that other expectations don't (cf. Raz 1972; Owens 2006).\nElinor Mason, in a recent article on Scanlon's theory argues in\nfavor of the collapse, claiming that promises are just one sort of\ninducement to trust, and the harm of breaking a promise is exactly the\nharm of misleading that might be performed by lying or otherwise\ndeceiving (Mason 2005). \n\nAnother traditional problem for expectational views is a charge of\ncircularity (cf. Robins 1976; Prichard 1940; Warnock 1971). The\nproblem is this: When I promise someone to do something then, if all\ngoes well, as a result of my promise they come to trust that I will do\nthat thing.  But this trust, on the expectational view, is the source\nof my obligation to do what I promise. So it seems that the trust of\nmy promisee is both the cause and the effect of my promise, and this\nseems an unacceptable circle. The problem is best framed in epistemic\nterms, as one of the reason that a promisee has to trust a promiser.\nThe intuitively obvious reason for the trust a promisee has is that\nthe promiser has promised, and as such has placed herself under a\nmoral obligation to do the deed. This belief, combined with beliefs\nabout the moral rectitude of the promiser, give the promisee a sound\nreason to believe that the promiser will keep her promise. The problem\nfor the expectational view is that the promisee, on such a view, can't\nrely on the fact of the promissory obligation as a reason to trust,\nsince on this view that obligation rests on the prior fact of the\ntrust itself. If the trust of the promiser is the ground of the moral\nobligation to keep a promise, then prior to the promisee coming to\ntrust the promiser, no such obligation exists. So when the promisee\ngoes searching for a reason to trust, the standard one is barred from\nconsideration. \n\nMoreover, if an expectationalist aims to offer a theory that explains\npromissory obligation without the invocation of a convention or\npractice of promising (like Scanlon does), then the other standard\nroute to explaining promise trust is blocked. If there is a convention\nin place that governs promises, and if that convention is such as to\ninspire confidence in promisees that promisers will keep their\npromises, then promises can be said to generate the necessary\nexpectations. But such a view is incompatible with the claim that\nconventions aren't necessary to explain promissory obligations.  These\nobjections are pressed against Scanlon's theory by N.  Kolodny and\nR. J. Wallace (2003). \n\nAnother traditional set of problems with the expectational approach\nis their difficulty in handling cases where the expectations that\nnormally attend a promise are lacking. The Desert Island/Deathbed cases\ndescribed above (section 4.2) are one such problem, where the\nexpectations are lacking because the promisee is dead. Scanlon\ndiscusses another sort of case, the Profligate Pal (Scanlon 1999: 312) where \nthe promisee fails to have the standard expectations\nbecause the promiser (the profligate pal) has made and broken too many\npromises in the past. In such cases expectationalists must either admit\nthat there is no obligation to keep the promise, which seems very\ncounterintuitive, or come up with some reason for the obligation apart\nfrom the fact that the promise created expectations in the\npromisee. \n\nRecently Daniel Freiderich and Nicholas Southwood (Freiderich and\nSouthwood 2009; Southwood and Freiderich 2011)\nhave put forward a version of an assurance theory they call a trust\ntheory. This theory that attempts to capture the intuitive appeal of\nthe view while handling some of these difficulties. They argue that\nwhat is crucial to incurring obligation is the ‘invitation’ to trust\nthat promising embodies, and that as such actual trust isn't necessary\nto generate the obligation (Southwood and Freiderich 2011: 278 ff). \n\nIn the last few years a new sort of theory of promissory obligations\nhas emerged. This approach makes promissory obligations out to be one\nof a number of Sui Generis obligations (and other normative\nphenomena) that arise from interpersonal exchange. The two pre-eminent\nviews are those of Stephen Darwall (2006, 2009, 2011) and Margaret\nGilbert (1993, 2011, 2013). Gilbert's theory, sketched in her\n“Three Dogmas of Promising” (2011) makes promissory\nobligations a matter of ‘joint commitment’, jointly made by two or more\nparties, who together commit them all. A given joint commitment, like\nthe agreement to take a walk together, is undertaken when the parties\nmake plain to one another their desires to undertake it. Once jointly\ncommitted the parties are obligated to one another to conform to the\ncommitment, and have the corresponding standing to demand fulfillment\nof the obligation. The obligations in question are intrinsic to the\njoint commitment and independent of its content. Joint commitments\ninform all manner of mutual arrangements, including but not limited to\nexplicit agreements and promises a commitment composed of (at least)\ntwo personal commitments, which are in turn commitments undertaken by\n‘an exercise of the will’ (see, e.g., Gilbert 2013). \n\nStephen Darwall's view makes promissory obligations out to be a\nspecies of what he has called ‘second-personal’ normative phenomena.\nSecond-personal phenomena are many and varied, and Darwall places\npromises in the category of ‘transactions’, which are a group,\nincluding contracts and other mutual arrangements, in which the basic\nsecond-personal authority (i.e., the power we have to ‘make claims and\ndemands on one another’) generates obligations to perform what is\noutlined in the transaction. This second-personal authority is in turn\na normative basic, and Darwall argues that this sort of authority is\nnecessarily assumed in all cases of agreement. \n\nDarwall assumes that transactions can engender obligations without\nan explicit ‘agreement’. As an example of this he cites accepting an\ninvitation. As well Darwall's second-personal authority story gives\nrise to explicitly moral obligations, through the mechanism of\ncontractualism: roughly, the sort of authority we have to enter\nagreements is the sort necessary to ground a hypothetical\ncontractualism of the Scanlonian sort. \n\nBesides the taxonomy and critiques of various promising theories,\nthere are also several other issues concerning promises that have\nreceived significant attention from scholars. These include the role of\npromises as speech acts, promising as a sort of game, and promises and\nthe law, in particular the relationship between promises and other\nsorts of voluntary obligations, like contracts and agreements. \n\nPromises have often been cast as speech acts, or actions that we\nperform by speaking. The locus classicus for this issue is\nJ. L.  Austin's 1955 book How to Do Things with Words. In it\nAustin defines two sorts of speech acts, or\n‘performatives’: illocutions and perlocutions. Illocutions\nare those actions that we perform by uttering the words alone. Austin\nlists requesting, warning and announcing as examples. Alternatively,\nperlocutions are actions performed by speaking which require some\nparticular effect of the speech in order to be successful.\nAustin cites persuading, explaining and alarming as examples of the\nlatter sort of locution. \n\nAustin takes promising to be an illocutionary act, that is, he takes\nit that promising is merely a matter of a certain form of\nutterance, under certain conditions. Moreover the reason he takes this\nto be is that he thinks that promising is a conventional act,\none that invokes a certain practice to formalize the action. Austin\nthinks that in this way promises are just of a piece with many sorts of\nobligation-producing actions, such as betting, buying and contracting\n(Austin 1955: 19) \n\nAustin's linguistic distinction mirrors the crucial difference\nbetween the expectational and conventional theories of promising. On\nthe conventionalist view that Austin adopts, promises are\n‘conventional’ moves in the game, and as such one promises\nby ‘making the right moves’, i.e., saying the right sorts of\nthings and otherwise obeying the rules of the game. For\nexpectationalists, a promise is a perlocutionary act, as it's\nonly successful if it actually produces the expectations in the\npromisee that the promise will be carried out. The investigation of\npromises as speech acts is furthered in the work of Rawls (1955),\nWilliam Alston (1964, 1994), John Searle (1965, 1979, 1985), David\nJones (1966) Otto Hanfling (1975) and Michael Pratt (2003, 2007)\nChristina Corredor (2001) and Vincent Blok (2013) among others. \n\nThe conventional approach places great weight on the rule-governed\nnature of promising. As a result, there is a large body of work on\nissues related to rules, games, and other aspects of the conceptual\nframework. One such issue is the aptness of the metaphor of promising\nas a game. This debate begins with Rawls' 1955 article\nTwo Concepts of Rules. In it \nRawls distinguished between what he called the ‘summary’\nconception of rules, in which rules are merely ‘rules of\nthumb’ i.e., guides to behavior based on reports of prior actions\nand their outcomes, and the ‘practice’ view of rules, which\nmakes them out to be ‘logically prior’ to individual cases.\nOne important claim Rawls makes about practice rules is that they do\nnot merely regulate action, but are constitutive of it. Constitutive\nrules, like the rules of baseball, are necessary for us to perform (and\neven understand) game-based actions like ‘striking out’.\nRawls argues that the promising convention is composed of (at least\none) constitutive rule, i.e., “When you say ‘I\nPromise’ or something similar, you must do what you say you\nwill.” \n\nRawls' article provoked a large body of response and related\nwork. Of particular note, John Searle adopts the framework and\nchampions the notion of a ‘conventional’ promising game.\nSearle expands the framework by adding what he calls\n‘conventional facts’ to it. Conventional facts are those\nthat concern the events in a conventional game. Saying that I have made\na promise is a conventional fact. Searle argues in his 1964 article\nHow to Derive ‘Ought’ from ‘Is’ that\nthis approach can answer the centuries-old Humean challenge for an\nexplanation of how to derive moral conclusions from empirical\nclaims. \n\nBut many critics dispute Rawls' and Searle's analysis.\nOne influential criticism originates with R. M. Hare. In his The\nPromising Game (1964) Hare argues that the obligation to obey a\npromise, on the constitutive-rule convention view, requires that we be\nobligated to play the game in order to ensure that we are obligated to\nkeep our promises, but that such an obligation cannot come from inside\nthe game itself. Mary Midgley's 1974 article The Game\nGame takes the argument further, in an attempt to refute\nRawls' claim that the notion of constitutive rules can truly\ncapture the nature of a game. There are many other commentators, e.g.:\nFlew (1965), Lyons (1965), Zemach (1971), Vitek (1993). For an\nexcellent overview of these issues see Vitek (1993: 118) \n\nIn addition to this work, there is also a corpus of work on promises\nin game theory and economic theory, stemming from the contractarian\nproject of grounding promissory obligation in self-interested\nrationality. Some important elements of this literature are Harsanyi\n(1955), Gauthier (1986), Hardin (1988), Narveson (1988), Binmore\n(1994), Skyrms (1996) and Verbeek\n(2002). \n\nThe relationship between the law, contracts and promises is a long and\ntangled one. From its ancient origins promissory theory has been\nintertwined with issues of contracts and agreements more\ngenerally. And since at least the time of Aquinas and especially with\nthe works of the later Natural Lawyers like Grotius and Pufendorf,\nscholarly work on promising has been done at least in part with an eye\ntowards informing the law of contract. This in turn gave rise to a\ntradition on the part of legal theorists of surveying such scholarship\nin their work on both historical and contemporary issues in the law of\ncontract. Finally, the law itself has methods for dealing with\npromises (as they are obviously the sorts of things that might lead to\nlegal wrangling). Thus the legal practice regarding promises has some\ninterest to theorists of promising as well. The result is two\ninterlinked scholarly traditions and bodies of work. \n\nPerhaps the first question on the mind of legal and philosophical\nhistorians is the issue of the degree to which, if any, contractual\nobligations are grounded in promissory obligations in contemporary\nlegal regimes. This question is complicated by the different traditions\nand cultures involved in the long path to contemporary law, i.e.,\nnatural law theory, virtue theory, rights theory, the (anglo) common\nlaw, the continental civilian law, canon law and other theoretical\napproaches, which are in turn variously situated in the UK, on the\nEuropean continent, and in the anglo territories (Scotland, Australia,\nCanada the US, etc.). The answer to the question is different in\ndifferent traditions and places, and the contemporary law is the result\nof some complicated amalgamation of these different traditions over\ntime. For an overview of these issues, see, e.g., Swain (2013),\nIbbetson (1999), Gordley (1991), Simpson (1975), or Fried (1981). \n\nOne central dialectic within this corpus has the ‘normative\npower’ tradition of the natural lawyers pitted against the more\nexpectational views of the English common law. As Atiyah notes \n(1981: ch. 6), there is a tension between the Natural Law promissory theory\nand the actual law of contract and promise plainly evident in the\nBritish common law.  One source of the tension is the common law\ndoctrine of ‘consideration’, which mandates that only\npromises given with ‘consideration’, i.e., given in\nexchange for something of value, are enforceable in the law. In other\nwords, mere promises, given without consideration, are traditionally\nnot indemnified by the law. \n\nFurther, as Lon Fuller and William Perdue pointed out in an\ninfluential 1939 article “The Reliance Interest in Contract\nDamages”, the damages awarded by courts to those who have had a\npromise or contract broken is best understood as being proportional to\nthe harm the plaintiff suffered in relying on the promise. These and\nother considerations argue for a theory of promises based on\nexpectations and reliance, i.e., an expectational theory, as opposed to\none based on conventions or natural duties, and this is what a number\nof philosophers and legal theorists have done. This debate has spawned\na sizeable literature (see Swain 2013 for a good overview of this\nwork). \n\nCharles Fried's widely influential book Contract as Promise\n(1981) re-kindled this debate in American legal circles. Fried argued\nthat the traditional approach, which made contractual obligation out to\nbe grounded in promissory obligation, was slowly being usurped by the\nconsequentialist-flavored approaches of the English common law, and he\naimed his book as a polemic against this movement. \n\nFried took on these arguments directly, and the corpus of work that\nsprang from the book greatly enlarged the debate. In 2012 a special\nconference and subsequent issue of the Suffolk University Law Review\nrevisited Fried's work, 30 years on. This new corpus of work provides\nus with some interesting new explorations. As an example of this, see\nBrian Bix's assessment in his essay (2012). \n\nAs a practical matter, legal theory continues to be a source of much\nof the best academic work on promises and related phenomena, with\nscholars like Markovits (2011), Shiffrin (2008, 2012), Pratt (2007,\n2013) and many others contributing. \n\nThere are several other issues being discussed in contemporary\npromissory theory. What follows is a quick listing of some major ones,\nwith references for further research. \n\nCoerced Promises. Since at least Hobbes\n(Lev. I–14:198) there has been a debate about whether a coerced\npromise is binding. Some contemporary additions to this corpus are\nGilbert 1993; Deigh 2002; Owens 2007; and Chwang 2011. \n\nPromises to the Self. Again, Hobbes (Lev.\nII–26:184) begins a debate that continues today over whether promises\nmade to oneself are binding, Cf. Hill 1991; Migotti 2003; Habib\n2009;\nRosati 2011.","contact.mail":"anhabib@ucalgary.ca","contact.domain":"ucalgary.ca"}]
