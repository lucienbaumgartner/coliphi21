C.E.) has long been recognized as one of the most important\nintermediaries between ancient philosophy and the Latin Middle Ages\nand, through his Consolation of Philosophy, as a talented\nliterary writer, with a gift for making philosophical ideas dramatic\nand accessible to a wider public. He had previously translated\nAristotle’s logical works into Latin, written commentaries on them as\nwell as logical textbooks, and used his logical training to contribute\nto the theological discussions of the time. All these writings, which\nwould be enormously influential in the Middle Ages, drew extensively\non the thinking of Greek Neoplatonists such as Porphyry and\nIamblichus. Recent work has also tried to identify and evaluate\nBoethius’s own contribution, as an independent thinker, though one\nworking within a tradition which put little obvious weight on\nphilosophical originality. Both aspects of Boethius will be considered\nin the sections which follow.\n\n\n\nAnicius Severinus Manlius Boethius was born into the Roman aristocracy\nc. 475–7 C.E.—about the same time as the last Roman\nEmperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed (August 476). Boethius lived\nmost of his life under the rule of Theoderic, an Ostrogoth educated at\nConstantinople, who was happy to let the old families keep up their\ntraditions in Rome, while he wielded power in Ravenna. Boethius’s\nprivileged social position ensured that he was taught Greek thoroughly\nand, though it is unlikely that he travelled to Athens or Alexandria,\nthe sites of the two remaining (Platonic) philosophical schools, he\nwas certainly acquainted with a good deal of the work which had been\ngoing on there. He was able to spend most of his life in learned\nleisure, pursuing his vast project of translating and commenting\nphilosophical texts. The Roman aristocracy was, by his day, thoroughly\nChristianized, and Boethius also became involved in some of the\necclesiastical disputes of his time, centring mainly around a schism\nbetween the Latin and the Greek Churches which was resolved shortly\nbefore his death. \n\nBoethius’s final years are well known to anyone who has read his most\npopular work, the Consolation of Philosophy. He agreed to\nbecome Theoderic’s ‘Master of Offices’, one of the most\nsenior officials, but he quickly fell out with many others at court,\nprobably because he attacked their corruption. Accused of treason and\nof engaging in magic, he was imprisoned and (probably in 526)\nexecuted, but not before he had the chance to write his literary\nmasterpiece. \n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy, a prosimetrum (a prose work\nwith verse interludes) which recounts, in polished literary language,\nan imagined dialogue between the prisoner Boethius and a lady who\npersonifies Philosophy, contrasts with the rest of Boethius’s\noeuvre. Besides writing text-books on arithmetic and\ngeometry, closely based on Greek models, Boethius devoted himself to\ntranslating Aristotle’s logic and commenting on it; he produced a\ncommentary on the Categories and two each on On\nInterpretation and on the Isagoge\n(‘Introduction’) by Porphyry, which had become a standard\npart of the logical curriculum. He also composed logical text-books on\ndivision, categorical syllogisms, and on two branches of logic which\nwill require further explanation (see\n below, Section 3):\n hypothetical syllogisms and topical reasoning (along with a\ncommentary on Cicero’s Topics). In three of his four\nTheological Treatises (often known as the Opuscula\nsacra), I, II and V, Boethius uses his logical equipment to\ntackle problems of Christian doctrine; IV, however, is a\nstraightforward statement of Christian doctrine, a sort of confession\nof faith; whilst III is a brief, not specifically Christian\nphilosophical treatise. \n\nBoethius’s work as a translator and commentator of Aristotelian logic\nmight appear to be just the beginning of a wider project, announced in\nthe second commentary on On Interpretation  (c. 516), and cut\nshort by his execution, to translate and comment on all the writings\nof Plato and Aristotle. Yet Boethius seems to have become so engrossed\nin his role as an expositor of logic, not limiting himself to a single\ncommentary on each work, and writing extra textbooks, that it is hard not\nto see it as having diverted him, in any case, from his more grandiose\nscheme. Indeed, Boethius seems to have pursued a rather special\nlogical project. \n\nThe particular, deliberate nature of this project is not cast into\ndoubt by the fact that Boethius’s logical commentaries, although\nalmost certainly not merely servile translations of marginalia from a\nGreek manuscript (as James Shiel (1990) has argued), are not at all\noriginal in their logical doctrines. For what is important is\nBoethius’s choice of Porphyry as his main authority in logic. It was\nPorphyry who, two centuries or so earlier, had been responsible for\nmaking Aristotelian logic an important subject within the Neoplatonic\ncurriculum. He held that it did not conflict with Platonic doctrine,\nas his teacher Plotinus had believed, because its area of application\nwas limited to the sensible world, to which everyday language\nrefers. Later Neoplatonists accepted the importance of Aristotelian\nlogic, and the harmony between Platonic and Aristotelian teaching, but\nthey tended to try and discover Neoplatonic doctrines even in the\nAristotelian logical texts. In the case of the Categories,\nthey even imagined that Aristotle had taken his doctrine from a\nPythagorean writer, Archytas, and that there was an underlying and\nwildly metaphysical strand to the text which it was the commentator’s\nduty to uncover. Boethius, however, although making occasional use of\nlater commentaries, usually followed Porphyry: on the Categories\n he stayed close to Porphyry’s surviving (and quite simple)\nquestion-and-answer commentary, whilst the long, second commentary on\nOn Interpretation is commonly accepted as the best guide to\nPorphyry’s exegesis, since his own commentary does not\nsurvive. Boethius’s commentaries were, therefore, because more\nPorphyrian, so more Aristotelian than what was being written in Greek\nin his period. \n\nBoethius’s Porphyrian approach is evident even in the two commentaries\non Porphyry’s own Isagoge (an introduction to the\nCategories which had become accepted as a standard part of\nthe logical curriculum)—one text on which, obviously, Porphyry\nhimself had never commented. Near the beginning of the\nIsagoge, Porphyry mentions, but declines in an introductory\nwork to discuss, three questions about universals. Do they exist or\nare they mere concepts?  If they exist are they bodily or not, and, if\nthey are not, are they separated from sensible things or do they exist\nin them? By Boethius’s time, the Greek commentators had developed a\nstandard way of glossing this passage. They explained that universals\ncould be considered as concepts (universals post\nrem—‘following the thing’), as intrinsic to\nbodily things (universals in re—‘in the\nthing’) and as really existing and separate from bodies\n(universals ante rem—‘before the\nthing’). Rather than proffer an explanation on these lines,\nBoethius turns to a train of thought (1906, 161:14 ff.) which goes\nback in part to Porphyry himself and, through him, to the great\nAristotelian, Alexander of Aphrodisias. \n\nBoethius begins with an argument against universals as an object of\nenquiry. Everything that really exists is one in number, but nothing\nthat is common to many at the same time can be one in number. But\nuniversals are common to many at the same time. And so\nuniversals do not exist in reality, but in thought alone. Thoughts,\nBoethius continues, are of two sorts: those which derive from their\nobject in the way it is (call them ‘corresponding\nthoughts’) and those which do not. If the thoughts that are\nuniversals were corresponding thoughts, then universals would also\nexist in reality. Since they do not, universals are non-corresponding\nthoughts, and non-corresponding thoughts are empty. Enquiry into\nuniversals (and therefore into the five predicables studied in the\nIsagoge) should therefore be abandoned. Boethius’s way of\ntackling this objection is to challenge just the very final\nstage. Non-corresponding thoughts, he argues, are not empty if they\nare abstractions. Consider a mathematical object such as a line or a\npoint, which the mathematician contemplates by abstracting from the\nmaterial body of which it is part. No such thing exists in reality as\nan immaterial line or point, and yet the mathematician’s thought is\nnot empty or misleading. The case is similar if we disregard the\naccidental features of some particular thing (John Marenbon, for\ninstance) and are left just with his nature of man. This line of\nreply, as Alain de Libera (1999, 159–280) has shown, goes back to\nAlexander of Aphrodisias or his followers. Boethius, however, goes on\nto give it his own particular twist, by suggesting that the universals\nproduced by abstraction are not merely the constructions of the mind,\nbut do grasp reality as it is. Although this line fits oddly with the\nargument from which Boethius set out, he may already be anticipating\nthe Principle of Modes of Cognition, which he proposes in the\nConsolation\n (see Section 6 below). \n\nThe long, second commentary on On Interpretation  is very\nprobably based, as explained above, on Porphyry’s lost commentary. It\nthus provides a full account of Porphyry’s semantics—a semantics\nbased on Aristotle, because he takes ordinary language to be concerned\nwith material things rather than with the intelligible world. There is\nalso an extended discussion of the sea-battle passage in Chapter\n9. According to the principle of bivalence, ‘There will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow’ is either true or false. But, if it is\ntrue, then there will be a sea-battle tomorrow; if false,\nthere will not be one. Either way, is it not therefore a\nmatter of necessity? Boethius’s strategy is to say that ‘There\nwill be a sea-battle tomorrow’ is indeed either true or false,\nbut, because the sea-battle is a contingent event, its truth or\nfalsehood is only indefinite. What does this position amount to? There\nare various interpretations of how it should be understood. Perhaps\nthe most plausible is that Boethius holds that, if an event e\n is contingent, then the sentence ‘e will take\nplace’ is false, even if it turns out that e does in\nfact happen, because ‘e will take place’ implies\nthat e will take place necessarily. But a qualified sentence\nsuch as ‘e will take place contingently’ is true\njust in case it is not necessary that e happens, and\ne actually happens. \n\nThe two most interesting of Boethius’s logical text-books are the\ntreatises on topical differentiae (c. 522–3) and on\nhypothetical syllogisms (516–22), since each gives an insight\ninto an area of late ancient logic for which there are otherwise few,\nif any, sources. \n\nFrom Aristotle’s Topics, logicians of late antiquity had\nelaborated a system of topical argument, which had been considerably\ninfluenced by the needs of Roman lawyers. The focus of topical theory\nis on discovering arguments, and these arguments are not\nusually formally valid, but merely plausible. The topical\ndifferentiae are the classifications of types of such\narguments; knowing the differentiae gives the arguer a ready\nmeans to hit upon a persuasive line of reasoning. Suppose, for\nexample, I want to argue that we should praise Cicero. I start trying\nto think what information I have which might help me to argue this\npoint, and I remember that everyone is full of praises for another\norator, Demosthenes. Then I turn over in my mind the list of topical\ndifferentiae and I see that the differentia\n‘from equals’ will provide me with the argument I\nneed: Therefore \n\nAssociated with this, as with every differentia, is a\n‘maximal sentence’ (maxima propositio), in this\ncase: ‘equal things are to be judged equally.’ The maximal\nsentence can be taken as an indication of how to put together the\nargument; it might also be added to the argument in order to make it\nformally valid, but Boethius did not envisage maximal sentences being\nused in this way. Rather, the topical arguer produces arguments of\ndiffering strength, depending on how close to being a logical truth is\nthe maximal sentence associated with the differentia he is\nusing. Some maximal sentences do indeed state fundamental laws of\nreasoning (including modus ponens and modus\ntollens); others state what are at best rules of thumb and, in the\ncase of the topic ‘from authority’—the injunction to\naccept as true what the wise, or experts or the majority\nbelieve—not even that. \n\nBoethius’s two main authorities, Cicero and Themistius, give rather\ndifferent lists of the topical differentiae, and one of the\ntasks of his text-book is to show that their schemes do really\ncoincide. In his commentary on Cicero’s Topics, written\nshortly before, Boethius expounds the same theory, but leaves himself\nplenty of room for digressions on such subjects as universals,\ncausation, free will and Stoic logic. \n\nIt is Stoic logic and Boethius’s relations to it which give his\ntreatise On hypothetical syllogisms its special interest. A\nsyllogism is ‘hypothetical’ when one of its premisses is a\nmolecular sentence which uses ‘if’ or ‘or’\n(understood as exclusive disjunction) as a connective. So, for\nexample, the following syllogism is hypothetical: Therefore \n\nA modern reader will be inclined to see (4–6) as a piece of\nsimple sentence logic: p→q; ¬q; therefore\n¬p. Since it was the Stoics who, in antiquity, developed\na sentence logic, by contrast with Aristotle’s term logic, it would\nappear that Boethius’s treatise on hypothetical syllogisms is the\ntributary of Stoic logic. This conclusion is true to the extent that\nthe tradition Boethius inherited goes back in part to Stoic roots. By\nthe time it had reached Boethius, however, Stoic and Peripatetic\nelements had become hopelessly confused. As C.J. Martin (1991) has\nshown, Boethius himself lacked the conceptual apparatus to think in\nterms of sentence logic. For him, (4–6) is to be understood as\nterm logic, in which the predicates ‘is light’ and\n‘is day’ are attributed to or denied of a vague subject\n‘it’. The treatise itself is mainly devoted to a laborious\ncalculation of the various different possible forms of hypothetical\nsyllogism involving two, three (with a first premise such as ‘If\nit is A, then if it is B, it is C’)\nand four terms (with a first premise such as ‘If, if it is\nA then it is B, then, if it is C then it is\nD’). \n\nThe three opuscula sacra written to analyse points of\nChristian doctrine seem to have been occasioned by events of the\ntime. Treatise V, against Eutyches and Nestorius, was apparently\ninspired by a letter (c. 513) from a group of Greek bishops, proposing\na Christological formula which, they hoped, would unite the Western\nand Eastern Churches. The two treatises on the Trinity (II is a\npartial sketch for I) are probably related to the intervention in 519 by a\ngroup of Scythian monks, also designed to heal the schism. The works\nhave, however, an interest far beyond their contributions to the\nimmediate doctrinal debate. They pioneer a method of using logical\nanalysis in a theological context which Augustine had anticipated but\nnot developed. Both heretical positions (for examples, the views about\nChrist and human nature held by Eutyches and Nestorius) and orthodox\nChristian doctrine are subjected to rigorous scrutiny, using the\ntechniques of Aristotelian logic and, where necessary, ideas from\nAristotelian physics. The heretical ideas are shown to contain logical\ncontradictions. As for the orthodox understanding of God, it does not\nfit within the classifications of Aristotelian logic and natural\nscience, but Boethius tries to chart exactly how far these\ndistinctions, which are accommodated to the created world, also apply\nto the deity, and at what point they break down and provide us merely\nwith an analogy. \n\n This way of thinking about God is made especially clear in the longer\ntreatise on the Trinity (I). When God is said to have an attribute,\nhow is this predication to be understood? For created things, on the\nAristotelian scheme, a predication is either substantial (when the\ngenus, species or differentia is predicated of something:\n‘Socrates is an animal/man/rational’) or accidental, when\nthe predicate is any accident in any of the nine Aristotelian\ncategories of accident. Augustine had already acknowledged that\nnothing is predicated of God accidentally. Predications about him may\nbe relative, as when he is called ‘Father’ or\n‘Son’, or substantial. Even when a quality or quantity is\nattributed to him, the predication is substantial. When we say of a\ncreated thing that it is great or good, we are affirming that it\nparticipates in greatness or goodness: it is one thing for the thing\nto exist, another for it to be great or good. But God is greatness\nitself and goodness itself, and so, when we say, ‘God is\ngood’ or ‘God is great’, we are not affirming any\nattribute of him beyond what he is as a substance. This Augustinian\nview is faithfully set out in the brief Treatise II. \n\nIn Treatise I, Boethius develops this scheme. In especial, he\ndistinguishes between predications in the categories of Substance,\nQuantity and Quality, which are proper and intrinsic, and those in the\nother six categories, excluding Relation, which he calls improper and\nextrinsic. The intuitive idea behind the distinction seems to be that\npredications in these other categories concern only how the subject\nrelates to other things; only substantial, quantitative and\nqualitative attributes characterize the thing itself. Boethius\ngoes on to say that, whereas all proper, intrinsic predications about\nGod are substantial, extrinsic, improper predications about him are\nnot: they do not concern what either God or his creatures\nare, but are rather about exterior things. \n\nThe discussion of Relation shows particularly clearly how Boethius\napplies logic to analysing God as far as he can, and then shows where\nand how the logic fails. He needs to explain how it can be true that\nthe same, one God is both the Father and the Son. He does so by\nclaiming that a predication of Relation, such as ‘is the\nFather’, does not concern the substance of the things related:\nthat a is related to b in no way changes a\nor b. Moreover, there are some relationships which a thing\ncan have to itself—for example, that of equality. Being-a-father\nand being-a-son are not, among created things, such relations: no one\ncan be his own father or his own son. But it is here, says Boethius,\nthat creaturely logic breaks down when it tries to comprehend the\nTrinity: we have in some way to try to grasp the idea of a relation of\nfatherhood or filiation which is reflexive. Another philosophical question Boethius explores in his discussions\nof the Trinity is individuation (as well as more widely the topic of\nparts and wholes). Unfortunately, it is not completely clear to what\ntheory of individuation he subscribes. A quick reading of some\npassages would suggest that substances are indviduated by a bundle of\naccidents, but there are indications that Boethius may have preferred\na theory of individuation by spatio-temporal position, or one\ndifferent from either of these (cf. Arlig, 2009). \n\nTreatise III is also concerned with predication and God. But it\ndiffers sharply from the other treatises, in that it contains nothing\nspecifically Christian. The question it addresses is how all\nsubstances are good in that they are, and yet are not substantial\ngoods. Boethius takes it as a fundamental truth that all things tend\nto the good, and also that things are by nature like what they\ndesire. Everything, therefore, is by nature good. But if so, then\nthings must be good either by participation, or substantially (or\n‘essentially’ as a modern philosopher would say). If they\nwere merely good by participation, they would be good by accident, not\nby nature. But if they are good substantially, then their substance is\ngoodness itself, and so nothing can be distinguished from the first\ngood, God. In giving his answer, Boethius makes use of a set of axioms\nhe states at the beginning of the piece, and undertakes a\nthought-experiment in which it is supposed per impossibile\nthat God does not exist. The key to his solution lies in finding a\nprincipled way to distinguish between a thing a being\nF in that it exists, and a thing a being\nsubstantially F. For a to be substantially\nF means, Boethius’s discussion implies, that\n‘a is not-F’ is inconceivable (we might\nsay ‘logically impossible’). For a to be\nF in that it exists means just that ‘a is\nnot-F’ is impossible (we might say ‘impossible\ngiven the way the world is set up’). Whereas it is inconceivable\nthat God is not good, it is merely impossible that everything is not\ngood. \n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy presents interpretative\ndifficulties of a different order from the logical works or the\ntheological treatises. Unlike them, it is written in an elaborate\nliterary form: it consists of a dialogue between Boethius, sitting in\nhis prison-cell awaiting execution, and a lady who personifies\nPhilosophy, and its often highly rhetorical prose is interspersed with\nverse passages. Moreover, although it is true that elsewhere Boethius\ndoes not write in a way which identifies him as a Christian except in\nthe Theological Treatises I, II, IV and V, the absence of any explicit\nreference to Christianity in the Consolation poses a special\nproblem, when it is recalled that it is the work of a man about to\nface death and so very literally composing his philosophical and\nliterary testament. These questions will appear in sharper focus\n (Section 7) \n when the argument of the Consolation  has been examined. \n\nBoethius’s real predicament sets the scene for the argument of the\nConsolation. He represents himself as utterly confused and\ndejected by his sudden change of fortune. Philosophy’s first\njob—true to the generic aim of a consolatio—is to\nconsole, not by offering sympathy, but by showing that Boethius has no\ngood reason to complain: true happiness, she wishes to argue, is not\ndamaged even by the sort of disaster he has experienced. She also\nidentifies in Book I a wider objective: to show that it is not the\ncase, as Boethius the character claims, that the wicked prosper and\nthe good are oppressed. \n\nPhilosophy seems to have two different lines of argument to show\nBoethius that his predicament does not exclude him from true\nhappiness. The first train of argument rests on a complex\nview of the highest good. The first (which is put forward in Book II\nand the first part of Book III) distinguishes between the ornamental\ngoods of fortune, which are of very limited value—riches,\nstatus, power and sensual pleasure—and the true goods: the\nvirtues and also sufficiency, which is what those who seek riches,\nstatus and power really desire. It also recognizes some non-ornamental\ngoods of fortune, such as a person’s friends and family, as having\nconsiderable genuine value. On the basis of these distinctions,\nPhilosophy can argue that Boethius has not lost any true goods, and\nthat he still even retains those goods of fortune—his\nfamily—which carry much real worth. She does not maintain that,\nin his fall from being powerful, rich and respected to the status of a\ncondemned prisoner, Boethius has lost nothing of any worth at all. But\nhis loss need not cut him off from true happiness, which is attained\nprimarily by an austere life based on sufficiency, virtue and\nwisdom. \n\nPhilosophy’s second line of argument is based on a simple\nview of the highest good. She begins to put it forward in III.10, a\nturning-point in the discussion, which is preceded by the most solemn\npoem of the whole work (III m. 9), an invocation to God in terms\nborrowed from Plato’s Timaeus. Through a number of arguments\nwhich draw out the consequences of the Neoplatonic assumptions which\nBoethius accepts, Philosophy shows that the perfect good and perfect\nhappiness are not merely in God: they are God. Perfect\nhappiness is therefore completely untouched by changes in earthly\nfortune, however drastic. But what this second approach fails to\nexplain is how the individual human, such as Boethius, is supposed to\nrelate to the perfect happiness which is God. Philosophy seems to\nspeak as if, merely by knowing that God is perfect happiness,\nBoethius himself will be rendered happy, although in the next section\nit seems that it is by acting well that a person can attain the\ngood. \n\nPhilosophy now goes on (III.11–12) to explain how God rules the\nuniverse. He does so by acting as a final cause. He is the good which\nall things desire, and so he functions as ‘a helm and rudder, by\nwhich the fabric of the world is kept stable and without decay.’\nPhilosophy thus pictures an entirely non-interventionist God,\npresiding over a universe which is well-ordered simply because he\nexists. But how does this account fit with the apparent oppression of\nthe good and triumph of the wicked, about which Boethius had begun by\ncomplaining? In Book IV.1–4, Philosophy shows, drawing on\nPlato’s Gorgias, that the evil do not really prosper and they\nare in fact powerless. Her central argument is that what everyone\nwants is happiness, and happiness is identical with the good. The good\nhave therefore gained happiness, whereas the wicked have not; and\nsince people have power in so far as they can gain or bring about what\nthey want, the wicked are powerless. She also argues that the good\ngain their reward automatically, since by being good, they attain the\ngood, which is happiness. By contrast, since evil is not a thing but a\nprivation of existence, by being wicked people punish themselves,\nbecause they cease even to exist—that is to say, they stop\nbeing the sort of things they were, humans, and become other, lower\nanimals. Philosophy is therefore able to put forward emphatically two\nof the most counter-intuitive claims of the Gorgias: that the\nwicked are happier when they are prevented from their evil and\npunished for it, than when they carry it out with impunity, and that\nthose who do injustice are unhappier than those who suffer it. \n\nAt the beginning of IV.5, however, there is another change of\ndirection. Boethius the character is allowed to put forward the\nobvious, common-sense objections to the position Philosophy has been\ntaking: ‘which wise man’, he asks, ‘would prefer to\nbe a penniless, disgraced exile rather than stay in his own city and\nlead there a flourishing life, mighty in wealth, revered in honour and\nstrong in power?’ Philosophy answers by abandoning completely\nthe explanation developed from III.11 onwards, which presented God as\na non-intervening final cause, and offers instead a view of God as the\nefficient cause of all things. Divine providence is the unified view\nin God’s mind of the course of events which, unfolded in time, is\ncalled ‘fate’, and everything which takes place on earth\nis part of God’s providence. Philosophy’s change of direction might\nseem at first to make Boethius’s common-sense objection even harder to\nanswer, but in fact it is easy enough for her to explain that\napparently unjust rewards and punishments on earth always serve a\ngood, though to us hidden, purpose: for instance, exercising good\npeople to increase their virtue, helping the wicked to repent or,\nalternatively, letting them bring themselves to ruin. A less tractable\nproblem raised by Philosophy’s new approach is that it seems to imply\nthat the human will is causally determined. Unlike many modern\nphilosophers, Boethius did not believe that the will can remain free,\nin the sense needed for attribution of moral responsibility, if it is\ndetermined causally. Moreover, Philosophy insists that the causal\nchain of providence, as worked out in fate, embraces all that\nhappens. In V.1, when Boethius asks about chance, Philosophy explains\nthat events are said to happen by chance when they are the result of a\nchain of causes which is unintended or unexpected, as when someone is\ndigging in a field for vegetables and finds a buried\ntreasure. Philosophy’s solution is to argue (V.2) that rational acts\nof volition, unlike all external events, do not themselves belong to\nthe causal chain of fate. This freedom, however, is enjoyed only by\n‘the divine and supernal substances’ and by human beings\nengaged in the contemplation of God. It is reduced and lost as humans\ngive their attentions to worldly things and allow themselves to be\nswayed by the passions. \n\nIn V.3, however, the character Boethius puts forward an argument,\nbased on God’s foreknowledge of future events, which threatens to show\nthat even mental acts of willing are necessary and so (as Boethius\nthe author believed) unfree. He argues that: \n\nSince it is accepted that God is omniscient, and that this implies\nthat he knows what every future event—including\nmental events such as volitions—will be, (7) and (8) each seem\nto rule out any sort of freedom of the will requisite for attributing\nmoral responsibility: a consequence the disastrous implications of\nwhich Boethius the character vividly describes. \n\n Philosophy’s answer to this difficulty is the most philosophically\nintricate and interesting section of the Consolation. It is\none part of Boethius’s work (perhaps the only one) which remains of\ninterest in contemporary philosophy (of religion) and, for that\nreason, it has often been interpreted according to a framework\nprovided by more recent thinking about the problem of divine\nprescience (see, for example, Leftow 1991, Zagzebski 1991). The\nfollowing is, rather, an attempt to present the discussion as it\nactually proceeds in the Consolation. \n\nThe first point which needs to be settled is what, precisely, is the\nproblem which Boethius the character proposes? One way of reading this\ndiscussion is that the argument here is in fact fallacious. According\nto this interpretation, the reasoning behind (7) seems to be of the\nfollowing form: \n\nThe pattern behind (8) will be similar, but in reverse: from a\nnegation of (13), the negation of (9) will be seen to follow. But, as\nit is easy to observe, (9–13) is a fallacious argument: (10) and\n(11) imply, not (12), but \n\nThe fallacy in question concerns the scope of the necessity\noperator. Boethius, the claim would be, has mistakenly inferred the (narrow-scope)\nnecessity of the consequent (‘the event will happen’),\nwhen he is entitled only to infer the (wide-scope) necessity of the\nwhole conditional (‘if someone knows an event will happen, it\nwill happen’). Boethius the character is clearly taken in by\nthis fallacious argument, and there is no good reason to think that\nBoethius the author ever became aware of the fallacy (despite a\npassage later on which some modern commentators have interpreted in\nthis sense). None the less, the discussion which follows does not, as\nthe danger seems to be, address itself to a non-problem. Intuitively,\nBoethius sees that the threat which divine prescience poses to the\ncontingency of future events arises not just from the claim that God’s\nbeliefs about the future constitute knowledge, but also from\nthe fact that they are beliefs about the future. There is a\nreal problem here, because if God knows now what I shall do tomorrow,\nthen it seems that either what I shall do is already determined, or\nelse that I shall have the power tomorrow to convert God’s knowledge\ntoday into a false belief. Although his logical formulation does not\ncapture this problem, the solution Boethius gives to Philosophy is\nclearly designed to tackle it. It is also possible to read the way that the question is posed by\nBoethius the character as not involving a fallacy (Marenbon\n2013). Boethius the character is, on this reading, putting forward a\nsort of transcendental argument. Boethius considers that when a knower\nknows a future event, as opposed to merely having opinion about it,\nthe knower is judging that the event is fixed, since if it were an\nevent that could be otherwise, it could be the object of opinion but\nnot knowledge. If future events could be otherwise, then God, in\nknowing them, would in fact be holding a false belief, since he would\nbe judging that they could not be otherwise. But God has no false\nbeliefs, and so the world must be such that his beliefs about future\nevents are not false, and so all future events must be fixed. \n\nPhilosophy identifies (V.4) the character Boethius’s central\ndifficulty as lying in the apparent incompatibility between an event’s\nnot having a necessary outcome and yet its being foreknown. To foresee\nsomething ‘as if it were certain’ when it is uncertain how\nit will turn out is ‘foreign to the integrity of\nknowledge’, since it involves ‘judging a thing as being\nother than it is.’ Philosophy counters these doubts with the\nprinciple that ‘everything that is known is grasped, not\naccording to its own power, but rather according to the capacity of\nthose who know it.’ Her view, as she develops it (in V.5 and\nV.6), is based on what might be called the Principle of Modes of\nCognition: the idea that knowledge is always relativized to different\nlevels of knowers, who have different sorts of objects of\nknowledge. This relativization is, however, limited. The same item is\nnot true for one knower and false for another, but the way in which a\ngiven item is known differs according to the powers of the\nknower. Philosophy develops this scheme in relation to the different\nlevels of the soul (intelligence, reason, imagination and the senses)\nand their different objects (pure Form, abstract universals, images,\nparticular bodily things). Philosophy does not at this point follow the most obvious path that\nthe Modes of Cognition Principle would suggest and declare that it\njust depends on the knower whether something is known as certain or\nnot. Perhaps she accepted that there is something intrinsically\nuncertain about future contingents, whoever it is that knows\nthem. Rather, she reaches her conclusion through a more complex twist\nof the argument. Philosophy argues that the temporal relation of the\nthink known to the knower—whether it is known as a past, present or\nfuture event—depends on the nature and cognitive power of the\nknower. God’s way of being and knowing, she argues, is eternal, and\ndivine eternity, she says, is not the same as just lacking a beginning\nand end, but it is rather (V.6) ‘the whole, simultaneous and\nperfect possession of unbounded life.’ \n\nA being who is eternal in this way, Philosophy argues, knows all\nthings—past, present and future—in the same way as we, who\nlive in time and not eternity, know what is present. Since, therefore,\ncontingent events that are future to us are present in relation to\nGod, there is no reason why God should not know them as certain. But,\nif they can be known as certain, are they really contingent? The last\npart of Philosophy’s argument deals with this problem by accepting\nthat, as known by God in his eternal present, events are not\ncontingent, but necessary in a special way that does not involve any\nconstraint or limitation of freedom.  There are, she explains, two\nsorts of necessity: simple and conditional. Simple necessities are\nwhat would now be called physical or nomic necessities: that the sun\nrises, or that a man will sometime die. By contrast, it is\nconditionally necessary that, for instance, I am\nwalking, when I am walking (or when someone sees that I am\nwalking); but from this conditional necessity it does not follow that\nit is simply necessary that I am walking. Although a number of modern\ncommentators interpret this passage as Philosophy’s way of noticing\nthe scope-distinction fallacy in the original way Boethius the\ncharacter presents the problem, she really seems to be making a rather\ndifferent point. On an Aristotelian understanding of modality, which\nBoethius the author accepted, the present is necessary: ‘what\nis, necessarily is, when it is’ (On Interpretation\n19a23). Philosophy is arguing that, since God knows all things as if\nthey were present, future events are necessary, in relation to their\nbeing known by God, in just the way that anything which is presently\nthe case is necessary. And this necessity of the present is an\nunconstraining necessity—those who accepted Aristotelian\nmodalities did not think that because, when I am sitting, I am sitting\nnecessarily, my freedom to stand has been at all curtailed. Indeed, as\nPhilosophy stresses, in themselves the future events remain completely\nfree. Philosophy is thus able to explain how, as known by God, future\ncontingent events have the certainty which make them proper objects of\nknowledge, rather than opinion, whilst nevertheless retaining their\nindeterminacy. \n\nIt is important to add, however, that most contemporary interpreters\ndo not read the argument of V.3–6 in quite this way. (For a\nbalanced assessment of various interpretations, including the one\noffered here, see Sharples 2009). They hold that Philosophy is arguing\nthat God is atemporal, so eliminating the problems about determinism,\nwhich arise when God’s knowing future contingents is seen an event in\nthe past, and therefore, fixed. \n\nHowever it is interpreted, Philosophy’s argument takes a surprising\nturn at the very end of the book. When he gave his initial statement\nof the problem, Boethius the character had distinguished the problem\nat issue—that of divine prescience—from that of divine\npredetermination. He had explained (V.3) that, for the purposes of\ntheir discussion, he was assuming that God does not cause the events\nhe foreknows: he knows them because they happen, rather than their\nhappening because he foreknows them. He added, though, in passing,\nthat he did not really accept this view: it is ‘back to\nfront’ to think that ‘the outcome of things in time should\nbe the cause of eternal prescience.’ Philosophy now returns to\nthis point, conceding that God’s act of knowing ‘sets the\nmeasure for all things and owes nothing to things which follow on from\nit.’ Although Philosophy considers that she has successfully\nresolved the character Boethius’s problems, the reader is left asking\nwhether this final concession, which makes God the determiner of all\nevents, does not ruin the elaborate defence of the contingency of\nhuman volitions she has just been mounting. \n\nOne, perfectly plausible, way of reading the Consolation is to\ntake it, as most philosophical works are taken, at face value. On this\nreading, Philosophy is recognized as a clearly authoritative figure,\nwhose teaching should not be doubted and whose success in consoling\nthe character Boethius must be assumed to be complete. The apparent\nchanges of direction noted in \n Section 5 \n will be taken either as stages in Boethius’s re-education or as\nunintended effects of the author’s wish to make this work into a\ncompendium of a syncretistic philosophical system, and Philosophy’s\nown view that she has resolved the problem of prescience will be\naccepted as that of Boethius the author. \n\n Yet there are a number of reasons which suggest that Boethius’s\nintention as an author was more complex. First, it would have been\nhard for his intended audience of educated Christians to ignore the\nfact that in this dialogue a Christian, Boethius, is being instructed\nby a figure who clearly represents the tradition of pagan Philosophy,\nand who proposes some positions (on the World Soul in III m.9, and on\nthe sempiternity of the world in V.6) which most Christians would have\nfound dubious. Boethius the character says nothing which is explicitly\nChristian, but when in III.12 Philosophy says, echoing the words of\nWisdom viii, 1 that ‘it is the highest good that rules all\nthings strongly and disposes them sweetly’, he expresses his\ndelight not just in what she has said but much more ‘in those\nvery words’ that she uses—a broad hint to the reader that\nhe remembers his Christian identity even in the midst of his\nphilosophical instruction. \n\n Second, the genre Boethius chose for the Consolation, that\nof the prosimetrum or Menippean satire, was associated with works\nwhich ridicule the pretensions of authoritative claims to\nwisdom. Elements of satire on the claims of learning are present even\nin the vast, encyclopaedic Marriage of Mercury and Philology\nby the fifth-century author Martianus Capella, which Boethius clearly\nknew. Ancient authors thought carefully about genres, and it is hard\nto think that Boethius’s choice was not a hint that Philosophy’s\nauthority is not to be taken as complete. And, third, in the light of\nthese two considerations, the changes of direction, incoherencies and\nultimate failure of the long argument about prescience, when the\nquestion is suddenly recast as one about predestination, all suggest\nthemselves as intentional features, for which the interpreter must\naccount. \n\nSome recent interpreters, such as Joel Relihan (1993, 187–194;\n2007), have gone so far as to suggest that the Consolation \nshould be understood ironically as an account of the insufficiency of\nPhilosophy (and philosophy) to provide consolation, by contrast with\nChristian faith. Such a view seems too extreme, because Boethius the\nauthor has clearly taken great pains with the philosophical arguments\nproposed in the text, and the main lines of Philosophy’s thinking fit\nwell with the metaphysics glimpsed in the theological tractates and\neven, at moments, in the logical commentaries. It is plausible,\nhowever, to hold that Boethius wished, whilst acknowledging the value\nof philosophy—to which he had devoted his life, and for which he\npresented himself as being about to die—to point its\nlimitations: limitations which Philosophy herself, who is keen to\nemphasize that she is not divine, accepts. Philosophy, he might be\nsuggesting, provides arguments and solutions to problems which should\nbe accepted and it teaches a way of living that should be followed,\nbut it falls short of providing a coherent and comprehensive\nunderstanding of God and his relation to creatures. Boethius the\ncharacter should be satisfied, but not completely satisfied, by\nPhilosophy’s argument. And if this is Boethius the author’s position\nin the Consolation, then it fits closely with the theological\nmethod he pioneered in the opuscula sacra. \n\nThe influence of each area of Boethius’s philosophical writing was\nvast in the Middle Ages. Along with Augustine and Aristotle, he is\nthe fundamental philosophical and theological author in the\nLatin tradition. \n\n In logic, Boethius’s translations of Aristotle and Porphyry (except\nfor that of the Posterior Analytics, which was lost) remained\nstandard throughout the Middle Ages. His commentaries—especially\nthat on the Categories, the second commentary on the\nIsagoge and the second, more advanced commentary on On\nInterpretation—were the main instruments by which logicians\nfrom the ninth to the twelfth centuries came to understand the\nAristotelian texts he had translated, and to grapple with their\nproblems and the wider range of related philosophical issues raised by\nthe late ancient tradition. Even twelfth-century philosophers as\nindependently-minded as Abelard and Gilbert of Poitiers were deeply\nindebted to these commentaries. The logical text-books were equally\nimportant. Before the Prior Analytics became generally\navailable in the later twelfth century, students learned syllogistic\nfrom Boethius’s monographs on it. The theory of topical argument,\nacquired especially from On Topical Differentiae, provided a\nframework for twelfth-century philosophers in propounding and\nanalysing arguments, and from the combination of studying topical\nargument and the theory of hypothetical syllogisms as Boethius\npresented it, Abelard was led towards his rediscovery of propositional\nlogic (cf. Martin (1987)). From the thirteenth century, onwards,\nhowever, both Boethius’s commentaries and his treatises became less\ninfluential. On Topical Differentiae, and On\nDivision, continued to be studied, but not the treatises on\ncategorical and hypothetical syllogisms. Users of the commentaries\nwere infrequent, but they include Thomas Aquinas. \n\nThe theological treatises were probably already known by the pupils of\nAlcuin at the court of Charlemagne around 800, and a tradition of\nglosses to the text probably goes back to the School of Auxerre in the\nlater ninth century. The opuscula sacra provided a model for\nearly medieval thinkers who wanted to use their logical training in\nthinking about Christian doctrine. Anselm was certainly aware of them,\nthough he looked more closely to Augustine; Abelard’s first\ntheological work, the Theologia Summi Boni, despite its\noriginality, is clearly inspired by Boethius’s first treatise (on the\nTrinity). In the 1140s, Gilbert of Poitiers expounded his metaphysics\nand his view of theology in a detailed exegesis of the opuscula\nsacra, which came to be the standard commentary, although the\ntreatises were also commented on by other, more Platonically-minded\ntwelfth-century scholars. Although the opuscula sacra were\nnot formally a part of the theology curriculum in most later medieval\nuniversities, they continued to be studied, and Aquinas wrote\ncommentaries on Treatises I and III. \n\n Though the influence of these other works was great, the popularity and\nimportance of the Consolation far exceeded it. The text\nalready echoes in what must be one of the earliest pieces of genuinely\nmedieval Latin philosophy, the little treatise ‘On True\nPhilosophy’ with which Alcuin prefaced his De grammatica, and\nit remained a favourite through the later Middle Ages and into the\nRenaissance. Not until the time of Gibbon had it been reduced to an\nobject of the historian’s condescending admiration. One measure of the\nextent and character of its readership is the translations, not merely\ninto almost every medieval vernacular, but also into Greek and even\nHebrew. Among the translators were two of the greatest vernacular\nwriters of the whole epoch: Jean de Meun, who put the Consolation\n into Old French in the later thirteenth century, and Chaucer,\nwho translated it into Middle English about a century later. As their\ninvolvement suggests, Boethius’s dialogue was a text which popularized\nphilosophy outside the universities, and its literary features, as\nwell as its arguments, inspired imitations and creative adaptations,\nfrom Alain of Lille’s De planctu Naturae (‘Nature’s\nLament’) to, more distantly, Dante’s Convivio and even\nChaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde. Philosophers and theologians,\ntoo, used the work; it was part of the school syllabus from the ninth\nto the twelfth centuries, and although Aristotle’s treatises left no\nroom for it in the university curriculum, it continued to be studied\nby students and teachers there. For example, Aquinas’s account of the\nhighest good in his Summa Theologiae IaIIe builds on the\nConsolation, and the definition of eternity given by\nPhilosophy in Book V became the starting-point for almost every later\nmedieval discussion of God and time. \n\nThe Consolation had many medieval commentaries—mostly\non the whole text, although some just examined Book III, m. 9. In the\ntenth and eleventh centuries, the commentary written by Remigius of\nAuxerre was the most widely read (and often adapted). William of\nConches’s commentary, written in the 1120s, became standard in the\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries and the commentary by the English\nDominican, Nicholas Trivet, from the beginning of the fourteenth\ncentury, was the most popular in the late Middle Ages. One of the\ncentral problems which faced any commentator was the relation of the\ntext to Christian teaching. Remigius and, in a subtler way, William\nboth took Boethius, whom they knew to be a Christian, to be putting\nforward Christian doctrine without seeming to do so; Trivet’s approach\nis less syncretistic, although he finds nothing unacceptable for\nChristians in the Consolation. \n\nThe preceding paragraphs in this section might seem to indicate that\nthere is no doubt about Boethius’s importance as a philosopher. Yet\nthe very size of his medieval influence has led to an attitude,\nwidespread among historians of philosophy (see especially Courcelle\n(1967)), which makes Boethius almost disappear as a figure in his own\nright. He is seen, rather, as a conduit through which Greek\nphilosophical ideas were transmitted to the Latin tradition. Of\ncourse, one aspect of Boethius’s influence is indeed that he made\navailable ideas and arguments deriving from Plato, Aristotle,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry and Iamblichus. But he was also an\nindividual thinker, with pronounced tastes and views, no less (if no\nmore) original than his Greek contemporaries; and also, in the\nConsolation, one of the rare philosophers whose thought, like\nPlato’s, cannot be neatly separated from the complex literary form in\nwhich it is expressed.","contact.mail":"jm258@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"}]
