This topic has become a central area of inquiry for\nestablished literatures including political philosophy, international\nrelations (IR), international law, and sociology. Along with global\njustice, global democracy has also been critical to the emergence of\ninternational political theory as a discrete literature in recent\ndecades. Whereas global justice scholars tend to focus on how burdens\nand benefits should be distributed by international institutions,\nglobal democrats probe how political power can be legitimated beyond\nthe nation-state. Global democracy is therefore concerned with how\ntransnational decision-making can be justified and who should be\nentitled to participate in the formation of global rules, laws, and\nregulations.\n\n\n\nThis short entry contains four sections which elaborate upon the\npossibility and problems for global democracy. The first discusses how\nglobalization impacts upon the nation-state and what this means for\ntraditional conceptions of democracy. The notion of a global\ndemocratic deficit—in which individuals are removed from\ntransnational decision-making in problematic ways—is introduced,\nand reasons to pursue global democracy are fleshed out. The second\nsection outlines some prominent normative proposals for global\ndemocracy. Specifically, five ‘models of global democracy’\nare presented and some general criticisms are formulated. The third\nsection then highlights the recent turn toward pursuing ‘values\nof democratization’. This new direction for the literature has\nboth methodological and substantive implications. The final section\nhighlights persistent criticisms that should be addressed in future\nresearch on global democracy.\n\n\n\nA review of global democracy must begin with how globalization has\nimpacted the nation-state and the consequences for national democracy\n(Bray and Slaughter 2014). Although volumes have been written about\nthe theory and practice of democracy, the concept remains difficult to\ndefine. Etymologically the term is simple enough: democracy means rule\nby the people (demos meaning ‘people’ and\nkratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’).\nThis basic definition can be extrapolated in many different ways. At\nits core, however, most scholars agree that democracy refers to a\npolitical practice in which individuals govern themselves through some\nform of equitable decision-making process. This leaves open two\nfundamental issues: who constitutes ‘the people’ and how\n‘rule-making’ should occur. \n\nHistorically, democracy first took hold in the ancient city states of\nMesopotamia and Greece through direct mechanisms such as sortition\n(Keane 2009). Since the 18th Century, though, the ideal of\ndemocracy has become wedded to rise of the nation-state. The modern\nstate is a distinctive form of political organization based on\nsovereign autonomy over a delimited territory and population. Through\na centrally organized government, the state wields a monopoly over the\nlegitimate use of violence as well as the right to taxation (Giddens\n1985). In exchange for these coercive powers, the state generates its\nlegitimacy through democratic mechanisms: giving its citizenry equal\nsay in how national laws and public policy are formed. \n\nNational democracy is typically institutionalized as a representative\nsystem that involves competitive elections and a publicly determined\nrule of law. Although there are many different national voting systems\n(majority rule, proportional representation, etc.), the basic idea is\nthat each enfranchised citizen of the state has one vote at the ballot\nbox and can thus freely choose their preferred representative, leader,\nor party. Through the American and French Revolutions, and the\n‘Third Wave of Democratization’ (where representative\ndemocracy spread to Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, and the Eastern\nbloc), the notion that the nation-state is the natural container for\ndemocracy became dominant (Huntington 1991). Over time, then,\n‘the people’ in democracy has been assumed to correspond\nneatly with the citizenry of each particular nation-state. \n\nIn recent years, however, the supposed alliance between democracy and\nthe nation-state has come unstuck. This is due predominantly to\nglobalization: the increased extent, velocity, and scope of\ncross-border interactions, transactions, and relations (Scholte 2000).\nGlobalization intensifies social, political, and economic relations\nthrough technological changes and the flow of people, resources and\nideas across state lines. The expansion of global connections has gone\nhand-in-glove with increased efforts to govern global affairs.\nCountless formal measures, informal norms and overarching discourses\nfor regulating global affairs are now formulated and implemented\nthrough complex transnational networks that combine substate agencies,\nnation-states, regional bodies, global institutions, and non-state\nactors (Scholte 2014, 4). Although the state is often an active\nparticipant in globalization, many scholars have argued that increased\ntransnational activity undermines national democracy (Sassen 2003).\nGlobalization pierces the sovereignty of nation-states by subjecting\ndomestic affairs to transnational decision-making. Moreover, citizens\nof each state are often said to be problematically excluded from\nglobal activities in ways that lead to a democratic deficit (expanded\nupon below). \n\nThe array of transnational institutions that govern social, political,\nand economic processes is bewildering. Formal institutions include\ninternational organizations (IO), intergovernmental organizations\n(IGO), non-governmental organizations (NGO), and private bodies\n(Tallberg et al. 2013). Informal institutions include epistemic\ncommunities, transnational networks, and the basic structure of\ntransnational norms that make the world ‘hang together’\n(Ruggie 1998). \n\nAs the number of these transnational institutions has increased with\nglobalization, so too has their capacity to exercise authority\n(Zürn et al. 2012). Many scholars have noted that this authority\noften enables international institutions to wield pervasive forms of\npublic power that impact (and potentially constrain) the lives\nof individuals (Macdonald 2008). This occurs through international\nlaw-making, regulatory standard-setting, and the promotion of new\nnorms. As decisions are taken outside the state, national leaders are\nunable to control the forces which impact domestic institutions and\ncitizens. Correspondingly, and resultantly, individuals within each\nstate have no direct say in how global rules are forged. This\nundermines the notion that individuals can collectively govern their\njoint affairs. This gap—between individual rule-takers and\ntransnational rule-makers—is referred to as the global\ndemocratic deficit. \n\nThe global democratic deficit is compounded by at least three\nadditional factors. First is an issue of procedure: international\nbodies often operate with unaccountable and non-transparent processes.\nThis makes it difficult to identify the steps in a causal chain which\nlink transnational rule-makers with rule-takers. The second factor is\nscope: current arrangements of transnational institutions seem\nincapable of tackling the most pressing issues of a globalizing world\n—climate change, spread of infectious diseases, volatile\nfinancial markets, enormous poverty rates, unjust supply chains, just\nto name a few. Third is an issue of constituency: globalization is\nactually reshaping who constitutes ‘the people’ due\ndemocratic standing in decision-making processes. As Andrew Linklater\n(1998) notes, globalization generates postnational communities of fate\nnot based on national boundaries but upon shared problems and mutual\nallegiances. \n\nThis final point bears emphasis because it has (re-)ignited debates\nin democratic theory over the so-called ‘boundary problem’:\nwho is entitled to take part in democratic decision-making processes\n(Agné 2006)? This question is often thought to be paradoxical\nbecause democratic theory offers no internal solution for delineating\n‘the people’: unless we already know who is eligible to\nparticipate in democratic procedures, we do not know who to include in\nthe initial decision-making process. As globalization erodes the idea\nthat the citizenry represents a natural embodiment of ‘the\npeople’, we need to search for alternate ways to justify\ndemocratic inclusion. \n\nAlthough a full survey is neither possible nor necessary here, two\nprominent responses have been advocated in the literature (Goodin\n2007). First, all individuals subjected to rules, laws, and\nregulations should take part in writing those rules. Second, all\nindividuals significantly affected by a decision-making\nprocess should have an equal say in how that power is exercised. While\nthese two positions provide a basis for delineating the people in a\nglobalizing world, there are clear differences between them. The former\nis relatively narrow: only individuals to whom rules actually apply\nshould be part of the decision-making. By contrast, the latter is much\nbroader: global decisions often have wide-reaching and indirect\nconsequences beyond those subjected. To take a simple example:\nindividuals in a country not a member of the WTO are not\nsubjected to WTO rules, but they are affected by the\ngeneral system of international tariffs that the WTO regulates. Should\nthese individuals be entitled to a democratic right of participation in\nWTO decisions? From this, we can see that whether we chose\nsubjectedness or affectedness matters because each criterion entails a\nsignificantly different domain of democratic inclusion. As such,\nfurther research is required to shed light on how, or even if, the\nboundary problem can be resolved, and its implications for global\ndemocracy. \n\nGlobal democrats thus share the view that individuals should\ncollectively rule themselves. To the extent that decision-making power\nmigrates beyond the state, democracy should follow. There is, of\ncourse, a prior question about why individuals should have roughly\nequal say in decision-making in the first place. On one level, it is a\nsimple definitional requirement of democracy. But this point simply\nbegs the question: why should we pursue democracy at all? As with\ntheoretical discussions of democracy, a variety of intrinsic and\ninstrumental reasons for global democracy can be discerned in the\nliterature. Intrinsic justifications point to democracy as a valuable\nmethod of decision-making in-and-of-itself. Instrumental claims hinge\nupon the outcome of democracy being beneficial, especially compared to\nalternatives. \n\nThe most common intrinsic claim relates to cosmopolitanism, which\nmany proponents of global democracy have drawn upon as a moral\nfoundation motivating the project (Kant 1991[1795]). Thomas Pogge\n(1992: 48–9) has argued that cosmopolitans share at least this set of\nbeliefs: 1) that human beings are the ultimate units of moral concern;\n2) this status applies to all humans equally; 3) everyone should be\ntreated as ultimate units of concern by all others. Global democracy\nhelps realize this cosmopolitan ideal by treating all individuals as\nmoral beings capable of exercising equal control over shared destinies.\nIt is important to note, however, that differences between global\ndemocrats exist in terms of the scope of their cosmopolitan commitment.\nWhile almost all global democrats see individuals as the fundamental\nobject of concern, many proponents argue that relational qualities\nstill matter in generating normative prescriptions (Miller 1995). As\nsuch, ‘national communities’ or ‘humanity’ may\nwell be important groups that deserve standing in global democratic\npolitics for moral or pragmatic\nreasons. \n\nSeveral other intrinsic arguments, though, have been made in\nliterature. These claims all suggest that global democracy is morally\ndesirable irrespective of the benefits generated. For instance, many\nscholars have suggested that global democracy embodies equality,\nautonomy, non-domination, and human rights (see respectively: Erman\n2012; Held 1995; Bohman 2007; Goodhart 2008). These fundamental rights\nshould be valued for their own sake and therefore provide an additional\nmoral foundation—related to, but sometimes distinct from,\ncosmopolitanism—for pursuing democracy beyond borders. These\narguments are most common amongst liberal democrats and neo-Roman\nrepublicans (Pettit 1997). \n\nOther scholars put instrumental considerations at the fore. In this\nvein, proponents have maintained that global democracy is required for\nepistemic, problem-solving, justice, and legitimacy-based reasons. John\nDryzek (2000) has noted that democracy enables a wide-variety of\nperspectives to shape policy and thus increases the chances of making\nthe ‘correct’ decision (see also Landemore 2013).\nSimilarly, scholars in the pragmatist tradition of John Dewey have\nsuggested that global democracy is required to generate compliance with\ninternational rules and thus solve collective action problems such as\nclimate change (Bray 2013). By participating in the formation of\nlaw-making, individuals are more likely to comply with the agreement.\nLaura Valentini (2012) has claimed that global democracy is required\nfor global justice. Democratic mechanisms need to be in place to sort\nout reasonable disagreements as to how resources should be allocated.\nFinally, Michael Zürn and his co-authors (2012) suggest that\nglobal democratic procedures can help provide IOs with important stocks\nof sociological legitimacy and hence avoid complications of\npoliticization (see also Buchanan and Keohane 2006). \n\nThere are many different proposals for global democracy and,\ncorrespondingly, many different taxonomical divisions have been\ndeveloped. For instance, Scholte (2014) divides the literature into\n‘statist’ and ‘modern cosmopolitan’ approaches.\nArchibugi et al. (2012, 7) suggest a tripartite (ideal-typical) break\nbetween federalist (world state), confederalist (intergovernmental\ndemocratic states), and polycentric (pluralist) prescriptions for\nglobal democracy. And Gráinne de Búrca (2008, 117)\nidentifies three strands in the current literature to which she affixes\nthe nomenclature of a ‘denial approach,’ a ‘wishful\nthinking approach,’ and a ‘compensatory approach.’\nThis entry takes a different tack by presenting five different\n‘models’ of global democracy. Models represent idealized\ntheoretical constructions designed to express the normative qualities\nof a democratic system as well as its constitutive institutions. Models\ntend to fit together as whole pieces, and are thus relatively discrete\nand well-developed proposals. The following subsections outline five\nprominent models. Specific attention is paid to the normative\nunderpinnings, institutional design, and problems of feasibility and\ndesirability associated with each model. \n\nProponents of this model contend that world politics is democratic\nto the extent that each sovereign state is internally democratic with a\nfunctioning government and rule of law. Citizens thus have democratic\nrepresentation beyond the state through their national government. This\ntradition has been developed and continued by Immanuel Kant, Robert\nDahl, Ingeborg Maus, John Rawls, and many others. The crucial normative\nideal underpinning this model is liberal and cosmopolitan in\norientation: all individuals deserve an equal chance to participate in\nthe rule-making that governs their lives. This is necessary for\ncitizens to have liberty and self-determination. Unlike other\ncosmopolitans, though, these theorists argue that the nation-state\nplays a key normative and practical role in global democracy. \n\nBefitting a model that has a long history in democratic thought,\ndifferent institutional designs have been offered. In Perpetual\nPeace, for instance, Kant (1991 [1795]) argued for a global\nfederation of peoples composed of republican (i.e. democratic) states.\nIn this federation, states would observe a cosmopolitan right to\nhospitality, aid, and territory. John Rawls (1999) similarly advocated\nan international ‘law of peoples’ in which liberal\ndemocratic states (and decent states) establish international laws that\ngenerate a peaceful and tolerant international order. Some scholars in\nthis line, such as Robert Keohane, Andrew Moravcsik, and Stephen Macedo\n(2009), have gone even further and suggested that IOs can help keep\npeace between states (a core Kantian claim), and safeguard democracy,\ndeliberation, and human rights. Transnational activities are\ndemocratically legitimate from the perspective of citizens so long as\neach nation-state maintains autonomy and sovereignty in global affairs.\nThis allows supranational competences to be controlled and even revoked\nby member-states and their leaders (Zürn 2000). \n\nAlthough this model has been prominent in the global democracy\nfield, it has several problems. First, only around 50 per cent of\nnation-states today are democratic. As such, much of the world’s\npopulation is without democratic representation at either the national\nor transnational level. Second, nation-states do not have complete\ncontrol over international institutions. IR scholars increasingly note\nthat IOs, which are delegated authority from nation-states, suffer from\n‘agency slack’. This means that actors within IOs\n(diplomats, bureaucrats, and so on) are able to carve out their own\nspace for action. This power cannot easily be controlled or recaptured\nby member-states. Finally, transnational networks and private forms of\ngovernance have proliferated beyond the state. These agents often have\nthe capacity to create global regulations which impact on domestic\ncitizens. Nation-states typically have no direct say in these bodies.\nAs such, the intergovernmental model provides many interesting\ninsights, but has failed to keep pace with empirical developments. \n\nCosmopolitan democracy is perhaps the most well-known model of\nglobal democracy. The core idea is to lift statist institutions to the\nglobal level in an on-going effort for democratization. David Held,\nDaniele Archibugi, and Simon Caney have all been prominent advocates.\nNormatively, the model rests on a foundation of autonomy: creating\nglobal political conditions that allow individuals to shape and direct\ntheir own lives. This requires, at the least, a system which protects\nhuman rights and provides democratic mechanisms for citizen input\n(Goodhart 2005). This model is also explicitly cosmopolitan as it is\nsupposed to apply to all individuals across the globe. \n\nInstitutionally, cosmopolitan democracy stops short of a fully-fledged\nworld government. As David Held (2003, 478) notes, “a\ncosmopolitan polity does not call for a diminution per se of\nstate power and capacity across the globe. Rather it seeks to entrench\nand develop political institutions at regional and global level as\nnecessary complements to those at the level of the state.” This\noccurs by replicating national democratic institutions at the\ntransnational and global levels, such as the creation of a global\nparliamentary assembly, international courts, and a constitutional\nrule of law (Falk and Strauss 2001; Goodin 2010). These institutions\nprovide a framework to shield human rights and exercise individual\nautonomy by voting in global elections. Moreover, these institutions\nare charged with effectively regulating transnational problems that\nnational institutions cannot tackle alone: climate change, the\ndiffusion of nuclear weapons, and financial markets. This particular\nmodel has given rise to a long-running campaign for the creation of a\nUnited Nations Parliamentary Assembly (see Other Internet Resources\nsection).\n \n\nThis model is also not without complication. First, the proposals are\noften thought to be infeasible. By this, critics usually mean that\nthere is a lack of political will to establish organizations such as a\nglobal parliament which would remove some sovereign powers from\nnation-states. Although Held (1995) and Archibugi (2008) often claim\nthat cosmopolitan democracy should be separated into short-term\ntargets and longer-term ideals, it is not always clear which agents\nwould pursue the model nor how current institutional arrangements\ncould be overcome (though see Archibugi and Held (2011) for some\nsuggestions).  Would the IMF, the World Bank, or the International\nAccounting Standards Board, for example, readily give up their control\nover global financial governance? Some critics also charge the\ncosmopolitan model with being undesirable. Although the project is\ndesigned to reduce the global democratic deficit, it does so by\nreproducing liberal democratic institutions beyond the\nstate. Postcolonial arguments have been made against this reliance on\nliberal institutions which represent a specific form of (Western)\ndemocracy that emerged from Europe and the United State (Scholte\n2014). \n\nA world government has also been seen as a potential response to the\nglobal democratic deficit. Scholarship on world government has a long\nhistory in academia and social commentary: Hugo Grotius, Jeremy\nBentham and Abbé de Saint-Pierre in the former camp; Albert\nEinstein, HG Wells, and Martin Luther King in the latter. Recently,\nthe concept has seen a revival in the work of Luis Cabrera (2004),\nAndrew Kuper (2004), Torbjörn Tännsjö (2008), and\nJürgen Habermas (2006). World government proposals are justified\nin terms of both intrinsic and instrumental concerns. On the intrinsic\nside, world government advocates take a cosmopolitan stance and demand\nequal respect for all individuals. As such, individuals should have\nequal say in how transnational rules are formed to reduce the global\ndemocratic deficit. This intrinsic claim is often coupled with\njustice-based arguments concerning a fairer distribution of resources\n(Marchetti 2008). On the instrumental side, those such as\nTännsjö (2008) contend that a world government is necessary\nto overcome global problems such as war and ecological disaster. \n\nWorld government proponents seek a highly centralized and federal\nglobal system. As Cabrera (2004, 71) notes, a world government would\nrequire a “restructuring of the global system to bring states\nunder the authority of just supranational institutions.” A\ncentral government would sit at the core with autonomous and coercive\ndecision-making potential. As with cosmopolitan democracy, a world\ngovernment would also entail a directly-elected global parliament,\nempowered courts, and a singular global constitution which explicates\nbasic rights and duties for all. In many cases, proponents stipulate\nthat a world government could come about through a major recalibration\nof the United Nations General Assembly. Famously, Habermas has also\nargued for a three-tiered hierarchical global system in which\nsupranational, transnational, and national institutions are\nimplemented to secure rights, peace, and global democracy. Although\nHabermas might deny advocating a world government, William Scheuerman\n(2008, 148) argues that Habermas’s attempt to pursue stronger\nsupranational governance combined with a global constitution would\nhave that result. \n\nDespite Alexander Wendt’s (2003) teleological claim that a world\ngovernment is ‘inevitable’, many people deride the concept\nas infeasible. Without another major crisis (such as a world war) to\nprompt international action, it is difficult to envisage why states\nwould readily give sovereign power to a global state and who precisely\nwould take the lead in this process. Although UN reform is often cited\nas one pathway forward, the veto position held in the Security Council\nby the United States, China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom\nundermines that option. From the perspective of desirability,\nmoreover, opponents have argued that a world government would actually\nexacerbate the global democratic deficit. For example, Kant argued\nthat a world government would become a ‘soulless\ndespotism’ as global leaders abused their power without\nappropriate checks and balances. Other scholars have also suggested a\nworld government—in which citizens have one vote from a\nconstituency of seven billion—would be essentially meaningless\nand not enable individuals to participate meaningfully in their\ncollective governance. \n\nGlobal democracy scholarship has also been infused by myriad\ndeliberative democratic proposals. This model suggests that global\npolitics can be democratized by pursuing deliberation—the give\nand take of non-coercive and reasoned arguments—in various\nformal and informal sites. A vast number of authors have promoted this\nmodel, including John Dryzek, Seyla Benhabib, Karin Bäckstrand,\nand James Bohman. The fundamental normative ideal is that\nnon-coercive, reciprocal, and generalizable deliberation should guide\naction, and that decision-making be justified to those affected (Forst\n2011). Individuals should be free to put their ideas forward under\negalitarian conditions, take on-board the ideas of others, and\nrecalibrate preferences in line with ‘better\narguments’. This helps to respect the autonomy of different\nagents while also enhancing the epistemic quality of\ndecision-making. This model has clear connections with a\n‘stakeholder model’ of global democracy, in which those\nindividuals significantly affected by a global decision should be able\nto deliberate over how public power is exercised and how power\nwielders are held to account (Macdonald 2008). \n\nThis model seeks the deliberative democratization of informal and\nformal sites of existing governance arrangements from the\nlocal to the global level. As such, the institutional design task is\nusually about recalibrating current institutions and organizations to\nreflect non-coercive argumentation rather than creating new bodies. At\nthe informal level, some deliberative democrats point to transnational\npublic spheres as appropriate sites for democratic agency (Steffek\n2010). Indeed, some claim that a global civil society has emerged\nwhich provides a space—separate from the state and the\nmarket—for individuals to deliberate, shape preferences, and\ncreate shared goals (Dryzek 2000). The model also calls for the\ndeliberation democratization of formal sites, such as WTO\nnegotiations, IMF loan deals, and regional treaty agreements\n(Bäckstrand 2006). By making negotiations more\ndeliberative—responsive to the reasoned arguments of affected\nindividuals—world politics becomes more democratic. At the\nintersection of formal and informal proposals, deliberative democrats\noften point to the increasing inclusion of non-state actors in formal\norganizations as a step toward global democracy (Dryzek 2012). As\nNGOs, youth groups, epistemic communities, and business organizations\ngain access to sites of international decision-making, this helps\nincrease the diversity of viewpoints and provides non-state groups\nwith a way to contest traditional IGO negotiations (Tallberg et\nal. 2013). Many actors in global civil society have accused IOs of\nsuffering from a democratic deficit as a strategy to gain\ninclusion. This highlights the interconnections between academia and\npolicy practice in terms of global democracy. \n\nGlobal deliberative democracy has had many proponents and even more\ncritics. A fairly standard complaint is that the model fails to\nprovide a specific institutional design which can be sought or\nrealized under existing conditions. Moreover, deliberation is said to\nsuffer from a lack of decisiveness. Voting mechanisms always allow for\nindividuals to cast their preferences with the understanding that 50\nper cent plus one vote wins the election. Deliberation provides no\nmechanism for groups to make definitive decisions, and talking until\nagreement (consensus) is reached is both time-consuming and\npotentially unrealizable. In terms of desirability, Eva Erman (2012)\nhas argued that deliberative democrats do not take the notion of\nequality seriously enough, thus undermining a core ideal of\ndemocracy. It is difficult to envisage, Erman suggests, how\nindividuals can have equal opportunity for deliberation in a world of\ninequality. Relatedly, the inclusion of non-state actors in formal IOs\nis often seen as a form of cooptation in which civil society actually\nworks in subservience to (and thus legitimates) the established\nsystem. This line of criticism could be classified as a\n‘governmentality’ critique in the tradition of\nFoucault. As such, there is a concern that including civil society in\ndeliberation with formal sites of global decision-making\nexacerbates—rather than reduces—the global democratic\ndeficit. \n\nThis model is grounded in an ethics of revolution, in which\nautonomous, self-governing communities can resist and overthrow the\nglobal system of sovereignty and its hierarchical capitalist relations\n(Bray and Slaughter forthcoming, 158). Variants on this position have\nbeen promoted by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Chantal Mouffe, and\nJan Aart Scholte. The fundamental normative claim is that collectives\ncan only be emancipated through the rejection of capitalism, property\nrights, and class-based notions of governance. In other words, these\nstructures create systems of domination and alienation that need to be\novercome. According to Hardt and Negri (2000), communities and social\nmovements should challenge the current liberal order of politics and\nseek new forms of global governance based on cooperation, affection,\nand nature. This model has close connections with direct forms of\ndemocracy. \n\nThe institutional design of radical democracy is, almost by\ndefinition, underspecified. Proponents argue against the existing\nglobal system in which sovereignty has been eclipsed by empire: the\nsubservience of politics to capitalism. It is therefore up to\ncollectives to overhaul current arrangements and establish new forms\nof governance, the design of which can only emerge through the process\nof reconstruction itself.  Both Chantal Mouffe (2009) and Jan Aart\nScholte (2014) are clear that radical democracy entails the rejection\nof Western, liberal democratic institutions (such as parliaments and\nconstitutions) and their reliance on individualism and\ncapitalism. Rather, Scholte (2014) argues that we should open up our\nconception of how global democracy should look to take due\nconsideration of transscalarity, plural solidarities,\ntransculturality, egalitarian distribution, and ecology that\nconstitute social and material life. \n\nIn terms of feasibility, it is difficult to know how radical global\ndemocracy might come about. Although we can point at potential\nexamples—such as the Occupy Wall Street movement or the\nZapatista Army—concrete institutional moments are difficult to\ncome by. Moreover, radical democrats are often quick to note that\nglobalization has been coopted by capitalism, and that it reinforces\ncolonial legacies in developing countries. It is hard to comprehend\nhow collectives of free and equal individuals can form in a\ntransnational context where much of the global South is removed from\nthe technological and communicative benefits of\nglobalization. Paradoxically, then, the groups most in need of\ndemocratic revolution are precisely those groups with less access to\nmeans of transnational activism (the Internet, attending global\nprotests, signing petitions, etc.). Finally, on the issue of\ndesirability, there is little guarantee that a revolution will lead to\na better state of global democracy. Revolutions are by definition\ndisruptive, and although capitalism comes with many problems, it is\nconceivable that the revolutionary outcome of radical democracy may be\nmore deleterious than the current state of affairs. \n\nThe preceding five models provide a brief schematic of how global\ndemocracy proposals have typically been crafted in the academic\nliterature. In the recent few years, however, global democratic\ndebates have taken a turn away from ‘models’ toward\n‘values of democratization’. This section outlines the\ncore impetus behind this turn and its methodological foundation, and\nthen discusses several prominent examples in the literature. \n\nDemocratic models, as should be clear, provide relatively\nparsimonious, holistic, and idealized packages that can be pursued at\nthe global level. Archibugi et al. (2012) describe them as\n‘terminal endpoints’ that can be strived toward. Although\nsome models provide more detailed and exact institutional design than\nothers, this general way of thinking has dominated global democracy\nscholarship. However, as Dryzek (2008, 471) has contended, while\n“models help in thinking, they also constrain thinking.”\nAs such, various authors have argued that global democracy can more\nusefully be thought of as an on-going process of democratization in\nwhich a set of values are more or less fulfilled. \n\nThe core idea of this approach is that, instead of treating democracy\nas an idealized set of institutions which need to be induced beyond\nthe state, we should think about the fundamental principles that\ndemocracy demands and strive for them under existing conditions. Such\nvalues may include inclusiveness, equality, popular control,\ntransparency, accountability, deliberation, or something else. These\nvalues are supposed to be pursued in different institutional locations\nby various actors in an on-going process. It does not demand any\nspecific ‘end-point’ to work toward. Global politics is\nmore democratic the more these values are fulfilled. This approach has\nseveral key methodological advantages over pursuing models of\ndemocracy. \n\nFirst, democracy is often understood as an essentially contested\nconcept (Gallie 1956). Essential contestation does not just mean that\ndifferent models have different strengths and weaknesses that require\nattention. Rather, it means that contestation over the meaning of\ndemocracy is inherent to the concept itself. Because models provide a\nholistic bundle of normative commitments and institutions, this is\noften thought to undercut the dynamic nature of democracy-building\n(Dryzek 2008). Moreover, because the international system is\npluralistic and complex, absolute agreement on any one model to pursue\nseems unlikely. Focusing on how different democratic values arise in\ndifferent contexts helps to allay this concern. \n\nSecond, engendering models of democracy beyond the state is often\nderided as being infeasible. This argument stands on several\nsub-claims (discussed above), but a general problem is that each model\nof democracy was developed within the national context. As is fairly\nobvious, the global system is not a state. As such, we cannot know in\nadvance which model is best suited to the global system, or how to go\nabout the initial stages of design. Although scholars such as Mathias\nKoenig-Archibugi (2011) have done terrific and laborious work showing\nhow the necessary conditions for national democracy can all be met at\nthe global level, it might still be preferable to open our conception\nof democracy and think about alternate ways, values, and procedures\nthat should be pursued. \n\nFinally, striving for values of democratization helps gain traction on\nthe non-ideal conditions of world politics. Models are, by definition,\nidealizations and thinking about the transformative process toward any\nideal is fraught with difficulties about the nature of the future. In\nthis vein, Amartya Sen (2006) has recently argued that we should not\naim for the full realization of any specified model, but rather we\nshould seek to rank alternative values and arrangements derived from\nthe normative concept in question. Erman (2012) has objected to the\nnotion that democracy can be treated as an aggregate concept composed\nof different democratic values because it fails to recognize that the\ndifferent values are inter-related. While this is true, other scholars\nhave claimed that separating democracy into core values helps to\n“identify more clearly how different democratic values relate to\neach other, to what extent they are in conflict and how such conflicts\nshould be resolved in particular circumstances” (Dingwerth\n2014, 18). \n\nThere are many ways to think about pursuing values of democratization\nin world politics. One prominent example comes from recent\ninternational political theory and the work of Adrian Little and Kate\nMacdonald (2013). These authors argue that the notion of\n‘democratic practice’ should guide global reform. This\napproach frees itself from ‘institutionally-specific’\ngoals and rather seeks “a progressive process of\ndemocratization” (Little and Macdonald 2013, 749). These authors\nidentify political control and popular equality as requisite values\nthat should be employed to guide social critique and\ntransformation. To the extent that individuals have more equitable\ncontrol over how transnational political power is exercised, global\ndemocratization is enhanced. A similar approach is employed by Terry\nMacdonald and Kate Macdonald (2006) in their work on democratizing\nsupply chain governance. These authors argue that global politics can\nbe democratized through a series of decentralized, non-electoral\nmechanisms that help reassert public control over decision-making. \n\nValues of democratization have also been promoted by international\nlawyers (Cohen and Sabel 2006). Gráinne de Búrca, in a\n2008 article, advocates a ‘democracy striving approach’\nwhich highlights the dynamic and inchoateness of democracy. The basic\nidea is to identify the core principles (or ‘building\nblocks’) of democracy and strive for those values beyond the\nstate. De Búrca (2008, 129–36) identifies political\nequality, participation, and representation as key values. Nico\nKrisch, in a book from 2010, has argued that international law can be\ndemocratized by seeking accountability, deliberation, and contestation\nin different issue spaces. Krisch suggests that the heterarchical and\nuneven terrain of global legal orders actually allow these values to\ncome to the fore, and underscores this argument through case study\nanalysis of the European Human Rights regime, UN Security Council\nrulings on terrorism, and genetically modified food governance. \n\nFinally, several IR scholars have also contended that global affairs\ncan be democratized by pursuing democratic values in different ways.\nKarin Bäckstrand (2006), for instance, suggests that global\nclimate governance could be democratized through a stakeholder model\nwhich blends deliberation, participation, and accountability. Jonathan\nKuyper (2014) argues that different issue areas of world politics can\nlikewise be democratized by pursuing values of equal participation,\naccountability, and revisability. This argument is tested and\ndeveloped in the issue space of intellectual property rights\ngovernance.  Magdalena Bexell and her co-authors (2010) focus on the\nvalues of participation and accountability in global governance and\ndocument how non-state actors help induce (or undercut) these\ndesiderata. \n\nOverall, the notion that world politics can be democratized by myriad\nagents pursuing different democratic values in diverse fora has\nemerged as a nascent way to think about reducing the global democratic\ndeficit. While this approach has clear benefits, it also comes with\ncomplications. First, the lack of an institutional blueprint makes the\ndesign process much more opaque than several of the models offered\npreviously. Second, it is not immediately clear why we should seek\nsome values over others and what we should do when values conflict\nwith one another. Finally, this approach might unnecessarily reify the\nstatus quo. Without systematic and comparative analysis, proponents\nrisk ‘cherry picking’ good examples that highlight how\ndemocratic values can be attained while failing to elaborate how\nreally difficult situations can be transformed. This all indicates\nthat this turn in the literature requires much further research. \n\nAlthough democracy is widely regarded as an ideal worth attaining,\ncritics of global democracy have been numerous and persistent (Miller\n1995; Dahl 1999; Moravcsik 2004). A variety of strong objections have\nbeen raised to the fundamental project of global democracy, as well as\nspecific criticisms about institutional proposals and methodology. It\nis not possible to undertake a survey of all criticisms in the\nliterature (and several core issues have already been discussed in the\nprevious sections). The final section, however, will outline two core\nissues that global democrats need to grapple with in current and\nfuture research. Both subsections relate to the issue of power. \n\nScholarship on global democracy is often charged with failing to deal\nwith issues of power. This is particularly problematic because IR\ntheorists have, for many years, highlighted the anarchical and\npower-laden nature of international politics (Morgenthau 1954). This\nview is especially prominent among realists and neo-realists who claim\nthat states are the fundamental units of world politics, and that\npower—understood as material capabilities—is the main\ncurrency of transnational interaction. Drawing parallels with\nHobbes’s state of nature, realists argue that anarchy forces\nstates into a situation of self-help which, in turn, creates security\ndilemmas as states seek to defend their sovereign borders.\nInternational institutions, when they do exist, reflect the prevailing\ndistribution of power and the interests of dominant states. Although\nneo-liberal theorists (such as Robert Keohane) and constructivists\n(such as Alexander Wendt) have argued that cooperation between states\ncan be attained under anarchy, these camps still agree that power\npolitics dominates transnational affairs. \n\nGlobal democracy, as should be clear, requires the equal inclusion\nof individuals in transnational decision-making processes. For most IR\ntheorists, this is simply impossible. States are the key players in\nworld politics, and individuals have standing only through their\nnational political system. Although Pareto optimal (i.e.\nmutually-beneficial) forms of international cooperation can occur in\nworld politics, states will always strive for more power and exploit\nrelative differentials in material capabilities to fulfill national\npreferences. The drive and desire of each national government to\nmaximize their absolute and relative power vis-à-vis other\nstates directly undercuts the cosmopolitan ideal upon which global\ndemocracy is (typically) predicated. \n\nAlthough realist theories have much explanatory power, neo-liberal and\nconstructivist scholars increasingly point to the constraining nature\nof law and ideas in world politics. Constructivists, in particular,\nhave forcefully noted that ‘anarchy is what states make of\nit’ (Wendt 2003, 491). In other words, the realist\ninterpretation of world politics is precisely that:\na cultural and historical interpretation. The\nfundamental nature of international society can and does change over\ntime, and therefore new forms of social and political interactions are\nalways possible. This suggests that power politics is not some\nimmutable condition of international affairs, but rather a situation\nthat can be overcome through new forms of cognition, cooperation, and\ncontestation. As such, cosmopolitan notions of global democracy are\ncertainly conceivable. As Linklater (1998) argues, emerging dialogical\ncommunities of affected peoples are creating transnational social\nrelations that are more universalistic, less unequal, and have greater\nsensitivity to cultural differences. \n\nIn sum, global democrats would do well to tackle more directly issues\nof power politics and engage with core debates in IR. This may allow\nfor insights to be shed on both topics. IR schools—such as\nrealism, neo-realism, neo-liberalism, constructivism, and\ncommunicative action—have traditionally been concerned with\nsocial-scientific, historical, and explanatory analysis. These camps\nhave been less willing or able to question their own normative\nunderpinnings or offer critical prescriptions for future design.\nInversely, global democrats have had a predominantly normative\norientation, but neglected to engage rigorously with social-scientific\nmethodology or make full use of the empirical analysis offered by IR\nscholars. As such, fruitful cross-fertilization may be possible as we\nseek to understand how normative values can be pursued under existing\nconditions of material differentials where the threat of international\nand civil war, climate change disaster, financial crises, and many\nother issues still loom large. \n\nIt is not just IR scholars who have accused global democrats of\nfailing to deal adequately with issues of power. Increasingly within\nthe broader field of normative international political theory, there is\nrecognition that questions of power and conflict have been relegated in\nfavor of global justice (Beitz 1979). Of course, global democrats\nare fundamentally interested in how transnational decision-making is\nexercised and who has a democratic say in the formulation of rules and\nnorms. But these issues are often eclipsed by issues of poverty,\nresource distribution, and inequality (Pogge 1992). \n\nWhen global democrats tackle the notion of power, they do so through a\nspecific lens: they are interested, predominantly, in how ‘the\npeople’ can collectively rule themselves and potentially check\nthe exercise of arbitrary power (Bohman 2007).  Recently, several\nscholars have complained that this focus is too narrow to take proper\nconsideration of how power can be legitimated within the global\nsystem. Macdonald and Ronzoni (2012), following in the footsteps of\nBernard Williams, suggest that legitimacy may be a value separable\nfrom—and not reducible to—democracy or justice. As such,\nwe need to think about different ways of legitimating global power\nthat take seriously the unique context of world politics.  This might\nentail looking at values such as stability, sociological acceptance,\njuridification, or arbitration. Analyzing how these standards foster\nlegitimacy in transnational institutions may actually help shed light\non the fundamental constitutive features of the global political order\n(Macdonald and Ronzoni 2012, 525) and the limits of global\ndemocratization. \n\nAt any rate, much work remains to think about how justice, democracy,\nand legitimacy intersect and diverge in both theoretical and empirical\nterms (Dingwerth 2014). This will entail looking at whether the\ncurrent arrangements of international institutions are sufficiently\nstrong to trigger demands of justice, democracy, or both (Nagel 2005;\nSangiovanni 2007). It will also require analysis of legitimacy as a\nseparable virtue of global political institutions with its own\ncharacter and composition that may only tangentially relate to\ndemocracy. Finally, questions remain over whether a demos—a\ngroup of individuals due democratic standing in the exercise of\npolitical power—can emerge across national borders in coherent\nand stable ways. These future directions for research—as well as\nmany of the other issues addressed in this review—should ensure\nthat global democracy remains an active, vibrant, and important field\nof practice and study in years to come.","contact.mail":"jonathan.kuyper1@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
