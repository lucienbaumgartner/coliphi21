Lawmakers characteristically use language to make\nlaw, and law must provide for the authoritative resolution of disputes\nover the effects of that use of language. Political philosophers are\nnot generally preoccupied with questions in the philosophy of\nlanguage. But legal philosophers are political philosophers with a\nspecialization that gives language (and philosophy of language) a\nspecial\n importance.[1]\n \n\nPhilosophy of law can gain from a good philosophical account of the\nmeaning and use of language, and from a good philosophical account of\nthe institutionalized resolution of disputes over language. Philosophy\nof language can gain from studying the stress-testing of language in\nlegal regulation and dispute resolution. And philosophers of language\ncan gain from the reminder that their task is not only to account for\nwhat people share in virtue of the mastery of a language; they also\nneed to account for the possibility of disagreements over the meaning\nand use of language, and for the possibility that there might be good\nreason for resolving those disagreements in one way rather than\nanother.\n\n\nIn addition to their interest in the use of language in law,\nphilosophers of law have developed a second, interrelated interest in\nusing insights from the philosophy of language to address problems of\nthe nature of law. This article outlines some problems in each of\nthese two areas, after a brief historical note on the linguistic\npreoccupations of legal philosophers.\n\nSystematic efforts to use philosophical insights about language to\nsolve problems in philosophy of law are relatively recent. Jeremy\nBentham was perhaps the first to make a deliberate attempt at it. He\ndeveloped a radically empiricist theory of the meaning of words, which\nsupported his utilitarianism and his legal theory. \nBentham wanted to abandon what he considered to be a nonsensical\nmythology of natural rights and duties—that is, moral rights\nand duties that people have regardless of whether anyone is prepared\nto enforce them. He looked for ‘sensible’ phenomena by\nwhich to explain the nature of law. Linguistic acts struck him as\nrespectably empirical phenomena, and he made them an essential element\nof his theory of law. He based his\n ‘legal positivism’\n on his claims about the meaning and use of words.  \nLanguage had not been especially important to the\n natural law\n theorists whose views Bentham despised. They accounted for a law as a\ncertain sort of reason. From that perspective, philosophy of language\nhas no special role in explaining the nature of law. Philosophy of\nlanguage cannot explain the nature of reasons; it has the ancillary\nrole of explaining the possibility of communicating reasons and the\npossibility of creating reasons by the use of language (so that\nnatural law theorists have the same reason as others to seek a good\naccount of the legal effects of the use of language, and of the role\nof courts in resolving disputes over it). Bentham, by contrast, tried\nto use the ‘sensible’ phenomenon of a perceptible,\nintelligible linguistic act for his purpose of expounding the nature\nof law by reference to empirical phenomena. \nBentham seems to have thought of the meaning of a word in causal\nterms, as its capacity to act on a subject by raising an image of\nperceptible substances or emotions for which, he said, the word was a\nname. ‘By these general terms or names, things and persons,\nacts, and so forth are brought to view…’ (Bentham 1782,\n82; see also Bentham 1776, 28, 108n). Words that do not bring to view\nsuch perceptible things have no meaning, on his theory, except insofar\nas they can be expounded by ‘paraphrasis’—Bentham’s \nmethod of translating whole sentences in which those words\nare used into sentences that do raise images of perceptible\nthings. \nTo many legal theorists that approach appeared, as H.L.A. Hart put it,\n‘as a revelation, bringing down to earth an elusive notion and\nrestating it in the same clear, hard, empirical terms as are used in\nscience’ (Hart 2012, 84). The theory supported not only\nBentham’s empiricism, but also his utilitarianism, because it\nprivileged what he viewed as the ultimate sensible (and therefore\nintelligible) ‘affections’: the pain and pleasure that\nutilitarianism treats as the basis for a theory of value and of\nmorality. \nIn his legal theory, this view of language became the basis of an\ninnovative account of law as the expression of the will of a sovereign\nin a political community. Bentham stated it as follows: \nHe went on to explain that the signification of volition by such an\nassemblage of signs must be backed by ‘motives’ of pain or\npleasure offered by the sovereign. \nTwo features of this theory tie the philosophy of law to the\nphilosophy of language. One feature is methodological, and the other\nis substantive. First, Bentham proposes his theory as a definition of\nthe term a law (see section 3.1 below, on ‘Definition as\na methodology in philosophy of law’). Secondly, he defines a law\nas a particular kind of assemblage of signs (see section 2.1 below, on\n‘Law and Signs’). In Bentham’s view, a law is an\nassemblage of signs, and legal philosophy is a form of philosophy of\nlanguage. The legal theorist has a linguistic task of defining the\nterms (especially law, but others as well) of legal\ndiscourse. \nThat, in brief, is the apogee of the use of philosophy of language in\nphilosophy of law. Bentham was ahead of his time. His theory of the\nmeaning and use of words anticipated various trends in\ntwentieth-century philosophy of language (including Frege’s and\nWittgenstein’s ‘context principle’, some views of logical\npositivists, and the development of speech act theory). It was\nH.L.A.Hart who, in the 1950s and 1960s, made a concerted effort to use\ntwentieth-century developments in philosophy of language to\n‘elucidate’ the nature of law. He did so with an\nenthusiasm for the work of Wittgenstein, and also of the Oxford\nphilosophers J.L.Austin and Paul Grice. So Hart had some advantages\nover Bentham. Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations had\nbeen directed against the view that a word’s meaning is the thing for\nwhich it stands as a name. That was one of the misconceptions that\ndistorted Bentham’s theory of the meaning of words: he thought that a\nword like ‘right’ had to be a name for an entity, and that\nsince no such entity could be sensed, the word was a name for a\n‘fictitious entity’—(Bentham 1782, 251). And\nJ.L.Austin took an attitude to ordinary discourse that was quite\nopposed to that of Bentham, who thought that philosophy must tear away\nthe ‘veil of mystery’ that ordinary language throws over\nevery object of study (Bentham 1782, 251). Wittgenstein’s attitude was\nmore complex: he thought both that philosophers create philosophical\nproblems by bewitching themselves with language, and also that a clear\nunderstanding of the use of language could provide healthy therapy for\npeople suffering from philosophical problems. Taking advantage of the\ninsights of Wittgenstein and J.L.Austin, Hart aimed to put philosophy\nof language to work in addressing problems of legal philosophy,\nwithout making what he regarded as Bentham’s extravagant mistakes. \nIn 1961, Hart’s book The Concept of Law raised issues that\nhave occupied legal philosophers ever since. He borrowed J.L. Austin’s\nmethod of ‘using a sharpened awareness of words to sharpen our\nperception of the phenomena’ (Hart 2012, v, 14). Hart’s\nobservations about the use of language in law were elements in an\ninnovative approach to explaining the normativity of law—that\nis, the fact that law presents itself as conferring rights and powers\nand as imposing obligations and liabilities. Hart argued that we can\nunderstand that feature of law more clearly, if we understand where\nBentham and his nineteenth-century disciple\n John Austin\n (not to be confused with J.L.Austin) went wrong in explaining the\nmeaning and use of normative language. Hart’s new approach to the\nissue has been a starting point for discussions of the normativity of\nlaw since the 1960s [see section 3.2 below]. \nRonald Dworkin argued that Hart’s focus on language had a toxic effect\non his whole approach to legal philosophy. He wrote that Hart suffered\nfrom a ‘semantic sting’, because he wrongly thought\n‘that lawyers all follow certain linguistic criteria for judging\npropositions of law’ (Dworkin 1986, 45; see section 2.4 below).\nThat argument in the philosophy of language has set an agenda for much\ndebate in philosophy of law (see, for example, the essays in Coleman,\n2001). \nBecause of the allure of philosophy of language, and partly as a\nresult of the influence of Hart, the use of philosophy of language in\nphilosophy of law became the focus of much jurisprudential thought and\ndebate in the 20th century. One notable example is the work of Jerzy\nWróblewski, a Polish legal theorist who developed a\n‘semantic conception of a legal norm’ (Wróblewski\n1983), and offered a theory of legal language as a sub-type of natural\nlanguage with multiple ‘fuzzy’ characteristics\n(Wróblewski 1985). In Italian analytical legal philosophy, the\ninfluential theorist Norberto Bobbio began in the 1950s ‘to\nconsider law as a language and legal science as a meta-language’\n(Pintore and Jori 1997, 3), in service of a theory of law based on a\nnon-cognitivist moral theory. Two succeeding generations of Italian\nlegal theorists have engaged in ‘dispute on semiotic ground,\nrather than directly by arguments of general legal philosophical\npositions’ (Pintore and Jori, 17). \nThat development was one instance of the widespread use of views about\nlanguage in debunking conventional views about law in the 20th\ncentury. Perhaps this development resulted not so much from the\ninfluence of Bentham’s own writings, as from pursuit of the same\nsearch that he undertook, for ways of identifying the elements of law\nthat suit empiricist philosophical sensibilities. The energetic\n20th-century school of ‘Scandinavian legal realism’ viewed\nlegal terms like ‘right’ as ‘lacking semantic\nreference’ and ‘denoting nothing’. So they\nconsidered statements asserting the existence of rights, duties, and\nother legal relations to be incapable of being true or false\n(Olivecrona 1971, 246, 255, 261). They variously explained the use of\nsuch statements as attempts to perform magical incantations, or as\ntools for taking advantage of the psychological conditioning that\nleads officials and citizens to act in one way or another when they\nhear such statements (see the outline of Scandinavian realism in\nOlivecrona 1971, 174–182, and see Ross 1956; see also section 5\nof the entry on\n Naturalism in Legal Philosophy). \nSimilarly, various strands in the influential American legal academic\nenterprise of ‘economic analysis of law’ share Bentham’s\ndebunking attitude toward central legal terms such as\n‘right’ and ‘obligation’. Like Bentham, some\neconomic analysts oscillate (or equivocate) between (1) a moral theory\nthat reduces those normative terms to terms describing maximization of\nhuman satisfactions, and (2) a theory that does not engage in moral\nargument, but only claims to describe human motivation, accounting for\nterms such as ‘right’ and ‘obligation’ as\nrhetorical epithets that agents use to pursue what they will [see the\nentry on\n The Economic Analysis of Law,\n section 2.2]. \nNot all legal sceptics have been driven by the empiricism of Bentham\nand the Scandinavians. Many other forms of scepticism about law have\nalso sought support in scepticism about the meaning of language.\nAttacks on the coherence of the idea of the rule of law, and on the\nmeaningfulness of legal discourse, have used ideas in the philosophy\nof language as diverse as Saul Kripke’s interpretation of\nWittgenstein’s remarks on rule following (see entry on\n Interpretation and Coherence in Legal Reasoning),\n and deconstruction (see Endicott 2000, chapter 1). \nThere are insurmountable objections to Bentham’s idea that a law is an\nassemblage of signs. Law (in the sense that is relevant here) is the\nsystematic regulation of the life of a community by standards treated\nas binding the members of the community and its institutions. A law is\na standard that is part of such a systematic form of regulation. Many\nsuch standards have no canonical linguistic formulation (that is, no\nform of words which, according to law, determines the content of the\nstandard). Lawyers in common law systems are familiar with such norms:\nmurder may be a criminal offence (or slander may be a tort, or certain\nagreements may be enforceable as contracts…), not because of\nthe expression by any person or institution of a rule that it should\nbe so, but because the institutions of the legal system customarily\ntreat murder as an offence (or slander as a tort...). Moreover, common\nlaw systems cannot be distinguished from legal systems consisting only\nof linguistic acts, because no legal system consists only of\nlinguistic acts. A civil law system with a civil code and a criminal\ncode may make murder an offence (and slander a tort…) by a\nwritten act, and it may be a written constitution that gives legal\nforce to the civil code and to the criminal code. But the validity of\nthe written constitution will depend on a norm which is not created by\nthe use of signs: the rule that that text is to be treated as\nsetting out the\n constitution.[2] \nBentham and John Austin knew that there are rules of law that were not\nlaid down in language. Preserving their view of law as signification\nof volition, they accounted for such laws as tacit commands\nof the sovereign. That convoluted device cannot provide the resources\nneeded to explain the existence of a norm. In the right circumstances,\nit is certainly possible to communicate without using signs (and in\nparticular, it is possible to convey a volition, backed by a threat of\nforce, just by saying or writing nothing). But silence can only be a\nmeans of communication when the circumstances give it a meaning. We\ncan say that a tacit command has been issued only if it is possible to\nidentify features of the situation that distinguish the tacit\ncommunication from mere inaction communicating nothing [see Hart 2012,\n45–48]. Those features do not generally accompany customary\nrules (in fact, they generally do not accompany customary rules).  \nThere is another conclusive objection to the idea that a law is an\nassemblage of signs. When a lawmaking authority does use language to\nmake a law (as when a legislature uses a lawful process to pass an\nenactment that is within its powers), the resulting law is not an\nassemblage of signs. When I write you an email message to make a\nrequest, the message is an assemblage of signs, but the request is not\nan assemblage of signs; it is something I use the assemblage of signs\nto make. The law that results from the use of language in an enactment\nis a standard (or standards) whose existence and content are\ndetermined by the legal effect that the law ascribes to that use of an\nassemblage of signs. \nA law, therefore, is not an assemblage of signs, and law is not\nnecessarily made by the use of language, and every legal system has\nnorms that were not made by the use of language. Laws are not\nlinguistic acts. Laws, you may say, are standards of behaviour that\ncan be communicated (and some of which are made) by using language.\nBut even this is controversial among writers on legal\ninterpretation. \nWhat is the relationship between the language that is used to make\nlegal standards, and the law itself? If the law provides that a form\nof words determines the content of a standard (such as a term of a\ncontract, or a criminal offence, or a duty of the executor of a will),\nwhat is the effect of the use of the words? The question seems to\ndemand general theories of the meaning of language and of the\ninterpretation of communicative acts. If there are no general theories\nto be had, then there is no general answer to the question. A theory\nof meaning and interpretation of legal language would not be very much\nless general than a theory of meaning and interpretation of\nlanguage. \nLegal theorists have tried to construct theories of the meaning of\nlegal language, and theories of legal interpretation, based on\nspecific features of law, of legal systems, and of the use of language\nin making law. The entries on\n Interpretation and Coherence in Legal Reasoning,\n Constitutionalism [see section 7, ‘Constitutional Interpretation’],\n The Nature of Law,\n and\n Naturalism in Legal Philosophy\n address theories of legal interpretation. Here I will address\nfeatures of language that raise challenges for philosophy of law and\nfor philosophy of language. Any good account of the meaning and\ninterpretation of the language used in making law needs to deal with\nways in which its legal effect depends on the context of its use\n(addressed in this section). ‘Pragmatic’ effects of language\nuse, such as context-dependence, have long been the matter of\njurisprudential debate, and recently the use of Gricean and\npost-Gricean\n pragmatics\n has become a major field of debate among philosophers of language and\nphilosophers of law (section 2.3). These pragmatic features of\ncommunication raise insuperable difficulties for any attempt to give a\ntrue account of legal interpretation that is well enough organised to\ndeserve to be called a ‘theory’. Debates over the\npragmatics of legal language are often premised on the view that the\neffect of a lawmaking use of language is that the content of the\nlinguistic communication in question determines the content of the\nlaw. But even this premise is controversial, and has been denied by\ntheorists who account for the law as being determined by moral reasons\nfor conclusions as to what rights, duties, powers, and liabilities\npeople have, given the facts of legal practice and history (section\n2.4).  \nAs an instance of controversy over the effect of the use of language\nin law, consider the case of Garner v Burr [1951] 1 KB 31.\nThe legislature had made it an offence to use a ‘vehicle’\non a road without pneumatic tires. Lawrence Burr fitted iron wheels to\nhis chicken coop, and pulled it down the road behind his tractor. Burr\nwas prosecuted under the statute. The magistrates acquitted him,\napparently on the ground that a chicken coop is not a\n‘vehicle’. The appeal court reversed that decision. The\nLord Chief Justice wrote, \nThe magistrates and the appeal court seem to have disagreed over the\neffect of two principles: a principle that statutes should only be\nread as imposing criminal liability if they do so unequivocally, and a\nprinciple that the purposes for which Parliament passed the statute\nshould be pursued. Assume that those principles are legal\nprinciples, in the sense that a decision in accordance with the law\nmust respect them. The apparent tension between the principles might\nbe resolved in one of the following two ways. We do not have the\nmagistrates’ reasons, but let’s presume that they resolved the tension\nin the first way; the appeal court resolved it in the second way: \n2. by concluding that Parliament’s purpose is sufficiently clear that\nit can be pursued by convicting Mr.Burr, without jeopardising the\nprinciple that criminal liabilities ought to be clearly spelled out,\neven if someone might reasonably claim that a chicken coop on wheels\nis not a ‘vehicle’. \nIt may seem that this common sort of disagreement tells us nothing\nabout language, except perhaps that language is of no particular\nimportance in law. It may seem that the two courts did not disagree\nover any question of language (after all, everyone involved was\ncompetent in English), but only over whether they ought to give effect\nto Parliament’s evident purpose of protecting roads by convicting\nMr.Burr, or whether that would be unfair to him. \nOne explanation of the decision would be that the appeal court ignored\nthe word ‘vehicle’, and treated the pneumatic tires rule\nas if it applied to anything that moves on wheels (instead of applying\nto vehicles, which is what the legislation said). But the Lord Chief\nJustice did not explain his decision that way. He did not hold that,\nbecause Parliament aimed to protect roads from iron wheels, Burr\nshould be convicted regardless of the meaning of the word\n‘vehicle’. He held that the magistrates ought to have\nfound that the chicken coop was a vehicle, ‘for the\npurposes’ of the Road Traffic Act. Presumably the magistrates,\ntoo, considered themselves to be giving effect to the language of the\nAct, rather than ignoring (in the interests of fairness) what\nParliament had enacted. \nNo doubt, legal decisionmakers sometimes depart from the language of\nvalid enactments (or wills, or contracts...). They may do so\ncorruptly, or in the exercise of an equitable jurisdiction to depart\nfrom the law, or because they consider that justice demands it even if\nthe law accords them no power to depart from the language. But the\nmagistrates and the appeal judges evidently saw themselves as giving\neffect to the language of the Road Traffic Act in Garner v\nBurr. And the sort of disagreement that arose in that case\n(disagreement over the legal effect of the use of a word) is so common\nthat we seem to find a paradox: competent speakers of the English\nlanguage share a knowledge of the meaning of the word\n‘vehicle’, yet they disagree—apparently \nsincerely—over the effect of legislation using the word. \nTo resolve the apparent paradox, we can say that what speakers of the\nEnglish language share, in virtue of their grasp of the meaning of a\nword like ‘vehicle’, is an ability to use the word in a\nway that depends on the context. The question of whether a chicken\ncoop on wheels counts as a ‘vehicle’ would be a different\nquestion (and might have a different answer), if another statute or\nregulation imposed a tax on ‘vehicles’. The relevant\nconsiderations might be different again if a statute or regulation\nrequired ‘vehicles’ to keep to the left-hand side of the\nroad. The Lord Chief Justice was right that a dictionary definition of\n‘vehicle’ could not conclude the question of whether the\nchicken coop was a vehicle in Garner v Burr, because the\npurpose of a dictionary definition is to point the reader to features\nof the use of the word that can be more-or-less important in a variety\nof more-or-less analogical ways in various contexts. A definition of\n‘vehicle’ as a mode of conveyance offers the reader one\ncentral strand in the use of that word, but does not tell the reader\nwhether a more-or-less analogical extension of the word to a chicken\ncoop on wheels is warranted or unwarranted by the meaning of the word.\nAnother way of stating this resolution of the apparent paradox is by\ndistinguishing between the meaning of a word (which the magistrates\nand the appeal judges all knew) and the way in which a communicative\nact using the word ought to be understood (over which they disagreed).\nWhat the judges and magistrates in Garner v Burr shared was a\nknowledge of the meaning of the word ‘vehicle’, and what\nthey disagreed over was the effect of the legislature’s use of the\nword. \nThe dependence of the effect of legal language on context is an\ninstance of a general feature of communication, which some\nphilosophers of language have approached by distinguishing semantics\nfrom pragmatics. The distinction is, roughly, between the meaning of a\nword or phrase or other linguistic expression, and the effect that is\nto be ascribed to the use of the expression in a particular way, by a\nparticular user of the language, in a particular context. The\npragmatics of legal language is a vast field, because the term\n‘pragmatics’ could be used as a heading for much of what\nmodern legal scholars and theorists have described as grounds for\ninterpretation (and also as a heading for much that they have\ndescribed as the theory of interpretation -since\n‘pragmatics’ is a term not only for effects of\ncommunication, but also for the study of those effects). For example,\nthe work of the judges in Garner v Burr can be described as\nan exercise in pragmatic inference. The technical sound of the word\n‘pragmatics’ may suggest that it is a term for the\ntheoretical study of its object; in fact, the field of study is what\nmight be inferred from the fact that someone said what they said in\nthe context in which they said it. No object of study is less apt for\ntheorising.  \nThis vast field has been much studied over millennia by lawyers and\nphilosophers, but only recently through the use of resources that may\nbe borrowed from the 20th-century development of\n‘pragmatics’ as a discipline in linguistics and the\nphilosophy of language. Much recent work in the pragmatics of legal\nlanguage has focused on Gricean and post-Gricean pragmatics, as a\nsource of insights into the theory of legal interpretation (see e.g.\nMarmor 2008, 2014, Soames 2008, Ekins 2012 (see pp 205-211), Carston\n2013, Solum 2013; on Gricean and post-Gricean pragmatics, see\n Pragmatics). \nIt is controversial whether legal pragmatics is simply a part of the\npragmatics of language use in general (see Dascal and Wróblewski\n1988). It stands to reason that if the pragmatics of language use\ndepends on the context of an utterance, the legal context of a\nlawmaking use of language will have implications for the meaning\nconveyed and, therefore, for the law that is made. Scott Soames has\nargued that the question of the relation between the content of the\nlaw, and authoritative sources such as statutes, is ‘an instance\nof the more general question of what determines the contents of\nordinary linguistic texts’ (Soames 2008). It is a popular idea\nthat when a legislature enacts a statute, ‘The content of the\nstatute is what the lawmakers asserted and committed themselves to, in\nadopting the statutory language’ (Soames 2008). Speakers can\ncommit themselves to something that they have not asserted, and can\nmake assertions in contexts that make it clear that they are not\ncommitted to what they have asserted. \nBut Andrei Marmor has argued that the pragmatics of legal language is\nunique in crucial respects (Marmor 2008), with pragmatic\nconsiderations playing some very significantly lesser role in law,\nthan in other contexts: ‘In ordinary conversations, pragmatic\nenrichment is the norm, not the exception; in statutory law, it is the\nexception’ (Marmor 2014, 34). In his view, the Gricean maxims of\nconversation, derived from a general principle of cooperation, do not\nstraightforwardly apply in legislative communication, because\nlegislative communication is ‘strategic’ rather than\ncooperative (Marmor 2014, 45-57). Likewise, Francesca Poggi has argued\nthat Grice’s theory does not apply to legislation, because of\nthe ‘conflictual behaviour’ of those addressed by\nlegislation (Poggi 2011, 35). As Marmor points out, speakers and\nlisteners in strategic communication take advantage of uncertainties\nin the\n implicatures\n to be derived from pragmatic norms of communication. For present\npurposes, we can think of an implicature as a proposition that a\nperson is to be understood to have conveyed by using language in a\nparticular way, although it is not expressed by what the person said\n(see Grice 1975, 43-4). Speakers may exploit implicatures in order to\navoid asserting what they prefer to implicate, and listeners may\nexploit uncertainties concerning implicatures in order to bend the\neffect of a communication to their liking. Yet these aspects of\ncommunication are not distinctive to law making. And they depend on\ncooperation among participants in the ‘conversation’ in\nquestion: some degree of cooperation is necessary in order for it to\nmake any sense for a speaker to take advantage of an implicature, or\nfor a listener to treat an uncertain implicature as a genuine\nimplicature. \nWhat has been called ‘near-side’ pragmatics is a matter of\ndetermining what is said by an utterance; in informal conversation it\ninvolves the use of indexicals and pronominal figures that are avoided\nin legislation, and involves the implications of context for an\nunderstanding of the uses of terms. And ‘far-side’\npragmatics (determining what is implicated rather than said, and\ndetermining what speech acts are carried out by means of an utterance)\ncan involve figurative uses of language, sarcasm, innuendos, and other\ntechniques that lawmakers avoid (for Korta and Perry’s\ndistinction between ‘near-side’ and ‘far-side’\npragmatics, see\n Pragmatics).\n There is some force in Marmor’s claim that pragmatics is different in\nlaw. Legislation systematically avoids many communicative devices that\ncan be very useful in other contexts of communication. But those\ndevices are also avoided in a very wide range of other formalized and\ntechnical uses of language—for example, in most wedding\ninvitations, in Wikipedia, and in well-written instruction guides for\napplying for bank account or a university programme or for operating a\nrice cooker. \nYet the pragmatic effects of communication are essential in all those\ncontexts of language use, and are essential to the legislative use of\nlanguage. This is true both of ‘near-side’ and\n‘far-side’ pragmatics. The discussion of the decision in\nGarner v Burr, above, provides an illustration of the ways in\nwhich the context of a legislative enactment can determine the\nreference of terms such as ‘vehicle’, and this\ndetermination of meaning is an aspect of near-side pragmatics. The\ndispute over the requirement of pneumatic tires on\n‘vehicles’ in Garner v Burr can be understood as\na dispute over the effect of the context on the content of the\nregulatory provision; another way of making the same point is to\ndescribe it as a dispute over the implicatures to be drawn from the\nfact of the enactment of that provision. This aspect of the pragmatics\nof legal language is simply an instance of the pragmatics of the use\nof language in general (it would be very easy to formulate a version\nof the apparent paradox from Garner v Burr, discussed in\nsection 2.2 above, in a non-legal context). \nThe role of far-side pragmatics is illustrated by the master\nimplicature of every legislative act: it is never said in legislation,\nbut there is always an implicature, that the rights and duties and\npowers established by the legislation are to be legal rights\nand duties and powers, under the law of the jurisdiction for which the\nenactment is made (see Endicott 2014, 55). Very many other more\nparticular lawyers’ presumptions serve as maxims of the pragmatics of\nlawmaking (such as the presumption that a new enactment overrides a\ncontrary previous enactment). \nIt is worth noting, as well, that the diversity of contexts of\ncommunication (even the diversity of conversations that the same two\npeople may have, let alone all the diversity of exchanges that might\nbe called ‘conversations’ by more or less remote analogy)\nis so great, that the variations among pragmatic aspects of ordinary\nconversations are much wider and deeper, than any general distinction\nthat can be drawn between legislative communication as a class, and\nordinary conversations as a class. The use of language in making law\nis so closely interwoven with the use of language to exercise\nauthority in other contexts, and with the use of language in games, in\ntalk of what is right and wrong, and generally in communication in\nfamilies and in organisations of every kind, that the pragmatics of\nlegal language is best seen as a deeply integral part of the\npragmatics of the use of language in general. \nIt may seem otherwise, because the persons to whom laws are addressed\ncan be extraordinarily creative in finding ways in which they can fit\nthe laws to their own interests, and persons in a dispute over the law\ntend to disagree deeply over the effect of the language that has been\nused to make law (so that it is not at all unusual for each side to\nend up with a deeply-felt conviction that the law is so clearly on his\nor her own side, that no reasonable person could think otherwise). So\nit seems, as Marmor argues, that the use of language to make law is\nnot part of a cooperative exchange between lawmakers and the persons\nto whom their communications are addressed. For this very reason, of\ncourse, every legal system has tribunals for the resolution of\ndisputes; they are always an integral part of the system of governance\nin a state that is ruled by law, although they very often have various\nforms of independence from other institutions of the system. The\ntribunals or courts typically have authority to interpret the language\nof the law, and to determine its effect in particular cases. Unlike\nthe parties to a dispute, courts are characteristically involved with\nthe lawmakers in the enterprise of governance (even where the courts\nare independent), and often have their own lawmaking capacities. Their\nrole in the system is the substratum for a cooperative principle that\nhas even deeper significance (and somewhat simpler implications) in\nthe operation of a legal system, than Grice’s cooperative principle\nhas in ordinary conversation. And, of course, that cooperative role of\na court in the legal system constrains the arguments of parties to a\ndispute: however strongly they are inclined to twist the language of\nthe law (and however strongly they may feel that the other side is\ntwisting the language of the law), they need an argument that will\npersuade an institution that is committed, at least in principle, to\ncooperative interpretation of lawmaking acts. \nThe problem faced in cases like Garner v Burr is an\nespecially vivid reminder of a problem that philosophers of language\nhave long been more or less aware of (see Aristotle’s discussion of\nthe notion of ‘friendship’ in Eudemian Ethics VII, 2,\n1236a 33). The context-dependence of the meaning of utterances\nrequires an account of linguistic competence that relates it to other\nhuman capacities—capacities to judge the importance of context\nand to draw analogies. It would be a mistake in the philosophy of\nlanguage to account for language in a way that divorces its mastery\nfrom other aspects of reason. That connection between the use of\nlanguage and reason is also illustrated by the contentious nature of\nthe use of language in law. Much work on pragmatics by philosophers of\nlanguage has concerned the conditions for understanding an utterance;\njudicial disputes over language are a reminder that those \nconditions—even though they are conditions of intelligibility of\ncommunication—lend themselves to disagreement and to reasoned\ndispute over how an utterance is to be understood (see Carston 2013,\nfor discussion of controversies over the applications of\nconversational maxims). The special feature that distinguishes the\nlegal use of language from ordinary conversation is not that\nparticipants in a legal system act strategically while participants in\nan ordinary conversation act cooperatively; the special feature is\nthat legal systems need institutions and processes for resolution of\nthe disputes about the application of language that arise as a result\nof its context-dependence, and as a result of other pragmatic aspects\nof communication. \nDiscussions of the pragmatics of legal language are expressly or\nimplicitly premised on a view of the relation between a law-making use\nof language, and the law that is made. It is the view that if a body\nor person is authorised to make law, it makes the law that it\ncommunicates by its use of\n language.[3]\n I will call that ‘the communication model’. It must be\nqualified in at least four ways, because the law itself regulates the\nmaking of law: \nEven with those qualifications, some theorists reject the\ncommunication model. They argue that the identification of legal\nrights and duties cannot be based merely on facts, such as the fact\nthat an authority has communicated such-and-such. Mark Greenberg has\nargued against the communication model (Greenberg 2011, 221). In his\nview, \nThe most influential theory to have denied the communication model is\nthat of Ronald Dworkin, as it emerged in his argument against the idea\nthat the law of a country is a system of rules. H.L.A.Hart had tried\nto explain the nature of a legal system on the basis of social rules\nfor identifying the law of a community (‘rules of recognition’), \nwhich provide shared tests of validity for rules of the system. Hart treated\nit as obvious that such rules of recognition commonly identify the\nacts of law-making authorities as sources of law, conferring power on\nthose authorities to make law, and that (subject to qualifications on\nthe communication model such as those listed above) the law becomes\nwhat a lawmaker conveys that it is to be, in the communicative act by\nwhich it exercises such a power. \nOn that view, the content of the law of a community depends on a\nconventional way of recognizing legal rules. But if members of the\ncommunity share a way of recognizing their law, how can they engage in\nthe deep disputes about the law that we are all so familiar with?\nDworkin made that question into a focus of jurisprudential debate. And\nhe framed the question as an objection to a misguided view of\nlanguage, and of the relation between law and language. He began his\nbook Law’s Empire (Dworkin 1986b) by contending that legal\ntheorists like Hart cannot explain theoretical disagreement in legal\npractice, because they think that lawyers share uncontroversial tests\n(tests which Dworkin termed ‘criteria’) for the truth of\npropositions of law. The ‘semantic sting’ involves the\nmisconception that the language of the law can be meaningful only if\nlawyers share such criteria. It is fatal to a legal theory, because it\nleads the theorist to think that people cannot have any deep (or\n‘substantive’ or ‘genuine’) disagreement about\nthe law. They can only disagree (1) about empirical questions such as\nwhat words were used in a statute, or (2) about how to resolve\npenumbral cases, or (3) about whether the law should be changed. If\nyou suffer from the semantic sting, you will conclude that disagreeing\nabout the criteria for application of the language of the law would be\nlike using the same words with different meanings. People who disagree\nin that way are only talking past each other. Here is how Dworkin sets\nout the views of theorists who suffer from the semantic sting: \nWe follow shared rules, they say, in using any word: these rules set\nout criteria that supply the word’s meaning. Our rules for using\n‘law’ tie law to plain historical fact. It does not follow\nthat all lawyers are aware of these rules in the sense of being able\nto state them in some crisp and comprehensive form. For we all follow\nrules given by our common language of which we are not fully aware.\n…We all use the same factual criteria in framing, accepting,\nand rejecting statements about what the law is, but we are ignorant of\nwhat these criteria are. Philosophers of law must elucidate them for\nus by a sensitive study of how we speak. They may disagree among\nthemselves, but that alone casts no doubt on their common assumption,\nwhich is that we do share some set of standards about how\n‘law’ is to be used. (Dworkin, 1986b, 31) \nDworkin argued that legal philosophy needs to make a fresh start, in\norder to face the challenge of explaining disagreement about the law.\nAny theory of law, he claimed, needs to be a ‘constructive\ninterpretation’ of legal practice. A constructive interpretation\nis one that simultaneously fits the facts of the object of\ninterpretation (in the case of legal interpretation, the object is not\nsome particular communicative act by a lawmaker, but the entire\npractice of the community) and portrays it as an object that\nachieves its purpose. On this view a theory that does not present law\nas an exercise in constructive interpretation cannot even compete as a\ntheory of law, because it suffers from the semantic sting. And the\ncommunication model is incompatible with the idea that law is an\nexercise in constructive interpretation. \nThe semantic sting really does seem a gruesome fate for a lawyer,\nbecause those who suffer from it would have to say that no one really\ndisagrees with anyone about the law: whenever people think they\ndisagree about how to identify the law on any point, that fact in\nitself would demonstrate that there is nothing to disagree about:\nthere is no law on the point at issue, if the agreed ways of\nidentifying the law do not decide the point. So if you suffer from the\nsemantic sting, you will conclude that sincere, competent lawyers will\nnever disagree with each other. When an apparent disagreement arises,\nthey will throw up their hands and say that there is no law on the\npoint. If you suffer from the semantic sting, you will think that at\nleast one party to any dispute over the content of the law is both\nlegally inept and philosophically misguided, or is just a liar. \nIf you think that law is made by the communicative acts of lawmaking\nauthorities, and if everyone understands the language in question,\nthen it may seem that you are doomed to conclude that competent\nlawyers cannot disagree in good faith as to what law has been made. To\nmeet Dworkin’s challenge, it is necessary to explain how it can be\nreasonable to disagree over the application of rules made by\ncommunicative acts. How can competent and (let’s presume) sincere and\nreasonable adjudicators differ (as the Lord Chief Justice and the\nmagistrates differed in Garner v Burr) on the question of\nwhat the law allows or prohibits? \nThe potential for such a reasonable disagreement (even among people\nwho understand the language of the lawmaker equally well) is very\nreadily to be found in the complex pragmatic considerations discussed\nin section 2.3 above, concerning the effect of a lawmaking\ncommunicative act. If we accept the communication model, we will\nconclude that participants in legal practice typically share an\nunderstanding of the meaning of the language of legislation; yet it is\nstill clear that there are bound to be deep disagreements as to the\nimplications of those law-making acts in some cases. Disagreement\nabout the content of the law will arise if the persons subject to the\nlaw must apply a test that, like the legislation in Garner v\nBurr, can be controversial in its application in some unusual\ncase. Likewise, disagreement will arise if the legislative act\ndelegates authority to a court (as legislatures often do), or if the\nlegislature communicates unclearly. The persons subject to the law\nmust decide (and may dispute) how to interpret the acts of the\nlegislature. And it may also be unclear (and controversial) in some\ncases whether the legislature has the power that it claims to have\nexercised, or whether a court has power to depart (and if so, whether\nit would be right for it to depart) from a decision of the\nlegislature. \nDoes the recent outpouring of work on the pragmatics of legal language\nprovide a successful defence of the communication model against\nDworkin’s semantic sting argument? Dworkin would presumably have\nextended his ‘semantic sting’ argument into an argument that the\ncommunication model suffers from a ‘semantic-and-pragmatic\nsting’—unless, that is, it evolves into a theory of\n‘constructive interpretation’, holding that the\n‘pragmatic’ aspects of the lawmaking use of language require the\ninterpreter to construct the theory of rights and duties that best\nfits and justifies the whole pattern of legal practice. But Dworkin’s\nsemantic sting argument cannot in itself undermine the communication\nmodel, because his argument was based on an impoverished view of the\ncontroversy that can result from communication.  \nThe importance of the context of the word’s use requires anyone\naddressing the problem in Garner v Burr to make evaluative\njudgments, just to apply the putatively descriptive term\n‘vehicle’. The context of use is a criminal prohibition\nimposed for a presumably good public purpose of protecting road\nsurfaces. To determine in that context whether the word\n‘vehicle’ extends to a chicken coop on wheels, you need to\naddress (and to resolve any tension between) the two principles\nmentioned above: that the purposes for which Parliament passed the\nstatute should be pursued, and that criminal liability should not be\nextended to conduct that has not been unequivocally prohibited.\nBecause of that context, the question of the meaning and application\nof the language of the statute cannot be answered without making\njudgments on normative questions of how those principles are to be\nrespected. The role of evaluative considerations in the application of\nordinary descriptive terms like ‘vehicle’ raises a\nchallenge for any thorough-going scepticism about value: the challenge\nis to decide whether to adopt a thorough-going scepticism about the\nmeaning and application of descriptive language, which seems to follow\nfrom general scepticism concerning value.  \nFor philosophy of law, the dependence of descriptive language on\nevaluative considerations raises special problems. If you cannot tell\nwhether to describe an object as a ‘vehicle’ without\nevaluative reasoning, then you cannot tell what law the Road Traffic\nAct makes merely by pointing out physical facts (such as that there\nwere wheels on the chicken coop) and social facts (such as that\nParliament used the word ‘vehicle’ in the Act, or the\ncomplex social fact of the whole pattern of uses that have been made\nof the word ‘vehicle’). You cannot identify the law (that\nis, you cannot tell what legal rights and duties people have) without\nevaluative reasoning. That conclusion, if it is sound, seems to have\nimportant implications for the long-running debates in theory of law\nover the relation between fact and value in law, and over relations\nbetween law and morality. The conclusion seems to contradict one of\nthe most provocative and controversial claims in the theory of \nlaw—the ‘sources thesis’, which Joseph Raz has stated\nas follows:  \nWe can only decide whether the chicken coop was a\n‘vehicle’ for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act by\nunderstanding the Act as pursuing something that the legislature\ndecided was worth pursuing, and by making an evaluative judgment as to\nwhether due respect for the pursuit of that value through the\nenactment, and due respect for the requirement of certainty in\ncriminal liability, support the conclusion that the chicken coop is a\n‘vehicle’ in the relevant sense. So we cannot apply the\nlaw without resort to evaluative reasoning.  \nIt may seem that judges need to make such evaluative judgments only in\nborderline cases for the application of legal language—and\nthat they have discretion in those cases (that is, the judge must make\na decision that is not determined by law). But a clear case of a\nvehicle counts as a ‘vehicle’ for the purpose of the Road\nTraffic Act just because the evaluative considerations that justify\nthe use of the word ‘vehicle’ in that context clearly\nsupport its application. The sources thesis seems to be contradicted\neven in the clearest cases of the application of a law stated in\ndescriptive language, if the content of such laws can only be\nidentified on the basis of an evaluative judgment as to how the\npurposes of the law ought to be conceived. That form of evaluation,\nyou may say, can only be carried out by engaging in the very same form\nof reasoning that, in Raz’s theory, law excludes.  \nIt is true that, in order to decide what the sources have directed\n(and thereby, in Raz’s terms, to identify the existence and content of\na law), you need to understand the sense in which a word like\n‘vehicle’ is used. But the existence and content of the\noffence can still be identified without first judging whether it ought\nto be an offence to do what Mr.Burr did, or whether there ought to be\nany offence at all of driving without pneumatic tires. The sources\nthesis articulates this important insight: in English law, there was\nno offence of driving without pneumatic tires (whether or not it would\nbe a good idea for that to be an offence), until Parliament acted to\ncreate it. And then, it became an offence because Parliament had done\nso (whether or not it was a good idea to do so). Moreover, if the\ninstitutions of the law had not been prepared to treat the chicken\ncoop as a vehicle, then because of that social fact, it would have\nbeen false (after a decision with precedential effect) to say that it\nwas an offence to pull a chicken coop on iron wheels on the road.\nBecause law is systematic (in the sense that the law gives legal\ninstitutions authority to identify the law), the courts’ decisions\ndetermine legal rights and obligations. So, we might say, a law is\nsource-based if its existence and content can be identified by\nreference to social facts alone, without resort to any evaluative\nargument, other than whatever evaluative argument may be needed to\ndetermine the social facts, or to work out their implications for the\ncase at hand.  \nRaz’s explanation of the nature of law is not undermined by the fact\nthat evaluative judgments are necessary in order to identify the\nimplications of the social fact that Parliament prohibited vehicles\nfrom being driven without pneumatic tires. It is still possible for\nlegal directives to have the exclusionary force that, in his theory of\nauthority, they claim. The court in Garner v Burr can decide\nwhether it is an offence to pull a chicken coop on wheels without\npneumatic tires, without answering the question, ‘should it be\nan offence to drag a chicken coop down a road on iron wheels?’,\nor the question, ‘should it be an offence to use a vehicle\nwithout pneumatic tires?’ But the court needs to ask the related\nquestion: ‘what is the relevant sense of “vehicle”\nfor the purposes of this Act?’ It is what Parliament did that\ndetermines Lawrence Burr’s liability; it may take evaluative reasoning\nto answer the question of social fact, ‘what did Parliament\nprohibit, when it prohibited vehicles from being driven without\npneumatic tires?’ \nA speed limit on a highway is a fairly precise law: in most cases it\nis clear whether a driver has conformed to the standard. But highway\ntraffic regulation also needs (and typically uses) rules against\ncareless or dangerous driving. Such abstract standards are designed to\ncontrol a variety of behaviour that lacks the uniform, measurable\nfeature (speed) that allows the precision of a speed limit. \nVague laws, such as a rule against careless driving, pose problems for\nphilosophy of law that are related to problems that philosophers of\nlanguage and of logic have addressed in arguments about the\nparadox of the heap (see the entry on the\n Sorites Paradox).\n Suppose that, according to law, it counts as careless driving to\ndrive with bald tires. If the law gives a precise definition of the\nthickness of tire tread that counts as bald, then in this regard the\nlaw is (more or less) precise, and for the purposes of the law,\nvirtually every tire is either clearly bald or clearly not bald. But\nif there is no such precise standard, then there are ‘borderline\ncases’ in which it is neither clearly true that a tire is bald,\nnor clearly false. And we can construct a sorites series, and\na sorites paradox for the application of the law: \n… \nN. So a tire never goes bald. \nN+1. So no one can ever break the rule against careless driving by\ndriving with bald tires. \nThe false conclusions N and N+1 arise by apparently valid reasoning\nfrom apparently true premises. Philosophical approaches to the paradox\nseem to have implications for legal theory: arguments that vague terms\nare incoherent, and that reasoning with them is impossible,\nwould support arguments that vague laws are incoherent. Since vague\nlaws are an important part of every legal system [Endicott 2001], the\nimplications seem to be far-reaching. \n‘Epistemic’ arguments that the only way to solve\nthe paradox is to deny the truth of step 2 (so that vagueness is a\nproblem of ignorance as to where the sharp boundary is between tires\nthat are and are not bald) imply that there is always a single right\nanswer to the application of a law stated in vague language. Arguments\nthat the application of a vague expression is indeterminate in\nborderline cases (or in some borderline cases) imply that the\napplication of a law that can be expressed in vague language is\nindeterminate in some cases. But it is even controversial whether such\ntheories matter to legal philosophy [Schiffer, 2001 and Greenawalt,\n2001]. \nPhilosophers of law have not been especially concerned with the\nquestion of how to solve (or to resolve) the paradox, but they have\ndebated the nature of borderline cases, and its implications for the\nrole of judges in a community, and for the possibility of the rule of\nlaw. If the application of vague laws is indeterminate in some cases,\nthen in those cases a judge (or other official) responsible for\napplying the law cannot decide the matter by applying the law, since\nthe law does not determine the matter (and in fact, no one can use the\nlaw to guide their conduct). \nSome legal philosophers have responded to this problem by claiming\nthat judges never (or virtually never) have such a choice, and that\nthere is virtually always a right answer to a question of legal rights\n[Dworkin, 1986a, 1991]. Others have responded to the problem by\nclaiming that the law gives judges discretion, in all or some\nborderline cases, to decide issues that the law does not determine\n[Hart, 2012, chapter VII.1]. That is, the standards of the system\nleave a choice to judges as to how to decide the issue. Then judges\nmust treat the parties to litigation as having liabilities or\nobligations or entitlements that were not determinately theirs at the\ntime when the dispute arose. That power of judges appears to some to\nrun contrary to the principle of the rule of law, that laws (or at\nleast, that legal burdens) should not be imposed retroactively. \nAs a result, vagueness raises an extraordinarily important set of\nproblems for the philosophy of law. It may seem to be a different set\nof problems from those raised by vague language in general, because of\nthree ways in which the legal use of vague language is distinctive.\nFirst, legal systems need to regulate the effects of the vagueness of\nlanguage, providing for authoritative resolution of disputes as to the\neffect of vague language (where in some other domains of the use of\nlanguage, we can get by without any such resolution). \nSecondly, vagueness in legal language is distinctive because lawmakers\navoid ordinary vague expressions like ‘driving very fast’\nand prefer precise speed limits (or blood alcohol limits, or tire\ntread measurements). When the law uses vague language, it uses\nabstract evaluative expressions. Lawmakers typically do not\nprohibit driving with ‘bald’ tires; they either impose\nprecise measures, or address the problem as part of an abstract,\ngeneral prohibition on, e.g., ‘careless’ driving. An\nabstract standard calls upon its subjects to construct a view of the\ncare that, in their law, a driver owes to another person—(and\nnot merely to ask the seemingly pointless question, how bald is a bald\ntire?). Such standards are a very common and a very important part of\nlawmaking technique. A negligence standard may require\n‘reasonable care’; a constitution may define a procedural\nright as a right to ‘due process’, or a contract may\nrequire the delivery of goods in ‘satisfactory condition’.\nThose abstract terms are very different from the vague descriptive\nterms that philosophers of logic use to illustrate their arguments\nabout the sorites paradox (‘heap’, ‘thin’,\n‘bald’, ‘red’…). It misses the point,\nyou might think, to say that abstract standards do not draw sharp\nlines, because they are not designed to draw lines at all. By using an\nabstract standard, the lawmaker requires the people who must apply the\nlaw to construct a theory of the standard (of care, or of process, or\nof condition), which will draw any line that is needed. Ronald Dworkin\nhas claimed that abstract expressions are not vague at all—that \nthey have a different semantics from that of vague words like\n‘heap’ (Dworkin, 1986b, 17). \nThirdly, the legal context of an expression may be very different from\nother contexts of its use. Principles of legal interpretation (for\nexample, a legal requirement that vague criminal enactments are to be\ninterpreted as applying only in clear cases) may make the legal effect\nof the use of a word more precise than its ordinary effect. The\ninterpretation of a legal prohibition on careless driving demands an\nunderstanding of what counts as careless for the purposes of the\nlaw. \nGiven these distinctive features of law, it may seem that logicians’\ndiscussions of heaps and baldness are beside the point, and that legal\nreasoning is exempt from any implications that the paradox may have\nfor logic or for semantics. That would be a mistake. Statements of law\nthat use abstract expressions certainly are vague in the philosophers’\nsense: that is, they appear to be susceptible to sorites reasoning.\n‘Careless driving’ in its legal sense is a much more\ncomplex concept than ‘driving with bald tires’, and\ndriving with bald tires is an instance of careless driving only in\nvirtue of the evaluative and contextual considerations that must be\nunderstood if the law of careless driving is to be understood. Yet\n‘careless driving’ is susceptible to sorites reasoning\nprecisely because those evaluative and contextual considerations give\nreason to conclude that it is careless to drive with bald tires. For\nall their complexity (and their relation to deep questions of the\nrights of the citizen and the responsibilities and the liabilities\nthat a community can justifiably impose on the citizen), those\nconsiderations do not determine a standard that is more\nprecise than a standard that could be expressed using such an\nordinary vague expression as ‘bald’. That is, those\nconsiderations do not provide a way of distinguishing between one tire\nin the sorites series and the next. Similarly, it is possible to\nconstruct sorites series for the application of even more abstract\nlegal standards such as the right to due process, or the United States\nconstitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. These\nevaluative tests have special legal meanings that can only be\nunderstood in the context of a legal system, and in the more\nparticular context of a specific area of law, and by reference to\ntheir elaboration and development in a common law system of precedent.\nEven with a mastery of all those aspects of the context, however, the\nbest theory of the effect of such standards will not provide a way of\ndistinguishing between one tire in the sorites series and the next. A\ntheory of careless driving in some particular legal system at a\nparticular time would be a defective theory, if it yielded the\nconclusion that the loss of one molecule of rubber from a tire can\nmake the difference between driving that is careless and driving that\nis not careless according to law.  \nConsider again the case of Garner v Burr (above, section\n2.2). The term ‘vehicle’, as properly understood for the\npurposes of the Road Traffic Act, is vague if there are borderline\ncases for its application (cases in which it is unclear whether the\nterm applies to some object). It may seem that nothing is more\npatently a borderline case of a ‘vehicle’ than a chicken\ncoop on wheels. But we should bear in mind that (if the discussion in\nsection 2.2 above is sound) the correct application of the term\ndepends on legal principles relating to the purposes of the\nlegislation and to the need for clarity in criminal liabilities. So\nthe chicken coop on wheels is a borderline case if it is unclear\nwhether those principles required the provision to be applied to it.\nAnd the application of the term was indeterminate in the case, if\nthose principles did not require a decision one way or the other. Of\ncourse, the appeal court held that a conviction was \nrequired—which we might say amounts to a \ndecision that the term applied to the\nchicken coop on wheels. The magistrates and the appeal court disagreed\nabout it, but that disagreement in itself does not mean either that\nthe application of the term was determinate or that it was\nindeterminate. And the fact that the appeal judges seem to have\nthought that the term clearly applied to the chicken coop cannot tell\nus that the application of the term was determinate. \nThe magistrates’ approach put a special emphasis on the principle of\ncertainty in criminal liability, and the appeal court’s approach put a\nspecial emphasis on the effective accomplishment of the purpose the\nlegislation was designed to pursue. Each approach would take the law\nin a different direction. The application of the term was\nindeterminate (before the decision of the appeal court set a\nprecedent) if neither approach was demanded by the complex resources\nof legal reasoning that the courts (as a matter of legal obligation)\nhad to act upon. If that was the case, then the appeal court’s\ndecision was not contrary to the law. But a decision upholding the\nacquittal would not have been contrary to the law, either. The law as\nit was at the time of the decision allowed the courts to move it in\neither direction. \nThat account of a case like Garner v Burr would support the\ncontroversial claim that judges have widespread discretion in\nresolving legal disputes. Legal philosophers have debated whether that\nclaim undermines the ideal of the rule of law, or reflects a basic\nrequirement of the rule of law: that a legal system needs techniques\nfor the resolution of legal issues that are not determined by the law\n(see Endicott 2000, chapter 9). \nBentham presented his theory as a definition. In focusing their\nattention on the meaning of the main terms of legal discourse, Bentham\nand John Austin were ahead of their time. But it has come to be a\ncommonplace view in legal theory (though still controversial) that\nthey were misguided in attempting to define those terms. So, for\nexample, Hart in the 1960s rejected definition as useful in philosophy\nof law (Hart 2012, 14–17). Dworkin in the 1980s accused Hart of\nonly repackaging the same approach as the ‘more candidly\ndefinitional’ method of John Austin (Dworkin 1986, 32–33).\nAnd Richard Posner in the 1990s accused both Hart and Dworkin of\npointlessly “trying to define ‘law’” (Posner\n1996, vii). \nThere is no reason to describe the work of Hart or Dworkin as defining\nthe word ‘law’. And defining that word would not solve any\nof the problems of jurisprudence (as Hart pointed out). The\nfundamental reason is that a definition is useful only to someone who\nneeds to learn the meaning of a word, and legal philosophers know the\nmeaning of the word ‘law’. Their problems and their\ndisputes would not be resolved by a statement that would help someone\nwho did not know what the word meant. Philosophers of law cannot solve\ntheir problems by giving a definition of the word ‘law’,\nany more than philosophers of language can solve their problems by\ngiving a definition of the word ‘language’ (for discussion\nof the implications for legal philosophy of the semantics and\nmetasemantics of the word ‘law’, see Coleman and Simchen\n2003). \nA further reason is that, as John Finnis and Ronald Dworkin have both\nexplained in different ways, the word ‘law’ can be used in\na variety of senses: the law of the jungle, the law of gravity, laws\nof thought, Murphy’s law, etc. (Finnis 1980, 6; Dworkin 1986, 104). A\ndefinition would have to allow for those senses. It might be an\nintriguing (and arduous) study in culture and human thought to explain\nthe analogies among those senses, but it is a study that holds out no\nspecial promise for understanding the law of a community. \nLegal philosophers have tried to explain the normativity of\nlaw—the fact that the law of a community is, or presents\nitself as, a guide to the conduct of members of a community. One easy\nway to express this abstract feature of law is by pointing out that\nthe law can be stated by making normative statements (i.e. statements\nthat use expressions like ‘obligation’,\n‘right’, ‘must’, ‘may’). And one\nattractive way of trying to explain the normativity of law is by\nexplaining the meaning and use of the normative language that is often\nused in stating the law. That is, the problem of explaining the nature\nof legal norms (obligations, rights, etc.) can be addressed by\nexplaining the meaning or the use of the normative words that are used\nin law (‘obligation’, ‘right’,…).\nJoseph Raz has put it that ‘The problem of the normativity of\nlaw is the problem of explaining the use of normative language in\ndescribing the law or legal situations.’ (1990, 170) \nWe saw that Bentham’s theory of normative language in general was\nthat, because there is no perceptible substance or emotion for which\nthey stand as a name, words such as ‘right’ must be\n‘expounded’ by paraphrasing sentences containing them. The\nparaphrase would use sentences that contain only words that can be\ndefined as referring to substances and perceptions. When no such\nparaphrase is available, he considered that normative language is\nmeaningless. So he held that the phrase ‘natural rights’\nis “simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible rights,\nrhetorical nonsense; nonsense upon stilts” (Bentham 1843,\nArt.II). While the language is meaningless, he thought, we can explain\nits use—as a way of doing something. Using such nonsensical\nexpressions is a way in which the speaker expresses his\npreferences. \nAlthough Bentham and John Austin thought that the notion of a\nnatural right was nonsense, they did not at all think the\nsame about the notion of legal rights. In their command\ntheory they found a way of paraphrasing normative expressions in their\nlegal use. They explained the meaning of the word \n‘duty’—and thereby the normativity of \nlaw—by reference to the\npain and pleasure that a superior offered as motivation for compliance\nwith the superior’s will: \nHart used the resources of twentieth-century philosophy to challenge\nthat approach to normative language. He drew on the work of J.L.\nAustin, a philosopher of language who thought that problems in many\nareas of philosophy could be dissolved by pointing out the things that\npeople do with words. J.L. Austin once suggested that “a\nstatement of ‘the law’” is a performative statement,\nrather than “a statement of fact” (Austin 1962, 4 n.2).\nThe suggestion is that to state the law is to perform an act (an act\nother than the making of an assertion that could be true or false).\nJ.L. Austin’s claim offered to account for the normativity of law by\nreference to the things that people do with words. That hint attracted\nHart (Hart, 1954), whose theory of law is based on a ‘practice\ntheory of rules’. He articulated the theory by pointing out what\npeople do with the normative language they use in stating rules. \nHart started by arguing that Bentham and Austin had explained the\nmeaning and use of normative language in a way that failed to account\nfor its role in ordinary discourse. He pointed out that their account\nof the meaning of the word ‘duty’ left them unable to draw\na distinction that people ordinarily draw in their use of language,\nbetween the command of a gunman (which no one would say imposes a\n‘duty’ or an ‘obligation’), and a legal\nprescription: \nBentham and Austin would have had a ready response: that people\nordinarily misuse the word ‘obligation’. They fail to give\nit a meaning that can be expounded by reference to sensible objects.\nBentham and Austin were linguistic philosophers, but (unlike J.L.\nAustin) not ordinary language philosophers. They sought a way of using\nlanguage that would back up their empiricism and utilitarianism, and\nthey were actually pleased if that technique called for a\nreorganisation of ordinary language: it showed that they were\ndisclosing what had been obscured by prejudice and cant. \nHart’s approach to language was different. It may seem that he did not\nneed to talk about language, and that his point could have been made\nwithout mentioning types of assertions, or what ‘we would\nsay’. His argument, you might think, simply puts into the\nlinguistic mode an argument that could be made with no mention of\nlanguage: an argument that you can have an obligation without being\nliable to sanction. And yet, the linguistic form of the argument was\nimportant to Hart. He wanted to avoid explaining the difference\nbetween obligation and coercion in the way a natural law theorist\nmight (by saying that an obligation is a kind of reason). So his focus\non the use of the word ‘obligation’ is no\naccident. He did not point out the way we use that word as an oblique\nway of appealing to our shared wisdom as to what obligation\nis. It was actually important to him to point out how we\nuse the word. His explanation of the normativity of law\nrelies on the use of such words to display an attitude. \nHart claimed that a legal system is a system of power-conferring and\nduty-imposing rules, which are validated by a ‘rule of\nrecognition’. That rule is not made valid by another rule; it is\na ‘social rule’. It is in Hart’s explanation of that\ncrucial notion of a social rule, that he turned to the use of words to\nexplain the normativity of law. He claimed that a social rule is a\nregular pattern of conduct accompanied by a ‘distinctive\nnormative attitude’, which ‘consists in the standing\ndisposition of individuals to take such patterns of conduct both as\nguides to their own future conduct and as standards of\ncriticism’ (Hart, 2012, 255). In accounting for that\ndisposition, or ‘internal attitude’, Hart’s emphasis was\non speech acts—on the use that participants in the practice\nmake of normative language.  \nHart’s interest in normative language was focused not on its meaning,\nbut on the attitude that people display when they use it. His\nexplanation of the difference between non-normative and normative\nassertions (between, as he put it, ‘the assertion that someone\nwas obliged to do something and the assertion that he had\nan obligation to do it’) was merely that the latter sort of\nassertion is used to display a distinctive sort of attitude. \nJust as Bentham’s approach to normative language was allied to his\nempiricism and his utilitarianism, Hart’s approach to normative\nlanguage was allied to his philosophical methodology, and to his views\non the relation between law and morality. His methodological purpose\nwas to describe human practices, and he wanted to defend a conceptual\nseparation between law and morality—a distinction in kind\nbetween legal obligation and moral obligation (see Hart 2012,\n239–240). The practice theory of rules attracted him as a tool\nfor those purposes, because it offered a way of accounting for the\nnormativity of law by pointing to forms of behaviour which could be\ndescribed, and which did not (in his view) carry any moral baggage. In\nsaying that people use normative language to display an attitude to\nregularities of behaviour, the theorist did not need to do moral\nphilosophy, and did not need to make any moral evaluations of the\npractice being described. The theorist did not even need to ascribe\nany moral evaluations to the participants in the practice, since the\nfact that people use normative language to display an attitude is,\nHart considered, consistent with their having various moral views or\nnone at all. \nHow much simpler it would be to say that normative language means the\nsame in its moral uses and in its legal uses. While a person who says\nthat you must stop at a red light may display various attitudes, what\nhe or she asserts is a necessity that implies a\n(presumptively) conclusive reason to stop. If the statement is a\nstatement of law, the necessity is a legal necessity; if the statement\nis a moral statement, the necessity is a moral statement. \nThat approach is not only simpler; it closes the gap that Hart left in\nhis theory. According to Hart, the meaning of normative language\ndiffers in morality and in law. But in fact, Hart had nothing to say\nabout the meaning of normative expressions such as\n‘ought’ and ‘must’ or ‘obligation’\nor ‘right’ (except that their meaning differs in law and\nin morality). He only pointed out that people display an attitude when\nthey use such language. \nJoseph Raz rejected Hart’s claim that normative terms have a\ndistinctive meaning in statements of law. In Raz’s view, to make a\nnormative statement such as ‘you must stop at a red light’\nis to imply that you have a certain sort of reason for action. If it\nis a statement applying the law, it implies that you have reason to\nstop from the point of view of the law. Raz’s theory of law, unlike\nHart’s, is part of a theory of practical reason in general, and his\naccount of normative statements treats them as having the same meaning\nin law and in morality. Hart initially thought that that approach\nwould necessarily lead to an extreme sort of natural law theory, in\nwhich every true statement of law is necessarily a true moral\nstatement, and every valid legal obligation is necessarily a moral\nobligation. But Raz resolved that concern of Hart’s, by pointing out\nthat normative statements can be made in a detached way. People can\nmake them without endorsing the point of view from which the reasons\nthey are stating are valid (see Raz 1990, 175–177). Still, Hart\ndid not accept Raz’s approach, which he felt created a certain sort of\nconceptual connection between law and morality. In responding to Raz,\nhe insisted that ‘statements of the subject’s legal duties need\nhave nothing directly to do with the subject’s reasons for\naction’ (Hart 1982, 267). And in an interview with the Spanish\njournal Doxa near the end of his career he maintained\n‘that legal and moral obligation are conceptually\ndifferent’ in the sense that a statement of obligation has a\ndifferent meaning in law and in morality (De Paramo 1988). He never\nexplained the difference in meaning; its necessity only follows from a\nmethodological preconception.","contact.mail":"timothy.endicott@law.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"law.ox.ac.uk"}]
