Three main traditions are considered: the one dealing with\nontic models, the one focusing on probabilistic models and the one\nutilizing epistemic models of conditionals.\n\n\n\nAlthough conditional logic has been studied rather intensively during\nthe last 50 years or so, the topic has both ancient and medieval roots\n(starting in the Stoic school, as the monograph Sanford 1989 explains\nin detail). Much of the contemporary work can nevertheless be traced\nback to a remark in a footnote appearing in Ramsey 1929. This passage\nhas been interpreted and re-interpreted (sometimes from opposite\npoints of view) by many scholars since Ramsey's writings become\navailable. \n \nAlthough the work on conditionals is vast and therefore quite\ndifficult to survey adequately, we can at least distinguish a first\ncontemporary wave of work, such as Chisholm 1946, Goodman 1955,\nRescher 1964, and others, which sprang from the late 1940s to the\nearly 1960s. This wave of work is usually referred to as encompassing\nthe so-called cotenability theories of conditionals. The\nbasic idea of this view is that a conditional is assertable if its\nantecedent, together with suitable (co-tenable) premises, entails its\nconsequent. In a certain way this work prefigured the discussions that\nwould ensue after the end of the 1960s. In fact, one can also evaluate\nthe truth conditions of conditionals under this point of view\nby saying that a conditional is true if an argument from the\nantecedent and suitable co-tenable premises to the conditional's\nconclusion exists. So, this theory is neutral with regard to the issue\nof whether conditionals carry truth-values or not. The theory can\ndeliver both a theory of assertability and a theory of truth for\nconditionals. \n\nThe type of analysis of conditionals a la Goodman, for example,\nprovides truth conditions for conditionals in terms of the following\ntest: a > b is true if b follows by law\nfrom a together with the set Γ of true sentences\nc such that it is not the case that a > ¬\nc. This proposal is problematic given that it produces truth\nconditions for conditionals in terms of the truth conditions of other\nconditionals. Any hope of breaking free of Goodman's circle requires to\nprovide an independent characterization of Γ . There are some\nsophisticated attempts to do so in the 1980's like the one contained\nin Kvart (1986). So, the ideas of Goodman and some of the cotenability\ntheorists have been developed more recently by scholars who appealed to\ncareful analysis of the causal and temporal structure of events to\ngive an independent characterization of Goodman's Γ. But, for the\nmost part, these theories have not significantly advanced discussions\nabout the logic of conditionals. \n \nThree alternative logical accounts were born during a period of 10\nyears, from approximately 1968 to 1978. Stalnaker 1968 deploys a\npossible worlds semantics for conditionals and offers an axiom system\nas well.  Here we have clearly a truth conditional account, which was\nfollowed by the influential book Lewis 1973. The latter was inspired\nby the same ontic interpretation of conditionals that guided\nStalnaker's work. \n \nAdams 1975 adopts a completely different approach based on studying\nformally the idea that the probability of (non-nested) conditionals is\ngiven by the corresponding conditional probability. This account was\npreceded by essays which antedated Stalnaker 1968 and it focuses\non a (probabilistic) theory of acceptance for conditionals, rather\nthan a theory of truth. \n \nGärdenfors 1978 follows a third line of inquiry focused on\nproviding acceptability conditions for conditionals in terms of\n(non-probabilistic) belief revision policies.  A forerunner of this\ntradition can be found in Mackie 1962 and 1972, and in the work of\nthose who elaborated on these writings, e.g., Harper 1975, 1976, and\nLevi 1977.  Moreover, Levi 1988 is an important essay that\ncomplemented Gärdenfors' work. \n \nMost of the contemporary work on conditional logic can be associated\nwith work done in one of these traditions or combinations of\nthem. But, of course, given the prodigious amount of work done in this\nfield, there are articles or even books that do not fit perfectly in\none of these categories or even combinations of them. The\n(non-probabilistic) work centering on indicative conditionals is one\nof these areas, as well as the important work combining chance, time\nand conditionals. Some notes and pointers to further reading will be\nprovided in this regard in the final section of this survey. \n \nThe other source of important work in conditional logic in recent\nyears is computer science. Part of this work is related to models of\ncausal conditionals and part of it is related to work in the\narea of non-monotonic logic. We will not have enough space to\nsurvey both, but we will provide bibliographical pointers to the\nformer and we will offer some background and connections with more\nmainstream work in philosophical logic for the latter. \n \nRamsey (1929) invites us to consider the following scenario. A man has\na cake and decides not to eat it because he thinks it will upset his\nstomach. We, on the other hand, consider his conduct and decide that\nhe is wrong. Ramsey analyzed this situation as follows: \n \nFootnote 1 in the text quoted above provides further\nclarification: \n \nThis is the textual evidence that has inspired a great deal of\ntheoretical work in recent years about the nature of conditionals and\ntheir acceptability- (or truth-) conditions. Ramsey himself did not\nthink that conditionals are truth carriers. He thought nevertheless\nthat there are rational conditions for accepting and rejecting\nconditionals. The footnote in Ramsey's article intends to provide a\nrational test for acceptance and rejection of this kind.  In spite of\nthis, many authors used Ramsey's ideas as a source of inspiration to\npropose truth conditions for conditionals. Perhaps the most explicit\nmaneuver of this kind is offered in Stalnaker 1968. \n Let us consider first Stalnaker's (1968) assessment of Ramsey's\nideas:  \n \nOf course Stalnaker is aware of the fact that this procedure was\ncompletely specified by Ramsey only in the case in which the agent has\nno opinion about the truth value of the antecedent of the conditional\nthat is being evaluated. Therefore he asked himself how the procedure\nsuggested by Ramsey can be extended to cover the remaining cases. He\nanswered as follows: \n After formulating his version of the Ramsey test, Stalnaker completed\nthe transition from belief conditions to truth conditions using the\nconcept of ‘possible world’: \n The concept of possible world is just what we need to make\nthis transition, since a possible world is the ontological analogue of\na stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is the first approximation to the\naccount I shall propose: \n An analysis in terms of possible worlds has also the advantage of\nproviding a ready-made apparatus on which to build a semantical\ntheory. \n \nStalnaker proposes a transition from epistemology to metaphysics via\nthe use of the pivotal notion of ‘possible world’. We will\nsee below, nevertheless, that Stalnaker's proposed transition is\ntantamount to a change of theme. Ramsey thought that conditionals are\nnot truth value bearers, but that they have exact acceptability\n conditions.[2]\n A more faithful rendering of Ramsey's ideas, compatible\nwith the idea that conditionals do not carry truth-values, can also\nlead to an exact logical and semantical analysis. But the conditionals\nthat thus arise have different structural properties from the\nontological conditionals studied via Stalnaker's test. \n \nThere is a fair amount of work focusing on the study of the logic of\ntruth value bearing conditionals. The standard apparatus of model\ntheory can be extended with techniques similar to the ones used in\nmodal logic, in order to study these conditionals. Our first section\nof this survey will focus on reviewing work in this tradition. The\nmain challenge faced in this section will be to identify a semantical\napproach capable of accommodating parametrically the main syntactic\nsystems proposed in the literature (including weak non-normal ones\nthat have played an interesting role in applications in computer\nscience). \n \nThere are two main traditions which focus on delivering acceptability\nconditions for conditionals rather than truth conditions. They are\ninspired by (diverging) interpretations of Ramsey's original test. One\nof them focuses on the expression ‘degrees of belief’ in\nthe footnote. The central idea here is that the agents ‘fix\ntheir degrees of belief in q given p’, by\nconditioning on p, via classical Bayesian conditionalization.\nRoughly this is the research program pursued by Ernst Adams (1965,\n1966, 1975) and some of his students and many followers. The leading\nidea is to develop a probabilistic semantics for conditionals. Section\nfour below will be devoted to consider this type of semantics for\nconditionals. \n \nThe option pursued by Adams, McGee, et al. interprets Ramsey as\nproviding an acceptability test of probabilistic kind according to\nwhich the probability of a conditional is given by the corresponding\nconditional probability. Lewis 1976 provides a well known proof\nagainst the tenability of this idea. We will review this result below\nand we will consider the important role it played for researchers\nworking in this tradition. \n \nThere is as well an alternative line of research initiated in\nGärdenfors 1978, which deploys a non-probabilistic theory of\nacceptance for conditionals, while at the same time preserves\nimportant connections with the ontologically motivated research\nprogram of Stalnaker, and Lewis.  But, unlike Stalnaker,\nGärdenfors thinks that the Ramsey test is a test of acceptance\nand not a springboard to build a possible worlds semantics for\nconditionals. We will outline the main idea behind Gärdenfors'\nproposal in the following section. \n \nGärdenfors 1988 developed a semantical theory of a\ncognitive kind and applied it to formalize Ramsey's ideas. Contrary to\nwhat is claimed in many classical semantical theories, Gärdenfors\nmaintains that ‘a sentence does not get its meaning from some\ncorrespondence with the world but that the meaning can be determined\nonly in relation to a belief system’.  A belief system\naccording to Gärdenfors is a system formed from: (1) a class of\nmodels of epistemic states, (2) a valuation function determining the\nepistemic attitudes in the state for each epistemic state, (3) a class\nof epistemic inputs, and (4) an epistemic commitment function\n* that for a given state of belief K and a given epistemic\ninput a, determines a new suppositional state\nK*a. \n \nA semantical theory consists in a mapping from a linguistic\nstructure to a belief system. If we focus on a Boolean language\nL0 free from modal or epistemic operators, and we\nassume that belief states are modeled by deductively closed set of\nsentences (belief sets) then three main attitudes can be\ndistinguished.  For any sentence a ∈\nL0 and a belief set K ∈\nL0, \n \nAcceptance is the crucial epistemic attitude used in\nGärdenfors' semantical theory. In fact, the meaning of\nexpressions of L0 is delivered in terms of\nacceptability criteria rather than truth\nconditions. The Ramsey test can be used very naturally in the\ncontext of Gärdenfors' semantics to provide acceptability\ncriteria for sentences of the form ‘If a, then b’\n(abbreviated ‘a > b’) expressed in a\nlanguage L> ⊇ L0. Of\ncourse in this case we need to appeal to the epistemic commitment\nfunction *. For every a, b ∈\nL0: \n \nIf one pre-systematically sees conditionals as truth value-bearers it\nwould be natural to articulate the notion of acceptance utilized in\n(Accept >) as belief in the truth of a corresponding\nconditional. Moreover, since the current belief set K\ncontains all sentences fully believed as true by the agent, then the\nacceptance of ‘if a, then b’ has to be\nmirrored by membership in K. This idea can be expressed by\nthe following Reduction Condition. \n \nSo, (Accept  >) can now be rewritten as follows: \n \n(GRT) is indeed Gärdenfors' version of the Ramsey test. Of course\nGärdenfors' semantical theory, extended with suitable epistemic\nvariants of the classical notions of satisfaction, validity and\nentailment, will be capable of providing epistemic models for\nconditional operators.  (GRT) behaves in such a theory as a\n‘bridge-clause’ relating (in a one-to-one fashion)\nproperties of * with properties of ‘>’. \n \nGärdenfors (1988) was specially interested in studying the\nbehavior of his epistemic models when * obeys the constraints of a\nqualitative version of conditionalization called AGM in the\n literature.[3]\n Nevertheless, as Gärdenfors himself points out, there are only\ntrivial models that satisfy these constraints. In fact,\nGärdenfors proved that (GRT) and three very intuitive postulates\nof belief change are, on pain of triviality, inconsistent.  This\nresult plays a similar role in this research program to the role\nplayed by Lewis's impossibility result in the probabilistic research\nprogram. \n \nWe will show below that (GRT) is also in conflict with weaker\nconstraints on *, which are uncontroversially required by Ramsey in\nhis own formulation of ‘the Ramsey test'. In doing so we will\nprove a very strong variant of the so-called Gärdenfors'\nimpossibility theorem. \n \n(GRT) delivers a theory of acceptance of conditionals that can be\npre-systematically understood as truth value bearers, and which\ntherefore have little in common with Ramsey's conditionals.\nGärdenfors himself arrived at this conclusion in (1988), although\nhe did not provide an alternative to (GRT) in order to carry out\nfurther Ramsey's semantic\n program.[4]\n In the following section we will present a possible alternative. \n \nIt should be evident by now that a genuine representation of Ramsey's\nideas requires a more sophisticated notion of acceptance.  Of course\nthere is no need to distinguish between acceptance and full belief in\nthe case of truth-value bearing propositions of\nL0. But we also need a notion of acceptance\ncapable of characterizing the acceptance of sentences that lack truth\nvalues but express important cognitive attitudes. Ramsey's\nconditionals are a perfect example of this kind of sentence. Levi\n(1988) offers a theory of acceptance of this sort. \n \nLet L0 be a Boolean language free of modal and\nepistemic operators. The full beliefs of an agent X are\nrepresented by the set of sentences of L0 accepted\nby X at a certain point of time t. This set\nK of sentences of L0 should be closed\nunder logical consequence. \n \nUnder X's point of view all items in K, at time\nt, are true. They serve as a basis for modal judgments of\nserious possibility that, in turn, lack truth values. For example, if\na is accepted in K, we can say that ¬a\nis not a serious possibility according to the point of view of\nX, at time t. By the same token, ‘if\na, then b’ is an appraisal concerning the\nserious possibility of b relative to the transformation of\nK (via the addition of a) and not to K\nitself. These epistemic conditionals lack truth values and are\nsomewhat ‘parasitic’ on K and its\ndynamics. Acceptance of these conditionals cannot be formally mirrored\nby membership in K. Nevertheless this does not mean that we\ncannot recognize a derived corpus expressible in an extended language\nL>, of those L>\nsentences whose acceptability is grounded on the adoption of\nK and the agent's commitments for change at time\nt. \n \nThe conditionals accepted by X at time t can be\naccommodated in a ‘support set’ s(K)\n⊇ K. Levi proposes, in addition, to close\ns(K) under logical consequence. Finally any sentence\na ∈ L0 that belongs to\ns(K) also belongs to K. \n \nNow, the Ramsey test can be expressed as follows: \n \nThe possibility of complementing the Ramsey test with a\n‘negative version’ of it capable of dealing with negated\nconditionals, has been thoroughly investigated by the\nGärdenforsian tradition.  Gärdenfors et al. 1989 concluded\nthat on the presence of very weak constraints on *, (GRT) cannot be\ncomplemented with the following ‘negative version’ of\nit: \n \nThe result should not be surprising.  Notice that (GRT) and (NRT)\nimply that a > b is rejected if and only if\na > b is not accepted.  In other words, an agent\nX cannot be in suspense about a conditional a >\nb.  This result, highly unintuitive when applied to\ntruth-value bearing conditionals, is nevertheless less problematic\n(and one could argue, natural) for conditionals that lack truth\nvalues.  So, it is not surprising that (GRT) cannot be supplemented by\n(NRT), due to the nature of the conditionals studied by the test.  It\nshould not be surprising either that once the Reduction Condition is\nremoved, the addition of the following negative version of (SRT) is\nabsolutely harmless: \n \nWe will conclude this essay by offering a survey of the logical\nsystems validated via these two tests. The theory can also be extended\nto provide acceptance conditions for iterated epistemic\nconditionals. When the underlying language is rich enough to include\niterated conditionals as well as Boolean nesting of conditionals, some\nnew conditional systems arise that have not been previously studied in\nthe ontic tradition. But first we will review the main logical systems\nstudied in the ontic tradition as well as some of the most salient\nproposals for a unified semantics (utilizing truth conditions). \n \nLet's consider first a set of important rules of inference for\nconditional logics. The rules contain a symbol to encode the material\nconditional ‘→’ used in classical logic, as well as\nthe symbol ‘↔’ encoding a material\nbiconditional. They also contain the symbol for the standard notion of\nconjunction. \n \nThe variable n should be greater than or equal to 0 in the\nformulation of RCK. Conditional logics closed under\nRCEA and RCK are called normal. Conditional\nlogics closed under RCEA and RCEC are called\nclassical. A conditional logic closed under RCEA is\nrespectively monotonic or regular if it is closed\nunder RCM or RCR. The terminology is the one used in\nChellas 1980. \n The rules RCEC and RCEA introduce a very weak\nrequirement according to which substitutions by logically equivalent\nformulas is possible respectively in antecedents and consequents of\nconditionals. Although this is only implicit in the notation the rules\nare supposed to preserve theoremhood, i.e. we suppress the occurrence\nof the syntactic turnstile both in antecedents and in consequents. \n The rule RCM receives in other contexts (non-monotonic\nlogic) the name ‘Right Weakening’. The idea of the rule\nis to permit the derivation of conditionals with logically weaker\nconsequents from conditionals with the same antecedent and logically\nstronger antecedents. We will make some comments about regular and\nnormal conditional logics after we introduce the following list of\nsalient axioms. \n\n Some of these axioms are relatively controversial for some\ninterpretations of the conditional, some are constitutive of the very\nnotion of conditional. An example of an axioms of the latter type is\nthe axiom ID, which states syntactically the idea that the\nresult of supposing an item is always successful. When new information\nis received then not all changes of view need to incorporate the\ninformation. One possible output could be to prioritize the background\ninformation when the new information is very surprising. But the\nresult of supposing an item presupposes that the information in\nquestion is indeed part of the suppositional scenario created by the\nsupposition of the said item. \n Regarding monotonic systems one can state that a system is monotonic\nif and only if it contains CM and is closed under\nRCEC. There are two alternative ways of characterizing the\nregular systems introduced above only in terms of inference rules by\nutilizing axioms.  A conditional system is regular if and only if it\ncontains CC and is closed under RCM.  And,\nalternatively, a system is regular if and only if it contains\nCC and CM and is closed under RCEC. \n The axiom CN intuitively states that the suppositional\nscenario opened by hypothesizing an item always contains all logical\ntruths.  The axiom MP, for modus ponens states a\nconnection between the material conditional and the more general\nnotion of conditionality encoded by ‘>’. The idea is\nthat every conditional entails the corresponding material\nconditional. Most of the remaining axioms will be discussed in the\ncontext of particular logical systems. \n\nThe smallest classical conditional logic will be called\nCE and the smallest normal conditional logic will be\ncalled CK. Of course there are important classical\nand non-normal conditional systems like the system\nCEMN which will see later on can be used to encode\nhigh probability conditionals. CE is a very weak\nconditional system free from most assumptions about conditionality,\neven some that we called constitutive of conditionality like the axiom\nID.  CK, even when considerably stronger\nthan CE, is nevertheless a very weak system as well\n(where axioms like ID continue not to be endorsed).  \n \nA weak system studied in the literature is the system\nB proposed in Burgess 1981. This system is the\nsmallest monotonic system containing ID, CC,\nCA and CSO. If we add CV to\nB we get the system V which is the\nweakest system of conditionals studied in Lewis 1973. Although Lewis\nbook studies counterfactual systems the motivation behind the system\nV is the study of conditional obligation. It also\nturns out that the system V, as well as the system\nB, has interesting applications in artificial\nintelligence (these systems are the weakest conditional systems whose\nnon-nested fragment coincide with well known systems of non-monotonic\nlogic—we will tackle this issue below). Another system that has\nbeen discussed by computer scientists is the system that Halpern calls\nAXcond; see Halpern (2003). The system has axioms\nID, CC, CA, CMon, and it is closed\nunder modus ponens RCEA and RCM. We will see below\nthat there are important connections of this system with the system\nP\n of non-monotonic logic (see section 4.4 below).\n\n \n \nMany philosophers working with ontic conditionals in general and\ncounterfactuals in particular, think that MP is required for\nmodeling this type of conditionals and some of them also think that\nCS is required as well. Examples are Pollock (1981), who\nproposed his system SS obtained by adding MP\nand CS to B, and David Lewis whose\n‘official’ axiomatization of the logic of counterfactuals\nis the system VC obtained by adding MP and\nCS to V. Lewis, nevertheless, considers as\nwell a weaker system, the system VW obtained by\nadding only MP to V. Another salient system\nis the system C2 of Stalnaker which can be obtained\nfrom VC by replacing CS by the stronger\nCEM (conditional excluded middle). The best way of\narticulating these choice of axioms is in terms of semantic\nconsiderations, which will be introduced in the following\nsections. \n \nAnother salient system in recent discussions about conditionals was\nproposed in Delgrande (1987), the system NP. We will\nalso return to this system while discussing (briefly) connections with\nnon-monotonic logic later on and we will characterize it semantically\nbelow. \n \nOne of the best known semantics for conditionals can be built\n(following ideas first presented in Stalnaker 1968) by utilizing\nselection functions. To evaluate a conditional a\n> b at a world w the semantics uses a function\nf:W×2W →\nW. The underlying idea behind Stalnaker's semantics was\npresented informally above: \n\nSo, the selection function f(w,\n|a|M) would yield the\n‘closest’ a-world to w—where\n|a|M denotes the proposition expressed by\nthe sentence a in the model M. This semantics can be\ngeneralized in various ways. One of these ways has been offered by\nLewis who proposes to use a function\nf:W×2W →\n2W. So, this generalization allows for the\nexistence of various a-worlds that are equally close to\nw. \n \nBut this generalization cannot be used to deliver a unified semantics\nfor the entire class of classical conditional logics. It is still too\nstrong for characterizing systems like B. J. Burgess\n(1981) offered one of the first attempts to develop a unified\nsemantics covering systems like B. \n \nBurgess (1981) pointed out that a semantics in terms of selection\nfunctions does not work for his system B, and he\nproposed a different semantics in terms of three-place ordering\nrelations: \n\nWe will now list a set of restrictions over the ordering models that\nwill be useful in the following discussion: \n \nWith the help of these restrictions we can characterize the following\nimportant systems: \n \nA second proposal for unification has been proposed by Brian\nF. Chellas (1980), who, in turn, follows ideas first presented for\nmonadic modalities by Dana Scott (1970) and Richard Montague\n(1970). \n\nThe idea is to have a function, which given a proposition and a world\nyields a set of propositions instead of a single proposition. The\nresulting set of propositions can be interpreted in many ways. For\nexample, Chellas sees them as necessary propositions given the\nantecedent. So, this might motivate the notation\n[a]b rather than a > b. Or the\npropositions in question can be the propositions that are highly\nprobable conditional on the antecedent a, etc. We will use\nhere the notation F(i, X) where X\nis a proposition, i is the world of reference and\nF(i, X) is a set of sets of worlds. We will\ncall these functions set selection functions or\nneighborhood selection functions. \n \nFollowing Chellas' notation we can introduce minimal\nconditional model\n 〈W,\n F, P 〉\n where W is a set of primitive points, F is a\nfunction F: W×2W →\n22W, and P is a valuation. The\ntruth conditions for the conditional are given as follows: \n\nThis is not the only possible truth definition in this setting\nalthough this is the one used by Chellas in his book on modal\nlogic. One possible alternative would be: \n\nThe two definitions are co-extensional as long as the conditional\nneighborhoods are closed under supersets (i.e. they are\nmonotonic). But they do not coincide in general. Patrick Girard (2006)\nargues for the latter\n definition.[5] \n \nThe system CE is the smallest conditional logic\nclosed under the rules RCEA and RCEC.\nCE is determined by all minimal conditional\nframes. The system CM is the smallest conditional\nsystem closed under RCM. CM is determined by\nthe class of minimal frames for which the following condition holds\n(where the letters Y, X and Z, and primed\ninstances of them, denote propositions): \n \nCR is the smallest conditional logic closed under\nRCR. CR is determined by the class of frames\nin which both (cm) and the following condition\nhold: \n\nThe logics containing classical propositional logic and having the\nrules RCEA and RCK are called normal. The\nsmallest normal conditional logic is the system\nCK. The system CK is determined by\nthe class of frames satisfying (cm),\n(cc) and: \n\nObviously we can have conditions corresponding directly to the list of\naxioms presented in previous sections. For example we have: \n \nThe system B proposed by Burgess in an interesting\npaper (1981) can be characterized in terms of the conditions\n(cc), (ca), (cso),\n(id) and (cm). In fact the system in\nquestion contains the axioms ID, CC, CA and\nCSO, and is closed under the rule RCM. The weakest\nconditional system in Lewis' hierarchy, the system V,\ncan be obtained by adding the condition on selection functions\ncorresponding to the axiom CV: \n\nAnd if we subtract the condition (cm) from the\nconditions characterizing V we get the system\nNP first proposed by J. Delgrande (1987). \n\nA class selection function F is augmented  if and\nonly if we have: \n\nFor every augmented set selection function F we can define an\nordinary selection function f by setting\nf(w, X) =\n∩F(w, X). \n \nPerhaps the main normal systems are the systems C2 of\nStalnaker, the system VC of Lewis, the system\nSS of Pollock and some of the weaker systems in the\nLewis hierarchy of conditional systems, like VW.\nIntuitively all these systems are minimal change theories, to\nuse the terminology employed in Cross and Nute (2001). According to\nthis view a conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at\nevery member of some selected set of worlds where the antecedent is\ntrue. Some notion of minimality is deployed to determined the suitable\nset of worlds where the antecedent holds true. Since here we are\nconsidering ontic conditionals usually what is minimized is some\nontological notion like the distance between the actual world and a\nset of worlds where the antecedent is true. \n \nAccording to Stalnaker there is always one and only one world most\nlike the actual world where the antecedent holds true. This gives\nsupport to the strong condition called conditional excluded\nmiddle. Lewis, allows the existence of a set of worlds that are most\nlike the actual world and therefore he abandons CEM, but\nstill endorses strong axioms like CS and CV. \n \nLewis' semantics can be better formulated in terms of systems of\nspheres models. We will present these models immediately and then\nwe will compare them with models in terms of selection functions. \n \nA system of spheres model is an ordered triple M =\n 〈W,\n $, P〉\n where W is a set of points, P is a\nvaluation function and $ a function which assigns to each i\nin W a nested set $i of subsets of\nW (the spheres about i). Following the terminology\nof Cross and Nute (2001) to characterize VC, we need\nthe following restrictions on system of spheres models: \n \nLet a sphere S ∈ $i be called\na-permitting if and only if\n ∪$i\n ∩ |a| ≠\n ∅ (for the sake of brevity we omit in this section the\nrelativity of each proposition to the corresponding model\n M).[6]\n The so called Limit Assumption (LA) establishes that if\n ∪$i ∩ |a|\n≠ ∅ then there is a smallest A-permitting\nsphere. Lewis has argued against having the Limit Assumption as a\nconstraint on system of spheres models. Notice, nevertheless, that his\ntruth conditions do not require determining the smallest\na-permitting sphere in order to evaluate a >\nb. \n\nWhat is the connection between a semantic in terms of systems of\nspheres models and in terms of selection functions? Given a system of\nspheres we can always specify a derived selection function as\nfollows: let f(a, w) be the set of\na-worlds belonging to every a-permitting sphere in\n$i, if there is any a-permitting sphere\nin $i; or the empty set otherwise. Then if we use\nthe usual truth conditions for selection functions, the truth\nconditions determined via selection functions derived from a system of\nspheres satisfying the Limit Assumption coincide with the truth\nconditions in terms of system of spheres (this is the reason invoked\nin Cross and Nute 2001 for classifying Lewis' theory of conditionals\nas a minimal change theory). But if the selection function is derived\nfrom a system of spheres where the Limit Assumption does not hold then\nthe two types of truth conditions come apart (conditionals of the form\na > b such that f(a,\nw) is empty will be vacuously true according to the semantics\nin terms of selection functions, but this need not happen when the\nsemantics is specified in terms if system of spheres). \n\nIt should be noted here that Lewis is still committed to a weak form\nof the Limit Assumption. To see that it is useful to see first that\nthe system VC can be axiomatized via the axioms\nID, MP, MOD, CSO, CV and\nCS with RCEC and RCK as rules of\ninference. The axiom of interest here is MOD which induces\nthe following constraint on selection functions: \n\nEven if a derived function f obeys (mod),\nthis does not guarantee that the system of spheres from which the\nfunction is derived obeys the Limit Assumption. For, of course, if\nf(b, w) ∩ |a|\n≠ ∅ then a should be\n entertainable;[7]\n but not vice-versa. Still, notice that (mod)\nrequires that f(a, w) ≠ ∅ when\na is weakly entartainable in the sense that\nf(b, w) ∩ |a| ≠\n∅. That much is required by the syntax of\nVC. I add below a set of usual constraints that will\nbe useful below: \n \nPollock has presented arguments against CV and therefore,\nalthough his semantics is still an example of a minimal change theory,\nhis notion of minimality is rather different from the one used by\nLewis. One of Pollock's counterexamples to CV involves two\nlight bulbs L and L′, three simple switches\nA, B and C, and a power source. The\ncomponents are wired together in such a way that bulb L is\nlit exactly when switch A is closed or both switches\nB and C are closed, while L′ is lit\nexactly when switch A is closed or switch B is\nclosed. At the initial moment both light bulbs are unlit and all\nswitches are open. Then we have: \n\nThe justification for the first conditional is that one way to bring\nabout that L′ is to bring about that A, but\nA > L is true; while the justification for the\nsecond is that one way of making both light bulbs lit is to close both\nB and C. Pollock goes then to claim that the\nfollowing counterfactual is also true: \n\nPollock's argument for (3) is that L′ requires only\nA or B, and to also make C the case is a\ngratuitous change and should therefore not be allowed. This view is\nnot uncontroversial. Cross and Nute (2001) argued against it as\nfollows: \n\nAnother problem is that the example appeals to the performance of\nactions that bring states of affairs about, and this language might\nnot be captured properly without an operator dealing with the\ncorrespondent interventions in the graph encoding the circuit. A more\nglobal reason for abandoning CV is the reluctance to work with a\ncomplete ordering of worlds of the type used by both Lewis and\nStalnaker. In fact, Pollock's analysis of the notion of similarity for\nworlds produces a partial rather than a complete ordering of\n worlds.[8]\n Pollock's system (called SS) is a proper extension\nof the system B of Burgess, obtained by adding to its\naxiomatic base the axioms MP and CS. \n\nAnother important system is the system VW of\nLewis. If truth conditions are presented via spheres semantics the\ncondition of Centering has to be weakened to: \n\nIf, on the contrary,  we utilize derived selection functions,\ncentering is expressed by: \n \nand weak centering by: \n \nSuch a condition can be rationalized in two possible ways. Either we\nutilize a ‘coarsened’ minimal interpretation where there\nis a ‘halo’ of worlds around the world i of\nreference that according to the coarsened notion of similarity are\ntied in similarity to i; or we change the interpretation of\nthe selection function by declaring that the selected worlds are\nworlds that are ‘sufficiently’ similar to the world of\nreference rather than the worlds that are most\n similar.[9]\n Under both interpretations we have a rationale for accepting the\nsystem VW. \n\nRobert Nozick (1981) presents independent arguments to reject\nCS in his celebrated essay on knowledge as ‘tracking\ntruth’. Most of his examples involve stochastic situations. For\nexample: a photon has been fired and went through slit B\n(there are two possible slits, A and B, it could\nhave gone through). This does not seem to provide reasons to assert\nthat ‘Had the photon been fired it would have gone through slit\nB’. Nozick's solution is to accept VW\nas the encoding of the logic of counterfactuals. \n\nDonald Nute (1980) has combined the criticism of Centering (and the\nconsequent adoption of Weak Centering) with a separate criticism of\nCV. He proposes a logic that we can call here\nN which is closed under all the rules and contains\nall the theses of VW except CV. Of course,\nthe logic SS of Pollock is a proper extension of\nN. \n \nInformally, we have considered so far two ways of understanding the\nselection functions used in the analysis of conditionals. Under one\npoint of view the evaluation of a > b at\ni requires checking whether the consequent b is true\nat the class of a-worlds  most similar to\ni. A second interpretation of the selection function\nf(w, |a|M) is to see\nit selecting the set of worlds that are sufficiently close to\ni.  We also saw that the system VW has a\nhybrid position in the hierarchy of conditional systems. The system is\nvalidated by a suitable set of constraints on selection functions, and\nthese constraints can be rationalized under either interpretation of\nthe selection function. \n \nThere is a third way of interpreting the content of a selection\nfunction f(w, |a|M),\nnamely as yielding a set of worlds that resemble w locally\nregarding very minimal respects but that otherwise could differ from\nw to any degree whatever. As a matter of fact, as long as the\nselected worlds resemble w locally as required they could\ndiffer maximally from the world of\n reference.[10] \n \nOne paradigmatic example of theories of this sort is the one offered\nin by Dov Gabbay (1972). A simplified Gabbay\n model[11]\n is a triple M =\n 〈W,\n g,\n P〉\n where the first and the third parameters are as in earlier models,\nand g is a ternary operator which assigns to sentences\na, b and a world i a subset\ng(a, b, i) of W. A\nconditional a > b is true at i in such a\nmodel just in case g(a, b, i)\n⊆ |a → b|M, where\n‘→’ is the material conditional. So, rather than\nfollowing a variant to the usual similarity pattern in the evaluation\nof ontic conditionals, Gabbay deploys a very different attitude\nregarding how to assess the truth conditions of such\nconditionals. Roughly, the idea is to preserve those features of the\nactual world that are relevant concerning the effect that a\nwould have on the truth of b. \n \nGabbay imposes some basic constraints on his ternary selection\nfunctions: \n \nWith these restrictions Gabbay's semantics determines the smallest\nconditional logic which is closed under RCEC, RCEA\nand the rule RCE that indicates that a >\nb should be inferred from a → b (see\nNute 1980 and Butcher 1978, 1983). We follow the terminology of Cross\nand Nute (2001) and call this logic G. This logic is\nrather weak but it is not the weakest considered in this article. The\nsmallest system we have considered so far is Chellas's system\nCE, which is the smallest conditional logic\ncontaining classical propositional logic and closed under\nRCEA and RCEC. \n \nOf course, it is possible to provide a neighborhood selection function\nsemantics for G. We just need to add the\ncondition: \n \nSo, G can be characterized in terms of the class of\nminimal models constrained by condition (rce). There\nis some debate as to how to strengthen G within the\ntype of local change semantics utilized by Gabbay. For example, we\nmight want to add the conditions CC and CM. One way\nof ensuring these conditions is to impose: \n \nBut, as Cross and Nute (2001) point out, this eliminates the most\ndistinctive feature of Gabbay's semantics. Butcher (1978) has indicated\nnevertheless that CC and CM can be ensured by adding\nweaker conditions than (G4). Of course, CC and CM\ncan be guaranteed parametrically and un-problematically by adding\nconstraints (cc) and (cm) to the\nclass of neighborhood models constrained by (rce). \n\nOther semantics of conditionals (especially those conditionals\nutilized in causal laws) which implement the local change view\npresented in this section can be found in D. Nute (1981) and\nJ.H. Fetzer and D. Nute (1978, 1980). \n\nThere are many types of conditionals for which there is no agreement\nas to their status as truth carriers. In some cases we have positive\narguments, like the one advanced by Alan Gibbard in (1981), that an\nentire (grammatical or logical) class of conditionals does not carry\ntruth values (indicative conditionals in the case of Gibbard). How to\nprovide semantics for these kind of conditionals? \n\nAs we saw at the beginning of this essay, one option is to develop a\nprobabilistic semantics. Why? Aside from the motivations one could\npossibly find in F.P. Ramsey's test for conditionals, the following\nquotation provides an historical idea of why philosophers found\nprobabilistic semantics attractive. The quotation is from one of the\nearly essays on probability and conditionals by R. Stalnaker\n(1970): \n \nErnest Adams (1975, 1965, 1966) provided the basis for this kind of\nevaluation of conditionals, and more recently there has been some work\nimproving this theory (McGee 1994, Stalnaker and Jeffrey 1994). It is\ninteresting to point out here at the outset that the most recent\nstudies about probability and conditionals, and even some of the\nearlier work by Adams, points in a direction that to some extent is\northogonal to the hopes manifested by Stalnaker. The main idea in\nStalnaker's passage and most of the work presented in Stalnaker 1970,\nas well as subsequent writings, is to utilize something less\ncontroversial than conditionals in order to decide some open issues in\nthe semantics of conditionals. When Stalnaker refers to a ‘well\nestablished mathematical theory’, apparently he is referring to\nKolmogorov's axiomatic treatment of probability linking the theory of\nprobability with measure theory. Stalnaker seems to presuppose that at\nleast this mathematical hard core of the theory of probability is\nfixed and that it can be used profitably in order to study the\nsemantics of conditionals. Nevertheless the recent work on\nprobabilistic semantics of conditionals seems to abandon this\nmathematical hard core of Kolmogorovian probability and focus instead\non pre-Kolmogorovian notions of probability, like the one studied by\nDe Finetti, where finitely additive conditional probability is\nprimitive and monadic probability is defined in terms of this\nprimitive. Adams himself talks in his writings about\nassertability rather than probability, leaving open not only\nthe interpretation of the notion itself but also its mathematical\ncore. \n \nEven when the original idea of studying conditionals by utilizing a\nmore mature theory of probability along Kolmogorovian lines is well\ndescribed in Stalnaker's passage, further developments ended up\npointing in a completely different and more controversial\ndirection. We will see that the notion of probability that seems to be\nadequate for developing a semantics of conditionals is more akin to\nthe notion of probability common in decision theory and employed both\nby Leonard Savage and Bruno de Finetti (De Finetti 1990) for that\npurpose: namely finitely additive (primitive) conditional probability\n(as axiomatized by Lester Dubins (1975)). \n \nAn important result by David Lewis (1976) showing that the probability\nof conditionals is not conditional probability, as well as extensions\nand improvements, is of special importance in this area. I shall first\nreview the basis of Lewis's argument and then I shall present the\nsemantic account developed initially by Adams and various extensions,\nimprovements and possibility results. I will conclude by offering an\nanalysis of conditional logics validated by probabilistic\nsemantics. \n \nI shall present here the main impossibility result that Lewis\ninitially presented in Lewis 1976. As is often done in this area we\nstart with a probability function defined over sentences. Throughout section four we will\nfollow the convention of using lower-case letters to denote sentences\nand upper-case letters to denote the propositions expressed by these\nsentences. So, ‘a’ denotes a well formed formula\nand ‘A’ denotes the set of points in an\nappropriate space where the sentence ‘a’ is\ntrue. The space and the model used will be made clear in each\nparticular case. This will simplify notation considerably. The\nfollowing axioms characterize the notion of probability function: \n \nLewis focuses next on a class of such probability functions that are\nclosed under conditioning. Whenever P(b) is\npositive, there is P′ such that\nP′(a) always equals\nP(a | b), and Lewis says that\nP′ comes from P by conditioning on b. A class\nof probability functions is closed under conditioning if and only if\nany probability function that comes by conditioning from one in the\nclass is itself in the class. \n\nNow we can introduce a couple of crucial definitions. A conditional\n> is a probability conditional for P (or a universal\nprobability conditional) if and only if > is interpreted in such a\nway that for some probability function P, and for any\nsentences a and c: \n \n‘CCCP’ stands for conditional construal of conditional\nprobability. The terminology is from Hájek and Hall\n1994. \n \nSuppose now, for reductio, that ‘>’ is a universal\nprobability conditional. Now notice that if ‘>’ is a\nuniversal probability conditional we would have: \n \nIf ‘>’ is a probability conditional for a class of\nprobability functions, and if the class is closed under conditioning,\nthen (5) holds for any probability function in the class, and for any\na and c. \n \nSelect now any function P such that P(a\n ∧\n c) and P(a \n ∧\n ¬c) both are positive. Then P(a),\nP(c) and P(¬c) also are\npositive. Now by (CCCP) we have that P(a >\nc) = P(c | a). And by (5) taking\nb as c or ¬c and simplifying the\nright-hand side: \n\nNow by probability theory we can, for any sentence d, expand\nby cases: \n \nWe can take here d as a > c and by\nobvious substitutions we then have: \n\nSo, we have reached the conclusion that a and c are\nprobabilistically independent under P if\nP(a\n ∧\n c) and P(a \n ∧\n ¬c) are both positive, something that is clearly\nabsurd. \n\nLewis himself refined his result (Lewis 1991), and then various\nextensions and refinements were published in a Festschrift\nfor Ernest Adams (Eells and Skyrms 1994), for example by Hájek\nand Hall (1994). \n \nAlan Hájek (1994) considers possible restrictions of the (CCCP)\nand proves generalized forms of Lewis's triviality for them. In\nparticular Hájek considers: \n \nHájek considers then operations on probability functions that\nhe calls perturbations. These operations encompass other\ninteresting operations, including conditioning and Jeffrey\nconditioning, among others. Suppose that we have some function\nP, and a and c, such that: \n \nNow suppose that another function P′ assigns a\ndifferent probability to the conditional: \n \nThen if P′ assigns the same conditional probability as\nP does: \n we have immediately that: \n \nBy the same token, if P and P′ agree on the\nprobability of the conditional but disagree on the conditional\nprobability, then they cannot possibly equate the two. Not at least\nfor this choice of a and c. Hájek argues that\nit is easy to find such pairs of probability functions. \n\nIn fact, Hájek proves a result showing that if\nP′ is a perturbation of P relative to a given\n‘>’ then at most one of P and\nP′ is a CCCP-function for ‘>’ (see\nHájek 1994). \n\nNevertheless, van Fraassen (1976) showed that Restricted CCCP can hold\nfor some suitable pairs of antecedent and consequent\npropositions a and c. Ernest Adams and Vann McGee\nconsider the following particular strong syntactic restriction of CCCP\n(see McGee 1994, p. 189)[12]: \n\nwhere both a and c are factual or\nconditional-free sentences \n \nIf one sees the conditional (as the Stoics did) as a notion of\nconsequence in disguise and one does not think that conditionals have\ntruth values, or that the interpretation of conditionals is fixed\nacross a set of believers in an objective manner, the Original Adams\nHypothesis makes a great deal of sense. This is so, at least, with the\npossible exception of the limit case P(a) = 0, as I\nshall argue below. \n\nDavid Lewis thinks differently in many regards. First he considers\niterations of conditionals adequate and he is looking for a fixed\ninterpretation of the conditional across different believers: \n\nLewis's conviction that the interpretation of a conditional is\nindependent of the beliefs of its utterer is not very well supported\nby his argument. One can immediately see this by noticing that there\nmight be some ‘hidden indexicality’ in conditionals and\ntheir semantics. Van Fraassen's argument has usually been interpreted\nas offering a probabilistic semantics for conditionals seen as\nindexical expressions grounded on the beliefs of the utterer. The more\nwe enter into the epistemic view of conditionals the more the\ninterpretation of conditionals will be grounded on current beliefs\n(not necessarily by appealing to hidden\n indexicality).[13] \n \nFor our purposes here the Original Adams Hypothesis will be a good\npoint of departure. We will see in the following sections that the\noriginal thesis has troubles of its own quite independently of the\nproblems raised by Lewis's impossibility results and its sequels. \n \nTo appreciate some of the problems related to the Original Adams\nHypothesis (OAH) we should first distinguish between two probabilistic\ncriteria for validity considered by McGee (1994): \n \nThere is, in addition, an alternative criterion for validity, which is\nperhaps even more intuitive: \n \nVan McGee nicely analyzes how the OAH fares when used in combination\nwith these criteria for validity. The basic problem is that one has a\nparsimonious theory of the English conditional when the notion of\nprobabilistic validity is used: transitivity, contraposition and other\ninference rules fail, for example. But: \n\nThe alternative is, according to McGee, ready at hand. The idea is to\nfocus on a primitive notion of conditional probability that has been\naround from quite some time and that has various historical\norigins. McGee focuses on one of these origins, namely the notion of\nconditional probability as axiomatized by Karl Popper (1959,\nappendix). A Popper function on a language L for the\nclassical sentential calculus is a function P:\nL×L → R, where R\ndenotes the real numbers, which obeys the following axioms:. \n\nAxiom (5) is crucial and older than its use in Popper's theory. It\ngoes back at least to Jeffreys's work where it is in turn presented as\nW. E. Johnson's product rule (see Jeffreys 1961, p. 25). Contemporary\nthe product rule has been called also the multiplication\naxiom.  \n\nNow, with the help of this notion of conditional probability, we can\ndefine a new form of Adams's hypothesis: \n \nNow in terms of this newly formulated hypothesis McGee shows (see\nMcGee 1994, Theorem 3) that probabilistic validity and strict validity\ncoincide, as they should. This is just one symptom that the right\nformulation of Adams's hypothesis requires embracing not the classical\nnotion of conditional probability characterized by Kolmogorov's\naxioms, but a different notion of conditional probabilities\naxiomatized by W. E. Johnson's product rule (simply product\nrule from now on) and other suitable\n axioms.[14] \n \nThere are at least two dominant traditions in the theory of\nconditional probability which are able to deal with conditioning\nevents of measure zero. One is represented by Dubins' principle of\nConditional Coherence (Dubins 1975): For all pairs of events\nA and B  such that\nA ∩ B  ≠ ∅: \n \nWhen P(A ∩ B) > 0, Conditional\nCoherence captures some aspects of De Finetti's idea of conditional\nprobability given an event, rather than given a\n σ-field.[15] \n \nThe well-known Kolmogovorian alternative to the former view operates\nas follows. Let\n 〈Ω,\n B,\n P〉\n be a measure space where Ω is a set of points and\n B\n a σ-field of sets of subsets of Ω, with points\nw (this set  B is closed under complementation and countable union of its members). Then when P(A) > 0, A ∈\n B,\nthe conditional probability over\n B\n given A is defined by: P(. | A) =\nP(. ∩ A)/P(A). Of course, this\ndoes not provide guidance when P(A) = 0. For that\nthe received view implements the following strategy. Let\n A\nbe a sub-σ-field of\n B.\n Then\n P(. | A)\n is a regular conditional distribution (rcd) of\n B\n given\n A\n provided that: \n \nKolmogorov illustrates, with a version of the so-called ‘Borel\nparadox’, that\n P(. | A)\n is probability not given an event, but given a\nσ-field. Blackwell and Dubins discuss conditions of\npropriety for rcds (Dubins 1975).  A rcd\n P(. | A)(w)\n on\n B\n given\n A,\n is proper at w, if\n P(. | A)(w)\n = 1, whenever w ∈ A ∈\n A.\n P(. | A)(w)\n is improper otherwise. Recent research has shown that when\n B\n is countably generated, almost surely with respect to P, the\nrcds on\n B\n given\n A\n are maximally improper (Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane 2006). This\nis so in two senses. On the one hand the set of points where propriety\nfails has measure 1 under P.  On the other hand we have that\n P(a(w)|A)(w)\n = 0, when propriety requires that\n P(a(w)|A)(w)\n = 1. \n \nIt seems that failures of propriety conspire against any reasonable\nepistemological understanding of probability of the type commonly used\nin various branches of mathematical economics, philosophy and computer\nscience. To be sure, finitely additive probability obeying Conditional\nCoherence is not free from foundational\n problems,[16]\n but, by clause 2 of Conditional Coherence, each coherent finitely\nadditive probability is proper. In addition, Dubins (1975) shows that\neach unconditional finitely additive probability carries a full set of\ncoherent conditional probabilities. \n \nIn this section I shall only consider probabilities respecting\npropriety.  So, I shall start with Conditional Coherence and I shall\nadd the axiom of Countable\n Additivity[17]\n only to restricted applications where the domain Ω, when\ninfinite, is countable. Then I shall define qualitative belief from\nconditional probability by appealing to a procedure studied by van\nFraassen (1976), Arló-Costa (2001), and Arló-Costa and\nParikh (2005). Notice that the axiomatization offered by Popper\nand used by McGee also deals with finitely additive probability. The\ndistinction between finitely additive probability and countably\nadditive probability is important for languages that are expressive\nenough to register the difference. We will make this point explicit\nbelow by introducing languages with an infinite but countable number\nof atomic propositions. \n \nMcGee (1994, p. 190) presents Popper axioms as a ‘[n]atural\ngeneralization of the ordinary notion of conditional probability in\nterms of which the singularities that otherwise arise at the edge of\ncertainty no longer appear’. When McGee alludes to the\n‘ordinary notion of conditional probably’ he probably\nrefers to the usual ratio definition of conditional probability. And\nthe definition he seems to have in mind is one that takes as basic a\nnotion of monadic probability that in itself is finitely additive. But\nthis is not the ordinary notion of conditional probability deriving\nfrom the work of Kolmogorov. This notion takes as basic a notion of\nmonadic probability for which countable additivity is a crucial axiom\n(countable additivity requires that the sum of the probabilities\nP(Xi) of a countable family of events\nXi with union X equals P(X)). As long as the\ndomain over which the probability is defined is infinite (and other\nparts of McGee's article—dealing with infinitesimal\nprobability—seems to indicate that he is interested in infinite\ndomains) the finitely additive notion of conditional probability that\nMcGee offers is not an extension of the classical Kolmogorovian view,\nbut an extension of finitely additive monadic probability. The\nresulting notion of finitely additive conditional probability is the\npre-Kolmogorovian notion of conditional probability axiomatized by\nDubins. \n\nOur first axiom will add a resource in order to keep track on\ninconsistency as well as an intuitive constraint on conditional\nprobability (compatible with Conditional Coherence): \n\nThe probability (simpliciter) of A,\npr(A), is P(A | U). The\nreader can see that axiom (II) corresponds to the product rule\n(multiplication axiom) used before. Since here we are dealing with\nevents, the axioms are simpler than in\nthe previous presentation following Popper's axioms (which assign\nprobabilities to sentences rather than events). \n\nIf P(X | A) is a probability measure as a\nfunction of X, then A is normal, and\notherwise A is abnormal. Conditioning with abnormal\nevents puts the agent in a state of incoherence represented by the\nfunction with constant value 1. Thus A is normal iff\nP(∅|A) = 0. Van Fraassen (1976) shows that\nsupersets of normal sets are normal and that subsets of abnormal sets\nare abnormal. Assuming that the whole space is normal, abnormal sets\nhave measure 0, though the converse need not hold. In the\nfollowing we shall confine ourselves to the case where the whole space\nU is normal. \n\nWe can now introduce the notion of probability core.  A\ncore as a set K which is normal and satisfies the\nstrong superiority condition (SSC)—i.e., if A\nis a nonempty subset of K and B is disjoint from\nK, then P(B | A ∪ B) =\n0 (and so P(A | A ∪ B) =\n1). Thus any non-empty subset of K is more\n‘believable’ than any set disjoint from K. It can\nthen be established that all non-empty subsets of a core are normal. \n \nWhen the universe of points is at most countable, very nice properties\nof cores and conditional measures hold, which can be used to define\nfull belief and expectation in a paradox-free manner. \n\nIn general it can be shown that for each function P there is\na smallest as well as a largest core and that the smallest core has\nmeasure 1.  In addition, when the universe is countable we can add\nCountable Additivity without risking failures of propriety. In this\ncase we have that the smallest core is constituted exactly by the\npoints carrying positive probability. All cores carry probability one,\nbut, of course, only the innermost core lacks subsets of zero measure.\nThere is, in addition, a striking difference between the largest and\nthe smallest core (and between the largest and any other core).  In\nfact, any set S containing the largest core is robust with\nrespect to suppositions in the sense that\nP(S | X) = 1 for all X and the\ncomplement of S is abnormal. So the largest core encodes a\nstrong doxastic notion of certainty or full belief, while the\nsmallest encodes a weaker notion of ‘almost certainty’ or\n expectation.[19]\n So, when the universe is countable and countable additivity is\nimposed, we can define two main attitudes as follows: An event is\nexpected if it contains the smallest core, whereas it is\nfully believed if it contains the largest. \n\nIn the general case there is still enough structure to define both\nattitudes. In fact, in this case the existence of the innermost core\ncannot be guaranteed. But the definition of full belief needs no\nmodification and the notion of expectation can be characterized as\nfollows: An event is expected if it is entailed by some\ncore. \n \nThe notion of countable core logic derived from the\nprobabilistic semantics presented in the previous section has\nimportant connections with the preferential and rational logics\nintroduced in Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (1990). These logics\ncharacterize a notion of nonmonotonic consequence rather than a\nconditional, but we will see below that there are interesting and\nimportant connections between non-nested conditional logics and\npreferential logics.  \n \nThe definitions introduced above allow for a modification of the\nclassical notions of entailment and truth that resemble some of the\nsemantic ideas already explored in section 3.  The following\ndefinition shows how this task can be done: \n\nPreferential models were used by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (1990) to\ndefine a family of preferential logics. Lehmann and Magidor (1988)\nfocused on a subfamily of preferential models—the so-called\nranked models. \n \nThe effect of the function r is to rank the states, i.e. a\nstate of smaller rank is more normal than a state of higher rank.  The\nintuitive idea is that for r(s) =\nr(t) the sates s and t are at the\nsame level in the underlying ordering. In order to increase intuition\nabout ranking it is useful to notice that, if < is a partial order\non the set T, the ranking condition presented above is\nequivalent to the following property: \n\nLehmann and Magidor also introduce ranked models where the ordering of\nthe states does not need to obey the smoothness requirement. \n \nFrom the syntactical point of view, Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor proved\na representation theorem for the following system\n P\n in terms of the above preferential models. \n\nLLE stands for ‘left logical equivalence’,\nRW for ‘right weakening’ and CM for\n‘cautious monotony’. Lehmann and Magidor prove that the\nsystem\nR,\n complete with respect to ranked models, can be obtained by\nadding the following rule of rational monotony to the above set of\nrules. \n\nNaturally, if RM is added then CM is no longer\nnecessary. Lehmann and Magidor (1988) suggest that the syntactic\nsystem\n RR  \n obtained from\n R\n by dropping the rule CM is sound and complete with respect\nto rough ranked models. They obtain this conjecture from the work of\nJames Delgrande in conditional logic. \n\nThere is an obvious resemblance between the rules presented in this\nsection and conditional axioms and rules previously presented. For\nexample, R would correspond to the axiom ID,\nRM to the axiom CV and so on. This raises the\nquestion as to what is the logical connection between the rational and\npreferential logics and suitable non-nested fragments of conditional\nsystems we have already considered. This issue is addressed in section\n4.6. \n \nS = \n 〈U,\n F〉\n is a probabilistic space, with U countable and where\nF is a Boolean sub-algebra of the power set of\nU. The assumption about the size of U cannot be\ndispensed with; it will be maintained throughout the section, which is\nbased on\n Arló-Costa and Parikh 2005. \n \nWe use the letters A, B, etc. to refer to events in\nF. \n\nLet the ordering < on U be defined for all (distinct)\npairs of points p, q, such that {p,\nq} is normal by: p < q if and only if\nP({p}|{p, q}) = 1; i.e., if\nwe know that we have picked one of p, q then\nit must be p.  Similarly, let p\n ≅\n q if and only if 0 <\nP({p}|{p, q}) < 1.  From\nnow on we will call the ordering < induced by a probabilistic model\nM the ranking ordering for M. Notice that\nas a corollary of the Lemma of Descending Chains stated above: \n\nNow we can define: a\n < Mb iff for every u ∈ U such that\nu is minimal in A, according to the ranking ordering\nfor M, u ∈ B. It is important to\nnotice that there is an alternative probabilistic definition of\n .\n Such a definition requires that a\n PMb iff P(B | A) = 1.  These two ways\nof defining a supraclassical consequence relation are intimately\nrelated, but we will verify below that they do not coincide in all\ncases. \n\nFrom now on it will be important to make precise distinctions about\nthe nature of the underlying language L used to define\nnon-monotonic relations.  If the set of primitive propositional\nvariables used in the definition of L is finite, we will call\nthe language logically finite.  Now, with the proviso that\nL is logically finite the following result can be stated. \n \nWhen L is countable, the situation is a little more involved.\nIn this case\n R\n is no longer complete with respect to CA probabilistic models.  The\nfollowing lemma (based on the technique used in Lemma 1 of Lehmann and\nMagidor 1988) illustrates this point. \n\nThis lemma is quite important for our purposes. It shows that even if\nwe restrict ourselves to infinite but countable probabilistic domains,\nif the language is expressive enough, CA cannot be added as a\nconstraint on probabilistic models on pain of being unable to\ncharacterize the rational relation we are interested in. In view of\nthe intimate connection between conditional logics and non-monotonic\nconsequence relations, this means that the notion of probability that\nwe are interested in is certainly not the one deriving from the work\nof Kolmogorov, but a pre-Kolmogorovian one that is finitely\nadditive. \n \nA natural suggestion deriving from the last result is to investigate\nprobabilistic models where CA is not necessarily required.  We will\ncall such models finitely additive (FA). \n \nIt is not difficult to see that a\n PMb is also sound with respect to a\n Rb. Nevertheless, a\n < Mb fails to be sound with respect to a\n Rb. All the following results assume that the underlying\nlanguage is countable. \n\nNevertheless, soundness does hold with respect to the system\n RR\nintroduced in Lehmann and Magidor (1988). \n\nNow, it is clear that the relation\n PM,\n satisfied in all FA probabilistic models, is identical to the\nrelation\n < M\n induced by the sub-class of smooth and FA probabilistic models. In\nother words, when the language is infinite (but countable),\n R\n can be characterized either in terms of the relation\n PM\n induced by FA models or in terms of the relation\n < M\n induced by the class of FA models which are\n smooth.[21] \n \nIn the diagram below we present a hierarchy of conditional\nsystems. The diagram is intended to be interpreted as follows:\nWhenever one system is connected to another by a path of upward lines,\nthe higher one is an extension of the other.  The basic systems are\nV, NP and B. The\npath from B to V symbolizes the\naddition of negative transitivity as a constraint on the ordering\nrelation (see section 3..1.1 above).  The path from\nNP to V is effected by the addition\nof (L).  The system B′\nincluded in the diagram is no immediate interest but has been included\nfor the sake of symmetry.  The (T),\n(TU) and (TA) extensions of\nV, NP and B are\nalso represented (where ‘A’ stands for\nAbsoluteness—see section 3.2.1—‘U’ for\nUniformity and ‘T’ for Total Reflexivity—see section\n3.1.1). \n \nThe picture presents a hierarchy of conditional systems of increasing\nlogical strength where the weakest are at the bottom. In\nArló-Costa and Shapiro (1992) it is shown that the theses of\nthe rational system\n R\n can be mapped to the generalized Horn\nfragment of the system\n V[22]\n and that this fragment is preserved across the depicted systems of\ngreater logical strength up to at least VTA. If we\neliminate (L) we have a similar connection with the\ngeneralized Horn pattern corresponding to the extensions of\nNP. \n \nTherefore, via these mappings and the results presented in the\nprevious section, we have probabilistic models for the generalized\nHorn fragments of the logics V of Lewis,\nNP of Delgrande and B of\nBurgess. Things are more complicated if we allow for iteration, an\nissue that we will address in the next section. \n \nThe probabilistic view presented above can be summarized as follows\n(where the expression ‘simple conditionals’ denotes\nun-nested conditionals and where we follow the\nconvention of using lower-case letters to denote sentences and\nupper-case letters to denote the propositions expressed by these\nsentences.): \n\nThis is a qualitative test where acceptance is an ‘all or\nnothing’ notion. This model avoids attributing probability to\nconditionals at all. It can be rephrased in terms of attributing\nprobability 1 to un-nested conditionals. We saw that this type of\nmodel can characterize probabilistically the inference patterns of\nwell known non-monotonic logics and the generalized Horn patterns of\ninference of the corresponding conditional logics. \n\nWe also saw that the notion of conditional probability used in these\nmodels cannot be the one deriving from the foundational work of\nKolmogorov. We need instead a primitive notion of finitely additive\nconditional probability. \n\nBut these models are quite limited logically. They cannot characterize\nBoolean combinations of conditionals and they cannot characterize\nelemental forms of iteration permitted by rather weak systems like the\nsystem V of Lewis or the system B of\nBurgess. Can we do better? This section presents some work in this\narea. \n \nIn a much cited article, Van McGee (1985) considers the problem of\niterated conditionals. McGee gives arguments in favor of the so-called\nExport-Import axiom: \n \nNevertheless, the argument in defense of (EI), a condition that fails\nto be validated by any of the conditional logics we have seen so far,\ndoes not appeal to probabilistic models. \n\nArló-Costa (2001) presents a probabilistic model that validates\nthe (EI) axiom. The model uses some of the notions introduced in\nprevious sections, like the notion of probabilistic cores of a\nconditional probability function. The underlying probability space has\ndomain U and an associated sigma field of propositions\nF. \n\nLet LC be the smallest language extending the underlying\nBoolean language L such that if α ∈ L and\nβ ∈ LC, then α > β ∈ LC\nand ¬β ∈ LC. We use the notation T\n> to denote the theories over LC. The model uses a\nprobabilistic support function, Sup, from the set of\nconditional probability functions defined over the probability space\nto T >. So, each probability function P(. | .) is\nassociated to a support set indicating the set of conditional\nsentences supported by P(. | .) or accepted with\nrespect to P(. | .). Now we have enough elements to define this\nnotion of probabilistic support: \n\nIf a proposition A cuts\nthe system of cores of a function P(. | .) then the system of\ncores of P[A](. | .) can be obtained from the system\nof cores of P(. | .) by intersecting each of these cores with\nA and taking these intersections as the system of cores for\nP[A](. | .).  The resulting notion of hypothetical\nrevision sanctions axioms validating (EI). \n\nPeter Gärdenfors (1978, 1988) proposed the following form of the\nRamsey test (conceptually introduced in the introduction to this\narticle): \n\nThis formulation of the test presupposes that the underlying language\nin question is a language containing conditionals (iterated or\nnot). We will call this language L>. The basic\nBoolean underlying language will be called L0. We\nwill consider below intermediate conditional languages containing\nconditional fragments of L>. \n\nWe will consider immediately two basic postulates for belief revision\nthat deal with consistency constraints. The first establishes that the\nconsequence of revising any theory with a consistent sentence leads to\na consistent output. This includes of course the inconsistent theory\nthat we will denote as K⊥. \n \nThe second postulate is considerably less intuitive. It says that the\nresult of revising the inconsistent theory is always unsuccessful,\nleaving the inconsistent theory unmodified. For the moment the\npostulate will have only a formal interest. Later on, when we consider\nthe theory called UPDATE, the postulate will have an intuitive\ninterpretation (although not an epistemic interpretation). \n\nConsistency is a usual constraint on theories of belief revision, like\nAGM (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson 1985). Our first\nresult shows that Gärdenfors's Ramsey test conflicts with the\nsuccess postulate: \n\nThe relevance of this theorem, which at first sight might be seen too\ndependent on limit cases, will be more evident below. We will turn\nfirst to another incompatibility result, originally proved by Peter\nGärdenfors (1988). \n\nTo appreciate the interest of the result it might be useful to remind\nthe reader that the main interest of Gärdenfors in his book and\narticles on conditionals was to utilize his test of acceptance as a\nsemantic bridge connecting logical properties of conditionals with\nbasic properties of revision as axiomatized by the Alchourrón,\nGärdenfors, and Makinson (1985). Some such properties are: \n\nK+a, the expansion of K with a, is\nobtained by taking the logical consequences of the set theoretic union\nof K and {a}. We can now introduce an important\nnotion, that of a belief revision model (BRM). A BRM is a\npair\n 〈K,\n *〉,\n where K is a set of belief sets constructed over\nL> and * is a belief revision function. We\nassume that every K ∈ K satisfies\n(GRT). We also assume that K is closed under\nexpansions and revisions. \n \nA BRM\n  〈K,\n *〉\n is non-trivial if and only if there is K ∈\nK and there are three sentences that are pairwise\ninconsistent and such that none of the negations of these sentences is\nin K. With these elements we can state the result originally\npresented by Gärdenfors, namely: \n\nGärdenfors (1988) presented the impossibility result just proved\nas a conflict between the Preservation postulate and his version of\nthe Ramsey test. The version of the impossibility just proved requires\nnevertheless many other assumptions, from closure under expansions and\nrevisions to consistency. There are stronger versions of the\nimpossibility result that use weaker assumptions (see Cross and Nute\n2001 for an excellent presentation of the proofs of alternative forms\nof the impossibility theorem). There is one form of the impossibility\nresult that goes to the root of the opposition between preservation\nand (GRT). \n\nConsider first the following constraint on revisions. \n\nThe basic idea is that when the agent is in suspense about a sentence\na, revisions go by expansions. Open Preservation is a\ncondition flowing from Ramsey's own views about conditionals. The idea\nis that an agent who is in suspense about a sentence a\naccepts ‘If a, then b’ with respect to\nhis epistemic state K iff B belongs to the belief\nstate obtained after adding a to K. If this is a\nminimal condition of adequacy for an acceptance test, then (GRT) does\nnot meet this adequacy condition. First we need to state appropriate\nnon-triviality conditions. The following definition provides the sense\nof non-triviality that we need for Theorem 5 below. The notion of\nnon-triviality that we use in this result should not be confused with\nthe different notion of non-triviality used in Theorem 4 above. \n\nCondition (b1) does not need much justification. Condition (b2) is\nalso very mild. In fact, the formula (¬a\n ∧\n b) → (a > ¬b) is not a\ntheorem of any of the well-known systems of conditional logic\n(epistemic or\n not).[24] \n \nWe remind the reader that the previous results utilizes BRMs and\ntherefore assumes closure under expansions, i.e. if K ∈\nK for a fixed BRM with universe K,\nthen any expansion of K is also an admissible belief set in\nthe BRM.  Many (for example Rott 1989, Hansson 1992, Morreau 1992 and\nMakinson 1990) see the postulate of closure under expansions as\nunjustified. The intuitive reason is that a belief set including\nconditionals behaves in a very different manner from a belief set\ncomposed uniquely of ‘indicative’ sentences belonging to\nthe purely Boolean language. So, especially when the interpretation of\nthe conditional sentences is auto-epistemic and therefore tacitly\ndependent on the theory of reference, we have that the addition of an\nindicative sentence that is compatible with all previously supported\nindicative sentences typically withdraws the support of conditional\nsentences supported by the current theory (and that therefore are\nmembers of the current theory). Thus expansions cease to be\nunproblematic additions. They also lead to withdrawals in the\nconditional part of the current theory. \n \nOur last theorem also suggests that, as long as closure under\nexpansions is preserved, (GRT) is compatible with non-Bayesian notions\nof revision where Open Preservation is violated—i.e. (GRT) is\ncompatible with notions of change where the revision of an open\nepistemic state K with respect to a sentence a (and\nits negation) does not result in an expansion K + a,\nbut in a different change weaker than an expansion (where some\ninformation contained in K + a is withdrawn). So,\nthere are two basic solutions to Gärdenfors's impossibility\nresult as long as one insists on using BRMs to develop a semantics of\nconditionals. One solution consists in modifying the BRMs and\nrestricting closure under expansions, while keeping preservation and\nother standard revision postulates. Another solution consists in\nkeeping closure under expansions while weakening the preservation\npostulate that asserts that if a belief set K ∈\nK is open with respect to a sentence a then\nthe revision goes by expansion. \n\nA third possible solution consists in giving up (GRT) and therefore in\nceasing to use an unmodified form of Gärdenfors's BRMs. One\nconcrete option here is the adoption of Levi's version of the Ramsey\ntest which permits separating beliefs sets from the conditionals they\nsupport. The idea in this third option is that the principles of\nbelief revision apply only to beliefs sets that are\nconditional-free. We will consider this third option below. We will\nsay something first about the two first\n alternatives.[25] \n\nThe original semantic program that motivated Gärdenfors consisted\nin utilizing (GRT) as a bridge that outputs formal constraints on\nconditionals when we input basic constraints on revision. But we have\nalready seen that (GRT) is incompatible with Consistency and with Open\nPreservation, both very basic constraints  on revision. \n\nNevertheless one can use the test in a different way. Rather than\nfixing the notion of revision and looking for constraints on\nconditionals, one can fix a conditional system, say the system\nVC of Lewis, and determine which is the notion of\nrevision that is needed to validate epistemically all and only the\naxioms of these system via the use of (GRT). We know that the\nresulting notion of change will not have some of the central features\nof the standard notion of revision. It will be a different notion,\nwith a different motivation. Arló-Costa and Levi (1996) show\nthat the needed notion of change is the notion of update\nproposed by the computer scientists H. Katsuno and A. Mendelzon\n (1991).[26] \n\nThe first six postulates are enough to validate Lewis's logic\nVC. Notice that the role played by the postulate (U2)\nis rather different from the role played by the Preservation or Open\nPreservation postulates in the AGM theory and other standard versions\nof belief revision. When K = K⊥ we\nhave an instance of the un-success postulate (US) considered above:\nK*a = K⊥. Monotony (if\nK ⊆ H, then K*a ⊆\nH*a) is also a theorem of this notion of\n update.[27]\n So, the two properties derivable from (GRT), monotony and un-success\nare properties of the notion of change needed to validate all the\naxioms of the system VC. \n\nUpdate has important connections with a notion of change offered by\nDavid Lewis (1976) to make sense of the thesis that the probability of\nconditionals goes by some notion of conditional probability. The\nproblem considered by Lewis is very similar than the one we are\nconsidering here. Lewis shows that the probability of conditionals is\nnot standard conditional probability. But there is a notion of\nprobability change, quite different both from Kolmogorov's notion of\nconditional probability and from De Finetti's notion as well, baptized\nas imaging by Lewis. And in terms of this notion we can say\nthat the probability of conditionals coincides with the corresponding\ndeviant notion of conditional probability. By the same token we can\nsay that belief in conditionals can be represented in terms of a\ndeviant notion of conditional belief, given by Update. The connections\nbetween update and imaging went unnoticed for a while until the work\nof philosophers became known by computer scientists working with\nupdate models. \n\nA question does remain open nevertheless. Is there an acceptance test\nmeeting the adequacy conditions we proposed above such that we can\ncarry out Gärdenfors's semantic program with its help? The answer\nis yes. The test in question was presented in the introduction to this\narticle: it is essentially a variant of the test first proposed by\nLevi (1988). This test circumvents the known impossibility results and\nit therefore makes possible focusing on a well motivated notion of\nsupposition and its corresponding conditional axioms, as\nGärdenfors wanted. \n\nIn this section we will study two epistemic systems first proposed in\nArló-Costa (1995).\n\nLet L> be the smallest language such that: (1)\nL0 ⊆ L>, (2) if\na, b ∈ L>, then\na > b ∈ L> and (3)\nL> is closed under the Boolean\nconnectives. This language is too strong for our purposes. We prefer\nto deal first with non-nested versions of the conditional language,\nwhich we shall extend later on. Therefore we will use the language\nFL>. Let\nFL> be the smallest language such\nthat: (1) L0 ⊆\nFL>, (2) if a, b\n∈ L0, then a > b ∈\nFL>, and (3)\nFL> is closed under the Boolean\nconnectives. Let an f-instance (flat-instance) of a conditional\nformula of FL> be a substitution\ninstance of the formula where formulas of L0 are\nsubstituted for the variable-schemes that occur in the formula. We\nwill call, in addition, ‘flat’ every conditional formula\nthat belongs to FL>. \n\nWe can now consider the following syntactic system: \n \nNow, consider the following flat-version of the rule of inference\nRCM (denoted RCMf) : \n\n CM\n can be now defined as the smallest set of formulas in the language\nFL> which is closed under\nRCMf and M and which contains all f-instances of the\naxioms I and CC and all classical tautologies and\ntheir substitution instances in the language\nFL>. \n\nStronger conditional systems can be obtained by adding appropriate\nconstraints on the notion of belief revision (or supposition) used in\nthe epistemic models. A salient system is\n EF,\n which can be obtained from\n CM\n by adding non-nested instances of ID, MP,\nCA, CV and CD: ¬(a >\n⊥) for all non-tautologous a, to the axiomatic base of\n CM;\n and the rule of inference RCEAf (as RCMf, this is an instance of RCEA where all the sentences that appear in the rule belong to L0) to the rules of inference of\n CM.\n  \n \nThe notion of supposition that is needed to validate\n EF\n utilizes some of the basic postulates of AGM revision: Success,\nExpansion, Equivalence and a weakened version of consistency that\nrequires the consistency of K*a when both the input\na and the theory of reference K are consistent. It\nalso utilizes the following two postulates of AGM: \n \nNotice that the postulate of Preservation does not correspond to the\npositive validity of any non-nested conditional formula. The model is\nnevertheless compatible with Preservation and its addition to the\nmodel has an impact on the positive validity of nested conditionals\nformulas (see Theorem 8.1 and Observation 8.3 of Arló-Costa\n1995 as well as the discussion in section 2.7 of Cross and Nute\n2001). \n\nFirst let's consider the following ‘negative’ version of\nepistemic validity. \n\nArló-Costa and Levi (1996) show that negative and positive\nvalidity do not coincide. For consider the following constraint on\nbelief revision models: \n\nNotice that now we can show: \n\nShould every rational agent whose commitments for change are\nconstrained at least by the basic postulates of AGM accept every\nnon-iterated instance of ((a\n ∧\n b) → (a > b))? The answer is\nno. For consider some rational agent who is in suspense about\na and suppose for the sake of contradiction that the agent\naccepts all non-iterated instances of ((a\n ∧\n b) → (a > b)).  Then if K\nrepresents current beliefs, we know that a ∉ K\nand ¬a ∉ K. Moreover, since we also\nassumed that commitments for change obey at least the basic postulates\nof AGM, then a ∉\n K*⊤\n and ¬a ∉\n K*⊤.\n Therefore, by (LNRT), ¬\n (⊤\n > a) ∈ s(K). Since all\nnon-iterated instances of ((a\n ∧\n b) → (a > b)) belong to\ns(K), a →\n (⊤\n > a) ∈ s(K). Therefore\n¬a ∈ K, against our initial hypothesis. The\nconclusion is that it is not true that all non-iterated instances of\n((a\n ∧\n b) → (a > b)) are positively\nvalid. Notice, nevertheless, that if an agent accepts the conjunction\n(a\n ∧\n b) (where a, b ∈\nL0), he must accept (a > b)\ntoo. \n\nArló-Costa and Levi (1996) give an argument in favor of using\npositive rather than negative validity. The main point is that there\nare epistemic models (admitting a Ramsey test for negated\nconditionals) where the inference rule modus ponens does not\npreserve negative validity. \n \nIn Gärdenfors's BRMs, which are incompatible with\n‘negative’ versions of the Ramsey test, negative and\npositive validity coincide and Lewis's system VC can\nbe modeled epistemically by appealing to update. \n\nUnder an epistemological point of view the revision function used in\nthe models considered so far intends to capture a notion of\nsupposition appropriate for epistemic conditionals. So, one can ask\nhere a normative question: which are the basic axiomatic constraints\ncorresponding to this notion of supposition? \n\nWe already saw that the notion of supposition used in\nGärdenfors's epistemic models of Lewis's system\nVC do not coincide with AGM. There is, as we argued\nabove, a tension between the axiom of Preservation and\nGärdenfors's version of the Ramsey test.  The appropriate axioms\ncoincide with Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of update, which\nis axiomatically and conceptually a notion of change very different\nfrom AGM. One could say that these axioms represent the notion of\nsupposition involved in evaluating conditionals which\npre-systematically are considered truth-bearers. \n\nThe epistemic models deploying support functions that we just\npresented above are compatible with the basic axioms of AGM. It is not\nclear, nevertheless, that these axioms are the ones one would want as\nbasic constraints on supposing. Isaac Levi (1996) has offered positive\narguments in favor of having a notion of epistemic supposition that\ndoes not coincide with AGM. We will review these arguments in this\nsection. \n\nLevi's arguments start with the proposal of a mechanism for supposing\nthat intends to extend central insights already present in Ramsey's\nfootnote. Notice that Ramsey considered supposition in the two cases\nin which it seems to have epistemological significance, namely when\nthe agent who evaluates a conditional is in suspense with respect to\nthe antecedent of the conditional, and when the agent is in a\ncounter-doxastic position, i.e. when he believes the negation of the\nantecedent. \n \nIn the first case it seems that Ramsey adopts the condition we called\nOpen Preservation: \n\nThe second case is more complex: it involves engaging in a genuine\nrevision rather than an expansion. There is nevertheless a limit case\nthat is not considered by Ramsey: how should we understand the act of\nsupposing a when the agent already believes a? \n\nOne option here is to treat this as a degenerate limit case and say\nthat in this case the agent does not need to modify the current\nepistemic state. Katsuno and Mendelzon's operation of update\nimplements this policy, while it abandons Open Preservation. \n\nThere is nevertheless a second form of understanding how to suppose\nthat a is the case when a is already believed. The\nidea here is to feign doubt as to the truth of a by removing\nboth a and its negation from the current belief state and\nthen implement Ramsey's recommendation of expanding with respect to\nthe modified state. This view embraces Open Preservation and abandons\nboth Weak Preservation (wp) and the axiom (U2) of\nupdate. \n\nSo, Levi's position retains a weaker version of Preservation but not\nthe one retained by update. Levi's view stands in complete opposition\nto the line of research opened by update and imaging,\nretaining a thorough epistemic point of view about the act of\nsupposition involved in evaluating conditionals. \n\nNotice that AGM is accepted neither by Levi (to represent a notion of\nepistemic supposition) nor by Gärdenfors (to encode the ontic\nnotion of supposing involved in evaluating Lewis's conditionals). The\nnotion of supposition seems to be governed by its own axioms, which\nneed not coincide with axioms capturing a diachronic notion of belief\nchange. \n\nA crucial component of Levi's model is the notion of\ncontraction needed to feign doubt as to the truth of a\nbelieved item. One salient feature of Levi's models is that they are\ngrounded on decision-theoretic techniques and this applies not only to\ncontraction but also to expansion, which in Levi's hands is treated as\na form of induction (see Levi 1996). \n \nOne of the main payoffs of the inductive models studied in Levi (1996)\nis the development of inductive models for non-monotonic\ninference. The notion of inference that thus arises has many formal\nfeatures in common with Reiter's default logic, obeying\nlittle else aside from the axiom called Cut: \n\nThe epistemic systems considered above are all conditional systems\nconstructed over non-nested languages. In this section we shall focus\non the weakest system of iterated conditionals induced by epistemic\nmodels.  The proposal in question is the one contained in\nArló-Costa (1999a). \n\nAn epistemic model (EM) is quadruple\n 〈E,\n ρ, s,\n *〉,\n where E is a set (heuristically: a set of epistemic\nstates); ρ is a function ρ: E →\nTL0; s is a function\ns: E →\nTL>, where\nTL> are the theories\nconstructible over L>; and * is a function *:\nE × L> →\nE. E is closed under revisions and\nB = Rng(ρ) is closed under expansions. The\nfunctions ρ, s, and * obey the following two constraints\nas well as IRT and INRT: \n\nIn this model the only epistemic primitives are the states in\nE. They could be theories or ranking\nsystems, or even probability functions. The ρ function yields\na set of held full beliefs ρ(E) held at epistemic state\nE. The function s yields the conditionals supported\nat state E. Finally, the belief revision function maps pairs\nof epistemic states and sentences of L> to\nepistemic states. \n\nFor every a ∈ L> and every\n M\n =\n 〈E,\n ρ, s,\n *〉,\n a is satisfiable in\n M\n if there is a consistent E ∈ E such\nthat a ∈ s(E). a is valid in\n M\n if a ∈ s(E) for every\nconsistent E ∈ E.  a is valid\nin a set of models S iff for every model\n M\n in S, a is valid in\n M.\n a is valid if it is valid in all models.  Finally,\nb is epistemically entailed by a in\n M\n =\n 〈E,\n ρ, s,\n *〉\n iff for every E in E such that a\n∈ s(E), b ∈\ns(E). \n\nFirst we need to define a conditional language smaller than\nL>. Let\n BC\n be the smallest language such that if a, b ∈\nL0, c, d ∈\n BC,\n then a > b, c > d,\n¬c, c\n ∧\n d ∈\n BC.\n Consider now the conditional system\n ECM.\n ECM\n is the smallest set of formulae in the language\nL> which is closed under (RCM) and (M), and\nwhich contains all instances of the axioms (I), (CC), (F) and all\nclassical tautologies and their substitution instances in the language\nL>. \n\nThe following completeness result shows the coincidence of the\ntheorems of the system\n ECM\n and the conditionals validated by the EMs. \n\n  Theorem 7  An L> formula a is valid iff a is a theorem in ECM.\n  \n\nThe results just presented indicate the basic logical structure of\niterated conditionals validated by iterated versions of Levi's Ramsey\ntest. The axiom F is derivable in very strong systems like\nStalnaker's C2, but aside from this limit case is not\nderivable in most of the ontic conditional systems reviewed\nabove. This seems to indicate that the logical structure of iterated\nepistemic conditionals is different from the logical structure of most\nof the ontic systems considered in the literature. \n\nOne topic mentioned only in passing above is concerned with models of\nindicative conditionals. Perhaps one of the most robust areas of\nresearch in this topic focuses on probabilistic models of the type we\nreviewed above. In fact, one of the most direct applications of the\nprobabilistic semantics developed by Adams, McGee and others has been\nrelated to providing a semantics for indicative conditionals. This is\nso even when some grammarians, like V. H. Dudman (1991), have\nquestioned the purity of the distinction between the indicative and\nthe subjunctive mood in English (so clearly stated otherwise in many\nof the other Indo-European languages). \n\nA second line of research regarding the semantics of indicative\nconditionals asserts that indicative and material conditionals have\nthe same truth conditions. This position has been defended by\nLewis (1973) and by Jackson (1987). There are nevertheless apparent\ncounterexamples to this thesis presented, for example, in section 1.10\nof Cross and Nute (2001). The examples show that contraposition is\nviolated in the case of some indicative conditionals. \n\nThis example, proposed by Cross and Nute (2001), is supposed to show\nthat even when there might be circumstances where it is appropriate to\nassert (1), this does not transfer unproblematically to (2). A line of\ndefense against examples of this type, adopted by Grice (1991) and by\nLewis (1973), is to distinguish carefully between assertion conditions\nand truth conditions. The assertion rules can then be used to counter\nthat even when (2) is literally true, it is not felicitous to assert\nit. \n\nA third line of research concerning indicative conditionals was\ninitiated by Stalnaker (1991) and by Davis (1979). The main idea is to\nuse a semantics in terms of selection functions both for indicatives\nand subjunctives, and to suggest that differences in mood are mirrored\nby differences in the properties of the world selection function used\nin the semantics of each type of conditional. \n \nStalnaker starts with a context set of possible worlds not\nruled out by the presupposed and commonly known background\ninformation. Then the main idea of the semantics for indicative\nconditionals is that in evaluating them at worlds in the context set\nthe world selected, must, if possible, be within the context set as\nwell. In other words, all worlds within the context set are closer to\neach other than any worlds outside it. In contrast the subjunctive\nmood in English and other languages can be seen as a conventional\ndevice for indicating that presuppositions are being suspended. This,\nof course, means in the case of indicative conditionals that the\nselection function used to evaluate them may reach outside the context\nset. \n\nA fourth proposal has been advanced by Levi (1996, section 2.5). Levi\ndefends in general an epistemic theory in terms of acceptance\nconditions rather than a truth theory in terms of selection\nfunctions. In spite of this big difference, there is much in his\ntheory that agrees with some of the previous proposals, mainly that\nthere are forms of supposition where a proposition is supposed to be\ntrue for the sake of the argument relative not to the current belief\nset, but to a background of shared agreements (or commonly presupposed\ninformation). Although Levi models this type of supposition in his\nbook, he follows Dudman on grammatical matters and therefore does not\nbelieve that this type of consensus supposition correlates\nperfectly with the use of the indicative mood in English. \n\nArló-Costa offers a fifth account that proposes\nthat the type of ‘matter of fact’ supposition involved in\nanalyzing conditionals is modeled by the notion of hypothetical\nrevision presented in Arló-Costa 2001. The main idea here\nis that the agent faces the process of supposition armed with a core\nsystem. The worlds in the outermost core encode the information that\nthe agent thinks is publicly shared. The system of cores permits\nrevising the expectations encoded in the innermost core, when the\nsupposed item is compatible with the presuppositions encoded via the\nset of worlds composing the outermost core. Nevertheless, there is no\nmatter-of-fact supposition with propositions incompatible with the\noutermost core; such suppositions lead to incoherence. This model is\nintended to capture as well the idea that indicative supposition is\nsupposition under a special set of constraints given by the agent's\nview of the shared agreements among agents in a relevant\npopulation. \n\nFurther information about indicative conditionals, especially\narguments pro and con the truth functionality of indicative\nconditionals, can be found in section two of Edgington (2006). Lycan\n(2001) contains an interesting discussion (chapter 7) of the\nindicative/subjunctive distinction which supports and extends Dudman's\nskepticism about the distinction for the Enlish conditional. Finally\nBennett (2003) offers a general overview of philosophical theories of\nconditionals. The book presents and evaluate various contemporary\ntheories of indicatives and subjunctives as well as Bennett's own view\nabout the indicative/subjunctive distinction.  \n\nF.P. Ramsey sketched in his celebrated footnote a mechanism to\nevaluate counterfactuals. The idea is that in evaluating ‘If\np then q’, ‘…[i]f either party\nbelieves not p for certain, the question ceases to mean\nanything to him except as a question about what follows from certain\nlaws or hypothesis.’ This fragment of the footnote has been\ninterpreted in many different ways. One of them suggests that in order\nto have a procedure to evaluate counterfactuals we need first a good\nmodel of the mechanisms and causal laws that operate in our\nworld. Counterfactuals are then analyzed in terms ‘of what\nfollows from’ these causal laws. \n\nThis, nevertheless, has not been the line of research emerging from\nLewis's book Counterfactuals. In a certain way the\nontological program in which this book was embedded reverses the\nordering of explanation just suggested. Lewis proposes to interpret\n‘A has caused B’ in terms of the\nfollowing counterfactual dependence: ‘B would not have\noccurred it is were not for A’; and to analyze the\ncounterfactual dependency in terms of a notion of similarity of worlds\nthat is taken at face value as a basic primitive. This type of\nanalysis leaves the notion of similarity unconstrained and\nmysterious. Moreover Fine (1975) suggests that similarity of\nappearance is inadequate. He considers a counterfactual that most of\nus consider true today: ‘Had Nixon pressed the button, a nuclear\nwar would have started’. Clearly a world where the button is\ndisconnected is many times more similar to our world than the one\nyielding a nuclear explosion. This suggests that similarity measures\ncannot be arbitrary and that they should respect our intuitive notion\nof causal laws. Lewis (1979) offered an intricate system of\nconstraints of different weights and priorities (the size of\nviolations of laws, or ‘miracles’, matching of facts,\ntemporal precedence, and so forth) trying to bring similarity closer\nto causal intuition. But as many have pointed out (see Woodward 2005,\nsection 3.6), problems remain. \n\nAn interesting alternative to this kind of approach is to reverse the\norder of explanation according to the initial ideas that Ramsey voiced\nin this footnote. Pearl (2000, p. 239) presents the idea in a clear\nway: \n\nCrucial to this type of approach is the notion of\n‘mini-surgery’ or, it as is usually known now,\nintervention. Representing interventions presupposes, in\nturn, the use of a graphical representation of causal connection\nthrough a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Much of the contemporary\ntheory of causation depends of the use of DAGs. \n\nThere are three main books that elaborate on the notion of\ncounterfactual arising from the analysis sketched above by Pearl. One\nis by Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines (2001). A second is Pearl's own\nbook (2000). The third is a more recent book by Woodward (2005) that\ntreats the notion of intervention in detail. \n\nFrom the perspective of formal logic, Pearl's book offers the most\ncomprehensive analysis, via an axiomatic comparison with Lewis's\nhierarchy of conditionals. But as Golszmidt and Pearl (1996) show,\nthere are many open problems in this area. Golszmidt and Pearl\nconjecture a complete characterization of ranking systems constrained\nby associated DAGs, and offer a specific Markov axiom mentioning\nexplicitly interventions in DAGs. This goes beyond the usual division\nof labor in terms of syntax and semantics, by adding a third level of\nrepresentation given in terms of DAGs. \n\nTwo important additional topics merit at least a passing mention\nhere. On the one hand there is interesting work linking conditionals\nand time, especially branching time structures. The idea is to enlarge\nthe representational framework by adding time explicitly and utilize\nthis extra degree of expressive power to extract insights about the\nrelations of closeness of worlds utilized in evaluating ontic\nconditionals. There is an excellent review of philosophical work in\nthis area in the relevant sections of Cross and Nute (2001). \n\nThe second area of research containing crucial work on conditional\nlogic is related to representing the interactive knowledge of agents\nengaged in playing non-coorperative games of both perfect and\nimperfect information. As the Nobel price winner Robert Aumann makes\nclear in various articles, the material conditional is not likely to\nprovide enough structure to analyze games. The following passage\n(Aumann 1995, section 5) shows the interest of conditionals that\nAumann calls substantive: \n\nThe analysis should be by now familiar, although it is not clear what\nexactly Aumann means by ‘ignoring White's actual\nmove’. This could be interpreted as Levi does in terms of\ncontracting all information about the current move and then\nunproblematically adding the information that he pushes his pawn. \n\nDov Samet (1996) has offered a concrete model of the notion of\nhypothetical knowledge, which he utilizes to offer epistemic\nmodels of backwards induction in games of perfect information. Finally\na Bayesian theory of conditionals which generalizes the one sketched\nin Selten and Leopold (1988) and the Stalnakerian view in terms of\nselection functions, is presented by Brian Skyrms in Skyrms (1998).\nThe theory is compared with Adams conditionals in Skyrms\n(1994). According to Skyrms the theory has interesting applications in\nanalyzing games of imperfect information (the analysis of games of\nperfect information only requires the use of arguments by \nreductio ad absurdum according to Skyrms)."}]
