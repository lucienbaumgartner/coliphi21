Disturbed by the failure of\nPtolemy’s geocentric model of the universe to follow Aristotle’s\nrequirement for the uniform circular motion of all celestial bodies\nand determined to eliminate Ptolemy’s equant, an imaginary point\naround which the bodies seemed to follow that requirement, Copernicus\ndecided that he could achieve his goal only through a heliocentric\nmodel. He thereby created a concept of a universe in which the\ndistances of the planets from the sun bore a direct relationship to\nthe size of their orbits. At the time Copernicus’s heliocentric idea\nwas very controversial; nevertheless, it was the start of a change in\nthe way the world was viewed, and Copernicus came to be seen as the\ninitiator of the Scientific Revolution.\n\n\n  Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473, the youngest of\nfour children of Nicolaus Copernicus, Sr., a well-to-do merchant who\nhad moved to Torun from Cracow, and Barbara Watzenrode, the daughter\nof a leading merchant family in Torun. The city, on the Vistula River,\nhad been an important inland port in the Hanseatic League. However,\nfighting between the Order of the Teutonic Knights and the Prussian\nUnion in alliance with the Kingdom of Poland ended in 1466, and West\nPrussia, which included Torun, was ceded to Poland, and Torun was\ndeclared a free city of the Polish kingdom. Thus the child of a German\nfamily was a subject of the Polish crown. \n  The father died in 1483, and the children’s maternal uncle, Lucas\nWatzenrode (1447–1512), took them under his protection. Watzenrode was\na very successful cleric – he was to become bishop of Warmia\n(Ermland in German) in 1489 – and he both facilitated his\nnephew’s advancement in the church and directed his education. In 1491\nCopernicus enrolled in the University of Cracow. There is no record of\nhis having obtained a degree, which was not unusual at the time as he\ndid not need a bachelor’s degree for his ecclesiastical career or even\nto study for a higher degree. But the University of Cracow offered\ncourses in mathematics, astronomy, and astrology (see Goddu 25–33 on\nall the university offerings), and Copernicus’s interest was sparked,\nwhich is attested to by his acquisition of books in these subjects\nwhile at Cracow.[1] \n  In 1495 Watzenrode arranged Copernicus’s election as canon of the\nchapter of Frombork (Frauenberg in German) of the Cathedral Chapter of\nWarmia, an administrative position just below that of bishop. He\nassumed the post two years later, and his financial situation was\nsecure for life. In the meantime, following in his uncle’s footsteps,\nCopernicus went to the University of Bologna in 1496 to study canon\nlaw (see Goddu part 2 on what Copernicus may have encountered in\nItaly). While at Bologna he lived with the astronomy professor\nDomenico Maria Novara and made his first astronomical observations. In\naddition, as Rosen (1971, 323) noted, “In establishing close\ncontact with Novara, Copernicus met, perhaps for the first time in his\nlife, a mind that dared to challenge the authority of [Ptolemy] the\nmost eminent ancient writer in his chosen fields of study.”\nCopernicus also gave a lecture on mathematics in Rome, which may have\nfocused on astronomy. \n  Copernicus’s studies at Bologna provided an advantage he did not\nhave at Cracow – a teacher of Greek. Humanism began to\ninfiltrate the Italian universities in the fifteenth century. As\nGrendler (510) remarked, “By the last quarter of the century,\npractically all universities had one or several humanists, many of\nthem major scholars.” Antonio Cortesi Urceo, called Codro,\nbecame professor at Bologna in 1482 and added Greek several years\nlater. Copernicus may have studied with him, for Copernicus translated\ninto Latin the letters of the seventh-century Byzantine author\nTheophylactus Simocatta (MW 27–71) from the 1499 edition of a\ncollection of Greek letters produced by the Venetian humanist printer\nAldus Manutius. Aldus had dedicated his edition to Urceo. Copernicus\nhad his translation printed in 1509, his only publication prior to\nthe On the Revolutions (De revolutionibus). It is\nimportant to note that Copernicus’s acquisition of a good reading\nknowledge of Greek was critical for his studies in astronomy because\nmajor works by Greek astronomers, including Ptolemy, had not yet been\ntranslated into Latin, the language of the universities at the\ntime. \n  Copernicus left Bologna for Frombork in 1501 without having\nobtained his degree. The chapter then approved another leave of\nabsence for Copernicus to study medicine at the University of\nPadua. The medical curriculum did not just include medicine, anatomy,\nand the like when Copernicus studied it. Siraisi (1990, 16) noted that\n“the reception in twefth-century western Europe of Greek and\nIslamic technical astronomy and astrology fostered the development of\nmedical astrology…the actual practice of medical astrology was\ngreatest in the West between the fourteenth and the sixteenth\ncenturies.” Astrology was taught in the medical schools of\nItaly. “The importance attached to the study of the stars in\nmedieval medical education derived from a general and widely held\nbelief that the heavenly bodies play an intermediary role in the\ncreation of things here below and continue to influence them\nthroughout their existence.  The actual uses of astrology in medical\ndiagnosis and treatment by learned physicians were many and various.\n‘Astrological medicine’ is a vague and unsatisfactory term\nthat can embrace any or all of the following: first, to pay attention\nto the supposed effect of astrological birth signs or signs at\nconception on the constitution and character of one’s patients;\nsecond, to vary treatment according to various celestial\nconditions…third, to connect the doctrine of critical days in\nillness with astrological features, usually phases of the moon; and\nfourth, to predict or explain epidemics with reference to planetary\nconjunctions, the appearance of comets, or weather conditions”\n(Siraisi, 1981, 141–42). It is true that astrology required that\nmedical students acquire some grounding in astronomy; nevertheless,\nit is likely that Copernicus studied astrology while at the\nUniversity of \n Padua.[2] \n  Copernicus did not receive his medical degree from Padua; the\ndegree would have taken three years, and Copernicus had only been\ngranted a two-year leave of absence by his chapter. Instead he\nmatriculated in the University of Ferrara, from which he obtained a\ndoctorate in canon law. But he did not return to his chapter in\nFrombork; rather he went to live with his uncle in the episcopal\npalace in Lidzbark-Warminski (Heilsberg in German). Although he made some\nastronomical observations, he was immersed in church politics, and\nafter his elderly uncle became ill in 1507, Copernicus was his\nattending physician. Rosen (1971, 334–35) reasonably conjectured that\nthe bishop may have hoped that his nephew would be his successor, but\nCopernicus left his uncle because his duties in Lidzbark-Warminski interfered\nwith his continuing pursuit of his studies in astronomy. He took up\nresidence in his chapter of Frombork in 1510 and stayed there the rest\nof his life. \n  Not that leaving his uncle and moving to Frombork exempted\nCopernicus from continued involvement in administrative and political\nduties. He was responsible for the administration of various holdings,\nwhich involved heading the provisioning fund, adjudicating disputes,\nattending meetings, and keeping accounts and records. In response to\nthe problem he found with the local currency, he drafted an essay on\ncoinage (MW 176–215) in which he deplored the debasement of\nthe currency and made recommendations for reform.  His manuscripts\nwere consulted by the leaders of both Prussia and Poland in their\nattempts to stabilize the currency. He was a leader for West Prussia\nin the war against the Teutonic Knights, which lasted from\n1520–1525. He was physician for the bishop (his uncle had died in\n1512) and members of the chapter, and he was consulting physician for\nnotables in East and West Prussia. \n  Nevertheless, Copernicus began to work on astronomy on his\nown. Sometime between 1510 and 1514 he wrote an essay that has come to\nbe known as the Commentariolus (MW 75–126) that\nintroduced his new cosmological idea, the heliocentric universe, and\nhe sent copies to various astronomers. He continued making\nastronomical observations whenever he could, hampered by the poor\nposition for observations in Frombork and his many pressing\nresponsibilities as canon. Nevertheless, he kept working on his\nmanuscript of On the Revolutions. He also wrote what is known as\nLetter against Werner (MW 145–65) in 1524, a\ncritique of Johann Werner’s “Letter concerning the Motion of the\nEighth Sphere” (De motu octavae sphaerae tractatus\nprimus). Copernicus claimed that Werner erred in his calculation\nof time and his belief that before Ptolemy the movement of the fixed\nstars was uniform, but Copernicus’s letter did not refer to his\ncosmological ideas. \n  In 1539 a young mathematician named Georg Joachim Rheticus\n(1514–1574) from the University of Wittenberg came to study with\nCopernicus. Rheticus brought Copernicus books in mathematics, in part\nto show Copernicus the quality of printing that was available in the\nGerman-speaking cities. He published an introduction to Copernicus’s\nideas, the Narratio prima (First Report). Most importantly,\nhe convinced Copernicus to publish On the Revolutions.\nRheticus oversaw most of the printing of the book, and on 24 May 1543\nCopernicus held a copy of the finished work on his deathbed. \n  Classical astronomy followed principles established by\nAristotle. Aristotle accepted the idea that there were four physical\nelements – earth, water, air, and fire. He put the earth in the\ncenter of the universe and contended that these elements were below\nthe moon, which was the closest celestial body. There were seven\nplanets, or wandering stars, because they had a course through the\nzodiac in addition to traveling around the earth: the moon, Mercury,\nVenus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter. Beyond that were the fixed stars. The\nphysical elements, according to Aristotle moved vertically, depending\non their ‘heaviness’ or ‘gravity’; the\ncelestial bodies were not physical but a ‘fifth element’\nor ‘quintessence’ whose nature was to move in perfect\ncircles around the earth, making a daily rotation. Aristotle\nenvisioned the earth as the true center of all the circles or\n‘orbs’ carrying the heavenly bodies around it and all\nmotion as ‘uniform,’ that is, unchanging. \n  But observers realized that the heavenly bodies did not move as\nAristotle postulated. The earth was not the true center of the orbits\nand the motion was not uniform. The most obvious problem was that the\nouter planets seemed to stop, move backwards in\n‘retrograde’ motion for a while, and then continue\nforwards. By the second century, when Ptolemy compiled his\nAlmagest (this common name of Ptolemy’s Syntaxis was\nderived from its Arabic title), astronomers had developed the concept\nthat the orbit moves in ‘epicycles’ around a\n‘deferrent,’ that is, they move like a flat heliacal coil\naround a circle around the earth. The earth was also off-center, on an\n‘eccentric,’ as the heavenly bodies moved around a central\npoint. Ptolemy added a point on a straight line opposite the\neccentric, which is called the ‘equalizing point’ or the\n‘equant,’ and around this point the heavenly bodies moved\nuniformly. Moreover, unlike the Aristotelian model, Ptolemy’s\nAlmagest did not describe a unified universe. The ancient\nastronomers who followed Ptolemy, however, were not concerned if his\nsystem did not describe the ‘true’ motions of the heavenly\nbodies; their concern was to ‘save the phenomena,’ that\nis, give a close approximation of where the heavenly bodies would be\nat a given point in time. And in an age without professional\nastronomers, let alone the telescope, Ptolemy did a good job plotting\nthe courses of the heavenly bodies. \n  Not all Greek astronomical ideas followed this geocentric\nsystem. Pythagoreans suggested that the earth moved around a central\nfire (not the sun). Archimedes wrote that Aristarchus of Samos\nactually proposed that the earth rotated daily and revolved around the\n sun.[3] \n  During the European Middle Ages, the Islamic world was the center of\nastronomical thought and activity. During the ninth century several\naspects of Ptolemy’s solar theory were recalculated. Ibn al-Haytham in\nthe tenth-eleventh century wrote a scathing critique of Ptolemy’s\nwork: “Ptolemy assumed an arrangement that cannot exist, and the\nfact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions\nthat belong to the planets does not free him from the error he\ncommitted in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the\nplanets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to\nexist” (quoted in Rosen 1984, 174). Swerdlow and Neugebauer\n(46–48) stressed that the thirteenth-century Maragha school was also\nimportant in finding errors and correcting Ptolemy: “The method\nof the Maragha planetary models was to break up the equant motion in\nPtolemy’s models into two or more components of uniform circular\nmotion, physically the uniform rotation of spheres, that together\ncontrol the direction and distance of the center of the epicycle, so\nthat it comes to lie in nearly the same position it would have in\nPtolemy’s model, and always moves uniformly with respect to the\nequant.” They found that Copernicus used devices that had been\ndeveloped by the Maragha astronomers Nasir al-Din Tusi (1201-1274),\nMuayyad al-Din al-Urdi (d. 1266), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236-1311),\nand Ibn al-Shatir (1304–1375). In addition, Ragep, 2005, has\nshown that a theory for the inner planets presented by Regiomontanus\nthat enabled Copernicus to convert the planets to eccentric models\nhad been developed by the fifteenth-century, Samarqand-trained\nastronomer ali Qushji\n (1403–1474).[4] \nRenaissance humanism did not necessarily promote natural philosophy,\nbut its emphasis on mastery of classical languages and texts had the\nside effect of promoting the sciences. Georg Peurbach\n(1423–1461) and (Johannes Müller) Regiomontanus\n(1436–1476) studied Greek for the purpose of producing an\noutline of Ptolemaic astronomy. By the time Regiomontanus finished the\nwork in 1463, it was an important commentary on the Almagest\nas well, pointing out, for example, that Ptolemy’s lunar theory did\nnot accord with observations. He noted that Ptolemy showed the moon to\nbe at various times twice as far from the earth as at other times,\nwhich should make the moon appear twice as big. At the time, moreover,\nthere was active debate over Ptolemy’s deviations from Aristotle’s\nrequirement of uniform circular motion. \n  It is impossible to date when Copernicus first began to espouse\nthe heliocentric theory. Had he done so during his lecture in Rome,\nsuch a radical theory would have occasioned comment, but there was\nnone, so it is likely that he adopted this theory after 1500. Further,\nCorvinus, who helped him print his Latin translation in 1508–09,\nexpressed admiration for his knowledge of astronomy, so that\nCopernicus’s concept may have still been traditional at this point. His\nfirst heliocentric writing was his Commentariolus. It was a\nsmall manuscript that was circulated but never printed. We do not know\nwhen he wrote this, but a professor in Cracow cataloged his books in\n1514 and made reference to a “manuscript of six leaves\nexpounding the theory of an author who asserts that the earth moves\nwhile the sun stands still” (Rosen, 1971, 343; MW\n75). Thus, Copernicus probably adopted the heliocentric theory\nsometime between 1508 and 1514. Rosen (1971, 345) suggested that\nCopernicus’s “interest in determining planetary positions in\n1512–1514 may reasonably be linked with his decisions to leave his\nuncle’s episcopal palace in 1510 and to build his own outdoor\nobservatory in 1513.” In other words, it was the result of a\nperiod of intense concentration on cosmology that was facilitated by\nhis leaving his uncle and the attendant focus on church politics and\nmedicine. \n  It is impossible to know exactly why Copernicus began to espouse\nthe heliocentric cosmology. Despite his importance in the history of\nphilosophy, there is a paucity of primary sources on Copernicus. His\nonly astronomical writings were the Commentariolus, the\nLetter against Werner, and On the Revolutions; he\npublished his translation of Theophylactus’s letters and wrote the\nvarious versions of his treatise on coinage; other writings relate to\ndiocesan business, as do most of the few letters that survive. Sadly,\nthe biography by Rheticus, which should have provided scholars with an\nenormous amount of information, has been lost.  Therefore, many of the\nanswers to the most interesting questions about Copernicus’s ideas and\nworks have been the result of conjecture and inference, and we can\nonly guess why Copernicus adopted the heliocentric system. \n  Most scholars believe that the reason Copernicus rejected\nPtolemaic cosmology was because of Ptolemy’s \n equant.[5] \n They assume this because of what Copernicus wrote in the\nCommentariolus:  Goddu (381–84) has plausibly maintained that while the initial\nmotivation for Copernicus was dissatisfaction with the equant, that\ndissatisfaction may have impelled him to observe other violations of\nuniform circular motion, and those observations, not the rejection of\nthe equant by itself, led to the heliocentric theory. Blumenberg (254)\nhas pointed out that the mobility of the earth may have been\nreinforced by the similarity of its spherical shape to those of the\nheavenly bodies.  As the rejection of the equant suggests a return to\nthe Aristotelian demand for true uniform circular motion of the\nheavenly bodies, it is unlikely that Copernicus adopted the\nheliocentric model because philosophies popular among Renaissance\nhumanists like Neoplatonism and Hermetism compelled him in that\n direction.[6] \n Nor should we attribute Copernicus’s desire for uniform circular\nmotions to an aesthetic need, for this idea was philosophical not\naesthetic, and Copernicus’s replacing the equant with epicyclets made\nhis system more complex than Ptolemy’s. Most importantly, we should\nbear in mind what Swerdlow and Neugebauer (59) asserted: \n  In the Commentariolus Copernicus listed assumptions that\nhe believed solved the problems of ancient astronomy. He stated that\nthe earth is only the center of gravity and center of the moon’s\norbit; that all the spheres encircle the sun, which is close to the\ncenter of the universe; that the universe is much larger than\npreviously assumed, and the earth’s distance to the sun is a small\nfraction of the size of the universe; that the apparent motion of the\nheavens and the sun is created by the motion of the earth; and that\nthe apparent retrograde motion of the planets is created by the\nearth’s motion. Although the Copernican model maintained epicycles\nmoving along the deferrent, which explained retrograde motion in the\nPtolemaic model, Copernicus correctly explained that the retrograde\nmotion of the planets was only apparent not real, and its appearance\nwas due to the fact that the observers were not at rest in the\ncenter. The work dealt very briefly with the order of the planets\n(Mercury, Venus, earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the only planets\nthat could be observed with the naked eye), the triple motion of the\nearth (the daily rotation, the annual revolution of its center, and\nthe annual revolution of its inclination) that causes the sun to seem\nto be in motion, the motions of the equinoxes, the revolution of the\nmoon around the earth, and the revolution of the five planets around\nthe sun. \n The Commentariolus was only intended as an\nintroduction to Copernicus’s ideas, and he wrote “the\nmathematical demonstrations intended for my larger work should be\nomitted for brevity’s sake…” (MW 82). In a sense\nit was an announcement of the greater work that Copernicus had\nbegun. The Commentariolus was never published during\nCopernicus’s lifetime, but he sent manuscript copies to various\nastronomers and philosophers. He received some discouragement because\nthe heliocentric system seemed to disagree with the Bible, but mostly\nhe was encouraged. Although Copernicus’s involvement with official\nattempts to reform the calendar was limited to a no longer extant\nletter, that endeavor made a new, serious astronomical theory\nwelcome. Fear of the reaction of ecclesiastical authorities was\nprobably the least of the reasons why he delayed publishing his\n book.[7] \n The most important reasons for the delay was that the larger work\nrequired both astronomical observations and intricate mathematical\nproofs. His administrative duties certainly interfered with both the\nresearch and the writing. He was unable to make the regular\nobservations that he needed and Frombork, which was often fogged in,\nwas not a good place for those observations. Moreover, as Gingerich\n(1993, 37) pointed out, \n  The manuscript of On the Revolutions was basically\ncomplete when Rheticus came to visit him in 1539. The work comprised\nsix books. The first book, the best known, discussed what came to be\nknown as the Copernican theory and what is Copernicus’s most important\ncontribution to astronomy, the heliocentric universe (although in\nCopernicus’s model, the sun is not truly in the center). Book 1 set\nout the order of the heavenly bodies about the sun: “[The sphere\nof the fixed stars] is followed by the first of the planets, Saturn,\nwhich completes its circuit in 30 years.  After Saturn, Jupiter\naccomplishes its revolution in 12 years. The Mars revolves in 2\nyears. The annual revolution takes the series’ fourth place, which\ncontains the earth…together with the lunar sphere as an\nepicycle. In the fifth place Venus returns in 9 months. Lastly, the\nsixth place is held by Mercury, which revolves in a period of 80\ndays” (Revolutions, 21–22). This established a\nrelationship between the order of the planets and their periods, and\nit made a unified system. This may be the most important argument in\nfavor of the heliocentric model as Copernicus described \n it.[8] \n It was far superior to Ptolemy’s model, which had the planets\nrevolving around the earth so that the sun, Mercury, and Venus all had\nthe same annual revolution.  In book 1 Copernicus also insisted that\nthe movements of all bodies must be circular and uniform, and noted\nthat the reason they may appear nonuniform to us is “either that\ntheir circles have poles different [from the earth’s] or that the\nearth is not at the center of the circles on which they revolve”\n(Revolutions, 11). Particularly notable for Copernicus was\nthat in Ptolemy’s model the sun, the moon, and the five planets seemed\nironically to have different motions from the other heavenly bodies\nand it made more sense for the small earth to move than the immense\nheavens. But the fact that Copernicus turned the earth into a planet\ndid not cause him to reject Aristotelian physics, for he maintained\nthat “land and water together press upon a single center of\ngravity; that the earth has no other center of magnitude; that, since\nearth is heavier, its gaps are filled with water…”\n(Revolutions, 10). As Aristotle had asserted, the earth was\nthe center toward which the physical elements gravitate. This was a\nproblem for Copernicus’s model, because if the earth was no longer the\ncenter, why should elements gravitate toward it? \n  The second book of On the Revolutions elaborated the\nconcepts in the first book; book 3 dealt with the precession of the\nequinoxes and solar theory; book 4 dealt with the moon’s motions; book\n5 dealt with the planetary longitude and book 6 with \n latitude.[9] \n Copernicus depended very much on Ptolemy’s observations, and there\nwas little new in his mathematics. He was most successful in his work\non planetary longitude, which, as Swerdlow and Neugebauer (77)\ncommented, was “Copernicus’s most admirable, and most demanding,\naccomplishment…It was above all the decision to derive new\nelements for the planets that delayed for nearly half a lifetime\nCopernicus’s continuation of his work – nearly twenty years\ndevoted to observation and then several more to the most tedious kind\nof computation – and the result was recognized by his\ncontemporaries as the equal of Ptolemy’s accomplishment, which was\nsurely the highest praise for an astronomer.” Surprisingly,\ngiven that the elimination of the equant was so important in the\nCommentariolus, Copernicus did not mention it in book 1, but\nhe sought to replace it with an epicyclet throughout On the\nRevolutions. Nevertheless, he did write in book 5 when\ndescribing the motion of Mercury: \n  Although Copernicus received encouragement to publish his book from\nhis close friend, the bishop of Chelmo Tiedemann Giese (1480–1550),\nand from the cardinal of Capua Nicholas Schönberg (1472–1537), it\nwas the arrival of Georg Joachim Rheticus in Frombork that solved his\nneeds for a supportive and stimulating colleague in mathematics and\nastronomy and for access to an appropriate printer. Rheticus was a\nprofessor of mathematics at the University of Wittenberg, a major\ncenter for the student of mathematics as well as for Lutheran\ntheology. In 1538 Rheticus took a leave of absence to visit several\nfamous scholars in the fields of astronomy and mathematics. It is not\nknown how Rheticus learned about Copernicus’s theory; he may have been\nconvinced to visit Copernicus by one of the earlier scholars he had\nvisited, Johann Schöner, though, as Swerdlow and Neugebauer (16)\nnoted, by “the early 1530’s knowledge of Copernicus’s new theory\nwas circulating in Europe, even reaching the high and learned circles\nof the Vatican.” Rheticus brought with him some mathematical and\nastronomical volumes, which both provided Copernicus with some\nimportant material and showed him the quality of the mathematical\nprinting available in the German centers of\n publishing.[10] \n Rheticus’s present of the 1533 edition of Regiomontanus’s On all\nKinds of Triangles (De triangulis omnimodis), for\nexample, convinced Copernicus to revise his section on\ntrigonometry. But Rheticus was particularly interested in showing\nCopernicus the work of the Nuremberg publisher Johann Petreius as a\npossible publisher of Copernicus’s volume.  Swerdlow and Neugebauer\n(25) plausibly suggested that “Petreius was offering to publish\nCopernicus’s work, if not advertising by this notice that he was\nalready committed to do so.” Rheticus wrote the Narratio\nprima in 1540, an introduction to the theories of Copernicus,\nwhich was published and circulated.  This further encouraged\nCopernicus to publish his Revolutions, which he had been\nworking on since he published the\nCommentariolus. \n  The Narratio prima was written in 1539 and took the form\nof a letter to Johann Schöner announcing Copernicus’s findings\nand describing the contents of the Revolutions. He dealt with\nsuch topics as the motions of the fixed stars, the tropical year, the\nobliquity of the ecliptic, the problems resulting from the motion of\nthe sun, the motions of the earth and the other planets, librations,\nlongitude in the other five planets, and the apparent deviation of the\nplanets from the ecliptic. He asserted that the heliocentric universe\nshould have been adopted because it better accounted for such\nphenomena as the precession of the equinoxes and the change in the\nobliquity of the ecliptic; it resulted in a diminution of the\neccentricity of the sun; the sun was the center of the deferents of\nthe planets; it allowed the circles in the universe to revolve\nuniformly and regularly; it satisfied appearances more readily with\nfewer explanations necessary; it united all the spheres into one\nsystem.  Rheticus added astrological predictions and number mysticism,\nwhich were absent from Copernicus’s work. \n  The Narratio prima was printed in 1540 in Gdansk (then\nDanzig); thus, it was the first printed description of the Copernican\nthesis. Rheticus sent a copy to Achilles Pirmin Gasser of Feldkirch,\nhis hometown in modern-day Austria, and Gasser wrote a foreword that\nwas published with a second edition that was produced in 1541 in\nBasel. It was published again in 1596 as an appendix to the first\nedition of Johannes Kepler’s Mysterium cosmographicum (Secret\nof the Universe), the first completely Copernican work by an\nadherent since the publications by Copernicus and Rheticus. \n  The publication of Rheticus’s Narratio prima did not\ncreate a big stir against the heliocentric thesis, and so Copernicus\ndecided to publish On the Revolutions. He added a dedication\nto Pope Paul III (r. 1534–1549), probably for political reasons, in\nwhich he expressed his hesitancy about publishing the work and the\nreasons he finally decided to publish it. He gave credit to\nSchönberg and Giese for encouraging him to publish and omitted\nmention of Rheticus, but it would have been insulting to the pope\nduring the tense period of the Reformation to give credit to a\nProtestant \n minister.[11] \n He dismissed critics who might have claimed that it was against the\nBible by giving the example of the fourth-century Christian apologist\nLactantius, who had rejected the spherical shape of the earth, and by\nasserting, “Astronomy is written for astronomers”\n(Revolutions, \n 5).[12] \n In other words, theologians should not\nmeddle with it. He pointed to the difficulty of calendar reform\nbecause the motions of the heavenly bodies were inadequately\nknown. And he called attention to the fact that “if the motions\nof the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth,\nand are computed for the revolution of each planet, not only do their\nphenomena follow therefrom but also the order and size of all the\nplanets and spheres, and heaven itself is so linked together that in\nno portion of it can anything be shifted without disrupting the\nremaining parts and the universe as a whole”\n(Revolutions, 5). \n  Rheticus returned to Wittenberg in 1541 and the following year\nreceived another leave of absence, at which time he took the\nmanuscript of the Revolutions to Petreius for publishing in\nNuremberg. Rheticus oversaw the printing of most of the text.\nHowever, Rheticus was forced to leave Nuremberg later that year\nbecause he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of\nLeipzig. He left the rest of the management of printing the\nRevolutions to Andrew Osiander (1498–1552), a Lutheran\nminister who was also interested in mathematics and astronomy. Though\nhe saw the project through, Osiander appended an anonymous preface to\nthe work. In it he claimed that Copernicus was offering a hypothesis,\nnot a true account of the working of the heavens: “Since he [the\nastronomer] cannot in any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt\nwhatever suppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly from\nthe principles of geometry for the future as well as for the past\n…these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable”\n(Revolutions, xvi). This clearly contradicted the body of the\nwork. Both Rheticus and Giese protested, and Rheticus crossed it out\nin his copy. \n  Copernicus’s fame and book made its way across Europe over the\nnext fifty years, and a second edition was brought out in\n 1566.[13] \n As Gingerich’s census of the extant copies showed, the book was read\nand commented on by astronomers. (For a fuller discussion of reactions, see Omodeo.) Gingerich (2004, 55) noted\n“the majority of sixteenth-century astronomers thought\neliminating the equant was Copernicus’ big achievement.” \n  While Martin Luther may have made negative comments about\nCopernicus because the idea of the heliocentric universe seemed to\ncontradict the \n Bible,[14] \n Philip Melanchthon (1497–1560), who presided over the curriculum at\nthe University of Wittenberg, eventually accepted the importance of\nteaching Copernicus’s ideas, perhaps because Osiander’s preface made\nthe work more palatable. His son-in-law Caspar Peucer (1525-1602)\ntaught astronomy there and began teaching Copernicus’s work.  As a\nresult, the University of Wittenberg became a center where\nCopernicus’s work was studied. But Rheticus was the only Wittenberg\nscholar who accepted the heliocentric idea. Robert Westman (1975a,\n166–67; 2011, chap. 5) suggested that there was a ‘Wittenberg\nInterpretation’: astronomers appreciated and adopted some of\nCopernicus’s mathematical models but rejected his cosmology, and some\nwere pleased with his replacement of the equant by epicyclets. One of\nthese was Erasmus Reinhold (1511–1553), a leading astronomer at\nWittenberg who became dean and rector. He produced a new set of\nplanetary tables from Copernicus’s work, the Prutenic\nTables. Although, as Gingerich (1993, 232) pointed out, “there\nwas relatively little to distinguish between the accuracy of the\nAlfonsine Tables and the Prutenic Tables,” the\nlatter were more widely adopted; Gingerich plausibly suggested that\nthe fact that the Prutenic Tables more accurately predicted a\nconjunction between Jupiter and Saturn in 1563 made the\ndifference. Reinhold did not accept the heliocentric theory, but he\nadmired the elimination of the equant. The Prutenic Tables excited\ninterest in Copernicus’s work. \n  Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) was the greatest astronomical observer\nbefore the invention of the telescope. He called Copernicus a\n‘second Ptolemy’ (quoted in Westman 1975, 307) and\nappreciated both the elimination of the equant and the creation of a\nplanetary system. But Tycho could not adopt the Copernican system,\npartly for the religious reason that it went against what the Bible\nseemed to preach. He, therefore, adopted a compromise, the\n‘geoheliostatic’ system in which the two inner planets\nrevolved around the sun and that system along with the rest of the\nplanets revolved around the earth. \n  Among Catholics, Christoph Clavius (1537–1612) was the leading\nastronomer in the sixteenth century. A Jesuit himself, he incorporated\nastronomy into the Jesuit curriculum and was the principal scholar\nbehind the creation of the Gregorian calendar. Like the Wittenberg\nastronomers, Clavius adopted Copernican mathematical models when he\nfelt them superior, but he believed that Ptolemy’s cosmology –\nboth his ordering of the planets and his use of the equant – was\ncorrect. \n  Pope Clement VII (r. 1523–1534) had reacted favorably to a talk\nabout Copernicus’s theories, rewarding the speaker with a rare\nmanuscript. There is no indication of how Pope Paul III, to whom\nOn the Revolutions was dedicated reacted; however, a trusted\nadvisor, Bartolomeo Spina of Pisa (1474–1546) intended to\ncondemn it but fell ill and died before his plan was carried out (see\nRosen, 1975). Thus, in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on\nthe Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When\nGiordano Bruno (1548–1600) was burned at the stake as a heretic,\nit had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican\ncosmology, and this is clearly shown in Finocchiaro’s reconstruction\nof the accusations against Bruno (see also Blumenberg’s part 3,\nchapter 5, titled “Not a Martyr for Copernicanism: Giordano\nBruno”). \nMichael Maestlin (1550–1631) of the University of Tübingen\nwas the earliest astronomer after Rheticus to adopt Copernicus’s\nheliocentricism. Although he wrote a popular textbook that was\ngeocentric, he taught his students that the heliocentric system was\nsuperior. He also rejected Osiander’s preface.  Maestlin’s pupil\nJohannes Kepler wrote the first book since the publication of On\nthe Revolutions that was openly heliocentric in its orientation,\nthe Mysterium cosmographicum (Secret of the Universe). And,\nof course, Kepler eventually built on Copernicus’s work to create a\nmuch more accurate description of the solar system. ","contact.mail":"rabinhist@nyc.rr.com","contact.domain":"nyc.rr.com"}]
