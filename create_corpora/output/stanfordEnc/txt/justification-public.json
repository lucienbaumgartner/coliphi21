According to these theorists the recognition of\ncitizens as free and equal moral persons requires that coercion be\njustified for or to others by their own lights, or with reasons that\nthey could recognize as valid. On this view, a public justification is\nachieved when members of the relevant public have adequate or\nsufficient reason to endorse a particular coercive proposal, law or\npolicy. Those who endorse this requirement are often called public\nreason liberals as they hold that the coercive power of the state must\nbe justified for or to all members of the public on the basis of good\nreasons.\n\n\nCoercion is taken to be the object of public justification because it\nis the characteristic feature of political life. Charles Larmore\nremarks that public justification has “to do with the sort of\nrespect we owe one another in the political realm — that is, in\nrelationships where the possibility of coercion is involved”\n(Larmore 2008, 86). Rawls’s principle of public justification holds\nthat it is political power that must be justified (Rawls 2005, 12)\nsince, as he remarks, “political power is always coercive\npower” (Rawls 2005, 68). Jonathan Quong holds that public\njustification concerns the imposition of coercive laws (Quong 2011,\n233–250). And, as Christopher Eberle puts it, (2002, 54)\n“the clarion call of justificatory liberalism is the public\njustification of coercion.” In recent years, some public reason\nliberals have wondered whether legal coercion is all that requires\npublic justification (2.7), but they nonetheless agree that coercion\ngenerally, if not always, requires public justification.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the characteristic association between public reason\nliberalism and the requirement of public justification, public\njustification is the genus and public reason the species. The idea of\npublic justification is, at its root, an idea about what\njustifies coercion. Although we can arrive at a state in which some\nsocial arrangement is publicly justified by an explicit course of\nreasoning leading to the legitimation of that social state, this is\nnot intrinsic to the more general idea of public justification, as\nwill be seen below. In particular, we can arrive at a social state in\nwhich some arrangement is publicly justified by non-deliberative,\nindeed non-discursive means, and it is for this reason that public\nreason is a narrower notion than public justification.\n\n\nJohn Rawls was the foremost advocate of the idea of public\njustification, though its importance is also stressed in the works of\nJürgen Habermas, David Gauthier, Gerald Gaus, Stephen Macedo,\nCharles Larmore, Seyla Benhabib, and many others. There is considerable\ndisagreement about how to understand the idea. For instance, some hold\nthat all public justifications must occur via shared or accessible\nreasons (often called consensus theorists), whereas others (often\ncalled convergence theorists) hold that public justification can be\nobtained if different points of view each provide good grounds for a\nparticular policy (see\n Section 2.3\n below). Public justification theorists also disagree about the right\nlevel of idealization or how to attribute reasons to citizens, which\noften involves imagining them as possessing superior information and\ncognitive abilities. This entry explicates the idea of public\njustification in terms of a Public Justification Principle (PJP) that\nprovides a classificatory system for these competing conceptions.\n\n\nThe entry begins by situating the idea of public justification in\nthe history of political philosophy and examining the motivations for\nemploying it. The PJP is then stated and explained, along with its\nrelevant variables, including the conceptions of justificatory\nreasons, idealization, modalities of public justification, and whether\ncoercion alone requires public justification.  Different foundations\nfor the PJP are then discussed. The entry also discusses concepts\nclosely tied to public justification, such as the ideas of stability\nand publicity. Various objections to the PJP are then reviewed and the\nentry ends with a brief discussion of how the idea of public\njustification is employed in various applied issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of public justification has been refined over the last\nseveral decades from materials drawn from the social contract\ntradition. The great social contract theorists – Hobbes, Locke,\nRousseau and Kant – all held that for a political order to be\nlegitimate it had to be agreed upon by or justified for each person.\nOf course, these theorists differed substantially about how such a\ndemonstration should proceed. Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau developed\nconsent theories of legitimacy, but these three theorists seemed to\noscillate between an empirical standard of consent and a normative\nstandard of consent. On the empirical standard, we have public\njustification for some arrangement when what each party actually\nbelieves, desires, and values is effectual in motivating her consent\nto the implementation of that arrangement. On the normative account,\nwe have public justification for some arrangement when what each party\nideally would believe, desire, and value gives her reason to consent\nto the implementation of that arrangement. In the latter case, we\nsometimes speak of hypothetical consent. One reason these theorists\nmay have had for transitioning from actual to hypothetical consent is\nthat they hoped to identify a rational justification of a political\norder that was not based on a sectarian theology or ideology, which\nmight happen to enjoy widespread, but probably not universal support\nwithin the relevant community. Instead, they wanted to show that each\nperson, given their diverse interests and reasons, still had\nsufficient reason to comply with some form of political regime even if\nthat regime did not permit them to act as they would like. On this\nunderstanding of the social contract, it makes sense that, by\nKant’s time, the standard of actual consent had disappeared,\nreplaced with a standard of hypothetical consent. This appears to be a\nmove away from actual consent and towards a normative standard of\nlegitimacy. \nNotice that all four theorists were aware of and concerned about the\ndiversity of private judgments about justice and right action, which\nmight systematically diverge for any number of reasons. All of these\ntheorists concluded therefore that the private judgment of a few could\nnot serve as the basis for legitimacy for a diverse people. As Rawls\n(2005, xvii) would eventually put it, these theorists recognized,\nhowever dimly, the fact of reasonable pluralism—that citizens\nwho freely exercise their powers of reasoning will tend to pervasively\nand persistently disagree about their fundamental values and\nprinciples. The contract theorists concluded that the justification of\ncoercive social arrangements had to respect, with some limits, this\ndiversity of judgments and, hence, that justification could not be\ntied, either empirically or normatively, to some one specific set of\nbeliefs, desires, and values. Such a justification had to be impartial\namong at least the normatively respectable diversity of points of\nview. \nThe idea of justifiability to all had just surfaced in Kant’s work when it\nwas laid to rest for over a century. As time progressed, social\ncontract theory was displaced by utilitarianism, Hegelianism and\nMarxism. These three schools of political thought criticized the idea\nof a social contract, though for different reasons. The social\ncontract tradition would be revived only during the post-war period in\nthe United States. One of the first four forms of social\ncontract theory to arise was contractarianism, which attempts to\njustify coercive institutions in terms of pure instrumental\nrationality through rational bargains among parties dividing social\nresources. The first 20th century contract theorists were\neconomists, especially John Harsanyi and James Buchanan, though\nattempts to work out such a theory later spread to neo-Hobbesian\nphilosophers, especially David Gauthier, Jean Hampton and Gregory\nKavka. But the dominant strand of the contract tradition is the\nKantian version articulated by John Rawls, from his early work (1951,\n1958) to A Theory of Justice and finally in Political\nLiberalism where the idea of public justification plays an\nexplicit and central role. Rawls initially understood public\njustification entirely in terms of a hypothetical contract where\nprinciples of justice were justified for all members of the public. It\nwould not be until Political Liberalism that Rawls would\nexplicitly articulate the challenge that reasonable pluralism poses to\npolitical philosophy. For Rawls, members of the public must live\naccording to principles that are justified for all despite the deep\ndifferences among them. Political power can only be legitimate when it\nis exercised in ways compatible with publicly justified norms. (It is\nimportant to note that “justified” and “publicly\njustified” are synonyms only for some theorists and that, on\nsome accounts, a principle might be publicly justified because it is\nseparately justified for each relevant individual, though perhaps in\ndifferent ways. See 2.3 below.) \nThus, while public justification was a theme in neo-Hobbesian and\nneo-Kantian political theory (and later deliberative democratic\npolitical theory), it only came to full light in the early 1990s.\nAfterwards, many works on public reason and justification were\npublished in rapid succession, the result of which is a new tradition\nof political thought that flourishes today. The idea of public\njustification is thus a core social and political concept in\ncontemporary political philosophy. However, public justification\nadmits of considerable variation. Each strand in the tradition\nresolves core ambiguities differently. These strands are examined in\nwhat follows. \nThe family of public reason liberal political theories (and others,\nsuch as Gaus, who sever the typical connection between public\nreasoning and public justification) can be categorized in\naccord with a master principle, the Public Justification\nPrinciple (PJP). This principle is a formal representation of\nthis family of theories and it is used throughout the entry to\nclassify variations on the idea of public justification. Define the PJP as follows: \nThe Public Justification Principle (PJP): A coercive law\nL is justified in a public P if and only if each member\ni of P has sufficient reason(s)\nRi to endorse L. \nThe generality of the principle, which permits individuals 1 and 2,\nfor example, to have different reasons to endorse L, means\nthat, on some accounts, it is not the reasons which are public, in the\nsense of shared among all members of P. Even in this case,\nhowever, the justification of L may be public in the sense that\nthere is, for every member of P, a reason why she endorses\nL and, hence, L is, subject to some other provisos,\njustified for the public P. The justification is\n“public” because it is a justification that encompasses a\npublic, though it does so severally and individually. It is not\nnecessarily public in another important sense, i.e., the kind of\npublicity associated with common knowledge. So an individual’s\nreason is Ri need not be commonly known to others\nwho are members of the same public P. This would be an\nadditional condition which is not imposed here. \nPJP can be analyzed in terms of the answers to the following six\nquestions: \nBefore continuing, it is necessary to reiterate that public\njustification is not limited to those cases where reasons are\nsuccessfully presented to others in justification of some\nclaim. As indicated above, that is not the most general\nspecification of the idea of public justification. Instead, it is\nsimply one way to understand how the PJP is satisfied or how a public\njustification is brought about. Public justifications may be brought\nabout in other ways as well (see 2.7). Notwithstanding this point, a\nkey idea requires some further elucidation here, namely the idea of a\nreason and, in particular, a sufficient reason to endorse some\nlaw L. (One account of the point just made is that a justifying\nreason may be one that an individual i has without its being one that\nis presented by or to her discursively in an explicit course of\nreasoning. Notice also that one individual’s sufficient reason\nto endorse L might differ from other individuals’ reasons\nto endorse L.) \nNotwithstanding the complexities already mentioned (one person’s\nreason may not be another’s; a reason R doesn’t have to be\npresented by or to an individual i in order for R to be\ni’s reason to endorse L; etc.), the PJP requires that\nindividual members of a public P have reason to\nendorse a principle L if that principle is to be considered\nlegitimate. What counts as i’s “having reason to endorse\nL” therefore needs to be specified. \nA common approach to reasons in normative ethics is to take the idea\nof a reason as a primitive. A reason to Φ is simply a\nconsideration that counts in favor of Φ-ing (Scanlon 1998, 17).\nBut the idea of a reason in public justification political theory is\nmore specific. While many leave the idea under-discussed, we do not\nneed a complex ontology of reasons, only a standard for what public\nreason liberals should count as a justificatory reason. Gaus\nhas provided a conception of reasons he thinks is most appropriate to\nthe project of public justification. In Justificatory\nLiberalism, he holds that one has a justificatory reason when the\nreason is openly justified or when it is “stable in the face of\nacute and sustained criticism by others and of new information”\n(Gaus 1996, 31). This means that a reason is sufficient for a single\nmember of the public when it is both justifiably affirmed by that\nperson and when the member has no other reason that overrides or\ndefeats it in the relevant circumstances. However, simply because a\nreason is sufficient for one member of the public does not mean it is\nsufficient to justify the coercion in question for all members of the\npublic. A coercive law is only justified when each person has a\nsufficient reason to endorse the law. Thus, a law is justified based\non sufficient reasons when each person has a sufficient reason in this\nsense to endorse the law. \nA core assumption of public reason liberalism, the political theory\nassociated with the idea of public justification, is that\npeople’s reasons for action and belief can differ\nsubstantially. Consequently, a reason must in some sense be relative\nto an agent’s beliefs, values and other commitments. While\npublic reason liberals need not share Gaus’s epistemology of\njustificatory reasons, the right account cannot be too far off, for\nany public reason liberal must accept that citizens can be rational to\ncomply with reasons that others systematically reject and so, in some\nway or another, different individuals must be epistemically justified\nin affirming very different reasons. Note that this does not mean that\nmembers of the public must acknowledge the validity of a particular\nconception of justificatory reasons, rather that the public reason\nliberal theorist must accept an epistemology of justificatory\nreasons that allows that different reasons can be epistemically\njustified for different persons. \nA principle of association A (such as a law or policy or constitution)\nis publicly justified for members of P if each i in\nP has a sufficient reason to endorse A. This leaves open\nthe question of the “granularity” of A: how\nspecific is A in relation to the conduct of members of\nP? Does it require specific forms of behavior? or does it\nfunction at some more abstract level, for instance by specifying the\nsorts of institutions (legislature, court, bureau) that might develop,\nthrough their own processes, subsidiary principles requiring specific\nforms of behavior? \nRawls held (2005, 140) that the requirement of public justification\napplies merely to “constitutional essentials” and that\npublic justification is required when “basic questions of\njustice” are at stake. Jonathan Quong has argued (2004,\n233–250) that the requirement of public justification applies\nfirst and foremost to laws, a more finely grained kind of principle\njustifying coercion. Gaus (2011, 495) holds that the requirement of\njustification applies to laws that lack “strong interactive\neffects” with other laws. For instance, a law banning smoking\nlacks strong interactive effects with a law that provides a corn\nsubsidy. His argument for this level of granularity is that the unit\nof public justification must be narrow enough to identify specific\nforms of behavior as permitted or prohibited but general enough that\nit can rightly be understood and internalized as governing classes of\nbehavior (Gaus 2011, 122–125). We focus on law L as the\nrelevant principle of association for purposes of brevity,\nacknowledging that some public reason liberals work with other\nprinciples of association.  \nWe turn now to one of the most important sources of disagreement among\npublic reason liberals, the disagreement concerning the nature of\njustificatory reasons described by variable Ri in\nthe PJP. The mainstream view within public reason liberalism is that\njustificatory reasons are public reasons in the sense that they can be\nshared by all members of the public (or, at least, be\n“accessible” to them in a sense to be elucidated below\n(see 2.3.2)). In general, variable Ri is indexed to\nmembers of the public, R1, …,\nRn, but on some (consensus) interpretations of PJP,\nRi is the same for each individual i. But on another\n(convergence) interpretation, justificatory reasons need merely be\nreasons that all citizens can see as justified according to reasonable\nevaluative standards, even if they do not accept those standards\nthemselves. For instance, on a convergence view, a religious reason\ncan be justificatory if it is based on reasonable religious evaluative\nstandards that a non-religious citizen might reasonably reject for\nherself but that she can still acknowledge as reasonable for others.\nIn this case, one individual’s reasons for considering some\narrangement legitimate might differ from another individual’s reasons;\neach has reasons, but these reasons aren’t the same in the two cases.\n(See D’Agostino 1996, 30.) \nThis is a difficult concept, admittedly, and we consider it further\nbelow. It ought to be familiar, though, given that it is the sort of\nconvergence which underwrites, for example, the legitimacy of market\ntransactions. So, for example, antecedently A has apples\nand B has bananas. Because A wants bananas and B\nwants apples (two different reasons for action), we may find, subject\nto other conditions being fulfilled, that, later, after a trade,\nA has bananas and B has apples. This later state of\naffairs is “justified” for A and B because\neach has a reason for preferring this state to the antecedent state,\neven though their reasons are different reasons. And indeed, though\nthis would be stretching the analogy to public justification\ntoo far, A’s reasons for wanting bananas might be quite\nunintelligible to B (perhaps he wants them for some religious\nritual and she is an atheist) without that undermining the\n“justification” of the posterior state of affairs. Indeed,\nA and B need neither share, endorse, or even know what\nthe other’s reason is; none of this undermines the\n“justification” of the post-trade situation. \nIn other words, a convergence conception of reasons requires only that\nindividuals have their own individual reasons Ri\n(R1, R2, … ,\nRn) to support a coercive law L, whereas the\nconsensus conception requires, in the limit, that all members of the\npublic share a (set of) reason(s) R to endorse L. Of\ncourse, even unshared reasons have to be subject to some discipline\nbefore we can speak even of convergence rather than consensus based\npublic justification. A’s reasons for endorsing some principle\nL might be so repugnant that the fact that they count in favor\nof L might actually undermine L’s claims to public\njustification (and might do so even if there were other and in her\nfellow citizens’ view, better reasons for endorsing L). \nThe consensus approach, understood as requiring that reasons be\nsomehow mutually shared or accessible, is by far the dominant\nconception of public justification. The convergence view is in the\nminority, both in earlier works (Gaus 1990, 256; Stout 2004; Klosko\n1993; Rawls 2005) and more contemporary work (Gaus 2011; Vallier\n2014). \nRawls’s view helps to illustrate the complexities involved in the\ndistinction, as he seems to have combined the two approaches. In the\nfirst “freestanding”\nconception of political justification, Rawls (2005, 12) requires that\ncitizens reason on shared terms in order to converge on a political\nconception of justice. But in the second “overlapping\nconsensus” conception, Rawls leaves it “to each\nperson” to render the political conception compatible with her\ndistinct, unshared comprehensive doctrine. Rawls included these two\nconceptions of justificatory reasons in a single account of political\njustification due to the need to identify a common, political\nconception of justice that all reasonable persons could share as\nregulative of their actions while simultaneously justifying the\nconception for each reasonable point of view. However, while a\ncombination may be attractive, several writers have identified a\ntension between the two forms of justification and resolve it in favor\nof one conception of justificatory reasons or the other. Habermas (1995)\nprovides the most well-known illustration of the tension. \nWe’ve mentioned that there are, plausibly, some limits to how relaxed we\ncan be about the diversity of different reasons for endorsing L\nthat can be entertained by the advocate of a convergence approach. Of\ncourse, some discipline is implicit in the concept of “a\nreason”. A factual claim, for example, does not count as a\nreason for (or against) endorsing some proposed principle L if\nthere is evidence available to relevant individuals which would, in\nconjunction with reasonable rules of inference, imply its falsity. And\na normative claim does not count as a reason in respect of L if\nit is utterly lacking in legitimacy, however that might be determined.\nBut this still leaves a great variety of potential reasons available\nand some theorists, in seeking to organize this variety have proposed\nsome additional tests that it might be appropriate to place on\npotential reasons. These are, in order of increasing stringency,\nintelligibility, accessibility, and shareability. \nDefine intelligibility and the intelligibility requirement as\nfollows: \nIntelligibility: A’s reason RA is\nintelligible to members of the public if and only if members of the\npublic regard RA as justified for A according\nto A’s evaluative standards. \nIntelligibility Requirement: A’s reason\nRA can figure in a justification for (or rejection\nof) a coercive law L only if it is intelligible to all members\nof the public. \nIntelligible reasons are those that members of the public can see as\nreasons for those who advance (or rely upon) them, as opposed to mere\nutterances, expressions of emotions, irrational demands or other\nirrelevant considerations. They see the grounds identified by\nas reasons in A’s understanding of what counts as a\nreason; RA is therefore intelligible to them as\nsomething that would count for A as a reason. \nDefenders of intelligibility (Vallier 2016b) argue that reasonable\npluralism applies to evaluative standards just as it applies to\nreasons (Vallier 2011). That is to say, reasonable people can disagree\non their standards of inference and epistemic justification. For\ninstance, some might regard theological discourse as intelligible by\nholding that one can reason well with respect to Biblical exegesis.\nOthers may disagree, holding that most religions’ sacred texts are too\nindeterminate to effectively interpret. More abstractly, members of\nthe public may differ as to what constitutes a good cognitive process.\nThe intelligibility requirement is generous enough to recognize these\ndifferences but still puts some pressure on a purely empirical\napproach, especially in demanding that an individual’s reason for\nendorsing a principle must be justifiable as such according to her own\nstandards of justification. \nNot all intelligible reasons will, by that very fact, be eligible to\nfigure in a justification of some specific principle L. Some,\nfor example, while intelligible, are not relevant, or at least do not\nseem to be the sort of reason that should count towards the\njustification for a law. For example, suppose one favors a law making\ntennis part of school curriculum because one thinks tennis is good for my\nhealth, while recognizing that it is necessarily beneficial for the\nhealth of others. In this case, the reason may be intelligible but\nshould not figure in the public justification for a law.\nFurther, intelligible reasons may not be sufficient to justify a law\nin the sense specified in 2.1. Instead, intelligibility is an\nadditional requirement, apart from bare logical sufficiency, that\nrecognizes that, while A might not share reasons with others,\nthe reasons he has should, in some sense, be available to others to\nconsider and endorse as reasons at least for A (even if not for\nthem). Intelligibility is one interpretation of how this availability\nmight be demonstrated. \nThe accessibility requirement is more stringent than intelligibility.\nRather than requiring that a reason for A to accept L be\njustified according to A’s reasonable standards (even if these\nare not shared by others), accessibility requires that reasons be\njustified according to shared evaluative standards. (In particular,\nthat members of the public believe that RA justifies\nL for A according to common evaluative standards, not\nthat RA is accepted by A as justifying\nL.) While accessibility permits reasons to differ\n(A might and B might not endorse RA),\nit requires that they be evaluated as reasons according to\nevaluative standards that are shared. Thus, accessibility\nlies between intelligibility and shareability, which is considered\nnext, in section 2.4.3, because intelligibility permits differing\nreasons and evaluative standards, whereas shareability permits\nneither.  Accessibility is perhaps the most common standard in the\nliterature, with no less than eight available interpretations (Eberle\n2002, 252–286; for a recent defense, see Boettcher 2015). Define\naccessibility and the accessibility requirement as follows: \nAccessibility: A’s reason RA is\naccessible to the public if and only if all members of the public\nregard RA as justified for A according to common evaluative\nstandards \nAccessibility Requirement: A’s reason\nRA can figure in a justification for (or rejection\nof) a coercive law only if RA is accessible to all\nmembers of the public. \nShareability is the strongest of the three requirements, as it\ncombines the requirement of shared evaluative standards with the\nrequirement of shared reasons (Bowman and Richardson 2009; Hartley and Watson 2009; Watson and Hartley 2018). (This\nresults in a version of the familiar consensus interpretation of\npublic justification.) Public reason liberals often argue that reasons\nshould be shared but say little about what it means to share reasons.\nThey presumably hold that reasons must be shareable, meaning that\ncitizens will all have the reasons in question at the right level of\nidealization. \nThe shareability requirement, like intelligibility and accessibility,\npossesses two components—a requirement concerning the\nappropriate evaluative standards and a requirement concerning the\nrange of permitted reasons. Define shareability and the shareability\nrequirement as follows: \nShareability: A’s reason RA is\nshareable with the public if and only if members of the public regard\nRA as justified for each member of the public,\nincluding A, according to common standards. \nShareability Requirement: A’s reason\nRA can figure in a justification for (or rejection\nof) coercion only if RA is shared with all\n(suitably idealized) members of the public. \nIf shareability is imposed, then convergence approaches to public\njustification are, of course, ruled out. This is so because citizens’\npublic uses of reasons are restricted to shareable reasons (Some may\nclaim that any good reason is shared by members of the public at high\nlevels of idealization, where people would share their comprehensive\ndoctrines; this point bleeds into the matter of idealization, addressed below). \nIntelligibility, Accessibility, and Shareability are the three core\nrequirements on justificatory reasons on offer within the public\njustification literature. They can be grouped together in a\ndiagram: \nThe bottom left quadrant is left open because public reason liberals\nnever advocate shared reasons and unshared evaluative standards at the\nsame time. There are perhaps two reasons for this. First, it is\nusually thought that sharing evaluative standards is more common than\nsharing reasons, and so if reasons are shared, evaluative standards\nshould be too. Second, evaluative standards help to individuate and\ndistinguish between reasons, so it’s not clear we could determine\nwhich reasons are shared if evaluative standards are not shared. \nOnce the outer bounds of the public are set (see\n Section 2.5\n below), and we know which individuals have to have reason(s) for some\narrangement for that arrangement to be legitimate, public reason\nliberals need to specify how reasons are to be ascribed to the members\nof this group. Specifically, public reason liberals, unless they are\nempirical consent theorists, engage in idealization in order\nto understand how the beliefs, desires and values of citizens enter\ninto the process of public justification. Idealization is the practice\nof considering citizens’ beliefs, desires and values as they would be\ngiven good information and good reasoning. It is typically employed on\nthe grounds that an individual’s morally significant reasons may not\nbe the same as the reasons she actually affirms, which are frequently\nbased on poor information, poor reasoning or incoherent beliefs and\ndesires. Views that determine citizens’ reasons by their actual\ncommitments are typically described as forms of justificatory\n“populism” (Eberle 2002, 200). \nRawls’s primary model of idealization (1971, 118) is the veil of\nignorance which models parties as reasonable by withholding from their\ndeliberations information that would undermine their impartiality. (It\nis important to note that the veil device models reasonableness and\nthat the reasoning of the parties behind the veil models\n(instrumental) rationality.) Jürgen Habermas (1999, 198) prefers\ndeliberative conditions without such abstract idealization, instead\nfavoring constraining the form of discourse among actual individuals.\nDavid Gauthier (1986, 245) prefers a bargaining scenario where\nindividuals know the characteristics of persons but are unaware of\nwhich person they are. \nIdealization should be understood in terms of\ncitizens’ belief-value sets. A citizen’s belief-value set is the set\nof all her beliefs, desires, goals and plans, i.e., everything she\nthinks and wants. (This idea derives from Bernard Williams’s (1981,\n102) conception of a subjective motivational set.) A citizen is\nidealized when we consider her belief-value set as it might be altered\nby changing one or more of her beliefs, desires, goals and/or plans\naccording to some criteria. Theorists may imagine her having more or\ndifferent information or values or require that she be fully rational,\nboth of which will alter her belief-value set. And the appropriate\nlevel of idealization might vary with context depending of the\nepistemic quality of reasoning demanded by the situation (say between\nthe reasoning required to design institutions vs. planning a family\nvacation). \nTo motivate idealization, consider how public justification fares\nwithout idealization.\nPopulist views “take citizens as they are: the default populist\nposition is that a rationale R counts as a public justification only\nif the members of the public find R acceptable in light of their\nexisting [subjective motivational sets], irrespective of their\nepistemic pockmarks and doxastic defects” (Eberle 2002, 200).\nPopulist conceptions of idealization are widely regarded as subject to\nenormous problems, since people can “withhold their assent\nbecause of obstinacy, selfishness, laziness, perversity, or\nconfusion” (Gaus 1996, 121). Populism has the further problem of\nrequiring that we ask everyone about their reasons before deciding\nwhether a coercive law is justified.  \nPublic justification theorists typically radically idealize in\nresponse to the weaknesses of justificatory populism, that is, they\nalter belief-value sets to rid them of inconsistencies and ignorance.\nRadical idealization thus contains two primary\ndimensions—rationality and information—that are pushed to\ntheir upper-bound. \nThe distinction between theories of full rationality and\nless-than-full rationality is central to the project of idealization,\nthough, as will emerge, full rationality is elusive. To attribute\nreasons to citizens on the basis of poor reasoning would arguably\ncorrupt the process of public justification. A theory of full\nrationality idealizes agents by giving parties flawless cognitive\npowers. (See Rawls (1971, 12) and Gauthier (1986, 234) for explicit\nattributions of full rationality to their agents.) \nThe assumption of full rationality initially seems irresistible. If we\ncan discern the reasons citizens would affirm were they perfectly\nrational, then surely those would be the morally relevant reasons of\ncitizens. The public reason liberal wants to justify demands\nand coercion for all rational beings in her society. How could she do\nbetter than full rationality? Another motivation for embracing full\nrationality is to generate agreement; many public reason liberals\ntacitly assume that when suitably idealized, rational and reasonable\nindividuals will agree about many things they otherwise would not. For\ninstance, in order to induce agreement, Rawls assumes that parties to\nthe original position are fully rational. Were they less than fully\nrational, the parties might reach different conclusions. \nBut problems with full rationality abound. First of all, the notion of\nfull rationality is incoherent when applied to finite and fallible\nbeings (see Cherniak 1986); it requires adjustments to a dense web of\nbeliefs and values that are not computable in real time and given\nlimited resources. Secondly, the notion of full rationality, were it\ncoherent, would leave us with justifications of arrangements that\ncould not be reflexively endorsed by the individuals whose behavior\nthey govern, so different are these individuals’ actual beliefs and\nvalues from those which provide the reasons justifying the\narrangements. (This is one way in which the problem of stability might\narise. See below 5.2.) \nAgain, public reason liberals add information to the belief-value set\nof ordinary citizens (and, indeed, remove misinformation) in order to\navoid holding public justification captive to ignorance. Rawls,\nGauthier and Habermas all pursue this strategy. Their models take for\ngranted that idealized agents possess all (and only) the general facts\nrequired to determine what reasons they have. In general, then, public\nreason liberals remove beliefs and desires that interfere with the\nindividual’s ability to adopt an impartial perspective and to add such\ngeneral and specific information as is necessary for her to reason\nwell about the issues before her. Public reason liberals disagree\nabout what sets of information interfere with impartiality, but all\ntheorists subtract misinformation and biasing information. \nPublic reason liberals are only beginning to take criticisms of\nradical idealization seriously. (See Gaus 2011, 232–260 and\nVallier 2014, 145–180.) If these criticisms are successful, then\none might reconsider returning to justificatory populism. However,\nthere may be a third option: moderate idealization, where one\nattributes to citizens reasons based on some reasonable standard of\nadequate information and reasoning that nonetheless falls short of\nfull information and perfect reasoning. The moderate idealization\ntheorist can insist that we can go too far in separating idealized\nbelief-value sets from the dingy, real-world belief-value sets of\ncitizens, eventually arriving at a point where the tie is severed and\nindeed, as Wolterstorff insists (2007, 153), the person being\nidealized has no reason to care about his counterpart’s\nrecommendations (also see Enoch 2013, 164–170; for a reply, see\nGaus 2015). The pull toward radical idealization must be balanced\nshowing respect for citizens as they actually are (this latter element\nwill be crucial for maintaining stability; see 5.2.) While radical\nidealization may test the “strains of commitment” (Rawls\n1971, 155–9), some moderate idealization is acceptable to most\nordinary citizens as an appropriate acknowledgment of the demands of\nthe impartial perspective. \nWhen public reason liberals idealize, they circumscribe the set of\nreasons to a set that can be recognized from a particular point of\nview as legitimately playing a role in public justification. This\ncircumscription also occurs in “normative” conceptions of\nidealization that represent members of the public as being\nreasonable. In one way, reasonableness may seem to be a redundant\ncategory since figures like Rawls, Gauthier, and Habermas model\nreasonableness largely in terms of the information dimension by\nconsidering members of the public as deprived of partializing\ninformation that might lead them to select unfair principles. But\nreasonableness is not redundant, for it attributes cognitive\ndispositions to agents that are not explicitly captured by\nidealization over beliefs, desires, and values. Note that\nRawls’s conception of the reasonable plays two roles in his\ntheory of justice. First, reasonableness is modeled by the veil of\nignorance, but a citizen of the well-ordered society is also\nreasonable because she possesses the following four dispositions\n(Rawls 2005, 49–52, 53–58, 60, 76, 119, 162–3,\n229). (1) A disposition to engage in public justification, or to offer\njustifications for her own preferred principles and abide by the\njustified principles proposed by others. (2) A disposition to\nrecognize the “burdens of judgment” which imply reasonable\npluralism. (3) A disposition to reject the repression of other\nreasonable points of view. (4) A disposition to rely on methods of\nreasoning that others can share or access. \nThe scope of the public determines which persons are idealized, not\nhow the idealization should proceed. By and large, public\njustification theorists consider the public to include all members of\na traditional nation-state. This is largely due to the need to\nsimplify but also due to what some have called an implicit nationalism\nabout public reason liberalism. For instance, Rawls is well-known for\nhaving confined his theory of justice to members of a nation to which\nno one could be added or subtracted, though he later developed an\naccount of public justification for global matters (2002). \nThis matter is left to debates about nationalism and cosmopolitanism\n(see the entries on\n nationalism\n and\n cosmopolitanism). \nThere is also some controversy concerning whether future generations\nshould be parties to public justification and if so how they should be\nbuilt into the relevant deliberative model (see the entry on\n intergenerational justice).\n Similarly, some public justification theorists, such as Gauthier,\nhave confined public justification to those who contribute to the\ncooperative surplus, though others have thought that the ideal of\npublic justification applies to all citizens, regardless of their\ncontributions. \nThe final dimension relevant to specifying the PJP is the structure of\njustificatory argumentation. The variation among conceptions of\nargumentation within public reason liberalism can be sorted into four\ngroups: discursive, universalizing, bargaining, and evolutionary.\nDiscursive theories hold public justification is achieved when an\nagreement has been reached among the relevant class of public\ndiscussants, whereas universalizing approaches hold that public\njustification has been achieved when we have located a set of moral\nrules or principles that can be seen as reflecting fair and reciprocal\nrelations among persons. Bargaining theories hold that public\njustification is achieved when individual interests are advanced as\nfar as possible. Evolutionary approaches are the most distinctive, and\nthey mark the distinction between public reason theorists and the more\ngeneral notion of public justification most vividly. According to\nevolutionists, a coercive principle L is justified for members\nof a public P when that principle is a stable and evolved equilibrium\nfor P. These four theories each have a prominent representative. In\norder they are Jürgen Habermas, John Rawls, David Gauthier and\nGerald Gaus. \nDiscursive theories, broadly speaking, hold that the aim of public\njustification is to generate agreement and resolution among disputants\nthrough the process of real discourse secured by just and fair social\ninstitutions. They come in different forms, primarily either\nHabermasian or pragmatist theories, such as those of Robert Talisse\n(2005) and Cheryl Misak (2000). For our purposes, the key features of\nthe discursive view can be examined by briefly reviewing Habermas’s\ntheory, as he is the most prominent discourse theorist (see the entry\non\n Jürgen Habermas). \nHabermas holds (1999, 68) that “the justification of norms and\ncommands requires that a real discourse be carried out.” The\nonly way to achieve public justification is through free argumentation\nthat convinces citizens to recognize the claims others make on them.\nFor A to make a legitimate claim on B, the claim must be\nsubmitted to B’s critique. \nFor Habermas, one point of a discourse-focused conception of practical\nreason is that an individual’s conception of her interests and\ncommitments is formed in the discursive process. He often refers to\nthis process as “will formation” where individual opinions\ncan change and ultimately produce a rational consensus. He idealizes\nin this way in order to develop a conception of the reasonable where\ncitizens take up a discursive, moral point of view aimed at a rational\nconsensus concerning the interests of all. (For details concerning how\nidealized discourse proceeds, see Habermas 1999, 65–6.) \nUniversalizing views hold that the point of public justification is to\narrive at a regime that fairly advances the interests of all as seen\nfrom those individuals’ perspectives. The universalizing conception\nsuggests a discourse among parties in search of an ideal that each can\nendorse as a public ideal for the community of which they are members.\nRawls is the exemplar of such a view. For Rawls, the aim of a theory\nof justice is to provide a justification for the claims that citizens\nmake on one another’s conduct. Rawls realizes, however, that gaining\ntraction on the problem of justification is difficult, and responds by\nconverting it into a social choice problem: “the question of\njustification [can be] settled by working out a problem of\ndeliberation” (Rawls 1971, 16). Principles of justice are\njustified if they are selected by all parties to a properly specified\nchoice situation, which Rawls argues will lead them to select\nprinciples of justice that will apply to all persons. \nThe bargaining conception of public justification holds that a regime\nis legitimate for an individual because it maximally advances her\ninterests. The bargaining conception suggests a negotiation among\nparties in search of a stable equilibrium of opposed forces; that is,\neach has been assigned, by a regime, as much as she can be assigned\nconsistent with the need to assign enough to every other party to\nsecure their compliance. The most prominent example of a bargaining\ntheory is David Gauthier’s contractarianism. In Morals by\nAgreement, he argues that citizens require a social morality in\norder to secure the benefits of social cooperation. But for Gauthier,\nunlike Rawls, moral and political norms are justified by showing that\ninstrumental rationality requires that persons embrace a scheme of\nsocial rules. Individuals, “faced with the costs of natural or\nmarket interaction in the face of externalities agree to a different,\ncooperative mode of interaction”; rational individuals do so in\norder to “maximize their own utility” (Gauthier 1986,\n145–6). Gauthier’s main concern is to show why anyone should\naccept the restraints morality places on individual behavior. His\nproposal, in short, is to show that even a very thin notion of\nrationality—instrumental rationality—can justify moral\nconstraints to all. A citizen can properly be subject to state\ncoercion in certain respects, on this account, because it is in his\ninterests that he be so. It is important to stress that Gauthier does\nnot base the public justification of a rule or law on the aggregate\nutility it will produce across persons. Instead, bargains are reached\nwhen each person provides the minimum relative concession of rents\nneeded to get a bargain off the ground. To put it roughly, publicly\njustified rules are those that maximize the share of each person\nrelative to and constrained by a similar maximization of shares on the\npart of others. Each side seeks the best bargain they can get. \nEvolutionary views of public justification, such as those advanced by\nBryan Skyrms (1996) and Gerald Gaus (2011) are late-comers to public\nreason liberalism. The reason for this is that they are partly\nreactions to the perceived failures of the other three, more familiar\napproaches to public justification. In light of these failures, Gaus\nargues that parties to the process of public justification must be\nunderstood as intrinsically rule-following in ways that sometimes\nfrustrates their own goals, rejecting the bargaining view, and that\nthe parties acknowledge that discourse will not resolve their\ndisagreements, rejecting the discursive view. Gaus also argues that\nparties to a universalizing form of justification will find themselves\nwith multiple eligible social arrangements, which shows that the\nuniversalization procedure itself is insufficient to produce a\ndeterminate set of justified social arrangements. It is here that Gaus\nappeals to social evolutionary processes in order to produce\njustification. Gaus argues that evolutionary forces can select a\nmember of the eligible set of social arrangements for implementation\nbecause each party will recognize there is no other way to secure the\nbenefits of social cooperation. Thus, public reason is mixed with a\nsociological thesis about the ability of spontaneous order processes\nto generate convergence on a single member of an (optimal) eligible\nset. No one person foresees or constructs the actually justified set\nof moral principles or rules, but all have reason to accept the\noutcome of such a process. Typically public justification is said to concern the use of\npolitical coercion, either regarding matters of constitutional\nessentials and basic justice (Rawls 2005) or coercive law as well\n(Gaus 2011, Quong 2011). However, in recent years, a number of\ntheorists have argued that coercion does not always require public\njustification. Gaus (2011) and Chad Van Schoelandt (2015) have argued\nthat public justification is aimed, primarily, at the justification of\nrelations of moral authority, that is, of our capacity to issue\ngenuinely binding moral demands of others. We have to justify our\ndemands that others follow shared moral rules that are not coercive,\nsuch as rules requiring that we keep our promises. Colin Bird (2014)\nhas argued that the foundation for public justification is grounded in\nthe standing that democratic citizens have as co-authors of\nlegislation. On Bird’s view, we may have to justify non-coercive\nlegislation if it affects the standing of citizens, such as\ncommunicative legislation that, say, defines an optionally sworn\nnational pledge of allegiance. \nOne concern about defenses of the PJP is that the PJP only specifies\nhow coercion is justified. It does not include in its content any\nfurther normative principle about why coercion is undesirable or about\nhow coercion is to be handled if it is not publicly justified. For\ninstance, one might combine the PJP with a consequentialist norm that\nunjustified coercion is to be minimized or a deontological principle\nthat morality requires not engaging in unjustified coercion. Again the\nPJP is silent on these matters. \nHowever, a number of public justification theorists and others in the\nliberal tradition have worked out a version of this additional norm\ncalled the Liberty Principle. The Liberty Principle takes the form of\na presumption in favor of liberty or against coercion. Stanley Benn\n(1988, 87) defends a presumption against interference in politics and\nmorality, claiming that “the burden of justification falls on\nthe interferer, not on the person interfered with.” Joel\nFeinberg (1987, 9) is another prominent defender of the\n“presumption in favor of liberty” which he defines as\nfollows: “liberty should be the norm, coercion always needs some\nspecial justification.” While Benn is concerned with\ninterference and Feinberg with coercion, the presumption is quite\nsimilar. Rawls (2001, 44) endorses a presumption against legal\ncoercion. He also appears to endorse a presumption in favor of liberty\nin his liberal principle of legitimacy: “Our exercise of\npolitical power is proper only when we sincerely believe that the\nreasons we offer for our political action may reasonably be accepted\nby other citizens as a justification of those actions” (Rawls\n2005, xlvi). Rawls does not use the phrase “coercion” in\nthis formulation, but for Rawls, “political power is always\ncoercive power” (68). And on his view, the question of public\njustification for citizens is this: “When may citizens by their\nvote properly exercise their coercive political power over one another\nwhen fundamental questions are at stake?” (217). Given that\npolitical power is coercive power, we can understand Rawls as\nendorsing a presumption against the use of coercion. \nWhen conjoined with the PJP, the Liberty Principle explains how the\nPJP can be applied to the justification of laws. Since there is a\npresumption against coercive law, the PJP, when satisfied, overcomes\nthe presumption. \nIn recent years, the number of different normative foundations for the\nPublic Justification Principle has increased. Typically public\njustification has been grounded in (i) respect for persons as free and\nequal (Larmore 2008; for criticism, see Eberle 2002, Gaus 2011 and Van\nSchoelandt 2015), but we also find attempts to ground the PJP in (ii)\nan analysis of the nature of rationality and morality (Habermas 1996),\n(iii) the requirements of justice (Rawls 2005; Quong 2013), (iv) the\nvalue of civic friendship (Lister 2013; Ebels-Duggan 2010; Leland and\nWietmarschen 2017; for criticism, see Billingham 2016), (v) the\navoidance of authoritarianism and the preservation of moral relations\nbetween persons (Gaus 2011; for criticism, see Enoch 2013). For\npurposes of space, however, we omit a discussion of these foundations\nhere, as it largely recapitulates the discussion in the entry on \npublic reason. \nA related foundational question concerns precisely to whom public\njustification is owed. Quong (2011, 137–160) has argued that\npublic justification is owed exclusively to an idealized constituency\nof reasonable people, whereas Gaus (2011, 232–268) has argued\nthat public justification is owed to real persons whose justificatory\nreasons are determined by what their moderately idealized counterparts\naccept as their reasons. Quong calls his view the “internal\nconception” and contrasts it with an “external conception” which\ndirects public justification to real persons as they are, but the only\ndeveloped alternative in the contemporary literature, the Gausian\nmodel, also appeals to idealization while directing public\njustification to real persons. The internal conception has been\nsubject to a number of recent criticisms (Gaus 2012, Billingham 2017a,\nVallier 2017), as has the Gausian approach (Enoch 2013, Quong\n2014) \nDifferent decisions about those to whom public justification is owed,\nhowever, traces to a deeper question about what the point of public\njustification is. For Quong and other defenders of the internal\nconception (Hartley and Watson 2018), the point of public\njustification is to render consistent some of our most fundamental\npolitical ideas, like the idea of society as a system of cooperation\nand a political conception of the person. Others following Gaus, like\nVallier (2014), think the point of public justification is to\nestablish some kind of respectful, equal, moral relations between real\npersons. \nThe PJP is tied to two important concepts within political theory: the\nideas of publicity and stability. In some cases, public reason\nliberals understand public justification in terms of the capacity of\nlaws to achieve both stability and publicity, whereas in other cases\nthey see the ability of their conception of public justification to\nachieve publicity and/or stability as a merit of their conception over\ncompetitors. For instance, if a conception of the PJP is incompatible\nwith a plausible principle of publicity or will fail to produce the\nright sort of stability, then that counts against the conception. Now\nit is true that many considerations can count against interpretations\nof the PJP other than problems with publicity or stability. But\nbecause public justification theorists see the concepts of publicity\nand stability as so central to fleshing out a conception of public\njustification, it seems appropriate to treat these connections\nhere. \nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls claims that “public\njustification” occurs when a well-ordered society achieves what\nhe calls “full publicity” which contains or consists of\nthree levels (see the entry on\n publicity).\n The first level “is achieved when society is effectively\nregulated by public principles of justice: citizens accept and know\nthat others likewise accept those principles, and this in turn is\npublicly recognized” (Rawls 2005, 66). At the first level, each\nperson grasps that a society’s basic structure is justified in terms\nof commonly accepted practices of inquiry and reasoning. The second\nlevel of publicity requires that citizens of a well-ordered society\nhave shared beliefs “in the light of which first principles of\njustice themselves can be accepted, that is, the general beliefs about\nhuman nature and the way political social institutions generally work,\nand indeed all such beliefs relevant to political justice” (67).\nThe third level of publicity concerns what Rawls calls “the full\njustification of the public conception of justice as it would be\npresented in its own terms” and must include all of the\nconsiderations we bring to the table when generating a conception of\njustice in the first place. The full justification must be\n“publicly known, or better, at least to be publicly\navailable.” \nFull publicity is achieved when all three levels of publicity obtain.\nAnd when full publicity is achieved, Rawls says that a political\nconception of justice is publicly justified. Public reason liberals\ngenerally hold that a law is public under a number of conditions, say\nwhen citizens know that each person has some reason to endorse their\nsociety’s laws, or when each person accepts the laws for reasons that\nare publicly available. \nImportantly, full publicity comprises “public\njustification,” which is Rawls’s third stage of the\njustification of the political conception generally. The first two\nstages of justifying the political conception are the pro\ntanto and full justification stages, which occur only\nwhen citizens both construct a political conception of justice from\nshared considered judgments (the pro tanto stage) and accept\nthe political conception from within their comprehensive doctrines\n(the full justification stage). Public justification occurs when each\nperson knows that the political conception is fully justified (in the\nsecond stage’s sense) (Rawls 2005, 386–7). For Rawls (2005,\n387), “public justification happens when all the reasonable\nmembers of political society carry out a justification of the shared\npolitical conception by embedding it in their several reasonable\ncomprehensive views.” Thus, public justification is understood\nin terms of publicity. \nCharles Larmore (2008, 203–7) traces Rawls’s idea of public\nreason as arising from his concerns about publicity and in his recent\nstudy of Rawls’s Political Liberalism, Paul Weithman (2011,\n242) shows that publicity helps to educate a society about the basis\nof its political views that is crucial for maintaining a society as\nstable for the right reasons. \nRawls’s notion of publicity is the most common in the literature; Gaus\n(2011, 296–7) offers a less demanding standard of “weak” publicity. \nWhile Rawls uses the term “public justification” to refer\nto the process of making an overlapping consensus public, in this\nentry the term is used to refer to the broader process of ensuring\nthat all uses of coercive power are justified for each person given\ntheir reasons. Thus, publicity may be conceived of as a part of public\njustification but is not the primary goal that the public\njustification of coercion is meant to achieve. The PJP does not\nrequire that public justifications achieve publicity in order for\ncoercion to be compatible with respect for persons. Nonetheless,\npublicity is a “sister concept” to the idea of public\njustification because it realizes the ideal of public\njustification. \nThe idea of publicity is frequently understood in terms of the\npublicity of shared reasons (see Rawls 2002, 173 for a connection\nbetween shared reasons and publicity). One reason for adopting a\nconsensus conception of reasons might be that it aids the public\nrecognition of what is publicly justified because public justification\nappeals primarily to reasons that are shared (Hadfield & Macedo\n2012; Watson and Hartley 2018). However, any public justification view (including convergence\nviews) should appeal to some notion of publicity, since while public\njustification can, on some views, occur without public recognition,\nmany make the public recognition of justification to all a\nconstitutive condition of a polity’s coercive laws being fully\npublicly justified in the broad sense of the term employed in this\nentry. This is, in fact, the relevance of the ideas of intelligibility\nand accessibility which was discussed earlier. \nAnother sister concept to the ideal of public justification is the\nnotion of the stability. Many public reason liberals think it crucial\nto public justification that publicly justified principles be stable\nin some sense. For Rawls (2005, 140–143), public justification\nhelps a political conception of justice to be “stable for the\nright reasons.” Weithman (2011) has argued that the central\nmotivation for Rawls’s development of the ideas of public reason and\npublic justification was to ensure that the justification of political\nprinciples could be stable in a society that faces the fact of\nreasonable pluralism. In some ways, then, the search for stability is\npart of the motivation for caring about public justification as such. A\nsociety can only be stable for the right reasons when the use of\ncoercive power within that society is justified to each person based\non reasons they could recognize and endorse. Otherwise, a society is\nstable merely because of the use of power within it. Some public\njustification theorists see a looser connection between stability and\npublic justification. Whether a norm or principle can be stable is\nsimply a good-making feature of that norm or principle\nvis-à-vis others (Rawls sometimes talks this way in\nTheory). Stability can also be seen as a merit of a\nparticular conception of public justification over others. For\ninstance, if a convergence conception of reasons would facilitate the\npublic justification of laws in ways that would in turn promote\nstability, then that may be one reason to prefer it to a consensus\nconception of reasons. \nRawls’s focus on stability raises another complex issue in\ndebates about the nature of public justification. The present entry\nhas already distinguished between idealizing persons as reasonable or\nnot (2.4.3).  Some conceptions of idealization attribute reasons to\ncitizens based on what they actually endorse and others attribute\nreasons to citizens based on what they would reasonably\nendorse. Stability is sometimes moralized to mean that stability is\nonly of the valuable sort when it is based on “the right\nreasons” or what reasonable citizens would endorse. Rawls\nexemplifies this view but also resists a merely prescriptive form of\nstability; that is, he does not want a society to be stable based on\nwhat should render it stable. Instead, while Rawls wants a society to\nbe stable for the right reasons, the idea of stability has content\nindependent of its normative status of being based on the right\nconsiderations. A society can be unstable even if its institutions are\nbased on good reasons. So the idea of stability seems tied to both a\nprescriptive ideal of public justification and a descriptive ideal of\nactual stability for the right reasons. Thus the ideal of public\njustification itself has both a prescriptive and a descriptive\nelement. Public justification theorists want public justification to\nbe actually achieved and to be based on good reasons. Gaus has\ncriticized Rawls (1996, 130–136) for having an excessively\npopulist or actualist conception of stability and has developed his\nown conception of stability for the right reasons (2011,\n389–408). In general, public justification theorists all feel\nthe pull of the normative and the descriptive, though some are more\ninclined toward a purely normative interpretation (Quong 2011) and\nothers toward a more descriptive interpretation (arguably Rawls\n2005). \nIn recent years, especially following Weithman (2011), philosophers\nhave started to explore the mechanisms by which a well-ordered society\ncan become stable for the right reasons. Weithman argues that\nstability for the right reasons is generated by the use of public\nreasons; in fact, Weithman argues that this was Rawls’s view. Kevin\nVallier and John Thrasher (2015) have argued that public reasons are\ninadequate assurance mechanisms due to problems associated with cheap\ntalk and bad information that will be present even in a well-ordered\nsociety. Brian Kogelmann and Steven H. W. Stich (2016) have argued\nthat convergence discourse, through allowing persons to use diverse\nreasons as signals, can help to generate stability. \nThe ideal of public justification has many critics whose concerns are\noften quite deep. Since the purpose of this entry is to explain the\nideal, it simply offers a comprehensive list of criticisms with brief\nexplanations. Some members of the list are drawn from a shorter list\nconstructed by Jonathan Quong (2011, 259–60). In general, the\nobjections are indexed to the conceptions of public justification to\nwhich they apply. In the absence of such statement, the objection is\ntaken to apply to all versions discussed in the entry. \nMany critics of the ideal of public justification argue that it cannot\naddress a number of important issues due to its restrictions on\npermissible reasoning in public life (De Marneffe 1994, Reidy 2000;\nSchwartzman 2004). This objection is typically lodged at the\nstandard, consensus view as the consensus view restricts the set of\njustificatory reasons to the subset of shareable or accessible\nreasons. There will be many issues on which citizens have little\ncommon ground and thus should be able to appeal to private\nconsiderations. Notice that the convergence view renders this\nobjection less pressing. \nSome public reason liberals are criticized for developing conceptions\nof justice that are highly indeterminate. Instead of generating clear\nsolutions to political problems, these critics claim, public reason\nliberals cannot use the ideal of public justification to make\ndeterminate recommendations. The most well-known version of the\nobjection is pressed by Gaus (2011) against more standard Rawlsian\nconceptions of public justification. Gaus argues that we must appeal\nto real social processes and evolutionary mechanisms to resolve the\nproblem (see above 2.7.4). This objection is related to a\n“normalization” objection which holds that public reason\nliberalism avoids indeterminacy only by building implausible\ntheoretical assumptions into their models (D’Agostino 2003). \nDeliberative democrats have sometimes criticized Rawlsian versions of\npublic reason on the grounds that they “fix” the content\nof, say, principles of justice, in advance of real deliberation.\nHabermas famously (1995, 127–8) lodged this criticism against\nRawls. But notice that on our broad conception of public\njustification, this objection is merely an objection to the Rawlsian\nform of public justification vis-à-vis a more deliberative\nconception. \nThe integrity objection holds that public justification imposes\nexcessive burdens on people of faith because it restricts the use of\nunshared, comprehensive reasons, frequently religious reasons. The\nargument here is that persons of faith have no reason to accept the\nconstraints that public reason liberals would impose upon them (Eberle\n2002, Wolterstorff 1997, Vallier 2012). The integrity objection is\noften tied to a fairness objection, which holds that public reason\nliberalism treats religious reasons and secular reasons unequally,\ngiving arbitrary and unjustified preference to secular reasons (Perry\n1993, Wolterstorff 1997). Note that the convergence view provokes this\nobjection less forcefully, as it allows appeal to religious reasons\n(Eberle 2012), though convergence is thought to have its own problems\n(see below). This objection is also related to what Patrick Neal\n(2009) calls the “Denial of Truth” objection which\ncomplains that citizens subject to the ideal of public justification\ncannot in their political lives appeal to the whole truth as they see\nit. Andrew March (2013) offers a useful taxonomy of religiously-based\narguments, and motivates the view that restricting some such arguments\ncan be overly burdensome, but restricting others can be justified. \nStill other critics claim that public justification is too burdensome\nbecause it implies an unrealistic and excessively high-minded view of\ndemocratic politics due to how it restricts public discourse. Real\npolitics requires the use of private reasons in cases of\ncoalition-building and forging compromise (Shapiro 1999). This\nobjection is related to the integrity objection because of its focus\non public reason’s burdensomeness. However, it is focused more on\nwhether public reason is realistic, not whether it is unfair or\nburdensome. The antidiscourse objection is aimed primarily at\ndiscursive interpretations of the idea of practical reasoning in the\nPJP. \nSome critics argue that the ideal of public justification privileges\nlogical, calm, dispassionate forms of discourse that are uncommon\namong minority groups. (It is a matter of controversy who these\nminority groups are.) The objections here tend to mirror those of the\nintegrity objection, though they apply to different social groups\n(Sanders 1997, Young 2000). Those who advance this criticism are most\nconcerned about the standard, Rawlsian interpretations of the PJP. \nPublic reason liberals often appeal to the sometimes controversial\nidea of reasonableness when delineating the relevant members of the\npublic, which some critics find objectionable because it is\ninegalitarian (Bohman 2003, Friedman 2000). This objection \nfocuses on Rawlsian interpretations of PJP. \nPublic reason liberalism acquires much of its intuitiveness from\npointing out that reasonable people disagree about their conceptions\nof the good and then use this fact to help generate a common\nconception of justice. But critics argue that public reason liberalism\ndenies reasonable pluralism about justice, and thus prefers agreement\nabout rightness over agreement about goodness. They thereby point to an\nasymmetry. (For discussion and rebuttal, see Quong 2011,\n192–220.) This objection can be taken to apply to a wide range\nof interpretations of the PJP. However, it does not apply to some\nconvergence views, as convergence theorists typically accept justice\npluralism (Gaus 2011, 276–279). \nThe PJP holds that all coercive actions or laws must be justified to\neach member of the public. But critics ask whether this treatment\napplies to the PJP itself. If it applies, then given that reasonable\npeople disagree about the PJP, the PJP is self-refuting. If the PJP\nneed not be publicly justified, then it looks as if public reason\nliberals are arbitrarily privileging their own principle (Wall 2002;\nChristiano 2010, 206–213; Estlund 2008; Wall 2013; Enoch 2013,\n170–173). Some public reason liberals respond by trying to show\nthat their version of the PJP can satisfy itself (Estlund 2008),\nwhereas other public reason liberals attempt to show that the PJP is\nnot arbitrarily excluded from the process of public justification\n(Gaus 2011; Vallier 2016a). This objection can be leveled against\nalmost any interpretation of the PJP. (For an additional recent\ndiscussion, see Billingham 2017b.)  \nLiberal perfectionists criticize public reason liberalisms on the\ngrounds that they prevent states from promoting the good and\nflourishing of citizens. The forms of “neutrality” and\n“restraint” the PJP entails cannot be justified (Wall\n1998, Chan 2000), though perfectionists substantiate this objection in\nmany distinct ways. For some prominent replies, see Quong\n2011. Perfectionists typically reject the PJP itself, not merely some\ninterpretations of it. \nA general objection to the PJP is that it provides too many defeater\nreasons for proposed laws, though such an objection is sometimes\nleveled specifically at convergence views (Eberle 2012). When the\ndiversity of citizens’ reasons is brought to bear on the process of\npublic justification, it may turn out that very few proposals can be\npublicly justified, so few that intuitively legitimate political\norders could not permissibly engage in the forms of coercion required\nto maintain even a society’s basic structure. Public reason liberals\nlike Rawls admit that a society may have a basic structure that cannot\nbe publicly justified (Rawls 2005, pp, also see D’Agostino 1996), and\nthey admit that it takes a certain degree of social development to\nreach a publicly justified polity (Rawls 2005). One might reply that\npersons’ interest in having shared moral and political norms excludes\na priori the possibility of an empty “eligible set” of\njustified proposals. But the most prominent arguments against the\ndebilitating presence of empty sets are sociological, arguing that our\nshared ideas and practices make empty sets unlikely. Both Rawls and\nGaus give various sociological arguments to suspect that the set is\nnot empty (Rawls 2002, 124–128, Gaus 2011, 303–333,\n389–408, 424–447). One strategy for resolving the empty\nset objection is to provide a ranking of eligible laws or proposals in\naccord with what members of the public have reason to accept or\nreject. Given citizens’ interest in having at least some laws to\ngenerate public order, empty set problems may be manageable. Thus\ncitizens have reason to accept non-optimal proposals so long as they\nare not defeated. \nThis objection is directed at convergence views. Quong has argued that\nby permitting private reasons into the process of public\njustification, convergence liberals permit citizens to be insincere\nwith one another since those citizens can offer reasons to others that\nthey do not think are good reasons (Quong 2011). This ignores the\ncomplexity which is introduced when we distinguish between shared\nreasons and shared standards. Certainly, there is no insincerity\nin A’s saying that, according to shared standards, it is\nappropriate that B has a reason R and that R is a reason to endorse\nsome arrangement even though A herself does not have this reason.  \nIt also appears to rule out reasoning by conjecture (Rawls 2002,\nSchwartzman 2012), where persons can appeal to the reasons of other\ncomprehensive doctrines in certain cases. That said, there are\nnonetheless good reasons to adopt sincerity requirements (Schwartzman\n2011). \nFred D’Agostino (1996) has argued at length that the PJP admits of\nmany variants (we have characterized these variants in terms of\ndifferent values for the variables in the PJP). While there are\nreasons to favor different variants of the PJP, there will be many\ndifferent desiderata for any adequate interpretation of the PJP. To\ngive one example, public justification seeks some distance from\npeople’s actual reasons, in search of genuine justification rather\nthan specious rationalization. On the other hand, public justificatory\narguments are meant to have an impact on the individuals whom they\ntarget and, in particular, to give them motives as well as reasons for\nconformity to the demands they are subject to (Macedo 1990 makes these\npoints especially forcefully). Unfortunately, there is prima facie\nincompatibility between these dual demands. To the extent that a given\ncourse of reasoning satisfies the demands for normative distance, to\nthat extent is it likely to fail to meet the demands for motivational\nimpact. \nOrdinarily, the fact that a principle admits of differing conceptions\nwhich we must weigh along a number of dimensions is not a problem.\nEven if no one conception is superior on all relevant dimensions, we\nmay still be able to select a variant based on all things considered\njudgments. But D’Agostino worries that theorists lack the conceptual\nresources to generate a weighing algorithm to ground these all things\nconsidered judgments. \nPublic reason liberals, again, feel powerful pressure to idealize\nmembers of the public, but some critics of public reason worry that\nthere is no way to idealize in a non-arbitrary fashion. Eberle (2002)\nhas argued that any idealization will tend to reflect the biases and\nvalues of the theorists who engage in the idealization. Thus, public\nreason liberals often end up excluding religious reasons from their\nidealization in ways that the critics find arbitrary. Any version of\nthe PJP that appeals to idealization is subject to this objection. \nDavid Enoch (2013) has recently argued that Gaus’s attempt to use\nmoderate idealization to show that the moral demands licensed by\npublicly justified social-moral rules does not reduce the threat of\nauthoritarianism. Nicholas Wolterstorff (2007) has argued that\ncoercing someone based on an idealization is disrespectful and\npatronizing. \nThe idea of public justification is often applied in order to make\nprogress on a number of important applied questions, in particular on\nissues surrounding the role of religion in liberal democratic\npolitics, feminism, and marriage policy. \nOn the expansive religion in politics literature see the entry on\nreligion and political theory and\nrecent literature reviews in March 2013, Vallier\n2014, and Bailey and Gentile 2014. \nOn feminist issues in public reason, see Okin 1994, Rawls 2002,\nNussbaum 2003, Baehr 2008, Hartley and Watson 2009, Hartley and Watson\n2010, Neufeld and Van Schoelandt 2014, and Watson and Hartley 2018. \nConcerning how public justification applies to marriage policy, see\nBrake 2010, Macedo 2015, and Chambers 2017.","contact.mail":"kevinvallier@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
