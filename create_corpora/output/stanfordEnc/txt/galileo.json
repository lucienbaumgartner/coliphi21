His work in physics or natural philosophy,\nastronomy, and the methodology of science still evoke debate after\nover 400 years.  His role in promoting the Copernican theory and his\ntravails and trials with the Roman Church are stories that still\nrequire re-telling. This article attempts to provide an overview of\nthese aspects of Galileo’s life and work, but does so by focusing in a\nnew way on his arguments concerning the nature of matter. \n\n\n\nGalileo was born on February 15, 1564 in Pisa. By the time he died on\nJanuary 8, 1642 (but see problems with the date, Machamer 1998, pp. \n24–5) he was as famous as any person in Europe. Moreover, when \nhe was born there was no such thing as ‘science’, yet by \nthe time he died science was well on its way to becoming a discipline\nand its concepts and method a whole philosophical system. \n\nGalileo and his family moved to Florence in 1572. He started to study\nfor the priesthood, but left and enrolled for a medical degree at the \nUniversity of Pisa. He never completed this degree, but instead \nstudied mathematics notably with Ostilio Ricci, the mathematician of \nthe Tuscan court. Later he visited the mathematician Christopher \nClavius in Rome and started a correspondence with Guildobaldo del \nMonte. He applied and was turned down for a position in Bologna, but \na few years later in 1589, with the help of Clavius and del Monte, he\nwas appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. \n\nIn 1592 he was appointed, at a much higher salary, to the position of\nmathematician at the University of Padua. While in Padua he met \nMarina Gamba, and in 1600 their daughter Virginia was born. In 1601 \nthey had another daughter Livia, and in 1606 a son Vincenzo. \n\nIt was during his Paduan period that Galileo worked out much of his \nmechanics and began his work with the telescope. In 1610 he published\nThe Starry Messenger, and soon after accepted a position as\nMathematician,a non-teaching post at University of Pisa and\nPhilosopher to the Grand Duke of Tuscany.  A facsimile copy of The\nLibrary of Congress’ manuscript of The Starry Messenger and a\nsymposium discussing details about the manuscript, may be found in\nHessler and DeSimone 2013. Galileo had lobbied hard for this position\nat the Medici court and even named the moons of Jupiter, which he\ndiscovered, after the Medici.  There were many reasons hewanted\nmove, but he says he did not like the wine in the Venice area and he\nhad to teach too many students. Late in 1610, the Collegio Romano in\nRome, where Clavius taught, certified the results of Galileo’s\ntelescopic observations. In 1611 he became a member of what is perhaps\nthe first scientific society, the Academia dei Lincei. \n\nIn 1612 Galileo published a Discourse on Floating Bodies, \nand in 1613, Letters on the Sunspots. In this latter work he\nfirst expressed his position in favor of Copernicus. In 1614 both his\ndaughters entered the Franciscan convent of Saint Mathew, near \nFlorence. Virginia became Sister Maria Celeste and Livia, Sister \nArcangela. Marina Gamba, their mother, had been left behind in Padua \nwhen Galileo moved to Florence. \n\nIn 1613–4 Galileo entered into discussions of Copernicanism \nthrough his student Benedetto Castelli, and wrote a Letter to \nCastelli. In 1616 he transformed this into the Letter to the\nGrand Duchess Christina. In February 1616, the Sacred \nCongregation of the Index condemned Copernicus’ book On the \nRevolution of the Heavenly Orbs, pending correction. Galileo \nthen was called to an audience with Cardinal Robert Bellarmine and \nadvised not to teach or defend Copernican theory. \n\nIn 1623 Galileo published The Assayer dealing with the \ncomets and arguing they were sublunary phenomena. In this book, he \nmade some of his most famous methodological pronouncements including \nthe claim the book of nature is written in the language of \nmathematics. \n\nThe same year Maffeo Barberini, Galileo’s supporter and friend, was \nelected Pope Urban VIII. Galileo felt empowered to begin work on his \nDialogues concerning the Two Great World Systems. It was \npublished with an imprimatur from Florence (and not Rome) in 1632. \nShortly afterwards the Inquisition banned its sale, and Galileo was \nordered to Rome for trial. In 1633 he was condemned. There is more \nabout these events and their implications in the final section of \nthis article, \n Galileo and the Church.\n  \n\nIn 1634, while Galileo was under house arrest, his daughter, Maria \nCeleste died (cf. Sobel 1999). At this time he began work on his \nfinal book, Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations concerning\nTwo New Sciences. This book was smuggled out of Italy and \npublished in Holland. Galileo died early in 1642. Due to his \nconviction, he was buried obscurely until 1737. \n\nFor detailed biographical material, the best and classic work dealing\nwith Galileo’s life and scientific achievements is Stillman\nDrake’s Galileo at Work (1978). More recently, J.L. Heilbron\nhas written a magnificent biography, Galileo, that touches on\nall the multiple facets of Galileo’s life (2010). A strange\npopularization based somewhat on Heilbron’s book, by Adam Gopik,\nappeared in The New Yorker in 2013. \n\nFor many people, in the Seventeenth Century as well as today,\nGalileo was and is seen as the ‘hero’ of modern science.\nGalileo discovered many things: with his telescope, he first saw the\nmoons of Jupiter and the mountains on the Moon; he determined the\nparabolic path of projectiles and calculated the law of free fall on\nthe basis of experiment. He is known for defending and making popular\nthe Copernican system, using the telescope to examine the heavens,\ninventing the microscope, dropping stones from towers and masts,\nplaying with pendula and clocks, being the first ‘real’\nexperimental scientist, advocating the relativity of motion, and\ncreating a mathematical physics. His major claim to fame probably\ncomes from his trial by the Catholic Inquisition and his purported\nrole as heroic rational, modern man in the subsequent history of the\n‘warfare’ between science and religion. This is no small\nset of accomplishments for one 17th-century Italian, who\nwas the son of a court musician and who left the University of Pisa\nwithout a degree. \n\nOne of the good things about dealing with such momentous times and \npeople is that they are full of interpretive fecundity. Galileo and \nhis work provide one such occasion. Since his death in 1642, Galileo \nhas been the subject of manifold interpretations and much \ncontroversy. The use of Galileo’s work and the invocations of his \nname make a fascinating history (Segre 1991, Palmerino and Thijssen \n2004,  Finocchiaro 2005), but this is not our topic here. \n\nPhilosophically, Galileo has been used to exemplify many different\nthemes, usually as a side bar to what the particular writer wished to\nmake the hallmark of the scientific revolution or the nature of good\nscience. Whatever was good about the new science or science in\ngeneral, it was Galileo who started it. One early 20th Century\ntradition of Galileo scholarship used to divvy up Galileo’s work into\nthree or four parts: (1) his physics, (2) his astronomy, and (3) his\nmethodology, which could include his method of Biblical interpretation\nand his thoughts about the nature of proof or demonstration. In this\ntradition, typical treatments dealt with his physical and astronomical\ndiscoveries and their background and/or who were Galileo’s\npredecessors. More philosophically, many would ask how his mathematics\nrelates to his natural philosophy? How did he produce a telescope and\nuse his telescopic observations to provide evidence in favor of\nCopernicanism (Reeves 2008)? Was he an experimentalist (Settle 1961,\n196, 1983, 1992; Palmieri 2008), a mathematical Platonist\n(Koyré 1939), an Aristotelian emphasizing experience (Geymonat\n1954), precursor of modern positivist science (Drake 1978), or maybe\nan Archimedean (Machamer 1998), who might have used a revised\nScholastic method of proof (Wallace 1992)? Or did he have no method\nand just fly like an eagle in the way that geniuses do (Feyerabend\n1975)? Behind each of these claims there was some attempt to place\nGalileo in an intellectual context that brought out the background to\nhis achievements. Some emphasize his debt to the artisan/engineer\npractical tradition (Rossi 1962), others his mathematics (Giusti1993,\nPeterson 2011,, Feldhay 1998, Palmieri 2001, 2003, Renn 2002,\nPalmerino 2015,), some his mixed (or subalternate) mathematics\n(Machamer 1978, 1998, Lennox 1986, Wallace 1992), others his debt to\natomism (Shea 1972, Redondi 1983), and some his use of Hellenistic and\nMedieval impetus theory (Duhem 1954, Claggett 1966, Shapere 1974) or\nthe idea that discoveries bring new data into science (Wootton\n(2015). \n\nYet most everyone in this tradition seemed to think the three \nareas—physics, astronomy and methodology—were somewhat \ndistinct and represented different Galilean endeavors. More recent \nhistorical research has followed contemporary intellectual fashion \nand shifted foci bringing new dimensions to our understanding of \nGalileo by studying his rhetoric (Moss 1993, Feldhay 1998, Spranzi \n2004), the power structures of his social milieu (Biagioli 1993, \n2006), his personal quest for acknowledgment (Shea and Artigas 2003) \nand more generally has emphasized the larger social and cultural \nhistory, specifically the court and papal culture, in which Galileo \nfunctioned (Redondi 1983, Biagioli 1993, 2006, Heilbron 2010). \n\nIn an intellectualist recidivist mode, this entry will outline his \ninvestigations in physics and astronomy and exhibit, in a new way, \nhow these all cohered in a unified inquiry. In setting this path out \nI shall show why, at the end of his life, Galileo felt compelled (in \nsome sense of necessity) to write the Discourses Concerning the \nTwo New Sciences, which stands as a true completion of his \noverall project and is not just a reworking of his earlier research \nthat he reverted to after his trial, when he was blind and under \nhouse arrest. Particularly, we shall try to show why both of the \ntwo new sciences, especially the first, were so important (a\ntopic not much treated except recently by Biener 2004 and Raphael\n2011). In passing, we shall touch on his methodology and his\nmathematics (and here refer you to some of the recent work by Palmieri\n2001, 2003). At the end we shall have some words about Galileo, the\nCatholic Church and his trial. \n\nThe philosophical thread that runs through Galileo’s intellectual life\nis a strong and increasing desire to find a new conception of what\nconstitutes natural philosophy and how natural philosophy ought to be\npursued. Galileo signals this goal clearly when he leaves Padua in\n1611 to return to Florence and the court of the Medici and asks for\nthe title Philosopher as well as Mathematician.\nThis was not just a status-affirming request, but also a reflection of\nhis large-scale goal. What Galileo accomplished by the end of his life\nin 1642 was a reasonably articulated replacement for the traditional\nset of analytical concepts connected with the Aristotelian tradition\nof natural philosophy. He offered, in place of the Aristotelian\ncategories, a set of mechanical concepts that were accepted by most\neveryone who afterwards developed the ‘new sciences’, and\nwhich, in some form or another, became the hallmark of the new\nphilosophy. His way of thinking became the way of the scientific\nrevolution (and yes, there was such a ‘revolution’ pace\nShapin 1996 and others, cf. selections in Lindberg 1990, Osler\n2000.) \n\nSome scholars might wish to describe what Galileo achieved in\npsychological terms as an introduction of new mental models (Palmieri\n2003) or a new model of intelligibility (Machamer 1998, Adams et\nal. 2017). However phrased, Galileo’s main move was to de-throne\nthe Aristotelian physical categories of the one celestial (the aether\nor fifth element) and four terrestrial elements (fire, air, water and\nearth) and their differential directional natures of motion\n(circular,  and up and down). In their place he left only one\nelement, corporeal matter, and a different way of describing the\nproperties and motions of matter in terms of the mathematics of the\nequilibria of proportional relations (Palmieri 2001) that were\ntypified by the Archimedian simple machines—the balance, the\ninclined plane, the lever, and, he includes, the pendulum (Machamer\n1998, Machamer and Hepburn 2004, Palmieri 2008). In doing so Galileo\nchanged the acceptable way of talking about matter and its motion, and\nso ushered in the mechanical tradition that characterizes so much of\nmodern science, even today. But this would take more explaining\n(Dijksterhuis 1950, Machamer et al. 2000, Gaukroger 2009). \n\nAs a main focus underlying Galileo’s accomplishments, it is useful to\nsee him as being interested in finding a unified theory of matter, a \nmathematical theory of the material stuff that constitutes the whole \nof the cosmos. Perhaps he didn’t realize that this was his grand goal\nuntil the time he actually wrote the Discourses on the Two New \nSciences in 1638. Despite working on problems of the nature of \nmatter from 1590 onwards, he could not have written his final work \nmuch earlier than 1638, certainly not before The Starry \nMessenger of 1610, and actually not before the \nDialogues on the Two Chief World Systems of 1632.  Before\n1632, he did not have the theory and evidence he needed to support his\nclaim about unified, singular matter. He had thought deeply about the\nnature of matter before 1610 and had tried to work out how best to\ndescribe matter, but the idea of unified matter theory had to\nwait on the establishment of principles of matter’s motion on a moving\nearth. And this he did not do until the\nDialogues. \n\nGalileo began his critique of Aristotle in the 1590 manuscript, \nDe Motu. The first part of this manuscript deals with \nterrestrial matter and argues that Aristotle’s theory has it wrong. \nFor Aristotle, sublunary or terrestrial matter is of four kinds \n[earth, air, water, and fire] and has two forms, heavy and light, \nwhich by nature are different principles of (natural) motion, down \nand up. Galileo, using an Archimedian model of floating bodies and \nlater the balance, argues that there is only one principle of motion,\nthe heavy (gravitas), and that lightness (or \nlevitas) is to be explained by the heavy bodies moving so as\nto displace or extrude other bits of matter in such a direction that\nexplains why the other bits rise. So on his view heaviness (or \ngravity) is the cause of all natural terrestrial motion. But\nthis left him with a problem as to the nature of the heavy, the \nnature of gravitas? In De Motu, he argued that the \nmoving arms of a balance could be used as a model for treating all \nproblems of motion. In this model heaviness is the proportionality of\nweight of one object on one arm of a balance to that of the weight of\nanother body on the other arm of the balance. In the context of \nfloating bodies, weight is the ‘weight’ of one body minus\nweight of the medium. \n\nGalileo realized quickly these characterizations were insufficient, \nand so began to explore how heaviness was relative to the different \nspecific gravities of bodies having the same volume. He was trying to\nfigure out what is the concept of heaviness that is characteristic of\nall matter. What he failed to work out, and this was probably the \nreason why he never published De Motu, was this positive \ncharacterization of heaviness. There seemed to be no way to find \nstandard measures of heaviness that would work across different \nsubstances. So at this point he did not have useful replacement \ncategories. \n\nA while later, in his 1600 manuscript, Le Mecaniche (Galileo\n1600/1960) he introduces the concept of momento, a \nquasi force concept that applies to a body at a moment and \nwhich is somehow proportional to weight or specific gravity (Galluzzi\n1979). Still, he has no good way to measure or compare specific \ngravities of bodies of different kinds and his notebooks during this \nearly 17th-century period reflect his trying again and \nagain to find a way to bring all matter under a single proportional \nmeasuring scale. He tries to study acceleration along an inclined \nplane and to find a way to think of what changes acceleration brings.\nIn this regard and during this period he attempts to examine the \nproperties of percussive effect of bodies of different specific \ngravities, or how they have differential impacts. Yet the details and\ncategories of how to properly treat weight and movement elude him. \n\nOne of Galileo’s problems was that the Archimedian simple machines\nthat he was using as his model of intelligibility, especially the\nbalance, are not easily conceived of in a dynamic way (but see\nMachamer and Woody 1994).  Except for the inclined plane, time is not\na property of the action of simple machines that one would normally\nattend to. In discussing a balance, one does not normally think about\nhow fast an arm of the balance descends nor how fast a body on the\nopposite arm is rising (though Galileo in his Postils to\nRocco ca. 1634–45 does; see Palmieri 2005). The converse is\nalso true. It is difficult to model ‘dynamic’ phenomena\nthat deal with the rate of change of different bodies as problems of\nbalance arms moving upwards or downwards because of differential\nweights. So it was that Galileo’s classic dynamic puzzle about how to\ndescribe time and the force of percussion, or the force of body’s\nimpact, would remain unsolved, He could not, throughout his life find\nsystematic relations among specific gravities, height of fall and\npercussive forces. In the Fifth Day of the Discouses, he\npresciently explores the concept of the force of\npercussion. This concept will become, after his death, one of the\nmost fecund ways to think about matter. \n\nIn 1603–9, Galileo worked long at doing experiments on inclined\nplanes and most importantly with pendula. The pendulum again \nexhibited to Galileo that acceleration and, therefore, time is a \ncrucial variable. Moreover, isochrony—equal times for equal \nlengths of string, despite different weights—goes someway \ntowards showing that time is a possible form for describing the \nequilibrium (or ratio) that needs to be made explicit in representing\nmotion. It also shows that in at least one case time can displace \nweight as a crucial variable. Work on the force of percussion and \ninclined planes also emphasized acceleration and time, and during \nthis time (ca. 1608) he wrote a little treatise on acceleration that \nremained unpublished. \n\nWe see from this period that Galileo’s law of free fall arises out of\nthis struggle to find the proper categories for his new science of \nmatter and motion. Galileo accepts, probably as early as the 1594 \ndraft of Le Mecaniche, that natural motions might be \naccelerated. But that accelerated motion is properly measured against\ntime is an idea enabled only later, chiefly through his failure to \nfind any satisfactory dependence on place and specific gravity. \nGalileo must have observed that the speeds of bodies increase as they\nmove downwards and, perhaps, do so naturally, particularly in the \ncases of the pendulum, the inclined plane, in free fall, and during \nprojectile motion. Also at this time he begins to think about \npercussive force, the force that a body acquires during its motion \nthat shows upon impact. For many years he thinks that the correct \nscience of these changes should describe how bodies change according \nto where they are on their paths. Specifically, it seems that height \nis crucial. Percussive force is directly related to height and the \nmotion of the pendulum seems to involve essentially equilibrium with \nrespect to the height of the bob (and time also, but isochrony did \nnot lead directly to a recognition of time’s importance.) \n\nThe law of free fall, expressed as time squared, was discovered by \nGalileo through the inclined plane experiments (Drake 1999, v. 2), \nbut he attempted to find an explanation of this relation, and the \nequivalent mean proportional relation, through a velocity-distance \nrelation. His later and correct definition of natural acceleration as\ndependent on time is an insight gained through recognizing the \nphysical significance of the mean proportional relation (Machamer and\nHepburn 2004; for a different analysis of Galileo’s discovery of free\nfall see Renn et al. 2004.) Yet Galileo would not publish anything \nmaking time central to motion until 1638, in Discourses on the \nTwo New Sciences (Galileo 1638/1954.) But let us return to the \nmain matter. \n\nIn 1609 Galileo begins his work with the telescope. Many interpreters\nhave taken this to be an interlude irrelevant to his physics. The\nStarry Messenger, which describes his early telescopic\ndiscoveries, was published in 1610. There are many ways to describe\nGalileo’s findings but for present purposes they are remarkable as his\nstart at dismantling of the celestial/terrestrial distinction\n(Feyerabend 1975). Perhaps the most unequivocal case of this is when\nhe analogizes the mountains on the moon to mountains in Bohemia. The\nabandonment of the heaven/earth dichotomy implied that all matter is\nof the same kind, whether celestial or terrestrial. Further, if there\nis only one kind of matter there can be only one kind of natural\nmotion, one kind of motion that this matter has by nature. So it has\nto be that one law of motion will hold for earth, fire and the\nheavens. This is a far stronger claim than he had made back in 1590.\nIn addition, he described of his discovery of the four moons circling\nJupiter, which he called politically the Medicean stars (after the\nruling family in Florence, his patrons). In the Copernican system, the\nearth having a moon revolve around it was unique and so seemingly\nproblematic. Jupiter’s having planets made the earth-moon system\nnon-unique and so again the earth became like the other planets. \nSome fascinating background and treatments of this period of Galileo’s\nlife and motivations have recently appeared (Biagoli 2006, Reeves\n2008, and the essays in Hessler and De Simone 2013). \n\nIn 1611, at the request of Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, the professors\nat the Collegio Romano confirmed Galileo’s telescopic observations,\nwith a slight dissent from Father Clavius, who felt that the moon’s\nsurface was probably not uneven. Later that year Clavius changed his\nmind. \n\nA few years later in his Letters on the Sunspots (1612),\nGalileo enumerated more reasons for the breakdown of the\ncelestial/terrestrial distinction. Basically the ideas here were that\nthe sun has spots (maculae) and rotated in circular motion,\nand, most importantly Venus had phases just like the moon, which was\nthe spatial key to physically locating Venus as being between the Sun\nand the earth, and as revolving around the Sun. In these letters he\nclaimed that the new telescopic evidence supported the Copernican\ntheory. Certainly the phases of Venus contradicted the Ptolemaic\nordering of the planets. \n\nLater in 1623, Galileo argued for a quite mistaken material thesis. \nIn The Assayer, he tried to show that comets were sublunary \nphenomena and that their properties could be explained by optical \nrefraction. While this work stands as a masterpiece of scientific \nrhetoric, it is somewhat strange that Galileo should have argued \nagainst the super-lunary nature of comets, which the great Danish \nastronomer Tycho Brahe had demonstrated earlier. \n\nYet even with all these changes, two things were missing. First, he \nneeded to work out some general principles concerning the nature of \nmotion for this new unified matter. Specifically, given his \nCopernicanism, he needed to work out, at least qualitatively, a way \nof thinking about the motions of matter on a moving earth. The change\nhere was not just the shift from a Ptolemaic, Earth-centered \nplanetary system to a Sun-centered Copernican model. For Galileo, \nthis shift was also from a mathematical planetary model to a \nphysically realizable cosmography. It was necessary for him to \ndescribe the planets and the earth as real material bodies. In this \nrespect Galileo differed dramatically from Ptolemy, Copernicus, or \neven Tycho Brahe, who had demolished the crystalline spheres by his \ncomets-as-celestial argument and flirted with physical models \n(Westman 1976). So on the new Galilean scheme there is only one kind \nof matter, and it may have only one kind of motion natural to it. \nTherefore, he had to devise (or shall we say, discover) principles of\nlocal motion that will fit a central sun, planets moving around that \nsun, and a daily whirling earth. \n\nThis he did by introducing two new principles. In Day One of his \nDialogues on the Two Chief World Systems (1632), Galileo\nargued that all natural motion is circular. Then, in Day Two, he\nintroduced his version of the famous principle of the relativity of\nobserved motion. This latter held that motions in common among bodies\ncould not be observed. Only those motions differing from a shared\ncommon motion could be seen as moving. The joint effect of these two\nprinciples was to say that all matter shares a common motion,\ncircular, and so only motions different from the common, say up and\ndown motion, could be directly observed. Of course, neither of the\nprinciples originated with Galileo. They had predecessors. But no one\nneeded them for the reasons that he did, namely that they were\nnecessitated by a unified cosmological matter. \n\nIn Day Three, Galileo dramatically argues for the Copernican\nsystem. Salviati, the persona of Galileo, has Simplicio, the ever\nastounded Aristotelian, make use of astronomical observations,\nespecially the facts that Venus has phases and that Venus and Mercury\nare never far from the Sun, to construct a diagram of the planetary\npositions. The resulting diagram neatly corresponds to the Copernican\nmodel. Earlier in Day One, he had repeated his claims from The\nStarry Messenger, noting that the earth must be like the moon in\nbeing spherical, dense and solid, and having rugged mountains.\nClearly the moon could not be a crystalline sphere as held by some\nAristotelians. \n\nIn the Dialogues, things are more complicated than we have\njust sketched. Galileo, as noted, argues for a circular natural\nmotion, so that all things on the earth and in the atmosphere revolve\nin a common motion with the earth so that the principle of the\nrelativity of observed motion will apply to phenomena such as balls\ndropped from the masts of moving ships. Yet he also introduces at\nplaces a straight-line natural motion. For example, in Day Three, he\ngives a quasi account for a Coriolis-type effect for the winds\ncirculating about the earth by means of this straight-line motion\n(Hooper 1998).  Further, in Day Four, when he is giving his proof of\nthe Copernican theory by sketching out how the three-way moving earth\nmechanically moves the tides, he nuances his matter theory by\nattributing to the element water the power of retaining an impetus for\nmotion such that it can provide a reciprocal movement once it is\nsloshed against a side of a basin. This was not Galileo’s first\ndealing with water. We saw it in De Motu in 1590, with\nsubmerged bodies, but more importantly he learned much more while\nworking through his dispute over floating bodies (Discourse on\nFloating Bodies, 1612).  In fact a large part of this debate\nturned on the exact nature of water as matter, and what kind of\nmathematical proportionality could be used to correctly describe it\nand bodies moving in it (cf. Palmieri, 1998, 2004a). \n\nThe final chapter of Galileo’s scientific story comes in 1638 with \nthe publication of Discourses of the Two New Sciences. The \nsecond science, discussed (so to speak) in the last two days, dealt \nwith the principles of local motion. These have been much commented \nupon in the Galilean literature. Here is where he enunciates the law \nof free fall, the parabolic path for projectiles and his physical \n“discoveries” (Drake 1999, v. 2). But the first two days,\nthe first science, has been much misunderstood and little discussed. \nThis first science, misleadingly, has been called the science of the \nstrength of materials, and so seems to have found a place in history \nof engineering, since such a course is still taught today. However, \nthis first science is not about the strength of materials per \nse. It is Galileo’s attempt to provide a mathematical science of\nhis unified matter. (See Machamer 1998, Machamer and Hepburn 2004, \nand the detailed work spelling this out by Biener 2004.) Galileo \nrealizes that before he can work out a science of the motion of \nmatter, he must have some way of showing that the nature of matter \nmay be mathematically characterized. Both the mathematical nature of \nmatter and the mathematical principles of motion he believes belong \nto the science of mechanics, which is the name he gives for this new \nway of philosophizing. Remember that specific gravities did not work. \n\nSo it is in Day One that he begins to discuss how to describe, \nmathematically (or geometrically), the causes of how beams break. He \nis searching for the mathematical description of the essential nature\nof matter. He rules out certain questions that might use infinite \natoms as basis for this discussion, and continues on giving reasons \nfor various properties that matter has. Among these are questions of \nthe constitution of matter, properties of matter due to its \nheaviness, the properties of the media within which bodies move and \nwhat is the cause of a body’s coherence as a single material body. \nThe most famous of these discussions is his account of acceleration \nof falling bodies, that whatever their weight would fall equally fast\nin a vacuum. The Second Day lays out the mathematical principles \nconcerning how bodies break. He does this all by reducing the \nproblems of matter to problems of how a lever and a balance function.\nSomething he had begun back in 1590, though this time he believes he \nis getting it right, showing mathematically how bits of matter \nsolidify and stick together, and do so by showing how they break into\nbits. The ultimate explanation of the “sticking” eluded \nhim since he felt he would have to deal with infinitesimals to really\nsolve this problem. \n\nThe second science, Days Three and Four of Discorsi, dealt\nwith proper principles of local motion, but this was now motion for\nall matter (not just sublunary stuff) and it took the categories of\ntime and acceleration as basic. Interestingly Galileo, here again,\nrevisited or felt the need to include some anti-Aristotelian points\nabout motion as he had done back in 1590. The most famous example of\nhis doing this, is his “beautiful thought experiment”,\nwhereby he compares two bodies of the same material of different sizes\nand points out that according to Aristotle they fall at different\nspeeds, the heavier one faster. Then, he says, join the bodies\ntogether. In this case the lightness of the small one ought to slow\ndown the faster larger one, and so they together fall as a speed less\nthan the heavy fell in the first instance. Then his punch line: but\none might also conceive of the two bodies joined as being one larger\nbody, in which case it would fall even more quickly. So there is a\ncontradiction in the Aristotelian position (Palmieri 2005). His\nprojected Fifth Day would have treated the grand principle of the\npower of matter in motion due to impact. He calls it the force of\npercussion, which deals with two bodies interacting. This problem he\ndoes not solve, and it won’t be solved until René Descartes,\nprobably following Isaac Beeckman, turns the problem into finding the\nequilibrium points for colliding bodies. \n\nThe sketch above provides the basis for understanding Galileo’s \nchanges. He has a new science of matter, a new physical cosmography, \nand a new science of local motion. In all these he is using a \nmathematical mode of description based upon, though somewhat changed \nfrom, the proportional geometry of Euclid, Book VI and Archimedes \n(for details on the change see Palmieri 2002). \n\nIt is in this way that Galileo developed the new categories of the \nmechanical new science, the science of matter and motion. His new \ncategories utilized some of the basic principles of traditional \nmechanics, to which he added the category of time and so emphasized \nacceleration. But throughout, he was working out the details about \nthe nature of matter so that it could be understood as uniform and \ntreated in a way that allowed for coherent discussion of the \nprinciples of motion. That a unified matter became accepted and its \nnature became one of the problems for the ‘new science’ \nthat followed was due to Galileo. Thereafter, matter really mattered. \n\nNo account of Galileo’s importance to philosophy can be complete if \nit does not discuss Galileo’s condemnation and the Galileo affair \n(Finocchiaro 1989). The end of the episode is simply stated. In late \n1632, after publishing Dialogues on the Two Chief World \nSystems, Galileo was ordered to go to Rome to be examined by the\nHoly Office of the Inquisition. In January 1633, a very ill Galileo \nmade an arduous journey to Rome. Finally, in April 1633 Galileo was \ncalled before the Holy Office. This was tantamount to a charge of \nheresy, and he was urged to repent (Shea and Artigas, 183f). \nSpecifically, he had been charged with teaching and defending the \nCopernican doctrine that holds that the Sun is at the center of the \nuniverse and that the earth moves. This doctrine had been deemed \nheretical in 1616, and Copernicus’ book had been placed on the Index of \nProhibited Books, pending correction. \n\nGalileo was called four times for a hearing; the last was on June 21,\n1633. The next day, 22 June, Galileo was taken to the church of Santa\nMaria sopra Minerva, and ordered to kneel while his sentence was \nread. It was declared that he was “vehemently suspect of \nheresy”. Galileo was made to recite and sign a formal \nabjuration: \n\nGalileo was not imprisoned but had his sentence commuted to house \narrest. In December 1633 he was allowed to retire to his villa in \nArcetri, outside of Florence. During this time he finished his last \nbook, Discourses on the Two New Sciences, which was \npublished in 1638, in Holland, by Louis Elzivier. The book does not \nmention Copernicanism at all, and Galileo professed amazement at how \nit could have been published. He died on January 8, 1642. \n\nThere has been much controversy over the events leading up to \nGalileo’s trial, and it seems that each year we learn more about what\nactually happened. There is also controversy over the legitimacy of \nthe charges against Galileo, both in terms of their content and \njudicial procedure. The summary judgment about this latter point is \nthat the Church most probably acted within its authority and on \n‘good’ grounds given the condemnation of Copernicus, and,\nas we shall see, the fact that Galileo had been warned by Cardinal \nBellarmine earlier in 1616 not to defend or teach Copernicanism. There \nwere also a number of political factors given the Counter \nReformation, the 30 Years War (Miller 2008), and the problems with \nthe papacy of Urban VIII that served as further impetus to Galileo’s \ncondemnation (McMullin, ed. 2005). It has even been argued (Redondi \n1983) that the charge of Copernicanism was a compromise plea bargain \nto avoid the truly heretical charge of atomism. Though this latter \nhypothesis has not found many willing supporters. \n\nLegitimacy of the content, that is, of the condemnation of \nCopernicus, is much more problematic. Galileo had addressed this \nproblem in 1615, when he wrote his Letter to Castelli (which\nwas transformed into the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina).\nIn this letter he had argued that, of course, the Bible was an \ninspired text, yet two truths could not contradict one another. So in\ncases where it was known that science had achieved a true result, the\nBible ought to be interpreted in such a way that makes it compatible \nwith this truth. The Bible, he argued, was an historical document \nwritten for common people at an historical time, and it had to be \nwritten in language that would make sense to them and lead them \ntowards the true religion. \n\nMuch philosophical controversy, before and after Galileo’s time,\nrevolves around this doctrine of the two truths and their seeming\nincompatibility. Which of course, leads us right to such questions as:\n“What is truth?” and “How is truth known or\nshown?” \n\nCardinal Bellarmine was willing to countenance scientific truth if it\ncould be proven or demonstrated (McMullin 1998). But Bellarmine held \nthat the planetary theories of Ptolemy and Copernicus (and presumably\nTycho Brahe) were only hypotheses and due to their mathematical, \npurely calculatory character were not susceptible to physical proof. \nThis is a sort of instrumentalist, anti-realist position (Duhem 1985,\nMachamer 1976). There are any number of ways to argue for some sort \nof instrumentalism. Duhem (1985) himself argued that science is not \nmetaphysics, and so only deals with useful conjectures that enable us\nto systematize the phenomena. Subtler versions, without an Aquinian \nmetaphysical bias, of this position have been argued subsequently and\nmore fully by van Fraassen (1996) and others. Less sweepingly, it \ncould reasonably be argued that both Ptolemy and Copernicus’ theories\nwere primarily mathematical, and that what Galileo was defending was \nnot Copernicus’ theory per se, but a physical realization of it. In \nfact, it might be better to say the Copernican theory that Galileo \nwas constructing was a physical realization of parts of Copernicus’ \ntheory, which, by the way, dispensed with all the mathematical \ntrappings (eccentrics, epicycles, Tusi couples and the like). Galileo\nwould be led to such a view by his concern with matter theory. Of \ncourse, put this way we are faced with the question of what \nconstitutes identity conditions for a theory, or being the same \ntheory. There is clearly a way in which Galileo’s Copernicus is not \nCopernicus and most certainly not Kepler. \n\nThe other aspect of all this which has been hotly debated is: what\nconstitutes proof or demonstration of a scientific claim? In 1616, the\nsame year that Copernicus’ book was placed on the Index of Prohibited\nBooks, Galileo was called before Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, head of\nthe Holy Office of the Inquisition and warned not to defend or teach\nCopernicanism. During this year Galileo also completed a\nmanuscript, On the Ebb and Flow of the Tides. The argument of\nthis manuscript will turn up 17 years later as day Four of\nGalileo’s Dialogues concerning the Two Chief World Systems.\nThis argument, about the tides, Galileo believed provided proof of the\ntruth of the Copernican theory. But insofar as it possibly does, it\nprovides an argument for the physical plausibility of Galileo’s\nCopernican theory. Let’s look more closely at his argument. \n\nGalileo argues that the motion of the earth (diurnal and axial) is \nthe only conceivable (or maybe plausible) physical cause for the \nreciprocal regular motion of the tides. He restricts the possible \nclass of causes to mechanical motions, and so rules out Kepler’s \nattribution of the moon as a cause. How could the moon without any \nconnection to the seas cause the tides to ebb and flow? Such an \nexplanation would be the invocation of magic or occult powers. So the\nmotion of the earth causes the waters in the basins of the seas to \nslosh back and forth, and since the earth’s diurnal and axial \nrotation is regular, so are the periods of the tides; the backward \nmovement is due to the residual impetus built up in the water during \nits slosh. Differences in tidal flows are due to the differences in \nthe physical conformations of the basins in which they flow (for \nbackground and more detail, see Palmieri 1998). \n\nAlbeit mistaken, Galileo’s commitment to mechanically intelligible\ncausation makes this is a plausible argument. One can see why Galileo\nthinks he has some sort of proof for the motion of the earth, and\ntherefore for Copernicanism. Yet one can also see why Bellarmine and\nthe instrumentalists would not be impressed. First, they do not accept\nGalileo’s restriction of possible causes to mechanically intelligible\ncauses. Second, the tidal argument does not directly deal with the\nannual motion of the earth about the sun. And third, the argument does\nnot touch anything about the central position of the sun or about the\nperiods of the planets as calculated by Copernicus. So at its best,\nGalileo’s argument is an inference to the best partial explanation of\none point in Copernicus’ theory. Yet when this argument is added to\nthe earlier telescopic observations that show the improbabilities of\nthe older celestial picture, to the fact that Venus has phases like\nthe moon and so must revolve around the sun, to the principle of the\nrelativity of perceived motion which neutralizes the physical motion\narguments against a moving earth, it was enough for Galileo to believe\nthat he had the necessary proof to convince the Copernican\ndoubters. Unfortunately, it was not until after Galileo’s death and\nthe acceptance of a unified material cosmology, utilizing the\npresuppositions about matter and motion that were published in\nthe Discourses on the Two New Sciences, that people were\nready for such proofs. But this could occur only after Galileo had\nchanged the acceptable parameters for gaining knowledge and theorizing\nabout the world.  \n\nTo read many of the documents of Galileo’s trial see Finocchiaro 1989,\nand Mayer 2012.
