It is true that we have the notes\nassembled from his lectures on aesthetics given to a small group of\nstudents in private rooms in Cambridge in the summer of 1938\n(Wittgenstein 1966) and we have G. E. Moore's record of some of\nWittgenstein's lectures in the period 1930–33 (Moore 1972).  Of\nWittgenstein's own writings, we find remarks on literature, poetry,\narchitecture, the visual arts, and especially music and the philosophy\nof culture more broadly scattered throughout his writings on the\nphilosophies of language, mind, mathematics, and philosophical method,\nas well as in his more personal notebooks; a number of these are\ncollected in Culture and Value (Wittgenstein 1980).  In\nanother sense, it is not surprising at all, precisely because\nof the central position he gave to the aesthetic: in writing about\nquestions of meaning, as he did throughout his life from the earliest\npre-Tractatus (Wittgenstein 1961, 1971) writings to the\nremarks from the last weeks of his life in On Certainty\n(Wittgenstein 1969), in writing about perception, as he did in Part II\nof Philosophical Investigations (Wittgenstein 1958),\nRemarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volumes I and II\n(Wittgenstein 1980a, 1980b), and Last Writings on the Philosophy\nof Psychology, volume I (Wittgenstein 1982), and in writing about\nthe contextual prerequisites to the emergence of sense in his\nphilosophy of mind and language (in (Wittgenstein 1958) as well as his\nwritings on the philosophy of mathematics), he was writing—if at\none remove—about aesthetics. For questions of meaning, of\nperception, and of sense are all clearly central to aesthetic\nexperience, and the writing he undertook on these subjects holds\nsignificance for questions of artistic meaning and interpretation that\nis still being explored and articulated (Lewis 2004, Dauber and Jost\n2003, Gibson and Huemer 2004).  Wittgenstein placed the aesthetic, not\non a distant periphery of philosophical subjects, but then not at the\ncenter of a grouping of such interests either—for then it would\nstill be a subject area unto itself. Rather, Wittgenstein interweaves\nthe subject's various and variegated strands throughout his writing in\na way that in some cases shows explicitly, and in many more cases\nsuggests implicitly, the layered interconnections between aesthetic\nconsiderations and every other area of philosophy upon which he\nwrote. In this article I will, then, look at the record we have of his\nlectures on the topic (which, predictably, take up many connections to\nextra-aesthetic issues along the way), but throughout try to offer a\nreading of them that situates them into the larger context of his\nphilosophical work.\n\n\n\nWittgenstein's opening remark is double-barreled: he states that\nthe field of aesthetics is both very big and entirely misunderstood. By\n“very big”, I believe he means both that the aesthetic\ndimension weaves itself through all of philosophy in the manner\nsuggested above, and that the reach of the aesthetic in human\naffairs is very much greater than the far more restricted reach of the\nartistic; the world is densely packed with manifestations of\nthe aesthetic sense or aesthetic interest, while the number of works of\nart is very much smaller. There is good reason, in his discussions that\nfollow, to believe that he intends that any comprehensive account of\nthe aesthetic would acknowledge the former, and not just – as a\ngood number of philosophical accounts have so restricted themselves\n– the latter. By “entirely misunderstood”, it\nemerges that he means both (1) that aesthetic questions are of a\nconceptual type very distinct from empirical questions and the\nkind of answer, or conceptual satisfaction, we want is very unlike what\nwe might get from an experiment in empirical psychology, and (2) that\nthe philosophically traditional method of essentialistic definition\n– determining the essence that all members of the class\n“works of art” exhibit and by virtue of which they are so\nclassified – will conceal from our view more than it\nreveals.  \n\nIt is also vividly apparent from the outset of these lectures that\nWittgenstein is urging a heightened vigilance to the myriad ways in\nwhich words can, on their grammatical surface, mislead. If, right at\nthe beginning of the inquiry, we see that we use the word\n“beautiful” as an adjective, we may well very shortly find\nourselves asking what is the essence of the property beauty\nthat this particular example exhibits. Imagining a book of philosophy\ninvestigating parts of speech (but very many more parts than we find\nin an ordinary grammar book) where we would give very detailed and\nnuanced attention to “seeing”, “feeling”,\nalong with other verbs of personal experience, and equally lengthy\nstudies of “all”, “any”, “some”,\nnumerals, first person pronoun usages, and so forth, he suggests that\nsuch a book would, with sufficient attention paid to the contextual\nintricacies of the grammar of each usage, lay bare the confusion into\nwhich language can lead us. Later, in his Philosophical\nInvestigations (Wittgenstein 1958), he will go on to famously\ndevelop the analogy between tools and language as a way of breaking\nthe hold of the conceptual picture that words work in one way (by\nnaming things—including the naming of properties, as in the way\nwe too-quickly think of the problem of beauty above), showing the\ndiversity of kind and of use among the various\nthings we find in the tool box (e.g. hammer, glue, chisel,\nmatches). If we redirect our attention, away from the idée\nfixe of the puzzle concerning the common property named by the\nword “beauty” or the description “beautiful”,\nand look to the actual use to which our aesthetic-critical vocabulary\nis put, we will see that it is not some intrinsic meaning carried\ninternally by the linguistic sign (Wittgenstein 1958a) that makes the\nword in question function as an aesthetic or critical interjection or\nexpression of approval. We will, rather, be able to focus our\nredirected attention on what actually does make the word in question\nfunction aesthetically, i.e. “on the enormously complicated\nsituation in which the aesthetic expression has a place”, and he\nadds that, with such an enlarged vision, we see that “the\nexpression itself has almost a negligible place” (p. 2). He here\nmentions (seeing aesthetic issues as interwoven with the rest of\nphilosophy) that if he had to identify the main mistake made in\nphilosophical work of his generation, it would be precisely that of,\nwhen looking at language, focusing on the form of words, and not the\nuse made of the form of words. He will go on to imply, if not quite to\ndirectly assert, that the parallel holds to the work of art: to see it\nwithin a larger frame of reference, to see it in comparison to other\nworks of the artist in question and to see it juxtaposed with still\nother works from its cultural context, is to see what role itplayed in\nthe dialogically unfolding artistic\n “language-game”[1]\n of its time and place. In using language, he says next in the\nlectures, in understanding each other—and in mastering a\nlanguage initially—we do not start with a small set of words or\na single word, but rather from specific occasions and activities. Our\naesthetic engagements are occasions and activities of just this kind;\nthus aesthetics, as a field of conceptual inquiry, should start not\nfrom a presumption that the central task is to analyze the determinant\nproperties that are named by aesthetic predicates, but rather with a\nfull-blooded consideration of the activities of aesthetic\nlife. \n\nBut the adjectival form of many—not all—critical\npredicates quickly reinforces the “property-with-name”\nmodel, and against this Wittgenstein places examples from musical and\npoetical criticism, where we simply call attention to the rightness of\na transition or to the precision or aptness of an image. And it is\nhere that Wittgenstein reminds us that descriptions such as\n“stately”, “pompous”, or\n“melancholy” (where the latter is said of a Schubert\npiece) are like giving the work a face (Shiner 1978), or we could\ninstead (or in further specification of such descriptions) use\n gestures.[2]\n In cases of re-construing a work (e.g. the meter of a poem) so that\nwe understand its rhythm and structure anew, we make gestures, facial\nexpressions, and non-descriptive-predicate based remarks, where\naesthetic adjectives play a diminished role or no role at all. And we\nshow our approval of a tailor's work not by describing the suit, but\nby wearing it. Occasions and activities are fundamental, descriptive\nlanguage secondary. \n\nWittgenstein here turns to the subject of rules, and rule-following,\nin aesthetic decision-making. This stems from his reflection on the\nword “correct” in aesthetic discourse, and he mentions the\ncase of being drilled in harmony and counterpoint. Such rule-learning,\nhe claims, allows what he calls an interpretation of the rules in\nparticular cases, where an increasingly refined judgment comes from an\nincreasingly refined mastery of the rules in question. It is of\nparticular interest that a qualification is entered here, that such\nrules in contexts of artistic creativity and aesthetic judgment,\n“may be extremely explicit and taught, or not formulated at\nall” (Wittgenstein 1966).  This itself strongly suggests that,\nin this way too, actions come first, where these actions may\n(to invoke Kant's famous distinction) either explicitly follow from\nthe rule, or stand in accordance with them but (for Wittgenstein) in\nan inexplicit way. The mastery of a practice can be, but need not be,\ncharacterized as a cognitive matter of rule-following. Here we thus\nfind one of the points of intersection between Wittgenstein's\nwork in aesthetics and his work in the philosophy of language: the\nrule-following considerations (Holtzman and Leich 1981 and McDowell\n1998) and the debate concerning non-cognitivism (McDowell 2000) link\ndirectly to this discussion. \n\nRegrettably, Wittgenstein closes this matter prematurely (claiming\nthat this issue should not come in at this point); the linkage between\nrule-following in language and in aesthetics is still to this day too\nlittle investigated. Yet there is a sense in which Wittgenstein\nextends the discussion, if only implicitly. In investigating the kinds\nof things meant by aesthetic “appreciation”, he does say\nthat “an appreciator is not shown by the interjections he\nuses” but rather by his choices, selections, his actions on\nspecific occasions. To describe what appreciation consists in, he\nclaims, would prove an impossibility, for “to describe what it\nconsists in we would have to describe the whole environment”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 7), and he returns to the case of the\ntailor—and thus implicitly to rule-following. Such rules, as we\ndiscern them in action ranging on a continuum from the\ncognitively-explicit and linguistically encapsulated to the\nnon-cognitively implicit and only behaviorally manifested, have a life\n– have an identity as rules—within, and only\nwithin, those larger contexts of engagement, those “whole\nenvironment[s]”. And those environments, those contexts, those\nlanguage-games, are not reducible to a unitary kind which we then\nmight analyze for essential properties: “correctness”, for\nexample, plays a central role in some cases of aesthetic appreciation\nand understanding, and it is irrelevant in others, e.g. in\ngarment-cutting versus Beethoven symphonies, or in domestic\narchitecture versus the Gothic cathedral. And he explicitly draws, if\ntoo briefly, the analogy that emerges here between ethics and\naesthetics: he notes the difference between saying of a person that he\nbehaves well versus saying that a person made a great or profound\nimpression. Indeed, “the entire\ngame is different” (Wittgenstein 1966, 8). \n\nThe central virtue of these lectures is that Wittgenstein never loses\na sense of the complexity of our aesthetic engagements, our\nlanguage attending and in cases manifesting those engagements, and the\ncontextually embedded nature of the aesthetic actions he is working to\nelucidate. Nor does he lose a sense of the relation—a relation\nnecessary to the meaning of the aesthetic language we use –\nbetween the aesthetically-descriptive expressions we employ within\nparticular contexts and “what we call the culture of the\nperiod” (Wittgenstein 1966, 8).  Of those aesthetic words, he\nsays, “To describe their use or to describe what you mean by a\ncultured taste, you have to describe a culture” (Wittgenstein\n1966, 8).  And again making the relation between his work in the\nphilosophy of language and his work in the philosophy of art explicit\n(if again too briefly), he adds, “What belongs to a language\ngame is a whole culture” (Wittgenstein 1966, 8). There the link\nto the irreducible character of rule-following is made again as well:\n“To describe a set of aesthetic rules fully means really to\ndescribe the culture of a period” (Wittgenstein 1966, 8, n. 3).\nIf our aesthetic engagements and the interrelated uses of our\naesthetic terms are widely divergent and context-sensitive, so are our\naesthetic actions and vocabularies context-sensitive in a larger sense\nas well: comparing a cultured taste of fin-de-siecle Vienna\nor early-twentieth-century Cambridge with the Middle Ages, he\nsays—implicitly referring to the radically divergent\nconstellations of meaning-associations from one age to the other,\n“An entirely different game is played in different ages”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, p. 8).  Of a generic claim made about a person\nthat he or she appreciates a given style or genre of art, Wittgenstein\nmakes it clear that he would not yet know—stated in that\ngeneric, case-transcending way—not merely whether it was true or\nnot, but more interestingly and more deeply, what it meant to\nsay this. The word “appreciates” is, like the rest of our\naesthetic vocabulary, not detachable from the\n particular context within which it has its\n life.[3]\n If, against this diversity or context-sensitivity, we seek to find\nand then analyze what all such cases of aesthetic engagement have in\ncommon, we might well focus on the word\n“appreciation”. But that word will not have meaning with a\nbounded determinacy fixed prior to its contextualized use, which means\nthat we would find ourselves, because of this philosophical strategy\n(the entire field “is very big and entirely\nmisunderstood”), in a double bind: first, we would not know the\nmeaning of the term upon which we were focusing; and second, we would,\nin trying to locate what all cases of aesthetic engagement have in\ncommon, leave out of view what he calls in this connection “an\nimmensely complicated family of cases” (Wittgenstein 1966),\nblinding ourselves to nuance and complexity in the name of a\nfalsifying neatness and overarching generality. “In order to get\nclear about aesthetic words you have to describe ways of living. We\nthink we have to talk about aesthetic judgments like ‘This is\nbeautiful’, but we find that if we have to talk about aesthetic\njudgments we don't find these words at all, but a word used\nsomething like a gesture, accompanying a complicated\n activity” (Wittgenstein 1966, 11). \n\nWittgenstein turns to the idea of a science of aesthetics, an idea for\nwhich he has precious little sympathy (“almost too ridiculous\nfor words” [Wittgenstein 1966, 11]).  But as is often the case\nin Wittgenstein's philosophical work, it does not follow from\nthis scornful or dismissive attitude that he has no interest in the\netiology of the idea, or in excavating the hidden steps or components\nof thought that have led some to this idea. In the ensuing discussion\nhe unearths a picture of causation that under-girds the very idea of a\nscientific explanation of aesthetic judgment or preference. And in\nworking underground in this way, he reveals the analogies to cases of\ngenuine scientific explanation, where the “tracing of a\nmechanism” just is the process of giving a causal account, i.e.\nwhere the observed effect is described as the inevitable result of\nprior links in the causal chain leading to it. If, to take his\nexample, an architect designs a door and we find ourselves in a state\nof discontentment because the door, within the larger design of the\nfaçade (within its stylistic “language-game”, we\nmight say), is too low, we are liable to describe this on the model of\nscientific explanation. Then, we make a substantive of the discontent,\nsee it as the causal result of the lowness of the door, and in\nidentifying the lowness as the cause, think ourselves able to dislodge\nthe inner entity, the discontent, by raising the door. But this\nmischaracterizes our aesthetic reactions, or what we might call, by\nanalogy to moral psychology, our aesthetic psychology. \n\nThe true aesthetic reaction—itself rarely described in\nsitu in terms of a proximate cause (“In these cases the\nword ‘cause’ is hardly ever used at all”\n[Wittgenstein 1966, 14]) is far more immediate, and far more\nintertwined with, and related to, what we see\n in[4]\n the work of art in question. “It is a reaction analogous to my\ntaking my hand away from a hot plate” (Wittgenstein 1966).  He\nthus says: \n\nBut there is, as he next says, a “Why?” to such a case of\naesthetic discomfort, if not a cause (on the conventional scientific\nmodel). But both the question and its multiform answers will take,\nindeed, very different forms in different cases. Again, if what he\nsuggested before concerning the significance of context for meaning is\nright, the very meaning of the “Why?”-question\nwill vary case to case. This is not a weaker thesis concerning\nvariation on the level of inflection, where the underlying structure\nof the “Why?”-question is causal. No, here again that\nunifying, model-imposing manner of proceeding would leave out a\nconsideration of the nuances that give the “Why?”-question\nits determinate sense in the first place. \n\n But again, Wittgenstein's fundamental concern here is to point out\nthe great conceptual gulf that separates aesthetic perplexities from\nthe methodology of empirical psychology. To run studies of quantified\nresponses to controlled and isolated aesthetic stimuli, where emergent\npatterns of preference, response, and judgment are recorded within a\ngiven population's sample, is to pass by the true character of the\naesthetic issue—the actual puzzlement, such as we feel it, will\nbe conceptual, not empirical. And here again we see a direct link to\nhis work in the philosophy of psychology: the penultimate passage of\nPart II of Philosophical Investigations (1958, sec. xiv), was\n“The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have\nthe means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and\nmethod pass one another by” (Wittgenstein 1958, II, iv, 232).\nHe says, near the close of this part of his lectures on aesthetics,\n“Aesthetic questions have nothing to do with psychological\nexperiments, but are answered in an entirely different way”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 17).  A stimulus-response model adapted from\nscientific psychology—what we might now call the naturalizing of\naesthetics—falsifies the genuine complexities of aesthetic\npsychology through a methodologically enforced reduction to one narrow\nand unitary conception of aesthetic engagement. For Wittgenstein\ncomplexity, and not reduction to unitary essence, is the route to\nconceptual clarification. Reduction to a simplified model, by\ncontrast, yields only the illusion of clarification in the form of\nconceptual incarceration (“a picture held us\n captive”).[5] \n\nAesthetic satisfaction, for Wittgenstein, is an experience that is\nonly possible within a culture and where the reaction that constitutes\naesthetic satisfaction or justification is both more immediate, and\nvastly larger and more expansive, than any simple mechanistic account\ncould accommodate. It is more immediate in that it is not usually\npossible to specify in advance the exact conditions required to\nproduce the satisfaction, or, as he discusses it, the\n“click” when everything falls into place. Such exacting\npre-specifications for satisfaction are possible in narrowly\nrestricted empirical cases where, for example, we wait for two\npointers in a vision examination to come into a position directly\nopposite each other. And this, Wittgenstein says, is the kind of\nsimile we repeatedly use, but misleadingly, for in truth “really\nthere is nothing that clicks or that fits anything”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 19). The satisfaction is more immediate, then,\nthan the causal-mechanistic model would imply. And it is much broader\nthan the causal-mechanistic model implies as well: there is no direct\naesthetic analogue to the matched pointers in the case of a larger and\ndeeper form of aesthetic gratification. Wittgenstein does, of course,\nallow that there are very narrow, isolated circumstances within a work\nwhere we do indeed have such empirical pre-specifiable conditions for\nsatisfaction (e.g. where in a piece we see that we wanted to hear a\nminor ninth, and not a minor seventh, chord). But, contrary to the\nempirical-causal account, these will not add up, exhaustively or\nwithout remainder, to the experience of aesthetic satisfaction. The\nproblem, to which Wittgenstein repeatedly returns in these lectures,\nis with the kind of answer we want to aesthetic puzzlement as\nexpressed in a question like “Why do these bars give me such a\npeculiar impression?” (Wittgenstein 1966, 20) In such cases,\nstatistical results regarding percentages of subjects who report this\npeculiar impression rather than another one in precisely these\nharmonic, rhythmic, and melodic circumstances are not so much\nimpossible as just beside the point; the kind of question we\nhave here is not met by such methods. “The sort of explanation\none is looking for when one is puzzled by an aesthetic impression is\nnot a causal explanation, not one corroborated by experience or by\nstatistics as to how people react…. This is not what one means\nor what one is driving at by an investigation into aesthetics”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 21). It is all too easy to falsify, under the\ninfluence of explanatory models misappropriated from science, the many\nand varied kinds of things that happen when, aesthetically speaking,\neverything seems to click or fall into place. \n\nIn the next passages of Wittgenstein's lectures he turns to a fairly\ndetailed examination of the distinct charm, for some, of\npsycho-analytic explanation, and he interweaves this with the\ndistinction between scientific-causal explanation of an action versus\nmotive-based (or personally-generated) explanations of that action. It\nis easy, but mistaken, to read these passages as simply\nsubject-switching anticipations of his lectures on Freud to\nfollow. His fundamental interest here lies with the powerful charm, a\nkind of conceptual magnetism, of reductive explanations that promise a\nbrief, compact, and propositionally-encapsulated account of what some\nmuch larger field of thought or action “really” is. (He\ncites the example of boiling Redpath, one of his auditors, down to\nashes, etc., and then saying “This is all Redpath really\nis”, adding the remark “Saying this might have a certain\ncharm, but would be misleading to say the least” (Wittgenstein\n1966, 24).  “To say the least” indeed: the example is\nstriking precisely because one can feel the attraction of an\nencapsulating and simplifying reduction of the bewildering and\nmonumental complexity of a human being, while at the same time\nfeeling, as a human being, that any such reduction to a few physical\nelements would hardly capture the essence of a person.  This, he\nobserves, is an explanation of the “This is only really\nthis” form. Reductive causal explanations function in just the\nsame way in aesthetics, and this links directly to the problems in\nphilosophical methodology that he adumbrated in the Blue and Brown\nBooks (1958a, 17–19), particularly where he discusses what\nhe there calls “craving for generality” and the attendant\n“contemptuous attitude toward the particular case”. If the\nparadigm of the sciences (which themselves, as he observes in passing,\ncarry an imprimatur of epistemic prestige and the image of\nincontrovertibility) is Newtonian mechanics, and we then implant that\nmodel under our subsequent thinking about psychology, we will almost\nimmediately arrive at an idea of a science of the mind, where that\nscience would progress through the gradual accumulation of\npsychological laws. (This would constitute, as he memorably puts it, a\n“mechanics of the soul” [Wittgenstein 1966, 29]). We then\ndream of a psychological science of aesthetics, where—although\n“we'd not thereby have solved what we feel to be aesthetic\npuzzlement” (Wittgenstein 1966, 29)—we may find ourselves\nable to predict (borrowing the criterion of predictive power from\nscience) what effect a given line of poetry, or a given musical\nphrase, may have on a certain person whose reaction patterns we have\nstudied. But aesthetic puzzlement, again, is of a different\nkind, and—here he takes a major step forward, from the\ncritical, to the constructive, phase of his lectures. He writes,\n“What we really want, to solve aesthetic puzzlements, is certain\ncomparisons—grouping together of certain cases”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 29).  Such a method, such an approach, would never\nso much as occur to us were we to remain both dazzled by the\nmisappropriated model of mechanics and contemptuous of the particular\ncase. \n\nComparison, and the intricate process of grouping together certain\ncases—where such comparative juxtaposition usually casts certain\nsignificant features of the work or works in question in higher\nrelief, where it leads to the emergence of an organizational\n gestalt,[6]\n where it shows the evolution of a style, or where it shows what is\nstrikingly original about a work, among many other things—also\nfocuses our attention on the particular case in another way. In\nleading our scrutiny to critically and interpretatively relevant\nparticularities, it leads us away from the aesthetically blinding\npresumption that it is the effect, brought about by the\n“cause” of that particular work, that matters (so that any\nminuet that gives a certain feeling or awakens certain images would do\nas well as any other). \n\nThese foregoing matters together lead to what is to my mind central to\nWittgenstein's thoughts on aesthetics. In observing that on one\nhearing of a minuet we may get a lot out of it and on the next hearing\nnothing, he is showing how easy it can be to take conceptual missteps\nin our aesthetic thought from which it can prove difficult to\nrecover. From such a difference, against how we can all too easily\nmodel the matter, it does not follow that what we get out of the\nminuet is independent of the minuet. That would constitute an\nimposition of a Cartesian dualism between the two ontologies of mind\nand matter, but in its aesthetic guise. And that would lead in turn to\ntheories of aesthetic content of a mental kind, where the materials of\nthe art form (materials we would then call “external”\nmaterials) only serve to carry the real, internal or non-physical\ncontent. Criticism would thus be a process of arguing inferentially\nfrom outward evidence back to inward content; creation would be a\nprocess of finding outward correlates or carriers for that prior\ninward content; and artistic intention would be articulated as a full\nmental pre-conception of the contingently finished (or\n“externalized”, as we would then call it) work. It is no\naccident that Wittgenstein immediately moves to the analogy to\nlanguage and our all-too-easy misconception of linguistic meaning,\nwhere we make “the mistake of thinking that the meaning or\nthought is just an accompaniment of the word, and the word doesn't\nmatter” (Wittgenstein 1966, 25). This indeed would prove\nsufficient to motivate contempt for the particular case in aesthetic\nconsiderations, by misleadingly modeling a dualistic vision of art\nupon an equally misleading dualistic model of language (Hagberg\n1995). “The sense of a proposition”, he says, “is\nvery similar to the business of an appreciation of art”\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 29). This might also be called a subtractive\nmodel, and Wittgenstein captures this perfectly with a question:\n“A man may sing a song with expression and without\nexpression. Then why not leave out the song—could you have the\nexpression then?” (Wittgenstein 1966, 32 editorial note and\nfootnote) Such a model corresponds, again, to mind-matter Cartesian\ndualism, which is a conceptual template that also, as we have just\nseen above, manifests itself in the philosophy of language where we\nwould picture the thought as an inner event and the external word or\nsign to which it is arbitrarily attached as that inner event's\noutward corresponding physicalization. It is no surprise that, in this\nlecture, he turns directly to false and imprisoning pictures of this\ndualism in linguistic meaning, and then back to the aesthetic\ncase. When we contemplate the expression of a drawn face, it is deeply\nmisleading—or deeply misled, if the dualistic picture of\nlanguage stands behind this template-conforming thought—to ask\nfor the expression to be given without the face. “The\nexpression”—now linking this discussion back to the\nprevious causal considerations—“is not an effect\nof the face”. The template of cause-and-effect, and of a dualism\nof material and expressive content (on the subtractive model), and the\nconstrual of the material work of art as a means to the\nproduction of a separately-identifiable intangible, experiential\nend, are all out of place here. All of the examples\nWittgenstein gives throughout these lectures combat these pictures,\neach in their own way. \n\nBut then Wittgenstein's examples also work in concert: they\ntogether argue against a form of aesthetic reductionism that would\npretend that our reactions to aesthetic objects are isolable, that they\ncan be isolated as variables within a controlled experiment, that they\ncan be hermetically sealed as the experienced effects of isolatable\ncauses. He discusses our aesthetic reactions to subtle\ndifferences between differently drawn faces, and our equally subtle\nreactions to the height or design of a door (he is known to have had\nthe ceiling in an entire room of the house in Vienna he designed for\nhis sister moved only a few inches when the builders failed to realize\nhis plan with sufficient exactitude). The enormous subtlety, and the\nenormous complexity, of these reactions, are a part of—and as\ncomplicated as—our natural history. He gives as an example the\nerror, or the crudeness, of someone responding to a complaint\nconcerning the depiction of a human smile (specifically, that the smile\ndid not seem genuine), with the reply that, after all, the lips are\nonly parted one one-thousandths of an inch too much: such differences,\nhowever small in measure, in truth matter enormously. \n\nBeneath Wittgenstein's examples, as developed throughout these\nlectures, lies another interest (which presses its way to the surface\nand becomes explicit on occasion): he is eager to show the\nsignificance of making connections in our perception and understanding\nof art works—connections between the style of a poet and that of\na composer (e.g. Keller and Brahms), between one musical theme and\nanother, between one expressive facial depiction and another, between\none period of an artist's work and another. Such connections—we\nmight, reviving a term from first-generation Wittgensteinians, refer\nto the kind of work undertaken to identify and articulate such\nconnections as “connective analysis”—are, for\nWittgenstein, at the heart of aesthetic experience and aesthetic\ncontemplation. And they again are of the kind that reductive causal\nexplanation would systematically miss. In attempting to describe\nsomeone's feelings, could we do better than to imitate the way the\nperson actually said the phrase we found emotionally revelatory,\nWittgenstein pointedly asks? The disorientation we would feel in\ntrying to describe the person's feeling with subtlety and precision\nwithout any possibility of imitating his precise expressive\nutterance—“the way he said it” – shows how\nvery far the dualistic or subtractive conceptual template is from our\nhuman experience, our natural history. \n\nConnections, of the kind alluded to here—a web of\nvariously-activated relations between the particular aspect of the\nwork to which we are presently attending and other aspects, other\nparts of the work, or other works, groups of works, or other artists,\ngenres, styles, or other human experiences in all their\nparticularity—may include what we call associations awakened by\nthe work, but connections are not reducible to them only (and\ncertainly not to undisciplined, random, highly subjective, or free\n associations).[7]\n The impossibility of the simplifying subtractive template emerges\nhere as well: “Suppose [someone says]: ‘Associations are\nwhat matter—change it slightly and it no longer has the same\nassociations’. But can you separate the associations from the\npicture, and have the same thing?” The answer is clearly, again\nlike the case of the singing with and then without expression above,\nnegative: “You can't say: ‘That's just as good as the\nother: it gives me the same associations’” (Wittgenstein\n1966, 34). Here again, Wittgenstein shows the great gulf that\nseparates what we actually do with, what we actually say about, works\nof art, and how we would speak of them if the conceptual\npictures and templates with which he has been doing battle were\ncorrect. To extend one of Wittgenstein's examples, we would very\nmuch doubt the aesthetic discernment, and indeed the sympathetic\nimagination and the human connectedness, of a person who said of two\npoems (each of which reminded him of death) that either will do as\nwell as the other to a bereaved friend, that they would do the same\nthing (where this is uttered in a manner dismissive of nuance, or as\nthough it is being said of two detergents). Poetry, Wittgenstein is\nshowing, does not play that kind of role in our lives, as the nature\nand character of our critical verbal interactions about it\nindicate. And he ascends, momentarily, to a remark that characterizes\nhis underlying philosophical methodology (or one dimension of it) in\nthe philosophy of language that is being put to use here within the\ncontext of his lectures on aesthetics: “If someone talks bosh,\nimagine the case in which it is not bosh. The moment you imagine it,\nyou see at once it is not like that in our case” (Wittgenstein\n1966, 34). The gulf that separates what we should say if the\ngeneralizing templates were accurate from what we in actual\nparticularized cases do say could further call into question not only\nthe applicability or accuracy, but indeed the very intelligibility, of\nthe language used to express those templates, those explanatory\npictures. Wittgenstein leaves that more aggressive, and ultimately\nmore clarifying and conceptually liberating, critique for his work on\nlanguage and mind in Philosophical Investigations (1958) and\nother writings, but one can see from these lectures alone how such an\naggressive critique might be undertaken. \n\nNear the end of his lectures Wittgenstein turns to the question of the\nattitude we take toward the work of art. He employs the case of seeing\nthe very slight change (of the kind mentioned above) in the depiction\nof a smile within a picture of a monk looking at a vision of the\nVirgin Mary. Where the slight and subtle change of line yields a\ntransformation of the smile of the monk from a kindly to an ironic\none, our attitude in viewing might similarly change from one in which\nfor some we are almost in prayer to one that would for some be\nblasphemous, where we are almost leering. He then gives voice to his\nimagined reductive interlocutor, who says, “Well there you\nare. It is all in the attitude” (Wittgenstein 1966, 35), where\nwe would then focus, to the exclusion of all of the rest of the\nintricate, layered, and complex human dimensions of our reactions to\nworks, solely on an analysis of the attitude of the spectator and the\nisolable causal elements in the work that determine it. But that,\nagain, is only to give voice to a reductive impulse, and in the brief\nensuing discussion he shows, once again, that in some cases, an\nattitude of this kind may emerge as particularly salient. But in other\ncases, not. And he shows, here intertwining a number of his themes\nfrom these lectures, that the very idea of “a description of an\nattitude” is itself no simple thing. Full-blooded human beings,\nand not stimulus-response-governed automata, have aesthetic\nexperience, and that experience is as complex a part of our natural\nhistory as any other. \n\nWittgenstein ends the lectures discussing a simple heading: “the\ncraving for simplicity” (Wittgenstein 1966, 36). To such a mind,\nhe says, if an explanation is complicated, it is disagreeable for that\nvery reason. A certain kind of mind will insist on seeking out the\nsingle, unitary essence of the matter, where—much like Russell's\natomistic search for the essence of the logic of language beneath what\nhe regarded as its misleadingly and distractingly variegated\nsurface—the reductive impulse would be given free\nreign. Wittgenstein's early work in the Tractatus (1961)\nfollowed in that vein. But in these lectures, given in 1938, we see a\nmind well into a transition away from those simplifying templates,\nthose conceptual pictures. Here, examples themselves do a\ngood deal of philosophical work, and their significance is that they\ngive, rather than merely illustrate, the philosophical point\nat hand. He said, earlier in the lectures, that he is trying to teach\na new way of thinking about aesthetics (and indeed about philosophy\nitself). \n\nThe subject, as he said in his opening line, is very big and entirely\nmisunderstood. It is very big in its scope—in the reach of the\naesthetic dimension throughout human life. \n\nBut we can now, at the end of his lectures, see that it is a big\nsubject in other senses too: aesthetics is conceptually expansive in\nits important linkages to the philosophy of language, to the\nphilosophy of mind, to ethics, and to other areas of philosophy, and\nit resists encapsulation into a single, unifying problem. It is a\nmulti-faceted, multi-aspected human cultural phenomenon where\nconnections, of diverging kinds, are more in play than causal\nrelations. The form of explanation we find truly satisfying will thus\nstrikingly diverge from the form of explanation in science – the\nmodels of explanation in Naturwissenschaften are misapplied\nin Geisteswissenschaften, and the viewing of the latter\nthrough the lens of the former will yield reduction, exclusion, and\nultimately distortion. The humanities are thus, for Wittgenstein, in\nthis sense autonomous. \n\nAll of this, along with the impoverishing and blinding superimposition\nof conceptual models, templates, and pictures onto the extraordinarily\nrich world of aesthetic engagement, also now, at the end of his\nlectures, gives content to what Wittgenstein meant at the beginning\nwith the words “entirely misunderstood”. For now, at this\nstage of Wittgenstein's development, where the complexity-accepting\nstance of the later Philosophical Investigations (1958) and\nother work is unearthing and uprooting the philosophical\npresuppositions of the simplification-seeking earlier work, examples\nthemselves have priority as indispensable instruments in the struggle\nto free ourselves of misconception in the aesthetic realm. And these\nexamples, given due and detailed attention, will exhibit a\ncontext-sensitive particularity that makes generalized pronouncements\nhovering high above the ground of that detail look otiose,\ninattentive, or, more bluntly, just a plain falsification of\nexperience. What remains is not, then—and this is an idea\nWittgenstein's auditors must themselves have struggled with in those\nrooms in Cambridge, as many still do today—another theory built\nupon now stronger foundations, but rather a clear view of our\nmultiform aesthetic practices. Wittgenstein, in his mature, later\nwork, did not generate a theory of language, of mind, or of\nmathematics. He generated, rather, a vast body of work perhaps united\nonly in its therapeutic and intricately labored search for conceptual\nclarification. One sees the same philosophical aspiration driving his\nforay into aesthetics.","contact.mail":"hagberg@bard.edu","contact.domain":"bard.edu"}]
