William took these\nwritings to pose errors dangerous to the Christian faith, and his\nphilosophical works are in large part aimed at combating their errors.\nYet at the same time he recognized their philosophical value and,\nthough often confused about their meaning, incorporated their teachings\ninto his own thought.  On many of the important issues of later\nmedieval thought, William is the first to provide in-depth discussions,\nand his voluminous works are an important and still under-appreciated\nsource for our understanding of the development of medieval\nphilosophy.\n\n\n\nAs with so many important medieval figures, we know little about\nWilliam's early years. According to one manuscript source, he was\nborn in Aurillac, in the province of Auvergne in south-central France.\nHis birth date is unknown, but since he was a professor of theology at\nthe University of Paris by 1225, a position rarely attained before the\nage of 35, he is not likely to have been born later than 1190, and\nscholars have placed his probable birth date some time between 1180 and\n1190. He may have come from a poor background, as the Dominican,\nStephen of Bourbon (died c. 1261), tells a story of William begging as\na young child (Valois 1880, 4). He was a canon of Notre Dame and a\nmaster of theology by 1223, and is mentioned in bulls of Pope Honorius\nIII in 1224 and 1225. \n\nThe story of his elevation to the episcopacy in 1228 paints a\npicture of a man of great determination and self-confidence. The\nprevious year the Bishop of Paris, Bartholomeus, had died, and the\ncanons of the chapter of Notre Dame met to select his successor. The\ninitial selection of a cantor named Nicholas did not secure unanimous\nagreement and was contested, in particular, by William. Nicholas\nexcused himself, and the canons went on to choose the Dean of the\nCathedral. William again contested the election and went to Rome to\nappeal to the Pope to vacate it. He made a favorable impression, for\nthe Pope, impressed by his “eminent knowledge and spotless\nvirtue,” as he put it (Valois, 11), both ordained him priest and\nmade him Bishop of Paris, a position he retained until his death in\n1249. \n\nIt was not long before the Pope would have regrets. In February 1229\na number of students were killed by the forces of the queen-regent,\nBlanche of Castile, when they intervened in a drunken student riot\nduring Carnival. Outraged, the masters and students appealed to\nWilliam for redress of their rights, but William failed to take action.\nThe students and masters went on strike, dispersing from Paris and\nappealing to Pope Gregory IX. It was apparently during this period that\nWilliam gave the Dominicans their first chair in theology at the\nuniversity. The Pope, who was to remark that he regretted “having\nmade this man,” rebuked William, appointed a commission to settle\nthe dispute, and ordered William to reinstate the striking\nmasters. Nevertheless, William went on to receive important\nmissions from the Pope in subsequent years, acting, for example, as a\npapal representative in peace negotiations between France and England\nin 1231. \n\nIn 1239 William was closely involved in the condemnation of the\nTalmud. The Pope had asked him for his response to a list of heresies\nin the Talmud proposed by a converted Jew, Nicholas. William's\nresponse led to a papal bull ordering the confiscation of sacred books\nfrom synagogues in 1240, and to their burning in 1242. \n\nWilliam died at the end of March (the exact date is unsure) in 1249,\nand was buried in the Abbey of St. Victor. \n\nWilliam's most important philosophical writings form part of a\nvast seven-part work he calls the Magisterium divinale et\nsapientiale, a title Teske translates as ‘Teaching on God in\nthe mode of wisdom.’ The Magisterium is generally taken\nto consist of the following seven works in the order given: \n\nWilliam did not compose the parts of the Magisterium in\ntheir rational order, and appears to have developed his conception of\nits structure as he wrote its various parts. He viewed it as having two\nprincipal parts. The first part is comprised of De Trinitate,\nDe universo, and De anima. In this, the most\nphilosophical part of the Magisterium, William proceeds by\n“the paths of proofs” or philosophizing rather than by an\nappeal to the authority of revelation. He intends in this part to\ncombat a range of philosophical errors incompatible, as he sees it,\nwith the Christian faith. In On the Trinity he develops his\nmetaphysics, attacking, among others, errors regarding creation, divine\nfreedom and the eternity of the world, and follows it with a\nphilosophical treatment of the Trinity. William's vast work,\nOn the Universe, is divided into two principal parts. The\nfirst part is concerned with the corporeal universe and is divided into\nthree parts, the first arguing for a single first principle and for the\noneness of the universe, the second taking up the question of the\nbeginning of the universe and its future state, and the third treating\nthe governance of the universe through God's providence. The\nsecond principal part is concerned with the spiritual universe, and is\ndivided into three parts concerning, respectively, the intelligences or\nspiritual beings posited by Aristotle and his followers, the good and\nholy angels, and the bad and wicked angels, that is, demons. On the\nSoul is concerned with the human soul. It is divided into seven\nparts concerning, respectively, its existence, its essence, its\ncomposition, the number of souls in a human being, how the human soul\ncomes into being, the state of the soul in the body, and the\nsoul's relation to God, with a focus on the human intellect. \n\nThe works comprising the second part of the Magisterium are\nmore expressly theological in nature and appeal to the authority of\nrevelation. Nevertheless, William continually recurs to his\nphilosophical doctrines in all his works, and even his most theological\nwritings contain material of considerable philosophical interest. In\nparticular, his treatises On Virtues and Morals and On\nFaith and Laws are of great importance for his moral\nphilosophy. \n\nScholars agree that On the Trinity is the earliest work in\nthe Magisterium and that it was probably written in the early\n1220s. Parts of other works can be partially dated by references to\ncontemporaneous events, though the sheer size of many individual works\nsuggests they were probably written over a period of years. The whole\nMagisterium itself was probably written during a period\nextending from the early 1220s to around 1240, with On the\nUniverse written in the 1230s and On the Soul completed\nby around 1240. \n\nBesides the works contained in the Magisterium, other works\nof philosophical importance are De bono et malo I (On Good\nand Evil), where William develops a theory of value; De\nimmortalitate animae (On the Immortality of the\nSoul), a companion to the treatment of immortality in On the\nSoul; and De gratia et libero arbitrio (On Grace and\nFree Choice), a treatment of the Pelagian heresy. \n\nIn addition, William wrote some biblical commentaries, a number of\nother major theological works, and a large number of sermons. For\ndetails, see Ottman 2005. \n\nMost of William's works have not been critically edited;\nseveral are extant only in manuscript form. The standard edition, which\nincludes all the works that comprise the Magisterium, is the\n1674 Orléans-Paris Opera omnia (OO). (The sermons\ncontained in this edition are by William Perrauld, not William of\nAuvergne.)  As might be expected, the texts in this old edition\nare often in need of correction; Teske has conjectured many corrections\nin his translations. \n\nThe reader of William's philosophical works is struck by their\ndifference in character from the mainstream of philosophical and\ntheological writing of the early thirteenth century. Whereas\nWilliam's contemporaries tend to compose works as a series of\nlinked questions, each treated according to the question method (a\nparadigm of which is Aquinas's later Summa theologiae),\nWilliam instead follows the practice of Avicenna and Avicebron and\ncomposes treatises much more akin to a modern book. Indeed, William\neven models his writing style to some degree on the Latin translations\nof these authors. These features, together with William's\nfrequent use of analogies, metaphors and examples drawn from everyday\nlife, his long-winded, rambling prose and frequent digressions, his\nharsh assessments of opponents as imbeciles or morons, and his urging\nthat proponents of dangerous doctrines be wiped out by fire and sword,\nmake for an inimitable and immediately recognizable style. \n\nOne of the costs of this style, however, is that at times it can be\nhard to tell precisely what William thinks. Too often he lets metaphors\nor analogies bear the argumentative burden in lieu of more careful\nanalysis. And while William's inventive mind could generate\narguments for a position with ease, their quality is uneven: often he\nproposes problematic arguments without appearing to recognize the\ndifficulties they contain, as may be apparent below to the discerning\nreader, while at other times he shows an acute awareness of the\nfundamental problems an issue raises. \n\nWilliam was one of the first thinkers in the Latin West to begin to\nengage seriously with Aristotle's writings on metaphysics and\nnatural philosophy and with the thought of Islamic and Jewish thinkers,\nespecially Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, 980–1037) and Avicebron\n(Solomon Ibn Gabirol, 1021/2–1057.8). The works of these thinkers,\nwhich had been coming into circulation in Latin translations from\naround the middle of the twelfth century, presented both philosophical\nsophistication and theological danger. Indeed, in 1210, public and\nprivate lecturing on Aristotle's works on natural philosophy and\ncommentaries on them was forbidden at Paris, and in 1215 the papal\nlegate, Cardinal Robert of Courçon forbade “masters in arts\nfrom ‘reading,’ i.e., lecturing, on Aristotle's books\non natural philosophy along with the Metaphysics and\nSummae of the same (probably certain works of Avicenna and\nperhaps of Alfarabi)” (Wippel 2003, 66). This prohibition\nremained in effect until it unofficially lapsed around 1231.\nNevertheless, it must be emphasized that personal study of these texts\nhad not been forbidden, and William clearly worked hard to master them.\nHe came to be keenly aware of the incompatibility of much of the\nteaching of these works with Christian doctrine, yet at the same time\nhe found them to be a source of philosophical inspiration, and his\nthought brims with ideas drawn from Avicenna and Avicebron. His\nattitude to these thinkers is expressed well in a passage in On the\nSoul, where, regarding Aristotle, he writes that: \n\nOf course, William was also strongly influenced by Christian\nthinkers. In particular, his writings are permeated by the thought of\nSaint Augustine, whom William refers to as “one of the more noble\nof Christian thinkers,” if perhaps in a less obvious way than by\nthe thought of Avicenna. Indeed, as the list in Valois 1880, 198–206, attests,\nWilliam employs a remarkable range of sources and must be reckoned one\nof the most well-read thinkers of his day. \n\nThe focus of the following outline is William's views on\nmetaphysics and the soul, but even within these limits the vast range\nof his thought has required that many issues in these areas not be\ntreated. In a future supplement, William's views on value theory\nand morality will be addressed. Teske's English translations are\nquoted whenever possible; otherwise, translations are my own. \n\nWilliam is the first thinker in the Latin West to develop a\nsystematic metaphysics based on the concepts of being (esse)\nand essence (essentia). Influenced by Boethius and Avicenna,\nhe develops this metaphysics in his early work, On the\nTrinity, as a preliminary to his account of the Trinity, and he\nreturns to it in other works, especially On the Universe. The\ncentral theme of his metaphysics is that all existing things, besides\nGod, are composites of essence, on the one hand, and their being or\nexistence, on the other, which is said to be acquired or partaken from\nGod, the source of all being. God, in contrast, involves no composition\nof essence and being, but is his being. \n\nInspired by Boethius's distinction in De hebdomadibus\nbetween what is good by participation and what is good by substance,\nWilliam works these ideas out in terms of a distinction between a being\n(ens) by participation and a being by substance or\nessence. \n\nBy the essence of a thing William means what is signified by its\ndefinition or species name; he often refers to essence as a\nthing's quiddity (literally, “whatness”), which he\nidentifies with Boethius's notion of quod est or\n“that which is.” He identifies a thing's being\n(esse) or existence with Boethius's notion of quo\nest or “by which it is.”  In the case of a being\nby participation, its essence and features incidental to its essence\nare distinct from its being; William describes its being as clothed by\nthem or as what would be left if they were stripped away. Such a being\nis said to participate in or acquire its being. At times William,\nfollowing Avicenna, speaks of its being as accidental to it. He terms\nthe being (esse) possessed by a being by participation as\nbeing by participation. \n\nA being (ens) by substance, in contrast, does not\nparticipate in or acquire being but is its very being: “there is\nalso the being whose essence is for it being (esse) and whose\nessence we predicate when we say, ‘It is,’ so that it\nitself and its being (esse) … are one thing in every\nway” (Switalski 1976, 17; Teske and Wade 1989, 65). William\ndescribes the being (esse) of a being by substance as being by\nsubstance or being by essence. \n\nWilliam also notes that the term “being” (esse)\nmay be used to mean a thing's essence, but this sense of\n“being” plays a minor role in his thought. \n\nWilliam argues that there must be a being by essence; otherwise, no\nbeing could be intelligible. Thus, if there were just beings by\nparticipation, there would have to be either a circle of beings each\nof which participates in the being of what is prior to it in the\ncircle, with the absurd consequence that a thing would ultimately\nparticipate in its own being; or else there would have to be an\ninfinite series of beings, each member of which participates in the\nbeing of what is prior in the series. But then, for a member of the\nseries—say, A—to be, would be for it to have\nor participate in the being of B; and for B to be,\nin turn, would be for it to have or participate in the being\nof C, and so on. But if this were so, the being of no member\nof the series could be intelligible, since any attempt to spell it out\nwould result in an account of the form: A's\nhaving B's having C's having ad\ninfinitum. Since being is intelligible, William concludes that\nthere is a being by essence. \n\nBesides the distinctions between a being and being by participation\nand a being and being by essence, William mentions sixteen other\ndistinctions, including the distinctions between being of need and\nbeing of sufficiency, possible being and being necessary through\nitself, false being and true being, and flowing being and lasting\nbeing. William takes these distinctions to be coextensive with the\ndistinction between being by participation and being by essence. Using\na form of argument drawn from Avicenna, he argues that given the first\nmember of each distinction, we can prove the existence of the\nsecond. \n\nThe distinction between possible being and being necessary through\nitself, which William draws from Avicenna, plays a prominent role in\nWilliam's thought. William's notion of a possible is not\nthat of something that exists in some possible world, but is rather the\nnotion of something whose essence neither requires nor rules out its\nhaving being. William treats such possibles as in some sense prior to\nbeing. In the case of those that have being and thus actually exist, he\nholds that the possible “and its being (esse), which\ndoes not belong to it essentially, are really two. The one comes to the\nother and does not fall within its definition or quiddity. Being\n(ens) [i.e., a being] in this way is, therefore, composite and\nalso resolvable into its possibility, or quiddity, and its being\n(esse)” (Switalski 1976, 44; Wade and Teske, 87). Some\ncommentators see in such remarks the idea that a real or\nmind-independent distinction obtains between being and essence in\npossible beings. \n\nIn contrast, the being and essence of a being necessary through\nitself are not two; such a being does not participate in being but is\nits being and cannot but exist. \n\nWilliam argues there can be only one being by substance or being\nnecessary through itself. Speaking from a metaphysical point of view,\nhe follows Avicenna and calls it the First. Speaking as a Christian, he\nidentifies it with God, the creator, as he thinks is indicated by\nBiblical references to God as “he who is”:\n“being,” he says, is a proper name of God. \n\nThe uniqueness of a being by substance is, William argues, a\nconsequence of its absolute simplicity, since nothing could\ndifferentiate two or more absolutely simple beings. The absolute\nsimplicity of a being by substance, in turn, is a consequence of the\nfact that it cannot be caused (not, at least by an external causation;\nWilliam argues that the being by substance is the Christian Trinity of\npersons and he admits a kind of internal causation in the Trinity). For\neverything that is caused is other than its being and thus is a being\nby participation, whereas a being by essence or substance is its\nbeing. But a composite or non-simple being must have an external\ncause, and must therefore be a being by participation. Therefore, the\nbeing by substance, that is to say, God, cannot be composite, but must\nbe absolutely simple. \n\nGod's absolute simplicity also entails that he is neither a\nuniversal (i.e., neither a genus nor species), nor an individual falling\nunder such. For, William argues, genera and species are themselves\ncomposite, and the individuals that fall under them have a quiddity or\ndefinition and therefore compositeness. Nevertheless, William thinks\nGod is an individual, since he holds that all that exists is either a\nuniversal or an individual (OO I, 855ab). \n\nWilliam appeals to God's power to show God has will and\nknowledge. He argues that God must be omnipotent: he cannot be forced\nor impeded and has a “two-way” power, identified by William\nwith what Aristotle calls a rational power. This is a power that\n“extends to both opposites, namely, to make and not to\nmake” (Switalski 1976, 57; Teske and Wade 1989, 99), in contrast\nwith something, such as fire, which when “it encounters what can\nbe heated is not able to heat or not to heat . . . but it\nnecessarily has only the power to heat” (Switalski 1976, 54;\nTeske and Wade 1989, 97).  However, because a two-way power\nis poised between acting and not-acting, it must be inclined to acting\nby something, and William thinks this can only be through a choice.\nTherefore, God must have will and choice; and since “it is\nimpossible that there be will and choice where there is no\nknowledge” (Switalski 1976, 59; Wade and Teske 1989, 101), God\nmust also have knowledge. William goes on to argue that God must indeed\nbe omniscient, since “his wisdom is absolute and free, not bound\nin any way to things, nor dependent upon them” (Switalski 1976,\n61; Teske and Wade 1989, 102). \n\nWilliam takes his claim that God has a two-way power to imply that\nGod could have known or willed otherwise than he did. But, as William\nrealizes, this raises the difficulty that if God had known or willed\notherwise, it would seem that he would have been different, and this\nseems to be impossible given his absolute simplicity. In response,\nWilliam frequently emphasizes that by the very same act of knowing or\nwill by which God in fact knows or wills one thing, he could have known\nor willed something else (OO I, 780a; Teske 2007, 105). Thus, when we\nsay “God knows or wills X,” we must distinguish the act of\nknowing or willing, which is identical with God and utterly the same in\nevery possible situation, from the object X to which it is related. \n\nAccording to William, everything participates in or acquires its\nbeing from God.  But just what he means by this is less than\nclear. At times, as in the following passage from On the\nUniverse, he seems to suggest that God is literally present in\ncreated things as their being: \n\nYet William realizes that such statements may give an incorrect\nimpression of his thought. Thus, at one point in On the\nUniverse he writes that “every substance includes, if\nit is proper to say so (si dici fas est), the creator's\nessence within itself” (OO I, 920b), and he goes on to note that\nit is difficult to state clearly the sense in which the creator is in\ncreatures. In other passages he emphasizes God's transcendence of\ncreatures: “the first being (esse) is for all things\nthe being (esse) by which they are … It is one\nessence, pure, solitary, separate from and unmixed with all\nthings.” Often he appeals to an analogy with light: the first\nbeing fills “all things like light cast over the universe.  By\nthis filling or outpouring it makes all things reflect it. This is\ntheir being (esse), namely to reflect it” (Switalski\n1976, 45; Teske and Wade 1989, 89). William perhaps intends in such\nremarks to exploit the medieval view that a point of light\n(lux) and the light emitted from that point (lumen),\nthough distinct, nonetheless are also in some deep sense the same. \n\nRegarding the procession of creatures from God, Willliam is\nconcerned to attack a range of errors. In On the Universe 1.1\nhe attacks the error of the Manichees. Though he refers to Mani, the\nthird-century originator of the Manichee sect, he seems chiefly\nconcerned with the Cathars of his day. The Manichees deny God is the\nultimate source of all things and instead posit two first principles,\none good and one evil. Only in this way, they think, can we explain the\npresence of both good and evil in the world. William thinks a\nfundamental motivation for this view is the principle that “from\none of two contraries the other cannot come of itself” (OO I,\n602a; Teske 1998a, 54), and hence that evil cannot come from good but\nmust stem from its own first principle. He replies that although one\ncontrary cannot of itself (per se) be from the other, it is\nperfectly possible for it to be from the other incidentally (per\naccidens), and he gives everyday examples to illustrate. Thus,\n“drunkenness comes from wine. In that case it is evident that an\nevil comes from a good, unless one would say that wine is not\ngood” (OO I, 602a; Teske 1998a, 54). Likewise, there is a\nsense in which evil is ultimately from God, though incidentally and not\nas something God aims at or intends as such. The evil of sin, for\nexample, is a consequence of God's creating creatures with free\nwill and permitting their misuse of it. \n\nWilliam offers a host of arguments against the possibility of two\nfirst principles. On metaphysical grounds, for example, he objects that\na first principle must be a being necessary through itself, and that he\nhas shown that a plurality of such beings is impossible. And he gives\narguments to the effect that the notion of a creative first evil principle is\nincoherent. Such a being, for example, could not do good for anything,\nand hence could not have created anything, for in doing so it would\nhave done good for what it created. \n\nWilliam claims “the creator alone properly and truly is worthy\nof the title ‘cause,’ but other things are merely\nmessengers and bearers of the last things received as if sent from the\ncreator” (OO I, 622a; Teske 1998a, 92). We speak of creatures as\ncauses, but William says this is “ad sensum”\n(Switalski 1976, 79; Teske and Wade 1989, 117), that is, in respect of\nhow things appear in sense experience.  Both medieval and\ncontemporary commentators have on the basis of such remarks attributed\nto William the denial that creatures are genuine causes (see Reilly\n1953). Certainly he denies that any creature can exercise fully\nindependent causal agency, a view he thinks “the\nphilosophers” have adopted. But this claim is compatible\nwith admission of genuine secondary causes that are reliant for their\nexercise of causation on the simultaneous activity of prior causes, and\nultimately on that of the first cause, God. Is William simply making\nthis point but using the term “cause” in a more restricted\nmanner than his contemporaries? A negative answer is suggested by\nWilliam's rationale for his usage. He thinks of causation as the\ngiving of being, and he thinks that anything that receives being, and\ntherefore all creatures, cannot itself give being but can merely\ntransmit it. Moreover, his metaphors of creatures as riverbeds or\nwindows through which the divine causal influence flows strongly\nsuggest that he really does wish to hold that creatures themselves do\nnot really bring anything about but are simply the conduits through\nwhich divine causality flows. \n\nWhether in fact William admits genuine causal agency among\ncreatures, he clearly thinks that God alone can create from nothing.\nThus, he rejects Avicenna's so-called “emanationist”\ndoctrine of creation, according to which, as he puts it, God creates\nfrom nothing only one thing, the first intelligence (or spiritual\nbeing), which in turn creates the next intelligence, and so on until\nthe tenth or agent intelligence is reached, the creator of souls and\nthe sensible world. William thinks one ground of this doctrine is\nAvicenna's principle that from what is one insofar as one can\nonly come what is one (OO I, 618b; Teske 1998a, 82), and hence from\nGod, who is absolutely one, can at most come one thing. In fact,\nWilliam agrees with this principle, but thinks Avicenna has misapplied\nit. Instead, he follows the Jewish thinker, Avicebron (whom he thought\nwas a Christian) and holds that creatures come from God not insofar as\nhe is one, but “through his will and insofar as he wills, just as\na potter does not shape clay vessels through his oneness, but through\nhis will” (OO I, 624a; Teske 1998a, 96). \n\nWilliam thinks the will is necessarily free; thus the fact that God\ncreates through his will means that creation is an exercise of\nGod's free will. This point serves to undermine another aspect of\nAvicenna's doctrine of the procession of creatures from God. For\nAvicenna posits not only a series of creators, but also holds that this\nprocession is utterly necessary: the actual world must exist and could\nnot have been other than it is.  William thinks this conclusion\nstems from a failure to grasp God's freedom in creation. Avicenna\nand others imposed “not only necessity, but natural servitude\nupon the creator, supposing that he operates in the manner of\nnature” (OO I, 614b; Teske 1998a, 72). Thus, they think the\nuniverse issued from God as brightness issues from the sun or heat from\nfire, and that God no more had it in his power to do otherwise than do\nthe sun or heat. Against this William argues that it is a consequence\nof God's free creation that he had it in his power to create\notherwise than he did. \n\nOne of the most contentious doctrines presented by Greek and Islamic\nphilosophy to thinkers in the early thirteenth century is that of the\neternity of the world, the view that the world had no beginning but\nexisted over an infinite past. This view seems to contradict the\nopening words of the Bible: “In the beginning God created heaven\nand earth.” In response, a number of thinkers in the early\nthirteenth century, including the Franciscan Alexander of Hales, argued\nthat Aristotle, at least, had been misunderstood and had never proposed\nthe eternity of the world. But William, like his Oxford contemporary,\nRobert Grosseteste, would have none of this: “Whatever may be\nsaid and whoever may try to excuse Aristotle, it was undoubtedly his\nopinion that the world is eternal and that it did not begin to be, and\nhe held the same view concerning motion. Avicenna held this after\nhim” (OO I, 690b; Teske 1998a, 117). \n\nThe importance of this issue to William is indicated by the space he\ndevotes to it. His treatment of the question of the eternity of the\nworld in On the Universe 1.2 is one of the longest discussions\nof the issue in the middle ages, and the first substantial treatment to\nbe made in the light of Greek and Islamic thought. \n\nWilliam thinks, in fact, that to call the world eternal in the\naforementioned sense is not to use the term “eternal” in\nits strictest sense. Accordingly, he starts by explaining different\nsenses of the term in the first extended treatment of the distinction\nbetween eternity and time in the middle ages. He then presents and\nrefutes arguments that the world has no beginning, and provides his own\npositive arguments that the world must have a temporal beginning, a\nfirst instant of its existence. \n\nWilliam's chief aim in his treatment of time and eternity is\nto emphasize the fundamental differences between eternity and time. He\nis especially concerned to attack a conception of eternity as existence\nat every time, a conception he attributes to Aristotle. In his view,\neternity in a strict sense is proper to the creator alone and is his\nvery being, though “the name ‘eternity’ says more\nthan his being, namely, the privations of beginning and ending, as well\nas of flux and change, and this both in act and in potency” (OO\nI, 685b-686a; Teske 1998a, 109). The fundamental difference between\ntime and eternity is that “as it is proper and essential to time\nto flow or cease to be, so it is proper and essential to eternity to\nremain and stand still” (OO I, 683b; Teske 1998a, 102). William,\nlike other medieval thinkers, tends to describe eternity in terms of\nwhat it is not. It has nothing that flows and hence no before or after\nor parts. Its being is whole at once, not because it all exists at one\ntime, but because it all exists with nothing temporally before or after\nit. William speaks of duration in eternity, but he holds that the term\nhas a different (unfortunately unexplained) sense in this context than\nwhen applied to time. \n\nWilliam had read Aristotle's Physics and agrees with\nAristotle that time and motion are coextensive (OO I, 700a). Yet he\ndoes not propose Aristotle's definition of time as the number of\nmotion in respect of before and after. Rather, in his account of the\nessential nature of time he describes time simply as being that flows\nand does not last, “that is, it has nothing of itself that lasts\nin act or potency” (OO I, 683a; Teske 1998a, 102). Echoing\nAristotle and Augustine, he holds that time has the weakest being, and\nthat “of all things that are said to be in any way, time is the\nmost remote from eternity, and this is because it only touches eternity\nby the very least of itself, the now itself or a point of time”\n(OO I, 748a). \n\nWilliam introduces his account of the eternity of the world in\nOn the Universe by reference to Aristotle, but he devotes the\nbulk of his discussion to Avicenna's arguments for this\ndoctrine. In parallel material in On the Trinity he\nclaims that at the root of Avicenna's view lies the principle\nthat “if the one essence is now as it was before when nothing\ncame forth from it, something will not now come forth from it”\n(Switalski 1976, 69; Teske and Wade 1989, 108). That is, nothing new is\ncaused to exist unless there is a change in the cause. Thus God, a\nchangeless being, cannot start to create the world after not creating\nit; and therefore he must have created it from eternity and without a\nbeginning. Therefore, the world must itself lack a beginning. \n\nWilliam replies that Avicenna's principle leads to an infinite\nregress; for if something's operating after not operating\nrequires a change in it, this change will itself require a new cause,\nand that new cause will itself require a new cause, and so on ad\ninfinitum. William instead holds that it is possible that God,\nwithout changing in any way, start to operate after not operating. What\nWilliam means by this is that the effect of God's eternal will is\na world with a temporal beginning. In general, he holds that verbs such\nas “create” express nothing in the creator himself but\nrather something in things. We might put “God begins to create\nthe world” to have the import of: “God by an eternal\nwilling creates the world, and the world has a beginning.” \n\nWilliam emphasizes that God does not will that the world exist\nwithout qualification, but rather that it exist with a given temporal\nstructure, namely, a beginning (Switalski 1976, 67–68; Teske and Wade\n1989, 107). This might suggest that he thinks God might in fact have\ncreated a world without a beginning, but chose not to do so, as Aquinas\nwould hold. But in fact, William argues that this option was not open\nto God: a world without a beginning is simply not a creatable item.\nWilliam attempts to establish this point by a host of arguments, many\nof which are found in his writings for the first time in the Latin West\nand repeated by later thinkers such as Bonaventure and Henry of Ghent.\nOn the whole, these arguments either allege that the notion of a\ncreated thing itself entails that what is created has a temporal\nbeginning or point to alleged paradoxes stemming from the supposition\nof an infinite past. \n\nFor example, William argues (OO I, 696b; Teske 1998a, 133) that\nbecause the world in itself is merely a possible, in itself it is in\nnon-being and non-being is therefore natural to it. Hence its\nnon-being, being natural to it, is prior to its being, and therefore in\nbeing created it must receive being after non-being, and thus have a\nbeginning. \n\nAmong arguments involving infinity, William argues that if the whole\nof past time is infinite then the infinite must have been traversed to\narrive at the present; but since it is impossible to traverse the\ninfinite (OO I, 697b; Teske 1998a, 136), the past must be finite. This\nline of argument is frequently found in later thinkers. \n\nWilliam also presents arguments that the view that a continuum, such\nas time, is infinite results in paradoxes (OO I, 698a-700b). These\narguments, which William develops at some length, constitute an\nimportant early medieval engagement with puzzles relating to\ninfinity. \n\nPart 1.3 of On the Universe is a lengthy treatise on\nGod's providence. William believes the denial of God's\nprovidence, and in particular the denial that the good will be rewarded\nand the evil punished, is an error “so harmful and so pernicious\nfor human beings that it eliminates from human beings by their roots\nall concern for moral goodness, all the honor of the virtues, and all\nhope of future happiness” (OO I, 776a; Teske 2007, 92). \n\nAccording to William, God's providence or providing for the\nuniverse differs from foreknowledge in that, unlike foreknowledge, it\nembraces only goods and not also evils. William is especially concerned\nto argue that God's providence is not just general in nature, but\nextends to all individual creatures. \n\nGod's care for the universe and its constituents is a matter\nof God's knowing and paying attention to all things. From\nGod's point of view, nothing happens by chance. The universe is a\nteleological or goal-directed order, in which each thing has a function\nor purpose established by God. God's care is his concern that\neach thing fulfills its appointed function. Thus, God is not\nnecessarily concerned with what we might think is best for individual\nthings: flies get eaten by spiders, but this in fact is an end for\nwhich they were created. In the case of human beings, however,\nwho are the apex of creation, their end is to experience happiness in\nunion with God, and God's providential care of human beings is\naimed at this. \n\nBut if this is so, why do the evil prosper and the good suffer? What\nare we to make of natural disasters, of pain, suffering, death, and the\nlike? What, in short, are we to make of evil in the world? Although\nWilliam does not take up the logical compatibility of evil with an\nall-good, knowing and powerful god, he does attempt to explain at\nlength how a range of particular kinds of evil are compatible with\nGod's providence and care for human beings. His explanation, in\ngeneral, is not novel and has roots in Augustine. He distinguishes the\nevils perpetrated by free agents and for which they are therefore to\nblame from other forms of evil, and argues that these other evils are\nin fact not really evil but good. Pain, for example, provides many\nbenefits, among which is that it mortifies and extinguishes “the\nlusts for pleasures and carnal and worldly desires” (OO I, 764a;\nTeske 2007, 58). In many cases, what we call evil is in fact\nGod's just punishment, which William implies always has\nbeneficial effects. As for the blameworthy evils done by free agents,\nWilliam thinks that God permits these, but that it is incorrect to say\nthey come from God or are intended by him. They are rather the\nconsequence of rational creatures’ misuse of the free will with\nwhich they were created, and the moral balance will be set right in the\nfuture life, if not this one. \n\nIf the evils of this life appear to conflict with God's\nprovidence, God's providence and foreknowledge themselves seem to\nentail that everything occurs of necessity and hence that there is no\nfree will. This concern leads William to consider a number of doctrines\nthat aim to show that all events happen of necessity. In addition to\nforeknowledge or providence, he considers the views that all events are\nthe necessary causal outcomes of the motion and configuration of the\nheavenly bodies, or that all events result from the\n“interconnected and incessantly running series of causes and the\nnecessary dependence of one upon another” (OO I, 785a; Teske\n2007, 120); or finally, that all things happen through fate. William\nrejects all these grounds for the necessity of events. \n\nIn an interesting discussion of foreknowledge, he considers the\nargument that since it is necessary that whatever God foresees will\ncome about will come about, because otherwise God could be deceived or\nmistaken, then since God foresees each thing that will come about, it\nis necessary that it will come about. William replies that the\nproposition “It is necessary that whatever God foresees will\ncome about will come about” has two interpretations,\n“because the necessity can refer to individuals or to the\nwhole” (OO I, 778b; Teske 2007, 99). The argument for the\nnecessity of all events equivocates between these two readings and is\ntherefore invalid. William notes that the distinction he makes is\nclose to the distinction between a divided and composite sense, but he\nis critical of those who instead distinguish an ambiguity between\na de re (about the thing) and de dicto (about what\nis said) reading. \n\nWilliam's treatise On the Soul is one of the most\nsubstantial Latin works on the topic from before the middle of the\nthirteenth century. Although William begins this treatise with\nAristotle's definition of the soul as the perfection of an\norganic body potentially having life, his conception of the soul is\nheavily influenced by Avicenna and decidedly Platonic in character. He\ninterprets Aristotle's definition to mean that the body is an\ninstrument of the soul (as he thinks the term “organic”\nindicates) and that “a body potentially having life” must\nrefer to a corpse, since a body prior to death actually has life. \nAnd although he calls a soul, with Aristotle, a form, unlike Aristotle\nhe holds that a soul is in fact a substance, something individual,\nsingular and a “this something” (hoc aliquid), not\nat all dependent on the body for its existence. \n\nWilliam adopts the standard view that souls serve to vivify or give\nlife to bodies, and thus he posits not just souls of human beings\n(i.e., rational souls), but also those of plants and animals\n(vegetative and sensitive souls respectively), as they all have living\nbodies. But in the case of the human soul, William also\nidentifies the soul with the human being, the referent of the pronoun\n“I.” \n\nAmong William's many arguments for the existence of souls is\nthe argument that bodies are instruments of souls and the power to\ncarry out operations through an instrument cannot belong to the\ninstrument itself. Thus, there must be something other than the bodies\nof living things that operates by means of bodies, and this is their\nsoul. In the case of the human or rational soul, he argues that its\nexistence follows in particular from the fact that understanding and\nknowledge are found in a human being but not in the whole body or any\npart of it. Since these are operations of a living substance, there\nmust be a living incorporeal substance in which they are, and this is\nwhat people mean when they speak of their soul. \n\nThese arguments serve not only to show the existence of souls, but\nalso that they are substances. In the case of the human soul, William\nargues, the operations of understanding and knowing must be treated as\nproper operations of the soul, and this requires that the soul itself\nbe a substance. To the objection that the soul itself does not\nliterally understand or know but is instead that thanks to which a\nhuman being can understand and know, William will argue that the soul\nand human being, which he equates with the referent of the pronoun\n“I,” are one and the same thing. More generally, the\nsubstantiality of souls—and not just of human souls—is\nindicated by the fact that bodies are their instruments. \n\nWilliam argues at length that a soul cannot be a body, a conclusion\nhe applies not just to human or rational souls, but also to those of\nplants and animals. In the case of human souls, he uses, among others,\nAvicenna's “flying-man” argument to establish this\npoint, arguing that a human being flying in the air who lacks and never\nhad the use of his senses would know that he exists but deny that he\nhas a body. Therefore “it is necessary that he have being that\ndoes not belong to the body and, for this reason, it is necessary that\nthe soul not be a body” (OO II suppl., 83a; Teske 2000, 91). \n\nMore generally, William argues that no body could perform the\nsoul's function of giving life to the body. For example, if a\nbody were to give life, it would itself have to be a living body, and\nthus it would itself have to have a soul that rendered it alive. This\nsoul, in turn, would have to be a living body and thus have its own\nsoul, and so on ad infinitum. Thus, the doctrine that souls\nare bodies leads to an infinite regress. \n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of William's teaching about the soul\nis his identification of the human soul with the human being and his\ndenial that the human body constitutes in whole or part the human\nbeing. Instead, William describes the body variously as a house, the\nsoul its inhabitant; as a prison, the soul its captive; as a cloak,\nthe soul its wearer, and so on. Nevertheless, the definition of a\nhuman being—he perhaps has in mind the Platonic conception of\nthe human being as “a soul using a body”—involves\na reference to the body, and it this, William thinks, that has led\npeople to believe that the body is a part of a human being. But this\nis an error akin to thinking that because a horseman is defined by\nreference to a horse, the horse must therefore be a part of the\nhorseman. William is aware, of course, that at times we do seem to\nascribe to ourselves, and thus to the human being, the acts of the\nbody or things that happen to the body, but he holds that these are\nnon-literal modes of speaking, akin to a rich man's complaint that he\nhas been struck by hail, when in fact it was his vineyard that was\nstruck. \n\nWilliam, as usual, offers numerous arguments for the identification\nof the soul and human being. He argues that the body cannot be a part\nof a human being, since the soul and body no more produce a true unity\nthan, for example, a carpenter and his ax, and a human being is a true\nunity. And he notes that since the soul is subject to reward and\npunishment in the afterlife for actions we correctly attribute to the\nhuman being or ourselves, it must be identified with the human being.\nHe also points to cases where our use of names or demonstratives\nreferring to human beings must be understood as referring to their\nsouls, and concludes that this shows that human beings are their\nsouls. \n\nAccording to William, souls are among the simplest of created\nsubstances. Nevertheless, like all created substances, they must\ninvolve some kind of composition. This composition cannot be a bodily\ncomposition, of course, since they are not bodies and thus cannot be\ndivided into bodily parts. According to Avicebron, as well as some of\nWilliam's contemporaries, souls are composite in the sense that\nthey are composites of form and matter, though not a matter that\ninvolves physical dimensions, but rather what some called\n“spiritual matter.” This view is part of the doctrine now\ntermed “universal hylomorphism,” according to which every\ncreated substance is a composite of form and matter (see Weisheipl\n1979). William is one of the first to reject this doctrine; he is later\nfollowed by Aquinas. In support of his rejection, in On the\nUniverse he makes one of his rare references to Averroes, citing\nwith approval his claim that prime matter is a potentiality only of\nperceptible substances and hence is not found in spiritual substances.\nHe also argues that there is no need to posit matter in angels or souls\nin order to explain their receptivity in cognition, as some had thought\nnecessary (OO I, 851b-852b). Rather, souls and other spiritual\nsubstances are “pure immaterial forms” without matter. \n\nWilliam also denies a real plurality of powers in the soul. He holds\ninstead that each power of the soul is identical with the soul and not\na part of it. When we speak of a power of the soul, we are really\nspeaking of the soul considered as the source or cause of a certain\nkind of operation. Thus, the power to understand characteristic of a\nhuman or rational soul is the soul considered as a source or cause of\nthe operation of understanding. \n\nWhat sort of composition, then, is to be found in souls and other\nspiritual beings? William holds that every being other than God \n\nHere William uses Boethius's language of quod est and\nquo est to make the point that in souls, as in all created\nsubstances, there is, to use Avicennian terms, a composition of being\nand essence, a doctrine to be developed by Aquinas. \n\nBesides rejecting universal hylomorphism, William also rejects the\ndoctrine of a plurality of souls in a human being. This doctrine, which\nwas popular among Franciscan thinkers, holds that the body of a human\nbeing is informed not just by a single soul, the rational soul, but\nalso by a vegetative and a sensitive soul. This multiplicity of souls,\nit is held, serves to explain how human beings have the vital\noperations characteristic of plants and animals in addition to\npeculiarly human ones, and also explains the development of the\nfetus's vital functions. Against this doctrine, William claims to\nhave shown earlier in On the Soul that not only the operation\nof understanding, but also the sensitive operations of seeing and\nhearing “are essential and proper to the soul itself” (OO\nII suppl., 108b; Teske 2000, 164) and “hence, it cannot be denied\nexcept through insanity that one and the same soul carries out such\noperations.” Rather than posit a multiplicity of souls, William\nholds that higher souls incorporate the kinds of operations attributed\nto lower ones. The rational soul is infused into the body directly by\nGod when the fetus reaches a suitable stage of organization, and the\nprior animal or sensitive soul in the fetus ceases to be. In this case\ntoo a view along similar lines was to be developed by Aquinas. \n\nScholars have noted, however, that while William rejects a plurality\nof souls in the human body, he does subscribe to a version of the\ndoctrine of a plurality of substantial forms in the sense that he\ntreats the human body as itself a substance independent of its\nassociation with the soul, and hence having its own corporeal form,\nwhile also being informed by the human or rational soul, which renders\nit a living thing. (For details see Bazán 1969.) \n\nAccording to William, the immortality of the human soul would be\nevident if not for the fact that the soul has, as it were, been put to\nsleep by the corruption of the body stemming from the punishment for\nsin. In our current state, however, William thinks the human\nsoul's immortality can be shown by means of philosophical\narguments, to which he devotes considerable attention, both in On\nthe Soul and in a shorter work, On the Immortality of the\nSoul. \n\nHe believes the error that the soul is naturally mortal\n“destroys the foundation of morality and of all religion”\n(Bülow 1897, 1; Teske 1991, 23), since those who believe in the\nmortality of the soul will have no motive for acting morally and\nhonoring God. Thus, he notes that if the soul is not immortal, the\nhonor of God is pointless in this life, since in the present life it\n“involves much torment and affliction for the soul”\n(Bülow 1897, 3; Teske 1991, 25) and receives no reward. \n\nFrom a metaphysical point of view, William argues that the soul does\nnot depend on the body for its being, and therefore the destruction of\nthe body does not entail the non-existence of the soul. The rational\nsoul's independence from the body is due to the fact it is a\nself-subsistent substance whose proper operations do not involve or\nrequire a human body. \n\nSince William takes the souls of plants and animals to be\nincorporeal substances, it might be thought that he would treat them as\nimmortal too. But William holds that these souls cease to exist upon\nthe death of the plant or animal. This is because all their proper\noperations, unlike those of the rational soul, depend on the body, and\nthus there would be no point for their continued existence after the\ndestruction of the body. \n\nCharacteristic of human souls, or human beings, are the intellective\nand motive powers, that is to say, the intellect and will. William\nthinks that of these, the will is by far the more noble power, and he\nis accordingly puzzled by the fact that neither Aristotle nor Avicenna\nhave much to say about it. These authors do, however, discuss the\nintellective power at great length, and William accordingly devotes\nconsiderable attention to combating errors he sees in their teachings\non the intellect. \n\nWilliam develops his account of the will using the metaphor of a\nking in his kingdom. The will “holds the position in the\nwhole human being and in the human soul of an emperor and king,”\nwhile “the intellective or rational power holds the place and\nfunction of counselor in the kingdom of the human soul”  (OO\nII suppl. 95a; Teske 2000, 126, 129). William treats acts of \nwill—expressed in the indicative mood by “I will”\n(volo) or “I refuse” (nolo)—as a kind\nof command that cannot be disobeyed, as distinguished from mere likings\nexpressed in the form “I would like” (vellem) or\n“I would rather not’ (nollem). He holds that as a\nking must understand in order to make use of his counselors’\nadvice, so the will must not simply be an appetitive power but must\nalso have its own capacity to apprehend. Likewise, the intellect must\nhave its own desires. But he notes in On Virtues, that like a\nking the will need not heed the advice of its counselor; it may instead\n“give itself over to the advice of its slaves, that is, the inner\npowers and the senses”; in so doing it “gives itself over\ninto becoming a slave of its slaves and is like a king … who\nfollows the will and advice of senseless children” (OO I,\n122a). \n\nWilliam frequently emphasizes the difference between voluntary\naction and the actions of brute animals. Animals operate in a\n“servile” manner, in the sense that they respond to their\npassions without having control over these responses. A human being, in\ncontrast, has power over the suggestion of its desires; its will is\n“most free and is in every way in its own power and\ndominion” (OO II suppl., 94a; Teske 2000, 123). This is why human\nbeings, unlike animals, can be imputed with blame or merit for their\ndeeds. \n\nAccording to William, the freedom of the will consists in the fact\nthat the will “can neither be forced in any way to its proper\nand first operation, which is to will or refuse, nor prevented from\nthe same; and I mean that it is not possible for someone to will\nsomething and entirely refuse that he will it or to refuse to will\nsomething, entirely willing that he will it” (OO I, 957aA). In\nother words, William defines force and prevention of the will in terms\nof higher-order volitions and refusals: for the will to be forced is\nfor it to refuse to will X and nonetheless be made to\nwill X, and for it to be prevented is for it to will to will\nX and be made to refuse X. In a number of works,\nWilliam argues that neither force nor prevention of the will is\npossible: if someone refuses to will X, this must be because\nhe takes X to be bad and thus he must refuse X\nrather than will it; and if someone wills to will X, this\nmust be because he takes X to be good, and thus he must\nwill X rather than refuse it. \n\nWilliam's discussions of the intellective power are driven by a\nconcern to attack errors he sees in his contemporaries and Greek and\nIslamic thinkers. While his reasons for rejecting these errors are\nclear enough, if at times based on a confused understanding of his\nsources, his own views on the nature of cognition are less well\ndeveloped. Yet it is clear that, with the exception of our knowledge\nof first principles and the concepts they involve and certain cases of\nsupernaturally revealed knowledge, William wishes to present a\nnaturalistic account of cognition in this life in which God plays no\nspecial role. \n\nIn both On the Soul and On the Universe William\nattacks at length theories of cognition that posit an agent intellect\nor agent intelligence. He incorrectly ascribes the latter theory to\nAristotle, although in fact it is Avicenna's teaching; he ascribes the\nformer theory to certain unnamed contemporaries. These theories view\ncognition as involving the active impression of intelligible signs or\nforms—what we might call concepts—on a receptive or\npassive recipient. The agent intellect or agent intelligence is taken\nto perform this function of impressing intelligible forms on our\nmaterial intellect, which is so-called because like\nmatter it is receptive of forms, albeit intelligible forms. The chief\ndifference between the agent intellect and agent intelligence, as far\nas the theory of cognition is concerned, is that the former is treated\nas a part of the human soul, while the latter is taken to be a\nspiritual substance apart from the human soul, identified with\nAvicenna's tenth intelligence. William notes how the agent intellect\nor agent intelligence is viewed by analogy with light or the sun; as\nlight or the sun through its light serves to render actual merely\npotentially existing colors, so the agent intellect or intelligence\nserves to render actual intelligible forms existing potentially in the\nmaterial intellect. \n\nWilliam as usual offers a large number of objections to these\ntheories. He attacks as inappropriate the analogies with light or the\nsun, and argues that the theory of the agent and material intellects is\nincompatible with the simplicity of the soul, as it posits these\nintellects as two distinct parts of the soul, one active and one\nreceptive. In the case of both the agent intellect and the agent\nintelligence, he argues that their proponents will be forced to hold\nthe absurd result that human beings know everything that is naturally\nknowable, whereas in fact we must study and learn and observe in order\nto acquire much of our knowledge. \n\nAs for his own views on the intellective power, William holds that,\nlike all the powers of the soul, the intellective power in the present\nlife of misery has been corrupted. Therefore an account of it must\ndistinguish its operation in its pure, uncorrupted state from its\noperation in the present life. In its pure state it is capable of\nknowing, without reliance on the senses, everything naturally knowable,\neven sensible things, and thus presumably also is capable of possessing\nthe concepts in terms of which such knowledge is formulated. In its\npresent state, however, most of its knowledge and repertoire of\nconcepts stems in some manner from sense experience. \n\nThe knowledge of which the intellective power is naturally capable\nextends not just to universals, but also to singulars. For the\nintellect is naturally directed at the true as the will is at the\ngood, and has as its end knowledge of the first truth, the creator,\nwho is singular. William also notes our knowledge of ourselves and the\nimportance of singular knowledge for our dealings with the\nworld. Unfortunately, he provides no theory of the nature of singular\ncognition, and this issue must be left on the agenda until taken up by\nthinkers such as Scotus and Ockham in the late thirteenth and early\nfourteenth centuries. \n\nWilliam proposes a representationalist theory of cognition. He holds\nthat it is not things or states of affairs themselves that are in the\nintellective power but rather signs or intelligible forms that serve to\nrepresent them. He takes these signs to be mental habits, that is to\nsay, not bare potentialities but potentialities most ready to be\nactualized. Propositions are those complexes formed from signs through\nwhich states of affairs are represented to the mind. Although\nWilliam speaks of these signs as likenesses, he is well aware of\nthe difficulty in thinking of concepts as such, and he concludes that\nin fact there need not be a likeness between a sign and that of\nwhich it is a sign (OO II suppl. 214b; Teske 2000, 454). \n\nA key question William confronts is how we acquire concepts and\nknowledge in the present life. In On the Soul he draws an\nimportant distinction. In the case of the first rules of truth and\nmorality, he speaks of God as a mirror or book of all truths in which\nhuman beings naturally and without an intermediary, and thus without\nreliance on sense experience, read these rules. Likewise, God impresses\nor inscribes on our intellective power the intelligible signs in terms\nof which these first rules or principles are formulated. Thus, William\nposits at least some innate concepts; he notes, for example, in On\nVirtues and Morals   that the concept of the true\n(veri) is innate (OO I, 124a). God also reveals to some\nprophets in this life “hidden objects of knowledge to which the\ncreated intellect cannot attain except by the gift and grace of divine\nrevelation” (OO II suppl., 211b; Teske 2000, 445). \n\nDoes William therefore hold, as some have held (Gilson 1926), that\nat least in the case of these rules God in some special manner\nilluminates the human intellect? This might be suggested by his\nreferences to the intellective power as spiritual vision and his\nfrequent use of the language of vision and illumination in his accounts\nof cognition. And yet, according to William, the first rules of truth\nand morality are “known through themselves” or\nself-evident. They are “lights in themselves  …\nvisible through themselves without the help of something else”\n(OO II suppl., 210b; Teske 2000, 443), and they serve to illuminate to\nthe intellect the conclusions drawn from them. God's role, it\nwould seem, is to impress upon or supply to our intellect, in some way,\nthese principles, but William gives no indication that he takes God to\nshed a special light on these principles in order that they may be\nknown: once possessed they are, as it were, self illuminating. \n\nThe first rules of truth and morality and the concepts in terms of\nwhich they are formulated form only a small subset, however, of our\ncognitive repertoire. The remainder of our concepts and knowledge,\nleaving to one side the special divine revelation made to prophets,\nstems in some way from our dealings with the sensible world. But the\nproblem William faces is to explain how this is so. The problem, he\nsays, is that “sensation … brings to the intellect\nsensible substances and intellectual ones united to bodies [i.e.,\nsouls]. But it does not imprint [pingit] upon it their\nintelligible forms, because it does not receive such forms of\nthem” (OO II suppl., 213a; Teske 2000, 449). \n\nWilliam's response to this problem is to hold that the senses have the\nrole simply of stimulating the intellective power in such a way that\nit “forms on its own and in itself intelligible forms for\nitself” (OO 1, 914b), a doctrine he draws from\nAugustine. According to this account, the intellect is fundamentally\nactive in the acquisition of intelligible forms. William speaks of the\nintellect as able, under the prompting of the senses, to consider the\nsubstances that underlie sensible accidents, and speaks of the\nintellect as “abstracting” from sense experience in the\nsense that it forms concepts of so-called “vague\nindividuals” by stripping away perceptible features that serve\nto distinguish one individual from another. In these cases, William\nsays, “the intellect is occasionally inscribed by these forms\nthat are more separate and more appropriate to its nature” (OO\nII suppl., 213b; Teske 2000, 450). \n\nA third cognitive process William mentions, conjunction or\nconnection, is concerned not with the acquisition of intelligible\nforms, but rather with how knowledge of one thing brings with it\nknowledge of another. In particular, William argues that knowledge of a\ncause brings with it knowledge of the effect. \n\nWilliam is particularly concerned, however, that his account of the\nintellect's generation of intelligible forms will require a division\nof the intellect into active and passive parts—the very\ndistinction between an agent and material or receptive intellect he\nhas devoted so much energy to attacking. The need to make this\ndivision of the intellect into two part is because it is impossible\nfor the same thing to be both active and passive in the same respect,\nand yet in treating the intellect as indivisible it looks as though\nWilliam is in fact committed to its being both active and passive in\nthe same respect in the formation and reception of intelligible\nforms. \n\nWilliam's attempts to resolve this problem are repeated in a number of\nworks and couched in highly metaphorical language that poses severe\nproblems of interpretation.  The intellective power is both “a\nriverbed and fountain of the scientific and sapiential waters …\nHence, in one respect it overflows and shines forth on itself, and in\nanother respect it receives such outpouring or radiance” (OO II,\nsuppl. 216b; Teske 2000, 457). William holds that because on this\naccount the intellective power is not active and passive in the\nsame respect, he is not forced to divide the intellect into two\ndistinct parts, one active and one passive. \n\nScholars have devoted little attention to William's influence on later\nwriters. Nevertheless, it is clear that he gave rise to no school of\nthought, and subsequent thinkers seem to have picked and chosen from\nhis works the parts they would accept and the parts they would\nreject. Thus, William's arguments that the world must have a beginning\nprobably influenced thinkers such as Bonaventure and Henry of Ghent,\nwhile his rejection of universal hylomorphism and his metaphysics of\nbeing and essence may have influenced Aquinas, who presents similar\nviews. There is also little doubt that some of William's views were\nthe subject of criticism, as for example his apparent denial of\ngenuine secondary causation (see Reilly 1953). The large body of\nmanuscripts in which William's works survive suggests he was being\nread throughout the middle ages; Ottman 2005, for example, lists 44\nmanuscripts known to contain On the Universe. William's works\nwere also published in a number of printed editions in the\n16th and 17th centuries."}]
