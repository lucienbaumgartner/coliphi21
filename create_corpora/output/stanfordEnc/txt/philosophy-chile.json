Very few\nphilosophers ventured beyond the walls of academic or religious\ninstitutions (usually one and the same) during the entire colonial\nperiod, which ended in most Spanish American countries (the exceptions\nbeing Cuba and Puerto Rico) in the early nineteenth century. Even\nafter Independence, philosophy remained a fundamentally academic\nendeavor. Chile, in contrast to other nations in the region, has shown\nremarkable institutional continuity, with the exception of the years\nof military rule in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\n\nThe academic context in which the discipline developed, however, has\nnot prevented philosophers from engaging in social and political\nactivities, and, especially, in debates concerning the history,\nculture and direction of the emerging nations. Philosophers have been\nimportant political figures since the early republic as well as\nleaders in the university reform processes that have taken place\nduring the country’s modern history. During the period of\nmilitary rule (1973–1990) several became important opponents of\nthe regime. A concern for politics, in fact, has dominated the agenda\nof philosophers, including those who have denounced the encroachment\nof politics in the discipline.\n\n\nThe centrality of politics, even in cases of direct involvement in it,\nhas not distracted philosophers from their essential commitment to\nexploring different philosophical (predominantly European) schools,\nsome specific fields within the discipline, such as logic and\nmetaphysics, and some thematic concerns like the role of religion in a\nsecular state, the impact of modernity on self and society, and the\nrole of universities in the development of nationhood. Chilean\nphilosophy is characterized by a constant tension between academic\npursuits solely informed by developments within the discipline, and\ncritical outlooks that demand a closer philosophical engagement with\npolitics and society.\n\nWhile one cannot speak properly of a “Chilean philosophy”\nuntil the former colony declared its independence from Spain in\nFebruary 1818, it would not be appropriate to ignore the activities of\nseveral philosophers during the Spanish colonial period. Philosophical\nactivity made a first appearance with the teachings of\nCristóbal de Valdespino in the Dominican convent in Santiago in\n1595, spread quickly to other secondary schools in the seventeenth\ncentury, and picked up momentum with the creation of the Royal\nUniversity of San Felipe in 1758. Prominent scholars during this time,\nand up to the early nineteenth century include clergymen Alonso\nBriseño, Miguel de Viñas, Manuel Ovalle, and Manuel\nAntonio Talavera, all of whom wrote significant philosophical\ntreatises mostly within the scholastic tradition. The expulsion of the\nJesuits in 1767 meant that several talented authors, including Miguel\nde Olivares, Felipe Gómez de Vidaurre, Juan Ignacio Molina and\nManuel Lacunza, published their works elsewhere. The main difference\nbetween the two traditions resides in that the former cultivated\nphilosophy as an instrument to address theological questions whereas\nthe latter were more oriented to practical concerns, such as\nunderstanding the conditions of the New World, and were therefore less\ninterested in theological questions. Lay authors who covered some\nphilosophical themes reflecting the concerns of the Enlightenment\nduring the late colonial period included Manuel de Salas and Juan\nEgaña, who served as bridges to the post-independence\nperiod. \nBut it is with the foundation of Chile as an independent republic that\nChilean philosophy began to be cultivated in a systematic manner\nwithin institutions of higher education entrusted with a deliberate\nnational purpose. Five major periods characterize the history of the\ndiscipline: the formative years from Independence through 1865; the\nascendancy and decline of Positivism from 1865 through 1920; the\nanti-positivist reaction from 1920 to 1950; the rise and critique of\nprofessionalization from 1950 to 1973, and the fate of philosophy\nunder military rule, from 1973 to 1990. These periods coincide roughly\nwith the major stages in the development of philosophy in other\ncountries in the region. The period since 1990, when Chile returned to\ndemocratic rule, is much more difficult to trace and define. And yet,\nthe main foundations of the discipline have not changed in any\nsubstantial way. \nPhilosophers in the immediate post-independence period, and up to the\narrival of Positivism in the 1860s, had to confront the complexities\nof the changing relations between Church and State. The independence\nstruggle which pitted Chileans against Chileans had been a struggle\nagainst arbitrary and unstable colonial rule, not against the Catholic\nChurch. On the contrary, the Church was seen as an indispensable ally\nin the building of new republican institutions. Hence, all Chilean\nconstitutional documents in the nineteenth century proclaimed\nCatholicism as the official religion of the State. As a result, public\ninstitutions, including educational institutions, had to conform to\nCatholic doctrine. Because most philosophers were believers this\nlimitation did not necessarily mean a problem. But as philosophers\nthey were compelled to examine doctrines and schools that were secular\nor even antagonistic to Catholicism. In such cases they discussed the\ndoctrines but suppressed that which could be seen as beyond the pale\nof the Catholic Church. As a result, a thinker like David Hume could\nbe commented upon but in the end heavily criticized because of his\nskepticism. A school such a French Idéologie could be\ndiscussed, but again deprived of its most materialistic edges. The\noutlet for philosophical production was by and large the secondary\nschool textbook, which had to be approved by the appropriate\ngovernmental mechanisms, and this usually meant applying Catholic\nChurch criteria for the philosophically permissible and the\ntheologically acceptable. There was no room for openly anti-Catholic\ntracts such as Francisco Bilbao’s Sociabilidad chilena\n(1844, collected in 1866), which ended up burnt for blasphemy and\nimmorality. \nPhilosophers still found ways to be true to their discipline, and yet\nrecognize the constraints imposed by Catholicism as the official\nreligion of the State. Perhaps the best example is the work of\nAndrés Bello (1781–1865), who explored a wide range of\nphilosophical sources, especially those of the Scottish Enlightenment.\nHowever, he never questioned the importance of religion in general,\nand Catholicism in particular. His Filosofía del\nentendimiento was published posthumously in 1881, but substantial\nparts of this work appeared in the 1840s. \nBello’s Filosofía shows an important\nacquaintance, and much agreement, with the work of Thomas Reid, Thomas\nBrown, and Dugald Stewart. Bello’s main emphasis in this work\nwas the acquisition of ideas, which he considered the central endeavor\nof the discipline. His work was divided in two parts, namely,\npsychology and logic. For Bello, philosophy’s task was the\nappropriate understanding of the origin of ideas, and the guiding of\nhuman actions. In the process, Bello engaged the thought of John Locke\nand George Berkeley seriously, although by no means uncritically. The\nimpact of Bello’s philosophical work was limited at first, but\nit spread rapidly to other countries in the region in the twentieth\ncentury, and became one of the few works by a Latin American\nphilosopher to be fully translated into English (1984). \nAnd yet, perhaps the most important, in the sense of the most widely\nused philosophical text in Chile was the Curso de filosofía\nmoderna by Ramón Briseño (1814–1910),\npublished in two volumes in 1845–46. Compared to Bello’s\ncontribution, Briseño’s work was far more partial to\nCatholicism, and thus had an easy entry into the curricula of public\nand private schools. Multiple editions appeared during the remainder\nof the nineteenth century. Briseño’s partiality to an\nidea of philosophy closely linked to religion is evident in his\ncoverage of ethics and natural law, where he argued that the practice\nof religion was the most important duty of a human being, and\nconcluded that “any philosophy that does not lead to the\nconclusions of Christianity is dangerous and false” (1846: 216).\nWhile Andrés Bello did not entirely disagree with the religious\nemphasis of the work, he objected to the poor coverage of logic, which\nin Briseño’s treatment was limited to deductive logic.\nHence it can be observed that the larger polemic concerning the role\nof religion was manifest in the choice of subfields for the teaching\nof the discipline. \nAlthough philosophy developed in an academic context in the post\nindependence period, and helped define the mission of the University\nof Chile when it was founded in 1842 (Andrés Bello crafted the\nstatutes of the institution and became its Rector for the next 23\nyears), other philosophers brought the discipline closer to political\naction. The most important example is José Victorino Lastarria\n(1817–1888) who advocated the elimination of the colonial\nlegacies still embedded in the Church, and in authoritarian practices\nthat prevented free individual initiative and expression. Be it\nthrough his congressional seat, his role as founder of the Liberal\nParty (1849), or his copious writings, Lastarria promoted the main\ntenets of liberalism and articulated a coherent philosophy of history\nfirmly based on Enlightenment thought. Other thinkers who contributed\nto the development of liberal views in Chile included the Argentine\nexiles Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (1811–1888) and Juan Bautista\nAlberdi (1819–1884), who presented their ideas in various widely\ncirculated writings, some of them of a philosophical nature, and\nthrough vigorous polemics in the press. \nAs elsewhere in Latin America, Positivism in Chile had a significant\nimpact in a number of areas, including philosophy. The arrival of\nPositivism coincided with the rising tide of anticlericalism in Chile\nfrom the 1860s and the 1880s, but its influence was not restricted to\nattacks against the Church. Indeed, it had a profound influence in\neducation, contributing to a substantial transformation of the\ncurriculum at the secondary and higher education levels. Initially,\nhowever, it was a timely weapon against the influence of the Church in\nChilean society. \nThe fundamental appeal of Positivism was through its notion of\n“progress”. Based on Auguste Comte’s work,\nPositivism allowed anticlerical thinkers to dismiss the\n“theological” stage as a primitive state in the evolution\nof humanity, one that would inevitably be superseded by the\n“metaphysic” and “scientific” stages. The\npolitical implications and uses of this evolutionary view were\nobvious: to advance to the highest level, Chileans needed to leave\nbehind the religious influence of the Catholic Church. As articulated\nby the leading early proponent of Positivism, José Victorino\nLastarria, who abandoned his liberal commitments (for being based on\nabstract, or “metaphysical”, principles), science could\naddress the problems of Chilean society in the most effective way.\nOthers heeded the call, and concentrated on such important priorities\nas education. The liberal historian Diego Barros Arana had done much\nin this regard through reforms of the curriculum at the Instituto\nNacional, as did Miguel Luis Amunátegui, who, in his role as\nMinister of Education, in 1879 formally introduced the teaching of\nscience in public schools. But the most significant\npositivist figure was Valentín Letelier\n(1852–1919), whose Filosofía de la\neducación (1927 [1891]) served as the basis for a profound\nreorientation of philosophical studies in Chile. In his view, the\ntheological and metaphysical emphases that had dominated Chilean\neducation since independence had done little to unify the country\naround a core of shared beliefs. In his view, only the certainties of\nscience could do that. The instrument for achieving this higher stage\nwas logic, which he successfully introduced in the educational plan of\n1893, at the expense of ethics and theodicy. Consistent with this\nemphasis, Juan Serapio Lois (1844–1913) published the most\ncomplete treatment of logic from a Comtean perspective, the\nElementos de filosofía positiva (1906–1908),\napplying logical analysis to the methodology of a range of\nsciences. \nPhilosophy under the influence of Letelier acquired a scientific\ncharacter, with a special emphasis on experimental psychology that\nwould ultimately provoke a reaction among thinkers dissatisfied with\nthe local unresponsiveness to new currents of thought emerging in\nEurope and the United States. Positivism, however, did help in\nconsolidating the study of philosophy at both the higher level\n(through the Instituto Pedagógico at the Universidad de Chile),\nand at secondary schools, where it was an obligatory subject of\nstudy. \nAlthough it was less influential, it is important to point out that\nthere was another branch of Positivism represented by the brothers\nJuan Enrique (1852–1927) and Jorge Lagarrigue (1854–1894),\nwho embraced the religious ideas of the late Auguste Comte and brought\nthe Religion of Humanity to Chile. Although this variety of Positivism\nsurvived well into the twentieth century, it left little influence in\nthe field of philosophy. Politically, it was aligned with the\npresidentialist and allegedly authoritarian administration of\nJosé Manuel Balmaceda, who was defeated in the Civil War of\n1891. As in the case of Comte’s support of Louis Bonaparte, the\nLagarrigue brothers’ brand of positivism came to be associated\nwith authoritarianism. \nThe revolt against Positivism in Chile was led by Enrique Molina\n(1871–1964), a graduate of the Positivist-inspired Pedagogical\nInstitute at the University of Chile. Molina found the study of\nphilosophy stagnant, and considered the emphasis on science stifling.\nHe initially shared the school’s emphasis on a scientific\napproach to the teaching of several disciplines, including philosophy.\nHowever, after encountering the work of William James and, especially,\nHenri Bergson, Molina launched a philosophical campaign to establish\nmetaphysics as the most important field within the discipline. In his\nview, the positivist concept of “progress” had come to\nmean material, and specifically technological, progress. In his most\nimportant philosophical work, De lo espiritual en la vida\nhumana (1937), Molina argued that science and technology had done\nlittle to advance human happiness. Therefore, an emphasis on the life\nof the spirit (though not in a religious sense) deserved to become the\ncentral endeavor of the discipline as well as its main contribution to\nsociety. He developed a hierarchy of values where those of a spiritual\nnature reigned over crass materialistic concerns. \nMolina’s argument was by no means devoid of a political edge. He\nargued that after Positivism Marxism had become the main conduit for\nthe spread of materialistic concerns. In the Chile of the middle\ndecades of the twentieth century, Marxism had indeed made major\ninroads into the country, and Molina was part of a generation of\nphilosophers who were alarmed by the threat represented by Marxist\nideology. His response was the advancement of philosophical views that\nplaced metaphysics at the top of a hierarchy of fields. He then set\nout to reorient the study of philosophy in the country through his\nwritings and institutional activities, including the rectorship of the\nUniversity of Concepción, which he founded in 1919. \nIn disciplinary terms, Molina’s arguments found resonance among\nCatholic thinkers like Clarence Finlayson (1913–1954), and the\nmore secularly inclined Jorge Millas (1917–1982), whose Idea\nde la individualidad (1943) was entirely free of any ties to\nPositivism, emphasizing instead individual liberty as the principal\nconcern of the discipline. Although Millas retained a high level of\npolitical engagement throughout his career, he viewed individual\nliberty as a higher stage of human existence beyond the externalities\nof society and politics. \nThe institutional expression of such views was a succession of changes\nin the philosophy curriculum that incorporated new authors and new\nschools of thought such as phenomenology, existentialism, and\nneo-Thomism. In 1929, Pedro León Loyola created a Center for\nPhilosophical Studies at the University of Chile, and in 1931 a major\nuniversity reform placed the Pedagogical Institute, the home of\nphilosophical studies, at the more academically oriented Faculty of\nPhilosophy. Philosophy was also taught at the Universidad de\nConcepción and at the Catholic University of Chile (founded in\n1888). The latter institution created an Academy of Philosophy in\n1923, and a Pedagogical School in 1943 where courses on ontology,\ntheodicy and ethics were offered. By 1950, it added courses on\nepistemology, metaphysics and aesthetics. Increased philosophical\nactivity translated into the creation of the Chilean Society of\nPhilosophy (Sociedad Chilena de Filosofía) in 1948,\nand the launching of the Revista de Filosofía the next\nyear. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War\nmeant that several philosophers arrived in Chile as refugees in the\n1940s, adding to the increased variety of philosophical concerns. \nDespite the diversity, the main consensus among Chilean philosophers\nwas that the discipline was autonomous, especially from politics.\nIndividual philosophers could and did have political commitments, but\nthey all agreed that the field was a highly specialized academic\nendeavor. They entered the phase that Argentine philosopher Francisco\nRomero named “philosophical normalcy”, which was\ncharacterized by university-level positions, publications in\nspecialized journals, international conferences, teaching stints in\nforeign institutions and, above all, a strong divide separating\nacademic philosophical activity from social and political\nconcerns. \nThe philosophical model established in reaction to Positivism\nblossomed in the 1950s as a result of the activities of the Chilean\nSociety of Philosophy, the regular publication of the Revista de\nFilosofía, and the internationalization of the\nphilosophical community. The society was recognized by the\nInter-American Federation of Philosophical Societies, the Institut\nInternational de Philosophie, and the Fedération International\ndes Sociétés de Philosophie. Foreign faculty taught\nregularly at the major philosophy departments in the country, and in\n1956 the first international congress of the Inter-American Society of\nPhilosophy took place in Santiago, featuring such prominent figures as\nMiguel Reale, Eduardo Nicol, Risieri Frondizi, Francisco Romero,\nJosé Gaos and José Ferrater Mora. Presenters in the\nfields of logic, philosophy of science and theory of knowledge\nincluded Willard Van Orman Quine, Roderick Chisholm, Mario Bunge,\nFrancisco Miró Quesada, and Juan David García Bacca. The\nlocal philosophical community could celebrate with pride the\neffectiveness with which the discipline had become a recognized\nprofessional endeavor both nationally and internationally. \nInitially, a new generation of philosophers embraced the high\ninternational standards of philosophical work proclaimed by the\nChilean philosophical community. In addition to Jorge Millas, new\nnames appeared steadily in publications and other professional venues:\nFélix Schwartzmann (1913–2014), Marco Antonio Allendes\n(1925–2000), Humberto Giannini (1927–2014), Juan de Dios\nVial Larraín (1924–2019), Gastón Gómez Lasa\n(1926–2019), and Juan Rivano (1926–2015). However, not all\nthought that the professional model was the only, or indeed the most\nappropriate for the conditions of Chile at the time. Some had come\nfrom diverse disciplinary backgrounds or interests, and therefore\nbecame skeptical of a model of philosophical activity that appeared to\nbe excessively subservient to international (mainly European)\ncurrents, and perhaps even irrelevant for the country. Juan Rivano, in\nparticular, developed a devastating critique of the levels of\nabstraction he found in the philosophical community, and questioned\nthe distance of his colleagues from the concerns of the nation. Coming\nfrom the field of logic, he questioned the lack of consistency in the\nusage by his colleagues of several key philosophical concepts. He also\nintroduced the work of British neo-Hegelians such as Francis H.\nBradley and Harold Joachim, but soon moved to the study of Hegel and\nMarx in such works as Entre Hegel y Marx (1962) and Desde\nla religión al humanismo (1965). He advocated a type of\nphilosophical work that was both critical of social and economic\nconditions, and more responsive to the complex changes taking place in\nChile and Latin America. \nThe wider philosophical community rejected the claims of Rivano and\ndismissed his call for bringing the discipline in line with the needs\nof the nation. They not only reinforced the foundations of\nphilosophical professionalism but also proceeded to develop a spirited\ndefense of a university model that sheltered the work of professionals\nfrom the demands of the larger society. The rapid expansion of the\nelectorate, the emergence of strong parties of the Left, and the\nexpansion of higher education enrollments all introduced pressures for\nuniversity reform which the defenders of philosophical professionalism\nresisted. In terms of philosophical schools, they continued to engage\nphenomenological themes, and particularly the work of Martin\nHeidegger. The critique of modernity was the dominant theme among\nphilosophers in their specialized work. \nThe most articulate voice from the professionalist camp came from\nJorge Millas who, following the Spanish philosopher José Ortega\ny Gasset, was a strong critic of mass society. In such works as\nEnsayos sobre la historia espiritual de Occidente (1960) and\nEl desafío espiritual de la sociedad de masas (1962),\nMillas reiterated the claim that spirituality occupied a higher place\nthan materialism, and especially Marxism, in the concerns of the\ndiscipline. What was new in the context of the 1960s was the\nconnection he made between the aims of the discipline and those of the\nuniversity: both had the obligation to resist the pressures of mass\nsociety. Others who followed this line of argument, like Félix\nMartínez Bonati (1929), and Juan de Dios Vial Larraín,\nemphasized the role of the university in forming an intellectual elite\ninspired by the higher aims of philosophy. They anticipated, in many\nways, the arguments of Allan Bloom in The Closing of the American\nMind (1987). \nSuch debates on the nature of higher education and the responsibility\nof philosophers merged with political competition inside the most\nimportant universities of the country. Philosophers who claimed to be\napolitical or who opposed the encroachment of politics in university\ncampuses paradoxically became a part of openly political debates.\nSignificant university reforms were introduced in the latter half of\nthe 1960s but the debates on the nature of higher education and the\naims of philosophy did not diminish. What did diminish was the level\nof philosophical production, which dropped consistently through the\nyears of the Salvador Allende administration (1970–1973). The\nRevista de Filosofía ceased publication in 1970,\nclasses were frequently interrupted, and books of a philosophical\nnature were reduced to a trickle. Perhaps the most important\nexceptions are to be found in a handful of philosophers, especially\nJorge Millas, whose two-volume Idea de la filosofía\nwas published in 1970. The philosophical community was deeply divided\nas a result of political turmoil and disputes over the aims of the\nuniversity. \nThe military coup of September 11, 1973 led by General Augusto\nPinochet was followed by sixteen and a half years of dictatorship. The\nproclaimed intent of the coup was to reestablish order after the\nchaotic years of the Allende administration. Within a few years,\nhowever, it was obvious that the regime intended to transform Chilean\nsociety and politics, closing the Congress, banning political parties,\nespecially those of the Left, and introducing a new Constitution in\n1980. In the area of higher education, the military regime reversed\nyears of university autonomy and intervened directly in the\nadministration of the principal universities of the country: it\nappointed as Rectors military officers on active duty, closed several\nschools and faculties, and purged academics and students perceived to\nbe dissidents or potential opponents. The military as an institution\ndid not act alone, as it counted on a significant number of civilian\nsupporters. \nThe Department of Philosophy at the University of Chile was perhaps\nthe hardest hit among philosophy departments in the nation. As the\nflagship public university, with a history going back to 1842, the\nUniversity of Chile was from the start of the military regime the\ntarget of severe and continuous repression. Critics like Juan Rivano\nwere arrested and sent into exile while others, like Edison Otero\n(1946), were dismissed without charges. The military placed the\nUniversity of Chile first under the aegis of the Air Force and\nsubsequently (1976) the Army. But instead of relying on those\nprofessionals who had opposed university reform, like Jorge Millas,\nHumberto Giannini, or Gastón Gómez Lasa, it placed\nlargely unknown though sympathetic philosophers in key academic and\nadministrative positions. As a result, professional philosophers\nbecame increasingly alienated from the regime and some turned into\nvocal opponents. \nPerhaps the most important example is that of Jorge Millas. Initially\nhe was hopeful that the military would indeed seek to realize his\nideal view of the university as a home of reflection and reason. By\n1976, however, his hopes had turned into disillusion: Millas attacked\nthe military intervention of the universities, declaring that there\nwas no improvement from the politicization of higher education in the\n1960s and early 1970s; the university had become an institution\n“under surveillance” (1981: 84). His own philosophical\nwork paid increasing attention to the theme of violence, as he\ndemonstrated in La violencia y sus máscaras (1978),\nco-authored with critical philosopher Edison Otero, a collaboration\nthat signaled a rapprochement between the two historical philosophical\ntraditions in the country. Isolated and increasingly alienated by\ngovernment censorship, Millas retreated to the southern Universidad\nAustral in Valdivia, where he was initially welcomed but soon removed\n(1980) for his increasingly public and vocal criticisms of the regime.\nIn one of his last works, Idea de la Universidad (1981), he\nrenewed his life-long commitment to the university as the site of\nscholarship and reflection, and reiterated his critique of military\nintervention. Silenced, isolated and ill, he died at the age of 65 in\n1982. \nOther philosophers were not as vocal as Millas, but were clearly\nunhappy with the military handling of both the universities and the\nnation. Established philosophers like Humberto Giannini and\nGastón Gómez Lasa concentrated on their philosophical\nwork, and on occasion made pronouncements that could be seen as\ncritical. But the environment of repression was not conducive to the\ndialogue and free inquiry that they felt the field required. Exiled\nphilosophers like Juan Rivano were even less able to find national\noutlets for their opinions. He was banned from the country and unable\nto return until after the plebiscite of 1988. That was the turning\npoint that unleashed the transition to democracy that culminated with\nthe presidential elections of 1989, and the inauguration of the\nPatricio Aylwin administration in 1990. \nThe balance of the period is negative for the philosophers involved\nexcept for those who occupied the positions of those persecuted under\nmilitary rule and who remained in their posts even after the\nrestoration of democracy. Still, an important change took place as a\nresult of the years of dictatorship: those philosophers who were\nhostile to politics now fully embraced the value of democracy with all\nits implications for accommodating different points of view. As a\nresult of the hostile climate present at the universities, many\nmigrated to independent research centers and thus entered into\ndialogue with scholars from other disciplines. Philosophers were thus\nable to break away from the separation of philosophy and politics that\ncharacterized the foundations of the field in the twentieth\ncentury. \nAnother important element to emerge from the period of military rule,\nand perhaps even before, is the number of philosophers who moved\nabroad in response to political turmoil, like Roberto Torretti (1930)\nand Carla Cordua (1925), or because of outright persecution as in the\ncase of Juan Rivano and Renato Cristi (1941). There is a significant\nphilosophical production that must be included in a longer-term\nexamination of the history of the field in Chile. There are others of\na younger generation who were trained abroad and whose work upon\nreturning to the country started to have an impact in the field. \nSince the return to civilian rule in 1990, the field of philosophy has\nconfronted numerous challenges, such as new national priorities (human\nrights, economic growth, constitutional reforms, erosion of\ninstitutional legitimacy), the fragmentation of the field due to the\nproliferation of new private universities, and an unsuccessful attempt\nby the National Council of Education to remove philosophy from the\nsecondary school curriculum (2018). At the same time, philosophy has\nflourished in other respects, thanks to the continued production of\nthe previous generation (Roberto Torretti, Carla Cordua, Renato Cristi\nand Marcos García de la Huerta) or the posthumous publications\nof Jorge Millas, Juan Rivano and Humberto Giannini. Until his death in\n2017 Jorge Eduardo Rivera (born 1927) remained as the most important\nspecialist on Heidegger. Pablo Oyarzún (1950) has made\nsignificant contributions to aesthetics and literary criticism,\nRecently, Andrés Claro (1968) has emerged as a powerful new\nphilosophical voice, concerned with the poetical dimensions of\nlanguage, in such works as Las vasijas quebradas (2012), and Tiempos\nsin fin (2018). A new trend has emerged on the examination of the\nphilosophical bases of modern economics, best exemplified in Leonidas\nMontes’ (1966) Adam Smith en contexto (2017).","contact.mail":"ijaksic@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
