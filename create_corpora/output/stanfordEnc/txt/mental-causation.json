Originally, the problem of mental causation was that of\nunderstanding how an immaterial mind, a soul, could interact with the\nbody. Most philosophers nowadays repudiate souls, but the problem of\nmental causation has not gone away. Instead, focus has shifted to\nmental properties. How could mental properties be causally\nrelevant to bodily behavior? How could something mental be a cause\nqua mental? After looking at the \ntraditional Problem of Interaction, we survey several versions of the\nproperty-based problem along with potential solutions. \n\n\n\nMental causation—the mind’s causal interaction with the\nworld, and in particular, its influence on behavior—is central\nto our conception of ourselves as agents. Mind–world interaction\nis taken for granted in everyday experience and in scientific\npractice. The pain you feel when you sprain your ankle causes you to open the freezer in search of an ice pack. An intention\nto go to the cinema leads you to get into your car. Psychologists\ntell us that mental images enable us to navigate our surroundings\nintelligently. Economists explain fluctuations in financial markets by\nciting traders’ beliefs about the price of oil next month. In\neach case, a mental occurrence appears to produce a series of complex\nand coordinated bodily motions that subsequently have additional downstream\neffects in the physical world. Instances of apparent mental causation\nare so common that they often go unremarked, but they are central to the\ncommonsense picture we have of ourselves. It’s not surprising,\nthen, that questions about the nature and possibility of mental\ncausation arise in variety of philosophical contexts. \n\nOntology: Suppose you accept the “Eleatic\nPrinciple” that power is the mark of being: to exist is to have\ncausal powers (Armstrong 1978, pp. 45-6; Oddie 1982). It’s plausible to think that if the\nmental has any causal powers at all, it can affect the physical\nworld. Without such powers, the mental faces ontological\nembarrassment, even elimination. \n\nMetaphysics: Mental causation is “at the heart of\nthe mind-body problem” (Shoemaker 2001, p. 74), often figuring explicitly in how the problem is formulated (Mackie 1979; Campbell 1984; Crane 1999). To ask how mind and body are related just is, in\npart, to ask how they could possibly affect one another. \n\nMoral psychology: Agency of the sort required for free will\nand moral responsibility\nappears to require mental causation. If your behavior is not caused by\nyour mind’s activities—its deliberations, decisions, and the\nlike—what sense would it make to hold you responsible for what\nyour body does? You would appear to be scarcely more than a passive\nobserver of your body’s activities. We would then need to abandon\nwhat Strawson (1962) calls our\n“reactive attitudes”, the moral attitudes and feelings (e.g., gratitude, resentment) so central to our interpersonal\nlives. \n\nAction theory: It is widely believed that psychological explanation hinges on the possibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and\ndesires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what\ngoes on in your mind could not explain what you do (Davidson 1963;\nMele 1992; for dissent, see “noncausalists” such as Ginet 1990; Sehon 2005; Tanney 2013; and see the essays\nin D’Oro 2013). These observations about agency suggest a more basic conceptual point:\nif minds did not influence behavior, in what sense would anyone\ntruly act? Sounds would be made, but no one\nwould mean anything by them. Bodies would move, but no one\nwould thereby do anything (Malcolm 1968; Horgan\n2007). \n\nAlthough each of the above points could be contested, collectively\nthey create pressure to address the problem of mental\ncausation—problem or problems: as will become clear,\nthere is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind’s\ncausal efficacy can arise. \n\nAt least since Hume, philosophers have assumed\nthat causal questions are largely empirical. We look to science to\ntell us, for example, the moon’s role in causing the tides, or\nsmoking’s contribution to lung cancer: these are not considered\nphilosophical questions. It might seem equally obvious that the\nmind’s causal role in producing behavior is also a matter for\nscience to settle. So is it in fact the case that working\nscientists, and in particular, psychologists, find it necessary to\nappeal to distinctively mental phenomena to account for behavior? Is\nthere evidence in neuroscience that mental states and processes figure\nin the production of actions? \n\nAlthough most psychologists would without hesitation accept the causal\ninteraction of minds and bodies, a small but growing number of\nempirical researchers have insisted that the evidence supports some\nversion of epiphenomenalism, the\nthesis that mental states, while caused by physical happenings, exert\nno efficacy in return. Wegner, a psychologist, contends that\naccumulated empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports\nepiphenomenalism, at least with respect to conscious willing (Wegner\n2002, 2004). He draws on influential work by Libet (1985, 2001, 2004) and others to argue that conscious intending is itself a product of nonconscious\nprocesses that do the real causal work, so that free will\nis “an illusion”. If Wegner and his colleagues are right, these results could have ancillary implications for the physical\nefficacy of mental states generally. \n\nBecause this research has received extensive treatment in recent work\non free will, we will not consider it further, but instead refer\ninterested readers to the sources cited above and to Mele 2014 for\ncritical discussion and references. Here we simply note that traditional\nand contemporary attempts to assess the efficacy of mental states have\nrun up against philosophical difficulties as well, difficulties that\ntend to overshadow the experimental evidence accumulated thus far. In\nthis sense, the efficacy of mind is quite unlike that of, say, the\nmoon or smoking. This will, we hope, become clear in the discussion to\nfollow. \n\nSome historians (e.g., Matson 1966; King 2007) say the mind-body\nproblem is relatively recent, the most important source\nbeing Descartes’s “real\ndistinction” between mind and body. That said, you can find\ntopics closely related to mental causation in, for example,\nPlato’s Phaedo and Aristotle’s De Anima,\nand it might turn out that many features of the contemporary debate\nare present in some form or other in pre-modern texts (Caston 1997). Skirting such historical questions, we begin with Descartes, who, for better or worse, set the agenda for modern\ndiscussions of mental causation. The cluster of causal problems\narising from the Cartesian conception of mind is The Problem of\nInteraction. \nAccording to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of thing,\nor, in the technical terminology of the day, distinct kinds\nof substance. Bodies, he held, are spatially extended\nsubstances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are\nunextended, thinking, feeling substances:\nsouls. (We use “soul” with no theological\nimplications to designate minds considered in the Cartesian way as\nimmaterial substances.) Despite recognizing these deep differences,\nDescartes accepted the common belief that mind and body causally\ninteract: “Everyone feels that he is a single person with both\nbody and thought so related by nature that the thought can move the\nbody and feel the things which happen to it” (in Cottingham et\nal. 1991, p. 228). But if minds and bodies are so radically different, it is not easy to see how they could interact.\nDescartes was well aware of the difficulty. Princess Elisabeth of\nBohemia puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter, pressing Descartes\nto tell her \n\nElisabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how\ncausation of bodies works: it must involve the cause’s\nimpelling the body, where this requires contact between\ncause and effect. Since a soul could never come into contact with a\nbody—souls have no spatial location—an immaterial soul\ncould never impel, and so could never causally interact with, a\nbody. \n\nElisabeth’s worries might seem quaint and outdated. Causal\nrelations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms,\nnot all of which are of the push-pull variety. Why shouldn’t\nsoul–body interaction simply be included as another sort of\n“non-mechanistic” causation (Richardson 1982)? But\nElisabeth’s objection is in fact just one version of a more\ngeneral worry about soul–body interaction, a worry that rests on\nthe following thesis about causation: \n\nElisabeth presumes that when an effect is bodily motion, the required\nnexus is spatial contact. But even if she is wrong about this (Garber 1983), (CN)\nnevertheless poses problems for the dualist: if contact is not the\nmind–body nexus, what is? \n\nOne line of thought appeals to the transference theory of causality.\nHere the idea is that identity—the persistence of \nsomething from cause to effect—provides the needed link. If \nsomething in a soul could become present in a body, this could \nbridge the immaterial and material. Descartes himself appears \nto accept such a theory, declaring in the Third Meditation that there\ncould be nothing in an effect not present in its total efficient \ncause (Descartes 1642/1996, p. 28). But now the problem reasserts itself: \nif, as the substance dualist insists, bodies and minds are radically different, \nthey have no properties in common. According to Descartes, a\nbody’s properties are modes of extension, ways of being extended, \nwhile a soul’s properties are modes of something quite different, \nthought or consciousness. If causation involved transference, a \nCartesian soul could not interact with a body \n(but see Hart 1988; Hoffman and Rosenkrantz 1991). \n\nDoes a dualist need to accept (CN), however? The notion of a causal nexus\nhas come under criticism, often from philosophers working in the\nHumean tradition (Blackburn 1990). More generally, (CN) and kindred\nprinciples might be thought to rest on a conception of causality that\nis now obsolete, finding no place in modern physics (for further \ndiscussion, see\n the metaphysics of causation,\n §2). But the next three versions of\nthe problem can arise even for those who reject the need for a causal\nnexus. \n\nA second version of the Problem of Interaction is the “Pairing\nProblem” (Kim 1973, 2005; Sosa 1984; Foster 1991, ch. 6).\nImagine two exactly similar minds M1\nand M2 and the bodies B1\nand B2 to which they are “attached”,\nthat is, the bodies with which they directly interact. In virtue of\nwhat is M1 causally paired\nwith B1, and M2\nwith B2? \n\nThis is not the epistemological question of how we could \nknow that these are the pairings (although this is \ntroublesome, too). The question, rather, is metaphysical: in virtue \nof what are these the pairings? If minds were, like bodies, \nlocated in space, causal pairing could be achieved by the relative \nspatial locations of the substances (Bailey et al. 2011). Particular minds might be inside\nor “inhabit” particular bodies. But if minds are non-spatial souls, \nrelative spatial location is unavailable to fill the pairing role. \nAnd since M1 and M2 are, by hypothesis, \nexactly similar, we cannot appeal to the different intrinsic \nproperties that they might possess. \n\nIn reply, a dualist could appeal to “individualistic”\npowers (Unger 2006, pp. 242–59; Foster 1991,\npp. 167–8). Powers are standardly thought of as powers to\ninteract with some type of object. A key has the\npower to open this lock, but only by virtue of having the power to\nopen any lock of this kind, the power to open any intrinsically\ncomparable lock. Individualistic powers, in contrast, are powers\npossessed by an object to affect or be affected by\na particular object. Think of a key with the power to\nopen this lock, but without the power to open any\nintrinsically indiscernible lock. Likewise, a soul could have the\npower to interact with a particular body and no other. As the key\nexample suggests, however, it is by no means obvious that\npowers could be individualistic in this sense. \n\nA third version of the Problem of Interaction appeals to conservation\nlaws. The leading idea is simple: Soul–body\ninteraction would have to change the amount of energy in the physical\nuniverse. When souls act, new energy would appear in, say, the\nbrain. When souls are acted upon, some quantity of energy in the brain\nwould vanish. But either scenario would contravene established\nconservation laws, which permit only the conversion and redistribution\nof energy (or mass–energy) within the physical universe, not its addition or\nsubtraction. \n\nThis version of the problem has dogged dualism since the scientific\nrevolution (Lowe 1992; Papineau 2000), and a number of contemporary\nphilosophers present conservation as a major obstacle for dualists\n(Fodor 1981; Dennett 1991, p. 35; Heil 2012, p. 26). That said, turning the leading idea into a compelling argument has proven difficult. First,\nwhat is needed is a conservation law weak enough to have been\nconfirmed by physical science, but strong enough to preclude\nsoul–body interaction. Averill and Keating (1981) consider a\nnumber of candidate “laws” and argue that none meets both\ncriteria. Second, it’s not clear in any case that a soul would\nhave to add energy to (or receive it from) the brain in order to\ninteract with it. The transference theory (§2.1) again seems to\nbe in the background here, but why accept it? Broad (1925,\npp. 103–9) suggests a soul could act merely by\nredistributing the brain’s energy without changing its\nquantity. (For more recent discussion of these and other complexities,\nsee Montero 2006; Koksvik 2007; Gibb 2010.) \n\nA fourth version of the Problem of Interaction is related to the\nthird, but, because it is more prominent in the contemporary literature, especially\nin some of the “property-based” problems we examine below, we will develop this last version at greater length. The first premise is: \nThe Completeness of the Physical: Every physical\neffect has a sufficient physical cause. \n\nWhen you trace the causal history of any physical effect—that\nis, of anything physical that has a cause—you will \nnever need to appeal to anything non-physical. The physical \nuniverse contains within itself the resources for a full causal explanation of \nany of its (caused) elements, and in this sense is “complete”. The \npoint applies, then, to whatever might occur to or within our bodies.\nAny instance of bodily behavior has a sufficient physical \ncause, which itself has a sufficient physical cause, and so on. In \ntracing the causal history of what we do, we need never appeal to \nanything non-physical. \n\nThis principle appears frequently in the mental causation literature\nunder a number of labels: most common are variations\nof Completeness of the Physical (Crane 1995, 2001; Papineau\n1993, 2000; O’Connor and Churchill 2010) or Physical\nClosure (Crane 1992; Baker 1993; Melnyk 2003; Kim\n2005). We’ll call it Completeness for short. \n\nLabels aside, several versions of the premise appear in the\nliterature, and they can differ in strength. Note that the principle\nas formulated says nothing about whether the non-physical can affect\nthe physical; a strengthened version prohibits this. (Closure\nis sometimes reserved for this stronger principle: LePore and Loewer\n1987; Kim 1998, p. 40; Marcus 2005; compare Strong Causal\nClosure in Montero 2003.) An even more ambitious version blocks\nthe non-physical from being cause or effect; such is\nsuggested in Davidson’s work (see §5.1 and McLaughlin 1989,\nwho uses Physical Comprehensiveness for this thesis.) As for\nweaker versions, Completeness could be limited to physical\neffects within the human body without affecting its relevance to the\ncurrent topic. Note also that the principle is apparently committed to\ndeterministic physical causation; a weakened version permits\nprobabilistic causes. (For complications with such a weakening, see\nMontero 2003, and for other challenges with\nformulating Completeness, Lowe 2000; Gibb 2015.) \n\nFor simplicity, we stay with the principle as formulated at the\noutset. Why think that it’s true? Perhaps it is a conceptual\ntruth: for an effect to be physical is, at least in part, for it to\nhave a physical cause. This defense turns on the proper analysis of\nthe concept physical, itself the subject of a contentious\nliterature (see physicalism). Here we\nsimply note that the principle does not seem analytic; it appears to be\na substantive, empirical claim about the causal structure of the\nuniverse. (For more on the conceptual defense, see Crane 1991;\nPapineau 1991, 1993, §1.9; Lowe 1996, p. 56.) \n\nIt’s natural, then, to look to science for a defense, and\nespecially physics (or physiology). Appeals to “current physical\ntheory” (Antony and Levine 1997, p. 100), “the development\nof the sciences” (LePore and Loewer 1987, p. 630), and\n“physics textbooks” (Melnyk 2003, p. 289) are common, but\nwhat exactly in physical science supports the premise?\nPapineau’s (2000) historical survey outlines two arguments. The\nfirst is inductive: when physics has investigated the nature of\n“special”, macroscopic forces, it has discovered that they\nall reduce to a small number of basic, conservative physical\nforces. Generalizing from this evidence, the idea is that all such\nforces will reduce to the same small set of physical forces. The\nsecond argument aims at establishing a weaker version\nof Completeness, one restricted to the human\nbody. Were Completeness false owing to the routine\nintervention of souls, physiology would have discovered anomalies\nwithin the human body, events that have no physical explanation. But a\ncentury of increasingly detailed investigation has revealed no such\nanomalies. It appears as if the causes operating within our bodies are\nentirely physical (compare Armstrong 1968/1993, pp. 32–3; Melnyk\n2003, p. 289; for a response, see Montero 2003). \n\nWe will look at challenges to Completeness in a moment, but\nnote for now that the premise by itself does not preclude the efficacy\nof souls. Even if every physical effect has a sufficient physical\ncause, some physical effects might have non-physical causes\nas well. This latest version of the Problem of Interaction thus\nrequires a second premise: No Overdetermination: There is no systematic\noverdetermination of physical effects. \n\nThis principle enjoys wide support in the literature. It is said that\npostulating systematic overdetermination in this context is\n“absurd” (Kim 1993a, p. 281), one of the\n“nonstarters” in the mental causation debate (Kim 1998,\np. 65). But why? Perhaps it just looks like bad engineering (Schiffer\n1987, p. 148). Or maybe the problem is that it would involve an\n“intolerable coincidence” (Melnyk 2003, p. 291): every\ntime you act, there are two independent causal processes—one from\nyour brain, another from your soul—converging on the same\neffect. With the two premises now in place, the Problem of Interaction in\nour final version is straightforward. Assume for reductio\nthat our souls routinely cause behavior. By Completeness,\nsuch effects also have sufficient physical causes, so behavior is\nsystematically overdetermined. But this contradicts No\nOverdetermination. The dualist’s options would then seem to\nbe severely limited. One is to embrace epiphenomenalism, a doctrine on\nwhich the mental, while caused by the physical, exerts no\n“downward” causal influence in return. A more radical\noption, parallelism, depicts bodies and souls as running in tandem,\nwith no causal influence in either direction. \n\nThe two premises can, however, be challenged. Start\nwith Completeness. Baker (1993), not herself a Cartesian\ndualist, argues that if the principle threatens to undermine our\nordinary (and scientific) explanatory practices—many of which\ncite the mental—it’s Completeness that has to\ngo. Entrenched explanatory practices trump any abstract metaphysical\nprinciples with which they might conflict (see also §§6.3,\n7.5). Others argue that physical science, far from supporting the\nprinciple, may in fact undermine it. Hendry (2006) finds indications\nof “downward causation” in chemistry, while Stapp (2005)\nculls evidence from contemporary physics suggesting that there are,\ncontrary to Completeness, causal gaps in the physical world,\ngaps filled in by the mental (see also Sturgeon 1998; Davies\n2006). Emergentists in general deny the principle, either on\nscientific grounds or by appeal to our conscious experiences of agency\n(see emergent properties,\nesp. §4). And although the death of emergentism has been declared\nmore than once on empirical grounds (McLaughlin 1992; Papineau 2000),\nthe view continues to attract philosophers and scientists. (See the contributions to Clayton and Davies 2006; Bedau and Humphreys 2008; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010; Paoletti and Orilia 2017.) \n\nNo Overdetermination has been targeted as well. Mills (1996),\nfor example, defends mental–physical overdetermination as the most \nplausible route for the dualist to take. Overdetermination is \nplausible, the reasoning goes, if for any behavioral effect \nB, both a non-physical (mental) cause M and \nphysical cause P satisfy the following counterfactual \nconditionals (among others): \n\nIf the dualist can reasonably claim that (1) and (2) are true, this\nwill make a strong prima facie case for\noverdetermination. Along different lines, Lowe (2003) presents a model\nof dualist interaction on which, owing to systematic mind–body\ndependencies, overdetermination is not the intolerable coincidence\nworrying opponents of dualism. And more generally, the ban on\nsystematic overdetermination has come under increased scrutiny in the\ncontext of the Exclusion Problem, to be discussed in §6. \n\nCartesian dualism has fallen out of favor among philosophers and\ncognitive scientists. There are, to be sure, non-Cartesian forms of\nsubstance dualism that might have the resources to confront the\nProblem of Interaction in its various guises (Hasker 1999; Lowe\n2006). But the dominant view today would appear to be that if the mind\nis a substance at all, it is a physical substance—the brain, for\ninstance. This sort of “substance monism” is in fact a\nconsequence of the more general token identity theory: every\nconcrete mental particular (token) is physical. We will assume token\nidentity in what follows: minds, mental events, and any other mental\n“objects” are physical\n(see the mind/brain identity theory).\n  \n\nWhat becomes of the Problem of Interaction on such a view? It would \nseem to dissolve. While causation between brain and body is complex, \neven to the point of being empirically inscrutable, it does not pose \nthe same problems as soul–body interaction. There are no special \nphilosophical problems with brain–body interaction, nor is there \nanything especially odd or worrisome about an event in your brain \ncausing, say, your arm to go up. Any philosophical questions here \nbelong to \n the metaphysics of causation\n generally and have no special application to mental causation. \n\nNevertheless, philosophical worries about mental causation persist.\nTheoretical and commonsensical considerations leading us to think the\nmind or mental events cause behavior should also make us think that\nthey do so as mental, i.e., in virtue of their mental\n properties.\nProperties figure in causal relations (Kim 1973; Mackie 1974, ch. 10;\nArmstrong 1989, pp. 28–9; Ehring 1997). Drop a square\npaperweight into soft clay and it will produce an impression. The\nshape of the impression can be traced to the shape of the paperweight,\nthe depth of the impression to the mass of the paperweight. Here shape\nand mass are “causally relevant” or “causally\nefficacious” properties. In particular, they are relevant to\ncertain properties of the impression. By contrast, other properties of\nthe paperweight, such as its color or value, appear to be irrelevant\nto producing this kind of impression. Or consider a soprano who sings\na high note, thereby shattering a glass. The sound, we can suppose,\nhas a meaning—a semantic property—but it is the\nsound’s acoustic properties that are operative in producing the\nshattering; the semantic properties play no causal role, at least not\nwith respect to this effect (Dretske 1989). \n\nBy themselves, these observations pose no special problem for the \nphilosopher of mind. While the notion of a causally relevant property\ncalls for analysis (Horgan 1989; Dardis 1993; Braun 1995), there\nis no reason at the outset for a token-identity theorist to be \nespecially concerned about the efficacy of mental properties.\nGus smiles because of the way his food tastes, that phenomenal \nproperty; Lilian walks to school along a particular route because of \nwhat she believes, that representational property. Assuming the \nmind is something physical, why should a mind’s causing behavior in\nvirtue of its mental properties be any more puzzling than a \npaperweight’s causing a square impression in virtue of its shape? \n\nRecent philosophical work on mental properties has revealed that\nmatters are not so simple, however. Mental properties are alleged to\nhave, not just one, but up to four features that make their\nefficacy philosophically puzzling, no less problematic than\nmind–body interaction is for the Cartesian dualist. These\nfeatures will be discussed in the following sections. Each feature\nmakes it appear as though mental properties, or some important family\nof them, are irrelevant to the production of behavior. The threat is a\nform of epiphenomenalism: even if minds and mental events are causes,\nthey are not causes as (or qua) mental. \n\nThis “new epiphenomenalism” (Campbell 1984, ch. 7)\nimmediately confronts a particularly strong version of\nproperty dualism, \none insisting that mental properties are sui generis, perhaps dependent on, but in no\nway reducible to the dispositional and structural properties\nrecognized by the physical sciences. Some property dualists accord\nthis status only to a certain class of mental property, namely\n qualia,\nthe “what it’s like” features of conscious\nexperience. Other property dualists, including\nsome emergentists, are willing\nto extend the thesis to all mental properties. \n\nSuppose that this robust form of property dualism is true. Can mental\nsubstances or events cause what they do qua mental, in virtue\nof their mental properties? The arguments against soul–body\ninteraction, now couched in terms of properties, could enter again\nhere. For example, if you were worried about the mind–body nexus\nfor souls (§2.1), it seems you should also wonder how\nnon-physical properties can find any traction in the physical\nworld. Similarly, Completeness (§2.4) seems to lose none\nof its attractiveness when formulated explicitly in terms of properties. You could add to the principle\na clause stipulating that a “sufficient physical cause” is\none that’s sufficient in virtue of its physical properties (see\nalso §5.4). Bring in No Overdetermination, and the\nefficacy of mental properties is again threatened. The arguments here\nand the responses to it are structurally similar to those in §2,\nso we will not pursue further this version of the property-based\nproblem.  (Property dualism also faces the Exclusion Problem, to be\ndiscussed in §6.) \n\nAnother version of the property-based problem of mental causation can\nbe traced to\n Davidson’s\n influential paper, “Mental Events” (Davidson 1970). \nThere Davidson defends an account of the mind–body \nrelation he calls \n “anomalous monism”,\na view that at first appears to save mental causation, but in the \nend might deny efficacy to mental properties. \n\nAt the core of anomalous monism are three principles: Principle of Causal Interaction: Some mental\nevents interact causally with physical events.  \n\nPrinciple of the Nomological Character of Causality: Events \nrelated as cause and effect fall under strict laws. \n\nAnomalism of the Mental: There are no strict laws on the \nbasis of which mental events can be predicted and explained. \n\nAccording to Davidson, the apparent tension among these principles\ngives rise to the mind–body problem. Most of us unquestioningly\nassent to the first principle. The second is more controversial,\nalthough Davidson provides little argument for it. Here we just note\nthat it’s not as strong as it seems, for\n“strict” is not synonymous with\n“deterministic”. A strict law is exceptionless,\nbut could be either deterministic or probabilistic. \n\nThe third principle is the most contested of the three. It rules out\nstrict laws in psychology; in particular—and most importantly for\npresent concerns—it rules out strict psychophysical\nlaws, that is, laws connecting the mental and physical. According to\nDavidson, application conditions for mental predicates feature a\nrationality constraint absent from the application conditions for\nphysical predicates. In ascribing beliefs to others, for instance, we\nemploy a principle of charity that counsels us to make these\nbelievers as rational as possible. But this normative constraint has,\nas Davidson puts it, “no echo” in the physical realm. In\nthis regard, mental and physical predicates are misaligned in a way\nthat precludes strict psychophysical laws. \n\nNow the second two principles seem to rule out the first. If causation\nrequires strict laws, and there are no strict psychophysical laws, how\ncan the mental be causally efficacious? But Davidson notes there is a\nway to save the first principle: as long as every mental event is\nphysical, the first principle is compatible with the other two. In\nthis way, the three principles entail event monism. At the\nsame time, Davidson’s view entails type dualism, for\nthe anomalism of the mental (the third principle) precludes identities\nbetween mental and physical types. Most philosophers find it natural\nto say that types are properties, so Davidson is sometimes described\nas a property dualist, a convenient label for the time being (but see §5.5). \n\nDavidson’s property dualism, and the principle that lies behind\nit, have led to a serious charge: anomalous monism robs mental\nproperties of any causal significance. \n\nSuppose Gus decides to illuminate the room and subsequently flips a\nswitch, thereby turning on the light. In this case we have a cause\nthat, if Davidson is right, could be given both a mental and a\nphysical description, and an effect that has a physical\ndescription. If this means that the cause has a mental\nproperty (in virtue of which it satisfies a mental description)\nand a physical property (in virtue of which it satisfies a\nphysical description), we are faced with a further question. Granting that\nthe event with the mental property is the event with a\nphysical property, why should we think that the mental\nproperty had anything at all to do with the event’s physical\neffect?  Davidson’s second two principles appear to block such\nrelevance. If all causal relations are subsumed under strict laws, and\nif there are no strict psychophysical laws, then any instance of\nmind–body causation is subsumed only by physical laws. But\nthen it looks as though only a mental event’s physical\nproperties are relevant to what it causes. The mental properties (or\nmental types) are causally irrelevant (see, e.g., Stoutland 1980; Honderich\n1982; Sosa 1984; a review of this literature is in\nMcLaughlin 1989). \n\nLePore and Loewer (1987) look to counterfactuals to answer this charge\n(see also Horgan 1989; LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990; Loewer\n2007). The central idea is that anomalous monism permits physical\neffects to depend counterfactually on mental properties. And such\ndependence secures an important kind of causal relevance for the\nmental, the sort that LePore and Loewer call “bringing\nabout”. On their view, a’s being F\nbrings about b’s being G when the following\nconditions are met: \n\nNow suppose a mental event, such as a decision to turn on the light,\ncauses Gus to move his finger, thereby flipping the light switch. Here\nthe crucial counterfactual is: If the cause had not been a decision to\nturn on the light, the effect would not have been a\nswitch-flipping. This is plausible, as are similar counterfactuals in\na wide range of cases. But are such counterfactuals compatible with\nanomalous monism? LePore and Loewer say Yes: while Davidson\nprohibits strict laws connecting mental and physical\nproperties, he apparently leaves room for non-strict laws. Such laws\nare enough to ground or “support”\ncounterfactuals. Consider, by analogy, the properties of being a\nmatch-striking and being a match-lighting. If there is a\nlaw connecting such properties, it is evidently non-strict: striking\ncauses lighting only ceteris paribus.  Nevertheless, we can\nassert with confidence, after a given lighting, that if the match had\nnot been struck, it wouldn’t have lit.  Non-strict\npsychophysical laws would similarly appear to ground counterfactuals\nconnecting mental and behavioral properties. \n\nThis counterfactual defense is attractive for a number of reasons. It\ncaptures a sense in which mental properties make a difference to\nbehavior, but in a way that’s apparently compatible with\nanomalous monism. It respects our causal intuitions about a wide range of cases. And it fits well with the more\ngeneral counterfactual theory of causation,\n which many philosophers have found independently\nplausible. Moreover, Davidson himself seems sympathetic to the defense\n(Davidson 1993; but see §5.5). \n\nIn spite of these advantages, a worry is that the pertinent counterfactuals don’t after all ensure causal relevance, and in\nthis sense don’t vindicate anomalous monism. This objection can\ntake the form of direct counterexamples (Braun 1995; Garrett 1999),\nbut here we look at a broader concern. \n\nWhen a counterfactual is true, there should be something in the world\nthat makes it true. Even granting that, if the cause had not had its\nmental property, the effect would not have had its behavioral\nproperty, in virtue of what is this true? This truthmaker, not the\ncounterfactual itself, is what matters in determining whether a\nproperty is causally relevant. And the worry is that once we look at\nthe truthmakers in the mental case, the threat of epiphenomenalism\ncrops up again. Although the effect counterfactually depends on the\nmental property, this is only because the mental property depends on a\nphysical property doing the real work. The mental property looks like\na freeloader (Kim 1998, pp. 70–3, 2007; compare Crane 2008 on a\nsimilar issue). \n\nLePore and Loewer discuss a version of this worry. Condition (3), an\nobjector might say, is too crude to test for causal relevance, for the\ncounterfactual holds only because removing F\nfrom a also removes some other property F*\nof a, and it’s the absence of F* that’s\nresponsible for b’s not being G. A better\ncounterfactual test evaluates the effect’s status given\nthat a is not F and all\nof a’s other properties—or at least all that are\npotential causal rivals to F—are held\nfixed. If b is not G in that case, only then can we\ncredit F with causal relevance. But mental properties fail\nthis more refined test. Consider again Gus’s decision to turn on\nthe light, and remove its mental property, this time holding fixed its\nphysical properties. It seems clear that he would still flip the\nswitch. After all, the physical properties of the cause figure in an\nexceptionless law according to Davidson. It looks as if the physical properties of your decision “screen\noff” the mental property, making the latter irrelevant. \n\nLePore and Loewer concede that mental properties are screened off by\nphysical properties. But they argue that this more refined test is too\ndemanding, for it would also mean that the physical properties of a\nmental cause are irrelevant. Note in particular that the\ndecision’s mental properties screen off its physical properties:\nif the cause had lacked its physical properties yet had still been a\ndecision to turn on the light, it would have caused Gus to flip the\nswitch (ceteris paribus: here a hedged law, which anomalous\nmonism permits, is in play). Screening off thus goes both ways, and\nsince few would want to deny causal relevance to the physical\nproperties, we should not let screening off impugn the significance of\nmental properties either. \n\nAntony (1991) replies that there is no\nsymmetry here, at least not given anomalous monism. While the\ndecision’s physical properties screen off its mental\nproperties, the reverse doesn’t hold. Suppose again that the\ncause had lacked its physical properties but had still been a decision\nto turn on the light. On anomalous monism, Antony argues,\nthere’s no saying what Gus’s decision would have caused,\nfor mental properties, being anomalous, place no constraints on the\ncausal structure of the world. (See also Leiter and Miller 1994.) \n\nThe freeloader problem arises in a variety of contexts in the mental\ncausation literature, not just in discussions of anomalous monism. It\nwill return under a number of guises in what follows. \n\nFodor (1989) apparently agrees that counterfactuals capture a kind of\ncausal relevance, but he argues that LePore and Loewer have settled\nfor too little. On Fodor’s view, mental properties can be\nrelevant to behavior in a stronger sense in which they\nare sufficient for their effects and in this way “make\na difference”. Fodor spells out sufficiency in terms of laws: a\nproperty makes a difference if “it’s a property in virtue\nof the instantiation of which the occurrence of one event is\nnomologically sufficient for the occurrence of another” (Fodor\n1989, p. 65, note omitted). \n\nMight such an account save anomalous monism from the charge of\nepiphenomenalism? On the face of it, it cannot, for as we’ve\nnoted, mental properties on Davidson’s view appear only in\nhedged laws, laws that include an implicit ceteris paribus\nrider. Consider a candidate psychological law: \n\nThe ceteris paribus clause here would seem to block the\nmental properties in question from being causally sufficient for the\nbehavioral effect. But perhaps not: according to (L), the mental\nproperties are sufficient for the behavioral effect when the\nceteris paribus conditions are satisfied. And this sort of \ncausal sufficiency, Fodor argues, is all anyone could reasonably want for\nmental properties. \n\nBut can Davidson help himself to such an account? Davidson appears to\nthink so (1993, p. 10), as does McLaughlin (1989), who also appeals to\nhedged laws. Fodor, however, doubts his account is compatible with\nanomalous monism; such doubts are developed by Antony (1991) and Kim\n(1993b). The question turns largely on Davidson’s reasons for\nthinking the mental is anomalous, and on whether these reasons permit\nhim to appeal to hedged laws in the way the laws account requires. \n\nSupposing anomalous monism is compatible with Fodor’s account,\nyou might still wonder whether nomological sufficiency is enough for\ncausal relevance. An account of causal relevance in terms of laws is\nnatural given the tight connections between laws and properties\n(see laws of nature, §3). But\nthose sympathetic to Fodor’s position might still ask (as Fodor\nhimself does) what the causal mechanism is in mental–physical\ninteractions. For example, it could turn out that the reason\npsychophysical laws such as (L) hold is that mental properties are\nthemselves grounded in more basic, physical properties, and that only\nthe latter do genuine causal work: mental properties again look like\nfreeloaders (§5.3), merely piggybacking on the real bearers of\ncausal powers (LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990; Leiter and Miller 1994; Marras 2003). \n\nDavidson replies to his critics in “Thinking Causes”\n(Davidson 1993). In that paper he sometimes speaks favorably of\n“causally efficacious” properties, and he helps himself to\nboth hedged laws and counterfactuals to secure the efficacy of mental\nproperties. But his considered position appears less conciliatory. He\nclearly denies a crucial assumption of his critics, namely, that\ncauses do their causing in virtue of their properties. When an event\ncauses something, it doesn’t do so qua this or that: it\njust causes what it does, full stop. Were this so, none of the\nproperty-based problems discussed here could get off the ground (Crane\n1995; Campbell 1997; Gibb 2006). \n\nSuch a response seems to miss the point (Kim 1993b; McLaughlin 1993;\nSosa 1993). All parties in this dispute agree that mental events can\ncause physical events. The difficulty is to understand how they could\ndo so in virtue of their mental\n(rather than their physical) properties, how they could have physical\neffects qua mental. The principle of the Nomological\nCharacter of Causation (§5.1) apparently requires that, when one\nevent causes another, it does so in solely virtue of its physical\nproperties. \n\nBut Davidson is part of\na nominalist tradition that\nrejects properties, at least as his critics conceive of them. Davidson\ninstead formulates anomalous monism in terms of predicates\nand descriptions. An event is mental if it answers to a\nmental predicate (that is, it can be picked out using a mental description), physical if it answers to a physical\npredicate (it can be referred to using a physical description). Davidson’s critics assume that if an event answers to both sorts of predicate, it\nincludes a mental property and a physical property. But Davidson\nthinks about the mental–physical distinction as merely a\ndifference in description, not as the expression of an ontological\ndivide between kinds of property. For Davidson, then, it makes no more\nsense to ask whether an event had a particular effect in virtue of\nbeing mental or in virtue of being physical than it would to ask\nwhether its effect stemmed from its being described in English or in\nGerman. (For further discussion, see Heil 2009.) \n\nWhile reflection on property dualism or anomalous monism can lead to\nour next property-based problem, another route is by way of the\ndoctrine of\n non-reductive physicalism. \nLike the property dualist, the non-reductive physicalist holds that\nmental properties are not physical.  But unlike the property dualist,\nthe non-reductive physicalist insists on a strong dependence of the\nmental on the physical: mental properties are “realized” or “constituted” by physical\nproperties. This strong tie between the mental and physical is the\nsubject of a large contemporary literature, some of which we touch on\nbelow. \n\nNon-reductive physicalism in its current form grew out\nof functionalism, according to which\nmental properties are functional properties. To be in pain, for\nexample, is a matter of being in a state with a certain causal\nprofile, a state that’s caused by tissue damage, and causes\ncertain overt responses (moans, attempts to repair the damage, beliefs\nthat one is in pain). But, argue functionalists, it is most unlikely\nthat we could identify a single kind of physical state playing this role in every actual and possible case of pain. Human\nbeings differ in endless tiny physiological ways: your neurological\nstates, including states you go into when you are in pain, probably\ndiffer subtly from another person’s. Human beings’\nneurological states, in turn, differ from those of a cat or a dog, and\nperhaps dramatically from states of an octopus. You might even imagine\nencountering aliens with vastly different biologies, but to which you\nwould unhesitatingly ascribe pains. \n\nHere we arrive at a core thesis of functionalism: states of mind are \n “multiply realizable”.\nThe property of being in pain can be realized in a wide variety of\nphysical (and perhaps non-physical) systems. A creature is in pain in\nvirtue of being in a state with the right sort of causal profile, some\nsort of neurological state, say. But the property of being in pain cannot\nbe identified with this neurological state, because\ncreatures of other kinds can be in pain in virtue of being in vastly\ndifferent physical conditions. Functionalists often put this point by\nsaying that mental properties are “higher-level”\nproperties, properties possessed by objects by virtue of their\npossession of appropriate “lower-level” properties, their\nrealizers. \n\nNow, however, we are again confronted with the threat of\nepiphenomenalism. If mental properties are not physical,\nhow could they make a causal difference? Whenever any mental\n(functional) property M is instantiated, it will be realized\nby some particular physical property P. This physical\nproperty is unproblematically relevant to producing various behavioral\neffects. But then what causal work is left for M to do? It\nseems to be causally idle, “excluded” by the work\nof P. \n\nThis version of the problem of mental causation has appeared in\nvarious guises. Much of the contemporary literature is inspired by Malcolm 1968, especially as refined in Kim 1989, 1993c, 1998, 2005. Whatever its precise formulation (cp. Shapiro and Sober 2007; O’Connor and Churchill 2010; historical perspective is in Patterson 2005), the Exclusion Problem has clear affinities with the other problems we’ve looked at so far. Consider our claim that the realizing property P must play a role in producing a particular behavioral effect. This would seem to be justified either\nby an appeal to Completeness (§2.4) or to\nDavidson’s doctrine (§5.1) that causal relations must fall\nunder strict (and so physical) laws. Moreover, the argument’s\ndepiction of P and M as competing for causal\nrelevance—one must exclude the other—would seem to require\na principle such as No Overdetermination (§2.4). And the\nfundamental worry that P might exclude M looks\nexactly like the freeloader problem that badgers mainstream attempts\nto save anomalous monism (§§5.3–4). \n\nIn spite of these similarities, the Exclusion Problem is in one\nimportant respect unique: unlike the problems we’ve looked at so\nfar, exclusion worries generalize to a wide range of phenomena outside\nof the mental. Any properties, mental or otherwise, that are\nmultiply realizable in physical systems are threatened with causal\nirrelevance. (For discussion of this and related issues, see Kim 1998,\npp. 77–87; Noordhof 1999; Bontly 2001; Gillett and Rives 2001;\nBlock 2003; Walter 2008.) \n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Fodor 1989; Baker 1993; Shapiro 2010) take this general\nnature of the problem to be an encouraging sign. We happily\naccept biological, or meteorological, or geological properties as\ncausally significant despite their being distinct from their physical\nrealizers. Why then imagine that exclusion threatens the efficacy of\nmental properties? Others turn this argument around, insisting that\nthe alleged efficacy of biological and other “special\nscience” properties is by no means sacrosanct (Antony\n1995). Causal powers we attribute to them must respect what our best\nmetaphysics tells us. And in any case, the central issue is not so\nmuch whether mental properties (and the rest) are causally\nrelevant to the production of physical effects, but how\nthey could be (Kim 1998, pp. 61–2, 78–9; Antony\nand Levine 1997, p. 96; McLaughlin 2006). Even if the Exclusion\nProblem, because it generalizes, does not tempt us to embrace\nepiphenomenalism, it presses on us a responsibility to explain how\nmental properties could play a causal role given that they appear to\nbe screened off by their physical realizers. \n\nThe Exclusion Problem is the subject of a large and still-growing \nliterature. In the next few sub-sections, we look at some of the main\nlines of response, dividing them into three broad categories. \n\nThe Exclusion Problem presents us with a picture on which \nhigher-level mental properties compete with their \nlower-level physical realizers. Physical properties are \nunproblematically relevant in the production of behavior, and so \nmental properties must either find a way to do the work that their \nrealizers are already doing or face exclusion. But some philosophers \nwould insist that this picture is deeply misleading: mental \nproperties enjoy causal relevance in their own right and are not \nthreatened by exclusion from physical properties. \n\nThis “autonomy solution” (Jackson 1996, §2) can take\na variety of forms. One version starts by observing that psychological\nexplanations—and more generally, explanations in the special\nsciences—are in an important sense independent of physical\nexplanations. Psychological explanations typically abstract away from\ndetails of lower-level implementation, appealing instead to their own\ndistinctive kinds and laws. Explanations in the special sciences can\nthus proceed independently of those in the lower-level physical\nsciences. If the structure of the causal order reflects these\nexplanatory practices, mental properties need not be threatened by\nexclusion. Mental and physical causes can peacefully\ncoexist. (Variations on this theme appear in Dennett 1973; Baker 1993;\nVan Gulick 1993; Garrett 1998; Hardcastle 1998; Marcus 2001; Menzies 2003; Raymont\n2003; Ross and Spurrett 2004; Woodward 2008; Zhong 2014; see also §7.5.) \n\nThis appeal to explanation can naturally lead to (though it does not\nentail) another autonomy solution, the dual explanandum\nstrategy. The Exclusion Problem presents a mental (functional)\nproperty M and its physical realizer P as competing\nto be causally relevant to the same effect, namely a bit of\nbehavior. But M might not be threatened with exclusion\nif M and P are causally relevant to different\nproperties of the effect. Return for a moment to the paperweight\nexample from §3. The shape of the paperweight is relevant, not to\nthe impression simpliciter, but to the\nimpression’s shape. In general, a causally relevant\nproperty is relevant to some particular property of the effect (Horgan\n1989). Perhaps, then, M and P do not causally\ncompete because they are parts of separate, autonomous causal lines to\ndifferent properties of the effect. \n\nConsider one way this might work. Behavioral properties, just like\nmental properties, appear to be multiply realizable. For example,\nthere is more than one way to hail a cab, many different physical\nrealizations of this kind of behavior. Now suppose a belief causes you\nto hail a cab. In accordance with Completeness, some physical\nproperty P of the belief is sufficient for your behavior. But\nstrictly speaking, P is relevant only to the\nparticular way in which you hailed the cab, the particular\nphysical realization of your hailing. What, then, is responsible for\nyour behavior’s higher-level property of simply\nbeing a cab-hailing? It’s natural to suppose that it’s a \nhigher-level property of your belief, namely, some mental property, \nsuch as the belief’s representational content. (For proposals along \nthese lines, see Yablo 1992; Thomasson 1998; Marras 1998; Crisp and \nWarfield 2001; Gibbons 2006; Schlosser 2009; see also §§7.3–4.) \n\nA strength of autonomy solutions is that they secure a causal role for\nmental properties without running afoul of Completeness, as\nthe physical realization of behavior is always matched with some\nphysical properties of its cause. But do autonomy solutions\nrespect No Overdetermination? Here matters are not as\nstraightforward. Autonomy solutions present us with two\nproperties, P and M, each sufficient for the\nbehavioral effect. It might seem as if the dual explanandum strategy\navoids this awkwardness, since P and M are relevant\nto different properties of the effect. But even here,\noverdetermination threatens, as the effect’s behavioral property\nis produced twice: directly by M, and indirectly\nby P, which produces the behavioral property’s physical\nrealizer, which itself necessitates the behavioral property. \n\nProponents of autonomy solutions might grant these points but claim\nthat such “overdetermination” is innocuous, far from the\n“intolerable coincidence” threatening Cartesian dualist\naccounts of mental causation (§2.4), for the two causal lines\npresent are not independent. (The nature of overdetermination has\nitself become the subject of a literature inspired, in part, by the\nExclusion Problem. See, e.g., Funkhouser 2002; Bennett 2003;\nSider 2003; Walter 2008; Carey 2011; Bernstein 2016.) \n\nAutonomy solutions can make it appear that the causal powers of mental\nproperties “float free” of their physical realizers,\nbringing to mind the doctrine of parallelism (for replies, see\nThomasson 1998; Marcus 2001, §3.3). Some non-reductive\nphysicalists have accordingly looked to tie the causal powers of\nmental properties more closely to those of their physical\nrealizers. The idea is that mental properties are so intimately\nrelated to their realizers that the former “inherit” the\ncausal powers of the latter. The relation between levels is not one of\nrivalry, such that the physical might exclude the mental, but one of\ncooperation. Nor, moreover, does there seem to be any threat of\noverdetermination, since the mental works through the\nphysical. (Compare the metaphor of “transparency” in\nJackson 1996.) \n\nOn some versions of the inheritance solution, what the higher-level\nmental property derives from its physical realizer is some weaker or\n“lower-grade” form of causal relevance. For example,\nJackson and Pettit (1988, 1990) distinguish the robust “causal\nefficacy” of physical properties from the weaker “causal\nrelevance” of higher-level properties. Causal relevance in this\nsense is an explanatory notion: as one might put it, behavior is\nproduced at the physical level, but by being realized in the physical,\nmental properties inherit an explanatory relevance they wouldn’t\nhave otherwise. An advantage of such a view is that it accords a\nderived form of relevance to mental properties, but in a way that\nrespects both the priority of physical causation embodied\nin Completeness as well as the principle of No\nOverdetermination. (For similar views, see Kim 1984; Levine 2001,\n§1.5; Segal 2009. Those who appeal to the counterfactual\ndependence of behavior on the mental [§5.3] might also fall into\nthis category. For an answer to the charge that counterfactual\ndependence is “causation lite”, see Loewer 2007; Menzies\n2007.) \n\nIf such a weakening seems to amount to epiphenomenalism, you might\nlook for an inheritance solution on which mental properties are\nefficacious in the same sense that their physical realizers are\n(compare the “homogeneity assumption” in Crane 1995). How\ncan this be done without violating No Overdetermination?\nWell, suppose that a mental property is, in spite of being distinct\nfrom its physical realizer, immanent in this\nrealizer; M, that is, is somehow nothing over and\nabove P. In that case, any causal work done by P is,\nin a straightforward way, inherited by M. Overdetermination\nis avoided because M’s work is included\nin P’s. \n\nThe metaphysical details of such a picture matter. Otherwise,\n“immanence”, “nothing over and above”, and the\nlike will turn into mere labels for that psychophysical relation, we\nknow not what, that solves the Exclusion Problem. Accordingly, several\npromising lines of inquiry have been pursued. Mental and physical\nproperties are said to be related by, for example, the\ndeterminable–determinate relation (Yablo 1992; critics include\nEhring 1996; Worley 1997; Funkhouser 2006), constitution (Pereboom\n2002; critics include Ney 2007; Heil 2011), metaphysical necessitation\n(Bennett 2003, 2008), physical explicability (Antony 1991), physical\nimplementation (Marras 2003), and grounding (Kroedel and Schulz 2016). \n\nYou might ask why any of these relations should secure the desired\nsolution. One thought is that if mental properties are immanent in\ntheir physical realizers, the causal powers of a mental property\nare included among those of its realizer. Consider again\nmental property M and one of its realizers in a given\ninstance, P. Plausibly, M’s powers are\nincluded in P’s. Both properties, for example, have the\npower to cause a certain kind of behavior, but because of its greater\n“specificity”, P has in addition to this powers\nthat M lacks. Now in general we don’t think that wholes\ncausally compete with, or are excluded by, their parts. When Gus steps\non Lilian’s toe, his foot’s causing Lilian discomfort\ndoesn’t exclude Gus’s causing her discomfort. Both Gus and\nhis foot coexist as causes, without competition and, we might add,\nwithout overdetermination. A similar point could be made about\nproperties: if the causal powers of M are included in those\nbestowed by P, then P’s causal relevance to\nbehavior, far from excluding M’s, includes\nit. (Approaches along these lines have been developed in Antony 1999; Shoemaker 2001; Wilson 1999, 2011; Clapp 2001; critical discussions include Heil 1999, 2011; McLaughlin 2007; Kim 2010; Ney 2010; Audi 2012.) \n\nAutonomy and inheritance solutions grant at least this much to the\nExclusion Problem: mental and physical properties are numerically\ndistinct, however intimately they are otherwise related. But a third\nsort of strategy tries to undermine the argument at exactly this\npoint: any mental property just is its physical realizer. If\nM=P, there’s no question of one’s excluding the \nother, nor is there any mystery of how M can work through \nP, for M and P are one and the same. \n\nThis sort of psychophysical property identity would seem to be blocked\nby the multiple realizability argument sketched earlier. But that\nargument, in spite of its wide appeal, has come under attack from\nseveral directions (see\n multiple realizability,\n §2). For example, some (Kim 1992; Lewis 1994; Jackson 1995; Heil 2003) take the argument to show, not that\nmental properties are distinct from their physical realizers, but that\nwhat we thought was one kind of mental property is actually\nmany. Pains realized by different physical properties, in spite of\nhaving the same name (“pain”), are different,\nthough similar, mental properties. There is no such property as pain\nsimpliciter, only pain-for-this-physical-structure and\npain-for-that-physical structure. Once such\n“structure-specific” identities are allowed, we can say\nthat M (now just, say, pain-for-human beings) is identical\nwith P, M’s “realizer” in human\nbeings (replies include Fodor 1997; Block 1997; Marras 2003; Moore and Campbell 2010). \n\nThis solution comes at a price: it forces us to abandon the belief\nthat pain is a single, natural kind. There is, however, a way to\npreserve this doctrine while pursuing a strategy that’s\notherwise similar to the one just sketched. The essential idea is that\n“property” as we’ve used the term so far is\nambiguous. A property could be what characterizes an object (event),\nor what unifies several objects as a “one across\nmany”. Now suppose the characterizing properties are\n tropes:\n particularized properties, unique to each object. And suppose the \nunifying properties are something else—call these \n“types”. If the mental “properties” that \nare causally relevant to behavior are tropes, and the mental \n“properties” mentioned in the multiple realizability\nargument are types, there’s no reason to think that this\nargument rules out psychophysical property-identities in any way that\nleads to exclusion worries. The M-trope and\nthe P-trope are one and the same trope falling under two\ntypes, mental and physical.  This proposal allows for a\nsingle type pain shared by diverse creatures; it’s just\nthat this type is not the same sort of entity (a trope) that’s\nefficacious in the production of behavior (Heil 1992; Robb 1997; Heil and Robb 2003; what appears to be a similar view is defended by Macdonald and Macdonald 1986, 1995a; see also Whittle 2007.) \n\nOne worry about this proposal is that it appears to raise the\nExclusion Problem all over again, this time at the level of properties\n(tropes). If a single property is both mental and\nphysical, Completeness and No Overdetermination\nforce us to say that it’s efficacious only qua\nphysical, not qua mental. (For this and other criticisms, see\nNoordhof 1998; Raymont 2001; Gibb 2004; Macdonald and Macdonald 2006;\nAlward 2008; Maurin 2008; see Robb 2013 for some replies.) \n\nFunctionalism, along with any non-reductive theory of mind, faces the\nproblem just discussed. But even if exclusionary worries are finessed,\nfunctionalism faces an additional and possibly more fundamental\nproblem. \n\nAs we noted earlier, functionalism characterizes states of mind\ncausally. To be in a given mental state is to be in a state with the\nright sort of causal profile, a state bearing the right sorts of\nrelation to other states. Think of functional states as nodes in a\nnetwork of states, the identity of which depends on the relations they\nbear to other nodes, and think of the realizers as occupants of these\nnodes. All there is to a node is the potential causal\nrelations it bears to other nodes (not so for the occupants, which\nhave intrinsic properties). Suppose, then, that F\nand G are functional properties—nodes in this\nnetwork—and that all there is to something’s\nbeing F is its being a G-causer. The resulting\ngeneralization, “Fs cause Gs”, is no\ndoubt true, but it is vacuous, equivalent to the generalization\nthat G-causers cause Gs. \n\nThis appears to strip functional properties of their causal\nefficacy. Why? One line of thought appeals to Hume’s celebrated\ndoctrine that there can be no necessary connections between distinct\nexistences. A mental property and its would-be effect are distinct,\nyet functionalism entails that they enjoy a necessary connection. On\nthe Humean doctrine, such a connection could not be causal. Another,\nclosely related, version of the problem requires that causal relations\nbe subsumed by empirical laws. But there are no such laws available\nfor functional properties if all of the relevant generalizations are\nanalytic and vacuous. (The foregoing argument in either version\nthreatens to generalize to all dispositional properties:\nsee  dispositions, §6. For the\nproblem aimed at functionalism in particular, see Block 1990; Rupert\n2006; functionalism, §5.2.) \n\nThis argument echoes the logical connection argument advanced in the 1950’s and 60’s against causal accounts of action (e.g., Melden 1961, pp. 52–3). Given that reasons (desires, intentions) are not logically distinct from the actions they rationalize, reasons could not cause actions. In\nresponse, Davidson (1963) noted that logical connections hold among\npredicates or descriptions of events, not among events themselves. A\ncause could be described in various ways, some of which will involve\nthe effect: consider “the cause of the fire caused the\nfire”. This is hardly informative, but it’s not thereby false. And of course the statement, far from precluding a causal relation,\nexplicitly asserts it. That said, if the claim is true, it should be possible\nto identify the cause of the fire independently of reference to the\neffect—as “the match’s igniting”, for\ninstance. In defense of his own causal theory of action, Davidson\nargued that such a re-description of mental causes is always\navailable, at least in principle (see §5.1). \n\nBut Davidson’s saving move appears not to be available for the\nfunctionalist, for in the case of functional states and properties, no\nsuch independent descriptions are available, as the nature of a\nfunctional property is exhausted by its place in the causal\nnetwork. \n\nThe functionalist has a number of options available, some of them\nmirroring solutions to the Exclusion Problem (Rupert 2006 provides a\ncritical survey). For example, a functionalist could settle for a\nweaker, explanatory role for functional properties, leaving causal\nefficacy to the realizers of functional states (§6.4; see, e.g.,\nSegal 2009; compare Roth and Cummins 2014). Or a functionalist might identify\nstates of mind with their realizers (§6.5); indeed, some of the\nearly functionalists were identity theorists (Lewis 1966, 1994; Armstrong\n1968/1993). This would permit the sort of re-description that the more\nmainstream version of functionalism apparently blocks. A third option\nis to look for non-vacuous, empirical generalizations subsuming\nfunctional properties (Antony and Levine 1997). Yet a fourth option\nrejects the Humean doctrine, permitting necessary connections between\na causally efficacious property and its effect. Such a proposal would\nfind a home in the more general “causal theory of\nproperties” defended by Shoemaker (1980, 1998) and others. \n\nOur final version of the property-based problem is restricted to\nintentional mental properties, that is, properties in virtue of which\nsome mental states—propositional attitudes, perceptual\nexperiences, mental images, and so on—are about\nsomething, properties in virtue of which mental states have\nrepresentational content. We assume here\nthat externalism is true, so\nthat the contents of representational states of mind depend, not\nmerely on intrinsic features of those states, but on relations, in\nparticular, on the causal, social, and historical relations agents\nbear to their surroundings. In the simplest case, Lilian is thinking\nabout water (H2O) because she stands in the right\nsorts of causal relation to water. The key move here is to reject the\nidea that meaningful objects or states owe their meaning to their\nintrinsic make-up alone. \n\nThe causally problematic feature for externalism is this contextual or\nrelational component of representational mental states. Suppose that\nour mental representations are physical structures in the brain. Now\nsuppose with the externalist that the content of these representations\nis determined, not just by our intrinsic features, but by context as\nwell. Lilian (or Lilian’s brain) represents a tree in the quad\nby going into state T. But T represents a tree in the quad, not by virtue\nof T’s (or, for that matter, Lilian’s) intrinsic\nmakeup, but by virtue of\nT’s (and by extension Lilian’s) standing in the right kind \nof relation to the tree. The very same kind of state in a different \ncontext (in the brain of someone in different circumstances) might \nrepresent something very different—or nothing at all. \n\nNow if the content of Lilian’s thought that there is a tree in\nthe quad is “broad”, if the significance of her thought\ndepends on factors outside Lilian’s body, then it is indeed hard\nto see how this content could figure in a causal account of her\nactions, including Lilian’s expressing her belief that there is\na tree in the quad by uttering the sentence, “There is a tree in\nthe quad”. This is bad news for any attempt to explain why we do\nwhat we do by reference to the contents of our thoughts. \n\nConsider an analogy (Dretske 1998). Gus inserts a quarter into a vending machine. The\ncoin has a range of intrinsic qualities common to quarters, but its\nbeing a quarter does not depend solely on these intrinsic qualities: a\nquarter’s intrinsic qualities would be shared by a decent\ncounterfeit. The coin’s being a quarter depends on its having\nthe right sort of history: it was produced in a United States\nmint. This is something the vending machine cares nothing about. The\nmachine reacts only to the coin’s intrinsic features. You might\nput this by saying that the coin affects the machine, not qua\nquarter, but only qua possessor of a particular kind of\nintrinsic makeup. (Vending machines are built to take advantage of the\ncontingent fact that objects with this intrinsic makeup are almost\nalways quarters.) \n\nThe worry is that we apparently operate, in important respects, as\nvending machines do. We respond to incoming stimuli solely in virtue\nof our intrinsic makeup and the intrinsic character of the\nstimuli. But if our thoughts possess their content in virtue of our\nstanding in complicated environmental–social–historical\nrelations to our surroundings, it is hard to see how such contents\ncould make a causal difference in our psychological economy, how they\ncould figure in the production of behavior. Thoughts have\ncontents, but these contents could have no direct influence on the\noperation of mental mechanisms (Stich 1978; Kim 1982; Fodor 1980,\n1987, ch. 2, 1991; Jackson and Pettit 1988). \n\nOne general line of response notes that whenever we explain a bit of\nbehavior by appeal to extrinsic content, there is a local, intrinsic\nproperty available as a “causal surrogate” to produce the\nbehavior (Crane and Mellor 1990). Such a surrogate may be\nneurophysiological or, as\non computationalist views, a\ncomplex of “formal” or “syntactic” properties\nof internal representations. Now by itself, this point seems just to\nhighlight the problem: if intrinsic surrogates are always needed, all\nthe more reason to reject the efficacy of content. Some have indeed\ndrawn such a lesson, concluding either that content has no role to\nplay in an explanatory psychology (Stich 1978, 1983), or perhaps that\npsychological explanations appealing to content were never causal to\nbegin with (Owens 1993; see also the noncausalists cited in\n§1.1). \n\nBut this might be too hasty. Far from precluding the causal efficacy\nof content, the surrogates might in fact play a role in ensuring\nit. Note that while Lilian’s intrinsic properties don’t\nguarantee the contents of her beliefs, her intrinsic properties are,\nin her environment, reliably correlated with these contents—so\nreliably, in fact, that content, in spite of being extrinsic, enters\ninto the counterfactuals or laws often thought to\nground causal efficacy. It seems clear, after all, that if Lilian had\nnot believed there was water in front of her, she would not have\nextended her hand. This counterfactual could be secured by the fact\nthat Lilian’s believing “There’s water in front of\nme” covaries with some internal state of her brain, but the\ncounterfactual, for all that, is still true. A similar point could be\nmade using (hedged) laws connecting content with behavior. The terrain\nhere in any case is similar to that explored earlier in\n§§5.3–4, though the extrinsic nature of content\nintroduces its own complexities. (On the counterfactuals, see Mele 1992, ch. 2; Yablo 1997; on the laws, see Braun 1991; Fodor 1995.) \n\nThere’s a more direct way that the intrinsic surrogates might secure\nthe efficacy of content: perhaps the surrogate properties are\ncontent, or rather a kind of\ncontent. Distinguish narrow from broad\ncontent. Think of narrow content as the content of a representational\nstate of mind minus its “broad” components. Consider\nLilian (or Lilian’s brain) and an intrinsically indiscernible brain in\na vat wired to a supercomputer. Grant that Lilian and the envatted\nbrain entertain intrinsically indiscernible thoughts with utterly\ndifferent representational contents. Now imagine that we could\nabstract a common element from the contents of Lilian’s and the\nbrain’s intrinsically indiscernible thoughts. This element is their\nnarrow content. Because narrow content is something all intrinsic\nduplicates must have in common, the hope is that such content could be\nthe very intrinsic properties that produce behavior. \n\nThe notion of narrow content might raise suspicion, however. Return to\nthe vending machine. The quarter Gus inserts in the machine has a\nparticular value owing to relations it bears to outside goings-on: it\nwas minted in the Denver mint. A counterfeit placed in the machine\ncould have the very same intrinsic makeup as the quarter, but it would\nlack the quarter’s value. It looks as though it is the\nquarter’s intrinsic makeup, not its value, that matters to the\noperation of the machine. Now imagine someone arguing that a quarter\nand an intrinsically indiscernible slug do in fact share a kind of\nvalue: narrow value. Because narrow value accompanies an\nobject’s intrinsic qualities, we need not regard narrow value as\nepiphenomenal. But what could narrow value be?  Whatever it is, could\nit in any way resemble value ordinarily conceived—broad\nvalue? Narrow value looks like a phony category posited ad\nhoc to accommodate an otherwise embarrassing\ndifficulty. Nevertheless, some philosophers remain optimistic about\nthe prospects of a viable internalist account of content, one\nthat would allow fully fledged thoughts to have a role in the\nproduction of behavior. (For references and further discussion,\nsee narrow mental content.) \n\nAnother, much different, attempt to preserve a causal role for content\ncan be found in Dretske 1988, 1989, 1993. So far we’ve assumed\nthat a behavioral event is distinct from the mental event that causes\nit. On Dretske’s view, however, behavior is a process\nthat includes, as a component, its mental cause. When mental\nevent a causes bodily movement\nb, the behavior in this case is not b itself, but \nthe process of a’s causing b. When Lilian raises her hand \nbecause she wants to get the teacher’s attention and she believes \nthat raising her hand will accomplish this end, her behavior is not \nher hand’s going up, but the process of this belief-desire pair’s \ncausing her hand to go up. \n\nDretske grants that when mental event a initiates\n(“triggers”) a process ending in bodily\nmovement b,\na does so solely in virtue of its intrinsic makeup. \nNevertheless, a’s relational, intentional properties have a \ncausal role, for they can be relevant to the fact that a causes \nb. Reasons are “structuring causes” of behavior: it’s because of\nwhat a indicates that it was “recruited” during the learning\nprocess as a cause of b. (Indication here is a matter of \nreliable co-variation.) It’s because, for example, Lilian’s belief \nindicates what it does—raising one’s hand (in these \ncircumstances) is a way to get the teacher’s attention—that it \nwas (together with the relevant desire) recruited as a cause of her \nhand-raising. Relational, intentional mental properties thus become \ncausally relevant to behavior, because they are relevant to \nstructuring the very causal processes that, on Dretske’s view, \nconstitute instances of behavior. \n\nDretske’s proposed solution quickly produced a number of\nresponses (e.g., Smith 1990; Block 1990; Baker 1991; Horgan 1991; Kim 1991; Mele\n1991). One question is whether relational, intentional properties\nin fact play a causal role in the structuring (or\n“wiring”) of causal processes in the brain. Even during the learning process, the states of Lilian’s brain would seem to\nbe sensitive only to local, intrinsic features of one another,\nfeatures that screen off external goings-on.  Dretske might be\nable to avoid such screening-off by appealing to the counterfactual\ndependence of behavior-structuring on these goings-on.  His view would\nthen stand or fall with the success of counterfactual theories of\ncausal relevance (§5.3). A second question is whether intentional\nstates, even if they were relevant in the way Dretske says they are,\ndeliver the kind of causal relevance we want. When Lilian\nraises her hand, the structuring of the relevant processes in her\nbrain has already occurred. If intentional properties are relevant at\nall, then, they are apparently relevant only to what happened in the\npast during the learning process. But we normally regard mental\nproperties as causally relevant to what’s going on here and now,\nthe very time when Lilian (or anyone) acts (but cf. Allen 1995; Dretske replies to critics in his 1991, esp. pp. 210-7). \n\nDretske’s proposal is a version of the dual explanandum\nstrategy (§6.3). The idea is that physical and mental properties\nare causally responsible for different effects.  For Dretske, the\n(triggering) physical properties are responsible for bodily motions,\nwhile the (structuring) mental properties are responsible for\nbehavior. \n\nAnother version of this strategy begins with a point also made in\n§6.3, namely that to question a property’s causal relevance\nis really to question its relevance to some property of the\neffect. The form of our central causal question, that is, is whether a\nmental cause qua F causes a behavioral effect\nqua G. Now when F is an intentional mental\nproperty, what G is the object of our question? One \npossibility is that it is a behavioral property that, like the mental\nproperty, is itself “broad” (see, e.g., Enc 1995). \n\nConsider a simple example: Suppose Lilian believes that a glass in\nfront of her contains water, and this belief (together with her\ndesires) causes her to reach for the glass. Her behavior is an\ninstance of trying to get water, and it’s the\ninstantiation of this property (and not, say, the property of\nbeing a certain kind of bodily motion) that we’re wondering\nabout when we ask whether the intentional property of her belief is\ncausally relevant.  (If our interest lay solely in explaining a\nparticular bodily motion, we would rest content with a\nnon-psychological, purely physiological explanation.) But now the\nanswer seems straightforward. For what makes Lilian’s\nbehavior a trying for water is that it’s caused by a\nbelief whose content concerns water. Once we realize that the\nbehavioral property of the effect is itself broad, its connection to\nthe intentional mental property seems clear. \n\nThis is not to say that the physical properties of Lilian’s\nbelief do no work: it’s just that they are responsible for a different\nproperty of the effect, for instance, the property of being a forward\narm-movement. The intentional properties of her belief are relevant to\nthe effect qua (broad) behavior; the physical properties are\nrelevant to the effect qua (narrow) bodily motion. And as we\nnoted earlier (§6.3), such a solution can be employed in response\nto the Exclusion Problem as well. If a mental property and its\nphysical realizer are relevant to different properties of the effect,\nthey need not compete causally. \n\nBecause it promises to solve two outstanding problems of mental\ncausation, this approach is potentially quite powerful. (For\ndiscussion, see Fodor 1991; Burge 1995.) One question to raise here,\nhowever, is whether the fact that some behavior can be described\nbroadly makes the intentional mental property of its cause relevant.\nThe undeniable conceptual connections between mental and behavioral\ndescriptions might point to a kind of explanatory relevance,\nbut it’s a further question whether causal connections grounding\nthese explanations involve broad properties. Those motivated by the\noriginal epiphenomenalist arguments will worry that narrow, physical\nproperties are really doing all the work here: the apparent relevance\nof the broad properties is an illusion created by the way we, in\ndescribing and explaining behavior, conceptualize both cause and\neffect (see Owens 1993). This point leads to a fourth, related\nresponse to the problem. \n\nSome theorists would challenge the distinction—implicit in the\nforegoing discussion—between explanation and causation. Our\nconcept of causality, they would insist, is bound up with the\nconcept of explanation: causally relevant properties are those that\nfigure in our best causal explanations (Segal and Sober 1991; Wilson\n1992; Burge 1993; Raymont 2001; §6.3). We find out what causal\nrelations amount to by starting with clear cases of causal\nexplanation. Given that we (and the cognitive scientists) routinely\nexplain physical events by citing mental causes (and mental events by\ninvoking physical causes), questioning whether real causal\nrelations answer to these explanations is to succumb to the kind of\nmetaphysical hubris that gives metaphysics a bad name. \n\nThis appeal to explanatory practice has the potential to answer in one\nfell swoop all four of the property-based problems we’ve\nconsidered. \n\nDoubtless our understanding of the notions of causality and causal\nrelevance depends importantly on our grasp of causal explanations.\nBut there are at least two areas of concern about the explanatory\nstrategy (compare Kim 1998, pp. 60–7). First, you might wonder\nwhether the strategy addresses the right question. Earlier,\nwe pointed out that the central question of mental causation is not so\nmuch whether mental properties are causally relevant but\nhow they could be, given some alleged feature of mental \nproperties (in the case at issue here, the feature is their being \nrelational properties). The explanatory strategy would at best seem \nto be addressing only the “whether” question, not the “how” question.\nSecond, even when restricted to the “whether” question, the strategy \nrests on a conflation of what appears to be an epistemological notion\n(explanation) with metaphysical notions (causation and causal \nrelevance). A full evaluation of the view would thus require a deeper\nlook into how the two are related. \n\nWe have been treating the problem of mental causation as though it\nwere a problem in applied metaphysics. Perhaps this approach is\nwrong-headed. Perhaps the problem really falls under the purview of\nthe philosophy of science. What if we began with a look at actual\nscientific practice (as suggested in §§6.3, 7.5) and\ndetermined what exactly science requires for acceptable causal\nexplanation? An examination of established special sciences reveals\nthat the very features (multiple realizability, higher-level and\n“broad” properties, for instance) metaphysically inclined\nphilosophers regard as posing apparently insuperable difficulties for\nmental causation, are routinely invoked in causal explanations in\nthose sciences. This suggests that, rather than let a priori\nconceptions of causation (or properties, or causal powers) lead us to\nregard mental causation with suspicion, we should reason in the other\ndirection: revise our conception of causation to fit our actual\nscientific beliefs and practices. If the metaphysicians were right\nabout causation, no science would be possible beyond basic physics\n(biological properties, for instance, would lack causal efficacy). \n\nThis is one way to go. Another way is to take a step backward and ask\nwhich features of our conception of the mental, features we commonly\ntake for granted, might be the source of our difficulties.\nEliminativists aside, all parties evidently agree that “realism\nabout the mental” requires that mental predicates figuring in\ncausal accounts of behavior designate distinctively mental\nproperties. If we aim to honor psychology (and the other special\nsciences), our job is to show how these properties could be causally\nrelevant to physical goings-on. Suppose, in contrast, that you took\nthe goal to be, not the preservation of mental properties,\nbut the preservation of mental truths. In that case we would\nseek an account of the mind that provides plausible truthmakers for\npsychological and psycho-physical claims, including claims concerning\nmental causation. \n\nOne possibility is that truthmakers for psychological truths include\nirreducibly mental properties. This is not the only possibility,\nhowever. Another is that psychological assertions are made true by\nphysical states and properties, states and properties answering to\npredicates belonging to physics and chemistry. A view of this kind\n(which is close to Davidson’s as spelled out in §5 and to\nthe identity solutions discussed in §6.5) would endeavor to\nresolve the problem of mental causation, not by tinkering with the\ncausal concept, but by rejecting the idea that mental and physical\nproperties are distinct kinds of property. All parties agree that\nmental predicates and descriptions differ from physical predicates and\ndescriptions. Application conditions for mental terms and physical\nterms diverge in ways that preclude definitional reduction of the one\nto the other. Perhaps it is a mistake, however, to move from this\nlinguistic fact to a substantive ontological thesis: mental and\nphysical predicates designate properties belonging to distinct\nfamilies of properties. \n\nWhether anything like this could be made to work is an open question.\nTo the extent that you regard the current state of play as \nunsatisfying, however, it is perhaps a question worth pursuing.","contact.mail":"darobb@davidson.edu","contact.domain":"davidson.edu"},{"date.published":"2003-12-18","date.changed":"2018-10-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/","author1":"David Robb","author1.info":"https://www.davidson.edu/academics/philosophy/faculty-and-staff/david-robb","author2.info":"http://philosophy.artsci.wustl.edu/people/John_Heil","entry":"mental-causation","body.text":"\n\n\n\nQuestions about the existence and nature of mental causation are\nprominent in contemporary discussions of the mind and human\nagency. Originally, the problem of mental causation was that of\nunderstanding how an immaterial mind, a soul, could interact with the\nbody. Most philosophers nowadays repudiate souls, but the problem of\nmental causation has not gone away. Instead, focus has shifted to\nmental properties. How could mental properties be causally\nrelevant to bodily behavior? How could something mental be a cause\nqua mental? After looking at the \ntraditional Problem of Interaction, we survey several versions of the\nproperty-based problem along with potential solutions. \n\n\n\nMental causation—the mind’s causal interaction with the\nworld, and in particular, its influence on behavior—is central\nto our conception of ourselves as agents. Mind–world interaction\nis taken for granted in everyday experience and in scientific\npractice. The pain you feel when you sprain your ankle causes you to open the freezer in search of an ice pack. An intention\nto go to the cinema leads you to get into your car. Psychologists\ntell us that mental images enable us to navigate our surroundings\nintelligently. Economists explain fluctuations in financial markets by\nciting traders’ beliefs about the price of oil next month. In\neach case, a mental occurrence appears to produce a series of complex\nand coordinated bodily motions that subsequently have additional downstream\neffects in the physical world. Instances of apparent mental causation\nare so common that they often go unremarked, but they are central to the\ncommonsense picture we have of ourselves. It’s not surprising,\nthen, that questions about the nature and possibility of mental\ncausation arise in variety of philosophical contexts. \n\nOntology: Suppose you accept the “Eleatic\nPrinciple” that power is the mark of being: to exist is to have\ncausal powers (Armstrong 1978, pp. 45-6; Oddie 1982). It’s plausible to think that if the\nmental has any causal powers at all, it can affect the physical\nworld. Without such powers, the mental faces ontological\nembarrassment, even elimination. \n\nMetaphysics: Mental causation is “at the heart of\nthe mind-body problem” (Shoemaker 2001, p. 74), often figuring explicitly in how the problem is formulated (Mackie 1979; Campbell 1984; Crane 1999). To ask how mind and body are related just is, in\npart, to ask how they could possibly affect one another. \n\nMoral psychology: Agency of the sort required for free will\nand moral responsibility\nappears to require mental causation. If your behavior is not caused by\nyour mind’s activities—its deliberations, decisions, and the\nlike—what sense would it make to hold you responsible for what\nyour body does? You would appear to be scarcely more than a passive\nobserver of your body’s activities. We would then need to abandon\nwhat Strawson (1962) calls our\n“reactive attitudes”, the moral attitudes and feelings (e.g., gratitude, resentment) so central to our interpersonal\nlives. \n\nAction theory: It is widely believed that psychological explanation hinges on the possibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and\ndesires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what\ngoes on in your mind could not explain what you do (Davidson 1963;\nMele 1992; for dissent, see “noncausalists” such as Ginet 1990; Sehon 2005; Tanney 2013; and see the essays\nin D’Oro 2013). These observations about agency suggest a more basic conceptual point:\nif minds did not influence behavior, in what sense would anyone\ntruly act? Sounds would be made, but no one\nwould mean anything by them. Bodies would move, but no one\nwould thereby do anything (Malcolm 1968; Horgan\n2007). \n\nAlthough each of the above points could be contested, collectively\nthey create pressure to address the problem of mental\ncausation—problem or problems: as will become clear,\nthere is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind’s\ncausal efficacy can arise. \n\nAt least since Hume, philosophers have assumed\nthat causal questions are largely empirical. We look to science to\ntell us, for example, the moon’s role in causing the tides, or\nsmoking’s contribution to lung cancer: these are not considered\nphilosophical questions. It might seem equally obvious that the\nmind’s causal role in producing behavior is also a matter for\nscience to settle. So is it in fact the case that working\nscientists, and in particular, psychologists, find it necessary to\nappeal to distinctively mental phenomena to account for behavior? Is\nthere evidence in neuroscience that mental states and processes figure\nin the production of actions? \n\nAlthough most psychologists would without hesitation accept the causal\ninteraction of minds and bodies, a small but growing number of\nempirical researchers have insisted that the evidence supports some\nversion of epiphenomenalism, the\nthesis that mental states, while caused by physical happenings, exert\nno efficacy in return. Wegner, a psychologist, contends that\naccumulated empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports\nepiphenomenalism, at least with respect to conscious willing (Wegner\n2002, 2004). He draws on influential work by Libet (1985, 2001, 2004) and others to argue that conscious intending is itself a product of nonconscious\nprocesses that do the real causal work, so that free will\nis “an illusion”. If Wegner and his colleagues are right, these results could have ancillary implications for the physical\nefficacy of mental states generally. \n\nBecause this research has received extensive treatment in recent work\non free will, we will not consider it further, but instead refer\ninterested readers to the sources cited above and to Mele 2014 for\ncritical discussion and references. Here we simply note that traditional\nand contemporary attempts to assess the efficacy of mental states have\nrun up against philosophical difficulties as well, difficulties that\ntend to overshadow the experimental evidence accumulated thus far. In\nthis sense, the efficacy of mind is quite unlike that of, say, the\nmoon or smoking. This will, we hope, become clear in the discussion to\nfollow. \n\nSome historians (e.g., Matson 1966; King 2007) say the mind-body\nproblem is relatively recent, the most important source\nbeing Descartes’s “real\ndistinction” between mind and body. That said, you can find\ntopics closely related to mental causation in, for example,\nPlato’s Phaedo and Aristotle’s De Anima,\nand it might turn out that many features of the contemporary debate\nare present in some form or other in pre-modern texts (Caston 1997). Skirting such historical questions, we begin with Descartes, who, for better or worse, set the agenda for modern\ndiscussions of mental causation. The cluster of causal problems\narising from the Cartesian conception of mind is The Problem of\nInteraction. \nAccording to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of thing,\nor, in the technical terminology of the day, distinct kinds\nof substance. Bodies, he held, are spatially extended\nsubstances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are\nunextended, thinking, feeling substances:\nsouls. (We use “soul” with no theological\nimplications to designate minds considered in the Cartesian way as\nimmaterial substances.) Despite recognizing these deep differences,\nDescartes accepted the common belief that mind and body causally\ninteract: “Everyone feels that he is a single person with both\nbody and thought so related by nature that the thought can move the\nbody and feel the things which happen to it” (in Cottingham et\nal. 1991, p. 228). But if minds and bodies are so radically different, it is not easy to see how they could interact.\nDescartes was well aware of the difficulty. Princess Elisabeth of\nBohemia puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter, pressing Descartes\nto tell her \n\nElisabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how\ncausation of bodies works: it must involve the cause’s\nimpelling the body, where this requires contact between\ncause and effect. Since a soul could never come into contact with a\nbody—souls have no spatial location—an immaterial soul\ncould never impel, and so could never causally interact with, a\nbody. \n\nElisabeth’s worries might seem quaint and outdated. Causal\nrelations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms,\nnot all of which are of the push-pull variety. Why shouldn’t\nsoul–body interaction simply be included as another sort of\n“non-mechanistic” causation (Richardson 1982)? But\nElisabeth’s objection is in fact just one version of a more\ngeneral worry about soul–body interaction, a worry that rests on\nthe following thesis about causation: \n\nElisabeth presumes that when an effect is bodily motion, the required\nnexus is spatial contact. But even if she is wrong about this (Garber 1983), (CN)\nnevertheless poses problems for the dualist: if contact is not the\nmind–body nexus, what is? \n\nOne line of thought appeals to the transference theory of causality.\nHere the idea is that identity—the persistence of \nsomething from cause to effect—provides the needed link. If \nsomething in a soul could become present in a body, this could \nbridge the immaterial and material. Descartes himself appears \nto accept such a theory, declaring in the Third Meditation that there\ncould be nothing in an effect not present in its total efficient \ncause (Descartes 1642/1996, p. 28). But now the problem reasserts itself: \nif, as the substance dualist insists, bodies and minds are radically different, \nthey have no properties in common. According to Descartes, a\nbody’s properties are modes of extension, ways of being extended, \nwhile a soul’s properties are modes of something quite different, \nthought or consciousness. If causation involved transference, a \nCartesian soul could not interact with a body \n(but see Hart 1988; Hoffman and Rosenkrantz 1991). \n\nDoes a dualist need to accept (CN), however? The notion of a causal nexus\nhas come under criticism, often from philosophers working in the\nHumean tradition (Blackburn 1990). More generally, (CN) and kindred\nprinciples might be thought to rest on a conception of causality that\nis now obsolete, finding no place in modern physics (for further \ndiscussion, see\n the metaphysics of causation,\n §2). But the next three versions of\nthe problem can arise even for those who reject the need for a causal\nnexus. \n\nA second version of the Problem of Interaction is the “Pairing\nProblem” (Kim 1973, 2005; Sosa 1984; Foster 1991, ch. 6).\nImagine two exactly similar minds M1\nand M2 and the bodies B1\nand B2 to which they are “attached”,\nthat is, the bodies with which they directly interact. In virtue of\nwhat is M1 causally paired\nwith B1, and M2\nwith B2? \n\nThis is not the epistemological question of how we could \nknow that these are the pairings (although this is \ntroublesome, too). The question, rather, is metaphysical: in virtue \nof what are these the pairings? If minds were, like bodies, \nlocated in space, causal pairing could be achieved by the relative \nspatial locations of the substances (Bailey et al. 2011). Particular minds might be inside\nor “inhabit” particular bodies. But if minds are non-spatial souls, \nrelative spatial location is unavailable to fill the pairing role. \nAnd since M1 and M2 are, by hypothesis, \nexactly similar, we cannot appeal to the different intrinsic \nproperties that they might possess. \n\nIn reply, a dualist could appeal to “individualistic”\npowers (Unger 2006, pp. 242–59; Foster 1991,\npp. 167–8). Powers are standardly thought of as powers to\ninteract with some type of object. A key has the\npower to open this lock, but only by virtue of having the power to\nopen any lock of this kind, the power to open any intrinsically\ncomparable lock. Individualistic powers, in contrast, are powers\npossessed by an object to affect or be affected by\na particular object. Think of a key with the power to\nopen this lock, but without the power to open any\nintrinsically indiscernible lock. Likewise, a soul could have the\npower to interact with a particular body and no other. As the key\nexample suggests, however, it is by no means obvious that\npowers could be individualistic in this sense. \n\nA third version of the Problem of Interaction appeals to conservation\nlaws. The leading idea is simple: Soul–body\ninteraction would have to change the amount of energy in the physical\nuniverse. When souls act, new energy would appear in, say, the\nbrain. When souls are acted upon, some quantity of energy in the brain\nwould vanish. But either scenario would contravene established\nconservation laws, which permit only the conversion and redistribution\nof energy (or mass–energy) within the physical universe, not its addition or\nsubtraction. \n\nThis version of the problem has dogged dualism since the scientific\nrevolution (Lowe 1992; Papineau 2000), and a number of contemporary\nphilosophers present conservation as a major obstacle for dualists\n(Fodor 1981; Dennett 1991, p. 35; Heil 2012, p. 26). That said, turning the leading idea into a compelling argument has proven difficult. First,\nwhat is needed is a conservation law weak enough to have been\nconfirmed by physical science, but strong enough to preclude\nsoul–body interaction. Averill and Keating (1981) consider a\nnumber of candidate “laws” and argue that none meets both\ncriteria. Second, it’s not clear in any case that a soul would\nhave to add energy to (or receive it from) the brain in order to\ninteract with it. The transference theory (§2.1) again seems to\nbe in the background here, but why accept it? Broad (1925,\npp. 103–9) suggests a soul could act merely by\nredistributing the brain’s energy without changing its\nquantity. (For more recent discussion of these and other complexities,\nsee Montero 2006; Koksvik 2007; Gibb 2010.) \n\nA fourth version of the Problem of Interaction is related to the\nthird, but, because it is more prominent in the contemporary literature, especially\nin some of the “property-based” problems we examine below, we will develop this last version at greater length. The first premise is: \nThe Completeness of the Physical: Every physical\neffect has a sufficient physical cause. \n\nWhen you trace the causal history of any physical effect—that\nis, of anything physical that has a cause—you will \nnever need to appeal to anything non-physical. The physical \nuniverse contains within itself the resources for a full causal explanation of \nany of its (caused) elements, and in this sense is “complete”. The \npoint applies, then, to whatever might occur to or within our bodies.\nAny instance of bodily behavior has a sufficient physical \ncause, which itself has a sufficient physical cause, and so on. In \ntracing the causal history of what we do, we need never appeal to \nanything non-physical. \n\nThis principle appears frequently in the mental causation literature\nunder a number of labels: most common are variations\nof Completeness of the Physical (Crane 1995, 2001; Papineau\n1993, 2000; O’Connor and Churchill 2010) or Physical\nClosure (Crane 1992; Baker 1993; Melnyk 2003; Kim\n2005). We’ll call it Completeness for short. \n\nLabels aside, several versions of the premise appear in the\nliterature, and they can differ in strength. Note that the principle\nas formulated says nothing about whether the non-physical can affect\nthe physical; a strengthened version prohibits this. (Closure\nis sometimes reserved for this stronger principle: LePore and Loewer\n1987; Kim 1998, p. 40; Marcus 2005; compare Strong Causal\nClosure in Montero 2003.) An even more ambitious version blocks\nthe non-physical from being cause or effect; such is\nsuggested in Davidson’s work (see §5.1 and McLaughlin 1989,\nwho uses Physical Comprehensiveness for this thesis.) As for\nweaker versions, Completeness could be limited to physical\neffects within the human body without affecting its relevance to the\ncurrent topic. Note also that the principle is apparently committed to\ndeterministic physical causation; a weakened version permits\nprobabilistic causes. (For complications with such a weakening, see\nMontero 2003, and for other challenges with\nformulating Completeness, Lowe 2000; Gibb 2015.) \n\nFor simplicity, we stay with the principle as formulated at the\noutset. Why think that it’s true? Perhaps it is a conceptual\ntruth: for an effect to be physical is, at least in part, for it to\nhave a physical cause. This defense turns on the proper analysis of\nthe concept physical, itself the subject of a contentious\nliterature (see physicalism). Here we\nsimply note that the principle does not seem analytic; it appears to be\na substantive, empirical claim about the causal structure of the\nuniverse. (For more on the conceptual defense, see Crane 1991;\nPapineau 1991, 1993, §1.9; Lowe 1996, p. 56.) \n\nIt’s natural, then, to look to science for a defense, and\nespecially physics (or physiology). Appeals to “current physical\ntheory” (Antony and Levine 1997, p. 100), “the development\nof the sciences” (LePore and Loewer 1987, p. 630), and\n“physics textbooks” (Melnyk 2003, p. 289) are common, but\nwhat exactly in physical science supports the premise?\nPapineau’s (2000) historical survey outlines two arguments. The\nfirst is inductive: when physics has investigated the nature of\n“special”, macroscopic forces, it has discovered that they\nall reduce to a small number of basic, conservative physical\nforces. Generalizing from this evidence, the idea is that all such\nforces will reduce to the same small set of physical forces. The\nsecond argument aims at establishing a weaker version\nof Completeness, one restricted to the human\nbody. Were Completeness false owing to the routine\nintervention of souls, physiology would have discovered anomalies\nwithin the human body, events that have no physical explanation. But a\ncentury of increasingly detailed investigation has revealed no such\nanomalies. It appears as if the causes operating within our bodies are\nentirely physical (compare Armstrong 1968/1993, pp. 32–3; Melnyk\n2003, p. 289; for a response, see Montero 2003). \n\nWe will look at challenges to Completeness in a moment, but\nnote for now that the premise by itself does not preclude the efficacy\nof souls. Even if every physical effect has a sufficient physical\ncause, some physical effects might have non-physical causes\nas well. This latest version of the Problem of Interaction thus\nrequires a second premise: No Overdetermination: There is no systematic\noverdetermination of physical effects. \n\nThis principle enjoys wide support in the literature. It is said that\npostulating systematic overdetermination in this context is\n“absurd” (Kim 1993a, p. 281), one of the\n“nonstarters” in the mental causation debate (Kim 1998,\np. 65). But why? Perhaps it just looks like bad engineering (Schiffer\n1987, p. 148). Or maybe the problem is that it would involve an\n“intolerable coincidence” (Melnyk 2003, p. 291): every\ntime you act, there are two independent causal processes—one from\nyour brain, another from your soul—converging on the same\neffect. With the two premises now in place, the Problem of Interaction in\nour final version is straightforward. Assume for reductio\nthat our souls routinely cause behavior. By Completeness,\nsuch effects also have sufficient physical causes, so behavior is\nsystematically overdetermined. But this contradicts No\nOverdetermination. The dualist’s options would then seem to\nbe severely limited. One is to embrace epiphenomenalism, a doctrine on\nwhich the mental, while caused by the physical, exerts no\n“downward” causal influence in return. A more radical\noption, parallelism, depicts bodies and souls as running in tandem,\nwith no causal influence in either direction. \n\nThe two premises can, however, be challenged. Start\nwith Completeness. Baker (1993), not herself a Cartesian\ndualist, argues that if the principle threatens to undermine our\nordinary (and scientific) explanatory practices—many of which\ncite the mental—it’s Completeness that has to\ngo. Entrenched explanatory practices trump any abstract metaphysical\nprinciples with which they might conflict (see also §§6.3,\n7.5). Others argue that physical science, far from supporting the\nprinciple, may in fact undermine it. Hendry (2006) finds indications\nof “downward causation” in chemistry, while Stapp (2005)\nculls evidence from contemporary physics suggesting that there are,\ncontrary to Completeness, causal gaps in the physical world,\ngaps filled in by the mental (see also Sturgeon 1998; Davies\n2006). Emergentists in general deny the principle, either on\nscientific grounds or by appeal to our conscious experiences of agency\n(see emergent properties,\nesp. §4). And although the death of emergentism has been declared\nmore than once on empirical grounds (McLaughlin 1992; Papineau 2000),\nthe view continues to attract philosophers and scientists. (See the contributions to Clayton and Davies 2006; Bedau and Humphreys 2008; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010; Paoletti and Orilia 2017.) \n\nNo Overdetermination has been targeted as well. Mills (1996),\nfor example, defends mental–physical overdetermination as the most \nplausible route for the dualist to take. Overdetermination is \nplausible, the reasoning goes, if for any behavioral effect \nB, both a non-physical (mental) cause M and \nphysical cause P satisfy the following counterfactual \nconditionals (among others): \n\nIf the dualist can reasonably claim that (1) and (2) are true, this\nwill make a strong prima facie case for\noverdetermination. Along different lines, Lowe (2003) presents a model\nof dualist interaction on which, owing to systematic mind–body\ndependencies, overdetermination is not the intolerable coincidence\nworrying opponents of dualism. And more generally, the ban on\nsystematic overdetermination has come under increased scrutiny in the\ncontext of the Exclusion Problem, to be discussed in §6. \n\nCartesian dualism has fallen out of favor among philosophers and\ncognitive scientists. There are, to be sure, non-Cartesian forms of\nsubstance dualism that might have the resources to confront the\nProblem of Interaction in its various guises (Hasker 1999; Lowe\n2006). But the dominant view today would appear to be that if the mind\nis a substance at all, it is a physical substance—the brain, for\ninstance. This sort of “substance monism” is in fact a\nconsequence of the more general token identity theory: every\nconcrete mental particular (token) is physical. We will assume token\nidentity in what follows: minds, mental events, and any other mental\n“objects” are physical\n(see the mind/brain identity theory).\n  \n\nWhat becomes of the Problem of Interaction on such a view? It would \nseem to dissolve. While causation between brain and body is complex, \neven to the point of being empirically inscrutable, it does not pose \nthe same problems as soul–body interaction. There are no special \nphilosophical problems with brain–body interaction, nor is there \nanything especially odd or worrisome about an event in your brain \ncausing, say, your arm to go up. Any philosophical questions here \nbelong to \n the metaphysics of causation\n generally and have no special application to mental causation. \n\nNevertheless, philosophical worries about mental causation persist.\nTheoretical and commonsensical considerations leading us to think the\nmind or mental events cause behavior should also make us think that\nthey do so as mental, i.e., in virtue of their mental\n properties.\nProperties figure in causal relations (Kim 1973; Mackie 1974, ch. 10;\nArmstrong 1989, pp. 28–9; Ehring 1997). Drop a square\npaperweight into soft clay and it will produce an impression. The\nshape of the impression can be traced to the shape of the paperweight,\nthe depth of the impression to the mass of the paperweight. Here shape\nand mass are “causally relevant” or “causally\nefficacious” properties. In particular, they are relevant to\ncertain properties of the impression. By contrast, other properties of\nthe paperweight, such as its color or value, appear to be irrelevant\nto producing this kind of impression. Or consider a soprano who sings\na high note, thereby shattering a glass. The sound, we can suppose,\nhas a meaning—a semantic property—but it is the\nsound’s acoustic properties that are operative in producing the\nshattering; the semantic properties play no causal role, at least not\nwith respect to this effect (Dretske 1989). \n\nBy themselves, these observations pose no special problem for the \nphilosopher of mind. While the notion of a causally relevant property\ncalls for analysis (Horgan 1989; Dardis 1993; Braun 1995), there\nis no reason at the outset for a token-identity theorist to be \nespecially concerned about the efficacy of mental properties.\nGus smiles because of the way his food tastes, that phenomenal \nproperty; Lilian walks to school along a particular route because of \nwhat she believes, that representational property. Assuming the \nmind is something physical, why should a mind’s causing behavior in\nvirtue of its mental properties be any more puzzling than a \npaperweight’s causing a square impression in virtue of its shape? \n\nRecent philosophical work on mental properties has revealed that\nmatters are not so simple, however. Mental properties are alleged to\nhave, not just one, but up to four features that make their\nefficacy philosophically puzzling, no less problematic than\nmind–body interaction is for the Cartesian dualist. These\nfeatures will be discussed in the following sections. Each feature\nmakes it appear as though mental properties, or some important family\nof them, are irrelevant to the production of behavior. The threat is a\nform of epiphenomenalism: even if minds and mental events are causes,\nthey are not causes as (or qua) mental. \n\nThis “new epiphenomenalism” (Campbell 1984, ch. 7)\nimmediately confronts a particularly strong version of\nproperty dualism, \none insisting that mental properties are sui generis, perhaps dependent on, but in no\nway reducible to the dispositional and structural properties\nrecognized by the physical sciences. Some property dualists accord\nthis status only to a certain class of mental property, namely\n qualia,\nthe “what it’s like” features of conscious\nexperience. Other property dualists, including\nsome emergentists, are willing\nto extend the thesis to all mental properties. \n\nSuppose that this robust form of property dualism is true. Can mental\nsubstances or events cause what they do qua mental, in virtue\nof their mental properties? The arguments against soul–body\ninteraction, now couched in terms of properties, could enter again\nhere. For example, if you were worried about the mind–body nexus\nfor souls (§2.1), it seems you should also wonder how\nnon-physical properties can find any traction in the physical\nworld. Similarly, Completeness (§2.4) seems to lose none\nof its attractiveness when formulated explicitly in terms of properties. You could add to the principle\na clause stipulating that a “sufficient physical cause” is\none that’s sufficient in virtue of its physical properties (see\nalso §5.4). Bring in No Overdetermination, and the\nefficacy of mental properties is again threatened. The arguments here\nand the responses to it are structurally similar to those in §2,\nso we will not pursue further this version of the property-based\nproblem.  (Property dualism also faces the Exclusion Problem, to be\ndiscussed in §6.) \n\nAnother version of the property-based problem of mental causation can\nbe traced to\n Davidson’s\n influential paper, “Mental Events” (Davidson 1970). \nThere Davidson defends an account of the mind–body \nrelation he calls \n “anomalous monism”,\na view that at first appears to save mental causation, but in the \nend might deny efficacy to mental properties. \n\nAt the core of anomalous monism are three principles: Principle of Causal Interaction: Some mental\nevents interact causally with physical events.  \n\nPrinciple of the Nomological Character of Causality: Events \nrelated as cause and effect fall under strict laws. \n\nAnomalism of the Mental: There are no strict laws on the \nbasis of which mental events can be predicted and explained. \n\nAccording to Davidson, the apparent tension among these principles\ngives rise to the mind–body problem. Most of us unquestioningly\nassent to the first principle. The second is more controversial,\nalthough Davidson provides little argument for it. Here we just note\nthat it’s not as strong as it seems, for\n“strict” is not synonymous with\n“deterministic”. A strict law is exceptionless,\nbut could be either deterministic or probabilistic. \n\nThe third principle is the most contested of the three. It rules out\nstrict laws in psychology; in particular—and most importantly for\npresent concerns—it rules out strict psychophysical\nlaws, that is, laws connecting the mental and physical. According to\nDavidson, application conditions for mental predicates feature a\nrationality constraint absent from the application conditions for\nphysical predicates. In ascribing beliefs to others, for instance, we\nemploy a principle of charity that counsels us to make these\nbelievers as rational as possible. But this normative constraint has,\nas Davidson puts it, “no echo” in the physical realm. In\nthis regard, mental and physical predicates are misaligned in a way\nthat precludes strict psychophysical laws. \n\nNow the second two principles seem to rule out the first. If causation\nrequires strict laws, and there are no strict psychophysical laws, how\ncan the mental be causally efficacious? But Davidson notes there is a\nway to save the first principle: as long as every mental event is\nphysical, the first principle is compatible with the other two. In\nthis way, the three principles entail event monism. At the\nsame time, Davidson’s view entails type dualism, for\nthe anomalism of the mental (the third principle) precludes identities\nbetween mental and physical types. Most philosophers find it natural\nto say that types are properties, so Davidson is sometimes described\nas a property dualist, a convenient label for the time being (but see §5.5). \n\nDavidson’s property dualism, and the principle that lies behind\nit, have led to a serious charge: anomalous monism robs mental\nproperties of any causal significance. \n\nSuppose Gus decides to illuminate the room and subsequently flips a\nswitch, thereby turning on the light. In this case we have a cause\nthat, if Davidson is right, could be given both a mental and a\nphysical description, and an effect that has a physical\ndescription. If this means that the cause has a mental\nproperty (in virtue of which it satisfies a mental description)\nand a physical property (in virtue of which it satisfies a\nphysical description), we are faced with a further question. Granting that\nthe event with the mental property is the event with a\nphysical property, why should we think that the mental\nproperty had anything at all to do with the event’s physical\neffect?  Davidson’s second two principles appear to block such\nrelevance. If all causal relations are subsumed under strict laws, and\nif there are no strict psychophysical laws, then any instance of\nmind–body causation is subsumed only by physical laws. But\nthen it looks as though only a mental event’s physical\nproperties are relevant to what it causes. The mental properties (or\nmental types) are causally irrelevant (see, e.g., Stoutland 1980; Honderich\n1982; Sosa 1984; a review of this literature is in\nMcLaughlin 1989). \n\nLePore and Loewer (1987) look to counterfactuals to answer this charge\n(see also Horgan 1989; LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990; Loewer\n2007). The central idea is that anomalous monism permits physical\neffects to depend counterfactually on mental properties. And such\ndependence secures an important kind of causal relevance for the\nmental, the sort that LePore and Loewer call “bringing\nabout”. On their view, a’s being F\nbrings about b’s being G when the following\nconditions are met: \n\nNow suppose a mental event, such as a decision to turn on the light,\ncauses Gus to move his finger, thereby flipping the light switch. Here\nthe crucial counterfactual is: If the cause had not been a decision to\nturn on the light, the effect would not have been a\nswitch-flipping. This is plausible, as are similar counterfactuals in\na wide range of cases. But are such counterfactuals compatible with\nanomalous monism? LePore and Loewer say Yes: while Davidson\nprohibits strict laws connecting mental and physical\nproperties, he apparently leaves room for non-strict laws. Such laws\nare enough to ground or “support”\ncounterfactuals. Consider, by analogy, the properties of being a\nmatch-striking and being a match-lighting. If there is a\nlaw connecting such properties, it is evidently non-strict: striking\ncauses lighting only ceteris paribus.  Nevertheless, we can\nassert with confidence, after a given lighting, that if the match had\nnot been struck, it wouldn’t have lit.  Non-strict\npsychophysical laws would similarly appear to ground counterfactuals\nconnecting mental and behavioral properties. \n\nThis counterfactual defense is attractive for a number of reasons. It\ncaptures a sense in which mental properties make a difference to\nbehavior, but in a way that’s apparently compatible with\nanomalous monism. It respects our causal intuitions about a wide range of cases. And it fits well with the more\ngeneral counterfactual theory of causation,\n which many philosophers have found independently\nplausible. Moreover, Davidson himself seems sympathetic to the defense\n(Davidson 1993; but see §5.5). \n\nIn spite of these advantages, a worry is that the pertinent counterfactuals don’t after all ensure causal relevance, and in\nthis sense don’t vindicate anomalous monism. This objection can\ntake the form of direct counterexamples (Braun 1995; Garrett 1999),\nbut here we look at a broader concern. \n\nWhen a counterfactual is true, there should be something in the world\nthat makes it true. Even granting that, if the cause had not had its\nmental property, the effect would not have had its behavioral\nproperty, in virtue of what is this true? This truthmaker, not the\ncounterfactual itself, is what matters in determining whether a\nproperty is causally relevant. And the worry is that once we look at\nthe truthmakers in the mental case, the threat of epiphenomenalism\ncrops up again. Although the effect counterfactually depends on the\nmental property, this is only because the mental property depends on a\nphysical property doing the real work. The mental property looks like\na freeloader (Kim 1998, pp. 70–3, 2007; compare Crane 2008 on a\nsimilar issue). \n\nLePore and Loewer discuss a version of this worry. Condition (3), an\nobjector might say, is too crude to test for causal relevance, for the\ncounterfactual holds only because removing F\nfrom a also removes some other property F*\nof a, and it’s the absence of F* that’s\nresponsible for b’s not being G. A better\ncounterfactual test evaluates the effect’s status given\nthat a is not F and all\nof a’s other properties—or at least all that are\npotential causal rivals to F—are held\nfixed. If b is not G in that case, only then can we\ncredit F with causal relevance. But mental properties fail\nthis more refined test. Consider again Gus’s decision to turn on\nthe light, and remove its mental property, this time holding fixed its\nphysical properties. It seems clear that he would still flip the\nswitch. After all, the physical properties of the cause figure in an\nexceptionless law according to Davidson. It looks as if the physical properties of your decision “screen\noff” the mental property, making the latter irrelevant. \n\nLePore and Loewer concede that mental properties are screened off by\nphysical properties. But they argue that this more refined test is too\ndemanding, for it would also mean that the physical properties of a\nmental cause are irrelevant. Note in particular that the\ndecision’s mental properties screen off its physical properties:\nif the cause had lacked its physical properties yet had still been a\ndecision to turn on the light, it would have caused Gus to flip the\nswitch (ceteris paribus: here a hedged law, which anomalous\nmonism permits, is in play). Screening off thus goes both ways, and\nsince few would want to deny causal relevance to the physical\nproperties, we should not let screening off impugn the significance of\nmental properties either. \n\nAntony (1991) replies that there is no\nsymmetry here, at least not given anomalous monism. While the\ndecision’s physical properties screen off its mental\nproperties, the reverse doesn’t hold. Suppose again that the\ncause had lacked its physical properties but had still been a decision\nto turn on the light. On anomalous monism, Antony argues,\nthere’s no saying what Gus’s decision would have caused,\nfor mental properties, being anomalous, place no constraints on the\ncausal structure of the world. (See also Leiter and Miller 1994.) \n\nThe freeloader problem arises in a variety of contexts in the mental\ncausation literature, not just in discussions of anomalous monism. It\nwill return under a number of guises in what follows. \n\nFodor (1989) apparently agrees that counterfactuals capture a kind of\ncausal relevance, but he argues that LePore and Loewer have settled\nfor too little. On Fodor’s view, mental properties can be\nrelevant to behavior in a stronger sense in which they\nare sufficient for their effects and in this way “make\na difference”. Fodor spells out sufficiency in terms of laws: a\nproperty makes a difference if “it’s a property in virtue\nof the instantiation of which the occurrence of one event is\nnomologically sufficient for the occurrence of another” (Fodor\n1989, p. 65, note omitted). \n\nMight such an account save anomalous monism from the charge of\nepiphenomenalism? On the face of it, it cannot, for as we’ve\nnoted, mental properties on Davidson’s view appear only in\nhedged laws, laws that include an implicit ceteris paribus\nrider. Consider a candidate psychological law: \n\nThe ceteris paribus clause here would seem to block the\nmental properties in question from being causally sufficient for the\nbehavioral effect. But perhaps not: according to (L), the mental\nproperties are sufficient for the behavioral effect when the\nceteris paribus conditions are satisfied. And this sort of \ncausal sufficiency, Fodor argues, is all anyone could reasonably want for\nmental properties. \n\nBut can Davidson help himself to such an account? Davidson appears to\nthink so (1993, p. 10), as does McLaughlin (1989), who also appeals to\nhedged laws. Fodor, however, doubts his account is compatible with\nanomalous monism; such doubts are developed by Antony (1991) and Kim\n(1993b). The question turns largely on Davidson’s reasons for\nthinking the mental is anomalous, and on whether these reasons permit\nhim to appeal to hedged laws in the way the laws account requires. \n\nSupposing anomalous monism is compatible with Fodor’s account,\nyou might still wonder whether nomological sufficiency is enough for\ncausal relevance. An account of causal relevance in terms of laws is\nnatural given the tight connections between laws and properties\n(see laws of nature, §3). But\nthose sympathetic to Fodor’s position might still ask (as Fodor\nhimself does) what the causal mechanism is in mental–physical\ninteractions. For example, it could turn out that the reason\npsychophysical laws such as (L) hold is that mental properties are\nthemselves grounded in more basic, physical properties, and that only\nthe latter do genuine causal work: mental properties again look like\nfreeloaders (§5.3), merely piggybacking on the real bearers of\ncausal powers (LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990; Leiter and Miller 1994; Marras 2003). \n\nDavidson replies to his critics in “Thinking Causes”\n(Davidson 1993). In that paper he sometimes speaks favorably of\n“causally efficacious” properties, and he helps himself to\nboth hedged laws and counterfactuals to secure the efficacy of mental\nproperties. But his considered position appears less conciliatory. He\nclearly denies a crucial assumption of his critics, namely, that\ncauses do their causing in virtue of their properties. When an event\ncauses something, it doesn’t do so qua this or that: it\njust causes what it does, full stop. Were this so, none of the\nproperty-based problems discussed here could get off the ground (Crane\n1995; Campbell 1997; Gibb 2006). \n\nSuch a response seems to miss the point (Kim 1993b; McLaughlin 1993;\nSosa 1993). All parties in this dispute agree that mental events can\ncause physical events. The difficulty is to understand how they could\ndo so in virtue of their mental\n(rather than their physical) properties, how they could have physical\neffects qua mental. The principle of the Nomological\nCharacter of Causation (§5.1) apparently requires that, when one\nevent causes another, it does so in solely virtue of its physical\nproperties. \n\nBut Davidson is part of\na nominalist tradition that\nrejects properties, at least as his critics conceive of them. Davidson\ninstead formulates anomalous monism in terms of predicates\nand descriptions. An event is mental if it answers to a\nmental predicate (that is, it can be picked out using a mental description), physical if it answers to a physical\npredicate (it can be referred to using a physical description). Davidson’s critics assume that if an event answers to both sorts of predicate, it\nincludes a mental property and a physical property. But Davidson\nthinks about the mental–physical distinction as merely a\ndifference in description, not as the expression of an ontological\ndivide between kinds of property. For Davidson, then, it makes no more\nsense to ask whether an event had a particular effect in virtue of\nbeing mental or in virtue of being physical than it would to ask\nwhether its effect stemmed from its being described in English or in\nGerman. (For further discussion, see Heil 2009.) \n\nWhile reflection on property dualism or anomalous monism can lead to\nour next property-based problem, another route is by way of the\ndoctrine of\n non-reductive physicalism. \nLike the property dualist, the non-reductive physicalist holds that\nmental properties are not physical.  But unlike the property dualist,\nthe non-reductive physicalist insists on a strong dependence of the\nmental on the physical: mental properties are “realized” or “constituted” by physical\nproperties. This strong tie between the mental and physical is the\nsubject of a large contemporary literature, some of which we touch on\nbelow. \n\nNon-reductive physicalism in its current form grew out\nof functionalism, according to which\nmental properties are functional properties. To be in pain, for\nexample, is a matter of being in a state with a certain causal\nprofile, a state that’s caused by tissue damage, and causes\ncertain overt responses (moans, attempts to repair the damage, beliefs\nthat one is in pain). But, argue functionalists, it is most unlikely\nthat we could identify a single kind of physical state playing this role in every actual and possible case of pain. Human\nbeings differ in endless tiny physiological ways: your neurological\nstates, including states you go into when you are in pain, probably\ndiffer subtly from another person’s. Human beings’\nneurological states, in turn, differ from those of a cat or a dog, and\nperhaps dramatically from states of an octopus. You might even imagine\nencountering aliens with vastly different biologies, but to which you\nwould unhesitatingly ascribe pains. \n\nHere we arrive at a core thesis of functionalism: states of mind are \n “multiply realizable”.\nThe property of being in pain can be realized in a wide variety of\nphysical (and perhaps non-physical) systems. A creature is in pain in\nvirtue of being in a state with the right sort of causal profile, some\nsort of neurological state, say. But the property of being in pain cannot\nbe identified with this neurological state, because\ncreatures of other kinds can be in pain in virtue of being in vastly\ndifferent physical conditions. Functionalists often put this point by\nsaying that mental properties are “higher-level”\nproperties, properties possessed by objects by virtue of their\npossession of appropriate “lower-level” properties, their\nrealizers. \n\nNow, however, we are again confronted with the threat of\nepiphenomenalism. If mental properties are not physical,\nhow could they make a causal difference? Whenever any mental\n(functional) property M is instantiated, it will be realized\nby some particular physical property P. This physical\nproperty is unproblematically relevant to producing various behavioral\neffects. But then what causal work is left for M to do? It\nseems to be causally idle, “excluded” by the work\nof P. \n\nThis version of the problem of mental causation has appeared in\nvarious guises. Much of the contemporary literature is inspired by Malcolm 1968, especially as refined in Kim 1989, 1993c, 1998, 2005. Whatever its precise formulation (cp. Shapiro and Sober 2007; O’Connor and Churchill 2010; historical perspective is in Patterson 2005), the Exclusion Problem has clear affinities with the other problems we’ve looked at so far. Consider our claim that the realizing property P must play a role in producing a particular behavioral effect. This would seem to be justified either\nby an appeal to Completeness (§2.4) or to\nDavidson’s doctrine (§5.1) that causal relations must fall\nunder strict (and so physical) laws. Moreover, the argument’s\ndepiction of P and M as competing for causal\nrelevance—one must exclude the other—would seem to require\na principle such as No Overdetermination (§2.4). And the\nfundamental worry that P might exclude M looks\nexactly like the freeloader problem that badgers mainstream attempts\nto save anomalous monism (§§5.3–4). \n\nIn spite of these similarities, the Exclusion Problem is in one\nimportant respect unique: unlike the problems we’ve looked at so\nfar, exclusion worries generalize to a wide range of phenomena outside\nof the mental. Any properties, mental or otherwise, that are\nmultiply realizable in physical systems are threatened with causal\nirrelevance. (For discussion of this and related issues, see Kim 1998,\npp. 77–87; Noordhof 1999; Bontly 2001; Gillett and Rives 2001;\nBlock 2003; Walter 2008.) \n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Fodor 1989; Baker 1993; Shapiro 2010) take this general\nnature of the problem to be an encouraging sign. We happily\naccept biological, or meteorological, or geological properties as\ncausally significant despite their being distinct from their physical\nrealizers. Why then imagine that exclusion threatens the efficacy of\nmental properties? Others turn this argument around, insisting that\nthe alleged efficacy of biological and other “special\nscience” properties is by no means sacrosanct (Antony\n1995). Causal powers we attribute to them must respect what our best\nmetaphysics tells us. And in any case, the central issue is not so\nmuch whether mental properties (and the rest) are causally\nrelevant to the production of physical effects, but how\nthey could be (Kim 1998, pp. 61–2, 78–9; Antony\nand Levine 1997, p. 96; McLaughlin 2006). Even if the Exclusion\nProblem, because it generalizes, does not tempt us to embrace\nepiphenomenalism, it presses on us a responsibility to explain how\nmental properties could play a causal role given that they appear to\nbe screened off by their physical realizers. \n\nThe Exclusion Problem is the subject of a large and still-growing \nliterature. In the next few sub-sections, we look at some of the main\nlines of response, dividing them into three broad categories. \n\nThe Exclusion Problem presents us with a picture on which \nhigher-level mental properties compete with their \nlower-level physical realizers. Physical properties are \nunproblematically relevant in the production of behavior, and so \nmental properties must either find a way to do the work that their \nrealizers are already doing or face exclusion. But some philosophers \nwould insist that this picture is deeply misleading: mental \nproperties enjoy causal relevance in their own right and are not \nthreatened by exclusion from physical properties. \n\nThis “autonomy solution” (Jackson 1996, §2) can take\na variety of forms. One version starts by observing that psychological\nexplanations—and more generally, explanations in the special\nsciences—are in an important sense independent of physical\nexplanations. Psychological explanations typically abstract away from\ndetails of lower-level implementation, appealing instead to their own\ndistinctive kinds and laws. Explanations in the special sciences can\nthus proceed independently of those in the lower-level physical\nsciences. If the structure of the causal order reflects these\nexplanatory practices, mental properties need not be threatened by\nexclusion. Mental and physical causes can peacefully\ncoexist. (Variations on this theme appear in Dennett 1973; Baker 1993;\nVan Gulick 1993; Garrett 1998; Hardcastle 1998; Marcus 2001; Menzies 2003; Raymont\n2003; Ross and Spurrett 2004; Woodward 2008; Zhong 2014; see also §7.5.) \n\nThis appeal to explanation can naturally lead to (though it does not\nentail) another autonomy solution, the dual explanandum\nstrategy. The Exclusion Problem presents a mental (functional)\nproperty M and its physical realizer P as competing\nto be causally relevant to the same effect, namely a bit of\nbehavior. But M might not be threatened with exclusion\nif M and P are causally relevant to different\nproperties of the effect. Return for a moment to the paperweight\nexample from §3. The shape of the paperweight is relevant, not to\nthe impression simpliciter, but to the\nimpression’s shape. In general, a causally relevant\nproperty is relevant to some particular property of the effect (Horgan\n1989). Perhaps, then, M and P do not causally\ncompete because they are parts of separate, autonomous causal lines to\ndifferent properties of the effect. \n\nConsider one way this might work. Behavioral properties, just like\nmental properties, appear to be multiply realizable. For example,\nthere is more than one way to hail a cab, many different physical\nrealizations of this kind of behavior. Now suppose a belief causes you\nto hail a cab. In accordance with Completeness, some physical\nproperty P of the belief is sufficient for your behavior. But\nstrictly speaking, P is relevant only to the\nparticular way in which you hailed the cab, the particular\nphysical realization of your hailing. What, then, is responsible for\nyour behavior’s higher-level property of simply\nbeing a cab-hailing? It’s natural to suppose that it’s a \nhigher-level property of your belief, namely, some mental property, \nsuch as the belief’s representational content. (For proposals along \nthese lines, see Yablo 1992; Thomasson 1998; Marras 1998; Crisp and \nWarfield 2001; Gibbons 2006; Schlosser 2009; see also §§7.3–4.) \n\nA strength of autonomy solutions is that they secure a causal role for\nmental properties without running afoul of Completeness, as\nthe physical realization of behavior is always matched with some\nphysical properties of its cause. But do autonomy solutions\nrespect No Overdetermination? Here matters are not as\nstraightforward. Autonomy solutions present us with two\nproperties, P and M, each sufficient for the\nbehavioral effect. It might seem as if the dual explanandum strategy\navoids this awkwardness, since P and M are relevant\nto different properties of the effect. But even here,\noverdetermination threatens, as the effect’s behavioral property\nis produced twice: directly by M, and indirectly\nby P, which produces the behavioral property’s physical\nrealizer, which itself necessitates the behavioral property. \n\nProponents of autonomy solutions might grant these points but claim\nthat such “overdetermination” is innocuous, far from the\n“intolerable coincidence” threatening Cartesian dualist\naccounts of mental causation (§2.4), for the two causal lines\npresent are not independent. (The nature of overdetermination has\nitself become the subject of a literature inspired, in part, by the\nExclusion Problem. See, e.g., Funkhouser 2002; Bennett 2003;\nSider 2003; Walter 2008; Carey 2011; Bernstein 2016.) \n\nAutonomy solutions can make it appear that the causal powers of mental\nproperties “float free” of their physical realizers,\nbringing to mind the doctrine of parallelism (for replies, see\nThomasson 1998; Marcus 2001, §3.3). Some non-reductive\nphysicalists have accordingly looked to tie the causal powers of\nmental properties more closely to those of their physical\nrealizers. The idea is that mental properties are so intimately\nrelated to their realizers that the former “inherit” the\ncausal powers of the latter. The relation between levels is not one of\nrivalry, such that the physical might exclude the mental, but one of\ncooperation. Nor, moreover, does there seem to be any threat of\noverdetermination, since the mental works through the\nphysical. (Compare the metaphor of “transparency” in\nJackson 1996.) \n\nOn some versions of the inheritance solution, what the higher-level\nmental property derives from its physical realizer is some weaker or\n“lower-grade” form of causal relevance. For example,\nJackson and Pettit (1988, 1990) distinguish the robust “causal\nefficacy” of physical properties from the weaker “causal\nrelevance” of higher-level properties. Causal relevance in this\nsense is an explanatory notion: as one might put it, behavior is\nproduced at the physical level, but by being realized in the physical,\nmental properties inherit an explanatory relevance they wouldn’t\nhave otherwise. An advantage of such a view is that it accords a\nderived form of relevance to mental properties, but in a way that\nrespects both the priority of physical causation embodied\nin Completeness as well as the principle of No\nOverdetermination. (For similar views, see Kim 1984; Levine 2001,\n§1.5; Segal 2009. Those who appeal to the counterfactual\ndependence of behavior on the mental [§5.3] might also fall into\nthis category. For an answer to the charge that counterfactual\ndependence is “causation lite”, see Loewer 2007; Menzies\n2007.) \n\nIf such a weakening seems to amount to epiphenomenalism, you might\nlook for an inheritance solution on which mental properties are\nefficacious in the same sense that their physical realizers are\n(compare the “homogeneity assumption” in Crane 1995). How\ncan this be done without violating No Overdetermination?\nWell, suppose that a mental property is, in spite of being distinct\nfrom its physical realizer, immanent in this\nrealizer; M, that is, is somehow nothing over and\nabove P. In that case, any causal work done by P is,\nin a straightforward way, inherited by M. Overdetermination\nis avoided because M’s work is included\nin P’s. \n\nThe metaphysical details of such a picture matter. Otherwise,\n“immanence”, “nothing over and above”, and the\nlike will turn into mere labels for that psychophysical relation, we\nknow not what, that solves the Exclusion Problem. Accordingly, several\npromising lines of inquiry have been pursued. Mental and physical\nproperties are said to be related by, for example, the\ndeterminable–determinate relation (Yablo 1992; critics include\nEhring 1996; Worley 1997; Funkhouser 2006), constitution (Pereboom\n2002; critics include Ney 2007; Heil 2011), metaphysical necessitation\n(Bennett 2003, 2008), physical explicability (Antony 1991), physical\nimplementation (Marras 2003), and grounding (Kroedel and Schulz 2016). \n\nYou might ask why any of these relations should secure the desired\nsolution. One thought is that if mental properties are immanent in\ntheir physical realizers, the causal powers of a mental property\nare included among those of its realizer. Consider again\nmental property M and one of its realizers in a given\ninstance, P. Plausibly, M’s powers are\nincluded in P’s. Both properties, for example, have the\npower to cause a certain kind of behavior, but because of its greater\n“specificity”, P has in addition to this powers\nthat M lacks. Now in general we don’t think that wholes\ncausally compete with, or are excluded by, their parts. When Gus steps\non Lilian’s toe, his foot’s causing Lilian discomfort\ndoesn’t exclude Gus’s causing her discomfort. Both Gus and\nhis foot coexist as causes, without competition and, we might add,\nwithout overdetermination. A similar point could be made about\nproperties: if the causal powers of M are included in those\nbestowed by P, then P’s causal relevance to\nbehavior, far from excluding M’s, includes\nit. (Approaches along these lines have been developed in Antony 1999; Shoemaker 2001; Wilson 1999, 2011; Clapp 2001; critical discussions include Heil 1999, 2011; McLaughlin 2007; Kim 2010; Ney 2010; Audi 2012.) \n\nAutonomy and inheritance solutions grant at least this much to the\nExclusion Problem: mental and physical properties are numerically\ndistinct, however intimately they are otherwise related. But a third\nsort of strategy tries to undermine the argument at exactly this\npoint: any mental property just is its physical realizer. If\nM=P, there’s no question of one’s excluding the \nother, nor is there any mystery of how M can work through \nP, for M and P are one and the same. \n\nThis sort of psychophysical property identity would seem to be blocked\nby the multiple realizability argument sketched earlier. But that\nargument, in spite of its wide appeal, has come under attack from\nseveral directions (see\n multiple realizability,\n §2). For example, some (Kim 1992; Lewis 1994; Jackson 1995; Heil 2003) take the argument to show, not that\nmental properties are distinct from their physical realizers, but that\nwhat we thought was one kind of mental property is actually\nmany. Pains realized by different physical properties, in spite of\nhaving the same name (“pain”), are different,\nthough similar, mental properties. There is no such property as pain\nsimpliciter, only pain-for-this-physical-structure and\npain-for-that-physical structure. Once such\n“structure-specific” identities are allowed, we can say\nthat M (now just, say, pain-for-human beings) is identical\nwith P, M’s “realizer” in human\nbeings (replies include Fodor 1997; Block 1997; Marras 2003; Moore and Campbell 2010). \n\nThis solution comes at a price: it forces us to abandon the belief\nthat pain is a single, natural kind. There is, however, a way to\npreserve this doctrine while pursuing a strategy that’s\notherwise similar to the one just sketched. The essential idea is that\n“property” as we’ve used the term so far is\nambiguous. A property could be what characterizes an object (event),\nor what unifies several objects as a “one across\nmany”. Now suppose the characterizing properties are\n tropes:\n particularized properties, unique to each object. And suppose the \nunifying properties are something else—call these \n“types”. If the mental “properties” that \nare causally relevant to behavior are tropes, and the mental \n“properties” mentioned in the multiple realizability\nargument are types, there’s no reason to think that this\nargument rules out psychophysical property-identities in any way that\nleads to exclusion worries. The M-trope and\nthe P-trope are one and the same trope falling under two\ntypes, mental and physical.  This proposal allows for a\nsingle type pain shared by diverse creatures; it’s just\nthat this type is not the same sort of entity (a trope) that’s\nefficacious in the production of behavior (Heil 1992; Robb 1997; Heil and Robb 2003; what appears to be a similar view is defended by Macdonald and Macdonald 1986, 1995a; see also Whittle 2007.) \n\nOne worry about this proposal is that it appears to raise the\nExclusion Problem all over again, this time at the level of properties\n(tropes). If a single property is both mental and\nphysical, Completeness and No Overdetermination\nforce us to say that it’s efficacious only qua\nphysical, not qua mental. (For this and other criticisms, see\nNoordhof 1998; Raymont 2001; Gibb 2004; Macdonald and Macdonald 2006;\nAlward 2008; Maurin 2008; see Robb 2013 for some replies.) \n\nFunctionalism, along with any non-reductive theory of mind, faces the\nproblem just discussed. But even if exclusionary worries are finessed,\nfunctionalism faces an additional and possibly more fundamental\nproblem. \n\nAs we noted earlier, functionalism characterizes states of mind\ncausally. To be in a given mental state is to be in a state with the\nright sort of causal profile, a state bearing the right sorts of\nrelation to other states. Think of functional states as nodes in a\nnetwork of states, the identity of which depends on the relations they\nbear to other nodes, and think of the realizers as occupants of these\nnodes. All there is to a node is the potential causal\nrelations it bears to other nodes (not so for the occupants, which\nhave intrinsic properties). Suppose, then, that F\nand G are functional properties—nodes in this\nnetwork—and that all there is to something’s\nbeing F is its being a G-causer. The resulting\ngeneralization, “Fs cause Gs”, is no\ndoubt true, but it is vacuous, equivalent to the generalization\nthat G-causers cause Gs. \n\nThis appears to strip functional properties of their causal\nefficacy. Why? One line of thought appeals to Hume’s celebrated\ndoctrine that there can be no necessary connections between distinct\nexistences. A mental property and its would-be effect are distinct,\nyet functionalism entails that they enjoy a necessary connection. On\nthe Humean doctrine, such a connection could not be causal. Another,\nclosely related, version of the problem requires that causal relations\nbe subsumed by empirical laws. But there are no such laws available\nfor functional properties if all of the relevant generalizations are\nanalytic and vacuous. (The foregoing argument in either version\nthreatens to generalize to all dispositional properties:\nsee  dispositions, §6. For the\nproblem aimed at functionalism in particular, see Block 1990; Rupert\n2006; functionalism, §5.2.) \n\nThis argument echoes the logical connection argument advanced in the 1950’s and 60’s against causal accounts of action (e.g., Melden 1961, pp. 52–3). Given that reasons (desires, intentions) are not logically distinct from the actions they rationalize, reasons could not cause actions. In\nresponse, Davidson (1963) noted that logical connections hold among\npredicates or descriptions of events, not among events themselves. A\ncause could be described in various ways, some of which will involve\nthe effect: consider “the cause of the fire caused the\nfire”. This is hardly informative, but it’s not thereby false. And of course the statement, far from precluding a causal relation,\nexplicitly asserts it. That said, if the claim is true, it should be possible\nto identify the cause of the fire independently of reference to the\neffect—as “the match’s igniting”, for\ninstance. In defense of his own causal theory of action, Davidson\nargued that such a re-description of mental causes is always\navailable, at least in principle (see §5.1). \n\nBut Davidson’s saving move appears not to be available for the\nfunctionalist, for in the case of functional states and properties, no\nsuch independent descriptions are available, as the nature of a\nfunctional property is exhausted by its place in the causal\nnetwork. \n\nThe functionalist has a number of options available, some of them\nmirroring solutions to the Exclusion Problem (Rupert 2006 provides a\ncritical survey). For example, a functionalist could settle for a\nweaker, explanatory role for functional properties, leaving causal\nefficacy to the realizers of functional states (§6.4; see, e.g.,\nSegal 2009; compare Roth and Cummins 2014). Or a functionalist might identify\nstates of mind with their realizers (§6.5); indeed, some of the\nearly functionalists were identity theorists (Lewis 1966, 1994; Armstrong\n1968/1993). This would permit the sort of re-description that the more\nmainstream version of functionalism apparently blocks. A third option\nis to look for non-vacuous, empirical generalizations subsuming\nfunctional properties (Antony and Levine 1997). Yet a fourth option\nrejects the Humean doctrine, permitting necessary connections between\na causally efficacious property and its effect. Such a proposal would\nfind a home in the more general “causal theory of\nproperties” defended by Shoemaker (1980, 1998) and others. \n\nOur final version of the property-based problem is restricted to\nintentional mental properties, that is, properties in virtue of which\nsome mental states—propositional attitudes, perceptual\nexperiences, mental images, and so on—are about\nsomething, properties in virtue of which mental states have\nrepresentational content. We assume here\nthat externalism is true, so\nthat the contents of representational states of mind depend, not\nmerely on intrinsic features of those states, but on relations, in\nparticular, on the causal, social, and historical relations agents\nbear to their surroundings. In the simplest case, Lilian is thinking\nabout water (H2O) because she stands in the right\nsorts of causal relation to water. The key move here is to reject the\nidea that meaningful objects or states owe their meaning to their\nintrinsic make-up alone. \n\nThe causally problematic feature for externalism is this contextual or\nrelational component of representational mental states. Suppose that\nour mental representations are physical structures in the brain. Now\nsuppose with the externalist that the content of these representations\nis determined, not just by our intrinsic features, but by context as\nwell. Lilian (or Lilian’s brain) represents a tree in the quad\nby going into state T. But T represents a tree in the quad, not by virtue\nof T’s (or, for that matter, Lilian’s) intrinsic\nmakeup, but by virtue of\nT’s (and by extension Lilian’s) standing in the right kind \nof relation to the tree. The very same kind of state in a different \ncontext (in the brain of someone in different circumstances) might \nrepresent something very different—or nothing at all. \n\nNow if the content of Lilian’s thought that there is a tree in\nthe quad is “broad”, if the significance of her thought\ndepends on factors outside Lilian’s body, then it is indeed hard\nto see how this content could figure in a causal account of her\nactions, including Lilian’s expressing her belief that there is\na tree in the quad by uttering the sentence, “There is a tree in\nthe quad”. This is bad news for any attempt to explain why we do\nwhat we do by reference to the contents of our thoughts. \n\nConsider an analogy (Dretske 1998). Gus inserts a quarter into a vending machine. The\ncoin has a range of intrinsic qualities common to quarters, but its\nbeing a quarter does not depend solely on these intrinsic qualities: a\nquarter’s intrinsic qualities would be shared by a decent\ncounterfeit. The coin’s being a quarter depends on its having\nthe right sort of history: it was produced in a United States\nmint. This is something the vending machine cares nothing about. The\nmachine reacts only to the coin’s intrinsic features. You might\nput this by saying that the coin affects the machine, not qua\nquarter, but only qua possessor of a particular kind of\nintrinsic makeup. (Vending machines are built to take advantage of the\ncontingent fact that objects with this intrinsic makeup are almost\nalways quarters.) \n\nThe worry is that we apparently operate, in important respects, as\nvending machines do. We respond to incoming stimuli solely in virtue\nof our intrinsic makeup and the intrinsic character of the\nstimuli. But if our thoughts possess their content in virtue of our\nstanding in complicated environmental–social–historical\nrelations to our surroundings, it is hard to see how such contents\ncould make a causal difference in our psychological economy, how they\ncould figure in the production of behavior. Thoughts have\ncontents, but these contents could have no direct influence on the\noperation of mental mechanisms (Stich 1978; Kim 1982; Fodor 1980,\n1987, ch. 2, 1991; Jackson and Pettit 1988). \n\nOne general line of response notes that whenever we explain a bit of\nbehavior by appeal to extrinsic content, there is a local, intrinsic\nproperty available as a “causal surrogate” to produce the\nbehavior (Crane and Mellor 1990). Such a surrogate may be\nneurophysiological or, as\non computationalist views, a\ncomplex of “formal” or “syntactic” properties\nof internal representations. Now by itself, this point seems just to\nhighlight the problem: if intrinsic surrogates are always needed, all\nthe more reason to reject the efficacy of content. Some have indeed\ndrawn such a lesson, concluding either that content has no role to\nplay in an explanatory psychology (Stich 1978, 1983), or perhaps that\npsychological explanations appealing to content were never causal to\nbegin with (Owens 1993; see also the noncausalists cited in\n§1.1). \n\nBut this might be too hasty. Far from precluding the causal efficacy\nof content, the surrogates might in fact play a role in ensuring\nit. Note that while Lilian’s intrinsic properties don’t\nguarantee the contents of her beliefs, her intrinsic properties are,\nin her environment, reliably correlated with these contents—so\nreliably, in fact, that content, in spite of being extrinsic, enters\ninto the counterfactuals or laws often thought to\nground causal efficacy. It seems clear, after all, that if Lilian had\nnot believed there was water in front of her, she would not have\nextended her hand. This counterfactual could be secured by the fact\nthat Lilian’s believing “There’s water in front of\nme” covaries with some internal state of her brain, but the\ncounterfactual, for all that, is still true. A similar point could be\nmade using (hedged) laws connecting content with behavior. The terrain\nhere in any case is similar to that explored earlier in\n§§5.3–4, though the extrinsic nature of content\nintroduces its own complexities. (On the counterfactuals, see Mele 1992, ch. 2; Yablo 1997; on the laws, see Braun 1991; Fodor 1995.) \n\nThere’s a more direct way that the intrinsic surrogates might secure\nthe efficacy of content: perhaps the surrogate properties are\ncontent, or rather a kind of\ncontent. Distinguish narrow from broad\ncontent. Think of narrow content as the content of a representational\nstate of mind minus its “broad” components. Consider\nLilian (or Lilian’s brain) and an intrinsically indiscernible brain in\na vat wired to a supercomputer. Grant that Lilian and the envatted\nbrain entertain intrinsically indiscernible thoughts with utterly\ndifferent representational contents. Now imagine that we could\nabstract a common element from the contents of Lilian’s and the\nbrain’s intrinsically indiscernible thoughts. This element is their\nnarrow content. Because narrow content is something all intrinsic\nduplicates must have in common, the hope is that such content could be\nthe very intrinsic properties that produce behavior. \n\nThe notion of narrow content might raise suspicion, however. Return to\nthe vending machine. The quarter Gus inserts in the machine has a\nparticular value owing to relations it bears to outside goings-on: it\nwas minted in the Denver mint. A counterfeit placed in the machine\ncould have the very same intrinsic makeup as the quarter, but it would\nlack the quarter’s value. It looks as though it is the\nquarter’s intrinsic makeup, not its value, that matters to the\noperation of the machine. Now imagine someone arguing that a quarter\nand an intrinsically indiscernible slug do in fact share a kind of\nvalue: narrow value. Because narrow value accompanies an\nobject’s intrinsic qualities, we need not regard narrow value as\nepiphenomenal. But what could narrow value be?  Whatever it is, could\nit in any way resemble value ordinarily conceived—broad\nvalue? Narrow value looks like a phony category posited ad\nhoc to accommodate an otherwise embarrassing\ndifficulty. Nevertheless, some philosophers remain optimistic about\nthe prospects of a viable internalist account of content, one\nthat would allow fully fledged thoughts to have a role in the\nproduction of behavior. (For references and further discussion,\nsee narrow mental content.) \n\nAnother, much different, attempt to preserve a causal role for content\ncan be found in Dretske 1988, 1989, 1993. So far we’ve assumed\nthat a behavioral event is distinct from the mental event that causes\nit. On Dretske’s view, however, behavior is a process\nthat includes, as a component, its mental cause. When mental\nevent a causes bodily movement\nb, the behavior in this case is not b itself, but \nthe process of a’s causing b. When Lilian raises her hand \nbecause she wants to get the teacher’s attention and she believes \nthat raising her hand will accomplish this end, her behavior is not \nher hand’s going up, but the process of this belief-desire pair’s \ncausing her hand to go up. \n\nDretske grants that when mental event a initiates\n(“triggers”) a process ending in bodily\nmovement b,\na does so solely in virtue of its intrinsic makeup. \nNevertheless, a’s relational, intentional properties have a \ncausal role, for they can be relevant to the fact that a causes \nb. Reasons are “structuring causes” of behavior: it’s because of\nwhat a indicates that it was “recruited” during the learning\nprocess as a cause of b. (Indication here is a matter of \nreliable co-variation.) It’s because, for example, Lilian’s belief \nindicates what it does—raising one’s hand (in these \ncircumstances) is a way to get the teacher’s attention—that it \nwas (together with the relevant desire) recruited as a cause of her \nhand-raising. Relational, intentional mental properties thus become \ncausally relevant to behavior, because they are relevant to \nstructuring the very causal processes that, on Dretske’s view, \nconstitute instances of behavior. \n\nDretske’s proposed solution quickly produced a number of\nresponses (e.g., Smith 1990; Block 1990; Baker 1991; Horgan 1991; Kim 1991; Mele\n1991). One question is whether relational, intentional properties\nin fact play a causal role in the structuring (or\n“wiring”) of causal processes in the brain. Even during the learning process, the states of Lilian’s brain would seem to\nbe sensitive only to local, intrinsic features of one another,\nfeatures that screen off external goings-on.  Dretske might be\nable to avoid such screening-off by appealing to the counterfactual\ndependence of behavior-structuring on these goings-on.  His view would\nthen stand or fall with the success of counterfactual theories of\ncausal relevance (§5.3). A second question is whether intentional\nstates, even if they were relevant in the way Dretske says they are,\ndeliver the kind of causal relevance we want. When Lilian\nraises her hand, the structuring of the relevant processes in her\nbrain has already occurred. If intentional properties are relevant at\nall, then, they are apparently relevant only to what happened in the\npast during the learning process. But we normally regard mental\nproperties as causally relevant to what’s going on here and now,\nthe very time when Lilian (or anyone) acts (but cf. Allen 1995; Dretske replies to critics in his 1991, esp. pp. 210-7). \n\nDretske’s proposal is a version of the dual explanandum\nstrategy (§6.3). The idea is that physical and mental properties\nare causally responsible for different effects.  For Dretske, the\n(triggering) physical properties are responsible for bodily motions,\nwhile the (structuring) mental properties are responsible for\nbehavior. \n\nAnother version of this strategy begins with a point also made in\n§6.3, namely that to question a property’s causal relevance\nis really to question its relevance to some property of the\neffect. The form of our central causal question, that is, is whether a\nmental cause qua F causes a behavioral effect\nqua G. Now when F is an intentional mental\nproperty, what G is the object of our question? One \npossibility is that it is a behavioral property that, like the mental\nproperty, is itself “broad” (see, e.g., Enc 1995). \n\nConsider a simple example: Suppose Lilian believes that a glass in\nfront of her contains water, and this belief (together with her\ndesires) causes her to reach for the glass. Her behavior is an\ninstance of trying to get water, and it’s the\ninstantiation of this property (and not, say, the property of\nbeing a certain kind of bodily motion) that we’re wondering\nabout when we ask whether the intentional property of her belief is\ncausally relevant.  (If our interest lay solely in explaining a\nparticular bodily motion, we would rest content with a\nnon-psychological, purely physiological explanation.) But now the\nanswer seems straightforward. For what makes Lilian’s\nbehavior a trying for water is that it’s caused by a\nbelief whose content concerns water. Once we realize that the\nbehavioral property of the effect is itself broad, its connection to\nthe intentional mental property seems clear. \n\nThis is not to say that the physical properties of Lilian’s\nbelief do no work: it’s just that they are responsible for a different\nproperty of the effect, for instance, the property of being a forward\narm-movement. The intentional properties of her belief are relevant to\nthe effect qua (broad) behavior; the physical properties are\nrelevant to the effect qua (narrow) bodily motion. And as we\nnoted earlier (§6.3), such a solution can be employed in response\nto the Exclusion Problem as well. If a mental property and its\nphysical realizer are relevant to different properties of the effect,\nthey need not compete causally. \n\nBecause it promises to solve two outstanding problems of mental\ncausation, this approach is potentially quite powerful. (For\ndiscussion, see Fodor 1991; Burge 1995.) One question to raise here,\nhowever, is whether the fact that some behavior can be described\nbroadly makes the intentional mental property of its cause relevant.\nThe undeniable conceptual connections between mental and behavioral\ndescriptions might point to a kind of explanatory relevance,\nbut it’s a further question whether causal connections grounding\nthese explanations involve broad properties. Those motivated by the\noriginal epiphenomenalist arguments will worry that narrow, physical\nproperties are really doing all the work here: the apparent relevance\nof the broad properties is an illusion created by the way we, in\ndescribing and explaining behavior, conceptualize both cause and\neffect (see Owens 1993). This point leads to a fourth, related\nresponse to the problem. \n\nSome theorists would challenge the distinction—implicit in the\nforegoing discussion—between explanation and causation. Our\nconcept of causality, they would insist, is bound up with the\nconcept of explanation: causally relevant properties are those that\nfigure in our best causal explanations (Segal and Sober 1991; Wilson\n1992; Burge 1993; Raymont 2001; §6.3). We find out what causal\nrelations amount to by starting with clear cases of causal\nexplanation. Given that we (and the cognitive scientists) routinely\nexplain physical events by citing mental causes (and mental events by\ninvoking physical causes), questioning whether real causal\nrelations answer to these explanations is to succumb to the kind of\nmetaphysical hubris that gives metaphysics a bad name. \n\nThis appeal to explanatory practice has the potential to answer in one\nfell swoop all four of the property-based problems we’ve\nconsidered. \n\nDoubtless our understanding of the notions of causality and causal\nrelevance depends importantly on our grasp of causal explanations.\nBut there are at least two areas of concern about the explanatory\nstrategy (compare Kim 1998, pp. 60–7). First, you might wonder\nwhether the strategy addresses the right question. Earlier,\nwe pointed out that the central question of mental causation is not so\nmuch whether mental properties are causally relevant but\nhow they could be, given some alleged feature of mental \nproperties (in the case at issue here, the feature is their being \nrelational properties). The explanatory strategy would at best seem \nto be addressing only the “whether” question, not the “how” question.\nSecond, even when restricted to the “whether” question, the strategy \nrests on a conflation of what appears to be an epistemological notion\n(explanation) with metaphysical notions (causation and causal \nrelevance). A full evaluation of the view would thus require a deeper\nlook into how the two are related. \n\nWe have been treating the problem of mental causation as though it\nwere a problem in applied metaphysics. Perhaps this approach is\nwrong-headed. Perhaps the problem really falls under the purview of\nthe philosophy of science. What if we began with a look at actual\nscientific practice (as suggested in §§6.3, 7.5) and\ndetermined what exactly science requires for acceptable causal\nexplanation? An examination of established special sciences reveals\nthat the very features (multiple realizability, higher-level and\n“broad” properties, for instance) metaphysically inclined\nphilosophers regard as posing apparently insuperable difficulties for\nmental causation, are routinely invoked in causal explanations in\nthose sciences. This suggests that, rather than let a priori\nconceptions of causation (or properties, or causal powers) lead us to\nregard mental causation with suspicion, we should reason in the other\ndirection: revise our conception of causation to fit our actual\nscientific beliefs and practices. If the metaphysicians were right\nabout causation, no science would be possible beyond basic physics\n(biological properties, for instance, would lack causal efficacy). \n\nThis is one way to go. Another way is to take a step backward and ask\nwhich features of our conception of the mental, features we commonly\ntake for granted, might be the source of our difficulties.\nEliminativists aside, all parties evidently agree that “realism\nabout the mental” requires that mental predicates figuring in\ncausal accounts of behavior designate distinctively mental\nproperties. If we aim to honor psychology (and the other special\nsciences), our job is to show how these properties could be causally\nrelevant to physical goings-on. Suppose, in contrast, that you took\nthe goal to be, not the preservation of mental properties,\nbut the preservation of mental truths. In that case we would\nseek an account of the mind that provides plausible truthmakers for\npsychological and psycho-physical claims, including claims concerning\nmental causation. \n\nOne possibility is that truthmakers for psychological truths include\nirreducibly mental properties. This is not the only possibility,\nhowever. Another is that psychological assertions are made true by\nphysical states and properties, states and properties answering to\npredicates belonging to physics and chemistry. A view of this kind\n(which is close to Davidson’s as spelled out in §5 and to\nthe identity solutions discussed in §6.5) would endeavor to\nresolve the problem of mental causation, not by tinkering with the\ncausal concept, but by rejecting the idea that mental and physical\nproperties are distinct kinds of property. All parties agree that\nmental predicates and descriptions differ from physical predicates and\ndescriptions. Application conditions for mental terms and physical\nterms diverge in ways that preclude definitional reduction of the one\nto the other. Perhaps it is a mistake, however, to move from this\nlinguistic fact to a substantive ontological thesis: mental and\nphysical predicates designate properties belonging to distinct\nfamilies of properties. \n\nWhether anything like this could be made to work is an open question.\nTo the extent that you regard the current state of play as \nunsatisfying, however, it is perhaps a question worth pursuing.","contact.mail":"jh@wustl.edu","contact.domain":"wustl.edu"}]
