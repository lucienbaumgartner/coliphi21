There are at least three important observations to make about\nthese claims.  First, it seems that they aren't identity\nclaims. Russell's claim seems to be that, while a complex and the\nsimples that compose it are distinct, we can explain the existence of\nthe former in terms of the existence of the latter. Second, it seems\nthat these claims aren't causal in nature. Kripke's claim isn't that\ncausal facts themselves cause our words to refer to what they do.\nInstead, the idea is that certain causal facts non-causally determine\nthe facts about what words refer to. Third, it seems that these claims\naren't purely modal in nature. The relations of modal entailment,\nsupervenience, and the like are too coarse-grained to capture what\nPlato has in mind. It's necessary that if something is pious, then\nit's lovable by the gods. But it's also necessary that if something is\npious, then \\(2+3=5\\). Plato, however, would presumably deny that\nanything is such that \\(2+3=5\\) in virtue of the fact that it's\npious.\n\nIt seems that we make similar claims in everyday life as well as in\nthe context of philosophy. Suppose you claim that there is a labor\nstrike due to the fact that the truck drivers are refusing to\nwork and instead picketing outside their workplace. In making this\nclaim, you're not saying that for there to be a labor strike just is\nfor there to be truck drivers who are engaging in these particular\nactivities, for strikes can involve workers with different\noccupations, and there are different ways of striking (e.g., workers\nmight go to work but carefully follow all safety regulations so as to\nimpede their productivity). Nor are you claiming that the activity of\nthe truck drivers concurrent with the strike causes there to be a\nstrike. A causal explanation of the strike instead would appeal to\ncertain antecedent events such as how their employer has allotted\npayroll deductions and benefits. Finally, you aren't merely claiming\nthat there is a necessary connection between the concurrent activity\nof the truck drivers and the existence of a labor strike. Instead,\nyou're claiming that the fact that they're refusing to work and\npicketing outside their workplace explains why there is a strike in\nsome metaphysically significant sense. \n\nTaking such considerations as a point of departure, some suggest\nthat claims like those described above should be read\nas grounding claims—claims about what grounds what. We\nbegin by addressing five foundational issues about grounding: (i)\nwhether grounding is unitary, (ii) whether we can analyze the concept\nof grounding, (iii) the logical form of grounding statements, (iv) how\ngrounding is related to explanation, and (v) how it's related to\nnecessity. Then we turn to the application of the notion of grounding.\nIn particular, we address how the notion might allow us to profitably\nformulate familiar philosophical theses, as well as construct novel\nphilosophical accounts. We conclude by discussing two further issues,\nnamely, whether the facts concerning what grounds what themselves have\ngrounds and skepticism about grounding.\n\nIs grounding unitary in the sense that there is a single dependence\nrelation in play in claims like those discussed above? Proponents of\ngrounding tend to claim that grounding is unitary (Audi 2012; Rosen\n2010; Schaffer 2009). They claim that, just as our default position\nwith respect to synchronic identity, causation, parthood, and the like\nis that they're unitary, the same is true of grounding. Grounding naysayers tend to claim that grounding isn't\nunitary. Instead, they claim that grounding is variegated in the sense\nthat claims like those described above traffic in importantly\ndifferent relations (Daly 2012; Hofweber 2009; Koslicki forthcoming;\nWilson 2014). (For more on skepticism about\ngrounding, see §8.)  But some proponents\nof grounding also claim that grounding is variegated. One such\npro-grounding view is this: grounding is akin to a disjunction of\nspecial determination relations, and those who think that grounding is\nunitary have merely singled out a dependence relation that is of\nparticular relevance to metaphysics, that of metaphysical\ngrounding (Fine 2012). The thought is that, in addition to\nmetaphysical grounding, there is, for example, the relation\nof natural grounding that is of particular interest to\nscience and the relation of normative grounding that is of\nparticular interest to ethics. On this view, the topic of this entry\nisn't grounding per se but metaphysical\ngrounding. (Henceforth, when we speak of Fine's views on grounding, we\nmean his views of metaphysical grounding in particular.)  It's also possible that there is a sense in which grounding is both\nunitary and variegated. How so? It may be that there is an important\ncoarse-grained relation—the relation of grounding tout\ncourt—along with various fine-grained grounding\nrelations. Turning to a familiar view of causation will help us get a\nhandle on one such approach to grounding. Some claim that there are various distinctive physical mechanisms\nor spatiotemporally contiguous processes—what we might call\nfine-grained causal relations—that are responsible for events,\nand causation tout court is the distinctive physical relation\nthat unifies the fine-grained causal relations (Salmon 1984; Dowe\n2000). The idea is that we have an important coarse-grained\nrelation—the relation of causation tout\ncourt—that's a genus, and there are various fine-grained\nrelations—fine-grained causal relations—that are species\nrelative to this genus. Similarly, you might claim that there is a coarse-grained\nrelation—the relation of grounding tout court—and\nthat there are various metaphysical relations—the relations of\ngrounding1, grounding2, and so on—that are\nspecies relative to this genus. In this case, the notion of\ngrounding1 is analyzable as ‘grounding +\ndifferentia1’, the notion of grounding2 as\n‘grounding + differentia2’, and so\non. Relations akin to (some of) what Bennett (2011a) calls\n‘building’ relations and (some of) what Wilson calls\n(2014) ‘small-g’ grounding relations are natural\ncandidates for being the relevant metaphysical relations. Consider,\nfor example, the relation of material constitution—the\nmetaphysical relation that a lump of clay bears to the statue that's\ncoincident with it. If grounding1 is a relation akin to\nmaterial constitution then perhaps differentia1 concerns\nspatial coincidence. Or consider the realization relation—the\nmetaphysical relation that DNA molecules bear to genes. If\ngrounding2 is a relation akin to realization then perhaps\ndifferentia2 concerns role properties (e.g., the gene role)\nand their corresponding role fillers (e.g., DNA molecules). If it turns out that we can't specify the right sort of differentia\nfor these relations, another proposal according to which grounding is\nboth unitary and variegated worth considering is this:\ngrounding tout court is a determinable, and the various\nfine-grained grounding relations are determinates of this\ndeterminable.  The same considerations apply, mutatis\nmutandis, to causation.  (Koslicki forthcoming and \nWilson 2014 criticize these approaches to\ngrounding—see §8.)   General statements about a concept help us orient ourselves with\nregard to that concept. Such general statements might specify\napplication conditions for the concept, how it relates to other\nnotions, and so on. If the general conception of grounding just\narticulated is correct, then a substantive orienting characterization\nof grounding is as follows: grounding tout court is the\ncoarse-grained metaphysical relation that unifies various metaphysical\nrelations. But can we do more than offer orienting characterizations\nof grounding? In particular, can we analyze the concept? Some proponents of grounding offer analyses of the notion. Bricker\n(2006), for example, suggests the following partial analysis:\ngrounding is a relation between propositions, and one proposition\ngrounds another if the former is fundamental in nature and\nthe latter supervenes on the\nformer. (See §3 for more on the\nrelata of grounding, and §6.2 for more on\nthe notion of fundamentality).  Correia (2013) considers the prospects\nof various analyses in terms of the notion of essence. The basic idea\nthat runs through his suggested analyses is this: there are essential\ntruths about the grounded connecting them to their\ngrounds. (See §5\nand 7 for more on essential truths\nand grounding.) The more or less received view among proponents of grounding,\nhowever, is that the concept isn't analyzable—the concept of\ngrounding is ultimately primitive in nature (Fine 2012;\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005; Rosen 2010; Schaffer 2009; Witmer et\nal. 2005).  Supposing that the concept is primitive, it's important to\nkeep in mind that this doesn't mean that talk of grounding is obscure,\nor that grounding claims are confused or unjustified. It seems that\nmany notions central to philosophy are unitary and unanalyzable\n(consider synchronic identity, for example), yet this leads few to\ndismiss them as obscure, confused, or unjustified. Assuming that grounding is unitary (we can remain neutral on how\ngrounding might be related to metaphysical relations like material\nconstitution and realization), what is the logical form of grounding\nstatements? While we've been speaking of the\ngrounding relation, some proponents of grounding wish to stay\nneutral on whether there are any properties or relations, so they,\nlikewise, wish to stay neutral on whether there is a grounding\nrelation. These philosophers prefer to regiment grounding talk with a\nnon-truth-functional sentential connective (Correia 2010; Fine 2001,\n2012). Here we can agree, for example, that you can vote because\nyou're a citizen and that this is a grounding claim, but in so doing\nwe aren't committed to the existence of propositions or facts (e.g.,\nthe proposition/fact that you can vote and the proposition/fact that\nyou're a citizen) or relations (the grounding relation that holds\nbetween these propositions/facts).  It's important to realize that the\nconnective view isn't the view that the relata of grounding are\nsentences—this would be to treat grounding expressions\nultimately as predicates introducing a relation that holds between\nsentences. But notice that it's open for the proponent of the\nconnective view to add that, non-ultimately speaking, we may well talk\nabout a relation of grounding, for we can define a relational\npredicate in terms of the non-truth functional sentential\nconnective. Some are more sanguine about relations and are happy to commit\nthemselves to the existence of a grounding relation. Such folks tend\nto regiment grounding talk with a relational predicate. If there is a\ndefault version of the predicate view, it's that the predicate\nexpresses a binary relation holding between facts (Audi 2012; Rosen\n2010). It seems that there are cases in which a single fact is\ngrounded in a plurality of facts (e.g., \\([p \\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) (the\nfact that \\(p \\mathbin{\\&} q\\)) is grounded in \\([p], [q]\\)), so we\ncan think of the logical form of grounding statements on the predicate\nview as follows: \\([p]\\) is grounded in \\(\\Delta\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is a\nplurality of facts. (See, however, Dasgupta 2014 for an argument that\nif grounding is a binary relation then it's plural in both positions.)\nNotice that a plurality can have a single member, so it's fine to\nspeak of one fact being grounded in another fact. For the purposes of\nthis entry we will assume that grounding is a relation between facts,\nthat the logical form of grounding statements is \\([p]\\) is grounded in\n\\(\\Delta\\), and that \\([p]\\) is grounded in \\(\\Delta\\) only if \\([p]\\) and the\n\\(\\Delta\\)s obtain (i.e., the grounding relation is factive). It's worth noting, however, that some advocates of the predicate\nview claim that the grounding predicate expresses a binary relation\nthat is category neutral in that its relata can come from multiple\nontological categories, and their categories needn't match (Cameron\n2008; Schaffer 2009). Those who embrace the restriction to facts may\ndo so on the basis of the grammar of explanatory claims.  It makes no\ngrammatical sense to say that an apple explains anything, whereas the\nfact that it's red might explain something (Sider 2012: Ch. 8). They\nmight also claim that their opponents, who claim that the relation is\ncategory neutral, aren't properly distinguishing between grounding\nproper and a relation of metaphysical dependence more broadly\nconstrued. Advocates of the neutral approach may respond by pointing\nout that explanatory claims have a variety of syntactic\nforms. ‘In virtue of’, for example, requires a sentence as\nits first argument and a sentence nominalization or a singular term\nderived from a sentence as its second. Moreover, some sympathetic with the predicate view suggest that the\ngrounding predicate expresses a quaternary relation. One view along\nthese lines is that the grounding relation includes two slots for\nfacts and two slots for modes of presentation of those facts\n(Jenkins 2011). Suppose that you're in pain, and the fact that you\nhave physical property P and the fact you're in pain are one\nand the same fact. You might think that this case poses the following\nproblem: what we've said so far seems compatible with the idea that\nthe fact that you have P grounds the fact you're in pain, yet\nat the same time it seems wrong to say that a fact can ground\nitself. (See §6.2 for more on whether\ngrounding is irreflexive in nature.) How might we resolve these\napparently inconsistent views? Well, notice that we can consider the\nfact in question under different modes of presentation (MOPs). We can\nconsider it under a non-experiential MOP—as a fact concerning a\nparticular neural property—as well as under an experiential\nMOP—as a fact concerning a particular feeling. You might claim\nthat when we say that the fact that you have P grounds the\nfact that you're in pain, we mean that the fact that you\nhave P, considered under a non-experiential MOP, grounds the\nfact that you have P, considered under an experiential\nMOP. But to say that the fact that you have P grounds itself\nis to make a different grounding claim—it's to claim that the\nfact that you have P, considered under a non-experiential\nMOP, grounds the fact that you have P, considered under the\nvery same MOP. You might claim that, while a grounding claim like the\nformer might be true, no grounding claim like the latter can be\ntrue—if the same fact occupies two of the argument places of the\ngrounding relation then different MOPs must occupy the remaining two\nargument places. (Notice that on a conceptualist view of facts,\naccording to which facts have modes of presentation as constituents,\nthis version of the quaternary view is really a special case of the\nthesis that the grounding relation is binary in nature.)\n  Another quaternary view is that grounding is contrastive in nature,\nso it includes two slots for facts and two slots\nfor contrasts of these facts (Schaffer 2012). Consider again\nthe claim that an act is lovable by the gods in virtue of its being\npious. The idea is that this grounding claim has implicit\ncontrasts. Depending on the context, the claim might be the following:\nthe fact that an act is pious rather than blasphemous grounds the fact\nthat it's lovable by the gods rather than hate-worthy. If you think\nthat grounding either is an explanatory relation or a non-explanatory\nexplanation-backing relation (see §4 for\nfurther discussion) then one reason to take the contrastive view of\ngrounding seriously is the fact explanation may itself be contrastive\nin nature (van Fraassen 1980: Ch. 5). Another reason to take the contrastive approach to grounding\nseriously is this: supposing that grounding is transitive\n(see §6.2), the approach may allow us to\ndeal with apparent failures of transitivity. Let \\(S = \\{a, b, c\\}\\).\nFollowing Schaffer (2012), it seems that (i) the fact that c\nis a member of S (partially) grounds the fact that S\nhas exactly three members, (ii) the fact that S has exactly\nthree members grounds the fact that S has finitely many\nmembers, yet (iii) the fact that c is a member\nof S doesn't ground the fact that S has\nfinitely many members. (See §5 for more on the\ndistinction between full and mere partial grounding.) Here we have an\napparent failure of transitivity. On the contrastive approach, we have\na violation of transitivity instead if the following claims are true:\n(iv) the fact that c is a member of S, rather than\nnot a member of S, (partially) grounds the fact\nthat S has exactly three members, rather than exactly two\nmembers, (v) the fact that S has exactly three members,\nrather than exactly two members, grounds the fact that S is\nfinite rather than infinite, yet (vi) the fact that c is a\nmember of S, rather than not a member\nof S, doesn't ground the fact that S is\nfinite, rather than infinite. As Schaffer points out, while (iv) and\n(vi) seem true, (v) seems false—the fact that S has\nthree members rather than two makes no difference to\nwhether S is finite or not, for it would be finite in either\ncase. Instead, it seems that (vii) the fact that S has\nexactly three members, rather than, say, as many members as there are\nnatural numbers, grounds the fact that S is finite, rather\nthan infinite. But the truth of (iv), (vi) and (vii) is compatible\nwith the transitivity of grounding on the contrastive conception. How might grounding and explanation be related? Proponents of\ngrounding claim that there is a tight connection between them. To\nbegin, note that a mark of explanation is hyperintensionality, and\ngrounding is apparently hyperintensional as well. Suppose that two sentences are intensionally\nequivalent—suppose that any metaphysically possible world in\nwhich the first is true is a world in which the second is true\nand vice versa. Notice that substituting one of these\nsentences for the other can turn true explanation statements into\nfalse ones. Consider the following sentences: (i) ‘Socrates\nexists’, (ii) ‘{Socrates} exists’, and (iii)\n‘{Socrates} exists because Socrates exists’. Suppose that\n(iii) is true. Although (i) and (ii) are intensionally equivalent,\nsubstituting (i) for (ii) and (ii) for (i) in (iii) yields the false\nsentence ‘Socrates exists because {Socrates} exists’. And\nit seems that grounding is hyperintensional in a corresponding\nsense. The fact that Socrates exists and the fact that {Socrates}\nexists are intensionally equivalent—any metaphysically possible\nworld in which the first obtains is a world in which the second\nobtains and vice versa. It seems that the fact that Socrates\nexists grounds the fact that {Socrates} exists.  Although the facts at\nissue here are intensionally equivalent, it's not the case that the\nfact that {Socrates} exists grounds the fact that Socrates\nexists.  While the notion of grounding is often introduced in explicitly\nexplanatory terms, there are two importantly different ways of\nmaintaining that there is a tight connection between grounding and\nexplanation. Let's suppose that an explanation is a list of facts\nwhere some of them bear an explanatory relation to the\nothers, and explanation, like grounding, is factive in the sense that\nif one fact explains another then both facts obtain. The first view is that there are multiple explanatory relations,\nand grounding is one of them. Fine writes, We take ground to be an explanatory\nrelation: if the truth that P is grounded in other truths,\nthen they account for its truth; P's being the case\nholds in virtue of the other truths' being the case. (2001:\n15; see also Dasgupta 2014 and Litland 2013) The relevant notion of explanation in this case\nis metaphysical in character, where what this is commonly taken to\nmean is that whether some facts bear an explanatory relation to others\ndoesn't depend on our explanatory interests or what we happen to\nunderstand (Strevens 2008: Ch. 1). Let a relation be a backing relation just in\ncase, instead of being an explanatory relation, it backs or\nunderwrites explanations. Backing relations are the worldly\ndetermination relations that explanations track or correspond to (Kim\n1994; Ruben 1990: Ch. 7).  The second view is that there are multiple\nbacking relations, and grounding is one of them. Audi writes, If we recognize [cases of non-causal explanation]\nand we agree that explanations require non-explanatory relations\nunderlying their correctness, then we are committed to recognizing a\nnon-causal relation at work in these explanations.\n (2012: 687–8) For Audi this non-causal relation is grounding (see also\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005 and Schaffer 2012). The relevant notion of\nexplanation in this case is either metaphysical or\nepistemic/communicative in character. In the latter case, whether a\nfact is a candidate explanans depends on our explanatory\ninterests and/or what we happen to understand, so whether some facts\nbear an explanatory relation to others depends in part on these\nfactors as well (van Fraassen 1980: Ch. 5). Another view is that grounding is neither an explanatory nor a\nbacking relation. According to Wilson, the idea that grounding claims\n(where grounding is understood as a distinctive coarse-grained\nmetaphysical relation) have distinctive explanatory import doesn't\nsurvive scrutiny: …from the bare fact that some goings-on are\n Grounded in some others it hardly follows that the latter\n metaphysically explain the former in any interesting sense; nor does\n a bare Grounding claim itself constitute an explanation in either a\n metaphysical or epistemic sense. (2014: 553) (This is part of Wilson's case for skepticism\n about grounding in\n general—see §8.) Now we turn to the matter of how the concept of grounding is\nrelated to another notion of obvious philosophical interest—that\nof necessity. Let \\(\\Delta\\) metaphysically necessitate \\([p]\\) just in\ncase any metaphysically possible world in which the \\(\\Delta\\)s obtain is\na world in which \\([p]\\) obtains. Proponents of grounding all agree that\ngrounding isn't a purely modal relation like metaphysical\nnecessitation.  Every world in which my socks exist is also a world in\nwhich \\(2+3=5\\), and yet we don't want to say that the fact that my\nsocks exist grounds the fact that \\(2+3=5\\). Still, there might be a tight connection between grounding and\nnecessity. Intuitively, there is a distinction between full and mere\npartial grounding. One way to illustrate the distinction is by way of\nthe following contrast: while, for some suitable \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), \\([p\n\\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) is merely partially grounded in \\([p]\\), \\([p \\vee\nq]\\) is fully grounded in \\([p]\\).  Let's say that full grounding carries\nmetaphysical necessity just in case if \\([p]\\) is fully grounded in\n\\(\\Delta\\) then \\(\\Delta\\) metaphysically necessitates \\([p]\\). We take it\nthat the default view among proponents of grounding is that full\ngrounding carries metaphysical necessity (Audi 2012; Dasgupta 2014;\ndeRosset 2010; Rosen 2010; Trogdon 2013). Some, however, reject this view (Chudnoff 2011; Dancy 2004: Ch. 3;\nLeuenberger 2014a; Schnieder 2006; Skiles 2014). Why think that\nfull grounding doesn't carry metaphysical necessity? There are various\ncases discussed in the literature—here is one to\nconsider. Suppose you reason as follows: (i) I promised to \\(f\\),\n(ii) my promise wasn't given under duress, (iii) I'm able to \\(f\\),\nso, (iv) I ought to \\(f\\). You might claim that (i) gives you a\nreason to commit the action, while (ii) and (iii), though not\nproviding reasons themselves, jointly enable (i) to do so. Moral:\nwhile the fact that you promised to \\(f\\) fully grounds the fact\nthat you ought to \\(f\\), the fact that your promise wasn't given\nunder duress, the fact that you're able to \\(f\\), and additional\nrelevant facts, jointly enable the promise-fact to fully ground the\nobligation-fact. But the former doesn't metaphysically necessitate the\nlatter (Dancy 2004: Ch.  3). Proponents of the default view, however,\nwould presumably respond as follows: the fact that you promised\nto \\(f\\) does not, by itself, make it the case that you ought\nto \\(f\\), or explain why you ought to \\(f\\). It's not a full\nground. It may be a sufficient practical reason for \\(f\\)-ing, but that's\na separate matter. (For a discussion of the connection between\ngrounding and supervenience in contrast to metaphysical necessitation,\nsee Leuenberger 2014b.) Another important issue concerns what, if anything, grounds\nnecessities. There are at least two questions to consider here. The\nfirst is this: if \\([p]\\) is a metaphysically necessary fact, what, if\nanything, grounds \\([p]\\)? You might think that if \\([p]\\) is\nmetaphysically necessary then nothing grounds \\([p]\\), for the\nmetaphysically necessary facts aren't apt for explanation in the sense\nof explanation relevant to grounding (or any sense at all, according\nto some).  Metaphysically contingent facts, by contrast, are apt for\nthis sort of explanation. While there may be such (contingent) facts\nthat lack grounds (e.g., facts concerning the fundamental physical\nmagnitudes), these are the sorts of facts that can have grounds but\nsimply happen not to (where ‘can’ is understood\nepistemically). There is reason to think, however, that metaphysically necessary\nfacts are apt for explanation in the sense of explanation relevant to\ngrounding. Consider, for example, the fact that \\(2+3=5\\). While this is\n(we will suppose) a metaphysically necessary fact, it seems that it's\napt for explanation in terms of facts about numbers, mathematical\nstructures, or the like. Indeed, we seem to be possessed of the\nresources to ground some amongst our necessities. Suppose that both\n\\([p]\\) and \\([q]\\) are metaphysically necessary facts, so \\([p\n\\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) is a metaphysically necessary fact as well. It\nseems that any conjunctive fact is grounded in the plurality\nconsisting of its conjuncts, so \\([p \\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) is grounded\nin \\([p]\\), \\([q]\\). The second question: if \\([p]\\) is a metaphysically necessary fact,\nwhat grounds the fact that \\([p]\\) is metaphysically necessary?\nReductive modal analyses—analysis of modal discourse in\nnon-modal terms—are naturally thought of as grounding theses in\nthe sense that they aim to provide grounds for such facts that don't\nthemselves appeal to modality. (For more on the role that grounding\nmight play in formulating philosophical accounts,\nsee §6.) For example, Fine's (1994) analysis\nof metaphysical necessity in terms of essence is naturally cast as a\ngrounding thesis: the fact that \\([p]\\) is metaphysically necessary is\ngrounded in essential facts—facts concerning the essences of\ncertain entities (Rosen 2010). According to Fine, the essential features of an entity tell\nus what the entity is, as opposed to how that entity\nis.  So you might claim that the essential facts themselves aren't apt\nfor explanation in the sense of explanation relevant to grounding\n(Dasgupta forthcoming). Matters here are complicated, though, once we\nconsider the notion of fundamentality.  If the fundamental facts (as\nsome have suggested) are just those facts that lack grounds, then if\nthe essential facts lack grounds then they're fundamental in\nnature. Suppose that it's an essential fact that if Obama exists then\nhe's human. You might think, however, that, whatever the fundamental\nfacts turn out to be, they won't include facts about Obama. If this is\nright, then either this fact about Obama isn't an essential fact, it\nhas grounds after all, or it's wrong to think that a fact is\nfundamental just in case it lacks grounds. One view is that the fundamental facts are contingent. Given that\nthe essential facts are metaphysically necessary, on this picture they\nwon't count as fundamental. This view, however, faces a\nproblem vis-à-vis metaphysical necessity. Suppose that the\nfundamental facts are contingent. And suppose that (i) \\([p]\\) is a\nfundamental fact, and (ii) \\([p]\\) grounds [\\([q]\\) is metaphysically\nnecessary]. Since the fundamental facts could have been otherwise,\nthere are metaphysically possible worlds in which \\([p]\\) doesn't\nobtain.  Presumably some of the worlds in which \\([p]\\) doesn't obtain\nare worlds in which the fact that it actually grounds—[\\([q]\\) is\nmetaphysically necessary]—doesn't obtain either. If there are\nworlds in which the latter doesn't obtain, there are worlds in which\n\\([q]\\) doesn't obtain. But if there are worlds in which \\([q]\\) doesn't\nobtain, \\([q]\\) isn't metaphysically necessary after\nall. (See §6.2 for further discussion of\ngrounding and fundamentality). In this section we discuss two potential applications of the notion\nof grounding in some detail and briefly describe two others.  How should we understand the debate between the dualist and the\nnon-reductive physicalist? We can start with the following intuitive\ncharacterization of non-reductive physicalism about the mental: while\nthe mental and the physical are distinct, they aren't on a\npar—the latter enjoys a special priority with respect to the\nformer. In what sense, however, might the physical be prior to the\nmental—what does priority come to here? A familiar idea is that\npriority in the relevant sense can be understood in terms of purely\nmodal notions such as metaphysical necessitation or supervenience.\nLet's say that property P metaphysically necessitates\nproperty Q just in case it's metaphysically necessary that\nif P is instantiated then Q is instantiated.\nProposal: the physical is prior to the mental in the relevant sense\njust in case (i) for any mental property M, if M is\ninstantiated, then there is some instantiated physical\nproperty P that metaphysically necessitates M, yet\n(ii) it's not the case that, for any physical property P,\nif P is instantiated, then there is some instantiated mental\nproperty M that metaphysically necessitates P.\n  Does this capture the relevant sense of priority? Well, consider a\nparallel thesis, what we'll call non-reductive phenomenalism about the\nmathematical. Here is an intuitive characterization of the thesis:\nwhile the mathematical and the mental are distinct, they aren't on a\npar—the latter enjoys a special priority with respect to the\nformer. Suppose that the notion of priority at issue here is the same\nnotion that is at issue in non-reductive physicalism about the\nmental. In this case, it's clear that few would accept non-reductive\nphenomenalism about the mathematical. But suppose that the relevant\nnotion of priority is to be understood in terms of metaphysical\nnecessitation in the way suggested above. So the mental is prior to\nthe mathematical in relevant sense just in case (i) for any\nmathematical property P, if P is instantiated, then\nthere is some instantiated mental property M such\nthat M metaphysically necessitates P, yet (ii) it's\nnot the case that, for any mental property M, if M\nis instantiated, then there is some instantiated mathematical\nproperty P such that P metaphysically\nnecessitates M.  The right hand side of this biconditional,\nhowever, is something that many would accept! The reason is simple:\nmany think that just which mathematical properties are instantiated is\na necessary matter.  (Example: it's metaphysically necessary that the\noperation of addition instantiates the property of being associative.)\nThis suggests that the notion of priority at issue in non-reductive\nphysicalism about the mental isn't to be understood in terms of\nmetaphysical necessitation in the manner suggested above.\n  There are various ways we might refine the purely modal take on\npriority described above to avoid this particular problem. We suspect,\nhowever, that with any purely modal characterization of non-reductive\nphysicalism we will encounter similar problems (Horgan 1993,\n2006). How else might we understand the relevant sense of priority,\nthen?  It's natural to turn to the notion of grounding in this case,\nas it isn't a purely modal notion (see §5). A\nfirst pass at a grounding-theoretic formulation of non-reductive\nphysicalism is this: the physical is prior to the mental in the sense\nthat (i) for any mental property M, if M is\ninstantiated, then there is some physical property P such\nthat the fact that M is instantiated is grounded in the fact\nthat P is instantiated, yet (ii) it's not the case that, for\nany physical property P, if P is instantiated, then\nthere is some mental property M such that the fact\nthat P is instantiated is grounded in the fact\nthat M is instantiated.  In this case we get the sort of\nasymmetry between non-reductive physicalism about the mental and\nnon-reductive phenomenalism about the mathematical that we want: the\nmental facts are plausibly grounded in physical facts, yet the\nmathematical facts aren't plausibly grounded in mental facts.\n  Wilson (forthcoming) objects to grounding formulations of\nnon-reductive physicalism, claiming that they leave many issues open\nrelevant to characterizing the dependence of the mental on the\nphysical, ones that any adequate formulation of the thesis must\naddress. She points out that, according to Fine (2001), applications\nof the notion of grounding have no realist or antirealist import. So,\non his conception of grounding, in claiming that certain physical\nfacts ground the mental facts we remain neutral on whether there\nreally are any mental facts in the first place. But surely any\nadequate formulation of non-reductive physicalism should take a stand\non whether there really are mental facts. Notice, however, that the proponent of grounding, while accepting\nmuch of what Fine says about grounding, is free to simply deny Fine's\nthesis about grounding claims lacking realist import—intuitively\nthe relata of the grounding relation (and any relation, for that\nmatter) are real. Moreover, there is a way of interpreting Fine's\nclaim where it doesn't count against grounding formulations of\nnon-reductive physicalism in any case. Fine claims that grounding talk\nis best regimented with a non-truth-functional sentential connective\n(see §2). With such a view, one can speak of facts grounding\nother facts, while ultimately staying neutral on whether there really\nare any facts to begin with.  So, for Fine, in claiming that certain\nphysical facts ground the mental facts, we remain neutral on whether\nthere really are any mental facts because in making grounding claims\nwe remain neutral on whether there are any facts whatsoever. And to\nformulate non-reductive physicalism in such a way that it remains\nneutral on the issue of whether facts should go into our ontology\nisn't unreasonable. (NB: Fine (2012) suggests that physicalism and\nrelated theses are properly formulated in terms of natural grounding\nrather than metaphysical grounding—see §1.)  It's a familiar idea that the world—understood as the fusion\nof all concrete entities—has an overarching layered\nstructure. Where a concrete fact is a fact concerning the existence\nand nature of concrete entities, let metaphysical foundationalism be\nthe thesis that every concrete fact is either fundamental or\nderivative with respect to fundamental concrete facts. According to\nthe grounding conception of metaphysical foundationalism, the notion\nof grounding plays an essential role in this thesis. In particular, we\nshould interpret the thesis as follows: every concrete fact either\nisn't grounded in concrete facts, or is grounded in concrete facts\nthat themselves aren't grounded in concrete facts. The general idea\nbehind this conception of metaphysical foundationalism is that\ngrounding is the relation by which the world is hierarchically\nstructured from fundamental facts to increasingly derivative facts.\nSome may see this application of the notion of grounding as the\nprimary theoretical role it's supposed to play. According to one version of metaphysical foundationalism on the\ngrounding conception—what we'll call monism—all concrete\nfacts that aren't grounded in such facts are global facts—facts\nconcerning the cosmos as a whole. According to another\nversion—what we'll call pluralism—all concrete facts that\naren't grounded in such facts concern proper parts of the world, say\npoint-sized particles or point-sized regions.  Monism and pluralism,\nso characterized, are variants of what Schaffer (2010a)\ncalls priority monism and pluralism, respectively.\nSchaffer's theses concern grounding relations between concrete\nobjects, while ours concern grounding relations between concrete\nfacts.  (See §3 for discussion of the\nview that the relata of grounding include entities in addition to\nfacts.) Contrast the monism/pluralism debate so understood—a\ndebate about what grounds what—with the debate concerning\nwhether there is only one concrete object or many. (See Horgan and\nPotrc 2008 for a defense of the claim that there is only one concrete\nobject.) What else can we say about the grounding conception of metaphysical\nfoundationalism? Well, the thesis is associated with the claim that\ngrounding is well-founded. As we will use the term, grounding\nis well-founded just in case any grounding chain—any chain of\nfacts in which \\([p]\\) is grounded in \\([q]\\), \\([q]\\) is grounded in \\([r]\\),\nand so on—terminates in facts that themselves lack\ngrounds. Schaffer (2010a) claims that grounding is well-founded in\nthis sense, while others such as Bliss (2013, 2014) and Rosen (2010)\nsuggest that there is nothing obviously wrong with grounding being\nnon-well-founded. Supposing that there are some grounding chains that fail to\nterminate in ungrounded facts, we can still maintain that every member\nof such a chain is grounded in facts that themselves lack grounds.\nConsider Euclidean space, which is comprised of points and regions\nthat include those points. Suppose that every region has a region as a\nproper part. And suppose that the existence facts concerning regions\nare grounded in the existence facts concerning their sub-regions, the\nexistence facts concerning sub-regions are grounded in the existence\nfacts concerning their sub-sub-regions, and so on, ad\ninfinitum. Hence, the fact that region R exists is a\nmember of a grounding chain that doesn't terminate in facts that lack\ngrounds. But suppose that the existence facts concerning regions\nare also grounded in the existence facts concerning points.\nSuppose, moreover, that the existence facts concerning points lack\ngrounds. Hence, while the fact that R exists is a member of a\ngrounding chain that doesn't terminate in facts that lack grounds,\nthis fact nonetheless is grounded in facts that themselves lack\ngrounds. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to all the other\nfacts that are links in the grounding chain in question.\n  Returning to the grounding conception of metaphysical\nfoundationalism, the thesis is compatible with the existence of\ngrounding chains of concrete facts that fail to terminate in concrete\nfacts that themselves aren't grounded in such facts. It allows for\nsuch chains, so long as each link itself is grounded in concrete facts\nthat aren't grounded in such facts (Cameron 2008). There is another important issue concerning the grounding\nconception of metaphysical foundationalism. It presupposes that\ngrounding imposes a strict partial ordering (SPO) on the entities in\nits domain: grounding is irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive. Some\nargue, however, that grounding isn't an SPO. Grounding naysayers may\nconclude from this that we should look to alternative grounding-free\nconceptual frameworks to explicate metaphysical foundationalism. Why\nthink, however, that grounding isn't, or doesn't induce, an SPO? We've\nalready seen one challenge to the transitivity of grounding understood\nas a binary relation (see §3). So\nlet's turn to challenges to the idea that grounding is irreflexive and\nasymmetric.  Three challenges to irreflexivity are as follows. First, Lowe\n(1998: 145) suggests that ‘self-explanatory states of\naffairs’ are epistemically possible, so a characterization of\ngrounding shouldn't rule this out. Historically, certain influential\nthinkers have thought that the fact that God exists, for example, is a\nself-explanatory state of affairs. Second, Fine (2010) and Krämer\n(2013) discuss various cases that seem to involve violations of\nirreflexivity. Here's a simple case similar to the more complicated\nones they discuss: consider the fact that some fact or other\nobtains. Call this second-order fact—the fact that some fact or\nother obtains—‘\\(F\\)’. Any fact that obtains is a\nfact that grounds \\(F\\). Since \\(F\\) is itself a fact that\nobtains, \\(F\\) grounds itself. Third, Paseau (2010) points out\nthat, on the assumption that the existence of any set is grounded in\nthe existence of its members, any self-membered set (e.g., \\(g =\n\\{g\\}\\)) is such that the fact that it exists grounds itself. (Standard\nset theory, however, does not admit self-membered sets.) A putative counterexample to the asymmetry of grounding that we\nadapt from Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005 is as follows: [this fact obtains]\nis grounded in [[this fact obtains] obtains] and vice\nversa. Putting the case in terms of propositions rather than\nfacts, such a case, in his view, is one ‘in which the truth of a\nproposition depends on its subject matter and vice versa’ (2005:\n22). Priest (2014: Ch. 11) presents a more humdrum challenge to the\nasymmetry of grounding: the fact that the North Pole exists is\npartially grounded in the fact that the South Pole exists and vice\nversa.  There are at least three points worth keeping in mind about the\ngrounding conception of metaphysical foundationalism. First, while\nthere are several objections to the idea that grounding is an SPO,\nit's by no means a settled matter that it isn't an SPO.  Litland\n(2013) and Raven (2013), for example, both offer various responses to\nsome of the challenges described above. Second, you might accept that\ngrounding isn't an SPO but claim that we can characterize a relation\nin terms of grounding that is an SPO. Supposing that grounding is\nnon-transitive, we can take the transitive closure of\ngrounding—grounding*—as the relation by which the world is\nhierarchically structured. Third, if grounding is indeed an SPO, it\nmay still be that the grounding conception of metaphysical\nfoundationalism is implausible for different reasons. See both\ndeRosset 2010 and Sider 2012: Ch. 8 for different sorts of objection\nto the idea that theses akin to metaphysical foundationalism are\nprofitably formulated in terms of grounding. What are some further potential applications of the notion of\ngrounding? We will consider two. First, consider the notion of\ntruthmaking. Intuitively, if a proposition is true, something makes it\ntrue. If this is right, then what is the relation between a true\nproposition and that which makes it true? What, in other words, is the\ntruthmaking relation? Some proponents of grounding claim that we can\nunderstand truthmaking in terms of grounding, and doing so helps us\nresolve longstanding problems regarding truthmaking, such as the\nproblem of negative existentials (Cameron forthcoming; Liggins 2012;\nSchaffer 2010b). One straightforward grounding-theoretic proposal is\nthis: x is a truthmaker for the proposition that p just in case\n[x exists] grounds \\([p]\\) (see Tahko 2013 for objections to this\nview). Second, some propose to analyze the notion of intrinsicality in\nterms of the notion of grounding. Let an object that doesn't coexist\nwith any contingent object wholly distinct from it be a lonely object,\nand let an object be accompanied just in case it isn't\nlonely. Following Langton and Lewis (1998), let a property P be independent\nof accompaniment just in case it's possible that there is a\nlonely P, a lonely non-P, an accompanied P,\nand an accompanied non-P. Putting aside indiscriminately\nessential properties (e.g., being self-identical), Witmer et\nal. (2005) propose the following: P is an intrinsic property\njust in case P is independent of accompaniment, and it's\nmetaphysically necessary that, for any property Q,\nif P is instantiated in virtue of Q, then Q\nis independent of accompaniment as well. Witmer (2014) goes on\nto propose a similar account of intrinsic properties, though one free\nof modal notions. And Rosen (2010) proposes an account of intrinsic\nproperties in terms of grounding that is free of modal notions as\nwell: P is intrinsic just in case it's metaphysically\nnecessary that, for any x and y, (i) if the fact\nthat x has P is grounded in some fact\ncontaining y as a constituent, y is a part\nof x, and (ii) if the fact that x lacks P\nis grounded in some fact containing y as a constituent,\nagain y is a part of x. (See Bader 2013 for more on\nwhy grounding may be relevant to intrinsicality, and Marshall\nforthcoming for objections to the idea that we can analyze\nintrinsicality in terms of grounding.) Further potential applications of grounding concern perceptual\nknowledge (Chudnoff 2011), temporal ontology (Baron 2014), and\nthe nature of mental content (Trogdon forthcoming). What, if anything, grounds the facts about what grounds what?\nSuppose again that the fact that the truck drivers are refusing to\nwork and instead picketing outside their workplace grounds the fact\nthat there is a labor strike. Call the former fact\n‘picket’, the latter fact\n ‘strike’, and the\nfact that picket grounds\n strike\n ‘ground’. What, if\nanything, grounds facts like\n ground, facts concerning what grounds\nwhat? Assuming that every fact is either grounded or ungrounded, we\nhave two options with respect to\n ground: claim that there is some fact\nthat grounds it, or claim that it's ungrounded. Let's consider the\nsecond option first. Intuitively, any correct fundamental description of the world won't\nmention labor strikes (or truck drivers or picketing, for that\nmatter). What sort of metaphysical picture would vindicate the idea\nthat such descriptions are strike-free? Here is a simple\ngrounding-theoretic proposal: all the facts concerning strikes are\ngrounded in facts that don't concern strikes. Call this proposal the\ngrounding-strike thesis. But suppose, per the second option, that\nground is ungrounded. Hence, while\n picket and strike\n may be grounded\nin facts that don't concern strikes, there is a fact concerning\nstrikes—ground—that\n isn't grounded in facts that don't\nconcern strikes, because it's not grounded in any facts at all. It\nfollows that the grounding-strike thesis is false. So, if you're\nsympathetic to something like this thesis, it seems that the second\noption isn't for you (see deRosset 2013 and Sider 2012: Ch. 8 for\nrelated discussion). So let's turn to the first option—the thesis that\n ground is\ngrounded. Two sorts of proposals along these lines have been explored\nso far in the literature. The first proposal is that\n ground is\ngrounded in a fact it contains—picket.\n Moreover, picket grounds\nthe fact that picket grounds\n ground, the fact that\n picket grounds the\nfact that picket grounds\n ground, and so on, ad infinitum\n(Bennett 2011b; deRosset 2013). So long as\n picket is grounded in facts\nthat don't concern strikes, this proposal is compatible with the\ngrounding-strike thesis. One worry for this proposal, however, is\nthis: where there is grounding there is a distinctive form of\nexplanation (see §4), and it's unclear that\nthere is an explanatory connection of the appropriate sort between\npicket and these additional facts.\n (See deRosset 2013 for an attempt\nto resolve this problem.)  The second proposal is that ground\n is grounded in a fact that\nspeaks directly to the connection between\n picket and strike. Following\nFine (2012) and Rosen (2010), one version of this proposal goes like\nthis.  Suppose that it lies in the nature of the property of being a\nstrike that if workers are picketing outside their workplace instead\nof working, then the fact that this is so grounds the fact that\nthey're on strike. Call this fact\n ‘essence’ and the\nconjunctive fact consisting of\n picket and essence\n‘conjunction’.\n conjunction grounds\n ground. Call the fact\nthat conjunction grounds\n ground ‘ground*’.\n ground* is\ngrounded in a similar way—there is an essential truth of the\nappropriate sort—call it\n ‘essence*’—such that\nthe conjunctive fact consisting of\n conjunction and\n essence*—call\nthis fact ‘conjunction*’—grounds\n ground*. Call the\nfact that conjunction* grounds\n ground* ‘ground**’\n ground**\ngets the same sort of treatment, and so on, ad infinitum. So\nlong as picket and the various essential\n truths involved in the\nproposal—essence,\n essence*, and so on—are all grounded in\nfacts that don't concern strikes, the proposal is compatible with the\ngrounding-strike thesis.  One worry for this proposal, however, is\nthis: while picket is\n presumably grounded in facts that don't concern\nstrikes, it's unclear what if anything grounds facts\n like essence\n(see §5). If such facts lack grounds we must\nagain reject the grounding-strike thesis.  It's worth noting that there are potential problems for the idea\nthat the facts about what grounds what are grounded that arise\nindependently of any particular account of how these facts are\ngrounded. One such worry, impressionistically put, is this: if the\nfacts about what grounds what are grounded, does this not preclude our\nproviding an explanation of how grounding got into the picture in the\nfirst place? (Compare: if any candidate explanation of why there are\nany contingent entities at all appeals to further contingent entities,\nthis shows that there is no ultimate explanation of why there are such\nentities, or so the idea goes.) Not everyone agrees that there is a place in the philosopher's\ntoolkit for the notion of grounding. What philosophers find\nobjectionable about talk of grounding varies. Some think that the very\nidea of metaphysical inquiry is suspect. If this is your view, then\nyou're probably not going to like grounding. We obviously assume that\nmetaphysical inquiry is legitimate, so we set this sort of concern\nabout grounding to the side.  There are philosophers, however, who think that metaphysics is\nlegitimate and nevertheless take issue with the notion of grounding.\nSider (2012), for example, while pro-metaphysics, is anti-grounding.\nOne of his main concerns is that grounding-theoretic proposals in his\nview fail to vindicate the idea that any correct fundamental\ndescription of the world will be, say, strike-free (see §7). Hofweber (2009), while not suspicious of metaphysics per\nse, is suspicious of what he calls ‘esoteric’\nmetaphysics—roughly, metaphysical inquiry that appeals to\nnon-quotidian notions that aren't analyzable in terms of quotidian\nnotions—and he sees the proponent of grounding as engaging in\nesoteric metaphysics.  It seems, however, that the notion of grounding\nmay indeed figure in everyday cognition, for it seems that we often\nmake grounding claims in ordinary discourse (e.g., the claim that\nFrank is sick in virtue of having a cold). Moreover, so long as we\nclearly articulate the theoretical role that a primitive non-quotidian\nconcept is supposed to play—think, for example, about Lewis'\n(1983a) discussion of the concept of naturalness—it's unclear\nwhat's wrong with appealing to such concepts in doing metaphysics, so\nlong as they are up to playing the roles we've assigned to them. (See\nRaven 2012 for further discussion.) Daly (2012) argues that, while there is nothing wrong with\nmetaphysics per se, there is a problem for the notion of\ngrounding—it's incoherent. Part of Daly's strategy involves\nrebutting arguments to the effect that we understand the notion.\nSuppose the proponent of grounding claims that (i) we can analyze\nvarious quasi-technical notions (say, the notion of fundamentality) in\nterms of the concept of grounding, so (ii) pointing to how grounding\nis related to such notions helps us understand what talk of grounding\ncomes to (§6.3). Daly claims that, in\nendorsing (i), the proponent of grounding is claiming that (iii) we\nhave no understanding of these quasi-technical notions independent of\nour understanding of grounding.  Daly claims that, if (iii) is true,\nthen (ii) can't be right—if the only way we have of\nunderstanding these quasi-technical notions is through the concept of\ngrounding, we can't turn around and claim that pointing to how these\nnotions are related gives us an understanding of the notion of\ngrounding as well. (So it's no good appealing to the notion of\nfundamentality to help us understand grounding, whilst also defining\nthe former in terms of the latter.)  It's unclear, however, why we should think that the proponent of\ngrounding is committed to (iii). As a general matter, it's not the\ncase that when we set out to analyze one quasi-technical notion in\nterms of another, we're committed to the idea that our understanding\nof the former is parasitic on our understanding of the\nlatter. Returning to the concept of intrinsicality\n(§6.3), it seems that there are orienting\ncharacterizations of the notion that don't explicitly appeal to the\nconcept of grounding (e.g., the claim that a property is intrinsic\njust in case an ascription of it to something is entirely about how\nthat thing and its parts are, and not at all about how things wholly\ndistinct from it are—see Lewis 1983b). But that there are such\ncharacterizations of intrinsicality is compatible with the claim that\nthe notion is to be analyzed in terms of the notion of grounding. If\nwe have an independent grip on the notion of intrinsicality, and the\nnotion really is analyzable in terms of the notion of grounding, then\npointing to how these concepts are related does seem to enhance our\nunderstanding of grounding. Koslicki (forthcoming) and Wilson (2014) both provide\ndetailed skeptical challenges to grounding. In what follows we focus\non a common element to their skeptical cases, viz. the claim that a\ncertain type of pro-grounding argument fails. The argument proceeds\nroughly as follows: thus-and-so metaphysical relations are importantly\nunified, which gives us reason to think that there is a distinctive\ncoarse-grained metaphysical relation—the grounding\nrelation—that unifies them. In particular, grounding is either a\ngenus or determinable with respect to these relations (see\n§1). Koslicki challenges the idea that the relevant metaphysical\nrelations display the sort of unity required for us to be justified in\npositing a distinctive coarse-grained metaphysical relation as a\nunifying element. Consider the determinable-determinate relation and\nthe Aristotelian genus-species relation, two relations that are\npresumably among those that the proponent of the argument thinks that\nthe grounding relation unifies. As Koslicki points out, these\nrelations are importantly different. For example, in the case of the\nformer less specific properties (e.g., being colored) are instantiated\nin virtue of more specific properties (e.g., being red), while in the\ncase of the latter more specific properties (e.g., being a square) are\ninstantiated partly in virtue of less specific properties (e.g., being\na rectangle). Wilson (independently) argues for this conclusion as well. Her\ndiscussion focuses on a group of metaphysical relations—what she\ncalls the ‘small-g’ grounding relations—that include\ntoken identity, realization, the classical extensional part-whole\nrelation, the set membership relation, the proper subset relation, and\nthe determinable-determinate relation. (Whereas Wilson sees such\nmetaphysical relations as determination relations, Koslicki\ndoesn't.) Wilson points out that these relations are a heterogeneous\nlot—some, for example, are SPOs while others aren't (see\n §6.2 for a discussion of SPOs). This counts\nagainst the idea there is a distinctive coarse-grained metaphysical\nrelation that is the unifying element with respect to these\nrelations—for what real unity do they display?  Moreover, Koslicki and Wilson both claim that, even if the relevant\nmetaphysical relations turn out to be unified in an important way,\nthis on its own wouldn't license the claim that there is a distinctive\ncoarse-grained metaphysical relation that unifies them. As Koslicki\nnotes, not all objective similarities are in fact indicative of the\npresence of a single covering genus or determinable. For example,\nwe're not justified in assigning all instances of jade to a single\nkind of mineral, despite the fact that instances of jade are\nobjectively similar. And as Wilson notes many think that determinables\nare identical to disjunctions of their possible determinates.\nProponents of this view agree that there are various things that have\nimportant features in common—all these shades are shades\nof red in particular—but they claim that it's a mistake\nto think that this unifying element is distinct from that which it\nunifies—to be red is just to be scarlet or maroon or crimson\nor…. The Koslicki/Wilson argument brings up important and difficult\nissues. One issue is this: just which metaphysical relations does the\nproponent of the unification argument for grounding think are the\nrelevant ones—which relations is grounding supposed to unify?\nAnother more general issue is this: under what conditions are we\njustified in positing particular metaphysical relations on the basis\nof unification considerations in the first place? A direction for\nfuture research on grounding—be it ultimately friendly or\nhostile to the notion—is that of addressing these, and related,\nconcerns.\n ","contact.mail":"rickibliss@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2014-11-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grounding/","author1":"Ricki Bliss","author2":"Kelly Trogdon","entry":"grounding","body.text":"\n\nConsider the following three philosophical claims made by Plato,\nRussell, and Kripke, respectively: (i) an act is lovable by the\ngods in virtue of its being pious, (ii) complexes\nexist because simples exist, and (iii) the fact that our use\nof the term ‘Aristotle’ is causally connected in the right\nkind of way to how it was originally used explains why\n‘Aristotle’ refers to Aristotle when we use the\nterm. There are at least three important observations to make about\nthese claims.  First, it seems that they aren't identity\nclaims. Russell's claim seems to be that, while a complex and the\nsimples that compose it are distinct, we can explain the existence of\nthe former in terms of the existence of the latter. Second, it seems\nthat these claims aren't causal in nature. Kripke's claim isn't that\ncausal facts themselves cause our words to refer to what they do.\nInstead, the idea is that certain causal facts non-causally determine\nthe facts about what words refer to. Third, it seems that these claims\naren't purely modal in nature. The relations of modal entailment,\nsupervenience, and the like are too coarse-grained to capture what\nPlato has in mind. It's necessary that if something is pious, then\nit's lovable by the gods. But it's also necessary that if something is\npious, then \\(2+3=5\\). Plato, however, would presumably deny that\nanything is such that \\(2+3=5\\) in virtue of the fact that it's\npious.\n\nIt seems that we make similar claims in everyday life as well as in\nthe context of philosophy. Suppose you claim that there is a labor\nstrike due to the fact that the truck drivers are refusing to\nwork and instead picketing outside their workplace. In making this\nclaim, you're not saying that for there to be a labor strike just is\nfor there to be truck drivers who are engaging in these particular\nactivities, for strikes can involve workers with different\noccupations, and there are different ways of striking (e.g., workers\nmight go to work but carefully follow all safety regulations so as to\nimpede their productivity). Nor are you claiming that the activity of\nthe truck drivers concurrent with the strike causes there to be a\nstrike. A causal explanation of the strike instead would appeal to\ncertain antecedent events such as how their employer has allotted\npayroll deductions and benefits. Finally, you aren't merely claiming\nthat there is a necessary connection between the concurrent activity\nof the truck drivers and the existence of a labor strike. Instead,\nyou're claiming that the fact that they're refusing to work and\npicketing outside their workplace explains why there is a strike in\nsome metaphysically significant sense. \n\nTaking such considerations as a point of departure, some suggest\nthat claims like those described above should be read\nas grounding claims—claims about what grounds what. We\nbegin by addressing five foundational issues about grounding: (i)\nwhether grounding is unitary, (ii) whether we can analyze the concept\nof grounding, (iii) the logical form of grounding statements, (iv) how\ngrounding is related to explanation, and (v) how it's related to\nnecessity. Then we turn to the application of the notion of grounding.\nIn particular, we address how the notion might allow us to profitably\nformulate familiar philosophical theses, as well as construct novel\nphilosophical accounts. We conclude by discussing two further issues,\nnamely, whether the facts concerning what grounds what themselves have\ngrounds and skepticism about grounding.\n\nIs grounding unitary in the sense that there is a single dependence\nrelation in play in claims like those discussed above? Proponents of\ngrounding tend to claim that grounding is unitary (Audi 2012; Rosen\n2010; Schaffer 2009). They claim that, just as our default position\nwith respect to synchronic identity, causation, parthood, and the like\nis that they're unitary, the same is true of grounding. Grounding naysayers tend to claim that grounding isn't\nunitary. Instead, they claim that grounding is variegated in the sense\nthat claims like those described above traffic in importantly\ndifferent relations (Daly 2012; Hofweber 2009; Koslicki forthcoming;\nWilson 2014). (For more on skepticism about\ngrounding, see §8.)  But some proponents\nof grounding also claim that grounding is variegated. One such\npro-grounding view is this: grounding is akin to a disjunction of\nspecial determination relations, and those who think that grounding is\nunitary have merely singled out a dependence relation that is of\nparticular relevance to metaphysics, that of metaphysical\ngrounding (Fine 2012). The thought is that, in addition to\nmetaphysical grounding, there is, for example, the relation\nof natural grounding that is of particular interest to\nscience and the relation of normative grounding that is of\nparticular interest to ethics. On this view, the topic of this entry\nisn't grounding per se but metaphysical\ngrounding. (Henceforth, when we speak of Fine's views on grounding, we\nmean his views of metaphysical grounding in particular.)  It's also possible that there is a sense in which grounding is both\nunitary and variegated. How so? It may be that there is an important\ncoarse-grained relation—the relation of grounding tout\ncourt—along with various fine-grained grounding\nrelations. Turning to a familiar view of causation will help us get a\nhandle on one such approach to grounding. Some claim that there are various distinctive physical mechanisms\nor spatiotemporally contiguous processes—what we might call\nfine-grained causal relations—that are responsible for events,\nand causation tout court is the distinctive physical relation\nthat unifies the fine-grained causal relations (Salmon 1984; Dowe\n2000). The idea is that we have an important coarse-grained\nrelation—the relation of causation tout\ncourt—that's a genus, and there are various fine-grained\nrelations—fine-grained causal relations—that are species\nrelative to this genus. Similarly, you might claim that there is a coarse-grained\nrelation—the relation of grounding tout court—and\nthat there are various metaphysical relations—the relations of\ngrounding1, grounding2, and so on—that are\nspecies relative to this genus. In this case, the notion of\ngrounding1 is analyzable as ‘grounding +\ndifferentia1’, the notion of grounding2 as\n‘grounding + differentia2’, and so\non. Relations akin to (some of) what Bennett (2011a) calls\n‘building’ relations and (some of) what Wilson calls\n(2014) ‘small-g’ grounding relations are natural\ncandidates for being the relevant metaphysical relations. Consider,\nfor example, the relation of material constitution—the\nmetaphysical relation that a lump of clay bears to the statue that's\ncoincident with it. If grounding1 is a relation akin to\nmaterial constitution then perhaps differentia1 concerns\nspatial coincidence. Or consider the realization relation—the\nmetaphysical relation that DNA molecules bear to genes. If\ngrounding2 is a relation akin to realization then perhaps\ndifferentia2 concerns role properties (e.g., the gene role)\nand their corresponding role fillers (e.g., DNA molecules). If it turns out that we can't specify the right sort of differentia\nfor these relations, another proposal according to which grounding is\nboth unitary and variegated worth considering is this:\ngrounding tout court is a determinable, and the various\nfine-grained grounding relations are determinates of this\ndeterminable.  The same considerations apply, mutatis\nmutandis, to causation.  (Koslicki forthcoming and \nWilson 2014 criticize these approaches to\ngrounding—see §8.)   General statements about a concept help us orient ourselves with\nregard to that concept. Such general statements might specify\napplication conditions for the concept, how it relates to other\nnotions, and so on. If the general conception of grounding just\narticulated is correct, then a substantive orienting characterization\nof grounding is as follows: grounding tout court is the\ncoarse-grained metaphysical relation that unifies various metaphysical\nrelations. But can we do more than offer orienting characterizations\nof grounding? In particular, can we analyze the concept? Some proponents of grounding offer analyses of the notion. Bricker\n(2006), for example, suggests the following partial analysis:\ngrounding is a relation between propositions, and one proposition\ngrounds another if the former is fundamental in nature and\nthe latter supervenes on the\nformer. (See §3 for more on the\nrelata of grounding, and §6.2 for more on\nthe notion of fundamentality).  Correia (2013) considers the prospects\nof various analyses in terms of the notion of essence. The basic idea\nthat runs through his suggested analyses is this: there are essential\ntruths about the grounded connecting them to their\ngrounds. (See §5\nand 7 for more on essential truths\nand grounding.) The more or less received view among proponents of grounding,\nhowever, is that the concept isn't analyzable—the concept of\ngrounding is ultimately primitive in nature (Fine 2012;\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005; Rosen 2010; Schaffer 2009; Witmer et\nal. 2005).  Supposing that the concept is primitive, it's important to\nkeep in mind that this doesn't mean that talk of grounding is obscure,\nor that grounding claims are confused or unjustified. It seems that\nmany notions central to philosophy are unitary and unanalyzable\n(consider synchronic identity, for example), yet this leads few to\ndismiss them as obscure, confused, or unjustified. Assuming that grounding is unitary (we can remain neutral on how\ngrounding might be related to metaphysical relations like material\nconstitution and realization), what is the logical form of grounding\nstatements? While we've been speaking of the\ngrounding relation, some proponents of grounding wish to stay\nneutral on whether there are any properties or relations, so they,\nlikewise, wish to stay neutral on whether there is a grounding\nrelation. These philosophers prefer to regiment grounding talk with a\nnon-truth-functional sentential connective (Correia 2010; Fine 2001,\n2012). Here we can agree, for example, that you can vote because\nyou're a citizen and that this is a grounding claim, but in so doing\nwe aren't committed to the existence of propositions or facts (e.g.,\nthe proposition/fact that you can vote and the proposition/fact that\nyou're a citizen) or relations (the grounding relation that holds\nbetween these propositions/facts).  It's important to realize that the\nconnective view isn't the view that the relata of grounding are\nsentences—this would be to treat grounding expressions\nultimately as predicates introducing a relation that holds between\nsentences. But notice that it's open for the proponent of the\nconnective view to add that, non-ultimately speaking, we may well talk\nabout a relation of grounding, for we can define a relational\npredicate in terms of the non-truth functional sentential\nconnective. Some are more sanguine about relations and are happy to commit\nthemselves to the existence of a grounding relation. Such folks tend\nto regiment grounding talk with a relational predicate. If there is a\ndefault version of the predicate view, it's that the predicate\nexpresses a binary relation holding between facts (Audi 2012; Rosen\n2010). It seems that there are cases in which a single fact is\ngrounded in a plurality of facts (e.g., \\([p \\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) (the\nfact that \\(p \\mathbin{\\&} q\\)) is grounded in \\([p], [q]\\)), so we\ncan think of the logical form of grounding statements on the predicate\nview as follows: \\([p]\\) is grounded in \\(\\Delta\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is a\nplurality of facts. (See, however, Dasgupta 2014 for an argument that\nif grounding is a binary relation then it's plural in both positions.)\nNotice that a plurality can have a single member, so it's fine to\nspeak of one fact being grounded in another fact. For the purposes of\nthis entry we will assume that grounding is a relation between facts,\nthat the logical form of grounding statements is \\([p]\\) is grounded in\n\\(\\Delta\\), and that \\([p]\\) is grounded in \\(\\Delta\\) only if \\([p]\\) and the\n\\(\\Delta\\)s obtain (i.e., the grounding relation is factive). It's worth noting, however, that some advocates of the predicate\nview claim that the grounding predicate expresses a binary relation\nthat is category neutral in that its relata can come from multiple\nontological categories, and their categories needn't match (Cameron\n2008; Schaffer 2009). Those who embrace the restriction to facts may\ndo so on the basis of the grammar of explanatory claims.  It makes no\ngrammatical sense to say that an apple explains anything, whereas the\nfact that it's red might explain something (Sider 2012: Ch. 8). They\nmight also claim that their opponents, who claim that the relation is\ncategory neutral, aren't properly distinguishing between grounding\nproper and a relation of metaphysical dependence more broadly\nconstrued. Advocates of the neutral approach may respond by pointing\nout that explanatory claims have a variety of syntactic\nforms. ‘In virtue of’, for example, requires a sentence as\nits first argument and a sentence nominalization or a singular term\nderived from a sentence as its second. Moreover, some sympathetic with the predicate view suggest that the\ngrounding predicate expresses a quaternary relation. One view along\nthese lines is that the grounding relation includes two slots for\nfacts and two slots for modes of presentation of those facts\n(Jenkins 2011). Suppose that you're in pain, and the fact that you\nhave physical property P and the fact you're in pain are one\nand the same fact. You might think that this case poses the following\nproblem: what we've said so far seems compatible with the idea that\nthe fact that you have P grounds the fact you're in pain, yet\nat the same time it seems wrong to say that a fact can ground\nitself. (See §6.2 for more on whether\ngrounding is irreflexive in nature.) How might we resolve these\napparently inconsistent views? Well, notice that we can consider the\nfact in question under different modes of presentation (MOPs). We can\nconsider it under a non-experiential MOP—as a fact concerning a\nparticular neural property—as well as under an experiential\nMOP—as a fact concerning a particular feeling. You might claim\nthat when we say that the fact that you have P grounds the\nfact that you're in pain, we mean that the fact that you\nhave P, considered under a non-experiential MOP, grounds the\nfact that you have P, considered under an experiential\nMOP. But to say that the fact that you have P grounds itself\nis to make a different grounding claim—it's to claim that the\nfact that you have P, considered under a non-experiential\nMOP, grounds the fact that you have P, considered under the\nvery same MOP. You might claim that, while a grounding claim like the\nformer might be true, no grounding claim like the latter can be\ntrue—if the same fact occupies two of the argument places of the\ngrounding relation then different MOPs must occupy the remaining two\nargument places. (Notice that on a conceptualist view of facts,\naccording to which facts have modes of presentation as constituents,\nthis version of the quaternary view is really a special case of the\nthesis that the grounding relation is binary in nature.)\n  Another quaternary view is that grounding is contrastive in nature,\nso it includes two slots for facts and two slots\nfor contrasts of these facts (Schaffer 2012). Consider again\nthe claim that an act is lovable by the gods in virtue of its being\npious. The idea is that this grounding claim has implicit\ncontrasts. Depending on the context, the claim might be the following:\nthe fact that an act is pious rather than blasphemous grounds the fact\nthat it's lovable by the gods rather than hate-worthy. If you think\nthat grounding either is an explanatory relation or a non-explanatory\nexplanation-backing relation (see §4 for\nfurther discussion) then one reason to take the contrastive view of\ngrounding seriously is the fact explanation may itself be contrastive\nin nature (van Fraassen 1980: Ch. 5). Another reason to take the contrastive approach to grounding\nseriously is this: supposing that grounding is transitive\n(see §6.2), the approach may allow us to\ndeal with apparent failures of transitivity. Let \\(S = \\{a, b, c\\}\\).\nFollowing Schaffer (2012), it seems that (i) the fact that c\nis a member of S (partially) grounds the fact that S\nhas exactly three members, (ii) the fact that S has exactly\nthree members grounds the fact that S has finitely many\nmembers, yet (iii) the fact that c is a member\nof S doesn't ground the fact that S has\nfinitely many members. (See §5 for more on the\ndistinction between full and mere partial grounding.) Here we have an\napparent failure of transitivity. On the contrastive approach, we have\na violation of transitivity instead if the following claims are true:\n(iv) the fact that c is a member of S, rather than\nnot a member of S, (partially) grounds the fact\nthat S has exactly three members, rather than exactly two\nmembers, (v) the fact that S has exactly three members,\nrather than exactly two members, grounds the fact that S is\nfinite rather than infinite, yet (vi) the fact that c is a\nmember of S, rather than not a member\nof S, doesn't ground the fact that S is\nfinite, rather than infinite. As Schaffer points out, while (iv) and\n(vi) seem true, (v) seems false—the fact that S has\nthree members rather than two makes no difference to\nwhether S is finite or not, for it would be finite in either\ncase. Instead, it seems that (vii) the fact that S has\nexactly three members, rather than, say, as many members as there are\nnatural numbers, grounds the fact that S is finite, rather\nthan infinite. But the truth of (iv), (vi) and (vii) is compatible\nwith the transitivity of grounding on the contrastive conception. How might grounding and explanation be related? Proponents of\ngrounding claim that there is a tight connection between them. To\nbegin, note that a mark of explanation is hyperintensionality, and\ngrounding is apparently hyperintensional as well. Suppose that two sentences are intensionally\nequivalent—suppose that any metaphysically possible world in\nwhich the first is true is a world in which the second is true\nand vice versa. Notice that substituting one of these\nsentences for the other can turn true explanation statements into\nfalse ones. Consider the following sentences: (i) ‘Socrates\nexists’, (ii) ‘{Socrates} exists’, and (iii)\n‘{Socrates} exists because Socrates exists’. Suppose that\n(iii) is true. Although (i) and (ii) are intensionally equivalent,\nsubstituting (i) for (ii) and (ii) for (i) in (iii) yields the false\nsentence ‘Socrates exists because {Socrates} exists’. And\nit seems that grounding is hyperintensional in a corresponding\nsense. The fact that Socrates exists and the fact that {Socrates}\nexists are intensionally equivalent—any metaphysically possible\nworld in which the first obtains is a world in which the second\nobtains and vice versa. It seems that the fact that Socrates\nexists grounds the fact that {Socrates} exists.  Although the facts at\nissue here are intensionally equivalent, it's not the case that the\nfact that {Socrates} exists grounds the fact that Socrates\nexists.  While the notion of grounding is often introduced in explicitly\nexplanatory terms, there are two importantly different ways of\nmaintaining that there is a tight connection between grounding and\nexplanation. Let's suppose that an explanation is a list of facts\nwhere some of them bear an explanatory relation to the\nothers, and explanation, like grounding, is factive in the sense that\nif one fact explains another then both facts obtain. The first view is that there are multiple explanatory relations,\nand grounding is one of them. Fine writes, We take ground to be an explanatory\nrelation: if the truth that P is grounded in other truths,\nthen they account for its truth; P's being the case\nholds in virtue of the other truths' being the case. (2001:\n15; see also Dasgupta 2014 and Litland 2013) The relevant notion of explanation in this case\nis metaphysical in character, where what this is commonly taken to\nmean is that whether some facts bear an explanatory relation to others\ndoesn't depend on our explanatory interests or what we happen to\nunderstand (Strevens 2008: Ch. 1). Let a relation be a backing relation just in\ncase, instead of being an explanatory relation, it backs or\nunderwrites explanations. Backing relations are the worldly\ndetermination relations that explanations track or correspond to (Kim\n1994; Ruben 1990: Ch. 7).  The second view is that there are multiple\nbacking relations, and grounding is one of them. Audi writes, If we recognize [cases of non-causal explanation]\nand we agree that explanations require non-explanatory relations\nunderlying their correctness, then we are committed to recognizing a\nnon-causal relation at work in these explanations.\n (2012: 687–8) For Audi this non-causal relation is grounding (see also\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005 and Schaffer 2012). The relevant notion of\nexplanation in this case is either metaphysical or\nepistemic/communicative in character. In the latter case, whether a\nfact is a candidate explanans depends on our explanatory\ninterests and/or what we happen to understand, so whether some facts\nbear an explanatory relation to others depends in part on these\nfactors as well (van Fraassen 1980: Ch. 5). Another view is that grounding is neither an explanatory nor a\nbacking relation. According to Wilson, the idea that grounding claims\n(where grounding is understood as a distinctive coarse-grained\nmetaphysical relation) have distinctive explanatory import doesn't\nsurvive scrutiny: …from the bare fact that some goings-on are\n Grounded in some others it hardly follows that the latter\n metaphysically explain the former in any interesting sense; nor does\n a bare Grounding claim itself constitute an explanation in either a\n metaphysical or epistemic sense. (2014: 553) (This is part of Wilson's case for skepticism\n about grounding in\n general—see §8.) Now we turn to the matter of how the concept of grounding is\nrelated to another notion of obvious philosophical interest—that\nof necessity. Let \\(\\Delta\\) metaphysically necessitate \\([p]\\) just in\ncase any metaphysically possible world in which the \\(\\Delta\\)s obtain is\na world in which \\([p]\\) obtains. Proponents of grounding all agree that\ngrounding isn't a purely modal relation like metaphysical\nnecessitation.  Every world in which my socks exist is also a world in\nwhich \\(2+3=5\\), and yet we don't want to say that the fact that my\nsocks exist grounds the fact that \\(2+3=5\\). Still, there might be a tight connection between grounding and\nnecessity. Intuitively, there is a distinction between full and mere\npartial grounding. One way to illustrate the distinction is by way of\nthe following contrast: while, for some suitable \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), \\([p\n\\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) is merely partially grounded in \\([p]\\), \\([p \\vee\nq]\\) is fully grounded in \\([p]\\).  Let's say that full grounding carries\nmetaphysical necessity just in case if \\([p]\\) is fully grounded in\n\\(\\Delta\\) then \\(\\Delta\\) metaphysically necessitates \\([p]\\). We take it\nthat the default view among proponents of grounding is that full\ngrounding carries metaphysical necessity (Audi 2012; Dasgupta 2014;\ndeRosset 2010; Rosen 2010; Trogdon 2013). Some, however, reject this view (Chudnoff 2011; Dancy 2004: Ch. 3;\nLeuenberger 2014a; Schnieder 2006; Skiles 2014). Why think that\nfull grounding doesn't carry metaphysical necessity? There are various\ncases discussed in the literature—here is one to\nconsider. Suppose you reason as follows: (i) I promised to \\(f\\),\n(ii) my promise wasn't given under duress, (iii) I'm able to \\(f\\),\nso, (iv) I ought to \\(f\\). You might claim that (i) gives you a\nreason to commit the action, while (ii) and (iii), though not\nproviding reasons themselves, jointly enable (i) to do so. Moral:\nwhile the fact that you promised to \\(f\\) fully grounds the fact\nthat you ought to \\(f\\), the fact that your promise wasn't given\nunder duress, the fact that you're able to \\(f\\), and additional\nrelevant facts, jointly enable the promise-fact to fully ground the\nobligation-fact. But the former doesn't metaphysically necessitate the\nlatter (Dancy 2004: Ch.  3). Proponents of the default view, however,\nwould presumably respond as follows: the fact that you promised\nto \\(f\\) does not, by itself, make it the case that you ought\nto \\(f\\), or explain why you ought to \\(f\\). It's not a full\nground. It may be a sufficient practical reason for \\(f\\)-ing, but that's\na separate matter. (For a discussion of the connection between\ngrounding and supervenience in contrast to metaphysical necessitation,\nsee Leuenberger 2014b.) Another important issue concerns what, if anything, grounds\nnecessities. There are at least two questions to consider here. The\nfirst is this: if \\([p]\\) is a metaphysically necessary fact, what, if\nanything, grounds \\([p]\\)? You might think that if \\([p]\\) is\nmetaphysically necessary then nothing grounds \\([p]\\), for the\nmetaphysically necessary facts aren't apt for explanation in the sense\nof explanation relevant to grounding (or any sense at all, according\nto some).  Metaphysically contingent facts, by contrast, are apt for\nthis sort of explanation. While there may be such (contingent) facts\nthat lack grounds (e.g., facts concerning the fundamental physical\nmagnitudes), these are the sorts of facts that can have grounds but\nsimply happen not to (where ‘can’ is understood\nepistemically). There is reason to think, however, that metaphysically necessary\nfacts are apt for explanation in the sense of explanation relevant to\ngrounding. Consider, for example, the fact that \\(2+3=5\\). While this is\n(we will suppose) a metaphysically necessary fact, it seems that it's\napt for explanation in terms of facts about numbers, mathematical\nstructures, or the like. Indeed, we seem to be possessed of the\nresources to ground some amongst our necessities. Suppose that both\n\\([p]\\) and \\([q]\\) are metaphysically necessary facts, so \\([p\n\\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) is a metaphysically necessary fact as well. It\nseems that any conjunctive fact is grounded in the plurality\nconsisting of its conjuncts, so \\([p \\mathbin{\\&} q]\\) is grounded\nin \\([p]\\), \\([q]\\). The second question: if \\([p]\\) is a metaphysically necessary fact,\nwhat grounds the fact that \\([p]\\) is metaphysically necessary?\nReductive modal analyses—analysis of modal discourse in\nnon-modal terms—are naturally thought of as grounding theses in\nthe sense that they aim to provide grounds for such facts that don't\nthemselves appeal to modality. (For more on the role that grounding\nmight play in formulating philosophical accounts,\nsee §6.) For example, Fine's (1994) analysis\nof metaphysical necessity in terms of essence is naturally cast as a\ngrounding thesis: the fact that \\([p]\\) is metaphysically necessary is\ngrounded in essential facts—facts concerning the essences of\ncertain entities (Rosen 2010). According to Fine, the essential features of an entity tell\nus what the entity is, as opposed to how that entity\nis.  So you might claim that the essential facts themselves aren't apt\nfor explanation in the sense of explanation relevant to grounding\n(Dasgupta forthcoming). Matters here are complicated, though, once we\nconsider the notion of fundamentality.  If the fundamental facts (as\nsome have suggested) are just those facts that lack grounds, then if\nthe essential facts lack grounds then they're fundamental in\nnature. Suppose that it's an essential fact that if Obama exists then\nhe's human. You might think, however, that, whatever the fundamental\nfacts turn out to be, they won't include facts about Obama. If this is\nright, then either this fact about Obama isn't an essential fact, it\nhas grounds after all, or it's wrong to think that a fact is\nfundamental just in case it lacks grounds. One view is that the fundamental facts are contingent. Given that\nthe essential facts are metaphysically necessary, on this picture they\nwon't count as fundamental. This view, however, faces a\nproblem vis-à-vis metaphysical necessity. Suppose that the\nfundamental facts are contingent. And suppose that (i) \\([p]\\) is a\nfundamental fact, and (ii) \\([p]\\) grounds [\\([q]\\) is metaphysically\nnecessary]. Since the fundamental facts could have been otherwise,\nthere are metaphysically possible worlds in which \\([p]\\) doesn't\nobtain.  Presumably some of the worlds in which \\([p]\\) doesn't obtain\nare worlds in which the fact that it actually grounds—[\\([q]\\) is\nmetaphysically necessary]—doesn't obtain either. If there are\nworlds in which the latter doesn't obtain, there are worlds in which\n\\([q]\\) doesn't obtain. But if there are worlds in which \\([q]\\) doesn't\nobtain, \\([q]\\) isn't metaphysically necessary after\nall. (See §6.2 for further discussion of\ngrounding and fundamentality). In this section we discuss two potential applications of the notion\nof grounding in some detail and briefly describe two others.  How should we understand the debate between the dualist and the\nnon-reductive physicalist? We can start with the following intuitive\ncharacterization of non-reductive physicalism about the mental: while\nthe mental and the physical are distinct, they aren't on a\npar—the latter enjoys a special priority with respect to the\nformer. In what sense, however, might the physical be prior to the\nmental—what does priority come to here? A familiar idea is that\npriority in the relevant sense can be understood in terms of purely\nmodal notions such as metaphysical necessitation or supervenience.\nLet's say that property P metaphysically necessitates\nproperty Q just in case it's metaphysically necessary that\nif P is instantiated then Q is instantiated.\nProposal: the physical is prior to the mental in the relevant sense\njust in case (i) for any mental property M, if M is\ninstantiated, then there is some instantiated physical\nproperty P that metaphysically necessitates M, yet\n(ii) it's not the case that, for any physical property P,\nif P is instantiated, then there is some instantiated mental\nproperty M that metaphysically necessitates P.\n  Does this capture the relevant sense of priority? Well, consider a\nparallel thesis, what we'll call non-reductive phenomenalism about the\nmathematical. Here is an intuitive characterization of the thesis:\nwhile the mathematical and the mental are distinct, they aren't on a\npar—the latter enjoys a special priority with respect to the\nformer. Suppose that the notion of priority at issue here is the same\nnotion that is at issue in non-reductive physicalism about the\nmental. In this case, it's clear that few would accept non-reductive\nphenomenalism about the mathematical. But suppose that the relevant\nnotion of priority is to be understood in terms of metaphysical\nnecessitation in the way suggested above. So the mental is prior to\nthe mathematical in relevant sense just in case (i) for any\nmathematical property P, if P is instantiated, then\nthere is some instantiated mental property M such\nthat M metaphysically necessitates P, yet (ii) it's\nnot the case that, for any mental property M, if M\nis instantiated, then there is some instantiated mathematical\nproperty P such that P metaphysically\nnecessitates M.  The right hand side of this biconditional,\nhowever, is something that many would accept! The reason is simple:\nmany think that just which mathematical properties are instantiated is\na necessary matter.  (Example: it's metaphysically necessary that the\noperation of addition instantiates the property of being associative.)\nThis suggests that the notion of priority at issue in non-reductive\nphysicalism about the mental isn't to be understood in terms of\nmetaphysical necessitation in the manner suggested above.\n  There are various ways we might refine the purely modal take on\npriority described above to avoid this particular problem. We suspect,\nhowever, that with any purely modal characterization of non-reductive\nphysicalism we will encounter similar problems (Horgan 1993,\n2006). How else might we understand the relevant sense of priority,\nthen?  It's natural to turn to the notion of grounding in this case,\nas it isn't a purely modal notion (see §5). A\nfirst pass at a grounding-theoretic formulation of non-reductive\nphysicalism is this: the physical is prior to the mental in the sense\nthat (i) for any mental property M, if M is\ninstantiated, then there is some physical property P such\nthat the fact that M is instantiated is grounded in the fact\nthat P is instantiated, yet (ii) it's not the case that, for\nany physical property P, if P is instantiated, then\nthere is some mental property M such that the fact\nthat P is instantiated is grounded in the fact\nthat M is instantiated.  In this case we get the sort of\nasymmetry between non-reductive physicalism about the mental and\nnon-reductive phenomenalism about the mathematical that we want: the\nmental facts are plausibly grounded in physical facts, yet the\nmathematical facts aren't plausibly grounded in mental facts.\n  Wilson (forthcoming) objects to grounding formulations of\nnon-reductive physicalism, claiming that they leave many issues open\nrelevant to characterizing the dependence of the mental on the\nphysical, ones that any adequate formulation of the thesis must\naddress. She points out that, according to Fine (2001), applications\nof the notion of grounding have no realist or antirealist import. So,\non his conception of grounding, in claiming that certain physical\nfacts ground the mental facts we remain neutral on whether there\nreally are any mental facts in the first place. But surely any\nadequate formulation of non-reductive physicalism should take a stand\non whether there really are mental facts. Notice, however, that the proponent of grounding, while accepting\nmuch of what Fine says about grounding, is free to simply deny Fine's\nthesis about grounding claims lacking realist import—intuitively\nthe relata of the grounding relation (and any relation, for that\nmatter) are real. Moreover, there is a way of interpreting Fine's\nclaim where it doesn't count against grounding formulations of\nnon-reductive physicalism in any case. Fine claims that grounding talk\nis best regimented with a non-truth-functional sentential connective\n(see §2). With such a view, one can speak of facts grounding\nother facts, while ultimately staying neutral on whether there really\nare any facts to begin with.  So, for Fine, in claiming that certain\nphysical facts ground the mental facts, we remain neutral on whether\nthere really are any mental facts because in making grounding claims\nwe remain neutral on whether there are any facts whatsoever. And to\nformulate non-reductive physicalism in such a way that it remains\nneutral on the issue of whether facts should go into our ontology\nisn't unreasonable. (NB: Fine (2012) suggests that physicalism and\nrelated theses are properly formulated in terms of natural grounding\nrather than metaphysical grounding—see §1.)  It's a familiar idea that the world—understood as the fusion\nof all concrete entities—has an overarching layered\nstructure. Where a concrete fact is a fact concerning the existence\nand nature of concrete entities, let metaphysical foundationalism be\nthe thesis that every concrete fact is either fundamental or\nderivative with respect to fundamental concrete facts. According to\nthe grounding conception of metaphysical foundationalism, the notion\nof grounding plays an essential role in this thesis. In particular, we\nshould interpret the thesis as follows: every concrete fact either\nisn't grounded in concrete facts, or is grounded in concrete facts\nthat themselves aren't grounded in concrete facts. The general idea\nbehind this conception of metaphysical foundationalism is that\ngrounding is the relation by which the world is hierarchically\nstructured from fundamental facts to increasingly derivative facts.\nSome may see this application of the notion of grounding as the\nprimary theoretical role it's supposed to play. According to one version of metaphysical foundationalism on the\ngrounding conception—what we'll call monism—all concrete\nfacts that aren't grounded in such facts are global facts—facts\nconcerning the cosmos as a whole. According to another\nversion—what we'll call pluralism—all concrete facts that\naren't grounded in such facts concern proper parts of the world, say\npoint-sized particles or point-sized regions.  Monism and pluralism,\nso characterized, are variants of what Schaffer (2010a)\ncalls priority monism and pluralism, respectively.\nSchaffer's theses concern grounding relations between concrete\nobjects, while ours concern grounding relations between concrete\nfacts.  (See §3 for discussion of the\nview that the relata of grounding include entities in addition to\nfacts.) Contrast the monism/pluralism debate so understood—a\ndebate about what grounds what—with the debate concerning\nwhether there is only one concrete object or many. (See Horgan and\nPotrc 2008 for a defense of the claim that there is only one concrete\nobject.) What else can we say about the grounding conception of metaphysical\nfoundationalism? Well, the thesis is associated with the claim that\ngrounding is well-founded. As we will use the term, grounding\nis well-founded just in case any grounding chain—any chain of\nfacts in which \\([p]\\) is grounded in \\([q]\\), \\([q]\\) is grounded in \\([r]\\),\nand so on—terminates in facts that themselves lack\ngrounds. Schaffer (2010a) claims that grounding is well-founded in\nthis sense, while others such as Bliss (2013, 2014) and Rosen (2010)\nsuggest that there is nothing obviously wrong with grounding being\nnon-well-founded. Supposing that there are some grounding chains that fail to\nterminate in ungrounded facts, we can still maintain that every member\nof such a chain is grounded in facts that themselves lack grounds.\nConsider Euclidean space, which is comprised of points and regions\nthat include those points. Suppose that every region has a region as a\nproper part. And suppose that the existence facts concerning regions\nare grounded in the existence facts concerning their sub-regions, the\nexistence facts concerning sub-regions are grounded in the existence\nfacts concerning their sub-sub-regions, and so on, ad\ninfinitum. Hence, the fact that region R exists is a\nmember of a grounding chain that doesn't terminate in facts that lack\ngrounds. But suppose that the existence facts concerning regions\nare also grounded in the existence facts concerning points.\nSuppose, moreover, that the existence facts concerning points lack\ngrounds. Hence, while the fact that R exists is a member of a\ngrounding chain that doesn't terminate in facts that lack grounds,\nthis fact nonetheless is grounded in facts that themselves lack\ngrounds. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to all the other\nfacts that are links in the grounding chain in question.\n  Returning to the grounding conception of metaphysical\nfoundationalism, the thesis is compatible with the existence of\ngrounding chains of concrete facts that fail to terminate in concrete\nfacts that themselves aren't grounded in such facts. It allows for\nsuch chains, so long as each link itself is grounded in concrete facts\nthat aren't grounded in such facts (Cameron 2008). There is another important issue concerning the grounding\nconception of metaphysical foundationalism. It presupposes that\ngrounding imposes a strict partial ordering (SPO) on the entities in\nits domain: grounding is irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive. Some\nargue, however, that grounding isn't an SPO. Grounding naysayers may\nconclude from this that we should look to alternative grounding-free\nconceptual frameworks to explicate metaphysical foundationalism. Why\nthink, however, that grounding isn't, or doesn't induce, an SPO? We've\nalready seen one challenge to the transitivity of grounding understood\nas a binary relation (see §3). So\nlet's turn to challenges to the idea that grounding is irreflexive and\nasymmetric.  Three challenges to irreflexivity are as follows. First, Lowe\n(1998: 145) suggests that ‘self-explanatory states of\naffairs’ are epistemically possible, so a characterization of\ngrounding shouldn't rule this out. Historically, certain influential\nthinkers have thought that the fact that God exists, for example, is a\nself-explanatory state of affairs. Second, Fine (2010) and Krämer\n(2013) discuss various cases that seem to involve violations of\nirreflexivity. Here's a simple case similar to the more complicated\nones they discuss: consider the fact that some fact or other\nobtains. Call this second-order fact—the fact that some fact or\nother obtains—‘\\(F\\)’. Any fact that obtains is a\nfact that grounds \\(F\\). Since \\(F\\) is itself a fact that\nobtains, \\(F\\) grounds itself. Third, Paseau (2010) points out\nthat, on the assumption that the existence of any set is grounded in\nthe existence of its members, any self-membered set (e.g., \\(g =\n\\{g\\}\\)) is such that the fact that it exists grounds itself. (Standard\nset theory, however, does not admit self-membered sets.) A putative counterexample to the asymmetry of grounding that we\nadapt from Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005 is as follows: [this fact obtains]\nis grounded in [[this fact obtains] obtains] and vice\nversa. Putting the case in terms of propositions rather than\nfacts, such a case, in his view, is one ‘in which the truth of a\nproposition depends on its subject matter and vice versa’ (2005:\n22). Priest (2014: Ch. 11) presents a more humdrum challenge to the\nasymmetry of grounding: the fact that the North Pole exists is\npartially grounded in the fact that the South Pole exists and vice\nversa.  There are at least three points worth keeping in mind about the\ngrounding conception of metaphysical foundationalism. First, while\nthere are several objections to the idea that grounding is an SPO,\nit's by no means a settled matter that it isn't an SPO.  Litland\n(2013) and Raven (2013), for example, both offer various responses to\nsome of the challenges described above. Second, you might accept that\ngrounding isn't an SPO but claim that we can characterize a relation\nin terms of grounding that is an SPO. Supposing that grounding is\nnon-transitive, we can take the transitive closure of\ngrounding—grounding*—as the relation by which the world is\nhierarchically structured. Third, if grounding is indeed an SPO, it\nmay still be that the grounding conception of metaphysical\nfoundationalism is implausible for different reasons. See both\ndeRosset 2010 and Sider 2012: Ch. 8 for different sorts of objection\nto the idea that theses akin to metaphysical foundationalism are\nprofitably formulated in terms of grounding. What are some further potential applications of the notion of\ngrounding? We will consider two. First, consider the notion of\ntruthmaking. Intuitively, if a proposition is true, something makes it\ntrue. If this is right, then what is the relation between a true\nproposition and that which makes it true? What, in other words, is the\ntruthmaking relation? Some proponents of grounding claim that we can\nunderstand truthmaking in terms of grounding, and doing so helps us\nresolve longstanding problems regarding truthmaking, such as the\nproblem of negative existentials (Cameron forthcoming; Liggins 2012;\nSchaffer 2010b). One straightforward grounding-theoretic proposal is\nthis: x is a truthmaker for the proposition that p just in case\n[x exists] grounds \\([p]\\) (see Tahko 2013 for objections to this\nview). Second, some propose to analyze the notion of intrinsicality in\nterms of the notion of grounding. Let an object that doesn't coexist\nwith any contingent object wholly distinct from it be a lonely object,\nand let an object be accompanied just in case it isn't\nlonely. Following Langton and Lewis (1998), let a property P be independent\nof accompaniment just in case it's possible that there is a\nlonely P, a lonely non-P, an accompanied P,\nand an accompanied non-P. Putting aside indiscriminately\nessential properties (e.g., being self-identical), Witmer et\nal. (2005) propose the following: P is an intrinsic property\njust in case P is independent of accompaniment, and it's\nmetaphysically necessary that, for any property Q,\nif P is instantiated in virtue of Q, then Q\nis independent of accompaniment as well. Witmer (2014) goes on\nto propose a similar account of intrinsic properties, though one free\nof modal notions. And Rosen (2010) proposes an account of intrinsic\nproperties in terms of grounding that is free of modal notions as\nwell: P is intrinsic just in case it's metaphysically\nnecessary that, for any x and y, (i) if the fact\nthat x has P is grounded in some fact\ncontaining y as a constituent, y is a part\nof x, and (ii) if the fact that x lacks P\nis grounded in some fact containing y as a constituent,\nagain y is a part of x. (See Bader 2013 for more on\nwhy grounding may be relevant to intrinsicality, and Marshall\nforthcoming for objections to the idea that we can analyze\nintrinsicality in terms of grounding.) Further potential applications of grounding concern perceptual\nknowledge (Chudnoff 2011), temporal ontology (Baron 2014), and\nthe nature of mental content (Trogdon forthcoming). What, if anything, grounds the facts about what grounds what?\nSuppose again that the fact that the truck drivers are refusing to\nwork and instead picketing outside their workplace grounds the fact\nthat there is a labor strike. Call the former fact\n‘picket’, the latter fact\n ‘strike’, and the\nfact that picket grounds\n strike\n ‘ground’. What, if\nanything, grounds facts like\n ground, facts concerning what grounds\nwhat? Assuming that every fact is either grounded or ungrounded, we\nhave two options with respect to\n ground: claim that there is some fact\nthat grounds it, or claim that it's ungrounded. Let's consider the\nsecond option first. Intuitively, any correct fundamental description of the world won't\nmention labor strikes (or truck drivers or picketing, for that\nmatter). What sort of metaphysical picture would vindicate the idea\nthat such descriptions are strike-free? Here is a simple\ngrounding-theoretic proposal: all the facts concerning strikes are\ngrounded in facts that don't concern strikes. Call this proposal the\ngrounding-strike thesis. But suppose, per the second option, that\nground is ungrounded. Hence, while\n picket and strike\n may be grounded\nin facts that don't concern strikes, there is a fact concerning\nstrikes—ground—that\n isn't grounded in facts that don't\nconcern strikes, because it's not grounded in any facts at all. It\nfollows that the grounding-strike thesis is false. So, if you're\nsympathetic to something like this thesis, it seems that the second\noption isn't for you (see deRosset 2013 and Sider 2012: Ch. 8 for\nrelated discussion). So let's turn to the first option—the thesis that\n ground is\ngrounded. Two sorts of proposals along these lines have been explored\nso far in the literature. The first proposal is that\n ground is\ngrounded in a fact it contains—picket.\n Moreover, picket grounds\nthe fact that picket grounds\n ground, the fact that\n picket grounds the\nfact that picket grounds\n ground, and so on, ad infinitum\n(Bennett 2011b; deRosset 2013). So long as\n picket is grounded in facts\nthat don't concern strikes, this proposal is compatible with the\ngrounding-strike thesis. One worry for this proposal, however, is\nthis: where there is grounding there is a distinctive form of\nexplanation (see §4), and it's unclear that\nthere is an explanatory connection of the appropriate sort between\npicket and these additional facts.\n (See deRosset 2013 for an attempt\nto resolve this problem.)  The second proposal is that ground\n is grounded in a fact that\nspeaks directly to the connection between\n picket and strike. Following\nFine (2012) and Rosen (2010), one version of this proposal goes like\nthis.  Suppose that it lies in the nature of the property of being a\nstrike that if workers are picketing outside their workplace instead\nof working, then the fact that this is so grounds the fact that\nthey're on strike. Call this fact\n ‘essence’ and the\nconjunctive fact consisting of\n picket and essence\n‘conjunction’.\n conjunction grounds\n ground. Call the fact\nthat conjunction grounds\n ground ‘ground*’.\n ground* is\ngrounded in a similar way—there is an essential truth of the\nappropriate sort—call it\n ‘essence*’—such that\nthe conjunctive fact consisting of\n conjunction and\n essence*—call\nthis fact ‘conjunction*’—grounds\n ground*. Call the\nfact that conjunction* grounds\n ground* ‘ground**’\n ground**\ngets the same sort of treatment, and so on, ad infinitum. So\nlong as picket and the various essential\n truths involved in the\nproposal—essence,\n essence*, and so on—are all grounded in\nfacts that don't concern strikes, the proposal is compatible with the\ngrounding-strike thesis.  One worry for this proposal, however, is\nthis: while picket is\n presumably grounded in facts that don't concern\nstrikes, it's unclear what if anything grounds facts\n like essence\n(see §5). If such facts lack grounds we must\nagain reject the grounding-strike thesis.  It's worth noting that there are potential problems for the idea\nthat the facts about what grounds what are grounded that arise\nindependently of any particular account of how these facts are\ngrounded. One such worry, impressionistically put, is this: if the\nfacts about what grounds what are grounded, does this not preclude our\nproviding an explanation of how grounding got into the picture in the\nfirst place? (Compare: if any candidate explanation of why there are\nany contingent entities at all appeals to further contingent entities,\nthis shows that there is no ultimate explanation of why there are such\nentities, or so the idea goes.) Not everyone agrees that there is a place in the philosopher's\ntoolkit for the notion of grounding. What philosophers find\nobjectionable about talk of grounding varies. Some think that the very\nidea of metaphysical inquiry is suspect. If this is your view, then\nyou're probably not going to like grounding. We obviously assume that\nmetaphysical inquiry is legitimate, so we set this sort of concern\nabout grounding to the side.  There are philosophers, however, who think that metaphysics is\nlegitimate and nevertheless take issue with the notion of grounding.\nSider (2012), for example, while pro-metaphysics, is anti-grounding.\nOne of his main concerns is that grounding-theoretic proposals in his\nview fail to vindicate the idea that any correct fundamental\ndescription of the world will be, say, strike-free (see §7). Hofweber (2009), while not suspicious of metaphysics per\nse, is suspicious of what he calls ‘esoteric’\nmetaphysics—roughly, metaphysical inquiry that appeals to\nnon-quotidian notions that aren't analyzable in terms of quotidian\nnotions—and he sees the proponent of grounding as engaging in\nesoteric metaphysics.  It seems, however, that the notion of grounding\nmay indeed figure in everyday cognition, for it seems that we often\nmake grounding claims in ordinary discourse (e.g., the claim that\nFrank is sick in virtue of having a cold). Moreover, so long as we\nclearly articulate the theoretical role that a primitive non-quotidian\nconcept is supposed to play—think, for example, about Lewis'\n(1983a) discussion of the concept of naturalness—it's unclear\nwhat's wrong with appealing to such concepts in doing metaphysics, so\nlong as they are up to playing the roles we've assigned to them. (See\nRaven 2012 for further discussion.) Daly (2012) argues that, while there is nothing wrong with\nmetaphysics per se, there is a problem for the notion of\ngrounding—it's incoherent. Part of Daly's strategy involves\nrebutting arguments to the effect that we understand the notion.\nSuppose the proponent of grounding claims that (i) we can analyze\nvarious quasi-technical notions (say, the notion of fundamentality) in\nterms of the concept of grounding, so (ii) pointing to how grounding\nis related to such notions helps us understand what talk of grounding\ncomes to (§6.3). Daly claims that, in\nendorsing (i), the proponent of grounding is claiming that (iii) we\nhave no understanding of these quasi-technical notions independent of\nour understanding of grounding.  Daly claims that, if (iii) is true,\nthen (ii) can't be right—if the only way we have of\nunderstanding these quasi-technical notions is through the concept of\ngrounding, we can't turn around and claim that pointing to how these\nnotions are related gives us an understanding of the notion of\ngrounding as well. (So it's no good appealing to the notion of\nfundamentality to help us understand grounding, whilst also defining\nthe former in terms of the latter.)  It's unclear, however, why we should think that the proponent of\ngrounding is committed to (iii). As a general matter, it's not the\ncase that when we set out to analyze one quasi-technical notion in\nterms of another, we're committed to the idea that our understanding\nof the former is parasitic on our understanding of the\nlatter. Returning to the concept of intrinsicality\n(§6.3), it seems that there are orienting\ncharacterizations of the notion that don't explicitly appeal to the\nconcept of grounding (e.g., the claim that a property is intrinsic\njust in case an ascription of it to something is entirely about how\nthat thing and its parts are, and not at all about how things wholly\ndistinct from it are—see Lewis 1983b). But that there are such\ncharacterizations of intrinsicality is compatible with the claim that\nthe notion is to be analyzed in terms of the notion of grounding. If\nwe have an independent grip on the notion of intrinsicality, and the\nnotion really is analyzable in terms of the notion of grounding, then\npointing to how these concepts are related does seem to enhance our\nunderstanding of grounding. Koslicki (forthcoming) and Wilson (2014) both provide\ndetailed skeptical challenges to grounding. In what follows we focus\non a common element to their skeptical cases, viz. the claim that a\ncertain type of pro-grounding argument fails. The argument proceeds\nroughly as follows: thus-and-so metaphysical relations are importantly\nunified, which gives us reason to think that there is a distinctive\ncoarse-grained metaphysical relation—the grounding\nrelation—that unifies them. In particular, grounding is either a\ngenus or determinable with respect to these relations (see\n§1). Koslicki challenges the idea that the relevant metaphysical\nrelations display the sort of unity required for us to be justified in\npositing a distinctive coarse-grained metaphysical relation as a\nunifying element. Consider the determinable-determinate relation and\nthe Aristotelian genus-species relation, two relations that are\npresumably among those that the proponent of the argument thinks that\nthe grounding relation unifies. As Koslicki points out, these\nrelations are importantly different. For example, in the case of the\nformer less specific properties (e.g., being colored) are instantiated\nin virtue of more specific properties (e.g., being red), while in the\ncase of the latter more specific properties (e.g., being a square) are\ninstantiated partly in virtue of less specific properties (e.g., being\na rectangle). Wilson (independently) argues for this conclusion as well. Her\ndiscussion focuses on a group of metaphysical relations—what she\ncalls the ‘small-g’ grounding relations—that include\ntoken identity, realization, the classical extensional part-whole\nrelation, the set membership relation, the proper subset relation, and\nthe determinable-determinate relation. (Whereas Wilson sees such\nmetaphysical relations as determination relations, Koslicki\ndoesn't.) Wilson points out that these relations are a heterogeneous\nlot—some, for example, are SPOs while others aren't (see\n §6.2 for a discussion of SPOs). This counts\nagainst the idea there is a distinctive coarse-grained metaphysical\nrelation that is the unifying element with respect to these\nrelations—for what real unity do they display?  Moreover, Koslicki and Wilson both claim that, even if the relevant\nmetaphysical relations turn out to be unified in an important way,\nthis on its own wouldn't license the claim that there is a distinctive\ncoarse-grained metaphysical relation that unifies them. As Koslicki\nnotes, not all objective similarities are in fact indicative of the\npresence of a single covering genus or determinable. For example,\nwe're not justified in assigning all instances of jade to a single\nkind of mineral, despite the fact that instances of jade are\nobjectively similar. And as Wilson notes many think that determinables\nare identical to disjunctions of their possible determinates.\nProponents of this view agree that there are various things that have\nimportant features in common—all these shades are shades\nof red in particular—but they claim that it's a mistake\nto think that this unifying element is distinct from that which it\nunifies—to be red is just to be scarlet or maroon or crimson\nor…. The Koslicki/Wilson argument brings up important and difficult\nissues. One issue is this: just which metaphysical relations does the\nproponent of the unification argument for grounding think are the\nrelevant ones—which relations is grounding supposed to unify?\nAnother more general issue is this: under what conditions are we\njustified in positing particular metaphysical relations on the basis\nof unification considerations in the first place? A direction for\nfuture research on grounding—be it ultimately friendly or\nhostile to the notion—is that of addressing these, and related,\nconcerns.\n ","contact.mail":"old.jabo@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
