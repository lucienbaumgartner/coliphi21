Wolfson once described medieval philosophy as a philosophy\n“which placed itself at the service of Scriptures”\n(Philo, II, p. 439). From a formal aspect, a new genre was\ncreated: “From now on, a new form of exposition appears in\nphilosophic literature, the homily on some scriptural text or the\nrunning commentary upon some scriptural books” (p. 444). Joseph\nibn Kaspi is a perfect illustration of this characterization of the\nmedieval philosopher. He wrote some thirty works dedicated to\nexplaining the Bible, in which philosophy served him both as a method\nand as a compendium of philosophical conclusions which, to his mind,\nthe biblical author had wanted to convey to the reader. Some of\nKaspi’s works were devoted to logic and linguistics as methods\nsuitable for biblical exegesis; others were commentaries on books of\nthe Bible or supercommentaries, and he also wrote on theological\nsubjects. Of this vast oeuvre, only some has been published; much\nremains in manuscript, and some works have apparently been lost.\n\n\n\nJoseph b. Abba Mari ibn Kaspi was born circa 1280 in Arles in Provence\n(or in Argentière, in the Languedoc region). Recent studies\nhave shed light on a number of points in Kaspi’s life such as\nhis place of birth, the date of his death and the date of his\nmarriage.  He traveled to Egypt in 1314 for five months:\n \n\nAs we see, it did not meet his expectations—to delve into\nMaimonidean thought, and to learn from Rabbi Abraham the\nNagid. However, his exegesis was enriched by the things he saw on the\njourney. \nWe do not know of independent books by Kaspi from this period. He\nwrote a supercommentary on Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the Bible,\nand a commentary on Sefer HaRikma by Ibn Janah Kaspi’s\nsecond Provencal period (1314–1330) took place in Arles and\nTarascon. During this period, Kaspi apparently married, and his two\nchildren, David, the eldest and Shlomo (1320), were born. In the first\npart of this period, Kaspi resided in Arles, in Provence. There Kaspi\ncompleted his philosophical work Tirat Kesef (1317), which was\nharshly criticized by the scholars of Salon, through Kalonymus\n(1318). At the end of this period we find him in Tarascon. \nThe Spanish period in Kaspi’s life: 1330–1345.\n\nIn 1330 Kaspi moved from Tarascon to Spain. In subsequent years Kaspi\nresided in Perpignan, Barcelona, Majorca, Valencia, Tudela. In 1336\nKaspi and his family were residents of Perpignan. Kaspi resided there\nfor several years. It is known to us that Kaspi died in 1345 in\nMajorca. It is not known if he lived in Majorca, and if so, for how\nlong. It seems that he traveled there to be alone and write, though\nthis is uncertain.  In the Spanish period Kaspi wrote many books,\namong them three books on logic and linguistics: Tzror\nHaKesef—a brief work on logic; Retuqot\nKesef—applying the rules of logic to Hebrew and Hebrew\ngrammar; Sharshot Kesef—a Hebrew dictionary. These\nthree books are among the most original and important of Kaspi’s\nwork, and none of them have been printed.  Kaspi was well\neducated. Besides Hebrew and Provençal, he was apparently also\nproficient in Arabic and Latin. He was familiar with the classical\nHebrew religious literature, such as the Talmud and earlier Bible\ncommentaries. He was well versed in the works of Maimonides and his\ntranslator Samuel ibn Tibbon, and probably also familiar with\nFalaquera’s commentary on The Guide of the\nPerplexed. By his own admission, however, his knowledge of\nhalakhic literature was limited. Among the philosophers he mentions,\nbesides Plato and Aristotle, are Averro‘s, Avicenna, Boethius,\nFārābi, and Galen.\n \n\nKaspi considered himself primarily as a commentator. He\ndistinguishes between a “commentary” (perush) and\nan independent work (chibbur), declaring, “I do not\ndefine a work as a ‘commentary’ unless it brings us to the\nreal intention of the author of the book” (Commentary on the Song\nof Songs, p. 184). Nevertheless, he sometimes admits his inability to\nprove that his interpretation represents the author’s real\nmeaning, particular when that “author” is the biblical\nauthor, i.e., God Himself: \n\nUnderstanding the author’s intention is thus seen as a kind of\nprophecy (“whether I prophesy the intention…”).\nKaspi’s interpretative truth, he insists, is concerned not with\nthe author and his intention, but with the reader and his or her\nunderstanding: The commentator can speak for himself alone. Such\nexegesis is subjective, dependent on each of the work’s\ninnumerable readers. Nevertheless, Kaspi is sometimes fairly certain of\nthe author’s meaning: \n\nKaspi here outlines a rather pretentious doctrine, namely, that God\nsomehow informed him of the secret hidden in the text. The criterion of\nhis certainty is coherence. However, given Kaspi’s own theology\n(see below), there is no need to assume that he was claiming to have\nreceived a supernatural revelation. \nLooking at Kaspi’s comments on the logic and its role, two definitions\nemerge for the role of Logic: \nKaspi accused his predecessors of misunderstanding Scripture because\nthey had not used logic: \n\nHe himself wrote a brief treatise on logic (Tseror\nha-Kesef), in which he summarized what he believed were important\nprinciples for a correct interpretation of Scripture. His own exegesis\napplies a variety of techniques: categorizing genera and species,\ndistinguishing between essential and non-essential qualities, asserting\nthe symmetry of relation, understanding the law of contradiction,\nrecognizing valid and invalid syllogisms, as well as logical fallacies.\nFor example, he criticizes commentators who conclude from the truth of\na proposition that its individual parts are also true. To illustrate,\nhe cites the verse “There was no man to till the soil”\n(Genesis 2:5): this verse does not imply that there were at the time no\nhuman beings—a proposition at variance with the Aristotelian\nthesis (to which Kaspi apparently subscribed) that the world has always\nexisted alongside God. \n\nAnother methodological discipline that Kaspi used was the philosophy\nof language. While agreeing with Aristotle that languages are\nconventional rather than natural, he places Hebrew on a higher level,\narguing that its combinations of letters into words are not\naccidental.  A Hebrew word denotes the qualities of the object\ndesignated, and there is a one-to-one relation between words and\ntheir designata.  \nAccording to Kaspi, Hebrew is the most ideal of languages because its\nnouns attest to their characteristics, whether significant or\nmarginal. A man is called adam in Hebrew because he originates\n[partly] in earth (Hebrew: adama), ish because he originates partly in\nfire (Hebrew: esh) and enosh because of his worthless and expendable\nnature (the Hebrew root a-n-sh, claims Kaspi, designates destruction\nand loss).  Another significant principle derived from logic in\nKaspi’s conception of language is generalization. Logic rests\npartly on the division between the general and the specific. Genus is\ndefined as the most general and comprehensive set of all; a species\nconstitutes a subset of a genus with a given characteristic and a\nproperty is a specific definition. According to this principle, claims\nKaspi, a speaker is not obligated to reveal all particulars in his\nchoice of words. He thus blurred clear boundaries in both morphology\nof language (such as differences in gender, number and time) and\nsyntax. Kaspi maintains that the grammatical means a speaker adopts to\nexpress these differences constitute superfluous\ninformation. Consequently, there is nothing peculiar about text that\nuses male instead of female gender and so on. “It is not\nobligatory to insist on gender consistency. A masculine name may well\nbe accompanied by a feminine adjective or verb and vice versa. We have\nbeen fortunate to find textual gender consistency in a few places, but\nwe should not find it unusual if it is lacking in others”\n(Retuqot Kesef, p. 15). In a similar vein, Kaspi writes about texts\nthat use the singular instead of the plural or the past tense instead\nof the future, or texts that lack the concept of a sentence, or other\nsyntactic structures. In\nKaspi’s view, all Hebrew words are distinct; Hebrew has no real\nsynonyms or homonyms. In support of this view he wrote a kind of\ndictionary of the roots of biblical Hebrew (Sharshot Kesef.\nThe dictionary is based on two main assumptions: \nGenerally speaking, contemporary linguistics discerns two key types of\nmeaning differentiation: (a) Between word designata, with\neach synonym designated differently\n(quantitatively—rekhev vs. mekhonith (motor\nvehicle vs. automobile); qualitatively—shikor\nvs. mevusam (inebriated vs. tipsy); (b) among registers or\nlayers of language (layish vs. aryeh (lion). \nKaspi also insisted on an additional type of differentiation among\nsynonyms, maintaining that there is but one designatum and even the\ndesignatees do not differ from one another. Differences among words\nare embodied in the aspects of the designatum that they emphasize. For\nexample, Kaspi explains that the words ḥerev, sakkin,\nmaakheleth and shelaḥ (javelin) are not synonymous\nbecause each designates a different aspect of the object. As far as\nKaspi is concerned, all these objects are cutting instruments,\nknives. One is called ḥerev because it attests to the\ndestruction (ḥurban) of those struck by it;\na sakkin designates the stricken victim as subject to danger\nand then severed from living creatures (according to Kaspi’s\ninterpretation of the root samekh-kaf-nun); the instructive\nword maakhelet informs us that the stricken one is\nslaughtered, consumed (neekhal), terminated and so on. The\nwords ḥerev, sakkin, maakhelet\nand shelaḥ thus designate the same type of tool, a\ncutting instrument. Different words indicate and describe different\nphenomena concerning the designatum, but these are not synonyms. \nAnother significant difference between dictionaries produced up to\nKaspi’s time and Sharshoth Kesef is the order of\ndiscussion of lexical forms. Both Ibn Janaḥ and Radaq, who\npreceded Kaspi, begin by presenting the forms of the verbs derived\nfrom a given Biblical root, to be followed by the noun forms. Unlike\nearlier Hebrew and Arabic lexicographers, Kaspi composed a dictionary\nin which the nouns derived from the root were described first and the\nrelevant verb form system was only shown thereafter. This change in\norder is by no means coincidental. In Retuqot Kesef, Section\n40, Kaspi analyzes the structure of the Hebrew language: First, its\nfounders agreed about the general meaning of each root. They then\ncoined an abstract name designating this meaning that is not connected\nto any particular object or occurrence. Subsequently, they coined the\ninfinitive of the verb, thereby creating the reality to which the noun\nrefers: The infinitive is an abstract noun expressing an\noccurrence. Thereafter, they formed adjectives, that are concretely\nconnected with specific objects. After completing the nouns, they\ninvented the system that addresses tangible activity and\noccurrences. In other words, Kaspi maintains that the formation of\nnouns and the various weights accorded them proceeds from the most\nabstract to the most tangible. As the verb system is most tangible of\nall, it was devised last. \n\nKaspi thus bases his biblical exegesis on the conventional\ntheological assumptions of the philosophy of his times: God is a\nnecessary existent, the Unmoved Mover, the intellect that\nintellectually cognizes itself. Kaspi’s description of God as the\nintellect borders on a certain conception of divine immanence, as he\nmakes the description symmetric: God is the intellect and the intellect\nis in effect God: \n\nKaspi proposes another radical doctrine in connection with the\nAristotelian conception of God as both the intellect, intellectually\ncognizer, and the intellectually cognized object: he compares this\nconception with the Holy Trinity of Christian theology. He is even\nwilling to accept a moderate interpretation of the Trinity: “Some\nindividuals among them (the Christians) are similar to us (in\nopinions)” (Gevia‘ ha-Kesef, p. 27). \n\nKaspi explains the relation between God and the world in as\nnaturalistic a manner as possible. He agrees with the position,\nattributed to Aristotle and Plato, that the world was not created\nex nihilo at a certain point in time, arguing that this was\nalso Maimonides’ position. In that spirit Kaspi himself proposes\na systematic explanation of the creation as described in Genesis. \n\nGod’s continual providence of the world is also understood by\nKaspi in entirely naturalistic terms. He interprets the biblical\nmiracles as rare but natural phenomena—an idea not dissimilar to\nSpinoza’s teachings. To say that a certain phenomenon is contrary\nto natural law, Kaspi writes, is a subjective judgment, “for\nthere is no doubt that those ignorant of natural science believe many\nnatural things to be miraculous, not natural phenomena”\n(Tirat Kesef, p. 12). This may be compared with Spinoza in his\nTractatus Theologico-Politicus (Chap. 6): “[S]ince\nmiracles were wrought according to the understanding of the masses, who\nare wholly ignorant of the workings of nature,… we cannot doubt that\nmany things are narrated in Scripture as miracles of which the causes\ncould easily be explained by reference to ascertained workings of\nnature.” Kaspi also holds that a wise prophet is capable of\nperforming miracles thanks to the possession of extensive knowledge.\nMoses, the wisest of men, performed miracles in Egypt because “he\nhad acquired knowledge of the celestial body… as he had apprehended\nthe world of the [four sublunar] elements” (Menorat\nKesef, p. 93). This knowledge enabled him to inflict the plagues\nupon the Egyptians: “Moses performed with the four [elements]\nactions that would be impossible for any [other] wise man”\n(Commentary on Proverbs B, p. 127). \n\nDiscussing the relationship between the prophet and the wise man,\nKaspi agrees with the Muslim thinker al-Batalyusi that a person with a\nprophetic soul is superior in level and essence to the wise man who has\na philosophical soul. Nevertheless, prophecy is not a super-rational\nphenomenon. A prophet’s knowledge of the future is based on\ndeductive inference, since he or she is well acquainted with the world\nand with all details of natural causality. \n\nThe ability of God and the prophets to foresee the future, despite\nthe apparent contradiction with the principle of (free) choice, also\nreceives a rational explanation. Kaspi proposes an analogy between\ntheir positive knowledge and the knowledge of wise men “with a\ngood sense of evaluation and estimation,” who are capable of\nforeseeing the probable behavior of a person on the basis of their\nknowledge of his or her character. Like most medieval theologians,\nKaspi accepts the simultaneous validity of an omniscient God and human\nchoice.. \n\nNot unrelated to this antinomy is the theological problem posed by\nthe human capacity for voluntary action: Maimonides stated the\ndifficulty as follows: “How is it possible that a person can do\nwhatever he pleases?… How can anything be done in the world without\nthe permission and will of its Creator?” (Hilkhot\nTeshuvah 5:4). Maimonides’ own solution was to define human\nchoice as one expression of the divine will, which is the cause of\neverything that takes place in the world; accordingly, God\n“desired man to have his own free will” (ibid.).\nKaspi goes farther, however, suggesting the radical view that God is\n“the remote mover,” even when a person chooses to realize\nhis free will by sinning and worshiping idols; it was in that sense\nthat the Bible described God as hardening Pharaoh’s heart\n(Matsref la-Kesef, pp. 152–153). \n\nIn any case, Kaspi provides his readers with guidelines for a\nvirtuous life. As a rationalist through and through, he recommends that\na person acquire the best possible education. Every effort should be\nmade to accumulate the financial resources necessary to improve\none’s education, by purchasing books and hiring teachers. Every\nman should set up a family: His wife will support him, and his children\nwill keep him in his old age, “so that he should have time to\nacquire wisdom… Moreover, his sons, if they are good, will join him\nin his studies, all the more so if his eyes have become dimmed with\nage” (Commentary on Proverbs, pp. 59–60). This is a wholly\nutilitarian and egoistical philosophy, recommending self-realization of\nevery human being. Kaspi enunciates these guidelines in the context of\nhis scriptural exegesis, relying primarily on the wisdom literature\nwritten, according to Jewish tradition, by King Solomon, the wisest of\nmen; he also derives his rules from biblical stories, citing the\nbehavior of their heroes. \n\nKaspi’s elitist principles, which creates a disparity between\nthe wise and the masses, also implied a similarity between humans and\nother creatures One application of this thesis may be found in his\ncommentary to Isaiah 41:14, referring to the phrase “worm of\nJacob”: \n\nIn this context Kaspi expressed compassion for animals, coupled with\na tendency toward vegetarianism, profound disapproval of sacrifices; he\neven expresses disapproval of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice\nhis son. \n\nIf medieval philosophy from Philo to Spinoza may indeed be\nunderstood as philosophy at the service of biblical exegesis, Joseph\nibn Kaspi may certainly be viewed as one of its most successful\nrepresentatives. As already mentioned, in some contexts he also\nanticipated some of Spinoza’s controversial ideas. In addition,\nboth Kaspi and Spinoza held that only man is capable of loving God,\nwhereas God does not love man (Kaspi, Commentary on Isaiah, p. 151;\nSpinoza, Ethics, On the Ability of the Intellect,\nTheorem 17). \n\nDespite his brilliance and original thought, Kaspi has never been\nconsidered one of the most important medieval Jewish thinkers or\ncommentators. Only in the 19th century were some of his works\npublished for the first time, and others have yet to see the light of\nday. There are several possible explanations. Perhaps his\ncontroversial ideas militated against his acceptance in the\nsurrounding society. Another explanation is implied by a comparison\nbetween Kaspi and his more famous contemporary, Gersonides, also a\nbiblical exegete and philosopher; Gersonides, despite his by no means\nconservative ideas, earned considerable fame among both Jewish and\nnon-Jewish thinkers.  This was largely thanks to his systematic,\nprofound, philosophical work Milchamot Hashem, which placed\nhim squarely in the realm of philosophy, while his Bible commentaries\nwere written in the spirit of plain interpretation. Kaspi, however,\nwas something of a philosopher among commentators and a commentator\namong philosophers; perhaps that was why he never attained prominence\nin either group. Kaspi’s writings on logic and Hebrew\nlinguistics were indeed highly creative and innovative, but he\nappeared to have lacked good fortune insofar as publication is\nconcerned.

He agrees with the position,\nattributed to Aristotle and Plato, that the world was not created\nex nihilo at a certain point in time, arguing that this was\nalso Maimonides’ position. In that spirit Kaspi himself proposes\na systematic explanation of the creation as described in Genesis. \n\nGod’s continual providence of the world is also understood by\nKaspi in entirely naturalistic terms. He interprets the biblical\nmiracles as rare but natural phenomena—an idea not dissimilar to\nSpinoza’s teachings. To say that a certain phenomenon is contrary\nto natural law, Kaspi writes, is a subjective judgment, “for\nthere is no doubt that those ignorant of natural science believe many\nnatural things to be miraculous, not natural phenomena”\n(Tirat Kesef, p. 12). This may be compared with Spinoza in his\nTractatus Theologico-Politicus (Chap. 6): “[S]ince\nmiracles were wrought according to the understanding of the masses, who\nare wholly ignorant of the workings of nature,… we cannot doubt that\nmany things are narrated in Scripture as miracles of which the causes\ncould easily be explained by reference to ascertained workings of\nnature.” Kaspi also holds that a wise prophet is capable of\nperforming miracles thanks to the possession of extensive knowledge.\nMoses, the wisest of men, performed miracles in Egypt because “he\nhad acquired knowledge of the celestial body… as he had apprehended\nthe world of the [four sublunar] elements” (Menorat\nKesef, p. 93). This knowledge enabled him to inflict the plagues\nupon the Egyptians: “Moses performed with the four [elements]\nactions that would be impossible for any [other] wise man”\n(Commentary on Proverbs B, p. 127). \n\nDiscussing the relationship between the prophet and the wise man,\nKaspi agrees with the Muslim thinker al-Batalyusi that a person with a\nprophetic soul is superior in level and essence to the wise man who has\na philosophical soul. Nevertheless, prophecy is not a super-rational\nphenomenon. A prophet’s knowledge of the future is based on\ndeductive inference, since he or she is well acquainted with the world\nand with all details of natural causality. \n\nThe ability of God and the prophets to foresee the future, despite\nthe apparent contradiction with the principle of (free) choice, also\nreceives a rational explanation. Kaspi proposes an analogy between\ntheir positive knowledge and the knowledge of wise men “with a\ngood sense of evaluation and estimation,” who are capable of\nforeseeing the probable behavior of a person on the basis of their\nknowledge of his or her character. Like most medieval theologians,\nKaspi accepts the simultaneous validity of an omniscient God and human\nchoice.. \n\nNot unrelated to this antinomy is the theological problem posed by\nthe human capacity for voluntary action: Maimonides stated the\ndifficulty as follows: “How is it possible that a person can do\nwhatever he pleases?… How can anything be done in the world without\nthe permission and will of its Creator?” (Hilkhot\nTeshuvah 5:4). Maimonides’ own solution was to define human\nchoice as one expression of the divine will, which is the cause of\neverything that takes place in the world; accordingly, God\n“desired man to have his own free will” (ibid.).\nKaspi goes farther, however, suggesting the radical view that God is\n“the remote mover,” even when a person chooses to realize\nhis free will by sinning and worshiping idols; it was in that sense\nthat the Bible described God as hardening Pharaoh’s heart\n(Matsref la-Kesef, pp. 152–153). \n\nIn any case, Kaspi provides his readers with guidelines for a\nvirtuous life. As a rationalist through and through, he recommends that\na person acquire the best possible education. Every effort should be\nmade to accumulate the financial resources necessary to improve\none’s education, by purchasing books and hiring teachers. Every\nman should set up a family: His wife will support him, and his children\nwill keep him in his old age, “so that he should have time to\nacquire wisdom… Moreover, his sons, if they are good, will join him\nin his studies, all the more so if his eyes have become dimmed with\nage” (Commentary on Proverbs, pp. 59–60). This is a wholly\nutilitarian and egoistical philosophy, recommending self-realization of\nevery human being. Kaspi enunciates these guidelines in the context of\nhis scriptural exegesis, relying primarily on the wisdom literature\nwritten, according to Jewish tradition, by King Solomon, the wisest of\nmen; he also derives his rules from biblical stories, citing the\nbehavior of their heroes. \n\nKaspi’s elitist principles, which creates a disparity between\nthe wise and the masses, also implied a similarity between humans and\nother creatures One application of this thesis may be found in his\ncommentary to Isaiah 41:14, referring to the phrase “worm of\nJacob”: \n\nIn this context Kaspi expressed compassion for animals, coupled with\na tendency toward vegetarianism, profound disapproval of sacrifices; he\neven expresses disapproval of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice\nhis son. \n\nIf medieval philosophy from Philo to Spinoza may indeed be\nunderstood as philosophy at the service of biblical exegesis, Joseph\nibn Kaspi may certainly be viewed as one of its most successful\nrepresentatives. As already mentioned, in some contexts he also\nanticipated some of Spinoza’s controversial ideas. In addition,\nboth Kaspi and Spinoza held that only man is capable of loving God,\nwhereas God does not love man (Kaspi, Commentary on Isaiah, p. 151;\nSpinoza, Ethics, On the Ability of the Intellect,\nTheorem 17). \n\nDespite his brilliance and original thought, Kaspi has never been\nconsidered one of the most important medieval Jewish thinkers or\ncommentators. Only in the 19th century were some of his works\npublished for the first time, and others have yet to see the light of\nday. There are several possible explanations. Perhaps his\ncontroversial ideas militated against his acceptance in the\nsurrounding society. Another explanation is implied by a comparison\nbetween Kaspi and his more famous contemporary, Gersonides, also a\nbiblical exegete and philosopher; Gersonides, despite his by no means\nconservative ideas, earned considerable fame among both Jewish and\nnon-Jewish thinkers.  This was largely thanks to his systematic,\nprofound, philosophical work Milchamot Hashem, which placed\nhim squarely in the realm of philosophy, while his Bible commentaries\nwere written in the spirit of plain interpretation. Kaspi, however,\nwas something of a philosopher among commentators and a commentator\namong philosophers; perhaps that was why he never attained prominence\nin either group. Kaspi’s writings on logic and Hebrew\nlinguistics were indeed highly creative and innovative, but he\nappeared to have lacked good fortune insofar as publication is\nconcerned.
