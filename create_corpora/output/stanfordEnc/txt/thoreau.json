He sought to revive\na conception of philosophy as a way of life, not only a mode of\nreflective thought and discourse. Thoreau’s work was informed by\nan eclectic variety of sources. He was well-versed in classical Greek\nand Roman philosophy, ranging from the pre-Socratics through the\nHellenistic schools, and was also an avid student of the ancient\nscriptures and wisdom literature of various Asian traditions. He was\nfamiliar with modern philosophy ranging from Descartes, Locke and the\nCambridge Platonists through Emerson, Coleridge, and the German\nIdealists, all of whom are influential on Thoreau’s philosophy.\nHe discussed his own scientific findings with leading naturalists of\nthe day, and read the latest work of Humboldt and Darwin with interest\nand admiration. His philosophical explorations of self and world led\nhim to develop an epistemology of embodied perception and a\nnon-dualistic account of mental and material life. In addition to his\nfocus on ethics in an existential spirit, Thoreau also makes unique\ncontributions to ontology, the philosophy of science, and radical\npolitical thought. Although his political essays have become justly\nfamous, his works on natural science were not even published until the\nlate twentieth century, and they help to give us a more complete\npicture of him as a thinker. Among the texts he left unfinished was a\nset of manuscript volumes filled with information on Native American\nreligion and culture. Thoreau’s work anticipates certain later\ndevelopments in pragmatism, phenomenology, and environmental\nphilosophy, and poses a perennially valuable challenge to our\nconception of the methods and intentions of philosophy itself.\n\nThoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1817 and died there in\n1862, at the age of forty-four. Like that of his near-contemporary\nSøren Kierkegaard, Thoreau’s intellectual career unfolded\nin a close and polemical relation to the town in which he spent almost\nhis entire life. After graduating from Harvard in 1837, he struck up a\nfriendship with fellow Concord resident Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose\nessay “Nature” he had first encountered earlier that year.\nAlthough the two American thinkers had a turbulent relationship due to\nserious philosophical and personal differences, they had a profound\nand lasting effect upon one another. It was in the fall of 1837 that\nThoreau, aged twenty, made his first entries in the multivolume\njournal he would keep for the rest of his life. Most of his published\nwritings were developed from notes that first appeared on these pages,\nand Thoreau subsequently revised many entries, so his journal can be\nconsidered a finished work in itself. During his lifetime he published\nonly two books, along with numerous shorter essays that were first\ndelivered as lectures. He lived a simple and relatively quiet life,\nmaking his living briefly as a teacher and pencil maker but mostly as\na land surveyor. Thoreau had intimate bonds with his family and\nfriends, and remained unmarried although he was deeply in love at\nleast twice. His first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack\nRivers, was still a work in progress in 1845, when he went to\nlive in the woods by Walden Pond for two years and two months. This\n“experiment” in living on the outskirts of town was an\nintensive time of examination for Thoreau, as he drew close to nature\nand contemplated the final ends of his own life, which was otherwise\nat risk of ending in quiet desperation. Thoreau viewed his existential\nquest as a venture in philosophy, in the ancient Greek sense of the\nword, because it was motivated by an urgent need to find a reflective\nunderstanding of reality that could inform a life of wisdom. This is\nbecause, according to the view of philosophy as a way of life, that\nvery way of life “will necessarily be deliberative and\nreflective”; accordingly, for Thoreau, “thinking about his\nlife in the woods is central to his life in the woods” (Bates\n2012, 29). \nHis experience bore fruit in the 1854 publication of his literary\nmasterpiece Walden, a work that almost defies categorization:\nit is a work of narrative prose which often soars to poetic heights,\ncombining philosophical speculation with close observation of a\nconcrete place. It is a rousing summons to the examined life and to\nthe realization of one’s potential, while at the same time it\ndevelops what might be described as a religious vision of the human\nbeing and the universe. Walden has been admired by a larger\nworld audience than any other book written by an American author,\nand—whether or not it ought to be called a work of\nphilosophy—it contains a substantial amount of philosophical\ncontent, which deserves to be better appreciated than it has been.\nStanley Cavell has argued that Thoreau is an embarrassment to\n“what we have learned to call philosophy,” since his work\nembodies “a mode of conceptual accuracy” that is\n“based on an idea of rigor” somewhat foreign to the\nacademic establishment (Cavell 1988, 14). Yet, as Cavell also notes,\nphilosophical authors have more than one way to go about their\nbusiness, and Thoreau—like Descartes in the\nMeditations—begins his argument by accounting for how\nhe has come to believe that certain questions need to be addressed. In\nother words, his method is predicated on the belief that it is\nphilosophically worthwhile to clarify the basis of your own perplexity\nand unrest (see Reid 2012, 46). And this is only one way of explaining\nhow a significant part of the challenge in coming to terms with\nThoreau is that his philosophy, like Nietzsche’s, has a literary\nand poetic quality. The reader is charged with finding the coherence\nof Thoreau’s whole philosophical outlook. Accordingly, this\nentry attempts to sort out and delineate the main themes of\nThoreau’s project, in the hope of serving as an aid and stimulus\nto further study. It draws upon Thoreau’s entire corpus,\nincluding the works he left in manuscript that were published after\nhis death. \nIn his essay “Nature,” Emerson asserts that there can be\nfound in the natural world “a sanctity which shames our\nreligions.” Thoreau would agree completely with this statement.\nBut in the same essay Emerson also inclines toward Platonism, stating\nthat nature is “emblematic” of higher truths, and\nsuggesting that the material world has value by virtue of being a\nsubsidiary product of mental reality: each natural object is therefore\n“a symbol of some spiritual fact.” For the most part,\nThoreau recoils from the idea that we could find some kind of higher\nreality by looking beyond nature: in the “Friday” chapter\nof A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, he asks:\n“Is not Nature, rightly read, that of which she is commonly\ntaken to be the symbol merely?” As he sees it, the realm of\nspirit is the physical world, which has a sacred meaning that\ncan be directly perceived. Accordingly, he seeks “to be always\non the alert to find God in nature” (Journal, 9/7/51),\nand to hear “the language which all things and events speak\nwithout metaphor” (Walden, IV). Thoreau’s\nmetaphysical convictions compel him to “defend nature’s\nintrinsic value,” in a way that situates him philosophically in\na place “far removed from Emerson and most\ntranscendentalists” (Cafaro 2004, 132–133). In his\njournal, Thoreau reports that his goal is to “state facts”\nin such a way that “they shall be significant,” rather\nthan allowing himself to be blind to “the significance of\nphenomena” (Journal, 11/9/51 & 8/5/51). Evidently,\nhe does not accept that whatever we register through our aesthetic and\nemotional responses ought to be viewed as unreal. Indeed, Thoreau\nwould argue that the person who is seldom moved by the beauty of\nthings is the one with an inadequate conception of reality, since it\nis the neutral observer who is less well aware of the world as it\nis. \nTo say that nature is inherently significant is to say that natural\nfacts are neither inert nor value-free. Thoreau urges his reader not\nto “underrate the value of a fact,” since each concrete\ndetail of the world may contain a meaningful truth (“Natural\nHistory of Massachusetts”). Note the phrase: the value of a\nfact. Thoreau does not introduce an artificial distinction\nbetween facts and values, or between primary and secondary qualities,\nsince he understands the universe as an organic whole in which mind\nand matter are inseparable. When we perceive sights, sounds, and\ntextures, we are not standing as disembodied consciousness apart from\na world of inanimate mechanisms; rather, we are sentient beings\nimmersed in the sensory world, learning the “essential facts of\nlife” only through “the perpetual instilling and drenching\nof the reality that surrounds us” (Walden, II). The\nphilosopher who seeks knowledge through experience should therefore\nnot be surprised to discover beauty and order in natural phenomena.\nHowever, these properties are not projected onto nature from an\nexternal perspective—rather, they emerge from within the\nself-maintaining processes of organic life. And the entire\nenvironment, the “living earth” itself, has something like\na life of its own, containing but not reducible to the biotic\nexistence of animals and plants (Walden, XVII). This is what\nhe elsewhere describes as the “slumbering subterranean fire in\nnature which never goes out” (“A Winter Walk”). \nThoreau remarks upon the “much grander significance” of\nany natural phenomenon “when not referred to man and his needs\nbut viewed absolutely” (Journal, 11/10/51). The world\nis rich with value that is not of our making, and “whatever we\nhave perceived to be in the slightest degree beautiful is of\ninfinitely more value to us than what we have only as yet discovered\nto be useful and to serve our purpose” (Faith in a\nSeed, 144). It is when we are not guilty of imposing our own\npurposes onto the world that we are able to view it on its own terms.\nOne of the things we then discover is that we are involved in a\npluralistic universe, containing many different points of view other\nthan our own. And when we begin to realize “the infinite extent\nof our relations” (Walden, VIII), we can see that even\nwhat does not at first seem to be good for us may have some\npositive value when considered from a broader perspective. Rather than\ndismissing squirrels as rodents, for instance, we should see them as\n“planters of forests,” and be grateful for the role they\nplay in the distribution of seeds (Journal, 10/22/60).\nLikewise, the “gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in\nthe house to-day is not drear and melancholy, but good for me too.\nThough it prevents my hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my\nhoeing. If it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in\nthe ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands, it would still\nbe good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass,\nit would be good for me” (Walden, V). Our limited view\noften keeps us from appreciating the harmonious interdependence of all\nparts of the natural world: this is not due to “any confusion or\nirregularity in Nature,” but because of our own incomplete\nknowledge (Walden, XVI). Thoreau declares that he would be\nhappy “if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild\nstate,” since in tampering with nature we know not what we do\nand sometimes end up doing harm as a result (Walden, X). In\nmany cases we find that “unhandselled nature is worth more even\nby our modes of valuation than our improvements are”\n(Journal, 11/10/60). \nIn nature we have access to real value, which can be used as a\nstandard against which to measure our conventional evaluations. An\nexample of the latter is the value that is “arbitrarily\nattached” to gold, which has nothing to do with its\n“intrinsic beauty or value” (Journal, 10/13/60).\nSo it is a mistake to rush to California “as if the true gold\nwere to be found in that direction,” when one has failed to\nappreciate the inherent worth of one’s native soil\n(Journal, 10/18/55). In the economy of nature, a seed is more\nprecious than a diamond, for it contains “the principle of\ngrowth, or life,” and has the ability to become a specific plant\nor tree (Journal, 3/22/61). The seed not only provides\nevidence that nature is filled with “creative genius”\n(Journal, 1/5/56), but it also reminds us that a spark of\ndivinity is present in each human being as well. One of\nThoreau’s favorite analogies—not only a metaphor, as he\nsees it—is that between the ripening of a seed and the\ndevelopment of human potential. “The finest qualities of our\nnature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most\ndelicate handling” (Walden, I). What he calls\n“wildness” is not located only in the nonhuman world; the\nsame creative force is also active in human nature, so that even a\nliterary work of art can reasonably be praised as a manifestation of\nwildness (see “Walking”). There is “a perfect\nanalogy between the life of the human being and that of the\nvegetable” (Journal, 5/20/51), and thoughts\n“spring in man’s brain” in just the same way that\n“a plant springs and grows by its own vitality”\n(Journal, 11/8/50 & 4/3/58). Thoreau’s exhortations\nto follow the promptings of one’s genius are based on the idea\nthat by obeying our own wild nature we are aligning ourselves with a\nsacred power. What inspires us to realize our highest potential is\n“the primitive vigor of Nature in us” (Journal,\n8/30/56), and this influence is something we are able neither to\npredict nor to comprehend: as he describes it in the\n“Ktaadn” chapter of The Maine Woods, nature is\n“primeval, untamed, and forever untamable,” a godlike\nforce but not always a kind one. \nAt one point in Walden, Thoreau quips that he\nusually does not count himself among the “true\nidealists” who are inclined to reject “the evidence of\n[their] senses” (Walden, XIV). On the other hand, he\nhas nothing but scorn for the sort of materialism that fails to\npenetrate the inner mystery of things, discovering “nothing but\nsurface” in its mechanistic observations (Journal,\n3/7/59). Instead, he argues that we must approach the world as\n“nature looking into nature,” aware of the relation\nbetween the form of our own perception and what we are able to\nperceive (Correspondence, 7/21/41). There are reasons for\nclassifying Thoreau as both a naturalist and a romantic, although both\nof these categories are perhaps too broad to be very helpful. His\nconception of nature is informed by a syncretic appropriation of\nGreek, Roman, Indian, and other sources, and the result is an eclectic\nvision that is uniquely his own. For this reason it is difficult to\nsituate Thoreau within the history of modern philosophy, but one\nplausible way of doing so would be to describe him as articulating a\nversion of transcendental idealism. If Thoreau is indeed “the\nAmerican heir to Kant’s critical philosophy,” as he has\nbeen called (Oelschlaeger 1991, 136), it is because his investigation\nof “the relation between the subject of knowledge and its\nobject” builds upon a Kantian insight that Emerson, who viewed\nthe senses as illusory, arguably did not grasp (see Cavell 1992,\n94–95). Yet in order to understand why this might be an accurate\ncategorization, we must proceed from Thoreau’s metaphysics to\nhis epistemology. \nIf one were asked to name the cardinal virtue of Thoreau’s\nphilosophy, it would be hard to identify a better candidate than\nawareness. He attests to the importance of “being\nforever on the alert,” and of “the discipline of looking\nalways at what is to be seen” (Walden, IV). This\nexercise may enable one to create remarkably minute descriptions of a\nsunset, a battle between red and black ants, or the shapes taken by\nthawing clay on a sand bank: but its primary value lies in the way it\naffects the quality of our experience. “It is something to be\nable to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to\nmake a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and\npaint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look”\n(Walden, II). Awareness cannot be classified as exclusively a\nmoral or an intellectual virtue, either, since knowing is an\ninescapably practical and evaluative activity—not to mention, an\nembodied practice. Thoreau portrays himself not from a presumably\nneutral or impersonal vantage point, “but from an embodied point\nof view” in which his somatic sensory experience puts him\n“knowingly in touch with” his surroundings (Goodman 2012,\n36). For such reasons as these, he has sometimes been interpreted as a\n“philosopher of the senses” (Mooney 2009, 195), who offers\nan original response to the central problem of modern philosophy as a\nconsequence of recognizing that knowledge is “dependent on the\nindividual’s ability to see,” and that “the\nworld as known is thus radically dependent on character” (Tauber\n2001, 4–5). \nOne of the common tenets of ancient philosophy which was abandoned in\nthe period beginning with Descartes is that a person “could not\nhave access to the truth” without undertaking a process of\nself-purification that would render him “susceptible to knowing\nthe truth” (Foucault 1997, 278–279). For Thoreau, it was\nthe work of a lifetime to cultivate one’s receptivity to the\nbeauty of the universe. Believing that “the perception of beauty\nis a moral test” (Journal, 6/21/52), Thoreau frequently\nchastises himself or humanity in general for failing in this respect.\n“How much of beauty—of color, as well as form—on\nwhich our eyes daily rest goes unperceived by us,” he laments\n(Journal, 8/1/60); and he worries that “Nature has no\nhuman inhabitant who appreciates her” (Walden, IX).\nNoticing that his sensory awareness has grown less acute since the\ntime of his youth, he speculates that “the child plucks its\nfirst flower with an insight into its beauty and significance which\nthe subsequent botanist never retains” (Journal,\n7/16/51 & 2/5/52). In order to attain a clear and truthful view of\nthings, we must refine all the faculties of our embodied\nconsciousness, and become emotionally attuned to all the concrete\nfeatures of the place in which we are located. We fully know only\nthose facts that are “warm, moist, incarnated,” and\npalpably felt: “A man has not seen a thing who has not felt\nit” (Journal, 2/23/60). In this way, Thoreau outlines\nan epistemological task that will occupy him for the rest of his life;\nnamely, to cultivate a way of attending to things that will allow them\nto be experienced as elements of a meaningful world. \nSince our ability to appreciate the significance of phenomena is so\neasily dulled, it requires a certain discipline in order to become and\nremain a reliable knower of the world. Like Aristotle, Thoreau\nbelieves that the perception of truth “produces a pleasurable\nsensation”; and he adds that a “healthy and refined nature\nwould always derive pleasure from the landscape”\n(Journal, 9/24/54 & 6/27/52). Nature will reward the most\ncareful attention paid by a person who is appropriately disposed, but\nthere is only “as much beauty visible to us in the landscape as\nwe are prepared to appreciate,—not a grain more. The actual\nobjects which one person will see from a particular hilltop are just\nas different from those which another will see as the persons are\ndifferent” (Journal, 11/4/58). One who is in the right\nstate to be capable of giving a “poetic and lively\ndescription” of things will find himself “in a living and\nbeautiful world” (Journal, 10/13/60 & 12/31/59).\nBeauty, like color, does not lie only in the eye of the beholder:\nflowers, for example, are indeed beautiful and brightly colored.\nNevertheless, beauty—and color, for that matter—can exist\nonly where there is a beholder to perceive it (Journal,\n6/15/52 & 1/21/38). From his experience in the field making\nobservations of natural phenomena, Thoreau gained the insight\n“that he, the supposedly neutral observer, was always and\nunavoidably in the center of the observation” (McGregor 1997,\n113). Because all perception of objects has a subjective aspect, the\nworld can be defined as a sphere centered around each conscious\nperceiver: wherever we are located, “the universe is built\naround us, and we are central still” (Journal,\n8/24/41). This does not mean that we are trapped inside of our own\nconsciousness; rather, the point is that it is only through the lens\nof our own subjectivity that we have access to the external world. \nWhat we are able to perceive, then, depends not only upon where we are\nphysically situated: it is also contingent upon who we are and what we\nvalue, or how our attention is focused. “Objects are concealed\nfrom our view, not so much because they are out of the course of our\nvisual ray as because we do not bring our minds and eyes to bear on\nthem…. A man sees only what concerns him”\n(“Autumnal Tints”). In other words, there is “no\nsuch thing as pure objective observation. Your observation,\nto be interesting, i.e. to be significant, must be\nsubjective” (Journal, 5/6/54). Subjectivity is\nnot an obstacle to truth, according to Thoreau. After all, he says,\n“the truest description, and that by which another living man\ncan most readily recognize a flower, is the unmeasured and eloquent\none which the sight of it inspires” (Journal,\n10/13/60). A true account of the world must do justice to all the\nfamiliar properties of objects that the human mind is capable of\nperceiving. Whether this could be done by a scientific description is\na vexing question for Thoreau, and one about which he shows\nconsiderable ambivalence. One of his concerns is that the scientist\n“discovers no world for the mind of man with all its faculties\nto inhabit”; by contrast, there is “more humanity”\nin “the unscientific man’s knowledge,” since the\nlatter can explain how certain facts pertain to life\n(Journal, 9/5/51, 2/13/52). He accuses the naturalist of\nfailing to understand color, much less beauty, and asks: “What\nsort of science is that which enriches the understanding, but robs the\nimagination?” (Journal, 10/5/61 & 12/25/51) For\nThoreau, the most reliable observer is one who can “see things\nas they are, grand and beautiful” (Journal,\n1/7/57)—in other words, the beauty and grandeur of the world\nreally are there to be seen, even if we are not always capable of\nseeing them. We can easily fail to perceive the value of being if we\ndo not approach the world with the appropriate kind of emotional\ncomportment.  \nThoreau sometimes characterizes science as an ideal discipline that\nwill enrich our knowledge and experience: “The true man of\nscience will know nature better by his finer organization; he will\nsmell, taste, see, hear, feel, better than other men. His will be a\ndeeper and finer experience” (“Natural History of\nMassachusetts”). He observes that scientific terminology can\nprovide the means of apprehending something that we had utterly missed\nuntil we had a name for it (see Walls 2012, 108). Yet he also gives\nvoice to the fear that by weighing and measuring things and collecting\nquantitative data he may actually be narrowing his vision. The\nscientist “studies nature as a dead language,” and would\nrather study a dead fish preserved in a jar than a living one in its\nnative element (Journal, 5/10/53 & 11/30/58). In these\nsame journal entries, Thoreau claims that he seeks to experience the\nsignificance of nature, and that “the beauty of the fish”\nis what is most worthy of being measured. On the other hand, when he\nfinds a dead fish in the water, he brings it home to weigh and\nmeasure, covering several pages with his statistical findings\n(Journal, 8/20/54). This is only one of many examples of\nThoreau’s fascination with data-gathering, and yet he repeatedly\nquestions its value, as if he does not know what to make of his own\npenchant for naturalistic research. At the very least, scientific\ninvestigations run the risk of being “trivial and petty,”\nso perhaps what one should do is “learn science and then forget\nit” (Journal, 1/21/53 & 4/22/52). But Thoreau is\nmore deeply troubled by the possibility that “science is\ninhuman,” since objects “seen with a microscope begin to\nbe insignificant,” and this is “not the means of acquiring\ntrue knowledge” (Journal, 5/1/59 & 5/28/54).\nOverall, his position is not that a mystical or imaginative awareness\nof the world is incompatible with knowledge of measurable facts, but\nthat an exclusive focus on the latter would blind us to whatever\naspects of reality fall outside the scope of our measurement. \nOne thing we can learn from all of Thoreau’s comments on\nscientific inquiry is that he cares very much about the following\nquestion: what can we know about the world, and how are we able to\nknow it? Although he admires the precision of scientific information,\nhe wonders if what it delivers is always bound to be “something\nless than the vague poetic” (Journal, 1/5/50). In\nprinciple, a naturalistic approach to reality should be able to\ncapture its beauty and significance; in practice, however, it may be\n“impossible for the same person to see things from the\npoet’s point of view and that of the man of science”\n(Journal, 2/18/52). In that case, the best we can do is try\nto convey our intimations of the truth about the universe, even if\nthis means venturing far beyond claims that are positivistically\nverifiable: “I desire to speak somewhere without\nbounds; like a man in his waking moment, to men in their waking\nmoments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate enough even to\nlay the foundation of a true expression… . The words which\nexpress our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant\nand fragrant like frankincense to superior natures”\n(Walden, XVIII). We should not arbitrarily limit our\nawareness to that which can be described with mathematical exactitude:\nperhaps the highest knowledge available to us, Thoreau suggests,\nconsists in “a sudden revelation of the insufficiency of all\nthat we called Knowledge before … it is the lighting up of the\nmist by the sun” (“Walking”). And perhaps this is\nnot a regrettable fact: “At the same time that we are earnest to\nexplore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious\nand unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and\nunfathomed by us because unfathomable” (Walden, XVII).\nBy acknowledging the limits of what we can know with certainty, we\nopen ourselves up to a wider horizon of experience. \nAs one commentator points out, Thoreau’s categories—so to\nspeak—are dynamic, since they are constantly being redefined by\nwhat we perceive, even as they shape our way of seeing (Peck 1990,\n84–85). Every now and then “something will occur which my\nphilosophy has not dreamed of,” Thoreau says, which demonstrates\nthat the “boundaries of the actual are no more fixed and rigid\nthan the elasticity of our imaginations” (Journal,\n5/31/53). Since the thoughts of each knowing subject are “part\nof the meaning of the world,” it is legitimate to ask:\n“Who can say what is? He can only say how he\nsees” (11/4/52 & 12/2/46). Truth is radically\nperspective-dependent, which means that insofar as we are different\npeople we can only be expected to perceive different worlds (Walls\n1995, 213). Thoreau’s position might be described as\nperspectival realism, since he does not conclude that truth is\nrelative but celebrates the diversity of the multifaceted reality that\neach of us knows in his own distinctive way. “How novel and\noriginal must be each new man’s view of the universe!” he\nexclaims; “How sweet is the perception of a new natural\nfact,” for it suggests to us “what worlds remain to be\nunveiled” (Journal, 4/2/52 & 4/19/52). We may never\ncomprehend the intimate relation between a significant fact and the\nperceiver who appreciates it, but we should trust that it is not in\nvain to view nature with “humane affections”\n(Journal, 2/20/57 & 6/30/52). With respect to any given\nphenomenon, the “point of interest” that concerns us lies\nneither in the coolly independent object nor in the subject alone, but\nsomewhere in between (Journal, 11/5/57). Witnessing the rise\nof positivism and its ideal of complete objectivity, Thoreau attempts\n“to preserve an enchanted world and to place the passionate\nobserver in the center of his or her universe” (Tauber 2001,\n20). It is an admirable goal, and one that remains quite relevant in\nthe philosophical climate of the present day. \nThoreau’s ethic of personal flourishing is focused upon the\nproblem of how to align one’s daily life in accordance with\none’s ultimate ideals. What was enthusiasm in the youth, he\nargues, must become temperament in the mature person: the “mere\nvision is little compared with the steady corresponding endeavor\nthitherward” (Journal, 11/1/51 & 11/24/57). Much of\nour time ought to be spent “in carrying out deliberately and\nfaithfully the hundred little purposes which every man’s genius\nmust have suggested to him… . The wisely conscious life springs\nout of an unconscious suggestion” (Wild Fruits, 166).\nCharacter, then, can be defined as “genius\nsettled”—the promptings of conscience in themselves are\nonly potentially moral, until we have integrated them into\nthe fabric of our everyday existence and begun to hold ourselves\nresponsible for living up to them (Journal, 3/2/42). Hence,\nwe need to cherish and nurture our capability to discern the\ndifference between the idea and the reality, between what is\nand what ought to be. It is when we experience\ndissatisfaction with ourselves or with external circumstances that we\nare stimulated to act in the interest of making things better. \nIt follows that the greatest compliment we can pay to another person\nis to say that he or she enhances our life by inciting us to realize\nour highest aspirations. So Thoreau views it as deplorable that\n“we may love and not elevate one another”; the “love\nthat takes us as it finds us, degrades us” (“Chastity and\nSensuality”). He speaks of “love” and\n“friendship” as closely related terms which are tainted by\nthe “trivial dualism” which assumes that the one must\nexclude the other (Journal, undated 1839 entry). Clearly,\nwhat he is concerned about is the kind of love the Greeks called\nphilia—and in his sustained consideration of\nfriendship, as in so many other respects, Thoreau is “squarely\nin the virtue ethics tradition” (Cafaro 2004, 127). In his\nethical writings, the notion of wishing good on behalf of another\nperson is often taken to a severe extreme, as if he does not think it\npossible to ask too much of love and friendship. In A Week on the\nConcord and Merrimack Rivers, he says: “I value and trust\nthose who love and praise my aspiration rather than my\nperformance” (A Week, “Wednesday”). This is\nfair enough, but Thoreau may be going too far when he proclaims that a\nfriend should be approached “with sacred love and awe,”\nand that we profane one another if we do not always meet on religious\nterms; it is no wonder that he finds himself doubting whether his\n“idea of a friend” will ever actually be instantiated\n(Journal, 6/26/40). Nonetheless, as a recent interpreter of\nThoreau has pointed out, the “exalted and rarefied ideal”\nof friendship that he upholds does not imply that a friend is merely\ninstrumental to one’s own self-realization (see Hodder 2010,\n129–142). Above all, Thoreau’s discussion of love and\nfriendship provokes us to reflect upon what we can and cannot expect\nfrom our closest human relationships, and on their role in a good\nlife. \nIt would be a mistake to consider Thoreau’s political views in\nisolation from other aspects of his thought. It is, for example, his\nunderstanding of wild nature that informs his sociopolitical ideas. As\nwas noted above, nature is a point of reference outside the\npolis which can provide valuable moral guidance, reminding us\nthat society is not the measure of all things. Considering the human\nbeing as “an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature,”\nrather than a cultural artifact merely (“Walking”), he\nlooks to the nonhuman natural world and to our inherent\n“wildness” as a source of evaluation which can empower us\nto discover that the standards of our civilization are profoundly\nflawed. His conviction that nature provides us with “a\ndifferent, truer, and more significant moral reality” than what\nwe find in society provides the “crucial and often overlooked\npolitical core” to what has been called his “pastoral\nenvironmentalism” (Taylor 1992, 12-24). Withdrawing into the\nnatural world allows us to view the state in a broader context and to\nconceive of ways in which social values and political structures could\nbe improved radically. This includes unjust laws that ought to be\nreformed, about which more will be said in a moment, as well as the\nunwritten rules embodied in prevailing expectations about how one\nought to live and what matters. Anticipating Heidegger’s critique of\nDas Man in section 27 of Being and Time, Thoreau\ndescribes the source of these culturally prevalent attitudes as the\n“They” (Walden, I; see also Bennett 1994, 18-19)\nand is critical of their pervasive and corrupting influence, their way\nof making people content with distorted values. For instance, most of\nhis fellow citizens of Massachusetts are able to greet each other\npolitely on the street and in church, thinking of themselves as\nmorally decent while remaining complacent to uphold and perpetuate the\ninstitution of slavery in America (see “Slavery in\nMassachusetts” and “A Plea for Captain John Brown”).\nIn denouncing a specific pernicious attitude that is widespread among\nhis contemporaries, Thoreau also seeks to identify and analyze the\ngeneral tendency it exemplifies to defer to public opinion: for this\nreason, his project of social critique is not only relevant to his\nparochial context but has universal implications. He is acutely\nconscious of the threat that shared modes of discourse can pose to\nauthentic intersubjectivity. \nThoreau is only half-joking when he tells us that, after becoming\nfrustrated with society, he turned “more exclusively than ever\nto the woods, where I was better known” (Walden, I).\nNot only is it true that a degree of solitude and distance from our\nneighbors may actually improve our relations with them, but by moving\naway from the center of town we liberate ourselves from a slavish\nadherence to prevailing attitudes. “The greater part of what my\nneighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad,” he claims,\nproviding this kind of example: “If a man walk in the woods for\nlove of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a\nloafer; but if he spends his whole day as a speculator, shearing off\nthose woods and making earth bald before her time, he is esteemed an\nindustrious and enterprising citizen” (Walden, I and\n“Life Without Principle”). This warped sense of value is\nall too common amidst the desperation of modern life, with its\n“restless, nervous, bustling, trivial” activity\n(Walden, XVIII). Thoreau builds a critique of American\nculture upon his conviction that “the mind can be permanently\nprofaned by the habit of attending to trivial things, so that all our\nthoughts shall be tinged with triviality” (“Life Without\nPrinciple”): his polemic aims at consumerism, philistinism, mass\nentertainment, vacuous applications of technology, and the herd\nmentality that conforms to the dictates of an anonymous\n“They.” During his life Thoreau spoke out against the\nMexican War and the subjugation of Native America, and campaigned\naggressively in favor of bioregionalism and the protection of animals\nand the natural environment. (It is outrageous that he is often\nstereotyped as a lifelong recluse and hermit.) Above all, the\npolitical issue that aroused his indignation more than any other was\nslavery. Because Thoreau understood philosophy as a way of life, it is\nonly fitting that philosophical ideals would lead him into political\naction. \nHe was an activist involved in the abolitionist movement on many\nfronts: he participated in the Underground Railroad, protested against\nthe Fugitive Slave Law, and gave support to John Brown and his party.\nMost importantly perhaps, he provides a justification for principled\nrevolt and a method of nonviolent resistance, both of which would have\na considerable influence on revolutionary movements in the twentieth\ncentury. In his essay on “Civil Disobedience,” originally\npublished as “Resistance to Civil Government,” Thoreau\ndefends the validity of conscientious objection to unjust laws, which\nhe claims ought to be transgressed at once. Political institutions as\nsuch are regarded by him with distrust, and although he arguably\noverestimates the extent to which it is possible to disassociate\noneself from them, he convincingly insists that social consensus is\nnot a guarantee of rectitude or truth. One of the most valuable points\nhe makes against the critics of John Brown is that a person should not\nbe dismissed as “insane” by virtue of dissenting from the\nmajority: Brown’s anger is grounded upon an awareness of the fact\nthat slavery is a violation of human rights, and Thoreau berates the\nlaw-abiding citizens of Massachusetts for looking the other way\n(“A Plea for Captain John Brown”). Passively and quietly\nallowing an unjust practice to continue is tantamount to collaborating\nwith evil, he claims, articulating a principle of noncompliance that\nwould inspire the philosophically informed nonviolent resistance of\nGandhi and Martin Luther King, among others. \nWhen Thoreau argues that all of Brown’s actions were justified\nbecause he was an inspired reformer with a sacred vocation,\nhe is appealing to something like the notion of natural right. His\nessay in this respect has a more general pertinence to debates about\nthe individual moral reformer in relation to community norms. It also\nraises the issue of whether political violence can be justified as the\nlesser of evils, or in cases where it may be the only available way of\nending injustice. Usually, he prefers nonviolent forms of advocacy\nsuch as creating “counter friction to stop the machine” by\nopposing, and acting in defiance of, practices and laws that are not\nrighteous (“Civil Disobedience”). Speaking about the act\nof protest that led him to spend a night in jail, he expresses\ncharacteristic irony by saying that “I might have resisted\nforcibly with more or less effect, might have run amok against\nsociety; but I preferred that society should run amok against me, it\nbeing the desperate party” (Walden, VIII). Although at\ntimes it sounds as though Thoreau is advocating anarchy, what he\ndemands is a better government, and what he refuses to\nacknowledge is the authority of one that has become so morally corrupt\nas to lose the consent of those governed. “There will never be a\nreally free and enlightened State, ” he argues, “until the\nState comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent\npower, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and\ntreats him accordingly” (“Civil Disobedience”).\nThere are simply more sacred laws to obey than the laws of society,\nand a just government—should there ever be such a thing, he\nadds—would not be in conflict with the conscience of the\nethically upright individual. \nThoreau has somewhat misleadingly been classified as a New England\ntranscendentalist, and—even though he never rejected this\nlabel—it does not fit in many ways. Some of his major\ndifferences from Emerson have already been discussed, and further\ndifferences appear when Thoreau is compared to such figures as Orestes\nBrownson, Margaret Fuller, and Bronson Alcott. A history of\ntranscendentalism in New England which appeared in the late nineteenth\ncentury mentions Thoreau only once, in passing (Frothingham 1886,\n133). And a more recent history of the movement concludes that Thoreau\nhad little in common with this group of thinkers, who were for the\nmost part committed to some version of Christianity, to a dualistic\nunderstanding of mind and matter, and to the related idea that sense\nexperience is unreliable (Boller 1974, 29–35 & 176). A\ncrucial step in Thoreau’s intellectual development occurred when\nhe “disassociated himself from Emerson’s Transcendentalist\nview of nature as symbol” (Slicer 2013, 181), as a current\nscholar notes. It was suggested above that a better way of situating\nThoreau within the Western philosophical tradition is to consider him\na kind of transcendental idealist, in the spirit of Kant. For reasons\nthat ought to be obvious by now, he should be of interest to students\nof Kant, Fichte, and Schelling—all of whom he studied at first\nor second hand—and possibly Schopenhauer. Thoreau was a capable\nand enthusiastic classicist, whose study of ancient Greek and Roman\nauthors convinced him that philosophy ought to be a lived practice:\nfor this reason, he can profitably be grouped with other\nnineteenth-century thinkers, such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, who\nwere critics of philosophy in the early modern period. Yet he also has\nthe distinction of being among the first Western philosophers to be\nsignificantly influenced by ancient Chinese and Indian thought. He\nanticipates Bergson and Merleau-Ponty in his attention to the dynamics\nof the embodied mind, and shares with Peirce and James a concern for\nproblems of knowledge as they arise within practical experience.  \nContemporary philosophers are increasingly discovering how much\nThoreau has to teach—especially, in the areas of knowledge and\nperception, and in ethical debates about the value of land and life.\nHis affinities with the pragmatic and phenomenological traditions, and\nthe enormous resources he offers for environmental philosophy, have\nalso started to receive more attention—and Walden\nitself continues to be encountered by readers as a remarkable\nprovocation to philosophical thought. Still, it remains true that the\npolitical aspect of Thoreau’s philosophy has come closer to\nreceiving its due than any of these others: whether or not this is\nbecause such prominent figures as Gandhi and Martin Luther King cited\nThoreau as an inspiration, it has resulted in a disproportionate focus\non what is only one part of an integral philosophy, a part that can\nhardly be understood in isolation from the others. Even if it is a\nsign of Thoreau’s peculiar greatness that subsequent American\nphilosophy has not known what to make of him, it is a shame if his\nexclusion from the mainstream philosophical canon has kept his voice\nfrom being heard by some of those who might be in a position to\nappreciate it. Then again, as Thoreau himself notes, it is never too\nlate to give up our prejudices. Others have observed (see Slicer 2013,\n182–183) that, based on the amount of prominent work on Thoreau\nas a philosopher which has recently appeared, his profile seems to be\never so gradually rising on the American philosophical landscape.","contact.mail":"rfurtak@coloradocollege.edu","contact.domain":"coloradocollege.edu"}]
