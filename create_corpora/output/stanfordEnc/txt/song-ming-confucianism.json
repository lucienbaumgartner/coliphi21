Many anthologies and histories of Chinese\nphilosophy treat the Song-Ming period as second only to the classical,\npre-Qin period in terms of its importance and influence on Confucian\nthought, with its two leading philosophers Zhu Xi (1130–1200)\nand Wang Yangming (1472–1529) doing the most to shape the\ntradition as we know it today. Most studies of this period focus on\nConfucians in the first and last of these dynasties, the Song and\nMing. There were several notable Confucian philosophers in the middle\nYuan dynasty as well, and the Yuan was also important for bringing\nstate support and institutional backing to the orthodoxy of the Song\nphilosopher Zhu Xi (Chen 2010: 241–274). But scholars tend to\nrefer to Confucians of this period as “Song-Ming\nConfucians”, emphasizing the two most philosophically important\ndynasties and perhaps downplaying the relatively short-lived middle\ndynasty under Mongol rule.\n\n\nThe prominent figures in Song-Ming Confucianism held divergent and\noften mutually inconsistent views about each of the major issues of\ntheir era, but they participated in a shared discourse with a great\ndeal of overlapping philosophical vocabulary and points of reference.\nMoreover they tended to treat certain issues as more central than\nothers. Chief among these were questions about the sources of unity\nand order in the cosmos, moral aspects of human nature, how\none’s subjective thoughts and feelings can and should align with\n(objective or less problematically subject-dependent) ethical norms,\nthe methods and means of cultivating virtues, and the sort of\ninstitutions and character necessary for good governance. There were\nsome areas of consensus. Confucians of this period tended to agree\nthat the family is in various respects the primary locus of moral\ndevelopment and the expression of virtue. They also shared the view\nthat human nature is fundamentally good, having well-formed capacities\nfor virtue and being linked in some profound way to broader processes\nof life production and nurturance. Most regarded a certain body of\nclassical Confucian texts as correct, including those they attributed\nto Confucius (Kongzi) and Mencius (Mengzi), although how much and in\nwhat ways one should defer to the authority of these texts was often\ncontested.\n\nMost of the leading Confucian thinkers in the Song, Yuan, and Ming\ndynasties are now described in English as Neo-Confucians, using a term\nof somewhat ambiguous scope and significance. In the broadest sense,\n“Neo-Confucian” refers to a thinker and practitioner of\nthe Tang dynasty (618–907) or later who identified with and\nworked to revive Confucian values, beliefs, and practices after the\nrise of Buddhism in China. Construed more narrowly,\n“Neo-Confucian” refers to a subset of the above thinkers\nthat belonged or traced much of their philosophical origins to an\nimportant group of Confucians in the 11th century. This\ngroup included Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), Zhang Zai\n(1020–1077), and on some accounts Shao Yong (1011–1077),\nbut the philosophers who loomed largest among them were the brothers\nCheng Hao (1032–1085) and Cheng Yi (1033–1107). The Cheng\nbrothers were most influential of this group, having explicated the\nmetaphysics and techniques of mental discipline that they took to be\nimplicit in Confucian texts and thereby positioning Confucianism as a\ndirect and more formidable rival to Buddhism. Many of the\nNeo-Confucians who saw themselves as building on the tradition of the\nCheng brothers identified with a movement known in Chinese as\nDaoxue 道學, “The Learning of the\nWay”, whose goal at the movement’s inception was to shift\nthe emphasis of formal education away from literary attainments and\nrefocus it on the moral Way (Dao 道) (Bol 2008). With a\nfew notable exceptions in the late Ming dynasty, nearly all of the\nleading Confucian thinkers in the Song-Ming period were Neo-Confucians\nin both the broader and narrower senses: they sought to reestablish\nConfucianism after many generations of neglect; they saw learning the\nmoral Way as the central aim of a proper education; and they were\neither in the 11th century group that included the Cheng\nbrothers or identified with the Chengs’ lineage and\nteachings. \nMost (but not all) of these philosophers saw Confucianism as being in\ncompetition with its popular rivals, Buddhism and Daoism. They thought\ncore Confucian doctrines and practices incompatible with Buddhism and\nDaoism and regarded the latter two traditions as having an overall\ndetrimental effect on Chinese society, accounting to a great extent\nfor what they saw as a general decline in moral character and the\ndissolution of family and other social bonds. Even as the prominent\nSong-Ming Confucians sought to distinguish Confucianism from its\nrivals, however, the conceptual schemes and much of the philosophical\nvocabulary that they used were drawn from a broader philosophical and\nreligious discourse in which Buddhist and Daoist ideas and terms were\nubiquitous. Framing Confucian views in such terms helped to give them\nwidespread respectability and currency among learned people.\nFurthermore, many of the influential Song-Ming Confucians dabbled in\nBuddhism before coming to align themselves with Confucianism.\nConsequently, the break from Buddhism and Daoism was not as clean as\nmany believed, and it is useful to look not just at what they rejected\nbut also at what they quietly and (mostly) inadvertently adopted from\ntheir rivals.  \nAlthough the Neo-Confucians took Buddhism and Daoism to be different\ntraditions calling for different critiques, they nevertheless tended\nto see both as sharing some common defects. Perhaps the most\nfar-reaching defect was that, as most Song-Ming Neo-Confucians saw it,\nBuddhists and Daoists thought personal liberation from suffering\nshould take precedence over other aims and values, and believed they\ncould only achieve this by extricating themselves from worldly\nentanglements, especially from human relationships and attachments to\nothers (JSL 13.3–4, 13.14). They argued that putting\nliberation from one’s own suffering before other values is\nselfish (si 私), motivated by personal gain\n(li 利), and can be construed as endorsing a form of\nnormative egoism (HNCSYS 1:3; JSL 13.1, 13.4, 13.6).\nFurthermore, by insisting on eliminating the desires and attachments\nrequired for human relationships, Buddhists and Daoists sacrificed\nimportant goods for the sake of transcendent ones, giving up their\nmore obvious, this-worldly interests for more speculative ones whose\nattainment often depends on unsubstantiated theories of the afterlife\n(as for Buddhist nirvana or Daoist theories of immortality)\n(JSL 13.8, 13.10; HNCSYS 3:66, 22A:292; Graham 1992:\n90–91). \nTo charge Buddhists with selfishness and egoism might appear to\noverlook some well-known features of Buddhist thought. The Buddhist\nEightfold Path includes duties to help others and prohibitions against\nharming others. The path of the bodhisattva in Mahāyāna\nBuddhism includes a long, perhaps indefinite period in which the\nbodhisattva embodies and practices great compassion (daci\n大慈) and commits to ending the suffering of all sentient\nlife before entering nirvana herself or himself. Neo-Confucians were\nwell aware of these aspects of Chinese Buddhism, so a charitable and\nhistorically informed reading of their criticisms should be more\nnuanced. One better way of understanding the charge of selfishness is\nthat it describes what motivates most ordinary Buddhist practitioners\nin fact, not what motivates idealized practitioners in principle\n(HNCSYS 1:3; JSL 13.6). This would be a natural\nconsequence of the fact that the Buddhist route to other-directed\nconcern is considerably more demanding than the Confucian one, as care\nfor others is more easily attained through ordinary interactions with\nfamily and members of one’s community than through radical\nnonattachment (Lu 1980: 16–21; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014:\n257–260). Another variant of the Neo-Confucian criticism is to\nsuggest that subordinating ethics to soteriology has problematic\nimplications. If all norms, including ethical ones, are justified to a\nsignificant degree by their contribution to one’s own quest to\nend personal suffering, this will give a different shape to very\nnotion of goodness. Practices like donating to Buddhist shrines and\nmaintaining a Buddhist diet can potentially be conceived as\n“good” (shan 善) without essential\nreference to improving other people’s lives or participating\nably in human relationships (ZZYL 126:3033, Tiwald 2018a:\n134–37). \nSome Song-Ming Neo-Confucians also objected to what they saw as\nnaïve Buddhist and Daoist views about how best to gain control\nover unruly intentions and feelings, leaning too heavily on meditative\npractice to solve problems better addressed through a combination of\nstudy, reflection, and the cultivation of respect or reverence\n(JSL 13.6; ZZYL 126:3019; Tiwald 2018a:\n141–147). Finally, there was relatively widespread agreement\namong Confucians of this era that Buddhist metaphysics had gotten\nsomething fundamentally wrong about the ultimate nature of things.\nBuddhists in China often emphasized what they called the emptiness or\nvoidness (kong 空) of all phenomenal things, which\nNeo-Confucians took to mean that such things are illusory and without\nvalue. This in turn was supposed to explain why Buddhists aimed to\ntranscend the phenomenal world, for nothing of value could be gained\nby rearranging illusions (Fu 1986; JSL 13.12). In point of\nfact, this characterization elides many of the subtleties and variants\nof the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness, which Buddhists saw as\nconsistent with caring about and acting to mitigate the phenomenal\nsuffering of phenomenal entities. The influential Song Neo-Confucian\nZhu Xi acknowledged as much, but seems to have believed that the\ntransparently problematic conception of emptiness was the operative\none in most Buddhist practices (ZZYL 126:3013; Cai 2009:\n204–206; Fu 1986; Tiwald 2018a: 147–154). \nNevertheless and without question, there are prominent and fundamental\nviews in Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism that bear the marks of Buddhist\nand Daoist influence. One is the Neo-Confucian account of the goodness\nof human nature. Many of the major Neo-Confucians of this period\nendorsed the view that the ethical predispositions in human nature are\nwell-formed from birth, so that a great deal of the work of\ncultivating virtue was primarily a matter of recovering and\neliminating the obstructions that prevent us from accessing that\nnature, especially selfish or self-centered desires and the various\nbad habits and biases that they present (Ivanhoe 2000). These\nphilosophers took themselves to be expounding a doctrine of human\nnature found in the Mencius, but in fact Mencius seems to\nhave thought that “human nature is good”\n(xingshan 性善) is true by virtue of the fact\nthat human beings have a natural capacity or potential to\nbecome good, not that they are innately good or have\nwell-formed ethical predispositions right from the start\n(Mencius 6A6, 6A8). A more likely source for the idea that we\nhave well-formed predispositions innately is Chinese Buddhism, which\nhad long held that humans (and all sentient beings) have at all times\na kind of buddha-nature (foxing 佛性) or\nbuddha-womb (in Sanskrit, tathāgatagarbha; in Chinese,\nrulai zang 如來藏) with fully-formed\npropensities to respond perfectly to its circumstances. Here too the\nwell-formed nature is to be recovered or discovered by removing\nobstacles, which for Buddhists were seen as false and adventitious\nconceptualizations of things. Neo-Confucians even used or adapted many\nof the metaphors that Buddhists had long used to describe the\ncircumstances in which our perfect nature becomes blocked, likening it\nto a pearl suspended in muddy water or a mirror covered with dust\n(Jorgensen 2018: 73–86; Z. Liu 2003). \nDaoxue Confucians also adopted a technical term that had, by\ntheir time, long been used in Buddhist metaphysics to account for the\nultimate nature and unity of things. This term was li\n理 (Pattern, Principle), which the Buddhists sometimes\ncharacterized as emptiness and Neo-Confucians described as (or as a\nsource or ground of) ceaseless life-generativity (sheng sheng bu\nxi 生生不息), understood as a system in\nwhich birth, growth, and procreation work in harmony to maintain the\ncontinuity of living things. Here again the Neo-Confucians took\nthemselves to be elucidating an idea that they found in classical\nConfucian texts, but in fact there was very little mention of\nli in the classical canon, and even less that could plausibly\nbe read as having the same metaphysical sense as the Neo-Confucians\nproposed (Dai 2009: 265–286; Ivanhoe 2002: 46–58; Makeham\n2003b: 193–195). Other notable influences from both Buddhism and\nDaoism were a greater interest in meditation (Chan 1989:\n255–270; Cai 2009: 195–197; Yang 2015) and a tendency to\nsee self-abnegation or the elimination of desires as a major aim of\nself-cultivation. Some Neo-Confucians saw themselves as embracing a\nwider array of desires than their Daoist and Buddhist counterparts,\nbut due in large part to the influence of Zhu Xi, many cut a\nrelatively sharp distinction between what they saw as permissible\ndesires consistent with the Pattern of ceaseless life-generativity and\nthe impermissible desires as selfish ones (Chan 1989: 197–211).\nIn so doing they ruled out a wider swath of desires than the classical\nConfucians probably intended (Tiwald 2012: 30–33). Add to these\ninfluences a wide array of shared conceptual frameworks, technical\nterms, and philosophical problematics and Song-Ming articulations of\nConfucianism become very difficult to disentangle from longstanding\nBuddhist and Daoist ways of thinking (Angle 2018; Araki 2008; Ivanhoe,\n2002; Makeham 2018a; Ziporyn 2018).  \nFor much of the Song-Ming period, Confucian thought and textual\nstudies were a significant part of the lives of most adult males who\nhad a formal education. Those who wanted a career in government\nservice were required to memorize and produce learned essays on the\nConfucian classics for their civil service exams, and scholarly\ndiscourse was replete with discussions of and allusions to Confucian\nthought. The Song-Ming period was thus a particularly vibrant one for\nConfucian philosophy. Two of the earliest intellectual histories of\nthis period describe the lives and thought of more than two thousand\nConfucians who played some significant role in shaping the tradition\n(SYXA; MRXA). What follows is a brief description of\nthe philosophers who loom largest. In most cases these are the\nthinkers who had the greatest influence on Neo-Confucianism, although\nwe will also see some who, while less influential historically, now\nattract a great deal of scholarly interest for their originality or\nsophistication. \nThe philosophers often treated as founding figures of Neo-Confucianism\nare a group that lived in a period that came to be called the Northern\nSong (960–1127). This includes Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), who\nproduced a diagram and supplementary exposition that characterizes all\nphenomena as being governed by Taiji 太極\n(variously translated as the Great Ultimate, Supreme Polarity, or the\nSupreme Pivot), a kind of ordering principle that explains the natural\nfluctuations of yin and yang or stillness and\nactivity (Adler 2014). Another founding figure was Zhang Zai\n(1020–1077). Zhang developed influential ways of thinking about\nhuman nature and the cultivation of virtue, ones that account for\nvariations of character in terms of varying qualities of qi\n氣 (psychophysical energy, vital stuff). He also developed a\nmetaphysics that conceived of individuals as part of a cosmic whole,\nrelated by nature to all other things as though members of a family or\nparts of the same body, and thus having family-like obligations to\ncare for all others. One of his brief but stirring encapsulations of\nthis view became perhaps the most famous inspirational essay in the\nNeo-Confucian tradition, called “The Western Inscription”\nas it had been written on the western wall of his study (Tiwald &\nVan Norden 2014: 134–136). \nAt the center of this Northern Song group were the brothers Cheng Hao\n(1032–1085) and Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who studied with\nboth Zhou and Zhang but developed their own systems of thought that\ncame to be reflected in almost every area of Neo-Confucianism. The\nChengs offered different metaphysical frameworks to account for Zhang\nZai’s conception of all things as parts of a family-like or\nbody-like whole, developed a sophisticated, multi-faceted moral\npsychology of the major virtues, honed Confucian objections to\nBuddhism and Daoism, and advanced distinctive theories of proper\ngovernance and administration (Graham 1992; Ivanhoe 2016: 24–48;\nTiwald & Van Norden 2014: 140–167). Some scholars also add\nto these four Northern Song Confucians a fifth founding figure, Shao\nYong (1011–1077), best known for developing mathematical and\nnumerological laws and maintaining that certain kinds of human\nsubjectivity are incompatible with knowledge of things (Birdwhistell\n1989; Wyatt 1996). Shao was also personally acquainted and dialogued\nwith the Cheng brothers, although compared with the Chengs his\nwritings show little direct concern with developing theories about\nvirtue and personal cultivation. What became the most widely read\nanthology of the founders of Song Confucianism, a kind of textbook\ncalled Reflections on Things at Hand, omitted Shao in favor\nof the other four Northern Song masters (JSL). Three of these\nNorthern Song thinkers—Zhang Zai, Cheng Hao, and Cheng\nYi—were at times heavily involved in politics and became\nassociated with the opposition to the famous minister and reformer\nWang Anshi (1021–1086). \nBy far the most influential Neo-Confucian philosopher is Zhu Xi\n(1130–1200). Zhu came to Confucianism after a little more than a\ndecade of study of and experimentation with Daoism and Chan (Zen)\nBuddhism. Like many other prominent Confucian thinkers of his era, he\nwas a great admirer of the Cheng brothers and took himself to be\nbuilding on the exegetical and theoretical foundations that they had\nlaid, although he occasionally registered disagreements with some of\ntheir remarks. In his day Zhu was just one among many prominent\nthinkers and teachers who claimed the mantle of the Cheng brothers,\nbut by the end of the Song he came to be seen as the most\nauthoritative spokesperson not just for the Chengs but for the entire\nDaoxue (Learning of the Way) tradition. His interpretation of\nthe Confucian canon became the basis of the civil service examination\nin 1313, so that over time it was closely read by many millions of\naspiring civil servants and students of Confucianism. Consequently,\nZhu’s interpretation of the Confucian tradition has been treated\nby countless Confucians as orthodoxy, and continues to be so regarded\nby many adherents of Confucianism today. \nThere were few contemporary areas of inquiry that Zhu Xi did not\ntouch. He made more explicit than any predecesor a certain\nmetaphysical dualism of qi (vital stuff) and li\n(Pattern), which he then used to explain everything from human nature\nto the natural inclinations of plants to the acquisition of moral\nknowledge. He thought carefully and wrote extensively about methods of\ncultivating virtue, defending distinctive views both on big-picture\nissues like the role of speculation and book learning and on\nfiner-grained matters such the purpose of doing chores and the proper\nattitude to adopt when reading. He also wrote at length about\npolitics, history, and the art of administration and government\nservice (Zhu 2019). \nAfter Zhu Xi, the second most influential Neo-Confucian philosopher is\nWang Yangming (1472–1529). Wang spent his early years studying\nBuddhism and Daoism but eventually became an articulate and\ncharismatic defender of Confucianism, one whose ideas and practices\nwere honed over the course of an extraordinary career as a civil\nadministrator and military general. By Wang’s time Zhu\nXi’s views had become deeply embedded in the customs and\ninstitutions responsible for formal education, and Wang was trained in\nand well acquainted with those views. But Wang broke with orthodoxy on\nsome fundamental issues, most notably on the role of personal\nexperience and intuition in ethical cultivation and an alternative\nmetaphysics that made the heartmind a constituent of the Patterns\n(li) that are the source of order and virtue. A guiding\nconcern that ran through many of his objections had to do with the\nnature of moral knowledge or knowing, which he believed to be\nintrinsically related to the motivation to act, much as the desire to\navoid a foul odor is intrinsically related to the understanding that\nthe odor is foul. This had implications for the model of ethical\ncultivation which he promoted, which was to build on the immediate\nconcerns and experiences of individuals rather than overly academic or\nscholastic study on topics well removed from their daily lives\n(Ivanhoe 2009: 99–184). \nWang also proposed that people have an innate faculty of moral\nunderstanding that he called liangzhi 良知, most\nliterally translated as “pure knowledge” or “good\nknowledge” but sometimes more loosely translated as\n“innate knowledge” or “conscience”. If people\nfail to be virtuous, he proposed, this is because they are unable to\naccess or recognize the deliverances of good knowledge due to\ninterference by selfish desires, which arise from self-centered\nattachments and ways of thinking. This teaching, combined with his\nworries about forms of study that are too far removed from personal\nexperience, conferred a somewhat ambiguous status on the longstanding\nConfucian practice of reading and reflecting on the Confucian\nclassics, for it is not entirely clear why grasping ideas and accounts\nof events well removed from one’s own life should help to access\nor complement good knowledge (Ivanhoe 2002: 123–134). This and\nother ambiguities in Wang’s teachings left considerable room for\ndebate among the subsequent generations of his disciples and followers\n(Peng 2003). \nLater historians also noticed a number of striking resonances between\nWang’s views and an earlier Neo-Confucian named Lu Xiangshan\n(1139–1193), who also spoke and wrote about a faculty of good\nknowledge and regarded the heartmind as a constituent of li\n(Pattern) (Ivanhoe 2009: 29–97). Because of the similarities\nbetween Lu and Wang, which in certain respect mirror similarities\nbetween Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi, it is customary among many scholars of\nChinese philosophy to refer to two schools of thought in the Song-Ming\nperiod—the Cheng-Zhu school sometimes associated with the\n“Learning of Pattern” (Lixue 理學)\nand the Lu-Wang school often associated with the “Learning of\nHeartmind” (Xinxue 心學). This way of\ncharacterizing the two most influential poles of Neo-Confucian thought\nprovides an historical lens through which many 20th and\n21st century Confucian thinkers understand their own\nphilosophical orientation and roots. \nA group of thinkers that was frequently disparaged by many mainstream\nNeo-Confucians was the “Taizhou school” of Confucianism,\nnamed after the place in which its purported founder, Wang Gen\n(1483–1541), lived and taught. Although the philosophers most\noften identified with this school were an eclectic bunch, pedagogical\nconnections to Wang Gen and some similarities in ideology and\nscholarly temperament make it convenient to group these thinkers\ntogether. Wang Gen and many of his disciples were distinguished by\ntheir commitment to the popularization of Confucianism. Wang Gen\nhimself had studied with Wang Yangming and took seriously the idea\nthat all people have innate capacities for moral knowledge and\nsagehood, capacities which, on his interpretation, do not depend on\nformal education and book learning to be accessed. Sagehood could be\nrealized through the “everyday practices of the common\npeople” (baixing riyong\n百姓日用) and it was the mission of many\nTaizhou thinkers to bring this about. Taizhou Confucians also brooked\nmore dramatic departures from Confucian orthodoxy and tended to see\ngreater consonance between Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism\n(Peterson 1998: 723–732, 745–754; de Bary 1970:\n157–171; MRXA 32.1a–7b). \nIn addition to Wang Gen, other notable philosophers associated with\nthis school were Luo Rufang (1515–1588) and Li Zhi\n(1527–1602). Both thought the most authentic and reliably good\nexpressions of our innate moral capacities were to be found in\npre-socialized expressions of the heartmind, which Luo termed the\n“infant heartmind” and Li called the “child\nheartmind”. Li also maintained that the expressions of the child\nheartmind could be idiosyncratic, so that moral expectations and the\nshape of moral virtues would resist generalization to a much greater\nextent than most Confucians usually allowed (P. Lee 2012, 58–64;\nMRXA 34.3a–b, 34.16b–17a; Tiwald & Van Norden\n2014: 304–307). Luo and Li are now admired for defending\nwomen’s education, in part on the grounds of having equal\ncapacity for virtue and wisdom. Luo proposed that women were more\nreliably virtuous than men and played the more fundamental and\nconsequential role in the cultivation of virtue (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 172–179; Cheng 2001: 103–117; Tiwald & Van\nNorden 2014: 297–304). \nOther than the Northern Song Neo-Confucians described in\n section 2.1,\n every philosopher mentioned heretofore has been a Neo-Confucian in\nthe narrow sense associated with Daoxue (see\n section 1\n on the differences between the broad and narrow senses of\n“Neo-Confucian”). That is, each has been someone who takes\nmost of his cues from the Cheng brothers, most notably by adopting\ntheir robustly metaphysical accounts of human nature and the\nfundamental unity or oneness of things. But philosophers of this sort\ndid not have a monopoly on Confucian discourse, and over the course of\nthe roughly seven centuries of Song, Yuan, and Ming thought there were\na number of talented and innovative Confucian philosophers at the\nborders or outside of these mainstreams. \nA once-influential but now somewhat neglected set of philosophers in\nthe Song dynasty are often associated with what is called the\n“Yongjia school” of Confucianism, named after the county\nin which some of its most prominent thinkers lived and taught at\nvarious points in their lives. The Yongjia Confucians had roots in the\nteachings of the Cheng brothers and Daoxue, but with the\npassage of time some of the leading thinkers came to see themselves as\nopponents of that tradition, in part because of their impatience with\nspeculative metaphysics and their more practical orientation toward\nissues of governance and administration. Two of the most distinguished\nConfucians aligned with Yongjia were Chen Liang (1143–1194) and\nYe Shi (1150–1223), both contemporaries and occasional\ninterlocutors of Zhu Xi. Chen and Ye tended to measure public policies\nand moral practices in terms of their contributions to public welfare\nor general social benefit (li 利), a tendency that\neventually led some 20th and 21st century\nhistorians to characterize Chen and Ye as “utilitarian”\nthinkers (Qi 1982: 1178–1187; Tillman 1982; Xiao 1982: 539). For\nboth Chen and Ye, the rightness and desirability of a particular\npractice was determined by its consequences and not (or at least not\ndirectly) the agents’ motives and character. Chen and Ye also\nargued against accounts of the Way (Dao) that posited it as a\ntimeless, abstract entity independent of concrete affairs and\ncircumstances (Niu 1998; Tillman 1982). \nAnother maverick Confucian of this period was Wang Tingxiang\n(1474–1544). In opposition to the metaphysical dualists of his\ntime, Wang proposed that the ordinary features and behaviors of\nqi (vital stuff) could account for everything in the cosmos,\nincluding the sources of order and creation that mainstream\nNeo-Confucians tended to identify with irreducible li\n(Patterns) (Ong 2006; Y. Liu 2000: 55–85). He also rejected the\nfundamental unity and oneness of the universe and—still more\nastonishingly—denied that a comprehensive unity was even\ndesirable (Kim 2008; Ong 2006). And Wang furthermore took the\ndecidedly unorthodox view that goodness and the predispositions for\nvirtue aren’t necessary features of human nature, suggesting\ninstead that the moral emotions that people often cited as evidence of\nnatural goodness, such as moral shame, are primarily responsive to\nsocial norms and expectations (Ong 2006: 474). In taking this position\nhe defied a centuries-old Confucian consensus about human nature that\nwas rarely contradicted in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. \nPerhaps the most fertile period for those who worked at the periphery\nof the main lines of Neo-Confucianism was five or six decades that\nspanned the collapse of the Ming and the consolidation of the Qing\ndynasty, roughly 1640 to 1700. Although this was a time of instability\nin some parts of China, it nevertheless witnessed declining faith in\nlongstanding political customs as well as budding movements in\nConfucian scholarship that paved the way for more dramatic departures\nfrom orthodoxy. One such movement was the rise of “evidential\nstudies” (kaozheng xue 考證學),\nunderstood as approaches to scholarship that lean more heavily on\nareas of study like astronomy, geography, mathematics, and especially\nphilology. A leading scholar of evidential studies was Gu Yanwu\n(1613–1682), who established a reputation not just as a\nprecocious philologist but also as a creative political reformer\n(Angle 2002: 89–93; Brown 2011; Gu 2017). Another remarkably\noriginal and prolific philosopher was Wang Fuzhi (1619–1692),\nwho reconceived all of Neo-Confucian metaphysics and moral psychology,\nworking against the prevailing dualism of li and qi\nand developing an account of the virtues that made considerably more\nroom for human desires and emotions (J. Liu 2010, 2018: 157–179,\n265–284; Cheng 1991). A third was Huang Zongxi\n(1610–1695), who wrote comprehensive intellectual histories of\nthe Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties and offered some of the most\nradical political reforms ever put forward by a traditional Confucian\nthinker, contending that scholars and ministers be permitted to\ncriticize their ruler openly and proposing that a variety of\nprocedural requirements be imposed on the deliberation and\ndecision-making of the emperor (SYXA; MRXA; MYDFL; de Bary\n2011). All of these philosophers (and especially Huang) completed\nsignificant portions of their work in the early years of the Qing\ndynasty, but they were products of the distinctive intellectual and\nsocial circumstances witnessed at the end of the Ming, when Confucian\nthinkers started to consider political reforms in earnest and began to\ndoubt a great deal of what had, for centuries, passed for obvious\ntruths about the Confucian canon. \nOne of the most notable differences between classical Confucianism and\nNeo-Confucianism in the Song-Ming period is the prominence of\nmetaphysical speculation in the latter. Many Daoxue\nConfucians believed that providing an adequate account of the world\nrequired that we posit the existence of some things that are formless\n(xing er shang 形而上) and not readily\napparent, the existence of which poses philosophical challenges. Most\nnotably, these Confucians thought we needed something they called\nPattern (li, also translated as “principle”) to\naccount for order, unity, and the nature and content of the virtues.\nThey also thought that Pattern is closely linked to human nature, and\nthey were interested in explaining how human cognitive and emotional\nfaculties—what they called the heartmind (xin 心,\nsometimes translated more simply as “heart” or as\n“mind”)—can come to recognize and respond\nappropriately to Pattern. \nMost Confucians in the Song-Ming period believed that all phenomenal\nthings and events are constituted of qi, a kind of vital,\nenergetic material. But many doubted that qi alone could\naccount for everything of significance about the phenomenal world. The\nworld has a certain unity and order that they saw as highly valuable,\nevident in things such as the natural behaviors of plants and animals,\nand the way that seasons work cooperatively with living things (and\nwith one another) to sustain and reproduce life. And human beings have\ncertain capacities to understand and contribute to the order and unity\nof things, capacities that seem to be part of our natural endowment.\nMany Neo-Confucians thought that some further explanatory principle or\nground was needed to account for this order, unity, and the natural\ncapacities that help us make sense of them, and for this they appealed\nto the notion of Pattern (li). \nThe Chinese character translated here as “Pattern” is\nli, a term that appeared relatively rarely in classical\nConfucian texts but became ubiquitous in philosophical discourse well\nbefore the Song, by which time it was often used to refer to what\nmight be called the underlying reality or ultimate nature of things.\nFor many Buddhists, a thing’s Pattern was its inherent\n“emptiness”, which is to say, roughly, its lack of any\nintrinsic phenomenal qualities or essences. For Buddhists this helped\nto justify the view that phenomenal qualities or essences are\nillusory, merely conventional, or conferred by the larger whole. Most\nSong-Ming Neo-Confucians rejected this view. They agreed that all\nthings have an underlying Pattern, but this Pattern is what they\ncalled ceaseless life-production or ceaseless life-generativity, not\nemptiness. And furthermore, this is a Pattern that all things share,\nso that they belong to a unified system of ceaseless\nlife-generativity. So it is in the ultimate nature of things to\nparticipate in and contribute to these systems, which are\ncharacterized by birth, growth, and reproduction. Paradigmatic models\nof Pattern can be found in the cycles of birth, growth, and\nreproduction evident in the change of seasons, or the way that birth,\ngrowth, and reproduction serve as the central aims or the organizing\nprinciples of families. \nMany Daoxue Confucians thought that Pattern can do certain\nexplanatory work that qi cannot. Pattern explains why boats\ncan only travel by water and carts only by land. Pattern explains why\nchildren are naturally inclined to love and serve their parents, and\nwhy things made of qi alternate between yin\n(passive) and yang (active) phases or states. And Pattern\nalso has normative implications, accounting not just for\nchildren’s tendency to love and serve their parents, but also\nfor the fact that it’s proper and virtuous for them to do so.\nMost recognized that these sorts of facts had much to do with the\nconstituent qi in things as well, and a minority among the\nSong-Ming Confucians (e.g., Zhang Zai, Wang Tingxiang, and Wang Fuzhi)\naimed to show that the features and tendencies of qi could\nfully explain some or all such facts (Kasoff 1984; Y. Liu 2000; Angle\n& Tiwald 2017: 36–38). But most thought that Pattern has\nsome independent role in accounting for them, some explanatory power\nnot strictly reducible to that of qi. Zhu Xi’s theories\nabout the relationship of Pattern to qi changed over the\ncourse of his life, but on his mature and most influential view,\nPattern is independent of qi in at least two senses. First,\nZhu says that there is a sense in which Pattern is “prior”\nto qi. He makes clear that this is not a sort of temporal\npriority—it is not that Pattern exists first and then\nqi arises subsequently—but when we try to infer back to\nthe origin or basis of things we should treat Pattern as prior or more\nfundamental (ZZYL 1:3). The specific implications of this are\na matter of some speculation (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 38–40;\nChen 1987: 3–29). A second sort of independence of Pattern is\nthat it functions as a kind of director or “master”\n(zhu 主 or zai 宰) of qi. Zhu\nis careful to say that it does not intervene in affairs or directly\nact on qi, but it establishes rules which qi then\nfollows of its own power (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 40–42). \nBy the start of the Song dynasty, the Chinese character xing\n性, which is usually translated as “nature” or\n“the nature”, had long been used to refer to important\nfeatures of people and things that play a major role in defining what\nthey are and determining how they ought to be. For much of the history\nof Confucian thought before the Song there had been a wide-ranging and\ngenerally unresolved debate about the moral character of human nature\nin particular, with Mencius famously arguing that human nature is\ngood, Xunzi (c. 310–c. 221 BCE) contending that it is bad, and\nothers defending various moderate and hybrid views (Tiwald 2016:\n437–440). By the end of the 11th century, however, a\nconsensus formed around a strong interpretation of the doctrine that\npeople are good by nature, according to which people have well-formed\nmoral dispositions and sensitivities innately and permanently. Cheng\nYi developed the most influential formulation of this view. According\nto Cheng, humans necessarily have a good nature because humans\nnecessarily have Pattern (li), which includes the tendencies\ntoward life-generativity that all things share, and this Pattern is an\nessential and important feature of ourselves, determinative of what we\nare and how we ought to be. Cheng and later Neo-Confucians took his\ninterpretation to be implicit in the works of the authoritative\nclassical Confucians, especially Mencius, but it is evident that their\ninterpretation was more radical than what Mencius in fact thought.\nMencius is most plausibly read as endorsing the view that we are born\nwith strong proclivities or sprouts of goodness which, if we are\nprovided with a healthy upbringing, will naturally develop into\nvirtues, and his primary concern was with the nature of humans in\nparticular, not the nature of all living things (Mencius 2A6,\n6A1–6, 6A8). Cheng Yi and most of the notable Neo-Confucians\nafter him, however, thought we had well-formed dispositions and\nsensitivities right from the start, that these are ineradicable\nfeatures of us, and that they are in fact universally shared, so that\nthe nature in us is essentially the same as the nature in all things\n(Ivanhoe 2016: 36–48; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 159,\n166). \nBy locating our good nature in Pattern, however, Cheng Yi introduced\nnew philosophical challenges. His view assumes that all human beings\nhave Pattern at all times, and yet it is obvious that few if any human\nbeings are good at all times, so there must be some way of explaining\nthe pervasiveness of human moral failure. Furthermore, Pattern is\nshared by all beings, human or otherwise, so the nature that we\nidentify with Pattern cannot by itself suffice to distinguish us from\nnon-human things. Cheng’s response in brief was to posit a\nsecond sort of nature consisting of one’s endowment of\nqi, sometimes called the “material nature” or\n“the nature of one’s qi-constitution”\n(qizhi zhi xing 氣質之性). The nature\nthat he identified with Pattern he called by various names, including\n“inherent nature” or “original nature”\n(benxing 本性), referring to our nature as it is\nwhen not distorted or altered by external stimuli, prior to the\narousal of occurrent emotions. Both moral failure and differences in\nspecies or kind can be traced to differences in one’s\nqi-constitution. If human beings sometimes fail to be good\nand virtuous it is because of dark or turbid qi which\nprevents Pattern from expressing itself or responding correctly, and\ndark and turbid qi is ubiquitous. The configuration and\nquality of qi which constitutes a thing also determines the\nparticular type or species it is (Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 166).\nThis was a view that Zhu Xi came to both refine and popularize in his\nown writings and teachings (Ivanhoe 2000: 45–49; Tiwald &\nVan Norden 2014: 170–178). But Zhu was reluctant to say that we\nliterally have two separate natures, recommending instead that we have\nonly one nature that can be described in different terms, as\n“inherent nature” when considered in terms of its\nintrinsic structure and as “material nature” when\nconsidering in terms of its interactions with qi (Angle &\nTiwald 2017: 64–67). \nXin “heartmind” is the locus of both thoughts and\nemotions as well as the faculty responsible for directing them\nproperly. Confucians in the Song-Ming period took a great deal of\nphilosophical interest in the nature, characteristics, and function of\nthe heartmind, explications of which could help to identify and\nspecify features of moral and epistemic virtues. One of the most\ncontentious issues, however, had to do with the relation between\nheartmind and Pattern. \nIn broad brushstrokes, we could say that there are two clusters of\nphilosophical concerns at work in much Confucian discussion of the\nrelation between heartmind and Pattern in this era. First, many\nConfucians worried about developing systems of ethical norms too far\nremoved from our actual psychological dispositions. So, for example,\nthey criticized Mohists for their view that one should treat the\nwelfare of all people as having an equal claim on them, no matter\ntheir relationship to oneself (e.g., whether a parent or a stranger),\narguing that the ideal was so far removed from our natural tendencies\nas to be impossible (JSL 2.89, 13.2; CXL 93). Our\nethical norms, they suggested, should be ones that we have a certain\nnatural capacity to understand and embrace. A major reason for this is\nwhat has been called the “wholeheartedness criterion” for\nvirtue: if someone has fully instantiated a particular virtue, it must\nbe the case that the person embraces it completely and without any\nreluctance or countervailing desires (Tiwald 2018b: 179–183).\nSomeone who cares for others grudgingly or with some reluctance cannot\nbe fully humane or benevolent (ren 仁), for example.\nMany Confucians in the Song through Ming thought that the virtues\nworthy of our esteem were only those that we could potentially embrace\nin a wholehearted fashion, achieving a state sometimes called\n“sincerity” (cheng 誠) by the Cheng\nbrothers and those who followed them (JSL 1.3;\nHNCSYS 6:92). By making the possibility of wholeheartedness a\ncondition for esteeming something as a virtue, they tied their ethics\neven more closely to the heartmind that we happen to have. It is\ndifficult enough to adopt practices that go against the grain of our\nnatural dispositions. It is even more difficult to embrace them and\nenact them without reservation or regret. \nGiven the strong emphasis on wholeheartedness and the need to fully\nembrace the ethical norms that many Song-Ming Confucians promoted,\nsome saw advantages in views that closely identified heartmind with\nPattern. If a particular practice or character trait (e.g., filial\npiety) is correct by virtue of being a manifestation or expression of\nPattern, and that practice or character trait is to be one that we\ncould embrace wholeheartedly and naturally, we can explain how Pattern\nand our wholehearted potential converge by saying that Pattern shares\na common source with or is even constituted by our heartminds. Several\nConfucian philosophers made this idea explicit. The most famous\nadvocates for seeing heartmind as constitutive of Pattern are Lu\nXiangshan and Wang Yangming, both of whom are often characterized as\nbelonging to a special lineage or school of thought known as\n“Heartmind Learning” (Xinxue). Lu and Wang\nadopted this understanding of Pattern in part because they saw it as\nputting Confucian ethical norms within reach of people in their\nordinary lives, and criticized more scholarly or bookish methods of\ngrasping the Confucian Way, which they worried would never become\nsufficiently intuitive to embrace wholeheartedly or sincerely (Ivanhoe\n2009). Even more radical views were developed by the so-called Taizhou\nConfucians like Wang Gen, Luo Rufang, and Li Zhi, who thought that the\nConfucian way should be so accessible to ordinary heartminds as to be\nintuitive even to people with little education or formal Confucian\ntraining (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 86–87, 106–108).  \nBut there was a second set of concerns that tended to push against the\ntemptation to say that heartmind is a constituent of Pattern. This had\nto do with the pernicious implications of subjectivist accounts of\nethical norms. By the start of the Song, many of China’s\nlaypeople adopted practices from Chan Buddhism (better known in the\nWest as Zen Buddhism) and much of the intelligentsia were interested\nin Chan ideas. Chinese Buddhists in general took an interest in the\nways that features of the seemingly objective world were actually\ndependent on (and constituted by) the minds or heartminds of subjects\n(DSQXL 575c-579c). And some Chan Buddhists openly embraced a\nway of life that seemed to countenance subjective whims or\ninclinations (Gregory 2002). This, at least, was a worry about\nBuddhism shared by Confucians in the Song-Ming period. Cheng Yi\nsuccinctly described the difference between Buddhist and Confucian\nethics by suggesting that the former “based themselves on the\nheartmind” whereas Confucians “based themselves on\nHeaven” (Tian, the cosmos, the objective order)\n(HNCSYS 21b:274). Accordingly, it become something of a\ncommonplace for some Confucians to accuse others of being too\nBuddhist, by which they often meant that the latter (more Buddhist)\nConfucians failed to establish standards of assessment sufficiently\nindependent of subjective whim (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 72–88).\nThis is a complaint that Zhu Xi often made about his contemporary Lu\nXiangshan (ZZYL 104:2619–20, 124:2975–76; Zhu\n2019: 148–150). Zhu preferred ways of characterizing the\nrelation between heartmind and Pattern according to which the latter\nwas largely independent of the former, and was careful to distinguish\nbetween phases or states of heartmind that appropriately tracked and\nreflected Pattern (called “the heartmind of the Way”,\nDaoxin 道心) and phases or states in which the\nheartmind imposed its own selfish or private desires and inclinations\n(called “the human heartmind”, renxin\n人心). In making this distinction he followed Cheng Yi and\ntook himself to be in direct opposition to Lu Xiangshan (Angle &\nTiwald 2017: 83–86). \nFor many of the Confucians who wrote in the Song-Ming period, the most\nimportant test of a philosophical system was whether it could provide\nor justify a good account of self-cultivation. It was widely accepted\nthat most people were lacking in virtue. Debates about Pattern,\nqi, heartmind, and the foundations of ethics were often\ntreated as being important insofar as they had implications for how we\nought to improve ourselves (Ivanhoe 2016: 22–23). \nMost Confucians took the Confucian canon to be authoritative and true.\nTexts like the Analects, the Mencius, and the\nRites were required reading for any aspiring scholar and\nConfucians often appealed to these texts to substantiate their claims.\nBut modern readers are sometimes surprised to learn that there was\nsome debate about whether and to what extent reading the Confucian\nclassics was required for proper self-development (Ivanhoe 2000). On\nthe one hand, it seemed obvious to many Confucians that many people\nhad the wrong views and the authoritative Confucian texts seemed the\nmost obvious way to correct those views. On the other hand, some\nConfucians of this era worried that knowledge acquired from books\ncouldn’t be obtained and internalized in ways required for\nwholehearted virtue (see\n section 3.3).\n Moreover, most agreed that we have well-formed ethical capacities by\nnature\n (section 3.2).\n Accordingly, philosophers like Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming thought\nwe could rely more on our own intuitions or deeply-felt moral insights\nthat come from daily life, and that these were often preferable to the\nmore fragmentary and abstract types of study connected to book\nlearning (CXL 49; Ivanhoe 2002: 77–80; Ivanhoe 2009:\n34–39; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 243–245). In\ncontrast, Zhu Xi worried that intuitions were too unreliable, that we\nare too predisposed to rationalize or find clever ways of\ncountenancing self-serving inclinations and judgments, and thought\nreading authoritative Confucian texts with an open mind and\nreverential attention a good way to check our self-serving biases\n(Angle & Tiwald 2017: 151–155; Chu 1990: 128–162;\nZZYL 10–11). \nConfucians in the Song-Ming period adopted from the Mencius a\ngeneral framework for the acquisition of ethical knowledge, according\nto which there are certain paradigm scenarios or cases (e.g., when\nseeing a child about to fall into a well or when food is given with\ncontempt) that elicit reliably good or virtuous responses, but many\nother cases which do not. As Mencius describes his goal there, the\ngoal is to “extend” (tui 推) or expand the\nreliable ethical judgments and emotional responses from those paradigm\nscenarios to the new ones (Mencius 2A6, 6A10). In the\nMencius that is done in part by noticing relevant\nsimilarities between cases, as when one sees that accepting a bribe\nfor a special favor is self-debasing and shameful in ways similar to\naccepting food given with contempt, or the treatment due to seniors in\ngeneral is similar to the respect we already give to our own elders\n(Mencius 1A7, 6A10; Van Norden 2007: 234–246).\nConfucians in the Song through Ming tend to characterize the\nacquisition of new moral knowledge similarly, often invoking the\nMencian notion of “extension”. Zhu Xi adds that we acquire\nnew moral knowledge in part by seeing how a rule or norm to which we\nshould conform fits into a larger system of norms that sustain a\nsystem of mutual life-generativity (a system in which life, growth,\nand reproduction are ongoing and reciprocal). This is part of what he\ndescribes as discerning the “reasons why it is so”\n(suoyi ran zhi gu 所以然之故),\nand is necessary for a deeper understanding of rules or norms that we\notherwise take on faith or confidence in the tradition (ZZYL\n18:625; Angle & Tiwald 2017: 122–129). \nSong-Ming Confucians were also interested in different kinds or types\nof knowledge. One oft-discussed distinction was between mere\n“ordinary knowledge” (changzhi 常知)\nand “genuine” or “true knowledge”\n(zhenzhi 真知). Ordinary knowledge is often\nportrayed as merely a correct and reliably informed affirmation that\nsomething is true or right, while genuine knowledge often requires\nsome personal acquaintance with the matter, and necessarily issues in\n(or is constituted by) some appropriate feeling and motivation. In one\ninfluential discussion, Cheng Yi illustrates the distinction by\ndescribing two different sorts of reactions to news that a tiger was\nattacking people in the vicinity. Some villagers were startled but did\nnot have the powerful, almost involuntary fear of the one farmer who\nhad been wounded by a tiger in the past. Cheng suggests that ethical\nknowledge should have the same character as the survivor’s fear\n(HNCSYS 2a:16, 15:147; Graham 1992: 80). Wang Yangming later\nused this rough framework to argue for his famous thesis that\nknowledge and action are united (Chen 1991: 93–98; Ivanhoe 2000:\n62–66; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 266–268). \nMany Confucians in the Daoxue (“Learning of the\nWay”) tradition also distinguished between “sensory\nknowledge” (wenjian zhi zhi\n聞見之知) and the sort of knowledge that\nconcerns or can be attributed to our virtuous nature (dexing zhi\nzhi 德性之知). These were distinguished\nin various ways by influential Daoxue Confucians. Zhang Zai\nthought that in the case of sensory knowledge, knowers always conceive\nthe object of knowledge as external and separate from themselves,\nwhereas in the latter sort of knowledge the knower and known are\nunited. Zhang believed that sensory knowledge was both fallible and\ninsufficient for many purposes (especially ethical purposes) but\nallowed that sensory knowledge is necessary as a means of acquiring\nknowledge of the virtuous nature, and perhaps also as providing\nwarrants or justifications for the latter sort of knowledge\n(ZM 7:24–25; Angle & Tiwald 2017: 112–114;\nZuo 2019). The Cheng brothers adamantly opposed the view that\nknowledge of the virtuous nature “depends on” sensory\nknowledge (HNCSYS 25:317). But they seemed to think that this\npertained to certain kinds of dependence and not others, because they\ncontinued to recommend that people read texts and undertake\ninvestigations of external things and affairs (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 115–116). Some of the Cheng brothers’ immediate\ndisciples entertained more explicitly innatist views of proper\nknowledge of the virtuous nature, suggesting that we find it solely\nthrough inward reflection and meditation (Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n216–217). But Zhu Xi thought innate intuitions were unreliable\nand thus politely declined to make any hard-and-fast distinctions\nbetween the two kinds of knowledge (Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n117–119). Zhu did, however, continue to think that the most\ntransformative and motivational knowledge is in some sense knowledge\nof our own (virtuous) nature, whatever external means we may use to\nacquire it (ZZYL 10:161; Zhu 2019: 29). \nDue in part to the influence of Buddhism, Confucians in the Song-Ming\nperiod were interested in the many ways in which subtle or\nhard-to-detect psychological dispositions and phenomena can hamper our\nability to apprehend things clearly and correctly. Some thought that\nmost or all instances of moral failure could be credited to an\ninflated sense of one’s own importance or self-centeredness\n(si), which manifests in selfish inclinations or desires that\nthen lead us astray (Shun 2010: 185–187). Confucians in this era\nthus developed and argued about various techniques meant to help us\ndetect and undercut selfish inclinations and desires, and other\ntechniques which (much like Buddhist meditation) help quiet the mind\nso that it can respond to the world with more evenhandedness and\nequanimity. \nThe first set of techniques were concerned with detecting and\neradicating selfish thoughts or inclinations, a task they sometimes\ncharacterized as (or as part of) “overcoming the self”\n(keji 克己). Many emphasized that it was most\nadvantageous to look for these thoughts and inclinations in liminal\nmoments of emotional incipience (ji 機), just as\nemotions are starting to enter consciousness but before they start to\nreshape other mental processes and dispositions (Smith et al. 1990:\n190–199; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 282). Most Confucians in\nthe Song-Ming period endorsed this sort of self-monitoring, although\nsome seemed to think that it played a more important role in\nself-cultivation than others. Wang Yangming was among those who\nthought it central and indispensable for the work of improving\none’s character and state of heartmind, sometimes saying that\nour selfish inclinations needed to be pursued like robbers and\nthoroughly eradicated (CXL 39, 60, 279). In contrast, Zhu Xi\nsaw self-monitoring as important but as somewhat less pervasively\ndemanding than Wang. On his view, much of the work of self-monitoring\nbecomes unnecessary if we fully realize or embody reverential\nattention (jing 敬). Zhu likened the work of overcoming\nthe self to taking medicine for an illness: when one is in good health\n(instantiating proper reverential attention in all that one thinks\nabout) then taking medicine (self-monitoring) is unnecessary\n(ZZYL 9:151–52; Angle & Tiwald 2017: 146). \nSome Confucian debate in the Song-Ming period concerned the role of\nmeditation in achieving mental stability and insight. The most popular\nform for Confucians was known as “quiet sitting”\n(jingzuo 靜坐), which many recommended as a way\nto achieve a state of quietude or tranquility (jing\n靜). Some Daoxue Confucians thought that we discover\nour virtuous inherent nature when the heartmind is in this state of\ntranquility, a view most notably held by Yang Shi (1053–1135), a\nstudent of the Cheng brothers. Zhu Xi rejected this conception of\nmeditation’s role in self-cultivation, maintaining that we\ncannot experience or perceive our virtuous nature directly but only\nindirectly through its responses to worldly events, requiring a state\nof activity and responsiveness which isn’t meditative (Angle\n& Tiwald 2017: 147–149). Nevertheless, Zhu thought quiet\nsitting played important supporting roles in developing one’s\ncapacities of mental discipline. He believed it an important\ncomplement to study and reflection and suggested that for some people\nwith particularly unruly heartminds it could be the most productive\npath to self-improvement (Chan 1989: 255–270). \nAnother objection to over-reliance on meditation was that it would\nleave its practitioners ill-equipped to handle the demands of active\nlife, which (unlike quiet sitting) regularly tests our ability to\nmaintain control of our feelings in the face of provocations. Feelings\non the Confucian view should be both proportionate and responsive to\nthe correct events (for example, we should react with moderate anger\ntoward the moderate mistreatment of a friend and not react with fury\nto a minor, personal slight). For these purposes, Confucians suggested\nthat reverential attention (jing 敬) is better suited\nto instill the right sort of self-control, one that they thought we\ncould use in both passive and active states. Zhu Xi described\nreverential attention both as a kind of concentration or focus and as\nan attitude showing respect and humility, and thus capable of putting\nprivate concerns in proper perspective and keeping selfish desires in\ncheck. He also recommended using reverential attention when reading\ntexts for ethical and philosophical insight (ZZYL 12; Chu\n1990: 170–179; Zhu 2019: 28–32 and 49). \nIn the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Confucians were interested in\nthe nature and psychological structure of virtues, particularly the\nvirtues concerned with fostering and upholding good human\nrelationships. They saw their emphasis on the virtues of human\nrelationships as distinguishing them from Daoists and Buddhists,\ninsofar as the latter two groups tended to promote a concern with\npersonal salvation (which struck some Confucians as slighting moral\nvirtue) and with non-attachment (which many saw as incompatible with\nhaving meaningful human relationships). \nThere is a relatively strong consensus in this period that five\nvirtues are most important, both in terms of the scope of human\nactivity that they should regulate and in terms of their contribution\nto the virtuous person’s moral quality. The “Five Constant\nVirtues” or “Five Constants” (Wuchang\n五常) were humaneness (ren 仁, sometimes\ntranslated as “benevolence” or “Goodness”),\nrighteousness (yi 義), ritual propriety (li\n禮, sometimes simply “propriety”), wisdom\n(zhi 智), and faithfulness (xin 信). The\nConfucians of this period often called attention to ways in which\nthese particular virtues overlap, such that a person could not\ninstantiate one without instantiating another (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 164–165). But they still tended to think of four of those\nvirtues as having certain paradigmatic domains or situations where\nthey were most manifest. Paradigm cases of humaneness are those in\nwhich one acts out of love or care to promote the interests of others,\nas when one helps or looks after a family member. Many Daoxue\nConfucians also describe this virtue movingly as one of “forming\none body” with other people or with the cosmos more generally,\nwhich in turn requires that we see ourselves as extensions of others\nand vice-versa (Ivanhoe 2018: 58–73; Tiwald & Van Norden\n2014: 140–141). Paradigm cases of righteousness are those in\nwhich someone refuses to violate prohibitions that would rightly be\nregarded as degrading or shameful, as when refusing an otherwise\ntempting bribe. Sometimes righteousness just has to do with ensuring a\njust distribution of goods according to merit or position. Clear cases\nof ritual propriety are those in which one performs a ritual with\nreverence. The Chinese character for “ritual” (li\n禮), however, is of much broader scope than its English\nequivalent, covering nearly every social protocol which should be\nperformed with a sense of respect, from weddings and funerals to\ngreetings (e.g., bowing) and serving food and drink. Paradigm cases of\nwisdom include such things as understanding the other virtues (their\ncharacteristic motives and feelings), correctly assessing the quality\nof a person’s character (when choosing someone for an important\npost, for example), and knowing the best means by which to achieve\nvirtuous ends. The fifth virtue, faithfulness, is best understood as\nthe virtue of being committed to and guided by reality in a consistent\nand reliable way. Some Confucians were careful to say that the virtue\nin this fundamental sense does not have its own paradigmatic domain of\nactivity—it regulates and supports all of the virtues, insofar\nthey all require us to being attentive to what’s real and\navoiding self-serving illusions that would otherwise get us off the\nhook (BXZY 47–82; Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n160–163; Fuji 2011: 28–31). \nA potential source of confusion arises from the fact that humaneness\nis sometimes used in a more fundamental and all-encompassing sense,\nwhere it refers not to the virtue of loving or caring about the\nwelfare of others, but to the virtue of harmonizing with or fitting\ninto a larger system of mutual life-generativity, understood as\ncorrectly participating in a system in which each person’s life\ncontributes appropriately to the life of others (BXZY 70;\nAngle & Tiwald 2017: 162–163). Humaneness in this more\nfundamental sense does not necessarily need to be motivated by love or\ncare—one can exhibit the virtue of harmonizing with the larger\nwhole even while acting out of a sense of shame (as righteousness\nrequires), or reverence (as ritual propriety requires). But there is a\nsense in which we exhibit the virtue of mutual life-generativity even\nwhen acting righteously or ritually proper. On an interpretation\nsuggested by Zhu Xi, this is because all of the other virtues can be\nseen as getting their purpose and value from their part in\ncontributing to mutual life-generativity, much as the life-production\nof the springtime gives purpose and value to the summer, autumn, and\nwinter (ZZYL 20:694; Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n166–167). \nThroughout the Song-Ming period, mastery of Confucian texts was\nrequired for the civil service exams and thus for most appointments to\nstate office. Confucianism had also long enjoyed a special prestige\namong bureaucrats and state officials, being seen by many as offering\nthe best training for the skills and ethical demands of governance.\nAccordingly, many of the major Confucian philosophers and their\ninterlocutors had experience with and were keenly interested in\nadministration and state affairs. Most Confucians conceived of their\nobligations to the state as pulling in two directions: they saw\nloyalty to the hereditary monarchy as mandatory in most major\nrespects, but they also regarded it as their duty to share the benefit\nof their ethical guidance and sound judgment with the emperor and\nauthorities at every level. On one relatively prevalent understanding\nof that role, to both serve the emperor and provide him with ethical\nmoorings was the highest form of loyalty, for it helped to sustain the\nrule and further consolidate its legitimacy as a successor regime to\nthe Confucian sage-kings of old. At times, however, many Song-Ming\nConfucians lost confidence in the emperor and his court and sought to\npromote more decentralized forms of government with local and\nnon-state institutions taking on a larger role (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 181–189). \nOne of the oft-revisited debates in the Song-Ming period had to do\nwith the difficult matter of regional governance. By the start of the\nSong, regions outside the capital had been governed for many centuries\nby a relatively centralized and meritocratic system known as the\n“commandery system” (junxian 郡縣).\nAccording to the rules of this system, regional governors were to be\nselected from among those who had performed very well on the civil\nservice exams, and they were appointed at the discretion of the\nemperor or his court. There were also restrictions that were meant to\nprevent governors from developing stronger loyalties to their local\ncommunities than the emperor. For example, governors were required to\nswitch posts on a regular basis and were not appointed to districts\nthat included their home towns. \nMany Song-Ming Confucians recognized that the commandery system was\ntoo well entrenched to jettison without major conflict or upheaval.\nStill, this did not prevent some political thinkers from advocating\nfor a putatively older and better system known as enfeoffment\n(fengjian 封建). Official Confucian histories\nsuggested that this system had been in place at the time of the\nsage-kings, which suggested that it had succeeded in creating the high\ndegree of social harmony and virtue that characterized that golden\nage. The most notable feature of the enfeoffment system was that\nregional governorships were inherited titles and thus treated as the\nhereditary rights and responsibilities of certain families (with some\nallowances to forcibly remove vicious or incompetent governors). But\nConfucian proponents of enfeoffment such as Zhang Zai and Hu Hong\n(1106–1161) saw a great deal to recommend it. By creating\nregional power bases, they suggested, the Chinese state would be more\nresilient and better able to survive when the emperor or his court\nwere in disarray. They also thought that by having lasting,\nmulti-generational relationships between local governors and their\nsubjects they would help bring about more intimate and family-like\nrelationships between governor and subject, thereby creating\ncircumstances more conducive to social harmony and the cultivation of\nvirtue. Finally, advocates like Zhang and Hu thought that the\nenfeoffment system could be paired with a legendary system of land\ndistribution known as the well-field system, which guaranteed farming\nfamilies relatively equal plots of land with relatively incontestable\nboundaries, all of which was meant to ensure greater equality for\ncommoners and greater peace and accord in general (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 201–206). \nConfucian political thinkers in the Song-Ming period were preoccupied\nwith many other contentious issues in the affairs of state and often\nargued vehemently over the powers and responsibilities of specific\noffices, famine relief policies, state rituals, laws and punishments,\ntax and lending policies, and military and foreign affairs\n(JSL 8–10; MYDFL; ZZYL 108–14;\nZhu 2019: 56–71). Still, sometimes their disagreements about\nthese issues stemmed from deeper disagreements about the role of\nvirtue, talent, and institutional rules and incentives in effecting\ngood governance. When the Confucians turned to consider these issues\nexplicitly they often presented them as part of a debate about the\nrelative importance of “institutional rules” (fa\n法) as compared with “people” (ren\n人) in good governance. In a well-known essay attributed to the\nclassical Confucian Xunzi, the author framed this question in exactly\nthose terms, arguing that good governance depends largely and more\nfundamentally on getting the right people, by which he meant people of\ntalent and virtue. The chapter sums up this position in the succinct\nand memorable claim that “there are people who create order but\nno rules that create order” (Xunzi 12/57/3 [117]). \nMost of the explicit debate about this issue was taken up after a\nseries of attempts at dramatic reform at the tail end of the Northern\nSong associated with Wang Anshi and his successors. However\nwell-conceived those reforms may have been in their own right, they\ncoincided with a disastrous famine resulting in widespread debt and\ndislocation, and the last round of major reforms took place shortly\nbefore the Northern Song fell to Jurchen invaders. With that national\nanguish and humiliation serving as historical background for a great\ndeal of political thought in the subsequent Southern Song, many\npolitical thinkers blamed the very attempt to improve governance\nthrough mere reform (rather than concomitant improvements in\ncharacter) for the Northern Song’s downfall. Accordingly, most\npolitical thinkers were attracted to Xunzi’s position on the\nquestion of the relative importance of people (of good character)\nversus institutional rules. Zhu Xi articulates a version of this\nconsensus position in some recorded remarks to his students: \nThis age suffers from two defects: defects in its institutional rules\n(fa) and defects in the current political situation. The\ndefects in the rules can all be altered at once quite easily, but the\ndefects in the current political situation all reside in people. How\ncan they be changed when people go about their business with a selfish\nheartmind! The rules of the last eight years of Emperor\nRenzong’s reign can be considered defective. Wang Anshi changed\nthem all soon after [becoming the emperor’s prime minister], but\nthis only gave rise to numerous new defects. This is because people\nare hard to change. (ZZYL 108:2688; translation slightly\nmodified from Zhu 2019: 62) \nThe view propounded by Zhu Xi and other character-centered theorists\nlike Hu Hong seemed to allow that both decent institutional rules and\nvirtuous state officials were required for good governance. But once\nthe rules were decent, Zhu suggested, one could not expect to make\nfurther progress without improvements in character to ensure better\nimplementation. Both Zhu Xi and Hu Hong also seemed to be struck by\nthe idea that institutional rules have little causal responsibility in\ntheir own right and that it is much more to the credit and good\njudgment of virtuous people that they are used to good effect (Tiwald\n2019). \nAlthough the more character-centered view was generally more widely\naccepted by the most influential Song-Ming Confucians, there were some\nnotable defenders of the position that institutional reforms alone\ncould make improvements in governance. Two of these were the famous\nYongjia Confucians noted in\n section 2.5,\n Chen Liang and Ye Shi. These two sought ways of improving the\noutcomes of policy and institutional changes without requiring more\naltruistic motives of people, and to some extent sought to redefine\ntraditional virtues so that they could be more compatible with\nself-interest (Niu 1998; Tillman 1982). Another was the daring\npolitical reformer Huang Zongxi, who argued for institutional\npractices that continued to call for relatively good leaders but also\ncreated incentives to do some of the work that otherwise depended on\nthe exceptional good will and conscientiousness of the emperor or\nstate officials (Tiwald 2019: 86–92). Among other things, he\nproposed a stronger and more independent office of the prime minister\nor grand councilor, a rotational draft system for lower-level\nofficials, and a requirement that the emperor attend academy debates\nin which local representatives could express their opinions relatively\nfreely (MYDFL). \nThe Confucian thinkers of the Song-Ming period came in for a great\ndeal of criticism in the centuries following the collapse of the Ming\ndynasty in 1644. Much of the innovative scholarship in the subsequent\nQing dynasty (1644–1911) was conducted by Confucian scholars\nclosely affiliated with “evidential studies”, who tended\nto see philosophers like Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming as too reliant on\nabstract speculation and personal introspection. As Chinese\nintellectuals began to take more interest in Western philosophy in the\n19th and 20th centuries, some saw themselves as\nbelonging to a tradition continuous with philosophers like Zhu and\nWang, but others rejected Confucianism outright and Song-Ming\nConfucianism with it. Still, Zhu Xi stayed squarely at the center of\nthe formal education system and the civil service exams right up to\nthe early 20th century. And there is little question that\nSong-Ming Confucianism—especially the works of Zhu and\nWang—continue to be tremendously influential in the late\n20th and early 21st centuries. To this day, many\npeople in East Asia who take a more scholarly approach to Confucianism\nregard Zhu’s interpretations as authoritative. Standard\nChinese-language “readers” (duben\n讀本) of the Confucian canon follow Zhu Xi’s\ninterpretations closely (e.g., Xie 2003). Consequently, some of the\npopular treatments of classical Confucianism continue to adopt the\nterminology, conceptual frameworks, and philosophical vision of Zhu Xi\neven as they purport to provide interpretations of the\ntradition’s founding figures and texts. In the West it is not\nuncommon to find specialists in Confucian philosophy who work\nprimarily or exclusively on classical texts such as the\nAnalects or the Mencius, but for scholars of\nConfucianism in Chinese-speaking countries, many of the philosophical\ndisputes are extensions of those found in the Song and Ming. The\nChinese-speaking world’s most celebrated present-day\nphilosophers are “New Confucians” (Xin\nrujia 新儒家), thinkers that take\nthemselves to be continuing the work of the Song-Ming Confucians (M.\nLee 2017; Makeham 2003a). The same is true for scholars of\nConfucianism throughout East Asia, due in part to the tremendous\ninfluence of Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. A\ngreat deal of current Confucian discourse in East Asia is framed as a\nmatter of taking sides between competing lineages or factions of the\nSong and Ming, especially the Learning of Pattern (Lixue)\nschool associated with Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi and the Learning of the\nHeartmind (Xinxue) school associated with Lu Xiangshan and\nWang Yangming (Chen 2010). \nIn certain respects it is unsurprising that Song-Ming Confucianism has\nloomed so large in East Asian philosophy in the present day. The\nthinkers of the Song-Ming period did so much to add philosophical\ndepth and systematicity to the more laconic and fragmentary Confucian\ncanon, it thus understandable that the scholars who are themselves\nphilosophers or looking for philosophy in the historical Confucian\ntradition would be drawn to its greatest systematizers.","contact.mail":"jtiwald@sfsu.edu","contact.domain":"sfsu.edu"}]
