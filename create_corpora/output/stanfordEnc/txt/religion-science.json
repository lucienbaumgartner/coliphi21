To what extent are\nreligion and science compatible? Are religious beliefs sometimes\nconducive to science, or do they inevitably pose obstacles to\nscientific inquiry? The interdisciplinary field of “science and\nreligion”, also called “theology and science”, aims\nto answer these and other questions. It studies historical and\ncontemporary interactions between these fields, and provides\nphilosophical analyses of how they interrelate.\n\n\nThis entry provides an overview of the topics and discussions in\nscience and religion. Section 1 outlines the scope of both fields, and\nhow they are related. Section 2 looks at the relationship between\nscience and religion in three religious traditions, Christianity,\nIslam, and Hinduism. Section 3 discusses contemporary topics of\nscientific inquiry in which science and religion intersect, focusing\non creation, divine action, and human origins. Section 4 concludes by\nlooking at a few future directions of the study of science and\nreligion.\n\n\n\n\nSince the 1960s, scholars in theology, philosophy, history, and the\nsciences have studied the relationship between science and religion.\nScience and religion is a recognized field of study with dedicated\njournals (e.g., Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science),\nacademic chairs (e.g., the Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and\nReligion at Oxford University), scholarly societies (e.g., the Science\nand Religion Forum), and recurring conferences (e.g., the European\nSociety for the Study of Science and Theology holds meetings every two\nyears). Most of its authors are either theologians (e.g., John Haught,\nSarah Coakley), philosophers with an interest in science (e.g., Nancey\nMurphy), or (former) scientists with long-standing interests in\nreligion, some of whom are also ordained clergy (e.g., the physicist\nJohn Polkinghorne, the biochemist Arthur Peacocke, and the molecular\nbiophysicist Alister McGrath). \nThe systematic study of science and religion started in the 1960s,\nwith authors such as Ian Barbour (1966) and Thomas F. Torrance (1969)\nwho challenged the prevailing view that science and religion were\neither at war or indifferent to each other. Barbour’s Issues\nin Science and Religion (1966) set out several enduring themes of\nthe field, including a comparison of methodology and theory in both\nfields. Zygon, the first specialist journal on science and\nreligion, was also founded in 1966. While the early study of science\nand religion focused on methodological issues, authors from the late\n1980s to the 2000s developed contextual approaches, including detailed\nhistorical examinations of the relationship between science and\nreligion (e.g., Brooke 1991). Peter Harrison (1998) challenged the\nwarfare model by arguing that Protestant theological conceptions of\nnature and humanity helped to give rise to science in the\nseventeenth century. Peter Bowler (2001, 2009) drew attention to a\nbroad movement of liberal Christians and evolutionists in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries who aimed to reconcile\nevolutionary theory with religious belief. \nIn the 1990s, the Vatican Observatory (Castel Gandolfo, Italy) and the\nCenter for Theology and the Natural Sciences (Berkeley, California)\nco-sponsored a series of conferences on divine action. It had\ncontributors from philosophy and theology (e.g., Nancey Murphy) and\nthe sciences (e.g., Francisco Ayala). The aim of these conferences was\nto understand divine action in the light of contemporary sciences.\nEach of the five conferences, and each edited volume that arose from\nit, was devoted to an area of natural science and its interaction with\nreligion, including quantum cosmology (1992, Russell et al. 1993),\nchaos and complexity (1994, Russell et al. 1995), evolutionary and\nmolecular biology (1996, Russell et al. 1998), neuroscience and the\nperson (1998, Russell et al. 2000), and quantum mechanics (2000,\nRussell et al. 2001). (See also Russell et al. 2008 for a book-length\nsummary of the findings of this project.) \nIn the contemporary public sphere, the most prominent interaction\nbetween science and religion concerns evolutionary theory and\ncreationism/Intelligent Design. The legal battles (e.g., the\nKitzmiller versus Dover trial in 2005) and lobbying surrounding the\nteaching of evolution and creationism in American schools suggest that\nreligion and science conflict. However, even if one were to focus on\nthe reception of evolutionary theory, the relationship between\nreligion and science is complex. For instance, in the United Kingdom,\nscientists, clergy, and popular writers, sought to reconcile science\nand religion during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, whereas the United States saw the rise of a fundamentalist\nopposition to evolutionary thinking, exemplified by the Scopes trial\nin 1925 (Bowler 2001, 2009). \nIn recent decades, Church leaders have issued conciliatory public\nstatements on evolutionary theory. Pope John Paul II (1996) affirmed\nevolutionary theory in his message to the Pontifical Academy of\nSciences, but rejected it for the human soul, which he saw as the\nresult of a separate, special creation. The Church of England publicly\nendorsed evolutionary theory (e.g., M. Brown 2008), including an\napology to Charles Darwin for its initial rejection of his theory. \nFor the past fifty years, science and religion has been de facto\nWestern science and Christianity—to what extent can Christian\nbeliefs be brought in line with the results of Western science? The\nfield of science and religion has only recently turned to an\nexamination of non-Christian traditions, such as Judaism, Hinduism,\nBuddhism, and Islam, providing a richer picture of interaction. \nIn order to understand the scope of science and religion and what\ninteractions there are between them, we must at least get a rough\nsense of what science and religion are. After all,\n“science” and “religion” are not eternally\nunchanging terms with unambiguous meanings. Indeed, they are terms\nthat were coined recently, with meanings that vary across times and\ncultures. Before the nineteenth century, the term\n“religion” was rarely used. For medieval authors, such as\nAquinas, the term religio meant piety or worship, and was\ndenied of “religious” systems outside of what he\nconsidered orthodoxy (Harrison 2015). The term “religion”\nobtained its considerably broader current meaning through the works of\nearly anthropologists, such as E.B. Tylor (1871), who systematically\nused the term for religions across the world. \nThe term “science” as it is currently used also became\ncommon only in the nineteenth century. Prior to this, what we\ncall “science” was referred to as “natural\nphilosophy” or “experimental philosophy”. William\nWhewell (1834) standardized the term “scientist” to refer\nto practitioners of diverse natural philosophies. Philosophers of\nscience have attempted to demarcate science from other\nknowledge-seeking endeavors, in particular religion. For instance,\nKarl Popper (1959) claimed that scientific hypotheses (unlike\nreligious ones) are in principle falsifiable. Many (e.g., Taylor 1996)\naffirm a difference between science and religion, even if the meanings\nof both terms are historically contingent. They disagree, however, on\nhow to precisely (and across times and cultures) demarcate the two\ndomains. \nOne way to distinguish between science and religion is the claim that\nscience concerns the natural world, whereas religion concerns both the\nnatural and the supernatural. Scientific explanations do not appeal to\nsupernatural entities such as gods or angels (fallen or not), or to\nnon-natural forces (like miracles, karma, or Qi). For\nexample, neuroscientists typically explain our thoughts in terms of\nbrain states, not by reference to an immaterial soul or spirit. \nNaturalists draw a distinction between methodological naturalism, an\nepistemological principle that limits scientific inquiry to natural\nentities and laws, and ontological or philosophical naturalism, a\nmetaphysical principle that rejects the supernatural (Forrest 2000).\nSince methodological naturalism is concerned with the practice of\nscience (in particular, with the kinds of entities and processes that\nare invoked), it does not make any statements about whether or not\nsupernatural entities exist. They might exist, but lie outside of the\nscope of scientific investigation. Some authors (e.g., Rosenberg 2014)\nhold that taking the results of science seriously entails negative\nanswers to such persistent questions as free will or moral knowledge.\nHowever, these stronger conclusions are controversial. \nThe view that science can be demarcated from religion in its\nmethodological naturalism is more commonly accepted. For instance, in\nthe Kitzmiller versus Dover trial, the philosopher of science Robert\nPennock was called to testify by the plaintiffs on whether Intelligent\nDesign was a form of creationism, and therefore religion. If it were,\nthe Dover school board policy would violate the Establishment Clause\nof the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Building on\nearlier work (e.g., Pennock 1998), Pennock argued that Intelligent\nDesign, in its appeal to supernatural mechanisms, was not\nmethodologically naturalistic, and that methodological naturalism is\nan essential component of science—though it is not a dogmatic\nrequirement, it flows from reasonable evidential requirements, such as\nthe ability to test theories empirically.  \nNatural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Robert\nHooke, and Robert Boyle, sometimes appealed to supernatural agents in\ntheir natural philosophy (which we now call “science”).\nStill, overall there was a tendency to favor naturalistic explanations\nin natural philosophy. This preference for naturalistic causes may\nhave been encouraged by past successes of naturalistic explanations,\nleading authors such as Paul Draper (2005) to argue that the success\nof methodological naturalism could be evidence for ontological\nnaturalism. Explicit methodological naturalism arose in the\nnineteenth century with the X-club, a lobby group for the\nprofessionalization of science founded in 1864 by Thomas Huxley and\nfriends, which aimed to promote a science that would be free from\nreligious dogmas. The X-club may have been in part motivated by the\ndesire to remove competition by amateur-clergymen scientists in the\nfield of science, and thus to open up the field to full-time\nprofessionals (Garwood 2008).  \nBecause “science” and “religion” defy\ndefinition, discussing the relationship between science (in general)\nand religion (in general) may be meaningless. For example, Kelly Clark\n(2014) argues that we can only sensibly inquire into the relationship\nbetween a widely accepted claim of science (such as quantum mechanics\nor findings in neuroscience) and a specific claim of a particular\nreligion (such as Islamic understandings of divine providence or\nBuddhist views of the no-self). \nSeveral typologies characterize the interaction between science and\nreligion. For example, Mikael Stenmark (2004) distinguishes between\nthree views: the independence view (no overlap between science and\nreligion), the contact view (some overlap between the fields), and a\nunion of the domains of science and religion; within those views he\nrecognizes further subdivisions, e.g., the contact can be in the form\nof conflict or harmony. The most influential model of the\nrelationships between science and religion remains Barbour’s\n(2000): conflict, independence, dialogue, and integration. Subsequent\nauthors, as well as Barbour himself, have refined and amended this\ntaxonomy. However, others (e.g., Cantor and Kenny 2001) have argued\nthat it is not useful to understand past interactions between both\nfields. For one thing, it focuses on the cognitive content of\nreligions at the expense of other aspects, such as rituals and social\nstructures. Moreover, there is no clear definition of what conflict\nmeans (evidential or logical). The model is not as philosophically\nsophisticated as some of its successors, such as Stenmark’s\n(2004). Nevertheless, because of its enduring influence, it is still\nworthwhile to discuss this taxonomy in detail. \nThe conflict model, which holds that science and religion are in\nperpetual and principal conflict, relies heavily on two historical\nnarratives: the trial of Galileo (see Dawes 2016 for a contemporary\nre-examination) and the reception of Darwinism (see Bowler 2001). The\nconflict model was developed and defended in the nineteenth\ncentury by the following two publications: John Draper’s (1874)\nHistory of the Conflict between Religion and Science and\nWhite’s (1896) two-volume opus A History of the Warfare of\nScience with Theology in Christendom. Both authors argued that\nscience and religion inevitably conflict as they essentially discuss\nthe same domain. The vast majority of authors in the science and\nreligion field is critical of the conflict model and believes it is\nbased on a shallow and partisan reading of the historical record.\nIronically, two views that otherwise have little in common, scientific\nmaterialism and extreme biblical literalism, both assume a conflict\nmodel: both assume that if science is right, religion is wrong, or\nvice versa. \nWhile the conflict model is at present a minority position, some have\nused philosophical argumentation (e.g., Philipse 2012) or have\ncarefully re-examined historical evidence such as the Galileo trial\n(e.g., Dawes 2016) to argue for this model. Alvin Plantinga (2011) has\nargued that the conflict is not between science and religion, but\nbetween science and naturalism.  \nThe independence model holds that science and religion explore\nseparate domains that ask distinct questions. Stephen Jay Gould\ndeveloped an influential independence model with his NOMA principle\n(“Non-Overlapping Magisteria”):  \nThe lack of conflict between science and religion arises from a lack\nof overlap between their respective domains of professional expertise.\n(2001: 739)  \nHe identified science’s areas of expertise as empirical\nquestions about the constitution of the universe, and religion’s\ndomains of expertise as ethical values and spiritual meaning. NOMA is\nboth descriptive and normative: religious leaders should refrain from\nmaking factual claims about, for instance, evolutionary theory, just\nas scientists should not claim insight on moral matters. Gould held\nthat there might be interactions at the borders of each magisterium,\nsuch as our responsibility toward other creatures. One obvious problem\nwith the independence model is that if religion were barred from\nmaking any statement of fact it would be difficult to justify the\nclaims of value and ethics, e.g., one could not argue that one should\nlove one’s neighbor because it pleases the creator (Worrall\n2004). Moreover, religions do seem to make empirical claims, for\nexample, that Jesus appeared after his death or that the early Hebrews\npassed through the parted waters of the Red Sea. \nThe dialogue model proposes a mutualistic relationship between\nreligion and science. Unlike independence, dialogue assumes that there\nis common ground between both fields, perhaps in their\npresuppositions, methods, and concepts. For example, the Christian\ndoctrine of creation may have encouraged science by assuming that\ncreation (being the product of a designer) is both intelligible and\norderly, so one can expect there are laws that can be discovered.\nCreation, as a product of God’s free actions, is also\ncontingent, so the laws of nature cannot be learned through a\npriori thinking, which prompts the need for empirical\ninvestigation. According to Barbour (2000), both scientific and\ntheological inquiry are theory-dependent (or at least model-dependent,\ne.g., the doctrine of the Trinity colors how Christian theologians\ninterpret the first chapters of Genesis), rely on metaphors and\nmodels, and value coherence, comprehensiveness, and fruitfulness. In\ndialogue, the fields remain separate but they talk to each other,\nusing common methods, concepts, and presuppositions. Wentzel van\nHuyssteen (1998) has argued for a dialogue position, proposing that\nscience and religion can be in a graceful duet, based on their\nepistemological overlaps. \nThe integration model is more extensive in its unification of science\nand theology. Barbour (2000) identifies three forms of integration.\nThe first is natural theology, which formulates arguments for the\nexistence and attributes of God. It uses results of the natural\nsciences as premises in its arguments. For instance, the supposition\nthat the universe has a temporal origin features in contemporary\ncosmological arguments for the existence of God, and the fact that the\ncosmological constants and laws of nature are life-permitting (whereas\nmany other combinations of constants and laws would not permit life)\nis used in contemporary fine-tuning arguments. The second, theology of\nnature, starts not from science but from a religious framework, and\nexamines how this can enrich or even revise findings of the sciences.\nFor example, McGrath (2016) developed a Christian theology of nature,\nexamining how nature and scientific findings can be regarded through a\nChristian lens. Thirdly, Barbour believed that Whitehead’s\nprocess philosophy was a promising way to integrate science and\nreligion. \nWhile integration seems attractive (especially to theologians), it is\ndifficult to do justice to both the science and religion aspects of a\ngiven domain, especially given their complexities. For example, Pierre\nTeilhard de Chardin (1971), who was both knowledgeable in\npaleoanthropology and theology, ended up with an unconventional view\nof evolution as teleological (which brought him into trouble with the\nscientific establishment), and with an unorthodox theology (with an\nunconventional interpretation of original sin that brought him into\ntrouble with the Roman Catholic Church). Theological heterodoxy, by\nitself, is no reason to doubt a model, but it points to difficulties\nfor the integration model in becoming successful in the broader\ncommunity of theologians and philosophers. Moreover, integration seems\nskewed towards theism as Barbour described arguments based on\nscientific results that support (but do not demonstrate) theism, but\nfailed to discuss arguments based on scientific results that support\n(but do not demonstrate) the denial of theism. \nScience and religion are closely interconnected in the scientific\nstudy of religion, which can be traced back to seventeenth-century\nnatural histories of religion. Natural historians attempted to provide\nnaturalistic explanations for human behavior and culture, for domains\nsuch as religion, emotions, and morality. For example, Bernard de\nFontenelle’s De l’Origine des Fables (1724)\noffered a causal account of belief in the supernatural. People often\nassert supernatural explanations when they lack an understanding of\nthe natural causes underlying extraordinary events: “To the\nextent that one is more ignorant, or one has less experience, one sees\nmore miracles” (1724/1824: 295, my translation). This idea\nforeshadows Auguste Comte’s (1841) belief that myths would\ngradually give way to scientific accounts. Hume’s Natural\nHistory of Religion (1757/2007) is the best-known philosophical\nexample of a natural historical explanation of religious belief. It\ntraces the origins of polytheism—which Hume thought was the\nearliest form of religious belief—to ignorance about natural\ncauses combined with fear and apprehension about the environment. By\ndeifying aspects of the environment, early humans tried to persuade or\nbribe the gods, thereby gaining a sense of control. \nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth century, authors from newly\nemerging scientific disciplines, such as anthropology, sociology, and\npsychology, examined the purported naturalistic roots of religious\nbelief. They did so with a broad brush, trying to explain what unifies\ndiverse religious beliefs across cultures, rather than accounting for\ncultural variations. In anthropology, the idea that all cultures\nevolve and progress along the same lines (cultural evolutionism) was\nwidespread. Cultures with differing religious views were explained as\nbeing in an early stage of development. For example, Tylor (1871)\nregarded animism, the belief that spirits animate the world, as the\nearliest form of religious belief. Comte (1841) proposed that all\nsocieties, in their attempts to make sense of the world, go through\nthe same stages of development: the theological (religious) stage is\nthe earliest phase, where religious explanations predominate, followed\nby the metaphysical stage (a non-intervening God), and culminating in\nthe positive or scientific stage, marked by scientific explanations\nand empirical observations. \nThe sociologist Émile Durkheim (1915) considered religious\nbeliefs as social glue that helped to keep society together. The\npsychologist Sigmund Freud (1927) saw religious belief as an illusion,\na childlike yearning for a fatherly figure. The full story Freud\noffers is quite bizarre: in past times, a father who monopolized all\nthe women in the tribe was killed and eaten by his sons. The sons felt\nguilty and started to idolize their murdered father. This, together\nwith taboos on cannibalism and incest, generated the first religion.\nFreud also considered “oceanic feeling” (a feeling of\nlimitlessness and of being connected with the world) as one of the\norigins of religious belief. He thought this feeling was a remnant of\nan infant’s experience of the self, prior to being weaned off\nthe breast. Authors such as Durkheim and Freud, together with social\ntheorists such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, proposed versions of the\nsecularization thesis, the view that religion would decline in the\nface of modern technology, science, and culture. Philosopher and\npsychologist William James (1902) was interested in the psychological\nroots and the phenomenology of religious experiences, which he\nbelieved were the ultimate source of institutional religions. \nFrom the 1920s onward, the scientific study of religion became less\nconcerned with grand unifying narratives, and focused more on\nparticular religious traditions and beliefs. Anthropologists, such as\nEdward Evans-Pritchard (1937/1965) and Bronislaw Malinowski\n(1925/1992) no longer relied exclusively on second-hand reports\n(usually of poor quality and from distorted sources), but engaged in\nserious fieldwork. Their ethnographies indicated that cultural\nevolutionism was mistaken and that religious beliefs were more diverse\nthan was previously assumed. They argued that religious beliefs were\nnot the result of ignorance of naturalistic mechanisms; for instance,\nEvans-Pritchard noted that the Azande were well aware that houses\ncould collapse because termites ate away at their foundations, but\nthey still appealed to witchcraft to explain why a particular house\nhad collapsed. More recently, Cristine Legare et al. (2012) found that\npeople in various cultures straightforwardly combine supernatural and\nnatural explanations, for instance, South Africans are aware AIDS is\ncaused by a virus, but some also believe that the viral infection is\nultimately caused by a witch. \nPsychologists and sociologists of religion also began to doubt that\nreligious beliefs were rooted in irrationality, psychopathology, and\nother atypical psychological states, as James (1902) and other early\npsychologists had assumed. In the United States, in the late 1930s\nthrough the 1960s, psychologists developed a renewed interest for\nreligion, fueled by the observation that religion refused to\ndecline—thus casting doubt on the secularization\nthesis—and seemed to undergo a substantial revival (see Stark\n1999 for an overview). Psychologists of religion have made\nincreasingly fine-grained distinctions among types of religiosity,\nincluding extrinsic religiosity (being religious as means to an end,\nfor instance, getting the benefits of being in a social group) and\nintrinsic religiosity (people who adhere to religions for the sake of\ntheir teachings) (Allport and Ross 1967). Psychologists and\nsociologists now commonly study religiosity as an independent\nvariable, with an impact on, for instance, health, criminality,\nsexuality, and social networks. \nA recent development in the scientific study of religion is the\ncognitive science of religion. This is a multidisciplinary field, with\nauthors from, among others, developmental psychology, anthropology,\nphilosophy, and cognitive psychology. It differs from the other\nscientific approaches to religion by its presupposition that religion\nis not a purely cultural phenomenon, but the result of ordinary, early\ndeveloped, and universal human cognitive processes (e.g., Barrett\n2004, Boyer 2002). Some authors regard religion as the byproduct of\ncognitive processes that do not have an evolved function specific for\nreligion. For example, according to Paul Bloom (2007), religion emerges\nas a byproduct of our intuitive distinction between minds and bodies:\nwe can think of minds as continuing, even after the body dies (e.g.,\nby attributing desires to a dead family member), which makes belief in\nan afterlife and in disembodied spirits natural and spontaneous.\nAnother family of hypotheses regards religion as a biological or\ncultural adaptive response that helps humans solve cooperative\nproblems (e.g., Bering 2011). Through their belief in big, powerful\ngods that can punish, humans behave more cooperatively, which allowed\nhuman group sizes to expand beyond small hunter-gatherer communities.\nGroups with belief in big gods thus outcompeted groups without such\nbeliefs for resources during the Neolithic, which explains the current\nsuccess of belief in such gods (Norenzayan 2013). \nUntil the nineteenth and even early twentieth century, it was common\nfor scientists to have religious beliefs which guided their work. In\nthe seventeenth century, the design argument reached its peak\npopularity and natural philosophers were convinced that science\nprovided evidence for God’s providential creation. Natural\nphilosopher Isaac Newton held strong, albeit unorthodox religious\nbeliefs (Pfizenmaier 1997). By contrast, contemporary scientists have\nlower religiosity compared to the general population. There are vocal\nexceptions, such as the geneticist Francis Collins, erstwhile the\nleader of the Human Genome Project. His book The Language of\nGod (2006) and the BioLogos Institute he founded advocate\ncompatibility between science and Christianity. \nSociological studies (e.g., Ecklundt 2010) have probed the religious\nbeliefs of scientists, particularly in the United States. They\nindicate a significant difference in religiosity in scientists\ncompared to the general population. Surveys such as those conducted by\nthe Pew forum (Masci and Smith 2016) find that nearly nine in ten\nadults in the US say they believe in God or a universal spirit, a\nnumber that has only slightly declined in recent decades. Among\nyounger adults, the percentage of theists is about 80%. Atheism and\nagnosticism are widespread among academics, especially among those\nworking in elite institutions. A survey among National Academy of\nSciences members (all senior academics, overwhelmingly from elite\nfaculties) found that the majority disbelieved in God’s\nexistence (72.2%), with 20.8% being agnostic, and only 7% theists\n(Larson and Witham 1998). Ecklund and Scheitle (2007) analyzed responses\nfrom scientists (working in the social and natural sciences) from 21\nelite universities in the US. About 31.2% of their participants\nself-identified as atheists and a further 31% as agnostics. The\nremaining number believed in a higher power (7%), sometimes believed\nin God (5.4%), believed in God with some doubts (15.5%), or believed\nin God without any doubts (9.7%). In contrast to the general\npopulation, the older scientists in this sample did not show higher\nreligiosity—in fact, they were more likely to say that they did\nnot believe in God. On the other hand, Gross and Simmons (2009)\nexamined a more heterogeneous sample of scientists from American\ncolleges, including community colleges, elite doctoral-granting\ninstitutions, non-elite four-year state schools, and small liberal\narts colleges. They found that the majority of university professors\n(full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty) had some theistic beliefs,\nbelieving either in God (34.9%), in God with some doubts (16.6%), in\nGod some of the time (4.3%), or in a higher power (19.2%). Belief in\nGod was influenced both by type of institution (lower theistic belief\nin more prestigious schools) and by discipline (lower theistic belief\nin the physical and biological sciences compared to the social\nsciences and humanities). \nThese latter findings indicate that academics are more religiously\ndiverse than has been popularly assumed and that the majority are not\nopposed to religion. Even so, in the US the percentage of atheists and\nagnostics in academia is higher than in the general population, a\ndiscrepancy that requires an explanation. One reason might be a bias\nagainst theists in academia. For example, when sociologists were\nsurveyed whether they would hire someone if they knew the candidate\nwas an evangelical Christian, 39.1% said they would be less likely to\nhire that candidate—there were similar results\nwith other religious groups, such as Mormons or Muslims (Yancey 2012). Another\nreason might be that theists internalize prevalent negative societal\nstereotypes, which leads them to underperform in scientific tasks and\nlose interest in pursuing a scientific career. Kimberly Rios et al.\n(2015) found that non-religious participants believe that theists,\nespecially Christians, are less competent in and less trustful of\nscience. When this stereotype was made salient, Christian participants\nperformed worse in logical reasoning tasks (which were misleadingly\npresented as “scientific reasoning tests”) than when the\nstereotype was not mentioned. \nIt is unclear whether religious and scientific thinking are\ncognitively incompatible. Some studies suggest that religion draws\nmore upon an intuitive style of thinking, distinct from the analytic\nreasoning style that characterizes science (Gervais and Norenzayan\n2012). On the other hand, the acceptance of theological and scientific\nviews both rely on a trust in testimony, and cognitive scientists have\nfound similarities between the way children and adults understand\ntestimony to invisible entities in religious and scientific domains\n(Harris et al. 2006). Moreover, theologians such as the Church Fathers\nand Scholastics were deeply analytic in their writings, indicating\nthat the association between intuitive and religious thinking might be\na recent Western bias. More research is needed to examine whether\nreligious and scientific thinking styles are inherently in\ntension. \nAs noted, most studies on the relationship between science and\nreligion have focused on science and Christianity, with only a small\nnumber of publications devoted to other religious traditions (e.g.,\nBrooke and Numbers 2011). Relatively few monographs pay attention to\nthe relationship between science and religion in non-Christian milieus\n(e.g., Judaism and Islam in Clark 2014). Since Western science makes\nuniversal claims, it is easy to assume that its encounter with other\nreligious traditions is similar to the interactions observed in\nChristianity. However, given different creedal tenets (e.g., in Hindu\ntraditions God is usually not entirely distinct from creation, unlike\nin Christianity and Judaism), and because science has had distinct\nhistorical trajectories in other cultures, one can expect disanalogies\nin the relationship between science and religion in different\nreligious traditions. To give a sense of this diversity, this section\nprovides a bird’s eye overview of science and religion in\nChristianity, Islam, and Hinduism. \nChristianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion, currently the\nlargest religion in the world. It developed in the first century AD\nout of Judaism from a group of followers of Jesus. Christians adhere\nto asserted revelations described in a series of canonical texts,\nwhich include the Old Testament, which comprises texts inherited from\nJudaism, and the New Testament, which contains the Gospels of Matthew,\nMark, Luke, and John (narratives on the life and teachings of Jesus),\nas well as events and teachings of the early Christian churches (e.g.,\nActs of the Apostles, letters by Paul), and Revelation, a prophetic\nbook on the end times. \nGiven the prominence of revealed texts in Christianity, a useful\nstarting point to examine the relationship between Christianity and\nscience is the two books metaphor (see Tanzella-Nitti 2005 for an\noverview). Accordingly, God revealed Godself through the “Book\nof Nature”, with its orderly laws, and the “Book of\nScripture”, with its historical narratives and accounts of\nmiracles. Augustine (354–430) argued that the book of nature was\nthe more accessible of the two, since scripture requires literacy\nwhereas illiterates and literates alike could read the book of nature.\nMaximus Confessor (c. 580–662), in his Ambigua (see\nLouth 1996 for a collection of and critical introduction to these\ntexts) compared scripture and natural law to two clothes that\nenveloped the Incarnated Logos: Jesus’ humanity is revealed by\nnature, whereas his divinity is revealed by the scriptures. During the\nMiddle Ages, authors such as Hugh of St.  Victor (ca. 1096–1141)\nand Bonaventure (1221–1274) began to realize that the book of\nnature was not at all straightforward to read. Given that original sin\nmarred our reason and perception, what conclusions could humans\nlegitimately draw about ultimate reality?  Bonaventure used the\nmetaphor of the books to the extent that “liber\nnaturae” was a synonym for creation, the natural world. He\nargued that sin has clouded human reason so much that the book of\nnature has become unreadable, and that scripture is needed as it\ncontains teachings about the world. \nChristian authors in the field of science and religion continue to\ndebate how these two books interrelate. Concordism is the attempt to\ninterpret scripture in the light of modern science. It is a\nhermeneutical approach to Bible interpretation, where one expects that\nthe Bible foretells scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory\nor evolutionary theory. However, as Denis Lamoureux (2008: chapter 5)\nargues, many scientific-sounding statements in the Bible are false:\nthe mustard seed is not the smallest seed, male reproductive seeds do\nnot contain miniature persons, there is no firmament, and the earth is\nneither flat nor immovable. Thus, any plausible form of integrating\nthe books of nature and scripture will require more nuance and\nsophistication. Theologians such as John Wesley (1703–1791) have\nproposed the addition of other sources of knowledge to scripture and\nscience: the Wesleyan quadrilateral (a term not coined by Wesley\nhimself) is the dynamic interaction of scripture, experience\n(including the empirical findings of the sciences), tradition, and\nreason (Outler 1985). \nSeveral Christian authors have attempted to integrate science and\nreligion (e.g., Haught 1995, Lamoureux 2008, Murphy 1995). They tend\nto interpret findings from the sciences, such as evolutionary theory\nor chaos theory, in a theological light, using established theological\nmodels, e.g., classical theism, kenosis, the doctrine of creation.\nJohn Haught (1995) argues that the theological view of kenosis\n(self-emptying) anticipates scientific findings such as evolutionary\ntheory: a self-emptying God (i.e., who limits Godself), who creates a\ndistinct and autonomous world, makes a world with internal\nself-coherence, with a self-organizing universe as the result. The\ndominant epistemological outlook in Christian science and religion has\nbeen critical realism, a position that applies both to theology\n(theological realism) and to science (scientific realism). Barbour\n(1966) introduced this view into the science and religion literature;\nit has been further developed by theologians such as Arthur Peacocke\n(1984) and Wentzel van Huyssteen (1999). Critical realism aims to\noffer a middle way between naïve realism (the world is as we\nperceive it) and instrumentalism (our perceptions and concepts are\npurely instrumental). It encourages critical reflection on perception\nand the world, hence “critical”. Critical realism has\ndistinct flavors in the works of different authors, for instance, van\nHuyssteen (1998, 1999) develops a weak form of critical realism set\nwithin a postfoundationalist notion of rationality, where theological\nviews are shaped by social, cultural, and evolved biological factors.\nMurphy (1995: 329–330) outlines doctrinal and scientific\nrequirements for approaches in science and religion: ideally, an\nintegrated approach should be broadly in line with Christian doctrine,\nespecially core tenets such as the doctrine of creation, while at the\nsame time it should be in line with empirical observations without\nundercutting scientific practices. \nSeveral historians (e.g., Hooykaas 1972) have argued that Christianity\nwas instrumental to the development of Western science. Peter Harrison\n(2009) thinks the doctrine of original sin played a crucial role in\nthis, arguing there was a widespread belief in the early modern period\nthat Adam, prior to the fall, had superior senses, intellect, and\nunderstanding. As a result of the fall, human senses became duller,\nour ability to make correct inferences was diminished, and nature\nitself became less intelligible. Postlapsarian humans (i.e., humans\nafter the fall) are no longer able to exclusively rely on their a\npriori reasoning to understand nature. They must supplement their\nreasoning and senses with observation through specialized instruments,\nsuch as microscopes and telescopes. As Robert Hooke wrote in the\nintroduction to his Micrographia:  \nevery man, both from a deriv’d corruption, innate and born with\nhim, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to\nslip into all sorts of errors … These being the dangers in the\nprocess of humane Reason, the remedies of them all can only proceed\nfrom the real, the mechanical, the experimental Philosophy\n[experiment-based science]. (1665, cited in Harrison 2009: 5) \nAnother theological development that may have facilitated the rise of\nscience was the Condemnation of Paris (1277), which forbade teaching\nand reading natural philosophical views that were considered\nheretical, such as Aristotle’s physical treatises. As a result,\nthe Condemnation opened up intellectual space to think beyond ancient\nGreek natural philosophy. For example, medieval philosophers such as\nJohn Buridan (fl. 14th c) held the Aristotelian belief that\nthere could be no vacuum in nature, but once the idea of a vacuum\nbecame plausible, natural philosophers such as Evangelista Torricelli\n(1608–1647) and Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) could experiment\nwith air pressure and vacua (see Grant 1996, for discussion). \nAs further evidence for a formative role of Christianity in the\ndevelopment of science, some authors point to the Christian beliefs of\nprominent natural philosophers of the seventeenth century. For\nexample, Clark writes,  \nExclude God from the definition of science and, in one fell\ndefinitional swoop, you exclude the greatest natural philosophers of\nthe so-called scientific revolution—Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo,\nBoyle, and Newton (to name just a few). (2014: 42)  \nOthers authors even go as far as to claim that Christianity was unique\nand instrumental in catalyzing the scientific\nrevolution—according to Rodney Stark (2004), the scientific\nrevolution was in fact a slow, gradual development from medieval\nChristian theology. Claims such as Stark’s, however, fail to\nrecognize the legitimate contributions of Islamic and Greek scholars,\nto name just a few, to the development of modern science. In spite of\nthese positive readings of the relationship between science and\nreligion in Christianity, there are sources of enduring tension. For\nexample, there is (still) vocal opposition to the theory of evolution\namong Christian fundamentalists. \nIslam is a monotheistic religion that emerged in the seventh \ncentury, following a series of purported revelations to the prophet\nMuḥammad. The term “Islam” also denotes\ngeo-political structures, such as caliphates and empires, which were\nfounded by Muslim rulers from the seventh century onward, including the\nUmayyad, Abbasid, and Ottoman caliphates. Additionally, it refers to a\nculture which flourished within this political and religious context,\nwith its own philosophical and scientific traditions (Dhanani 2002).\nThe defining characteristic of Islam is its belief in one God\n(Allāh), who communicates through prophets, including Adam,\nAbraham, and Muḥammad. Allāh‎’s revelations to\nMuḥammad are recorded in the Qurʾān, the central\nreligious text for Islam. Next to the Qurʾān, an important\nsource of jurisprudence and theology is the ḥadīth, an oral\ncorpus of attested sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the\nprophet Muḥammad. The two major branches of Islam, Sunni and\nShia, are based on a dispute over the succession of Muḥammad. As\nthe second largest religion in the world, Islam shows a wide variety\nof beliefs. Core creedal views include the oneness of God\n(tawḥīd), the view that there is only one\nundivided God who created and sustains the universe, prophetic\nrevelation (in particular to Muḥammad), and an afterlife. Beyond\nthis, Muslims disagree on a number of doctrinal issues. \nThe relationship between Islam and science is complex. Today,\npredominantly Muslim countries, such as the United Arabic Emirates,\nenjoy high urbanization and technological development, but they\nunderperform in common metrics of scientific research, such as\npublications in leading journals and number of citations per scientist\n(see Edis 2007). Moreover, Islamic countries are also hotbeds for\npseudoscientific ideas, such as Old Earth creationism, the creation of\nhuman bodies on the day of resurrection from the tailbone, and the\nsuperiority of prayer in treating lower-back pain instead of\nconventional methods (Guessoum 2009: 4–5). \nThe contemporary lack of scientific prominence is remarkable given\nthat the Islamic world far exceeded European cultures in the range and\nquality of its scientific knowledge between approximately the\nninth and the fifteenth century, excelling in domains\nsuch as mathematics (algebra and geometry, trigonometry in\nparticular), astronomy (seriously considering, but not adopting,\nheliocentrism), optics, and medicine. These domains of knowledge are\ncommonly referred to as “Arabic science”, to distinguish\nthem from the pursuits of science that arose in the west (Huff 2003).\nMany prominent Arabic scientists were polymaths, for example, Omar\nKhayyám (1048–1131) achieved lasting fame in disparate\ndomains such as poetry, astronomy, geography, and mineralogy. Other\nexamples include al-Fārābī (ca. 872–ca. 950), a\npolitical philosopher from Damascus who also investigated music\ntheory, science, and mathematics, and the Andalusian Ibn Rušd\n(Averroes, 1126–1198), who wrote on medicine, physics,\nastronomy, psychology, jurisprudence, music, geography, as well as\ndeveloping a Greek-inspired philosophical theology. \nA major impetus for Arabic science was the patronage of the Abbasid\ncaliphate (758–1258), centered in Baghdad. Early Abbasid rulers,\nsuch as Harun al-Rashid (ruled 786–809) and his successor\nAbū Jaʿfar Abdullāh al-Ma’mūn (ruled\n813–833), were significant patrons of Arabic science. The former\nfounded the Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom), which\ncommissioned translations of major works by Aristotle, Galen, and many\nPersian and Indian scholars into Arabic. It was cosmopolitan in its\noutlook, employing astronomers, mathematicians, and physicians from\nabroad, including Indian mathematicians and Nestorian (Christian)\nastronomers. Throughout the Arabic world, public libraries attached to\nmosques provided access to a vast compendium of knowledge, which\nspread Islam, Greek philosophy, and Arabic science. The use of a\ncommon language (Arabic), as well as common religious and political\ninstitutions and flourishing trade relations encouraged the spread of\nscientific ideas throughout the empire. Some of this transmission was\ninformal, e.g., correspondence between like-minded people (see Dhanani\n2002), some formal, e.g., in hospitals where students learned about\nmedicine in a practical, master-apprentice setting, and in\nastronomical observatories and academies. The decline and fall of the\nAbbasid caliphate dealt a blow to Arabic science, but it remains\nunclear why it ultimately stagnated, and why it did not experience\nsomething analogous to the scientific revolution in Western\nEurope. \nSome liberal Muslim authors, such as Fatima Mernissi (1992), argue\nthat the rise of conservative forms of Islamic philosophical theology\nstifled more scientifically-minded natural philosophers. In the\nninth to the twelfth century, the Mu’tazila (a\nphilosophical theological school) helped the growth of Arabic science\nthanks to their embrace of Greek natural philosophy. But eventually,\nthe Mu’tazila and their intellectual descendants lost their\ninfluence to more conservative brands of theology.\nAl-Ghazālī’s influential eleventh-century work,\nThe Incoherence of the Philosophers (Tahāfut\nal-falāsifa), was a scathing and sophisticated critique of\nthe Mu’tazila, which argued that their metaphysical assumptions\ncould not be demonstrated. This book vindicated more orthodox Muslim\nreligious views. As Muslim intellectual life became more orthodox, it\nbecame less open to non-Muslim philosophical ideas, which led to the\ndecline of Arabic science. \nThe problem with this narrative is that orthodox worries about\nnon-Islamic knowledge were already present before Al-Ghazālī\nand continued long after his death (Edis 2007: chapter 2). The study\nof law (fiqh) was more stifling for Arabic science than\ndevelopments in theology. The eleventh century saw changes in\nIslamic law that discouraged heterodox thought: lack of orthodoxy\ncould now be regarded as apostasy from Islam (zandaqa) which\nis punishable by death, whereas before, a Muslim could only apostatize\nby an explicit declaration (Griffel 2009: 105). (Al-Ghazālī\nhimself only regarded the violation of three core doctrines as\nzandaqa, statements that challenged monotheism, the prophecy\nof Muḥammad, and resurrection after death.) Given that heterodox\nthoughts could be interpreted as apostasy, this created a stifling\nclimate for Arabic science. In the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury, as science and technology became firmly entrenched in Western\nsociety, Muslim empires were languishing or colonized. Scientific\nideas, such as evolutionary theory, were equated with European\ncolonialism, and thus met with distrust. \nIn spite of this negative association between science and Western\nmodernity, there is an emerging literature on science and religion by\nMuslim scholars (mostly scientists). The physicist Nidhal Guessoum\n(2009) holds that science and religion are not only compatible, but in\nharmony. He rejects the idea of treating the Qurʾān as a\nscientific encyclopedia, something other Muslim authors in the debate\non science and religion tend to do, and he adheres to the\nno-possible-conflict principle, outlined by Ibn Rushd (Averroes):\nthere can be no conflict between God’s word (properly\nunderstood) and God’s work (properly understood). If an apparent\nconflict arises, the Qurʾān may not have been interpreted\ncorrectly. \nWhile the Qurʾān asserts a creation in six days (like the\nHebrew Bible), “day” is often interpreted as a very long\nspan of time, rather than a 24-hour period. As a result, Old Earth\ncreationism is more influential in Islam than Young Earth creationism.\nAdnan Oktar’s Atlas of Creation (published in 2007\nunder the pseudonym Harun Yahya), a glossy coffee table book that\ndraws heavily on Christian Old Earth creationism, has been distributed\nworldwide (Hameed 2008). Since the Qurʾān explicitly\nmentions the special creation of Adam out of clay, most Muslims refuse\nto accept that humans evolved out of hominin ancestors. Nevertheless,\nMuslim scientists such as Guessoum (2009) and Rana Dajani (2015) have\nadvocated acceptance of evolution. \nHinduism, the world’s third largest religion, includes diverse\nreligious and philosophical traditions that emerged on the Indian\nsubcontinent between 500 BCE and 300 CE. The vast majority of Hindus\nlive in India; most others live in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Southeast\nAsia (Hackett 2015). In contrast to the major monotheistic religions,\nHinduism does not draw a sharp distinction between God and creation\n(while there are pantheistic and panentheistic views in Christianity,\nJudaism, and Islam, these are minority positions). Many Hindus believe\nin a personal God, and identify this God as immanent in creation. This\nview has ramifications for the science and religion debate, in that\nthere is no sharp ontological distinction between creator and creature\n(Subbarayappa 2011). Philosophical theology in Hinduism (and other\nIndic religions) is usually referred to as dharma, and religious\ntraditions originating on the Indian subcontinent, including Hinduism,\nJainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are referred to as dharmic religions.\nPhilosophical schools within dharma are referred to as\ndarśana.  \nOne factor that unites dharmic religions is the importance of\nfoundational texts, which were formulated during the Vedic period,\nbetween ca. 1600 and 700 BCE. These include the Véda\n(Vedas), which contain hymns and prescriptions for performing rituals,\nBrāhmaṇa, accompanying liturgical texts, and\nUpaniṣad, metaphysical treatises. The Véda\nappeals to a wide range of gods who personify and embody natural\nphenomena such as fire (Agni) and wind (Vāyu). More gods were\nadded in the following centuries (e.g., Gaṇeśa and\nSati-Parvati in the fourth century CE). Ancient Vedic rituals\nencouraged knowledge of diverse sciences, including astronomy,\nlinguistics, and mathematics. Astronomical knowledge was required to\ndetermine the timing of rituals and the construction of sacrificial\naltars. Linguistics developed out of a need to formalize grammatical\nrules for classical Sanskrit, which was used in rituals. Large public\nofferings also required the construction of elaborate altars, which\nposed geometrical problems and thus led to advances in geometry.\nClassic Vedic texts also frequently used very large numbers, for\ninstance, to denote the age of humanity and the Earth, which required\na system to represent numbers parsimoniously, giving rise to a 10-base\npositional system and a symbolic representation for zero as a\nplaceholder, which would later be imported in other mathematical\ntraditions (Joseph 2000). In this way, ancient Indian dharma\nencouraged the emergence of the sciences. \nAround the sixth–fifth century BCE, the northern part of the\nIndian subcontinent experienced an extensive urbanization. In this\ncontext, medicine became standardized (āyurveda). This\nperiod also gave rise to a wide range of philosophical schools,\nincluding Buddhism, Jainism, and Cārvāka. The latter\ndefended a form of metaphysical naturalism, denying the existence of\ngods or karma. The relationship between science and religion on the\nIndian subcontinent is complex, in part because the dharmic religions\nand philosophical schools are so diverse. For example,\nCārvāka proponents had a strong suspicion of inferential\nbeliefs, and rejected Vedic revelation and supernaturalism in general,\ninstead favoring direct observation as a source of knowledge. Such\nviews were close to philosophical naturalism in modern science, but\nthis school disappeared in the twelfth century.  Natural theology also\nflourished in the pre-colonial period, especially in the Advaita\nVedānta, a darśana that identifies the self, Atman,\nwith ultimate reality, Brahman. Advaita Vedāntin philosopher Adi\nŚaṅkara (fl. first half eighth century) was an author who\nregarded Brahman as the only reality, both the material and the\nefficient cause of the cosmos. He formulated design and cosmological\narguments, drawing on analogies between the world and artifacts: in\nordinary life, we never see non-intelligent agents produce purposive\ndesign, yet the universe is suitable for human life, just like benches\nand pleasure gardens are designed for us. Given that the universe is\nso complex that even an intelligent craftsman cannot comprehend it,\nhow could it have been created by non-intelligent natural forces?\nŚaṅkara concluded that it must have been designed by an\nintelligent creator (C.M. Brown 2008: 108). \nFrom 1757 to 1947, India was under British colonial rule. This had a\nprofound influence on its culture. Hindus came into contact with\nWestern science and technology. For local intellectuals, the contact\nwith Western science presented a challenge: how to assimilate these\nideas with their Hindu beliefs? Mahendrahal Sircar (1833–1904)\nwas one of the first authors to examine evolutionary theory and its\nimplications for Hindu religious beliefs. Sircar was an evolutionary\ntheist, who believed that God used evolution to create the current\nlife forms. Evolutionary theism was not a new hypothesis in Hinduism,\nbut the many lines of empirical evidence Darwin provided for evolution\ngave it a fresh impetus. While Sircar accepted organic evolution\nthrough common descent, he questioned the mechanism of natural\nselection as it was not teleological, which went against his\nevolutionary theism—this was a widespread problem for the\nacceptance of evolutionary theory, one that Christian evolutionary\ntheists also wrestled with (Bowler 2009). He also argued against the\nBritish colonists’ beliefs that Hindus were incapable of\nscientific thought, and encouraged fellow Hindus to engage in science,\nwhich he hoped would help regenerate the Indian nation (C.M. Brown\n2012: chapter 6). \nThe assimilation of Western culture prompted various revivalist\nmovements that sought to reaffirm the cultural value of Hinduism. They\nput forward the idea of a Vedic science, where all scientific findings\nare already prefigured in the Véda and other ancient\ntexts (e.g., Vivekananda 1904). This idea is still popular within\ncontemporary Hinduism, and is quite similar to ideas held by\ncontemporary Muslims, who refer to the Qurʾān as a harbinger\nof scientific theories. Responses to evolutionary theory were as\ndiverse as Christian views on this subject, ranging from creationism\n(denial of evolutionary theory based on a perceived incompatibility\nwith Vedic texts) to acceptance (see C.M. Brown 2012 for a thorough\noverview). Authors such as Dayananda Saraswati (1930–2015)\nrejected evolutionary theory. By contrast, Vivekananda\n(1863–1902), a proponent of the monistic Advaita Vedānta\nenthusiastically endorsed evolutionary theory and argued that it is\nalready prefigured in ancient Vedic texts. More generally, he claimed\nthat Hinduism and science are in harmony: Hinduism is scientific in\nspirit, as is evident from its long history of scientific discovery\n(Vivekananda 1904). Sri Aurobindo Ghose, a yogi and Indian\nnationalist, who was educated in the West, formulated a synthesis of\nevolutionary thought and Hinduism. He interpreted the classic\navatara doctrine, according to which God incarnates into the\nworld repeatedly throughout time, in evolutionary terms. God thus\nappears first as an animal, later as a dwarf, then as a violent man\n(Rama), and then as Buddha, and as Kṛṣṇa. He\nproposed a metaphysical picture where both spiritual evolution\n(reincarnation and avatars) and physical evolution are ultimately a\nmanifestation of God (Brahman). This view of reality as consisting of\nmatter (prakṛti) and consciousness\n(puruṣa) goes back to sāṃkhya, one\nof the orthodox Hindu darśana, but Aurobindo made\nexplicit reference to the divine, calling the process during which the\nsupreme Consciousness dwells in matter involution (Aurobindo,\n1914–18/2005, see C.M. Brown 2007 for discussion). \nDuring the twentieth century, Indian scientists began to gain\nprominence, including C.V. Raman (1888–1970), a Nobel Prize\nwinner in physics, and Satyendra Nath Bose (1894–1974), a\ntheoretical physicist who described the behavior of photons\nstatistically, and who gave his name to bosons. However, these authors\nwere silent on the relationship between their scientific work and\ntheir religious beliefs. By contrast, the mathematician Srinivasa\nRamanujan (1887–1920) was open about his religious beliefs and\ntheir influence on his mathematical work. He claimed that the goddess\nNamagiri helped him to intuit solutions to mathematical problems.\nLikewise, Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858–1937), a theoretical\nphysicist, biologist, biophysicist, botanist, and archaeologist, who\nworked on radio waves, saw the Hindu idea of unity reflected in the\nstudy of nature. He started the Bose institute in Kolkata in 1917, the\nearliest interdisciplinary scientific institute in India (Subbarayappa\n2011). \nCurrent work in the field of science and religion encompasses a wealth\nof topics, including free will, ethics, human nature, and\nconsciousness. Contemporary natural theologians discuss fine-tuning,\nin particular design arguments based on it (e.g., R. Collins 2009),\nthe interpretation of multiverse cosmology, and the significance of\nthe Big Bang. For instance, authors such as Hud Hudson (2013) have\nexplored the idea that God has actualized the best of all possible\nmultiverses. Here follows an overview of two topics that generated\nsubstantial interest and debate over the past decades: divine action\n(and the closely related topic of creation), and human origins. \nBefore scientists developed their views on cosmology and origins of\nthe world, Western cultures already had an elaborate doctrine of\ncreation, based on Biblical texts (e.g., the first three chapters of\nGenesis and the book of Revelation) and the writings of church fathers\nsuch as Augustine. This doctrine of creation has the following\ninterrelated features: first, God created the world ex\nnihilo, i.e., out of nothing. Differently put, God did not need\nany pre-existing materials to make the world, unlike, e.g., the\nDemiurge (from Greek philosophy), who created the world from chaotic,\npre-existing matter. Second, God is distinct from the world; the world\nis not equal to or part of God (contra pantheism or panentheism) or a\n(necessary) emanation of God’s being (contra neoplatonism).\nRather, God created the world freely. This introduces a radical\nasymmetry between creator and creature: the world is radically\ncontingent upon God’s creative act and is also sustained by God,\nwhereas God does not need creation (Jaeger 2012b: 3). Third, the\ndoctrine of creation holds that creation is essentially good (this is\nrepeatedly affirmed in Genesis 1). The world does contain evil, but\nGod does not directly cause this evil to exist. Moreover, God does not\nmerely passively sustain creation, but rather plays an active role in\nit, using special divine actions (e.g., miracles and revelations) to\ncare for creatures. Fourth, God made provisions for the end of the\nworld, and will create a new heaven and earth, in this way eradicating\nevil. \nRelated to the doctrine of creation are views on divine action.\nTheologians commonly draw a distinction between general and special\ndivine action. Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted\ndefinition of these two concepts in the fields of theology or science\nand religion. One way to distinguish them (Wildman 2008: 140) is to\nregard general divine action as the creation and sustenance of\nreality, and special divine action as the collection of specific\nprovidential acts, often at particular times and places, such as\nmiracles and revelations to prophets. Drawing this distinction allows\nfor creatures to be autonomous and indicates that God does not\nmicromanage every detail of creation. Still, the distinction is not\nalways clear-cut, as some phenomena are difficult to classify as\neither general or special divine action. For example, the Roman\nCatholic Eucharist (in which bread and wine become the body and blood\nof Jesus) or some healing miracles outside of scripture seem mundane\nenough to be part of general housekeeping (general divine action), but\nstill seem to involve some form of special intervention on God’s\npart. Alston (1989) makes a related distinction between direct and\nindirect divine acts. God brings about direct acts without the use of\nnatural causes, whereas indirect acts are achieved through natural\ncauses. Using this distinction, there are four possible kinds of\nactions that God could do: God could not act in the world at all, God\ncould act only directly, God could act only indirectly, or God could\nact both directly and indirectly. \nIn the science and religion literature, there are two central\nquestions on creation and divine action. To what extent are the\nChristian doctrine of creation and traditional views of divine action\ncompatible with science? How can these concepts be understood within a\nscientific context, e.g., what does it mean for God to create and act?\nNote that the doctrine of creation says nothing about the age of the\nEarth, nor that it specifies a mode of creation. This allows for a\nwide range of possible views within science and religion, of which\nYoung Earth Creationism is but one that is consistent with scripture.\nIndeed, some scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory, first\nproposed by the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître (1927), look\ncongenial to the doctrine of creation. The theory seems to support\ncreatio ex nihilo as it specifies that the universe\noriginated from an extremely hot and dense state around 13.8 billion\nyears ago (Craig 2003), although some philosophers have argued against\nthe interpretation that the universe has a temporal beginning (e.g.,\nPitts 2008).  \nThe net result of scientific findings since the seventeenth century\nhas been that God was increasingly pushed into the margins. This\nencroachment of science on the territory of religion happened in two\nways: first, scientific findings—in particular from geology and\nevolutionary theory—challenged and replaced biblical accounts of\ncreation. While the doctrine of creation does not contain details of\nthe mode and timing of creation, the Bible was regarded as\nauthoritative. Second, the emerging concept of scientific laws in\nseventeenth- and eighteenth-century physics seemed to leave no room\nfor special divine action. These two challenges will be discussed\nbelow, along with proposed solutions in the contemporary science and\nreligion literature. \nChristian authors have traditionally used the Bible as a source of\nhistorical information. Biblical exegesis of the creation narratives,\nespecially Genesis 1 and 2 (and some other scattered passages, such as\nin the Book of Job), remains fraught with difficulties. Are these\ntexts to be interpreted in a historical, metaphorical, or poetic\nfashion, and what are we to make of the fact that the order of\ncreation differs between these accounts (Harris 2013)? The Anglican\narchbishop James Ussher (1581–1656) used the Bible to date the\nbeginning of creation at 4004 BCE. Although such literalist\ninterpretations of the Biblical creation narratives were not uncommon,\nand are still used by Young Earth creationists today, theologians\nbefore Ussher already offered alternative, non-literalist\nreadings of the biblical materials (e.g., Augustine 416 [2002]). From\nthe seventeenth century onward, the Christian doctrine of creation\ncame under pressure from geology, with findings suggesting that the\nEarth was significantly older than 4004 BCE. From the eighteenth\ncentury on, natural philosophers, such as de Maillet, Lamarck,\nChambers, and Darwin, proposed transmutationist (what would now be\ncalled evolutionary) theories, which seem incompatible with scriptural\ninterpretations of the special creation of species. Following the\npublication of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), there\nhas been an ongoing discussion on how to reinterpret the doctrine of\ncreation in the light of evolutionary theory (e.g., Bowler 2009). \nTed Peters and Martinez Hewlett (2003) have outlined a divine action\nspectrum to clarify the distinct positions about creation and divine\naction in the contemporary science and religion literature. They\ndiscern two dimensions in this spectrum: the degree of divine action\nin the natural world, and the form of causal explanations that relate\ndivine action to natural processes. At one extreme are creationists.\nLike other theists, they believe God has created the world and its\nfundamental laws, and that God occasionally performs special divine\nactions (miracles) that intervene in the fabric of laws. Creationists\ndeny any role of natural selection in the origin of species. Within\ncreationism, there are Old and Young Earth creationism, with the\nformer accepting geology and rejecting evolutionary biology, and the\nlatter rejecting both. Next to creationism is Intelligent Design,\nwhich affirms divine intervention in natural processes. Intelligent\nDesign creationists (e.g., Dembski 1998) believe there is evidence of\nintelligent design in organisms’ irreducible complexity; on the\nbasis of this they infer design and purposiveness (see Kojonen 2016).\nLike other creationists, they deny a significant role for natural\nselection in shaping organic complexity and they affirm an\ninterventionist account of divine action. For political reasons they\ndo not label their intelligent designer as God, as they hope to\ncircumvent the constitutional separation of church and state in the US\nwhich prohibits teaching religious doctrines in public schools\n(Forrest and Gross 2004). \nTheistic evolutionists hold a non-interventionist approach to divine\naction: God creates indirectly, through the laws of nature (e.g.,\nthrough natural selection). For example, the theologian John Haught\n(2000) regards divine providence as self-giving love, and natural\nselection and other natural processes as manifestations of this love,\nas they foster autonomy and independence. While theistic evolutionists\nallow for special divine action, particularly the miracle of the\nIncarnation in Christ (e.g., Deane-Drummond 2009), deists such as\nMichael Corey (1994) think there is only general divine action: God\nhas laid out the laws of nature and lets it run like clockwork without\nfurther interference. Deism is still a long distance from ontological\nmaterialism, the idea that the material world is all there is. \nViews on divine action were influenced by developments in physics and\ntheir philosophical interpretation. In the seventeenth century,\nnatural philosophers, such as Robert Boyle and John Wilkins, developed\na mechanistic view of the world as governed by orderly and lawlike\nprocesses. Laws, understood as immutable and stable, created\ndifficulties for the concept of special divine action (Pannenberg\n2002). How could God act in a world that was determined by laws? \nOne way to regard miracles and other forms of special divine action is\nto see them as actions that somehow suspend or ignore the laws of\nnature. David Hume (1748: 181), for instance, defined a miracle as\n“a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of\nthe deity, or by the interposal of some invisible agent”, and,\nmore recently, Richard Swinburne (1968: 320) defines a miracle as\n“a violation of a law of Nature by a god”. This concept of\ndivine action is commonly labeled interventionist. Interventionism\nregards the world as causally deterministic, so God has to create room\nfor special divine actions. By contrast, non-interventionist forms of\ndivine action (e.g., Murphy 1995, Russell 2006) require a world that\nis, at some level, non-deterministic, so that God can act without\nhaving to suspend or ignore the laws of nature. \nIn the seventeenth century, the explanation of the workings of nature\nin terms of elegant physical laws suggested the ingenuity of a divine\ndesigner. The design argument reached its peak not with William\nPaley’s Natural Theology (1802/2006), which was a late voice\nin the debate on the design argument, but during the seventeenth and\nearly eighteenth century (McGrath 2011). For example, Samuel Clarke\n(cited in Schliesser 2012: 451) proposed an a posteriori\nargument from design by appealing to Newtonian science, calling\nattention to the “exquisite regularity of all the planets’\nmotions without epicycles, stations, retrogradations, or any other\ndeviation or confusion whatsoever”. \nAnother conclusion that the new laws-based physics suggested was that\nthe universe was able to run smoothly without requiring an intervening\nGod. The increasingly deterministic understanding of the universe,\nruled by deterministic causal laws as, for example, outlined by\nPierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), seemed to leave no room for\nspecial divine action, which is a key element of the traditional\nChristian doctrine of creation. Newton resisted interpretations like\nthese in an addendum to the Principia in 1713: the\nplanets’ motions could be explained by laws of gravity, but the\npositions of their orbits, and the positions of the stars—far\nenough apart so as not to influence each other\ngravitationally—required a divine explanation (Schliesser 2012).\nAlston (1989) argued, contra authors such as Polkinghorne (1998), that\nmechanistic, pre-twentieth century physics is compatible with divine\naction and divine free will. Assuming a completely deterministic world\nand divine omniscience, God could set up initial conditions and the\nlaws of nature in such a way as to bring God’s plans about. In\nsuch a mechanistic world, every event is an indirect divine act.  \nAdvances in twentieth-century physics, including the theories of\ngeneral and special relativity, chaos theory, and quantum theory,\noverturned the mechanical clockwork view of creation. In the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century, chaos theory and quantum physics\nhave been explored as possible avenues to reinterpret divine action.\nJohn Polkinghorne (1998) proposed that chaos theory not only presents\nepistemological limits to what we can know about the world, but that\nit also provides the world with an “ontological openness”\nin which God can operate without violating the laws of nature. One\ndifficulty with this model is that it moves from our knowledge of the\nworld to assumptions about how the world is: does chaos theory mean\nthat outcomes are genuinely undetermined, or that we as limited humans\ncannot predict them? Robert Russell (2006) proposed that God acts in\nquantum events. This would allow God to directly act in nature without\nhaving to contravene the laws of nature, and is therefore a\nnon-interventionist model. Since, under the Copenhagen interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, there are no natural efficient causes at the\nquantum level, God is not reduced to a natural cause. Murphy (1995)\noutlined a similar bottom-up model where God acts in the space\nprovided by quantum indeterminacy. These attempts to locate\nGod’s actions either in quantum mechanics or chaos theory, which\nLydia Jaeger (2012a) has termed “physicalism-plus-God”,\nhave met with sharp criticism (e.g., Saunders 2002, Jaeger 2012a,b).\nAfter all, it is not even clear whether quantum theory would allow for\nfree human action, let alone divine action, which we do not know much\nabout (Jaeger 2012a). Next to this, William Carroll (2008), building\non Thomistic philosophy, argues that authors such as Murphy and\nPolkinghorne are making a category mistake: God is not a cause in a\nway creatures are causes, competing with natural causes, and God does\nnot need indeterminacy in order to act in the world. Rather, as\nprimary cause God supports and grounds secondary causes. \nWhile this solution is compatible with determinism (indeed, on this\nview, the precise details of physics do not matter much), it blurs the\ndistinction between general and special divine action. Moreover, the\nIncarnation suggests that the idea of God as a cause among natural\ncauses is not an alien idea in theology, and that God at least\nsometimes acts as a natural cause (Sollereder 2015). \nThere has been a debate on the question to what extent randomness is a\ngenuine feature of creation, and how divine action and chance\ninterrelate. Chance and stochasticity are important features of\nevolutionary theory (the non-random retention of random variations).\nIn a famous thought experiment, Gould (1989) imagined that we could\nrewind the tape of life back to the time of the Burgess Shale (508\nmillion years ago); the chance we would end up with anything like the\npresent-day life forms is vanishingly small. However, Simon Conway\nMorris (2003) has argued species very similar to the ones we know now\n(including human-like intelligent species) would evolve under a broad\nrange of conditions. \nUnder a theist interpretation, randomness could either be a merely\napparent aspect of creation, or a genuine feature. Plantinga suggests\nthat randomness is a physicalist interpretation of the evidence. God\nmay have guided every mutation along the evolutionary process. In this\nway, God could  \nguide the course of evolutionary history by causing the right\nmutations to arise at the right time and preserving the forms of life\nthat lead to the results he intends. (2011: 121)  \nBy contrast, some authors see stochasticity as a genuine design\nfeature, and not just as a physicalist gloss. Their challenge is to\nexplain how divine providence is compatible with genuine randomness.\n(Under a deistic view, one could simply say that God started the\nuniverse off and did not interfere with how it went, but that option\nis not open to the theist, and most authors in the field of science\nand religion are theists, rather than deists.) Elizabeth Johnson\n(1996), using a Thomistic view of divine action, argues that divine\nprovidence and true randomness are compatible: God gives creatures\ntrue causal powers, thus making creation more excellent than if they\nlacked such powers, and random occurrences are also secondary causes;\nchance is a form of divine creativity that creates novelty, variety,\nand freedom. \nOne implication of this view is that God may be a risk taker—although, if God has a providential plan for possible outcomes, there is unpredictability but not risk. Johnson uses metaphors of risk\ntaking that, on the whole, leave the creator in a position of control\n(creation, then, is like jazz improvisation), but it is, to her, a\nrisk nonetheless. Why would God take risks? There are several\nsolutions to this question. The free will theodicy says that a\ncreation that exhibits stochasticity can be truly free and autonomous:\n \nAuthentic love requires freedom, not manipulation. Such freedom is\nbest supplied by the open contingency of evolution, and not by strings\nof divine direction attached to every living creature. (Miller\n1999/2007: 289)  \nThe “only way theodicy” goes a step further, arguing that\na combination of laws and chance is not only the best way, but the\nonly way for God to achieve God’s creative plans (see e.g.,\nSouthgate 2008 for a defense). \nChristianity, Islam, and Judaism have similar creation stories, which\nultimately go back to the first book of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis).\nAccording to Genesis, humans are the result of a special act of\ncreation. Genesis 1 offers an account of the creation of the world in\nsix days, with the creation of human beings on the sixth day. It\nspecifies that humans were created male and female, and that they were\nmade in God’s image. Genesis 2 provides a different order of\ncreation, where God creates humans earlier in the sequence (before\nother animals), and only initially creates a man, later fashioning a\nwoman out of the man’s rib. Islam has a creation narrative\nsimilar to Genesis 2, with Adam being fashioned out of clay. These\nhandcrafted humans are regarded as the ancestors of all living humans\ntoday. Together with Ussher’s chronology, the received view in\nWestern culture until the eighteenth century was that humans were\ncreated only about 6000 years ago, in an act of special creation. \nHumans occupy a privileged position in these creation accounts. In\nChristianity, Judaism, and some strands of Islam, humans are created\nin the image of God (imago Dei). There are at least three\ndifferent ways in which image-bearing is understood (Cortez 2010).\nAccording to the functionalist account, humans are in the image of God\nby virtue of things they do, such as having dominion over nature. The\nstructuralist account emphasizes characteristics that humans uniquely\npossess, such as reason. The relational interpretation sees the image\nas a special relationship between God and humanity. \nHumans also occupy a special place in creation as a result of the\nfall. In Genesis 3, the account of the fall stipulates that the first\nhuman couple lived in the Garden of Eden in a state of innocence\nand/or perfection. By eating from the forbidden fruit of the Tree of\nGood and Evil they fell from this state, and death, manual labor, as\nwell as pain in childbirth were introduced. Moreover, as a result of\nthis so-called “original sin”, the effects of Adam’s\nsin are passed on to every human being; for example, humans have an\ninclination to sin. The Augustinian interpretation of original sin\nalso emphasizes the distorting effects of sin on our reasoning\ncapacities (the so-called noetic effects of sin). As a result of sin,\nour original perceptual and reasoning capacities have been marred.\nThis interpretation is influential in contemporary analytic philosophy\nof religion, for example, Plantinga (2000) appeals to the noetic\neffects of sin to explain religious diversity and unbelief in his\nextended Aquinas/Calvin model, i.e., why not everyone believes in God\neven though this belief would be properly basic. \nWhereas Augustine believed that the prelapsarian state was one of\nperfection, Irenaeus (second century) saw Adam and Eve prior to the\nfall as innocent, like children still in development. He believed that\nthe fall frustrated, but did not obliterate God’s plans for\nhumans to gradually grow spiritually, and that the Incarnation was\nGod’s way to help repair the damage.  \nScientific findings and theories relevant to human origins come from a\nrange of disciplines, in particular geology, paleoanthropology (the\nstudy of ancestral hominins, using fossils and other evidence),\narchaeology, and evolutionary biology. These findings challenge\ntraditional religious accounts of humanity, including the special\ncreation of humanity, the imago Dei, the historical Adam and\nEve, and original sin. \nIn natural philosophy, the dethroning of humanity from its position as\na specially created species predates Darwin and can already be found\nin early transmutationist publications. For example, Benoît de\nMaillet’s posthumously published Telliamed (1749, the\ntitle is his name in reverse)\ntraces the origins of humans and other terrestrial animals from sea\ncreatures. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed chimpanzees as the ancestors\nto humans in his Philosophie Zoologique (1809).\nThe Scottish publisher and\ngeologist Robert Chambers’ anonymously published Vestiges of\nCreation (1844) stirred controversy with its detailed\nnaturalistic account of the origin of species. He proposed that the\nfirst organisms arose through spontaneous generation, and that all\nsubsequent organisms evolved from them. He argued that humans have a\nsingle evolutionary origin: “The probability may now be assumed\nthat the human race sprung from one stock, which was at first in a\nstate of simplicity, if not barbarism” (p. 305), a view starkly\ndifferent from the Augustinian interpretation of humanity in a\nprelapsarian state of perfection.  \nDarwin was initially reluctant to publish on human origins. While he\ndid not discuss human evolution in his Origin of Species, he\npromised, “Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his\nhistory” (1859: 487). Huxley (1863) wrote the first book on\nhuman evolution from a Darwinian point of view, Man’s Place\nin Nature, which discussed fossil evidence, such as the then\nrecently uncovered Neanderthal fossils from Gibraltar. Darwin’s\n(1871) Descent of Man identified Africa as the likely place\nwhere humans originated, and used comparative anatomy to demonstrate\nthat chimpanzees and gorillas were most closely related to humans. In\nthe twentieth century, paleoanthropologists debated whether humans\nseparated from the other great apes (at the time wrongly classified\ninto the paraphyletic group Pongidae) long ago, about 15\nmillion years ago, or relatively recently, about 5 million years ago.\nMolecular clocks—first immune responses (e.g., Sarich and Wilson\n1967), then direct genetic evidence (e.g., Rieux et al.\n2014)—favor the shorter chronology. \nThe discovery of many hominin fossils, including Ardipithecus\nramidus (4.4 million years ago), Australopithecus\nafarensis (nicknamed “Lucy”), about 3.5 million years\nold, the Sima de los Huesos fossils (about 400,000 years old,\nancestors to the Neanderthals), Homo neanderthalensis, and\nthe intriguing Homo floresiensis (small hominins who lived on\nthe island of Flores, Indonesia, dated to 700,000–50,000 years\nago) have created a rich, complex picture of hominin evolution. These\nfinds are now also supplemented by detailed analysis of ancient DNA\nextracted from fossil remains, bringing to light a previously unknown\nspecies of hominin (the Denisovans) who lived in Siberia up to about\n40,000 years ago. Taken together, this evidence indicates that humans\ndid not evolve in a simple linear fashion, but that human evolution\nresembles an intricate branching tree with many dead ends, in line\nwith the evolution of other species. Genetic and fossil evidence\nfavors a relatively recent origin of our species, Homo\nsapiens, in Africa at about 200,000 years ago, with some\ninterbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans (less than 5% of our\nDNA) (see Stringer 2012 for an overview). \nIn the light of these scientific findings, contemporary science and\nreligion authors have reconsidered the questions of human uniqueness\nand imago Dei, the Incarnation, and the historicity of\noriginal sin. Some authors have attempted to reinterpret human\nuniqueness as a number of species-specific cognitive and behavioral\nadaptations. For example, van Huyssteen (2006) considers the ability\nof humans to engage in cultural and symbolic behavior, which became\nprevalent in the Upper Paleolithic, as a key feature of uniquely human\nbehavior. Other theologians have opted to broaden the notion of\nimago Dei. Given what we know about the capacities for\nmorality and reason in non-human animals, Celia Deane-Drummond (2012)\nand Oliver Putz (2009) reject an ontological distinction between\nhumans and non-human animals, and argue for a reconceptualization of\nthe imago Dei to include at least some nonhuman animals.\nJoshua Moritz (2011) raises the question of whether extinct hominin\nspecies, such as Homo neanderthalensis and Homo\nfloresiensis, which co-existed with Homo sapiens for\nsome part of prehistory, partook in the divine image. \nThere is also discussion of how we can understand the Incarnation (the\nbelief that Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, became incarnate)\nwith the evidence we have of human evolution. Some interpret\nChrist’s divine nature quite liberally. For instance, Peacocke\n(1979) regarded Jesus as the point where humanity is perfect for the\nfirst time. Teilhard de Chardin (1971) had a teleological,\nprogressivist interpretation of evolution, according to which Christ\nis the progression and culmination of what evolution has been working\ntoward (even though the historical Jesus lived 2000 years ago).\nAccording to Teilhard, evil is still horrible but no longer\nincomprehensible; it becomes a natural feature of creation—since\nGod chose evolution as his mode of creation, evil arises as an\ninevitable byproduct. Deane-Drummond (2009), however, points out that\nthis interpretation is problematic: Teilhard worked within a\nSpencerian progressivist model of evolution, and he was\nanthropocentric, seeing humanity as the culmination of evolution.\nCurrent evolutionary theory has repudiated the Spencerian\nprogressivist view, and adheres to a stricter Darwinian model.\nDeane-Drummond, who regards human morality as lying on a continuum\nwith the social behavior of other animals, conceptualizes the fall as\na mythical, rather than a historical event. The fall represents\nhumanity’s sharper awareness of moral concerns and its ability\nfor making wrong choices. She regards Christ as incarnate wisdom,\nsituated in a theodrama that plays against the backdrop of an evolving\ncreation. As a human being, Christ is connected to the rest of\ncreation, as we all are, through common descent. By saving us, he\nsaves the whole of creation.  \nDebates on the fall and the historical Adam have centered on how these\nnarratives can be understood in the light of contemporary science. On\nthe face of it, limitations of our cognitive capacities can be\nnaturalistically explained as a result of biological constraints, so\nthere seems little explanatory gain to appeal to the narrative of the\nfall. Some have attempted to interpret the concepts of sin and fall in\nways that are compatible with paleoanthropology. Peter van Inwagen\n(2004), for example, holds that God could have providentially guided\nhominin evolution until there was a tightly-knit community of\nprimates, endowed with reason, language, and free will, and this\ncommunity was in close union with God. At some point in history, these\nhominins somehow abused their free will to distance themselves from\nGod. For van Inwagen, the fall was a fall from perfection, following\nthe Augustinian tradition. John Schneider (2014), on the other hand,\nargues that there is no genetic or paleoanthropological evidence for\nsuch a community of superhuman beings. Helen De Cruz and Johan De\nSmedt (2013) favor an Irenaean, rather than an Augustinian\ninterpretation of the fall narrative, which does not involve a\nhistorical Adam, and emphasizes original innocence as the state that\nhumans had prior to sinning. \nThis final section will look at two examples of work in science and\nreligion that have received attention in the recent literature, and\nthat probably will be important in the coming years: evolutionary\nethics and implications of the cognitive science of religion. Other\nareas of increasing interest include the theistic multiverse,\nconsciousness, artificial intelligence, and transhumanism. \nEven before Darwin formulated his theory of natural selection,\nVictorian authors fretted over the implications of evolutionary theory\nfor morality and religion. The geologist Adam Sedgwick (1845/1890: 84)\nworried that if the transmutationist theory of The Vestiges of\nCreation (Chambers 1844) were true, it would imply that\n“religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base\ninjustice; morality is moonshine”. Evolutionary theorists from\nDarwin (1871) onward argued that human morality is continuous with\nsocial behaviors in nonhuman animals, and that we can explain moral\nsentiments as the result of natural selection. Michael Ruse (e.g.,\nRuse and Wilson 1986) has argued that our belief that morality is\nobjective (moral realism) is an illusion that helps us to cooperate\nbetter. \nContemporary evolutionary ethicists argue that our ability to make\nmoral judgments, which Joyce (2006) terms our “moral\nsense”, is the result of natural selection. This capacity has\nevolutionary precursors in the ability of nonhuman animals to\nempathize, cooperate, reconcile, and engage in fair play (e.g., de\nWaal 2009). Some philosophers (e.g., Street 2006, Joyce 2006) argue\nthat the evolution of the moral sense undermines the purported\nobjective, mind-independent status of moral norms. Since we can\nexplain ethical beliefs and behaviors as a result of their long-term\nfitness consequences, we do not need to invoke ethical realism as an\nexplanation.  \nSome ask whether evolutionary challenges to moral beliefs apply in an\nanalogous way to religious beliefs (see Bergmann and Kain 2014,\nespecially part III). Others have examined whether evolutionary ethics\nmakes appeals to God in ethical matters redundant. John Hare (2004),\nfor example, has argued that this is not the case, because\nevolutionary ethics can only explain why we do things that ultimately\nbenefit us, even if indirectly (e.g., through the mechanisms of kin\nselection and reciprocal altruism). According to Hare (2004),\nevolutionary ethics does not explain our sense of moral obligation\nthat goes beyond biological self-interest, as evolutionary theory\npredicts that we would always rank biological self-interest over moral\nobligations. Therefore, theism provides a more coherent explanation of\nwhy we feel we have to follow up on moral obligations. Intriguingly,\ntheologians and scientists have begun to collaborate in the field of\nevolutionary ethics. For example, the theologian Sarah Coakley has\ncooperated with the mathematician and biologist Martin Nowak to\nunderstand altruism and game theory in a broader theological and\nscientific context (Nowak and Coakley 2013). \nThe cognitive science of religion examines the cognitive basis of\nreligious beliefs. Recent work in the field of science and religion\nhas examined the implications of this research for the justification\nof religious beliefs. De Cruz and De Smedt (2015) propose that\narguments in natural theology are also influenced by evolved cognitive\ndispositions. For example, the design argument may derive its\nintuitive appeal from an evolved, early-developed propensity in humans\nto ascribe purpose and design to objects in their environment. This\ncomplicates natural theological projects, which rely on a distinction\nbetween the origins of a religious belief and their justification\nthrough reasoned argument. \nKelly Clark and Justin L. Barrett (2011) argue that the cognitive\nscience of religion offers the prospect of an empirically-informed\nReidian defense of religious belief. Thomas Reid (1764) proposed that\nwe are justified in holding beliefs that arise from cognitive\nfaculties universally present in humans which give rise to\nspontaneous, non-inferential beliefs. If cognitive scientists are\nright in proposing that belief in God arises naturally from the\nworkings of our minds, we are prima facie justified in believing in\nGod (Clark and Barrett 2011). Ryan Nichols and Robert Callergård\n(2011), however, argue that this defense only works for perceptual\nfaculties, memory, and reliance on testimony, not for the mix of\nculture and evolved biases that constitute religions, as that does not\nform a Reidian faculty. Others (e.g., Visala 2011) claim that the\ncognitive science of religion has neither positive nor negative\nepistemological implications. \nJohn Wilkins and Paul Griffiths (2013) argue that the evolved origins\nof religious beliefs can figure in an evolutionary debunking argument\nagainst religious belief, which they formulate along the lines of Guy\nKahane (2011): \nCausal Premise: S’s belief that p is\ncaused by the evolutionary process X \nEpistemic Premise: The evolutionary process X does not\ntrack the truth of propositions like p \nConclusion: Therefore, S’s belief that p\nis not justified (warranted) \nWilkins and Griffiths (2013) hold that the epistemic premise can\nsometimes be resisted: evolutionary processes do track truth, for\ninstance, in the case of commonsense beliefs and, by extension,\nscientific beliefs. However, they hold that this move does not work\nfor religious and moral beliefs, because such beliefs are assumed not\nto be the result of truth-tracking cognitive processes. Some authors\n(e.g., McCauley 2011) indeed think there is a large difference between\nthe cognitive processes involved in science and in religion, but more\nempirical work has to be done on this front.","contact.mail":"helen.decruz@slu.edu","contact.domain":"slu.edu"}]
