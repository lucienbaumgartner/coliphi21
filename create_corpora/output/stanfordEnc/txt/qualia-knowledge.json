It rests on the idea that someone\nwho has complete physical knowledge about another conscious being\nmight yet lack knowledge about how it feels to have the experiences of\nthat being. It is one of the most discussed arguments against\nphysicalism.\n\nThe Knowledge Argument became the subject of intense philosophical\ndiscussion following its canonical formulation by Frank Jackson\n(1982). However, there are numerous precursors of this argument in the\nliterature. Precursors of the Knowledge Argument typically involve at\nleast one of two strategies which are familiar from Jackson’s\nformulation. The first is to appeal to what Daniel Stoljar & Yujin\nNagasawa term the knowledge intuition: the intuition that no\namount of knowledge of the physical information or physical facts\nconcerning certain experiences can by itself suffice for knowledge of\nwhat these experiences are like, i.e., knowledge of their qualitative\ncharacter or distinctive qualia (2004, 2–3). The second is to\nmake use of thought experiments which are similar to Jackson’s\nfamous example of Mary. These thought-experiments typically involve a\nbeing who has complete knowledge of the physical information or\nphysical facts concerning certain experiences, but who (it is claimed)\nlacks knowledge of what those experiences are like. \nAs examples of the knowledge intuition, Stoljar & Nagasawa cite\npassages by Bertrand Russell (1998, 13–14) and by J.W. Dunne\n(1929). As Dunne puts it, quoting James Ward, physical descriptions\ncannot entail knowledge of what it is that “you immediately\nexperience when you look at a field poppy” (1929, 5). Around the\nsame time as Dunne was writing, C.D. Broad (1925) used a\nthought-experiment as part of an argument against a mechanistic\nversion of physicalism. Broad argues that even if the mechanistic\ntheory of chemistry were true there still would be a property of\nammonia that a mathematical archangel endowed with unlimited\nmathematical skills and “gifted with the further power of\nperceiving the microscopic structure of atoms” could not\npredict, namely its smell: \nUnder the title “The Cognitive Role of Acquaintance,” H.\nFeigl (1958) briefly discusses the epistemic limitations of a Martian\nwho studies human behavior but does not share human sentiments: \nB. A. Farrell had earlier presented a similar thought experiment\nfeaturing a Martian; in this version, it is humans who lack knowledge\nof what it is like for the Martian to exercise his sensory capacities\n(1950, 183; though Farrell ultimately argues that this thought\nexperiment does not present a challenge to physicalism). Paul E.\nMeehl, responding to Feigl, describes two individuals who each have\ncomplete neurophysiological knowledge, one of whom is congenitally\nblind; he takes it as intuitive that this person does not know\nsomething which the other does, namely “what red looks\nlike” (1966, 151). \nMore recent examples from the literature come closer to being versions\nof the Knowledge Argument rather than merely precursors to it. For\nexample, consider the following statement of the knowledge intuition\nby Nicholas Maxwell: \nAnd Howard Robinson, writing the same year as Jackson published\n‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’, describes a deaf scientist\n“who knows everything there is to know about the physical\nprocesses involved in hearing”, but who intuitively does not\nknow what it is like to hear (1982, 4). \nFinally, it is worth mentioning the extremely influential thought\nexperiment described by Thomas Nagel (1974). According to Nagel, the\nphysical facts about an organism and its perceptual systems are\n“objective facts par excellence – the kind that\ncan be observed and understood from many points of view and by\nindividuals with differing perceptual systems” (1974, 442).\nNagel argues that even if we knew all the objective facts about a\nbat’s sonar system, we would still not know what it would be like to\nperceive using this system. Therefore, complete knowledge of the\nphysical facts about a bat’s perceptual system would not yield\nknowledge of certain facts about a bat’s experiences; these facts\ncan only be captured from a subjective perspective. Nagel does not\nargue against physicalism, but rather claims that we presently have no\nunderstanding of how it can be true. In Section 4.9, we shall outline\na related approach to the knowledge argument which interprets it as a\nchallenge not to physicalism but to a position called objectivism. \nFrank Jackson (1982) formulates the intuition underlying his Knowledge\nArgument in a much cited passage using his famous example of the\nneurophysiologist Mary: \nThe argument contained in this passage may be put like this: \n(2) But there is some information about human color vision that she\ndoes not have before her release. \nTherefore \n(3) Not all information is physical information. \nMost authors who discuss the knowledge argument cite the case of Mary,\nbut Frank Jackson used a further example in his seminal article: the\ncase of a person, Fred, who sees a color unknown to normal human\nperceivers. We might want to know what color Fred experiences when\nlooking at things that appear to him in that particular way. It seems\nclear that no amount of knowledge about what happens in his brain and\nabout how color information is processed in his visual system will\nhelp us to find an answer to that question. In both cases cited by\nJackson, an epistemic subject A appears to have no access to\nparticular items of knowledge about a subject B: A\ncannot know that B has an experience of a particular quality\nQ on certain occasions. This particular item of knowledge\nabout B is inaccessible to A because\nA never had experiences of Q herself. \nAs Horgan (1984) points out, talk of ‘physical\ninformation’ in the context of the knowledge argument is\nambiguous between an epistemological and an ontological reading.\n“Physical information” may be interpreted (a) in the sense\nof what Horgan calls ‘explicit physical information’\n(according to Horgan’s proposal a sentence S expresses\nexplicit physical information about certain processes just in case\nS belongs to, or follows from, a theoretically adequate\nphysical account of those processes) or (b) in the sense of\n‘ontologically physical information’ which is explicated\nin Horgan (1984, 150) as follows: a sentence S\n“expresses ontologically physical information about certain\nprocesses just in case (i) all entities referred to or quantified over\nin S are physical entities, and (ii) all the properties and\nrelations expressed by the predicates in S are physical\nproperties and relations.” Presupposing a distinction along\nthese lines one may replace ‘to have all explicit physical\ninformation about x’ by ‘to have complete\nphysical knowledge about x’ and one may replace\n‘to have all ontologically physical information about\nx’ by ‘to know all the physical facts about\nx’. The argument may thus be reformulated in two\ndifferent ways: \n(1a) Mary has complete physical knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision before her release. \n(2a) But there is some kind of knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision that she does not have before her\nrelease. \nTherefore \n(3a) There is some kind of knowledge concerning facts about\nhuman color vision that is non-physical knowledge. \n(V2) The stronger version of the knowledge argument:\n \n(1b) Mary knows all the physical facts concerning human color\nvision before her release. \n(2b) But there are some facts about human color vision that\nMary does not know before her release. \nTherefore \n(3b) There are non-physical facts concerning human color\nvision. \nThe conclusion of the stronger version of the argument (3b) is an\nontological claim that the physicalist must reject. The\nconclusion of the weaker version of the argument is merely an\nepistemological claim that is compatible with denying the existence of\nnon-physical facts. Although Jackson’s original formulation in terms\nof information is open to both interpretations it is clear that the\nsecond stronger version is what he had in mind. \nAs many have pointed out, the result of the weaker version (3a) does\nnot imply the result of the stronger version (3b). That a person has\nincomplete knowledge about a certain topic does not imply without\nfurther assumptions that there is some specific fact she does not have\nknowledge of. The example of knowledge about oneself (de se\nknowledge) may illustrate the general point. Let us suppose that John,\nwho is at t in Amsterdam, does not know that he is now in\nAmsterdam (if asked about his present location he would assert\n“I am now in Venice”). John’s knowledge concerning the\npresent location of people is incomplete. He lacks a specific locating\npiece of de se knowledge. Still, there need not be any fact\nconcerning the location of people that John does not have knowledge\nof. It does not follow from the description of the case that John does\nnot have knowledge of the fact that John is in Amsterdam. John may\nwell know that John is in Amsterdam but, having forgotten that he is\nhimself John, he may fail to conclude that he is now in Amsterdam. If\nJohn finally learns that he is in Amsterdam, he does not thereby learn\na new fact – or so many philosophers would insist – he gains\nnew knowledge of a fact that he already knew in a different way. \nIf – in analogy to the de se case – some physical\nfacts about color vision can be known in two different ways, – in\na ‘physical way’ (under ‘physical concepts’)\nand in some other, non-physical way (under ‘non-physical\nconcepts’), then it is possible to acquire new (non-physical)\nknowledge about a (physical) fact without thereby acquiring knowledge\nof a new fact (the very same fact may have been known before under its\nphysical conceptualization). Many authors accept the weaker version of\nthe argument but reject the stronger one for the reason just sketched:\nthey admit that Mary gains new propositional knowledge but deny that\nshe thereby comes to know facts that she did not know before in some\nother way. (These authors accept the first premise of both versions of\nthe argument and the second premise of the first version as well, but\nthey deny the second premise of the second version and insist that\n(2a) does not imply (2b)). Their position with respect to the\nknowledge argument will be called the New Knowledge/Old\nFact-View (see\n Section 4.6\n below). Others deny even the weaker version V1 and claim that Mary\ndoes not gain any new propositional knowledge (no new knowledge about\nsomething that is the case, no factual knowledge). Their position will\nbe called the No Propositional Knowledge View (see\n Sections 4.3\n and\n 4.5\n below). \nTo locate the different points of disagreement it is helpful to\nformulate the stronger version of the argument more explicitly. \nTherefore \nTherefore (from (P2)): \nTherefore (from (C1) and (C2)): \nOnce C1 and C2 are accepted, there is obviously no way to avoid C3\n(which follows logically from the former two). Moreover, is seems hard\nto deny that it is in principle possible to have complete\nphysical knowledge about human color vision (or about an appropriately\nchosen part thereof). If so, premise P1 should be accepted as an\nappropriate description of a legitimate thought experiment. To avoid\nthe antimaterialist conclusion C3 the physicalist can (a) object\nagainst the inference from P1 to C1 (a minority of philosophers have\nchosen this strategy, see\n Section 4.2\n below) or he or she can avoid C2 by (b) denying premise P2 (this is\nthe strategy chosen by proponents of the No Propositional\nKnowledge View, see Sections\n 4.3\n and\n 4.5\n below) or by (c) blocking the inference from premise P2 to C2 (this\nis the strategy chosen by a majority of physicalist philosophers who\nsubscribe to some version of the New Knowledge/Old Fact View,\nsee\n Section 4.6\n below). \nThe knowledge argument is often cited as one of those anti-physicalist\nqualia-based arguments that are supposed to justify property dualism.\nThe above formulation, however, does not explicitly mention\nnon-physical properties but only non-physical facts. But the relation\nbetween the two claims is obvious. Friends of the knowledge argument\nwill say that the facts at issue are non-physical because\nthey involve the exemplification of non-physical properties (e.g. of\nthe property of having an experience with quality Q). \nIn the assumption that Mary has all physical knowledge (first version)\nor knows all the physical facts (second version)\n“physical” is meant in a very broad sense that includes\nknowledge about (or facts concerning) the functioning of the receptors\nand neurons involved in color vision (biological and physiological\nknowledge/facts) as well as knowledge about (or facts concerning) the\nwhole network of causal relations between processes underlying color\nvision, external stimuli and behavior (functional knowledge/\nfunctional facts). “Physical” knowledge in the broad sense\nat issue even includes psychological knowledge (e.g. knowledge about\nthe result of psychophysical experiments) in so far as they can be\nformulated without use of phenomenal terminology. One might try to\nexplicate “physical knowledge” in the sense at issue in\nroughly the following way: physical knowledge includes all knowledge\nthat is expressible in a terminology that does not contain irreducibly\nmental terms. It would be natural to define physical facts as those\nfacts that can be expressed in this way. But note that this definition\nof ‘physical facts’ begs the question against an objection\nthat has been raised against the knowledge argument (see\n Section 4.2\n below). It is certainly not easy to formulate a precise, adequate and\nnon question-begging account of “physical knowledge” and\n“physical facts” suited for the discussion of the\nknowledge argument. It is, however, quite common to assume that our\nintuitive understanding of “physical knowledge” in the\nbroad sense at issue is clear enough for the purposes of the debate,\nthough some argue that talk of “physical facts” needs\nclarification (see Alter 1998). \nIt is common to formulate Mary’s new knowledge in terms of Thomas\nNagel’s famous locution of knowing what it’s like: Mary does not know\n(while living in her black-and-white environment) what it is like to\nsee colors and she learns what it is like to see colors only after her\nrelease. But this common way to put the point may lead to a confusion\nof (a) mere acquaintance with kinds of color experiences by having and\nremembering them and (b) knowledge about what kind of color experience\nother subjects have at a given occasion, and it may thereby lead to a\nfailure to distinguish two steps of epistemic progress that Jackson’s\nMary takes at once. To see the two steps involved one may consider an\nexample used in Nida-Rümelin (1996) and (1998): Like Mary,\nMarianna first (at t1) lives in a black and white\nenvironment. Contrary to Mary (at a later moment\nt2) she gets acquainted with colors by seeing\narbitrarily colored objects (abstract paintings, red chairs, blue\ntables, etc. but no yellow bananas, no pictures of landscapes with a\nblue sky etc.). Marianna is therefore unable to relate the kinds of\ncolor experiences she now is acquainted with to what she already knew\nabout them at t1. At t2,\nMarianna may wonder which of four slides (a red, a blue, a green and a\nyellow slide) appears to her in the color normal people experience\nwhen looking at the cloudless sky. At t2 Marianna\nknows, in a sense, what it is like to have experiences of red, blue,\netc. But she still lacks the relevant items of knowledge about what\nother people experience: there is a clear sense in which she still may\nnot know that the sky appears blue to normal perceivers, she\nmay even have the false believe that it appears to normal perceivers\nlike the red slide appears to her and thus believe, in a sense, that\nthe sky appears red to normal perceivers. Only at\nt3, when Marianna is finally released and sees the\nsky, does she gain this item of knowledge. One way to describe the two\nsteps of epistemic progress is this: At t2, by\nhaving color experiences, Marianna can form new concepts, she now has\nwhat has been called ‘phenomenal concepts’ of kinds of\ncolor experiences. By acquiring these concepts she acquires the\ncapacity to ask new questions, and to form new (eventually false)\nhypotheses (e.g. about the appearance of the sky to normal\nperceivers). Only at t3 does she acquire the kind\nof knowledge that the knowledge argument is concerned with (knowledge\nthat involves the application of phenomenal concepts) about\nexperiences of other people. \nOnce these two steps are clearly distinguished one may conclude that\nMarianna’s relevant epistemic progress at t3 (and\nMary’s relevant progress after release) is not happily described by\ntalk of knowing what it’s like. Rather, or so one may argue, Mary and\nMarianna acquire a particular kind of belief that the sky\nappears blue to normal perceivers, namely the phenomenal belief that\nit appears blue to normal perceivers, where phenomenal belief involves\nthe application of the appropriate phenomenal concept. Both may have\nbelieved, in a sense (the non-phenomenal sense that does not require\nuse of phenomenal concepts) that the sky appears blue to normal\nperceivers while still in their black-and-white environment (they may\nhave been told so by their friends). (For the distinction between\nphenomenal and non-phenomenal belief see Nida-Rumelin 1996 and\n1998). \nSome authors have raised doubts about the thought experiment itself.\nIt is sometimes pointed out, for example, that merely confining Mary\nto a monochromatic environment would not prevent her from having color\nexperiences (see Thompson 1995, 264) or that, after release, she would\nnot be able to see colors. But the example can be refined to meet\nthese objections. Mary might be monochromatic from birth and changed\ninto a normal perceiver by some medical procedure. It is sometimes\nobjected that already accepted or future results of visual science are\nor might be incompatible with the existence of a Mary-case (a person\nwith monochromatic experience who becomes a normal color perceiver\nlater) or that such results might require (to preserve consistence\nwith visual science) the introduction of so many additional\nassumptions that the conceivability of the example becomes doubtful.\nTo this one might reply that the thought experiment need not be\ncompatible with visual science. If the case of a person with\nmonochromatic vision who turns into a normal perceiver really does\ninvolve serious difficulties for materialism, then the mere fact (if\nit were one) that our visual apparatus excludes the actual existence\nof such a case does not seem to provide a convincing reply for the\nmaterialist. But this point (the relevance or irrelevance of visual\nscience in this context) has not received much discussion in the\nliterature. It has, however, been pointed out (see Graham and Horgan,\n2000, footnote 4 with its reference to Shepard 1993) that at least\npresently available results of color vision science do not exclude a\nMary-case. (The psychologist Knut Nordby was a real life case of a\ncolor vision specialist who was also a complete achromat. See his\npaper ‘Vision in a Complete Achromat: A Personal Account’,\nlinked into in the Other Internet Resources section and Nordby,\n2007.) \nAnother doubt about the thought experiment is raised by the claim that\na person who is confined to a monochromatic environment but knows\neverything physical there is to know about visual color experience\nwould be able to figure out what colored things look like and thus\nwould e.g. be able to imagine the kind of color experience produced in\nnormal perceivers when looking at the cloudless sky during the day\n(see e.g. Dennett 1991; Dennett 2007; Churchland 1989; Maloney 1985,\n36). Probably the most common reaction to this is simply to doubt the\nclaim. But it is not clear that the claim, if correct, would undermine\nthe knowledge argument. The opponent would have to show that complete\nphysical knowledge necessarily involves the capacity to\nimagine blue. One may doubt that this claim is compatible with the\nwidely accepted assumption that physical knowledge can be acquired\nindependently of one’s particular perceptual apparatus. (Arguably a\nsubject whose visual apparatus is not suited for visual experiences at\nall will not be able to develop the capacity to imagine colors on the\nbasis of physical knowledge alone, even if this were true for\nMary). \nSome have argued that Mary would recognize the colors when first\nseeing them on the basis of her complete physical knowledge about\ncolor vision (see Hardin 1992). According to this claim she would\nthink something like “oh, so this is red” when first\nconfronted with a red patch and she could not be fooled by what\nDennett calls ‘the blue banana trick’: when shown a blue\nbanana she would know that it has the wrong color (see Dennett 1991).\nA possible and common response is to simply doubt these claims. But,\nin any case, it is not clear that these claims undermine the knowledge\nargument. One may respond along the following lines: If Mary when\nfirst confronted with red were able to conclude that she is now seeing\nwhat people call red, she thereby acquires a large set of\nnew beliefs about red experiences (that they are produced by\nroses, such-and-such wavelength combinations and so on). On the basis\nof seeing red she (a) acquires a new phenomenal concept of red and (b)\nshe forms new beliefs involving that new concept using her previously\nacquired physical knowledge. But if this description is correct, then\nher previous knowledge was incomplete (for a detailed discussion of\nDennett’s argument involving the blue banana trick see Dale 1995). \nIt may appear obvious that premise P1 (Mary has complete physical\nknowledge about human color vision) implies C1 (Mary knows all the\nphysical facts about human color vision). If all physical facts can be\nknown under some physical conceptualization, then a person who has\ncomplete physical knowledge about a topic knows all the relevant\nphysical facts. But a few philosophers can be understood as objecting\nagainst precisely this apparently unproblematic step. Harman (1990)\nargues that Mary does not know all the functional facts concerning\nhuman color vision because she lacks the concept of what it is for an\nobject to be red, blue, etc. Flanagan (1992) distinguishes\nmetaphysical physicalism from linguistic\nphysicalism. While metaphysical physicalism is the ontological\nclaim that there are no non-physical individuals, properties or\nrelations and no non-physical facts, linguistic physicalism says that\n“everything physical can be expressed or captured in the\nlanguages of the physical sciences.” According to Flanagan\nMary’s case may refute linguistic physicalism but does not refute\nmetaphysical physicalism. Alter (1998) points out that the knowledge\nargument needs the premise that all physical facts can be learned\ndiscursively and argues that this assumption has not been established.\nIt may be argued against this view that it becomes hard to understand\nwhat it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the\nassumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those\nproperties and facts that can be expressed in physical\nterminology. \nTwo different versions of the No Propositional Knowledge-View\nhave been proposed. According to the Ability Hypothesis (most\nprominently defended in Lewis 1983, 1988 and in Nemirow 1980, 1990,\n2007), Mary does not acquire any new propositional knowledge after\nrelease (no knowledge about something that is the case, no factual\nknowledge), but only a bundle of abilities (like the ability to\nimagine, remember and recognize colors or color experiences).\nAccording to the Acquaintance Hypothesis proposed by Conee\n(1994), Mary’s new knowledge after release is what he calls\n“acquaintance knowledge” which is neither propositional\nknowledge nor identical to a bundle of abilities. \nProponents of the Ability Hypothesis presuppose that Mary’s epistemic\nprogress after release consists in the acquisition of knowing what it\nis like (e.g. to have an experience of blue) and they claim that to\nknow what it is like is to have certain practical abilities.\nAccording to Nemirow “knowing what an experience is like is the\nsame as knowing how to imagine having the experience” (1990,\n495). According to Lewis, \nA few years later he writes:  \nBence Nanay suggests that what Mary acquires is the ability to\ndiscriminate between different types of awareness, i.e., to\ndistinguish having or imagining experiences of type E from\nhaving or imagining experiences of other types (2009). \nLewis’s main argument for the Ability Hypothesis can be summarized\nlike this. (1) The only alternative to the Ability Hypothesis is what\nhe calls the Hypothesis of Phenomenal Information (HPI).\n(According to the HPI knowing what it is like is propositional in the\nfollowing sense: coming to know what it is like involves the\nelimination of hitherto open possibilities). (2) The HPI is\nincompatible with physicalism. (3) The Ability Hypothesis is\ncompatible with physicalism and explains everything that may be\nexplained by the HPI. Therefore: The Ability Hypothesis should be\npreferred. \nNote that the Ability Hypothesis is compatible with the view that we\ndo sometimes acquire propositional knowledge on the basis of getting\nacquainted with a new kind of experience from the first person\nperspective. The following remarks by Levin are hard to deny: \nBut, as pointed out by Tye (2000), this does not undermine the Ability\nHypothesis. The Ability Hypothesis implies that there is some\nknowledge that can only be acquired by having experiences of\na particular kind and that this knowledge is nothing but\nknowing-how. This of course does not exclude that there also\nis propositional knowledge that can be acquired by\ngetting acquainted with kinds of experiences from the first person\nperspective. The proponent of the Ability Hypothesis only has to\ninsist that, if there is such propositional knowledge, then\nit need not be acquired on that particular basis but is\naccessible in other ways as well. \nIt has been argued against Nemirow that the ability to imagine having\nan experience of a particular kind is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor knowing what it is like to have that kind of experience. To show\nthat imaginative abilities are not necessary for knowing what it is\nlike, Conee (1994) and Alter (1998) cite the example of a person who\nhas no capacity to imagine having color experiences. They claim that\ndespite this defect she would know what it is like to have an\nexperience of e.g. green while attentively staring at something that\nlooks green to her. To show that imaginative abilities are not\nsufficient for knowing what it is like Conee introduces the following\nexample: A person, Martha, “who is highly skilled at visualizing\nan intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of\nshades that she has experienced…happens not to have any\nfamiliarity with the shade known as cherry red.” Martha is told\nthat cherry red is midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has\nexperienced the latter two shades of red). Given this information and\nher extraordinary capacity, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry\nred, but as long as she does not exercise this ability she\ndoes not know what it is like to see cherry red. \nA similar example is used for the same purpose and discussed in more\ndetail by Raymont 1999. Raymont argues that mnemic, recognitional and\nimaginative abilities neither separately nor conjointly amount to\nknowing of what it is like to have a particular kind of experience. He\nfirst argues that none of these abilities is necessary and sufficient\nfor knowing what it is like: (a) Mnemic abilities are not necessary,\nsince someone can learn what an experience is like when first having\nit without already remembering an experience of the relevant kind. (b)\nImaginative abilities are not sufficient since someone can have the\nability to imagine a particular kind of experience without exercising\nit (see the example cited above). (c) To show that recognitional\nabilities are not sufficient either, Raymont cites empirical data\n“in support of the view that one can have the ability to\nnoninferentially recognize a certain type of visual experience without\never having had it, and thus without knowing what it is like to have\nit”. But then these three kinds of abilities cannot conjointly\namount to knowing what it is like either: if they did,\nthen – contrary to (a) – each of them would have to be a\nnecessary condition for knowing what it is like. \nGertler (1999) argues that the best candidate for an analysis in the\nspirit of the Ability Hypothesis is to identify knowing what it is\nlike to have an experience of red with the ability to recognize\nseeing-red experiences by their phenomenal quality and then goes on to\nattack this candidate: she points out that the ability to recognize\nseeing-red experiences by their phenomenal quality can be explained by\nthe fact that I know what it is like to see red but not vice\n versa.[3] \nMichael Tye (2000) concedes that none of the abilities considered by\nLewis is necessary for knowing what it is like and he discusses the\nfollowing possible revision of the Ability Hypothesis: knowing what it\nis like to have an experience of red is the ability to apply an\nindexical concept to an experience of red (while having it) via\nintrospection. But, he goes on to argue, this revised version can\nagain be rejected by a counterexample that shows that the ability at\nissue is not sufficient for knowing what it is like: If Mary is\ndistracted and does not attend to her experience when she first sees a\nred object, then she need not apply any concept to her experience at\nall. In this case, she still does not know what it is like to have red\nexperiences although she has the ability to apply an\nindexical concept to her present experience (she has the ability, but,\nbeing distracted, she does not exercise it). Tye concedes that the\nrevised version of the Ability Hypothesis could not, anyway, be used\nagainst the knowledge argument in the way that was originally\nintended. The reason is that the revised version is compatible with\nthe view that Mary does acquire knowing-that if she is not distracted\nwhen first seeing something red: she learns that this is a\nred experience (where “this” refers introspectively to her\npresent experience) and so acquires knowing-that. According to Tye to\nhave indexical knowledge of this kind is sufficient but not necessary\nfor knowing what it is like to have a red experience. After all, it is\nimpossible to introspectively refer to a red experience without\npresently having that kind of experience, but Tye wishes to concede\nthat a person can know what it is like to have a red experience while\nnot presently having a red experience. This reasoning motivates his\ndisjunctive account of knowing what it is like: “S\nknows what it is like to undergo experience E iff either\nS now has indexical knowledge-that with respect to E\nobtained via current introspection or S has the Lewis\nabilities with respect to E” (Tye 2000). Tye thus\ndefends the physicalist view against the knowledge argument by a\ncombination of the two strategies mentioned above: he applies the\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact-strategy to the person who knows what\nit is like to have an experience in the sense of the first conjunct\n(the indexical thought at issue is made true by a physical fact) and\nhe applies the No Propositional Knowledge-strategy to the\ncase of someone who has knowing what it is like in the sense of the\nsecond disjunct. \nLycan (1996) argues against the Ability Hypothesis and for the view\nthat Mary acquires new knowledge-that after release by claiming that\n“S knows what it is like to see blue” means\nsomething like “S knows that it is like Q to\nsee blue” where Q names the phenomenal quality at\nissue. It has been objected by Tye (1995) that the use of the qualia\nname “Q” within a propositional attitude context\ncreates the well-known problems: Replacing “Q” by\nanother name “R” for the same quale may change\nthe truth value of the belief ascription. A proponent of Lycan’s view\ncould however respond along the following lines: In the case of qualia\nnames within belief contexts it does not matter which name is used to\nrefer to the quale at issue as long as the belief is meant in the\nsense of a phenomenal belief ascription. “S believes\nthat it is like Q to see blue” means, on the phenomenal\nreading, that S has the relevant belief about Q\nunder a phenomenal concept of Q. Under the assumption that it\nis impossible to have two different phenomenal concepts of one and the\nsame quale, the objection is met: As long as two qualia names\nQ and R refer to the same quale, replacing\nQ by R in an ascription of phenomenal belief cannot\nchange the truth value of the belief ascription. \nAs we have seen, proponents of the Ability Hypothesis assume that the\nknow-how which Mary acquires is distinct from any propositional\nknowledge. This assumption can be challenged, based for example on the\nwork of Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (2001). On this view, for\na subject S to know how to do something (to F) is for\nS to know that there is a way w for S to F,\nand for S to know this under a practical mode of presentation\n(2001, 430). Stanley & Williamson themselves apply this thought to\nLewis’s version of the Ability Hypothesis: \nYuri Cath suggests that this point can be accommodated by proponents\nof the Ability Hypothesis, provided they distinguish between Mary’s\nlearning a new proposition and her coming to be in new state of\npropositional knowledge (2009, 142–143). Specifically, before\nher release Mary can know that w is a way for someone to\nimagine red, but only under a theoretical mode of presentation; after\nher release, she comes to know the same proposition under a practical\nmode of presentation. She thus comes to be in a new state of\npropositional knowledge, but without learning any new\n propositions.[4] \nEarl Conee (1994) proposes another variant of the No Propositional\nKnowledge-View. According to Conee acquaintance constitutes a\nthird category of knowledge that is neither reducible to factual\nknowledge nor to knowing-how and he argues that Mary acquires after\nrelease only acquaintance knowledge. According to Conee knowing\nsomething by acquaintance “requires the person to be familiar\nwith the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a\nperson to be aware of that thing” (1994, 144). Since\n“experiencing a quality is the most direct way to apprehend a\nquality” (Conee 1994, 144), Mary gains acquaintance with color\nqualia only after release. According to the view proposed by Conee the\nphysicalist can defend himself against the knowledge argument in the\nfollowing way: (1) Qualia are physical properties of experiences (and\nexperiences are physical processes). Let Q be such a\nproperty. (2) Mary can know all about Q and she can know that\na given experience has Q before release,\nalthough – before release – she is not acquainted with\nQ. (3) After release Mary gets acquainted with Q,\nbut she does not acquire any new item of propositional knowledge by\ngetting acquainted with Q (in particular she already knew\nunder what conditions normal perceivers have experiences with the\nproperty Q). More recently Michael Tye (2009, 131–137)\ndefends the acquaintance hypothesis as the right answer to the\nknowledge argument thereby abandoning his original response (see below\n4.7). \nA friend of the knowledge argument might concede that a person is\nacquainted with Q only if she has or had an experience with\nproperty Q but he would have to insist that being acquainted\nwith Q in that sense is a necessary condition for being able\nto know (in the relevant sense) that an experience has Q.\nAnother kind of criticism of the Acquaintance Hypothesis is developed\nin Gertler (1999). She argues that the property dualist can explain\nwhy the most direct way to get familiar with a quale is by having an\nexperience of the relevant kind while the physicalist does not have\nany explanation for this particular feature of qualia. Similarly,\nRobert Howell (2007, 146) argues that all other physicalist responses\nto the Knowledge Argument depend upon the Acquaintance Hypothesis, and\nthat acquaintance is incompatible with objectivism (see Section 4.9\nbelow). \nIt is interesting to see that one version of the New Knowledge/Old\nFact View is very similar in spirit to the Acquaintance Hypothesis.\nBigelow and Pargetter (1990) argue that Mary’s progress after release\nconsists in the fact that she now stands in a new acquaintance\nrelation to color qualia, but their theory about the individuation of\nbeliefs implies that she thereby acquires new factual knowledge.\nDifferent beliefs, according to Bigelow and Pargetter, can be\ndistinguished appropriately only if one takes into consideration the\nway the subject is acquainted with the individuals and properties her\nbelief is about (they use the technical term “modes of\nacquaintance” in that context). \nSeveral positive arguments for the view that Mary’s new knowledge\nafter release constitutes propositional knowledge (genuine\ninformation) have been formulated in the literature. Lycan argues, for\nexample, that Mary’s new knowledge goes along with the elimination of\nepistemic possibilities and that her new abilities are best explained\nby her having new information (for further arguments see Lycan 1996,\n92). Loar (1990/1997) points out that the embedded occurrence of\n“feels like such and such” in sentences like\n“if pains feel like such and such then\nQ” cannot be accounted for in a model that treats\nknowing what it is like as mere know-how. McConnell (1994) defends the\nmore radical view that the acquisition of knowing-how is normally\naccompanied by the acquisition of a particular new item of\nknowing-that. \nMany philosophers find it hard to deny that Mary gains new factual\nknowledge after release and for that reason (if they are physicalists)\nfeel attracted by the New Knowledge/Old Fact View. Positions that\nclearly fall into that category are defended in Horgan 1984;\nChurchland 1985; Tye 1986, 1995; Bigelow and Pargetter 1990; Loar\n1990/1997; Lycan 1990a, 1996; Pereboom 1994; Perry 2001; Byrne 2002;\nPapineau 2002, 2007; Van Gulick 2004; Levin 2007; Balog 2012a,\n2012b. \nThe basic ideas common to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View may be\nsummarized as follows: \n(2) To gain knowledge of what it is like to have an experience of a\nparticular phenomenal character requires the acquisition of\nphenomenal concepts of phenomenal\n character.[5] \n(3) What it is for an organism to acquire and possess a phenomenal\nconcept can be fully described in broadly physical terms. \n(4) A subject can acquire and possess phenomenal concepts only if it\nhas or has had experiences of the relevant phenomenal kind. \n(5) After release Mary gains knowledge about phenomenal characters\nunder phenomenal concepts. \nBut the facts that make these new items of knowledge true are physical\nfacts that Mary knew before release under another\nconceptualization. \nThe differences between variants of the New Knowledge/Old Fact View\nconcern the theoretical (physicalist) account of (a) phenomenal\ncharacter, (b) phenomenal concepts of phenomenal characters and (c)\nthe relation between phenomenal characters and the corresponding\nphenomenal concepts. All proponents of the view point out that,\naccording to their proposal, physical concepts and phenomenal concepts\nare cognitively independent: it is impossible to see a priori\nthat something that falls under a physical concept of a\nparticular phenomenal character also falls under the corresponding\nphenomenal concept of that phenomenal character. This is why\nit is possible to have (like Mary) complete physical knowledge about\ne.g. phenomenal blueness (you know everything there is to know about\nphenomenal blueness under its physical conceptualization) without\nhaving a phenomenal concept of blueness and without knowing any of\nthese facts under a phenomenal concept of blueness. Some have argued\nthat the phenomenal conceptualization is not expressible in language\n(see Byrne 2002 and Hellie 2004). \nIn general, if a philosopher A claims that the argument of\nphilosopher B does not go through, it is a point in favor of\nhis view if he can provide an error theory, that is if he can explain\nwhy the argument may appear correct in the first place. The\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact View can claim to have an error theory with\nrespect to the knowledge argument. Given the cognitive independence of\nphysical and phenomenal concepts of blueness it appears as if\nwe could imagine a situation where everything Mary knew before release\nwere fulfilled but not what she came to know after release (and this\ncan be taken to imply that she does come to know new facts).\nBut, according to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View this is an illusion.\nThere is no such possible situation. What Mary learns after release is\nmade true by a physical fact that she already knew before her release.\nSome versions of the New Knowledge/Old Fact-View will be briefly\ndescribed in what follows. \nHorgan (1984) does not provide a developed theoretical account of\nphenomenal concepts but is one of the first to formulate the basic\nintuition shared by most or all proponents of the New Knowledge/Old\nFact View: By having experiences of blue, Mary gets acquainted with\nphenomenal blueness (which is in fact a physical property of\nexperiences) “from the experiential perspective,” she\ngains what he calls “the first person ostensive perspective on\nthat property” (Horgan 1984, 151): she now can refer to\nphenomenal blueness by thinking or saying “that kind of\nproperty” while having, remembering or imagining a blue\nexperience and while attending to its particular quality. She thus has\nacquired a new concept of phenomenal blueness. Using this new\nconcept she can form new beliefs (and acquire new knowledge) about\nphenomenal blueness. Formulated in this way, the view may appear\nsimilar to Conee’s acquaintance account. According to both views,\nMary’s progress consists primarily in getting acquainted with\nphenomenal blueness from an inner perspective. But contrary to Conee’s\nthesis, according to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View, acquaintance\nwith phenomenal blueness from an experiential perspective enables the\nsubject to form a new concept of phenomenal blueness and\nthereby implies the capacity to acquire new beliefs. \nAn example of a more explicit theoretical account of phenomenal\ncharacter, phenomenal content and their relation can be found in Tye\n(1995). He proposes a representationalist account of phenomenal\ncharacter. For a state to have phenomenal character is to represent\ninternal or external physical items in an ‘abstract’ and\nnonconceptual way that is “appropriately poised for use by the\ncognitive system” (see Tye 1995, 137–144). According to\nTye, there are two kinds of phenomenal concepts: indexical concepts\n(an example is the concept applied when thinking of a particular shade\nof red as “this particular hue” while having a red\nexperience) and what he calls “predicative phenomenal\nconcepts” that are based on the capacity to make certain\ndiscriminations. Tye wishes to accommodate the natural intuition that\nMary before release cannot fully understand the nature of phenomenal\nblueness (she doesn’t really know what it is to have a blue\nexperience). One might think that his view is incompatible with the\nintuition at issue. Phenomenal blueness, according to his view, has a\nphysical nature and one might expect that physical natures are fully\ndescribable in physical terms and fully understandable under a\nphysical conceptualization. But Tye has a surprising response:\nalthough phenomenal blueness has a physical nature, a person cannot\nfully understand its nature unless she thinks of phenomenal blueness\nunder a phenomenal concept. \nAnother representationalist view about phenomenal character is\ncombined with the New Knowledge/Old Fact View in Lycan (1990a) and\n(1996). Lycan’s account of Mary’s epistemic progress can be put,\nroughly, like this: Only after release Mary can form\n“introspective second order representations” of her own\ncolor experiences. One may think of an introspective representation as\nof “a token in one of the subject’s languages of thought, his or\nher Introspectorese”. It has often been said that what Mary\nlearns is in some sense “ineffable”, that it cannot be\ncommunicated in public language. Lycan is led to a similar conclusion\nwithin his computational theory. In his view, when Mary finally has an\nexperience of blue she “tokens a semantically primitive mental\nword for the type of first-order state being inwardly sensed”,\nwhere this word in Mary’s language of thought has an\n“inferential and/or conceptual role” that is “unique\nto its subject, in that no other subject could deploy a functionally\nsimilar representation whose designatum was that (the subject’s) very\nsame first-order state-token, ….” And he concludes that\n“the introspective word would certainly not be synonymous with\nany primitive or composite expression of public\nEnglish,…” (Lycan 1996, 101). \nPapineau (1996) distinguishes third person and first person thoughts\nabout experiences. First person thoughts involve the imagination of an\nexperience of the relevant kind. The basic idea may be put like this:\nWhen Mary is finally released and after some time sufficiently\nacquainted with color experiences she can ‘reproduce’ blue\nexperiences in her imagination. These imaginations of experiences of a\nparticular kind can be used to refer to experiences of the kind at\nissue and to think about them. Obviously, Mary could not have first\nperson thoughts about color experiences (she could not use imagined\nblue experiences in order to refer and to think about blue\nexperiences) before she ever had blue experiences. After release, Mary\ncan acquire new beliefs: first person beliefs about blue experiences.\nBut for every such new first person belief about a given kind\nof experience, there will be one of her old third person\nbeliefs which refers to the same kind of experience and has the same\nfactual content. \nAnother way to understand phenomenal concepts is as a species of\nindexical concepts. For instance, Perry (2001) argues that Mary’s new\nknowledge after release does not pose a problem to physicalism any\nmore than indexical thoughts like “I am a philosopher” or\n“today is Sunday” (for a defense of this claim see also\nMcMullen 1985). Perry treats Mary’s new knowledge as a particular case\nof demonstrative belief (and he proposes an account of Mary’s new\nbeliefs after release in terms of his theory of token-reflexive\nthoughts). After release, when seeing the sky, Mary may think\n“Oh, so having blue experiences is like this”\nwhere “this” refers to a physical property (the phenomenal\ncharacter) of her present color experience. She could not have had a\ndemonstrative belief of this kind before release. But, again, the fact\nthat makes the thought true is simply the fact that blue experiences\nhave the particular physical property at issue. Therefore, she does\nnot learn any new fact. \nDoubts about Perry’s proposal have been raised along the following\nlines. In normal cases of demonstrative reference the demonstrated\nobject is in some way given to the epistemic subject (when pointing to\na table and referring to it by “this table”, the object\nmay be given as “the next table left to me”). But what is\nthe way the kind of experience is given to Mary when she thinks of\nphenomenal blueness under the demonstrative concept “this kind\nof experience?” It cannot be the way it feels to have an\nexperience with that property, since this solution, so one may argue,\nintroduces phenomenal characters of phenomenal characters and thus\nreintroduces the original problem. Maybe “the kind of experience\nI am now having” is the appropriate candidate. But there are\nproblems with this proposal too (see Chalmers 2002). There are also\nproblems with suggesting that the demonstrative concept is\n‘thin’, in the sense that it has no reference-fixing mode\nof presentation associated with it (for some of these problems see\nDemircioglu 2013, 263–269). \nRobert Stalnaker (2008) raises further doubts regarding Perry’s\ntreatment of Mary’s new knowledge. Drawing on a distinction between\nthe two stages of Mary’s epistemic progress (see Section 3.3 above),\nhe argues that the cases of acquiring demonstrative beliefs which\nPerry compares with Mary’s new knowledge are akin to the second\nstage of Mary’s progress, but “It is at stage one that the\nproblematic cognitive achievement – the learning ‘what\nit is like’ to see red – takes place” (2008,\n44). \nStalnaker suggests an alternative way in which Mary’s new knowledge\nis demonstrative in character. On this proposal, what Mary acquires is\nessentially contextual information, where “the content of what\nis expressed or believed in a context is not detachable from the\ncontext in which it is expressed or believed” (2008, 81). As an\nexample of such information, Stalnaker describes a bomb disposal\nexpert pointing at the ground and saying “A bomb is buried\nthere, and unless we defuse it now it will explode within five\nminutes” (2008, 85). This information, Stalnaker suggests,\ncannot be known by someone who was not in that situation at that time,\neven if they know the exact co-ordinates of where the bomb is located\nand when it will detonate. Daniel Stoljar (2011) argues that\nphenomenal knowledge is not essentially contextual. In defence of this\nclaim, he suggests there is an important dis-analogy between the\ndifference between Mary, pre- and post-release, and the difference\nbetween the bomb disposal expert and anyone who was not with her when\nshe made her utterance. The thought which the bomb disposal expert\nexpressed in her utterance could not even be entertained by someone\nwho was not present at that time; it is for this reason that someone\nnot there could not know what the expert knew. In contrast, Stoljar\nsuggests that “the fact that post-release Mary learnt could have\nbeen entertained by pre-release Mary (e.g., she can wonder whether it\nobtains)” (2011, 441). This suggests that what Mary learns upon\nrelease is not essentially contextual, at least not in the sense which\nStalnaker has in mind. \nAnother worry about demonstrative accounts is that they do not seem to\ndo duty to the way in which the subjective character itself is present\nto the mind of the thinker when employing a phenomenal concept of that\ncharacter. This worry is sometimes put in terms of acquaintance: the\nspecific way in which the thinker is acquainted with the referent of\nher thought in using phenomenal concepts does not seem to be captured\nby the demonstrative account (see Levine 2007; Howell 2007,\n164–166). Several attempts have been made to answer objections\nof this kind. Papineau (2002) and Balog (2012a) argue that the\ncognitive intimacy to be accounted for is well explained by a\nquotational theory of phenomenal concepts: in thoughts involving\nphenomenal concepts token experiences are used in order to refer to\nthe kind those tokens belong to. Levine (2007) argues that even these\nrefined theories do not account for the specific intimate way in which\nthe thinker is related to the referents of phenomenal concepts.\nContrary to this Levin (2007) does not see any need to\n‘embellish’ the original simple demonstrative account.\nWhile Balog’s current position is an elaborated version of the\nquotational account, Papineau has abandoned the quotational theory and\nargues in Papineau (2007) that phenomenal concepts are special cases\nof perceptual concepts where perceptual concepts do not involve\ndemonstration. \nAn influential view about phenomenal concepts which answers the\nknowledge argument admitting that Mary gains new knowledge but no\nknowledge of new facts is developed in Loar (1990/1997): Phenomenal\nconcepts are recognitional concepts. To have the phenomenal concept of\nblueness is to be able to recognize experiences of blueness while\nhaving them. The recognitional concept of blueness refers\ndirectly to its referent (the physical property of blueness)\nwhere this means (in Loar’s terminology): there is no other\nproperty (no property of that property) involved in the reference\nfixing.  According to Loar’s view the recognitional concept of\nphenomenal blueness refers to the physical property phenomenal\nblueness in virtue of being ‘triggered’ by that\nproperty. It has been doubted that ‘directness’ in\nLoar’s sense provides an account for what one might call\nacquaintance: for the way in which the phenomenal character is present\nto the mind when a thinker employs phenomenal concepts (see Levine\n2007). White (2007) argues against Loar that the account cannot\nexplain the a posteriori character of mind-brain identity statements\nin a satisfying manner. \nAn objection to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View can be made as\nfollows. In standard cases, if a subject does not know a given fact in\none way that it does know in some other way, this can be explained by\ntwo modes of presentation: the subject knows the fact under one mode\nof presentation and does not know it under some other mode of\npresentation. So, for example, a person may know the fact that Venus\nis a planet under the mode of presentation associated with “the\nmorning star is a planet” and fail to know the very same fact\nunder the mode of presentation associated with “the evening star\nis a planet.” In this particular case, as in many others, the\ndifference in the mode of presentation involves two different\nproperties that are used to fix the referent. In one mode of\npresentation Venus is given as the heavenly body visible late in the\nmorning (or some similar property), whereas in the other mode of\npresentation the object is given as the heavenly body visible early in\nthe evening. \nIf the New Knowledge/Old Fact View involves two modes of presentation\nof this sort, then it cannot be used to defend physicalism because\nthis kind of explanation of the supposed double epistemic access to\nfacts concerning phenomenal types would reintroduce non-physical\nproperties at a higher level: the subject would have to be described\nas referring to the phenomenal type at issue by some physical property\nin case it believes the relevant fact under its physical mode of\npresentation and as referring to that phenomenal type by some\nnon-physical property in case it believes the relevant fact under its\nphenomenal mode of presentation. \nIt has been argued by several authors that the different modes of\npresentation at issue in the case of beliefs about phenomenal states\ndo involve the introduction of different reference-fixing properties\nand that therefore the proposal is unsuccessful. Arguments of that\nkind are found in Lockwood (1989, chap. 8) and McConnell (1994). White\n(2007) develops the objection in detail. Block (2007) gives a detailed\nanswer to White (2007) based on a distinction between what he labels\ncognitive and metaphysical modes of presentation. Chalmers (1996,\n2002, 2010) makes a similar point as White (2007) using his framework\nof primary and secondary intensions. In that framework, primary\nintensions describe the way a concept picks out its referent in the\nactual world and the cognitive independence of phenomenal and physical\nconcepts is explained by their different primary intensions. If one\nsingular fact can be known under a physical mode of presentation as\nwell as under a phenomenal mode of presentation, then the two items of\nknowledge involve two concepts (a phenomenal and a physical concept)\nwith different primary intensions and these different primary\nintensions correspond to different properties. \nA two-dimensional framework is used in a different manner in\nNida-Rümelin (2007) to develop the idea that the nature of\nphenomenal properties is present to the mind of the thinker when using\nphenomenal properties – an idea which leads to the result that the\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact View is mistaken. This idea is also suggested\nby Philip Goff (2017). He suggests that the knowledge argument does\nnot by itself refute physicalism because it does not overcome the New\nKnowledge/Old Fact View. However, things are different if the\nphenomenal concept which Mary acquires is transparent (i.e.,\nit reveals the nature or essence of the phenomenal property which\nsatisfies it): \nA general argument against the materialist strategy of appealing to\nphenomenal concepts is developed in Chalmers (2004; 2007); for\ncritical discussion see Balog (2012b).  \nAnyone who wishes to argue in the way just mentioned, that the two\nmodes of presentation do involve the introduction of two different\nreference-fixing properties, must deal with Loar’s proposal (see 4.7).\nLoar avoids the problem of two reference fixing properties by his\nclaim that phenomenal concepts refer directly to their referent. It\nhas been argued against Loar that his causal account of how phenomenal\nconcepts manage to directly refer to their referent (namely by being\ntriggered by them) cannot appropriately describe the particular\ncognitive role of phenomenal concepts (see McConnell 1994 and White\n2007). \nA final issue concerning both the New Knowledge/Old Facts View and the\nknowledge argument itself is whether there are any phenomenal\nconcepts. Derek Ball (2009) and Michael Tye (2009) argue that there\nare no such concepts, at least as defined above: in particular, both\ndeny claim (4) outlined in Section 4.6, that a subject can possess\nphenomenal concepts only if it has or has had experiences of the\nrelevant kind. Ball and Tye appeal to work on social externalism\nregarding the content of our concepts to argue that even prior to her\nrelease, Mary possesses the same concepts which she uses to think\nabout her experiences after her release. Specifically, she possesses\nsuch concepts ‘deferentially’, in virtue of interacting\nwith her linguistic community; a crucial part of social externalism\nabout content is that one can possess concepts deferentially even\nthough one is largely ignorant of the nature of what satisfies these\nconcepts (Ball 2009, 947–954; Tye 2009,\n 63–70).[6]\n This result threatens to undermine the New Knowledge / Old Facts\nView, but Ball suggests it also undermines the knowledge argument\nitself, since the knowledge argument itself depends on there being\nphenomenal concepts (2009, 940–943). \nTorin Alter (2013) responds to these arguments by focusing on the\ndistinction between deferential and non-deferential concept possession\n(the latter is conceptual mastery). He suggests that it is\nmastery of phenomenal concepts rather than mere deferential possession\nwhich matters for the knowledge argument: “Mary makes epistemic\nprogress when she leaves the room because she comes to master or\nnon-deferentially possess phenomenal colour concepts” (2013,\n486). And defenders of the knowledge argument can claim that mastery\nof a phenomenal concept requires actually having experiences with the\nrelevant phenomenal character. \nThe Knowledge Argument has traditionally been understood as an\nargument against physicalism or perhaps against reductive versions of\nphysicalism. But an influential alternative approach sees the argument\nas working not against physicalism per se, but against a different\nposition which can be termed\n objectivism.[7]\n Objectivism is the view that an objective description of what exists\ncan be complete; that there are no aspects of reality which can only\nbe understood by having experiences of a specific type. This notion is\nclosely related to Nagel’s characterization of the physical nature\nof organisms as “a domain of objective facts par\nexcellence – the kind that can be observed and understood\nfrom many points of view and by individuals with differing perceptual\nsystems” (1974, 442). On this view, the point of Jackson’s\nthought experiment is to bring out that Mary learns something which\ncan only be known by having an experience of a certain kind (e.g., a\nperceptual experience). If this is correct, then this shows that no\nobjective description of what exist can be complete. As Howell\nformulates it, the argument understood in this way runs as\nfollows: \nA number of proponents of this interpretation of the Knowledge\nArgument suggest that it is compatible with a specific form of\nphysicalism, on which all facts are physical or metaphysically\nnecessitated by microphysical facts but some facts can only be\nunderstood by having specific experiences (see, e.g., Kallestrup 2006;\nHowell 2007; for slightly different formulations see Crane 2003; Zhao\n2012). That said, it is worth asking how the ‘physical’ is\nto be understood, such that facts which can only be known if one has\ncertain experiences can count as physical. Furthermore, it is worth\nquestioning whether a view on which facts are either physical or\nmetaphysically necessitated by microphysical facts thereby counts as a\nform of physicalism. It has been argued that such a view is compatible\nwith non-physicalist positions such as emergentism or certain forms of\nethical non-naturalism (see Horgan 1993, 559-566; 2010, 311-314; Crane\n2010; for discussion see Stoljar 2017, section 9). \nThere has not been much discussion of the knowledge argument from a\ndualist perspective. This is unsurprising given the small number of\ncontemporary philosophers who defend a dualist position (for a\nprominent exception see Chalmers (1996); the knowledge argument is\ndiscussed on pp. 140–146). There are two possible strategies for\na dualist to take who wishes to defend the knowledge argument. The\nfirst is merely defensive or ‘destructive’ in that it\ntries to refute the positive theoretical proposals one by one that\nhave been used by physicalists in their objections against the\nknowledge argument. The second is more ‘constructive’ in\nthat it aims at developing an alternative positive dualist account of\nphenomenal concepts, phenomenal properties and their relations such\nthat on that account Mary does learn new and nonphysical facts upon\nrelease. Examples (or partial examples) for the first strategy may\noccasionally be found in the literature (compare Warner 1986, Gertler\n1999, Raymont 1995, 1999 and Connell 1994). Examples for the second\nare hard to find, but Chalmers (1996, 2002) and Nida-Rümelin\n(2007) exemplify the second strategy. Using his framework of primary\nand secondary intensions he develops a positive account of what he\ncalls “pure phenomenal concepts” that can be described as\nincorporating the old and natural intuition that in the case of qualia\n(phenomenal characters) there is no distinction between appearance and\nreality, in other words: qualia ‘reveal their nature’ in\nexperience. \nThe intuitive idea just mentioned has been expressed in different\nways. Some say that qualia ‘have no hidden sides’. Others\nsay that qualia are not natural kind terms in that it is not\nup to the sciences to tell us what having an experience of a\nparticular kind amounts to (we know what it amounts to by having them\nand attending to the quality at issue). It is quite clear that an\naccount of this intuitive idea has to be one of the ingredients of a\ndualist defense of the knowledge argument. Nida-Rümelin (2007)\ndevelops a technical notion of grasping properties which is intended\nto serve the purposes of dualists who argue against materialism using\nthe assumption that in the special case of phenomenal concepts the\nrelation that the thinker bears to the property he conceptualizes is\nmore intimate than in other cases: the thinker understands what having\nthe property essentially consists in. This idea can be used to block\nfamiliar objections to the knowledge argument in particular those\nfalling into the Old fact/ New Knowledge category. A similar basic\nidea but formulated within a different theoretical framework is\nelaborated in Stephen White (2007).  \nAccording to mainstream opinion the most serious problem for property\ndualism is the danger of being driven into epiphenomenalism. If\nphenomenal characters are non-physical properties and if every\nphysical event has a physical cause and if we exclude the possibility\nof overdetermination (where something is caused by two different\ncauses that are both sufficient), then, arguably, whether or not a\nstate has a particular phenomenal character cannot have any causal\nrelevance. But if qualia are causally impotent, how can a person know\nthat she has an experience with a particular phenomenal character?\nMany take it to be obvious that a person cannot know that she now has\na blue experience unless her blue experience plays a prominent causal\nrole in the formation of her belief at issue. This particular problem\nhas been formulated as an objection against the knowledge argument in\nWatkins (1989). Until some time ago Jackson was one of the very few\nphilosophers who embraced epiphenomenalism. But Jackson changed his\nmind. Jackson (1995) argues that knowledge about qualia is impossible\nif qualia are epiphenomenal and he concludes that something must be\nwrong with the knowledge argument. In Jackson (2003) and Jackson\n(2007) he argues that the argument goes wrong in presupposing a false\nview about sensory experience and that it can be answered by endorsing\nstrong representationalism: the view that to be in a phenomenal state\nis to represent objective properties where the properties represented\nas well as the representing itself can be given a physicalist account.\nJackson admits that there is a specific phenomenal way of representing\nbut he now insists that the phenomenal way of representing can be\naccounted for in physicalist terms. Doubts about the latter claim are\ndeveloped in Alter (2007). Other possible reactions to the threat of\nepiphenomenalism for dualism would be either to doubt that a property\ndualist must embrace epiphenomenalism or to develop an account of\nknowledge about one’s own phenomenal states that does not imply a\ncausal relation between qualia and phenomenal knowledge about qualia\n(see Chalmers 2002). \nThe appropriate evaluation of the knowledge argument remains\ncontroversial. The acceptability of its second premise P2 (Mary lacks\nfactual knowledge before release) and of the inferences from P1 (Mary\nhas complete physical knowledge before release) to C1 (Mary knows all\nthe physical facts) and from P2 to C2 (Mary does not know some facts\nbefore release) depend on quite technical and controversial issues\nabout (a) the appropriate theory of property concepts and their\nrelation to the properties they express and (b) the appropriate theory\nof belief content. It is therefore safe to predict that the discussion\nabout the knowledge argument will not come to an end in the near\nfuture.","contact.mail":"martine.nida-ruemelin@unifr.ch","contact.domain":"unifr.ch"},{"date.published":"2002-09-03","date.changed":"2019-09-23","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/","author1":"Martine Nida-Rümelin","author2":"Donnchadh O Conaill","entry":"qualia-knowledge","body.text":"\n\n\nThe knowledge argument aims to establish that conscious experience\ninvolves non-physical properties. It rests on the idea that someone\nwho has complete physical knowledge about another conscious being\nmight yet lack knowledge about how it feels to have the experiences of\nthat being. It is one of the most discussed arguments against\nphysicalism.\n\nThe Knowledge Argument became the subject of intense philosophical\ndiscussion following its canonical formulation by Frank Jackson\n(1982). However, there are numerous precursors of this argument in the\nliterature. Precursors of the Knowledge Argument typically involve at\nleast one of two strategies which are familiar from Jackson’s\nformulation. The first is to appeal to what Daniel Stoljar & Yujin\nNagasawa term the knowledge intuition: the intuition that no\namount of knowledge of the physical information or physical facts\nconcerning certain experiences can by itself suffice for knowledge of\nwhat these experiences are like, i.e., knowledge of their qualitative\ncharacter or distinctive qualia (2004, 2–3). The second is to\nmake use of thought experiments which are similar to Jackson’s\nfamous example of Mary. These thought-experiments typically involve a\nbeing who has complete knowledge of the physical information or\nphysical facts concerning certain experiences, but who (it is claimed)\nlacks knowledge of what those experiences are like. \nAs examples of the knowledge intuition, Stoljar & Nagasawa cite\npassages by Bertrand Russell (1998, 13–14) and by J.W. Dunne\n(1929). As Dunne puts it, quoting James Ward, physical descriptions\ncannot entail knowledge of what it is that “you immediately\nexperience when you look at a field poppy” (1929, 5). Around the\nsame time as Dunne was writing, C.D. Broad (1925) used a\nthought-experiment as part of an argument against a mechanistic\nversion of physicalism. Broad argues that even if the mechanistic\ntheory of chemistry were true there still would be a property of\nammonia that a mathematical archangel endowed with unlimited\nmathematical skills and “gifted with the further power of\nperceiving the microscopic structure of atoms” could not\npredict, namely its smell: \nUnder the title “The Cognitive Role of Acquaintance,” H.\nFeigl (1958) briefly discusses the epistemic limitations of a Martian\nwho studies human behavior but does not share human sentiments: \nB. A. Farrell had earlier presented a similar thought experiment\nfeaturing a Martian; in this version, it is humans who lack knowledge\nof what it is like for the Martian to exercise his sensory capacities\n(1950, 183; though Farrell ultimately argues that this thought\nexperiment does not present a challenge to physicalism). Paul E.\nMeehl, responding to Feigl, describes two individuals who each have\ncomplete neurophysiological knowledge, one of whom is congenitally\nblind; he takes it as intuitive that this person does not know\nsomething which the other does, namely “what red looks\nlike” (1966, 151). \nMore recent examples from the literature come closer to being versions\nof the Knowledge Argument rather than merely precursors to it. For\nexample, consider the following statement of the knowledge intuition\nby Nicholas Maxwell: \nAnd Howard Robinson, writing the same year as Jackson published\n‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’, describes a deaf scientist\n“who knows everything there is to know about the physical\nprocesses involved in hearing”, but who intuitively does not\nknow what it is like to hear (1982, 4). \nFinally, it is worth mentioning the extremely influential thought\nexperiment described by Thomas Nagel (1974). According to Nagel, the\nphysical facts about an organism and its perceptual systems are\n“objective facts par excellence – the kind that\ncan be observed and understood from many points of view and by\nindividuals with differing perceptual systems” (1974, 442).\nNagel argues that even if we knew all the objective facts about a\nbat’s sonar system, we would still not know what it would be like to\nperceive using this system. Therefore, complete knowledge of the\nphysical facts about a bat’s perceptual system would not yield\nknowledge of certain facts about a bat’s experiences; these facts\ncan only be captured from a subjective perspective. Nagel does not\nargue against physicalism, but rather claims that we presently have no\nunderstanding of how it can be true. In Section 4.9, we shall outline\na related approach to the knowledge argument which interprets it as a\nchallenge not to physicalism but to a position called objectivism. \nFrank Jackson (1982) formulates the intuition underlying his Knowledge\nArgument in a much cited passage using his famous example of the\nneurophysiologist Mary: \nThe argument contained in this passage may be put like this: \n(2) But there is some information about human color vision that she\ndoes not have before her release. \nTherefore \n(3) Not all information is physical information. \nMost authors who discuss the knowledge argument cite the case of Mary,\nbut Frank Jackson used a further example in his seminal article: the\ncase of a person, Fred, who sees a color unknown to normal human\nperceivers. We might want to know what color Fred experiences when\nlooking at things that appear to him in that particular way. It seems\nclear that no amount of knowledge about what happens in his brain and\nabout how color information is processed in his visual system will\nhelp us to find an answer to that question. In both cases cited by\nJackson, an epistemic subject A appears to have no access to\nparticular items of knowledge about a subject B: A\ncannot know that B has an experience of a particular quality\nQ on certain occasions. This particular item of knowledge\nabout B is inaccessible to A because\nA never had experiences of Q herself. \nAs Horgan (1984) points out, talk of ‘physical\ninformation’ in the context of the knowledge argument is\nambiguous between an epistemological and an ontological reading.\n“Physical information” may be interpreted (a) in the sense\nof what Horgan calls ‘explicit physical information’\n(according to Horgan’s proposal a sentence S expresses\nexplicit physical information about certain processes just in case\nS belongs to, or follows from, a theoretically adequate\nphysical account of those processes) or (b) in the sense of\n‘ontologically physical information’ which is explicated\nin Horgan (1984, 150) as follows: a sentence S\n“expresses ontologically physical information about certain\nprocesses just in case (i) all entities referred to or quantified over\nin S are physical entities, and (ii) all the properties and\nrelations expressed by the predicates in S are physical\nproperties and relations.” Presupposing a distinction along\nthese lines one may replace ‘to have all explicit physical\ninformation about x’ by ‘to have complete\nphysical knowledge about x’ and one may replace\n‘to have all ontologically physical information about\nx’ by ‘to know all the physical facts about\nx’. The argument may thus be reformulated in two\ndifferent ways: \n(1a) Mary has complete physical knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision before her release. \n(2a) But there is some kind of knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision that she does not have before her\nrelease. \nTherefore \n(3a) There is some kind of knowledge concerning facts about\nhuman color vision that is non-physical knowledge. \n(V2) The stronger version of the knowledge argument:\n \n(1b) Mary knows all the physical facts concerning human color\nvision before her release. \n(2b) But there are some facts about human color vision that\nMary does not know before her release. \nTherefore \n(3b) There are non-physical facts concerning human color\nvision. \nThe conclusion of the stronger version of the argument (3b) is an\nontological claim that the physicalist must reject. The\nconclusion of the weaker version of the argument is merely an\nepistemological claim that is compatible with denying the existence of\nnon-physical facts. Although Jackson’s original formulation in terms\nof information is open to both interpretations it is clear that the\nsecond stronger version is what he had in mind. \nAs many have pointed out, the result of the weaker version (3a) does\nnot imply the result of the stronger version (3b). That a person has\nincomplete knowledge about a certain topic does not imply without\nfurther assumptions that there is some specific fact she does not have\nknowledge of. The example of knowledge about oneself (de se\nknowledge) may illustrate the general point. Let us suppose that John,\nwho is at t in Amsterdam, does not know that he is now in\nAmsterdam (if asked about his present location he would assert\n“I am now in Venice”). John’s knowledge concerning the\npresent location of people is incomplete. He lacks a specific locating\npiece of de se knowledge. Still, there need not be any fact\nconcerning the location of people that John does not have knowledge\nof. It does not follow from the description of the case that John does\nnot have knowledge of the fact that John is in Amsterdam. John may\nwell know that John is in Amsterdam but, having forgotten that he is\nhimself John, he may fail to conclude that he is now in Amsterdam. If\nJohn finally learns that he is in Amsterdam, he does not thereby learn\na new fact – or so many philosophers would insist – he gains\nnew knowledge of a fact that he already knew in a different way. \nIf – in analogy to the de se case – some physical\nfacts about color vision can be known in two different ways, – in\na ‘physical way’ (under ‘physical concepts’)\nand in some other, non-physical way (under ‘non-physical\nconcepts’), then it is possible to acquire new (non-physical)\nknowledge about a (physical) fact without thereby acquiring knowledge\nof a new fact (the very same fact may have been known before under its\nphysical conceptualization). Many authors accept the weaker version of\nthe argument but reject the stronger one for the reason just sketched:\nthey admit that Mary gains new propositional knowledge but deny that\nshe thereby comes to know facts that she did not know before in some\nother way. (These authors accept the first premise of both versions of\nthe argument and the second premise of the first version as well, but\nthey deny the second premise of the second version and insist that\n(2a) does not imply (2b)). Their position with respect to the\nknowledge argument will be called the New Knowledge/Old\nFact-View (see\n Section 4.6\n below). Others deny even the weaker version V1 and claim that Mary\ndoes not gain any new propositional knowledge (no new knowledge about\nsomething that is the case, no factual knowledge). Their position will\nbe called the No Propositional Knowledge View (see\n Sections 4.3\n and\n 4.5\n below). \nTo locate the different points of disagreement it is helpful to\nformulate the stronger version of the argument more explicitly. \nTherefore \nTherefore (from (P2)): \nTherefore (from (C1) and (C2)): \nOnce C1 and C2 are accepted, there is obviously no way to avoid C3\n(which follows logically from the former two). Moreover, is seems hard\nto deny that it is in principle possible to have complete\nphysical knowledge about human color vision (or about an appropriately\nchosen part thereof). If so, premise P1 should be accepted as an\nappropriate description of a legitimate thought experiment. To avoid\nthe antimaterialist conclusion C3 the physicalist can (a) object\nagainst the inference from P1 to C1 (a minority of philosophers have\nchosen this strategy, see\n Section 4.2\n below) or he or she can avoid C2 by (b) denying premise P2 (this is\nthe strategy chosen by proponents of the No Propositional\nKnowledge View, see Sections\n 4.3\n and\n 4.5\n below) or by (c) blocking the inference from premise P2 to C2 (this\nis the strategy chosen by a majority of physicalist philosophers who\nsubscribe to some version of the New Knowledge/Old Fact View,\nsee\n Section 4.6\n below). \nThe knowledge argument is often cited as one of those anti-physicalist\nqualia-based arguments that are supposed to justify property dualism.\nThe above formulation, however, does not explicitly mention\nnon-physical properties but only non-physical facts. But the relation\nbetween the two claims is obvious. Friends of the knowledge argument\nwill say that the facts at issue are non-physical because\nthey involve the exemplification of non-physical properties (e.g. of\nthe property of having an experience with quality Q). \nIn the assumption that Mary has all physical knowledge (first version)\nor knows all the physical facts (second version)\n“physical” is meant in a very broad sense that includes\nknowledge about (or facts concerning) the functioning of the receptors\nand neurons involved in color vision (biological and physiological\nknowledge/facts) as well as knowledge about (or facts concerning) the\nwhole network of causal relations between processes underlying color\nvision, external stimuli and behavior (functional knowledge/\nfunctional facts). “Physical” knowledge in the broad sense\nat issue even includes psychological knowledge (e.g. knowledge about\nthe result of psychophysical experiments) in so far as they can be\nformulated without use of phenomenal terminology. One might try to\nexplicate “physical knowledge” in the sense at issue in\nroughly the following way: physical knowledge includes all knowledge\nthat is expressible in a terminology that does not contain irreducibly\nmental terms. It would be natural to define physical facts as those\nfacts that can be expressed in this way. But note that this definition\nof ‘physical facts’ begs the question against an objection\nthat has been raised against the knowledge argument (see\n Section 4.2\n below). It is certainly not easy to formulate a precise, adequate and\nnon question-begging account of “physical knowledge” and\n“physical facts” suited for the discussion of the\nknowledge argument. It is, however, quite common to assume that our\nintuitive understanding of “physical knowledge” in the\nbroad sense at issue is clear enough for the purposes of the debate,\nthough some argue that talk of “physical facts” needs\nclarification (see Alter 1998). \nIt is common to formulate Mary’s new knowledge in terms of Thomas\nNagel’s famous locution of knowing what it’s like: Mary does not know\n(while living in her black-and-white environment) what it is like to\nsee colors and she learns what it is like to see colors only after her\nrelease. But this common way to put the point may lead to a confusion\nof (a) mere acquaintance with kinds of color experiences by having and\nremembering them and (b) knowledge about what kind of color experience\nother subjects have at a given occasion, and it may thereby lead to a\nfailure to distinguish two steps of epistemic progress that Jackson’s\nMary takes at once. To see the two steps involved one may consider an\nexample used in Nida-Rümelin (1996) and (1998): Like Mary,\nMarianna first (at t1) lives in a black and white\nenvironment. Contrary to Mary (at a later moment\nt2) she gets acquainted with colors by seeing\narbitrarily colored objects (abstract paintings, red chairs, blue\ntables, etc. but no yellow bananas, no pictures of landscapes with a\nblue sky etc.). Marianna is therefore unable to relate the kinds of\ncolor experiences she now is acquainted with to what she already knew\nabout them at t1. At t2,\nMarianna may wonder which of four slides (a red, a blue, a green and a\nyellow slide) appears to her in the color normal people experience\nwhen looking at the cloudless sky. At t2 Marianna\nknows, in a sense, what it is like to have experiences of red, blue,\netc. But she still lacks the relevant items of knowledge about what\nother people experience: there is a clear sense in which she still may\nnot know that the sky appears blue to normal perceivers, she\nmay even have the false believe that it appears to normal perceivers\nlike the red slide appears to her and thus believe, in a sense, that\nthe sky appears red to normal perceivers. Only at\nt3, when Marianna is finally released and sees the\nsky, does she gain this item of knowledge. One way to describe the two\nsteps of epistemic progress is this: At t2, by\nhaving color experiences, Marianna can form new concepts, she now has\nwhat has been called ‘phenomenal concepts’ of kinds of\ncolor experiences. By acquiring these concepts she acquires the\ncapacity to ask new questions, and to form new (eventually false)\nhypotheses (e.g. about the appearance of the sky to normal\nperceivers). Only at t3 does she acquire the kind\nof knowledge that the knowledge argument is concerned with (knowledge\nthat involves the application of phenomenal concepts) about\nexperiences of other people. \nOnce these two steps are clearly distinguished one may conclude that\nMarianna’s relevant epistemic progress at t3 (and\nMary’s relevant progress after release) is not happily described by\ntalk of knowing what it’s like. Rather, or so one may argue, Mary and\nMarianna acquire a particular kind of belief that the sky\nappears blue to normal perceivers, namely the phenomenal belief that\nit appears blue to normal perceivers, where phenomenal belief involves\nthe application of the appropriate phenomenal concept. Both may have\nbelieved, in a sense (the non-phenomenal sense that does not require\nuse of phenomenal concepts) that the sky appears blue to normal\nperceivers while still in their black-and-white environment (they may\nhave been told so by their friends). (For the distinction between\nphenomenal and non-phenomenal belief see Nida-Rumelin 1996 and\n1998). \nSome authors have raised doubts about the thought experiment itself.\nIt is sometimes pointed out, for example, that merely confining Mary\nto a monochromatic environment would not prevent her from having color\nexperiences (see Thompson 1995, 264) or that, after release, she would\nnot be able to see colors. But the example can be refined to meet\nthese objections. Mary might be monochromatic from birth and changed\ninto a normal perceiver by some medical procedure. It is sometimes\nobjected that already accepted or future results of visual science are\nor might be incompatible with the existence of a Mary-case (a person\nwith monochromatic experience who becomes a normal color perceiver\nlater) or that such results might require (to preserve consistence\nwith visual science) the introduction of so many additional\nassumptions that the conceivability of the example becomes doubtful.\nTo this one might reply that the thought experiment need not be\ncompatible with visual science. If the case of a person with\nmonochromatic vision who turns into a normal perceiver really does\ninvolve serious difficulties for materialism, then the mere fact (if\nit were one) that our visual apparatus excludes the actual existence\nof such a case does not seem to provide a convincing reply for the\nmaterialist. But this point (the relevance or irrelevance of visual\nscience in this context) has not received much discussion in the\nliterature. It has, however, been pointed out (see Graham and Horgan,\n2000, footnote 4 with its reference to Shepard 1993) that at least\npresently available results of color vision science do not exclude a\nMary-case. (The psychologist Knut Nordby was a real life case of a\ncolor vision specialist who was also a complete achromat. See his\npaper ‘Vision in a Complete Achromat: A Personal Account’,\nlinked into in the Other Internet Resources section and Nordby,\n2007.) \nAnother doubt about the thought experiment is raised by the claim that\na person who is confined to a monochromatic environment but knows\neverything physical there is to know about visual color experience\nwould be able to figure out what colored things look like and thus\nwould e.g. be able to imagine the kind of color experience produced in\nnormal perceivers when looking at the cloudless sky during the day\n(see e.g. Dennett 1991; Dennett 2007; Churchland 1989; Maloney 1985,\n36). Probably the most common reaction to this is simply to doubt the\nclaim. But it is not clear that the claim, if correct, would undermine\nthe knowledge argument. The opponent would have to show that complete\nphysical knowledge necessarily involves the capacity to\nimagine blue. One may doubt that this claim is compatible with the\nwidely accepted assumption that physical knowledge can be acquired\nindependently of one’s particular perceptual apparatus. (Arguably a\nsubject whose visual apparatus is not suited for visual experiences at\nall will not be able to develop the capacity to imagine colors on the\nbasis of physical knowledge alone, even if this were true for\nMary). \nSome have argued that Mary would recognize the colors when first\nseeing them on the basis of her complete physical knowledge about\ncolor vision (see Hardin 1992). According to this claim she would\nthink something like “oh, so this is red” when first\nconfronted with a red patch and she could not be fooled by what\nDennett calls ‘the blue banana trick’: when shown a blue\nbanana she would know that it has the wrong color (see Dennett 1991).\nA possible and common response is to simply doubt these claims. But,\nin any case, it is not clear that these claims undermine the knowledge\nargument. One may respond along the following lines: If Mary when\nfirst confronted with red were able to conclude that she is now seeing\nwhat people call red, she thereby acquires a large set of\nnew beliefs about red experiences (that they are produced by\nroses, such-and-such wavelength combinations and so on). On the basis\nof seeing red she (a) acquires a new phenomenal concept of red and (b)\nshe forms new beliefs involving that new concept using her previously\nacquired physical knowledge. But if this description is correct, then\nher previous knowledge was incomplete (for a detailed discussion of\nDennett’s argument involving the blue banana trick see Dale 1995). \nIt may appear obvious that premise P1 (Mary has complete physical\nknowledge about human color vision) implies C1 (Mary knows all the\nphysical facts about human color vision). If all physical facts can be\nknown under some physical conceptualization, then a person who has\ncomplete physical knowledge about a topic knows all the relevant\nphysical facts. But a few philosophers can be understood as objecting\nagainst precisely this apparently unproblematic step. Harman (1990)\nargues that Mary does not know all the functional facts concerning\nhuman color vision because she lacks the concept of what it is for an\nobject to be red, blue, etc. Flanagan (1992) distinguishes\nmetaphysical physicalism from linguistic\nphysicalism. While metaphysical physicalism is the ontological\nclaim that there are no non-physical individuals, properties or\nrelations and no non-physical facts, linguistic physicalism says that\n“everything physical can be expressed or captured in the\nlanguages of the physical sciences.” According to Flanagan\nMary’s case may refute linguistic physicalism but does not refute\nmetaphysical physicalism. Alter (1998) points out that the knowledge\nargument needs the premise that all physical facts can be learned\ndiscursively and argues that this assumption has not been established.\nIt may be argued against this view that it becomes hard to understand\nwhat it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the\nassumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those\nproperties and facts that can be expressed in physical\nterminology. \nTwo different versions of the No Propositional Knowledge-View\nhave been proposed. According to the Ability Hypothesis (most\nprominently defended in Lewis 1983, 1988 and in Nemirow 1980, 1990,\n2007), Mary does not acquire any new propositional knowledge after\nrelease (no knowledge about something that is the case, no factual\nknowledge), but only a bundle of abilities (like the ability to\nimagine, remember and recognize colors or color experiences).\nAccording to the Acquaintance Hypothesis proposed by Conee\n(1994), Mary’s new knowledge after release is what he calls\n“acquaintance knowledge” which is neither propositional\nknowledge nor identical to a bundle of abilities. \nProponents of the Ability Hypothesis presuppose that Mary’s epistemic\nprogress after release consists in the acquisition of knowing what it\nis like (e.g. to have an experience of blue) and they claim that to\nknow what it is like is to have certain practical abilities.\nAccording to Nemirow “knowing what an experience is like is the\nsame as knowing how to imagine having the experience” (1990,\n495). According to Lewis, \nA few years later he writes:  \nBence Nanay suggests that what Mary acquires is the ability to\ndiscriminate between different types of awareness, i.e., to\ndistinguish having or imagining experiences of type E from\nhaving or imagining experiences of other types (2009). \nLewis’s main argument for the Ability Hypothesis can be summarized\nlike this. (1) The only alternative to the Ability Hypothesis is what\nhe calls the Hypothesis of Phenomenal Information (HPI).\n(According to the HPI knowing what it is like is propositional in the\nfollowing sense: coming to know what it is like involves the\nelimination of hitherto open possibilities). (2) The HPI is\nincompatible with physicalism. (3) The Ability Hypothesis is\ncompatible with physicalism and explains everything that may be\nexplained by the HPI. Therefore: The Ability Hypothesis should be\npreferred. \nNote that the Ability Hypothesis is compatible with the view that we\ndo sometimes acquire propositional knowledge on the basis of getting\nacquainted with a new kind of experience from the first person\nperspective. The following remarks by Levin are hard to deny: \nBut, as pointed out by Tye (2000), this does not undermine the Ability\nHypothesis. The Ability Hypothesis implies that there is some\nknowledge that can only be acquired by having experiences of\na particular kind and that this knowledge is nothing but\nknowing-how. This of course does not exclude that there also\nis propositional knowledge that can be acquired by\ngetting acquainted with kinds of experiences from the first person\nperspective. The proponent of the Ability Hypothesis only has to\ninsist that, if there is such propositional knowledge, then\nit need not be acquired on that particular basis but is\naccessible in other ways as well. \nIt has been argued against Nemirow that the ability to imagine having\nan experience of a particular kind is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor knowing what it is like to have that kind of experience. To show\nthat imaginative abilities are not necessary for knowing what it is\nlike, Conee (1994) and Alter (1998) cite the example of a person who\nhas no capacity to imagine having color experiences. They claim that\ndespite this defect she would know what it is like to have an\nexperience of e.g. green while attentively staring at something that\nlooks green to her. To show that imaginative abilities are not\nsufficient for knowing what it is like Conee introduces the following\nexample: A person, Martha, “who is highly skilled at visualizing\nan intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of\nshades that she has experienced…happens not to have any\nfamiliarity with the shade known as cherry red.” Martha is told\nthat cherry red is midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has\nexperienced the latter two shades of red). Given this information and\nher extraordinary capacity, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry\nred, but as long as she does not exercise this ability she\ndoes not know what it is like to see cherry red. \nA similar example is used for the same purpose and discussed in more\ndetail by Raymont 1999. Raymont argues that mnemic, recognitional and\nimaginative abilities neither separately nor conjointly amount to\nknowing of what it is like to have a particular kind of experience. He\nfirst argues that none of these abilities is necessary and sufficient\nfor knowing what it is like: (a) Mnemic abilities are not necessary,\nsince someone can learn what an experience is like when first having\nit without already remembering an experience of the relevant kind. (b)\nImaginative abilities are not sufficient since someone can have the\nability to imagine a particular kind of experience without exercising\nit (see the example cited above). (c) To show that recognitional\nabilities are not sufficient either, Raymont cites empirical data\n“in support of the view that one can have the ability to\nnoninferentially recognize a certain type of visual experience without\never having had it, and thus without knowing what it is like to have\nit”. But then these three kinds of abilities cannot conjointly\namount to knowing what it is like either: if they did,\nthen – contrary to (a) – each of them would have to be a\nnecessary condition for knowing what it is like. \nGertler (1999) argues that the best candidate for an analysis in the\nspirit of the Ability Hypothesis is to identify knowing what it is\nlike to have an experience of red with the ability to recognize\nseeing-red experiences by their phenomenal quality and then goes on to\nattack this candidate: she points out that the ability to recognize\nseeing-red experiences by their phenomenal quality can be explained by\nthe fact that I know what it is like to see red but not vice\n versa.[3] \nMichael Tye (2000) concedes that none of the abilities considered by\nLewis is necessary for knowing what it is like and he discusses the\nfollowing possible revision of the Ability Hypothesis: knowing what it\nis like to have an experience of red is the ability to apply an\nindexical concept to an experience of red (while having it) via\nintrospection. But, he goes on to argue, this revised version can\nagain be rejected by a counterexample that shows that the ability at\nissue is not sufficient for knowing what it is like: If Mary is\ndistracted and does not attend to her experience when she first sees a\nred object, then she need not apply any concept to her experience at\nall. In this case, she still does not know what it is like to have red\nexperiences although she has the ability to apply an\nindexical concept to her present experience (she has the ability, but,\nbeing distracted, she does not exercise it). Tye concedes that the\nrevised version of the Ability Hypothesis could not, anyway, be used\nagainst the knowledge argument in the way that was originally\nintended. The reason is that the revised version is compatible with\nthe view that Mary does acquire knowing-that if she is not distracted\nwhen first seeing something red: she learns that this is a\nred experience (where “this” refers introspectively to her\npresent experience) and so acquires knowing-that. According to Tye to\nhave indexical knowledge of this kind is sufficient but not necessary\nfor knowing what it is like to have a red experience. After all, it is\nimpossible to introspectively refer to a red experience without\npresently having that kind of experience, but Tye wishes to concede\nthat a person can know what it is like to have a red experience while\nnot presently having a red experience. This reasoning motivates his\ndisjunctive account of knowing what it is like: “S\nknows what it is like to undergo experience E iff either\nS now has indexical knowledge-that with respect to E\nobtained via current introspection or S has the Lewis\nabilities with respect to E” (Tye 2000). Tye thus\ndefends the physicalist view against the knowledge argument by a\ncombination of the two strategies mentioned above: he applies the\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact-strategy to the person who knows what\nit is like to have an experience in the sense of the first conjunct\n(the indexical thought at issue is made true by a physical fact) and\nhe applies the No Propositional Knowledge-strategy to the\ncase of someone who has knowing what it is like in the sense of the\nsecond disjunct. \nLycan (1996) argues against the Ability Hypothesis and for the view\nthat Mary acquires new knowledge-that after release by claiming that\n“S knows what it is like to see blue” means\nsomething like “S knows that it is like Q to\nsee blue” where Q names the phenomenal quality at\nissue. It has been objected by Tye (1995) that the use of the qualia\nname “Q” within a propositional attitude context\ncreates the well-known problems: Replacing “Q” by\nanother name “R” for the same quale may change\nthe truth value of the belief ascription. A proponent of Lycan’s view\ncould however respond along the following lines: In the case of qualia\nnames within belief contexts it does not matter which name is used to\nrefer to the quale at issue as long as the belief is meant in the\nsense of a phenomenal belief ascription. “S believes\nthat it is like Q to see blue” means, on the phenomenal\nreading, that S has the relevant belief about Q\nunder a phenomenal concept of Q. Under the assumption that it\nis impossible to have two different phenomenal concepts of one and the\nsame quale, the objection is met: As long as two qualia names\nQ and R refer to the same quale, replacing\nQ by R in an ascription of phenomenal belief cannot\nchange the truth value of the belief ascription. \nAs we have seen, proponents of the Ability Hypothesis assume that the\nknow-how which Mary acquires is distinct from any propositional\nknowledge. This assumption can be challenged, based for example on the\nwork of Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (2001). On this view, for\na subject S to know how to do something (to F) is for\nS to know that there is a way w for S to F,\nand for S to know this under a practical mode of presentation\n(2001, 430). Stanley & Williamson themselves apply this thought to\nLewis’s version of the Ability Hypothesis: \nYuri Cath suggests that this point can be accommodated by proponents\nof the Ability Hypothesis, provided they distinguish between Mary’s\nlearning a new proposition and her coming to be in new state of\npropositional knowledge (2009, 142–143). Specifically, before\nher release Mary can know that w is a way for someone to\nimagine red, but only under a theoretical mode of presentation; after\nher release, she comes to know the same proposition under a practical\nmode of presentation. She thus comes to be in a new state of\npropositional knowledge, but without learning any new\n propositions.[4] \nEarl Conee (1994) proposes another variant of the No Propositional\nKnowledge-View. According to Conee acquaintance constitutes a\nthird category of knowledge that is neither reducible to factual\nknowledge nor to knowing-how and he argues that Mary acquires after\nrelease only acquaintance knowledge. According to Conee knowing\nsomething by acquaintance “requires the person to be familiar\nwith the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a\nperson to be aware of that thing” (1994, 144). Since\n“experiencing a quality is the most direct way to apprehend a\nquality” (Conee 1994, 144), Mary gains acquaintance with color\nqualia only after release. According to the view proposed by Conee the\nphysicalist can defend himself against the knowledge argument in the\nfollowing way: (1) Qualia are physical properties of experiences (and\nexperiences are physical processes). Let Q be such a\nproperty. (2) Mary can know all about Q and she can know that\na given experience has Q before release,\nalthough – before release – she is not acquainted with\nQ. (3) After release Mary gets acquainted with Q,\nbut she does not acquire any new item of propositional knowledge by\ngetting acquainted with Q (in particular she already knew\nunder what conditions normal perceivers have experiences with the\nproperty Q). More recently Michael Tye (2009, 131–137)\ndefends the acquaintance hypothesis as the right answer to the\nknowledge argument thereby abandoning his original response (see below\n4.7). \nA friend of the knowledge argument might concede that a person is\nacquainted with Q only if she has or had an experience with\nproperty Q but he would have to insist that being acquainted\nwith Q in that sense is a necessary condition for being able\nto know (in the relevant sense) that an experience has Q.\nAnother kind of criticism of the Acquaintance Hypothesis is developed\nin Gertler (1999). She argues that the property dualist can explain\nwhy the most direct way to get familiar with a quale is by having an\nexperience of the relevant kind while the physicalist does not have\nany explanation for this particular feature of qualia. Similarly,\nRobert Howell (2007, 146) argues that all other physicalist responses\nto the Knowledge Argument depend upon the Acquaintance Hypothesis, and\nthat acquaintance is incompatible with objectivism (see Section 4.9\nbelow). \nIt is interesting to see that one version of the New Knowledge/Old\nFact View is very similar in spirit to the Acquaintance Hypothesis.\nBigelow and Pargetter (1990) argue that Mary’s progress after release\nconsists in the fact that she now stands in a new acquaintance\nrelation to color qualia, but their theory about the individuation of\nbeliefs implies that she thereby acquires new factual knowledge.\nDifferent beliefs, according to Bigelow and Pargetter, can be\ndistinguished appropriately only if one takes into consideration the\nway the subject is acquainted with the individuals and properties her\nbelief is about (they use the technical term “modes of\nacquaintance” in that context). \nSeveral positive arguments for the view that Mary’s new knowledge\nafter release constitutes propositional knowledge (genuine\ninformation) have been formulated in the literature. Lycan argues, for\nexample, that Mary’s new knowledge goes along with the elimination of\nepistemic possibilities and that her new abilities are best explained\nby her having new information (for further arguments see Lycan 1996,\n92). Loar (1990/1997) points out that the embedded occurrence of\n“feels like such and such” in sentences like\n“if pains feel like such and such then\nQ” cannot be accounted for in a model that treats\nknowing what it is like as mere know-how. McConnell (1994) defends the\nmore radical view that the acquisition of knowing-how is normally\naccompanied by the acquisition of a particular new item of\nknowing-that. \nMany philosophers find it hard to deny that Mary gains new factual\nknowledge after release and for that reason (if they are physicalists)\nfeel attracted by the New Knowledge/Old Fact View. Positions that\nclearly fall into that category are defended in Horgan 1984;\nChurchland 1985; Tye 1986, 1995; Bigelow and Pargetter 1990; Loar\n1990/1997; Lycan 1990a, 1996; Pereboom 1994; Perry 2001; Byrne 2002;\nPapineau 2002, 2007; Van Gulick 2004; Levin 2007; Balog 2012a,\n2012b. \nThe basic ideas common to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View may be\nsummarized as follows: \n(2) To gain knowledge of what it is like to have an experience of a\nparticular phenomenal character requires the acquisition of\nphenomenal concepts of phenomenal\n character.[5] \n(3) What it is for an organism to acquire and possess a phenomenal\nconcept can be fully described in broadly physical terms. \n(4) A subject can acquire and possess phenomenal concepts only if it\nhas or has had experiences of the relevant phenomenal kind. \n(5) After release Mary gains knowledge about phenomenal characters\nunder phenomenal concepts. \nBut the facts that make these new items of knowledge true are physical\nfacts that Mary knew before release under another\nconceptualization. \nThe differences between variants of the New Knowledge/Old Fact View\nconcern the theoretical (physicalist) account of (a) phenomenal\ncharacter, (b) phenomenal concepts of phenomenal characters and (c)\nthe relation between phenomenal characters and the corresponding\nphenomenal concepts. All proponents of the view point out that,\naccording to their proposal, physical concepts and phenomenal concepts\nare cognitively independent: it is impossible to see a priori\nthat something that falls under a physical concept of a\nparticular phenomenal character also falls under the corresponding\nphenomenal concept of that phenomenal character. This is why\nit is possible to have (like Mary) complete physical knowledge about\ne.g. phenomenal blueness (you know everything there is to know about\nphenomenal blueness under its physical conceptualization) without\nhaving a phenomenal concept of blueness and without knowing any of\nthese facts under a phenomenal concept of blueness. Some have argued\nthat the phenomenal conceptualization is not expressible in language\n(see Byrne 2002 and Hellie 2004). \nIn general, if a philosopher A claims that the argument of\nphilosopher B does not go through, it is a point in favor of\nhis view if he can provide an error theory, that is if he can explain\nwhy the argument may appear correct in the first place. The\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact View can claim to have an error theory with\nrespect to the knowledge argument. Given the cognitive independence of\nphysical and phenomenal concepts of blueness it appears as if\nwe could imagine a situation where everything Mary knew before release\nwere fulfilled but not what she came to know after release (and this\ncan be taken to imply that she does come to know new facts).\nBut, according to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View this is an illusion.\nThere is no such possible situation. What Mary learns after release is\nmade true by a physical fact that she already knew before her release.\nSome versions of the New Knowledge/Old Fact-View will be briefly\ndescribed in what follows. \nHorgan (1984) does not provide a developed theoretical account of\nphenomenal concepts but is one of the first to formulate the basic\nintuition shared by most or all proponents of the New Knowledge/Old\nFact View: By having experiences of blue, Mary gets acquainted with\nphenomenal blueness (which is in fact a physical property of\nexperiences) “from the experiential perspective,” she\ngains what he calls “the first person ostensive perspective on\nthat property” (Horgan 1984, 151): she now can refer to\nphenomenal blueness by thinking or saying “that kind of\nproperty” while having, remembering or imagining a blue\nexperience and while attending to its particular quality. She thus has\nacquired a new concept of phenomenal blueness. Using this new\nconcept she can form new beliefs (and acquire new knowledge) about\nphenomenal blueness. Formulated in this way, the view may appear\nsimilar to Conee’s acquaintance account. According to both views,\nMary’s progress consists primarily in getting acquainted with\nphenomenal blueness from an inner perspective. But contrary to Conee’s\nthesis, according to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View, acquaintance\nwith phenomenal blueness from an experiential perspective enables the\nsubject to form a new concept of phenomenal blueness and\nthereby implies the capacity to acquire new beliefs. \nAn example of a more explicit theoretical account of phenomenal\ncharacter, phenomenal content and their relation can be found in Tye\n(1995). He proposes a representationalist account of phenomenal\ncharacter. For a state to have phenomenal character is to represent\ninternal or external physical items in an ‘abstract’ and\nnonconceptual way that is “appropriately poised for use by the\ncognitive system” (see Tye 1995, 137–144). According to\nTye, there are two kinds of phenomenal concepts: indexical concepts\n(an example is the concept applied when thinking of a particular shade\nof red as “this particular hue” while having a red\nexperience) and what he calls “predicative phenomenal\nconcepts” that are based on the capacity to make certain\ndiscriminations. Tye wishes to accommodate the natural intuition that\nMary before release cannot fully understand the nature of phenomenal\nblueness (she doesn’t really know what it is to have a blue\nexperience). One might think that his view is incompatible with the\nintuition at issue. Phenomenal blueness, according to his view, has a\nphysical nature and one might expect that physical natures are fully\ndescribable in physical terms and fully understandable under a\nphysical conceptualization. But Tye has a surprising response:\nalthough phenomenal blueness has a physical nature, a person cannot\nfully understand its nature unless she thinks of phenomenal blueness\nunder a phenomenal concept. \nAnother representationalist view about phenomenal character is\ncombined with the New Knowledge/Old Fact View in Lycan (1990a) and\n(1996). Lycan’s account of Mary’s epistemic progress can be put,\nroughly, like this: Only after release Mary can form\n“introspective second order representations” of her own\ncolor experiences. One may think of an introspective representation as\nof “a token in one of the subject’s languages of thought, his or\nher Introspectorese”. It has often been said that what Mary\nlearns is in some sense “ineffable”, that it cannot be\ncommunicated in public language. Lycan is led to a similar conclusion\nwithin his computational theory. In his view, when Mary finally has an\nexperience of blue she “tokens a semantically primitive mental\nword for the type of first-order state being inwardly sensed”,\nwhere this word in Mary’s language of thought has an\n“inferential and/or conceptual role” that is “unique\nto its subject, in that no other subject could deploy a functionally\nsimilar representation whose designatum was that (the subject’s) very\nsame first-order state-token, ….” And he concludes that\n“the introspective word would certainly not be synonymous with\nany primitive or composite expression of public\nEnglish,…” (Lycan 1996, 101). \nPapineau (1996) distinguishes third person and first person thoughts\nabout experiences. First person thoughts involve the imagination of an\nexperience of the relevant kind. The basic idea may be put like this:\nWhen Mary is finally released and after some time sufficiently\nacquainted with color experiences she can ‘reproduce’ blue\nexperiences in her imagination. These imaginations of experiences of a\nparticular kind can be used to refer to experiences of the kind at\nissue and to think about them. Obviously, Mary could not have first\nperson thoughts about color experiences (she could not use imagined\nblue experiences in order to refer and to think about blue\nexperiences) before she ever had blue experiences. After release, Mary\ncan acquire new beliefs: first person beliefs about blue experiences.\nBut for every such new first person belief about a given kind\nof experience, there will be one of her old third person\nbeliefs which refers to the same kind of experience and has the same\nfactual content. \nAnother way to understand phenomenal concepts is as a species of\nindexical concepts. For instance, Perry (2001) argues that Mary’s new\nknowledge after release does not pose a problem to physicalism any\nmore than indexical thoughts like “I am a philosopher” or\n“today is Sunday” (for a defense of this claim see also\nMcMullen 1985). Perry treats Mary’s new knowledge as a particular case\nof demonstrative belief (and he proposes an account of Mary’s new\nbeliefs after release in terms of his theory of token-reflexive\nthoughts). After release, when seeing the sky, Mary may think\n“Oh, so having blue experiences is like this”\nwhere “this” refers to a physical property (the phenomenal\ncharacter) of her present color experience. She could not have had a\ndemonstrative belief of this kind before release. But, again, the fact\nthat makes the thought true is simply the fact that blue experiences\nhave the particular physical property at issue. Therefore, she does\nnot learn any new fact. \nDoubts about Perry’s proposal have been raised along the following\nlines. In normal cases of demonstrative reference the demonstrated\nobject is in some way given to the epistemic subject (when pointing to\na table and referring to it by “this table”, the object\nmay be given as “the next table left to me”). But what is\nthe way the kind of experience is given to Mary when she thinks of\nphenomenal blueness under the demonstrative concept “this kind\nof experience?” It cannot be the way it feels to have an\nexperience with that property, since this solution, so one may argue,\nintroduces phenomenal characters of phenomenal characters and thus\nreintroduces the original problem. Maybe “the kind of experience\nI am now having” is the appropriate candidate. But there are\nproblems with this proposal too (see Chalmers 2002). There are also\nproblems with suggesting that the demonstrative concept is\n‘thin’, in the sense that it has no reference-fixing mode\nof presentation associated with it (for some of these problems see\nDemircioglu 2013, 263–269). \nRobert Stalnaker (2008) raises further doubts regarding Perry’s\ntreatment of Mary’s new knowledge. Drawing on a distinction between\nthe two stages of Mary’s epistemic progress (see Section 3.3 above),\nhe argues that the cases of acquiring demonstrative beliefs which\nPerry compares with Mary’s new knowledge are akin to the second\nstage of Mary’s progress, but “It is at stage one that the\nproblematic cognitive achievement – the learning ‘what\nit is like’ to see red – takes place” (2008,\n44). \nStalnaker suggests an alternative way in which Mary’s new knowledge\nis demonstrative in character. On this proposal, what Mary acquires is\nessentially contextual information, where “the content of what\nis expressed or believed in a context is not detachable from the\ncontext in which it is expressed or believed” (2008, 81). As an\nexample of such information, Stalnaker describes a bomb disposal\nexpert pointing at the ground and saying “A bomb is buried\nthere, and unless we defuse it now it will explode within five\nminutes” (2008, 85). This information, Stalnaker suggests,\ncannot be known by someone who was not in that situation at that time,\neven if they know the exact co-ordinates of where the bomb is located\nand when it will detonate. Daniel Stoljar (2011) argues that\nphenomenal knowledge is not essentially contextual. In defence of this\nclaim, he suggests there is an important dis-analogy between the\ndifference between Mary, pre- and post-release, and the difference\nbetween the bomb disposal expert and anyone who was not with her when\nshe made her utterance. The thought which the bomb disposal expert\nexpressed in her utterance could not even be entertained by someone\nwho was not present at that time; it is for this reason that someone\nnot there could not know what the expert knew. In contrast, Stoljar\nsuggests that “the fact that post-release Mary learnt could have\nbeen entertained by pre-release Mary (e.g., she can wonder whether it\nobtains)” (2011, 441). This suggests that what Mary learns upon\nrelease is not essentially contextual, at least not in the sense which\nStalnaker has in mind. \nAnother worry about demonstrative accounts is that they do not seem to\ndo duty to the way in which the subjective character itself is present\nto the mind of the thinker when employing a phenomenal concept of that\ncharacter. This worry is sometimes put in terms of acquaintance: the\nspecific way in which the thinker is acquainted with the referent of\nher thought in using phenomenal concepts does not seem to be captured\nby the demonstrative account (see Levine 2007; Howell 2007,\n164–166). Several attempts have been made to answer objections\nof this kind. Papineau (2002) and Balog (2012a) argue that the\ncognitive intimacy to be accounted for is well explained by a\nquotational theory of phenomenal concepts: in thoughts involving\nphenomenal concepts token experiences are used in order to refer to\nthe kind those tokens belong to. Levine (2007) argues that even these\nrefined theories do not account for the specific intimate way in which\nthe thinker is related to the referents of phenomenal concepts.\nContrary to this Levin (2007) does not see any need to\n‘embellish’ the original simple demonstrative account.\nWhile Balog’s current position is an elaborated version of the\nquotational account, Papineau has abandoned the quotational theory and\nargues in Papineau (2007) that phenomenal concepts are special cases\nof perceptual concepts where perceptual concepts do not involve\ndemonstration. \nAn influential view about phenomenal concepts which answers the\nknowledge argument admitting that Mary gains new knowledge but no\nknowledge of new facts is developed in Loar (1990/1997): Phenomenal\nconcepts are recognitional concepts. To have the phenomenal concept of\nblueness is to be able to recognize experiences of blueness while\nhaving them. The recognitional concept of blueness refers\ndirectly to its referent (the physical property of blueness)\nwhere this means (in Loar’s terminology): there is no other\nproperty (no property of that property) involved in the reference\nfixing.  According to Loar’s view the recognitional concept of\nphenomenal blueness refers to the physical property phenomenal\nblueness in virtue of being ‘triggered’ by that\nproperty. It has been doubted that ‘directness’ in\nLoar’s sense provides an account for what one might call\nacquaintance: for the way in which the phenomenal character is present\nto the mind when a thinker employs phenomenal concepts (see Levine\n2007). White (2007) argues against Loar that the account cannot\nexplain the a posteriori character of mind-brain identity statements\nin a satisfying manner. \nAn objection to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View can be made as\nfollows. In standard cases, if a subject does not know a given fact in\none way that it does know in some other way, this can be explained by\ntwo modes of presentation: the subject knows the fact under one mode\nof presentation and does not know it under some other mode of\npresentation. So, for example, a person may know the fact that Venus\nis a planet under the mode of presentation associated with “the\nmorning star is a planet” and fail to know the very same fact\nunder the mode of presentation associated with “the evening star\nis a planet.” In this particular case, as in many others, the\ndifference in the mode of presentation involves two different\nproperties that are used to fix the referent. In one mode of\npresentation Venus is given as the heavenly body visible late in the\nmorning (or some similar property), whereas in the other mode of\npresentation the object is given as the heavenly body visible early in\nthe evening. \nIf the New Knowledge/Old Fact View involves two modes of presentation\nof this sort, then it cannot be used to defend physicalism because\nthis kind of explanation of the supposed double epistemic access to\nfacts concerning phenomenal types would reintroduce non-physical\nproperties at a higher level: the subject would have to be described\nas referring to the phenomenal type at issue by some physical property\nin case it believes the relevant fact under its physical mode of\npresentation and as referring to that phenomenal type by some\nnon-physical property in case it believes the relevant fact under its\nphenomenal mode of presentation. \nIt has been argued by several authors that the different modes of\npresentation at issue in the case of beliefs about phenomenal states\ndo involve the introduction of different reference-fixing properties\nand that therefore the proposal is unsuccessful. Arguments of that\nkind are found in Lockwood (1989, chap. 8) and McConnell (1994). White\n(2007) develops the objection in detail. Block (2007) gives a detailed\nanswer to White (2007) based on a distinction between what he labels\ncognitive and metaphysical modes of presentation. Chalmers (1996,\n2002, 2010) makes a similar point as White (2007) using his framework\nof primary and secondary intensions. In that framework, primary\nintensions describe the way a concept picks out its referent in the\nactual world and the cognitive independence of phenomenal and physical\nconcepts is explained by their different primary intensions. If one\nsingular fact can be known under a physical mode of presentation as\nwell as under a phenomenal mode of presentation, then the two items of\nknowledge involve two concepts (a phenomenal and a physical concept)\nwith different primary intensions and these different primary\nintensions correspond to different properties. \nA two-dimensional framework is used in a different manner in\nNida-Rümelin (2007) to develop the idea that the nature of\nphenomenal properties is present to the mind of the thinker when using\nphenomenal properties – an idea which leads to the result that the\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact View is mistaken. This idea is also suggested\nby Philip Goff (2017). He suggests that the knowledge argument does\nnot by itself refute physicalism because it does not overcome the New\nKnowledge/Old Fact View. However, things are different if the\nphenomenal concept which Mary acquires is transparent (i.e.,\nit reveals the nature or essence of the phenomenal property which\nsatisfies it): \nA general argument against the materialist strategy of appealing to\nphenomenal concepts is developed in Chalmers (2004; 2007); for\ncritical discussion see Balog (2012b).  \nAnyone who wishes to argue in the way just mentioned, that the two\nmodes of presentation do involve the introduction of two different\nreference-fixing properties, must deal with Loar’s proposal (see 4.7).\nLoar avoids the problem of two reference fixing properties by his\nclaim that phenomenal concepts refer directly to their referent. It\nhas been argued against Loar that his causal account of how phenomenal\nconcepts manage to directly refer to their referent (namely by being\ntriggered by them) cannot appropriately describe the particular\ncognitive role of phenomenal concepts (see McConnell 1994 and White\n2007). \nA final issue concerning both the New Knowledge/Old Facts View and the\nknowledge argument itself is whether there are any phenomenal\nconcepts. Derek Ball (2009) and Michael Tye (2009) argue that there\nare no such concepts, at least as defined above: in particular, both\ndeny claim (4) outlined in Section 4.6, that a subject can possess\nphenomenal concepts only if it has or has had experiences of the\nrelevant kind. Ball and Tye appeal to work on social externalism\nregarding the content of our concepts to argue that even prior to her\nrelease, Mary possesses the same concepts which she uses to think\nabout her experiences after her release. Specifically, she possesses\nsuch concepts ‘deferentially’, in virtue of interacting\nwith her linguistic community; a crucial part of social externalism\nabout content is that one can possess concepts deferentially even\nthough one is largely ignorant of the nature of what satisfies these\nconcepts (Ball 2009, 947–954; Tye 2009,\n 63–70).[6]\n This result threatens to undermine the New Knowledge / Old Facts\nView, but Ball suggests it also undermines the knowledge argument\nitself, since the knowledge argument itself depends on there being\nphenomenal concepts (2009, 940–943). \nTorin Alter (2013) responds to these arguments by focusing on the\ndistinction between deferential and non-deferential concept possession\n(the latter is conceptual mastery). He suggests that it is\nmastery of phenomenal concepts rather than mere deferential possession\nwhich matters for the knowledge argument: “Mary makes epistemic\nprogress when she leaves the room because she comes to master or\nnon-deferentially possess phenomenal colour concepts” (2013,\n486). And defenders of the knowledge argument can claim that mastery\nof a phenomenal concept requires actually having experiences with the\nrelevant phenomenal character. \nThe Knowledge Argument has traditionally been understood as an\nargument against physicalism or perhaps against reductive versions of\nphysicalism. But an influential alternative approach sees the argument\nas working not against physicalism per se, but against a different\nposition which can be termed\n objectivism.[7]\n Objectivism is the view that an objective description of what exists\ncan be complete; that there are no aspects of reality which can only\nbe understood by having experiences of a specific type. This notion is\nclosely related to Nagel’s characterization of the physical nature\nof organisms as “a domain of objective facts par\nexcellence – the kind that can be observed and understood\nfrom many points of view and by individuals with differing perceptual\nsystems” (1974, 442). On this view, the point of Jackson’s\nthought experiment is to bring out that Mary learns something which\ncan only be known by having an experience of a certain kind (e.g., a\nperceptual experience). If this is correct, then this shows that no\nobjective description of what exist can be complete. As Howell\nformulates it, the argument understood in this way runs as\nfollows: \nA number of proponents of this interpretation of the Knowledge\nArgument suggest that it is compatible with a specific form of\nphysicalism, on which all facts are physical or metaphysically\nnecessitated by microphysical facts but some facts can only be\nunderstood by having specific experiences (see, e.g., Kallestrup 2006;\nHowell 2007; for slightly different formulations see Crane 2003; Zhao\n2012). That said, it is worth asking how the ‘physical’ is\nto be understood, such that facts which can only be known if one has\ncertain experiences can count as physical. Furthermore, it is worth\nquestioning whether a view on which facts are either physical or\nmetaphysically necessitated by microphysical facts thereby counts as a\nform of physicalism. It has been argued that such a view is compatible\nwith non-physicalist positions such as emergentism or certain forms of\nethical non-naturalism (see Horgan 1993, 559-566; 2010, 311-314; Crane\n2010; for discussion see Stoljar 2017, section 9). \nThere has not been much discussion of the knowledge argument from a\ndualist perspective. This is unsurprising given the small number of\ncontemporary philosophers who defend a dualist position (for a\nprominent exception see Chalmers (1996); the knowledge argument is\ndiscussed on pp. 140–146). There are two possible strategies for\na dualist to take who wishes to defend the knowledge argument. The\nfirst is merely defensive or ‘destructive’ in that it\ntries to refute the positive theoretical proposals one by one that\nhave been used by physicalists in their objections against the\nknowledge argument. The second is more ‘constructive’ in\nthat it aims at developing an alternative positive dualist account of\nphenomenal concepts, phenomenal properties and their relations such\nthat on that account Mary does learn new and nonphysical facts upon\nrelease. Examples (or partial examples) for the first strategy may\noccasionally be found in the literature (compare Warner 1986, Gertler\n1999, Raymont 1995, 1999 and Connell 1994). Examples for the second\nare hard to find, but Chalmers (1996, 2002) and Nida-Rümelin\n(2007) exemplify the second strategy. Using his framework of primary\nand secondary intensions he develops a positive account of what he\ncalls “pure phenomenal concepts” that can be described as\nincorporating the old and natural intuition that in the case of qualia\n(phenomenal characters) there is no distinction between appearance and\nreality, in other words: qualia ‘reveal their nature’ in\nexperience. \nThe intuitive idea just mentioned has been expressed in different\nways. Some say that qualia ‘have no hidden sides’. Others\nsay that qualia are not natural kind terms in that it is not\nup to the sciences to tell us what having an experience of a\nparticular kind amounts to (we know what it amounts to by having them\nand attending to the quality at issue). It is quite clear that an\naccount of this intuitive idea has to be one of the ingredients of a\ndualist defense of the knowledge argument. Nida-Rümelin (2007)\ndevelops a technical notion of grasping properties which is intended\nto serve the purposes of dualists who argue against materialism using\nthe assumption that in the special case of phenomenal concepts the\nrelation that the thinker bears to the property he conceptualizes is\nmore intimate than in other cases: the thinker understands what having\nthe property essentially consists in. This idea can be used to block\nfamiliar objections to the knowledge argument in particular those\nfalling into the Old fact/ New Knowledge category. A similar basic\nidea but formulated within a different theoretical framework is\nelaborated in Stephen White (2007).  \nAccording to mainstream opinion the most serious problem for property\ndualism is the danger of being driven into epiphenomenalism. If\nphenomenal characters are non-physical properties and if every\nphysical event has a physical cause and if we exclude the possibility\nof overdetermination (where something is caused by two different\ncauses that are both sufficient), then, arguably, whether or not a\nstate has a particular phenomenal character cannot have any causal\nrelevance. But if qualia are causally impotent, how can a person know\nthat she has an experience with a particular phenomenal character?\nMany take it to be obvious that a person cannot know that she now has\na blue experience unless her blue experience plays a prominent causal\nrole in the formation of her belief at issue. This particular problem\nhas been formulated as an objection against the knowledge argument in\nWatkins (1989). Until some time ago Jackson was one of the very few\nphilosophers who embraced epiphenomenalism. But Jackson changed his\nmind. Jackson (1995) argues that knowledge about qualia is impossible\nif qualia are epiphenomenal and he concludes that something must be\nwrong with the knowledge argument. In Jackson (2003) and Jackson\n(2007) he argues that the argument goes wrong in presupposing a false\nview about sensory experience and that it can be answered by endorsing\nstrong representationalism: the view that to be in a phenomenal state\nis to represent objective properties where the properties represented\nas well as the representing itself can be given a physicalist account.\nJackson admits that there is a specific phenomenal way of representing\nbut he now insists that the phenomenal way of representing can be\naccounted for in physicalist terms. Doubts about the latter claim are\ndeveloped in Alter (2007). Other possible reactions to the threat of\nepiphenomenalism for dualism would be either to doubt that a property\ndualist must embrace epiphenomenalism or to develop an account of\nknowledge about one’s own phenomenal states that does not imply a\ncausal relation between qualia and phenomenal knowledge about qualia\n(see Chalmers 2002). \nThe appropriate evaluation of the knowledge argument remains\ncontroversial. The acceptability of its second premise P2 (Mary lacks\nfactual knowledge before release) and of the inferences from P1 (Mary\nhas complete physical knowledge before release) to C1 (Mary knows all\nthe physical facts) and from P2 to C2 (Mary does not know some facts\nbefore release) depend on quite technical and controversial issues\nabout (a) the appropriate theory of property concepts and their\nrelation to the properties they express and (b) the appropriate theory\nof belief content. It is therefore safe to predict that the discussion\nabout the knowledge argument will not come to an end in the near\nfuture.","contact.mail":"donnchadh.oconaill@unifr.ch","contact.domain":"unifr.ch"}]
