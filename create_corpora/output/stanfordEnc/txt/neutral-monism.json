It holds that ultimate\nreality is all of one kind. To this extent neutral monism is in\nagreement with the more familiar versions of monism: idealism and\nmaterialism. What distinguishes neutral monism from its monistic\nrivals is the claim that the intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is\nneither mental nor physical. This negative claim also captures the\nidea of neutrality: being intrinsically neither mental nor physical in\nnature ultimate reality is said to be neutral between the two.\n\n\nNeutral monism is compatible with the existence of many neutral\nentities. And neutral monism is compatible with the existence of\nnon-neutral entities—mental and material entities, for\nexample—assuming that these non-neutral entities are, in some\nsense, derivative of the ultimate neutral entities. Most versions of\nneutral monism have been pluralist in both these respects. They were\nconceived as solutions to the mind-body problem. The goal was to close\nthe apparent chasm between mental and physical entities by exhibiting\nboth as consisting of groups of the more basic neutral entities.\n\n\nAny version of neutral monism will therefore have the answer the\nfollowing three questions:\n\nWhat are the neutral entities and what is their nature?\n\nWhat is the relationship of these neutral entities to matter?\n\nWhat is the relationship of these neutral entities to mind?\n\nBoth of the terms that make up the label “neutral monism”\nare problematical. Because the questions to which the notion of\nneutrality gives rise are unique to neutral monism, they need to be\naddressed first. Most versions of neutral monism assume a plurality of\nbasic, neutral entities (these could be substances, events, tropes,\nuniversals, etc., depending on the specific version of neutral monism\nin question). What does it mean for an entity to be neutral? Here are\nfive proposals: \n(1)–(5) are not always clearly distinguished; but even when they\nare, two or more of these criteria may be used concurrently. This\ninvites confusion on the part of the neutral monists, as well as their\ncritics. \nQuestions arise about the relationships between (1)–(5). (1) and\n(5) are similar in letting the question of an entity’s\nneutrality be settled by its intrinsic nature. (2)–(4) answer\nthis question by looking at the relationships of a given entity to\nother things: to the nature of larger groups of entities of which the\ngiven entity is/can be a member: are these groups mental or physical?\nOr by looking to the kinds of laws that govern the entity in question:\nare the laws mental or physical? If one is inclined to think that\nneutrality is a matter of intrinsic nature alone, (2)–(4) will\nseem misguided. (2)–(4) still might have a place as epistemic\ncriteria—as ways of finding out whether a given entity is\nneutral. The friends of (1) and (5) can agree that a given\nentity’s ability to actually or possibly belong to a certain\ngroup, or to be governed by certain laws, is due solely to its\nintrinsic nature. Their disagreement concerns only the question\nwhether this ability is conferred on that entity by its being both\nmental and physical or neither mental or nor physical. In either case\n(2)–(4) can only be used to discover which things are the\nneutral entities. \nThe traditional versions of neutral monism—those developed by\nErnst Mach, William James, and Bertrand Russell (see section\n 4\n below)—accept (1) and reject (2). But some critics of neutral\nmonism, notably Bostock (2012: 190, 195–6), interpret neutral\nmonism as committed to (2). Based on this interpretation of\nneutrality, Bostock arrives at the striking conclusion that\n“Russell’s version of neutral monism was never properly\n‘neutral’ or ‘monistic’” (Bostock 2012:\n190). \nIt can be argued that none of the traditional neutral monists accept\n(3). All of them would agree that neutral entities can be a\nconstituent of both physical and mental non-basic entities. But it is\ndoubtful whether any of them would agree that the fact that a basic\nentity can be a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities is sufficient to make it neutral. For it is conceivable that\na basic entity that fails to be neutral (according to (1), the\nNeither View) should figure in the construction of both\nphysical and mental non-basic entities. \nGregory Landini’s influential discussion of Russell’s\nneutral monism (Landini 2011: ch. 6) illustrates the importance of the\ndistinction between criteria (1) and (3). Landini assumes that (3)\ncaptures Russell’s idea of neutrality. This allows Landini to\nconclude that Russell is a physicalist and a neutral monist\n(see Landini, 280, 291, 297). According to Landini, Russell is a\nneutral monist because every basic entity can be a constituent of both\nphysical and mental non-basic entities; and Russell is a physicalist\nbecause all basic entities of his system are\n physical.[1] \n\n (4)\n is present in the thought of Mach and James. But it plays a prominent\npart in Russell’s thought. His use of (1) in conjunction with\n(4), especially in Russell 1921, is confusing, and it has led a number\nof his critics (Stace 1946; Bostock 2012) to argue that (at least his\nearly) neutral monism is best understood as a form of dualism. \nThe traditional neutral monists reject\n (5),\n but many of their formulations suggest otherwise. It is easy to find\npassages saying that a given neutral entity is physical and mental. A\nsympathetic reading of these passages suggests that they are best\nunderstood as an abbreviated way of saying that this neutral entity is\na member of two groups of neutral entities, one of which counts as\nphysical, the other of which counts as mental. The terms\n“physical” and “mental” apply to groups of\nneutral entities, not to individual neutral entities, as Russell\npoints out when speaking about the mental:  \n“mental” is a character, like “harmonious” or\n“discordant”, that cannot belong to a single entity in its\nown right, but only to a system of entities. (Russell 1927b: 209)  \nBut a number of contemporary discussions of neutral monism employ the\nBoth View. \n(1)–(5) use the concepts of the mental and the physical (or of\ncorresponding laws) to specify the notion of neutrality. Since the\nmind/matter distinction can be drawn in different ways, the notion of\nthe neutral will vary accordingly. And if the mental and the physical\nare defined as complements of each other, thereby ruling out the\npossibility of entities that are neither mental nor physical, then\nthere cannot be any neutral entities (at least in the neither\nsense of the term). \nAnother feature shared by (1)–(5) is that they all fail to meet\na condition—discussed by C.D. Broad in his 1925—that an\nattribute must meet if it is to carve out a class of entities. If\nneutrality is to be a kind-forming attribute, it “must be a\nsimple attribute, i.e., it must not be analysable into a conjunction\nor disjunction of other attributes” (Broad 1925: 23). If one\naccepts this kind of homogeneity constraint on neutral entities, all\nfive criteria of neutrality proposed above fail to pick out a set of\nentities that are sufficiently simple or homogeneous to form a\nkind. \nA related worry is that (1)–(4) don’t say anything about\nthe nature of neutral entities. (1) says only what they are not;\n(2)–(4) specify certain roles that neutral entities can play,\nwithout telling us anything about the nature of the role occupants.\n(5) may fare better in this regard; but it raises problems of its own\n(see below). Some versions of neutral monism embrace this agnosticism\nabout the nature of the neutral base. David Chalmers has outlined the\nidea of Russellian neutral monism (see section\n 5.5\n below) with “fundamental protophenomenal properties serving as\nthe grounds for both physical and phenomenal properties”\n(Chalmers 2015: 264). Nothing is known about the protophenomenal other\nthan its ability to ground the two kinds of properties we are familiar\nwith. \nMany neutral monists have been more forthcoming, offering examples of\nneutral entities with which we are familiar. The three traditional\nneutral monists—Ernst Mach, William James, and Bertrand\nRussell—all pointed to experience, when attempting to provide\nexamples of neutral entities. Mach speaks of sensations, James of pure\nexperience, and Russell of sensations and percepts. Predictably, this\nfueled the suspicion that neutral monism is nothing but rebranded\nphenomenalism. Others have sought the neutral base in the realm of the\nabstract. Kenneth Sayre, for example, turns to the mathematical theory\nof information and suggests that the neutral base is to be understood\nas the “ontology of informational states” (Sayre 1976: 16)\nthat this theory presupposes. \nMost traditional versions of neutral monism were based on\n (1),\n the idea that the neutral is neither mental nor\nmaterial. But occasionally the understanding of neutrality is informed\nby criterion (5): the neutral is that which is both mental\nand material. This view has been attributed to Thomas Nagel\n(Godfrey-Smith 2013: 1–2; Skrbina 2005: 237; but see also\nsection\n 5.4).\n That which is both mental and material is biased towards neither and\nhence neutral between them. In this way the both-interpretation\ncaptures an intuitive notion of neutrality. Moreover, (5) may tell us\nmuch more about the nature of the neutral entities than (1)–(4)\ndo—just how much we learn about the nature of the neutral will\ndepend on how the relevant concepts of the mental and the physical are\nfleshed\n out.[2] \nThe appeal of the Both Interpretation of the idea of\nneutrality is undeniable. But it invites the conflation of neutral\nmonism with other theories from which is should be distinguished.\nFirst, there is the family of theories that attribute fundamental and\nirreducible mental and fundamental and irreducible material\nproperties, or aspects, or sides to every basic entity (see section\n 8.3).\n The Both Interpretation of neutral monism turns it into a\nversion of the dual-aspect theory—a theory that is often viewed\nas a form of dualism. Second, the Both Interpretation of\nneutrality makes it difficult to distinguish neutral monism from the\nidentity theory. According to the identity theory “being a\npain” and “being a c-fiber stimulation” pick out the\nvery same property (not two distinct and irreducible properties,\naspects, etc.). A natural way to state this idea is to say that a\ngiven property or state is both mental and physical. And this then\ninvites confusion with neutral monism, stated in terms of\n (5)—the\n Both Interpretation. The Neither Interpretation of\nneutrality allows us to understand neutral monism as a distinct type\nof theory. Because of its ability to distinguish views that are run\ntogether on the Both Interpretation, the Neither\nInterpretation is preferable. \nThere is, then, considerable disagreement about how to interpret the\nnotion of neutrality. The notion of monism raises its own problems.\nBut since these are questions faced by all forms of monism, they are,\nperhaps, not quite as pressing as the problems surrounding neutrality.\nMuch like one can distinguish different versions of neutral monism on\nthe basis of the notion of neutrality that they employ, it is possible\nto distinguish different versions of the doctrine, based on the\nvarious ways in which the notion of monism is understood (see Schaffer\n2016). Neutral monism might, for example, be interpreted as a form of\nexistence monism—the view that only a single concrete thing\nexists; but it might also interpreted as a monism about the kinds of\nthings there are—the view that concrete things, be they simple\nor complex, are of the same neutral kind. The evidence suggests that\nall past and present versions of neutral monism have been pluralist on\nboth these counts: they work with a plurality of entities, most\nparticularly, with a plurality of basic neutral entities; and, given\ntheir focus on the mind-body problem, they recognize at least mental\nand physical kinds of entities in addition to the neutral entities.\nAll entities belonging to such non-neutral kinds must, however, count\nas derivative. In the final analysis, all entities must be basic\nneutral entities or complexes of basic neutral entities. \nThe talk about basic entities indicates another pluralist dimension:\nthe known versions of neutral monism work with a layered picture of\nreality. Basic neutral entities form the bottom level of the\nhierarchy; the non-basic, non-neutral entities at the higher levels\nreduce to, or are in some sense derivative from, those lower level\nneutral entities. So we are dealing with an ontology that recognizes a\nplurality of levels or layers in reality. \nAnd even within the level of the basic neutral entities we can\ndistinguish those versions of neutral monism that hold that all basic\nentities belong to a single category, from those that distinguish two\nor more categories of neutral entities. Russell’s later version\nof neutral monism seems to be monistic (in this particular sense): all\nneutral entities are events. But it is easy to envision a neutral\nmonism that countenances neutral substances and neutral properties\namong the basic neutral entities. \nMost extant versions of neutral monism seem to acknowledge that, in\naddition to the basic neutral entities, there exist derivative,\nnon-basic, and non-neutral entities—mental and physical\nentities, for example. This raises the question about the relationship\nbetween these two kinds of entities. Every answer to this question\nfaces two challenges. On the one hand there is the threat of\nelimination of the non-basic entities (see section\n 7.1);\n on the other hand there is the threat that the non-basic, non-neutral\nentities turn into elements of ultimate reality, thereby putting an\nend to neutral monism. \nThe question of the relationship between basic and non-basic entities\nfeatures prominently in Russell’s thought. The method of logical\nconstruction (see section\n 4.3.1)\n is his answer to this question. The two other traditional neutral\nmonists—Mach and James—can arguably be characterized as\nreductionists (for an attempt to develop this claim a little further,\nsee the supplement\n Reducing Mind and Matter to Neutral Entities).\n The contemporary discussion of this question is most vigorously\naddressed by various philosophers in the Russellian monist camp (see\nsection\n 5.5).\n There is considerable agreement that the basic neutral entities are\nrelated to the non-basic, non-neutral entities by way of the grounding\nrelation. But many questions remain about the precise nature of the\nrelata of the relevant grounding relations (see section\n 5.5). \nBaruch Spinoza (1632–77) and David Hume (1711–76) are\noften identified as the originators of neutral monism. The case for\nincluding Spinoza runs as follows: \nSpinoza’s metaphysics of substance has been called neutral\nmonism; it is a form of monism because it allows\nfor only one substance, and it is neutral because he describes the one\nsubstance as both a body and a mind (Rosenkrantz and Hoffman 2011:\n287) \nTo classify Spinoza as an existence monist may be permissible. But the\nneutrality claim is based on the problematical both view of\nview of neutrality. This suggests that it is best to classify Spinoza\nas a double aspect theorist (see section\n 8.3\n below). Hume’s case is more difficult to assess. It has been\nsaid that the prevalent 20th century interpretation of Hume\nhas been neutral monist (see Flage 1982: 527). H.H. Price’s case\nfor this view has been particularly influential (see Price 1932:\n105–6). On the other hand, the neutral monist interpretation of\nHume has been vigorously resisted (Flage 1982; Backhaus 1991). \nIn light of these difficulties it is best to start the genealogy of\nneutral monism with the big three: Ernst Mach, William James,\nand Bertrand Russell. Of the three, only Russell uses the label\n“neutral monism”. But there is widespread agreement that\nMach, James, and Russell are the three most important philosophers in this\ntradition. A striking feature of traditional neutral monism—a\nreflection of the empiricist leanings of its protagonists—is the\nclose tie between the neutral entities and experience. This connection\nhas given rise to one of the most enduring criticisms of neutral\nmonism (see section\n 7.2).\n It is therefore important to note that this salient feature of\ntraditional neutral monism need be no part of it (see section\n 5.1). \nErnst Mach (1838–1916) occupies a central position in the\nhistory of neutral monism. He influenced William James and Bertrand\nRussell and, through them, all of the writers on neutral monism in the\nEnglish speaking world. His importance for the development in the\nGerman speaking world is hard to overestimate. Among the philosophers\nto build on Mach’s ideas was Rudolf Carnap in his\nAufbau (1928). As a physicist who also did physiological and\npsychological research, Mach strove to adopt an inclusive and\neconomical framework that would allow him to pursue all of these\ninquiries in a unified and coherent fashion. In the simple components\nof experience—hot and cold, red and green, sweet and sour,\netc.—he finds typical examples of a much larger group of\nelements whose functional interrelations are studied by the various\nsciences (see Banks 2014, ch. 1 on the resolute realism of Mach's\nview). While a given element is, intrinsically, neither mental nor\nphysical, the various groups to which it belongs may display\nfunctional relationships that are characteristic of physics or of\npsychology. In this case the neutral element forms part of the subject\nmatter of physics and of psychology. In the following quotation Mach\nuses a color and our perception of it to illustrate this point. A\nsingle neutral element—the color—gets to be both the\nphysical color of a physical object and our mental\nperception/sensation of it. The color can be called physical,\nqua constituent of the one group, and mental (a sensation),\nqua constituent of the other group, but is the same\nunchanging and intrinsically neutral element that figures in these two\ndifferent contexts: \nThus the great gulf between physical and psychological research\npersists only when we acquiesce in our habitual stereotyped\nconceptions. A color is a physical object as soon as we consider its\ndependence, for instance, upon its luminous source, upon other colors,\nupon temperatures, upon spaces, and so forth. When we consider,\nhowever, its dependence upon the retina…it is a psychological\nobject, a sensation. Not the subject matter, but the direction of\ninvestigation, is different in the two domains. (Mach 1886:\n17–18) \nIn this way material objects and the ego are dissolved into\nelements/sensations that are related in certain complex ways. Spelled\nout for material objects, this reads:  \nthing, body, matter, are nothing apart from the combinations of the\nelements,—the colors, sounds, and so forth—nothing apart\nfrom their so-called attributes. (Mach 1886: 7)  \nAnd the fate of the ego is similar: \nThe primary fact is not the ego, but the elements\n(sensations)…The elements constitute the I. I have the\nsensation green, signifies that the element green occurs in a given\ncomplex of other elements (sensations, memories). When I\ncease to have the sensation green, when I die, then the\nelements no longer occur in the ordinary, familiar association. That\nis all. Only and ideal mental-economical unity, not a real unity, has\nceased to exist. (Mach 1886: 23–24) \nFor Mach the world presents itself as “a viscous mass [of\nelements], at certain places (as in the ego) more firmly coherent than\nin others” (Mach 1886: 17). The neutral elements (only a minute\nfraction of which are sensations) and their relations are the basic\nreality. We draw boundaries around certain groups of elements that are\nrelated to each other in interesting ways, because this serves our\npurposes—the purposes of science and of ordinary life. We can\ncontinue to talk about material things and selves; it is economical to\ndo so. But, strictly speaking, “both [object and ego] are\nprovisional fictions of the same kind” (Mach 1905: 9). \nThe primary source for Mach’s views on neutral monism are a\nnumber of essays and chapters contained in his books that were\noriginally published in Mach 1886, 1894, and 1905. The size of these\nbooks grew significantly as they went through numerous editions. Some\nof the important papers on neutral monism are not contained in the\navailable English translations of these works. \nWilliam James’s (1842–1910) uses the term “radical\nempiricism” for the view he sets forth in James 1912—the\nview that has become the paradigm of neutral monism. His critique of\nthe relational account of experience—according to which the self\ndirects an act onto an object—was the model upon which Russell\nlater shaped his analysis of experience. James presents this argument\nas an attack on a particular conception of consciousness. He finds it\nin the Neo-Kantian tradition and in the early analytic tradition. And\ntoday we can find it in philosophies as diverse as existentialism and\nphilosophical naturalism. Roughly, it is the notion of consciousness\nas a diaphanous, transparent, elusive medium or container of some sort\nin which the objects of consciousness appear. The objects that are, in\nthis sense, “in” consciousness simply present themselves\nto us. But the consciousness that makes this kind of object\npresentation possible eludes our grasp. This thin notion of\nconsciousness is the one James wants to eliminate: \nI believe that ‘consciousness,’ when once it has\nevaporated to this estate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of\ndisappearing altogether. It is the name of a nonentity, and has no\nright to a place among first principles. Those who still cling to it\nare clinging to a mere echo, the faint rumor left behind by the\ndisappearing ‘soul’ upon the air of philosophy. (James\n1904b: 2) \nHis radical proposal is to simply discard this shadowy something and\nto make do with what remains, with what used to be the object of the\nconscious act. He introduces the term “pure experience” to\nstand for this datum. Prior to any further categorization, pure\nexperience is, according to James, neutral—neither mental nor\nphysical: \nThe instant field of the present is at all times what I call the\n‘pure’ experience. It is only virtually or potentially\neither object or subject as yet. For the time being, it is plain,\nunqualified actuality, or existence, a simple that. (James 1904b:\n23) \nMind and matter, knower and known, thought and thing, representation\nand represented are then interpreted as resulting from different\nfunctional groupings of pure experience (see James 1905: 64). \nIn perceptual knowledge perceiver and perceived fuse or merge (James\nuses both terms): one bit of pure experience is the thing perceived as\nwell as the perceiving of this thing. The difference lies only in how\nthis single portion of pure experience is related to other parts of\npure experience: \nThe paper seen and the seeing of it are only two names for one\nindivisible fact which, properly named, is the datum, the\nphenomenon, or the experience. The paper is in the mind and the\nmind is around the paper, because paper and mind are only two names\nthat are given later to the one experience, when, taken in a larger\nworld of which it forms a part, its connections are traced in\ndifferent directions. To know immediately, then, or intuitively,\nis for mental content and object to be identical. (James 1895:\n110) \nConceptual knowledge is more complex. In the simplest case of\nconceptual representation we are dealing with  \ntwo pieces of actual experience belonging to the same\nsubject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience\nbetween them. (James 1904a: 53)  \nThe first piece of pure experience is the thought—the thinking\nof it as well as the content that is thought—perhaps it is a\nthought about Harvard’s Memorial Hall, as in James’s\nfamous example (see James 1904a: 55ff). And, in the simplest case, the\nsecond piece of pure experience is the thing—Memorial\nHall—that was thought of, as well as the perception of Memorial\nHall. The thought has led us to Memorial Hall and now we stand in\nfront of it and see it. It is this function of leading (about\nthe details of which James has much to say) that constitutes the\nthought’s intentionality, that constitutes the fact that the\nthought was a thought about a certain thing. Once the thought has lead\none to the Hall,  \nthe percept not only verifies the concept, proves its\nfunction of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept’s\nexistence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries\ncreates the function. Whatever terminates that chain was,\nbecause it now proves itself to be, what the concept ‘had in\nmind’. (James 1904a: 60–1)  \nThis is James’s way of reconstructing the idea of representation\nin a way that does not invoke suspect mental powers of intrinsic\nintentionality. He values this as a signal achievement of his radical\nempiricism: \nThe towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in\nthe fact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\nrepresentative, not in any quasi-miraculous\n‘epistemological’ sense, but in the definite practical\nsense of being its substitute in various operations,\nsometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to its\nassociates and results. (James 1904a: 61) \nNot all conceptual experience results in knowledge. If the process of\nleading does not get started, or fails to arrive at an experience of\ntermination, there is nothing that the first piece of experience gets\nto know. In that case the representation is empty or false. \nThe essays in which James sets out his radical empiricism are among\nthe most influential and most readable documents of the neutral\nmonistic literature. It is probably fair to say that James converted\nRussell to neutral monism. And his influence on the neutral monists\namong the American New Realists is massive. The primary source for\nJames’s views on neutral monism are the essays collected in his\n1912. \nFollowing a series of critical engagements with neutral monism (see\nespecially Russell 1914a,b), Russell adopted it in Russell 1919 and\nremained a neutral monist for the rest of his long career: “I am\nconscious of no major change in my opinions since the adoption of\nneutral monism” is what he says in an interview from 1964 (Eames\n1969: 108). But the question whether Russell’s neutral monism is\nbest seen as a single theory or as a sequence of related but\nsignificantly different theories, as well as the question which, if\nany, of these different doctrines should count as versions of neutral\nmonism, have been much debated (see Wishon 2015; Bostock 2012; Stace\n1946). Russell’s 1919 and 1921 are generally considered to\nrepresent the early versions of his neutral monism. Russell’s\n1927a and 1927b contain the mature doctrine. In his later\nworks—Russell 1948 and 1956a—he no longer used the term\n“neutral monism”. But the doctrine seems largely\nunchanged. \nWhen Russell looks at neutral monism, he sees a theory that embodies\nthe spirit of the “supreme maxim in scientific\nphilosophising” (Russell 1914c: 155) in an especially striking\nway. This maxim is Occam’s Razor: entities are not to be\nmultiplied without necessity. In one of Russell’s formulations\nit reads: “Wherever possible, substitute constructions out of\nknown entities for inferences to unknown entities” (Russell\n1924: 326). Known entities are those that we know directly or\nnoninferentially; unknown entities are ones we accept only on the\nbasis of inferences from known entities. Russell’s maxim\nencourages us to discover complex structures of known entities that\ncan play the role the inferred entities were supposed to play. Upon\nsubstituting these complex structures—the\nconstructions—for the inferred entities, everything continues to\nwork as before. The point of this complicated procedure is epistemic:\nwe are now no longer burdened with the risky inference to the inferred\nentity, and the risk of error is reduced. Russell remains agnostic as\nto the existence of the target entities of construction. They are\nneither identified with nor eliminated by the corresponding\nconstruction. And no claim about supervenience, emergence,\nconstitution, or grounding is implied. \nNeutral monism holds out the alluring promise that such constructions\ncan be found for all of the inferred entities of physics, of\npsychology, and of common sense. All of these bodies of knowledge are\npreserved, but at a hugely reduced epistemic cost. These are the\nconsiderations that drive Russell to embrace neutral monism: it is a\nperfect fit with his longstanding commitment to the program of logical\nconstruction. An added benefit of substituting constructions of\nneutral entities for physical and mental entities is an elegant\nsolution to the mind-body problem. \nLogical construction is a process of discovery, not of manipulation:\nto logically construct xs out of ys is to discover that\nys, when they manifest a certain type of structure, can play\nthe role of xs. Russell’s constructions of a point in\nspace, an instant in time, a table, and of a belief may illustrate the\nprocedure. (i) A Russian doll is a good model of how Russell\n(following Whitehead) proposes to construct a point in space. The\nrough idea is to take “the class of all those objects which, as\none would naturally say, contain the point” (Russell 1914a: 117)\nand to substitute this class of nested objects (the structure of\nys) for points in space (the xs). (ii) Experienced\ninstants in time (the xs) are constructed by discovering that\nthe experiences of a person, each of which is extended in time, can\noverlap each other in ways that converge on an instant. It is  \na group of events, all belonging to his experience, and having the\nfollowing two properties: (1) any two of the events overlap; (2) no\nevent outside the group overlaps with every member of the group.\n(Russell 1927b: 288)  \n(iii) Rather than viewing a table as the cause of our table\nsensations, Russell proposes (again just as a first approximation) to\nview the table as “the set of all those particulars which would\nnaturally be called ‘aspects’ of the table from different\npoints of view” (Russell 1921: 98). (iv) The logical\nconstruction that is to take the place of beliefs consists of the\nfollowing three components:  \n(a) We have a proposition, consisting of interrelated images, and\npossibly partly of sensations; (b) we have the feeling of assent,\nwhich is presumably a complex sensation demanding analysis; (c) we\nhave a relation, actually subsisting, between the assent and the\nproposition, such as is expressed by saying that the proposition in\nquestion is what is assented to. (Russell 1921: 251) \nAs these examples show, there is no single method of construction, no\nsingle type of structure, suitable for different projects of logical\nconstruction. The nature of the xs (the targets of\nconstruction) and of the ys (the construction materials) guide\nthe search for structures that will work in the case at hand. \nThe initial stock of known entities with which Russell proposes to\ncarry out this grand project of logical construction seems frightfully\nsmall and strikingly non-neutral. It consists of his sensations and\nimages—these loom large in Russell 1919, 1921—and his\nperceptions (percepts)—these play a prominent role in Russell\n1927a, 1927b, 1948. Everything else—electrons, apples, galaxies,\nand selves, etc.—is in need of logical construction. \nFor an entity to be neutral is to “have neither the hardness and\nindestructibility of matter, nor the reference to objects which is\nsupposed to characterize the mind” (Russell 1921: 36; cf. 124).\nRussell never suspected sensations of being material (in this sense).\nThat sensations are mental (in this sense)—that they consist of\na mental act of sensing directed at a non-mental object—was,\nhowever, a pivotal part of his earlier view. But then his views\nchanged:  \nI formerly believed that my own inspection showed me the distinction\nbetween a noise [the object] and my hearing of a noise [the act of\nsensing], and I am now convinced that it shows me no such thing, and\nnever did. (Russell 1918b: 255)  \nAll that Russell now finds upon introspecting a sensory episode is a\nsingle item “which may be called indifferently a noise or\nhearing a noise” (Russell 1918b: 255). Switching the example to\ncolors, he writes that  \nthe sensation we have when we see a patch of colour simply is\nthat patch of colour…the patch of colour and our sensation in\nseeing it are identical. (Russell 1921: 142–3)  \nAnd since noises and patches of color are not intentional—they\nare not directed at anything, they are simply there—sensations\nare non-mental. This establishes the neutrality of sensations. And\nbecause images have the same intrinsic nature as sensations (cf.\nRussell 1921: 117, 121, 154, 156, 287, 297), they too are\n neutral.[3]\n Percepts are composed of sensations and images and inherit their\nneutrality. \nRussell’s focus on sensations, images, and percepts explains why\nRussell’s neutral monism has often been dismissed as a form of\nphenomenalism. But in the preceding section we have seen how Russell\nargued for the nonmentality of these items. Moreover this criticism\noverlooks that Russell worked with a vastly expanded set of\nconstruction materials. He allows for the enlargement of the realm of\nthe known by a series of cautious\n inferences.[4]\n In a first step he argues that “all our percepts are composed\nof imperceptible parts” (Russell 1927a: 282); second, there are\nsensations, images, and percepts that are not our own; third, and most\nimportantly, we can infer the existence of vast numbers of entities\nthat “do not form part of any experience” (Russell 1921:\n 25).[5]\n In this way Russell arrives at the view “that the world is very\nfull of events” (Russell 1927a: 258), only a vanishingly small\nnumber of which are his own experiences. \nOur own percepts, images, and\n sensations[6]\n occupy a privileged place in this system of entities—they are\n“what is most indubitable in our knowledge of the world”\n(Russell 1927b: 139). This knowledge is of a “more intimate\nqualitative” (Russell 1927a: 389) kind; it reveals the intrinsic\ncharacter of these entities. But our knowledge of the “physical\nworld [the world constructed out of entities outside my experience] is\npurely abstract: “we know certain logical characteristics of its\nstructure, but nothing of its intrinsic character” (Russell\n1927b: 306–307). \nRussell takes all of these different entities to be neutral (in the\nNeither Sense); and he takes all of them to be\n events[7],\n where an event is understood as “something occupying a small\nfinite amount of space–time” (Russell 1927b: 287). The\nnoise and the color patch considered above are typical examples of\nevents. A Russellian event is absolute, in C.D. Broad’s sense:\n“it should not itself be a state of invariance or of\nchange in the qualities or relationships of any thing” (Broad\n1959: 739; see also Maxwell 1978: 385–6 on pure events).\nAccording to Russell, physics teaches that events “just happen,\nand do not happen ‘to’ matter or ‘to’ anything\nelse” (Russell 1927b: 289). This means that we must not think of\nmental events (or any events) “as consisting of motions of bits\nof matter” (Russell 1927b: 292), for “matter in\nmotion…is not an event in our sense” (Russell 1927b:\n296). \nRussell’s neutral monist universe is a plenum of (absolute)\nevents—a vast assemblage of overlapping small occurrences which,\ngiven their short lifespan, are constantly replaced by new events.\nThis mass of ever-changing events manifests all sorts of complex\ndynamic patterns. We have not yet discovered the laws that govern\nthese events and give rise to the formation of these complex dynamic\npatterns. But we have physics, which describes the behavior of certain\ngroups of law-governed events under the name of matter. And we have\npsychology, which describes a set of quite different regularities that\nobtain in very specific regions of this plenum of events—viz. in\nthose regions that are filled by the pieces of matter that are called\nbrains. But all the building blocks of the logical constructions that\nare matter, and all the building blocks of the logical constructions\nthat are mental stats, have the same nature—they are neutral\nevents. \nThere are, of course, many other philosophers whom one might want to\ninclude in the list of neutral monists. In the German speaking world\nwe find Richard Avenarius (1843–96), who was in contact with\nMach, and Joseph Petzoldt (1862–1929), who built on the work of\nAvenarius. Avenarius’s main reflections on neutral monism are\ncontained in Avenarius 1888/90, 1891, and 1894/95. Petzoldt’s\nrelevant works are Petzoldt 1900, 1904 and 1906. In the English\nspeaking world, neutral monism thrived within the movement of American\nnew realism. Ralph Barton Perry (1876–1957)—a student and\nfriend of James—is the most visible neutral monist of this\ngroup. His 1912 is the main source for his views about neutral monism.\nAnd Edwin B. Holt (1873–1946) developed an ambitious neutral\nmonist program in his 1912 and 1914. \nAnticipating the current revival in interest in neutral monism by a\nfew decades, Kenneth Sayre (1929–) published his main ideas on\nneutral monism in the 1970s. Unlike the big three, Sayre\nfinds the neutral base of his system not in experience, but in the\nPlatonic realm of pure information, where information is understood in\nthe strict information theoretical sense. His proposal must not be\nmistaken for the uncontroversial claim that that mental and physical\nprocesses can be described in information theoretic terms. Sayre puts\nforward an ontological claim about the ultimate nature of\nreality—that ultimate reality consists of informational\nstates: \nIf the project…is successful, it will have been shown not only\nthat the concept of information provides a primitive for the analysis\nof both the physical and the mental, but also that states of\ninformation…existed previously to states of mind. Since\ninformation in this sense is prior to mentality, but also implicated\nin all mental states, it follows that information is prior also in the\nontological sense…Success of the present project thus will show\nthat an ontology of informational states is adequate for an\nexplanation of the phenomena of mind, as distinct from an ontology of\nphysical events. [And Sayre adds:] It is a reasonable conjecture that\nan ontology of information is similarly basic to the physical\nsciences…. (Sayre 1976: 16) \nThe greatest challenge faced by the traditional versions of neutral\nmonism is to show how basic entities that are derived from experience\ncan be neutral, rather than mental. By choosing an ontology of\ninformational states as his “neutral stuff”, Sayre\nelegantly bypasses this problem. But while the neutrality of\ninformational states may be taken for granted, the question of the\nrelationship of this abstract “stuff” to concrete world of\nphysical and mental entities becomes all the more pressing. \nSayre’s main work on neutral monism is his 1976. More recently\nDavid Chalmers has explored the idea of an informational ontology (see\nChalmers 1996). And the related ideas that ultimate reality purely\nstructural (Ladyman and Ross 2007; Floridi 2008, 2009), that it is a\ncomputational process (Fredkin 2003; Lloyd 2006), or a purely\nmathematical (Tegmark 2014) are the subject of a lively\ndiscussion. \nIn his recent book The Realistic Empiricism of Mach, James, and\nRussell. Neutral Monism Reconceived (2014), Erik Banks presents a\ncritical survey of the big three of neutral monism, as well as his own\ndevelopment of the doctrine. \nThe neutral monist core of Banks’s view amounts to this:  \nindividual events are neutral, neither mental nor physical. Neutral\nevents make up “physical” systems and extensions and\n“mental” sensations in minds through different functional\nrelations. (Banks 2014: 203)  \nThis is very much in keeping with the traditional version of neutral\nmonism, especially the event-based flavor of the view that Russell\nadvocated in the years after 1927. But Banks embeds this core idea\ninto a larger metaphysical framework. The resulting theory is\nthoroughly original. \nIn a first step, Banks explains how this core idea fits into a larger\na posteriori physicalist picture. Physicalism, according to\nBanks, is best thought of as the view that mental supervenes on the\nphysical. Standard physicalism focuses on the question of how mental\nproperties and relations depend physical properties and relations. But\nstandard physicalism does not specify the nature of the entities that\nexemplify these properties and relations. Any set of entities will do,\nso long as the supervenience relationships between the physical and\nmental properties and relations are preserved. Enhanced physicalism\ngoes beyond standard physicalism in specifying the nature of the\nentities that bear or instantiate the relevant properties and\nrelations:  \nIn enhanced physicalism…the instantiation of all physical\nproperties are individualized event particulars in causal-functional\nrelations to each other. (Banks 2014: 147)  \nThis is how the neutral events slot into the enhanced physicalist\npicture that Banks favors. \nIn a second step, Banks provides us with an account of events. Events\nhave, and are individuated by, intrinsic characters or concrete\nqualities. None of those qualities are mental; but experience\nfamiliarizes us with some of those qualities (see Banks 2014: 6).\nThese qualities are the ways certain powers manifest themselves in\nevents (see Banks 2014: 6). Examples of the sorts of powers (or\nenergies) are electromagnetism, gravitation, and nuclear forces, and,\nmost relevant in the present context, neural energy—the internal\nenergies in neurons (see Banks 2014,149, 203). Manifesting itself\nqualitatively at the level of the single neuron, this energy may yield\nan electrical discharge event; but manifesting itself at the level of\na complex brain event—an event that is “somehow\n‘composed’ of neurons firing in some kind of\ncluster” (Banks 2014: 147)—this very same neural energy\nmay yield the event that is a sensation of blue. This closes the\napparent chasm between the experience of blue and the firing of a\nbunch of neurons, once it is understood that  \nthe quality blue and the individual electrical discharges are just\ndifferent and mutually exclusive manifestations of the same natural\npowers which we mistakenly see as belonging to totally different\ncategories of event. (Banks 2014: 164) \nThis is an attractive picture, but it is difficult to see it as a\nmonism of neutral events. Wherein does the neutrality of these\nevents—an experience of blue and neural firing\nevents—consist? It does appear, moreover, that events (whether\nneutral or not) no longer play a fundamental ontological role. In\ntheir place we find the powers/energies that give rise to events. \nBanks addresses this second problem head on. Powers are identical with\ntheir token manifestations, identical with the events that consist in\nthe individual qualities wherein these powers manifest\n themselves[8]\n (see Banks 2014: 149). That is, there is no separate, more\nfundamental level of reality underlying the events. The powers just\nare the events. The neural energy is identical with the event\nthat is the electrical discharges of a group of neurons; this same\nneural energy is also identical with event that is a sensation of\nblue. But, and this is a crucial part of Banks’s view, the\ndischarge events are not identical with the blue sensation. Banks sees\nthe question that this poses clearly:  \nhow can it be the case that the powers are identical with each of\ntheir token manifestations and even identical qua powers across\ndifferent token manifestation events, but that different token\nmanifestation events are not identical to each other? (Banks 2014:\n149)  \nThis is not an easy knot to unravel. Perhaps an appeal to relative\nidentity might help. \nAssuming that the fundamentality of events has been established, we\nstill face the question in which sense they qualify as neutral.\nConsider  \nthe event of seeing a blue patch and the event of having all the\nconfigured neurons fire in the region of the brain\nresponsible for seeing the blue patch. (Banks 2014: 164)  \nTo the naïve opinion that the first of these events is mental,\nwhile the second is physical, Banks replies as follows: \nThe phenomenon of sensation simply falls into place as a certain type\nof physical event among others in nature. The separate category of\nmental phenomena simply ceases to exist, except as a provisional way\nof talking. (Banks 2014: 164) \nThe monism expressed in this answer is beyond reasonable doubt; but\nthe neutrality is somewhat elusive. \nFor want of a better label, John Heil has presents his view on the\nmind-body relation as a form of neutral monism. He resists being\nlabeled a materialist  \nbecause it carries with it the implication that there is an\nasymmetryin the identification of mental qualities with\nmaterial qualities: the mental is supplanted by the material. (Heil\n2013: 242)  \nNor does he see himself as an idealist. And he has systematic and deep\nreasons for rejecting the property dualism that characterizes the\nvarious versions of nonreductive materialism. The neutral monism that\nhe accepts is characterized as follows: \nNeutral monism includes the denial that there is a\nmental–material chasm to be bridged. The mental–material\ndistinction is, as Spinoza and Donald Davidson contend, a distinction\nof conception only, not a realdistinction, not a distinction\nin reality. (Heil 2013: 242) \nAn example will help to illustrate the gist of this view. Take the\nwell-worn claim that pain is c-fiber\n stimulation.[9]\n According to Heil, this says that the predicate “c-fiber\nstimulation” and the predicate “pain” apply to the\nsame things: all things that are truly described as being c-fiber\nstimulations are also truly described as pains. But—and this is\na crucial claim that cannot be developed here—this does\nnot mean that there is a property of being a c-fiber\nstimulation and a property of being a pain, and that these two\nproperties stand in some interesting relationship, such as identity,\nreduction, realization, etc. What this does mean is that there is a\ncomplex object that makes both of these claims true. The nature of the\nparts of this object, as well as their intricate relationships to one\nanother, is the reality that is correctly described as a c-fiber\nstimulation and as a pain. \nThis part of Heil’s account appears to be consistent with the\nspirit of traditional neutral monism. One is reminded of\nRussell’s pithy description of his project: “What I wish\nto do in this essay is to restate the relations of mind and brain in\nterms not implying the existence of either” (Russell 1956a:\n145). This can easily be read as a denial of the existence of a chasm\nbetween mental and physical properties. And Heil’s complex\nobjects that serve as the truth-makers for mental and physical\ndescriptions may be seen as analogous to Russell’s groups\n(logical constructions) of events that can properly be described in\nphysical and mental terms. This makes for a significant parallel\nbetween the two views. \nBut there is an additional part to the neutral monist\npicture—one that all of the mainline neutral monists agree\non—that Heil rejects. When he tells the “deep story”\n(Heil’s term) about the nature of the complex objects (the\ntruth-makers for claims about c-fibers and pains etc.), he turns to\nfundamental physics:  \nI take it to be an empirical question—a question for science,\nfor fundamental physics—what the substances are and what they\nare like, how they are. (Heil 2013: 201–2)  \nSo the basic constituents of the world—the substances and the\nproperties—that Heil describes are, in the best sense of the\nterm, physical. Here the neutral monist (who is committed to\nthe Neither View of neutrality parts company with Heil. The\ndeep story of the neutral monist has it that the fundamental\nentities—be they events, bits of information, substances,\nproperties, etc.—are not physical (and not mental, of course).\nThat is to say, they are not the sort of thing that fundamental\nphysics (or psychology) reveals. \nIn his recent book Mind and Cosmos (2012) Thomas Nagel\nasserts that “the weight of the evidence favors some form of\nneutral monism over the traditional alternatives of materialism,\nidealism, and dualism” (2012: 5). Neutral monism is understood\nas a view that “accounts for the relation between mind and brain\nin terms of something more basic about the natural order” (2012:\n56). This yields a picture of a “general monism according to\nwhich the constituents of the universe have properties that explain\nnot only its physical but its mental character” (2012: 56).\nBorrowing a concept from Tom Sorrell (whom Nagel cites approvingly),\nwe can say that these basic constituents of the universe are\n“transphysical and transmental” (2012: 57). This nicely\ncaptures the relevant sense of neutrality. The claim that all of the\nbasic constituents must be of the same kind—the conclusion that\nwe are dealing with a monism—is supported by the consideration\nthat any basic constituent could be part of a psychophysical creature,\nsuch as ourselves. Hence every basic constituent must be of the kind\nthat can explain the physical and mental traits as we know them.  \nAll that has been said up to this point supports the view that Nagel\nendorses neutral monism. But what Nagel says next seems to contradict\nthis simple picture. He writes: \nEverything, living or not, is constituted from elements having a\nnature that is both physical and nonphysical—that is, capable of\ncombining into mental wholes. So this reductive account can also be\ndescribed as a form of panpsychism: all the elements of the physical\nworld are also mental. (Nagel 2012: 57) \nNote that the description of the basic constituents has changed from\n“transphysical and transmental” to “physical and\nmental”—from the Neither View to the Both\nView. And Nagel is very much aware that these are not the same\nthing. In an earlier paper in which he considers neutral monism, he\nwrites: \nthis view would imply that the fundamental constituents of the world,\nout of which everything is composed, are neither physical nor mental\nbut something more basic. This position is not equivalent to\npanpsychism. Panpsychism is, in effect, dualism all the way down. This\nis monism all the way down. (Nagel 2002: 231) \nIs there a way to overcome this apparent tension and to see these two\nviews as parts of a coherent whole? In a personal communication Prof.\nNagel offered the following explanation:  \nthe fundamental elements would be neither merely physical nor merely\nmental, but something that was necessarily both physical and mental,\n(or protomental); but since this necessary connection can’t hold\ndirectly between the physical and the mental as we conceive them, it\nwould require that the real character of these fundamental\nconstituents be something more basic that accounts for their being\nboth physical and (proto)mental. \nThe resulting picture is this. Described at the most fundamental\nlevel, the constituents of the world have properties that are neither\nmental nor physical. These neutral properties of every fundamental\nentity give rise to physical and mental (or protomental) properties.\nThus each fundamental constituent is complex: it has mental (or\nprotomental) properties, it has physical properties, and it has these\ntwo sets of properties as a necessary consequence of its having a\nthird set of properties—the neutral properties. \nThe foundational role played by the neutral properties (in the\nNeither Sense) suggests that the view is a form of neutral\nmonism. This interpretation can be further supported by arguing that\nthe neutral properties ground the other properties of the basic\nentities, and that grounded properties make for “no addition to\nbeing”. \nOthers will object to the neutral monist interpretation of\nNagel’s view, insisting that basic entities that have mental and\nphysical properties cannot count as neutral, given the Neither\nSense of\n neutrality.[10]\n The case for calling it a panpsychism rests on the fact that each\nfundamental entity has mental features. The case for calling it a\ndual-aspect theory rests on the fact that each fundamental entity has\nphysical and mental features. And if neutrality is understood in the\nBoth Sense, then this very same fact indicates that we are\ndealing with a version of neutral monism after all. But if one follows\nthe traditional neutral monists in understanding neutrality in the\nNeither Sense, and if one follows them further in assuming\nthat the properties of being mental and being physical are properties\nthat can only be possessed by groups of basic entities, not by\nindividual basic entities, then it is advisable to deny that\nNagel’s view is a version of neutral monism. Perhaps it is best\ncharacterized as a form of the dual-aspect theory, or as a form of\nproperty dualism, if aspects are distinguished from properties (see\nsection\n 8.3\n below). \nIn the search for a solution to the mind-body problem one may be\ncaptivated by the thought that we know less about matter than we are\ncommonly led to believe. All we do (or can) know are the dispositional\nproperties of\n matter.[11]\n When combined with the insight that dispositions need categorical\ngrounds, one discovers that one’s conception of matter is\nradically incomplete. In addition to all the dispositional properties\nthat physics treats of, matter must have intrinsic categorical\nproperties. Since the nature of these intrinsic properties is unknown,\nthe following bold thought suggests itself. Perhaps these properties\nplay a dual role: in addition to grounding to dispositional properties\nof matter, they also serve as the grounds of our conscious experience.\nThese are the kinds of considerations that may lead one to Russellian\nmonism, the view that  \nmatter has intrinsic properties that both constitute consciousness and\nserve as categorical bases for the dispositional properties described\nin physics. (Alter and Nagasawa 2015: 1)  \nThe basic constituents of the world of Russellian monism are the\nfundamental entities of physics (not the insubstantial events of\nRussell’s world). But the most fundamental properties of these\nfundamental entities are not their physical properties, but the\nintrinsic properties in virtue of which they have those physical\nproperties. And these same intrinsic properties do, when arranged\nappropriately, give rise to conscious experience. Therein consists the\nmonism of this view: at the bottom there are fundamental entities with\ncertain intrinsic properties; all else is grounded in this fact. \nThere are many versions of Russellian Monism. Differences are due, in\npart, to varying views about the relations between the intrinsic\nproperties, on the one side, and the mental and physical properties,\non the other. But the central disagreement concerns the nature of the\nintrinsic properties. They have been held to be physical (Montero\n2015; Pereboom 2015), mental (Bolender 2001), mental and physical\n(Strawson 2015, 2016), or neutral (Coleman 2014). Accordingly there\nare physicalist, idealist (mentalist), and neutral monist versions or\nRussellian monism. The precise nature of these disagreements are\ndifficult to pin down, given the number of different notions of the\nmental and the physical that are in play in this discussion. \nThe best known version of Russellian neutral monism is\npanprotopsychism—a view that David Chalmers has explored over\nmany years (Chalmers 1996, 2015). In the standard form of this theory\nthe postulated intrinsic properties are characterized as being neither\nexperiential (they are proto-psychic) nor physical (they lack\nthe structural/dispositional nature of physical properties). That\nmakes them neutral (in the Neither Sense). But this purely\nnegative characterization of the intrinsic properties has occasioned\nconsiderable discomfort. A variant of this\ntheory—panqualityism—addresses this problem in a most\nsatisfactory manner, while creating new problems of its own. \nIt takes redness, greenness, sweetness, roundness, etc.—the\nprimitive sensory qualities given to us in experience, and considered\njust as such—to be the intrinsic properties of the fundamental\nphysical entities (cf. Chalmers 2015: 272). One’s being aware of\nredness—i.e., the property of phenomenal redness—is\nmental, but redness itself is not. Nor is (this kind of) redness a\nphysical, structural property. So panqualityism has secured a neutral\nbase with which we are intimately familiar. \nPanqualityism has its contemporary defenders—Chalmers points to\nSam Coleman’s neutral monist proposal (Coleman 2014). And he\nboldly conjectures that  \nversions of the view itself were popular among the neutral monists of\nthe early twentieth century, including William James (1904b), Ernst\nMach (1886), and Bertrand Russell (1921). (Chalmers 2015: 271) \nOne may wonder how an electron’s being red can ground its\nnegative charge. And one may agree with Chalmers that qualities, no\nmatter how intricately arranged, cannot ground the phenomenal\nproperties of our experience. For “no instantiations of\nqualities ever necessitate awareness of qualities” (Chalmers\n2015: 273). Finally, one may share Wilfrid Sellars’s (1963: 35)\nview that it makes no sense to think that fundamental physical\nentities might have primitive sensory qualities like redness. \nWhat the consideration of Russellian Monism shows is that (i) new\nversions of neutral monism are currently being developed that borrow\nrelatively little from the ideas of traditional neutral monism; (ii)\nbut even the most developed versions of Russellian neutral monism face\nconsiderable problems. \nThe case for neutral monism is best made by enumerating its\nvirtues. \nWe have already Russell’s reasons for valuing ontological\nparsimony (see section \n 4.3.1\n above). Neutral monism has this theoretical virtue to a high degree.\nThe “immense simplification” (Russell 1959: 252) it\naffords was what most attracted him to this view. The spirit of\nMach’s neutral monism is similarly antimetaphysical:  \nnothing is important except what can be observed or is a datum for us,\nand everything hypothetical, metaphysical and superfluous, is to be\neliminated. (Mach 1886: 27–28)  \nFirst on the list of “metaphysical entities” (Mach 1905:\n13) that have to go are “the ‘unfathomable’ thing\nand the equally ‘unexplorable’ ego” (Mach 1905: 8).\nAnd James concurs: “Consciousness as it is ordinarily understood\ndoes not exist, any more than does Matter” (James 1905: 63). \nMach, James, and Russell agree that neutral monism solves the\nmind-body problem. Russell’s account of experience (of\nperceptual consciousness) may serve as an illustration of the point.\nRussell frequently emphasized the miracle or mystery involved in\ntraditional accounts of perception (1927b: 147, 154; 1927a: 275, 400).\nAt the end of a purely physical chain of causes there mysteriously\narises something of a completely different nature: an experience (a\nsensation of red, say). This is the hard problem of consciousness. The\nneutral monist solves this problem by maintaining that “we\ncannot say that ‘matter is the cause of our sensations”\n(1927b: 290). Mach agrees: “Bodies do not produce\nsensations” (Mach 1886: 29). To suggest otherwise is to rely on\n“the monstrous idea of employing atoms to explain psychical\nprocesses” (Mach 1886: 311). Matter/bodies are, after all,\nnothing but collections of neutral entities, i.e., of Russellian\nevents or Machian elements. So mind-body causation reduces to causal\nrelations among events or elements. And, for all we know, the\nevent/element causing a sensation may be quite similar to the\nsensation it causes. This closes the apparent chasm between the\n“material process” and the ensuing experience, and the\nmystery of perception vanishes. \nThe Analysis of Matter (Russell 1927a) is widely regarded as\nthe most important text of the neutral monist literature. Chapter one\nof this book, entitled “The Nature of the Problem”, states\nit as follows:  \nthe world of physics is, prima facie, so different from the\nworld of perception that it is difficult to see how the one can afford\nevidence for the other; moreover, physics and physiology themselves\nseem to give grounds for supposing that perception cannot give very\naccurate information as to the external world, and thus weaken the\nprops upon which they are built…We must therefore find an\ninterpretation of physics which gives a due place to perceptions; if\nnot, we have no right to appeal to the empirical evidence. (Russell\n1927a: 6–7; see also Russell 1948: Part III, Ch. IV)  \nThe previous remarks addressed to the mind-body problem in general,\nand to the problem of perceptual experience in particular, contain the\ncore of the solution Russell proposes. By “bridging the gulf\nbetween physics (as commonly interpreted) and perception”\n(Russell 1927a: 7), neutral monism promises to solve this\nproblem—a problem that Russell took to be difficult and largely\nunnoticed (see Russell 1948: 175–176). \nMach and James understand neutral monism as an especially radical form\nof achieving perceptual contact with the world. It might be understood\nas a limiting case of naïve realism—a case in which the\nrelation between the subject and its perceptual object becomes the\nidentity relation. In perception “subject and object\nmerge” (James 1905: 57). A single reality—a red patch,\nsay, when we see a tomato—is a constituent of two groups of\nneutral entities: the group that is the perceiver, and the group that\nis the tomato. The mind and its object become one. In James’s\nwords:  \nA given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context of\nassociates, play[s] the part of the knower, or a state of mind, or\n“consciousness”; while in a different context the same\nundivided bit of experience plays the part of a thing known, of an\nobjective “content”. In a word, in one group it figures as\na thought, in another group as a thing. (James 1904b: 9–10)  \nSome have seen this epistemic achievement as the most important reward\nof neutral monism. \nBut Russell dissented. There are well known problems surrounding\naccounts of perception that conceive it as a form of direct contact\nwith the world. Among them are the problems arising from the fact that\nan object can present different and incompatible appearances to\ndifferent observers. Some neutral monists concluded that “nature\nis a seething chaos of contradiction” (Holt 1914: 276). But\nRussell chose to abandon the view that in perception “subject\nand object merge”. Instead he locates the red patch you see when\nlooking at a tomato in your brain, and distinguishes it from the\ntomato (from the group of events that constitute the tomato). That is\nwhy he can assert that he “know[s] about what is happening in\nthe brain exactly what naïve realism thinks it knows about what\nis happening in the outside world” (Russell 1927b: 138). This\nsolves the problem of different and incompatible appearances:\ncompatibility is restored by moving the conflicting features away from\nthe single physical object and into the brains of the different\npercipients. But in making this move Russell abandons the naïve\nrealism of Mach and James and puts a version of representative realism\nin its place. Thereby the problem of our knowledge of the external\nworld is reintroduced in full\n force.[12] \nMach operates on the assumption that all sciences form a whole (see\nMach 1886: 30). The great virtue of neutral monism is that it affords\na unified perspective from which scientific inquiry can be undertaken:\n \nwhat I aimed at was merely to attain a safe and clear philosophical\nstandpoint, whence practicable paths, shrouded in no metaphysical\nclouds, might be seen leading not only into the field of physics but\nalso into that of psycho-physiology. (Mach 1886: 47) \nThe idea of neutral monism as a bridge between different sciences is\nalso present in Russell. He presents neutral monism as  \nan attempt to harmonize two different tendencies, one in psychology,\nthe other in physics…[viz.]…the materialistic tendency\nof psychology and the anti-materialistic tendency of physics. (Russell\n1921: 5–6) \nAccording to Jerry Fodor, “the form of a philosophical theory,\noften enough, is: Let’s try looking over here”\n(Fodor 1981: 31). The current revival of interest in neutral monism\nis, perhaps, best seen as part of the general movement to explore all\npossible options in the metaphysics of consciousness—a movement\nthat is driven by the sense that the traditional positions face\ninsurmountable obstacles. David Chalmers’s paper\n“Panpsychism and Panprotopsychism” (Chalmers 2015)\nprovides an illuminating account of the dialectic that drives some\ncontemporary philosophers to explore the little known neutral monistic\nterritory. \nEvery version of reductionism must deal with the question of the\nontological status of the entities it reduces: are they retained or\neliminated? Both of these components are present in traditional\nneutral monism. It eliminates mind and matter as these are\ntraditionally conceived. There are neither “solid\npersistent objects moving through space”, nor are there states\nwith an inbuilt and primitive “reference to objects”\n(Russell 1921: 124, 36). But, on the other hand, it provides\nconstructions of neutral entities that are designed to play the roles\nof the entities they displace. On this picture there is no sharp\nboundary between retention and elimination. As the distance between\nthe two roles—that played by the target entity, and that played\nby its neutral monist replacement—increases we move from the\npole of retention toward that of elimination. The success of this\nstrategy will have to be assessed on a case by case basis. There are\nrelatively few objections to neutral monism that turn on the details\nof proposed reductions. (But see C.D. Broad’s critique of\nRussell, 1925: 577–584). This fact may, however, owe less to the\nexcellence than to the rarity of such reductions in the literature.\nThe most challenging criticisms of neutral monism do not engage with\ntechnical details, but aim squarely at the central idea of the\ndoctrine—the idea of neutrality. \nThe most frequent type of objection to the traditional versions of\nneutral monism is that they are all forms of mentalistic monism:\nBerkleyan idealism, panpsychism, or phenomenalism. The argument is\nsimple: sensations (Mach), pure experience (James) and\nsensations/percepts (Russell) are paradigms of non-neutral, mental\nentities. Hence there is nothing neutral about these versions of\nneutral monism. The prima facie plausibility of this\nobjection is beyond doubt. But it is also clear that Mach, James, and\nRussell were acutely aware of the problem and took themselves to have\nresponded in a satisfactory manner. They reject the view that a\nsensation or an experience consists of a subject directing a mental\nact—awareness, consciousness, acquaintance—onto on an\nobject. Dispensing with the subject and the act, they are left with\nwhat used to be the object—a red patch, say. And they hold that\nthere is nothing mental about red patches. All it takes for this red\npatch to turn into a red-sensation is for it to be appropriately\nrelated to other entities of the same kind. There is no quick way to\nadjudicate this dispute. A careful assessment of each case is\nrequired. This type of objection—the “mentalism\nsuspicion”—has been articulated by a diverse group of\nphilosophers, among them: (Lenin 1909: 34; Stace 1946; Ayer 1971;\nFeigl 1958: 426, 1975: 26–7; Maxwell 1976: 354; Popper &\nEccles 1977: 199; Strawson 1994: 97; Chalmers 1996: 155; Tully 2003:\n355, 369). \nThe second type of objection to neutral monism argues that neutral\nmonism cannot accommodate experience. The argument is driven by two\ndeep metaphysical convictions. First, experience cannot be reduced to\n(or constructed from) the non-experiential; second, strong emergence\n(see section\n 8.4\n below) is unintelligible. Assuming that the neutral must be\nnon-experiential, it follows that the neutral monist world has no room\nfor experience. Galen Strawson has wielded this argument against all\nforms of traditional materialism, and occasionally also against\nneutral monism (see Strawson 1994: 46–54, 96–99; Strawson\n2016.). \nChalmers’s main objection to the panqualityist form of neutral\nmonism (see section\n 4.3.2\n above) though stated in different terms, leads up to the same result.\nThere is no path that leads from the qualities we experience (but\nwhich are not experiential themselves) to the experience of those\nqualities. Having an experience is a matter of having phenomenal\nqualities. Phenomenal qualities involve awareness of qualities. But\n“no instantiations of qualities ever necessitate awareness of\nqualities” (Chalmers 2015: 273). This “quality/awareness\ngap” (Chalmers 2015: 273) shows that no structure of qualities\ncan add up to\n experience.[13] \nBut is it really true that the resources of neutral monism are too\nlimited to “manufacture” awareness? Here it is instructive\nto reflect briefly on Russell’s changing ideas about awareness.\nBefore embracing neutral monism, Russell defended a simple and very\ninfluential account of awareness: to be aware of x (a red sense-datum,\nsay) just is to bear a special (simple and unanalyzable)\nrelation to x—the so-called acquaintance relation. We have seen\nthat Russell abandoned this account of awareness (see section\n 4.3.2\n above). But perhaps it is possible to rebuild a structurally similar\naccount of awareness within the neutral monist framework. In place of\na simple (Cartesian style) subject or self, there now is a complex\nbundle-self (composed of neutral events). In place of a simple\ntwo-place relation of acquaintance, there now is a complex n-place\nrelation obtaining between x (a red patch, say) and the various other\nevents composing the complex bundle self of which the red patch is a\nmember. And for S (the bundle-self) to be aware of x (the red patch)\njust is for x to bear this special n-place relation to x to\nthe other members of the bundle that make up S. The overall shape of\nthe two accounts of awareness is the same: a self bearing a special\nrelation to an object. This suggests the following thought: if it is\ngranted that Russell’s old account of awareness did shed some\nlight one the question how experience enters the world, then why not\naccept that the new (neutral monistically reconstructed) account of\nawareness is equally illuminating. So if the quality/awareness gap had\nno force against Russell’s old account of awareness, then we\nshould not expect it to have force against the neutral monistically\nreconstructed account of awareness. \nThis does not establish that neutral monism can overcome the problem\nof experience. Both accounts can be rejected, either on the grounds\nthat experience is fundamental and unanalyzable, or on the grounds\nthat they misconstrue the nature of experience. And even if\nRussell’s original analysis is accepted, its neutral monistic\nreconstruction may be rejected, on the grounds that the assumed\nanalogy does not hold. So what we have here is no more than a\ntentative proposal how the traditional neutral monist, and the\ncontemporary panqualityist, might begin to think about the difficult\nproblem of accommodating experience in the neutral monist framework.\nTo the extent that his proposal succeeds, it does raise a question\nsuggested by Strawson’s argument above: is experience, thus\nunderstood in a neutral monist setting, a feature that is emergent in\nan objectionable way (see section\n 8.4\n below)?  \nThe neutral monism of Mach and James is committed to naively realistic\naccount of perceptual experience (see section\n 6.4\n above). Nonveridical experiences—illusions, hallucinations,\ndreams, etc.—are difficult to accommodate within naïve\nrealism. For the entities needed to constitute nonveridical\nexperiences—e.g., the pink rat that the drunkard\n“sees”—do not exist. \nBut traditional neutral monism provides an ontology rich enough to\naddress this problem. The pink shape experienced by the drunkard\nexists: it is a portion of pure experience (James), or an element\n(Mach). This much naïve realism is true, even in the cases of\nnonveridical experience. But the pink rat that the drunkard takes\nhimself to see does not exist—the pink patch he sees is not a\nmember of a group of neutral elements that constitute a rat. There is\nnothing wrong with the drunkard’s visual experience; what is\nmistaken is his assumption that what he sees is a rat. Russell (though\nnot a naïve realist himself) states this point most succinctly:\n“There are in fact no illusions of the senses, but only mistakes\nin interpreting sensational data as signs of things other than\nthemselves” (Russell 1948: 149–50). Mach puts the point as\nfollows:  \nWhen we consider elements like red, green, hot, cold and the rest,\nwhich are physical and mental in virtue of their dependence on both\nexternal and internal circumstances, and are in both respects\nimmediately given and identical, the question as to illusion and\nreality loses its sense. Here we are simultaneously confronted by the\nelements of the real world and of the ego. The only possible further\nquestion of interest concerns their functional\ninterdependence…. (Mach 1905: 7–8) \nTraditional neutral monism has been characterized as a form of\nreductionism or constructionism. The reductionist version of neutral\nmonism takes mental and physical phenomena to be identical with groups\nof neutral entities. Russell’s constructionist version of the\ndoctrine contents itself with the claim that there are logical\nconstructions of neutral entities that play the roles of physical and\nmental entities; whether there also are mental and physical entities,\nas originally conceived, is a question that the constructionist does\nnot address. Neutral monism differs from other versions of\nreductionism/constructionism by insisting on the neutrality of the\nbasis. And its reductive/constructionist spirit sets it apart from the\ncertain versions of nonreductive theories (about the mental) with\nwhich it is occasionally confused or identified. Panpsychism,\nphenomenalism, emergentism, and the dual aspect theory (sometimes\nunderstood as property dualism) are the leading candidates. And\nrecently a number of philosophers have argued that neutral\nmonism—in its traditional form as well as in its new Russellian\nmonist form—is best interpreted as a nonstandard version of\nphysicalism. \nPanpsychism holds that every basic entity—usually understood as\na physical entity—is also a mind. The physical nature (if\npresent) and the mental nature of the basic entities are fundamental,\ni.e., irreducible (to each other or to anything else). On the face of\nit, panpsychism and neutral monism are strikingly different. Neutral\nmonism reduces mental and physical phenomena, panpsychism does not;\nneutral monism holds that basic reality is neutral, panpsychism does\nnot. And neutral monism is compatible with the view that most physical\nobjects, and all their parts, are absolutely nonmental, whereas\npanpsychism is not. This is how things look on the Neither\nView of neutrality. On the Both View of neutrality,\nthings are less clear. The most natural reading of the Both\nView will, however, not yield panpsychism—the view that\nevery basic physical entity has a mind—but a dual aspect\nview—a view according to which every basic entity has a physical\nand and a mental aspect or side. This raises further questions about\nhow to distinguish panpsychist and dual aspect\ntheories—questions that are too specialized to be pursued\nhere. \nWhile the definition of neutral monism may distinguish it clearly from\npanpsychism, consideration of the extant versions of neutral monism\nhas tended to suggest a different picture. The allegedly neutral basic\nentities of traditional neutral monism strike many as manifestly\nmental (see section\n 7.2\n above). This is not the place to assess the accuracy of this\nimpression. But there can be little doubt that it is the source of the\nwide-spread suspicion that neutral monism is best understood as a\nversion of panpsychism or of phenomenalism. \nPhenomenalism has been defended as a doctrine about language, about\nfacts, and about things. Taken in this last sense, it attempts to\n“reduce material objects to sensa, that is, to explain them as\nconsisting solely of sensa or as being primarily groups or patterns of\nthem” (Hirst 2006: 271). We might substitute the terms\n“sense-data”, “sensations”,\n“percepts”, “experiences”, etc. for\nHirst’s term “sensa”. The worry is always the same:\nthe basic entities of neutral monism are not neutral but mental. Hence\nneutral monism is a form of purely mentalistic metaphysics. It is true\nthat traditional neutral monism is stated in terms of sensations\n(Mach), pure experience (James), and sensations and percepts\n(Russell). But, as used by the neutral monists, these terms are\nsupposedly purged of their usual mental dimension. In the neutral\nmonist framework, the predicates “mental” and\n“physical” apply solely to groups of neutral entities. To\ncall a particular element—a sensation, a percept, a bit of pure\nexperience—mental or physical is to speak elliptically: it is to\nsay that this neutral entity is a constituent of a group of elements\nthat, taken as a whole, is mental or physical. Moreover, neutral\nmonism is not limited to those entities that are sensations and\nperceptions—this is particularly clear in the case of Mach and\nRussell. The existence of vast majority of neutral entities is\ninferred from the minute set of elements that are sensations and\nperceptions. These inferred elements are outside of all minds (see\nespecially section\n 4.3.3\n above). These are the strong anti-phenomenalist claims that neutral\nmonism makes. How successfully the various neutral monists defend\nthese claims is, of course, a difficult further question. \nAs in the case of the panpsychism suspicion, the source of the worry\nthat neutral monism may collapse into phenomenalism is grounded, not\nin the definition of neutral monism, but in the actual versions of\nneutral monism that have been put forth. The worry is that the\nallegedly neutral entities are really mental, thereby turning neutral\nmonism into phenomenalism. \nThe theory of dual or double aspects is usually traced back to Spinoza\n(1677). The fundamental idea uniting the family of views that are\ngathered together under this label is that there is an underlying\nreality that we can grasp as mental or as physical, depending on the\npoint of view from which we apprehend it. The mental and the physical\nare aspects of this underlying reality which, in itself, is neither\nmental nor physical. Each one of us can know their own brain under\nboth of these aspects—via introspection and (scientific)\nobservation. But the claim of the theory is quite general: everything\nthere is is to be understood as consisting of an underlying reality\nthat has these two aspects. \nNeutral monism and the dual-aspect theory share a central claim: there\nis an underlying reality that is neither mental nor physical. But that\nis where the agreement stops. Neutral monism has no room for the\ncentral feature of the dual-aspect theory: the mental and physical\naspects, or sides, or properties that characterize the underlying\nentities of dual-aspect theory. The neutral monist accepts the\nmental/physical distinction. But it resides at the level or groups of\nneutral entities. Grouped one way, the neutral entities that\nconstitute your brain are thoughts and feelings; grouped another way,\nthey are atoms and neurons and lobes. Whether a given group of\ninterrelated neutral entities counts as mental or physical depends on\nthe functional role this group occupies (see section\n 3).\n On this picture, the mentality and physicality are features of\ncomplex structures of neutral entities. But the entities themselves\nare free of mental or physical aspects/sides/properties. Therein\nconsists their neutrality. \nBut if neutrality is understood according to the Both View,\nthe case for identifying neutral monism with the dual-aspect theory is\nstrengthened. Much will turn on how the details of the Both\nView are articulated. It must not, for example, be understood as\nproposing the identification of mental and physical properties. For\nthe dual-aspect theory insists that the two aspects are fundamental\nand irreducible to each other. Another question concerns the\nrelationship of the aspects and properties. If aspects are understood\nas properties, dual-aspect theory may simply collapse into property\ndualism (see, e.g., Van Gulick 2014). Dual-aspect theorists have\npushed back by insisting that aspects are not properties (see Skrbina\n2014: 228–29). But this may, in turn, block the project of\nreconciling the dual-aspect theory with neutral monism. For the\nneutrality, on the Both as well as on the Neither\nView, is understood in terms of mental and physical\nproperties. \nThere is a lively debate concerning the relationship between neutral\nmonism and dual-aspect theory (see, e.g., Velmans 2008; Skrbina 2014;\nsee also section\n 5.4).\n The decision about these two types of theory—whether they are\nincompatible rivals, whether they are distinct but compatible, or\nwhether they are identical—is still out. \nThe basic idea of emergence has to do with the fact that complex\nsystems may display interesting novel properties—properties not\npossessed by their parts. This idea has been regimented in various\nways. Following Chalmers, we can distinguish between weak and strong\nemergence. Weakly emergent phenomena are merely unexpected, given our\nknowledge of the domain from which they arise. Strongly emergent\nphenomena are not just unexpected; they cannot (not even in principle)\nbe deduced from the domain from which they arise (see Chalmers 2006:\n244). \nWeak emergence will, no doubt, be a wide-spread phenomenon in the\nneutral monist world. It poses no problem. But neutral monism,\nunderstood as a form of reductionism/constructionism appears to rule\nout strong emergence. Phenomena that cannot be deduced from the domain\nfrom which they arise cannot be reduced to it or constructed from it.\nThe existence of strongly emergent features would therefore falsify\nthe neutral monist thesis that everything is reducible\nto/constructible from the underlying neutral level of the neutral\nmonist ontology. \nThe contrary view is defended by Landini, who argues that (strong)\nemergence plays a crucial role in Russell’s neutral monism. If\nthe fundamental transient physical particulars (or events) have no\nphenomenal characters (or qualia), such qualities must be understood\nas strongly emergent features within the framework of Russell’s\nneutral monism.  \nQualia never occur in transient particulars. In Russell’s view,\nqualia emerge from the series of brain states…colors, pitches,\nsmells, tastes and textures are emergent properties of series of brain\nstates…. (Landini 2011: 302–305) \nBut Russell’s remarks about emergence (Russell 1927b:\n293–96) allow different reading. When called upon to present\nexamples of events, Russell gives the following list:  \nseeing a flash of lightning…hearing a tyre burst, or smelling a\nrotten egg, or feeling the coldness of a frog…particular colors\nand sounds and so on are events. (Russell 1927b: 287–88)  \nAll of these events are percepts—the only kinds of events we can\nknow without inference. And, pace Landini, all of these events do have\nqualitative characters. When Russell speaks of emergence, he has in\nmind the relationship between the abstract mathematical properties of\nevents and their intrinsic qualitative characters. And he maintains\nthat latter are emergent with respect to the former because there is\nno inferential path leading from the abstract mathematical features of\nan event to its intrinsic qualitative features. What this means is\nthat if one were to carry out the neutral monist program by focusing\nexclusively on the abstract mathematical characteristics of events,\nthen the existence qualitative characters of certain events would\nconstitute a (strongly) emergent fact. For such abstract and\nmathematical considerations  \ncannot conceivably…prove that there are visual events, or\nauditory events, or events of any of the kind that we know by\nperception. (Russell 1927b: 295)  \nBut this is not how the neutral monist (who follows Russell’s\nlead) starts out. Our percepts are our initial data, and they are\nqualitative through and through. The existence of quality is not\nsomething that we have to deduce from other known facts. On the\ncontrary, it is the initial datum. Such other events as we may believe\nin, whose intrinsic qualities we do not know, are all inferred from\nthis bedrock of qualitatively loaded percepts. It is therefore a\nmistake to try to explain the existence of qualitative characteristics\n(or qualia) as emerging from complex brain states. These\ncharacteristics are there, in the form of our percepts, at the very\nfoundation of Russell’s neutral monism. \nIn the past neutral monism has often been interpreted as a form of\nmentalism. A number of contemporary philosophers argue that it is best\nunderstood as a form of physicalism. \nDaniel Stoljar (2001), Derk Pereboom (2011, 2015), and Barbara Montero\n(2015) have interpreted Russellian monism (see section\n 5.5)\n as a form of physicalism. They argue that the categorical properties\nthat ground the dispositional properties that feature in physical\ntheory are themselves physical properties, albeit physical properties\nof a different kind. Once the realm of the physical is thus expanded,\nthe attempt to classify the categorical bases of the dispositional\nproperties of physics as neutral properties appears misguided. The\nproposal to construe the categorical bases as neutral results from an\nunduly narrow conception of the physical. \nThe recent literature also contains a number of attempts to interpret\ntraditional neutral monism as a form of physicalism. Banks (see\nsection\n 5.2)\n presents his neutral monism (realistic empiricism) as a direct\ndescendant of traditional neutral monism (Banks 2014, viii). But he\nalso holds that his neutral monism is “a kind of\nphysicalism” (Banks 2014: 7, 142). Like Russell, he embraces an\nontology of events. And he takes himself to follow Russell in\nconstruing these events as manifestations of underlying powers or\nenergies—such as electromagnetism, gravitation, and nuclear\nforces (Banks 149), as well as neural energies (Banks 2014: 142).\nThese considerations lead him to the following observation about the\nnature of Russell’s (and his own) event particulars:  \nRussellian neutral event particulars are so physicalistic in\nnature that there does not seem to be any reason to assume that these\nnatural qualities in physics have anything at all in common with our\nsensations, which are qualities of a very different order. A typical\nevent particular in Russell’s universe would be something\nperhaps like the emission of a quantum of radiation from an atom,\nhaving little or nothing to do with events in the human nervous system\nat a very different scale of complexity and size. (Banks 2014: 156)\n \nThere is much more to Banks’s complex view. But this suffices to\nconvey something of the physicalistic flavor of his interpretation of\ntraditional neutral monism. \nAfter a careful survey of the development of Russell’s neutral\nmonism, Donovan Wishon concludes that Russell’s final version of\nneutral monism (developed in the 1940s and after) “is\nvery plausibly interpreted as a version of ‘Russellian\nPhysicalism’” (Wishon 2015: 92). Among other things, he\ndraws our attention to Russell’s own claim that “I find\nmyself in ontology increasingly materialistic” (Russell 1946:\n700). And he points out that Russell argues that all events,\nincluding all our mental events, are subject to the laws of physics.\nHence “mental events will turn out to be a subclass of the\nphysical events that make up reality” (Wishon 2015: 112).\nAccording to Wishon, this shows that mental events are not\nontologically distinct from physical events. Only their special\nepistemic accessibility distinguishes them from the other physical\nevents (Wishon 2015: 112). In this way, Wishon suggests, Russell final\nversion of neutral monism effectively turns into a version of\nRussellian Physicalism. \nWe have noted (see section\n 1)\n how Landini’s interpretation of the notion of neutrality\n(according to (3)—the Possible Constituent View) allows\nhim to argue that neutral monism is compatible with physicalism. As he\nsees it, Russell is committed to such a version of physicalist neutral\nmonism. Accordingly, Russell is engaged in the project of\n“constructing both [minds and matter] out of orderings of\nphysical events that are their stages” (Landini 2011: 280).\nAfter a detailed discussion (Landini 2011: 291–297), Landini\nreaches the conclusion that the transient particulars (or events) from\nwhich Russell constructs mind and matter “are without intrinsic\nphenomenal character” (Landini 2011: 297). This makes it\npossible to regard them as physical entities in good standing. Their\nneutrality consists in the fact that they are the building blocks of\nboth mental and physical continuants (see Landini 2011: 292). \nThese attempts to combine neutral monism with physicalism, or to\nreinterpret neutral monism along physicalist lines pose a serious\nchallenge to neutral monism as usually understood. They deny the\ncentral claim that the fundamental building blocks of the world are\nneutral, i.e., nonphysical and nonmental. But no less noteworthy is\nthe degree to which these versions of physicalism depart from more\nstandard versions of physicalism. These nonstandard versions of\nphysicalism agree with neutral monism in holding that physics provides\nan incomplete picture of the world. The disagreement is limited to a\ndispute about the nature of the materials that are needed to fill out\nthe picture that physics provides. The neutral monist searches for\nsomething that is neither mental nor physical, in the traditional\nsenses of these terms. The physicalists whom we are currently\nconsidering hope to find the missing materials in something that is\nphysical, but not physical in the traditional sense of the term. This\ndoes suggest that the difference between neutral monism and this sort\nof physicalism may not be so deep after all (see Chalmers 2015 for\nmore on this question). \nThe traditional versions of neutral monism of Mach, James, and Russell\nreflect the empiricist outlook of their authors. This leads them to\nturn to experience, when searching for their neutral entities. And\nthis leads us to see their doctrines as tainted by mentalism. Perhaps\nthe traditional neutral monists were wrong to forge this tight link\nbetween the neutral entities and experience. Perhaps we are too quick\nin dismissing their efforts to discover a neutral base in this area.\nThe rising interest in the history of analytic philosophy, the gradual\nrediscovery of Russell as a metaphysician and epistemologist, and the\nexistence of new work such as Erik Banks’s new study of\ntraditional neutral monism (Banks 2014) hold out some hope for better\nunderstanding of traditional neutral monism. \nBut the fortunes of neutral monism are no longer exclusively tied to\nthe fate of traditional neutral monism. The neutral monist strand\nwithin the broader movement of Russellian monism (see section\n 5.5\n above) is a promising new development. Despite invoking\nRussell’s name, these versions of neutral monism explore fresh\nideas that hold out hope for a new life for neutral monism. And some\ncontemporary attempts to revive neutral monism are free of any ties to\nthe traditional versions of the doctrine. Thomas Nagel’s recent\ndefense of neutral monism comes to mind (see section\n 5.4).\n And the idea to make abstract entities—information, structure,\ncomputation, mathematical reality—into the neutral basis of a\nmetaphysical system is being actively developed by philosophers and\nscientists alike (see section\n 5.1). \nUntil quite recently it seemed that neutral monism (in its traditional\nform) was a brief and unimportant sideshow on the grand stage of\nmetaphysics. Notwithstanding the fact that the three main\nprotagonists—Mach, James, and Russell—were important\nfigures, whose ideas profoundly influenced many areas of contemporary\nthought, their speculations about neutral monism seemed to have\nvanished from the philosophical scene. But the current wave of\ninterest in the traditional versions of neutral monism, as well as the\nlively development of alternative versions of neutral monism, indicate\nthat neutral monism may, once more, become a live option in the\nongoing efforts to explore the metaphysics of mind.","contact.mail":"Leopold.Stubenberg.1@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
