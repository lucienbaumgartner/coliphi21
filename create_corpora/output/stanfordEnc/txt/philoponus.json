The epithet ‘Philoponus’\nmeans literally ‘Lover of toil’.  Philoponus’ life and\nwork are closely connected to the city of Alexandria and the\nAlexandrian Neoplatonic school. Although the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic\ntradition was the source of his intellectual roots and concerns, he\nwas an original thinker who eventually broke with that tradition in\nmany important respects, both substantive and methodological, and\ncleared part of the way which led to more critical and empirical\napproaches in the natural sciences. Which intellectual, religious, or\nother cultural circumstances of his life and times may have put\nPhiloponus into the position to initiate and foreshadow the eventual\ndemise of Aristotelianism is a most fascinating question. Scholarship has done much in recent years to arrive at a fuller appreciation of the work and accomplishment of this important late antique philosopher.\n\n\n\nPhiloponus’ oeuvre comprises at least 40 treatises on diverse\nsubjects such as grammar, logic, mathematics, physics, psychology,\ncosmology, astronomy, theology and church politics; even medical\ntreatises have been attributed to him. A substantial part of his work\nhas come down to us, but some parts of it are known only indirectly\nthrough quotations or translations into Syriac or Arabic. Although\nhis fame rests predominantly on the fact that, even within some of his\ncommentaries on works of Aristotle, he initiated and in fact\nanticipated the eventual liberation of natural philosophy from the\nstraitjacket of Aristotelianism, his non-polemical commentaries on\nAristotle as well as his theological treatises have recently become more widely studied, translated, and appreciated. \n Philoponus’ intellectual career began when he was a pupil of the\nNeoplatonic philosopher Ammonius, son of Hermias, who had been trained\nby Proclus at Athens and was head of the school at Alexandria. Some of\nPhiloponus’ commentaries profess to be based on Ammonius’ lectures, but\nothers give more room to Philoponus’ own ideas. Eventually, he\ntransformed the usual format of commentary sympathetic to Aristotle’s views into a discourse\nof open criticism. In the course of this critique, Philoponus examines and repudiates\nfundamental Aristotelian-Neoplatonic tenets, most prominently the\ndoctrine of the eternity of the world. His style of philosophical commentary, doggedly\ndisrespectful of authority, as well as the\nconclusions he drew, antagonized Philoponus’ pagan colleagues.\nTheir fierce enmity may have compelled him to abandon his philosophical\ncareer in the 530s; Philoponus never succeeded his teacher\nAmmonius as head of the school. Apparently he altogether abandoned his philosophical career. In the second half of his life he devoted his considerable energy\nto the theological debates of his time. Ironically, the\northodox church condemned him posthumously as a heretic (in 680–81)\nbecause of his tritheistic interpretation of the trinitarian dogma.\nUnderstanding the contested concepts within this debate (i.e. those of person, nature,\nsubstance, and hupostasis) in strictly Aristotelian senses, Philoponus was\nperceived to be enunciating not a single god in three persons (Father, Son,\nand Spirit), but actually three separate divinities. \n Reading Philoponus as well as the writings of his tireless adversary\nSimplicius, one gets the impression that, in the 6th century CE, traditional\npagan learning had become desperately insular. The intense\nincompatibilities between Greek philosophy and Christian dogma are\nreadily visible on every level of Philoponus’ work\nas he struggles to hold his faith accountable to reason. Although his\nmode of thinking betrays a strong Aristotelian influence, it also\ndisplays a certain doctrinal affinity to Plato stripped of the\naccretions of layers of Neoplatonic interpretation. The style of\nPhiloponus’ writing is often circuitous and rarely entertaining,\ndisplaying at times an almost pedantic rigor of argument and\nexposition. Yet he complements this kind of discourse with a remarkable freedom of\nspirit that allows him to cast off the fetters of authority\nas a criterion of truth, be it philosophical or\ntheological. Philoponus’ works were translated into Arabic, Latin\nand Syriac, and he influenced later thinkers such as Bonaventure,\nGersonides, Buridan, Oresme and Galileo. \n\nThe early extant work of “John the Grammarian,” on ambiguous words in Greek\ndistinguishable only by their accent, is philosophically\ninsignificant. So I leave these aside, and pass on to give an overview in this section of his extant\nphilosophical writings, first and foremost his commentaries on\nAristotle. In order to appreciate the magnitude of Philoponus’\nachievement as philosopher and scientist, one has to take into\naccount, at least partially, the intellectual culture in which he was\nbrought up. A common way that philosophers in late antiquity developed\nand propagated their own ideas was by composing commentaries on the\nclassical philosophical texts of Plato and Aristotle.  Generations of\nsuch commentaries were written from the time when Aristotle’s works\nbecame again accessible to a wider audience in the first century\nBCE down to the seventh century CE and beyond, forming a rich and largely coherent\ntradition. The majority of ancient commentaries still extant today\nwere written by Neoplatonists as textbooks for their philosophical\ncourses. Typically, these works have a number of features in common: \n After a basic education in “grammar” as well as studies in\nclassical Greek language and literature, John Philoponus, who was\nprobably born into a Christian family, embarked on this curriculum\n(ca. 510). As a pupil of Ammonius (ca. 440–520) he assumed\nresponsibility for writing down the lectures of the school’s by then\nailing head: Philoponus’ commentaries on Aristotle’s On Generation\nand Corruption, On the Soul, Prior Analytics\nand Posterior Analytics explicitly state in their titles that\nthey are based on Ammonius’ seminars (ek tôn\nsynousiôn Ammôníou). The commentaries on the\nCategories, Physics and Meteorology do not\nmake such claims, which suggests, in conjunction with other evidence,\nthat Philoponus was by that time teaching these courses on his own.  He presumably\ntook over as lecturer from Ammonius at some point, although he never\nheld the chair of philosophy but remained in the status of a\n‘grammatikós’, i.e. a professor of philology.\nAfter the death of Ammonius the school’s leadership seems to have\npassed into the hands of the mathematician Eutocius and then on to the\nphilosopher Olympiodorus (ca. 495–570), who remained a pagan and, remarkably, still\ntaught in then-Christian Alexandria unperturbed as late as 565. \n In many ways, Philoponus’ commentary on the Categories\nmay be regarded as typical of its kind. The exegesis of\nAristotle’s text is prefaced by a general clarification of\nmatters of interest for the student who reads philosophy for the first\ntime. (Similar preliminaries can also be found as prefaces to\ncommentaries on Porphyry’s Introduction.) Aristotle’s\nlogical works were arranged in an order of increasing complexity,\nbeginning with the Categories, which deals with simple,\nuncombined utterances. This was followed by De\ninterpretatione (on propositions), Prior Analytics (on\nsyllogism) and Posterior Analytics (on proof). Discussing the\nproblem of the subject matter (skopós) of the\nCategories, Philoponus says – roughly in agreement with\nIamblichus – that the Categories are about simple utterances\n(phônaí) signifying simple things\n(prágmata) by means of simple concepts\n(noêmata; In Cat. 10). \n Most Neoplatonists followed Alexander of Aphrodisias in regarding\nlogic not as a separate philosophical discipline (that was the Stoic view) but\nrather as philosophy’s tool, its organon. In their\ncommentaries on the Prior Analytics, both Philoponus and\nAmmonius side with that tradition and reject the Stoic view, but they\nadd that in the case of Plato, dialectic may well be regarded as part\nof Platonic philosophy (witness dialogues such as Phaedrus\nand Phaedo) but also as an exercise in its own right serving\nas philosophical tool (witness the Parmenides;\ncf. Philoponus, In An.Pr. 6–9). The contemporary Athenian\nNeoplatonist Simplicius, who spent much acumen on repudiating and\nexcoriating Philoponian cosmological ideas, denied altogether Philoponus’\ncompetence as a logician, and modern scholars tend to agree with\nhim. Historians of logic, however, acknowledge that Philoponus was the\nfirst to render a satisfactory account of the syllogism (subsequently\nthe traditional one), stating that the major premise includes the\npredicate term of the conclusion, the minor premise the subject term\n(In An.Pr. 67). In Philoponus, too, one encounters for the\nfirst time a particular diagram that schematised what kind of\nconclusions (i.e. universal affirmative, universal negative,\nparticular affirmative, or particular negative) follow from what kind\nof premises. This diagram, later to be called by the schoolmen\n‘asses’ bridge’ (pons asinorum), enabled students\nof logic more easily to construct valid syllogisms (In\nAn.Pr. 274). \n\nThe commentary on Aristotle’s On the Soul is apparently the\nearliest to contain passages in which Philoponus  at times abandons\nconventional exegesis in order to criticize an Aristotelian doctrine, a\ntendency which becomes more and more conspicuous in the Physics\ncommentary, dated to 517.  Scholars now believe that at least some of\nthese deviations from commentary proper derive from later revisions\nof earlier expositions in the classroom.  One can distinguish between two kinds of\ncriticism: substantive modification of Aristotelian ideas on the one\nhand, and outright rejection on the other. Philoponus’ commentary\nOn the Soul presents a good example of the former kind of\ncriticism. In On the Soul II 7 Aristotle takes light to be\nincorporeal, and he describes its appearance as an instantaneous\ntransition from the potentiality (dúnamis) of a medium\nto be transparent to the actuality\n(enérgeia) of transparency. At pp. 330ff of\nhis commentary, Philoponus offers a constructive kind of criticism\nthat seems to have had momentous consequences for his eventual\nconceptualization of the theory of the impetus (see below). Philoponus\ncontends that Aristotle’s view fails to account both for the laws\nof optics and for the plain phenomenon that the region below the moon\nis warmed by the light of the sun, a celestial body. In an\nAristotelian spirit of modifying the theory so as to save the\nphenomena, he proceeds to re-interpret the term\nenérgeia not as a state of actuality, but rather as an\n‘incorporeal activity’ which, besides constituting the\ntransparency of the medium, is also capable of warming bodies. Philoponus argues that in the same way soul, as an incorporeal activity in the\nbody, causes the animal to be warm. Due to this novel interpretation\nof Aristotle’s terminology, light is now understood not\nstatically but as something dynamic. And it is possible to trace\nPhiloponus’ further development of the idea. In the\nMeteorology commentary, which belongs to a stage when\nPhiloponus had already abandoned the Aristotelian assumption of an immutable\ncelestial fifth element (ether), he argues that light and heat may be explained best as consequences of the nature of the sun, which is\nfire (In Meteor. 49). Heat, so he explains, is generated when the rays\nemanating from the sun are refracted and warm the air through\nfriction. \n\nThe Physics commentary contains an array of examples of\ninnovative and damagingly critical commentary. One of the most\ncelebrated achievements is the theory of impetus, which is commonly\nregarded as a decisive step away from an Aristotelian dynamics towards\na modern theory based on the notion of inertia. Concepts akin to those\ndeployed in Philoponus’ impetus theory appear in earlier writers\nsuch as Hipparchus (2nd c. BCE) and Synesius (4th c. CE), but\nPhiloponus nowhere intimates that he was influenced by any one of\nthem. As far as one can tell from the text In Phys. 639–42,\nhe takes his point of departure from an unsatisfactory Aristotelian\nanswer to a problem that was to puzzle scientists for centuries: Why\ndoes an arrow continue to fly after it has left the bow-string, or a\nstone after it has ceased to be in contact with the hand that throws\nit? Since Aristotle supposed that a) whenever there is motion there\nmust be something which imparts the motion, and b) mover and moved\nmust be in contact, he was led to conclude that the air displaced in\nfront of the projectile somehow rushes round it and pushes from\nbehind, thus propelling the projectile along. To be sure, the rapid motion of an object through a medium creates turbulence, but this turbulence does not sustain any movement but contributes to its deceleration. Aristotle’s theory was still in\nvogue among Peripatetic scholars of the sixteenth century, despite the fact\nthat a thousand years earlier Philoponus had thoroughly dismantled it. He\nproposed instead, much more plausibly but still erroneously, that a\nprojectile moves on account of a kinetic force which is impressed on\nit by the mover and which exhausts itself in the course of the\nmovement.  Philoponus compares this impetus or ‘incorporeal\nmotive enérgeia’, as he calls it, to the activity earlier attributed to light. \n Once projectile motion was understood in terms of an impetus in this\nway, it became possible for Philoponus to reassess the rôle of\nthe medium: far from being responsible for the continuation of a\nprojectile’s motion it is in fact an impediment to it (In\nPhys. 681). On this basis Philoponus concludes, against\nAristotle, that there is in fact nothing to prevent one from imagining\nmotion taking place through a void. As regards the natural motion of\nbodies falling through a medium, it was Aristotle’s contention that the\nspeed is proportional to the weight of the moving bodies and\nindirectly proportional to the density of the medium. Philoponus repudiates this view by appeal to the same kind of experiment that Galileo\nwas to carry out centuries later (In Phys. 682–84). \n\nPhiloponus’ impetus theory ties in with other far-reaching\ncriticisms of Aristotelian principles of physics. Aristotle had\ndismissed the notion of a void as a logical\nimpossibility. Philoponus concedes that in nature empty spaces never\nbecome actual, but he insists that a clear conception of the void is\nnot only coherent but also necessary if one wants to explain movement\nin a plenum. When bodies move and in consequence exchange places, this\npresupposes that somehow there is empty space available to be filled\nby them (In Phys. 693f.). Again, there are certain phenomena\nwhich clearly exhibit the force of the vacuum, for example handling a\npipette (clepsudra), which allows one to raise small\nquantities of fluids, or the fact that one can suck up water through a\npipe (In Phys. 571f). Philoponus’ elaborate defense of\nthe void (In Phys. 675–94) is closely related to his\nconceptions of place and space (In Phys. 557–85). Aristotle\ndefined the place of a body as the inner surface of the body or all\nthe bodies taken together that contain it (Phys. IV 4);\nPhiloponus replies that place ought instead to be conceived as the\nthree-dimensional extension identical to the determinate size of the given\nbody, i.e. its volume. This was also the theory of the Stoic\nChrysippus, but there is no indication in the extant text of\nPhiloponus (as there are in his later works) that he saw himself\ninfluenced here by the Stoics. \n\nLike place, space as a whole is the indeterminate three-dimensional extension everywhere devoid\nof body, though it is not actually infinite – so much Philoponus\nconcedes to Aristotle. Philoponus’ discussion of matter builds\nupon this conception of space. In the Physics commentary\n(687f.) he argues in a similar vein to Aristotle in\nMetaphysics VII 3: In abstracting all qualities and other\ndeterminations from body Aristotle arrived at a conception of\ncharacterless, undetermined matter, an idea of matter like the “prime matter” that\nthe Neoplatonists later defined as formless and incorporeal (because\nit was no actual body, but only the necessary underlying condition\nfor bodies).  Philoponus, in contrast, arrives at something\nhe calls corporeal extension (sômatikón\ndiástêma), which is a composite of Stoic-Neoplatonic prime\nmatter and indeterminate quantity and must not be confused with\nPhiloponian space. His argument here may still be regarded as an\nelaboration on or correction of Aristotle. However, in Book XI of the\npolemical treatise against Proclus (see below, 3.1) he jettisons the\nNeoplatonic conception of prime matter and posits as the\nmost fundamental level of his ontology ‘the\nthree-dimensional’, as he calls it, i.e. indeterminately extended\nmass. In this he claims to be following the Stoics (Aet.\n414), and it has been pointed out that this ontological level is\nreminiscent to us of the Cartesian res extensa, although\nDescartes would not allow Philoponus’ distinction between space\nand corporeal extension.  In order to rebuff the likely objection that\n’the three-dimensional’ cannot be the most fundamental level of being\nbecause extension, belonging to the Aristotelian category of quantity,\nis an accident and requires the assumption of a distinct underlying\nsubject, Philoponus argues that extension is in fact not an accident,\nbut an essential and inseparable differentia of ‘the\nthree-dimensional’, just like heat in fire or whiteness in\nsnow. Thus quantity (corporeal extension) is constitutive of body as\nsuch. This amounts to a promotion of one sort of quantity to the\ncategory of substance.  There are indications that Philoponus would\naccordingly have modified Aristotle’s scheme of the\nCategories if he had revised his early commentary on that\ntreatise. \n The incomplete commentary on the Meteorology may well be the\nlast commentary Philoponus wrote on Aristotle. It is instructive to\nnotice how the lectures are presented here with an air of aloofness and, at\ntimes, deliberate vagueness.  In several places, especially when he\nhas to comment on the nature and movement of the heavens, Philoponus\nbreaks off and refers the student to previously published work: what\nPhiloponus really has to say about the text seems no longer\nappropriate for the traditionally conceived class-room. He has shaken\noff the weight of Aristotle’s or anyone else’s authority,\nand far from attempting to demonstrate the harmony among philosophers\nhe puts himself forward as a philosopher who dissents from the\nrecognized philosophical authority. The commentator has turned into a\ncritic with independent philosophical ideas of his own. \n\nThe Athenian Neoplatonist Proclus (ca. 411–485), the teacher of\nPhiloponus’ own teacher Ammonius, had written a defense of the widespread conviction among\nGreek philosophers that the\nworld is eternal. His aim was to demonstrate the untenability of Christian creationism.  Proclus’ eighteen arguments took their\npoint of departure from the myth of Plato’s Timaeus, which,\naccording to Proclus, was best and most consistently interpreted\naccording to an eternalist reading: the surface talk of a world being\nconstructed by a divine ‘demiurge’ is part of the mythical and didactic framework, not an actual philosophical claim. \n In 529, the year when emperor Justinian put an end to pagan\nphilosophical teaching in Athens, Philoponus published a detailed reply\nentitled On the Eternity of the World against Proclus. The\nbook amounts to an anti-commentary on the Proclean arguments: combing\nthrough Proclus’ text, Philoponus literally repudiates every single\npoint made. Although his efforts are evidently to some extent\nmotivated by his Christian faith, he keeps biblical theology out of\nhis polemic, attempting to refute Proclus within the framework of\nPlatonist philosophy. He reads the Timaeus as a genuine\naccount of creation (Book VI), compatible with Christian doctrine. A\nnew and ingenious analysis of the processes of generation and corruption renders\neven an idea viable which Greek philosophers of all schools roundly rejected: creation out of nothing (Books VIII and IX). And even if it\nis true, Philoponus retorts, that creation out of nothing never occurs in nature, God is\nsurely more powerful a creator than nature and therefore quite possibly capable of\ncreatio ex nihilo (IX 9). \n\nPhiloponus’ battle against eternalism may be divided into three\nstages. The treatise Against Proclus is followed by a second\nand even more provocative publication, On the Eternity of the\nWorld against Aristotle. This work was published c. 530–534 and\ninvolved a close scrutiny of the first chapters of Aristotle’s\nOn the Heavens (his theory of ether as the fifth element, of\nwhich the heavenly bodies are made) and the eighth book of the\nPhysics (arguing for the eternity of time and motion). The\nthird stage is represented by one, perhaps two, non-polemical\ntreatises that have survived in fragments which indicate that numerous\narguments against eternity and for creation were arranged in some kind\nof systematic order. \n Like the polemic against Proclus, Against Aristotle is\nmainly devoted to removing obstacles for the creationist. If Aristotle\nwere right about the existence of an immutable fifth element (ether)\nin the celestial region, and if he were right about motion and time\nbeing eternal, any belief in creation would surely be\nunwarranted. Philoponus succeeds in pointing to numerous\ncontradictions, inconsistencies, fallacies and improbable assumptions\nin Aristotle’s philosophy of nature relating to these\nclaims. Dissecting Aristotle’s texts in an unprecedented way, he\ntime and again turns the tables on Aristotle and so paves the way for\ndemonstrative arguments for non-eternity. One such argument is\nreported by Simplicius (In Phys. 1178,7–1179,26 = Contra\nAristotelem, Fr. 132). It relies on three premises: (1) If the\nexistence of something requires the preexistence of something else,\nthen any one thing will not come to be without the prior existence\nof the other. (2) An infinite number cannot exist in actuality, nor\nbe traversed in counting, nor be increased.  (3) Something cannot come\ninto being if its existence requires the preexistence of an infinite\nnumber of other things, one arising out of the other. From these not\nat all un-Aristotelian premises Philoponus deduces that the conception\nof a temporally infinite universe, understood as a successive causal\nchain, is impossible. The celestial spheres of Aristotelian theory\nhave different periods of revolution, and in any given number of years\nthey undergo different numbers of revolutions, some larger than\nothers. The assumption of their motion having gone on for all eternity\nleads to the conclusion that infinity can be increased, even\nmultiplied, which Aristotle himself held to be absurd. \n The non-polemical anti-eternalist treatises exploit, among others,\nAristotle’s argument that an infinite power\n(dúnamis) cannot reside in a finite body\n(Phys. VIII 10). Philoponus infers that since the universe is\na finite body, it cannot have the dúnamis to exist for\nan infinite time. As in the case of his theory of light, this argument\ninvolves a not at all un-Aristotelian shift of meaning of the argument’s central concept. There, enérgeia shifted from ‘actuality’ to ‘activity’; in the context of Aristotle’s argument in\nPhys. VIII 10, dúnamis meant ‘power or kinetic\nforce’, but Philoponus employs the word in the sense of\n‘capacity’ or ‘fitness to exist’. \n\n By the end of the 530s, as noted above (2.1), Philoponus seems to have stopped fighting\nphilosophical battles altogether; his career as a philosopher was\nover. Thenceforward he devoted himself solely to writing on Christian theological\ntopics. Since there is no evidence that he belonged to the clerical\norder, it is difficult to imagine the institutional context of his life as a\nChristian theologian. He published his theological treatises under the same name\nby which he had established himself as a commentator, Iôánnês ho\nGrammatikós, yet it seems hard to imagine him still working as a professor of grammar or literature in the Alexandrian system of higher education. His other epithet, ‘philóponos’ (lover of toil) is probably\nbest interpreted as an acknowledgment of his literary productivity,\nalthough it may also be an indication that he was one of a group of zealous Christian\nbrethren in Egypt who called themselves by that name. \n\nPerhaps some fifteen years after his attack on\nAristotle on the eternity of the world (the date is disputed), Philoponus published a\ncommentary on the biblical creation story, On the Creation of the\nWorld (De opificio mundi), which is his only theological\nwork extant in Greek.  While discussing the biblical text, Philoponus\nfrequently refers to philosophers like Aristotle, Plato and Ptolemy as\nwell as to Basil the Great, whose own treatise on the creation\nserved him as inspiration. The De opificio mundi has received\nsome attention from historians of science, because Philoponus suggests\nat one point (I 12) that the movement of the heavens could be\nexplained by a ‘motive force’ impressed on the celestial\nbodies by God at the time of creation. As we have seen (2.2 above),\nPhiloponus discussed impetus theory for the first time in the context\nof trying to understand the physics of forced motion (Why does an arrow or stone continue to move after losing contact with its motive cause?). Now he\napplies the same theory to the regular and natural motions of the universe at large. Significantly, Philoponus assimilates the supposed rotational impetus implanted by God into\nthe celestial bodies to the rectilinear movements of the elements as\nwell as to the self-movements of animals. The interesting upshot is that all these different types of natural and non-natural motions are understood in essentially the same way as impetus- induced movements. In virtue of this bold suggestion Philoponus is often\ncredited with having envisaged, for the first time, a unified theory\nof dynamics, since he strove to give the same kind of explanation for\nphenomena that Aristotle and others had to explain by appeals to different kinetic principles such as nature, coercion, or soul, depending upon context. \n\nJudging from the fragmentary evidence, Philoponus’ later\ntheological treatises were characterized by a curious mixture of\nChristian doctrine and Aristotelian philosophy. On the eve of the\nfifth Council (Constantinople, 553) Philoponus stepped forward as a\npartisan of monophysite Christology which, in the course of the\ncentury, had become increasingly influential in the eastern part of\nthe Roman empire. For the monophysites it was important to emphasize the\ndivinity of Christ; they were alarmed by the bewildering conjunction of\nChristological dogmas formulated at the Council of Chalcedon in\n451. There Christ was confessed to be (1) consubstantial\n(homooúsios) with the Father, (2) consubstantial with\nus humans, (3) one person and one hypóstasis (an\nimportant term widespread in Neoplatonism and roughly meaning\n‘substantive existence’), but (4) discernible in two natures\n(en dúo phúsesin \ngnôrizómenon), a phrase which was directly\ninfluenced by the ‘unitatem personae in utraque natura\nintelligendam’ (‘a unity of person knowable in both\nnatures’) endorsed by the Bishop of Rome and familiar to\ntheologians of the Latin West. Although propositions 1, 2 and 3 were\nno longer controversial, proposition 4 could be read as an unholy\nconcession to those who regarded Jesus as a human being merely\ndistinguished by some kind of divine presence or inspiration (the view\nof the so-called ‘dyophysites’). \n In Arbiter (Arbitrator or Umpire), written about\nthe same time as the Council of Constantinople and surviving only in Syriac translation, Philoponus takes\nthe view that the locution ‘discernible in two natures’\nought to be abandoned. His main strategy is to argue that in this\ncontext the meaning of the terms ‘nature’ and\n‘hypóstasis’ are essentially identical, so that\nif Christ is (according to (3)) one hypóstasis he\ncannot also (as in (4)) be discernible in two natures. The\nargument goes roughly as follows: The term ‘nature’ has two\napplications, one general and one particular: we can speak of the\nnature of man in general or of the particular nature of this\nindividual man. Now, when one speaks of the unification (and\ndiscernibility) of two natures in Christ, this cannot be meant to say\nthat the universal natures of godhead and manhood have been unified in\nChrist (else it would be also true to say that not only the Logos, but\nalso the Father and the Spirit have become man, since the universal\nnature of godhead applies to them as much as it does to the\nLogos). Instead, the reference must be to the particular nature of the\ndivine Logos and the particular nature of Jesus the man: it must be\nwith reference to these particular natures that godhead and manhood\nare combined in Christ. But this too cannot be right, Philoponus\nclaims, since ‘particular nature’ means the same as\n‘hypóstasis’, which he uses as a synonym also of\n‘person’ and ‘individual being’. Since it is\nagreed that Christ is one person and one hypóstasis,\nhe must consequently also be of one ‘particular’ nature\nonly, not two. Philoponus concedes, of course, that the nature of\nChrist is not an ordinary one; it is complex, combining and preserving\nthe properties of both what it is to be a god and what it is to be a\nman. Far from being able to discern two different natures in Christ,\nwe should speak of one complex or combined nature (mía phúsis\nsúnthetos). \n\nBesides monophysitism, Philoponus’ name is associated with the\ndoctrine of tritheism. However, one needs to be aware of an important\ndifference: Whereas monophysitism was a reputable and powerful\ntheological movement in the Eastern church, tritheism was little more\nthan a hostile label given to certain intellectuals who tried to make\nthe mystery of the Trinity intelligible in philosophical\nlanguage. Philoponus was one such intellectual who, again, resorted to\nAristotelian terminology to clarify and settle the trinitarian\ndispute. Already in the Arbiter it was clear that Philoponus\ntended to understand the crucial term\n‘hypóstasis’ as meaning something like\n‘primary substance’ in the sense of Aristotle’s\nCategories, i.e. an individual organic being. The fragments\nof the very late treatise On the Trinity confirm this. Since\nhypóstasis is certainly not an accident of divinity,\nPhiloponus argues, it must be the case that the three\nhypostáseis of the Trinity are three particular divine\nsubstances with distinct properties. Only on this assumption, too, is\nit reasonable to speak of the consubstantiality of the three Persons,\nfor if there were only one divine substance, what sense would it make\nto speak of consubstantiality at all? When Basil and Gregory of Nyssa\nspoke of the Trinity as ‘one ousía, three\nhypostáseis,’ they were not, Philoponus\ncontinues, enunciating four primary substances, but used\n‘substance’ (ousía) in the secondary,\nabstract sense of essence or universal nature. In accordance with\nAristotle, Philoponus claims that universals exist only in the\nmind. Thus, the claim that there is only one God appears to be true of\nthe unity constituted by the concept of divinity. In actual\nfact, there are three separate divinities, Father, Son, and Spirit. In\norder to fend off any reminiscences of pagan polytheism, Philoponus\npoints out that unlike the individually differentiated gods of the\npagans the three divinities of the Trinity are all of the same, single\ndivine nature in the universal sense of ‘nature’.  It is important to keep in mind that so-called ‘tritheists’ like Philoponus would not have conceded that they thereby abandoned monotheism. Although\nPhiloponus had his followers, trinitarian philosophy of this kind\ncould hardly be palatable to anyone not committed before all else to\nAristotle’s ontology. The so-called tritheists faced immediate and\nsevere criticism, and Philoponus himself was condemned by the Council\nof Constantinople of 680–81. Only recently, his views seem to have received increased attention and appreciation among philosophically-minded historians of the Church (see Erismann (2008) and Zachhuber (2018)).\n\n \n Philoponus is often celebrated for having been one of the very\nfirst thinkers to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with\nChristianity. To some extent, this is true, but crucially, his\ncontemporaries must have taken a different view. Pagan philosophers\nabhorred the way in which Philoponus used Christianity as a vantage\npoint from which, in their opinion, he recklessly disturbed the\nharmony of the Greek philosophers, and Christian theologians could not\nbut castigate his attempt to comprehend in Aristotelian terms what was\nfor them, essentially, a profound spiritual mystery demanding belief just because it was philosophically unacceptable. \n\nDespite arousing the disapproval of many of his contemporaries, both\npagan and Christian, Philoponus’ immediate influence may have been\nconsiderable among fellow-monophysites in Egypt. The anathema of 681,\nhowever, made the further proliferation of his theological ideas\nimpossible. Likewise, his arch-enemy Simplicius, also a pupil of\nAmmonius, submitted the Grammarian’s anti-eternalism almost\nimmediately to thundering pro-Aristotelian criticism (in his\ncommentaries on the De Caelo and the Physics,\nwritten sometime in the late 530s). It was that polemic which\nresounded through the ages; its shockwaves can still be felt in later\nthinkers like Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274) and Zabarella (1533–1589) who\ncarefully examined, though in the end rejected, Philoponus’\nanti-eternalist arguments.  Philoponus’ work was studied extensively\nby the Arabs, who referred to him as Yahyâ an-Nahwî or\nYahyâ al-‘Asqalânî. Al-Kindi (ca. 800–870)\nin particular is heavily indebted to Philoponus for his own attack on\neternalism. Later on in the West, the arguments against the eternity\nof the world also persuaded Bonaventure (1217–1274) and Gersonides\n(1288–1344), and impetus theory was reaffirmed by Buridan (1300–1361)\nand his pupil Oresme (1325–1382).  In the sixteenth century, the first\neditions and numerous translations (into Latin) of Philoponus’\ncommentaries and the treatise Against Proclus began to appear\nin print. Eventually, Philoponus’ criticism of Aristotelian dynamics\nin the Physics commentary was widely discussed and persuaded\nsuch diverse thinkers as Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola\n(1469–1533) and, for different reasons, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642). In a sense, Philoponus is a Renaissance figure avant la lettre. However, historically positioned at a half way point between the Classical period and the Renaissance, he symbolizes more than anything else the Western mind’s excruciatingly slow struggle for emancipation from Aristotelianism on the one hand and blind faith in Church dogma on the other.  \n\nThe greatest challenge for a student of this period of the history of\nphilosophy is to understand how a phenomenon such as Philoponus could\nhave occurred at all. To be sure, elusive individual qualities of his mind\nand personality must have played an essential rôle, but it is\nequally true that philosophical, social, and religious parameters are\nlikely to have supplied conditions which allowed him to carry forward\nhis unprecedented and unparalleled challenge to a widely\naccepted intellectual tradition.  In the past, scholars have\nreadily pointed towards the presumed fact that Philoponus was first\nraised as a Christian who later came into privileged contact with\nGreek rationalism; it is supposed that this constellation catalyzed\nhis stance of critical opposition and rejection. However, this\nexplanation is far from satisfactory. Many Christians from birth both\nbefore and after Philoponus were similarly exposed to pagan philosophy\nwithout reacting in a comparable way.  Other scholars have suggested\nthat Philoponus may have received orders from clerical superiors to\nwrite a refutation of Aristotelianism. Again others, especially with a\nview to the invention of the theory of impetus, have sought the roots\nof Philoponus’ intellectual emancipation in broad socio-economic\nchanges which occurred in late antiquity, in particular the\nemancipation of slaves. In whichever way the epithet ‘Philoponus’ is eventually going to be\nexplained, it seems certain that what essentially enabled Philoponus\nto operate both as a critic of Aristotelianism and as a constructive\nthinker in his own right was somehow tied up with a new understanding of\nwhat one ought to do when one is reading and interpreting the\nphilosophical texts of Plato or Aristotle. Whereas Neoplatonists,\nespecially since Proclus (412–485), tended to approach these ancient\ntexts as a fabric of venerable signs pointing per se and in\nan infallible way to a higher reality and to the truth, Philoponus\nread them (as we do today) as indicators of the thoughts and\nintentions of fallible authors. His more measured hermeneutic\napproach allowed Philoponus to point out problematic tensions, inconsistencies, and\nglaring contradictions in the Aristotelian corpus, and to highlight\ninstances of substantive disagreement between Plato and Aristotle. In\ncontrast, the program of the Neoplatonic tradition he grew up in had been, largely,\neither to ignore such hermeneutical problems or explain them away in an effort to harmonize the rich and diverse tradition of pagan Greek philosophy.","contact.mail":"wildberg@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"}]
