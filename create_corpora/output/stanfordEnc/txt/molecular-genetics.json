This article briefly summarizes the\nbasic knowledge of molecular genetics and surveys philosophical\nresearch on the subject. The survey is organized around three\nquestions that have dominated philosophical attention: (a) Can\nclassical genetics be reduced to molecular genetics? (b) What is a\ngene? and (c) What do genes do? It concludes by turning attention to a\nfourth question: (d) Why is so much biological research centered on\ngenes and DNA?\n\n\n\nThe term molecular genetics is now redundant because\ncontemporary genetics is thoroughly molecular. Genetics is not made up\nof two sciences, one molecular and one non-molecular. Nevertheless,\npracticing biologists still use the term. When they do, they are\ntypically referring to a set of laboratory techniques aimed at\nidentifying and/or manipulating DNA segments involved in the synthesis\nof important biological molecules. Scientists often talk and write\nabout the application of these techniques across a broad swath of\nbiomedical sciences. For them, molecular genetics is an\ninvestigative approach that involves the application of\nlaboratory methods and research strategies. This approach presupposes\nbasic knowledge about the expression and regulation of genes at the\nmolecular level. \n\nPhilosophical interest in molecular genetics, however, has centered, not on\ninvestigative approaches or laboratory methods, but on theory. Early\nphilosophical research concerned the basic theory about the\nmake-up, expression, and regulation of genes. Most attention\ncentered on the issue of theoretical reductionism. The motivating\nquestion concerned whether classical genetics, the science of T. H.\nMorgan and his collaborators, was being reduced to molecular genetics.\nWith the rise of developmental genetics and developmental biology,\nphilosophical attention has subsequently shifted towards critiquing a\nfundamental theory associated with contemporary genetics. The\nfundamental theory concerns not just the make-up,\nexpression, and regulation of genes, but also the overall role of genes\nwithin the organism. According to the fundamental theory, genes and\nDNA direct all life processes by providing the information that\nspecifies the development and functioning of organisms. \n\nThis article begins by providing a quick review of the basic theory\nassociated with molecular genetics. Since this theory incorporates\nideas from the Morgan school of classical genetics, it is useful to\nsketch its development from Morgan's\ngenetics. After reviewing the basic theory, I examine four questions\ndriving philosophical investigations of molecular genetics. The first\nquestion asks whether classical genetics has been or will be reduced to\nmolecular genetics. The second question concerns the gene concept and\nwhether it has outlived its usefulness. The third question regards the\ntenability of the fundamental theory. The fourth question, which\nhasn't yet attracted much philosophical attention,\nasks why so much biological research is centered on genes and\nDNA.  \n\nThe basic theory associated with classical genetics provided\nexplanations of the transmission of traits from parents to offspring.\nMorgan and his collaborators drew upon a conceptual division between\nthe genetic makeup of an organism, termed its genotype, and\nits observed manifestation called its phenotype (see the\nentry on \n the genotype/phenotype distinction).\nThe relation between the two was treated as causal: genotype in\nconjunction with environment produces phenotype. The theory explained\nthe transmission of phenotypic differences from parents to offspring by\nfollowing the transmission of gene differences from generation to\ngeneration and attributing the presence of alternative traits to the\npresence of alternative forms of genes. \n\nI will illustrate the classical mode of explanatory reasoning with a\nsimple historical example involving the fruit fly Drosophila\nmelanogastor. It is worth emphasizing that the mode of reasoning\nillustrated by this historical example is still an important mode of\nreasoning in genetics today, including what is sometimes called\nmolecular genetics. \n\nGenes of Drosophila come in pairs, located in corresponding\npositions on the four pairs of chromosomes contained within each cell\nof the fly. The eye-color mutant known as purple is associated\nwith a gene located on chromosome II. Two copies of this gene,\nexisting either in mutated or normal wild-type form, are located at the\nsame locus (corresponding position) in the two\nsecond-chromosomes. Alternative forms of a gene occurring at a\nlocus are called alleles. The transmission of genes from\nparent to offspring is carried out in a special process of cellular\ndivision called meiosis, which produces gamete cells\ncontaining one chromosome from each paired set. The half set of\nchromosomes from an egg and the half set from a sperm combine during\nfertilization, which gives each offspring a copy of one gene from each\ngene pair of its female parent and a copy of one gene from each gene\npair of its male parent.  \n\nExplanations of the transmission of traits relate the presence of\nalternative genes (genotype) to the presence of alternative observable\ntraits (phenotype). Sometimes this is done in terms of\ndominant/recessive relations. Purple eye-color, for example, is\nrecessive to the wild-type character (red eye-color). This means\nthat flies with two copies of the purple allele (the mutant form of the\ngene, which is designated pr) have purple eyes, but\nheterozygotes, flies with one copy of the purple allele and\none copy of the wild-type allele (designated +), have normal wild-type\neyes (as do flies with two copies of the wild-type allele). See Table\n1. \n\nTo see how the classical theory explains trait transmission,\nconsider a cross of red-eyed females with purple-eyed males that was\ncarried out by Morgan's collaborators. The offspring\nall had red eyes. So the trait of red eyes was passed from the females\nto all their offspring even though the offspring's\nmale parents had purple eyes. The classical explanation of this\ninheritance pattern proceeds, as do all classical explanations of\ninheritance patterns, in two stages. \n\nThe first stage accounts for the transmission of genes and goes as\nfollows (Figure 1): each offspring received one copy of chromosome II\nfrom each parent. The maternally derived chromosomes must have\ncontained the wild-type allele (since both second-chromosomes of every\nfemale parent used in the experiment contained the wild-type allele --\nthis was known on the basis of previous experiments). The paternally\nderived chromosomes must have contained the purple allele (since both\nsecond-chromosomes of every male parent contained the purple allele --\nthis was inferred from the knowledge that purple is recessive to red\neye-color). Hence, all offspring were heterozygous (pr /\n+). Having explained the genetic makeup of the progeny by\ntracing the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, we can\nproceed to the second stage of the explanation: drawing an inference\nabout phenotypic appearances. Since all offspring were heterozygous\n(pr / +), and since purple is recessive to wild-type,\nall offspring had red eye-color (the wild-type character). See Figure\n1. \n\nNotice that the reasoning here does not depend on identifying the\nmaterial make-up, mode of action, or general function of the underlying\ngene. It depends only on the ideas that copies of the gene are\ndistributed from generation to generation and that the difference in\nthe gene (i.e., the difference between pr and +),\nwhatever this difference is, causes the phenotypic difference. The idea\nthat the gene is the difference maker needs to be qualified:\ndifferences in the gene cause phenotypic differences in particular\ngenetic and environmental contexts. This idea is so crucial and so\noften overlooked that it merits articulation as a principle (Waters\n1994): \nDifference principle: differences in a classical gene cause\nuniform phenotypic differences in particular genetic and environmental\ncontexts. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the difference principle provides a\nmeans to explain the transmission of phenotypic characteristics from\none generation to the next without explaining how these characteristics\nare produced in the process of an organism's\ndevelopment. This effectively enabled classical geneticists to develop\na science of heredity without answering questions about\ndevelopment.  \n The practice of classical genetics included the theoretical analysis of\ncomplicated transmission patterns involving the recombination of\nphenotypic traits. Analyzing these patterns yielded information about\nthe basic biological processes such as chromosomal mechanics as well as\ninformation about the linear arrangement of genes in linkage groups.\nThese theoretical explanations did not depend on ideas about what genes\nare, how genes are replicated, what genes do, or how differences in\ngenes bring about differences in phenotypic traits.  \n\nResearch in molecular biology and genetics has yielded answers to\nthe basic questions left unanswered by classical genetics about the\nmake-up of genes, the mechanism of gene replication, what genes do, and\nthe way that gene differences bring about phenotypic differences. These\nanswers are couched in terms of molecular level phenomena and they\nprovide much of the basic theory associated with molecular\ngenetics. \n\nWhat is a gene?  This question is dealt with\nat further length in section 4 of this article, but a quick answer\nsuffices for present purposes: genes are linear sequences of\nnucleotides in DNA molecules. Each DNA molecule consists of a double\nchain of nucleotides. There are four kinds of nucleotides in DNA:\nguanine, cytosine, thymine, and adenine. The pair of nucleotide chains\nin a DNA molecule twist around one another in the form of a double\nhelix. The two chains in the helix are bound by hydrogen bonds between\nnucleotides from adjacent chains. The hydrogen bonding is specific so\nthat a guanine in one chain is always located next to cytosine in the\nadjacent chain (and vice-versa) and thymine in one chain is always\nlocated next to adenine (and vice-versa). Hence, the linear sequence of\nnucleotides in one chain of nucleotides in a DNA molecule is\ncomplimentary to the linear sequence of nucleotides in the other chain\nof the DNA molecule. A gene is a segment of nucleotides in one of\nthe chains of a DNA molecule. Of course, not every string of\nnucleotides in DNA is a gene; segments of DNA are identified as genes\naccording to what they do (see below). \n\nHow are genes replicated? The idea that genes are\nsegments in a DNA double helix provides a straightforward answer to\nthis question. Genes are faithfully replicated when the paired chains\nof a DNA molecule unwind and new chains are formed along side the\nseparating strands by the pairing of complementary nucleotides. When\nthe process is complete, two copies of the original double helix have\nbeen formed and hence the genes in the original DNA molecule have been\neffectively replicated. \n\nWhat do genes do? Roughly speaking, genes serve as\ntemplates in the synthesis of RNA molecules. The result is that the\nlinear sequence of nucleotides in a newly synthesized RNA molecule\ncorresponds to the linear sequence of nucleotides in the DNA segment\nused as the template. Different RNA molecules play different functional\nroles in the cell, and many RNA molecules play the role of template in\nthe synthesis of polypeptide molecules. Newly synthesized polypeptides\nare linear sequences of amino acids that constitute proteins and\nproteins play a wide variety of functional roles in the cell and\norganism (and environment). The ability of a polypeptide to function in\nspecific ways depends on the linear sequence of amino acids of which it\nis formed. And this linear sequence corresponds to the linear sequence\nof triplets of nucleotides in RNA (codons), which in turn corresponds\nto the linear sequence of nucleotides in segments of DNA, and this\nlatter segment is the gene for that polypeptide. \n\nHow do differences in genes bring about differences in\nphenotypic traits? The modest answer given above to the\nquestion ‘What do genes do?’\nprovides the basis for explaining how differences in genes can bring\nabout differences in phenotypic traits. A difference in the nucleotide\nsequence of a gene will result in the difference in the nucleotide\nsequence of RNA molecules, which in turn can result in a difference in\nthe amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. Differences in the linear\nsequences of amino acids in polypeptides (and in the linear sequences\nof nucleotides in functional RNA molecules) can affect the roles they\nplay in the cell and organism, sometimes having an effect that is\nobservable as a phenotypic difference. The mutations (differences in\ngenes) identified by the Morgan group (e.g., the purple mutation) have\nbeen routinely identified as differences in nucleotide sequences in\nDNA. \n\nThe modest answer to the question ‘What do genes do?’ is\nthat they “code for” or “determine” the linear\nsequences in RNA molecules and polypeptides synthesized in the\ncell. (Even this modest answer needs to be qualified because RNA\nmolecules are often spliced and edited in ways that affect the linear\nsequence of amino acids in the eventual polypeptide product.) But\nbiologists have offered a far less modest answer as well. The bolder\nanswer is part of a sweeping, fundamental theory. According to this\ntheory, genes are “fundamental” entities that\n“direct” the development and functioning of organisms by\n“producing” proteins that in turn regulate all the\nimportant cellular processes. It is often claimed that genes provide\n“the information”, “the blueprint”, or\n“the program” for an organism. It is useful to distinguish\nthis sweeping, fundamental theory about the\nallegedly fundamental role of genes from the modest, basic\ntheory about what genes do with respect to the synthesis of RNA\nand polypeptides. \n\nPhilosophers of science have been intrigued by ideals of\nreductionism and the grand scheme that all science will one day be\n“reduced” to a universal science of\nfundamental physics (see the entry on\n inter-theory relations in physics)\n for philosophical and scientific concepts of reductionism in the\ncontext of physical science). Philosophical reductionists believe that\nscientific knowledge progresses when higher-level sciences\n(e.g., chemistry) are reduced to lower-level sciences\n(e.g., physics). The so-called received view of scientific\nknowledge, codified in Nagel (1961) and Hempel (1966), promoted\nreductionism as a central ideal for science, and confidently asserted\nthat much progress had been made in the reduction of chemistry to\nphysics. Nagel constructed a formal model of reduction and applied it\nto illuminate how the science of thermodynamics, which was couched in\nterms of higher-level concepts such as pressure and temperature, was\nallegedly reduced to statistical mechanics, couched in terms of the\nlower-level concepts of Newtonian dynamics such as force and mean\nkinetic energy. In 1969, Schaffner claimed that the same kind of\nadvance was now taking place in genetics, and that the science of\nclassical genetics was being reduced to an emerging science of\n“molecular genetics.” Schaffner's claim, however, was\nquickly challenged by Hull. Other philosophers of biology developed\nHull's anti-reductionist arguments and a near consensus developed that\nclassical genetics was not and would not be reduced to molecular\ngenetics. Although the philosophical case for anti-reductionism has\nbeen challenged, many philosophers still assume that the\nanti-reductionist account of genetics provides an exemplar for\nanti-reductionist analyses of other sciences. \n\nReductionism has many meanings. For example, the phrase genetic\nreductionism concerns the idea that all biological phenomena are\ncaused by genes, and hence presupposes an ontological sense of\nreductionism according to which one kind of micro-entity (in this case,\ngene) exclusively causes a variety of higher-level phenomena (in this\ncase, biological features, cultural phenomena, and so forth). But\nthis is not the meaning of reductionism at issue in the philosophical\nliterature about the reduction of classical genetics. This literature\nis more concerned with epistemology than metaphysics. The concept of\nreductionism at issue is Nagel's concept of\ntheoretical reduction. (See Sarkar 1992 and Schaffner 1993 for\ndiscussions of alternative conceptions of reduction.) According to\nNagel's concept, the reduction of one science to\nanother science entails the reduction of the central theory of\none science to the central theory of the other. Nagel believed\nthat this kind of theoretical reduction led to progressive changes in\nscientific knowledge. He formulated two formal requirements for\ntheoretical reductions. \n\nNagel's first formal requirements was that the “laws” of\nthe reduced theory must be derivable from the laws and associated\ncoordinating definitions of the reducing theory. This deducibility\nrequirement was intended to capture the idea that the explanatory\nprinciples (or laws) of the reducing theory ought to explain the\nexplanatory principles (or laws) of the reduced theory. Nagel's\nsecond formal requirement, the connectability requirement, was that\nall essential terms of the reduced theory must either be contained\nwithin or be appropriately connected to the terms of the reducing\ntheory by way of additional assumptions. The connectability\nrequirement is presupposed by the derivability requirement,\nbut making it explicit helps emphasize an important task and potential\nstumbling block for carrying out theoretical reduction. \n\nSchaffner (1969) modified Nagel's model by\nincorporating the idea that what the reducing theory actually derives\n(and hence explains) is a corrected version of the reduced theory, not\nthe original theory. He argued that this revised model\nbetter captured reductions in the physical sciences. He claimed his\nrevised model could also be used to show how a corrected version of\nclassical genetics was being reduced to a new theory of physicochemical\nscience called molecular genetics. Hull (1974) countered that classical\ngenetics was not being reduced, at least not according to the model of\nreduction being applied by Schaffner. Hull argued that genetics did not\nexemplify Nagelian reduction because the fundamental terms of classical\ngenetics could not be suitably connected to expressions couched in\nterms of DNA. \n\nMost philosophers writing on genetics and reductionism have argued\nthat molecular genetics has not and will not reduce classical genetics\n(e.g., see Wimsatt  1976a, Darden and Maull 1977, Kitcher 1984,\nRosenberg 1985 and 1994, Dupré 1993, and Burian 1996). Two\nobjections to Schaffner's reductionist thesis have been most\npersuasive: the unconnectability objection and the gory details\nobjection. The unconnectability objection claims that the\nterminology of classical genetics cannot be redefined at the molecular\nlevel in terms of DNA. This objection effectively claims that\nNagel's second formal requirement, the connectability\nrequirement, cannot be satisfied. The gory details\nobjection alleges that molecular genetics cannot and will not\nexplain classical genetics or better explain the phenomena that are\nalready explained by the classical theory. This objection relates to\nNagel's first formal requirement, the derivability\nrequirement. But the gory details objection goes philosophically\ndeeper because it implies that even if the explanatory principles of\nclassical genetics could be derived from the explanatory principles of\nmolecular genetics, the derivations would not be explanatory.  \n\nThe most rigorous formulation of the unconnectability objection can be\nfound in the early writings of Rosenberg who once contended that there\nis an unbridgeable conceptual gap between the classical and molecular\ntheories of genetics (1985, 1994). In support of this contention,\nRosenberg argued that relations between the gene concept of classical\ngenetics and the concepts of molecular genetics are hopelessly\ncomplicated “many-many” relations that will forever\nfrustrate any attempt to systematically connect the two theories.\nRosenberg began his analysis by pointing out that in classical\ngenetics, genes are identified by way of their phenotypic effects.\nClassical geneticists identified the gene for purple eye-color, for\nexample, by carrying out carefully orchestrated breeding experiments\nand following the distribution of eye-color phenotypes in successive\ngenerations of a laboratory population. The reason classical genetics\nwill never be reduced to a molecular-level science, according to\nRosenberg (1985), is that there is no manageable connection between\nthe concept of a Mendelian phenotype and that of a molecular gene: \n\nThe pathway to red eye pigment production begins at many distinct\nmolecular genes and proceeds through several alternative branched\npathways. … The pathway from the [molecular] genes also\ncontains redundant, ambiguous, and interdependent paths. If we give a\nbiochemical characterization of the gene for red eye color either by\nappeal to the parts of its pathway of synthesis, or by appeal to the\nsegments of DNA that it begins with, our molecular description of this\ngene will be too intricate to be of any practical explanatory\nupshot. (Rosenberg 1985, p. 101) \n\nRosenberg concluded that since the relation between molecular genes\nand Mendelian phenotypes is exceedingly complex, the connection\nbetween any molecular concept and the Mendelian gene concept must also\nbe exceedingly complex, thereby blocking any systematic, reductive\nexplanation of classical genetics in terms of molecular-level\ntheory. \n\nThe gory details objection can be traced back to the writings of\nPutnam (1965) and Fodor (1968) who argued against reductionism of the\nmental on the basis that psychological functons are\nmultiply-realized. This objection against reductionism was further\ndeveloped in the context of genetics, most thoroughly by Kitcher\n(e.g., see Kitcher 1984, 1999, 2001).  Following Hull, Kitcher assumes\nthat classical genetics is transmission genetics. The classical\ntheory, according to Kitcher, explains the transmission of phenotypic\ntraits, not the development of phenotypic traits in individual\norganisms. And transmission phenomena, on Kitcher's account, are best\nexplained at the level of cytology: “The distribution of genes\nto gametes is to be explained, not by rehearsing the gory details of\nthe reshuffling of the molecules, but through the observation that\nchromosomes are aligned in pairs just prior to the meiotic division,\nand that one chromosome from each matched pair is transmitted to each\ngamete.” (Kitcher 1984, p. 370). Kitcher suggests that the\npairing and separation of chromosomes belong to a natural kind of pair\nseparation processes which are heterogeneous from the molecular\nperspective because different kinds of forces are responsible for\nbringing together and pulling apart different paired entities. The\nseparation of paired entities, he claims, “may occur because of\nthe action of electromagnetic forces or even nuclear forces; but it is\neasy to think of examples in which the separation is effected by the\naction of gravity.” (Kitcher 1984, p. 350) \n\nThe image of genetics that emerges from the anti-reductionist\nliterature is of a two-tiered science composed of two discreet\ntheoretical discourses, one grounded in principles about entities at\nthe cytological level (such as chromosomes) and the other grounded in\nprinciples about entities at the molecular level (such as nucleotide\nsequences in DNA). Anti-reductionists believe some phenomena,\nincluding transmission of genes, are best explained by a theory\ngrounded at the cytological level and other phenomena, including the\nexpression of genes, are best explained by a theory grounded at the\nmolecular level. Although Kitcher argues that classical genetics\nprovides the best explanation in an objective sense, some\nanti-reductionists (e.g., Rosenberg 1985, 1994) believe that the\nobstacles to reduction are merely practical. Rosenberg (1985,\n1994) appealed to the concept of supervenience to argue that in\nprinciple, molecular genetics would provide the best\nexplanations. But he argued that in practice, classical\ngenetics provides the “best” explanation of transmission\nphenomena, in the sense that this is the best explanation available to\ncreatures with our cognitive limitations. Subsequently, however,\nRosenberg changed his position on this issue, largely on the grounds\nthat that technological advances in information storage and processing\n\"may substantially enhance our capacity to understand macromolecular\nprocesses and their combinations\" (Rosenberg 2006, p. 14). \n\nDespite philosophically significant differences in their views about\nthe ultimate basis of the irreducibility of classical genetics, the\nimage of biological knowledge that emerges from the\nantireductionists' writings is similar. The biological world\nconsists of different domains of phenomena and each domain is best\nexplained at a particular level of theoretical discourse. Hence, the\nideal structure for biology is akin to a layer-cake, with tiers of\ntheories, each of which provides the best possible account of its\ndomain of phenomena. Biological sciences such as classical genetics\nthat are couched in terms of higher levels of organization should\npersist, secure from the reductive grasp of molecular science, because\ntheir central theories (or patterns of reasoning) explain domains of\nphenomena that are best explained at levels higher than the molecular\nlevel.  \n\nThe anti-reductionist consensus has not gone unchallenged (see Sarkar\n1989, 1992 and 1998, Schaffner 1993, and Waters 1990 and 2000).\nAccording to critics, the chief objections supporting the consensus\nare mistaken. The unconnectability objection rests on the assumption\nthat classical genetics took the relationships between genes and\nphenotypic traits to be simple one-to-one relationships. But classical\ngeneticists knew better.  Consider what Sturtevant, one of Morgan's\nstar students and collaborators, had to say about genes and eye\ncolor: \n\nThe difference between normal red eyes and colorless (white) ones in\nDrosophila is due to a difference in a single gene. Yet red\nis a very complex color, requiring the interaction of at least five\n(and probably of very many more) different genes for its\nproduction. And these genes are quite independent, each chromosome\nbearing some of them. Moreover, eye-color is indirectly dependent upon\na large number of other genes such as those on which the life of the\nfly depends. We can then, in no sense identify a given gene with the\nred color of the eye, even though there is a single gene\ndifferentiating it from the colorless eye. So it is for all\ncharacters … (my emphasis, quoted from Carlson 1988, p. 69) \n\nThis quotation suggests that the relationship between gene and\neye-color in classical genetics exhibited the same complexity that\nRosenberg discussed at the molecular level (compare this quotation to\nthe passage from Rosenberg 1985 quoted in section 3.2). According to\nthis critique of the unconnectability objection, it is not the case\nthat genotype-phenotype relationships appear simple and uniform at\nthe level of classical genetics and complicated and dis-unified at the\nmolecular level. The situation appears similarly complex at both levels\nof analysis (Waters 1990). \n\nClassical genetics nevertheless finds a simple way to explain\ntransmission phenomena by appealing to the difference principle,\naccording to which particular differences in particular genes\ncause particular differences in phenotypic traits in\nparticular contexts (see section 2.1). Sturtevant alludes to this\nprinciple in the first sentence of the quotation above and again in\nthe emphasized clause. So the question arises, can this relationship\nbe captured at the molecular level? And the answer is yes. The\ndifferences used by classical geneticists to explain inheritance\npatterns have been routinely identified at the molecular level by\ncontemporary geneticists. \n\nAccording to this critique, the gory details objection also fails.\nThis objection claims that biologists cannot improve upon\nthe classical explanations of transmission phenomena by citing\nmolecular details. The cytological level allegedly provides the best\nlevel of explanation because explanations at this level uniformly\naccount for a wide range of cases that would look heterogeneous from a\nmolecular perspective. Consider Kitcher's formulation of this\nobjection. Kitcher believes that to explain is to unify (1989). It\nfollows that the best explanation of a class of phenomena is the\nexplanation that accounts for the class in a uniform way. Kitcher\nclaims meiosis exemplifies this kind of situation. The uniformity of\npair-separation processes is evident at the cytological level, but is\nlost in the gory details at the molecular level where the process\n“may occur because of the action of electromagnetic forces or\neven of nuclear forces …” (Kitcher 1984, p. 350). But\nit is unclear what Kitcher could have in mind. The molecular\nmechanisms underlying the pairing and separation of chromosomes are\nremarkably uniform in creatures ranging from yeast to human beings; it\nis not the case that some involve electromagnetic forces and others\ninvolve nuclear forces.  Kitcher's claim that “it is easy\nto think of examples in which the separation is effected by the action\nof gravity” has no basis in what molecular biologists have\nlearned about the pairing and separation of chromosomes. \n\nMeiosis is an unpromising candidate to illustrate the idea that what\nappears uniform at the level of classical genetics turns out to be\nheterogeneous at the molecular level. But this idea is illustrated by\nother genetic phenomena. Consider the phenomenon of genetic dominance.\nIn classical genetics, all examples of complete dominance are treated\nalike for the purposes of explaining transmission phenomena. But\ncontemporary genetics reveals that there are several very different\nmechanisms underlying different instances of dominance. According to\nKitcher's unificationist theory of scientific\nexplanation, the classical account of dominance provides an objectively\nbetter basis for explaining transmission phenomena because it provides\na more unified organization of the phenomena. But this would imply that\nthe shallow explanations of classical genetics are objectively\npreferable to the deeper explanations provided by the molecular theory\n(Waters 1990).  \n\nAlthough Nagel's concept of theoretical reduction marks a common\nstarting point for discussions about the apparent reduction of\nclassical genetics, much of the literature on reduction is aimed at\nseeking a better understanding of the nature of reduction by seeking\nto replace Nagel's concept with a more illuminating one. This is true\nof the anti-reductionists, who seek to clarify why molecular genetics\ncannot reduce classical genetics, as well as those who have been more\nsympathetic to reductionism. Hence, there are two levels of discourse\nin the literature examining the question of whether molecular genetics\nis reducing classical genetics.  One level concerns what is happening\nin the science of genetics. The other concerns more abstract issues\nabout the nature of (epistemological) reduction. \n\nThe abstract level of discourse began with Schaffner's idea that what\nis reduced is not the original theory, but rather a corrected version\nof the original theory.  Wimsatt (1976a) offers a more ambitious\nmodification. He rejects the assumption that scientific theories are\nsets of law-like statements and that explanations are arguments in\nwhich the phenomena to-be-explained are derived from laws. Instead of\nrelying on these assumptions, Wimsatt uses Salmon's account of\nexplanation (Salmon 1971) to examine claims that molecular genetics\noffered reductive explanations. Kitcher (1984) also rejects the\naccount of theorizing underlying Nagel's concept of reduction. He\nconstructs a new concept of reductive explanation based on his own\nidea of what effectively constitutes a scientific theory and his\nunificationist account of scientific explanation (1989). Likewise,\nSarkar (1998) rejects the account of theories and explanation\npresupposed in Nagel's concept of reduction. In fact, he explicitly\navoids relying on any particular account of scientific theories or\ntheoretical explanation. Instead, he assumes that reductive\nexplanations are explanations without specifying what an explanation\nis, and then seeks to identify the features that set reductive\nexplanations apart from other explanations. \n\nWimsatt, Kitcher, and Sarkar seek to replace Nagel's conception of\nreduction with a conception that does not assume that scientic\nexplanation involves subsumption under universal laws. Weber (2005),\nhowever, seeks to replace Nagel's conception with one that retains the\nidea that reductive explanation involves subsumption under laws of the\nreducing science. What Weber rejects is the idea that reductionism in\nbiology involves explaining higher-level biological laws. He argues\nthat, with some rare exceptions, biological sciences don't have\nlaws. He contends that reductionism in biology involves explaining\nbiological phenomena directly in terms of physical laws. Hence, he\nrejects the \"layer-cake\" conception of reduction implicit in Nagel's\naccount. \n\nThe literature about reduction and molecular genetics has influenced\nphilosophers' thinking about reduction in other sciences. For example,\nKitcher's concept of reduction, which he uses to explain why molecular\ngenetics cannot reduce classical genetics, has subsequently been\nemployed by Hardcastle (1992) in her examination of the relationship\nbetween psychology and neuroscience. On the other side, Sober develops\nand extends the criticism of Kitcher's gory details objection (section 3.3) by re-examining the arguments of Putnam (1967, 1975) and Fodor\n(1968, 1975) on multiple-realizability. \n\nSober (1999) argues that higher-level sciences can describe patterns\ninvisible at lower level, and hence might offer more general\nexplanations. But he insists that description should not be confused\nwith explanation. He maintains that although physics might not be able\nto describe all the patterns, it can nevertheless\nexplain any singular occurrence that a higher-level science\ncan explain. Higher-level sciences might provide more \"general\"\nexplanations, but physics provides \"deeper\" ones. He suggests that\nwhich explanation is better is in the eye of the beholder. He\nconcludes that \n\nThe discussion has gone full circle. The multiple-realizability\nargument being criticized by Sober was based on abstract\nconsiderations in the context of philosophy of mind. Philosophers of\nbiology drew on this literature to construct the gory details\nobjection against the idea that molecular genetics is reducing\nclassical genetics. Other philosophers argued that this objection did\nnot stand up to a careful analysis of the concrete situation in\ngenetics. Sober has developed lessons from the discussion about\ngenetics to critique the original anti-realizability argument and draw\ngeneral conclusions about reductionism.  \n\nWimsatt's writings on reduction (1976a, 1976b, and 1979) emphasize the\nfruitfulness of attempting to achieve a reduction, even when a\nreduction is not achieved. He argues, for instance, that efforts to\ndiscover the molecular make-ups of entities identified at higher\nlevels is often fruitful, even when identities between levels cannot\nbe found. In addition, Wimsatt points out that the “costs”\nof working out reductive explanations of the many particulars already\nexplained at a higher level are relevant to the question of why there\nis not a full-scale replacement of higher level explanations with\nlower level ones. Perhaps the fact that molecular genetics has not\nreplaced classical genetics can be explained on the basis of high\ncosts rather than lack of epistemic merit.  \n\nWhile Schaffner still maintains that molecular genetics can in\nprinciple reduce classical genetics, he has conceded that attempts to\ncarry out the reduction would be “peripheral” to the\nadvance of molecular genetics. One might respond, along the lines of\nHull (1977), that the success of molecular genetics seems to be\nreductive in some important sense. Hence, the failure to illuminate\nthis success in terms of reduction reveals a conceptual defiency. That\nis, one might argue that Schaffner's peripherality thesis indicates\nthat his conception of reduction is not the epistemically relevant one\nbecause it cannot illuminate the fruitfulness of reductive inquiry in\nmolecular genetics. \n\nIn fact, a general shortcoming in the debate about the reduction of\nclassical genetics is that it concerns only a fragment of scientific\nreasoning. It is based almost exclusively on an analysis of\nexplanatory or theoretical reasoning and largely ignores investigative\nreasoning. The philosophical literature on the alleged reduction of\nclassical genetics focuses on how geneticists explain or try\nto explain phenomena, not how they manipulate or\ninvestigate phenomena. This is even true of Wimsatt's (1976a)\naccount of heuristics, which stress heuristics for explanation. \n\nVance (1996) offers a more thorough shift in attention from theory to\ninvestigative practice. He asserts that there is only one contemporary\nscience of genetics and describes how investigative methods of\nclassical genetics are an essential part of the methodology of what is\ncalled molecular genetics. He concludes that reductionism\nfails because contemporary genetics still depends on methods of\nclassical genetics involving breeding experiments.  Vance's picture of\ngenetics is compelling. The laboratory methods of classical genetics\ndo indeed persist, even as they are greatly extended, augmented, and\noften replaced by techniques involving direct intervention on DNA. But\nVance's picture does not match the anti-reductionist image of a\ntwo-tiered science and the contention that classical genetics will\nremain aloof from the reductive grasp of molecular biology. \n\nA different image emerges from viewing genetics as an investigative\nscience involving an interplay of methodological and explanatory\nreasoning (Waters 2004a). This image is not of a two-tiered science,\none (classical genetics) aimed at investigating and explaining\ntransmission phenomena and another (molecular genetics) aimed at\ninvestigating and explaining developmental phenomena. Instead, there\nis one science that retains much of the investigative and explanatory\nreasoning of classical genetics by re-conceptualizing its theoretical\nbasis in molecular terms and by retooling its basic investigative\napproach by integrating methodologies of classical genetics with\nphysically-based methods of biochemistry and new methods based on\nrecombinant DNA and RNA interference technologies. \n\nA common claim in the philosophical literature about molecular\ngenetics is that genes cannot be conceived at the molecular level. Of\ncourse, philosophers do not deny that biologists use the term\ngene, but many philosophers believe gene is a dummy\nterm, a placeholder for many different concepts. Different responses\nto gene skepticism illustrate a variety of philosophical aims and\napproaches. One kind of response is to analyze explanations closely\ntied to experimental practice (rather than sweeping generalizations of\na fundamental theory) in order to determine whether there are uniform\npatterns of reasoning about genes that could (a) be codified into\nclear concepts, and/or (b) used to establish the reference of the\nterm. Another kind of response is to propose new gene concepts that\nwill better serve the expressed aims of practicing biologists. A third\nkind of response is to implement survey analysis, rather than conduct\ntraditional methods of philosophical analysis. A fourth kind of\nresponse is to embrace the (allegedly) necessary vagueness of the gene\nconcept(s) and to examine why use of the term gene is so\nuseful. \n\nGene skeptics claim that there is no coherence to the way\ngene is used at the molecular level and that this term does\nnot designate a natural kind; rather, gene is allegedly used\nto pick out many different kinds of units in DNA. DNA consists of\n“coding” regions that are transcribed into RNA, different\nkinds of regulatory regions, and in higher organisms, a number of\nregions whose functions are less clear and perhaps in cases\nnon-existent. Skepticism about genes is based in part on the idea that\nthe term is sometimes applied to only parts of a coding region,\nsometimes to an entire coding region, sometimes to parts of a coding\nregion and to regions that regulate that coding region, and sometimes\nto an entire coding region and regulatory regions affecting or\npotentially affecting the transcription of the coding region.\nSkeptics (e.g., Burian 1986, Portin 1993, and Kitcher 1992) have\nconcluded, as Kitcher succinctly puts it: “a gene is whatever a\ncompetent biologist chooses to call a gene” (Kitcher 1992,\np. 131). \n\nBiological textbooks contain definitions of gene and it is\ninstructive to consider one in order to show that the conceptual\nsituation is indeed unsettling. The most prevalent contemporary\ndefinition is that a gene is the fundamental unit that codes for a\npolypeptide. One problem with this definition is that it\nexcludes many segments that are typically referred to as genes. Some\nDNA segments code for functional RNA molecules that are never\ntranslated into polypeptides. Such RNA molecules include transfer RNA,\nribosomal RNA, and RNA molecules that play regulatory and catalytic\nroles. Hence, this definition is too narrow. \n\nAnother problem with this common definition is that it is based on\nan overly simplistic account of DNA expression. According to this\nsimple account, a gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA that is\ntranscribed into a sequence of nucleotides making up a messenger RNA\nmolecule that is in turn translated into sequence of amino acids that\nforms a polypeptide. (Biologists talk as if genes “produce the\npolypeptide molecules” or  “provide the information\nfor the polypeptide”.) The real situation of DNA expression,\nhowever, is often far more complex. For example, in plants and\nanimals, many mRNA molecules are processed before they are translated\ninto polypeptides. In these cases, portions of the RNA molecule,\ncalled introns, are snipped out and the remaining segments,\ncalled exons, are spliced together before the RNA molecule\nleaves the cellular nucleus. Sometimes biologists call the entire DNA\nregion, that is the region that corresponds to both introns and exons,\nthe gene.  Other times, they call only the portions of the DNA segment\ncorresponding to the exons the gene. (This means that some DNA\nsegments that geneticists call genes are not continuous segments of\nDNA; they are collections of discontinuous exons. Geneticists call\nthese split genes.)  Further complications arise because\nthe splicing of exons in some cases is executed differentially in\ndifferent tissue types and at different developmental stages. (This\nmeans that there are overlapping genes.) The problem with the\ncommon definition that genes are DNA segments that “code for\npolypeptides” is that the notion of “coding for a\npolypeptide” is ambiguous when it comes to actual complications\nof DNA expression. Gene skeptics argue that it is hopelessly ambiguous\n(Burian 1986, Fogle 1990 and 2000, Kitcher 1992, and Portin 1993). \n\nClearly, this definition, which is the most common and prominent\ntextbook definition, is too narrow to be applied to the range of\nsegments that geneticists commonly call genes and too ambiguous to\nprovide a single, precise partition of DNA into separate\ngenes. Textbooks include many definitions of the gene.  In fact,\nphilosophers have often been frustrated by the tendency of biologists\nto define and use the term gene in a number of contradictory\nways in one and the same textbook. After subjecting the alternative\ndefinitions to philosophical scrutiny, gene skeptics have concluded\nthat the problem isn't simply a lack of analytical rigor. The\nproblem is that there simply is no such thing as a gene at the\nmolecular level. That is, there is no single, uniform, and unambiguous\nway to divide a DNA molecule into different genes. Gene skeptics have\noften argued that biologists should couch their science in terms of\nDNA segments such exon, intron, promotor region, and so on, and\ndispense with the term gene altogether (most forcefully\nargued by Fogle 2000). \n\nIt has been argued, against gene skepticism, that biologists have a\ncoherent, precise, and uniform way to conceive of genes at the\nmolecular level. The analysis underlying this\nargument begins by distinguishing between two different ways\ncontemporary geneticists think about genes. Classical geneticists\noften conceived of genes as the functional units in chromosomes,\ndifferences in which cause differences in phenotypes. Today, in\ncontexts where genes are identified by way of observed phenotypic\ndifferences, geneticists still conceive of genes in this classical\nway, as the functional units in DNA whose differences are causing the\nobserved differences in phenotypes. This way of conceiving of genes is\ncalled the classical gene concept (Waters 1994). But\ncontemporary geneticists also think about genes in a different way by\ninvoking a molecular-level concept. The molecular gene\nconcept stems from the idea that genes are units in DNA that\nfunction to determine linear sequences in molecules synthesized via\nDNA expression. According to this analysis, both concepts are at work\nin contemporary geneticists.  Moss 2003 also distinguishes between two\ncontemporary gene concepts, which he calls “genes-P\n(preformationist)” and “genes-D (developmental)”. He\nargues that conflation of these concepts leads to erroneous thinking\nin genetics. \n\nMuch confusion concerning the classical way to think about genes is\ndue to the fact that geneticists have sometimes talked as if\nclassically conceived genes are for gross phenotypic\ncharacters (phenotypes) or as if individual genes produce phenotypes. This talk was very misleading on the part of\nclassical geneticists and continues to be misleading in the context of\ncontemporary genetics. The production of a gross phenotypic character,\nsuch as purple eye-color, involves all sorts of genetic and\nextra-genetic factors including various cellular enzymes and\nstructures, tissue arrangements, and environmental factors. In\naddition, it is not clear what, if any, gross phenotypic level\nfunctions can be attributed to individual genes. For example, it is no\nclearer today than it was in Morgan's day that the function of the\npurple gene discussed in section 2.1 is to contribute to the\nproduction of eye color. Mutations in this gene affect a number of\ngross phenotypic level traits. Legitimate explanatory reasoning\ninvoking the classical gene concept does not depend on any baggage\nconcerning what genes are for or what function a gene might have in\ndevelopment. What the explanatory reasoning depends on is the\ndifference principle, that is, the principle that some difference in\nthe gene causes certain phenotypic differences in particular genetic\nand environmental contexts (section 2.1). Many gene-based explanations\nin contemporary biology are best understood in terms of the classical\ngene concept and the difference principle. \n\nPerhaps the reason gene skeptics overlooked the molecular gene concept\nis that they were searching for the wrong kind of concept. The concept\nis not a purely physicochemical concept, and it does not provide a\nsingle partition of DNA into separate genes.  Instead, it is a\nfunctional concept that provides a uniform way to think about genes\nthat can be applied to pick out different DNA segments in different\ninvestigative or explanatory contexts. The basic\nmolecular concept, according to this analysis, is the concept of a\ngene for a linear sequence in a product of DNA expression: \n A gene g for linear sequence l in product p\nsynthesized in cellular context c is a potentially\nreplicating nucleotide sequence, n, usually contained in DNA,\nthat determines the linear sequence l in product p\nat some stage of DNA expression (Waters 2000) \n\nThe concept of the molecular gene can be presented as a 4-tuple:\n<n,l,p,c >.  This analysis\nshows how geneticists can consistently include introns as part of a\ngene in one epistemic context and not in another. If the context\ninvolves identifying a gene for a primary, preprocessed RNA molecule,\nthen the gene includes the introns as well as the exons. If the\ncontext involves identifying the gene for the resulting polypeptide,\nthen the gene includes only the exons. Hence, in the case of DNA\nexpression that eventually leads to the synthesis of a given\npolypeptide, geneticists might talk as if “the” gene\nincluded the intron (in which case they would be referring to the gene\nfor the primary, preprocessed RNA) and yet also talk as if\n“the” gene excluded the introns (in which case they would\nbe referring to the gene for the mature RNA or\npolypeptide). Application of the molecular gene concept is not\nambiguous; in fact, it is remarkably precise provided one specifies\nthe values for the variables in the expression “gene for linear\nsequence l in product p synthesized in cellular\ncontext c.” \n\nGene skeptics have suggested that there is a lack of coherence in gene\ntalk because biologists often talk as if genes code for polypeptides,\nbut then turn around and talk about genes for RNA molecules that are\nnot translated into polypeptides (including genes for RNA [tRNA],\nribosomal RNA [rRNA], and interference RNA [iRNA]). This account shows\nthat conceiving of genes for rRNA involves the same idea as conceiving\nof genes for polypeptides. In both cases, the gene is the segment of\nDNA, split or not, that determines the linear sequence in the molecule\nof interest. \n\nAn advantage of this analysis is that it emphasizes the limitations\nof gene-centered explanations while clarifying the distinctive causal\nrole genes play in the syntheses of RNA and polypeptides: genes\ndetermine the linear sequences of primary RNA transcripts and often\nplay a distinctive role, though not exclusive, in determining the\nsequence of amino acids in polypeptides. \n Weber (2005) examines the evolution of the gene concept by tracing\nchanges in the reference of the term gene through the history\nof genetics. The reference or extension of a term is\nthe set of objects to which it reference. Weber adopts a mixed theory\nof refence. According to mixed theories, the reference of a term is\ndetermined how the relevant linguistic community causally interacts\nwith potential referents as well as how they describe potential\nreferents. This theory leads Weber to pay close attention, not just to\nhow geneticists theorized about genes or used the concept to explain\nphenomena, but also how they conducted their laboratory\ninvestigations. Following Kitcher (1978, 1982), he examines ways in\nwhich modes of reference changed over time. \n\nWeber identifies six different gene concepts, beginning with Darwin's\npangene concept (1868) and ending with the contemporary concept of\nmolecular genetics. He distinguishes the contemporary molecular\nconcept from the classical (or ‘neoclassical’) one on the\nbasis of how geneticists described their functional role (RNA/protein\ncoding versus general function unit), their material basis (RNA/DNA\nversus chromosome), and their structure (discontinuous linear -- with\nintrons and exons versus continuous linear) as well as on the basis of\nthe criteria experimentalists used to identify genes (by gene product\nversus complementation test).  \n\nWeber examines how the investigation of several particular\nDrosophila genes changed as the science of genetics\ndeveloped. His study shows that the methods of molecular genetics\nprovided new ways to identify genes that were first identified by\nclassical techniques. The reference of the term changed, not simply as\na result of theoretical developments, but also as a result of the\nimplementation of new methods to identify genes. He concludes that\nunlike concepts of physical science that have been analyzed by\nphilosophers, the gene concept has a “nonessentialistic character that\nallows biologists to lay down different natural classifications,\ndepending on the investigative methods available as well as on\ntheoretical interests” (Weber 2005, p. 228). Weber calls this feature\n“floating references”. \n\nNeumann-Held (2001) proposes a new way to think about genes in the\ncontext of developmental genetics. She says that in this context,\ninterest in genes is largely focused on the regulated expression of\npolypeptides. She notes that textbook definitions of gene often\nacknowledge this interest and quotes the following definition from a\nscientific textbook: \n A combination of DNA segments that together constitute an expressible\nunit, expression leading the formation of one or more specific\nfunctional gene products that may lead to either RNA molecules or\npolypeptides. The segments of a gene include (1) the transcribed unit\n… and any regulatory segments included in the transcription\nunit, and (2) the regulatory sequences that flank the trancription\nunit and are required for specific expression. (Singer and Berg 1991,\np. 41). \n\nThis definition emphasizes that regulatory sequences as well as\ncoding regions are required for “specific\nexpression.” Only a small proportion of coding sequences\nare transcribed in a given cell at a particular time, and whether a\nparticular sequence is transcribed depends in part on regulatory\nregions external to the coding region. \n\nNeumann-Held points out that if the aim is to specify what is\nnecessary for regulated synthesis of polypeptides, then one must\ninclude even more than what is located in the DNA. This follows from\nthe fact that processes such as differential splicing (and RNA editing\nprocesses such as methylation that I have not discussed in this\narticle) involve entities outside of DNA such as splicing agents.  She\nsuggests that it is appropriate, at least in the context of\ndevelopmental genetics, to reconceive genes as processes. She proposes\nthe following process molecular gene concept. \n\nNeumann-Held argues that this conception provides the clearest basis\nfor understanding how DNA sequences are “used in the processes\nof polypeptide production.” She points out that the\nprocess molecular gene concept allows for the inclusion of coding\nsequences in DNA, regulatory sequences in DNA and also entities not\nlocated in DNA, all of which are causally involved in the production\nof polypeptides. Neumann-Held's concept excludes transcription\nprocesses and coding regions of DNA that lead to functional RNA\nmolecules that are not translated into polypeptides. Hence, according\nto her account, there are not process molecular genes for tRNA\n(transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA) or snRNA (small nuclear\nRNA). This feature of Neumann-Held's definition does not match the\ntextbook definition that she quotes to motivate her account (presented\nabove). Furthermore, the exclusion of these coding regions does not\ntrack with recent discoveries about the important functions played by\nnon-coding RNA molecules such as snRNAs. Her definition could easily\nbe revised to accommodate these regions and processes. In any case,\nNeumann-Held believes using this concept in developmental genetics,\nrather than DNA-centered gene concepts, will help avoid the view that\n“genes are the most important explanatory factors in biology\nbecause of their unique causal powers” (Neumann-Held 2001,\np. 80). \n\nStotz and Griffiths (2004) believe that the variety of gene concepts\nused throughout the biological sciences calls for a more systematic\nand explicitly empirical approach. They point out that individual\nphilosophers cannot grasp all the intricacies of the different\ncontexts across the broad range of biological sciences in which gene\nconcepts are employed. They have embarked upon an ambitious project to\nsurvey practicing scientists in an attempt to help identify how\nscientists actually conceive of genes. Their interest extends\nfar beyond understanding “molecular genetics.” They hope\nto learn about the concepts employed in many different areas and\ncontexts of biology by spotting differences in the way biologists from\ndifferent areas (and biologists in different age groups, sexes, etc.)\nanswer sophisticated questionnaires. \n\nAn initial motivation behind Stotz and Griffith's project was to test\nphilosophical accounts of the gene concept. As Griffiths asked, if\ntheir survey-based study revealed that scientists don't actually\nthink of genes in the way set out by a philosophical account, then\nwhat value could the account possibly have? There are, however, a\nnumber of daunting, practical difficulties with using a questionnaire\nto learn how a person is thinking, especially if the person's thinking\ninvolves the use of multiple concepts and/or is sometimes or somewhat\nmuddled (Waters 2004b). It is also difficult to survey appropriate and\nrepresentative samples of scientists. Griffiths and Stotz are aware of\nthese difficulties and have refined their project through successive\nsurveys. \n\nEven if Stotz and Griffith's survey succeeds in identifying how\nscientists in different areas of biology actually think about genes in\ndifferent contexts, it does not follow that their findings would\nprovide an appropriate test of the classical, molecular, or process\nmolecular gene concepts. The aim of the proponents of these concepts\nis to re-interpret the knowledge of contemporary genetics by replacing\nsloppy thinking based on unclear concepts with more rigorous thinking\nin terms of precise concepts. Showing that scientists' actual\nthinking does not align with the precise application of these concepts\nwould not refute the analysis supporting the classical gene or\nmolecular gene concepts and it would not undermine the argument\nmotivating the proposal for the new process molecular gene\nconcept. \n\nAlthough it appears that survey-based findings would not provide an\nappropriate test of philosophical analyses of gene concepts, they\nmight provide, as Stotz and Griffiths claim, important information\nrelevant to those conducting philosophical research on gene concepts.\nFor example, if such surveys find significant differences in the way\nevolutionary biologists and developmental geneticists answer questions\nabout what counts as gene, philosophers might examine whether the\ncontexts in which these biologists practice call for different gene\nconcepts. Survey results could provide a useful heuristic for\nconducting concept analyses. \n\nGene skeptics such as Burian, Portin, and Fogle claim that the term\ngene has outlived its usefulness. They argue that the term is\nboth too vague and too restrictive. It is too vague, they believe,\nbecause it does not provide a unique parsing of the genome. Borders\nbetween genes are overlapping and allegedly ambiguous. It is not\nclear, they argue, whether genes include or exclude introns,\nregulatory regions, and so forth. The term is allegedly too\nrestrictive because it obscures the diversity of molecular elements\nplaying different roles in the expression and regulation of DNA. In\naddition, any attempt to resolve the ambiguities, these skeptics\nargue, will make the term even more restrictive. \n\nKeller's account of the history of twentieth century genetics seems to\nreinforce gene skepticism. For example, she argues that the question\nabout what genes are for has become increasingly difficult to answer\n(Keller 2000). By the end of the twentieth century, she says,\nbiological findings have revealed a complexity of developmental\ndynamics that make it impossible to conceive of genes as distinct\ncausal agents in development. Keller emphasizes that words have power\nand devotes a good deal of attention to the way loose gene talk has\naffected biological research by reinforcing the assumption that the\ngene is “the core explanatory concept of biological structure\nand function” (Keller 2000, p. 9), an assumption with which she\nstrongly disagrees. Yet Keller does not endorse the view of gene\nskeptics who argue that biology would be improved if biologists\nstopped talking about “genes” and restricted themselves to\nterms designating molecular units such as nucleotide, codon, coding\nregion, promotor region, and so on. Keller maintains that the term\ngene continues to have “obvious and undeniable\nuses.” \n\nOne use of the term gene, according to Keller, is that its\nvagueness, the very feature that troubles philosophers, makes it\npossible for biologists to be flexible, to communicate across\ndisciplinary boundaries, and to think in new ways: \n\nThe meaning of an experimental effect depends on its relation to\nother effects, and the use of language too closely tied to particular\nexperimental practices would, by its very specificity, render\ncommunication across difference experimental contexts effectively\nimpossible. (Keller 2000, p. 140). \n\nKeller identifies a second reason that gene talk is useful.\nThe term gene applies to entities that can be experimentally\nmanipulated to produce definite and reproducible effects (though given\nKeller's criticism of gene concepts, it is unclear to what entities\nshe thinks the term refers). She suggests that genes are short-term\ncauses. She points out, however, that this does not mean genes are\nlong-term causes or that genes are the fundamental causal agents of\ndevelopment. Rather, what it means (and Keller thinks this is an\nimportant reason why gene talk will continue) is that genes can be\nused as handles to manipulate biological processes (also see Waters\n2000). And for these two reasons, Keller concludes,\ngene talk will and should continue to play an important role in\nbiological discourse. \n\nThe science called molecular genetics is associated with a fundamental\ntheory according to which genes and DNA direct all basic life\nprocesses by providing the information specifying the development and\nfunctioning of organisms. The genome is said to specify the\n“developmental program,” “master plan,” or\n“blue print” for development while other elements provide\nthe materials (e.g., Bonner 1965, Jacob and Monod 1961, Mayr 1961,\nMaynard Smith 2000, Rosenberg 2006). Although the idea that the\nchromosomes contain a “code-script” for the development\nand functioning of an organism was famously expressed by Schrodinger\n(1944) before the era of molecular genetics, today it is often\nexpressed in explicitly molecular terms. The information of\ndevelopment and function, which is passed down from one generation to\nthe next, is allegedly encoded in the nucleotide sequences comprising\ngenes and DNA. This so-called “genetic information” is\nfirst “transcribed” into RNA, then\n“translated” into proteins, and finally\n“expressed” in the development and functioning of\norganisms. \n\nThe concept of genetic information has a prominent place in the\nhistory of molecular genetics, beginning with Watson and Crick's\nobservation that since any sequence of nucleotide base pairs could fit\ninto the structure of any DNA molecule “that in a long molecule\nmany different permutations are possible, and it therefore seems\nlikely that the precise sequence of the bases is the code which\ncarries the genetic information.” (Watson and Crick 1953). As\nDownes (2005) recounts, the geneticists Jacob and Monod reinforced the\nuse of information language as did those who sought to crack the\n“genetic code”. By the early 1960s, the language of\ninformation was well-entrenched in the field of molecular\ngenetics. \n\nPhilosophers have generally criticized the theory that genes and DNA\nprovide all the information and have challenged the use of sweeping\nmetaphors such as “master plan” and “progam”\nwhich suggest that genes and DNA contain all developmental\ninformation. Critics have taken a number of different positions. Most\nseem to accept the notion that biological systems or processes contain\ninformation, but they deny the idea that DNA has a exceptional role in\nproviding information. Some are content to argue that under various\nexisting theories of information, such as causal theories or standard\nteleosemantic theories, information is not restricted to DNA. But\nothers contend that understanding what genes do requires a new\nconception of biological information. One approach is to retreat to a\nnarrow conception of coding specifically aimed at clarifying the sense\nin which DNA provides information for the synthesis of polypeptides,\nbut not for higher-level traits (e.g.  Godfrey-Smith 2000). Another\napproach is to construct a new, broad conception of biological\ninformation and use this conception to show that the informational\nrole of genes is not exclusive (Jablonka 2002).  A different approach\nis to abandon information talk altogether and explain the\ninvestigative and explanatory reasoning associated with genetics and\nmolecular biology in purely causal terms. \n\nThe fundamental theory that says the role of DNA is to provide the\ninformation for development has been criticized on many\ngrounds. Keller (2000) points out that the idea flounders on an\nambiguity. Does DNA provide the “program” or the\n“data?” Others have argued that “information”\nfor development flows from a vast number of “resources,”\nnot just genetic resources. Oyama (1985) suggests that it is a mistake\nto think information is contained within static entities such as\nDNA. She believes that information exists in life-cycles. Other\ncriticisms challenge applications of particular conceptions or\ntheories of information, including applications of the causal and\nteleosemantic conceptions.  \n\n Griffiths (2001) distinguishes between two ways to conceive of\ninformation, causal and intentional, and then argues that under either\nconception, information is not restricted to DNA. Causal theories of\ninformation, based on Dretske's (1981), are related to the Shannon\nmathematical theory of information (1948). Dretske distinguishes\nbetween a source variable and background or channel conditions. On\nGriffiths' (2001) reading of Dretske's theory, a source variable,\nX, carries information about variable Y if the value\nof X is correlated with the value of Y. Griffiths\ndescribes the causal interpretation of this idea as follows: \n\nThere is a channel between two systems when the state of one is\nsystematically causally related to the other, so that the state of the\nsender can be discovered by observing the state of the receiver. The\ncausal information is simply the state of affairs with which it\nreliably correlates at the other end of the channel. Thus, smoke\ncarries information about fire and disease phenotypes carry\ninformation about disease genes. (Griffiths 2001, p. 397) \n\nTo capture the conventional ideas about genetic information under this\ntheory, genes are treated as source variables and environments are\ntreated as channel conditions. It follows that genes carry information\nabout phenotypes because phenotypic values reliably correlate with\ngenotypic values. But as Griffiths points out, nothing stops one from\ntreating environmental conditions as source variables and genes as\nchannel. Under this application of the causal theory, environmental\nconditions carry information about phenotypes. Griffiths and others\nhave concluded that the idea that genes provide the information while\nother causal factors merely provide material cannot be sustained under\ncausal theories of information. \n\nGriffiths argues that the idea that genes and DNA provide all the\ninformation fares no better under intentional theories of information.\nIntentional theories are aimed at capturing the sense of\n“semantic information” that human thoughts and utterances\nallegedly contain (Godfrey-Smith 1999). The version of intentional\ntheory favored by philosophers of biology is teleosemantic. According\nto teleosemantic theories, a signal represents whatever it was\nselected to represent (in the process of evolution).  Under this idea,\none might say that DNA contains information about development because\nDNA's effects on development were selected for in the process of\nevolution. But as Griffiths and Gray (1997) point out, this idea\napplies to a wide range of entities involved in development, not just\nDNA.  \n\nWeber (2005) challenges Maynard Smith's (2000) teleosemantic\naccount. Maynard Smith draws an analogy between information in a\nprogrammed computer and information in DNA. Computers execute\nalgorithms programmed by human beings and organisms express DNA that\nhas been programmed by natural selection. The information programmed\nin a computer is intentional in that one could determine the\nintentions of the human programmer by analyzing the algorithm. Maynard\nSmith argues that the information programmed in DNA by natural\nselection is intentional in the same sense. Weber offers two arguments\nagainst this view. First, he points out that DNA might contain\nnucleotide sequences that have arisen from chance mutations that\nhappen to be beneficial. If natural selection has not yet operated on\nthem, then Maynard Smith's teleosemantic theory implies they do not\ncontain information. Yet, causally, such a nucleotide sequence would\ninfluence development in the same way as sequences that have been\nselected for. Weber's second criticism of Maynard Smith's account\nstems from a closer examination of the intentionality associated with\ncomputer programs. Weber claims that intentional states associated\nwith computers are actually states of the human engineers who write\nthe programs, not states of the computers themselves: \"A computer\nprogram is a string of symbols that acquires a meaning only in the\ncontext of a community of engineers who understand what the program\ndoes and what it can be used for\" (Weber 2005, p. 252). The analogue\nto human programmers in Maynard Smith's account is natural\nselection. But natural selection does not have intentional\nstates. Hence, Weber concludes, the teleosemantic approach fails to\nsave the idea that DNA contains information in the intentional\nsense. \n\nIt is tempting to think that information talk is impotent in this\ncontext and indeed, some philosophers have argued that such talk is\nmisleading and should be abandoned (e.g., Sarkar 1996,\nWeber 2005, and possibly Rosenberg 2006). But others have taken the\nview that more careful thinking about concepts of information could\nlead to important insights (see next section). \n\nJablonka's aim is to construct a general definition of information\nthat recognizes different types of information associated with\ndifferent ways of acquiring, replicating, and transmitting information\nthrough space and time (Jablonka 2002).  One of her concerns is that\ndiscussions about the meaning (or non-meaning) of information talk in\nbiology are biased by the assumption that the genetic system should\nserve as the prototype for thinking about biological information. She\nbelieves that a general definition of information, one designed to\ncapture the senses of information exemplified in environmental cues,\nman-made instructions, and evolved biological signals, as well as the\nsense of information in hereditary material, will lead to more useful\ngeneralizations and perspectives. \n\nJablonka says that the sense of information in all these situations\ninvolve a source, a receiver system (organism or organism-designed\nsystem), and a special type of reaction of the receiver to the\nsource. She conceives the receiver's reaction as a complex, regulated\nchain of events leading to a response.  Variations in the form of the\nsource lead to variations in response.  That is, the nature of the\nreaction depends on the way the source is organized. In addition, she\npoints out, reactions in these situations are beneficial for the\nreceiver over an appropriate period of time (in the case of organisms,\nover evolutionary time). Jablonka stresses that the benefit, or\nfunction, in the case of organisms should be understood in terms of\nevolution, with the focus on the evolution of the reaction\nsystem, not on the evolution of the source or the evolution of\nthe final outcome of the reaction. \n\nJablonka's concept of information is intentional, and is related to\nthe teleosemantic conceptions discussed above. According to standard\nteleosemantic conceptions, signals have information because the\nproduction of the signal was selected for in evolutionary history.\nAccording to Jablonka's view, however, an entity has information, not\nbecause it was selected for, but because the receiver's response to it\nwas selected for.  Whether something counts as information depends on\nwhether entities respond to it in a (proper) functional way. \n\nJablonka summarizes her general account in the following\ndefinition: \n\nA source — an entity or process — can be said to have\ninformation when a receiver system reacts to this source in a special\nway. The reaction of the receiver to the source has to be such that\nthe reaction can actually or potentially change the state of the\nreceiver in a (usually) functional manner. Moreover, there must be a\nconsistent relation between variations in the form of the source and\nthe corresponding changes in the receiver. (Jablonka 2002, p. 582) \n\nJablonka points out that according to this definition, genes do not\nhave a theoretically privileged status; they are one among many sources\nof information. In addition, she insists the focus should be on the\n“interpretive system of the receiver of the\ninformation”, not on the source. \n\nJablonka argues that the information in DNA has little in common with\nthe information in an alarm call, a cloudy sky, or a chemical signal\nin a bacterial colony. In the latter cases, the receivers'\nreactions (or “responses”) to the source are adaptive for\nthe receiver: “an alarm warns the bird there are predators\naround; the cloudy sky alerts the ape to the coming storm; the\nchemical alerts the bacteria to imminent starvation.”\n(p. 585). But in the case of DNA, the receiver does not seem to react\nin a way that adapts the cell to anything in particular.\n“Rather, DNA is simply ‘read’ by the cell, so it is\nnot information in the same sense … DNA is information\n‘about’ the cell or the organism, rather than\n‘for’ the cell or the organism.” (Jablonka 2002,\np. 585).  Nevertheless, Jablonka claims that her concept applies to\ngenes even if it doesn't apply to DNA in general: \n\nHowever, if instead of thinking about DNA in general we think about\na particular locus with a particular allele, it is not difficult to\nthink about the functional role of this particular allele in a\nparticular set of environmental circumstances. Hence we can say for\nall types of information, including alarm calls and pieces of\nDNA, a source S (allele, alarm call, cloudy sky, etc.) carries\ninformation about a state E for a receiver R (an\norganism or an organism-designed product), if the receiver has an\ninterpretation system that reacts to S in a way that usually\nends up adapting R (or its designer, if R is humanly\ndesigned) to E. (Jablonka 2002, p. 585, my stress) \n\nGiven that Jablonka says that DNA in general is not information in the\nsame sense as the alarm call and cloudy sky (and that this is the\nsense specified in the statement above), it is puzzling why she claims\nthat the statement quoted above applies to “all types of\ninformation.” Furthermore, her claim that the statement above\napplies to particular alleles (and apparently not to DNA in general)\nis not straightforward. Jablonka's orignal account provides an\nilluminating way to think about information in biological processes\nsuch as cellular signaling processes. But her account does not\nsubstantiate the idea that genes and DNA contain information or help\nelucidate the role of genes and DNA.   \n Another approach to elucidating the role of genes and DNA is to\nreplace loose information talk with concrete causal descriptions\ngrounded in an explicit understanding of causation (Waters 2000, and forthcoming). This approach is\npremised on the idea that the basic theory and\nlaboratory methods associated with molecular genetics can be\nunderstood in purely causal terms. The basic\ntheory and methodology concerns the syntheses of DNA, RNA, and\npolypeptide molecules, not the alleged role of DNA in \"programming\" or\n\"directing\" development (section 2.3). The causal role of molecular\ngenes in the syntheses of these molecules can be understood in terms\nof causally specific actual difference making. This involves two\ncausal concepts, actual difference making and causal\nspecificity. These concepts can be explicated in terms of the\n manipulability account of causation\n . \n The concept of actual difference making applies in the context of an\nactual population containing entities that actually differ with\nrespect to some property. In such a population, there might be many\npotential difference makers. That is, there may be many\nfactors that could be manipulated to alter the relevant property of\nthe entities in the population. But the actual difference\nmakers are (roughly speaking) the potential difference makers that\nactual differ, and whose actual differences bring about the actual\ndifferences in the property in the population. \n The concept of actual difference making can be illustrated with the\ndifference principle of classical genetics (section 2.1). According to\nthis principle, genes can be difference makers with respect to\nphenotypic differences in particular genetic and environmental\ncontexts. So, it identifies potential difference makers. When this\nprinciple is used to explain an actual hereditary pattern, it is\napplied to genes that actually differed in the population exhibiting\nthe pattern (often an experimental population). In such cases, an\nactual difference in the gene among the organisms in the population\ncaused the actual phenotypic differences in that population (see\nGifford 1990). That is, the gene was the actual\ndifference maker, not just a potential difference maker (in that\npopulation).  \n The concept of actual difference making can be applied to molecular\ngenetics as follows. In an actual cell, where a population of\nunprocessed RNA molecules differ with respect to linear sequence, the\nquestion arises: what causes these differences?  The answer is that\ndifferences in genes in the cell cause the actual differences in the\nlinear sequences in the unprocessed RNA molecules, and also in\npopulations of RNA molecules and polypeptides. Genes are not the only\nactual difference makers of the actual differences in the linear\nsequences of these molecules. And this brings us to the second causal\nconcept, causal specificity.  \n Causal specificity has been analyzed by Lewis (2000). The basic idea\nis that a causal relationship between two properties is specific when\nmany different values in a causal property bring about many different\nand specifically different values of a resultant variable (the causal\nrelationships instantiate something like a mathematical function).  An\non/off switch is not specific in this technical sense because the\ncausal property has only two values (on and off). A dimmer switch is\ncausally specific in this sense. Genes can be specific difference\nmakers because many specific differences in the sequences of\nnucleotides in DNA result in specific differences in RNA\nmolecules. This is not the case with many other actual difference\nmakers, such as polymerases, which are more like on/off switches (with\nrespect to differences in linear sequences). Biologists have\ndiscovered, however, the existence of other actual difference makers,\nbesides genes and DNA, that are causally specific with respect to the\nlinear sequences of processed RNA and polypeptides, to some degree at\nleast. For example, in some cells splicing complexes called\nsplicosomes actually differ in multiple ways that result in multiple,\nspecific differences in the linear sequences of processed RNA\nmolecules.  \n The fact that all kinds of entities are causally relevant to the\nsynthesis of RNA might lead one to think there is causal parity among\nthe causal elements. But this account shows that genes and DNA play a\ndistinctive causal role in that genes are the causally specific actual\ndifference makers of difference in the linear sequences of unprocessed\nRNA molecules. This distinctive role extends (with important\nqualifications) to the linear sequences of processed RNA molecules and\npolypeptides. The basic theory associated with molecular genetics, as\ndistinguished from the fundamental theory, can be elucidated in causal\nterms. \n Weber (2005) and Rosenberg (2006) independently claim that DNA\ncontains a genetic program that is executed in development, but both\ndeny that this idea depends on the notion that DNA contains semantic\nor intentional information. They illustrate this point by reviewing\nthe current explanation of the first stages of anterior-posterior\npattern formation in Drosophila embryos. This explanation\naccounts for how a single-celled embryo with an intracellular gradient\nof bicoid protein (the concentration of bicoid decreases from the\nanterior to posterior end) develops into a multicellular embryo with\n14 parasegments (the first three parasegments later form the head, the\nnext three will form the thorax, and the remaining segments will form\nabdominal segments). Weber begins by explaining that the bicoid\ngradient is \"generated by the synthesis of protein from an mRNA\nspecies that is derived from the mother (by transcription of maternal\ngenes) and is deposited in the egg cell at the anterior end by\nmaternal nurse cells.\" (Weber 2005, p. 244). He continues by\nexplaining how the biocoid protein differentially activates a set of\nsix gap genes, which in turn differentially activate and\ndeactive eight pair-rule genes, which differentially activate\nand deactivate segment polarity genes and homeotic\nselector genes. \n The details of the cascades of gene activations and deactivations\nhave been investigated experimentally. Weber's and Rosenberg's\nsummaries of the results indicate that biologists can explain initial\npattern formation in terms of successive concentration gradients that\nregulate genes without essential appeal to information concepts. Weber\nbrings this point home by arguing in detail that the use of the term\n‘positional information’ is metaphorical and that the\naction of the bicoid gradient can be explained without the concept of\ninformation. He concludes that this gradient and others do not carry\ninformation in an intentional sense; rather, they play causal roles in\nthe formation of new gradients through the regulation of genes. \n Rosenberg discusses problems confronting the idea that DNA contains a\ngenetic program for development. He starts with the question of\nwhether the account of the early stages of pattern development, which\nhe and Weber summarize (separately), can be elaborated to give the\n\"whole story of development\" (Rosenberg 2006, p.75). Will the whole\nstory be macromolecular? He also points out that the explanation of\npattern formation he describes is couched in terms of genes. He asks:\nwill this explanation survive if the gene concept does not? But in the\nend, he expresses optimism in the grand idea that the explanation of\ninitial pattern development can be elaborated to account for the\nentire process of development. \n Although both Rosenberg and Weber reject the idea that biologists'\nexplanation of the intitial stage of pattern formation makes essential\nreference to the idea that genes or DNA have intentional information,\nthey assume that the explanation makes essential reference or implies\nthe existence of a genetic program. But it is unclear why the use of\nthe term program is any less metaphorical than the term\npositional information. Rosenberg argues that we can infer\nthat DNA can execute programs from the fact that computers can be\nbuilt out of DNA and these DNA-based computers can execute programs in\nthe same sense that silicon-chip-based computers can execute\nprograms. Nevertheless, it is unclear what adding the phrase\n\"executing a genetic program\" adds to the explanation of intial\npattern formation. Weber and Rosenberg present their summaries of the\nexplanation in causal terms such as ‘generate’,\n‘deposit’, ‘activate’, and\n‘deactive’. One might ask whether the causal explanation\nsupersedes the metaphorical idea that DNA programs development. \n\nAccounts such as the ones presented above, if successful, provide a\nbetter basis for understanding the basic theory associated\nwith molecular genetics, but it is not clear that they can elucidate\nthe idea that genes are \"fundamental\" entities that \"program\" the\ndevelopment and functioning of organisms by \"directing\" the syntheses\nof proteins that in turn regulate all the important cellular\nprocesses. In fact, there is considerable skepticism in the\nphilosophical community about this fundamental theory. A common\ncriticism (among philosophers) is that it is gene-centered. \n\nSeveral philosophers have set out to replace the fundamental theory\nassociated with molecular genetics with a new fundamental theory that\ndoes not \"privilege\" the gene. Among the proposals is Robert's\n(2004). Drawing upon the writings of Burian, Griffiths, Keller, Oyama,\nMoss, and others, Robert tries to construct a new “framework for\nunderstanding and explaining organismal development” (p. 78)\nthat does not reduce “the problem of development” to the\nproblem of gene action and gene activation. He seeks a framework that\nis free from the alleged assumption that development involves the\nexpression of “preformed genetic information” (p.\n56). Robert says that his framework focuses on organisms rather than\ngenes and that it “takes seriously” the dynamical\ncomplexities of development emphasized by Keller. \n\nPhilosophers engaged in fundamental theorizing have not, at least yet,\nattracted much attention from practicing scientists. Perhaps the lack\nof attention is due to a difference between the concerns of (many)\nphilosophers of biology and the needs of practicing\nbiologists. Wagner, a theoretical biologist who has conducted\nmathematical/conceptual work in evolutionary theory as well as\nempirical research on the evolution of morphological characters, makes\nthe following observation in a review of Robert's book, \n\nRobert and his colleagues who argue for a similar interpretation are\ncorrect in that the genes alone cannot make an organism and instead are\nembedded in a large network of causal interactions. But scientists are\nusually not interested in general statements about what in principle is\nrequired to understand a phenomenon.  \n\nYes, scientists make pragmatic decision about what to study, but I\nthink that these decisions are anything but arbitrary. The power of\nmolecular genetic approaches did not come easily, rather it is the\nresult of a long history of strenuous research based on a vision that\nderived from the work of Richard Goldschmidt, Alfred\nKühn, and Thomas Hunt Morgan early in the 20th Century.\nIt is thus not intellectual laziness that drives the genetic research\nprogram; instead we are raking in the spoils of a hard-won victory over\nbiological complexity. (Wagner 2004, p. 1405) \n\nThe discrepancy between (many) philosophers' interest in\nfundamental theorizing and practicing biologists' need to make\npragmatic decisions about what to study raises an important question\nabout gene-centered sciences that has been largely overlooked by\nphilosophers: why is so much biological research centered on genes and\nDNA? \n\nIn official and public contexts, scientists appeal to the fundamental\ntheory associated with molecular genetics to justify centering\nresearch on genes and DNA (e.g., see the websites of funding agencies\nsuch as National Center for Biotechnology Information). Genes are\ntypically referred to as “the fundamental units” that are\nresponsible for guiding all basic life processes. Usually a\ncombination of causal and information metaphors are invoked to explain\nthe role of genes. Genes are said to produce RNA and polypeptides, to\nprovide instructions, or direct processes. But philosophical\ninvestigation has shown that these kind of sweeping claims cannot\nwithstand careful scrutiny. Why, then, is so much research centered on\ngenes and DNA? One answer to this question is that biologists are\nblinded by an ideology of genetic determinism. But Wagner's defense of\ngene centrism suggests another answer, an answer that resonates with\nKeller's explanation (2000) of why gene talk is useful. \n\nIt has been proposed that the real reason biologists center attention\non genes and DNA is that genes are difference makers that can be used\nto trace and manipulate a broad range of biological processes (Waters\n2004a and 2006). This scientific practice makes sense independently of\nany fundamental theory associated with molecular genetics. In the case\nof molecular genetics, it is investigative pragmatics, not fundamental\ntheorizing, that drives scientific research. The basic theory suffices\nto explain the investigative utility and results of gene-centered\napproaches. The fundamental theory is, in an important sense,\nepiphenomenal with respect to the design and implementation of\ngene-centered research. On this view, the role of the fundamental\ntheory should be understood in Latourian terms (1987, 1988), as a\nplatform for rallying the troops and bringing resources to research\nendeavors.  The design of the laboratory experiments and the reason\nwhy the experiments work, can be explained in terms of broad\ninvestigative strategies, the basic causal theory of molecular\ngenetics, and the details of the experimental contexts. \n\nThe philosophy of molecular genetics is a lively area of research that\nreflects much of the excitement and diversity in contemporary\nphilosophy of science. Philosophers examining the related areas of\ngenetics have different philosophical interests and adopt contrasting\napproaches. Some philosophical research is aimed at setting science\nstraight while other research is aimed at correcting our understanding\nof science. Some philosophers employ traditional methods of philosophy\nof science, for example the analyses of concepts and models, while\nothers are pioneering new philosophical approaches by drawing upon\nmethods from social science including survey studies. While some\nphilosophers focus their attention on fundamental theorizing, others\nare investigating the dynamics of empirical investigation. Research in\nthe philosophy of molecular genetics is also generating new ideas\nabout basic concepts of general philosophical interest including\nreductionism, information, and causation.","contact.mail":"ckwaters@ucalgary.ca","contact.domain":"ucalgary.ca"}]
