Yet he also made major discoveries in optics beginning in the\nmid-1660s and reaching across four decades; and during the course of\nhis 60 years of intense intellectual activity he put no less effort\ninto chemical and alchemical research and into theology and biblical\nstudies than he put into mathematics and physics. He became a dominant\nfigure in Britain almost immediately following publication of his\nPrincipia in 1687, with the consequence that\n“Newtonianism” of one form or another had become firmly\nrooted there within the first decade of the eighteenth century. His\ninfluence on the continent, however, was delayed by the strong\nopposition to his theory of gravity expressed by such leading figures\nas Christiaan Huygens and Leibniz, both of whom saw the theory as\ninvoking an occult power of action at a distance in the absence of\nNewton's having proposed a contact mechanism by means of which forces\nof gravity could act. As the promise of the theory of gravity became\nincreasingly substantiated, starting in the late 1730s but especially\nduring the 1740s and 1750s, Newton became an equally dominant figure\non the continent, and “Newtonianism,” though perhaps in\nmore guarded forms, flourished there as well. What physics textbooks\nnow refer to as “Newtonian mechanics” and “Newtonian\nscience” consists mostly of results achieved on the continent\nbetween 1740 and 1800.\n\n\n\nNewton's life naturally divides into four parts: the years before he\nentered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1661; his years in Cambridge\nbefore the Principia was published in 1687; a period of almost\na decade immediately following this publication, marked by the renown\nit brought him and his increasing disenchantment with Cambridge; and\nhis final three decades in London, for most of which he was Master of\nthe Mint. While he remained intellectually active during his\nyears in London, his legendary advances date almost entirely from his\nyears in Cambridge. Nevertheless, save for his optical papers of\nthe early 1670s and the first edition of the Principia, all\nhis works published before he died fell within his years in\n London.[1] \n\nNewton was born into a Puritan family in Woolsthorpe, a small village\nin Linconshire near Grantham, on 25 December 1642 (old calendar), a few\ndays short of one year after Galileo died. Isaac's father, a\nfarmer, died two months before Isaac was born. When his mother\nHannah married the 63 year old Barnabas Smith three years later and\nmoved to her new husband's residence, Isaac was left behind with his\nmaternal grandparents. (Isaac learned to read and write from his\nmaternal grandmother and mother, both of whom, unlike his father, were\nliterate.) Hannah returned to Woolsthorpe with three new children in\n1653, after Smith died. Two years later Isaac went to boarding\nschool in Grantham, returning full time to manage the farm, not very\nsuccessfully, in 1659. Hannah's brother, who had received an M.A.\nfrom Cambridge, and the headmaster of the Grantham school then\npersuaded his mother that Isaac should prepare for the\nuniversity. After further schooling at Grantham, he entered\nTrinity College in 1661, somewhat older than most of his\nclassmates. \n\nThese years of Newton's youth were the most turbulent in the history of\nEngland. The English Civil War had begun in 1642, King Charles\nwas beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell ruled as lord protector from 1653\nuntil he died in 1658, followed by his son Richard from 1658 to 1659,\nleading to the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in\n1660. How much the political turmoil of these years affected\nNewton and his family is unclear, but the effect on Cambridge and other\nuniversities was substantial, if only through unshackling them for a\nperiod from the control of the Anglican Catholic Church. The\nreturn of this control with the restoration was a key factor inducing\nsuch figures as Robert Boyle to turn to Charles II for support for what\nin 1660 emerged as the Royal Society of London. The intellectual\nworld of England at the time Newton matriculated to Cambridge was thus\nvery different from what it was when he was born. \n\nNewton's initial education at Cambridge was classical, focusing\n(primarily through secondary sources) on Aristotlean rhetoric, logic,\nethics, and physics. By 1664, Newton had begun reaching beyond the\nstandard curriculum, reading, for example, the 1656 Latin edition of\nDescartes's Opera philosophica, which included the\nMeditations, Discourse on Method, the\nDioptrics, and the Principles of Philosophy. By\nearly 1664 he had also begun teaching himself mathematics, taking\nnotes on works by Oughtred, Viète, Wallis, and Descartes\n— the latter via van Schooten's Latin translation, with\ncommentary, of the Géométrie. Newton spent all\nbut three months from the summer of 1665 until the spring of 1667 at\nhome in Woolsthorpe when the university was closed because of the\nplague.  This period was his so-called annus\nmirabilis. During it, he made his initial experimental\ndiscoveries in optics and developed (independently of Huygens's\ntreatment of 1659) the mathematical theory of uniform circular motion,\nin the process noting the relationship between the inverse-square and\nKepler's rule relating the square of the planetary periods to the cube\nof their mean distance from the Sun. Even more impressively, by late\n1666 he had become de facto the leading mathematician in the\nworld, having extended his earlier examination of cutting-edge\nproblems into the discovery of the calculus, as presented in his tract\nof October 1666. He returned to Trinity as a Fellow in 1667, where he\ncontinued his research in optics, constructing his first reflecting\ntelescope in 1669, and wrote a more extended tract on the calculus\n“De Analysi per Æquations Numero Terminorum\nInfinitas” incorporating new work on infinite series. On the\nbasis of this tract Isaac Barrow recommended Newton as his replacement\nas Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, a position he assumed in October\n1669, four and a half years after he had received his Bachelor of\nArts. \n\nOver the course of the next fifteen years as Lucasian Professor Newton\npresented his lectures and carried on research in a variety of\nareas. By 1671 he had completed most of a treatise length account\nof the\n calculus,[2]\nwhich he then found no one would publish. This failure appears to have\ndiverted his interest in mathematics away from the calculus for some\ntime, for the mathematical lectures he registered during this period\nmostly concern algebra. (During the early 1680s he undertook a\ncritical review of classical texts in geometry, a review that reduced\nhis view of the importance of symbolic mathematics.)  His lectures\nfrom 1670 to 1672 concerned optics, with a large range of experiments\npresented in detail. Newton went public with his work in optics in\nearly 1672, submitting material that was read before the Royal Society\nand then published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety. This led to four years of exchanges with various figures\nwho challenged his claims, including both Robert Hooke and Christiaan\nHuygens — exchanges that at times exasperated Newton to the\npoint that he chose to withdraw from further public exchanges in\nnatural philosophy. Before he largely isolated himself in the late\n1670s, however, he had also engaged in a series of sometimes long\nexchanges in the mid 1670s, most notably with John Collins (who had a\ncopy of “De Analysi”) and Leibniz, concerning his work on\nthe calculus. So, though they remained unpublished, Newton's advances\nin mathematics scarcely remained a secret. \n\nThis period as Lucasian Professor also marked the beginning of his more\nprivate researches in alchemy and theology. Newton purchased\nchemical apparatus and treatises in alchemy in 1669, with experiments\nin chemistry extending across this entire period. The issue of\nthe vows Newton might have to take in conjunction with the Lucasian\nProfessorship also appears to have precipitated his study of the\ndoctrine of the Trinity, which opened the way to his questioning the\nvalidity of a good deal more doctrine central to the Roman and Anglican\nChurches. \n\nNewton showed little interest in orbital astronomy during this period\nuntil Hooke initiated a brief correspondence with him in an effort to\nsolicit material for the Royal Society at the end of November 1679,\nshortly after Newton had returned to Cambridge following the death of\nhis mother. Among the several problems Hooke proposed to Newton\nwas the question of the trajectory of a body under an inverse-square\ncentral force: \n\nNewton apparently discovered the systematic relationship between\nconic-section trajectories and inverse-square central forces at the\ntime, but did not communicate it to anyone, and for reasons that\nremain unclear did not follow up this discovery until Halley, during a\nvisit in the summer of 1684, put the same question to him. His\nimmediate answer was, an ellipse; and when he was unable to produce\nthe paper on which he had made this determination, he agreed to\nforward an account to Halley in London. Newton fulfilled this\ncommitment in November by sending Halley a nine-folio-page\nmanuscript, “De Motu Corporum in Gyrum” (“On the\nMotion of Bodies in Orbit”), which was entered into the Register\nof the Royal Society in early December 1684. The body of this tract\nconsists of ten deduced propositions — three theorems and seven\nproblems — all of which, along with their corollaries, recur in\nimportant propositions in the Principia. \n\nSave for a few weeks away from Cambridge, from late 1684 until early\n1687, Newton concentrated on lines of research that expanded the short\nten-proposition tract into the 500 page Principia, with its\n192 derived propositions. Initially the work was to have a two\nbook structure, but Newton subsequently shifted to three books, and\nreplaced the original version of the final book with one more\nmathematically demanding. The manuscript for Book 1 was sent to\nLondon in the spring of 1686, and the manuscripts for Books 2 and 3, in\nMarch and April 1687, respectively. The roughly three hundred\ncopies of the Principia came off the press in the summer of\n1687, thrusting the 44 year old Newton into the forefront of natural\nphilosophy and forever ending his life of comparative isolation. \n\nThe years between the publication of the Principia and\nNewton's permanent move to London in 1696 were marked by his\nincreasing disenchantment with his situation in Cambridge. In January\n1689, following the Glorious Revolution at the end of 1688, he was\nelected to represent Cambridge University in the Convention\nParliament, which he did until January 1690. During this time he\nformed friendships with John Locke and Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, and\nin the summer of 1689 he finally met Christiaan Huygens face to face\nfor two extended discussions. Perhaps because of disappointment with\nHuygens not being convinced by the argument for universal gravity, in\nthe early 1690s Newton initiated a radical rewriting of the\nPrincipia. During these same years he wrote (but withheld)\nhis principal treatise in alchemy, Praxis; he corresponded\nwith Richard Bentley on religion and allowed Locke to read some of his\nwritings on the subject; he once again entered into an effort to put\nhis work on the calculus in a form suitable for publication; and he\ncarried out experiments on diffraction with the intent of completing\nhis Opticks, only to withhold the manuscript from publication\nbecause of dissatisfaction with its treatment of diffraction. The\nradical revision of the Principia became abandoned by 1693,\nduring the middle of which Newton suffered, by his own testimony, what\nin more recent times would be called a nervous breakdown. In the two\nyears following his recovery that autumn, he continued his experiments\nin chymistry and he put substantial effort into trying to refine and\nextend the gravity-based theory of the lunar orbit in the\nPrincipia, but with less success than he had hoped. \n\nThroughout these years Newton showed interest in a position of\nsignificance in London, but again with less success than he had hoped\nuntil he accepted the relatively minor position of Warden of the Mint\nin early 1696, a position he held until he became Master of the Mint at\nthe end of 1699. He again represented Cambridge University in\nParliament for 16 months, beginning in 1701, the year in which he\nresigned his Fellowship at Trinity College and the Lucasian\nProfessorship. He was elected President of the Royal Society in\n1703 and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705. \n\nNewton thus became a figure of imminent authority in London over the\nrest of his life, in face-to-face contact with individuals of power and\nimportance in ways that he had not known in his Cambridge years.\nHis everyday home life changed no less dramatically when his\nextraordinarily vivacious teenage niece, Catherine Barton, the daughter\nof his half-sister Hannah, moved in with him shortly after he moved to\nLondon, staying until she married John Conduitt in 1717, and after that\nremaining in close contact. (It was through her and her husband\nthat Newton's papers came down to posterity.) Catherine was\nsocially prominent among the powerful and celebrated among the literati\nfor the years before she married, and her husband was among the\nwealthiest men of London. \n\nThe London years saw Newton embroiled in some nasty disputes, probably\nmade the worse by the ways in which he took advantage of his position\nof authority in the Royal Society. In the first years of his\nPresidency he became involved in a dispute with John Flamsteed in which\nhe and Halley, long ill-disposed toward the Flamsteed, violated the\ntrust of the Royal Astronomer, turning him into a permanent\nenemy. Ill feelings between Newton and Leibniz had been\ndeveloping below the surface from even before Huygens had died in 1695,\nand they finally came to a head in 1710 when John Keill accused Leibniz\nin the Philosophical Transactions of having plagiarized the\ncalculus from Newton and Leibniz, a Fellow of the Royal Society since\n1673, demanded redress from the Society. The Society's 1712\npublished response was anything but redress. Newton not only was\na dominant figure in this response, but then published an outspoken\nanonymous review of it in 1715 in the Philosophical\nTransactions. Leibniz and his colleagues on the Continent\nhad never been comfortable with the Principia and its\nimplication of action at a distance. With the priority dispute\nthis attitude turned into one of open hostility toward Newton's theory\nof gravity — a hostility that was matched in its blindness by the\nfervor of acceptance of the theory in England. The public\nelements of the priority dispute had the effect of expanding a schism\nbetween Newton and Leibniz into a schism between the English associated\nwith the Royal Society and the group who had been working with Leibniz\non the calculus since the 1690s, including most notably Johann\nBernoulli, and this schism in turn transformed into one between the\nconduct of science and mathematics in England versus the Continent that\npersisted long after Leibniz died in 1716. \n\nAlthough Newton obviously had far less time available to devote to\nsolitary research during his London years than he had had in\nCambridge, he did not entirely cease to be productive. The first\n(English) edition of his Opticks finally appeared in 1704,\nappended to which were two mathematical treatises, his first work on\nthe calculus to appear in print. This edition was followed by a Latin\nedition in 1706 and a second English edition in 1717, each containing\nimportant Queries on key topics in natural philosophy beyond those in\nits predecessor. Other earlier work in mathematics began to appear in\nprint, including a work on algebra, Arithmetica Universalis,\nin 1707 and “De Analysi” and a tract on finite\ndifferences, “Methodis differentialis” in 1711. The second\nedition of the Principia, on which Newton had begun work at\nthe age of 66 in 1709, was published in 1713, with a third edition in\n1726. Though the original plan for a radical restructuring had long\nbeen abandoned, the fact that virtually every page of the\nPrincipia received some modifications in the second edition\nshows how carefully Newton, often prodded by his editor Roger Cotes,\nreconsidered everything in it; and important parts were substantially\nrewritten not only in response to Continental criticisms, but also\nbecause of new data, including data from experiments on resistance\nforces carried out in London.  Focused effort on the third edition\nbegan in 1723, when Newton was 80 years old, and while the revisions\nare far less extensive than in the second edition, it does contain\nsubstantive additions and modfications, and it surely has claim to\nbeing the edition that represents his most considered views. \n\nNewton died on 20 March 1727 at the age of 84. His\ncontemporaries' conception of him nevertheless continued to expand as a\nconsequence of various posthumous publications, including The\nChronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728); the work originally\nintended to be the last book of the Principia, The System\nof the World (1728, in both English and Latin); Observations\nupon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John\n(1733); A Treatise of the Method of Fluxions and Infinite\nSeries (1737); A Dissertation upon the Sacred Cubit of the\nJews (1737), and Four Letters from Sir Isaac Newton to Doctor\nBentley concerning Some Arguments in Proof of a Deity\n(1756). Even then, however, the works that had been published\nrepresented only a limited fraction of the total body of papers that\nhad been left in the hands of Catherine and John Conduitt. The\nfive volume collection of Newton's works edited by Samuel Horsley\n(1779–85) did not alter this situation. Through the marriage of\nthe Conduitts' daughter Catherine and subsequent inheritance, this body\nof papers came into the possession of Lord Portsmouth, who agreed in\n1872 to allow it to be reviewed by scholars at Cambridge University\n(John Couch Adams, George Stokes, H. R. Luard, and G. D.\nLiveing). They issued a catalogue in 1888, and the university\nthen retained all the papers of a scientific character. With the\nnotable exception of W. W. Rouse Ball, little work was done on the\nscientific papers before World War II. The remaining papers were\nreturned to Lord Portsmouth, and then ultimately sold at auction in\n1936 to various parties. Serious scholarly work on them did not\nget underway until the 1970s, and much remains to be done on them. \n\nThree factors stand in the way of giving an account of Newton's work\nand influence. First is the contrast between the public Newton,\nconsisting of publications in his lifetime and in the decade or two\nfollowing his death, and the private Newton, consisting of his\nunpublished work in math and physics, his efforts in chymistry —\nthat is, the 17th century blend of alchemy and chemistry — and\nhis writings in radical theology — material that has become\npublic mostly since World War II. Only the public Newton influenced\nthe eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, yet any account of\nNewton himself confined to this material can at best be only\nfragmentary. Second is the contrast, often shocking, between the\nactual content of Newton's public writings and the positions\nattributed to him by others, including most importantly his\npopularizers.  The term “Newtonian” refers to several\ndifferent intellectual strands unfolding in the eighteenth century,\nsome of them tied more closely to Voltaire, Pemberton, and Maclaurin\n— or for that matter to those who saw themselves as extending\nhis work, such as Clairaut, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace\n— than to Newton himself.  Third is the contrast between the\nenormous range of subjects to which Newton devoted his full\nconcentration at one time or another during the 60 years of his\nintellectual career — mathematics, optics, mechanics, astronomy,\nexperimental chemistry, alchemy, and theology — and the\nremarkably little information we have about what drove him or his\nsense of himself. Biographers and analysts who try to piece together a\nunified picture of Newton and his intellectual endeavors often end up\ntelling us almost as much about themselves as about Newton. \n\nCompounding the diversity of the subjects to which Newton devoted time\nare sharp contrasts in his work within each subject. Optics and\norbital mechanics both fall under what we now call physics, and even\nthen they were seen as tied to one another, as indicated by Descartes'\nfirst work on the subject, Le Monde, ou Traité de la\nlumierè. Nevertheless, two very different\n“Newtonian” traditions in physics arose from Newton's\nOpticks and Principia: from his Opticks a\ntradition centered on meticulous experimentation and from his\nPrincipia a tradition centered on mathematical theory. The\nmost important element common to these two was Newton's deep\ncommitment to having the empirical world serve not only as the\nultimate arbiter, but also as the sole basis for adopting provisional\ntheory. Throughout all of this work he displayed distrust of what was\nthen known as the method of hypotheses – putting forward\nhypotheses that reach beyond all known phenomena and then testing them\nby deducing observable conclusions from them. Newton insisted instead\non having specific phenomena decide each element of theory, with the\ngoal of limiting the provisional aspect of theory as much as possible\nto the step of inductively generalizing from the specific\nphenomena. This stance is perhaps best summarized in his fourth Rule\nof Reasoning, added in the third edition of the Principia,\nbut adopted as early as his Optical Lectures of the 1670s: \n\nIn experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena\nby induction should be taken to be either exactly or very nearly true\nnotwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena make\nsuch propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions. \n\n This rule should be followed so that arguments based on\ninduction may not be nullified by hypotheses. \n\nSuch a commitment to empirically driven science was a hallmark of\nthe Royal Society from its very beginnings, and one can find it in the\nresearch of Kepler, Galileo, Huygens, and in the experimental efforts\nof the Royal Academy of Paris. Newton, however, carried this\ncommitment further first by eschewing the method of hypotheses and\nsecond by displaying in his Principia and Opticks how\nrich a set of theoretical results can be secured through well-designed\nexperiments and mathematical theory designed to allow inferences from\nphenomena. The success of those after him in building on these\ntheoretical results completed the process of transforming natural\nphilosophy into modern empirical science. \n\nNewton's commitment to having phenomena decide the elements of\ntheory required questions to be left open when no available phenomena\ncould decide them. Newton contrasted himself most strongly with\nLeibniz in this regard at the end of his anonymous review of the Royal\nSociety's report on the priority dispute over the calculus: \n\nNewton could have said much the same about the question of what\nlight consists of, waves or particles, for while he felt that the latter\nwas far more probable, he saw it still not decided by any experiment or\nphenomenon in his lifetime. Leaving questions about the ultimate\ncause of gravity and the constitution of light open was the other\nfactor in his work driving a wedge between natural philosophy and\nempirical science. \n\nThe many other areas of Newton's intellectual endeavors made less of a\ndifference to eighteenth century philosophy and science. In\nmathematics, Newton was the first to develop a full range of\nalgorithms for symbolically determining what we now call integrals and\nderivatives, but he subsequently became fundamentally opposed to the\nidea, championed by Leibniz, of transforming mathematics into a\ndiscipline grounded in symbol manipulation. Newton thought the only\nway of rendering limits rigorous lay in extending geometry to\nincorporate them, a view that went entirely against the tide in the\ndevelopment of mathematics in the eighteenth and nineteenth\nceturies. In chemistry Newton conducted a vast array of experiments,\nbut the experimental tradition coming out of his Opticks, and\nnot his experiments in chemistry, lay behind Lavoisier calling himself\na Newtonian; indeed, one must wonder whether Lavoisier would even have\nassociated his new form of chemistry with Newton had he been aware of\nNewton's fascination with writings in the alchemical tradition. And\neven in theology, there is Newton the anti-Trinitarian mild heretic\nwho was not that much more radical in his departures from Roman and\nAnglican Christianity than many others at the time, and Newton, the\nwild religious zealot predicting the end of the Earth, who did not\nemerge to public view until quite recently. \n\nThere is surprisingly little cross-referencing of themes from one area\nof Newton's endeavors to another. The common element across almost all\nof them is that of a problem-solver extraordinaire, taking on\none problem at a time and staying with it until he had found, usually\nrather promptly, a solution. All of his technical writings display\nthis, but so too does his unpublished manuscript reconstructing\nSolomon's Temple from the biblical account of it and his posthumously\npublished Chronology of the Ancient Kingdoms in which he\nattempted to infer from astronomical phenomena the dating of major\nevents in the Old Testament. The Newton one encounters in his writings\nseems to compartmentalize his interests at any given moment. Whether\nhe had a unified conception of what he was up to in all his\nintellectual efforts, and if so what this conception might be, has\nbeen a continuing source of controversy among Newton scholars. \n\nOf course, were it not for the Principia, there would be no\nentry at all for Newton in an Encyclopedia of Philosophy. In science,\nhe would have been known only for the contributions he made to optics,\nwhich, while notable, were no more so than those made by Huygens and\nGrimaldi, neither of whom had much impact on philosophy; and in\nmathematics, his failure to publish would have relegated his work\nto not much more than a footnote to the achievements of Leibniz and\nhis school. Regardless of which aspect of Newton's endeavors\n“Newtonian” might be applied to, the word gained its aura\nfrom the Principia. But this adds still a further\ncomplication, for the Principia itself was substantially\ndifferent things to different people. The press-run of the first\nedition (estimated to be around 300) was too small for it to have been\nread by all that many individuals. The second edition also appeared in\ntwo pirated Amsterdam editions, and hence was much more widely\navailable, as was the third edition and its English (and later\nFrench) translation. The Principia, however, is not an easy\nbook to read, so one must still ask, even of those who had access to\nit, whether they read all or only portions of the book and to what\nextent they grasped the full complexity of what they read.  The\ndetailed commentary provided in the three volume Jesuit edition\n(1739–42) made the work less daunting. But even then the vast majority\nof those invoking the word “Newtonian” were unlikely to\nhave been much more conversant with the Principia itself than\nthose in the first half of the 20th century who invoked\n‘relativity’ were likely to have read Einstein's two\nspecial relativity papers of 1905 or his general relativity paper of\n1916. An important question to ask of any philosophers commenting on\nNewton is, what primary sources had they read? \n\nThe 1740s witnessed a major transformation in the standing of the\nscience in the Principia. The Principia itself\nhad left a number of loose-ends, most of them detectable by only highly\ndiscerning readers. By 1730, however, some of these loose-ends\nhad been cited in Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's elogium\nfor\n Newton[4] and in\nJohn Machin's appendix to the 1729 English translation of the\nPrincipia, raising questions about just how secure Newton's\ntheory of gravity was, empirically. The shift on the continent began\nin the 1730s when Maupertuis convinced the Royal Academy to conduct\nexpeditions to Lapland and Peru to determine whether Newton's claims\nabout the non-spherical shape of the Earth and the variation of\nsurface gravity with latitude are correct.  Several of the loose-ends\nwere successfully resolved during the 1740's through such notable\nadvances beyond the Principia as Clairaut's\nThéorie de la Figure de la Terre; the return of the\nexpedition from Peru; d'Alembert's 1749 rigid-body solution for the\nwobble of the Earth that produces the precession of the equinoxes;\nClairaut's 1749 resolution of the factor of 2 discrepancy between\ntheory and observation in the mean motion of the lunar apogee, glossed\nover by Newton but emphasized by Machin; and the prize-winning first\never successful description of the motion of the Moon by Tobias Mayer\nin 1753, based on a theory of this motion derived from gravity by\nEuler in the early 1750s taking advantage of Clairaut's solution for\nthe mean motion of the apogee. \n\nEuler was the central figure in turning the three laws of motion put\nforward by Newton in the Principia into Newtonian\nmechanics. These three laws, as Newton formulated them, apply to\n“point-masses,” a term Euler had put forward in his\nMechanica of 1736. Most of the effort of eighteenth century\nmechanics was devoted to solving problems of the motion of rigid\nbodies, elastic strings and bodies, and fluids, all of which require\nprinciples beyond Newton's three laws. From the 1740s on this led to\nalternative approaches to formulating a general mechanics, employing\nsuch different principles as the conservation of vis viva,\nthe principle of least action, and d'Alembert's principle. The\n“Newtonian” formulation of a general mechanics sprang from\nEuler's proposal in 1750 that Newton's second law, in an F=ma\nformulation that appears nowhere in the Principia, could be\napplied locally within bodies and fluids to yield differential\nequations for the motions of bodies, elastic and rigid, and\nfluids. During the 1750s Euler developed his equations for the motion\nof fluids, and in the 1760s, his equations of rigid-body\nmotion. What we call Newtonian mechanics was accordingly something for\nwhich Euler was more responsible than Newton. \n\nAlthough some loose-ends continued to defy resolution until much later\nin the eighteenth century, by the early 1750s Newton's theory of\ngravity had become the accepted basis for ongoing research among\nalmost everyone working in orbital astronomy. Clairaut's successful\nprediction of the month of return of Halley's comet at the end of this\ndecade made a larger segment of the educated public aware of the\nextent to which empirical grounds for doubting Newton's theory of\ngravity had largely disappeared. Even so, one must still ask of anyone\noutside active research in gravitational astronomy just how aware they\nwere of the developments from ongoing efforts when they made their\nvarious pronouncements about the standing of the science of the\nPrincipia among the community of researchers. The naivety of\nthese pronouncements cuts both ways: on the one hand, they often\nreflected a bloated view of how secure Newton's theory was at the\ntime, and, on the other, they often underestimated how strong the\nevidence favoring it had become. The upshot is a need to be attentive\nto the question of what anyone, even including Newton himself, had in\nmind when they spoke of the science of the Principia. \n\nTo view the seventy years of research after Newton died as merely tying\nup the loose-ends of the Principia or as simply compiling more\nevidence for his theory of gravity is to miss the whole point.\nResearch predicated on Newton's theory had answered a huge number\nof questions about the world dating from long before it. The\nmotion of the Moon and the trajectories of comets were two early\nexamples, both of which answered such questions as how one comet\ndiffers from another and what details make the Moon's motion so\nmuch more complicated than that of the satellites of Jupiter and\nSaturn. In the 1770s Laplace had developed a proper theory of the\ntides, reaching far beyond the suggestions Newton had made in the\nPrincipia by including the effects of the Earth's\nrotation and the non-radial components of the gravitational forces of\nthe Sun and Moon, components that dominate the radial component that\nNewton had singled out. In 1786 Laplace identified a large 900\nyear fluctuation in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn arising from\nquite subtle features of their respective orbits. With this\ndiscovery, calculation of the motion of the planets from the theory of\ngravity became the basis for predicting planet positions, with\nobservation serving primarily to identify further forces not yet taken\ninto consideration in the calculation. These advances in our\nunderstanding of planetary motion led Laplace to produce the four\nprincipal volumes of his Traité de mécanique\ncéleste from 1799 to 1805, a work collecting in one place\nall the theoretical and empirical results of the research predicated on\nNewton's Principia. From that time forward,\nNewtonian science sprang from Laplace's work, not\nNewton's. \n\nThe success of the research in celestial mechanics predicated on the\nPrincipia was unprecedented. Nothing of comparable scope\nand accuracy had ever occurred before in empirical research of any\nkind. That led to a new philosophical question: what was it about\nthe science of the Principia that enabled it to achieve what\nit did? Philosophers like Locke and Berkeley began asking this\nquestion while Newton was still alive, but it gained increasing force\nas successes piled on one another over the decades after he died.\nThis question had a practical side, as those working in other fields\nlike chemistry pursued comparable success, and others like Hume and\nAdam Smith aimed for a science of human affairs. It had, of\ncourse, a philosophical side, giving rise to the subdiscipline of\nphilosophy of science, starting with Kant and continuing throughout the\nnineteenth century as other areas of physical science began showing\nsimilar signs of success. The Einsteinian revolution in the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, in which Newtonian theory was shown\nto hold only as a limiting case of the special and general theories of\nrelativity, added a further twist to the question, for now all the\nsuccesses of Newtonian science, which still remain in place, have to be\nseen as predicated on a theory that holds only to high approximation in\nparochial circumstances. \n\nThe extraordinary character of the Principia gave rise\nto a still continuing tendency to place great weight on everything\nNewton said. This, however, was, and still is, easy to carry to\nexcess. One need look no further than Book 2 of the\nPrincipia to see that Newton had no more claim to being\nsomehow in tune with nature and the truth than any number of his\ncontemporaries. Newton's manuscripts do reveal an exceptional\nlevel of attention to detail of phrasing, from which we can rightly\nconclude that his pronouncements, especially in print, were\ngenerally backed by careful, self-critical reflection.\nBut this conclusion does not automatically extend to every statement he\never made. We must constantly be mindful of the possibility of\ntoo much weight being placed, then or now, on any pronouncement that\nstands in relative isolation over his 60 year career; and, to counter\nthe tendency to excess, we should be even more vigilant than usual in\nnot losing sight of the context, circumstantial as well as historical\nand textual, of both Newton's statements and the eighteenth century\nreaction to\nthem.","contact.mail":"george.smith@tufts.edu","contact.domain":"tufts.edu"}]
