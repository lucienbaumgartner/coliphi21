Such a deity is generally thought to be\n“transcendent” meaning beyond human experience, and\nconstantly involved (‘immanent’) in the creation, ready to\nintervene as necessary, and without whose constant concern the\ncreation would cease or disappear. Christians, Jews, and Muslims are\nall Creationists in this sense. Generally they are known as\n‘theists,’ distinguishing them from ‘deists,’\nthat is people who believe that there is a designer who might or might\nnot have created the material on which he (or she or it) is working\nand who does not interfere once the designing act is finishing. The\nfocus of this discussion is on a narrower sense of Creationism, the\nsense that one usually finds in popular writings (especially in\nAmerica today, but expanding world-wide rapidly). Here, Creationism\nmeans the taking of the Bible, particularly the early chapters of\nGenesis, as literally true guides to the history of the universe and\nto the history of life, including us humans, down here on earth\n(Numbers 1992). \n\n\nCreationism in this more restricted sense entails a number of beliefs.\nThese include, first, that a short time has elapsed since the\nbeginning of everything. ‘Young Earth Creationists’ think\nthat Archbishop Ussher’s seventeenth-century calculation of\nabout 6000 years is a good estimate. Second, that there are six days\nof creation – there is debate on the meaning of\n‘day’ in this context, with some insisting on a literal\ntwenty-four hours, and others more flexible. Third, that there was a\nmiraculous creation of all life including Homo sapiens\n— with scope for debate about whether Adam and Eve came together\nor if Eve came afterwards to keep Adam company. Fourth, that there was\na world-wide flood some time after the initial creation, through which\nonly a limited number of humans and animals survived. Fifth, that\nthere were other events such as the Tower of Babel and the turning of\nLot’s wife into a pillar of salt. Creationists (in this narrow\nsense) have variously been known as Fundamentalists or biblical\nliteralists, and sometimes – especially when they are pushing\nthe scientific grounds for their beliefs – as Scientific\nCreationists. Today’s Creationists are often marked by\nenthusiasm for something that is known as Intelligent Design. Because\nthe relationship between Creationism in the sense of literalism and\nIntelligent Design is somewhat complex, examination of this\nrelationship will be left until later and, until stated otherwise, the\nfollowing discussion focusses on literalists. (Because\n‘literalist’ is the common term, we continue to use it.\nMore accurately, such people are better known as\n‘inerrantists,’ implying that the stress is less on the\nactual words and more on the interpretation, especially given the\nextent to which they interpret the Bible, especially when it comes to\nprophecies.)\n\n\nWith significant provisos to be noted below, Creationists are strongly\nopposed to a world created by evolution, particularly to a world as\ndescribed by Charles Darwin in his Origin of Species.\nCreationists (certainly traditional Creationists) oppose the fact\n(pattern) of evolution, namely that all organisms living and dead are\nthe end products of a natural process of development from a few forms,\nperhaps ultimately from inorganic materials (‘common\ndescent’). Often this is known as ‘macroevolution’\nas opposed to ‘microevolution,’ meaning apes to humans\nrather than merely one species of finch to another. Creationists also\noppose claims about the total adequacy of the Darwinian version of the\ntheory of evolution, namely that population pressures lead to a\nstruggle for existence; that organisms differ in random ways brought\non by errors in the material of heredity (‘mutations’ in\nthe ‘genes’); that the struggle and variation leads to a\nnatural form of selection, with some surviving and reproducing and\nothers failing; and that the end consequence of all of this is\nevolution, in the direction of well-adapted organisms.\n\nCreationists present themselves as the true bearers and present-day\nrepresentatives of authentic, traditional Christianity, but\nhistorically speaking this is simply not true (Ruse 1988 (ed.), 2005;\nNumbers 1992; McMullin 1985). The Bible has a major place in the life\nof any Christian, but it is not the case that the Bible taken\nliterally has always had a major place in the lives or theology of\nChristians. For most, indeed, it has not (Turner 2002). Although, one\nshould remember that most literalists are better known as\ninerrantists, because they often differ on the meaning of a literal\nreading! Tradition, the teachings and authority of the church, has\nalways had main status for Catholics, and natural religion –\napproaching God through reason and argument – has long had an\nhonored place for both Catholics and Protestants. Catholics,\nespecially dating back to Saint Augustine around 400 AD, and even to\nearlier thinkers like Origen, have always recognized that at times the\nBible needs to be taken metaphorically or allegorically. Augustine was\nparticularly sensitive to this need, because for many years as a young\nman he was a Manichean and hence denied the authenticity and relevance\nof the Old Testament for salvation. When he became a Christian he knew\nfull well the problems of Genesis and hence was eager to help his\nfellow believers from getting ensnared in the traps of literalism.\n \nIt was not until the Protestant Reformation that the Bible started to\ntake on its unique central position, as the great Reformers –\nespecially Luther and Calvin – stressed the need to go by\nscripture alone and not by what they took to be the overly rich\ntraditions of the Catholic Church. But even they were doubtful about\ntotally literalistic readings. For Luther, justification by faith was\nthe keystone of his theology, and yet the Epistle of Saint James seems\nto put greater stress on the need for good works. He referred to the\ngospel as ‘right strawy stuff.’ (Wengert 2013). Calvin\nlikewise spoke of the need for God to accommodate His writings to the\nuntutored public – especially the ancient Jews – and hence\nof the dangers of taking the Bible too literally in an uncritical\nsense. The radical branch of the Reformation under Zwingli always put\nprimacy on God’s speaking directly to us through the heart, and to\nthis day one finds modern-day representatives like the Quakers\nuncomfortable with too-biblically centered an approach to religion.\n \nIt was after the religious revivals of the eighteenth and early\nnineteenth century in Britain and America – revivals that led to\nsuch sects as the Methodists – that a more full-blooded\nliteralism became a major part of the religious scene. In America\nparticularly literalism took hold, and especially after the Civil War,\nit took root in the evangelical sects – especially Baptists\n– of the South (Numbers 1998; Noll 2002). It became part of the\ndefining culture of the South, having (as we shall see below) as much\na role in opposing ideas and influences of the leaders and policy\nmakers of the North as anything rooted in deeply thought-through\ntheology. Note the important qualification, ‘leaders and policy\nmakers’ of the North. Many – especially working and\nlower-middle-class people – living in the large cities of the\nNorth felt deeply threatened by the moves to industrialism, the\nweakening of traditional beliefs, and the large influx of immigrants\nfrom Europe. They provided very fertile material for the literalist\npreachers. (See the extended discussions of these happenings in Ruse\n2013.) Thanks to a number of factors, Creationism started to grow\ndramatically in the early part of the twentieth century. First, there\nwere the first systematic attempts to work out a position that would\ntake account of modern science as well as just a literal reading of\nGenesis. Particularly important in this respect were the Seventh-day\nAdventists, especially the Canadian-born George McCready Price, who\nhad theological reasons for wanting literalism, not the least being\nthe belief that the Seventh Day – the day of rest – is\nliterally twenty-four hours in length. Also important for the\nAdventists and for fellow travelers, that is people who think that\nArmageddon is on its way, is the balancing and complementary early\nphenomenon of a world-wide flood. (This, as we shall see, was to\nbecome a major theme in twentieth-century Cold War times.) Second,\nthere was the released energy of evangelicals (referring generically\nto Protestants whose faith was tied to the Bible, taken rather\nliterally) as they succeeded in their attempts to prohibit liquor in\nthe United States. Flushed from one victory, they looked for other\nfields to conquer. Third there was the spread of public education, and\nmore children being exposed to evolutionary ideas, bringing on a\nCreationist reaction. Fourth, there were new evangelical currents\nafloat, especially the tracts the Fundamentals – a series of\nevangelical publications, conceived in 1909 by California businessman\nLyman Stewart, the founder of Union Oil and a devout Presbyterian –\nthat gave the literalist movement its name. And fifth, there was the\nidentification of evolution – Darwinism particularly –\nwith the militaristic aspects of Social Darwinism, especially the\nSocial Darwinism supposed embraced by the Germans in the First World\nWar (Larson 1997; Ruse 2018a). \nThis battle between evolutionists and ‘Fundamentalists’\ncame to a head in the mid 1920s in Dayton Tennessee, when a young\nschool teacher John Thomas Scopes was prosecuted for teaching\nevolution in class, in defiance of a state law prohibiting such\nteaching. Prosecuted by three-times presidential candidate William\nJennings Bryan and defended by noted agnostic lawyer Clarence Darrow,\nthe ‘Scopes Monkey Trial’ caught the attention of the\nworld, especially thanks to the inflammatory reporting of\nBaltimore Sun journalist H. L. Mencken. Matters descended to\nthe farcical when, denied the opportunity to introduce his own science\nwitnesses, Darrow put on the stand the prosecutor Bryan. In the end,\nScopes was found guilty and fined $100. This conviction was overturned\non a technicality on appeal, but there were no more prosecutions, even\nthough the Tennessee law remained on the books for another forty\nyears. In the 1950s, the Scopes trial became the basis of a famous\nplay and then movie, Inherit the Wind. This portrays the Bryan\nfigure as a bigot, wedded to a crude picture of life’s past. In fact,\nBryan in respects was an odd figure to be defending the Tennessee law.\nHe thought that the days of Creation are long periods of time, and he\nhad little sympathy for eschatological speculations about Armageddon\nand so forth. It is quite possible that, humans apart, he accepted\nsome form of evolution. His objections to Darwinism were more social\nthan theological. He hated what he thought were the militaristic\nimplications that many drew from the struggle for existence at the\ncenter of Darwin’s thinking. The First World War, with many justifying\nviolence in the name of evolutionary biology, confirmed his\nsuspicions. (The Pulitzer Prize winning, Summer of the Gods,\nLarson 1997, is definitive on the Scopes trial. It is generally agreed\nthat Inherit the Wind is using history as a vehicle to\nexplore and condemn McCarthy-like attacks on uncomfortably new or\ndissenting-type figures in American society.) \nAfter the Scopes Trial, general agreement is that the Creationism\nmovement had peaked and declined quite dramatically and quickly. Yet,\nit (and related anti-evolution activity) did have its lasting effects.\nText-book manufacturers increasingly took evolution – Darwinism\nespecially – out of their books, so that schoolchildren got less\nand less exposure to the ideas anyway. Whatever battles the\nevolutionists may have thought they had won in the court of popular\nopinion, in the trenches of the classroom they were losing the war\nbadly. Things started to move again in the late 1950s. It was then\nthat, thanks to Sputnik, the Russians so effectively demonstrated\ntheir superiority in rocketry (with its implications for the arms race\nof the Cold War), and America realized with a shudder how ineffective\nwas its science training of its young. Characteristically, the country\ndid something immediate and effective about this, namely pouring money\ninto the production of new science texts. In this way, with class\nadoption, the Federal Government could have a strong impact and yet\nget around the problem that education tends to be under the tight\ncontrol of individual states. The new biology texts gave full scope to\nevolution – to Darwinism – and with this the Creationism\ncontroversy again flared right up. Children were learning these\ndreadful doctrines in schools, and something had to be done (Ruse (ed.)\n1988; Gilkey 1985). \nFortunately for the literalist, help was at hand. A biblical scholar,\nJohn C. Whitcomb, and a hydraulic engineer, Henry M. Morris, combined\nto write what was to be the new Bible of the movement, Genesis\nFlood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific Implications\n(1961). Following in the tradition of earlier writers,\nespecially those from Seventh-day Adventism, they argued that every\nbit of the Biblical story of creation given in the early chapters of\nGenesis is supported fully by the best of modern science. Six days of\ntwenty-four hours, organisms arriving miraculously, humans last, and\nsometime thereafter a massive world-wide flood that wiped most\norganisms off the face of the earth – or rather, dumped their\ncarcasses in the mud as the waters receded. At the same time, Whitcomb\nand Morris argued that the case for evolution fails dismally. They\nintroduced (or revived) a number of arguments that have become\nstandard parts of the Creationist repertoire against evolution. Let us\nlook at a number of these arguments, together with the\ncounter-arguments that evolutionists make in response. \nFirst, the Creationists argue that at best evolution is only a theory\nand not a fact, and that theories should never be taken as gospel (if\none might be permitted a metaphor). They claim that the very language\nof evolutionists themselves show that their ideas are on shaky\ngrounds. To which charge evolutionists respond that this is to confuse\ntwo senses of the word ‘theory.’ Sometimes we use it to\nmean a body of scientific laws, as in ‘Einstein’s theory of\nrelativity.’ Sometimes we use it to mean an ‘iffy\nhypothesis,’ as in ‘I have a theory about Kennedy’s\nassassination.’ These are two very different senses. There is\nnothing iffy about the Copernican heliocentric theory. It is true. It\nis a fact. Evolutionists argue that the same is the case with\nevolution. When talking about the theory of evolution, one is talking\nabout a body of laws. In particular, if one is following the ideas of\nCharles Darwin, one is arguing that population pressures lead to a\nstruggle for existence, this then entails a natural selection of\nfavored forms, and evolution through shared descent is the end result.\nThis is a body of general statements about life, since the 1930s given\nin a formal version using mathematics with deductive inferences\nbetween steps. In other words, we have a body of laws, and hence a\ntheory in the first sense just given. There is no implication here\nthat the theory is iffy, that is in the second sense just given. We\nare not necessarily talking about something inherently unreliable. Of\ncourse, there are going to be additions and revisions, for instance\nthe possibility of much greater hybridization than someone like Darwin\nrealized, but that is another matter (Quammen 2018). \nSecond, Creationists like Whitcomb and Morris claim that the central\nmechanism of modern evolutionary thought, Darwin’s natural selection,\nis bogus. They argue that it is not a genuine claim about the real\nworld but merely a truism, what philosophers call a tautology –\nsomething true by the meaning of the words like ‘bachelors are\nunmarried.’ In the case of natural selection, the Creationists\npoint out that an alternative name for the mechanism is ‘the\nsurvival of the fittest.’ But, they ask, who are the fittest?\nThey reply: Those that survive! Hence, natural selection reduces to\nthe tautology that those that survive are those that survive. Not a\nreal claim of science at all. To which evolutionists respond that this\nis a sleight of hand, showing ignorance of what is genuinely at stake.\nNatural selection is truly real, for it talks about some organisms\nactually surviving and reproducing in life’s struggles and others\nfailing to do so. Some of our would-be ancestors lived and had babies\nand others did not. There was a differential reproduction. This is\ncertainly not a mere truism. It could be that everyone had the same\nnumber of children. It could also be that there is no difference\noverall between the successful and the unsuccessful. This too is\ndenied by natural selection. To say that something is the fitter or\nfittest is to say that it has certain characteristics (what biologists\ncall adaptations) that other organisms do not have, and that on\naverage one expects the fitter to succeed. But there is no guarantee\nthat this must be so or that it will always happen. An earthquake\ncould wipe out everyone, fit and unfit. \nBefore discussing the third argument Creationists level against\nevolution, it is worth pausing over this second one. Most if not all\nprofessional evolutionists argue that sometimes natural selection is\nnot a significant causal factor.  In this sense, it is false that\nselection is something that by definition is and always is the reason\nfor lasting change.  The fittest do not always win.  It cannot be a\ntautology. In the 1930s, the American population geneticist Sewall\nWright devised his hypothesis of “genetic drift,” arguing\nthat sometimes mere chance can lead to effects overriding the forces\nof selection (Wright 1931, 1932). Although, at first, this was\nembraced enthusiastically (Dobzhansky 1937), it soon became clear that\nat the gross physical (phenotypic) level it is at most minor (Coyne,\nBarton, and Turelli 1997). However at the level of the gene\n(genotype), it is still thought very important. Indeed, it is a\npowerful tool in discovering the exact dates of key evolutionary\nevents, especially those involving speciation (Ayala 2009). Moreover,\nas we shall see in a moment, somewhat paradoxically, as Creationism\nhas evolved (!), increasingly the virtues of selection working at the\nmicroevolutionary level have become apparent. Thus can one explain the\ndiversity of life on earth – it evolved since leaving the Ark,\nwhich contained only generic kinds. For all its supposed faults, there\nis a better discussion of natural selection at the Creationist museum\nin Kentucky than in the Field Museum in Chicago, 300 miles north. The\nbar on macroevolution remains absolute. \nThird, Creationists point out that modern evolutionary theory asserts\nthat the raw building blocks of evolution, the genetic mutations, are\nrandom. But this means that there are minimal chances of evolution\nproducing something that works as well and efficiently as an organism,\nwith all of the functioning parts in place. A monkey typing letters\ndoes so randomly. It could never in a million years (in a billion,\nbillion, billion… years) type the works of Shakespeare. The\nCreationists say that same is true of evolution and organisms, given\nthe randomness of mutation. To which evolutionists reply that this may\nall be well and true of the monkey, but in the case of evolution\nthings are rather different. If a mutation works, then it is kept and\nthen built upon, until the next good mutation comes along. This\nshrinks considerably the odds of evolution producing organisms, even\nthough the appearance of mutation is random. Suppose you take just one\nphrase from Shakespeare. ‘Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me\nyour ears.’ If you had to get every letter right straight off,\nyou would be into a huge time-span. Twenty-six (the number of letters,\nmore if you include capitals and gaps and punctuation) to the power of\nthe number of spaces. But if you are allowed to keep the\n‘F’ as soon as you get it, and then go on to try for a\n‘r’, you are no longer going back to square one each time\nand suddenly the task becomes much more manageable. (Dawkins 1986 has\na good discussion of these issues.) Incidentally, add evolutionists,\none must take care in speaking of mutation as ‘random.’\nThere is no implication that mutation is uncaused or something else\nrather peculiar. Rather is meant that mutations do not occur according\nto need. Suppose a new disease appears. Evolutionary theory does not\nguarantee that a new, life-protecting mutation will occur to\norder. \nFourth in the litany of Creationist complaints, there is a perennial\nfavourite based on paleontology. Creationists agree that the fossil\nrecord is sequential, fish to primates moving upwards, but argue that\nthis is the result of the sorting effect of the Flood. Primates are\nabove dinosaurs, for example, because primates are more agile and\nmoved further up the mountain before being caught and drowning. They\nalso argue, however, that the fossil record ought to be continuous if\nevolution occurred, but in real life there are many gaps between\ndifferent form – jumps from one kind of organism to another.\nApes to humans would be a case in point. This spells Creation not\nevolution. To which the response comes that on the one hand one\nexpects such gaps. Fossilization is an uncommon occurrence –\nmost dead bodies get eaten straight away or just rot – and the\nwonder is that we have what we do have. On the other hand argue\nevolutionists, the record is not that gappy. There are lots of good\nsequences – lines of fossils with little difference between\nadjacent forms, from the amphibians to the mammals for example, or (in\nmore detail) the evolution of the horse from Eohippus on five toes to\nthe modern horse on one toe. Moreover, in refutation of Creationism,\nwe do not find fossils out of order as you might expect after a flood.\nFor all that Creationists sometimes claim otherwise, humans are never\nfound down with the dinosaurs. Those brutes of old expired long before\nwe appeared on the scene and the fossil record confirms this. \nFifth, Creationists argue that physics disproves evolution. The second\nlaw of thermodynamics claims that things always run down –\nentropy increases, to use the technical language. Energy gets used and\nconverted eventually into heat, and cannot be of further service. But\norganisms clearly keep going and seem to defy the law. This would be\nimpossible simply given evolution. The second law rules out the blind\nevolution (meaning change without direct divine guidance) of organisms\nfrom the initial simple blobs up to the complex higher organisms like\nhumans. There must therefore have been a non-natural, miraculous\nintervention to produce functioning life. To which argument the\nresponse of evolutionists is that the second law does indeed say that\nthings are running down, but it does not deny that isolated pockets of\nthe universe might reverse the trend for a short while by using energy\nfrom elsewhere. And this is what happens on planet Earth. We use the\nenergy from the sun to keep evolving for a while. Eventually the sun\nwill go out and life will become extinct. The second law will win\neventually, but not just yet. \nSixth, and let us make this the final Creationist objection, it is\nsaid that humans simply cannot be explained by blind law (that is,\nunguided law), especially not by blind evolutionary laws. They must\nhave been created. To which the response is that it is mere arbitrary\nsupposition to believe that humans are that exceptional. In fact,\ntoday the fossil record for humans is strong – we evolved over\nthe past four million years from small creatures of half our height,\nwho had small brains and who walked upright but not as well as we.\nThere is lots of fossil proof of these beings (known as\nAustralopithecus afarensis). Recently, there are other\npertinent discoveries, showing that (as one would expect) there is not\nonly evolution towards modern humans, but branching and sidelines, for\ninstance of the so-called “hobbit,” Homo\nfloresiensis (Falk 2012). Perhaps it is true that we humans are\nspecial, in that (as Christians claim) we uniquely have immortal\nsouls, but this is a religious claim. It is not a claim of science,\nand hence evolution should not be faulted for not explaining souls.\nThere is of course a lot more to be found out about human evolution,\nbut this is the nature of science. No branch of science has all of the\nanswers. The real question is whether the branch of science keeps the\nanswers coming in, and evolutionists claim that this is certainly true\nof their branch of science. \nBefore moving on historically, it is worthwhile to stop for a moment\nand consider aspects of Creationism, in what one might term the\ncultural context. First, as a populist movement, driven as much by\nsocial factors – a sense of alienation from the modern world\n— one would expect to find that cultural changes in society\nwould be reflected in Creationist beliefs. This is indeed so. Take,\nabove all, the question of racial issues and relationships. In the\nmiddle of the nineteenth century in the South, biblical literalism was\nvery popular because it was thought to justify slavery (Noll 2002).\nEven though one can read the Christian message as being strongly\nagainst slavery — the Sermon on the Mount hardly recommends\nmaking people into the property of others – the Bible elsewhere\nseems to endorse slavery. Remember, when the escaped slave came to\nSaint Paul, the apostle told him to return to his master and to obey\nhim. Remnants of this kind of thinking persisted in Creationist\ncircles well into the twentieth century. Price, for instance, was\nquite convinced that blacks are degenerate whites. By the time of\nGenesis Flood, however, the civil rights movement was in full\nflower, and Whitcomb and Morris trod very carefully. They explained in\ndetail that the Bible gives no justification for treating blacks as\ninferior. The story of the son and grandson of Noah being banished to\na dark-skinned future was not part of their reading of the Holy\nScriptures. Literalism may be the unvarnished word of God, but\nliteralism is as open to interpretation as scholarly readings of Plato\nor Aristotle. That is why many refer to Creationists as\n“inerrantists” rather than “literalists.” \nSecond, as noted above, both for internal and external reasons,\nCreationists realized that they needed to tread carefully in outright\nopposition to evolution of all kinds. Could it really be that Noah’s\nArk carried all of the animals that we find on earth today? It would\nbe much easier if the Ark carried only the basic “kinds”\nof Creation, and then after the Flood the animals dispersed and\ndiversified. We find in fact then that although Creationists were (and\nare) adamantly opposed to unified common descent and to the idea of\nnatural change being adequate for all the forms we see today, from\nearly on they were accepting huge amounts of what can only truly be\ncalled evolution! This said, Creationists were convinced that this\nchange occurs much more rapidly than most conventional evolutionists\nwould allow. Although it took some time to formulate, gradually we see\nemerging the strategy of (what we have seen as) distinguishing between\nwhat is called “microevolution” and\n“macroevolution.” Supposedly, microevolution is the sort\nof thing that brought diversification to Darwin’s finches, and many\nCreationists – notwithstanding the fact that it is supposedly a\ntautology – are even prepared to put this down to natural\nselection. Macroevolution is what makes reptiles reptiles, and mammals\nmammals. This cannot be a natural process but required miracles during\nthe days of Creation. Although he was a lifelong opponent of\nCreationism (see below), forever committed to common descent, and\nthought that all changes must be natural, Creationists seized with\nglee on paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould’s claims that microevolution\nmust be selection-fueled and macroevolution might require other causal\nforces (Gould 1980). \nThird, and perhaps most significant of all, never think that\nCreationism is purely an epistemological matter – a matter of\nfacts and their understanding. Moral claims have always been\nabsolutely fundamental. Nearly all Creationists (in the Christian\ncamp) are what is known theologically as premillennialists, believing\nthat Jesus will come soon and reign over the world before the Last\nJudgement. They are opposed to postmillennialists who think that Jesus\nwill come later, and amillennialists who are inclined to think that\nperhaps we are already living in a Jesus-dominated era.\nPostmillennialists put a premium on our getting things ready for Jesus\n– hence, we should engage in social action and the like.\nPremillennialists think there is nothing we ourselves can do to better\nthe world, so we had best get ourselves and others in a state ready\nfor Jesus. This means individual behavior and conversion of others.\nFor premillennialists therefore, and this includes almost all\nCreationists, the great moral drives are to things like family\nsanctity (which today encompasses anti-abortion), sexual orthodoxy\n(especially anti-homosexuality), biblically sanctioned punishments\n(very pro-capital punishment), strong support for Israel (because of\nclaims in Revelation about the Jews returning to Israel before End\nTimes), and so forth. It is absolutely vital to see how this moral\nagenda is an integral part of American Creationism, as much as Floods\nand Arks. (Ruse 2005 discusses these matters in much detail.) \nGenesis Flood enjoyed massive popularity among the faithful,\nand led to a thriving Creation Science Movement, where Morris\nparticularly and his coworkers and believers – notably Duane T.\nGish, author of Evolution: The Fossils Say No! – pushed\nthe literalist line. Particularly effective was their challenging of\nevolutionists to debate, where they would employ every rhetorical\ntrick in the book, reducing the scientists to fury and impotence, with\nbold statements (provocatively made most often by Gish) about the\nsupposed nature of the universe (Gilkey 1985; Ruse (ed.) 1988). This all\nculminated eventually in a court case in Arkansas. By the end of the\n1970s, Creationists were passing around draft bills, intended for\nstate legislatures, that would allow – insist on – the\nteaching of Creationism in state-supported public schools. In the\nbiology classes of such schools, that is. By this time it was realized\nthat, thanks to Supreme Court rulings on the First Amendment to the\nConstitution (that which prohibits the establishment of state\nreligion), it was not possible to exclude the teaching of evolution\nfrom such schools. The trick was to get Creationism – something\nthat prima facie rides straight through the separation of\nchurch and state – into such schools. The idea of Creation\nScience is to do this. The claim is that, although the science\nparallels Genesis, as a matter of scientific fact, it stands alone as\ngood science. Hence, these draft bills proposed what was called:\n‘Balanced treatment.’ If one were to teach the\n‘evolution model,’ then one had also to teach the\n‘Creation Science model.’ Sauce for the evolutionist goose\nis also sauce for the Creationist gander.  \nIn 1981, these drafts found a taker in Arkansas, where such a bill was\npassed and signed into law – as it happens, by a legislature and\ngovernor that thought little of what they were doing until the\nconsequences were drawn to their attention. (William Clinton was\ngovernor from 1978 to 1980, and again from 1982 to his winning of the\npresidency, in 1992. The law was passed during the interregnum.) At\nonce the American Civil Liberties Union sprang into action, bringing\nsuit on grounds of the law’s unconstitutionality. The theologian\nLangdon Gilkey, the geneticist Francisco Ayala, the paleontologist\nStephen Jay Gould, and as the philosophical representative Michael\nRuse appeared as expert witnesses, arguing that Creationism has no\nplace in state supported biology classes. The state’s position was not\nexactly helped when one of its witnesses (Norman Geisler, a\ntheologian) admitted under cross-examination to his belief in UFOs as\na satanic manifestation. Hardly surprisingly, evolution won. The judge\nruled firmly that Creation Science is not science, it is religion, and\nas such has no place in public classrooms. The judge (William Overton)\nruled that the ‘essential characteristics’ of what makes\nsomething scientific are: \nIn the judge’s opinion, Creation Science fails on all counts, and that\napparently was an end to matters. In 1987 this whole matter was\ndecided decisively in the same way, by the Supreme Court, in a similar\ncase involving Louisiana. (See Ruse (ed.) 1988, for an edited\ncollection that reproduces many of the pertinent documents, including\nstate bills, as well as witness testimony and the judge’s\nruling.)  \nOf course, in real life nothing is ever that simple, and Arkansas was\ncertainly not the end of matters. One of the key issues in the trial\nwas less theological or scientific, but philosophical. (Paradoxically,\nthe ACLU had significant doubts about using a philosophical witness and\nonly decided at the last minute to bring Michael Ruse to the stand. As\nit happens, as the judge’s ruling shows, the philosophical testimony\nproved crucial.) Look again at the fifth of the judge’s criteria for\nwhat makes for good or genuine science. The Creationists had started\nto refer to the ideas of the eminent, Austrian-born, British-residing\nphilosopher\n Karl Popper\n (1959). As is well known, Popper claimed that for something to be\ngenuinely scientific it has to be falsifiable. By this, Popper meant\nthat genuine science puts itself up to check against the real world.\nIf the predictions of the science hold true, then it lives to fight\nanother day. If the predictions fail, then the science must be\nrejected – or at least revised. Popper (1974) himself expressed\ndoubts about whether evolutionary theory is genuinely falsifiable and\nhe rather inclined to think that it is less a description of reality\nthan a heuristic to further study, what he called a\n‘metaphysical research programme’ (Ruse 1977). The\nCreationists seized on this and argued that they had the best\nauthority to reject evolution, or at least to judge it no more of a\nscience than Creationism. (To his credit, Popper revised his thinking\non Darwinian evolutionary theory and grew to see and admit that it was\na genuine scientific theory; see Popper 1978). \nPart of the testimony in Arkansas was designed to refute this\nargument, and it was shown that in fact evolution does indeed make\nfalsifiable claims. As we have already seen, natural selection is no\ntautology. If one could show that organisms did not exhibit\ndifferential reproduction – to take the example given above,\nthat all proto-humans had the same number of offspring – then\nselection theory would certainly be false. Likewise, if one could show\nthat human and dinosaur remains truly did occur in the same time\nstrata of the fossil record, one would have powerful proof against the\nthinking of modern evolutionists. This argument succeeded in court\n– the judge accepted that evolutionary thinking is falsifiable.\nConversely, he accepted that Creation Science is never truly open to\ncheck. On-the-spot, ad hoc hypotheses proliferate as soon as any of\nits claims are challenged. It is not falsifiable and hence not genuine\nscience. However, after the case a number of prominent philosophers\n(most notably the American Larry Laudan) objected strongly to the very\nidea of using falsifiability as a ‘criterion of\ndemarcation’ between science and non-science. They argued that\nin fact there is no hard and fast rule for distinguishing science from\nother forms of human activity, and that hence in this sense the\nCreationists might have a point (Ruse (ed.) 1988). Not that people like\nLaudan were themselves Creationists. They thought Creationism false.\nTheir objection was rather to trying to find some way of making\nevolution and not Creationism into a genuine science. \nDefenders of the anti-Creationism strategy taken in Arkansas argued,\nwith reason and law, that the United States Constitution does not bar\nthe teaching of false science. It bars the teaching of non-science,\nespecially non-science which is religion by another name. Hence, if\nthe objections of people like Laudan were taken seriously, the\nCreationists might have a case to make for the balanced treatment of\nevolution and Creationism. Popperian falsifiability may be a somewhat\nrough and ready way of separating science and religion, but it is good\nenough for the job at hand, and in law that is what counts.  \nEvolutionists were successful in court. Nevertheless, Laudan and\nfellow thinkers inspired the Creationists to new efforts, and\nsince the Arkansas court case, the philosophical dimension to the\nevolution/Creationism controversy has been much increased. In\nparticular, philosophical arguments are central to the thinking of the\nleader of today’s creationists, Berkeley law professor, Phillip\nJohnson, whose reputation was made with the anti-evolutionary tract\nDarwin on Trial (1991). (Johnson’s influence and importance\nis recognized by all and he has become leader emeritus. As we\nshall see, the task of leadership then got passed to younger people,\nespecially the biochemist Michael Behe and the\nphilosopher-mathematician William Dembski.) In respects, Johnson just\nrepeated the arguments of the Creation Scientists (those given in an\nearlier section) – gaps in the fossil record and so forth\n— but at the same time he stressed that the Creation/evolution\ndebate is not just one of science versus religion or good science\nversus bad science, but rather of conflicting philosophical positions.\nThe implication was that one philosophy is much like another, or\nrather the implication was that one person’s philosophy is another\nperson’s poison and that it is all a matter of personal opinion.\nBehind this one sees the lawyer’s mind at work that, if it is all a\nmatter of philosophy, then there is nothing in the United States\nConstitution which bars the teaching of Creationism in schools. (For\nbetter or for worse, one sees the heavy hand of Thomas Kuhn here, and\nhis claim in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions that\nthe change from one paradigm to another is akin to a political\nrevolution, not ultimately fueled by logic but more by\nextra-scientific factors, like emotions and simple preferences. In the\nArkansas trial, Kuhn was as oft mentioned by the prosecutors as was\nPopper.) \nCrucial to Johnson’s position are a number of fine distinctions. He\ndistinguishes between what he calls “methodological\nnaturalism” and “metaphysical naturalism”. The\nformer is the scientific stance of trying to explain by laws and by\nrefusing to introduce miracles. A methodological naturalist would\ninsist on explaining all phenomena, however strange, in natural terms.\nElijah setting fire to the water-drenched sacrifice, for instance,\nwould be explained in terms of lightning striking or some such thing.\nThe latter is the philosophical stance that insists that there is\nnothing beyond the natural – no God, no supernatural, no\nnothing. ‘Naturalism is a metaphysical doctrine, which\nmeans simply that it states a particular view of what is ultimately\nreal and unreal. According to naturalism, what is ultimately real is\nnature, which consists of the fundamental particles that make up what\nwe call matter and energy, together with the natural laws that govern\nhow those particles behave. Nature itself is ultimately all there is,\nat least as far as we are concerned’ (Johnson 1995, 37–38). \nThen there is someone that Johnson calls a ‘theistic\nrealist.’ This is someone who believes in a God, and that this\nGod can and does intervene in the natural world. ‘God always has\nthe option of working through regular secondary mechanisms, and we\nobserve such mechanisms frequently. On the other hand, many important\nquestions – including the origin of genetic information and\nhuman consciousness – may not be explicable in terms of\nunintelligent causes, just as a computer or a book cannot be explained\nthat way’ (p. 209). Johnson thinks of himself as a theistic\nrealist, and hence as such in opposition to metaphysical realism.\nMethodological realism, which he links with evolutionism, would seem\nto be distinct from metaphysical realism, but it is Johnson’s claim\nthat the former slides into the latter. Hence, the evolutionist is the\nmethodological realist, is the metaphysical realist, is the opponent\nof the theistic realist – and as far as Johnson is concerned,\nthe genuine theistic realist is one who takes a pretty literalistic\nreading of the Bible. So ultimately, it is all less a matter of\nscience and more a matter of attitudes and philosophy. Evolution and\nCreationism are different world pictures, and it is conceptually,\nsocially, pedagogically, and with good luck in the future legally\nwrong to treat them differently. More than this, it is incorporated\ninto Johnson’s argument that Creationism (a.k.a. Theistic Realism) is\nthe only genuine form of Christianity. \nBut does any of this really follow? The evolutionist would claim not.\nThe key notion in Johnson’s attack is clearly methodological\nnaturalism. Metaphysical naturalism, having been defined as something\nwhich precludes theism, has been set up as a philosophy with a\nreligion-like status. It necessarily perpetuates the conflict between\nreligion and science. But as Johnson himself notes, many people think\nthat they can be methodological naturalists and theists.\nMethodological naturalism is not a religion equivalent. Is this\npossible, at least in a consistent way with intellectual integrity? It\nis Johnson’s claim that it is not, for he wants the religion/science\nwar to be absolute with no captives or compromises. \nTo sort out this debate, let us agree (to what is surely the case)\nthat if you are a methodological naturalist, today you are going to\naccept evolution and conversely to think that evolution supports your\ncause. Today, methodological naturalism and evolution are a package\ndeal. Take one, and you take the other. Reject one, and you reject the\nother. Clearly then, if your theism is one which gets its knowledge of\nGod’s actions and purposes from a literal reading of the Bible, you\nhave got a conflict. You cannot accept Genesis literally and\nevolution. That is a fact. In other words, there can be no\naccommodation between Creationism and evolution. However, what if you\nthink that theologically speaking there is much to be said for a nice\nshade of grey? What if you think that much of the Bible, although\ntrue, should be interpreted in a metaphorical manner? What if you\nthink you can be an evolutionist, and yet take in the essential heart\nof the Bible? What price consistency and methodological naturalism\nthen? The answer depends on what you take to be the “essential\nheart” of the Bible. At a minimum we can say that, to the\nChristian, this heart speaks of our sinful nature, of God’s sacrifice,\nand of the prospect of ultimate salvation. It speaks of the world as a\nmeaningful creation of God (however caused) and of a foreground drama\nwhich takes place within this world. One refers particularly to the\noriginal sin, Jesus’ life and death, and his resurrection and anything\nwhich comes after it. And clearly at once we are plunged into the\nfirst of the big problems, namely that of miracles – those of\nJesus himself (the turning of water into wine at the marriage at\nCana), his return to life on the third day, and (especially if you are\na Catholic) such ongoing miracles as transubstantiation and those\nassociated, in response to prayer, with the intervention of saints.\n \nThere are a number of options here for the would-be methodological\nnaturalist. You might simply say that such miracles occurred, that\nthey did involve violations of law, but that they are outside your\nscience. They are simply exceptions to the rule. End of argument. A\nlittle abrupt, but not flatly inconsistent with calling yourself a\ntheist. You say normally God works through law but, for our salvation,\nmiracles outside law were necessary. Or you might say that miracles\noccur but that they are compatible with science, or at least not\nincompatible. Jesus was in a trance and the cure for cancer after the\nprayers to Saint Bernadette was according to rare, unknown, but\ngenuine laws. This position is less abrupt, although you might worry\nwhether this strategy is truly Christian, in letter or in spirit. It\nseems a little bit of a cheat to say that the Jesus taken down from\nthe cross was truly not dead, and the marriage at Cana starts to sound\nlike outright fraud. Of course, you can start stripping away at more\nand more miracles, downgrading them to regular occurrences blown up\nand magnified by the Apostles, but in the end this rather defeats the\nwhole purpose. \nThe third option is simply to refuse to get into the battle at all.\nYou argue that the law/miracle dichotomy is a false one. Miracles are\njust not the sorts of things which conflict with or confirm natural\nlaws. Traditional Christians have always argued this in some respects.\nTake the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. The turning of the\nbread and the wine into the body and blood of Christ is simply not\nsomething open to empirical check. You cannot disconfirm religion or\nprove science by doing an analysis of the host. Likewise even with the\nresurrection of Jesus. After the Crucifixion, his mortal body was\nirrelevant. The point was that the disciples felt Jesus in their\nhearts, and were thus emboldened to go forth and preach the gospel.\nSomething real happened to them, but it was not a physical reality\n– nor, for instance, was Paul’s conversion a physical event,\neven though it changed his life and those of countless after him.\nToday’s miracles also are really more a matter of the spirit than the\nflesh. Does one simply go to Lourdes in hope of a lucky lottery ticket\nto health or for the comfort that one knows one will get, even if\nthere is no physical cure? In the words of the philosophers, it is a\ncategory mistake to put miracles and laws in the same set. (Hume\n(1748, 1779) is the starting place for these discussions. Although\nsomewhat dated, Flew and MacIntyre (1955) is still invaluable.\nParadoxically, both of these then-atheist authors came to see the\nlight and returned to the Christianity of their childhoods!\nApparently, the “words of the philosophers” are not\ndefinitive.) \nWhat has Johnson to say to all of this? Frustratingly, the answer is:\n“remarkably little”! In main part this stems from a\nrefusal to spell out exactly what is meant by “theism”.\nWhat Johnson does say is more in the way of sneer or dismissal than\nargument. \nHe adds: \nAt this point, the evolutionist will probably throw up his or her\nhands in despair. Where did the idea of ‘makeshift\ncompromise’ come from except from Johnson’s imagination? In\nactual fact, many significant theologians of our age think that, with\nrespect to miracles, science and religion have no conflict (Barth\n1949; Gilkey 1985). They would add that faith without difficulty and\nopposition is not true faith, either. “As the Danish philosopher\nSøren Kierkegaard … taught us, too much objective\ncertainty deadens the very soul of faith. Genuine piety is possible\nonly in the face of radical uncertainty” (Haught 1995, 59). Such\nthinkers, often conservative theologically, are inspired by Martin\nBuber to find God in the center of personal relationships, I-Thou,\nrather in science, I-It. For them there is something degrading in the\nthought of Jesus as a miracle man, a sort of fugitive from the Ed\nSullivan Show. What happened with the five thousand? Some hokey-pokey\nover a few loaves and fishes? Or did Jesus fill the multitude’s heart\nwith love, so there was a spontaneous outpouring of generosity and\nsharing, as every one in the crowd was fed by the food brought by a\nfew? These theologians would agree fully with the first part of\nJohnson’s characterization of “theism”. Things were very\ndifferent thanks to Jesus’ presence and actions. What they deny, here\nor elsewhere, is the need to search for exception to law. \nJohnson’s Creationism and evolution/naturalism are indeed in conflict.\nBut Johnson’s Creationism is not all that there is to religion, to\nChristianity in particular. There are those who call themselves\ntheists, who think that one can be a methodological naturalist, where\ntoday this would imply evolution (Ruse 2010). Johnson has not argued\nagainst them. \nLet us move on now from the more philosophical sorts of issues.\nBuilding on the more critical approach of Johnson, who is taken to\nhave cleared the foundations as it were, there is a group of people\nwho are trying to offer an alternative to evolution. These are the\nenthusiasts for so-called ‘Intelligent Design.’ Supporters\nof this position think that Darwinism is ineffective, at least\ninasmuch as it claims to make superfluous or unnecessary a direct\nappeal to a designer of some sort. These are people who think that a\nfull understanding of the organic world demands the invocation of some\nforce beyond nature, a force which is purposeful or at least purpose\ncreating. Often the phrase which is used is “organized\ncomplexity,” a term much used by the German Romantic philosopher\nFriedrich Schelling, and which by invoking the intentional predicate\n“organized” rather gives the game away (Richards\n2003). For the moment, continue to defer questions about the\nrelationship between Intelligent Design Theory and more traditional\nforms of Creationism. \nThere are two parts to this approach: an empirical and a\nphilosophical. Let us take them in turn, beginning with he who has\nmost fully articulated the empirical case for a designer, the\nalready-mentioned, Lehigh University biochemist Michael Behe. Focusing\non something which he calls ‘irreducible complexity,’ Behe\nwrites: \nBehe adds, surely truly, that any \nNow turn to the world of biology, and in particular turn to the\nmicro-world of the cell and of mechanisms that we find at that level.\nTake bacteria which use a flagellum, driven by a kind of rotary motor,\nto move around. Every part is incredibly complex, and so are the\nvarious parts, combined. The external filament of the flagellum\n(called ‘flagellin’), for instance, is a single protein\nthat makes a kind of paddle surface contacting the liquid during\nswimming. Near the surface of the cell, just as needed is a\nthickening, so that the filament can be connected to the rotor drive.\nThis naturally requires a connector, known as a ‘hook\nprotein.’ There is no motor in the filament, so that has to be\nsomewhere else. ‘Experiments have demonstrated that it is\nlocated at the base of the flagellum, where electron microscopy shows\nseveral ring structures occur’ (p. 70). All, way too complex to\nhave come into being in a gradual fashion. Only a one-step process\nwill do, and this one-step process must involve some sort of designing\ncause. Behe is careful not to identify this designer with the\nChristian God, but the implication is that it is a force from without\nthe normal course of nature. Irreducible complexity spells design. \nIrreducible complexity is supposedly something which could not have\ncome through unbroken law (meaning law that has no special divine\nguidance), and especially not through the agency of natural selection.\nCritics claim that Behe shows a misunderstanding of the very nature\nand workings of natural selection. No one is denying that in natural\nprocesses there may well be parts which, if removed, would lead at\nonce to the non-functioning of the systems in which they occur. The\npoint however is not whether the parts now in place could not be\nremoved without collapse, but whether they could have been put in\nplace by natural selection. Consider an arched bridge, made from cut\nstone, without cement, held in place only by the force of the stones\nagainst each other. If you tried to build the bridge from scratch,\nupwards and then inwards, you would fail – the stones would keep\nfalling to the ground, as indeed the whole bridge now would collapse\nwere you to remove the center keystone or any surrounding it. Rather,\nwhat you must do is first build a supporting structure (possibly an\nearthen embankment), on which you will lay the stones of the bridge,\nuntil they are all in place. At which point you can remove the\nstructure for it is no longer needed, and in fact is in the way.\nLikewise, one can imagine a biochemical sequential process with\nseveral stages, on the parts of which other processes piggyback as it\nwere. Then the hitherto non-sequential parasitic processes link up and\nstart functioning independently, the original sequence finally being\nremoved by natural selection as redundant or inconveniently draining\nof resources. \nOf course, this is all pretend. But Darwinian evolutionists have\nhardly ignored the matter of complex processes. Indeed, it is\ndiscussed in detail by Darwin in the Origin, where he refers\nto that most puzzling of all adaptations, the eye. At the biochemical\nlevel, today’s Darwinians have many examples of the most complex of\nprocesses that have been put in place by selection. Take that staple\nof the body’s biochemistry, the process where energy from food is\nconverted into a form which can be used by the cells. Rightly does a\nstandard textbook refer to this vital organic system, the so-called\n‘Krebs cycle,’ as something which ‘undergoes a very\ncomplicated series of reactions’ (Hollum 1987, 408). This\nprocess, which occurs in the cell parts known as mitochondria,\ninvolves the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate): a complex\nmolecule which is energy rich and which is degraded by the body as\nneeded (say in muscle action) into another less rich molecule ADP\n(adenosine diphosphate). The Krebs cycle remakes ATP from other energy\nsources – an adult human male needs to make nearly 200 Kg a day\n— and by any measure, the cycle is enormously involved and\nintricate. For a start, nearly a dozen enzymes (substances which\nfacilitate chemical processes) are required, as one sub-process leads\non to another.  \nYet the cycle did not come out of nowhere. It was cobbled together out\nof other cellular processes which do other things. It was a\n‘bricolage’, that is to say it was something put together\nin a haphazard fashion. Each one of the bits and pieces of the cycle\nexists for other purposes and has been coopted for the new end. The\nscientists who have made this connection could not have made a\nstronger case against Behe’s irreducible complexity than if they had\nhad him in mind from the first. In fact, they set up the problem\nvirtually in Behe’s terms: ‘The Krebs cycle has been frequently\nquoted as a key problem in the evolution of living cells, hard to\nexplain by Darwin’s natural selection: How could natural selection\nexplain the building of a complicated structure in toto, when the\nintermediate stages have no obvious fitness functionality?’\n(Meléndez-Hervia et al 1996, 302). (Readers who want to dig\nmore deeply into some of the technical issues should start with the \nentry on\n  fitness.) \nWhat these workers do not offer is a Behe-type answer. First, they\nbrush away a false lead. Could it be that we have something like the\nevolution of the mammalian eye, where primitive existent eyes in other\norganisms suggest that selection can and does work on proto models (as\nit were), refining features which have the same function if not as\nefficient as more sophisticated models? Probably not, for there is no\nevidence of anything like this. But then we are put on a more\npromising track.  \nRounding off the response to Behe, let us note that, if his arguments\nare well-taken, then in respects we are into a bigger set of problems\nthan otherwise! His position seems simply not viable given what we\nknow of the nature of mutation and the stability of biological systems\nover time. When exactly is the intelligent designer supposed to strike\nand to do its work? In his major work, Darwin’s Black Box,\nBehe suggests that everything might have been done long ago and then\nleft to its own devices. ‘The irreducibly complex biochemical\nsystems that I have discussed… did not have to be produced\nrecently. It is entirely possible, based simply on an examination of\nthe systems themselves, that they were designed billions of years ago\nand that they have been passed down to the present by the normal\nprocesses of cellular reproduction’ (Behe 1996, 227–8).  \nThis is not a satisfactory response. We cannot ignore the history of\nthe genes from the point between their origin (when they would not\nhave been needed) and today when they are in full use. In the words of\nBrown biochemist Kenneth Miller: ‘As any student of biology will\ntell you, because those genes are not expressed, natural selection\nwould not be able to weed out genetic mistakes. Mutations would\naccumulate in these genes at breathtaking rates, rendering them\nhopelessly changed and inoperative hundreds of millions of years\nbefore Behe says that they will be needed.’ There is much\nexperimental evidence showing that this is the case. Behe’s idea of\ndesigner doing everything back then and then leaving matters to their\nnatural fate is ‘pure and simple fantasy’ (Miller 1999,\n162–3). \nWhat is the alternative strategy that Behe must take? Presumably that\nthe designer is at work all of the time, producing mechanisms as and\nwhen needed. So, if we are lucky, we might expect to see some produced\nin our lifetime. Indeed, there must be a sense of disappointment among\nbiologists that no such creative acts have so far been reported. More\nthan this, as we turn from science towards theology, there even\ngreater disappointments. Most obviously, what about bad mutations (in\nthe sense of mutations that lead to consequences very non-helpful to\ntheir possessors)? If the designer is needed and available for complex\nengineering problems, why could not the designer take some time on the\nsimple matters, specifically those simple matters which if unfixed\nlead to absolutely horrendous problems. Some of the worst genetic\ndiseases are caused by one little alteration in one little part of the\nDNA. If the designer is able and willing to do the very complex\nbecause it is very good, why does it not do the very simple because\nthe alternative is very bad? Behe speaks of this as being part of the\nproblem of evil, which is true, but not very helpful. Given that the\nopportunity and ability to do good was so obvious and yet not taken,\nwe need to know the reason why. (A comprehensive collection, edited by\nan Intelligent Design Theorist and an avid Darwinian evolutionist,\ncontains arguments from both sides, by biologists and philosophers;\nsee Dembski and Ruse (eds.) 2004.) \nBehe is in need of help. This supposedly comes from a conceptual\nargument in favor of Intelligent Design due to the also-mentioned,\nphilosopher-mathematician William Dembski (1998a, b). Let us first\nlook at his argument, and then see how it helps Behe. \nDembski’s aim is two-fold. First, to give us the criteria by which we\ndistinguish something that we would label ‘designed’\nrather than otherwise. Second, to put this into context, and show how\nwe distinguish design from something produced naturally by law or\nsomething we would put down to chance. As far as inferring design is\nconcerned, there are three notions of importance: contingency,\ncomplexity, and specification. Design has to be something which is not\ncontingent. The example that Dembski uses is the message from outer\nspace received in the movie Contact. The series of dots and\ndashes, zeros and ones, could not be deduced from the laws of physics.\nBut do they show evidence of design? Suppose we can interpret the\nseries in a binary fashion, and the initial yield is the number group,\n2, 3, 5. As it happens, these are the beginning of the prime-number\nseries, but with so small a yield no one is going to get very excited.\nIt could just be chance. So no one is going to insist on design yet.\nBut suppose now you keep going on the series, and it turns out that it\nyields in exact and precise order the prime numbers up to 101. Now you\nwill start to think that something is up, because the situation seems\njust too complex to be mere chance. It is highly improbable.\n‘Complexity as I am describing it here is a form of\nprobability….’ (Dembski 2000, 27). \nBut although you are probably happy now to conclude (on the basis of\nthe prime-number sequence) that there are extraterrestrials out there,\nin fact there is another thing needed. ‘If I flip a coin 1000\ntimes, I will participate in a highly complex (that is, highly\nimprobable) event…. This sequence of coin tosses will not,\nhowever, trigger a design inference. Though complex, this sequence\nwill not exhibit a suitable pattern.’ Here, we have a contrast\nwith the prime-number sequence from 2 to 101. ‘Not only is this\nsequence complex, but it also embodies a suitable pattern. The SETI\nresearcher who in the movie Contact discovered this sequence put it\nthis way: “This isn’t noise, this has structure”’\n(pp. 27–8). What is going on here? You recognize in design something\nwhich is not just arbitrary or chance or which is given status only\nafter the experiment or discovery, but rather something that was or\ncould be in some way specified, insisted upon, before you set out. You\nknow or could work out the sequence of prime numbers at any time\nbefore or after the contact from space. The random sequence of penny\ntosses will come only after the event. ‘The key concept is that\nof “independence”. I define a specification as a match\nbetween an event and an independently given pattern. Events that are\nboth highly complex and specified (that is, that match an\nindependently given pattern) indicate design.’  \nDembski is now in a position to move on to the second part of his\nargument where we actually detect design. Here we have what he calls\nan ‘Explanatory Filter’ (Dembski 1998a, b). We have a\nparticular phenomenon. The question is, what caused it? Is it\nsomething which might not have happened, given the laws of nature? Is\nit contingent? Or was it necessitated? The moon goes endlessly round\nthe earth. We know that it does this because of (the updated version\nof) Newton’s laws. End of discussion. No design here. However, now we\nhave some rather strange new phenomenon, the causal origin of which is\na puzzle. Suppose we have a mutation, where although we can quantify\nover large numbers we cannot predict at an individual level. There is\nno immediate subsumption beneath law, and therefore there is no reason\nto think that at this level it was necessary. Let us say, as\nsupposedly happened in the extended royal family of Europe, there was\na mutation to a gene responsible for hemophilia. Is it complex?\nObviously not, for it leads to breakdown rather than otherwise. Hence\nit is appropriate to talk now of chance. There is no design. The\nhemophilia mutation was just an accident.  \nSuppose now that we do have complexity. A rather intricate mineral\npattern in the rocks might qualify here. Suppose we have veins of\nprecious metals set in other materials, the whole being intricate and\nvaried – certainly not a pattern you could simply deduce from\nthe laws of physics or chemistry or geology or whatever. Nor would one\nthink of it as being a breakdown mess, as one might a bad mutation. Is\nthis now design? Almost certainly not, for there is no way that one\nmight pre-specify such a pattern. It is all a bit ad hoc, and\nnot something which comes across as the result of conscious intention.\nAnd then finally there are phenomena which are complex and specified.\nOne presumes that the microscopical biological apparatuses and\nprocesses discussed by Behe would qualify here. They are not contingent,\nfor they are irreducibly complex. They are design-like for they do\nwhat is needed for the organism in which they are to be found. That is\nto say they are of pre-specified form. And so, having survived the\nexplanatory filter, they are properly considered the product of real\ndesign.  \nNow, with the conceptual argument laid out in full, we are in a\nposition to turn back to Behe and to see how Dembski’s explanatory\nfilter is supposed to let Behe’s god off the hook with respect to the\nproblem of evil. Given the explanatory filter, a bad mutation would\nsurely get caught by the filter half-way down. It would be siphoned\noff to the side as chance, if not indeed simply put down as necessity.\nIt certainly would not pass the specification test. This would mean\nthat a dreadful genetic disease would not be the fault of the\ndesigner, whereas successful complex mechanisms would be to the\ndesigner’s credit. Dembski stresses that these are mutually exclusive\nalternatives. ‘To attribute an event to design is to say that it\ncannot plausibly be referred to either law or chance. In\ncharacterizing design as the set-theoretic complement of the\ndisjunction law-or-chance, one therefore guarantees that these three\nmodes of explanation will be mutually exclusive and exhaustive’\n(Dembski 1998b, 98). \nThe key assumption being made by Dembski is that design and law and\nchance are mutually exclusive. This is the very essence of the\nexplanatory filter. But in real life does one want to make this\nassumption? Suppose that something is put down to chance. Does this\nmean that law is ruled out? Surely not! If one argues that a Mendelian\nmutation is chance, what one means is with respect to that particular\ntheory it is chance, but one may well believe that the mutation came\nabout by normal regular causes and that if these were all known, then\nit would not longer be chance at all but necessity. The point is that\nchance in this case is a confession of ignorance not, as one might\nwell think the case in the quantum world, an assertion about the way\nthat things are. That is, claims about chance are not ontological\nassertions, as presumably claims about designers must be.  \nMore than this, one might well argue that the designer always works\nthrough law. This may be deism and hence no true Christianity –\nsome Christians would insist that God does sometimes intervene in the\nCreation. But truly Christian or not, a deity who always works through\nlaw is certainly not inconsistent with the hypothesis of a designing\nintelligence. The designer may prefer to have things put in motion in\nsuch a way that his/her/its intentions unfurl and reveal themselves as\ntime goes by. The pattern in a piece of cloth made by machine is as\nmuch an object of design as the pattern from cloth produced by a hand\nloom. In other words, in a sense that would conform to the normal\nusage of the terms, one might want to say of something that it is\nproduced by laws, is chance with respect to our knowledge or theory,\nand fits into an overall context of design by the great orderer or\ncreator of things. In short, Dembski’s filter does not let Behe’s\ndesigner off the hook.  \nIf the designer can make – and rightfully takes credit for\n— the very complex and good, then the designer could prevent\n— and by its failure is properly criticized for – the very\nsimple and awful. The problems in theology are as grim as are those in\nscience. (The intelligent design theorists have provided work for many\nphilosophers eager to refute them. Pennock 1988 and Sober 2000 are\ngood places to start. See the entry on \n teleological notions in biology.) \nLet us now try to tackle the somewhat complex issue of the\nrelationship between Intelligent Design Theory and traditional\nCreationism, as discussed earlier in this essay. In significant\nrespects, they are clearly not the same. Most Intelligent Design\nTheorists believe in a long earth history (even the scientific\nestimation of a universe of about 15 billion years in age) and most\naccept overall common descent. In a recent book, The Edge of\nEvolution , Michael Behe has made this point very clear indeed.\nHowever, there are major overlaps, sufficient to encourage some\ncritics (myself included) to refer to Intelligent Design Theory as\n‘Creationism-lite’ (Ruse 2017, 114). \nFirst, politically, the Creationists are more than willing at the\nmoment to let the ID theorists do the blocking. Openly they support\nthe ID movement, believing in taking one step at a time. If ID is\nsuccessful, then is the time to ask for more. A major funding and\nemotional support for the ID movement is the Discovery Institute, a\nprivately-supported think tank in Seattle. One of its prominent\nmembers is University of Chicago educated philosopher Paul Nelson, who\nis a young-earth creationist and a strong believer in the\neschatological significance of Israel. \nSecond, do note that both Creationists and ID enthusiasts are\ncommitted to some form of non-naturalist account of origins. The ties\nof course are stronger. ID enthusiasts pretend to be neutral about the\nIntelligent Designer, but they clearly do not think that he or she is\nnatural. No one pretends that the earth and its denizens are a lab\nexperiment being run by a grad student on Andromeda. In fact, in their\nown correspondence and works written for followers, they make it very\nclear that the Designer is the Christian God of the Gospels. They are\nalways quoting the first chapter of John – “In the\nbeginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was\nGod.” So in both cases we have an evangelical Christian motive\nsetting the agenda on origins. Some ID enthusiasts are quite strong\nliteralists. Johnson for instance thinks that Genesis Chapter Six\nmight be right about their beings giants in early times – a\npoint made much of in Genesis Flood. (Forrest and Gross 2004 do a\nsuperb job of ferreting out much of the unstated biblical foundations\nof Intelligent Design Theory.) \nThird there is the moral factor. There is a very strong streak of\nanti-postmillennialism in the writings of ID theorists. They share the\nsame concern about the moral values of the Creationists –\nanti-abortion, anti-homosexuality, pro-capital punishment, pro-Israel\n(for eschatological reasons) and so forth. Phillip Johnson feels very\nstrongly that the tendency to cross-dress, including apparently women\nwho wear jeans, is a sign of the degenerate state of our society\n(Johnson 2002).  \nIn short, while there are certainly important differences between the\nposition of most literalists and most ID supporters, the strong\noverlap should not be ignored or downplayed. \nCreationism in the sense used in this discussion is still very much a\nlive phenomenon in American culture today – and in other parts\nof the world, like the Canadian West, to which it has been exported.\nPopularity does not imply truth. Scientifically Creationism is\nworthless, philosophically it is confused, and theologically it is\nblinkered beyond repair. The same is true of its offspring,\nIntelligent Design Theory. But do not underestimate its social and\npolitical power. As we move through the second decade of the new\nmillennium, thanks to Johnson and his fellows, there are ongoing\npressures to introduce non-evolutionary ideas into science curricula,\nespecially into the science curricula of publicly funded schools in\nthe United States of America. In 2004, in Dover, Pennsylvania, there\nwas an attempt by the school board to introduce Intelligent Design\nTheory into the biology classrooms of the publicly funded schools. As\nit happens, this was rejected strongly by the federal judge trying the\ncase – a man who was appointed by President George W. Bush no\nless – and the costs of the case will surely deter others from\nrushing to follow the example of this board (who were incidentally\nthen promptly dropped by the voters.) (A lively account of this trial\nis by Lauri Lebo, The Devil in Dover: An Insider’s\nStory of Dogma v. Darwin in Small-Town America. Philosopher\nRobert Pennock argued that IDT is not genuine science, and taking\nsomewhat of a post-modernist stance, philosopher Steven Fuller argued\nthat it as good science as any other. Pennock and Ruse (eds.) 2008 is\nan updated version of Ruse (ed.) 1988, and includes full discussion of\nDover as well as Arkansas.) The battle is not yet over and things\ncould get a lot worse before they get better, if indeed they will get\nbetter.  Already, there are members of the United States Supreme Court\nwho have made it clear that they would receive sympathetically calls\nto push evolution from a preeminent place in science teaching, and\nwith its turn to the right it would be foolish to assume that if a\ncase came its way that Creationism or ID theory would be rejected as\nunsuitable for public school classroom use. If additions are made,\nwith present appointments, we could find that — nearly a century\nafter the Scopes Trial, when the Fundamentalists were perceived as\nfigures of fun – Creationism in one form or another finally\ntakes its place in the classroom. \nUnfortunately at the moment, those opposed to Creationism are spending\nmore of their energies quarreling among themselves than fighting the\nopposition. There is a crop of “new atheists”, including\nthe biologist and popular writer Richard Dawkins (2006) and the\nphilosopher Daniel Dennett (2005) who are not only against religion\nbut also against those – including non-believers – who do\nnot share their hostility. At least since the time of the Arkansas\ntrial, many fighting Creationism (including Gould 1999, 2002; Ruse\n2001) have argued that true religion and science do not\nconflict. Hence, evolutionists (including non-believers) should make\ncommon cause with liberal Christians, who share their hatred of\ndogmatic Christian fundamentalism. Prominent among those so arguing\ninclude the author of this piece, as well as Eugenie Scott of the\nNational Center for Science Education. They argue that in their\nhostility to religion, the new atheists get close to making their own\nviews quasi-religious – certainly they argue that Darwinism is\nincompatible with religion – and hence ripe for the\nCreationists’ complaint that if Creationism is not to be taught in\nschools (because it violates the U.S. Constitution’s separation of\nChurch and State), then neither should evolution be so taught. It is\nto be hoped that this quarrel will soon subside.  \nWe conclude by noting four recent developments in the Creationism\ndebate. First, a number of well-known philosophers have started to\nmake encouraging sounds about Intelligent Design Theory. Calvinist\nphilosopher Alvin Plantinga has long been a critic of naturalism and\nnow (in a work based on his 2005 Gifford Lectures at St Andrew’s\nUniversity in Scotland) he extends this critique to Darwinian\nevolutionary theory, arguing that the evidence in its favor is scanty\n(Plantinga 2011). He hedges somewhat on alternatives, but gives a very\nsympathetic reading of the thinking of Michael Behe and clearly finds\nmuch in such a position that meshes nicely with his own theological\nconcerns. Coming from a very different perspective, as he is openly\natheistic, Thomas Nagel (2008) likewise finds much in modern biology\nthat worries and disappoints him—he makes special reference to\nwhat seems to him to be a total inability to give a naturalistic\nexplanation of the origin of life—and although obviously he does\nnot want to endorse Intelligent Design Theory, given the supposition\nthat it is God who is doing the designing, nevertheless he argues that\nIntelligent Design Theory should be taught as an alternative in\nstate-supported schools in the USA. Recently, in a full-length work,\nMind and Cosmos, he has continued this attack, arguing (2011,\n7) that “the idea that we have in our possession the basic tools\nneeded to understand [the world] is no more credible now than it was\nin Aristotle’s day”, thereby implying that the work of\nCopernicus, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and Darwin has not led to\nany new tools needed to understand the world. Backing Nagel, at least\nin his visceral dislike of Darwinism, is another prominent American\nphilosopher Jerry Fodor, whose recent, co-authored book is titled\nWhat Darwin Got Wrong. Even if (with reason) Fodor might\nargue that he is no Creationist, his position is grist for their mill.\nA more thoughtful critique of Darwinism might allay this worry.  \nIt is difficult to know how seriously one is expected to take these\ncriticisms. Let it be said that one would have a great deal more\nrespect for the arguments and conclusions put forward if they had been\ninformed by contemporary writings on evolutionary theory, for\ninstance, the brilliant and painstaking work of the husband and wife\nteam of Peter and Rosemary Grant (2007), who have spent decades\nstudying the evolution and speciation of finches in the Galapagos\nArchipelago. Or the groundbreaking work of people like Francisco Ayala\n(2009) as they study the molecular factors involved in ongoing\ndevelopment and change. Not to mention the seminal studies of Brian\nHall (1999) and Sean Carroll (2005) on the ways in which individual\ndevelopment can get reflected in long-term changes (so-called\n“evo-devo”). Though Richard Dawkins can put people off\nwhen he holds forth on matters philosophical or theological, that is\nno good reason simply to dismiss without argument his scientific\nclaims, as Plantinga often does. Likewise, it is true indeed that no\none yet has been able to spell out the full story of the origin of\nlife, but this doesn’t justify Nagel’s failure to mention that a huge\namount now is known about life’s origins, most especially about the\ncrucial role played by the secondary ribonucleic acid RNA (rather than\nthe more familiar DNA) (Ruse and Travis (eds.) 2009). Until the criticisms\nput forward by Nagel, Plantinga, Fodor, etc. do start to take\nseriously modern science, we might justifiably continue to take them\nless than seriously.  \nOne observation to make about these criticisms is that they are put\nforward by philosophers in the analytic tradition, which in its early\ndays involved some opposition to Darwinism (Cunningham 1996). This\ngoes back to Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, neither of whom\nhad much time for the theory and (in Russell’s case at least) was\nmirrored by a strong dislike of American Pragmatism, a school of\nthought that did take Darwin very seriously (Ruse 2009). In both the\ncase of Russell and Wittgenstein this opposition is based primarily on\na mistaken identification of the thinking of Charles Darwin with that\nof\n Herbert Spencer.\n It was the latter who was much given to seeing evolutionary processes\nas justifying extraneous claims about the necessity of struggle and so\nforth, views that both Russell and Wittgenstein viewed with as little\nenthusiasm as did William Jennings Bryan. Russell learnt his dislike\nof evolution as applied to philosophy from his teacher Henry Sidgwick\nand Wittgenstein (like other European-born philosophers like Karl\nPopper) from the general culture of their youth. Significantly, those\nphilosophers of the English-speaking tradition of the twentieth\ncentury who have had kind words for Darwin – W.V.O. Quine,\nRichard Rorty, and Thomas Kuhn to name three – have all been\nsympathetic to Pragmatism in one form or another (Ruse 2018b,\n2018c; see also, the entry on \n pragmatism). \nSecond among new or revived discussions of Creationism and its various\naspects, one question often asked is why evolution in particular\nraises such ire in evangelicals and related religionists. The Bible\nstates that the sun stopped for Joshua and yet no one today worries\nabout the theological implications of the Copernican Revolution.\nMichael Ruse particularly, has argued strongly that the main reason\nfor the conflict is that often evolutionists – Darwinian\nevolutionists – turn their secular science into a religion, with\nmoral imperatives and much more (Ruse forthcoming). The argument is\nthat, as opposed to the Christian notion of Providence, where we are\nentirely in the hands of God, such evolutionists are progressionists,\nthinking that change is in our hands and can be for the better. In\ntheological terms, Creationists tend to be premillennialists,\nbelieving that Jesus will return and rule for a thousand years and all\nwe can do is get ready for this for instance through converting\nothers, as opposed to evolutionists who are postmillennialists,\nthinking (metaphorically) that paradise is to be made down here by us,\nbefore there is any appropriate talk of a Second Coming.  \nThomas Henry Huxley, his grandson Julian S. Huxley, and today’s most\neminent Darwinian evolutionist, Edward O. Wilson of Harvard, have been\nor are open in their secular religion building. Against the\nCreationist urge to save souls, they want to improve science education\n(THH), support public mega-works (JSH), and promote biodiversity\n(EOW). There is a strong odor of this secular religion building around\nthe New Atheists, like Richard Dawkins (2006), despite denials.\nExpectedly, this thesis has not gone down well with many\nevolutionists, and conversely has been welcomed by Creationists who\nhave long made this claim. It should be noted that the arguments do\nnot and are not intended to give comfort to Creationism as such. The\nclaim by Ruse and others (for instance Miller 1999 and Pennock 1998)\nis that there is a good, scientific theory of evolution, based on\nDarwin’s mechanism of natural selection. They are not offering a\nthesis about the science, but more one almost sociological in trying\nto understand the tension. If the thesis proves true, then\nevolutionists themselves are in a better position to defend themselves\nand to defend their science. \nThird among developments in Creationist thinking, especially since the\nfailure at Dover, we find somewhat of a shift in strategy by religious\ncritics of Darwinism. Now it is the moral issues that are brought to\nthe fore. For instance, Richard Weikart (2004) claims that “no\nmatter how crooked the road was from Darwin to Hitler, clearly\nDarwinism and eugenics smoothed the path for Nazi ideology, especially\nfrom the Nazi stress on expansion, war, racial struggle, and racial\nextermination.” In a similar vein, in the 2008 film\nExpelled—a work very favorable to Intelligent Design\nTheory—the link is drawn explicitly. Philosopher David Berlinski\nis blunt: “if you open Mein Kampf and read it, especially if you\ncan read it in German, the correspondence between Darwinian ideas and\nNazi ideas just leaps from the page.” In other words, if you are\ninto Darwin, you are into National Socialism.  \nAs always, as soon as one starts to look at things a little more\nclosely, the story becomes more complex (Richards 2013).  Let us agree\nthat something had to lead to Hitler and that given the racism that\ninfects huge amounts of nineteenth century thinking about\nhumankind—including Darwin’s Descent of Man—one\nshould not give evolutionary theory a knee-jerk absolution. In fact,\nsome early twentieth century writers on war and strife, clearly\ninspired in some fashion by Darwin, give one great pause for\nreflection. Listen to the sometime member of the German High Command,\nGeneral Friedrich von Bernhardi. Darwinism endorses war endorses that\nwhich is morally good or acceptable. “Struggle is therefore a\nuniversal law of Nature, and the instinct of self-preservation which\nleads to struggle is acknowledged to be a natural condition of\nexistence. ‘Man is a fighter’” (von Bernhardi 1912,\n13). And “might gives the right to occupy or to conquer. Might\nis at once the supreme right, and the dispute as to what is right is\ndecided by the arbitration of war. War gives a biologically just\ndecision, since its decisions rest on the very nature of things”\n(ibid., p. 15). Hence “It may be that a growing people\ncannot win colonies from uncivilized races, and yet the State wishes\nto retain the surplus population which the mother-country can no\nlonger feed. Then the only course left is to acquire the necessary\nterritory by war.”  \nYet when one turns to Hitler himself, one soon sees that any\nsimilarities are superficial. One doubts very much that the (to be\ngenerous) ill-educated Fuhrer had ever read Darwin, and his concerns\nare not that of the old English evolutionist. \n“Blood poisoning”! The worry here is about the Jews and\ntheir supposed ill-effects on pure races. The Jews do not get a\nmention in the Descent of Man (1871), and although Darwin\nsupposes that white races tend to wipe out others, it is not from any\nmental or physical superiority, but because we can tolerate their\ndiseases but they cannot tolerate ours! And this is all because whites\nhave had a bigger pool of variants to draw on than have others.  \nA final brief (fourth) comment is that increasingly the struggle\nagainst Creationism and its various offspring is rapidly becoming a\nworld-wide struggle. Leading historian of the Creationism movement,\nRonald Numbers (2006), is particularly concerned about this fact. Not\nonly do we find Creationism on the rise in countries like the\nNetherlands (where, with its large conservative Protestant population,\nsuch a rise is not altogether unexpected) but we find enthusiasm in\nnon-Christian cultures, especially in cultures where Islam is a major\nfactor. The exact reasons for such a rise have, as yet, been barely\nexplored, but Numbers is surely right in thinking that theology\nprobably plays but a minor role, and more sociological\nfactors—dislike of the hegemony of the West and the role that\nscience and technology play in such dominance—are probably very\nsignificant.  \nThe fact is that, for whatever reason, if anything Creationism is on\nthe rise. And with that somber point, this is perhaps a good place to\ndraw this discussion to a close. If this essay persuades even one\nperson to take up the fight against so awful an outcome, then it will\nhave served its purpose.","contact.mail":"mruse@fsu.edu","contact.domain":"fsu.edu"}]
