This broad definition is\ndiscernible, with minor variations, in the works of contemporary\nauthors as well as in the entry “citoyen” in\nDiderot’s and d’Alembert’s\nEncyclopédie\n [1753].[1]\n Notwithstanding this common starting-point and certain shared\n references,[2]\n the differences between 18th century discussions and\ncontemporary debates are significant. The\nencyclopédiste’s main preoccupation,\nunderstandable for one living in a monarchy, was the relationship\nbetween the concepts ‘citizen’ and ‘subject’.\nWere they the same (as Hobbes asserted) or contradictory (as a reading\nof Aristotle\n suggested)?[3]\n This issue is less central today as we tend to take for granted that\na liberal democratic regime is the appropriate starting-point for our\nreflections. This does not mean, however, that the concept has become\nuncontroversial. After a long period of relative calm, there has been\na dramatic upsurge in philosophical interest in citizenship since the\nearly\n 1990s.[4]\n \n\nTwo broad challenges have led theorists to re-examine the concept:\nfirst, the need to acknowledge the internal diversity of contemporary\nliberal democracies; second, the pressures wrought by globalization on\nthe territorial, sovereign state. We will focus on each of these two\nchallenges, examining how they prompted new discussions and\ndisagreements.\n\n\nThe entry has four sections. The first examines the main dimensions of\ncitizenship (legal, political, identity) and sees how they are\ninstantiated in very different ways within the two dominant models:\nthe republican and the liberal. The feminist critique of the\nprivate/public distinction, central to both models, serves as a bridge\nto the entry’s second section. It focuses upon two important\ndebates about the implications of social and cultural pluralism to\nconceptions of citizenship: first, should they recognize, rather than\ntranscend, difference and, if so, does this recognition affect\ncitizenship’s purported role in strengthening social cohesion?\nSecond, how are we to understand the relation between citizenship and\nnationality under conditions of pluralism? The third section discusses\nthe challenges which globalisation poses to theories of citizenship.\nThese theories have long taken for granted the idea that\ncitizenship’s necessary context is the sovereign, territorial\nstate. This premise is being increasingly contested by those who\nquestion the state’s right to determine who is accepted as a\nmember and/or claim that citizenship can be meaningful beyond the\nboundaries of the nation-state. The entry’s fourth and final\nsection looks at how recent discussions in the fields of disability\nrights and animal rights challenge a basic premise of the literature\non citizenship since Aristotle: the idea that discursive rationality\nconstitutes a threshold condition to citizenship. \n\nThe concept of citizenship is composed of three main elements or\ndimensions (Cohen 1999; Kymlicka and Norman 2000; Carens 2000). The\nfirst is citizenship as legal status, defined by civil, political and\nsocial rights. Here, the citizen is the legal person free to act\naccording to the law and having the right to claim the law’s\nprotection. It need not mean that the citizen takes part in the\nlaw’s formulation, nor does it require that rights be uniform\nbetween citizens. The second considers citizens specifically as\npolitical agents, actively participating in a society’s\npolitical institutions. The third refers to citizenship as membership\nin a political community that furnishes a distinct source of\nidentity. \nIn many ways, the identity dimension is the least straightforward of\nthe three. Authors tend to include under this heading many different\nthings related to identity, both individual and collective, and social\n integration.[5]\n Arguably, this is inescapable since citizens’ subjective sense\nof belonging, sometimes called the “psychological”\ndimension of citizenship (Carens 2000,\n 166),[6]\n necessarily affects the strength of the political community’s\ncollective identity. If enough citizens display a robust sense of\nbelonging to the same political community, social cohesion is\nobviously strengthened. However, since many other factors can impede\nor encourage it, social integration should be seen as an important\ngoal (or\n problem[7])\n that citizenship aims to achieve (or resolve), rather than as one of\nits elements. As we will see, one crucial test for any conception of\ncitizenship is whether or not it can be said to contribute to social\nintegration. \nRelations between the three dimensions are complex: the rights a\ncitizen enjoys will partly define the range of available political\nactivities while explaining how citizenship can be a source of\nidentity by strengthening her sense of self-respect (Rawls 1972, 544).\nA strong civic identity can itself motivate citizens to participate\nactively in their society’s political life. That distinct groups\nwithin a state do not share the same sense of identity towards\n‘their’ political community (or communities) can be a\nreason to argue in favour of a differentiated allocation of rights\n(Carens 2000, 168–173). \nAs we will see, differences between conceptions of citizenship centre\naround four disagreements: over the precise definition of each element\n(legal, political and identity); over their relative importance; over\nthe causal and/or conceptual relations between them; over appropriate\nnormative standards. \nDiscussions about citizenship usually have, as their point of\nreference, one of two models: the republican or the liberal. The\nrepublican model’s sources can be found in the writings of\nauthors like Aristotle, Tacitus, Cicero, Machiavelli, Harrington and\nRousseau, and in distinct historical experiences: from Athenian\ndemocracy and Republican Rome to the Italian city-states and\nworkers’ councils. \nThe key principle of the republican model is civic self-rule, embodied\nin classical institutions and practices like the rotation of offices,\nunderpinning Aristotle’s characterization of the citizen as one\ncapable of ruling and being ruled in turn. Citizens are, first and\nforemost, “those who share in the holding of office”\n(Aristotle Politics, 1275a8). Civic self-rule is also at the\nheart of Rousseau’s project in the Contrat Social: it\nis their co-authoring of the laws via the general will that makes\ncitizens free and laws\n legitimate.[8]\n Active participation in processes of deliberation and decision-making\nensures that individuals are citizens, not\n subjects.[9]\n In essence, the republican model emphasizes the second dimension of\ncitizenship, that of political agency. \nThe liberal model’s origins are traceable to the Roman Empire\nand early-modern reflections on Roman law (Walzer 1989, 211). The\nEmpire’s expansion resulted in citizenship rights being extended\nto conquered peoples, profoundly transforming the concept’s\nmeaning. Citizenship meant being protected by the law rather than\nparticipating in its formulation or execution. It became an\n“important but occasional identity, a legal status rather than a\nfact of everyday life” (Walzer 1989, 215). The focus here is\nobviously the first dimension: citizenship is primarily understood as\na legal status rather than as a political office. It now\n“denotes membership in a community of shared or common law,\nwhich may or may not be identical with a territorial community”\n(Pocock 1995, 37). The Roman experience shows that the legal dimension\nof citizenship is potentially inclusive and indefinitely\nextensible. \nThe liberal tradition, which developed from the 17th\ncentury onwards, understands citizenship primarily as a legal status:\npolitical liberty is important as a means to protecting individual\nfreedoms from interference by other individuals or the authorities\nthemselves. But citizens exercise these freedoms primarily in the\nworld of private associations and attachments, rather than in the\npolitical domain. \nAt first glance, the two models present us with a clear set of\nalternatives: citizenship as a political office or a legal status;\ncentral to an individual’s sense of self or as an\n“occasional identity”. The citizen appears either as the\nprimary political agent or as an individual whose private activities\nleave little time or inclination to engage actively in politics,\nentrusting the business of law-making to representatives. If the\nliberal model of citizenship dominates contemporary constitutional\ndemocracies, the republican critique of the private\ncitizen’s passivity and insignificance is still alive and\nwell. \nRepublicans have problems of their own. First and foremost is a\nconcern, often repeated since Benjamin Constant, that their ideal has\nbecome largely obsolete in the changed circumstances of the\n“grands États modernes” (Constant\n1819).  Aiming to realize the original republican ideal in the\npresent context would be a disaster, as was the Jacobins’\nattempt during the French revolution (Walzer 1989, 211). Today’s\ncitizens will not be Romans: first, the scale and complexity of modern\nstates seem to preclude the kind of civic engagement required by the\nrepublican model. If an individual’s chances of having an impact\nas an active citizen are close to nil, then it makes more sense for\nhim to commit himself to non-political activities, be they economic,\nsocial or familial. His identity as citizen is not central to his\nsense of self and politics is only one of his many interests (Constant\n1819, 316). Second, the heterogeneity of modern states does not allow\nthe kind of “moral unity” and mutual trust that has been\nprojected onto the ancient polis, qualities deemed necessary\nto the functioning of republican institutions (Walzer 1989, 214). But\nif ancient virtue is irrecoverable, the republican model may still act\ntoday as “a benchmark that we appeal to when assessing how well\nour institutions and practices are functioning” (Miller 2000,\n84). In essence, this involves a reformulation of the model,\nquestioning some of its original premises while holding onto the ideal\nof the citizen as an active political agent. \nInstead of opposing the two models, we could reasonably see them as\ncomplementary. Political liberty, as Constant pointed out, is the\nnecessary guarantee of individual liberty. Echoing Constant, Michael\nWalzer considers that the two conceptions “go hand in\nhand” since “the security provided by the authorities\ncannot just be enjoyed; it must itself be secured, and sometimes\nagainst the authorities themselves. The passive enjoyment of\ncitizenship requires, at least intermittently, the activist politics\nof citizens” (Walzer 1989, 217). There are times when\nindividuals need only be “private citizens” and\nothers when they must become “private citizens”\n(Ackermann 1988). But can we expect passive spectators of political\nlife to become active citizens should the need arise? This is no easy\nquestion and may explain why Constant ended his famous essay by\ninsisting that the regular exercise of political liberty is the surest\nmeans of moral improvement, opening citizens’ minds and spirits\nto the public interest, and to the importance of defending their\nfreedoms. Such habituation underpins their capacity and willingness to\nprotect their liberties and the institutions that support them\n(Constant 1819,\n 327–328).[10] \nSince the 1970s, feminist theorists have sharply criticized the\nrepublican and liberal models’ shared assumption of a rigid\nseparation between the private and the public spheres. Their critique\nhas provided the impetus to the development of alternative conceptions\nof politics and citizenship. \nIn its classical formulation, the republican conception sees the\npublic/political sphere as the realm of liberty and equality: it is\nthere that free, male citizens engage with their peers and deliberate\nover the common good, deciding what is just or unjust, advantageous or\nharmful (Aristotle Politics, 1253a11). The political space\nmust be protected from the private sphere, defined as the domain of\nnecessity and inequality, where the material reproduction of the\npolis is secured. Women, associated with the ‘natural\nworld’ of reproduction, are denied citizenship and relegated to\nthe household. \nFeminists have criticized this rigid division as mythical since both\nthe separation itself and the radically unequal conception of the\nhousehold that it presupposed “were clearly the outcome of\npolitical decisions made in the public sphere” (Okin 1992, 60).\nIf the division ostensibly made it possible for citizens to engage\nwith each other as equals, feminists doubt whether it ever was the\nideal way of achieving this goal. Hence Susan Okin’s question to\nrepublicans: “Which is likely to produce better citizens,\ncapable of acting as each other’s equals? Having to deal with\nthings part of the time — even the ‘mundane’ things\nof daily life? Or treating most people as things?”\n(Okin 1992, 64–65). An egalitarian family is a much more fertile\nground for equal citizens than one organized like a school for\ndespotism (J.S. Mill); if this means that the political space cannot\nremain insulated from the world of things, there’s no great\nloss. \nThe liberal model, for its part, gives primacy to the private sphere.\nPolitical liberty is seen in instrumental terms: the formal rights of\nindividuals secure the private sphere from outside interference,\nallowing the free pursuit of their particular interests (Dietz 1998,\n380–81). But the neutral language of Lockean egalitarian\nindividualism hides the reality of women’s subjection:\n“woman’s sphere” can be read as “male\nproperty” since wives are described as naturally subordinated to\ntheir husbands. Here as well, the division between private and public\nhas prevented women from gaining access to the public (Pateman 1989,\n120; Dietz 1998, 380–81; Okin 1991, 118). \nSince the public and private “are, and always have been,\ninextricably connected” (Okin 1992,69), the upshot of the\nfeminist critique is not simply to make models of citizenship\ninclusive by recognizing that women are individuals or to acknowledge\nthat they too can be citizens. Rather, we must see how laws and\npolicies structure personal circumstances (e.g. laws about rape and\nabortion, child-care policies, allocation of welfare benefits, etc.)\nand how some ‘personal problems’ have wider significance\nand can only be solved collectively through political action (Pateman\n1989, 131). This does not make the distinction irrelevant and the\ncategories collapsible. But it does mean that the boundaries between\npublic and private should be seen as a social construction subject to\nchange and contestation and that their hierarchical characterization\nshould be resisted. \nIf we discard the abstractions that characterize both the classical\nand the liberal conceptions, the citizen sheds his “political\nlion skin” (Pateman 1989, 92 quoting Marx 1843) and appears as\n“situated” in a social world characterized by differences\nof gender, class, language, race, ethnicity, culture, etc. To accept\nthat politics cannot and should not be insulated from\nprivate/social/economic life is not to dissolve the political, but,\nrather, to revive it since anything is as political as citizens choose\nto make it. As we will see now, this contextualized conception of the\npolitical has informed much of the criticism aimed at the universalist\nmodel of citizenship and has inspired the formulation of a\ndifferentialist alternative.  \nThe universalist or unitary model defines citizenship primarily as a\nlegal status through which an identical set of civil, political and\nsocial rights are accorded to all members of the polity. T.H.\nMarshall’s seminal essay “Citizenship and Social\nClass” is the main reference for this model, which became\nprogressively dominant in post-World War II liberal democracies.\nMarshall’s central thesis was that the 20th\ncentury’s expansion of social rights was crucial to the working\nclass’s progressive integration in British society (Marshall\n 1950).[11]\n Similar stories were told in other Western democracies: the\ndevelopment of welfare policies aimed at softening the impact of\nunemployment, sickness and distress was fundamental to political and\nsocial stability. The apparent success of the post-war welfare state\nin securing social cohesion was a strong argument in favour of a\nconception of citizenship focused on the securing of equal civil,\npolitical and social\n rights.[12] \nThe universalist model was aggressively targeted at the end of the\n1980s as the moral and cultural pluralism of contemporary liberal\nsocieties elicited increasing theoretical attention. Scepticism\ntowards the universalist model was spurred by concerns that the\nextension of citizenship rights to groups previously excluded had not\ntranslated into equality and full integration, notably in the case of\nAfro-Americans and women (Young 1989; Williams 1998). A questioning of\nthe causal relation assumed between citizenship as a uniform legal\nstatus and civic integration followed. \nCritics argued that the model proves exclusionary if one interprets\nuniversal citizenship as requiring (a) the transcendence of\nparticular, situated perspectives to achieve a common, general point\nof view and (b) the formulation of laws and policies that are\ndifference-blind (Young 1989). The first requirement seems\nparticularly odious once generality is exposed as a myth covering the\nmajority’s culture and conventions. The call to transcend\nparticularity too often translates into the imposition of the majority\nperspective on minorities.  The second requirement may produce\nmore inequality rather than less since the purported neutrality of\ndifference-blind institutions often belies an implicit bias towards\nthe needs, interests and identities of the majority group. This bias\noften creates specific burdens for members of minorities, i.e. more\ninequality. \nCritics of this (failed) universalism have proposed an alternative\nconception of citizenship based on the acknowledgment of the political\nrelevance of difference (cultural, gender, class, race, etc.). This\nmeans, first, the recognition of the pluralist character of the\ndemocratic public, composed of many perspectives, none of which should\nbe considered a priori more legitimate. Second, it entails\nthat, in certain cases at least, equal respect may justify\ndifferential treatment and the recognition of special minority\nrights. \nOnce these two points are conceded, the question becomes when, and for\nwhat reason, the recognition of particular rights is either justified\nor illegitimate. This discussion is necessarily context specific,\nfocusing on concrete demands made by groups in particular\ncircumstances, and shies away from easy generalizations. It has led to\nan array of publications covering issues ranging from the fate of\n‘minorities within minorities’ to how tolerant liberal\nsocieties should be of illiberal groups,\n etc.[13] \nBut the model of differentiated citizenship has generated its own\nshare of criticisms and queries, particularly with regards to the\noverall effects of its implementation. Critics focus on its impact on\nthe possibility of a common political practice. Consider Iris\nYoung’s vision of a heterogeneous public where participants\nstart from their “situated positions” and attempt to\nconstruct a dialogue across differences. This dialogue requires\nparticipants to be ‘public-spirited’ — open to the\nclaims of others and not single-mindedly self-interested. Unlike\ninterest group pluralism, which does not require justifying\none’s interest as right or as compatible with social justice,\nparticipants are supposed to use deliberation to come to a decision\nthat they determine to be best or more just (Young 1989, 267). While\nwelcoming Young’s conception of the democratic public, one may\ndoubt that the policies and institutions associated with a\ndifferentiated model of citizenship would either motivate or enable\ncitizens to engage in such dialogue. \nThis analysis is tied to a wider literature on the virtues required of\ncitizens in pluralist liberal democracies and on ways to favour their\ndevelopment. Stephen Macedo (1990), William Galston (1991), and Eamonn\nCallan (1997), among others, have all emphasized the importance of\npublic reasonableness. This virtue is defined as the ability to listen\nto others and formulate one’s own position in a way that is\nsensitive to, and respectful of, the different experiences and\nidentities of fellow citizens, acknowledging that these differences\nmay affect political views. But how and where does one develop this\nand related virtue(s)? If a differentiated model of citizenship simply\nallows individuals and groups to retreat into their particular\nenclaves, how are they to develop either the motivation or the\ncapacity to participate in a common forum? \nOne immediately understands political philosophers’ continued\ninterest in education over the last twenty years. If we want citizens\nof diverse societies to develop the ‘right’ attitudes and\ndispositions, should we not encourage a common education, school them\nin a curriculum that teaches respect for difference, while providing\nthe necessary skills for democratic discussion across these\ndifferences? If so, should we not resist demands for separate schools\nor dispensations for minorities? How flexible should public schools be\ntowards minorities if the goal is to make them feel welcome and ensure\nthat they do not retreat into parochial institutions? (Callan 1997;\nGutmann 1999; Brighouse 2000, 2006) \nCritics of differentiated citizenship have also argued that policies\nthat break with difference-blind universalism can only weaken the\nintegrative function of citizenship. If embracing multicultural and\nminority rights means that citizens lose their sense of collective\nbelonging, it may also affect their willingness to compromise and make\nsacrifices for each other. Citizens may then develop a purely\nstrategic attitude towards those of different backgrounds. As Joseph\nCarens puts it: “From this perspective, the danger of […]\ndifferentiated citizenship is that the emphasis [it] place[s] on the\nrecognition and institutionalization of difference could undermine the\nconditions that make a sense of common identification and thus\nmutuality possible” (Carens 2000, 193). Critics of Aboriginal\ndemands for self-government rights have pressed this concern with\nforce (Cairns, 2000). \nIn addressing these and similar queries, Will Kymlicka and Wayne\nNorman have broadly distinguished between three types of demands:\nspecial representation rights (for disadvantaged groups),\nmulticultural rights (for immigrant and religious groups) and\nself-government rights (for national minorities) (Kymlicka and Norman\n1994; Kymlicka, 1995, 176–187). The first two are really demands\nfor inclusion into mainstream society: special representation rights\nare best understood as (temporary) measures to alleviate the obstacles\nthat minorities and/or historically disadvantaged groups face in\nhaving their voices heard in majoritarian democratic institutions.\nReforming the electoral system to ensure the better representation of\nminorities may raise all sorts of difficult issues, but the aim is\nclearly integration into the larger political society, not\nisolation. \nSimilarly, the demands for multicultural rights made by immigrant\ngroups are usually aimed either at exemption from laws and policies\nthat disadvantage them because of their religious practices or at\nensuring public support for particular education and/or cultural\ninitiatives to maintain and transmit elements of their cultural and\nreligious heritage. These should be seen as measures designed to\nfacilitate their inclusion in the larger society rather than as a way\nto avoid integration. It is only claims to self-government rights,\ngrounded in a principle of self-determination, that potentially\nendanger civic integration since their aim is not to achieve a greater\npresence in the institutions of the central government, but to gain a\ngreater share of power and legislative jurisdiction for institutions\ncontrolled by national minorities. \nAddressing such demands through a simple reaffirmation of the ideal of\ncommon citizenship is not a serious option. It may only aggravate the\nalienation felt by members of these groups and feed into more radical\npolitical projects, including secession. Further, to say that\nrecognition of self-government rights may weaken the bonds of the\nlarger community is to suppose that these bonds exist in the first\nplace and that a significant proportion of national minorities\nidentify with the larger society. Yet such assumptions are often\noverly optimistic. If these bonds do not exist, or remain quite weak,\nwhat is needed is the construction of a genuine dialogue between the\nmajority society and minorities over what constitutes just relations,\nthrough which difference can be recognized. The hope is that such\ndialogue would strengthen, rather than weaken, their relationship by\nputting it on firmer moral and political grounds (Carens 2000,\n197). \nThis broadly positive assessment of the effects of differentiated\ncitizenship on civic integration is increasingly being questioned. On\nthe one hand, left-leaning authors have complained that multicultural\npolitics make egalitarian policies more difficult to achieve by\ndiverting “political effort away from universalistic\ngoals” and by undermining efforts to build a broadly based\ncoalition supporting ambitious policies of redistribution (Barry 2001,\n325). On the other hand, events like September 11, the Mohammed\ncartoons affair (2005, see Klausen 2009), riots in the banlieux\nof Paris (2005), London (2011) and Stockholm (2017), as well as a\nseries of terrorist attacks in Europe have led to a backlash against\nmulticultural policies. The belief that demands for multicultural\nrights are really demands for inclusion in the larger society has been\nthrown into doubt, notably in the case of Muslim immigrants. \nTo allay fears about the supposed trade-off between cultural\nrecognition and redistribution, supporters of multiculturalism cite\nthe lack of empirical studies establishing a negative correlation\nbetween the adoption of multicultural policies and a robust welfare\nstate (Banting and Kymlicka 2006, Banting 2005). Further, claims that\nthe push for multicultural policies diverts energies, time and\nresources from the struggle for redistributive policies assume that\nthe pursuit of justice is zero-sum, seemingly a false generalization.\nOn the contrary, it can be argued that: “the pursuit of justice\nin one dimension helps build a broader political culture that supports\nstruggles for justice in other dimensions” (Kymlicka 2009). In\nthe same vein, to claim that paying attention to issues of cultural\nrecognition tends to warp our sensitivity to economic injustice is to\nassume that we can only be sensitive to one dimension of injustice at\na time. But it is equally plausible that sensitivity to a particular\ntype of injustice may favour, rather than hinder, sensitivity to other\ninjustices. \nIn response to concerns about social and civic unity, liberal\ndemocracies have introduced a series of policies aimed at better\nsecuring the integration of immigrants: requiring minimal linguistic\nproficiency in the majority language as a condition of citizenship or\nbanning religious symbols from public schools. These policies have\nsometimes been heralded as signalling the development of a\n‘muscular liberalism’ (Former British PM David Cameron,\nquoted by Joppke 2014) as an alternative to multiculturalism. They\nhave been hotly debated from the perspective of factual efficacy as\nwell as from a normative perspective. The introduction of\n‘citizenship tests’ for resident immigrants, in\nparticular, has led to a vigorous debate among normative theorists:\nunder what conditions and in what form can they be justified? Some,\nlike Joseph Carens (2010a) have argued that they are basically unjust,\nno matter what form they take. If one understands membership in a\nsociety to flow from long-term residence, as Carens does, then any\ntest that “prevents a full member of a society from becoming a\ncitizen unjustly deprives her of an entitlement to citizenship”\n(Mason 2014, 143). Other theorists have taken a more positive view of\nthe tests: seeing them as an incentive for immigrants to acquire basic\nknowledge of liberal-democratic principles, as well as the political\ninstitutions and history of the host country. As such, they also serve\nas an “implicit statement of the nation’s political\nvalues” (Miller 2016, 138). On this view, as long as certain\nconditions are met, so that the tests are neither too difficult nor\ntoo expensive and give applicants the possibility to take them again\nif they fail, etc., then there is nothing really objectionable to them\n(though the empirical question of their efficacy remains open). In\ncontrast, tests that purport to ‘weed out’ immigrants who\ndo not share ‘our’ liberal values are generally held to be\nincompatible with liberal principles. This has led some theorists to\nquestion how ‘muscular’ can liberalism really be (Joppke\n2014).  \nA number of liberal democracies have responded to the upsurge of\nterrorist acts by introducing legislation that gives the state the\npower to withdraw the citizenship of those convicted or suspected of\nterrorist\n activities.[14]\n Given the principle recognized in international law that no one\nshould be left stateless, these legislations usually apply only to\ncitizens holding dual or multiple citizenships. Denationalisation is\nsometimes described in this context as “extending the\nfunctionality of immigration law in counter-terrorism” (Macklin\n2015, see also Barry and Ferracioli 2016). Though states cannot deport\ntheir own citizens, denationalisation allows them to first withdraw\ncitizenship and then deport. These legislations raise a number of\nnormative issues. Firstly, they seem to contradict the basic idea that\ncitizenship is a right, not a privilege (Gibney 2013, Macklin 2015).\nSecondly, since they weaken the security normally attached to the\nstatus of citizen, they can be described as demoting citizenship\n“to another category of permanent residence” (Macklin\n2015). Thirdly, it is argued that by targeting only dual (or multiple)\ncitizens, the new legislations treat them as second-class citizens\n(Gibney 2013, 653). In contrast, other theorists insist that that the\nparticular nature of terrorist crimes (akin to acts of war against the\nstate) warrants this kind of response (Schuck 2015; Joppke 2015).\nConcerning the worry that the legislations discriminate against dual\ncitizens, the response is that the difference in treatment between\nmono-citizens and dual citizens is justified, since the consequences\nof denationalisation are also very different in each case. Individuals\nholding a single citizenship are the only ones facing statelessness as\na consequence of denationalisation (Barry and Ferracioli 2016). Where\nparticipants in the debate find common ground is in their shared\ncriticism of the specific form that some legislations have taken, most\nnotably the 2006 British Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act. In\nthe wake of the 7 July 2005 Tube bombing in London, the new Act\nrelaxed the standard for deprivation present in the 2002 legislation\n(the “vital interests of the state”test) with a much\nweaker and vague standard: that the individual’s holding\ncitizenship is “not conducive to the public good” (quoted\nby Gibney 2013, 650). Whether this, or any such measure, has any\nsignificant deterrent effect is very much open to question.  \nWorries about the ability and willingness of Muslim immigrants to\nintegrate into Western liberal democracies explain a persisting\ninterest in reflecting on the complex relations between the secular\nliberal political cultures dominant in the West and religion. Research\nhas focused on the difficult question of religion’s place in the\npublic sphere (Parekh 2006, Laborde 2008, Brahm Levey and Modood 2009,\nModood 2013) as well as on the place afforded to women in traditional\nreligious conceptions, more specifically in Islam. Does the\naccommodation of religious sensitivities come at the price of a\nweakening of women’s rights? What is the right balance between\nthe principle of sexual equality affirmed in constitutional\ndemocracies and the respect of religious\n liberty?[15] \nThe debate between supporters and critics of differentiated\ncitizenship centres on the model’s supposed effect on civic\nintegration. It is assumed that democratic citizenship, properly\nconstrued, can indeed function as a significant lever of integration.\nThe idea is that citizenship as a set of civil, political and social\nrights and as a political practice can help generate desirable\nfeelings of identity and belonging. This statement hides significant\ndisagreement over how to characterize the relation between citizenship\nand nationality. Some consider that citizenship’s capacity to\nfulfil its integrative function depends on, and feeds upon, the prior\nexistence of a common nationality while others counter that, under\nconditions of pluralism, nationality cannot function as a suitable\nfocus of allegiance and identity. The collective identity of modern\ndemocratic states should rather be based upon more abstract and\nuniversalistic political and legal principles that transcend cultural\ndifference. This debate brings to the fore differing assessments of\nthe role that citizenship can play in contemporary societies\ncharacterized by a high degree of complexity and internal\ndiversity. \nLiberal nationalists like David Miller have argued that only specific\nforms of political practice can produce high levels of trust and\nloyalty between citizens (Miller 2000, 87). The political activities\nof the citizens of Athens or of Rousseau’s ideal Republic\npresumed face-to-face relations of cooperation that favour the growth\nof such sentiments. The scale and complexity of modern states have\nmade the kind of political practice envisaged by Rousseau and\ndescribed by Aristotle at best marginal. Citizens do not meet under an\noak tree to formulate the laws; they are basically strangers and\ncitizens’ involvement in the politics of representative\ndemocracies is episodic and diluted. Politics in this context cannot\nbe expected to play a central role in most individuals’ lives;\nsomething else must generate the trust and loyalty necessary to the\nfunctioning of a political community. Historically, it is the nation\nthat has allowed large numbers of individuals to feel a sense of\ncommonality, setting them apart from others and making solidarity\namong strangers possible. \nPostnationalists do not dispute the key role played by the nation in\nmaking republican politics possible in large modern states. They agree\nthat reference to a common nationality allowed the political\nmobilization of their inhabitants, calling on their shared descent,\nhistory or language. But democracy’s association with the\nnation-state is contingent rather than necessary. And this, it is\nargued, means that democratic politics can, in principle, free itself\nfrom its historical moorings. Postnationalists claim that this\ndissociation is not only possible, but necessary for moral and\npragmatic reasons (Habermas 1998, 132). \nOn the one hand, the historical balance sheet of the nation-state\nreveals a legacy of oppression of minority cultures within and\ncultural, political and economic imperialism outside its borders. On\nthe other hand, the acknowledgment of the nation-state’s\n(growing) internal diversity and sensitivity to the injustice of\nforced assimilation undermine its ability to continue playing the role\nit fulfilled in the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies. Imposing the majority culture upon minorities may simply\nmake it more difficult for them to identify with the nation-state and\nweaken its legitimacy. \nIn conditions of pluralism, therefore, the majority culture cannot\nserve as the grounding of a shared identity. It must be replaced by\nuniversalistic principles of human rights and the rule of law, which\ndo not, it is argued, imply the imposition of a particular majority\nculture on minorities. Each political community develops distinctive\ninterpretations of the meaning of these principles over time, which\nbecome embodied in its political and legal institutions and practices.\nThese in turn form a political culture that crystallizes around the\ncountry’s constitution and makes those principles into a\n‘concrete universal’. This embedding of democratic and\nliberal principles in a distinctive political culture can, in turn,\ngive rise to what Jürgen Habermas has called a\n“constitutional patriotism”, which should replace\nnationalism as the focus of a common identity. In countries that have\nachieved a strong national consciousness, the political culture has\nlong been entangled with the majority culture. This\n“fusion”, argues Habermas, “must be dissolved if it\nis to be possible for different cultural, ethnic, and religious forms\nof life to coexist and interact on equal terms within the\nsame political community” (Habermas 1998, 118). \nThe thrust of the argument is that democratic political practice can\nprovide a sufficient stimulus to integration in complex democratic\nsocieties, and is indeed the only one properly available to them.\nThere is no need for a background consensus based on cultural\nhomogeneity to act as a ‘catalyzing condition’ for\ndemocracy to the extent that the democratic political process,\ninvolving public deliberation and decision-making, makes “a\nreasonable political understanding possible, even among\nstrangers.” Democracy, as a set of procedures, can secure\nlegitimacy in the absence of more substantive commonalities between\ncitizens and achieve social integration. Since it is not wedded to\nparticular cultural premises, it can be responsive to changes in the\ncultural composition of the citizenry and generate a common political\nculture (Habermas 2001a, 73–74). Habermas’s position,\nthen, gives pride of place to the democratic process and to the\npolitical participation of citizens, which play a key role in securing\nsocial integration: “In complex societies, it is the\ndeliberative opinion- and will-formation of citizens, grounded in the\nprinciples of popular sovereignty, that forms the ultimate medium for\na form of abstract, legally constructed solidarity that reproduces\nitself through political participation” (Habermas 2001a,\n76). \nBut the democratic process can fulfil its role only if it achieves a\ncertain level of output legitimacy: appropriate levels of solidarity\nare sustainable only if basic standards of social justice are\nsatisfied (Habermas 2001a, 76). If it is to remain a source of\nsolidarity, citizenship has to be seen as a valuable status,\nassociated not only with civil and political rights, but also with the\nfulfilment of fundamental social and cultural rights (Habermas 1998,\n118–119). \nFor most liberal nationalists, this seems like putting the cart before\nthe horse since a successful welfare state, they argue, is possible\nonly if citizens already enjoy high levels of mutual trust and\nloyalty. Welfare policies suppose that we make sacrifices for\nanonymous others who differ from us in terms of their ethnic origin,\nreligion and way of life. But in democracies, redistributive policies\ncan be sustained only if they enjoy strong levels of public support.\nThis support is dependent on a sense of common identity that\ntranscends difference and motivates citizens to share their revenues\nwith people whom they do not know, but to whom they feel related by\ncommon bonds. This sentiment implies reciprocity: the expectation\nthat, in times of need, one could also benefit from the solidarity of\nfellow citizens (Miller, 1995; Canovan, 1996). \nLiberal nationalists and other critics of the postnationalist position\ngo on to argue that freeing the liberal democratic state from its\nhistorical moorings is neither possible, nor necessary. They recognize\nthat the link between liberal democracy and the nation is historically\ncontingent rather than necessary or conceptual while adding that this\ndoes not mean that they can or should be dissociated (Miller 1995,\n29–30; Kymlicka 2003). Calling for the separation of a\ncountry’s political culture from the majority group’s\nculture is easier said than done. While it may be comparably easy to\ndiscard the most egregious forms of fusion, if there is the political\nwill to do so (for instance, by de-establishing the Anglican church in\nthe case of England), any political culture will be ethically\npatterned in ways that are difficult for members of the majority to\nappreciate. Expressions such as “cutting the umbilical\ncord” or “dissolving” the fusion overstate the\nextent to which a political culture may be disengaged from the\nbackground culture. This is not necessarily cause for alarm, it is\nargued, since the nation need not be construed in ways that exclude\nminorities. Nationhood can be understood in sufficiently\n‘thin’ terms to accommodate minorities while being\n‘thick’ enough to generate appropriate sentiments of\nsolidarity, loyalty, and trust. \nThere are different versions of this thin understanding of nationhood.\nWhat they all share is the downplaying of substantive commonalities of\ndescent, culture and religion to the benefit of political and legal\nprinciples and\n institutions.[16]\n Still there are variations: David Miller defends a conception of\npublic culture that goes beyond the political to cover social norms\n(such as honesty in filling tax returns) and may include certain\ncultural ideals (for instance, “religious beliefs or a\ncommitment to preserve the purity of the national language”\n(Miller 1995, 26)) while Kymlicka argues that an appropriately thin\nconception of nationhood also discards assumptions that “members\nof the nation should share the same […] life-style”\n(Kymlicka 2003, 273). \nThese differences notwithstanding, both conceptions are affirmed as\ninclusive since they describe national identity as flexible and open\nto change. Once immigrants are citizens, they can participate in the\ncollective conversation by which citizens debate and constantly\nreinterpret the nation’s identity. What immigrants are required\nto display is a “willingness to accept current political\nstructures and to engage with the host community so that a new common\nidentity can be forged” (Miller 1995, 129). They are expected\n“to speak a common national language”, “feel loyalty\nto national institutions” and “share a commitment to\nmaintaining the nation as a single, self-governing community into the\nindefinite future” (Kymlicka 2003, 273). \nGiven the thin version of national identity they propose, one might\nconclude that liberal nationalists are not that far from the\nconstitutional patriotism of Jürgen Habermas. After all, both\npositions seem to give the central role to a common political culture.\nThe distance separating them becomes clear when we look at the\npolitical implications of their respective views, like when evaluating\nthe prospects of the European Union. Liberal nationalists are often\nsceptical towards the European experiment while postnationalists are\nfirm\n supporters.[17]\n This difference flows from their respective conceptions of what makes\nand sustains a political culture as a source of integration. For\nliberal nationalists, continuity is essential: a political culture\nderives much of its strength from an anchoring in the history and\nnarrative of a distinct political community extending backwards and\nforwards in time. They are sceptical of political voluntarism and,\nmore specifically, towards what can be achieved through formal\npolitical institutions. Democratic procedures alone, divorced from a\nricher background, can neither generate nor sustain a robust political\nculture or a sense of common identity. \nIn contrast, postnationalists like Habermas consider that the\ndemocratic process is crucial. The postnationalist conception gives\ngreater weight to political practice and to the legal and political\ninstitutions that sustain it rather than their cultural and historical\nmoorings. This explains Habermas’s militant support of the\nEuropean project and, more specifically, his belief that adopting a\nconstitution could have a “catalytic effect” on the\nprocess of constructing a ‘more perfect Union’ (Habermas\n2001b, 16). \nFor the better part of the last century, conceptions of citizenship,\ndespite many differences, have had one thing in common: the idea that\nthe necessary framework for citizenship is the sovereign, territorial\nstate. The legal status of citizen is essentially the formal\nexpression of membership in a polity that has definite territorial\nboundaries within which citizens enjoy equal rights and exercise their\npolitical agency. In other words, citizenship, both as a legal status\nand as an activity, is thought to presuppose the existence of a\nterritorially bounded political community, which extends over time and\nis the focus of a common identity. In the last twenty years, this\npremise has come under close scrutiny. A host of phenomena, loosely\nassociated under the heading ‘globalisation’, have\nencouraged this critical awakening: exploding transnational economic\nexchange, competition and communication as well as high levels of\nmigration, of cultural and social interactions have shown how porous\nthose borders have become and led people to contest the relevance and\nlegitimacy of state sovereignty. \nThree questions are particularly salient. First, the intensification\nof migratory movements from poorer to richer countries in the context\nof growing inequalities between North and South has led some authors\nto contest the state’s moral right to choose its members by\nselectively closing its borders. Second, what R. Bauböck calls\nthe “mismatch between citizenship and the territorial scope of\nlegitimate authority” (Bauböck 2008, 31) has prompted a\ngrowing questioning of the acceptability of the different rights\naccorded to citizens and non-citizens living within the same state.\nBut if we question the tight association between the territorial\nstate, citizenship and rights, are we not weakening the very\ninstitutional framework that makes citizenship a meaningful practice?\nThis question raises a third set of issues as it assumes that the\ndemocratic nation-state is the only institutional context in which\ncitizenship can thrive. This is contested by those who claim that\ncitizenship can be exercised in a multiplicity of ‘sites’\nboth below and above the nation-state. \nDoes the political community have the moral right to decide who\ncan/cannot become a citizen or mustn’t we recognize the right to\nfree movement? Much of the philosophical debate has turned around two\nissues: firstly, on the nature of our obligations towards people from\nimpoverished countries who seek better lives for themselves and their\nfamilies; secondly, on the moral status of political communities and\ntheir supposed right to protect their integrity by excluding non\n members.[18] \nOne way of characterizing our obligation to strangers insists that,\nabsent any relations of cooperation, common humanity is our only bond.\nIt is argued that only a rather weak, imperfect or conditional duty of\nassistance can be inferred from such a premise. This duty limits the\nbasic right of the political community to distribute membership as it\nwishes without, in any way, displacing it. Individuals have a duty to\nassist strangers in urgent need if they can provide assistance without\nexposing themselves to significant risk or cost. At a collective\nlevel, the implications are more considerable as political communities\nhave greater resources and can consider a broader range of benevolent\nactions at comparably negligible cost. The principle of mutual aid may\njustify redistribution of membership, territory, wealth and resources\nto the extent that certain states have more than they can reasonably\nbe said to need (Walzer 1983, 47). In this framework, redistributive\npolicies remain, however, entirely dependent on wealthier\ncountries’ understanding of their needs and of the urgency of a\nstranger’s situation. There is no obligation to give equal\nweight to the interests of non-members. \nInstitutionally, this position supports what the Geneva Convention on\nthe Status of Refugees (United Nations 1951) calls the principle of\n“non refoulement”: signatory states are not to\ndeport refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin if\nthis threatens their lives and freedom. It can also support claims in\nfavour of increasing the number of immigrants admitted into richer\ncountries, depending on how the latter evaluate the potential effects\non their own interests. \nCritics contend that our obligations towards migrants and\nasylum-seekers go well beyond this and call for a policy of open\nborders and/or deny the state’s right to decide alone who\nexactly, and how many people, may enter its territory. Three basic\nstrategies are employed: the first consists of arguing that freedom of\nmovement is a fundamental human right. For example, some have argued\nthat any theory recognizing the equal moral value of individuals and\ngiving them moral primacy over communities cannot justify rejecting\naliens’ claims to admission and citizenship. As Joseph Carens\ndemonstrated in an early article, this argument applies to the three\nmain strands of contemporary liberal theory: libertarianism (a\nla Nozick), Rawlsianism and utilitarianism (Carens 1987). If we\ngive the principle of moral equality its full extension, the\ndistinction between citizen and alien is morally arbitrary, justified\nneither by nature nor achievement. When evaluating border and\nimmigration policies, the equal consideration of the interests of all\naffected (be they aliens or citizens) is required. Political\ncommunities cannot decide whether they can afford to accept refugee\nclaimants or prospective immigrants simply according to their\nunderstanding of their own situation, needs and interests.\nConsideration of consequences (e.g. in terms of public order, the\nsustainability of welfare policies, the potential effects of a brain\ndrain in developing countries, etc.) is not prohibited; what changes\nradically is how we are to evaluate them. Institutionally, this would\ndoubtless lead to substantial changes in the immigration and refugee\npolicies of most Western democracies. \nA second strategy advocated by Arash Abizadeh (2008) relies on the\nprinciple of democratic legitimacy, holding that the exercise of\ncoercive power is legitimate “only insofar as it is actually\njustified by and to the very people over whom it is\nexercised” (41). Since a regime of border control subjects both\ncitizens and non-citizens to the state’s coercive use of power,\n“the justification for a particular regime of border control is\nowed not just to those whom the boundary marks as members, but to\nnonmembers as well”\n (45)[19].\n The upshot to this argument is that, contrary to a long-held\nassumption, no democratic state has the right to unilaterally control\nits own borders, but must either allow freedom of movement or, at the\nvery least, give voice to prospective immigrants when formulating\nborder policy. The latter condition would itself lead to significant\nchanges in immigration policies in the Western world, since jointly\ncontrolled borders would presumably be more porous as well.  \nThe third strategy is less direct. To the extent that states do not\nsatisfy their moral obligations to guarantee the universal human right\nto security and subsistence through international redistributive\npolicies, they have a moral obligation to admit those wishing to\nenter. Here the idea of open borders is an instrumental, rather than\nintrinsic, moral principle: it is a means towards achieving global\ndistributive justice (Bader 1997). The advantage of this line of\nargument is that it faithfully reflects a central motivation for open\nborders: the outrage provoked by the huge inequalities between North\nand South and rich countries’ role in perpetuating this\nsituation. This strategy, if successful, would establish specific\nrights for people from poorer countries towards the North, and not\nsimply a broadly framed right to free movement, to be\n‘equally’ enjoyed by individuals of rich and poor\ncountries alike. \nTo be convincing the argument must show: firstly, that severe global\npoverty requires immediate action; secondly, that it is a matter of\njustice, not charity. To that effect, it is crucial to show that the\nextreme poverty of some countries is not simply the result of\nendogenous factors (e.g. bad governance; corrupt political culture,\netc.), but is linked to a global political and economic order that\nsystematically produces an unjust distribution of resources and\npolitical power, which rich northern countries, as its main\nbeneficiaries, are in no hurry to\n reform.[20]\n The third step in this schema purportedly shows that justifications\nof restrictive immigration policies premised on ethico-political\nclaims lose much of their force in the context of profound\ninternational inequalities and injustice. Proponents claim that\nregulating immigration in order to preserve the integrity of the\npolitical community is a legitimate goal only if duties of\ninternational distributive justice are satisfied (Tan 2004, 126,\nreferring to Tamir 1992, 161). The argument’s upshot is that\n“[r]ich Northern states have a double moral obligation to\nseriously fight global poverty and to let more people in” (Bader\n1997, 31). \nBoth supporters and critics of (more) open borders agree that liberal\ndemocratic political communities have a moral status and are worth\npreserving. They disagree over what exactly is worthy of protection\nand how much weight should be given to securing their integrity\n(however it is defined) relative to our duties of international\njustice. \nThe division of the world into states is arguably justifiable on\nfunctional grounds, to the extent that states appear as “first\napproximations of optimal units for allocating and producing the\nworld’s resources” (Coleman and Harding 1995, 38). If we\nthink that states matter simply as local units of efficient production\nand distribution, then this would be the main consideration when\nevaluating immigration policies. Public order arguments would still\nmatter, likewise claims pertaining to a society’s economic\ncapacity to secure its material reproduction, but not arguments\nrelating to its cultural integrity or way of life. Unless, of course,\nthe capacity of states to act as efficient units of production and\ndistribution is linked to their being distinctive political\ncommunities with a particular culture of shared meanings worth\npreserving. \nOver thirty years ago, Michael Walzer defended such a view, based on\nthe idea that “distributive justice presupposes a bounded world\nwithin which distribution takes place” (Walzer 1983, 31). Since\nthe goods to be divided, exchanged and shared among individuals have\nsocial meanings that are specific to particular communities, it is\nonly within their boundaries that conflict can be resolved and\ndistributive schemes judged either just or unjust. The crucial\nassumption here is that the “political community is probably the\nclosest we can come to a world of common meanings. Language, history,\nand culture come together […] to produce a collective\nconsciousness” (Walzer 1983, 28). Politics itself, moreover, as\na set of practices and institutions that shape the form and outcome\nthat distributive conflicts take, “establishes its own bonds of\ncommonality” (Walzer 1983, 29). To reject political\ncommunities’ right to distribute the good of membership is to\nundermine their capacity to preserve their integrity. It is to condemn\nthem to become nothing more then neighbourhoods, random associations\nlacking any legally enforceable admissions policies. The probable\nresult of the free movement of individuals would be “casual\naggregates” devoid of any internal cohesion and incapable of\nbeing a source of patriotic sentiments and solidarity. In a world of\nneighbourhoods, membership would become meaningless. The upshot of\nthis is that we should recognize the political community’s right\nto regulate admission with a view to securing its cultural, economic\nand political integrity. \nWalzer’s position, notably his choice of analogies, has been\nextensively\n discussed.[21]\n His assumption that sovereign states constitute communities of shared\nmeanings appears particularly shaky. Most often, existing states\nincorporate various political communities that are themselves\ninternally pluralistic: linguistically, culturally and ideologically.\nIn such cases, one would be hard pressed to identify the community\nwhose integrity is at stake. Indeed, few states correspond to the\npicture Walzer envisages as the appropriate context for distributive\njustice. \nThis is not to say that political communities are merely functional\nunits. As Habermas argues, if the communitarian position appears\nirrelevant in the face of the complexity and internal diversity of\nmodern societies, it reminds us that modern states are a\n“political form of life” that cannot be “translated\nwithout remainder into the abstract form of institutions designed\naccording to general legal principles”. As forms of life, they\ninclude “the politicocultural context in which\nuniversalistic principles must be implemented, for only a population\naccustomed to freedom can keep the institutions of freedom\nalive” (Habermas 1996, 513). Here, Habermas refers yet again to\nhis distinction between the political culture, which develops around\nuniversalistic constitutional principles, and the wider, background\nculture. It is the integrity of the former, not the latter that must\nbe preserved: immigrants should be expected to integrate into the\npolitical culture of their new country, which means more than simply\nembracing abstract liberal-democratic principles. They must\n“willingly engage” with the particular form that these\nprinciples take in a given society with its own specific history.\nGiven that they come from different cultures, newcomers will bring\ndistinct perspectives to the interpretation of the political\nconstitution and may well affect its future development. But to the\nextent that their contribution can be understood as part of the\ndemocratic conversation, rather than as a conversation stopper, one\ncannot justify stricter limits to immigration on such\n grounds.[22]\n What presumably can be argued is that the capacity of the polity to\nintegrate newcomers in the political culture should be considered when\nsetting admissions policies. \nLiberal nationalists like Will Kymlicka make a similar argument: they\nclaim that liberal egalitarian aims such as equality of opportunity\nand solidarity stand a much better chance of being realized in the\ncontext of a strong national culture, defined as a “societal\nculture” involving a “common language and social\ninstitutions” (Kymlicka 2001,\n 259).[23]\n All things being equal, maintaining and strengthening such cultures\nserves a vital interest of individuals and liberal egalitarians should\nnot strive for fully open borders. But does this mean that our\ninterest in a strong national culture outweigh our duty to pursue\ninternational justice? From a liberal egalitarian perspective, the\nanswer is clearly no. The right of political communities to protect\ntheir integrity stands only under conditions of rough international\nequality. Under such conditions, limits to immigration would not cause\nsubstantial harm, but “would only reserve for the nationals of a\ncountry what aliens already have in their own country — namely,\nthe chance to be free and equal citizens within their own national\ncommunity” (Kymlicka 2001, 271). Under the present situation of\nradical inequality, however, restrictive policies of immigration allow\nricher countries to “hoard an unfair share of resources”\nand cannot be squared with the principle of the moral equality of\npersons, which requires that “we care equally about the\nwell-being of all individuals, wherever they are born, and however\nlittle we interact with them” (Kymlicka 2001,\n 271)[24]. \nKymlicka doesn’t say how we should interpret his conclusion as\npertains to present policies of immigration: must we demand that the\nborders of Western democracies be opened until they honour their\nduties of international\n justice?[25]\n Should we rather underscore their dual moral obligations to fight\nglobal poverty and allow in more immigrants? (Bader 1997) Or, since\nglobal poverty and injustice are the problems, wouldn’t it be\nbetter to address them directly and see them as our first moral\npriority (Pogge 1997)? As Kok-Chor Tan remarks, the argument should be\nunderstood as supporting “the primacy of international justice,\nrather than as a claim about how to prioritize public policies and\ngoals”. This primacy implies “that national projects of\nwell-off nations lose their legitimacy if these nations are not also\ndoing their fair share as determined by their duties of justice”\n(Tan 2004, 129). Whether or not liberals should concentrate on\nreforming the international system as Thomas Pogge has urged or fight\nfor both greater international distributive justice and more open\nborders as Veit Bader advises is a matter of strategy. The two\nprescriptions are by no means incompatible; insisting on the\nillegitimacy of restrictive immigration policies under current\nconditions may be a way to put rich countries on the spot and prod\nthem to accept their moral responsibilities towards the world’s\npoor (Goodin 1992, 8). \nShould one infer from the preceding discussion that citizenship is\n“hard on the outside and soft on the inside” (Bosniak\n2006, 4) with the border representing a firm line between those who\nare part of the community of equal citizens and those who remain\noutside? The short answer is no. International migration produces what\nBauböck calls a “mismatch between citizenship and the\nterritorial scope of legitimate authority” with “citizens\nliving outside the country whose government is supposed to be\naccountable to them and inside a country whose government is not\naccountable to them” (Bauböck 2008, 31). To resident aliens\nwho live within a specific community of citizens, the border is not\nsomething they have left behind, it effectively follows them inside\nthe state, denying them many of the rights enjoyed by full citizens or\nmaking their enjoyment less secure (Bosniak 2006). \nOne way to address this mismatch is to reconsider how entitlement to\ncitizenship is determined. In a world characterized by significant\nlevels of migration across states, birthright citizenship —\nacquired either through descent (jus sanguinis) or birth in\nthe territory (jus soli) — may lead to counterintuitive\nresults: while a regime of pure jus sanguinis systematically\nexcludes immigrants and their children, though the latter may be born\nand bred in their parents’ new home, it includes descendents of\nexpatriates who may never have set foot in their forebears’\nhomeland. On the other hand, a regime of jus soli may\nattribute citizenship to children whose birth in the territory is\naccidental while denying it to those children who have arrived in the\ncountry at a very young age. \nThe stakeholder principle (or jus nexi) is proposed as an\nalternative (or a supplement) to birthright citizenship: individuals\nwho have a “real and effective link” (Shachar 2009, 165)\nto the political community, or a “permanent interest in\nmembership” (Bauböck 2008, 35) should be entitled to claim\ncitizenship. This new criterion aims at securing citizenship for those\nwho are truly members of the political community, in the sense that\ntheir life prospects depend on the country’s laws and policy\nchoices. \nIf the stakeholder principle alleviates the mismatch, it does not\nquestion the tight association between rights, citizenship, territory\nand authority. For some, it is precisely this association that should\nbe questioned since it contradicts the increasing fluidity of the\nrelations between individuals and polities in a globalized world. This\ncontext is thought to necessitate more than a friendly amendment to\ncurrent principles of citizenship allocation: it requires the\ndisaggregation of rights, commonly associated with citizenship, from\nthe legal status of\n citizen.[26]\n This process is thought to have already begun in contemporary\ndemocracies since, as noted above, many of the civil and social rights\nassociated with citizenship are now extended to all individuals\nresiding in the state, notwithstanding their legal status. Political\nrights to participation should likewise be extended to resident\nnoncitizens, and perhaps even to those “noncitizen\nnonresidents” who have fundamental interests that are affected\nby a particular state (Song 2009). \nThe emergence of human rights instruments at the international and\ntransnational levels has lent some credibility to the perspective of a\ndeterritorialization of rights regimes and the possibility of securing\na person’s basic rights irrespective of her formal membership\nstatus in a given polity. In this context, it is not in virtue of our\n(particular) citizenship that we are recognized rights, but in virtue\nof our (universal) personhood. \nOver and above diverging assessments of the empirical plausibility of\nsuch unbundling, some authors highlight the risks involved and contest\nits desirability. Stable citizenship regimes “promote internal\nredistribution and support co-governance”. “[B]y\nencouraging the dissolution of the bundle of benefits and protections\nthat currently attach to citizenship, proponents of the unbundling\nvision will also begin to fuel an alternative discourse as well\n– one that urges the privatization and fragmentation of\ncitizenship, and that implies less collective responsibility for the\nwell being of members” (Shachar 2009, 67). \nThe debate over voting rights, in particular, is complex and covers\nboth external (extending voting rights to nonresident citizens) and\ninternal voting (expanding the franchise to resident non-citizens).\nTheorists with sympathies to the social membership thesis (arguing\nthat residence over time in a specific territory is the key to\nmembership in a society) or to the stakeholder conception of\ncitizenship usually consider that long-term residence in a country\nshould be the basis for the allocation of democratic rights. The\nargument may cover not only migrants who qualify for permanent\nresident status, but also those who have entered illegally in the\ncountry (Carens 2010b, 2013) as well as temporary migrants, in\nparticular ‘guest workers’ who are often denied any access\nto citizenship (Lenard 2015). On this view, safety from deportation\nand the entitlement to the state’s protection when abroad is\nwhat distinguishes citizens from resident noncitizens. Citizenship\nrights are understood as extra-territorial (“they follow the\ncitizen rather than the territory”) while voting rights are best\nunderstood as territorial (Lenard 2015,\n 131).[27] \nThough some states do extend voting rights to resident noncitizens at\nthe local\n level[28],\n it is the growing extension of voting rights to nonresident citizens\nover the last decades that is particularly striking (Pogonyi 2014). It\nshows the persistence of a conception of membership premised on\nunderstanding the nation-state as a historical community of citizens\nwith common values and shared ethno-cultural traits. On this view,\nvoting rights are not understood territorially, but follow the citizen\nwhen she settles outside of her home country. Though one can\nunderstand some of the pragmatic reasons that often motivate certain\nstates in recognizing voting rights to expatriates (e.g. acknowledging\nand encouraging their continued contribution to the home country\nthrough payment of remittances), normative theorists have been mostly\ncritical of this phenomenon (see especially Lopez-Guerra 2005). In\nparticular, the policy followed by certain states in the former\nsocialist federations (USSR and Yugoslavia) of recognizing voting\nrights to co-ethnics residing in territories integrated in\nneighbouring independent states, as well as the more recent decisions\nby states like Hungary and Romania to extend voting rights to\ntrans-border ethnic kin populations, should alert us to the dangers to\nregional stability that the “re-ethnicization of\ncitizenship” involve (Joppke 2005, cited by Pogonyi 2014).\nMoreover, where the electoral system is not designed to limit the\npotential political impact of the nonresident electoral body, external\nvoting may effect the “resident constituency’s right to\ndemocratic self-determination” (Pogonyi 2014, 135-136). \nAs we have seen in the preceding section, the nation-state’s\nsovereignty is often understood as an impediment to global justice.\nIts capacity to deal with economic, social and environmental problems\nthat increasingly cut across borders is also questioned. Under such\ncircumstances, should the sovereign, territorial state still be seen\nas the necessary institutional context for justice and democracy?\nShould we not explore possibilities beyond its boundaries?  \nSuch questioning has sparked at least two responses from theorists of\ncitizenship. ‘Voluntarists’ insist on the need to rethink\ndemocracy and citizenship beyond the nation-state, proposing schemes\nto extend democratic politics to the regional and global\n levels.[29]\n ‘Sceptics’, on the other hand, argue that democratic\ncitizenship requires a bounded territorial space, in which citizens\nsee themselves as part of a common demos. At the heart of\nthis debate is the contested meaning of democratic political agency\nand its conditions, which must be clarified if the debate is to get\nanywhere. \nCitizenship as legal status is what makes global citizenship\nconceivable, since there is no limit to the potential extension of\nrights, while the political dimension of citizenship presupposes a\nconcept of political community that is richer but more limited (Cohen\n1999, 249). The sceptics consider that citizenship at the global level\nentails a weakening of its political dimension, a waning of its\ndemocratic character. The voluntarists respond that transnational\npolitical citizenship is not an oxymoron if we rid ourselves of the\nblinkers inherited from the past. Both sceptics and voluntarists\nacknowledge that meaningful citizenship cannot simply be legal in\nnature. It’s their assumptions about the political dimension of\ndemocratic citizenship and its background conditions that set them\napart. \nWe will examine two versions of this disagreement. In the first,\ndisagreement centres upon the basic conditions of democratic political\nagency rather than on its meaning. This is a crucial issue since how\nwe define these conditions can limit the potential extension of the\npolitical community. In the second, the disagreement is over the\nmeaning of democratic agency itself. To what extent should political\nagency be understood as a form of collective agency? Should we\ncharacterize political action as a common practice, which requires\nthat citizens be in a relation of interaction and mutual awareness, or\ncan we define it as primarily individual? \nSupporters of global democracy reject the conventional identification\nbetween demos, territory and citizenship. In their view,\ncitizenship is not a set of practices and rights that need to be\nanchored in a particular demos defined by specific\nterritorial boundaries. On the contrary, citizenship is ideally\nexercised in a multiplicity of ‘sites’, situated at\ndifferent levels of governance: local, national, regional and global.\nGlobal democrats sketch a multilayered, global democratic order in\nwhich no single layer or site is dominant (Pogge 1992, 58, Young 2000,\n266). This scheme implies a ‘vertical’ dispersal of power\nabove and below existing sovereign states, which are stripped of their\ncentrality. This would give less of an incentive for conflicts over\npower and wealth within and between states, “‘thereby\nreducing the incidence of war, poverty, and oppression’ and\nenvironmental degradation” (Kuper 2004, 30, quoting Pogge 1992,\n102–105). \nVoluntarists would balance this dilution of state power by\nstrengthening certain global regulatory regimes in areas like peace\nand security, human rights, the environment, trade and finances, etc.\nThese regimes would set down general rules “regarding that small\nbut vital set of issues around which peace and justice call for global\nco-operation” (Young 2000,\n 267).[30]\n A set of global institutions would be needed to ensure the\napplication of these rules; though voluntarists are quick to point out\nthe importance of democratic principles — consent,\nself-determination and autonomy — and their institutional\nimplications (Pogge 1992, 64). \nThe formal political institutions and procedures envisaged are largely\nfamiliar: representative assemblies based on elections and referenda.\nSuch institutions would exist at each level of the multilayered\nscheme: local, national, regional and global. Following the European\nUnion model, continent-wide parliaments are envisaged, as well as a\nreformed general assembly of the United Nations. At the informal\nlevel, voluntarists insist on the need for globally active\norganizations of civil society, welcome the emergence of a\ntransnational public opinion and call on global agencies such as the\nWorld Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund to commit\nthemselves to basic principles of publicity. \nGlobal democrats assume that the extension of democracy beyond the\nlimits of the nation-state is neither conceptually nor practically\nimpossible. Their response to claims that scale constitutes a major\nobstacle is twofold: first, they put the principle of subsidiarity at\nthe front and centre of their institutional scheme (Held 2005, 14;\nPogge 1992, 65–66); second, they insist that robust democratic\npolitics is truly possible only at the local level. In existing, large\nnation-states, representative institutions are already far removed\nfrom ordinary citizens, who feel largely disempowered and disaffected\n(Young 2000, 270–271). Since the multilayered scheme they\npropose involves significant decentralization from the national to the\nsub-national level, the argument runs that global democracy would, in\nfact, translate into more, rather than less, ‘real’\ndemocracy. It would serve to increase the ability of citizens to\nparticipate effectively in shaping the policies that concern them\ndirectly (Pogge 1992, 64; Young 2000, 269). But no matter how\nforcefully the principle of subsidiarity is applied, the global\ndemocratic project would still entail the implementation of global\nprinciples and standards (e.g. (re)distributive principles, human\nrights standards) that would rely on coercive enforcement agencies\n(Benhabib 2004, 113). Given this reality, the democratic legitimacy of\npolitical institutions above the level of the state is an issue that\ncannot be avoided. \nSceptics of global democracy have worked to identify basic background\nconditions to democratic institutions and procedures while showing\nthat they cannot be satisfied beyond a certain threshold. Their\nargument is empirical, rather than conceptual. A common language is\none plausible candidate put forward by Will Kymlicka. He insists that\nlinguistic/territorial political associations are the primary forum\nfor democratic participation, rather than higher-level political\nassociations that cut across linguistic lines, because democratic\npolitics is essentially “politics in the vernacular”\n(Kymlicka 1999,\n 121).[31]\n Even in cases where average citizens are conversant in one or more\nforeign language, they rarely have the level of fluency necessary to\nparticipate in political debate in a language other than their own:\nonly a select few have the ability and opportunity to acquire and\nsustain the necessary language skills. Political debate in\nmultilingual settings is essentially an elitist pursuit. \nIn fact, political discussions require a higher degree of fluency than\nwhat is needed for business transactions or tourism: “political\ncommunication has a large ritualistic component, and these ritualized\nforms of communication are typically language-specific. Even if one\nunderstands a foreign language in the technical sense, without\nknowledge of these ritualistic elements one may be unable to\nunderstand political debates” (Kymlicka 1999, 121). If he is\nright, the hope that English’s emergence as a new lingua\nfranca in Europe and globally could overcome the linguistic\nobstacles that impede the development of transnational democratic\npolitics are overstated (Van Parijs 2005). English’s growing use\nmay be enough to increase mutual understanding between individuals,\nbut it is unlikely that it could become a transnational vernacular\nallowing democratic politics to transcend national\n boundaries.[32] \nMost voluntarists and sceptics rely on the same implicit view of\ndemocratic political agency: citizens are political agents through\ntheir participation in institutions and practices that require\nsignificant interaction and mutual awareness. In this sense,\ndemocratic political agency appears collective rather than individual.\nYet this leaves the door open to the sceptics’ objections. If we\nbelieve that formal and informal democratic institutions like\nParliaments and the public sphere require relatively high levels of\nhorizontal communication between citizens, the existence of a common\nlanguage appears a necessary condition to democratic agency. This, in\nturn, sets limits to the potential extension of the political\ncommunity. Schemes that call for the “institutionalization of\nnational and transnational forms of public debate, democratic\nparticipation, and accountability” (Held 2005, 18) for\ndemocracy’s global extension appear misguided. \nIt might be argued, however, that the development of transnational\nadvocacy networks shows that the sceptics’ criticisms are\noverstated. These networks are proof that it is possible for\nindividuals to exercise political agency in forums other than those\nprovided by democratic states and that the absence of a common\nvernacular does not impede participation. Global democracy becomes\nthinkable once we focus on the development of transnational civil\nsociety rather than on the transposing of representative institutions\nat the global level. In response, it should be noted that such\nnetworks coalesce around a common ideology or conception of the good\n(e.g. the environment; rights of indigenous peoples, critique of\nneo-liberal forms of globalisation, etc.), which serves as a\nfunctional equivalent to a common vernacular. More important, these\nnetworks are composed of voluntary associations organized around\nshared interests and cannot stand as a surrogate for the political\ncommunity per se, which acts as the addressee of claims made\nby the organisations and groups of civil society. \nWhich political community or communities can act as the addressee of\nclaims made by organisations of transnational civil society? If one\nanswers national political communities and their formal institutions,\none agrees with Kymlicka that: “the weak transnationalism of\nadvocacy networks is predicated on, even parasitic on, the ongoing\nexistence of bounded political communities” (Kymlicka 2003,\n291). Surely, we cannot point to a constituted cosmopolitan political\ncommunity, which as yet does not exist and, if the sceptics are to be\nbelieved, has very little chances of ever coming into existence. If\nthis is right, then the organisations of an emerging transnational\ncivil society can offer possibilities of political agency for certain\ncommitted individuals and groups, but they do not offer a solution to\nthe problem posed by the extension of democratic citizenship to the\nglobal\n level.[33] \nThere is another version of the global democratic project, however,\nthat involves an individualist conception of democratic political\nagency. Here citizens can engage in significant political activities\nthat do not require high levels of interaction and cooperation between\nthem. This is a position developed by Andrew Kuper (2004). It\ninvolves, first, that we abandon the conception of democratic\nlegitimacy implicit in deliberative, participatory and republican\nconceptions of democracy, which all attempt to maintain a broadly\nRousseauian understanding of legitimacy: laws are legitimate only if\ncitizens can see themselves, somehow, as their coauthors. Kuper\nsuggests that we discard this vision of democratic legitimacy in\nfavour of one focusing on the responsiveness of the political system\nas a whole. The central issue becomes whether this system is made to\nact “in the best interests of the public, in a manner responsive\nto them” (Kuper 2004, 75 quoting Pitkin 1967). On this view, the\nvertical, rather than horizontal, dimension of communication is of\noverarching importance: individual citizens must have access to\nrelevant information about what various authorities are doing, there\nmust exist institutional channels through which they can pressure\nauthorities and let them know their views on proposed policies. Doing\nso does not require that they “act together with high levels of\nmutual awareness” (Kuper 2004, 127); they can exercise these\ncapacities individually, via specific agencies. Responsiveness is also\na dimension of democratic legitimacy favoured by some empirical\nscientists, referring to the responsiveness of representatives to the\nopinions, preferences and concerns of citizens communicated via\nvarious agencies. It is measured, however, through statistical\ncorrelation in which public opinion is the dependent variable and\npolicy output is the independent variable (for an overview see Page\n(1994)).  \nIn contrast to the vertical and sometimes causal picture of\ncitizenship depicted in responsiveness, one could insist, as does\nBernard Manin, that meaningful political agency in a representative\ndemocracy requires that citizens be capable of learning what their\nco-citizens think about important policy issues or events independent\nof the authorities. Horizontal communication between citizens appears\nas a necessary condition to their being capable of political action\n(Manin 1997,\n 170–171).[34]\n The thing that makes citizens political agents is their capacity to\nact independently of authorities and this ability, in turn, depends on\nwhether they regularly act and communicate together, even if this\ninteraction is often mediated through institutions like the electronic\nmedia. \nDespite their many differences, the conceptions of citizenship\ndiscussed in the preceding sections share the idea that citizenship\nsupposes a certain kind of agency, one that involves the\nindividual’s capacity to reflect on his/her subjective good as\nwell as on the good of the whole. And this has long been associated,\nin the Western tradition, to a complex discursive capacity that only\nhuman beings are thought to possess. Following Aristotle: \nThe capacity for rational agency has long functioned as a threshold\ncondition for citizenship. In Aristotle’s Politics, for\nexample, the exclusion of women and slaves from citizenship is based\non an account of their souls as lacking the appropriate kind of\nrationality. The long history of the extension of citizenship to\ngroups previously excluded did not change this basic understanding. It\ninvolved instead the recognition that the newly included (e.g. women,\nworkers, descendants of former slaves) did, in fact, satisfy the\nthreshold condition. \nContemporary democratic and republican theories often rely on an ideal\npicture of the citizen as actively involved in the political life of\nthe community. This encompasses a vast array of activities and\npractices, including voting in elections, canvassing, participating in\npublic deliberation, demonstrating against government decisions or\npolicies, etc. These activities all presuppose the capacity for a\ncertain kind of agency, one that relies heavily on rational,\ndiscursive abilities. This common view sits uncomfortably with the\nfact that many individuals — in some cases because of deep\ncognitive disability — do not have these capacities. Though they\nmay be members of the society, can they — truly — be\ncitizens? From Locke to Rawls, the answer has been overwhelmingly\nnegative, confining these individuals to the category of wards (Arneil\n2009 and 2016, Pinheiro 2016, Clifford Simplican 2016). Though society\nmay have the responsibility to ensure their welfare, they can have no\nsay in its definition, and are fated to remain society’s passive\nbeneficiaries. \nOver the last forty years, disability advocates and scholars have\ncontested this view of the disabled, insisting that they should be\nseen and treated as citizens, not as wards. In the last few years,\nsome philosophers and political theorists have rallied to this view\nand questioned the conception of agency presupposed in the common view\nof democratic citizenship as unduly exclusionary (Nussbaum 2006,\nArneil 2009, Arneil and Hirschmann 2016). Building on the work of\ndisability theorists, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka (2011, 2016)\nhave argued further that if we accept — as we should —\nthat a capacity for complex discursive agency is not necessary for\ncitizenship, then we should also recognize domestic animals as\nco-citizens since they qualify as members of\n society.[35] \nDonaldson and Kymlicka define agency as “self-willed or\ninitiated action that carries an expectation of efficacy”\n(Donaldson & Kymlicka 2016, 180, fn 16). On this view, agency does\nnot require discursive rationality and individuals with deep cognitive\ndisability as well as domestic animals can be described as agents. The\nscope of agency is conceptualized into two parts: micro (the capacity\nto have a say over every day choices) and macro (the capacity of\nindividuals to shape the “fundamental dimensions of their\nlives” (Donaldson & Kymlicka 2016, 180)). In Zoopolis\n(2011), this macro dimension of agency was described more explicitly\nin political terms, referring to a capacity for political\nparticipation. To the extent that individuals act in ways that can be\nconstrued as expressing approval, acquiescence or dissent with the\nlaws and regulations that affect them, they can be described as acting\npolitically and as displaying a form of democratic agency. \nThe absence of linguistic agency creates specific challenges since\nboth individuals with deep cognitive disability and domestic animals\nare “dependent on others to support and interpret their\nparticipation” (Donaldson & Kymlicka 2016, 176). They can be\nagents only with the help of others, who have discursive rationality,\nand with whom they share relations of trust. The latter can help\nstructure or ‘scaffold’ meaningful choices for the former\nand interpret their expressions. \nAccepting that instances of “dependent agency” can count\nas political participation supposes that we abandon the binary between\nindependent and dependent forms of agency as well as the belief that\nonly the former counts as the right kind of agency when it comes to\ncitizenship. This should not be too difficult to do if we are willing\nto recognize that “[w]e are all interdependent, relying on\nothers to enable and sustain our (variable and contextual) capacities\nfor agency” (Donaldson & Kymlicka 2011, 107). This is not to\nclaim that we are all the same, but to argue in favour of replacing\nthe binary between “an autonomous, rational agent” and\n“his or her opposite, the ‘disabled’” “with a\ngradient scale in which we are all in various ways and in different\ndegrees both dependent on others and independent” (Arneil 2009,\n234). \nDonaldson and Kymlicka’s argument becomes less convincing when they\nattempt to illustrate with concrete examples what they mean by the\npolitical participation of domestic animals. In some of the examples\nthey use, the humans involved appear as the real agents of the actions\ndescribed while animals come across as the objects of their masters’\nagency (Donaldson & Kymlicka 2011, 112-116; Hinchcliffe 2015). In\nresponse to this criticism, Donaldson and Kymlicka have conceded the\nweakness of some of their examples while maintaining the possibility\nof finding better ones. More interestingly for our purposes, they\ninsist that: “capacities for agency are embedded in ongoing\nsocial relations amongst responsive, reflexive, and interdependent\nselves, not located in a threshold individual capacity for rational\nreflection and public deliberation” (Donaldson & Kymlicka\n2015, 331). If we accept that people with deep cognitive disability\nand domestic animals are members of society, then the right question\nto ask is not whether they meet the threshold condition of discursive\nrationality and can be recognized as citizens. Rather, we should\nenquire about the kind of spaces in which their political agency could\nbe expressed as well as look for the mechanisms through which their\ncitizenship could be enacted. In short, instead of defining who can be\na citizen according to whether or not an individual or group can\nfunction in the existing spaces of citizenship (i.e. whether they can\nparticipate in elections or militate for political parties), we should\ncreate distinct spaces that are commensurate to the capacities of all\nthose who possess rights of citizenship. \nDonaldson and Kymlicka’s main objective is to secure the rights\nof animals against the terrible and unjust consequences of human\nbeings’ ‘lordship’ over them. From the perspective\nof democratic theory, the upshot of their argument is mixed. On the\none hand, it may offer a promising response to the persisting\ncomplaints about the alleged incompetence of ‘ordinary’\ncitizens in contemporary mass democracies (Brennan 2016) by\nstimulating our institutional imagination to create better spaces of\ncitizenship for everyone. On the other hand, extending the definitions\nof political participation and democratic agency to cover the actions\nof domestic animals may also weaken the very significance of\ndemocratic citizenship. \nOur survey of contemporary discussions has highlighted important\ndifferences over each of the three dimensions of citizenship. As a\nlegal status, citizenship remains the keystone of contemporary\nconceptions: its normative core is the principle that citizens shall\nenjoy equal rights, although most would now agree that, in certain\ncircumstances, equal consideration of individuals’ interests may\njustifiably result in differential treatment from the state. This\nbroad agreement on principle leaves ample room for disagreement over\nthe particulars, as witnessed by the recurring debates over\naffirmative action and minority rights. But such discussions have\nbecome a hallmark of contemporary liberal societies, and our legal and\npolitical discourses are well equipped to handle them. The deeper\nworry, which new forms of political violence have made more acute,\ncentres upon achieving a proper balance between the recognition of\ndifference and the affirmation of common principles to which all\ncitizens adhere. \nHow robust an identity can citizenship provide in complex and\ninternally diverse societies? There is a tension here that is\ndifficult to resolve: our awareness of the pluralist nature of\ncontemporary societies leads us to underscore the importance of\ngeneral legal and political principles (democracy, human rights, rule\nof law) rather than the traditional emblems of nationality: common\nhistory and culture. Postnationalists, in particular, emphasize the\nrole of democratic political practice in securing social integration.\nYet, the complexity and scale of contemporary liberal societies tend\nto make this practice less significant in the lives of most citizens,\na fact reflected in declining levels of participation in formal\npolitical institutions. Are we not expecting too much from democratic\npolitical practice under current circumstances? \nThis question brings us face to face with the difficult issue of\ncitizens’ political agency, which has long been central to\ndebates between liberals and republicans. Whether we understand\ndemocracy in terms of civic self-government (republican version) or as\nthe ability to exercise control over government (liberal version), it\nis not easy to determine how, and through what institutional\nmechanisms, citizens can exercise meaningful political agency in\ncomplex societies. This difficulty is epitomized in the debate over\ntransnational citizenship. Although global citizenship is conceivable\nfirst and foremost as a legal status securing a number of fundamental\nhuman rights, most authors agree that it should not be strictly legal\nin nature and must have a significant political dimension. One senses,\nhowever, a distinct malaise when it comes to identifying appropriate\nnormative standards and locating the institutions through which these\ncould be approximated. \nIn the end, our dismissal of the\nencyclopédiste’s interest in distinguishing\nsubject and citizen may have been too hasty. If being a citizen in a\nliberal-democratic political community is to mean something more than\nthe status of legal subject, we must be ready to state what\nthis “more” entails. This stubborn blind-spot of theories\nof citizenship leads us to some of the most difficult issues\npertaining to the very possibility of democracy in the contemporary\nworld.","contact.mail":"leydet.dominique@uqam.ca","contact.domain":"uqam.ca"}]
