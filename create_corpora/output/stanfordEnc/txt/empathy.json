Ever since the eighteenth century, due particularly\nto the influence of the writings of David Hume and Adam Smith, those\ncapacities have been at the center of scholarly investigations into\nthe underlying psychological basis of our social and moral nature.\nYet, the concept of empathy is of relatively recent intellectual\nheritage. Moreover, since researchers in different disciplines have\nfocused their investigations on very specific aspects of the broad\nrange of empathy-related phenomena, one should probably not be\nsurprised by a certain amount of conceptual confusion and a\nmultiplicity of definitions associated with the empathy concept in a\nnumber of different scientific and non-scientific discourses. The\npurpose of this entry is to clarify the empathy concept by surveying\nits history in various philosophical and psychological discussions and\nby indicating why empathy was and should be regarded to be of such\ncentral importance in understanding human agency in ordinary contexts,\nin the human sciences, and for the constitution of ourselves as social\nand moral agents. More specifically, after a short historical\nintroduction articulating the philosophical context within which the\nempathy concept was coined, the second and third sections will discuss\nthe epistemic dimensions associated with our empathic capacities. They\nwill address the contention that empathy is the primary epistemic\nmeans for knowing other minds and that it should be viewed as the\nunique method distinguishing the human from the natural sciences.\nSections 4 and 5 will then focus on claims that view empathy as the\nfundamental social glue and that understand empathy as the main\npsychological mechanism enabling us to establish and maintain social\nrelations and taking an evaluative stance towards each other. \n\nBefore the psychologist Edward Titchener (1867–1927) introduced\nthe term “empathy” in 1909 into the English language as\nthe translation of the German term “Einfühlung” (or\n“feeling into”), “sympathy”was the term\ncommonly used to refer to empathy-related phenomena. If one were to\npoint to a conceptual core for understanding these phenomena, it is\nprobably best to point to David Hume’s dictum that “the\nminds of men are mirrors to one another,”(Hume 1739–40\n[1978], 365) since in encountering other persons, humans can resonate\nwith and recreate that person’s thoughts and emotions on\ndifferent dimensions of cognitive complexity. While, as we will see,\nnot everybody shares such resonance conception of empathy(some\nphilosophers in the phenomenological tradition emphatically reject\nit), it certainly constitutes the center of Theodor Lipps’s\nunderstanding, who Titchener had in mind in his translation of\n“Einfühlung” as “empathy.”  \nTheodor Lipps (1851–1914)was also very familiar with the work of\nDavid Hume (see the introduction to Coplan and Goldie 2011 in this\nrespect). More importantly, it was Theodor Lipps, whose work\ntransformed empathy/Einfühlung from a concept of nineteenth\ncentury German aesthetics into a central category of the philosophy of\nthe social and human sciences. To understand this transformation we\nfirst need to appreciate the reasons why philosophers of the\nnineteenth century thought it necessary to appeal to empathy in order\nto account for our ability to appreciate natural objects and artefacts\nin an aesthetic manner. According to the dominant (even though not\nuniversally accepted) positivistic and empiricist conception, sense\ndata constitute the fundamental basis for our investigation of the\nworld. Yet from a phenomenological perspective, our perceptual\nencounter with aesthetic objects and our appreciation of them as being\nbeautiful—our admiration of a beautiful sunset, for\nexample—seems to be as direct as our perception of an object as\nbeing red or square. By appealing to the psychological mechanisms of\nempathy, philosophers intended to provide an explanatory account of\nthe phenomenological immediacy of our aesthetic appreciation of\nobjects. More specifically, for Lipps, our empathic encounter with\nexternal objects trigger inner “processes” that give rise\nto experiences similar to ones that I have when I engage in various\nactivities involving the movement of my body. Since my attention is\nperceptually focused on the external object, I experience\nthem—or I automatically project my experiences—as being in\nthe object. If those experiences are in some way apprehended in a\npositive manner and as being in some sense life-affirming, I perceive\nthe object as beautiful, otherwise as ugly. In the first case, Lipps\nspeaks of positive; in the later of negative empathy. Lipps also\ncharacterizes our experience of beauty as “objectified\nself-enjoyment,” since we are impressed by the\n“vitality” and “life potentiality” that lies\nin the perceived object (Lipps 1906, 1903 a,b. For the contemporary\ndiscussion of empathy’s role in aesthetics see particularly\nBreithaupt 2009; Coplan and Goldie 2011 (Part II); Curtis & Koch\n2009; and Keen 2007. For a recent history of the empathy concept see\nalso Lanzoni 2018). \nIn his Aesthetik, Lipps closely links our aesthetic\nperception and our perception of another embodied person as a minded\ncreature. The nature of aesthetic empathy is always the\n“experience of another human” (1905, 49).\nWe appreciate another object as beautiful because empathy allows us to\nsee it in analogy to another human body. Similarly, we recognize\nanother organism as a minded creature because of empathy. Empathy in\nthis context is more specifically understood as a phenomenon of\n“inner imitation,” where my mind mirrors the mental\nactivities or experiences of another person based on the observation\nof his bodily activities or facial expressions. Empathy is ultimately\nbased on an innate disposition for motor mimicry, a fact that is well\nestablished in the psychological literature and was already noticed by\nAdam Smith (1853). Even though such a disposition is not always\nexternally manifested, Lipps suggests that it is always present as an\ninner tendency giving rise to similar kinaesthetic sensations in the\nobserver as felt by the observed target. In seeing the angry face of\nanother person we instinctually have a tendency of imitating it and of\n“imitating” her anger in this manner. Since we are not\naware of such tendencies, we see the anger in her face (Lipps 1907).\nDespite the fact that Lipps’s primary examples of empathy focus\non the recognition of emotions expressed in bodily gestures or facial\nexpressions, his conception of empathy should not be understood as\nbeing limited to such cases. As his remarks about intellectual empathy\nsuggest (1903b/05), he regards our recognition of all mental\nactivities—insofar as they are activities requiring human\neffort—as being based on empathy or on inner imitation (See also\nthe introductory chapter in Stueber 2006). \nIt was indeed Lipps’s claim that empathy should be understood as\nthe primary epistemic means for gaining knowledge of other\nminds that was the focus of a lively debate among philosophers at the\nbeginning of the 20th century (Prandtl 1910, Stein 1917,\nScheler 1973). Even philosophers, who did not agree with Lipps’s\nspecific explication, found the concept of empathy appealing because\nhis argument for his position was closely tied to a thorough critique\nof what was widely seen at that time as the only alternative for\nconceiving of knowledge of other minds, that is, Mill’s\ninference from analogy. Traditionally, the inference from analogy\npresupposes a Cartesian conception of the mind according to which\naccess to our own mind is direct and infallible, whereas knowledge of\nother minds is inferential, fallible, and based on evidence about\nother persons’ observed physical behavior. More formally one can\ncharacterize the inference from analogy as consisting of the following\npremises or steps. \nLike Wittgenstein, but predating him considerably, Lipps argues in his\n1907 article “Das Wissen von fremden Ichen” that the\ninference from analogy falls fundamentally short of solving the\nphilosophical problem of other minds. Lipps does not argue against the\ninference from analogy because of its evidentially slim basis, but\nbecause it does not allow us to understand its basic presupposition\nthat another person has a mind that is psychologically similar to our\nown mind. The inference from analogy thus cannot be understood as\nproviding us with evidence for the claim that the other person has\nmental states like we do because, within its Cartesian framework, we\nare unable to conceive of other minds in the first place. For Lipps,\nanalogical reasoning requires the contradictory undertaking of\ninferring another person’s anger and sadness on the basis of my\nsadness and anger, yet to think of that sadness and anger\nsimultaneously as something “absolutely different” from my\nanger and sadness. More generally, analogical inference is a\ncontradictory undertaking because it entails “entertaining a\ncompletely new thought about an I, that however is not me, but\nsomething absolutely different” (Lipps 1907, 708, my\ntranslation). \nYet while Lipps diagnoses the problem of the inference of analogy\nwithin the context of a Cartesian conception of the mind quite\nsuccinctly, he fails to explain how empathy is able to provide us with\nan epistemically sanctioned understanding of other minds or why our\n“feeling into” the other person’s mind is more than\na mere projection. More importantly, Lipps does not sufficiently\nexplain why empathy does not encounter similar problems to the ones\ndiagnosed for the inference from analogy and how empathy allows us to\nconceive of other persons as having a mind similar to our own if we\nare directly acquainted only with our own mental states(See Stueber\n2006). Wittgenstein’s critique of the inference from analogy is\nin the end more penetrating because he recognizes that its problem\ndepends on a Cartesian account of mental concepts. If my grasp of a\nmental concept is exclusively constituted by me experiencing something\nin a certain way, then it is impossible for me to conceive of how that\nvery same concept can be applied to somebody else, given that I cannot\nexperience somebody else’s mental states. I therefore cannot\nconceive of how another person can be in the same mental state as I am\nbecause that would require that I can conceive of my mental state as\nsomething, which I do not experience. But according to the Cartesian\nconception this seems to be a conceptually impossible task. Moreover,\nif one holds on to a Cartesian conception of the mind, it is not clear\nhow appealing to empathy, as conceived of by Lipps, should help us in\nconceiving of mental states as belonging to another mind. \nWithin the phenomenological tradition, the above shortcomings of\nLipps’s position of empathy were quite apparent (see for example\nStein 1917, 24 and Scheler 1973, 236). Yet despite the fact that they\ndid not accept Lipps’s explication of empathy as being based on\nmechanisms of inner resonance and projection, authors within the\nphenomenological tradition of philosophy were persuaded by\nLipps’s critique of the inference from analogy. For that very\nreason, Husserl and Stein, for example, continued using the concept of\nempathy and regarded empathy as an irreducible “type of\nexperiential act sui generis” (Stein 1917, 10), which allows us\nto view another person as being analogous to ourselves without this\n“analogizing apprehension” constituting an inference of\nanalogy (Husserl 1931 [1963], 141). Scheler went probably the furthest in\nrejecting the Cartesian framework in thinking about the apprehension\nof other minds, while keeping committed to something like the concept\nof\n empathy.[1]\n (In order to contrast his position from Lipps, Scheler however\npreferred to use the term “nachfühlen” rather than\n“einfühlen.”) For Scheler, the fundamental mistake of\nthe debate about the apprehension of other minds consists in the fact\nthat it does not take seriously certain phenomenological facts. Prima\nfacie, we do not encounter merely the bodily movements of another\nperson. Rather, we are directly recognizing specific mental states\nbecause they are characteristically expressed in states of the human\nbody; in facial expressions, in gestures, in the tone of voice, and so\non. Empathy within the phenomenological tradition then is not\nconceived of as a resonance phenomenon requiring the observer to\nrecreate the mental states of the other person in his or her own mind\nbut as a special perceptual act (See Scheler 1973, particularly\n232–258; For a succinct explication of the debate about empathy\nin the phenomenological tradition consult Zahavi 2010) \nThe idea that empathy understood as inner imitation is the primary\nepistemic means for understanding other minds has however been revived\nin the 1980’s by simulation theorists in the context of the\ninterdisciplinary debate about folk psychology; an empirically\ninformed debate about how best to describe the underlying causal\nmechanisms of our folk psychological abilities to interpret, explain,\nand predict other agents. (See Davies and Stone 1995). In contrast to\ntheory theory, simulation theorists conceive of our ordinary\nmindreading abilities as an ego-centric method and as a\n“knowledge–poor” strategy, where I do not utilize a\nfolk psychological theory but use myself as a model for the other\nperson’s mental life. It is not the place here to discuss the\ncontemporary debate extensively, but it has to be emphasized that\ncontemporary simulation theorists vigorously discuss how to account\nfor our grasp of mental concepts and whether simulation theory is\ncommitted to Cartesianism. Whereas Goldman (2002, 2006) links his\nversion of simulation theory to a neo-Cartesian account of mental\nconcepts, other simulation theorists develop versions of simulation\ntheory that are not committed to a Cartesian conception of the mind.\n(Gordon 1995a, b, and 2000; Heal 2003; and Stueber 2006, 2012). \nMoreover, neuroscientific findings according to which so called mirror\nneurons play an important role in recognizing another person’s\nemotional states and in understanding the goal-directedness of his\nbehavior have been understood as providing empirical evidence for\nLipps’ idea of empathy as inner imitation. With the help of the\nterm “mirror neuron,” scientists refer to the fact that\nthere is significant overlap between neural areas of excitation that\nunderlie our observation of another person’s action and areas\nthat are stimulated when we execute the very same action. A similar\noverlap between neural areas of excitation has also been established\nfor our recognition of another person’s emotion based on his\nfacial expression and our experiencing the emotion. (For a survey on\nmirror neurons see Gallese 2003a and b, Goldman 2006, chap. 6; Keysers\n2011; Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; and particularly Rizzolatti and\nSinigaglia 2008).\n\nSince the face to face encounter between persons is\nthe primary situation within which human beings recognize themselves\nas minded creatures and attribute mental states to others, the system\nof mirror neurons has been interpreted as playing a causally central\nrole in establishing intersubjective relations between minded\ncreatures. For that very reason, the neuroscientist Gallese thinks of\nmirror neurons as constituting what he calls the “shared\nmanifold of intersubjectivity” (Gallese 2001, 44). Stueber\n(2006, chap. 4)—inspired by Lipps’s conception of empathy\nas inner imitation—refers to mirror neurons as mechanisms of\nbasic\n empathy;[2]\n as mechanisms that allow us to apprehend directly another\nperson’s emotions in light of his facial expressions and that\nenable us to understand his bodily movements as goal-directed actions,\nthat is, as being directed towards an external object like a person\nreaching for the cup. \n\nThe evidence from mirror neurons—and the\nfact that in perceiving other people we use very different\nneurobiological mechanisms than in the perception of physical\nobjects—does suggest that in our primary perceptual encounter\nwith the world we do not merely encounter physical objects. Rather,\neven on this basic level, we distinguish already between mere physical\nobjects and objects that are more like us (See also Meltzoff and\nBrooks 2001). The mechanisms of basic empathy have to be seen as\nNature’s way of dissolving one of the principal assumptions of\nthe traditional philosophical discussion about other minds shared by\nopposing positions such as Cartesianism and Behaviorism; that is, that\nwe perceive other people primarily as physical objects and do not\ndistinguish already on the perceptual level between physical objects\nlike trees and minded creatures like ourselves. Mechanisms of basic\nempathy might therefore be interpreted as providing us with a\nperceptual and non-conceptual basis for developing an\nintersubjectively accessible folk psychological framework that is\napplicable to the subject and observed other (Stueber 2006,\n142–45).  It needs to be acknowledged however that this\ninterpretation of mirror neurons crucially depends on the assumption\nthat the primary function of mirror neurons consists in providing us\nwith a cognitive grasp of another person’s actions and emotions.\nThis interpretation has however been criticized by researchers and\nphilosophers who think that neural resonance presupposes rather than\nprovides us with an understanding of what is going on in the minds of\nothers (Csibra 2007, Hickok 2008 and 2014). They have also pointed out\nthat in observing another person’s emotion or behavior, we never\nfully “mirror” another person’s neural stimulation.\nThe neuroscientist Jean Decety has argued that in observing another\nperson’s pain our vicariously stimulated pain matrix is not\nsensitive to the phenomenal quality of pain. Rather it is sensitive to\npain as an indicator of “aversion and withdrawal when exposed to\ndanger and threats”(Decety and Cowell 2015, 6 and Decety 2010).\nAt least as far as empathy for pain is concerned, our neural resonance\nis also modulated by a variety of contextual factors, such as how\nclose we feel to the observed subject, whether we regard the pain to\nbe morally justified (as in the case of punishment, for example) or\nwhether we regard it as unavoidable and necessary, such as in a\nmedical procedure (Singer and Lamm 2009; but see also Allen 2010, Borg\n2007, Debes 2010, Gallese 2016, Goldman 2009, Iacoboni 2011, Jacob\n2008, Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia 2016, and Stueber 2012a).  \nYet it should be noted that everyday mindreading is not restricted to\nthe realm of basic empathy. Ordinarily we not only recognize that\nother persons are afraid or that they are reaching for a particular\nobject. We understand their behavior in more complex social contexts\nin terms of their reasons for acting using the full range of\npsychological concepts including the concepts of belief and desire.\nEvidence from neuroscience shows that these mentalizing tasks involve\nvery different neuronal areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex,\ntemporoparietal cortex, and the cingulate cortex. (For a survey see\nKain and Perner 2003; Frith and Frith 2003; Zaki and Ochsner 2012).\nLow level mindreading in the realm of basic empathy has therefore to\nbe distinguished from higher levels of mindreading (Goldman 2006). It\nis clear that low level forms of understanding other persons have to\nbe conceived of as being relatively knowledge– poor as they do\nnot involve a psychological theory or complex psychological concepts.\nHow exactly one should conceive of high level mindreading abilities,\nwhether they involve primarily knowledge–poor simulation\nstrategies or knowledge–rich inferences is controversially\ndebated within the contemporary debate about our folk psychological\nmindreading abilities(See Davies and Stone 1995, Gopnik and Meltzoff\n1997, Gordon 1995, Currie and Ravenscroft 2002, Heal 2003, Nichols and\nStich 2003, Goldman 2006, and Stueber 2006). Simulation theorists,\nhowever, insist that even more complex forms of understanding other\nagents involve resonance phenomena that engage our cognitively\nintricate capacities of imaginatively adopting the perspective of\nanother person and reenacting or recreating their thought processes\n(For various forms of perspective-taking see Coplan 2011 and Goldie\n2000). Accordingly, simulation theorists distinguish between different\ntypes of empathy such as between basic and reenactive empathy (Stueber\n2006) or between mirroring and reconstructive empathy (Goldman 2011).\nInterestingly, the debate about how to conceive of these more complex\nforms of mindreading resonates with the traditional debate about\nwhether empathy is the unique method of the human sciences and whether\nor not one has to strictly distinguish between the methods of the\nhuman and the natural sciences. Equally noteworthy is the fact that in\nthe contemporary theory of mind debate voices have grown louder that\nassert that the contemporary theory of mind debate fundamentally\nmisconceives of the nature of social cognition. In light of insights\nfrom the phenomenological and hermeneutic traditions in philosophy,\nthey claim that on the most basic level empathy should not be\nconceived of as a resonance phenomenon but as a type of direct\nperception. (See particularly Zahavi 2010; Zahavi and Overgaard 2012,\nbut Jacob 2011 for a response). More complex forms of social cognition\nare also not to be understood as being based on either theory or\nempathy/simulation, rather they are better best conceived of as the\nability to directly fit observed units of actions into larger\nnarrative or cultural frameworks (For this debate see Gallagher 2012,\nGallagher and Hutto 2008, Hutto 2008, and Seemann 2011, Stueber 2011\nand 2012a, and various articles in Matravers and Waldow 2018). For\nskepticism about empathic perspective-taking understood as a complete\nidentification with the perspective of the other person see also\nGoldie 2011). Regardless of how one views this specific debate it\nshould be clear that ideas about mindreading developed originally by\nproponents of empathy at the beginning of the 20th century\ncan no longer be easily dismissed and have to be taken seriously. \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, empathy understood as\na non-inferential and non-theoretical method of grasping the content\nof other minds became closely associated with the concept of\nunderstanding (Verstehen); a concept that was championed by the\nhermeneutic tradition of philosophy concerned with explicating the\nmethods used in grasping the meaning and significance of texts, works\nof arts, and actions. (For a survey of this tradition see Grondin\n1994). Hermeneutic thinkers insisted that the method used in\nunderstanding the significance of a text or a historical event has to\nbe fundamentally distinguished from the method used in explaining an\nevent within the context of the natural sciences. This methodological\ndualism is famously expressed by Droysen in saying that\n“historical research does not want to explain; that is, derive\nin a form of an inferential argument, rather it wants to\nunderstand” (Droysen 1977, 403), and similarly in\nDilthey’s dictum that “we explain nature, but understand\nthe life of the soul” (Dilthey 1961, vol. 5, 144). Yet Droysen\nand authors before him never conceived of understanding solely as an\nact of mental imitation or solely as an act of imaginatively\n“transporting” oneself into the point of view of another\nperson. Such “psychological interpretation” as\nSchleiermacher (1998) used to call it, was conceived of as\nconstituting only one aspect of the interpretive method used by\nhistorians. Other tasks mentioned in this context involved critically\nevaluating the reliability of historical sources, getting to know the\nlinguistic conventions of a language, and integrating the various\nelements derived from historical sources into a consistent narrative\nof a particular epoch. The differences between these various aspects\nof the interpretive procedure were however downplayed in the early\nDilthey. For him, grasping the significance of any cultural fact had\nto be understood as a mental act of “transposition.” (See\nfor example Dilthey 1961, vol. 5, 263–265). . \nIronically, the close association of the concepts of empathy and\nunderstanding and the associated claim that empathy is the sole and\nunique method of the human sciences also facilitated the decline of\nthe empathy concept and its almost utter disregard by philosophers of\nthe human and social sciences later on, in both the analytic and\ncontinental/hermeneutic traditions of philosophy. Within both\ntraditions, proponents of empathy were—for very different\nreasons—generally seen as advocating an epistemically naïve\nand insufficiently broad conception of the methodological proceedings\nin the human sciences. As a result, most philosophers of the human and\nsocial sciences maintained their distance from the idea that empathy\nis central for our understanding of other minds and mental phenomena.\nNotable exceptions in this respect are R.G. Collingwood and his\nfollowers, who suggested that reenacting another person’s\nthoughts is necessary for understanding them as rational agents\n(Collingwood 1946, Dray 1957 and 1995). Notice however that in\ncontrast to the contemporary debate about folk psychology, the debate\nabout empathy in the philosophy of social science is not concerned\nwith investigating underlying causal mechanisms. Rather, it addresses\nnormative questions of how to justify a particular explanation or\ninterpretation. \nPhilosophers arguing for a hermeneutic conception of the human and\nsocial sciences insist on a strict methodological division between the\nhuman and the natural\n sciences.[3]\n Yet they nowadays favor the concept of understanding (Verstehen) and\nreject the earlier identification of understanding and empathy for two\nspecific reasons. First, empathy is no longer seen as the unique\nmethod of the human sciences because facts of significance, which a\nhistorian or an interpreter of literary and non-literary texts are\ninterested in, do not solely depend on facts within the individual\nmind. A historian, for example, is not bound by the agent’s\nperspective in telling the story of a particular historical time\nperiod(Danto 1965). Similarly, philosophers such as Hans Georg\nGadamer, have argued that the significance of a text is not tied to\nthe author’s intentions in writing the text. In reading a text\nby Shakespeare or Plato we are not primarily interested in finding out\nwhat Plato or Shakespeare said but what these texts themselves\nsay.(Gadamer 1989; for a critical discussion see Skinner (in Tully\n1988); “Introduction” in Kögler and Stueber 2000; and\nStueber 2002). \nThe above considerations, however, do not justify the claim that\nempathy has no role to play within the context of the human sciences.\nIt justifies merely the claim that empathy cannot be their only\nmethod, at least as long as one admits that recognizing the thoughts\nof individual agents has to play some role in the interpretive project\nof the human sciences. Accordingly, a second reason against empathy is\nalso emphasized. Conceiving of understanding other agents as being\nbased on empathy is seen as an epistemically extremely naïve\nconception of the interpretation of individual agents, since it seems\nto conceive of understanding as a mysterious meeting of two individual\nminds outside of any cultural context. Individual agents are always\nsocially and culturally embedded creatures. Understanding other agents\nthus presupposes an understanding of the cultural context within which\nan agent functions. Moreover, in the interpretive situation of the\nhuman sciences, the cultural background of the interpreter and the\nperson, who has to be interpreted, can be very different. In that\ncase, I can not very easily put myself in the shoes of the other\nperson and imitate his thoughts in my mind. If understanding medieval\nknights, to use an example of Winch (1958), requires me to think\nexactly as the medieval knight did, then it is not clear how such a\ntask can be accomplished from an interpretive perspective constituted\nby very different cultural presuppositions. Making sense of other\nminds has, therefore, to be seen as an activity that is a culturally\nmediated one; a fact that empathy theorists according to this line of\ncritique do not sufficiently take into account when they conceive of\nunderstanding other agents as a direct meeting of minds that is\nindependent of and unaided by information about how these agents are\nembedded in a broader social environment. (See Stueber 2006, chap.6,\nZahavi 2001, 2005; for the later Dilthey see Makreel 2000. For a\ncritical discussion of whether the concept of understanding without\nrecourse to empathy is useful for marking an epistemic distinction\nbetween the human and natural sciences consult also Stueber 2012b.\nWithin the context of anthropology, Hollan and Throop argue that\nempathy is best understood as a dynamic, culturally situated,\ntemporally extended, and dialogical process actively involving not\nonly the interpreter but also his or her interpretee. See Hollan\n20012; Hollan and Throop 2008, 2001; Throop 2010).). \nPhilosophers, who reject the methodological dualism between the human\nand the natural sciences as argued for in the hermeneutic context, are\ncommonly referred to as naturalists in the philosophy of social\nscience. They deny that the distinction between understanding and\nexplanation points to an important methodological difference. Even in\nthe human or social sciences, the main point of the scientific\nendeavor is to provide epistemically justified explanations (and\npredictions) of observed or recorded events (see also Henderson 1993).\nAt most, empathy is granted a heuristic role in the context of\ndiscovery. It however can not play any role within the context of\njustification. As particularly Hempel (1965) has argued, to explain an\nevent involves—at least implicitly—an appeal to law-like\nregularities providing us with reasons for expecting that an event of\na certain kind will occur under specific circumstances. Empathy might\nallow me to recognize that I would have acted in the same manner as\nsomebody else. Yet it does not epistemically sanction the claim that\nanybody of a particular type or anybody who is in that type of\nsituation will act in this manner. \nHempel’s argument against empathy has certainly not gone\nunchallenged. Within the philosophy of history, Dray (1957), following\nCollingwood, has argued that empathy plays an epistemically\nirreducible role, since we explain actions in terms of an\nagent’s reasons. For him, such reason explanations do not appeal\nto empirical generalizations but to normative principles of actions\noutlining how a person should act in a particular situation. Similar\narguments have been articulated by Jaegwon Kim (1984, 1998). Yet as\nStueber (2006, chap. 5) argues such a response to Hempel would require\nus to implausibly conceive of reason explanations as being very\ndifferent from ordinary causal explanations. It would imply that our\nnotions of explanation and causation are ambiguous concepts. Reasons\nthat cause agents to act in the physical world would be conceived of\nas causes in a very different sense than ordinary physical causes.\nMoreover, as Hempel himself suggests, appealing to normative\nprinciples explains at most why a person should have acted in a\ncertain manner. It does not explain why he ultimately acted in that\nway. Consequently, Hempel’s objection against empathy retain\ntheir force as long as one maintains that reason explanations are a\nform of ordinary causal explanations and as long as one conceives of\nthe epistemic justification of such explanations as implicitly\nappealing to some empirical generalizations (For Kim’s recent\nattempt to account for the explanatory character of action\nexplanations by acknowledging the centrality of the first person\nperspective see also Kim 2010).  \nDespite these concessions to Hempel, Stueber suggests that empathy\n(specifically reenactive empathy) has to be acknowledged as playing a\ncentral role even in the context of justification. For him, folk\npsychological explanations have to be understood as being tied to the\ndomain of rational agency. In contrast to explanations in terms of\nmere inner causes, folk psychological explanations retain their\nexplanatory force only as long as agents’ beliefs and desires\ncan also be understood as reasons for their actions. The epistemic\njustification of such folk psychological explanations implicitly\nrelies on generalizations involving folk psychological notions such as\nbelief and desire. Yet the existence of such generalizations alone\ndoes not establish specific beliefs and desires as reasons for a\nperson’s actions. Elaborating on considerations by Heal (2003)\nand Collingwood (1946), Stueber suggests that recognizing beliefs and\ndesires as reasons requires the interpreter to be sensitive to an\nagent’s other relevant beliefs and desires. Individual thoughts\nfunction as reasons for rational agency only relative to a specific\nframework of an agent’s thoughts that are relevant for\nconsideration in a specific situation. Most plausibly—given our\npersistent inability to solve the frame problem—recognizing\nwhich of another agent’s thoughts are relevant in specific\ncontexts requires the practical ability of reenacting another\nperson’s thoughts in one’s own mind. Empathy’s\ncentral epistemic role has to be admitted, since beliefs and desires\ncan be understood only in this manner as an agent’s reasons (See\nStueber 2006, 2008, 2013. For a related discussion about the role of\nunderstanding in contemporary epistemology and philosophy of science\nsee Grimm 2016 and Grimm, Baumberger, and Ammon 2017).  \nThe discussion of empathy within psychology has been largely\nunaffected by the critical philosophical discussion of empathy as an\nepistemic means to know other minds or as the unique method of the\nhuman sciences. Rather, psychologists’ interest in\nempathy–related phenomena harks back to eighteenth century moral\nphilosophy, particularly David Hume and Adam Smith (See also Wispe\n1991). Here empathy, or what was then called sympathy, was regarded to\nplay a central role in constituting human beings as social and moral\ncreatures allowing us to emotionally connect to our human companions\nand care for their well-being. Throughout the early 20th\ncentury, but particularly since the late 1940’s, empathy has,\ntherefore, been an intensively studied topic of psychological\nresearch. \nMore broadly one can distinguish two psychological research traditions\nstudying empathy–related phenomena; that is, the study of what\nis currently called empathic accuracy and the study of empathy as an\nemotional phenomenon in the encounter of others. The first area of\nstudy defines empathy primarily as a cognitive phenomenon and\nconceives of empathy in general terms as “the intellectual or\nimaginative apprehension of another’s condition or state of\nmind,” to use Hogan’s (1969) terminology. Within this area\nof research, one is primarily interested in determining the\nreliability and accuracy of our ability to perceive and recognize\nother persons’ enduring personality traits, attitudes and\nvalues, and occurrent mental states. One also investigates the various\nfactors that influence empathic accuracy. One has, for example, been\ninterested in determining whether empathic ability depends on gender,\nage, family background, intelligence, emotional stability, the nature\nof interpersonal relations, or whether it depends on specific\nmotivations of the observer. (For a survey see Ickes 1993 and 2003;\nand Taft 1955). A more detailed account of the research on empathic\naccuracy and some of its earlier methodological difficulties can be\nfound in the \nPhilosophically more influential has been the study of empathy defined\nprimarily as an emotional or affective phenomenon, which psychologists\nin the middle of the 1950’s started to focus on. In this\ncontext, psychologists have also addressed issues of moral motivation\nthat have been traditionally topics of intense discussions among moral\nphilosophers. They were particularly interested in investigating (i)\nthe development of various means for measuring empathy as a\ndispositional trait of adults and of children and as a situational\nresponse in specific situations, (ii) the factors on which empathic\nresponses and dispositions depend, and (iii) the relation between\nempathy and pro-social behavior and moral development. Before\ndiscussing the psychological research on emotional empathy and its\nrelevance for moral philosophy and moral psychology in the next\nsection, it is vital to introduce important conceptual distinctions\nthat one should keep in mind in evaluating the various empirical\nstudies. \nAnyone reading the emotional empathy literature has to be struck by\nthe fact that empathy tended to be incredibly broadly defined in the\nbeginning of this specific research tradition. Stotland, one of the\nearliest researcher who understood empathy exclusively as an emotional\nphenomenon, defined it as “an observer’s reacting\nemotionally because he perceives that another is experiencing or is\nabout to experience an emotion” (1969, 272). According to\nStotland’s definition very diverse emotional responses such as\nfeeling envy, feeling annoyed, feeling distressed, being relieved\nabout, feeling pity, or feeling what Germans call\nSchadenfreude (feeling joyful about the misfortune of\nanother) have all to be counted as empathic reactions. Since the\n1980’s however, psychologists have fine tuned their\nunderstanding of empathy conceptually and distinguished between\ndifferent aspects of the emotional reaction to another person; thereby\nimplicitly acknowledging the conceptual distinctions articulated by\nMax Scheler (1973) almost a century earlier. In this context, it is\nparticularly useful to distinguish between the following reactive\nemotions that are differentiated in respect to whether or not such\nreactions are self or other oriented and whether they presuppose\nawareness of the distinction between self and others. (See also the\nsurvey in the Introduction to Eisenberg/Strayer 1987 and\nBatson 2009)  \nEmotional contagion: Emotional contagion occurs when\npeople start feeling similar emotions caused merely by the association\nwith other people. You start feeling joyful, because other people\naround you are joyful or you start feeling panicky because you are in\na crowd of people feeling panic. Emotional contagion however does not\nrequire that one is aware of the fact that one experiences the\nemotions because other people experience them, rather one experiences\nthem primarily as one’s own emotion (Scheler 1973, 22). A\nnewborn infant’s reactive cry to the distress cry of another,\nwhich Hoffman takes as a “rudimentary precursor of empathic\ndistress” (Hoffman 2000, 65), can probably be understood as a\nphenomenon of emotional contagion, since the infant is not able to\nproperly distinguish between self and other. \nAffective and proper Empathy: More narrowly and\nproperly understood, empathy in the affective sense is the vicarious\nsharing of an affect. Authors however differ in how strictly they\ninterpret the phrase of vicariously sharing an affect. For some, it\nrequires that the empathizers and the persons they empathize with need\nto be in very similar affective states (Coplan 2011; de Vignemont and\nSinger 2006; Jacob 2011). For Hoffman, on the other hand, it is an\nemotional response requiring only “the involvement of\npsychological processes that make a person have feelings that are more\ncongruent with another’s situation than with his own\nsituation” (Hoffman 2000, 30). According to this definition,\nempathy does not necessarily require that the subject and target feel\nsimilar emotions (even though this is most often the case). Rather the\ndefinition also includes cases of feeling sad when seeing a child who\nplays joyfully but who does not know that it has been diagnosed with a\nserious illness (assuming that this is how the other person himself or\nherself would feel if he or she would fully understand his or her\nsituation). In contrast to mere emotional contagion, genuine empathy\npresupposes the ability to differentiate between oneself and the\nother. It requires that one is minimally aware of the fact that one is\nhaving an emotional experience due to the perception of the\nother’s emotion, or more generally due to attending to his\nsituation. In seeing a sad face of another and feeling sad oneself,\nsuch feeling of sadness should count as genuinely empathic only if one\nrecognizes that in feeling sad one’s attention is still focused\non the other and that it is not an appropriate reaction to aspects of\none’s own life. Moreover, empathy outside the realm of a direct\nperceptual encounter involves some appreciation of the other\nperson’s emotion as an appropriate response to his or her\nsituation. To be happy or unhappy because one’s child is happy\nor sad should not count necessarily as an empathic emotion. It cannot\ncount as a vicarious emotional response if it is due to the perception\nof the outside world from the perspective of the observer and her\ndesire that her children should be happy. My happiness about my child\nbeing happy would therefore not be an emotional state that is more\ncongruent to his situation. Rather, it is an emotional response\nappropriate to my own perspective on the world. In order for my\nhappiness or unhappiness to be genuinely empathic it has to be\nhappiness or unhappiness about what makes the other person happy.\nAccordingly, if I share another person’s emotion vicariously I\ndo not merely have to be in an affective state with a similar\nphenomenal quality. Rather my affective state has to be directed\ntoward the same intentional object. (See Sober and Wilson 1998,\n231–237 and Maibom 2007. For a critical discussion of how and\nwhether such vicarious sharing is possible see also Deonna 2007 and\nMatravers 2018). It should be noted, however, that some authors\nconceive of proper empathy more broadly as not merely being concerned\nwith the vicarious reenactment of affective states but more\ncomprehensively as including non-affective states such as beliefs and\ndesires. This is especially true if they are influenced by the\ndiscussion of of empathy as an epistemic means such as Goldman (2011)\nand Stueber (2006). However, already Adam Smith (1853) constitutes a\ngood example for such broad understanding of proper empathy. Finally,\nothers suggest that it is best to distinguish between affective\nsharing and perspective taking (Decety and Cowell 2015).  \nSympathy: In contrast to affective empathy,\nsympathy—or what some authors also refer to as empathic\nconcern—is not an emotion that is congruent with the\nother’s emotion or situation such as feeling the sadness of the\nother person’s grieving for the death of his father. Rather,\nsympathy is seen as an emotion sui generis that has the\nother’s negative emotion or situation as its object from the\nperspective of somebody who cares for the other person’s well\nbeing (Darwall 1998). In this sense, sympathy consists of\n“feeling sorrow or concern for the distressed or needy\nother,” a feeling for the other out of a “heightened\nawareness of the suffering of another person as something that needs\nto be alleviated.” (Eisenberg 2000a, 678; Wispe 1986, 318; and\nWispe 1991). \nWhereas it is quite plausible to assume that empathy—that is,\nempathy with negative emotions of another or what Hoffman (2000) calls\n“veridical empathic distress”—under certain\nconditions (and when certain developmental markers are achieved) can\ngive rise to sympathy, it should be stressed that the relation between\naffective empathy and sympathy is a contingent one; the understanding\nof which requires further empirical research. First, sympathy does not\nnecessarily require feeling any kind of congruent emotions on part of\nthe observer, a detached recognition or representation that the other\nis in need or suffers might be sufficient. (See Scheler 1973 and\nNichols 2004). Second, empathy or empathic distress might not at all\nlead to sympathy. People in the helping professions, who are so\naccustomed to the misery of others, suffer at times from compassion\nfatigue. It is also possible to experience empathic overarousal\nbecause one is emotionally so overwhelmed by one’s empathic\nfeelings that one is unable to be concerned with the suffering of the\nother (Hoffman 2000, chap. 8). In the later case, one’s empathic\nfeeling are transformed or give rise to mere personal distress, a\nreactive emotional phenomenon that needs to be distinguished from\nemotional contagion, empathy, and sympathy. \nPersonal Distress: Personal distress in the context\nof empathy research is understood as a reactive emotion in response to\nthe perception/recognition of another’s negative emotion or\nsituation. Yet, while personal distress is other-caused like\nsympathy, it is, in contrast to sympathy, primarily\nself-oriented. In this case, another person’s distress\ndoes not make me feel bad for him or her, it just makes\nme feel bad, or “alarmed, grieved, upset, worried,\ndisturbed, perturbed, distressed,and troubled;” to use the list\nof adjectives that according to Batson’s research indicates\npersonal distress (Batson et al. 1987 and Batson 1991). And, in\ncontrast to empathic emotions as defined above, my personal distress\nis not any more congruent with the emotion or situation of another.\nRather it wholly defines my own outlook onto the world. \nWhile it is conceptually necessary to differentiate between these\nvarious emotional responses, it has to be admitted that it is\nempirically not very easy to discriminate between them, since they\ntend to occur together. Think or imagine yourself attending the\nfuneral of the child of a friend or good acquaintance. This is\nprobably one reason why early researchers tended not to distinguish\nbetween the above aspects in their study of empathy related phenomena.\nYet since the above distinctions refer to very different psychological\nmechanisms, it is absolutely central to distinguish between them when\nempirically assessing the impact and contribution of empathy to an\nagent’s pro-social motivation and behavior. Given the ambiguity\nof the empathy concept within psychology—particularly in the\nearlier literature—in evaluating and comparing different\nempirical empathy studies, it is always crucial to keep in mind how\nempathy has been defined and measured within the context of these\nstudies. For a more extensive discussion of the methods used by\npsychologists to measure empathy see the \nMoral philosophers have always been concerned with moral psychology\nand with articulating an agent’s motivational structure in order\nto explicate the importance of morality for a human life. After all,\nmoral judgments supposedly make demands on an agent’s will and\nare supposed to provide us with reasons and motivations for acting in\na certain manner. Yet moral judgments, at least in the manner in which\nwe conceive of them in modern times, are also regarded to be based on\nnormative standards that, in contrast to mere conventional norms, have\nuniversal scope and are valid independent of the features of specific\nsocial practices that agents are embedded in. One only needs to think\nof statements such as “cruelty to innocent children or slavery\nis morally wrong,” which we view as applying also to social\npractices where the attitude of its population seem to condone such\nactions. Moral judgements thus seem to address us from the perspective\nof the moral stance where we leave behind the perspective of self-love\nand do not conceive of each other either as friends or foes (see Hume\n1987, 75) or as belonging to the in–group or out–group,\nbut where we view each other all to be equal part of a moral\ncommunity. Finally, and relatedly, in order to view morality as\nsomething that is possible for human beings we also seem to require\nthat our motivations based on or associated with moral reasons have a\nself-less character. Given to charity for merely selfish reasons, for\nexample, seems to clearly diminish its moral worth and implicitly deny\nthe universal character of a moral demand. Philosophically explicating\nthe importance of morality for human life then has to do the\nfollowing: It has to explain how it is that we humans as a matter of\nfact do care about morality thusly conceived, it has to address the\nphilosophically even more pertinent question of why it is that we\nshould care about morality or why it is that we should regard\njudgments issued from the perspective of the moral stance to have\nnormative authority over us; and it has to allow us to understand how\nit is that we can act self-lessly in a manner that correspond to the\ndemands made on us from the moral stance. Answering all of these\nquestions however necessitates at one point to explain how our moral\ninterests are related to our psychological constitution as human\nbeings and how moral demands can be understood as being appropriately\naddressed to agents who are psychologically structured in that manner.\n \nPrima facie, the difficulty of this enterprise consists in squaring a\nrealistic account of human psychology with the universal scope and\nintersubjective validity of moral judgments, since human motivation\nand psychological mechanisms seem to be always situational, local, and\nof rather limited scope. Moreover, as evolutionary psychologists tell\nus in–group bias seems to be a universal trait of human\npsychology. One of the most promising attempts to solve this problem\nis certainly due to the tradition of eighteenth century moral\nphilosophy associated with the names of David Hume and Adam Smith who\ntried to address all of the above philosophical desiderata by pointing\nto the central role that our empathic and sympathetic capacities have\nfor constituting us as social and moral agents and for providing us\nwith the psychological capacities to make and to respond to moral\njudgments. While philosophers in the Kantian tradition, who favor\nreason over sentiments, have generally been skeptical about this\nproposal, more recently the claim that empathy is central for morality\nand a flourishing human life has again been the topic of an intense\nand controversial debate. On the one hand, empathy has been hailed by\nresearchers from a wide range of disciplines and also by some public\nfigures, President Obama most prominently among them. Slote (2010)\nchampions empathy as the sole foundation of moral judgment, de Waal\n(2006) conceives of it as the unique evolutionary building block of\nmorality, Rifkin (2009) regards it even as a force whose cultivation\nhas unique revolutionary powers to transform a world in crisis, and\nBaron-Cohen (2011, 194) views it as a “universal solvent”\nin that “any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble.”\nOn the other hand, such empathy enthusiasm has encountered penetrating\ncriticism by Prinz (2011 a,b) and Bloom (2016), who emphasize its dark\nside, that is, its tendency to fall prey to so–called\n“here and now” biases. The following subsections will\naddress these issues by surveying the relevant empirical research on\nthe question whether empathy motivates us in a self-less manner, the\nquestion of whether empathy is inherently biased and partial to the\nin-group, and it will discuss how we might think of the normative\ncharacter of moral judgments in light of our empathic capacities.(For\na survey of other relevant issues from social psychology, specifically\nsocial neuroscience, consult also Decety and Lamm 2006; Decety and\nIckes 2009, and Decety 20012. For a discussion of the importance\nempathy for medical practice see Halpern 2001) \nIn a series of ingeniously designed experiments, Batson has\naccumulated evidence for what he calls the empathy-altruism thesis. In\narguing for this thesis, Batson conceives of empathy as empathic\nconcern or what others would call sympathy. More specifically, he\ncharacterized it in terms of feelings of being sympathetic, moved by,\nbeing compassionate, tender, warm and soft-hearted towards the\nother’s plight (Batson et al. 1987, 26) The task of his\nexperiments consists in showing that empathy/sympathy does indeed lead\nto genuinely altruistic motivation, where the welfare of the other is\nthe ultimate goal of my helping behavior, rather than to helping\nbehavior because of predominantly egoistic motivations. According to\nthe egoistic interpretation of empathy–related phenomena,\nempathizing with another person in need is associated with a negative\nfeeling or can lead to a heightened awareness of the negative\nconsequences of not helping; such as feelings of guilt, shame, or\nsocial sanctions. Alternatively, it can lead to an enhanced\nrecognition of the positive consequences of helping behavior such as\nsocial rewards or good feelings. Empathy according to this\ninterpretation induces us to help through mediation of purely egoistic\nmotivations. We help others only because we recognize helping behavior\nas a means to egoistic ends. It allows us to reduce our negative\nfeelings (aversive arousal reduction hypothesis), to avoid\n“punishment,” or to gain specific internal or external\n“rewards” (empathy-specific punishment and\nempathy-specific reward hypotheses). \nNotice however that in arguing for the empathy-altruism thesis, Batson\nis not claiming that empathy always induces helping behavior. Rather,\nhe argues against the predominance of an egoistic interpretation of an\nagent’s motivational structure. He argues for the existence of\ngenuinely altruistic motivations and more specifically for the claim\nthat empathy causes such genuinely altruistic motivation. These\ngenuinely altruistic motives (together with other egoistic motives)\nare taken into account by the individual agent in deliberating about\nwhether or not to help. Even for Batson, the question of whether the\nagent will act on his or her altruistic motivations depends ultimately\non how strong they are and what costs the agent would incur in helping\nanother person. \nThe basic set up of Batson’s experiments consists in the\nmanipulation of the situation of the experimental subjects (dependent\non the egoistic alternative to be argued against) and the manipulation\nof empathy/sympathy felt for an observed target in need. The decisive\nevidence for the empathy/sympathy-altruism thesis is always the\nrecorded behavior of the subject, who is in a high empathy condition\nand in a situation where his helping behavior can not plausibly be\nseen as a means for the satisfaction of a personal goal. Since here is\nnot the place to extensively describe the details of Batson’s\nexperiments, a brief description of the experimental set\nup—focusing on Batson’s argument against the aversive\narousal interpretation of empathy—and a brief evaluation of the\nsuccess of his general argumentative strategy has to suffice (for more\ndetails see Batson 1991 and 2011). In all of his experiments, Batson\nassumes—based on Stotland (1969) and others—that\nempathy/sympathy can be manipulated either by manipulating the\nperceived similarity between subjects and targets or by manipulating\nthe perspective taking attitude of the subjects. Empathy according to\nthese assumptions can be increased by enhancing the perceived\nsimilarity between subject and target or by asking the subject to\nimagine how the observed person would feel in his or her situation\nrather than asking the subject to attend carefully to the information\nprovided. [Note also that instructing the subject to imagine how they\nthemselves would feel in the other’s situation, rather than\ninstructing them to imagine how the other feels, is associated with an\nincrease in personal distress and not only sympathetic feelings.\n(Batson et al. 1997b and Lamm, Batson, and Decety 2007).] \nIn trying to argue against the aversive arousal reduction\ninterpretation, Batson also manipulates the ease with which a subject\ncan avoid helping another person (in this case taking his place when\nthey see him getting electric shocks). He reasons that if empathy\nleads to genuinely altruistic motivations, subjects in the high\nempathy/easy escape condition should still be willing to help. If they\nwere only helping in order to reduce their own negative feelings, they\nwould be expected to leave in this situation, since leaving is the\nless costly means for reaching an egoistic goal. As Batson was happy\nto report, the results confirmed his empathy/sympathy-altruism\nhypothesis, not only in the above experiments but also in experiments\ntesting other alternative interpretations of empathy such as the\nempathy- specific punishment and the empathy-specific award\nhypotheses. \nResearchers generally agree in finding Batson’s experimental\nresearch program and the accumulated evidence for the empathy-altruism\nthesis to be impressive. Yet they disagree about how persuasive one\nshould ultimately regard his position. In particular it has been\npointed out that his experiments have limited value, since they target\nonly very specific egoistic accounts of why empathy might lead to\nhelping behavior. Batson is not able to dismiss conclusively every\nalternative egoistic interpretation. In addition, it has been claimed\nthat egoism has the resources to account for the result of his\nexperiments. For example, one might challenge the validity of\nBatson’s interpretation by speculating whether empathy/sympathy\nleads to a heightened awareness of the fact that one will be troubled\nby bad memories of seeing another person in need, if one does nothing\nto help him or her. In this case even an egoistically motivated person\nwould help in the high empathy/easy escape condition. (For this reply\nand various other egoistic interpretations of Batson’s\nexperiments see Sober and Wilson 1998, 264–271). \nCialdini and his collaborators have suggested an even more elaborate\nnon-altruistic interpretation of helping behavior in high empathy/easy\nescape conditions. According to their suggestions, conditions of high\nempathy are also conditions of increased “interpersonal unity,\nwherein the conception of self and other are not distinct but are\nmerged to some degree” (Cialdini et al. 1997, 490). It is this\nincreased feeling of oneness rather than empathy that is causally\nresponsible for motivating helping behavior (See however Batson et al.\n1997a, Neuberg et al. 1997, and Batson 1997 and 2011 for a plausible\nreply and May 2018, 144–153 for a probing discussion of the\nrelation between empathic concern and oneness). One therefore has to\nbe cautious in claiming that Batson has conclusively proven that the\nempathy/sympathy-altruism hypothesis is true, if that means one has\nlogically excluded every egoistic alternative in accounting for\nhelping behavior. But it has to be acknowledged that Batson has\nradically changed the argumentative dialectic of the egoism-altruism\ndebate by forcing the egoistic account of human agency to come up with\never more elaborate alternative interpretations in order to account\nfor helping behavior within its framework. Egoism was supposed to\nprovide a rather unified and relatively simple account of the\nmotivational structure of human agency. In challenging the\npredominance and simplicity of this framework in an empirically acute\nfashion, Batson has at least established altruism—claiming that\nbesides egoistic motivations we are also motivated by genuinely\naltruistic reasons—as an empirically plausible hypothesis. He\nhas shown it to be a hypothesis one is almost persuaded to believe\nthat it is true, as he himself recently has characterized his own\nepistemic attitude (Batson 1997, 522.) More positively expressed,\nBatson’s research has at least demonstrated that\nempathy/sympathy is a causal factor in bringing about helping\nbehavior. Regardless of the question of the exact nature of the\nunderlying motivation for helping or prosocial behavior, psychologists\ngenerally assume that in adults and children a positive, even if weak,\ncorrelation between empathy—measured in a variety of\nways—and prosocial behavior has been established; and this\ndespite the fact that the above aspects of emotional responding to\nanother person have not always been sufficiently distinguished.(For a\nsurvey see Eisenberg and Miller 1987; Eisenberg/Fabes 1998, Spinrad\nand Eisenberg 2014. For a general survey of the various factors\ncontributing to prosocial behavior see Bierhoff 2002). \nRegardless of how exactly one views the strength of Batson’s\nposition, his research alone does not validate the thesis, articulated\nby various traditional moral philosophers, that sympathy or empathy is\nthe basis of morality or that it constitutes the only source for moral\nmotivation. First, nothing in his research has shown that\nempathy/sympathy is empirically necessary for moral agency. Second,\nsome of Batson’s own research casts doubt on the claim that\nsympathy/empathy is the foundation of morality as empathy induced\naltruism can lead to behavior that conflicts with our principles of\njustice and fairness. One, for example, tends to assign a better job\nor a higher priority for receiving medical treatment to persons with\nwhom one has actually sympathized, in violation of the above moral\nprinciples (See Batson et al. 1995). For that very reason, Batson\nhimself distinguishes between altruistic motivation concerned with the\nwell-being of another person and moral motivation guided by principles\nof justice and fairness (Batson 2011). Unfortunately we do not always\nrealize this fact when we abstractly contrast moral motivation broadly\nwith egoistic motivation. For that very reason, we also do not realize\nthat we need to be more conscious in “orchestrating” the\nrelationship between altruistic and moral motivations in order to\nfully utilize the motivational power of altruism for moral purposes\n(Batson 2014). Finally, the research discussed so far is not relevant\nfor deciding the question of whether sophisticated mindreading\nabilities are required for full blown moral agency, since Batson\nunderstands empathy primarily as an emotional phenomenon. (See Nichols\n2001 and Batson et al. 2003 in this respect.) \nWithin the psychological literature, one of the most comprehensive\naccounts of empathy and its relation to the moral development of a\nperson is provided by the work of Martin Hoffman (for a summary see\nhis 2000). Hoffman views empathy as a biologically based disposition\nfor altruistic behavior (Hoffman 1981). He conceives of empathy as\nbeing due to various modes of arousal allowing us to respond\nempathically in light of a variety of distress cues from another\nperson. Hoffman mentions mimicry, classical conditioning, and direct\nassociation—where one empathizes because the other’s\nsituation reminds one of one’s own painful experience—as\n“fast acting and automatic” mechanisms producing an\nempathic response. As more cognitively demanding modes, Hoffman lists\nmediated association—where the cues for an empathic response are\nprovided in a linguistic medium—and role taking. \nHoffman distinguishes between six (or more) developmental stages of\nempathic responses ranging from the reactive newborn cry, egocentric\nempathic distress, quasi-ego-centric empathic distress, to veridical\nempathy, empathy for another beyond the immediate situation, and\nempathy for whole groups of people. Accordingly, empathic responses\nconstitute a developmental continuum that ranges from emotional\ncontagion (as in the case of a reactive newborn cry) to various forms\nof proper empathy reached at the fourth stage. At the developmentally\nlater stages, the child is able to emotionally respond to the distress\nof another in a more sophisticated manner due to an increase of\ncognitive capacities, particularly due to the increased cognitive\nability to distinguish between self and other and by becoming aware of\nthe fact that others have mental states that are independent from its\nown. Only at the fourth stage of empathic development (after the\nmiddle of the second year) do children acquire such abilities. They do\nno longer try to comfort themselves, when emotionally responding to\nanother child’s distress—like seeking comfort from their\nown mother—, or use helping strategies that are more appropriate\nto comfort themselves than the other person—like using their own\nteddy-bear in trying to comfort the other child. Only at the fourth\nstage does empathy become also transformed or associated with sympathy\nleading to appropriate prosocial behavior. Hoffman’s\ndevelopmental view is further supported by Preston and DeWaal’s\naccount of empathy as a phenomenon to be observed across species at\nvarious levels of complexities related to different degrees of\ncognitive development. (Preston and DeWaal 2002a,b. For a discussion\nof the philosophical relevance of DeWaal’s view see also DeWaal\n2006). \nSignificantly, Hoffman combines his developmental explication of\nempathy with a sophisticated analysis of its importance for moral\nagency. He is thereby acutely aware of the limitations in our natural\ncapacity to empathize or sympathize with others, particularly what he\nrefers to as “here and now” biases, that is, the fact that\nwe tend to empathize more with persons that are in some sense\nperceived to be closer to us. (For a neuro-scientific investigation of\nhow racial bias modulates empathic responses see Xuo, Zuo, Wang and\nHan 2009). Like Batson, Hoffman does not regard the moral realm as\nbeing exclusively circumscribed by our ability to empathize with other\npeople. Besides empathic abilities, moral agency requires also\nknowledge of abstract moral principles, such as the principles of\ncaring and justice. Hoffman seems to conceive of those principles as\nbeing derived from cognitive sources that are independent from our\nempathic abilities. Yet Hoffmann is rather optimistic about the\nnatural compatibility of empathic motivation and our commitment to\nmoral principles. He regards stable and effective moral agency as\nrequiring empathy so that moral principles can have a motivational\nbasis in an agent’s psychology. Within this context, he has\nlately emphasized a final stage of empathy development or what he\ncalls “witnessing”, an empathic response to the suffering\nof others that is so intense that we “become fully committed to\nhelp”(Hoffman 2014, 82). As he explains—in light of\nexamples from the history of abolitionism, the civil rights movement,\nserfdom reform in Russia, and various cases before the Supreme\nCourt— it is particularly such witnessing that has contributed\ntowards bending the arc of the moral universe towards justice.\nAccordingly, and despite our natural limitations in empathizing with\nothers, Hoffman still regards empathy as the “bedrock of\nmorality” and “the glue of society”(Hoffman 2014,\n96. Besides Hoffman 2011 and 2014, see also Deigh 2011 for a measured\nevaluation of empathy in the legal context ).  \nMore recently, such ultimately positive evaluation of empathy’s\ncontributing role in constituting us as moral agents, as agents who\naddress each other from the moral stance, has encountered penetrating\ncriticism, particularly by Prinz (2011a,b) and Bloom (2016). Both\nemphasize the dark side of empathy, that is, the aforementioned\n“here and now” biases. More specifically Prinz mentions\nexplicitly the cuteness, salience, and proximity effects—the\nfact that we tend to empathize more easily with attractive persons,\nwith persons that are in close proximity and only if their suffering\nis particularly noteworthy— similarity biases and the fact that\nwe tend to be rather selective in choosing whom to empathize with.\nEmpathy is also very easily modulated by a variety of top-down factors\nthat influence our perception of the social world and that let us\nregister social divisions that seem to be prima facie incompatible\nwith the more impartial stance demanded by the moral perspective.\nResearch has documented these biases in a more fine-grained manner and\nshown that subjects generally “reported experiencing more\nempathy for the in–group then the out–group targets and\nmore counter–empathy for the out–group than in–group\ntargets”(Cikara et. al. 2014, 120), counter–empathy here\nbeing understood as the feeling of pleasure at the misfortune of\nanother (Schadenfreude) or the feeling displeasure at something\nfortunate happening to another (Glückschmerz). This is\nparticularly true if the other group is viewed to be in competition\nwith one’s own group. Empathy can also be further reduced\nthrough various dehumanizing and objectifying strategies, strategies\nthat have certainly employed in the context of the genocides of the\ntwentieth century and the system of racial slavery in the United\nStates (See Fuchs 2019, Kteily and Bruneau 2017). Heightened empathy\nfor perceived wrongs done to members of the in–group can also\nlead to violent and immoral behavior (Bloom 2016, chap. 5). In\naddition, empathy tends to focus on the one (particularly if he or she\nis identifiable) rather than the many, what Bloom refers to as its\nspotlight feature. Empathy can mislead us particularly in contexts\nwhere we need to take into account statistically relevant information\nwhen addressing a moral or social problem, such as when thinking about\nthe benefits of vaccination where it is more appropriate to think\nabout the large numbers of children saved rather than empathizing with\nthe bad effects such vaccination might have on one specific child. For\nall of these reasons, Prinz favors the moral emotions such as anger,\nguilt and shame as the foundation for morality, while Bloom prefers\nsympathy guided by reason as a more viable means than empathy to steer\nus in moral matters. \nHere is not the place for a final evaluation of empathy’s\ncontribution in regard to pro-social and moral motivation or moral and\npro-social behavior, since this question is still very much the topic\nof an ongoing empirical investigation. Yet the following observations\nare certainly justified in light of the empirical evidence so far and\nmight help to further clarify the debate. First, it seems to be pretty\nwell established that however one defines our natural capacity for\nempathy, it is on its own not sufficient to keep us reliably on the\npath of morality (See also Decety and Cowell 2015). Whether that\nultimately means that we should think of our capacity for empathy as a\nlimited resource or whether it would be better to think of empathy as\na motivated phenomenon and its limitations as being due to our\nreluctance to activate that capacity (Zaki 2014), is certainly another\nintriguing question for further empirical inquiry. One might also\nwonder why we should expect that the emotions such as sympathy and\nanger, which Bloom and Prinz point to, are less prone to bias and less\naffected by a universal human tendency to favor the in–group.\nCertainly sympathy within the context of Buddhism, to which Bloom\nappeals to is a highly regulated emotion, controlled through\nmindfulness practices or meditation and guided by an intellectual\ngrasp about the detriments of various forms of attachment to this\nworld. Persson and Savulescu (2018) therefore suggest that rather than\ngiving up on empathy completely one should reform empathy by\nregulating it through one’s reflective capacities in light of\nour knowledge of its natural shortcomings or focus one’s empathy\n(cognitive and affective) particularly on another person’s\nconcerns for his or her well-being as such empathy includes sympathy\nfor the other (Simmons 2014). Such suggestions are also very much in\nline with proposals by David Hume and Adam Smith, who suggested\nalready in the eighteenth century that we need to regulate empathy\nwith the help of certain corrective mechanisms such as “some\nsteady and general points of view” or the perspective of\nthe“impartial spectator” in order to compensate for\nempathy’s limited scope. (For a good analysis of the\nphilosophical discussion about empathy/sympathy in the eighteenth\ncentury see Frazer 2010).  \nMost importantly, in order to evaluate the empirical discussion about\nempathy’s role for morality, one needs to be very sensitive to\nhow researchers define and measure empathy in arguing for and against\nempathy’s relation to moral motivation or moral judgment. Prinz\nand Bloom are quite explicit in defining empathy merely as an\naffective phenomenon, as our ability to feel what the other person\nfeels. Evidence suggests indeed that merely sharing another\nperson’s emotion empathically does not increase our concern or\nmotivation for moral or pro-social action. Interestingly, however,\nperspective–taking and empathic concern/sympathy, which have\nalways been seen as an integral part of empathy-related phenomena, are\na slightly different matter. They do seem to be positively related to\ncooperation and charitable giving (Jordon et. al. 2016), to reducing\nprejudices against particular groups (Galinski and Morowitz 2011), and\nto an increase in one’s sensitivity to injustices done to others\n(Decety and Yoder 2015). Yet even here further research is needed as\nthe effects of such perspective–taking could be modulated by the\npower differential between groups. It has, for example, been shown\nthat in active intergroup conflicts, positive intergroup interaction\ncan increase empathy for the other group. Yet within such contexts,\ntaking the perspective of a person from the other group while\ninteracting with them might also hinder the development of intergroup\nempathy if the dominant group is reminded through such\nperspective–taking of how they might be viewed by the\nnon-dominant group. Even perspective taking by the non–dominant\ngroup might increase rather than decrease established negative\nstereotypes in thinking about the other group (Cikara et. al. 2014).\nIt seems more effective if the non–dominant group is asked to\narticulate the difficulties of their lives (perspective–giving)\nand the dominant group is asked to translate that description into\ntheir own words (perspective–taking), even if the positive\neffects of such interaction is relatively short-lived (Bruneau and\nSaxe 2012).  \nSo far, this entry has discussed mainly research exploring the\nrelation between empathy and prosocial/moral behavior or motivation.\nOther important areas for considering empathy’s role in moral\nmatters have to do with addressing the questions of how and whether\nempathy contributes to our ability to distinguish between moral and\nconventional norms, to the making of moral judgments, and how empathy\ncan be appealed to in explicating the normative authority of such\njudgments. In considering the first question, psychologists and\nphilosophers have generally followed Turiel in understanding moral\nnorms as expressing concerns for “rights, justice, and the\nwelfare of other people” (Turiel 1983, 3) and as having a very\nspecific “signature response patterns” (Kelly et. al.\n2007) associated with it. Moral norms are generally regarded to be\nmore important than conventional norms in that their normative\nvalidity is conceived as being independent of social authority or\nspecific social practices and agreements. Their scope is also judged\nto be much broader—they are thought of to be valid in other\ncountries, for example—, and violation of moral norms is\ngenerally understood to be a more serious offense than the violation\nof other norms. Notice however that in distinguishing between moral\nand conventional norms subjects do not necessarily associate a strict\nuniversality in the Kantian sense with moral norms and view them as\napplicable to all rational beings. Indeed there is some evidence that\n6–9 year old children, for example, view the moral/conventional\ndistinction as being fully applicable only to behavior of individuals\nin the in-group and view prescription against harming members of the\nout-group to be more like conventional norms (Rhodes and Chalik 2013).\nAccordingly, the fact that empathy shows considerable in-group bias,\nas discussed above, does not automatically count as evidence against\nit playing a role in allowing humans to distinguish between moral and\nconventional norms within a social context. \nOf central importance for assessing the role of empathy for grasping\nthe moral/conventional distinction has been the research on the nature\nof psychopathy and autism. Both pathologies are seen as involving\ndeficits in different dimensions of empathy but only psychopaths have\ngreat difficulties in living up to moral standards of their societies\nand only they were originally thought of as having difficulties in\nappropriately distinguishing between moral and conventional norms\n(Blair 1995 and 1996). More specifically, psychopaths show a selective\ndeficit in affective or emotional empathy particularly in\n“processing fearful, sad, and possibly disgusted facial\nexpressions”(Blair 2010, 710). In contrast to persons with\nautism they however do not show similar deficits in perspective taking\nor theory of mind capacities. In his 1995 article, Blair therefore\nblames the absence of what he calls the Violence Inhibition\nMechanism(VIM) that allows us to respond appropriately to the observed\ndistress cues in others for the psychopaths’ moral deficits and\ntheir inability to draw the moral/conventional distinction. In his\nlater work, he speaks more broadly of a dysfunction of our Integrated\nEmotion System (IES), caused by a deficit in the amygdala to properly\nrepresent negative emotions. (Blair, Mitchel, and Blair 2005, for a\nrecent survey regarding the very specific deficit of psychopaths in\nfeeling and recognizing fear see also Marsh 2014). Yet one has to\ntread very carefully in drawing definite conclusions about the role of\nempathy for morality from the empirical research about psychopathy.\nThe results of the empirical investigations are far from unified and\ndo not point in the same direction (For a concise survey see Maibom\n2017). Newer studies, for example, seem to suggest that psychopaths,\nas measured by the overall score of the revised psychopathy checklist\n(PCL–R), are able to understand the distinction between moral\nand conventional norms if tested under a forced choice paradigm\n(Aharoni et. al 2012.)Nevertheless even that study seems to allow for\nthe possibility that emotional deficits are responsible for the\npsychopath’s shortcomings in accurately drawing the distinction\nsince they are somewhat linked to the affective and antisocial facets\nof the PCL–R. Given the inconsistent results of the various\nstudies, other researchers prefer to view a psychopath’s\nimmorality not as a specific deficit in empathy, but understand it to\nbe caused by their general inability to feel strong emotions, by their\ngeneral coldheartedness, or even by shortcomings in their rational and\nprudential capacities. From that perspective, a psychopath might\nunderstand in an abstract manner that certain things are morally wrong\nto do, but he just does not care for morality, the welfare of another\nperson, or even for himself. (For further discussion see Maibom 2005\nand 2009, Nichols 2004, and Prinz 2011a,b). Similar considerations\napply also to research regarding subjects with autism. Kennett\n(2002)has argued that evidence from autistic individuals, whose\nimaginative role-play and thus empathic capacities are diminished,\ndoes not support the claim that empathy is necessary for moral agency.\nYet in her arguments she only considers the fact that persons with\nautism have difficulties with putting themselves in another\nperson’s shoes but does not consider that they seem to have some\nability to pick up on the emotional states of other people as revealed\nby their facial expressions. Moreover, while autistic subjects in\ngeneral can distinguish between moral and conventional norms they do\nseem to lack a certain flexibility in evaluating the seriousness of\nthe violation of a moral norm when they reflect on moral dilemmas or\nwhen they encounter an accidental or unintentional violation of such\nnorms. (See McGeer 2008, Zalla et. al 2011, but see also Kennett 2011\nand Leslie et. al. 2006 in response).  \nPhilosophers have however not been merely be interested in appealing\nto empathy for explicating the psychological basis for our thinking\nthat certain norms have moral status. Within the general framework of\nmoral sentimentalism, which sees morality generally linked to our\nemotional responsiveness to the actions of others and ourselves, they\nhave also appealed to empathy in explicating more generally the nature\nof moral judgments (see also Kauppinen 2014 and 2017a). David Hume,\nfor example, has suggested that moral judgments are based on peculiar\nsentiments of moral approbations and disapprobation, which are\ncausally mediated by our ability to empathize— or what he called\nsympathy— with the pain and pleasures of others (See also\nSayre-Mcord 1994 and 2014). More specifically, sentiments of moral\napprobations arise in response to our ability to think about and\nenliven the pleasure and pain that others feel with the help of our\nempathic/sympathetic capacities when we consider the benefits (the\npleasure and pain) which a person’s character traits and actions\nprovide to himself and others. Yet Hume was already quite aware of\nsome of the above mentioned limitations and biases of our natural\nwillingness and capacity to empathize with others. Accordingly, he\ninsisted that sentiments of approbations can only be conceived of as\nmoral approbation if empathy/sympathy is regulated or corrected by\nwhat he refers to as “steady and general points of view”\n(Hume 1739–40 [1978], 581/2) so that our capacity for sympathy enables us to\n“touch a string, to which all mankind have an accord and\nsymphony” (Hume 1748 [1983], 75). There are certainly a number of\nissues that can be raised in response to Hume’s proposal.\nSuffice it here to point out that it is difficult to fully understand\nhow Hume is ultimately able distinguish between judgments about\nsomething being bad and something being morally wrong. Certainly\nnatural disasters also cause us to sympathize/empathize with the pain\nit causes others, yet such sympathy is not mediating any judgments\nabout the moral impermissibility of natural disasters. Hume himself\nmight have thought to have solved this problem by thinking that\nsentiments of moral approbation have a peculiar or distinct character\n(see in this respect particularly Debes 2012). Yet pointing to the\npeculiarity of such sentiments seems to be rather unsatisfying for\nanswering this challenge.  \nMichael Slote, one of the main contemporary proponents of the claim\nthat empathy plays a constitutive role for moral judgments, does not\nfollow Hume in thinking that empathy plays a moral role in allowing us\nto pick up on a subject’s pleasure and pain. Rather Slote, who\nalso has been influenced by a feminist ethics of care (Slote 2007,\n2010), suggests that empathy is central for moral approval in that we\nas spectators empathically pick up on whether or not an agent acted\nout of empathic concern for another subject. Moral approval of an\naction consists then in the subsequent reflective feeling of warmth\nwhen empathizing with an agent’s empathic concern, while moral\ndisapproval is equivalent with a reflective feeling of chill due to\nour recognition that the agent acted without any empathic concern.\nActions are then judged to be morally right or wrong in terms of\nwhether they can be conceived of the actions of an agent we would\nmorally approve of in that they are actions done out of empathic\nconcern. Notice also that while Slote does regard empathy in the above\nsense to be constitutive of moral approval only if it is fully or\nwell–developed, he does not follow Hume in thinking that empathy\nneeds to be regulated in order to correct for some of its natural\npartiality. Indeed Slote thinks that this is a virtue of his account\nsince he regards such partiality reflected in our moral intuitions.\nFor example, he thinks that we have a greater moral obligation to help\nthe child in front of us or members of our family rather than people\nwho are more removed from us. Slote certainly deserves credit for\nreviving the debate about the role of empathy for morality in\ncontemporary metaethics. Yet his conception of the relation between\nempathy and morality has also encountered some skepticism. First of\nall, it is questionable that only motivations of empathic concern,\nrather than the thought that one is doing the right thing, constitute\nproper moral motivations. Second, in light of the above research on\nempathy’s bias and natural shortcomings, it is rather\nquestionable to maintain that all aspects of empathy’s\npartiality are sanctioned by our our moral intuitions. It is therefore\nhard to see how empathy’s moral role can be justified without\nappeal to some form of corrective mechanism. Third, phenomenologically\nspeaking, moral disapproval is not necessarily based on a\n“chilly” feeling. At times we are rather upset and angry\nin encountering violations of moral norms. Finally, Slote’s\nproposed empathic mechanism underlying moral approval seems to lack a\ncertain psychological plausibility. For Slote, we approve of an action\nbecause we recreate the empathic concern that the agent feels towards\nhis or her subjects and that causes us to feel warmly towards the\nagent. Yet if a positive moral judgment of an actions is tied to\nproviding us with the motivation or with a reason for doing a specific\naction, it is hard to see how moral approval, consisting in us feeling\nwarmly towards the agent, should help us accomplish this. If Slote is\nright, it would rather provide us with a reason for merely praising or\nbeing nice towards the agent (See D’Arms 2011, Kauppinen 2014\nand 2017a, Prinz 2001a,b, and Stueber 2011c). \nThere is one additional element to consider when debating\nempathy’s contribution to morality. Philosophers are not merely\ninterested in answering factual and causal questions of why we care\nabout morality, what causal role empathy plays in this respect, or how\nempathy causally contributes in allowing us to distinguish between\nmoral and conventional norms and judging what is morally right or\nwrong. Rather they are also interested in genuinely normative\nquestions in attempting to answer the question of why we should care\nabout morality and why we should regard moral judgments as making\nnormative demands on us. In morally blaming other persons we do assume\nthat we evaluate their behavior according to standards that they as\npersons are in some sense already committed to. We assume that these\nstandards are their own standards rather than standards that we impose\nfrom an external perspective on them. Unfortunately, even if one would\nagree with either David Hume or Michael’s Slote’s account\nof the causal role of empathy outlined above, it is doubtful that\ntheir account would help us to answer the genuinely normative question\nappropriately. Why exactly should I take a particular emotional\nreaction of another person towards me and my action, even if it is a\nfeeling of warmth caused by empathy, as something that is normatively\nrelevant for me. Certainly we all like to be liked and try to fit in\nwith our peer group, but then moral judgments would be nothing more\nthan a glorified form of peer pressure. Hume might respond that we\nshould take them seriously because they are responses from the general\npoint of view, but that in itself seems to be begging the question of\nwhy such perspective is articulating the appropriate normative\nstandard for judging our behavior and character. This is also exactly\nthe reason, why philosophers with Kantian inclinations have been in\ngeneral skeptical about moral sentimentalism and positions that think\nof empathy as a foundation of morality (for a nice explication of\nKant’s critical view of sympathy see Deimling 2017).\nContemporary “Kantians” do at times, however, admit that\nempathy and perspective taking is epistemically relevant for moral\ndeliberations, even if it is not solely constitutive for moral agency\n(Deigh 1996 and 2018; Darwall 2006, Shermann 1998, For a review see\nalso Oxley 2011). Interestingly, philosophers sympathetic to moral\nsentimentalism have particularly turned to Adam Smith for inspiration\nin developing empathy based accounts of morality and in responding to\nthe above normativity problem. In contrast to Hume, Smith conceives of\nempathy/sympathy not merely as the enlivening of a perceived emotion\nor feeeling but as imaginative perspective–taking. In taking up\nanother person’s perspective we put ourselves in his situation\nand imagine how he would respond to the situation, how he would think\nand feel about it. If in bringing another person’s point of view\n“home to ourselves” in this manner, we recognize that we\nourselves might have felt or acted like the other person, then we\napprove of the other person’s sentiment or action, otherwise we\ndisapprove. Moreover, such approval constitutes moral approval if we\nhave empathized with the other from the perspective of the impartial\nspectator, a perspective that Smith, like Hume, appeals to in order to\ncorrect for empathy’s natural shortcomings. More importantly,\nsome authors think that within the Smithian framework we also find\nsome answers to the normativity problem. They think that the impartial\nspectator perspective can be recast as an implicit commitment of our\nordinary practice of making sense of each other as rational and\nemotional creatures with the help of empathic perspective taking\n(Stueber 2017) or argue that Smithian perspective–taking\ninvolves quasi-Kantian commitments to the dignity of a person,\nincluding his or her affective dimension. (Debes 2017, but see also\nFricke 2005, Kauppinen 2017b, and Roughley 2018). ","contact.mail":"kstueber@holycross.edu","contact.domain":"holycross.edu"}]
