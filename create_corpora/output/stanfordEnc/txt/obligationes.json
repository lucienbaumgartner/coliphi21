Although their name might suggest they had something\nespecially to do with ethics or moral duty, they did not. The purpose\nof these disputations was strictly logical. Several kinds of\ndisputations de obligationibus were distinguished in the\nmedieval literature. The most widely studied kind to date was called\n“positio” (= positing). It is difficult or even\nimpossible to map the genre to the genres of modern logic, but issues\ninvolved include at least counterfactual and per impossibile\nreasoning, and dynamic commitment to remain logically consistent.\nDisputations de obligationibus appear to lay at the\nbackground of the modern practice of the academic “thesis\ndefense.”\n\nAristotle’s logical works, especially Topics, assume a\ndisputational setting as a primary context for logical inference. In a\nmanner closely similar to Socratic questioning procedures in Plato’s\ndialogues, the disputations Aristotle had in mind have two\nparticipants, and possibly an audience to serve as a judge between the\nparticipants. The opponent (questioner) leads the disputation through\nputting forward propositions which the respondent (answerer) typically\neither grants or denies.  \nThe disputation as described by Aristotle in Topics\nconcentrates on some thesis taken as a starting point. The opponent’s\ninternal aim in the disputation is to build against the thesis an\nargument through propositions granted by the respondent, and perhaps\nopposites of those denied. If the opponent successfully achieves this\naim, the respondent will have to grant the opposite of the discussed\nthesis because of the inferential force of the propositions granted\nduring the disputation. The disputation thus becomes a refutation of\nthe thesis, or its own starting point.  \nAs already Aristotle recognized in Topics, finding out\nwhether a certain thesis is true is not the only purpose for such\ndisputations. The opponent and the respondent may well decide to\nundertake a disputation on a thesis that is already at the beginning\nknown to be false or even impossible. It is this kind of disputation\nthat is at issue in the treatises on obligationes.\nDisputations de obligationibus were not about finding out the\nfacts of any matter.  \nThe medieval disputations de obligationibus regulate the\nPlatonic-Aristotelian structure further through considering situations\nwhere the respondent admits some specified disputational duty\n(obligatio) to be followed during the technical disputation.\nFrom at least the early thirteenth century onwards, independent\ntreatises as well as discussions as parts of larger works are\ndedicated on how to conduct disputations de\n obligationibus.[1]\n This literature was regarded as belonging to logic, and the study of\nobligationes became part of the logic curriculum followed by\n undergraduates.[2] \nThe usual title “obligationes” means obligations in the\nnormative sense of duties. The treatises prescribe explicitly what the\nrespondent (and to some extent what the opponent) may and may not do\nin such a disputation. Treatises on obligationes are thus not\nworks in deontic\n logic.[3]\n What is “obligatory” is strictly limited to the general\nlogical obligation not to contradict oneself in a disputation and to\nsome specific logical obligation that the opponent gives to the\nrespondent in the beginning of the disputation. Even the general moral\nduty to be honest and grant to one’s opponent what one believes to be\ntrue is limited to a very marginal role in these highly technical\ndisputations.  \nThe most important background assumption of obligational disputations\nis the conditional obligation that if one grants the premises of a\nlogically valid inference, one has to grant the conclusion as well.\nTreatises on obligationes studied how this duty is to be\napplied in a context where the premises are not granted for the sole\nreason of granting what is true, but for some other duty, for example,\nan imposed duty to grant a premise known to be false or even\nimpossible, just for the sake of examining the logical relations\nbetween certain chosen propositions.  \nThere were several kinds or “species” of\nobligationes. Accepting a false or impossible proposition as\nsomething that has to be granted (or “positing”) was the\nmost commonly discussed. But the early Obligationes\nParisienses, for example, distinguishes six kinds; the same six\nare found also in Walter Burley and William of Ockham: positing\n(positio), counterpositing (depositio), “let\nit be doubted” (dubitetur), institution\n(institutio), the truth of the matter (rei veritas),\nand petition\n (petitio).[9]\n Apart from “positing,” most of these kinds of\nobligationes have been little studied in the modern\nliterature.  \nSome late-medieval authors claimed that the theoretical basis for\nobligationes came from two passages in Aristotle (Prior\nAnalytics I.13.32a18–20, Metaphysics\nIX.4.1047b10–12), both of which say merely that when something\npossible is posited, nothing impossible\n results.[4]\n These Aristotelian texts are relevant, but not crucial for the\nhistorical origins of the obligationes literature. The first\ntreatises on obligationes are earlier than the ready\navailability of the Metaphysics in Latin translation, and do\nnot mention either passage. Moreover, while it is certainly true that\nobligational disputations never require an impossibility to follow\nwhen a possibility is posited, that fact does not by itself account\nfor some of the most characteristic features of obligationes.\nIndeed, some of the earliest discussions concern what happens not when\na possibility is posited, but when an impossibility is\nposited.\n [5] \nIt is precisely this feature, in fact, that at least two early\ntreatises attribute to\n Aristotle[6]: \n And[7]: \nIt seems thus more probable to connect obligational disputations to\nAristotle’s per impossibile arguments, which had been\ndiscussed by at least Boethius and Ibn\n Rushd.[8] \nThe most widely discussed kind of obligatio, both in the\nmedieval literature and in recent scholarship, is no doubt\npositio or “positing.” In a positio the\n“opponent” begins by saying “I posit that\np.” The proposition p is called the\n“positum.” The “respondent” then says\neither “I admit it” or “I deny it,” depending\non certain conditions. For example, the treatises by Roger Swyneshed,\nRobert Eland, and Richard Lavenham all stipulate that in order for the\npositum to be “admissible,” it must be a\ncontingent\n proposition.[10]\n Other authors, as we have seen above, allow the positum to\nbe an impossible proposition, provided that its impossibility is not\n“manifest,” so that the proposition can be entertained and\n believed.[11]\n We shall not consider such cases here. \nIf the positio is admitted, the disputation is under way: The\nopponent then “proposes” to the respondent a series of\npropositions, one after another. Admitting a positio is not\nthe same thing as conceding a proposition. By admitting a\npositio the respondent accepts to having the duty to concede\nthe positum if it is put forward as a propositum,\nand any other duties deriving from this duty. In practice this means\nthat the respondent must evaluate each proposition, or\npropositum put forward by the opponent with recognition of\nthe duty accepted by admitting the positio. To each\npropositum put forward by the opponent the respondent must\nreply by saying “I concede it,” “I deny it,”\nor “I doubt it,”. The correct response is guided by rules\ngiven in the treatises, and different authors give somewhat different\nrules. Below we discuss the two most important approaches to the\nrules, called “the old response” and “the new response” by Eland. They\ncan be identified as the rules given by Walter Burley and Roger\nSwyneshed.\n [12] \nAccording to both of these sets of rules, the correct response depends\nin part on whether the propositum is “relevant”\nor “irrelevant” (pertinens/impertinens), and if\nit is relevant whether it is “sequentially relevant” or\n“incompatibly relevant” (pertinens sequens/pertinens\nrepugnans). The specification of these notions and of how they\naffect the correct response to the propositum constitutes the\nkernel of the theory of positio, and varied from author to\nauthor. \nGiven the variance in the ways different authors give the rules, it\nmay appear that the rules are stipulated, and the disputation appears\nlike a game. On this reading, the participant would have to agree at\nthe beginning which set of rules are followed in the incipient\ndisputation.  \nWalter Burley’s account represents what was perhaps the\n“default” or “standard”\n theory.[13]\n According to\n him[14]: \nThe disputation continues until the opponent says “Cedat\ntempus,” which can either mean “Time is up!”\n(the disputation is over) or “Time out!” In the latter\ncase the disputation is interrupted temporarily while the opponent\npoints out some mistake in the respondent’s replies or makes some\nother observation. In both senses, the point is the same: the\nrespondent is not “obligated” by the rules of\npositio except when the “game clock” is running.\nIt is a standard feature of obligations treatises that they\ndistinguish (1) the propositions put forward, (2) their evaluation in\nthe obligational disputation, and (3) a meta-level discussion of\neither the propositions (eg. of their truth values) or their\nintra-disputation\n evaluations.[15] \nAn example will help clarify the rules. \nSeveral peculiar things should be noted about these rules. First, the\nburden of the rules falls almost entirely on the respondent. As long\nas he picks an “admissible” positum to begin\nwith, the opponent is otherwise free to propose anything he pleases at\nany step of the disputation. \nSecond, note the role of the respondent’s epistemic state. It is a\nfactor in determining the correct replies, but only when the\npropositum is irrelevant. \nThird, note that order counts. That is, depending on the\norder in which proposita are proposed, different replies to\nthem may be required. Thus if steps 1 and 2 were reversed in the above\nexample, both would have to be denied: \nThis set of rules guarantees that positio is\n“consistent” in each of the following three, progressively\nstronger\n senses[16]: \nYet on Burley’s theory positio fails to be\n“consistent” in another\n sense[18]: \nAs an example of this failure, let p and q be\ncontingent propositions neither of which logically implies the other,\nand let the respondent know that q is false whereas he does\nnot know the truth value of p. Then: \nClearly, positio on Burley’s theory is a very peculiar kind\nof disputation. \nBurley’s theory of positio was not the only one. Another\naccount seems to have originated with a certain Roger Swyneshed, who\nwrote an Obligationes probably sometime after 1330 and\ncertainly before 1335 (Spade [1977]). This alternative theory was\nrecognized by Robert Eland, a mid-fourteenth century author about whom\nvery little is known. Eland reports both Burley’s theory and\nSwyneshed’s theory, calling them the “old response” and\nthe “new response,” respectively. He does not choose\nbetween them, but simply tells the respondent to pick whichever one he\nlikes (Spade [1980], §20). Richard Lavenham, on the other hand, a\nlater-fourteenth century author contemporary with John Wyclif, accepts\nSwyneshed’s version of positio outright. A certain John of\nWesel from mid-fourteenth century Paris also shows knowledge of\nSwyneshed’s views (John of Wesel [1996]). Nevertheless, Swyneshed’s\nviews seem to have generated some controversy. For instance, Ralph\nStrode, in the later-fourteenth century (roughly contemporary with\nJohn Wyclif), heatedly rejected features of Swyneshed’s theory, as did\nPeter of Candia and the Logica magna attributed to Paul of\nVenice (Spade [1982a], pp. 337–39). \nSwyneshed’s theory of positio is in many respects like\nBurley’s, but differs in one major respect. For Swyneshed, in\nassessing whether a propositum is relevant or irrelevant, the\nresponses to previous proposita do not matter. That is, for\nhim, a propositum is “sequentially relevant” if\nand only if it logically follows from the positum alone; it\nis “incompatibly relevant” if and only if its\ncontradictory opposite follows from the positum alone; it is\n“irrelevant” if and only if it is neither sequentially nor\nincompatibly relevant. \nSwyneshed’s “new response” greatly simplifies the task of\nthe respondent. He no longer has to keep track of what has previously\nbeen conceded or denied in the disputation. The order in which\nproposita are proposed no longer matters. All the respondent\nhas to do is to make sure he responds appropriately whenever the\npropositum either follows from or is inconsistent with the\npositum alone, and otherwise just respond according to his\nknowledge of the actual facts. As long as he does that, he has\nperformed correctly. \nUnlike Burley’s theory, Swyneshed’s guarantees that positio\nis consistent in\n sense 4\n above.[19] On the other hand, while for Swyneshed\npositio is consistent in\n sense 1\n and\n sense 2\n above, it fails to be consistent in\n sense 3.[20]\n For example, suppose you know you are sitting somewhere in Oxford,\nand then consider the following positio (Spade [1977],\n§100): \nThe proposita in steps 1–3 form an inconsistent triad,\nand yet each of them has to be conceded in accordance with Swyneshed’s\nrules. Indeed, Swyneshed is clear that all members of inconsistent\ntriads may sometimes be conceded. \nBurley’s and Swyneshed’s were not the only theories of\npositio, although they seem to have been the most widely\ndiscussed. Other theories were suggested too, but they are not yet\nthoroughly studied or\n understood.[21] \nWhat was the purpose of positio? The question is not an easy\n one.[22]\n For, oddly, although medieval authors themselves speak of\npositio as a kind of “disputation,” there seems\nat first to be nothing really in dispute! Look back at the preceding\nexamples. They do not settle, or even try to settle, anything whatever\nabout the capital of Pennsylvania, the location of the Mason-Dixon\nLine, whether you are sitting or running in Rome or in Oxford, or\nanything else. Unlike the medieval quaestio format, where\nthere was a real issue being pursued and a real conflict of opposing\nviews, there seems to be nothing like that going on in a\npositio. What then was its purpose? \nSome scholars have suggested that these disputations were meant as\n“exercises” or perhaps “examinations” of\nstudents’ skills. But skills at doing what? We have just seen that it\nwould not be their purely logical skills that would be exercised or\nexamined. What other skills were they? Skills at arguing according to\nthe rules of obligatio? No doubt, but without some further\nexplanation, why would anyone want to do that? \nOne suggestion is that positio might be viewed as something\nlike a theory of counterfactual\n reasoning.[23]\n On this account, a positio would explore “what would\nhappen” if the positum were true but everything else\nstayed as much as possible the same as it really is. This suggestion\nprovides some rationale for the otherwise mysterious treatment of\nirrelevant proposita, where one looks away from the posited\nsituation back to reality to guide one’s responses. In similar\nfashion, where a counterfactual hypothesis does not require otherwise,\ncounterfactual reasoning typically tries to stay as close as possible\nto reality. \nFurthermore, theories of positio bear striking formal\nsimilarities to modern theories of counterfactuals. Transitivity,\ncontraposition and strengthening the antecedent all fail, and several\nother characteristics of counterfactuals seem to be mirrored in the\ntheory of\n positio.[24] \nThis suggestion has met considerable resistance (Stump [1981] and\n[1985], Martin [1993]). One objection is that, at least on Burley’s\n“standard” theory of positio, if a\npositum is possible but nevertheless known to be false, the\nopponent can maneuver the respondent into having to concede\nany proposition whatever consistent with the\npositum. Let p be such a positum, and let\nq be consistent with p. Then: \nThis is a very bad result if positio is a form of\ncounterfactual reasoning. For it means that, starting from any known\nfalsehood, one could reason counterfactually to anything\nwhatever consistent with\n it.[25] \nAnother objection might be that counterfactual reasoning, at least as\nwe are thinking of it today, does not incorporate epistemic factors in\nthe way the theory of positio does. It is one thing to say\nthat we do not know what would happen under a given counterfactual\nhypothesis; it is quite another thing to say, as the\n“counterfactual”-interpretation has it that the theory of\nobligationes does say, that what would happen depends in part\non what we do know in fact. \nIn more recent research (e.g. Yrjönsuuri [2009]; Catarina Dutilh\nNovaes [2011]), scholars have thought that unlike twentieth century\ntheories of counterfactual reasoning, obligationes are\ncharacteristically dynamic and dialectical. The core of the art is\nthat the respondent must use logical skills to keep the general\ncommitment to consistency. A particular bend to the art comes from the\nfact that at least in the late medieval context there was no clear\nuniversally accepted definition what it means to keep consistent in a\ndynamic situation. There was, from the viewpoint of this\ninterpretation, agreement that the consistency at issue in\nobligationes is connected to inferential validity. In the\nearly Obligationes Parisienses the art is explicitly\nconnected to “knowledge of consequences” (scientia de\nconsequentiis). Even more generally, it is clear that the kinds\nof inferences employed in obligationes are in most cases\nstrictly logical. \nIt is notable that in early thirteenth century logic, when\nobligational disputations started to be discussed, the concept of\nconsistency of a set of propositions was not a standard part of\nlogical toolboxes. It was only towards the latter half of the\nthirteenth century that logicians started to use the concept\ncompossibilitas to designate how a set of propositions could\nall be true together, and John Duns Scotus even introduced the concept\nof “logical possibility” (possibilitas logica).  \nTo the modern reader, obligational disputations may appear to be\nstudying consistency maintenance. However, it seems historically more\naccurate to say that they were practiced for some other reasons, but\nthen proved to be an interesting platform to study what it logically\nmeans to have a consistent set of propositions. In this way, they\ncontributed significantly to the development of the concept of\nlogical consistency. That is, obligational disputations turned from a\nmarginal interest into an important vehicle for the development of\nformal logic, to which the best logicians of the fourteenth century\nwould pay ample attention. \nAnother suggestion is that positio might lie at the\nbackground of the modern academic practice of the “thesis\ndefense.” ‘Positio’, after all, is just\nLatin for the Greek ‘thesis’. Furthermore, to\nthis day, the characteristic terminology of “opponent” and\n“respondent” is preserved in some European academic\nthesis-defenses. Moreover, despite our earlier sense that there is,\noddly, nothing really “in dispute” in a positio,\nit is relatively easy to find medieval discussions—not\nin treatises or other passages devoted specifically to the theory of\nobligationes, but in other texts—where the\ncharacteristic vocabulary and procedures of positio are\nappealed to in a context where some substantive view is being\n argued.[26]\n That view, however, is not to be found in the positum or in\nany of the subsequent proposed steps of the positio. It is\nrather a view that the respondent takes himself to know (and\nso is prepared to “defend”), and that will therefore\naffect the responses he gives to irrelevant proposita. The\nview being “defended,” therefore, is not a view explicitly\nstated anywhere in the disputation, but a kind of background\nassumption that underlies the respondent’s replies. This suggestion\nhas some promise, but has not yet been thoroughly explored. One\nobjection might be that, despite the initial attractiveness of the\nfact that Latin ‘positio’ is the same as Greek\n‘thesis,’ this view ends up divorcing the\n“thesis” being defended by the respondent from the\npositum in the disputation. \nThe jury is still out. It must be admitted that no one has yet\nexplained positio, much less the\nobligationes-literature in general, in a fully satisfactory\nway. An adequate account would have to accommodate \nIt may be that any adequate account would in effect reproduce the\ngenre with the terminology of modern logic. That is, perhaps\nobligationes are best understood as a logical genre of its\nown kind. \nIn the most recent studies of obligational disputations the interest\nto map this medieval genre to categories of modern logic has\nunderstandably waned. Instead, interest has turned to how specific\nlogical issues come up in the context of obligational\ndisputations. \nApart from positio, the other kinds of obligatio\nrecognized in the medieval literature have not been studied nearly so\nmuch. One kind that perhaps needs little separate study is\n“counterpositing” (depositio). In effect, if\n“positing” requires the respondent to uphold the\npositum as true (by conceding what follows from it, etc.),\n“counterpositing” requires the respondent to uphold the\ndepositum as false (by denying what implies it, etc.). In\nother respects, counterpositing seems, mutatis mutandis, to\nbe a trivial variation on\n positing.[27]\n This itself raises an interpretive problem: why treat counterpositing\nas a separate kind of obligatio at all? \nAnother kind that that probably needs only cursory recognition is\n“doubting.” Doubting (dubitatio), like\ncounterpositing, is a variation on positing. In this case, the\nrespondent is required to uphold the dubitatum as doubtful.\n(Recall the role of doubtful irrelevant proposita in a\npositio.) Again, while the complications can get confusing in\npractice, theoretically this seems a trivial variation on positing.\nOne wonders again why some authors singled it out as a separate kind\nof\n obligatio.[28] \nA few words should be said about other kinds of obligatio.\nEven apart from the context of obligationes,\n“institution” (or “imposition”) was regarded\nas the assigning of meaning to expressions of language. Within the\ncontext of obligationes, the issue seems to have revolved\naround how institution or imposition affected the correct responses in\nan obligational disputation. Suppose we call a tail a leg (that is,\n“impose” the word ‘leg’ to include tails). How\nmany legs does a lion have? Should we say five, on the grounds that we\nare calling tails legs? Or should we continue to say four, on the\ngrounds that our replies are to be given according to the meanings\nwords actually have, quite apart from whatever meanings they\nmight (counterfactually) be assumed to have in the context of a\ndisputation? (See Spade [1982a], pp. 339–40.) \n“Petition” (petitio) has been completely ignored\nin the recent literature, and little can be said that is informative\nabout it. Somewhat more has been said about “the truth of the\nmatter” (rei veritas), but not much (Spade\n[1994–1997]). \nThe vocabulary of medieval obligationes-literature\n(“positing,” “conceding,”\n“admitting,” “relevance/irrelevance”) appears\nubiquitously in late medieval scholastic writings. If not otherwise,\nfor this reason there is need for more study of the literature and its\nrole in medieval logic.","contact.mail":"mikko.yrjonsuuri@jyu.fi","contact.domain":"jyu.fi"}]
