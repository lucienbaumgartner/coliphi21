Latin American feminism focuses on\nthe critical work that women have undertaken in reaction to the forces\nthat created this context. At present, the context is dominated by\nneoliberal economic policies that, in the environment of globalization,\nhave disproportionally impacted the most vulnerable segments of\nsociety. Against this political backdrop, Latin American feminism is\ngrounded in the material lives of people, often women, as it explores\nthe tensions engendered by the confluence of histories that generate\nrelationships among gender, citizenship, race/ethnicity, sexuality,\nclass, community, and religion.\n\n\n\nLatin American feminism broadly encompasses multiple positions, many\nof which are in tension with each other. As a result, many refer to\nLatin American “feminisms” in the plural. The diversity of\nfeminisms is owed to the various regions and their histories which\ndemanded social, cultural, governmental, and organizational\ntransformations in their own capacities. Hence, the present discussion\nof the general concept of Latin American feminism methodologically\nnecessitates historical sensitivity to apprehend the intimate\nrelationship between the development of different ideas and the\nheterogeneous political conditions that give rise to them.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, tracing the history of Latin American feminism\nand its ideas is an urgent task. While growing interest in the broader\nLatin American philosophy calls for increased textual representation\nand access, the role that women have played in the evolution of Latin\nAmerican philosophical ideas has been largely neglected. Yet, there\nexists a wealth of critical feminist ideas for theories of identity,\npolitics, and culture.\n\nMost historical genealogies of Latin American feminism trace their\norigins to the social movements beginning in the 1960s and 1970s\ncentered around women’s liberation. However, feminist ideas in\nLatin America are much older than those which have been documented as\npart of feminist political action. The origins of Latin American\nfeminist ideas can be found in reflections on conditions of otherness\nthat emerge as a result of colonialism and in critiques of norms that\nrender the category of man the entry point for humanity. By the 60s and\n70s, feminism in Latin America had a firmly rooted history concerned\nwith articulating difference and alterity from a non-dominant\nperspective (Gargallo 2004: 80). \n\nThere are lacunas in Latin American feminist genealogy as the\nwritings of non-white women from the 19th and early\n20th centuries (and earlier) are seldom found in written\nform, given that many non-white women were illiterate, and their\nstories were not textually documented. Their ideas and histories were\norally transmitted, and current local oral traditions account for them\n(Gargallo 2010: 12a). For instance, the colonial resistance of\nBaraúnda, wife of Garifuna leader Satuyé, is legendary\nfor her people; her memory travels in songs sung by Garifuna women of\nHonduras and Belize. Similarly, the story of Anacaona, Taino chief\n(cacica) of Jaragua Hispañola, is one of colonial\nresistance; prior to her execution she was offered clemency in return\nfor becoming a concubine for a Spaniard, and her refusal and subsequent\ndeath solidified her legendary status which is immortalized in songs\nfrom Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. The stories of\nIndigenous women of these times continue to be shared orally through\nmyth, songs, and proverbs, and contribute to the foundations of Latin\nAmerican feminist thought (Gargallo 2010: 14a). \n\nOne of the earliest documented writers in the Latin American\nfeminist tradition comes from the 17th century. Arguing in\nfavor of the educational and intellectual rights of women, Juana\nInés María del Carmen Martínez de Zaragoza Gaxiola\nde Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana Odonojú\n(1651–1695), recognized by many as Juana Inés de la Cruz\nor Sor Juana of Mexico, was a self-educated scholar of the Baroque\nperiod whose writings have garnered quite a bit of philosophical\nattention as part of the Latin American philosophical canon. She was\nwell known during her lifetime as evidenced by multiple publications of\nher work. However, by the second half of the 18th century,\nher fame diminished as attention to Baroque poetry declined. In 1951,\nher work recovered attention with the publication of her complete works\n(Gargallo 2009: 419). \n\nJuana Inés de la Cruz was one among many feminist writers who\nadvocated for social and cultural changes, including the role of women.\nTeresa Margarida da Silva e Orta of Brazil (1711–1793) was the\nfirst woman in the Portuguese-speaking world to publish a novel and the\nfirst Brazilian-born person to edit a book in Europe. She advocated for\nthe autonomy of the Indigenous and the rights of women in science\n(Gargallo 2004: 80). Flora Tristán of Perú\n(1803–1844) argued for women’s equality and its important\nrelationship to workers’ rights (Gargallo 2004: 80). Argentinian\nabolitionist Juana Manso (1819–1875) detailed education and\nphilosophical instruction as a route to the moral and intellectual\nemancipation of women. This position was taken up at the end of the\ncentury by figures like Rita Cetina Gutiérrez of Mexico\n(1846–1908) and Visitación Padilla of Honduras\n(1882–1960) (Gargallo 2009: 418). Cetina Gutiérrez founded\nLa Siempreviva in Mérida, Mexico’s first secular school\nfor poor girls and an art college for young women. She is cited as one\nof Mexico’s first feminists who promoted secular education of\nwomen and fought for their self-determination. Padilla founded the\nSociedad Cultural Feminina, which promoted access to education,\nespecially for women. \n\nThe existence of early Latin American feminist ideas was not\nattended to until years after their inception. The impact of ideas\ncentering on women’s rights to intellectual and educational life,\nequality, and workers’ rights was not immediate since they were\nnot given importance in their respective contexts. During the feminist\nmovements of the 20th century, many of these figures\nre-emerged as part of a Latin American feminist theoretical landscape\n(Gargallo 2004: 81). Early Latin American feminist ideas came to be\nevaluated through historical memory that gives weight to the claim that\nLatin American feminist ideas existed prior to the women’s\nmovements of the 1960s and 1970s. \n\nFeminist ideas from the early 20th century are\ntransnational. Ideas move with pushes for social change. Hence, a key\nissue for contemporary Latin American feminist writers is the\nimportance of tracking the movement of ideas and reminding us that\nideas migrate and reconfigure depending on their contexts. The\nintersection between women’s ideas about resistance and the ideas\nthat could lead to social transformation was not necessarily understood\nas feminist in its time. More often than not, women’s ideas in\nregards to justice, equality, and political change converged with other\npolitical projects that focused on improving the poor working\nclass’s conditions and not specifically women’s conditions.\nTheir ideas for social change were molded into general claims about\naccess to education and transformation of laboring material conditions.\nIdeas that are now coded as feminist are identified as such in\nretrospect, but in order to do them justice, they need to be accounted\nfor in their historicity. \n\nThe Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) had a profound impact on\nthe development of feminist ideas (Gargallo 2004: 82). Most notably,\nthe revolution focused on education, and in this political landscape,\nfeminist ideas had the historical impact of influencing the thoughts\nand actions of women in Mexican society (Gargallo 2004: 82). In 1915,\nSalvador Alvarado became governor of the Yucatán and functioned\nas a vehicle for social and political change until 1918 when he was\ncalled to return to military duty. He supported a feminist movement in\nthe region initiated by Rita Cetina Gutiérrez in 1870, noted\nearlier as one of Mexico’s earliest feminists and founder of La\nSiempreviva. Moreover, his tenure in office gave room and support for\nwomen’s political activism in the region. The first two feminist\ncongresses in the history of Mexico were held in Mérida in\nJanuary and November of 1916, giving floor to discussions on the right\nto vote and political participation, abortion and contraception, as\nwell as education (Gargallo 2004: 83). By 1923, the socialist party of\nthe Yucatán had three women deputies and one alternate (Gargallo\n2004: 84). \n\nGiven the impact of the Mexican Revolution, it is no surprise that\nsome of the first feminist ideas to reach historical identification are\nfound in its wake. Nevertheless, feminist ideas stretched beyond Mexico\nand across Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1880, women\nabolitionists in Brazil published a newspaper titled A familia\nand argued for changes in dress norms. In 1910, Argentina witnessed the\nfirst Feminist International Congress which fought for peace,\neducation, and social participation (Gargallo 2004: 85). In 1912, women\nin Colombia declared the defense of civil rights of married women. In\n1916, women in Panamá founded Club Ariel and Centro de Cultural\nFeminina, which supported intellectual and physical education as well\nas the political life of women, and whose motto centered on virtue and\nnationhood. In 1924, Visitación Padilla denounced the presence\nof U.S. marine military infantry in Honduras and Central America in the\nBoletín de la Defensa Nacional. She founded the\nCírculo de Cultura Femenina which supported the education of\nwomen and resisted North American military intervention during the\nSecond Honduran Civil War (1924). In 1928, women of Ecuador sued the\nstate, demanding the right to vote, and received it one year later\n(Gargallo 2004: 86). \n\nLuisa Capetillo (1879–1922) exemplifies the convergence of\nfeminist ideas and ideas concerning broader social transformation. Born\nin Arecibo, Puerto Rico, Capetillo was home schooled and secured a job\nas a reader in cigar-making factories, reading to workers and\ntransferring ideas to workers as they rolled cigars. Capetillo’s\nemployment as a reader served as an important locale from which workers\ndeveloped a consciousness of trade unions, socialism, anarchism, and\nwomen’s rights (Ruiz 2016: 6). Although readers were typically\nmen, it was not uncommon to find women in cigar factories as the\ncigar-making industry modernized and became the second national\nindustry in the first decades of the 20th century (Ramos\n1992: 29). Hence, it is not accidental that some of the first feminist\nideas of Puerto Rico emerged in cigar factories and in the proletariat\npresses significantly before the suffrage movement later in the century\n(Ramos 1992: 30). Capetillo’s feminist ideas are grounded in her\nclass politics that saw emancipation occurring at the nexus between\nlabor empowerment and gender equality (Ruiz 2016: 13). Although often\nheralded as the first feminist writer of Puerto Rico and the first\nwoman to ever publish a book about women in Puerto Rico,\nCapetillo’s work most importantly shows how early 20th\ncentury Latin American feminist ideas and writers were very much\ngrounded in the lived material conditions of their times. In the case\nof Capetillo, her feminist anarchism brewed at the core of her\nunderstanding of workers’ emancipation as a woman who herself\nlabored in the trenches of modernity. \n\nEarly 20th century Latin American feminist history\nconcludes with women’s suffrage. The years spanning\n1870–1947 are generally considered the pivotal years for\nwomen’s suffrage (Gargallo 2004: 94). However, to view this slice\nof history as merely centered on suffrage misrepresents the\nmultiplicity of feminist ideas and activities developed during the\ntime. These years also witnessed the push for social transformation\noriented around ideas of equality and justice that included, but was\nnot limited to, the right to vote. The push for equality framed\nwomen’s insistence on public access to education, which impacted\nnot just women but the impoverished as well. The call for a more just\nsocial order framed how women were thinking about their locale in\nresistance to military intervention as well as labor movements. Hence,\nthe ideas that emanate from this period are multidimensional. The era\nis identified as closing out with the accomplishment of suffrage.\nHowever, the right to vote emerged at different times throughout the\nregion, owing to the diversity of local politics. For instance, Ecuador\nwas the first country in South America to enfranchise women in 1929.\nThat same year, Puerto Rico enfranchised literate women and in 1935,\ngave the vote to all women. Uruguay followed shortly after in 1932,\nCuba in 1933, and El Salvador in 1939. However, the suffrage movement\nstagnated in other countries: women were enfranchised in Nicaragua and\nPerú in 1955, and only in 1961 did Paraguay give women the\nvote. \n\nCoined by Julieta Kirkwood of Chile as the “years of\nsilence”, the years spanning from 1950–1970s/1980s saw\nwomen (mostly middle-class) increasing their political presence by\nparticipating in popular social movements and political parties\n(Kirkwood 1986: 70). However, their social and political participation\nlacked explicit feminist demands. Although not a strict set of dates,\nthe years of silence lasted well into the 1980s for some parts of Latin\nAmerica (e.g., Chile); these years, the time of baby boom and populism,\nwere politically rife in post-World War II Latin America. It was also a\ntime characterized by McCarthyism which precipitated the U.S.\nintervention in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic with intentions of\nwarding off communism (Gargallo 2004: 94). These years also witnessed\nthe fall of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1956 as well the\nrise of conflict and military regimes in countries like Colombia,\nArgentina, and Chile. Hence, political mobilization took place around\nthe changing landscape of Latin America, and middle-class women\nparticipated, but their explicit role in these movements is complicated\nby the fact that their presence and impact were not readily documented\n(Ungo Montenegro 2000: 45). Notwithstanding, the years of silence were\nnot quiet on pages. Women during these years were literarily active and\nproduced texts that privileged their position which was theoretically\nunderappreciated because of their literary style (Gargallo 2004:\n95). \n\nThe relationship between literature and philosophy has been explored\nas part of the Latin American philosophical tradition. For instance,\none position holds that the Latin American literary tradition of essay\nwriting contains insights that can ameliorate the troubles of Latin\nAmerican philosophy at large (Pereda 2006: 196). Nevertheless, the\npoints of literary departure for many Latin American philosophers are\nseldom women, although Latin American women in the middle of the\n20th century wrote amply about their identities in\nrelationship to gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality (Gargallo\n2004: 97). It is important to appreciate that not all women’s\nwriting during this time pushed for social change. Some narratives\nplayed into patriarchy and machismo, forced marriage, and\nsocial isolation. At the same time, some women presented narratives\nthat exposed doubts and resistances to the patriarchal ordering of the\nworld (Gargallo 2004: 97). Unfortunately, women writers of this time\nare often folded into literary traditions, hindering their recognition\nas thinkers and theorists. One notable example is Rosario Castellanos\nof Mexico. \n\nIn 1950, at the age of 25, Castellanos defended her master’s\nthesis in philosophy at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de\nMéxico (UNAM). The project, titled Sobre cultura\nfeminina, explored women’s role in the production of culture\n(Gargallo 2004: 89). She was a prolific writer. However, Castellanos is\nlargely remembered as a literary figure and a poet. It was not until\n1974 (after her death), that the publication of her most famous work\nEl Eterno Feminino was recognized as theoretically rich,\nspeaking on themes of gender, ethnicity, and nationhood. Today, she is\nrecognized as a leading voice in the feminist movement of Mexico, her\nwork arguing for the construction of a feminine subjectivity that\ndefies the identity imposed by patriarchal cultural norms. As a result,\nher work has aided in establishing a different vision of political life\nfor women in Mexico (Gargallo 2004: 90). \n\nThe 1950s–1970s was a fervent time of women’s writing\nacross Latin America. Antonia Palacios of Venezuela wrote Ana\nIsabel, una niña decente (1949), Castellanos of Mexico\nwrote Balún-Canán (1957), and Albalucía\nÁngel of Colombia wrote Estaba la pájara pinta\nsentada un verde limón (1975). Further notable examples\ninclude the Mexican poet Enriqueta Ochoa whose published works span\n1947–2008 and Marvel Moreno, one of the most influential female\nwriters of Colombia. In the 1980s, Moreno broke through the literary\nmold of her times marked by the work of Gabriel García Marquez\nwith the publication of Algo tan feo en la vida de una\nseñora bien (1980). The protagonists of the book, who are\nwomen, serve as vehicles for the exploration of life in a patriarchal\nsociety. Moreno placed value on providing a genealogy of women as her\nprotagonists (e.g., the daughter, the mother, the grandmother),\nreflecting the importance of transgenerational communication amongst\nwomen. Thus, some argue her works provide a thematic thread of\nrebellion that runs through the lives of women and unites them in their\nhistories of resistance to patriarchal social orders (Gargallo 2004:\n106). \n\nWhile dubbed the “years of silence”, the work of women\nwriters during this period did find voice through literature and\npoetry. Their theoretical reflections were subsequently appreciated\nwith the resurgence of feminism in the later decades. \n\nThe years spanning the 1970s–1990s were marked with important\nsocial and political transformation for women in Latin America amidst\ncomplex political backdrops. Transitions from military regimes and\nprocesses of democratization as well as peace negotiations provide the\ncontext in which women’s mobilization emerges across Latin\nAmerica. The plurality of political conditions gave way to the\ndevelopment of diverse feminist ideas. The feminism of this time, also\ncommonly referred to as neofeminism, was particularly attuned to the\nbody (Bartra 2001: 1). Grounded in the pre-1970 history of Latin\nAmerican feminism, neofeminism strove toward the validation of\nwomen’s rights, but specifically centered on women’s\nfreedom over their bodies. The neofeminist perspective translated into\nmobilizing on issues of abortion, motherhood, sexual autonomy, rape,\nand abuse (Bartra 2001: 1). \n\nContemporary Latin American feminism surged during politically\nsomber times, especially under the presence of military regimes or\nnominal democracies that repressed civil liberties often in the name of\nnational security (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). Hence, as a\nsocial movement, Latin American feminism was born with an intrinsically\noppositional and occasionally clandestine character (Saporta Sternbach\net al. 1992: 397). As international organizations attempted to\ninfluence national health and population policies and governments to\ncontrol women’s bodies, the foci of Latin American feminisms grew\nmore complex (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 403). \n\nOne notable characteristic of feminism during this time is the\nrecognition of womanhood as a shared status. Women during these decades\nfound identity in their status of womanhood and their shared condition\nthat differentiated them from men (Gargallo 2004: 88). They rejected\n“man” as the standard model around which their political\naction organized. The push for social and political transformation\nfocused less on equality (e.g., the right to vote) and more on a desire\nfor liberty, denying notions of femininity as subordinate to\nmasculinist constructions of humanity (Gargallo 2004: 111). Latin\nAmerican feminism of the late 20th century encouraged\nencounters between women that recognized them as subjects, with their\nown histories, and on their own terms (Gargallo 2004: 88). \n\nAmid military regimes, the 1970s were characterized by a\nmobilization of women that took motherhood to be a political category.\nIn some countries, women resisted state repression as mothers of those\nwho had disappeared at the hands of the state (Gargallo 2004: 113). The\nCoMadres (Comité de Madres) of El Salvador formed in 1977 to\ninvestigate the disappearance of missing relatives. They photographed\nthe bodies of people found in the streets of El Salvador in order to\naid in identification. In the same year, the Asociación Madres\nde Plaza de Mayo in Argentina organized as mothers to search for their\ndisappeared children as a result of state terrorism enacted by the\nmilitary dictatorship that spanned the years of 1976–1983. In\nMexico, critical stances on motherhood were initiated by the\nneofeminist group Mujeres en Acción Solidaria (MAS), which\nprotested the sanctifying myth of motherhood on the eve of\nMother’s Day at El Monumento a la Madre (a monument honoring\nmothers) in Mexico City. They resisted the myth that a woman’s\nrole in society should be circumscribed to motherhood (Gutiérrez\n2012: 42). The protest continued in the years that followed. \n\nThe push to disconnect motherhood from womanhood set the stage for a\nseparation between the reproductive capacities of women’s bodies\nand their sexual health (Gargallo 2004: 114). Claims to the\ndecriminalization of abortion emerged under access to reproductive\nrights that sought to give women control over their own bodies. Thus,\nthe right to abort was defended on the grounds of a woman’s\nright to individual autonomy (Gargallo 2004: 114). In 1976, El\nMovimiento Nacional de Mujeres, along with other autonomous feminist\ngroups, organized one of the first congresses on the decriminalization\nof abortion that maintained the interruption of pregnancy as a\nwoman’s decision that should be made accessible through all\ninstitutions of public health (Gargallo 2004: 114). In the years that\nfollowed, feminists in Mexico used a variety of symbolic strategies in\ntheir fight for the legalization of abortion. They dressed in black to\npublicly mourn the women who had died as a result of clandestine\nabortions (Garagallo 2004: 115). Today, abortion remains tiered in\naccess throughout Latin America. Countries such as Chile, Nicaragua,\nDominican Republic, and El Salvador prohibit abortion entirely, even\nunder conditions where it would save a woman’s life. In\ncountries like Mexico, Guatemala, Panamá, and Venezuela\nabortion is legal only under conditions where it saves the life of the\nwoman. However, in countries like Argentina, Costa Rica, and Ecuador\nabortion is legal to the extent that it preserves the physical health\nof the woman. In some countries, conditions of rape are understood as\npart of the preservation of physical health (e.g., Argentina), while\nin others, the extension is made to allow abortion to the extent that\nit preserves the mental health of the woman (e.g., Colombia). Cuba,\nUruguay, and Puerto Rico are places that have legalized abortion\nwithout any restrictions that would require some particular reason. Although the\nbattle for access to abortion began during the 1970s, it continues to\nbe a contested political issue especially in places where access is\nentirely denied or restricted by other factors: physical health,\nmental health, or life preservation.  Moreover, in places like Puerto\nRico, the question of abortion is intricately bound up with histories\nof forced sterilization, making the issue more politically charged and\ncomplex. \n\nAs a time characterized by state repression, the 1970s were also a\ntime of awakening for many women who demanded social change (Bartra\n2001: 6). Latin American feminists not only challenged patriarchy by\ndefining themselves as distinct political subjects, but also challenged\nmale paradigms of domination expressed through the militaristic and\ncounter-insurgent state. The reality of state repression made Latin\nAmerican feminisms distinct in their ability to unveil the patriarchal\nfoundations of militarism and institutionalized violence (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 397). The intimate relationship between\npatriarchy and military state repression is best elucidated by the\nintersection between Chilean feminist activism and the push for\ndemocratization in Julieta Kirkwood’s famous phrase:\n“Democracia en el país, en la casa y en la cama”,\nwhich translates to: “Democracy in the nation, in the house, and\nin the bed” (Kirkwood 1986: 14). Latin American feminism of the\n1970s was linked to an activism that believed authoritarian regimes\nfound their roots where patriarchal oppression trickled into the\n“private” sphere. By the late 1970s, opposition movements\nemerged throughout Latin America, joined by women from all walks of\nlife defying their historical exclusion from political life (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 398–399). \n\nThe heterogeneity of contemporary Latin American feminism can be\ntraced to the diverse political conditions from which its activism\nemerged. Nevertheless, a theme can be found in the commitment to change\nthe social relations of production, including reproduction. Throughout\nthe region, women collectively participated in movements to engender\nhuman rights by seeking better access to education, healthcare, and\nurban services as well as resistance to military state repression\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 401). Latin America’s economic\ndependence and political repression during these years set the stage\nfor a distinct militant feminist activism that would continue to spread\ninto the decade of the 1980s. \n\nThe 1980s were characterized by the expansion of feminist theory and\npractice. Feminists started focusing on specialized activities that\ndeepened their vision of politics, culture, and society. The number of\nfeminist magazines, films, and video collectives increased.\nFurthermore, the number of centers for rape victims and abused women,\nas well as feminist health collectives, lesbian groups, and other\nspecifically gendered projects grew during this time (Saporta Sternbach\net al. 1992: 404). As feminists increased their activities in feminist\nprojects, they began creating more civil society organizations or\nNGO’s (non-government organizations) (Millán 2014:\n154). \n\nOne of the most important events to mark the 1980s was the first\nEncuentro Feminista Latinoamericano y del Caribe held in Bogotá,\nColombia. The Encuentros (“Encounters”), as they came to be\ncalled in short, served as regional critical forums for debates about\nfeminist politics and the movement’s overall relationship to\nsocial justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. The attendees of the\nFirst Encuentro came together on the heels of geographic and political\nisolation with a desire to carve out a path for autonomous politics.\nOver the years, the Encuentros extended the map of feminist politics\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 405). \n\nThe First Encuentro convened in Bogotá, Colombia, over the\ncourse of four days in July 1981; more than two hundred women from over\nfifty organizations attended. The region-wide gathering brought\ntogether many strands of feminism, creating a heterogeneous movement\nwith considerable tensions and conflicts. For instance, during the\nplanning stages of the meeting, heated discussions emerged between\nindependent/autonomous feminists, often identified as\nautónomas or feministas, and militant\npolitical feminists affiliated with political parties (e.g.,\nsocialist), often referred to as militantes. Independent\nfeminists expressed concern over the possibility that feminists aligned\nwith political parties might try to impose sectarian agendas diverting\nattention from issues central to feminist organizing (e.g.,\nreproductive rights) (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 407). \n\nThe most widely attended Encuentro of 1981, “Feminism and\nPolitical Struggle”, focused on the autonomy of the feminist\nmovement, double militancy (concurrent participation in a political\nparty and the feminist movement), and feminism and imperialism (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 408). The response to the session exemplified\nthe diversity of ideas involved in the feminist struggle. All of the\nparticipants agreed that women suffer a specific oppression by virtue\nof their womanhood, which is exacerbated by class. Their agreement\ntranslated into particular demands: equal pay, end of the double\nworkday, and the right to safe abortion as well as the right to choose\nmotherhood (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). Furthermore, it was\nclear that the political parties of the time across the region were not\ncentered on these demands in their claims for social change. Two\nnotable positions were developed in response to the session. The first\nposition maintained that neither capitalism nor socialism on their own\ncould end women’s oppression. Women’s liberation needed to\nbe articulated outside the networks of party-affiliated activism that\nwould make demands for complete social transformation to alter\noppressive relations. They held that severing the militante\nand the feminista was to misunderstand feminist politics,\nwhich is a comprehensive political praxis. The focus of feminist\npolitical activism needed to be in targeted feminist organizations,\nsince the revolutionary Left tended to place men in the center (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 409). The second position held that feminism on\nits own could not be revolutionary because of its inherent commitment\nto socialism. They thought feminism should be an organic outgrowth of\nsocialist struggles that could not be separated from struggles against\nclass oppression. Double militancy, on this view, was a practical\ndifficulty, but one that could be overcome (Saporta Sternbach et al.\n1992: 409). \n\nThe 1981 Encuentro reflected the larger social and political\nconditions out of which Latin American feminisms were evolving. The\nconflict between the feministas and the militantes\nexemplified the divergences in Latin American feminisms during the\n1980s. However, it also reflected the genesis of Latin American\nfeminist ideas in women’s political activism. So, although mired\nin conflict, the Encuentros signaled the intimate ties between ideas\nregarding gender struggle and the political conditions that give rise\nto those ideas. \n\nThe Second Encuentro, held in Lima, Perú in July 1983,\nthematically focused on patriarchy, a controversial topic\ngiven its association with imperialist American and European feminisms.\nThe Encuentro reflected a shift in feminist claims, identifying that\nsexism was not just an outcome of capitalism, but rather shaped by a\npatriarchal sex/gender system that functioned autonomously (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 412). Moreover, the Second Encuentro experienced\na public response to the visibility of lesbian identity within Latin\nAmerican feminisms, forcing many heterosexual women to confront their\nhomophobia (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 412). The meeting also\npushed the topic of racism, which resurfaced in subsequent years both\nin the Encuentros and the larger landscape of Latin American feminist\nideas that launched staunch critiques on the omission of race and\nracism from dominant feminist conversations. \n\nThe growth of the Encuentros testified to the growth of feminisms\nthroughout the region. The Fourth Encuentro held in Taxco, Mexico\n(1987) brought together 1,500 women. As the end of the decade was\nnearing, the Fourth Encuentro reflected increased complexity in Latin\nAmerican feminist politics, which was made palpable by the recurrence\nof the question: “Who is a feminist?” (Saporta Sternbach et\nal. 1992: 421). The discussion reflected divergences in what\nconstituted feminist politics and whether general community organizing\nwas sufficient to characterize feminist organizing, particularly where\ncommunity groups were controlled by the church or local political\nparties (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). Nevertheless, a key point\nremains that when the Encuentros began in 1981, feminism was still a\n“dirty word”, but by 1987, feminism had gained legitimacy\nand was validated in Leftist political circles, notably in the\nNicaraguan revolution (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). The\nEncuentros continued to demonstrate the diverse growth of Latin\nAmerican feminisms as a thriving and expansive map of ideas grounded in\ndifferent strands of political activism. Although the Encuentros\ncontinue to the present day, the Encuentros of the 1980s were\nsignificant developments which reflected an evolving social movement\nwith tense but important relationships among revolutionary struggles,\nfeminist goals, and claims for social justice. \n\nAt the end of the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic peaked, sexual\npolitics became increasingly conservative. Sex, once viewed as a\npolitical act that could blur the private/public divide and subvert\ntraditional gender roles, became fraught with difficulty. Young\nfeminists came of age at a time when sexual education shifted toward\nnarratives of the risks of sex and not its disruptive political\npotential (Gargallo 2004: 123–124). Furthermore, the closing of\nthe decade saw the continued linking between feminism and NGOs that\nwould be characteristic of the institutionalization of feminism in the\n1990s. For some, institutionalization entailed de-radicalization of\nfeminist politics in Latin America and the Caribbean (Gargallo 2004:\n125). \n\nLatin American feminisms during the 1990s are characterized by a\nfocus on gender equality and non-discrimination within the confines of\ninstitutions governed by neoliberal policies (Coba & Herrera 2013:\n18). As a result, they are referred to as liberal feminisms not\ngrounded in resistance, but rather in their adaptation to a neoliberal\ninfrastructure that was ushered in throughout the region. Neoliberalism\nhad a distinct impact on women’s activism and the development of\nfeminist ideas. Women were one of the most affected groups with the\nshifts in economic policies, and the phrase “feminization of\npoverty” accurately captured the detrimental impact on\nwomen’s lives. Many women joined the menial labor force (e.g.,\nmaquilas, agricultural labor) without any labor rights or\naccess to fair wages (Gargallo 2004: 117). \n\nAt the same time, feminist activists started coupling their efforts\nwith organizations that targeted policy change in favor of women and\noperated with a distinct language about violence, health, and human\nrights in tune with liberal politics (Gargallo 2004: 125). The concept\nof the autonomous individual reigned as the explanatory framework for\ndevelopment. Under the umbrella of individuality, people were\nresponsible for their own survival and development which were dependent\non their initiative in a market economy (Coba & Herrera 2013: 18).\nIn this context, the activist politics that had once characterized\nfeminist organizing shifted to less radicalized organizational\ninstitutions. A substantial portion of the feminist movement that\ntransitioned to institutions did so without critiquing economic\npolicies and neoliberalism (Bastian Duarte 2012: 157).\nInstitutionalized feminists started working alongside governments and\nagencies, which prioritized change in public policy but did not seek to\ninvestigate the roots of inequality that justified the need for policy\nchange. Moreover, conditions emerged where NGO’s were able to\noffer specialized resources for women. In doing so, they promoted\nfar-reaching gender discourse that was standardized with the\nuniversalizing criteria of the United Nations. With their hands tied by\ndonors, these organizations were not necessarily mindful of the\npriorities of local organizations or their populations (Bastian Duarte\n2012: 157). As a result, the infrastructure of institutionalization\nexacerbated existing power imbalances across ethnic and class\nlines. \n\nAmong the institutions participating in the institutionalization of\nfeminisms was the academy. From the late 1980s well into the 1990s,\nwomen’s studies programs started organizing throughout\nuniversities. Moreover, the study of feminist philosophy more broadly\nstarted finding its way into curricula as the activism of earlier\ndecades pressured universities to support women’s and gender\nstudies (Schutte & Femenías 2010: 400). The decade marked\nthe professionalization of feminism. Feminism, which had once been an\norienting force of activism, became employable and profitable (Bartra\n2001: 11). However, this is not to discredit the tremendous effort that\nthe development of university programs required. As university programs\nbecame institutional fixtures, they also served as counter-hegemonic\nspaces where resistance could be facilitated. \n\nThe 1990s also saw the initiation of journals and formal\npublications. In 1990, Debate Feminista was launched by Marta\nLamas. It remains one of the most impactful journal publications on\nintellectual feminisms. In 1991, La Correa Feminista was\ncreated to bring together the thoughts of autonomous and radical\nfeminists. It ran until 1998 when the editors self-assessed the\njournal’s goals and decided to launch Creatividad\nFeminista, an online publication which ran until 2008, when its\ndaughter site, MamaMetal, was created. Finally, La Doble\nJornada sprang as a feminist supplement to La Jornada,\nMexico’s leading Leftist newspaper, and ran from 1986–1998\n(Millán 2014: 156). \n\nDuring this time, Latin American feminisms began to privilege the\nuse of the category gender or the gender perspective\nover patriarchy as the conceptual framework from which to talk\nabout the situation of women. The shift to using language of\ngender is largely owed to the importation of North American\nfeminist ideas. In the Latin American context, Gayle Rubin’s work\nreceived substantial attention as evidenced by numerous translations as\nwell as by extensive commentary on its complex understanding of the\nsex/gender system (Gargallo 2004: 21). However, it is important to note\nthat the term was already being deployed by scholars and carried with\nit a variety of connotations (Schutte 1998b: 88). \n\nGender was translated to Spanish as\n“género”, which to many was a poor translation.\nGénero, which translates to English as\n“species” or “kind”, traveled to the Latin\nAmerican context via academic publishing and sparked debate on its\naptness to map onto the feminist conditions of the region. The gender\nperspective, which employs the paradigm of radical individualism\ncharacteristic of the decade, comes to stand alongside the concept of\nempowerment as one that can specifically target women’s needs.\nThe language of gender and empowerment was used by the United Nations\nas part of their universalizing goals for women during the 1995 World\nConference on Women held in Beijing, a moment which marked mounted\ntensions around the de-politicization of Latin American feminisms\n(Bastian Duarte 2012: 157). \n\nThe use of the themes of gender and empowerment was further deployed\nby newly democratized states. Feminist activists found themselves in a\ndifferent relationship to the state as it adopted the language of\ngender. Once a vehicle of repression, especially under\nmilitary rule, Latin American feminists now had to contend with a\ndrastically different engagement with the role of the state, one that\nhad co-opted the very terms of a movement that was initiated in\nopposition to its repression. Newly formed liberal democracies\nunderstood women as potential markets for modernizing and development,\nthus deploying the language of gender and empowerment (Alvarez 1998:\n271). However, the way in which the state managed poverty as part of\nits modernizing mission was mired in individualism with little focus on\ncommunities. \n\nPolitical and economic transitions influenced the development of\nfeminist ideas. Activism became institutionalized and the feminist\nmovement grew in various directions. As the 90s came to a close, what\nstarted out as a spontaneous social movement with radical ideas about\npatriarchy, militarism, and democratization found its way into the\nhalls of institutions and organizations that stifled feminist activism.\nThe institutionalization of feminism was so profound that its political\npromise seemed lost. However, as the opening of the 21st\ncentury demonstrates, this was not the case. Institutionalization was\nnot without critique, and the early 2000s marked the emergence of new\nvoices that took liberal dominant feminisms to task by focusing on\nanti-neoliberal and decolonial critique which began to call out the\nhegemonic practices of Latin American feminisms. \n\nThe institutionalization of feminism came under scrutiny in the\n2000s. Autonomous feminists argued that as feminist practices continued\nto normalize, they failed to account for the inequities among women. As\nthe century came to a close, critiquing (marginal) voices emerged,\narguing that liberal feminism tended to overlook difference, inequity,\nand exclusion amongst women located in vastly different social and\ncultural locations (Coba & Herrera 2013: 18). The Eighth Encuentro\n(November 1999) held in Juan Dolio, Dominican Republic, reflected the\npresence of these emerging voices as dominant feminisms’\n“Others”: Indigenous women, Afro-descended women, and\nlesbians whose position relative to the Encuentros had been marginal.\nThe claims of inclusivity and diversity of the Encuentros were brought\nunder critical scrutiny as they argued that their identities had been\nobscured under liberal feminism, which took gender to be characteristic\nof a foundational unity for the encounters. These\ndesencuentros (“disencounters”) formed the basis\nof new social and political critique that characterized the emerging\nvoices. \n\nIn response to the neoliberal shifts of the 80s and 90s, the early\n21st century brought with it an anti-neoliberal discourse to\nLatin American feminisms that was further fed by decolonial and\nanti-patriarchal stances. Amongst these were positions that argued for\nthe decolonization of universal feminism by taking into account the\naxes of race, ethnicity, and sexuality in the articulations of\nidentity. The 2000s were also marked by an attempt to dry out the\ninstitutionalization of gender. At the same time, there has not been an\nimpetus to reconfigure a social movement in the wake of neoliberal\nshifts (Coba & Herrera 2013: 19). \n\nWe are currently witnessing an emergence of ideas that is starting\nto reshape how we think about Latin American feminisms. However, the\nproject of reconfiguration is still very much in process. In this\ncontext, critical ideas about race and the history of racism have\nentered mainstream concerns, predominantly voiced from Afro-descended\nstandpoints (Curiel 2007). Further, lesbian feminists have brought\nforth criticisms of liberal feminism for not only paying less attention\nto race and racism, but also for centering on heteronormativity as part\nof the feminist agenda. One notable position holds that there is an\ninextricable link between lesbianism and feminism insofar as the\nadoption of a self-conscious feminism entails shifting engagement with\ndominant masculinity on all levels and this includes the realm of\ndesire (Espinosa Miñoso 2011: 403). Indigenous feminists have\nalso uncovered critical insights in the relationships among community,\nthe state, and political belonging. Their ideas about the balance\nbetween ethnic belonging and critiques of sexism are a call to dominant\nliberal feminism to rethink its concept of culture and community that\nrisks reducing Indigenous women to targets of development (Bastian\nDuarte 2012: 164). The emergence of these critical ideas takes liberal\nfeminism to task by calling out the dominance of middle-class,\nwhite/mestiza, and heteronormative models for feminist\nprojects as not only exclusionary, but also profoundly harmful.\nNotably, most of these positions take decolonization as an orienting\nproject and maintain that racism and heterosexism are rooted in\ncolonialism whose impact continues to plague Latin America and the\nCaribbean. \n\nIn 2007, GLEFAS (Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio, Formacíon\ny Acción Feminista) was founded with the intention of creating a\nspace for dialogue within the lesbian and feminist movement in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean as well as with other social and land\nstruggle movements in the region. They self-describe as seeking to\nproduce political analysis from an anti-racist, anti-military,\nanti-colonial, anti-capitalist, lesbian feminist perspective. In line\nwith their philosophical vision, they published Tejiendo de otro\nmodo: Feminismo, epistemología y apuestas decoloniales en Abya\nYala (2014b) as an outgrowth of a colloquium held in Chapel Hill,\nNorth Carolina in 2012. The book brings together a diverse group of\ncontemporary voices that intervene on hegemonic understandings of\nfeminism in the region in order to make room for a collective that\nappreciates the diversity of knowledges. Speaking from the margins, the\nbook takes as its central claim that decolonization is concomitant with\nde-patriarchialization. Hence, it reflects a shift in contemporary\nLatin American feminist writings that are paving the way for critical\nconsiderations of capitalism, imperialism, democracy, and identity.\nThese new voices of dissent are changing the landscape of Latin\nAmerican feminisms with unique ideas that call for rethinking what it\nmeans to be a feminist today. \n\nAutonomy is a foundational, albeit contested, concept in\nLatin American feminisms. It is a foundational concept to the extent\nthat feminist identity has hinged on the conceptualization of\nautonomy.  However, how autonomy is defined has been widely debated as\nthe term has been deployed in varying capacities. Autonomy has been\nused conceptually to forge alliances between women’s groups in\nLatin America that seek to eradicate gender-based oppression. It has\nalso been used to avoid co-option by actors like political parties,\nNGO’s, the state, and funding agencies. The result is a tension\nbetween the retention of ideological and financial autonomy and the\nwidening of feminisms’ scope and impact. Thus, the varying use\nof autonomy calls into question how it is being defined (Alvarez et\nal.  2003: 542). \n\nThe history of feminist autonomy in Latin American feminism is\nrooted in the activism of the 1970s and 1980s where it was invoked in\nopposition to militant feminists (militantes) involved with\nthe political parties of the Left. Autonomy, in this context, was\ndefined as independence from any organization that understood the fight\nfor women’s liberation as a secondary goal. On the other side\nstood those who took the fight for revolutionary social change as\nconcurrent with feminist involvement and advocated for double\nparticipation (Alvarez et al. 2003: 543). The rise of the political\nLeft in many Latin American countries involved resistance to political\nregimes, and the question of where dedication was rooted reflected the\nrelationship between feminism and the possibilities for social change.\nFeminist activism revealed the way in which the negotiation of autonomy\nwas and continues to be an evolving concept. As the 1980s progressed\nwith their shifting political landscape, the idea of autonomous\nfeminism came to be redundant. Hence, an understanding of engaged\nautonomy emerged, which maintained the importance of retaining a\nfeminist stance while negotiating or participating in social practice\n(Alvarez et al. 2003: 543). \n\nThe concept of autonomy surfaced throughout the Encuentros that\nspanned the 1970s–1990s and further illuminated the question of\ninclusion. If being autonomous entailed commitments to women’s\nliberation, being autonomous also signaled participation in a feminist\nproject. However, it is contestable what the criteria of inclusion\nunder the label of feminism was. As Latin American feminisms underwent\ninstitutionalization, two logics characterized the problem of\ninclusion. \n\nThe policy-advocacy logic argued for promoting feminist-influenced\ngender policy through governmental or non-governmental organizations.\nOn the other hand, the identity-solidarity logic distanced itself from\nformal institutions and remained centered on women’s movements\nthrough the development of feminist ideas in community and politics\n(Alvarez et al. 2003: 548). However, neither one of these necessarily\nentailed the inclusion of all women as is demonstrated by contemporary\ncritiques of the hegemonic practices of Latin American feminisms that\nfailed to pay attention to the importance of race, class, ethnicity,\nand sexuality in shaping subordination (Alvarez et al. 2003: 565).\nCutting across these logics is the way in which inclusion in feminism\nis contingent upon practice. How autonomy is understood hinges upon an\nunderstanding of feminist practice, and those practices are shaped by\ndynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Eventually, autonomy would be\nre-defined through individual and collective commitment to the\ntransformation of women’s lives and society as a whole (Alvarez\net al. 2003: 557). At present, there is not a settled definition of\nfeminist autonomy, but rather a pluralism of understanding that tracks\na variety of proposals for understanding feminist engagement and\npractices. \n\nAttention to North-South hemispheric relations has been one key\ntheoretical issue of Latin American feminism reflected in the ample\nscholarship on the migration of ideas. Latin American feminisms, much\nlike Latin American philosophy, have shown concern over the\nauthenticity of ideas that have traveled from epistemic centers (e.g.,\nthe United States, Europe). However, unlike Latin American philosophy,\nLatin American feminisms have responded to this concern by developing\ntheories that attend to dynamics with which ideas travel and the way in\nwhich ideas are re-negotiated and re-signified as they move across\nlocations. Generally, the claims about the ways in which ideas are\nreconfigured as they enter new contexts emerge over concerns about the\ntravel of ideas in a North-South direction, which not only remains\nnon-reciprocal, but further signals the centrality of North America and\nEurope as the centers of knowledge production. Latin American feminisms\nhave critically argued against the general understanding that ideas are\nformed in the “North” and travel to the “South”\n(Connell 2014). In order to defend this position, it is argued that the\nact of translating is itself a materially situated political task that\nre-signifies ideas as they migrate into varying contexts. The ideas\nthat emerge in the Latin American context are themselves unique to the\ncircumstances that generate their conditions of articulation. However,\ncircumstance is not sufficient to create uniqueness; rather, the\nprocesses of translation involved in the movement of ideas across\nhemispheres shift meaning. \n\nTranslation can be understood as any act of description,\ninterpretation, or dissemination. It is always caught up in power\nrelations that are configured by the asymmetries between people,\nlanguages, and regions (Lima Costa 2014a: 20). In the context of the\nAmericas, the movement of ideas occurs across asymmetrical power\nrelations. Ideas encounter roadblocks and migratory checkpoints as they\nattempt to cross borders (Lima Costa 2014a: 21). As a result, dialogue\nacross hemispheres mirrors asymmetries of power and has led to the\nmistaken notion that nothing originates from the Global South, but\nrather is only imported into the region from the Global North.\nTranslation is made further complex by “theory brokers”\n(e.g., academics, donors, feminist NGO’s) that mediate the\nmovement of ideas (Lima Costa 2014a: 25). As ideas move, their meanings\nshift, and their transformation is contingent on the culture or\ndiscipline that receives them (Lima Costa 2014a: 29). Hence, discursive\nmigration is not neutral, and in the process, location comes to frame\nhow to understand the reconfiguration of ideas. Thinking about\ntranslation through the matrix of discursive migration illuminates the\nway in which difference and power play a crucial role in how knowledge\nbecomes legitimated across difference. \n\nPlacing translation at the center of feminist practices recognizes\nthat translation is both politically and theoretically indispensable\nfor feminist, anti-racist, decolonial, and anti-imperial alliances\n(Alvarez 2014: 1). Translation is framed as a translocal phenomenon\ninsofar as it does not involve a fixed location, but further links\ngeographies of power (e.g., national, local) with subject positions\n(e.g., gender/sexual, ethnoracial) (Alvarez 2014: 2). In this\nconceptual space, Latin America and the Caribbean are configured with a\nheterogeneity of Latinidades within the United States and\nwithin Latin America and the Caribbean that exist and move across\nmultiple border spaces (Alvarez 2014: 2). Identities are formed in the\nnexus between borders, the spaces of intense confluence that\ncharacterize transmigrations across the region. \n\nSubjectivity is both place-based and mis- or displaced with the\nmovement of ideas. In this context, difference emerges as a rich\nterrain from which to engage others. For some, the difference that\nmediates speaking positions is always characterized by degrees of\nincommensurability as we can never be fully transparent with each other\nacross conditions of alterity. However, the condition of\nincommensurability is not sufficient to abandon translation, but rather\nan imperative to hear others in and across their difference (Schutte\n1998a: 61). \n\nOne method of navigating the conditions of incommensurability is\nrecognizing the complexity and diversity of speaking positions with\nwhich we engage. The term transloca has been argued to aid in\nelucidating such complexities of difference. Embodying both the\nprocesses of translation (“trans”) and the\nmaterial effects of location (“loca”), the\ntransloca highlights multiple dimensions that shape conditions\nof difference (Alvarez 2014: 4). Following the claims about\ntranslocation, transloca as a subject position attends to the\nmovement of bodies, text, capital, and theory along the North-South\naxis as they produce new epistemologies for apprehending the\nglobalizing Americas (Alvarez 2014: 4). Translocas are\nworld-traveling translators, cultural and political mediators, and\nhence also agents of transculturation (Alvarez 2014: 8). The term is\nintended to illuminate the way in which subjectivity is forged in and\nthrough movement across hemispheres mediated by location and\ntranslation. Attending to the dimensions of hemispheric movement\nelucidates the conditions of alterity that generate incommensurability,\nbut also puts into focus the way translation mediates the processes of\nidentity formation. \n\nThe arguments in regard to discursive migration, translation, and\ntranslocas further capture the links among Latin America, the\nCaribbean, and the United States as part of an intertwined diaspora\n(Alvarez 2014: 7). The intertwining is one that stretches in many\nhemispheric directions and as a result, makes Latin/a America a\nheterogeneous epistemic horizon. From Latinas in the United States to\nAfro-Latinas in Latin America, the ideas produced at the borders and\nnexus between, in, and through hemispheres are best understood by\nappreciating practices of translation. Hence, to think through Latin/a\nAmerica as an epistemic locale, in its multidimensionality, requires a\npolitics of translation that can foster coalition-building across\nhemispheres in spite of alterity. If taken seriously, feminist theories\nof translation demonstrate that ideas are products of hemispheric\nlocations, incommensurable with their predecessors (local or imported).\nThe discourses produced in Latin America and the Caribbean are not only\nalternative reconfigurations of ideas, but also ruptures in political\nepistemic practices. They call into question the notion that knowledge\nproduction is a naturalized feature of particular places\n(Femenías 2007: 14). Thus, the traffic of ideas generates new\nand diverse spaces from which to think about locations of difference\n(Femenías 2007: 15). \n\nAnother key debate that has emerged as a part of the broader Latin\nAmerican feminist conversation on the politics of translation has been\nover the use of the term gender, which, as previously noted,\nentered the hemispheric frame with the translation of Gayle\nRubin’s scholarship into Spanish. The term was translated into\nSpanish as género, whose direct translation is more\nakin to “genre” or “species”. Latin American\nfeminists have contested the legitimacy of gender as a\ncategory of feminist analysis (Schutte & Femenías 2010:\n403). \n\nPrior to the introduction of the term gender, feminists\nmost readily used the concept of patriarchy because it offered\na framework grounded in ideological and socioeconomic conditions that\nallowed for articulating the cause of women’s oppression (Schutte\n& Femenías 2010: 403). In many ways, patriarchy\nserved as a glue of consciousness-raising in late 20th\ncentury women’s movements of Latin America, helping connect women\nby identifying their shared subordinate status under conditions of\npatriarchy. \n\nDuring the Second Encuentro in 1982 (Lima, Perú)\npatriarchy was declared the foundational category from which\nLatin American feminists sought to understand their realities. It was\ndeployed as an explanation for the subordination of women, but also\nextended as an explanation for the conditions of compulsory\nheterosexuality, repression, violence against women and children, the\nprohibition of abortion, and varying forms of social injustice\n(Gargallo 2004: 92). It was further linked into frameworks that sought\nto identify the role of militarization and capitalism in the oppression\nof women. Hence, it provided a methodological frame from which to\narticulate claims about power, oppression, and domination that united\nwomen on many fronts. Patriarchy was a conceptual stronghold\nof Latin American feminism akin to what imperialism was to national\nliberation struggles (Gargallo 2004: 92). It was explanatorily powerful\nbecause it could account for complex realities while also providing an\nexplanation for the shared experiences of women. Unfortunately, the\nexplanatory power of the term was so expansive that it rendered\nhistorical specificities opaque since nothing could exist at its\nmargins (Gargallo 2004: 92). \n\nReplacing the focus on patriarchy, the gender\nperspective (“perspectiva de género”) or\ngender focus (“enfoque de género”) became\nthe methodological framework from which to talk about women and\nwomen’s issues across Latin America. Woman was replaced\nas a foundational category by gender, which became a blanket\nterm so user-friendly that anyone could use it as a referent to\nwomen’s issues (Schutte & Femenías 2010: 404). The\nease with which it was used entailed the softening of radical militant\ncritiques of patriarchy that had characterized feminist\ntheorization in earlier decades. Gender was incorporated into\npublic policy and social programs by state and intergovernmental\norganizations, reflecting the way in which it could be taken up as part\nof the lexicon for even policies not feminist-inspired (Lima Costa\n2014a: 26). On the flip side, the Vatican during its preparation for\nthe 1995 Conference on Women feared using the word gender as\nit might entail the acceptance of homosexuality, the destruction of the\npatriarchal family, and the dissemination of feminism (Lima Costa\n2014a: 28). \n\nAlthough the movement of gender across hemispheres is far\nfrom complete, it is important to recognize the way in which the\ntraffic of gender took place in and through material\nconditions. One notable method of translating and migrating concepts is\nthrough academic journals, and the debates on the uses of\ngender have revealed broader reflections on how concepts come\nto carry epistemic weight. The transnational citational market is one\nkey dimension in this process as who gets cited, where, and by whom\nexposes the routes through which theories have traveled in global\ncontexts (Lima Costa 2014b: 142). In light of the conceptual travel and\nuse of gender, Latin American feminisms ask that one consider\nthe way in which the global privileging of English as the linguistic\nmedium impacts what knowledge is allowed to circulate (Lima Costa\n2014b: 142). Moreover, these reflections bring to the fore the fact\nthat English cannot be viewed as a transparent medium as its privileged\nstatus sets the stage for what gets taken up as worth translating in\nthe first place. It should then be no surprise that gender has\ntraveled so far. Its traffic is a marker of the imperative to create\nconditions for productive “mis-translations” that create\nspaces for heterogeneous conceptual development (Lima Costa 2014b:\n144). \n\nAlthough gender has been a key focus of analysis, Latin\nAmerican feminist thought has also concentrated on the importance of\naccounting for the complexity of identity. Conceptually,\ngender on its own is insufficient to account for the\ncomplexities of identity. Notably, Latin American feminisms have paid\nattention to the ways in which class, race/ethnicity, and sexuality are\nnecessary components for understanding the lived experience of\nidentity, which is never conceptualized as pure nor one-dimensional\n(Feménias 2007: 16). \n\nThe idea that class is a key dimension of women’s lives is one\nthat is rooted in Latin American feminist activisms of the late\n19th and early 20th centuries. As previously\nnoted in Section 1 (on the history of Latin American feminism),\nwomen’s fights for equality of this time were framed in terms of\nequitable access to social goods (e.g., education). The impact of this\npush was the transformation of the material lives of people living in\npoverty more generally. Considerations of the importance of class\nconditions in understanding the plight of women and the poor have been\nlong rooted in Latin American feminist ideas. Feminist projects\nconcerned with the advancement of women in civil society converged\nwith labor movements and anti-imperial resistance (e.g., Luisa\nCapetillo). This trend re-emerged during resistance movements of the\n1970s that aligned feminist projects with revolutionary parties of the\nLeft across Latin America. As a result, attention to class dimensions\nhas long been part of the feminist methodology. However, this\nattention has not been without fault. Contemporary theories from the\nwork of Afro-descended women have argued that the overwhelming\nattention paid to class has come at the expense of analyzing the role\nthat racism has played in the marginalization and exclusion of\nAfrican-descended and Indigenous populations (Curiel 2007). \n\nThe reflections on race/ethnicity of Latin American feminist\nmethodology are diverse, demonstrating the racial heterogeneity\ngenerated by the colonial condition. Colonialism not only initiated\ncontemporary understandings of race/ethnicity but generated conditions\nof racial formation under systems of exploitation and subordination.\nSpecifically, the colonial history of Latin America entailed the\nsubordination of Indigenous and Afro-descended peoples (Schutte &\nFemenías 2010: 407). Economically, colonialism entailed the\nenslavement and exploitation of these populations. Culturally,\ncolonialism ensured the imposition of a socio-symbolic order that\nentrenched whiteness as a norm and cultural authority (Schutte &\nFemenías 2010: 407). Concurrently, norms of gender and class\nemerge through the production of race, whose economic impact is\nreflected through the link between whiteness and class ascension.\nSubsequently, nation-building projects in Latin America and the\nCaribbean were forged by political elites with patriarchal ideologies\nmired in racism and classism. The impact of these ideologies has\nentailed a racialized social stratification that reflects the privilege\nof whiteness and leaves women disproportionally affected (Curiel 2007:\n98). \n\nAgainst this backdrop, feminist reflections on race/ethnicity have\nsought to undermine the racism of national ideologies that have led to\ntheir subordination and marginalization. One such ideology is that of\nmestizaje which emerged as part of nation building projects\nthroughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Mestizaje favored\nthe formation of a racially-mixed people but came saturated with\nEurocentrism and privileged the whitening of the Americas.\nMestizaje ensured structural inequalities as it racialized\nclass differences while maintaining racism a myth. On the heels of\nthese conditions, notable contributions to the discussion on\nrace/ethnicity in Latin America and the Caribbean have come from\nAfro-descended and Indigenous women who have been systemically\nmarginalized in these social processes. They argue that\nmestizaje functions as a sequel to colonialism that continues\nto entail subordination and marginalization in social life (Curiel\n2007: 98). \n\nRacialized women in Latin America and the Caribbean have also\npointed to the racism of dominant feminist methodology that took\nwomanhood to be a shared categorical status but dismissed the\nimportance of the specificities determined by race/ethnicity and class\nidentity. In so doing, the voices of racialized women have opened up\nnew avenues for contemporary critical feminist investigation. For\ninstance, Afro-descended women have shown how the methodologies of\nstudying women from colonial times detrimentally read the lives of\nenslaved women one-dimensionally as solely victims of slavery,\noverlooking the ways in which many participated in acts of resistance.\nActs like the waste of household goods or self-induced abortions to\navoid the enslavement of children are best understood as acts of\ndomestic marronage and need to be read as part of the history of\nAfro-descended women in the Americas (Albert 2003). In this context,\nthe call for a more multidimensional analysis of racialized women also\nentails demonstrating that for racialized women, the public and the\nprivate spheres are not separate entities as hegemonic feminism\npurported (Curiel 2016: 49). Hence, a call for the blackening of\nfeminism has emerged as a way of elucidating the relationship between\nracism and sexism in order to better understand the histories of women\nthroughout the Americas (Carneiro 2005). \n\nFurther, racialized women of Latin America and the Caribbean have\nprovided new constructive frameworks for conceptualizing racialized and\nethnic identities. One such attempt can be found in the development of\nAmefricanidad, a term coined by Afro-Brazilian scholar\nLéila Gonsalez, that resists the use of Latinidad\nbecause of its Eurocentric underpinnings, much like how\nmestizaje downplays the Indigenous and African dimension of\nLatin America and the Caribbean (Curiel 2007: 99). Building on the use\nof Amefricanidad or Amefricanicity, others have\nargued for the use of the term as a privileged epistemology that\nenhances the visibility of Afro-descended feminism in the region\n(Alvarez & Caldwell 2016: v). Amefricanidad tracks the\nimportance of African and Indigenous roots of identity, but also seeks\nto think from within those identities as it pursues an intersectional\napproach to racism, colonialism, and imperialism (Alvarez &\nCaldwell 2016: v). Amefricanidad tracks racialized identity,\nbut at the same time signals plurality in its capacity to capture the\nmultiple inheritances of Latin America and the Caribbean. \n\nBy keeping the impact of the colonial condition at the center of\ntheory, contemporary Latin American and Caribbean feminists have also\ncritically evaluated norms of sexuality, a topic which dominant liberal\nfeminism long maintained at the margins. The lesbian movement of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean stems from mixed-gender homosexual\norganizations that were in dialogue with the feminist movement of the\nlate 20th century (Bastian Duarte 2012: 165). However, for\nmuch of this time, discussions on sexual preference were set aside\nwithin the liberal feminist agenda. Lesbian feminism, much like the\nlarger panorama of Latin American feminism, is heterogeneous.\nNevertheless, there is one common theoretical denominator: the\nimperative to transform ideas and practices related to\nheteronormativity, lesbianism, and gender relations (Bastian Duarte\n2012: 169). At stake in the analysis of lesbian feminism is the way in\nwhich heteronormativity permeates all aspects of lived experience,\nincluding the intersections among sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, and\ngender. For instance, Afro-descended lesbian feminists have linked\nracism and sexism to heteronormativity by arguing that the obligatory\ndimensions of heterosexuality are intimately bound up with the\nreproduction of racist and sexist practices (Curiel 2016: 50). Others\nhave argued that there is an intimate relationship between lesbianism\nand feminism that hinges on the recognition that liberation for women\nis founded in decentering patriarchy, which often involves\nre-negotiating relationships with men and masculinity on all levels\n(Espinosa Miñoso 2011: 404). \n\nImplicit in discussions of the complexity of identity is the\nrelationship between the individual and the collective. The\nrelationship between structural collective conditions and the formation\nof individual identity attends to the ways in which human beings are\nnot isolated meaning-makers. However, when the conditions of\nmeaning-making reflect the heirlooms of colonialism, oppression,\npatriarchy, or obligatory heterosexuality, tense negotiations are\nrequired between the individual and the collective. Indigenous\nfeminists have negotiated the political and personal value of ethnic\nbelonging with individual feminist claims (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164).\nThe liberal neofeminist movement has long emphasized the importance of\nsexual and reproductive rights of women, but while these issues may\nrepresent core aspects of many women’s lives, they do not\nrepresent core issues in Indigenous women’s struggles. \n\nFor instance, the topic of violence is one at the center of feminist\nconcerns of many political persuasions. However, from the perspective\nof Indigenous feminism, violence is not just constructed in terms of\ngendered violence but is also generated by those who have seized and\ndestroyed Indigenous lands (Bastian Duarte 2012: 163). Hence, an\nunderstanding that projects violence solely centered on individuality\nwill not be sufficient to generate conditions of equality for\nIndigenous feminists whose collective identities serve as the primary\nmethod of preserving their cultural systems (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164).\nThe meaning of equality and justice for Indigenous feminists of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean follows the specificity of their politics,\nwhich takes the role of the community as central to identity and hence\ncalls for new ways of thinking about the relationship between\nindividual feminist demands and collective transformation (Bastian\nDuarte 2012: 165). Although not all Indigenous peoples of Latin America\nand the Caribbean reside in their own communities as many have migrated\nto more urban areas, it is important to appreciate the ways in which\ncommunity in a multifaceted sense operates as an important feature of\ntransformative projects. \n\nLatin American feminist philosophy emerges at the nexus between\ntheory and practice. The social activism of the 20th century\nfueled the production of theories that form the tradition of Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy as well as its place in the academy.\nHowever, the study of Latin American feminist philosophy remains scarce\nand derelict (Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). The existence\nof Latin American feminist philosophers has been largely denied, and\nthe specificities of their theoretical contributions have been erased\nunder the sexist, Eurocentric orientation of philosophy. Recognition of\ntheir existence is a political act that contests the dominant\narchitecture of the history of philosophy. Taking account of Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy requires a historical and philosophical\nreconstruction that understands the fact that women from Latin America\nand the Caribbean have long been thinkers. The philosophical work that\nremains to be done requires engagement with their ideas. \n\nLatin American feminist philosophy is political (Gargallo 2004: 41).\nThe ideas that pushed social transformation in the 20th\ncentury movements are grounded in politics that recognized the\nimperative for social change. The political dimension of Latin American\nfeminist philosophy is reflected in the fact that many Latin American\nfeminist philosophers were or are activists, and the span of their\nthought often reflects their participation in resistance movements.\nResistance can mean many types of political projects, and in the\ncontext of Latin American feminist philosophy, the act of citing is\nunderstood as political because it works toward building a\nphilosophical canon that legitimizes the voices of women long excluded\nfrom philosophical practice. \n\nTracing a philosophical history of Latin American feminist thinkers\nis a task that merits scholarly attention, and to date there is a\nlacuna of resources. One major obstacle is linguistic as a lot of\ntextual sources have not been translated. Furthermore, the resources\nthemselves are not ample, although some notable publications have been\nmade. The Antología del pensamiento feminista\nnuestroamericano: tomo 1 del anhelo a la emancipación\n(2010a) and Antología del pensamiento feminista\nnuestroamericano: tomo 2 movimiento de liberación de las\nmujeres (2010b) coordinated by Francesca Gargallo are some of the\nfirst large-scale publications to anthologize Latin American and\nCarribean feminist philosophical writings. They are non-exhaustive\nresources that testify to the theoretical, argumentative, and\nmethodological contributions of Latin American and Caribbean feminist\nwriters spanning from the 15th to the 20th\ncentury. As the anthology rescues writers often lost to the pages of\nhistory, it also takes Latin America and the Caribbean, as\nnuestra or our America, as the point of theoretical\ndeparture. Thus, it enables a collective recognition of a history of\nfeminist thought that does not depend on North America or Europe for\nits identity. The anthology further demonstrates that Latin American\nfeminist philosophical thought is hardly new. It is grounded in a\nhistory of resistance to social and political conditions that impeded\nthe recognition of women as knowledge-producers (Gargallo 2009: 418).\nIt has been argued that early feminist philosophies are some of the\nfirst systems of thought to account for the politics of legitimacy\nwhereby social conditions grant privilege to the epistemic productions\nof one group in order to exclude and delegitimize the voices of others\n(Gargallo 2009: 420). The critique of legitimacy is one that follows\nLatin American feminist philosophy well into the 20th and\n21st centuries. \n\nFor instance, Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695), one of\nthe most cited writers of this tradition, advocated for the\nintellectual life of women, which entailed denouncing norms of\nhegemonic masculinity. Her image as a protofeminist writer has been\nassociated with lesbianism, as she led a monastic life and in so doing,\nresisted the dominance of masculinity (Gargallo 2009: 419). Her\nexistence as an intellectual defied the authority of her times and her\nresistance is reflected in her writing. \n\nA further example can be found in the thought of Luisa Capetillo\n(1879–1922), which is rooted in her participation in labor\nmovements in Puerto Rico and the United States during her lifetime. As\na cigar factory reader, she was employed by the workers and functioned\nas an intellectual and cultural intermediary by reading workers\neverything from news to political theory. Capetillo became a reader at\na time when forty percent of the tobacco workers and eighty-seven\npercent of the agricultural work force of Puerto Rico were illiterate\n(Ramos 1992: 14). However, the presence of readers, like Capetillo,\nmade the tobacco labor force one of the most socially conscious (Ramos\n1992: 21). Her activism drew intellectual support from European\nanarchist philosophy that traveled to Puerto Rico through translations\nof authors like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Diderot, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Marx,\nand Nietzsche (Ramos 1992: 27). Capetillo made a mark on the Puerto\nRican labor movement, but she became a transnational migrant as she was\ndriven out of Puerto Rico by a government crackdown on anarchists (Ruiz\n2016: 3). In her short life of forty-two years she would come to reside\nin New York City, Ybor City, and La Habana as she continued her\nactivism by organizing labor strikes, arguing against the institution\nof marriage, engaging in stylized resistance by wearing men’s\nclothing, and publishing four books (Ramos 1992: 66). Capetillo’s\nmost important contribution was producing ideas rooted in a\nworkers’ rights movement that moved across nations and was itself\ninspired by the travel of ideas. \n\nPhilosophy as a field of study in Latin America and the Caribbean\nwas institutionalized and professionalized in the years spanning\n1940–1960. Hence, it is no surprise that subsequently women\ngained formal university education in philosophy. Matilde Carranza\n(1892–1981), born in San José, Costa Rica, was Costa\nRica’s first woman to receive a Ph.D. in philosophy. She attended\nthe University of Wisconsin and is also noted as one of the first women\nto receive a doctoral degree from the university. Her philosophical\nthought centered on the importance of education for social\ntransformation, which aligned with her anti-despotic and egalitarian\npolitics. However, her most notable impact was shattering the myth that\nwomen were not apt for philosophy, thus paving the way for women of\nother generations (Prada Ortiz 2013: 32–33). Ana Isabel Alfaro\n(1944–1990), born in Alajuela, Costa Rica, studied philosophy at\nthe University of Costa Rica. Her philosophical commitments centered on\nthe role of education in national development, as she took education to\nbe socially transformative. As a result, Alfaro saw the role of the\nuniversity as an integral part of social change. Her commitments to the\ntransformative powers of education were methodologically rooted in\ninterdisciplinarity and cultural diversity. Notably, Alfaro placed\nimportance on the creative power of women within her philosophy of\neducation, arguing for their creative potential and reflecting this\ncommitment in her political alliances with poor women (Prada Ortiz\n2013: 55). \n\nFollowing suit, Monelisa Lina Pérez Marchand, Victoria Junco\nPosadas, Olga Victoria Quiroz Martínez, Rosa Krauze, Elsa\nCecilia Frost, Vera Yamuni, and María del Carmen Rovira Gaspar\nentered academic philosophy in Mexico in the middle of the\n20th century through the seminars of José Gaos\n(Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). Notable among these is Vera\nYamuni (1917–2003) and María del Carmen Rovira, who\nrecognized the importance of doing philosophy from a Latin American\nperspective with a keen eye toward the specificities of women. Rovira\nwould apply this methodology to historicism and Yamuni to humanism\n(Gargallo 2009: 423). Yamuni is particularly important as her work and\nplace in the academy influenced many generations of feminist\nphilosophers. She was a transnational thinker born of Lebanese parents\nin Costa Rica, although she did most of her studying, teaching, and\nwriting in Mexico. Yamuni studied under Gaos and would dedicate a part\nof her intellectual career to engaging with the work of Gaos, notably\ncritiquing his misogyny. She further dedicated time to translate texts\nfrom English and Arabic to Spanish, reflecting her commitment to\ncreating conditions of philosophical access (Prada Ortiz 2013: 71).\nHowever, she is notably remembered as a feminist thinker through her\nwork on Sappho, Virginia Woolf, and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as her\nfeminist analysis of the role of women in the history of philosophy.\nHer writing conceptually explored sameness and difference long before\nit became a hotbed of feminist philosophical analysis in the 1990s\n(Prada Ortiz 2013: 87). Her influence as a feminist philosopher is\nprofound as she has been cited as the first to introduce feminist\nphilosophy into Mexico by her student Graciela Hierro, who became an\niconic figure of Latin American feminist philosophy in the 1980s and\n1990s (Prada Ortiz 2013: 83). \n\nThe social transformation of the 1970s and 1980s reverberated into\nthe field of philosophy. As women increasingly began to establish\nthemselves in the academy, their ideas developed. On the shoulders of\nsymbolic mothers and the politics of the times, Latin American feminist\nphilosophy began to proliferate as a diverse system of thought that\ntook feminist theorizing to be a form of politics. However, the points\nof departure for analysis varied. Graciela Hierro, student of Yamuni,\ndeveloped a feminist ethics informed by utilitarianism that explored\nthe intimate relationship between ethics and politics focused on\nliberation and pleasure. For Hierro, women’s politics is one\ncentered on making claims about the role of women in a society where\nthe condition of womanhood is understood as a variant characteristic of\nhuman life (Hierro 1990). Hierro, much like Yamuni and the women that\ncame before her, functioned as a symbolic philosophical mother to many\nas she heavily influenced a generation of feminist scholars. Eli\nBartra, a student of Hierro’s, maintained that feminism is a\ntheoretical current dedicated to uncovering what it means to be a\nwoman. For her, the feminist project is political because feminism is a\npolitical philosophy (Bartra 2001: 12). Diana Helena Maffía of\nArgentina, influenced by Bartra, further maintains that feminism is\nboth a political position and a critical theory that lends itself\ntoward the revision of political ideals (Rietti & Maffía\n2005). María Luisa Femenías, also writing from Argentina,\nmaintains a link between feminism and politics but takes Latin American\nfeminism to be characterized by its unique appreciation of the\nintersections among gender, class, race/ethnicity, and religion as they\ncollectively forged conditions of existence (Femenías 2007).\nUrania Ungo Montenegro of Panamá defines feminism as a political\ntheory of women that reflects the relationship between women and\npolitics (Ungo Montenegro 2000). \n\nAlthough they diverge in their characterizations of the relationship\nbetween feminism and politics, all of these positions share a general\nunderstanding that to philosophically discuss Latin American feminism\nis to engage in political theory in a way that elucidates the diverse\nand complex relationships among women, gender, and politics. This list\nis by no means exhaustive, and further figures like Rosario Castellanos\nof Mexico and Celia Amorós of Spain should not be forgotten as\nthey influenced the positions developed by these thinkers. Furthermore,\nphilosophers like Ofelia Schutte, Cuban-born and writing in the United\nStates, have made notable contributions to the landscape of Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy, reminding readers that the feminist\ntradition occupies a part of a wider tradition of political liberation\nand theory of Latin America. All of these women dared to be thinkers at\ntimes when being a Latin American woman in philosophy was unheard of,\nand they have come to form the foundation of a canon of thinkers that\npaved the way for new and emerging voices. \n\nDissident voices of the early 2000s waged a decolonial critique that\ncame to characterize contemporary Latin American feminist philosophical\nscholarship. Influenced by the pivotal contributions of María\nLugones (2007, 2008), contemporary decolonial Latin American feminist\nscholarship has tackled Eurocentrism, colonial underpinnings, and\nomissions of identity in feminist philosophy. Lugones was an integral\nvoice in the formation of a decolonial feminist tradition as she was\nthe first scholar to articulate the concept of the coloniality of\ngender. In conversation with the scholarship of Peruvian Aníbal\nQuijano (2000), she maintained that the modern sex/gender system is\nrooted in the colonial project that imposes a dimorphic sex/gender\nsystem framed through heteronormativity. Complementing Quijano, she\nmaintains that the colonial/modern gender system required the\ncategorization of human and non-human and the invention of racial\ndivisions of the human. However, she critically adds that gender played\nan important role in these relationships, a point Quijano overlooks. As\na result, the status of white women, existing alongside colonizing\nwhite men, operated on a different nexus committed to the reproduction\nof racialized humanity. The peoples of the colonized world did not\nparticipate in the modern gender system prior to its imposition. The\nimport of this argument is that gender and sexuality are\nco-constitutive of race and are formed in and through the colonial\nproject that sought to subordinate colonized peoples. Hence, to\ntheorize about gender entails a look at the heirlooms of colonialism\nthat built the possibilities of the modern world through the\ncategorization of people into racialized, gendered humanity. This\ncritique problematizes any idea of shared gender in womanhood because\nit fails to account for the racial and class differences that cut\nacross the formations of identities in the Americas. \n\nOne of the most notable and comprehensive texts that brings Latin\nAmerican decolonial voices together is Tejiendo de otro modo:\nfeminism, espistemología y apuestas descoloniales en Abya\nYala (2014b), edited by Yuderkys Espinosa Miñoso, Diana\nGómez Correal, and Karina Ochoa Muñoz. The book provides\na critical intervention in contemporary Latin American feminisms from\nthe diverse positions and experiences of women (Escobar 2014: 11).\nRooted in decolonial epistemic practices, the book reconceives Latin\nAmerica as Abya Yala, the Kuna (Indigenous people of\nPanamá and Colombia) term for what colonizers termed\n“America”. Abya Yala translates as “land of\nfull maturity” or “land of vital blood” and is taken\nas a methodological starting point for theorizing ways of knowing\nthrough a decolonial lens. The contributors adhere to the claim that\ndecolonization cannot occur without de-patriarchialization. In other\nwords, resistance to capitalism, racism, homophobia, and all forms of\ndomination related to our modern social order has to incorporate\nstrategies of de-patriarchialization (Escobar 2014: 11). As such, the\ntext brings to the fore the importance of intersecting Latin American\nfeminisms with decolonial thought and exemplifies new emerging critical\nvoices that contribute to growth and proliferation. \n\nThe scholarship notably produces a Latin American feminist genealogy\ncommitted to prioritizing the voices of those systematically\nmarginalized or ignored and decenters dominant white,\nupper/middle-class feminisms that have failed to account for difference\n(Espinosa Miñoso et al. 2014a: 14). The scholarship is a further\ntestament to the fact that no one dominant category will solve the\nproblem of unification (Espinosa Miñoso et al. 2014a: 20). The\nproject of decolonial feminisms is not framed by privileging one\ncategory of analysis over another (e.g., race over gender); rather, it\nproposes a systemic critique focused on the conceptual framework of\ndominant Latin American feminisms, calling attention to the ways it has\nreified classism, sexism, racism, and heteronormativity. The project of\ndecolonial feminisms is a movement in process, but its core seeks to\nbring together the productions of thinkers, intellectuals, feminist\nactivists, lesbian feminists, Afro-descended women, Indigenous peoples,\npoor mestizas, and allies committed to the historical\nrecuperation of anti-racist theory and practice from the epistemic\nposition of Abya Yala (Espinosa Miñoso et al. 2014a:\n32). \n\nThe Latin American decolonial feminist tradition has found\ninfluential allies in the Latina/x feminist tradition of the United\nStates. Latina/x feminisms took shape during the 1960s and 1970s as\npart of a wide range of political struggles seeking gender and social\njustice that comes to form a wide landscape of theories. The term\n“Latina/x” is broad, but far from monolithic as it can\ncapture a range of identities (e.g., Afro-Latina, Afro-Caribbean,\nNuyorican, Xicana). It symbolically encapsulates identity conditions of\nmigration, immigration, and diaspora to the United States from\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although Latina/x\nfeminisms are a wide-ranging field, they generally adhere to a system\nof thought that attempts to unravel interlocking systems of oppression,\nreflecting on the conditions of borderlands, race/ethnicity, gender,\nsexuality, immigration, and religion in unique ways. Most importantly,\nLatina/x feminist theory pays close attention to lived experience and\nmade notable contributions to theories of identity that extend beyond\nthe borders of the United States. Here, figures like Gloria\nAnzaldúa, Cherríe Moraga, Emma Pérez, Juanita\nRamos, Norma Alarcón, Chela Sandoval, Mariana Ortega, Ofelia\nSchutte, and María Lugones have been of significance. Notably,\nthe work of Anzaldúa influenced Lugones’ conceptualization\nof the coloniality of gender, which is at the centerfold of decolonial\nfeminist theory in both Latin America and the United States. Although\ntheories are always tied to their locations, they also travel in ways\nthat require attending to the processes of re-signification undergone\nthrough their traffic. It is for this reason that some decolonial\nfeminist thinkers have called for closer attention to the specificities\nof alterity that might set limits on the theoretical application of\nideas (Mendoza 2014: 101). Notwithstanding, the Latina/x feminist\ntradition has been influential on its own merits and continues to pave\ncoalitional roads with Latin American and Caribbean thinkers both\nwithin and outside the United States. \n\nThe history of Latin American and Caribbean feminist ideas is\nextensive. However, it is one that remains underappreciated in North\nAmerican and European academic spaces. The omission of Latin American\nfeminisms is further compounded by the fact that most of its primary\nresources remain untranslated from Spanish, making the travel of ideas\ndifficult. For some, the linguistic inaccessibility might not be\nproblematic as it signals the need for epistemic centers to accommodate\nacross difference, and for others, it merely highlights the ample\namount of work that remains to be done. Either way, the Latin American\nfeminist tradition is one that methodologically reminds its readers\nthat theory is always grounded in practice. Thus, placing the ideas of\nwomen and their push for social transformation at the centerfold of\nphilosophical and theoretical activity demands contextualization. For\nphilosophical practices more specifically, Latin American feminisms\nremind us that women have been thinking much longer than they have been\ncredited for and philosophers need to merely start asking: What were\nthey thinking about?","contact.mail":"stephanie.riveraberruz@marquette.edu","contact.domain":"marquette.edu"}]
