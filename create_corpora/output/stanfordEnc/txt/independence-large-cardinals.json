One very general way to\ninvestigate the space of possible mathematical systems is under the\nrelation of interpretability.  Under this relation the space of\npossible mathematical systems forms an intricate hierarchy of\nincreasingly strong systems.  Large cardinal axioms provide a\ncanonical means of climbing this hierarchy and they play a central role\nin comparing systems from conceptually distinct domains.\n\n\n\nThis article is an introduction to independence, interpretability,\nlarge cardinals and their interrelations.  Section 1 surveys the\nclassic independence results in arithmetic and set theory.  Section 2\nintroduces the interpretability hierarchy and describes some of its\nbasic features.  Section 3 introduces the notion of a large cardinal\naxiom and discusses some of the central examples.  Section 4 brings\ntogether the previous themes by discussing the manner in which large\ncardinal axioms provide a canonical means for climbing the hierarchy\nof interpretability and serve as an intermediary in the comparison of\nsystems from conceptually distinct domains.  Section 5 briefly touches\non some philosophical considerations. \n\n\n\nLet us begin with the notion of an axiom system.  To motivate\nthis notion consider the manner in which justification traditionally\nproceeds in mathematics.  In reasoning about a given domain of\nmathematics (or, in fact, any domain) the question of justification is\nsuccessively pushed back further and further until ultimately one\nreaches principles that do not admit more fundamental justification.\nThe statements at this terminal stage are elected as axioms\nand the subject is then organized in terms of derivability from the\nbase of axioms.  In the case of arithmetic this led to the axiom\nsystem PA (Peano arithmetic) and in the case of set theory it led\nto the axiom system ZFC (Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom\nof Choice). \n\nTwo natural questions arise: (1) If the axioms do not admit of more\nfundamental justification then how does one justify them?  (2) Is the\nbase of axioms sufficiently rich that one can settle every sentence on\nthis basis? \n\nThere are two traditional views concerning the epistemological status\nof axioms.  On the first view the axioms do not admit further\njustification since they are self-evident.  On the second\nview the axioms do not admit further justification since they\nare definitive of the subject matter.  Each of these views\nconcerning our first question leads to an associated optimistic view\nconcerning our second question—according to the first optimistic\nview, all mathematical truths are derivable (in first-order logic)\nfrom self-evident truths, while according to the second optimistic\nview, all mathematical truths are derivable (in first-order logic)\nfrom statements that are definitive of the subject matter.  Should\neither of these optimistic views turn out to be correct, then the\nquestion of justification in mathematics would take on a particularly\nsimple form: Either a statement would be an axiom (in which case it\nwould be self-evident or definitive of the subject matter (depending\non the view under consideration)) or it would be derivable in\nfirst-order logic from some such statements. \n\nUnfortunately, these optimistic views came to be challenged in 1931 by\nGödel's incompleteness theorems.  Here is one version of the second\nincompleteness theorem: \n\nHere Con(PA) is a statement of arithmetic that expresses the informal\nstatement that PA is consistent.[1]\nUnder slightly stronger assumptions (for\nexample, that PA is Σ01-sound[2]) one can\nstrengthen the conclusion by adding that PA does not prove\n¬Con(PA); in other words, under this stronger assumption,\nCon(PA) is independent of PA.  Thus, we have here a\ncase of a statement of arithmetic (and, in fact, a very simple one)\nthat cannot be settled on the basis of the standard axioms.  Moreover,\nthe theorem is completely general—it holds not just for PA but\nfor any sufficiently strong formal system T. \n\nThis raises a challenge for the two aforementioned optimistic views\nconcerning the nature of mathematical truth.  To begin with it shows\nthat we cannot work with a fixed axiom system T.  We will\nalways need to introduce new axioms.  More importantly, it raises the\nquestion of how one is to justify these new axioms, for as one\ncontinues to add stronger and stronger axioms the claim that they are\neither self-evident or definitive of the subject matter will grow\nincreasingly more difficult to defend. \n\nAlready in 1931 Gödel pointed out a natural way to justify new\naxioms.  He pointed out that if one moves beyond the natural numbers\nand climbs the hierarchy of types (the sets of natural numbers, the\nsets of sets of natural numbers, etc.) one arrives at axioms (the\naxioms of second-order arithmetic PA2, the axioms of third-order\narithmetic PA3, etc.) that settle the undecided statements that he\ndiscovered.  The axiom system for the second level, PA2, settles\nthe statement left undecided at the first level, namely Con(PA);\nin fact, PA2 proves Con(PA), which is the desired result.  But\nnow we have a problem at the second level.  For the second\nincompleteness theorem shows that (under similar background\nassumptions to those above) PA2 does not settle Con(PA2).\nFortunately, the axiom system for the third level, PA3, settles\nthe statement left undecided at the second level, namely\nCon(PA2).  This pattern continues.  For every problem there is a\nsolution and for every solution there is a new problem.  In this way,\nby climbing the hierarchy of types one arrives at systems that\nsuccessively settle the consistency statements that arise along the\nway. \n\nThe above hierarchy of types can be recast in the uniform setting of\nset theory.  The set-theoretic hierarchy is defined inductively by\nstarting with the emptyset, taking the powerset at successor stages\nα+1, and taking the union at limit levels λ: \n\nThe universe of sets V is the union of all such stages:\nV=∪α∈OnVα,\nwhere On is the class of ordinals.  The first infinite level\nVω consists of all of the hereditarily finite sets[3]\nand this level satisfies ZFC-Infinity.\nThe sets at this level can be coded by natural numbers and in this way\none can show that PA and ZFC-Infinity are mutually\ninterpretable.[4]\nThe second infinite level Vω+1 is\nessentially P(ℕ) (or, equivalently, ℝ) and this\nlevel satisfies (a theory that is mutually interpretable with)\nPA2.  The third infinite level\nVω+2 is essentially P(P(ℕ)) (or, equivalently,\nas the set of functions of real numbers) and this level satisfies (a\ntheory that is mutually interpretable with) PA3.  The first three\ninfinite levels thus encompass arithmetic, analysis and functional\nanalysis and therewith most of standard mathematics.  In this fashion,\nthe hierarchy of sets and associated set-theoretic systems encompasses\nthe objects and systems of standard mathematics. \n\nNow, should it turn out to be the case that the consistency sentences\n(and the other, related sentences discovered by Gödel in 1931) were\nthe only instances of undecidable statements, then the\nsequence of systems in the above hierarchy would catch every problem\nthat arises.  And although we would never have a single system\nthat gave us a complete axiomatization of mathematical truth, we would\nhave a series of systems that collectively covered the\ntotality of mathematical truths. \n\nUnfortunately, matters were not to be so simple.  The trouble is that\nwhen one climbs the hierarchy of sets in this fashion the greater\nexpressive resources that become available lead to more intractable\ninstances of undecidable sentences and this is true already of the\nsecond and third infinite levels.  For example, at the second infinite\nlevel one can formulate the statement PM (that all projective sets\nare Lebesgue measurable) and at the third infinite level one can\nformulate CH (Cantor's continuum hypothesis).[5]\n  These statements were intensively investigated during the early era\nof set theory but little progress was made.  The explanation was\nultimately provided by the subsequent independence techniques of\nGödel and Cohen. \n\nGödel invented (in 1938) the method of inner models by\ndefining the minimal inner model L.  This model is defined just as\nV is defined except that at successor stages instead of taking the\nfull powerset of the previous stage one takes the definable powerset of the previous stage, where for a given set\nX the definable powerset Def(X) of X is the set of all\nsubsets of X that are definable over X with parameters from X: \n\nThe inner model L is the union of all such stages:\nL\n= ∪α∈OnLα. Gödel\nshowed that L satisfies (arbitrarily large fragments of) ZFC\nalong with CH.  It follows that ZFC cannot refute CH. Cohen\ncomplemented this result by inventing (in 1963) the method\nof forcing (or outer models). Given a complete\nBoolean algebra B he defined a model\nVB and showed that ¬CH holds in VB.[6]\nThis had the consequence that\nZFC could not prove CH.  Thus, these results together showed\nthat CH is independent of ZFC.  Similar results hold for PM\nand a host of other questions in set theory. \n\nThese instances of independence are more intractable in that no simple\niteration of the hierarchy of types leads to their resolution.  They\nled to a more profound search for new axioms. \n\nOnce again Gödel provided the first steps in the search for new\naxioms.  In 1946 he proposed as new axioms large cardinal\n  axioms—axioms of infinity that assert that there are very large\nlevels of the hierarchy of types—and he went so far as\nto entertain a generalized completeness theorem for such axioms,\naccording to which all statements of set theory could be settled by\nsuch axioms (Gödel 1946, 151). \n\nThe purpose of the remainder of this entry is to describe the nature\nof independence (along with the hierarchy of interpretability) and the\nconnection between independence and large cardinal axioms.  \n\n \n\nFurther Reading: For more on the incompleteness\ntheorems see Smoryński (1977), Buss (1998a), and\nLindström (2003).  For more on the independence techniques in\nset theory see Jech (2003) and Kunen (1980). \n\nOur aim is to investigate the space of mathematical theories\n(construed as recursively enumerable axiom systems).  The ordering on\nthe space of such theories that we will consider is that\nof interpretability.  The informal notion of interpretability\nis ubiquitous in mathematics; for example, Poincaré provided an\ninterpretation of two dimensional hyperbolic geometry in the Euclidean\ngeometry of the unit circle; Dedekind provided an interpretation of\nanalysis in set theory; and Gödel provided an interpretation of\nthe theory of formal syntax in arithmetic. \n\nWe shall use a precise formal regimentation of this informal notion.\nLet T1 and T2 be recursively enumerable axiom systems.  We say\nthat T1 is interpretable in T2 (T1 ≤ T2) when,\nroughly speaking, there is a translation τ from the language of\nT1 to the language of T2 such that, for each sentence φ of\nthe language of T1, if T1⊢φ then\n T2⊢τ(φ).[7]\nWe shall write T1 < T2 when T1≤\nT2 and T2≰ T1 and we shall write T1≡ T2 when both\nT1≤ T2 and T2≤ T1.  In the latter case, T1 and T2\nare said to be mutually interpretable.  The equivalence class of\nall theories mutually interpretable with T is called the interpretability degree of T. \n\nFor ease of exposition we shall make three simplifying assumptions\nconcerning the theories under consideration.  First, we shall assume\nthat all of our theories are couched in the language of set theory.\nThere is no loss of generality in this assumption since every theory\nis mutually interpretable with a theory in this language.  For\nexample, as noted earlier, PA and ZFC-Infinity are mutually\ninterpretable.  Second, we shall assume that all of our theories\ncontain ZFC-Infinity.  Third, we shall assume that all of our\ntheories are Σ01-sound. \n\nThe interpretability hierarchy is the collection of all\ntheories (satisfying our three simplifying assumptions) ordered under\nthe relation ≤. We now turn to a discussion of the structure of\nthis hierarchy. \n\nTo begin with, there is a useful characterization of the relation\n≤.  Let us write T1 ⊆ Π01T2 to indicate that every\nΠ01-statement provable in T1 is also provable in T2.  A\ncentral result in the theory of interpretability is that (granting our\nsimplifying assumptions) T1≤ T2 iff T1 ⊆ Π01T2.\nIt follows from this characterization and the second incompleteness\ntheorem that for any theory T the theory T + Con(T) is strictly\nstronger than T, that is, \n T < T + Con(T).  Moreover, it follows\nfrom the arithmetized completeness theorem that the theory\nT + ¬Con(T) is interpretable in T, hence,\nT ≡ T + ¬Con(T). \n\nIn terms of interpretability there are three possible ways in which a\nstatement φ can be independent of a theory T. \n\nIt turns out that each of these possibilities is realized.  For the\nfirst it suffices to take the Π01-sentence Con(T).  For the\nsecond it is easy to see that there is no example that is Π01;\nthe simplest possible complexity of such a sentence is Δ02\nand it turns out that there are such examples; examples of this type\nof independence are called Orey sentences.  For the third kind\nof independence there are Π01 instances.  (This is a corollary\nof Lemma 14 on pages 128–129 of Lindström (2003).) \n\nThese are all metamathematical examples, the kind of example that only\na logician would construct.  It is natural to ask whether there are\n“natural” examples, roughly the sort of example occurring in the\nnormal course of mathematics.  In the set theoretic case, such\nexamples are abundant for the first two cases.  For example, PM is\nan example of the first kind of independence and CH is an example\nof the second kind of independence.  There are no known “natural”\nexamples of the third kind of independence.  In the arithmetical case,\nsuch examples are rare.  There are examples of the first kind of\nindependence (the most famous of which is a classic example due to\nParis and Harrington) but none of the second or third kind of\nindependence. \n\nNotice that in the case of the third example the two theories above\nT are incomparable in the interpretability order.  To construct a\npair of such Π01-statements one uses a reciprocal form of the\ndiagonal lemma to construct two Π01-statements that refer to one\nanother.  Using such techniques can show that the interpretability\norder is quite complex.  For example, for any two theories T1 and\nT2 such that T1 < T2 there is a third theory T such that\nT1 < T < T2.  Thus, the order on the degrees of interpretability is\nneither linearly ordered nor well-founded.  (See Feferman (1960).) \n\nRemarkably, it turns out that when one restricts to those theories\nthat “arise in nature” the interpretability ordering is quite\nsimple: There are no descending chains and there are no incomparable\nelements—the interpretability ordering on theories that “arise in\nnature” is a wellordering.  In particular, although there are natural\nexamples of the first and second kind of independence (e.g. PM and\nCH, respectively, something to which we will return to below),\nthere are no known natural examples of the third kind of independence. \n\nSo, for theories that “arise in nature”, we have a wellordered\nhierarchy under the interpretability ordering.  At the base of the\nordering one has the degree that is represented by our minimal theory\nZFC-Infinity and there is only one way to proceed, namely, upward\nin terms of strength. \n\nWe have already seen one way of climbing the hierarchy of the degrees\nof interpretability, namely, by adding consistency statements.  There\nare two drawbacks to this approach.  First, if one starts with a\ntheory that “arises in nature” and adds the consistency statement\none lands in a degree that has no known representative that “arises\nin nature”.  Second, the consistency statement does not take one very\nfar up the hierarchy.  Both of these drawbacks are remedied by a very\nnatural class of axioms—the large cardinal axioms. \n\nFurther Reading: For more on the structure of the\ninterpretability hierarchy see chapters 6–8 of Lindström\n(2003). \n\nLet Z0 be the theory ZFC-Infinity-Replacement.  (This theory\nis logically equivalent to our base theory ZFC-Infinity.) We\nshall successively strengthen Z0 by reflectively adding axioms that\nassert certain levels of the universe of sets exist. \n\nThe standard model of Z0 is Vω.  The Axiom of Infinity (in\none formulation) simply asserts that this set exists.  So, when we add\nthe Axiom of Infinity, the resulting theory Z1 (known as Zermelo\nset theory with Choice) not only proves the consistency of Z0; it\nproves that there is a standard model of Z0.  Now the standard\nmodel of Z1 is Vω+ω.  The Axiom of Replacement\nimplies that this set exists.  So, when we add the Axiom of\nReplacement, the resulting theory Z2 (known as ZFC), not only\nproves the consistency of Z1; it proves that there is a standard\nmodel of Z1. \n\nA standard model of Z2 has the\nform Vκ where κ is a regular cardinal\nsuch that for all α < κ, 2α <\nκ.  Such a cardinal is called a\n(strongly) inaccessible cardinal.  The next axiom in\nthe hierarchy under consideration is the statement asserting that such\na cardinal exists.  The resulting theory \n ZFC + “There is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal” proves that there is a level of\nthe universe that satisfies ZFC.  Continuing in this fashion one\narrives at stronger and stronger axioms that assert the existence of\nlarger and larger levels of the universe of sets.  Before continuing\nwith an outline of such axioms let us first draw the connection with\nthe hierarchy of interpretability. \n\nRecall our classification of the three types of independence.  We\nnoted that there are no known natural examples of the third kind of\nindependence but that there are natural examples of the first and\nsecond kind of independence. \n\nNatural examples of the second kind of independence are provided by\nthe dual method of inner and outer models.  For example, these methods\nshow that the theories ZFC+CH and ZFC+ ¬CH are mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC, that is, all three theories lie in the same\ndegree.  In other words, CH is an Orey sentence with respect to\nZFC.  What about that other sentence we introduced: PM? \n\nUsing the method of inner models Gödel showed that ¬PM holds\nin L.  It follows that ZFC+ ¬PM is mutually interpretable with\nZFC.  But what about PM?  To show that ZFC+PM is mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC a natural approach would be to follow the\napproach used for CH and build an outer model of ZFC that\nsatisfies PM.  However, it is known that this cannot be done\nstarting with ZFC alone.  For it turns out (by a result of\nShelah (1984)) that ZFC+PM implies the consistency of\nZFC and this implies, by the second incompleteness theorem, that\nZFC+PM is not interpretable in ZFC.  In a sense we have here a\ncase of the independence of independence.  More precisely, even if we\nassume that ZFC is consistent we cannot (in contrast to the case of\nCH) prove that PM is independent of ZFC.  To establish the\nindependence of PM from ZFC we need to assume the consistency of\na stronger theory, namely, that of \n ZFC + “There is a strongly inaccessible\ncardinal”.  For it turns out that ZFC+PM lies not in the\ninterpretability degree of ZFC but rather in that\nof ZFC + “There is a strongly\ninaccessible cardinal”.  To summarize: While CH is a case of the\nsecond type independence, PM is a case of the first type independence;\nit is similar to Con(ZFC) in that it is a sentence φ such that\nonly one of φ or ¬φ leads to a jump in strength, only now\nthere are two differences; the jump lands in a degree that is much\nstronger and it is represented by a natural theory. \n\nIn general, the (known) sentences of set theory are either like CH\nor PM.  Some are like CH in that both ZFC+φ and\nZFC+ ¬φ lie in the degree of ZFC.  Others are like PM in\nthat one of ZFC+φ and ZFC+ ¬φ lies in the degree of\nZFC while the other lies in the degree of an extension of ZFC\nvia a large cardinal axiom. \n\nLet us now return to our overview of large cardinal axioms.  After\nstrongly inaccessible cardinals there are Mahlo cardinals,\nindescribable cardinals, and ineffable cardinals.  All of these large\ncardinal axioms can be derived in a uniform way using the traditional\nvariety of reflection principles (see Tait 2005) but there\nare limitations on how far this variety of reflection principles can\ntake one.  For under a very general characterization of such\nprinciples it is known that they cannot yield the Erdős cardinal\nκ(ω).  See Koellner (2009). \n\nThe large cardinals considered thus far (including κ(ω))\nare known as small large cardinals.  A large cardinal is small if the associated large cardinal axiom can hold in\nGödel's constructible universe L, that is, if \n “V ⊨ κ is a\nφ-cardinal” is consistent, then \n “L ⊨ κ is a\nφ-cardinal” is consistent.  Otherwise the large cardinal is large. \n\nThere is a simple template for formulating (large) large cardinal\naxioms is in terms of elementary embeddings.  In general such an axiom\nasserts that there is a transitive class M and a non-trivial\nelementary embedding \n\nTo say that the embedding is non-trivial is just to say that it is not\nthe identity, in which case there must be a least ordinal that is\nmoved.  This ordinal is called the critical point of j and\ndenoted crit(j).  The critical point is (typically) the large\ncardinal associated with the embedding.  A cardinal κ is said to be\nmeasurable iff it is the critical point of some such\nembedding.[8] \n\nIt is easy to see that for any such\nembedding Vκ+1⊆ M where\nκ = crit(j).  This amount of agreement enables one to\nshow that κ is strongly inaccessible, Mahlo, indescribable,\nineffable, etc.  To illustrate this let us assume that we have shown\nthat κ is strongly inaccessible and let us show that κ has\nmuch stronger large cardinal properties.  Since κ is strongly\ninaccessible in V and since\n(Vκ+1)M\n=Vκ+1, M also thinks that κ\nis strongly inaccessible.  In particular, M thinks that there\nis a strongly inaccessible cardinal (namely, κ)\nbelow j(κ).  But then by the elementarity of\nj, V must think the same thing of the preimage of\nj(κ), namely, κ, that is, V must think that\nthere is a strongly inaccessible below κ.  So κ cannot\nbe the least strongly inaccessible cardinal.  Continuing in this\nmanner one can show that there are many strongly inaccessibles below\nκ and, in fact, that κ is Mahlo, indescribable,\nineffable, etc.  So measurable cardinals subsume the small large\ncardinals. \n\nIn fact, Scott showed that (in contrast to the small large cardinals)\nmeasurable cardinals cannot exist in Gödel's constructible universe.\nLet us be precise about this.  Let V=L be the statement that\nasserts that all sets are constructible.  Then for each small large\ncardinal axiom φ (to be precise, those listed above) if the\ntheory ZFC+φ is consistent then so is the theory\nZFC+φ+V=L.  In contrast, the theory ZFC + “There is a\nmeasurable cardinal” proves ¬V=L.  This may seem somewhat\ncounterintuitive since L contains all of the ordinals and so if κ\nis a measurable cardinal then κ is an ordinal in L.  The point is\nthat L cannot “recognize” that κ is a measurable cardinal since\nit is too “thin” to contain the ultrafilter that witnesses the\nmeasurability of κ. \n\nOne way to strengthen a large cardinal axiom based on the above\ntemplate is to demand greater agreement between M and V.  For\nexample, if one demands that Vκ+2⊆ M then the fact that\nκ is measurable (something witnessed by a subset of P(κ))\ncan be recognized by M.  And so, by exactly the same argument that\nwe used above, there must be a measurable cardinal below κ. \n\nThis leads to a progression of increasingly strong large cardinal\naxioms.  It will be useful to discuss some of the major stepping\nstones in this hierarchy. \n\nIf κ is a cardinal and η>κ is an ordinal then\nκ is η-strong if there is a transitive\nclass M and a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: V → M such that crit(j)=κ,\nj(κ)>η\nand Vη⊆ M.  A cardinal κ\nis strong iff it is η-strong for all η>κ.\nOne can also demand that the embedding preserve certain classes:\nIf A is a class, κ is a cardinal, and η>κ\nis an ordinal then κ is η-A-strong if\nthere exists a j: V → M which witnesses that κ\nis η-strong and which has the additional feature that\nj(A ∩ Vκ)\n∩ Vη = A\n∩ Vη.  The following large cardinal notion\nplays a central role in the search for new axioms. \n\nOne can obtain stronger large cardinal axioms by forging a link\nbetween the embedding j and the amount of resemblance between M\nand V.  For example, a cardinal κ is superstrong if there\nis a transitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: V → M such that crit(j)=κ and \n Vj(κ)⊆ M.  If κ is\nsuperstrong then κ is a Woodin cardinal and there are arbitrarily\nlarge Woodin cardinals below κ.  \n\nOne can also obtain strong large cardinal axioms by placing closure\nconditions on the target model M.  For example, letting γ ≥ κ a\ncardinal κ is γ-supercompact if there is a\ntransitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding j: V → M\nsuch that crit(j)=κ and γM⊆ M, that is, M is closed\nunder γ-sequences.  (It is straightforward to see that if M is\nclosed under γ-sequences then H(γ+)⊆ M; so this approach\nsubsumes the previous approach.) A cardinal κ is supercompact if it is γ-supercompact for all γ ≥ κ.  Now,\njust as in the previous approach, one can strengthen these axioms by\nforging a link between the embedding j and the closure conditions on\nthe target model.  A cardinal κ is n-huge if there is\na transitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding j:V →\nM such that j n(κ)M ⊆ M, where κ=crit(j) and\nj i+1(κ) is defined to be j(j i(κ)).  \n\nOne can continue in this vein, demanding greater agreement between M\nand V.  The ultimate axiom in this direction would, of course,\ndemand that M = V.  This axiom was proposed by Reinhardt and shortly\nthereafter shown to be inconsistent (in ZFC) by Kunen.  In fact,\nKunen showed that, assuming ZFC, there can be a transitive class\nM and a non-trivial elementary\nembedding j: V → M such that\nj ‘‘ λ ∈ M, where \n λ=supn < ω j n(κ) and\nκ=crit(j).  In particular, there cannot exists such\nan M and\nj such that Vλ+1⊆ M.  This placed a limit on the\namount of closure of the target model (in relation to the\nembedding).[10] \n\nNevertheless, there is a lot of room below the above upper bound.  For\nexample, a very strong axiom is the statement that there is a\nnon-trivial elementary embedding j:Vλ+1→ Vλ+1.  The\nstrongest large cardinal axiom in the current literature is the axiom\nasserting that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: L(Vλ+1)→ L(Vλ+1) such that crit(j)<λ.  In recent\nwork, Woodin has discovered axioms much stronger than this. \n\nFurther Reading: For more on large cardinal axioms\nsee Kanamori (2003). \n\nThe large cardinal axioms discussed above are naturally well-ordered\nin terms of strength.[11]\nThis provides a natural way of climbing the hierarchy of\ninterpretability.  At the base we start with the theory\nZFC-Infinity and then we climb to ZFC and up through\nZFC+Φ for various large cardinal axioms Φ.  Notice that for\ntwo large cardinal axioms Φ and Ψ, if Ψ is stronger\nthan Φ then Ψ implies that there is a standard model of\nΦ and so we have a natural interpretation of ZFC+Φ in\nZFC+Ψ. \n\nWe have already noted that ZFC+¬PM is mutually interpretable\nwith ZFC+LC where LC is the large cardinal axiom “There is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal” and that this is shown using the dual\ntechniques of inner and outer model theory.  It is a remarkable\nempirical fact that for any “natural” statement in the\nlanguage of set theory φ one can generally find a large cardinal\naxiom Φ such that ZFC+φ and ZFC+Φ are mutually\ninterpretable.  Again, this is established using the dual techniques\nof inner and outer model theory only now large cardinals enter the\nmix.  To establish that ZFC+Φ interprets ZFC+φ one\ngenerally starts with a model of ZFC+Φ and uses forcing to\nconstruct a model of ZFC+φ.  In many cases the forcing\nconstruction involves “collapsing” the large cardinal associated\nwith Φ and arranging the collapse in such a way that φ holds\nin the “rubble”.  In the other direction, one generally starts with\na model of ZFC+φ and then constructs an inner model (a model\nresembling L but able to accommodate large cardinal axioms) that\ncontains the large cardinal asserted to exist by Φ. The branch of\nset theory known as inner model theory is devoted to the\nconstruction of such “L-like” models for stronger and stronger\nlarge cardinal axioms. \n\nIn this way the theories of the form ZFC+LC, where LC is a large\ncardinal axiom, provide a yardstick for measuring the strength of\ntheories.  They also act as intermediaries for comparing theories\nfrom conceptually distinct domains: Given ZFC+φ and ZFC+ψ\none finds large cardinal axioms Φ and Ψ such that (using\nthe methods of inner and outer models) ZFC+φ and ZFC+Φ are\nmutually interpretable and ZFC+ψ and ZFC+Ψ are mutually\ninterpretable.  One then compares ZFC+φ and ZFC+ψ (in terms\nof interpretability) by mediating through the natural interpretability\nrelationship between ZFC+Φ and ZFC+Ψ.  So large\ncardinal axioms (in conjunction with the dual method of inner and outer\nmodels) lie at the heart of the remarkable empirical fact that\nnatural theories from completely distinct domains can be compared in\nterms of interpretability. \n\nThe main question that arises in light of the independence results is\nwhether one can justify new axioms that settle the statements left\nundecided by the standard axioms.  There are two views.  On the first\nview, the answer is taken to be negative and one embraces a radical\nform of pluralism in which one has a plethora of equally legitimate\nextensions of the standard axioms.  On the second view, the answer is\ntaken (at least in part) to be affirmative, and the results simply\nindicate that ZFC is too weak to capture the mathematical truths.\nThis topic is quite involved and lies outside the scope of the present\narticle.  \n\n \n\nBut there are other philosophical questions more directly related to\nthe themes of this article.  First, what is the significance of the\nempirical fact that the large cardinal axioms appear to be wellordered\nunder interpretability?  Second, what is the significance of the\nempirical fact that large cardinal axioms play a central role in\ncomparing many theories from conceptually distinct domains?  Let us\nconsider these two questions in turn. \n\nOne might try to argue that the fact that the large cardinal axioms\nare wellordered under interpretability is a consideration in their\nfavour.  However, this would be a weak argument.  For, as we have\nnoted above, all “natural” theories appear to be wellordered\nunder interpretability and this includes theories that are\nincompatible with one another.  For example, it is straightforward to\nselect “natural” theories from higher and higher degrees of theories\nin the wellordered sequence that are incompatible with one another.\nIt follows that the feature of being wellordered under\ninterpretability, while remarkable, can not be a point in favour of\ntruth. \n\nBut large cardinal axioms have additional features that singles them\nout from the class of natural theories in the wellordered sequence of\ndegrees.  To begin with they provide the most natural way to climb the\nhierarchy of interpretability—they are the simplest and most natural\nmanifestation of pure mathematical strength.  But more important is\nthe second component mentioned above, namely, the large cardinal\naxioms act as intermediaries in comparing theories from conceptually\ndistinct domains.  For recall how this works: Given ZFC+φ and\nZFC+ψ one finds large cardinal axioms Φ and Ψ such\nthat (using the methods of inner and outer models) ZFC+φ and\nZFC+Φ are mutually interpretable and ZFC+ψ and ZFC+Ψ\nare mutually interpretable.  One then compares ZFC+φ and\nZFC+ψ (in terms of interpretability) by mediating through the\nnatural interpretability relationship between ZFC+Φ and\nZFC+Ψ. \n\nIt turns out that in many cases this is the only known way to\ncompare ZFC+φ and ZFC+ψ, that is, in many cases there is\nno direct interpretation in either direction, instead one must\n  pass through the large cardinal axioms.  Can this additional\nfeature be used to make a case for large cardinal axioms?  The answer\nis unclear.  However, what is clear is the absolute centrality of\nlarge cardinal axioms in set theory.","contact.mail":"koellner@fas.harvard.edu","contact.domain":"fas.harvard.edu"}]
