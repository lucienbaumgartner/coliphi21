The most striking aspect of his\nheritage is the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of a comprehensive\ntreatise on magic and occult arts, De occulta philosophia libri\ntres (Three Books on Occult Philosophy), written in\n1510, but then reworked, substantially enlarged, and finally published\nin 1533, and a rigorous refutation of all products of human reason,\nDe incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et artium atque\nexcellentia verbi Dei declamatio invectiva (On the\nUncertainty and Vanity of the Arts and Sciences: An Invective\nDeclamation), printed in 1530. Esoteric literature and\ninquisitorial handbooks invariably quoted Agrippa, the celebrated (or\nexecrated) Archimagus; bibliographies on skepticism granted\nhim a long lasting, but not entirely deserved, reputation as one\n“who professed to overturn all the science” (Naudé\n1644: 44–45). Actually, both works, as well as all of\nAgrippa’s other writings, are clearly defined moments in a\nbroader philosophical, religious, and moral meditation on the social\nsignificance of learning in his own time. The “paradox”\nwith which Agrippa challenges his readers lies precisely in the\nsimultaneous presence of two speculative concerns, which are scattered\nin different texts, but which express, in spite of their apparent\ninconsistency, a complex cultural and religious project. De\nvanitate performs the epistemological function of the pars\ndestruens, identifying the causes and the historical\nresponsibilities for the general spiritual wreckage of Christian\nsociety, and introducing the proposal contained in the pars\nconstruens. De occulta philosophia, recovering\n“true magic” in the framework of Neoplatonic metaphysics\nand Hermetic theology, offers humankind a wonder-working knowledge,\none which is able to restore human cognitive and practical\ncapacities.\n\n\nIn order to understand the internal coherence of Agrippa’s\nintellectual journey, his entire oeuvre has to be taken into\naccount. The task is made more difficult because of his specific\nwriting strategy, which entailed hiding his true purposes beneath a\nmound of borrowed material and erratic juxtapositions. This style of\nthought and exposition requires Agrippa’s readers to piece\ntogether his “scattered meaning” (dispersa\nintentio) and to search for the theoretical message which is\nknowingly concealed within an unsystematic exposition. The literary\ntechnique of spreading knowledge in disguise, typical of the\nsapiential tradition, turned out to be increasingly important for most\nRenaissance intellectuals, who were “forced to create spaces for\nthemselves by merging learning with prophecy” (Celenza 2001:\n128). In addition, Agrippa composed his texts by gathering a wide\nrange of concepts and quotations from ancient and contemporary\nsources, which were removed from their original context and\nre-composed in a new explanatory structure. Such a way of\nde-constructing and re-constructing his cultural models should be\nconsidered in the light of Agrippa’s ideological program. By\n“re-writing” his sources, he uncovered presuppositions and\nimplications, which the sources themselves often left unsaid, and he\nconnected together, in a single coherent design, arguments and points\nof view which remained separate in contemporary discussions. In this\nway, he added a “political” meaning to the new text which\nwas not present in the purely cultural or religious critique put\nforward by his sources. This emphasis on the civic function of\nphilosophy can be regarded as the most characteristic and\n“original” element in Agrippa’s works.\n\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa was born on 14 September 1486 in Cologne.\nHe matriculated at the University of Cologne in 1499 and graduated in\n1502. The degree in medicine which he claimed to have earned was ruled\nout by Prost (1882: 67–74), who also raised serious doubts about\nhis doctorates in Canon and Civil Law (in utroque iure).\nNauert (1965: 10–11), however, suggested that they might have\nbeen obtained during the two periods of his life about which we have\nvery little information: 1502–1507 and 1511–1518. Agrippa\ncame into contact with the school of Albertus Magnus at Cologne, where\nit was still a living tradition and where he pursed his interest in\nnatural philosophy, encountering the Historia naturalis\n(Natural History) of Pliny the Elder for the first time.\nAndreas Canter, the city poet of Cologne, probably introduced him to\nLullism—later, Agrippa wrote a long commentary, printed at\nCologne in 1531, on Lull’s Ars magna (Great\nArt). During his youthful studies, Agrippa also established\npersonal relationships with those German humanists who shared his\ninterest in ancient wisdom. He spent a short period in Paris, where he\nmight have been a student. With some French friends, he formed a\nsodalitium, a sort of secret circle or initiatory\nbrotherhood, which, according the collection of letters from and to\nAgrippa, included Charles de Bovelles (c. 1479–1533), Symphorien\nChampier (c. 1471–1539), Germain de Brie (c. 1489–1538),\nGermain de Ganay (d. 1520), the portraitist at the French court Jean\nPerréal (c. 1455–1530), and an unknown Italian friend,\nLandulfus. Between 1508 and 1509, Agrippa undertook a mysterious\njourney to Spain, seemingly engaged in a military mission. In 1509 he\nwas charged with a course of lectures on Johannes Reuchlin’s\nDe verbo mirifico (On the Wonder-Working Word) at\nthe University of Dôle in Burgundy. This academic appointment\nhad been supported by the chancellor of the university, Archbishop\nAntoine de Vergy. In the inaugural lecture, Agrippa pronounced a\nprolusion in honor of the daughter of Emperor Maximilian, Margaret of\nAustria, Princess of Austria and Burgundy. He planned to develop the\nspeech into a more comprehensive treatise in praise of womankind,\ndedicating it to Margaret. Therefore, he began to draft, but perhaps\ndid not finish, his celebrated De nobilitate et praecellentia\nfoeminei sexus declamatio (Declamation on the Nobility and\nPre-Eminence of the Female Sex), which was published only in\n1529. Agrippa’s teaching on Christian kabbalah attracted\nconsiderable interest among the members of the university and of the\nlocal Parlement, and he joined the collegium of\ntheologians. Unfortunately, not everyone had a benevolent attitude to\nwhat sounded like an attempt to spread the “most criminal,\ncondemned and prohibited art of kabbalah”\n(Expostulatio, p. 494) in Christian schools. The Franciscan\nJean Catilinet, the provincial superior for Burgundy, preaching in the\npresence of Margaret at the court of Low Countries in Ghent, denounced\nAgrippa as a “judaizing heretic” (ibidem). This\ncharge put an end to Agrippa’s teaching career in Dôle and\ndashed his hopes of obtaining Margaret’s favor. Returning to\nGermany, in the winter of 1509–1510 Agrippa went to the\nmonastery of St. Jacob at Würzburg to meet Johannes Trithemius,\nAbbot of Sponheim. Over the course of a few intense days, the famous\nabbot and his young visitor discussed a topic of mutual interest:\nnatural magic and its role in contemporary culture. The meeting had a\ncrucial impact on Agrippa. He quickly finished a compendium\non magic, which he had been working on for some time. The first draft\nof De occulta philosophia was dedicated to Trithemius, who\nreceived the manuscript shortly before 8 April 1510 and generously\npraised Agrippa’s commitment. The book circulated in manuscript,\nas evidence from Agrippa’s correspondence shows; but he\ncontinued to assemble materials in order to revise this first draft.\nThis aim was achieved only twenty years later. \nIn London, where he had gone in 1510 to carry out a political and\n“very secret assignment” (occultissimum negotium,\nDefensio, F. B6), probably on the orders of Emperor\nMaximilian, he became familiar with John Colet, who introduced him to\nthe study of St. Paul’s epistles. Agrippa wrote\nCommentariola (Little Commentaries) on the Epistle\nto the Romans, which he then lost in Italy and recovered only in 1523,\nbut which remain totally unknown to us. During his stay in London,\nAgrippa replied to Catilinet’s accusations with a polemical\nExpostulatio super Expositione sua in librum De verbo mirifico cum\nJoanne Catilineti (Expostulation with Jean Catilinet over His\nExposition of the Book On the Wonder-Working Word)—just the\nfirst in a series of countless epic battles between him and\ncontemporary scholastic theologians. From 1511 to 1518, Agrippa was in\nItaly, serving Maximilian, but his military duties did not prevent him\nfrom pursuing his philosophical interests. He lectured on\nPlato’s Symposium (Convivium) and on the\nHermetic Pimander (that is, the Corpus Hermeticum)\nat the University of Pavia, in 1512 and 1515 respectively. He probably\nbelieved that he might be able to achieve his academic ambitions\nthere, but his fervent expectations were soon disappointed. After the\ndefeat of the Swiss and Imperial troops at Marignano (13–14\nSeptember 1515), he was forced to quit teaching and to abandon Pavia.\nHe then sought patronage at the court of William IX Paleologus,\nMarquis of Monferrato, to whom he promptly dedicated two little works,\nDe homine (On Humankind) and De triplici ratione\ncognoscendi Deum (On the Threefold Way of Knowing God),\ngathering together some notes and materials he had already organized\nor perhaps even prepared for press, in Pavia. Both works attest to the\nimportance of Agrippa’s contact with early sixteenth-century\nItalian culture. During his stay in Italy, he joined a network of\nfriends and correspondents, who allowed him to deepen his knowledge of\nNeoplatonic and Hermetic literature, to sharpen his acquaintance with\nkabbalistic texts, and to broaden and update his bibliographical\ninformation. For a time he was in Turin, where he lectured on\ntheological topics. \nIn the following years, Agrippa was in Metz (1518–1520), as the\ncity orator and advocate (advocatus), in Geneva\n(1521–1523), where he practiced medicine, and, finally in\nFreiburg (until 1524), as the city physician. Throughout this period,\nhe came into contact with a number of humanists who were engaging with\nthe new religious ideas circulating at the time. Therefore, his\nreputation as an “occult philosopher” assumed more complex\naspects. His De originali peccato declamatio (Declamation\non Original Sin), written in 1518 but not printed until 1529,\npuzzled the dedicatee, Dietrich Wichwael, Bishop of Cyrene, and\nAgrippa’s friend Claude Dieudonné with regard to his\ninterpretation of Adam’s sin as consisting in the sexual act. In\nMetz, he was involved in the debate on St. Anne’s triple\nmarriage, expressing his passionate support for Jacques Lefèvre\nd’Étaples’ criticism of the popular legend that\nattributed three husbands and three daughters to her. In De\nBeatissimae Annae monogamia ac unico puerperio (On St.\nAnne’s Monogamy and Sole Childbirth, printed in Cologne,\n1534), he gave a fierce reply to the accusations of heresy leveled at\nLefèvre (and at himself) by three conservative monks. The\ndefense was vehement and strongly sarcastic: no wonder Lefèvre\nd’Étaples reacted anxiously to Agrippa’s promise to\nbecome his ally. Meanwhile, Agrippa had successfully defended a woman\nof Woippy who was accused of being a witch, saving her from the stake.\nThanks to these courageous positions and his intense relationships\nwith pre-Reform circles, Agrippa was gradually assuming a by no means\nsecondary role in the general movement against the scholastic\ntradition. He won the esteem of many scholars (some of them would\nlater on join the Reformation), but, at the same time, attracted the\nparticular attention of the religious authorities. \nIn spring of 1524 Agrippa moved to Lyon to take up the office of\nphysician to the French king’s mother, Louise of Savoy. He tried\nto win the favor of the king’s sister, Marguerite\nd’Alençon, by dedicating to her his declamation De\nsacramento matrimonii (On the Sacrament of Marriage,\n1526) in parallel Latin and French versions. Unfortunately, it was a\nblunder and a terrible failure. The princess (who had recently been\nwidowed) was already hostile to the Erasmian ‘spirit’,\nwhich Agrippa referred to in order to claim the lawfulness and benefit\nof second marriages. Furthermore, ecclesiastical authorities were able\nto recognize the influence of some Erasmus’ condemned works on\nAgrippa’s positive attitude towards marriage, as well as the\nlink which connected it to the treatise De sacro coniugio\n(On Holy Wedlock) of the Franciscan François Lambert,\nwho had fled to Strasbourg after joining the Reformation.\nAgrippa’s position at court was becoming worse. His friendships,\nhis sympathies for the work of humanist Reformers, his more and more\naggressive theses—in 1526 he reworked an earlier oration or\nletter, Dehortatio gentilis theologiae (Dissuasion from\nPagan Theology), in which he criticized contemporaries for their\nexcessive curiosity about Hermetic theology and their disregard for\nChristian education—were raising doubts his religious orthodoxy.\nHis correspondence with the Duke of Bourbon, who had betrayed the\nFrench Crown in order to side with the Emperor, called into question\nhis political loyalties, and he was suspected of involvement in a\nplot. His refusal to furnish an astrological prognostication for\nFrançois I and his incautious remarks about Louise’s\nsuperstition, which a friend passed on to her, sparked off her open\nhostility. Agrippa was stripped of his pension and forbidden to leave\nFrance. In the midst of such dramatic misadventures, he wrote his\nDe incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum. It was a biting\ncommentary on all human sciences and arts and a fierce attack on the\nmoral and social assumptions of his day. Agrippa subjected the work to\nlater revisions and enlargements, right up to the moment of\npublication, in 1530. \nWhen, at last, he was allowed to leave France, Agrippa accepted the\noffice of archivist and imperial historiographer at the court of\nMargaret of Austria, governor of the Low Countries, in Antwerp. He\nfinally dedicated himself to publishing his writings. In 1529 a\ncollection of his short treatises was printed in Antwerp by Michael\nHillenius, and in 1530 another Antwerp printer, Johannes Graphaeus,\nbrought out De vanitate. In 1531, Graphaeus also printed the\nenlarged version of Book I of De occulta philosophia,\ndedicated to Hermann von Wied, Archbishop Elector of Cologne\n(1477–1552), and the table of contents for Book II and III. Both\nDe vanitate and De occulta philosophia circulated\nwidely, thanks to further editions (in Antwerp, Cologne, and Paris),\nand once more Agrippa found himself in trouble with the religious\nauthorities. The Louvain theologians, questioned by Margaret of\nAustria herself, condemned De vanitate as scandalous, impious\nand heretical, and so did the Sorbonne with respect to the Paris\nedition. The Parlement at Mechelin was informed of the\nLouvain professors’ judgment, and required Agrippa to answer\ntheir accusations. He replied with two fearless writings, refuting,\npoint by point, the criticisms in his Apologia\n(Defense) and accusing, in turn, his opponents of ignorance\nand bad faith in his Querela (Complaint). These\nevents obviously put an end to Agrippa’s career at\nMargaret’s court, and he was once again seeking a new protector.\nHermann von Wied, who was both interested in occult sciences and\nsympathized with moderate religious reform, offered him protection\nand, in June 1532, brought him into his own household. Eventually,\nAgrippa was able to deliver the complete, final version of De\nocculta philosophia to the Cologne printer Johannes Soter, who in\nNovember was already typesetting it. Shortly before Christmas,\nhowever, the Dominican inquisitor Conrad Köllin denounced the\nbook as heretical and blasphemous, getting the city’s Senate to\nsuspend the printing. Agrippa’s impassioned and controversial\nappeal to the Cologne Senate (Zika 2003: 99–124) did not succeed\nin resolving the impasse. It was, instead, the forceful intervention\nof Hermann which enabled De occulta philosophia to appear,\neven though accompanied by an appendix including the chapters of\nDe vanitate which criticized magic. \nWe are not informed about the last years of Agrippa’s life,\nbecause his correspondence stops in July 1533. He was perhaps the\nauthor of a self-defense, Dialogus de vanitate scientiarum et\nruina Christianae religionis (Dialogue on the Vanity of the\nSciences and the Ruin of Christian Religion), fictitiously\nattributed to Godoschalcus Moncordius, an otherwise unknown Cistercian\nmonk, and printed, in all probability, by Johannes Soter in 1534\n(Zambelli 1965: 220–23). On 22 February 1534, from Bonn, Agrippa\naddressed a legal memorandum to the Parliament of the Low Countries\n(Zambelli 1965: 305–12). According to his pupil Johannes Wier\n(1515–1565), Agrippa was in Bonn until 1535. He then returned to\nFrance, where he was arrested on the order of François I.\nShortly after his release, he died in Grenoble in 1535 or, at the\nlatest, in 1536. \nDedicating to Trithemius his first attempt as a reformer of magic,\nAgrippa claimed to share the common desire for the renewal of a\n“sublime and sacred science”, perverted by having been\ndetached from its theoretical context and by being practiced with\nanti-natural means and intentions. Corrupted texts and inadequate\ncritical and philosophical awareness had made magic a convoluted\njumble of errors and obscurities, despised by the learned, mistrusted\nby the Church, and used with feckless irresponsibility by\nsuperstitious old witches. Instead, in its original and pure form,\nmagic was a sacred body of knowledge, providing the possibility of\nhuman dominion over all of created nature (elemental, celestial, and\nintellectual). \nBasically, the first draft of De occulta philosophia was\nstructured as a survey, which owed much to Marsilio Ficino’s\nDe vita (On Life), Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola’s Oratio (de dignitate hominis,\nOration [on the Dignity of Humankind]), and Johannes\nReuchlin’s De verbo mirifico. These authors had already\nendeavored to restore magic, distinguishing (from different\nperspectives and with different aims) between true and false magic,\nbetween philosophy and pseudo-philosophy, between the sacred and the\nsacrilegious. Agrippa’s program followed a slightly different\npath. For Giovanni Pico, magic was “the most perfect\naccomplishment of natural philosophy” (Oration, p.\n226). Instead, for Agrippa, it was “the most perfect\naccomplishment of the noblest philosophy” (totius\nnobilissimae philosophiae absoluta consummatio, I, 2, p. 86).\nThis definition had significant implications. Unlike his predecessors,\nAgrippa conceived of magic as a comprehensive knowledge, gathering\ntogether all the cognitive data collected in the various fields of\nhuman learning, and making explicit their potentials for acting on\nreality. Therefore, according to the three different levels of being,\nthere were three different operative areas to which magic applied,\nmaking it possible to distinguish three ‘forms’ of magic:\nnatural magic, astrological (and numerological) magic, and\n‘religious’ or ‘ceremonial’ magic, that is,\nthe kabbalistic and theurgic magic. All three forms are true and good,\nif properly practiced in the context of the reformed magic. This\nassessment highlighted that Agrippa had moved away from another of his\nsources. In De verbo mirifico, Johannes Reuchlin had proposed\na similar tripartite division in the “wonder-working art”\n(ars miraculorum), but he had also recognized the intrinsic\nrisks of each “form”. Magic based on physics (natural\nmagic) cannot be checked and is therefore limited in its powers. Magic\nbased on astrology is often false and confused. As far as ceremonial\nmagic is concerned, goetia, which relies on malign demons, is\nclearly superstitious; theurgy, which attempts to establish contact\nwith benign demons, is practicable in theory, but complicated and\ndangerous in practice. Therefore, Reuchlin favored a more reliable and\nefficacious alternative, a fourth way, called the “art of\nsoliloquy” (ars soliloquia), based on the use of the\nholy name of Christ. While sharing Reuchlin’s enthusiasm for\nthis thaumaturgic philosophy, Agrippa’s view was broader, also\nembracing Ficino’s astrological magic, Pico’s natural\nmagic, and Neoplatonic and Hermetic theurgic magic. The\nall-inclusiveness of his “restored” magic also allowed him\nto recover the legacy of the medieval tradition (of Albertus Magnus,\nabove all) and even to pay some attention to popular\nbeliefs—justifying them within a Neoplatonic conceptual\nframework. \nIn Book I Agrippa explores the elemental world, reviewing the manifest\nand occult virtues of stones, plants, animals, and human individuals.\nOccult virtues, on which natural magic mainly focuses, are explained\nby the relationship of causal correspondence, connecting the eternal\nexemplars, the ideas, to the sublunary forms through the stars. In his\nNeoplatonic animated cosmos, all things are harmoniously related to\neach other. Magical activity consists chiefly in attracting the\n“spirit of the world” (spiritus mundi). It is\ndiffused everywhere and distributes life to everything, acting as the\nmediator between heavenly souls and earthly bodies, and allowing a\nsympathetic exchange between the different levels of the ontological\nhierarchy. \nBook II, dedicated to astrology, opens with the celebrated image of\nthe magus as the go-between who subjects sublunary world to the stars.\nThe knowledge of the laws, governing how the celestial influences flow\ndown to the earth, enables the magus to collaborate actively with\nnature, modifying the phenomenal processes. To describe astrological\nimages, attracting astral virtues, Agrippa pillaged the technical\ndetails described by Ficino in De vita coelitus comparanda\n(On Obtaining Life from the Heavens), but he also went back\nto the medieval tradition. \nIn Book III, Agrippa commits the physical and celestial worlds to the\nprotection of religion, which has the task of guaranteeing a\nrigorously non-superstitious magic, immune to demonic deceptions.\nReligion provides the magus with a model of moral improvement,\nallowing him to realize the Hermetic ideal of the perfect philosopher,\nperfect magus, and perfect “priest” (sacerdos).\nIn describing the human path to Hermetic deification, the first draft\nof Book III makes a clear distinction between faith and science.\nAgrippa draws on Reuchlin to define the link between illumination,\noffered by God to the human mind through faith, and reason, which can\ngain true knowledge only by receiving it from the mind. Reason, after\nattaining the innate contents of the mind, produces a science which is\nlegitimized by its divine origins and is therefore not susceptible to\nthe assault of doubts and errors. This was only an initial (and\nsomewhat vague) approach to a topic which would play an increasingly\ncrucial role in Agrippa’s thought. At this time, the primacy of\nfaith, as expressed by Reuchlin, functioned chiefly as the basis for a\npowerful and reliable operative practice. As far as kabbalistic magic\nwas concerned, Agrippa seemingly played down Reuchlin’s raptures\nabout the Hebrew language, assimilating the sacred Hebrew names,\ninstituted by God as the vehicles of his power, to the so-called\n“strange” or “foreign words” (barbara\nverba) of ancient theology and Neoplatonic theurgy. \nThe early version of De occulta philosophia was, in many\nrespects, an original attempt. Nevertheless, it did not perfectly\nsucceed in organizing Agrippa’s different and varying sources\ninto a coherent structure—especially as regards Book III, which\nplayed a pivotal role in connecting magic to the religious foundation\nof learning. Not without reason, the dedicatee Trithemius noticed\nthese limitations, urging his pupil “not to imitate bullocks,\nbut to emulate birds” (Epistolae, pp.\n503–04)—that is, to turn his mind to the metaphysical\nUnity as a prior requirement for all magic activity. \nThe key to understanding the internal coherence of Agrippa’s\nthought is to be found in his deepening interest in Neoplatonic and\nHermetic writings, which allowed him to define the relationship\nbetween faith and reason in a more comprehensive perspective. In the\nPlotinian (and Ficinian) theory of the tripartite division of\npsychological faculties (mens, ratio,\nidolum), mind (mens) represents the highest\nfunction, the head (caput) of the soul, the divine spark\npresent in every human being; when God creates each soul, it is into\nthis supreme portion that he infuses the innate ideas, which mind\ndirectly intuits in God. Reason (ratio) is an intermediate\nfunction between the mind, which continually communicates with God,\nand the lower powers (idolum, that is, the sensory\nfaculties), which are connected to the material world. Reason, the\nseat of the will, is free to conform to either of the contrasting\ndirections indicated to it by the other parts of the soul. \nThis more structured view was already capitalized in the short\ntreatise De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum (On the\nThreefold Way of Knowing God), dedicated to William Paleologus in\n1516, but published only in 1529, in a version somewhat expanded by\nAgrippa before printing. The term ratio had many meanings for\nAgrippa. Firstly, it recounted the ‘way’ of divine\nrevelation. To manifest himself to mankind, God wrote three books, by\nwhich the three different religious cultures were able to know him.\nAncient philosophers, reading the book of nature, knew God through the\ncreated world; Hebrew theologians, reading the book of the law, knew\nGod through the angels and the prophets; Christians, reading the book\nof the Gospel, gained perfect knowledge of God through his son, made\nman. Secondly, ratio referred to the three\n“steps” (gradus) in the spiritual ascent of every\nhuman soul to God: sense perception, rational knowledge, and spiritual\nknowledge. Finally, like the scholastics, Agrippa intended\nratio as the epistemological criterion by which philosophical\nschools performed their theological investigations and reached their\nunderstanding of God’s essence. \nAgrippa projected the history of the individual soul and of philosophy\nback into the time preceding human history: Adam’s sin is the\narchetypal figure of the moral choices and intellectual options of his\ndescendants. Adam willingly renounced true knowledge when he, trusting\nmore in Eve than in God, presumed that he could achieve a knowledge\ncapable of making him equal to God. Similarly, each of us renews the\noriginal sin committed by Adam when our reason denies that it is\ncreated and proudly proclaims an autonomy of its own, shattering its\nharmonious relationship with God. Once the hierarchy of cognition has\nbeen destabilized, reason strives to find its contents in the senses,\nwhich are fallacious and deceptive, and builds up a science which is\nboth dubious and vain: devoid of foundation, inert, and morally\npernicious. Original sin is also repeated in the schools of\ncontemporary theologians, who try to know God by the wretched means of\ntheir rebellious reason. This is the science of those, who live\n“in the realm of the flesh” (Romans 8:9)—the science\nof the “sophists of God” (theosophistae):\nfatuous, arrogant, quarrelsome and immoral, unable of transforming\ntheir notions into actions, that is, of solving the crisis of which\nthey are both authors and victims. Contemporary culture, as the fruit\nof this rebellious reason (which is, after all, Aristotelian and\nscholastic reason), is fated only to describe, to lightly touch on the\nstructure of reality, without being able to penetrate it. \nAgrippa was not professing any form of anti-intellectualism, but he\nwas applying the Platonic (broadly speaking) model of the tripartite\nsoul to the Christian way of knowledge. In accordance with this\npattern, if reason respects its subordination to the mind, that is, to\nthe message, which God has implanted directly in the soul, it fulfils\nthe role which has been assigned to it in the project of creation,\nwhich is to know God by means of the book of nature. On the other\nhand, since the book of nature is written by the hand of God, the\nfundamental goodness of the world is implied; and it is also implied\nthat human beings have the ability to read these pages and are,\nindeed, obliged to do so. Reason is therefore perfectly literate and\nlegitimate when it comes to deciphering this bundle of communicative\nsigns. Nonetheless, the book of nature is a means through which God\nhelps us to return to our origin. Therefore, the reading should be\ndone with our eyes fixed more on the author of the book than on its\ncontents: the knowledge of physical reality is merely a way of\nretracing through sensible objects the cosmic process of love, which\nis centered on the eternal Good, “beginning, middle and\nend” of everything which exists. Humanity’s greatness\nresides purely and simply in its capacity to grasp God by\ncontemplating his works, the created symbols which bear witness to\ntheir creator. Moreover, when reason “silences” the\nsensory part of the soul and turns itself inwards to its highest\nfunction, it becomes conscious of the constant illumination of the\nmind by God. At that moment, reason grasps essences by an intuitive\nact which is superior to the purely rational one, insofar as it is a\n“contact of the essence with God”. This is not a mystical\nexperience. It is an intellectual experience, founded on some\nintuitive philosophical certainties, which revelation proves true.\nFaith (fides) does not provide new contents, but unveils the\ndeep sense of the existing contents of the reason, which is operating\nin harmony with the mind. A truly Christian philosopher, however,\ncannot be satisfied with having achieved individual knowledge. The\ncommandment to love our neighbor requires us to become “leaders\nof the blind” (Matthew 15:14), “a corrector of the\nfoolish” and “a teacher of the immature” (Romans\n2:20). Contemporary “bad shepherds” (pupils of “the\nschool of Satan”, as the only preserved manuscript of De\ntriplici ratione called them) neglect their spiritual\nresponsibilities. Therefore, the “new” Christian\nphilosopher has to turn into theologian, teaching the path to general\nredemption to his brothers in Christ. In addition, he has to take care\nof the social benefits deriving from his knowledge. Agrippa slightly,\nbut significantly, modified the most celebrated sentence of the\nHermetic Asclepius: “A human, Asclepius, is a great\nmiracle!”) by stating: “A Christian human is a great\nmiracle!” (Magnum miraculum est homo Christianus!, p.\n146). \nThe allegorical interpretation of the original sin which Agrippa\nborrowed from Paulus Ricius’ Isagoge\n(Introduction) was repeated two years later in his De\noriginali peccato (On Original Sin), written in 1518,\nbut published in 1529. Adam is faith, the foundation of reason. The\nTree of Life, that is, the privilege of knowing and contemplating God,\nwas reserved to him. Eve is reason, which was allowed to have a\nrelationship with the snake, that is, with material things and the\nsenses. Unlike Adam, she was not forbidden to eat from the Tree of\nKnowledge, that is, to know the physical world. Our ancestors were\nequally responsible for original sin, but in different ways:\nEve/reason, because she placed trust and hope in the senses and\nweakened faith’s firmness with her arguments; Adam/faith,\nbecause he, wishing to indulge his woman, turned away from God to the\nsensory world, relying entirely on the conclusions which reason drew\nfrom senses. Agrippa did not generally censure the potential of\nreason, but emphasized the hierarchical link between faith and reason.\nWe are not allowed to debate de divinis (“about divine\nmatters”), in which we must only have faith and hope. Instead,\nwe can speculate about created beings, but not have faith and hope in\nthem. \nThe allegory was also invoked in his famous eulogy of women, De\nnobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus (On the Nobility\nand Superiority of the Feminine Sex), by which Agrippa hoped to\ningratiate himself with Margaret of Austria. Among all the topics\nwhich he meticulously collected from the rich repository of this\nliterary genre, he also proposed a more philosophical argument in\nfavor of women, analyzing Eve’s role in original sin. It was\nAdam, who introduced spiritual death into the world, since Eve was not\nprohibited from eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: thus, she\nwas not guilty of disobeying God. Agrippa did not claim that Eve was\ncompletely without sin. More modestly, he maintained that her sin did\nnot entail transgressing God’s commandment; she sinned\nnevertheless because she allowed the snake to tempt her and became the\noccasion of Adam’s sin. She was deceived and went\nastray—not “involuntarily” (Van der Poel 1997: 210),\nbut “ignorantly”. What should we understand by\n“ignorantly”? Agrippa could not seriously regard\nEve’s ignorance as a defect in her spiritual progress (as\nAugustine did in his The Literal Meaning of Genesis) or as a\nweakness of her spiritual faculties (as Isotta Nogarola did in her\nDialogue on Adam and Eve). In the opening of the treatise,\nAgrippa, recalling humankind’s creation (Genesis 1:26–7),\nunderlined that both Adam and Eve had been created in God’s\nimage and likeness: as rational souls, both shared the same\npsychological faculties, the same teleology, and the same moral\nfreedom. The seeming inconsistency can be resolved by interpreting the\nbiblical progenitors as “figures” of Neoplatonic\npsychology. Reason’s ignorantia Dei (“ignorance\nof God”) is not a passive “not-knowing” (which is,\nin any case, unthinkable, because God is not concealed in unfathomable\ntranscendence, but “shines everywhere” in nature, and,\nabove all, inside humans). On the contrary, reason’s\nignorantia Dei is an active “neglecting”, a will\nto turn away from God and a pride in being an end in itself. \nIt is not possible to establish the extent to which the declamatio\ninvectiva which Agrippa announced to his friend Jean Chapelain in\nSeptember 1526 was really finished at that time. We do know, however,\nthat when Johannes Grapheus published it in 1530, some parts at least\nhad been expanded and reworked, according to Agrippa’s custom\n(Nauert 1965: 108, n. 11; Zambelli 1992: 81, n. 40). The work was\nreprinted many times and was also translated into German (1534),\nItalian (1543), English (1569), French (1582), and Dutch (1651). \nRichard Popkin underlined that Agrippa’s declamation does not\ncontain the “serious epistemological analysis” one would\nexpect from a skeptical debate and suggested that it should be\nconsidered as an expression of anti-intellectualism and biblical\nfundamentalism (Popkin 2003: 29). This reading, however, leaves the\nkey question unresolved: such an anti-intellectualism or biblical\nfundamentalism is difficult to reconcile with Agrippa’s\nlong-standing interest in precisely those sciences which by then\nshould have been swept away by the appeal to verbum Dei\n(“word of God”). It is undeniably true that in De\nvanitate the moral angle prevails over the epistemological\ncritique. This is because Agrippa also looked at trades, professions,\npastimes, and social types, none of which were susceptible to\nepistemological analysis. Moreover, when discussing a science, he was\nprimarily interested in focusing on how it was used and on its\nconcrete effects on society, rather than in investigating its methods\nand subjects. Some scholars have identified De vanitate as\nthe result of a profound personal crisis (psychological, religious, or\ncultural), which led Agrippa to a radical criticism of the system of\noccult doctrines and of his own intellectual choices. No doubt, the\ncircumstances of his life between 1526 and 1530 influenced the tone of\nthe work which he was preparing, accentuating its harshness and\ninspiring some of its more polemical and audacious pages. Nonetheless,\nit is unlikely that, all of the sudden, Agrippa abandoned his\nphilosophical convictions, solely because of indignation at the\ntreatment he suffered at the court of Louise of Savoy (Weeks 1993:\n120–24). Likewise, the hypothesis of an intellectual upheaval\n(Keefer 1988: 614–53; Zambelli 2000: 41) remains merely\nconjectural. Agrippa’s supposed disbelief in science (and, above\nall, in astrology and magic) contrasts with his continuing work on\nDe occulta philosophia and with his project for a reform of\nthe magical tradition, based on a new vision of science. It is\nimportant to recognize that there were serious motivations behind his\nfierce attack on the foundations of knowledge. Bowen (1972:\n249–56) and Korkowski (1976: 594–607), reducing De\nvanitate to a simple exercise of rhetoric in the fashionable\nliterary genre of the paradox, correctly outlined the work’s\nformal characteristics; however, they did not sufficiently take into\naccount its philosophical intentions and turned its subversive\nimplications into something quite inoffensive. De vanitate\nproposed a reform project, one which was broader, more complex, and\nmore radical than that of its model, Erasmus’ Praise of\nFolly (Laus stultitiae). \nAgrippa’s aim was to pass judgment on the condition, methods,\nand practitioners of the philosophical and theological schools which\ndominated his time. His verdict is undoubtedly very severe. He\nbelieved that contemporary culture, lost in useless sophisms, was no\nlonger able to fulfill its task of educating Christian people and\npromoting their spiritual well-being. The social fabric had become\ntorn by corruption, by political and religious struggles, and by\nheresies and superstitions. He did not, however, intend De\nvanitate to be merely destructive. His aim was also to propose a\ncultural alternative, delineating a different philosophical approach,\ncapable of forming a new intellectual élite, who would be\nseriously interested in the moral and religious progress of human\ncommunity. \nCertainly, the most striking aspect of the declamatio is its\ncritical stance. The all-encompassing polemical parade emphasizes that\nhuman “inventions” (inventiones)—grammar as\nwell as dance, theology as well as hunting, ethics as well as dice\ngames—are nothing more than opinions, devoid of coherence and\nstability, and irreparably harmful to support the spiritual health of\nbelievers. The discord which divides practitioners of each branch of\nscience attests to the intrinsic weakness of the findings of natural\nreason, which proceeds by conjectures, subject to refutation.\nEverything reason devises and carries out, relying on its own strength\nalone, is fallacious, useless, and damaging: “the structure of\nthe sciences is so risky and unstable that it is much safer not to\nknow anything than to have knowledge” (1, p. 5). The happiest\nlife is the life of the ignorant. \nThe usual compilation of discordant opinions of philosophers was\npartly shaped by texts of the ancient skeptics; but for the most part\nAgrippa made use of more recent sources: Ficino, Reuchlin, and\nFrancesco Giorgio Veneto. There are no quotations from Gianfrancesco\nPico’s Examen vanitatis doctrinae gentium, the first\ndetailed reading of the work of Sextus Empiricus (Schmitt 1967:\n237–42). This significant omission suggests that Agrippa did not\nagree with the skeptical fideism expressed by Gianfrancesco. De\nvanitate did not, in fact, question the human ability to know\ncauses. Rather, it questioned the capacity of Aristotelian\nepistemology to account for the nature of things. In chapter 7,\nAgrippa states that knowledge based on sense perception is not able to\nguarantee a sure and truthful experience, since the senses are\nfallible; nor does it succeed in revealing the causes and properties\nof phenomena or in knowing what is only intelligible, since this\nescapes the grasp of the senses. Not all human knowledge was open to\nquestion, however. Instead, Agrippa, by proving that a sense-based\ntheory of knowledge cannot produce science, intended to introduce\nanother epistemology, one which he regarded as the foundation for true\nknowledge. So, in chapter 52, “On the Soul”, he did not\nuphold even the façade of skepticism. “Demonic\nAristotle” (daemoniacus Aristoteles) made the soul\ndependent on the nature of the body, defining it as “the first\nperfection of a natural body possessing organs, which potentially has\nlife” (Aristotle, De anima II.1). “Divine\nPlato” (divinus ille Plato) aligned himself with those\nphilosophers (Zoroaster, Hermes, and Orpheus) who had defined the soul\nas a divine substance: the “product of an incorporeal\nmaker” and dependent “solely on the power of its efficient\ncause, not on the bowels of matter” (52, pp. 109–10). Agrippa\nnoted the disagreement between Aristotle and Plato on this subject,\nnot in order to lead his readers to a skeptical “suspension of\njudgment” (epoché). Rather, he intentionally\ncontrasted two different models of rationality, explicitly weighing up\ntheir value. At least on this matter, the “ancient\ntheology” (prisca theologia) and the Platonic school\nwere found to be consistent with the criterion of truth, the Holy\nScriptures. \nThe real intentions of De vanitate have to be extracted from\ndeep inside the text, hidden beneath more polemical and provocative\nstatements. The sciences of their own accord “do not procure for\nus any divine felicity which transcends the capacity of man, except\nperhaps that felicity which the serpent promised to our\nancestors”; but in itself “every science is both bad and\ngood” and deserves whatever praise “it can derive from the\nprobity of its possessor” (1, p. 21). Agrippa appropriated here\nthe Aristotelian principle of the ethical neutrality of science: it is\nthe spiritual attitude of the knower, his “integrity”\n(probitas), which constitutes the moral criterion of the\ndiscipline and ensures good or bad usage. From the cultural point of\nview, the destructive action of skepticism puts an end to the\ndiscussion between the schools by eliminating one of the two\ncontenders, that is, all philosophers whose doctrines are built on the\nfoundation of sensory experience. From the pedagogical point of view,\nhowever, skepticism is no more than a preliminary training. Systematic\ndebate about sensory representations and the suspension of judgment\nconcerning the appearances of the material world free the soul from\nfalse opinions, demonstrating the inadequacy of empiricism and\ndirecting the search for truth towards the intelligible. \nPurification leads to a new spiritual attitude, which makes the\nphilosopher capable of undertaking the route to true knowledge. Truth,\nin fact, is grasped only by turning inwards, to the mind, where God\nimplanted the innate ideas when he created the soul. Agrippa’s\nacceptance of the Neoplatonic theory of knowledge is positively\nexpressed in the final peroration of De vanitate, when he\ninvites his readers to abandon the schools of the sophists in order to\nregain awareness of the cognitive inheritance to which every soul has\nan original entitlement. Agrippa refers to the Academics alongside\nHoly Scripture to support the idea that human beings have an innate\nrealm of knowledge, which needs to be recovered by means of a suitable\npaideia, or program of education. The return to original\nperfection is an ‘illumination’—not a mystical\nillumination, but an intellectual one: the reminiscence and\nre-appropriation of self-knowledge. Ultimately, illumination is the\nknowledge of the self as “mind” (mens) or\n“intellect” (intellectus). \nIn this sense, Agrippa defines faith as the “foundation of\nreason” (fundamentum rationis), that is, the criterion,\nguarantee, and firm basis of human knowledge. Revelation is without\ndoubt the absolute and complete expression of truth; but it originates\nfrom the same source as the contents of the mind, on which the\nactivity of reason is dependent. Since God is the sole source of\ntruth, the tradition of faith is homogeneous with philosophical\ncontemplation, which finds its justification in revelation. Through\ndivine will, rationality and its higher level of “spiritual\nintelligence” are able to establish a relationship of\ncontinuity. For this reason, rational science and all its practical\napplications gain authenticity and legitimacy if they develop within a\ntheological framework. This does not mean that reason has to draw its\ncontents directly from Scripture. Rather, it means that the contents\nof science, procured by the exercise of reason, are “true”\nwhen they do not contradict divine design, do not hinder the spiritual\nprogress of the Christian, and contribute to the good of humanity and\nthe world. Certainly, the architect will not seek technical\ninstructions for how to put up his building in the Bible. Instead, he\nand those who commission him need to seek in it an indication of the\n“manner” (modus) and “end”\n(finis) of this discipline. Architecture would be an art and\nscience “extraordinarily necessary and beautiful” in\nitself and capable of making a large contribution to the well-being of\nthe civil community, if humankind had not rendered it vain and noxious\nby their excessive use of it “for the simple exhibition of the\nriches” and by heedlessly destroying the natural\nsurroundings. \nIn De vanitate, Agrippa does not put faith in opposition to\nscience or the Holy Scriptures in opposition to human books. He\ninstead puts Aristotelian philosophy, worldly science and the source\nof unbelief in opposition to “Platonic” philosophy, the\nmodel of a Christian “science in the word of God”\n(scientia in verbo Dei). With this expression, Agrippa refers\nto a religiously orientated science: a science which can move freely\nin the sphere of the “visible manifestations of God”\n(visibilia Dei) in order to know his “invisible\nessentials” (invisibilia) and to trace the beginning\nand origin of everything. He does this in the awareness of the harmony\nbetween faith and reason, which scholastic Aristotelian philosophy had\ndisowned, infecting the world with a plague of “petty\nsyllogisms” (ratiunculae), sophisms, and impertinent\nquestions about God. There is, in sum, a ‘divine’ path to\nknowledge, which Plato and the ancient theologians founded on God and\nwhich deals with God. And there is a “demonic” path, which\nAristotle constituted merely on human abilities and which deals with\nlower things: it is demonic, because it renews and perpetuates the sin\nof Adam, inspired by Satan and his proud ambition to make himself\nequal to the creator in the knowledge of good and evil. \nAgrippa’s distinction between different forms of\nrationality—valued differently according to their basis and\ntheir final point of view—allows us to regard his declamatio\ninvectiva as not belonging to a true and proper profession of\nskepticism, of general anti-intellectualism, or of rigorous fideism.\nInstead, it can be realigned with the anti-Aristotelian and\nanti-scholastic critiques of Ficino, Reuchlin, and Giorgio. Agrippa\ndid not propose abandonment in God in the undifferentiated\nindifference of “neither this one nor that one” advocated\nby Sextus Empiricus. In his view, skepticism constituted an exercise\nin education, necessary for pointing the way towards the apprehension\nof truth. In the final digression, “In Praise of the Ass”,\nAgrippa seemingly invites his readers to put down the baggage of the\nhuman sciences and return to being “naked and simple\nasses”, and thus newly capable of carrying on their own backs\nthe mysteries of divine wisdom, like the ass which carried Jesus into\nJerusalem. This ironic exhortation is polemical: those who must be\nsubjected to metamorphosis into an ass are the “noble doctors in\nsciences”, professing a purely human (or rather, demonic)\nscience. For scholastic theologians, the motto “To know nothing\nis the happiest life” (nihil scire foelicissima vita)\nis valid, since “there is nothing more fatal than a science\nstuffed with impiety” (1, p. 4). Philosophy should be a\nreligious progress—or, rather, a regressus, a return to\nthe source of being. \nIn De vanitate, Agrippa did not make any explicit recantation\nof his passion for occult sciences (Keefer 1988: 618); he simply\nadmitted that there might have been something wrong in his juvenile\nwork on magic, because of his adolescent curiosity. In fact, the\nrenewal of magic continued to be a central feature of his intellectual\njourney. Between 1530 and 1533, right in the middle of his violent\nbattle against theologians and conservatives, he was preparing De\nocculta philosophia for publication, entrusting his last hope of\na secure financial support to the same work to which he had committed\nhis desire for fame and fortune twenty years earlier. Although in the\nmeantime his religious concerns had deepened, he did not perceive any\nconflict between his involvement in theological debates and his\npersistent interest in the task of rebuilding magic. In his mind, they\nwere two coherent aspects of a single project, as he had already\npointed out in De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum. There\nAgrippa had made clear that reforming culture on the basis of the\nsolid certainty of God’s illumination also implied regaining\nhumankind’s original perfection and thaumaturgic ability, which\nAdam owned by right before he sinned. \nComparison of the 1510 dedication copy, sent by Agrippa to Trithemius\n(MS Würzburg, M.ch.q.50), with the printed final edition (Cologne\n1533), reveals the careful and thorough revision and enlargement to\nwhich the first draft was subjected. The book doubled in length, and\nfresh ideas and references were included. In updating the text,\nAgrippa mostly drew on works consistent with the sources he had\nalready used in drafting the initial version. Between 1510 and 1533,\nhe had studied a number of texts which he had previously been unaware\nof or neglected (Ficino’s commentaries on Plato and on Plotinus;\nGiovanni Pico’s Conclusiones, Heptaplus, and\nDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem; Lodovico\nLazzarelli’s Crater Hermetis; and Gianfrancesco\nPico’s De rerum praenotione) or which had been\npublished in the meantime (some of Erasmus’ writings; Paulus\nRicius’ commentaries on Hebrew writings; Reuchlin’s De\narte cabalistica; and Francesco Giorgio’s De harmonia\nmundi). Agrippa’s vast exploration of books allowed him to\nre-orient his youthful project, providing a definitive justification\nof his aim to restore in full the religious, cognitive, and practical\nscope of ancient magic. This “reformed magic” (magia\nreformata) would not only guarantee to the magus mastery over\nnature and the ability to attract astral and angelic virtues, but\nwould also assure his ascent to the First Principle. \nThe revised version of De occulta philosophia offers\nextensive proof of this significant qualitative shift. The original\ntripartite structure was given a new metaphysical structure, which\npowerfully underlined the idea of the cosmos as an epiphany of the\ndivine. Thanks to the influence of Giorgio’s De harmonia\nmundi, Agrippa was able to adopt a radically new approach to\nnatural magic. Now, Book I explicitly contemplates the material world\nas the receptacle of divine and presents the occult virtues as an\nexample of the living links connecting the terrestrial forms to the\nFirst Cause through the chain of the higher intermediaries (stars and\nspiritual essences). The “perfection of both science and\npractice” is guaranteed by the ability to change the impure back\nto the pure, and plurality back to simplicity. In significant\nadditions “on the properties of elements” (chapters\n3–6), William Newman (1982) recognized the description of the\nalchemical reduction of elemental earth to the purity of first matter.\nThere are three orders of elements, corresponding to the three levels\nof being: pure elements, unmixed and incorruptible; compound elements,\nmultiplex, varied and impure, but which can be reduced to “pure\nsimplicity” (pura simplicitas); lastly, decomposed\nelements, convertible into one another. Earth, which confers solidity\non other elements, mixing with them but without changing into them, is\nthe receptacle of every celestial influence, because it is\ncontinuously animated by the virtues conveyed by the\nspiritus: so, earth is “the foundation and mother of\neverything”, because it encloses the seminal virtues of all\ncreation. Therefore, having undergone the process of purification and\nsimplification, it becomes “the purest remedy for restoring and\npreserving us”. The process of universal simplification of the\nelements can be carried out by reducing earth to the original purity\nof the first matter. Newman explained the nature of this process,\nreferring to chapter 4 of Book II, on the power of the number one.\nHere, Agrippa traces the presence of unity in all levels of existence:\nGod in the archetypal world, the anima mundi in the\nintellectual one, the Sun in the heavenly world, the heart in man, and\nLucifer in hell. In the elemental world, the one is the\nphilosopher’s stone, “embodying all wonders”,\nwithout which “neither alchemy, nor natural magic may attain\ntheir perfect end”. Agrippa’s source, as Newman has\npointed out, was a letter in which Trithemius gave a cosmological\ninterpretation of the Hermetic text “Emerald Tablet”\n(Tabula Smaragdina), identifying the alchemical opus\nas the universal “path to the highest unity”\n(Epistolae, pp. 471–73). \nBook II introduces a massive quantity of “technical”\nreferences, in some part influenced by the corpus of magical\nmanuscripts which had belonged to Trithemius and which came into\nAgrippa’s possession in 1520. This updating, however, depended\nfor the most part on epistolary exchanges of texts and ideas with his\ncorrespondents. Despite his violent attack on the divinatory arts in\nDe vanitate, he presented here a more comprehensive treatment\nof astrology. After all, magic (although “reformed”) could\nnot dispense with astrology. Occult virtues can be explained only in\nterms of the heavenly qualities conveyed by the rays which emanate\nfrom stars. It is each individual’s horoscope which determines\nhis or her specific powers. Even the relationships of\n“attraction or repulsion” (amicitia vel lis)\nbetween sublunary bodies correspond to the relationships between\ncelestial bodies. Agrippa insistently emphasizes the link connecting\nmagic to astrology, defining the latter as “the much-needed key\nfor all secrets”. In recognizing the pivotal role played by\nastrology, Agrippa seems to contradict his harsh judgment of this\nscience in De vanitate: fallacious conjecture, practiced by\nsuperstitious, ignorant, and mendacious followers. The contradiction\nis only apparent, however. Like any other human science, astrology is\nboth bad and good. It is bad in the hands of those who pass off a\nconjecture as an infallible fact, thus denying man’s freedom and\nthe divine providential design. It is good in the hands of the\nChristian magus, who uses it to reveal that God shines everywhere and\nto benefit his own kind. In the context of Agrippa’s purpose in\nDe occulta philosophia, good (that is, non-deterministic)\nastrology remains the key to rebuilding true Christian magic. \nBook III was most affected by Agrippa’s meticulous recasting of\nthe treatise. Through his contact with Latin kabbalistic texts (both,\ntranslations from Hebrew literature as well as works by Christian\nfollowers), Agrippa was able to insert many new chapters: on the\nSephiroth, that is, the ten attributes or emanations\nsurrounding the infinite; on the ten names of God; and on angels and\ndemons. His (second-hand) openness to the Hebrew tradition inspired a\nmore mature approach to a number of essential issues. In particular,\nthe topic that humanity is created “in the image of God”\nbecame a more developed account of the human being as a “small\nworld” (microcosmus). Juxtaposing the original nucleus,\ndrawn from his own unfinished Dialogus de homine\n(Dialogue on Humankind), with selected passages from the\ndoctrine of the Zohar, the most important kabbalistic work\n(via Giorgio’s De harmonia mundi), Agrippa was able to\nelaborate further his cherished doctrine of three parts of human soul.\nSince soul’s three parts (neshama, ruah, and\nnephesch in Hebrew) have different origins and natures, they\nalso have different destinies. After the body’s death, the\nsensitive soul (nephesch, idolum) immediately\ndissolves. Mind (neshama), as the breath of God, is immune\nfrom sin and returns immediately to its abode, reuniting with its\norigin. Reason (ruah), by contrast, must undergo judgment\nwith regard to the choices it has made in life: it will participate in\nthe beatific vision if it has followed the way of the mind; it will be\ndamned and reduced to the status of an evil demon if it has made\nitself a slave of the sensitive soul. In this way, the topic of\nhumankind as created in the image of God assumed a more defined\neschatological meaning. In Agrippa’s view, the Pauline\n“You are the temple of God” (I Corinthians 3:16) meant\nrecognizing the presence of God in each human being—the mind,\nwhich characterizes the peculiar dignity of the microcosmus\nin conformity with humankind’s privilege of being made in the\nimage of God. Interiority became the foundation of the intellectual\nand religious life. The cultural background of the magus must be\nwide-ranging, but his claim to perfection is to be founded on his\nself-consciousness. \nThe path to attaining wisdom requires moral and intellectual training\n(dignificatio). Firstly, “natural” perfection\n(dignitas) is needed, that is, the perfect physical and\nmental disposition granted by a favorable horoscope (the same which\nJesus Christ had). Avicenna’s doctrine of the “perfect\nhuman being” (homo perfectus), the prophet, is\nrecognizable here. According to Agrippa, however, those who were not\nborn under this favorable constellation can replace the natural\ndignitas which they lack with an “artificial”\none, using selected foodstuffs, natural remedies, and a proper\nlifestyle. The second requirement is the “merit”\n(dignitas meritoria), that is, the overcoming of corporeal\npassions and sensitive impressions, the recovery of knowledge, and the\nmastery of everything: when reason subjects itself to mind,\nman’s soul becomes a “soul standing and not falling”\n(anima stans et non cadens) and is able to perform miracles\n“by God’s virtue” (in virtute Dei). The\nthird requirement is “godliness” (ars religiosa),\nthat is, the constant and pious practicing of sacred ceremonies, which\nare metaphors and perceptible signs of the transformation worked by\nGod in us. This does not mean the requirement to carry out initiatory\nrituals in order to gain access to esoteric and supra-rational\nmysteries. Agrippa’s appeal to spiritual purification was\nessential precisely because his book made known to everyone the\n‘secrets’ of magic. Only a person who is “perfectly\npious and truly religious”, however, can legitimately perform\n‘true’ and ‘pure’ magic. This is why spiritual\nrebirth (and, hence, magic) is not available to everyone: the divine\nspark which is naturally present in each individual is completely\ninactive in the majority of humankind, whose reason is overwhelmed by\nthe impulses of their senses. \nAgrippa’s overall oeuvre may be regarded as an\nuninterrupted meditation on humanity: the meaning of its existence,\nits possibility of gaining not only eternal bliss, but also happiness\non earth. From this point of view, Agrippa may be considered as a\n“humanist theologian” (Van der Poel 1997). Nonetheless, he\nproposed a radical revision of the very idea of theology. It should\nnot be a “subalternating” or higher “science”,\nplaced at the end of a long and complex training, as medieval\nscholastics had done. Instead, theology must be an isagogic, or\nintroductory, knowledge, since its task was to guide Christian people\nin their moral improvement, as well as in their earthly well-being.\nAgrippa’s theology, more than a philosophical treatment of God,\nwas, above all, a serious reflection on humankind, with the goal of\nleading it to self-consciousness and, then, making it fully aware of\nits origin and its final end. Ultimately, Agrippa may be better\ndefined as a “civic theologian”. The specific intentions\nof his works, their literary genres, and the personal background to\ntheir composition are all very different, which to some extent may\nexplain certain inconsistencies between them. Nevertheless, despite\nevery apparent contradiction and ambiguity presented by an impetuous,\npolemical, and very often foolhardy personality such as Agrippa, he\nalways assessed human knowledge (including magic) with respect to its\nawareness of the relationship which binds man to God. The way to truth\nlies not in the rifts between different schools of thought or in\nphilosophical distinctions, but in self-knowledge and\nself-awareness.","contact.mail":"Vittoria.PerroneCompagni@unifi.it","contact.domain":"unifi.it"}]
