If not, there should be no moral objection to active\neuthanasia in circumstances where passive euthanasia is permissible;\nand there should be no objection to bombing innocent civilians where\ndoing so will minimize the overall number of deaths in war. There\nshould, however, be an objection—indeed, an outcry—at our\nfailure to prevent the deaths of millions of children in the third\nworld from malnutrition, dehydration, and\n measles.[2]\n Moreover, it seems that the question is pertinent to whether\nconsequentialism is true, as consequentialists believe that doing harm\nis no worse than merely allowing harm while anti-consequentialists,\nalmost universally, disagree. But is there a moral difference between\ndoing harm and merely allowing harm? We might divide approaches to\nthis question into two broad kinds. First, those that attempt to\nanswer it without saying anything about the nature of the distinction\neither by use of examples (‘the contrast strategy.’) or by\nappealing to considerations that are purportedly independent of the\nprecise nature of distinction. And, second, those that analyze the\ndistinction in depth and try to show that its underlying nature\ndictates an answer to the moral question.\n\nJames Rachels (1975) provides a classic example of the contrast\n strategy.[3]\n He offers us a pair of cases—in one, Smith drowns his young\ncousin in the bathtub; in the other, Jones plans to drown his young\ncousin, but finds the boy already unconscious under water and refrains\nfrom saving him. The two cases are exactly alike except that the first\nis a killing and the second a letting die. Rachels invites us to agree\nthat Smith’s behavior is no worse than Jones’s. He then\nconcludes that killing per se is no worse than letting die per se, and\nthat if typical killings are worse than typical lettings die that must\nbe because of other factors.  \nAlthough most people struggle to see a moral difference between\nSmith’s behavior and Jones’ behavior, Frances Kamm (2007)\nargues that the cases might not be intuitively morally equivalent. She\nsuggests that we test the apparent moral equivalence by asking whether\nwe could imposes the same losses on Jones and Smith, assuming these\nwere necessary to bring the child back to life. Kamm claims that it\nwould be permissible to kill Smith to bring the child back to life but\nimpermissible to kill Jones for this reason (Kamm 2007, 17). If Kamm\nis right, then there is an intuitive difference between the two\n cases.[4] \nEven if Rachels were correct that Smith’s and Jones’s\nbehavior is morally equivalent, we may not be able to infer the moral\nequivalence of killing and letting die in general (where other things\nare equal) from this. Shelly Kagan argues that this inference assumes\nthat “if a factor has genuine moral relevance, then for any pair\nof cases, where the given factor varies while others are held\nconstant, the cases in that pair will differ in moral status”\n(Kagan 1988). He claims, moreover, that this assumes the Additive\nAssumption, the view that “the status of the act is the net\nbalance or sum which is the result of adding up the separate positive\nand negative effects of the individual factors” (Kagan 1988,\n259). He raises several objections to the Additive Assumption.\nFirstly, one might describe a pair of cases that are exactly alike\nexcept that one is a killing and the other a letting die, where the\nfirst intuitively seems far worse than the second. If this pair of\ncases is as good as Rachels’ pair, then either the inference is\nvalid in both cases—to prove the contradiction that killing is\nboth worse and not worse than letting die—or it is invalid in\nboth cases. Secondly, one might raise the rhetorical question: why\naddition—rather than, say, multiplication or some other\nfunction? Similarly, Kamm (1996, 2007) defends a Principle of\nContextual Interaction according to which a property can behave\ndifferently in one context than\n another.[5] \nQuinn (1989) argues that would-be counterexamples like the Bathtub\ncase involve a misunderstanding of the claim that the distinction\nbetween doing and allowing harm is morally significant. This claim\nshould be understood as more about moral justification than about\nother forms of moral evaluation. Quinn thinks that the distinction\nbetween doing and allowing is morally significant not because there is\nsome kind of intrinsic disvalue attached to doing harm, but because\ndoing and allowing harm run up against different kinds of rights. On\nQuinn’s view, the right against doing harm is stronger in that\nit takes much more to defeat or over-ride it. Thus much stronger\nconsiderations are needed to justify doing harm than to justify merely\nallowing harm (other things being equal). Suppose doing harm is much\nharder to justify than merely allowing harm (other things being\nequal). An unjustified killing and an unjustified letting die may\nstill be equally bad. Quinn illustrates this with an example: You have\na right of privacy that the police not enter your home without your\npermission. This right is easier to defeat than your right that other\nordinary citizens not enter your home without permission. Nonetheless,\nunjustified break-ins by the police are, if anything, morally worse\nthan unjustified break-ins by ordinary citizens. Quinn claims that\nthis is because “moral blame for the violation of a right\ndepends very much more on motive and expected harm than on the degree\nto which the right is defeasible” (Quinn 1989, 290)  \nSamuel Scheffler (2004) also attempts to settle the moral significance\nof the distinction between doing and allowing without offering an\naccount of the distinction. He argues that: “ despite the lack\nof consensus about which candidate is to be preferred, our practice of\ntreating one another as responsible agents requires us to make some\ndistinction of this kind” (Scheffler 2004, 216).\nScheffler’s paper is extremely rich and correspondingly\ndifficult to interpret. However, the main argument seems to consist of\ntwo parts. In the first part, Scheffler argues that to hold oneself\nand others to moral requirements, one must already (a) draw a\ndistinction between what one does and what one merely allows (or some\nother similar distinction) and (b) treat this distinction as morally\nimportant. To hold oneself to moral requirements involves seeing\noneself as having reason to act in one way rather than another. One\nmust therefore see oneself as an agent who is charged with the task of\nregulating one’s conduct in accordance with reasons. However,\nregulating one’s behavior is something one does, not something\none merely allows to happen. Thus to hold oneself to a moral\nrequirement is to attach a special importance to, and accept special\nresponsibility for, what one does (Scheffler 2004, 220–227). In\nthe second part, Scheffler argues that this distinction in moral\nsignificance needs to be included in the moral requirements\nthemselves: i.e. the set of requirements we hold each other to must\ndraw a distinction between what the agent does and what she merely\nallows. Scheffler argues that holding oneself to a set of moral\nrequirements which require one to make optimal use of the causal\nopportunities is unstable. Such a set of moral requirements would\nrequire a purely instrumental view of the agency of oneself and\nothers: we assess conduct purely in terms of whether it produces the\noptimal available outcome. However, holding oneself and others to\nmoral requirements involves adopting a non-instrumental view of\nagency: (1) The reasons one has to regulate one’s conduct must\nbe non-instrumental; (2) Holding oneself and others to moral\nrequirements involves seeing failure to live up to such requirements\nas meriting responses such as blame. Because whether blame is merited\nis not settled by whether it would produce the best outcome, this\nrequires us to recognise non-instrumental reasons (Scheffler 2004,\n 227–236).[6] \nOthers have taken an account of the nature of the doing/allowing\ndistinction to be a necessary starting point for assessing its moral\nrelevance. On this view, we cannot assess whether the difference\nbetween doing and allowing is morally significant until we know what\nthat distinction is. Before discussing some prominent approaches to\nthe analysis of the doing/allowing distinction and related assessments\nof its moral relevance, we will clear the way by identifying some\nrelated distinctions that are sometimes confused with the\ndoing/allowing distinction. \nSuppose some upshot occurs and would not have occurred if the agent\nhad behaved in some different way. The question of whether the agent\ncounts as doing or allowing may be conflated with or distorted by\nquestions that should be kept distinct from it, like the questions of\n(i) whether the agent intended the upshot, (ii) whether she could\neasily have prevented the upshot, (iii) whether she guaranteed the\nupshot or merely made it probable, and even (iv) whether the\nagent’s behavior was morally objectionable. It can easily be\nseen that these do not coincide with the distinction between doing and\nallowing. \n(i) Consider the distinction between cases where an agent intends the\nupshot and cases where she does not. If you drive your car into\nsomeone’s body, without realizing it, or because you were trying\nto avoid killing a larger number, and she dies as a result, you\nundoubtedly killed her, even if you did not intend her death.\nConversely, someone may intentionally allow a child to drown in order\nto inherit his fortune. \n(ii) It tends to be easier to avoid killing than to avoid letting die,\nbut this is only a tendency. Sometimes saving is easier than not\nkilling. It is easy to throw a life preserver, and it may be difficult\nto refrain from killing someone who is threatening one or who has\ntreated one appallingly. There are even cases where it is physically\ndifficult to avoid killing; as for example, where one has to hold\ntight to a tree to prevent one’s (light) vehicle whose brakes\nhave failed from running into a pedestrian. \n(iii) Sometimes the terms ‘making’ and\n‘allowing’ are used to suggest the difference between\nmaking certain and making possible or probable. For example, in\ndiscussions of the problem of evil, people sometimes say, “Well,\nGod didn’t actually make the murder occur. He just allowed it to\noccur.” This is best understood as a distinction between raising\nthe probability of murder to 1 from something less than 1, on the one\nhand, and raising the probability of murder from 0 to something higher\nbut still less than 1. This is a morally significant distinction but\nit is not the distinction between doing and allowing. An agent can\nkill without guaranteeing death. For example, by adding small\nquantities of poison to her victim’s meals she may bring about\nthe death, even though there was a 20% chance that the poison would\nnot kill her. On the other hand, an agent might guarantee the demise\nof a plant by failing to water it in a situation where she is the only\none who can do so. \n(iv) Finally, the distinction between doing and allowing harm is\nsometimes thought to have, as part of its conceptual content, a moral\nelement. This thought is rarely made explicit, but the way people are\ninclined to classify cases suggests that they are guided by it. There\nare two main difficulties with this way of drawing the line. Firstly,\nif it is true by definition that killing is worse than letting die,\nthen the question of whether killing is worse than letting die is\nsettled in a trivial, circular, uninteresting way. Secondly, there are\nobvious counterexamples to this crude account—morally appalling\ncases of letting die—failing to feed one’s\nchildren—and morally acceptable cases of killing. We have no\nhesitation talking of killing in self-defense. \nA more controversial question is whether the doing/allowing\ndistinction should be distinguished from another related distinction.\nSometimes harms occurs because the agent performed some action:\nbecause she pressed a switch or pushed a rock. Sometimes the harm\noccurs because the agent did not perform some action: because she did\nnot press a switch or did not push a rock. We will refer to this as\nthe action/inaction distinction. There do appear to be cases where the\naction/inaction distinction and the doing/allowing distinction come\napart. An actor might spoil a performance by failing to turn up (doing\nby inaction) (Foot 1978, 26). A potential benefactor might let a\nstarving child die by ringing up her attorney to cancel a direct debit\n(allowing by action) (Bennett 1981, 91). However, the status of these\ncases is a matter of disagreement. The relationship between the\ndoing/allowing distinction and the inaction/inaction distinction will\nbe particularly relevant in discussion of\n ‘Safety Net’ Cases.\n  \nAt this point, it is worth discussing the relationship between the\ndoing/allowing distinction and the famous Trolley Problem. The Trolley\nProblem dates back to Philippa Foot’s (1978) discussion of a\npair of examples: In the first case, a judge must choose between\nframing and killing an innocent man and allowing five innocents to be\nkilled in a riot. In the second, a trolley driver must choose between\nturning a trolley so that it runs over an innocent man attached to a\ntrack and allowing the trolley to run over and kill five innocent\npeople. Foot, claimed that it was wrong to kill in the first case, but\nnot wrong in the second. Foot noted that such cases might motivate\nsomeone to accept the Doctrine of Double Effect, which distinguishes\nbetween harm that is strictly intended and harm that is merely\nforeseen. However, Foot argues that the cases can be explained by the\ndistinction between doing and allowing harm: the judge must choose\nbetween killing one and merely allowing five to die, while the trolley\ndriver must choose between killing one and killing five. Judith Jarvis\nThomson (1986) modified the case so that it was a bystander, not the\ndriver, who had to make the choice. The difference was important,\nsince the bystander is clearly choosing between killing and letting\ndie and yet it still seems permissible to turn the trolley. This\nundermines Foot’s claim that the difference between doing and\nallowing explains our intuitions about these cases. So what made the\ndifference? A considerable amount of ink has been spilled in the last\n35 years attempting to answer this question. Recently, Thomson (2008)\nhas argued that the consensus that it is permissible for the bystander\nto turn the trolley was mistaken. She argues by way of offering the\nreader a third option, of turning the trolley onto and killing\noneself. Obviously, few of us would take that option. If so, she\nargues, we are not entitled to turn the trolley onto a stranger. Doing\nso would be like stealing someone’s wallet to give to charity.\nIn response, it might be noted, first, that some few of us would be\nwilling to make the sacrifice; second, in the original case, and\nperhaps in many real world cases, we are not faced with that third\noption. Thomson carefully urges that in these cases, it is still wrong\nto turn the trolley. Fitzpatrick (2009) has responded to Thomson by\ncasting doubt on the analogy between stealing money to give to charity\nand turning the trolley on a stranger rather than oneself. We know\nthat stealing is wrong except in exceptional cases — and the\nfact that the agent would prefer not to donate her own money\ndoesn’t make it an exceptional case. The Trolley Case is\nexceptional, which is precisely why it has generated so much\ndiscussion. Fitzpatrick argues that it must be permissible to\nsacrifice others when we would not sacrifice ourselves: morality\ncannot demand such extreme self-sacrifice but nonetheless the reasons\nto minimise damage remain\n compelling.[7] \nAlthough the Trolley Problem is often associated with the\ndoing/allowing distinction, if Thomson is right that the bystander\nwould be doing harm by turning the trolley, the two should be kept\nseparate. First, we must settle whether the doing/allowing distinction\nis morally significant. If it can be shown that the doing/allowing\ndistinction is morally significant, the Trolley Problem should be\nunderstood as a further challenge. To respond to this challenge one\nmust either (a) appeal to some additional distinction to explain why\nit is permissible for the bystander to turn the trolley towards five\nto save one, even though it is not normally permissible to kill one to\nsave five or (b) show that we should abandon the intuition that it is\npermissible for the bystander to turn the trolley.  \nLet’s turn to some candidate accounts of the doing/allowing\ndistinction, and where appropriate, the moral significance or\ninsignificance of each account. In both doing and allowing, an agent\nis responsible for or relevant to a bad upshot—such as a death\nor injury—in the sense that she could have prevented it. The\ncontrast is most naturally picked out by the terms ‘doing’\nand ‘allowing’, or ‘making’ and\n‘allowing’. We will in general use the former but due to\noccasional awkwardnesses in practice, we will sometimes use the terms\n“positively relevant to an upshot” and “negatively\nrelevant to an upshot” for cases of “doing” and\n“allowing”,\n respectively.[8] \nOne natural suggestion is that the agent who does harm causes it to\noccur; whereas the agent who allows harm doesn’t cause it, but\nsimply fails to prevent it where she could have done\n so.[9]\n This suggestion has immediate moral implications. It seems true by\ndefinition (almost) that you can be causally responsible only for\nupshots that you cause. And it is arguably true that you can be\nmorally responsible only for what you are causally responsible for.\nSo, if you cause a bad state of affairs, you’ve probably done\nwrong; whereas if you don’t cause a bad state of affairs, you\nhaven’t. In choosing between killing and letting die, you are\nchoosing between doing wrong and not doing wrong. (Of course, this\ndoesn’t apply to non-harmful cases of killing, such as,\narguably, some cases of active euthanasia.) The question of what you\nought to do is then tautologously easy. \nThis argument begins to get into trouble when we reflect on the fact\nthat we are often responsible for upshots we allow: the death of the\nhouseplants or the child’s illiteracy. When we notice that, in\nthese cases, the plants die or the child remains uneducated because of\nsome failure on the agent’s part, it becomes clear that the\nagent does, in some sense, cause the upshots. Moreover, most widely\naccepted contemporary accounts of causation imply that some event or\nfact involving these agents causes the deaths or illiteracy. For\nexample, the counterfactual account of causation—according to\nwhich (very roughly) event E causes F if and only if\nhad E not occurred F would not have occurred\neither—implies that it was the agent’s failure to water\nthe plants that caused the\n deaths.[10]\n John Mackie’s INUS\n condition[11]—according\n to which E causes F if and only if E is\na(n insufficient but) necessary part of a(n unnecessary but)\nsufficient condition for F—implies that the fact that\nthe agent failed to water the plants causes the plants to\n die.[12] \nWe are concerned then with a contrast between two ways the behavior of\nagents causes upshots. One suggestion is to say that when the agent is\npositively relevant to the upshot, the upshot would not have occurred\nif the agent had never existed. Suppose, for example, the victim dies\nbecause I push his head under water. He wouldn’t have died if I\nhad never existed. On the other hand, suppose he is in deep water and\ncannot swim and I don’t save him. He would have drowned anyway\nif I had never existed. In these two cases, the counterfactual account\ndraws the line in the intuitively correct way. \nHowever, suppose that the youngest son of a King squanders his\ninheritance and begs his elder brother, the new King, for food. The\nnew King refuses and the younger brother starves to death. If the\nelder brother had never existed, the younger brother would have\ninherited the throne and would not have starved to death. Yet, it is\nclear that the new King merely allows his brother to die and does not\nkill him (Kagan 1989, 96).  \nThis may lead us to revise the counterfactual test and ask whether the\nupshot would have happened if the agent had not been present.\nHoward-Snyder (2002) argues that this narrower counterfactual also\nfails. She asks us to “suppose an SS officer, Franz, tortures\nsomeone to death. But this is standard practice in the Gestapo. If\nFranz had stayed home with a sore throat, or if Franz had never\nexisted, his pal Hans would have done the torturing, in the same way,\nat the same time Franz did. If the counterfactual account is correct,\nthen Franz is negatively relevant to the victim’s death by\ntorture. That is, Franz merely allowed the death to occur”\n(Howard-Snyder 2002). Yet, it is very clear that Franz killed the\nvictim. Moreover, as Howard-Snyder points out “the fact that\nHans was waiting in the wings in no way diminishes Franz’s\nwrongdoing in this case.” (Howard-Snyder 2002). \nAlan Donagan (1977) suggests a similar account of the distinction. To\ndetermine whether the agent is positively or negatively relevant to an\nupshot, we should consider what would have happened if the agent had\nnot acted at the relevant moment, or what would have happened if the\nagent had ‘abstained from intervening in the course of\nnature’. It isn’t entirely clear what we are supposed to\nimagine when we imagine this but perhaps it’s that the agent is\nasleep or in a trance or in some other way unable to exercise her\nagency. Now—with respect to some behavior that led to some\nupshot, we might ask: would that upshot have occurred if the agent had\nabstained from intervening in the course of nature? If it would have,\nthe agent allowed the upshot. If it would not have, then she did it\n(her relevance to the upshot is positive). \nBennett offers the following counterexample to Donagan’s\naccount: Suppose that an alarm will go off if Henry pushes a button\nwhich requires a fairly specific movement. Henry is subject to a\nbarely controllable muscular spasm which, if allowed to run its\ncourse, would jerk his hand up, hitting the button and setting off the\nalarm. Bennett argues that on Donagan’s account Henry counts as\npositively relevant to the alarms silence (as keeping it silent)\nwhereas intuitively he seems to have merely refrained from setting the\nalarm off (Bennett 1995, p.\n 113).[13] \nAfter discussing, and dismissing, a similar stream of counterfactual\naccounts, Kagan notes we may be tempted to refine the counterfactual\ntest still further. We may want to say that an agent does harm when\nthe harmful upshot would not have occurred if the given reaction had\nnot occurred. However, on this account the distinction between doing\nand allowing simply disappears. For in the classic cases of merely\nallowing harm, the harm would not have occurred if the agent had acted\ndifferently. Suppose I watch Maude drown. If I had reacted\ndifferently, if I had not refused to save her, then she would not have\ndrowned. Thus this revised test still fails to capture the intuitive\ndistinction (Kagan 1989, pp. 97–98). \nCounterfactual accounts may be used to support the claim that doing\nharm is worse than allowing harm on the grounds that, on such\naccounts, allowing harm is simply a matter of not interfering or\nletting nature take its course. The underlying thought seems to be\nthis: if something bad happens when you do not exist (or are not\npresent or are unable to exercise your agency) then you aren’t\nresponsible for it. If we turn our attention to another world where\nyou do exist (or are present or able to exercise your agency), but\nwhich is otherwise exactly like the first, it seems that your\ncontribution to, and thus your responsibility for, the upshot is the\nsame. Thus we should not hold you responsible in the second case\neither. Bennett (1995) argues that this is a mistake. If some bad\nupshot occurs when you do not exist or cannot exercise your agency,\nthen you are not responsible for it. Your agency is not involved and\nthe bad upshot’s occurrence implies nothing about the morality\nof your behaviour. But this is simply not true in the other cases. In\nthese cases, you could have prevented the bad upshot and did not. The\nbad upshot is a consequence of how you exercised your agency and does\nhave implications for the morality of your behaviour. “ Only a\nmuddle could lead anyone to think that ‘I could have prevented\nit, but I did not’ is significantly like ‘I had nothing to\ndo with it’” (Bennett 1995, 119). \nBoth Philippa Foot and Warren Quinn attempt to defend the moral\nrelevance of the doing/allowing distinction by connecting it with a\nmoral distinction between positive and negative rights.  \nFoot (1978, 1984, 1985) argues that the difference between doing and\nallowing harm is at heart a difference in the agent’s\nrelationship to a harmful sequence. We are able to pick out the\nsequence leading to a harmful upshot. Foot distinguishes between\ninitiating (setting the harmful sequence going); sustaining (keeping\nthe harmful sequence going when it would otherwise have stopped);\nenabling (removing some barrier which would have brought the harmful\nsequence to a halt) and forbearing to prevent (failing to take some\naction which would have brought the sequence to a halt). Initiating\nand sustaining both count as doing harm; enabling and forbearing to\nprevent are ways of merely allowing harm. Foot is clear that, in her\nview, the doing/allowing distinction is not the same as the\naction/omission distinction. “[Forbearing to prevent] requires\nan omission but there is no other general correlation between omission\nand allowing, commission and bringing about or doing. An actor who\nfails to turn up for a performance will generally spoil it rather than\nallow it to be spoiled” (Foot, 1978, 26)  \nFoot (1978, 1984, 1985) argues that the moral relevance of the doing\n/allowing distinction rests on a distinction between positive and\nnegative rights. Negative rights are rights against interference\nwhereas positive rights are rights to aid or support. Negative rights\nare, in general, stronger than positive rights: it typically takes\nmore to justify an interference than to justify the withholding of\ngoods and services. Foot connects this to her analysis of the\ndoing/allowing distinction by arguing that interference implies\nbreaking into an existing sequence and initiating a new one and that\ntherefore violation of a right of non-interference must involve doing,\nrather than merely allowing, harm (Foot, 1984, 284). \nWarren Quinn (1989) shares Foot’s view that the doing/allowing\ndistinction rests on the difference between positive and negative\nrights, but offers both an alternative analysis and a deeper defense\nof the claim that negative rights are stronger than positive rights.\nWhile Foot argues that these is no necessary connection between action\nand doing or inaction and mere allowing, Quinn treats the\naction/inaction distinction as fundamental to the analysis of the\ndoing/allowing distinction. On Quinn’s view, an agent is\npositively relevant to a harmful upshot when his most direct\ncontribution to the harm is an action, whether his own or that of some\n object.[14]\n His relevance is negative when his most direct contribution is an\ninaction, a failure to prevent the harm. An agent’s most direct\ncontribution to a harmful upshot of his agency is the contribution\nthat most directly explains the harm. One contribution explains harm\nmore directly than another if the explanatory value of the second is\nexhausted in the way it explains the first. \nThe key difference for Quinn is between cases where the agent produces\nthe result by an action and cases where she produces it by an\ninaction—pushing someone’s head under water or refraining\nfrom throwing a life preserver. Quinn holds that we do not need\nfurther analysis of the action/inaction distinction. However, Quinn\nadds a modification to his account which means that he does not treat\nthe doing/allowing distinction and the action/inaction distinction as\nthe same. Sometimes, Quinn says, your relevance to a death can be\npositive, you can kill, in other words, even though you don’t\nact. This happens, for example, when you are on a train headed towards\nsome drowning victims you wish to save when you notice someone tied to\nthe tracks ahead of you. You can stop the train but you choose not to\nin order to reach your destination. Quinn believes that you kill in\nthis case, because the train acts as your agent, taking you where you\nwant to go, and crushing the person tied to the tracks in the process.\nOn the other hand, if you had chosen not to stop the train for some\nother reason but you would have not minded had someone else stopped\nthe train, then your failure to stop the train would not have\nconstituted a killing. \nLike Foot, Quinn believes that the key here is the distinction between\nnegative and positive\n rights.[15]\n Doing harm involves the violation of negative rights; merely allowing\nharm involves the violation of positive rights. Since negative rights\nare more stringent than positive rights, doing harm is harder to\njustify than merely allowing harm (ceteris paribus). Quinn\nagrees with Foot that negative rights are intuitively stronger than\npositive rights. However, Quinn seeks to provide further argument by\nlinking the precedence of negative rights over positive rights with\nthe conditions for a person’s body to genuinely belong to him:\n \nTo say that one has a negative right against being harmed is to say\nthat it is (at least, prima facie) wrong to harm one unless one wishes\nto be harmed. It is crucial that we add the phrase “unless one\nwishes to be harmed”, since without it, the precedence of\nnegative rights wouldn’t give the victim any special say about\nhis own body, because it would be just as wrong to harm him even if he\nasked to be harmed, and it would be wrong for him to harm himself. So,\nthe crucial thing is that the victim has some sort of a say about what\nhappens to himself(i.e., others are morally bound to respect his\nwishes with respect to his body to a certain extent). Quinn’s\nclaim is that if there is no extent to which someone’s wishes\nwith respect to his body, etc. are to be respected, then we’ve\ncompletely done away with the idea of ownership of one’s body,\netc. One person’s wishes about what happens to her body do often\nclash with someone else’s wishes about what happen to his. For\nexample, Susan wishes to marry Paul, but Paul doesn’t wish to\nmarry Susan. Morality obviously cannot give all such wishes\nprecedence. So, we need to give some subset of them precedence. Quinn\nargues that we cannot give positive rights precedence over negative\nrights without\n incoherence.[16]\n And, hence, he concludes that we must give negative rights precedence\nover positive rights. \nHoward-Snyder(2002) has argued that Quinn’s defense does not\nshow that we should endorse the distinction between doing and allowing\nrather than some alternative distinction: “...there are other\nways to divide up rights than the division into positive and negative\nrights. We might divide them into the rights of children and the\nrights of adults, rights concerning the upper half of the body and\nrights concerning the lower half, etc. and then give precedence to one\nset over the other whenever they come into conflict. These seem\narbitrary and wasteful, but their rationale seems no worse than\nQuinn’s. Quinn’s is a funny sort of defense of negative\nrights. Unless I’m missing something, it doesn’t pick out\nany special feature of negative rights that makes them specially worth\nrespecting” (Howard-Snyder 2002). \nWoollard (2013, 2015) attempts to fill this gap in Quinn’s\nargument, offering a new analysis of the doing/allowing distinction\nand using the notion of imposition to link the distinction, so\nanalysed, to the conditions for genuine ownership.  \nWoollard returns to Foot’s (1978, 1984, 1985) sequence account.\nHowever, she argues that Foot’s account is incomplete because it\ndoes not tell us how to distinguish enabling from sustaining, why\nenabling is grouped with forbearing to prevent, or what sustaining and\ninitiating have in common. On Woollard’s view, the key question\nis whether the relevant fact about the agent’s behavior is part\nof the sequence leading to harm. Woollard distinguishes between\nsubstantial and non-substantial facts. Substantial facts are by nature\nsuitable to be part of a sequence. Non-substantial facts normally\ncount as mere conditions for a sequence. Thus anything that is\nrelevant to a sequence through a non-substantial fact will normally be\na mere condition rather than part of the sequence. However,\nnon-substantial facts can count as relatively substantial and part of\na sequence under special circumstances, if for example, they are facts\nabout the absence of a barrier that belongs to the victim. \nThis leaves Woollard with the following account: If an agent is merely\nrelevant to a harm through a non-substantial fact about her body or\nbelongings then her behavior will be merely a condition for, rather\nthan part of, the harmful sequence. She will count as merely allowing\nharm. In contrast, if there is a complete sequence of substantial\nfacts leading from the agent to an harmful affect on what belongs to\nthe victim or a third party, her behavior will be part of the harmful\nsequence and she will count as doing harm. Woollard uses this analysis\nto connect the doing/allowing distinction and imposition. Imposition\ninvolves the needs or behavior of one person intruding upon the proper\nsphere of another. When an agent does harm, there is a sequence of\nsubstantial facts connecting her behavior to an unwanted effect on\nwhat belongs to this victim: this is a harmful causal imposition. When\nan agent is forbidden from allowing harm, she is required to make some\nsubstantial fact about her body or her belongings true for the sake of\nanother. Finally, Woollard argues that for our bodies and other\nbelongings to genuinely belong to us we require protection from both\ncausal and normative imposition: we require constraints against doing\nharm and permissions to allow harm.  \nLike Quinn and Woollard, Frances Kamm (1996, 2007) also appeals to the\nidea of rights or entitlements. Kamm argues that letting die has two\nessential properties which can make letting die more acceptable than\nkilling: (1) the victim only loses life that he would have had with\nthe agent’s help at that time; (2) the alternative is for the\nagent to be interfered with. These features make a moral difference\nbecause the victim has a stronger claim (relative to the agent) to\nwhat he has independently of that agent’s current efforts. Kamm\nargues that these features are essential properties of a letting die,\nbut may also be found in some cases of killing and such killings will\nbe morally equivalent to merely letting die.  \nJonathan Bennett thinks that the fundamental distinction between doing\nand allowing is between cases where the upshot occurs because of\none’s action and cases where the upshot occurs because of\none’s inaction—although he prefers to replace\n“action/inaction” talk with “positive/negative\nfact” talk (Bennett 1967, 1981, 1993, 1995). When Bennett\ndiscusses the contrast between positive and negative relevance to\nharm, he is attempting to capture a deep, philosophically interesting\ndistinction that underlies our talk of ‘doing and\nallowing’ ‘making and letting’,‘killing and\nletting die’. He acknowledges that the correspondence between\nhis distinction and the distinctions we make in everyday life and\nlanguage may be inexact. He says that my behavior is negatively\nrelevant to an upshot if a negative fact about my behavior is the\nleast informative fact that suffices to complete a causal explanation\nof it; whereas my behavior is positively relevant to that upshot if a\npositive fact about my behavior is the least informative fact about my\nconduct that suffices to complete a causal explanation of it. For\nexample, if I jog while you drown, your drowning could be explained by\nthe fact that I jogged, but it could also be explained by the less\ninformative fact that I did not pull you out of the water. \nIn a nutshell, on Bennett’s view, an agent’s relevance to\nan upshot is positive if most of the ways she could have behaved at\nthe time would not have led to the upshot; otherwise, it is\n negative.[17]\n For example, suppose I douse a slug with salt and it dies as a\nresult. My relevance to its demise is positive, since most of the ways\nI could have behaved would not have led to the death. On the other\nhand, if it dies because I fail to move it from the path of a car,\nthen most of the ways I could have behaved at the time would have led\nto its death, so my relevance to the death is negative. \nMost people conclude that on this account doing harm is in itself no\nworse than allowing harm. If some upshot obtains because of the way\nyou behaved, then the fact that there were many ways (rather than only\na few) you could have behaved which would also have had that result\nmay seem obviously morally\n insignificant.[18]\n This conclusion is surprising, even shocking. Bennett’s\naccount, however, does offer an alternative explanation of why we tend\nto think of killing as worse than letting die. He claims, quite\nplausibly, that it is morally worse to be causally relevant to a bad\nupshot one could easily have avoided than a similarly bad upshot one\ncould have avoided only with great difficulty. If most of the ways one\ncould have behaved would have led to an upshot, then it was probably\nsomewhat difficult or onerous to avoid the upshot; whereas if most of\nthe ways one could have behaved would not have led to an upshot, then\nit was probably fairly easy to avoid the upshot. However, on\nBennett’s view when killing and letting die are equally\ndifficult to avoid, and all other factors are equal, then there is no\nmoral difference between them. Thus the doing/allowing distinction is\nnot itself morally relevant.  \nThe two most persistent objections to Bennett’s accounts are the\nImmobility Objection and the Sassan Counterexample. There are two\ntypes of Immobility Counterexample: \nImmobility 1: If Henry stays completely still, dust will settle and\nclose a tiny electric circuit, setting off an explosion which will\nkill Bill. If Henry makes any move whatsoever, the dust will not\nsettle and the circuit will not close (Quinn 1989, 295). \nImmobility 2: If Henry makes any move whatsoever, he will set off a\nmotion detector which will set off an explosion, killing Bill. If he\nstays completely still, the motion sensor will not go off and Bill\nwill not die (Quinn 1989, 296). \nMost ways Henry could move in Immobility 1 would not lead to Bill’s\ndeath. Thus on Bennett’s account, Henry counts as positively\nrelevant to Bill’s death if he stays still and the dust settles\non the circuit in Immobility 1. This conflicts with our intuition that\nHenry would merely allow Bill to die by staying still. On the other\nhand, most ways Henry could move in Immobility 2 would lead to\nBill’s death. Thus on Bennett’s account Henry is\nnegatively relevant to Bill’s death if he waves an arm and sets\noff the motion sensor in Immobility 2. Again, this conflicts with our\nintuitions: intuitively waving an arm and setting off the explosion\nwould be killing Bill. As Quinn (1989, 296) notes, Bennett’s\naccount also clashes with our moral intuitions. It seems permissible\nfor Henry to stay still in Immobility 1 if this is necessary to save\nfive other lives even if Bill will die, but impermissible for him to\nmove to save five others in Immobility 2 if he would thereby set off\nthe motion sensor and kill Bill.  \nSome\n philosophers[19]\n argue that such examples refute Bennett’s account because\nBennett wrongly classifies immobility as positive and motion as\nnegative. The suggestion is that immobility is incompatible with\npositive relevance to an upshot. Nifty slogan: ‘You cannot do\nanything by doing nothing.’  \nHowever, there are some cases which do intuitively involve doing harm\nby remaining still. In Bennett’s example, Agent finds himself\nsitting on Patient’s chest. If he makes any move, this will\nrelieve the pressure enough for her to breathe, but if he stays still\nshe will suffocate and die (Bennett 1995, 98). \nBennett attempts to explain away the intuition that immobility is\nnegative by arguing that we are misled by the fact that in most actual\nstates of affairs, for any upshot that we care about, staying still\nwill be on “the roomy side of the line.” As Bennett notes:\n“It takes work to rig things so that keeping still is almost the\nonly route to some interesting upshot. Perhaps this is why, when\npeople confront a result that is produced by Agent’s immobility,\nthey immediately and invalidly infer that this is a case of\nallowing” (Bennett 1995, 99). \nBennett also suggests that our intuitions about doing and allowing are\nresponsive to two distinctions: his positive/negative distinction and\nthe active/passive distinction identified by Alan Donagan (see the\nsection on\n counterfactual accounts).\n An agent is active relative to an upshot if the upshot would not have\noccurred if the agent had temporarily lost the power of agency, i.e.\nhad been temporarily asleep or unconscious. Bennett asks us to imagine\nthat Henry finds it very difficult to stay still and he “sweats\nand strains” against bodily spasms to do so. He suggests that in\nthis case, where both analyses agree, we will see Henry’s\nbehaviour as doing. On the other hand, when the two distinctions\ndisagree, the resulting uncertainty will allow our rule of thumb (rest\nequals allowing and motion equals doing) to prevail (Bennett 1995, 99,\n113). \nHoward-Snyder (2002) is responsible for the second persistent\nobjection to Bennett’s account. In Howard-Snyder’s Sassan\ncounterexample, “An assassin, A. Sassan, is preparing to\nassassinate Victor by shooting him. A second assassin, Baxter, is\nwaiting across the street watching Sassan to ensure his success. If\nSassan shows any signs of hesitation, Baxter will shoot Victor\nhimself. Suppose Sassan knows about Baxter and his intentions and also\nknows that he can turn his gun on Baxter instead of on Victor if he so\nchooses. Although this thought crosses his mind, he quickly suppresses\nit, since he is committed to Victor’s annihilation. He shoots\nVictor and Victor dies instantly.” Most of the ways Sassan could\nhave behaved would have led to the shooting and death of Victor\n(either by himself or by Baxter). So it looks like Bennett’s\naccount will classify Sassan as negatively relevant to Victor’s\ndeath e.g. as merely letting Victor die. But as Howard-Snyder points\nout, “I just said that Sassan shot Victor. He pulled the\ntrigger. The gun fired. A bullet flew out of the barrel and entered\nVictor’s body. Victor died from the bullet wound. A clearer case\nof killing is impossible to find” (Howard-Snyder 2002). Bennett\nmight repeat the point that positive relevance to a death is not\nexactly the same as killing. Nevertheless, insofar as we have any\npre-theoretical grip on (and interest in) the concept of positive\nrelevance to a death, Sassan’s relevance to Victor’s death\nmust strike us as positive rather than\n negative.[20]\n And yet Bennett’s account implies that it is negative. \nHoward-Snyder (2002) discusses and responds to three possible\nresponses to the Sassan counterexample. First, she notes that someone\nsympathetic with Bennett’s account may attempt to demonstrate\nthat that account does accommodate our intuitions on this score by\nclaiming that it implies that Sassan’s behavior is positively\nrelevant to the actual death that Victor died, since if Baxter had\nkilled him, he would have died a different death. This response is not\nconsistent with Bennett’s approach, however, since the phrases\n‘the actual death’ and ‘a different death’\nseem to be referring to events rather than facts. And Bennett is\nclearly concerned with relevance to facts not events. \nHoward-Snyder (2002) then turns to Bennett’s own response.\nBennett has pointed out that the upshot that concerns us is not the\nfact that Victor died (no-one could prevent that) but the fact that\nVictor died at T (or perhaps, the fact that Victor died no\nlater than\n T).[21]\n He suggested that perhaps Sassan is positively relevant to that,\nsince most of the ways he could have behaved would have resulted in\nVictor’s dying later than T. But we could, with minimal\nartifice, ensure that Baxter is disposed to kill Victor at exactly\nT if Sassan does not. For example, we could imagine that\nthere is only a fraction of a second when Victor is vulnerable to a\nbullet and that Baxter is located closer to him (or has a faster\nacting gun) so that there is a moment T2 such that\nif Sassan does not shoot at T2, he will not\nsucceed in killing Victor, but such that Baxter still has a chance to\nget a shot off at T1 with the result that Victor\nwill die at T (Howard-Snyder 2002). \nFinally, Howard-Snyder (2002) explores responses which try to get the\nright result by narrowing the description of the upshot. Perhaps\nsomeone may try to argue that Sassan is positively relevant to\nsomething—the fact that Victor is killed with this bullet rather\nthan that, or more simply the fact that Victor is killed by him rather\nthan by Baxter. Howard-Snyder argues that the latter suggestion will\nnot do, since it begs the question. Bennett cannot assume that his\naccount implies that Sassan kills Victor, since that is the very claim\nat issue. Howard-Snyder (2002) also dismisses the suggestion that\nSassan is positively relevant to Victor’s being killed with this\nbullet rather than that, for we can modify the story in such a way\nthat if Sassan does not pull the trigger, Baxter can push a switch\nthat will guarantee that the gun\n fires.T).[22] \nLet us now discuss some types of case that raise issues for any\nattempt to analyse the doing/allowing distinction.  \nWhen we first describe the doing/allowing distinction, it is tempting\nto use standard doings and standard allowings of harm as examples. In\nstandard doings of harm, the agent performs some action, setting some\nphysical forces in motion which then run to the victim: Bob pushes a\nboulder which rolls down the hill and crushes Victor to death;\nBystander pulls a lever turning the trolley towards the one. In\nstandard allowing, the agent does not perform some action, refusing to\nintervene in some harmful sequence.  \nWhat about cases where the agent removes a safety net from beneath a\nfalling victim, unplugs a respirator, kicks a rock out of the path of\nthe runaway vehicle, and other similar cases? In these cases, the\nagent performs some action but does not act on the victim directly.\nInstead, she removes some barrier to a harmful sequence. Such cases\nhave received increasing attention in the last couple of decades, in\npart because of the recognition that some apparently standard cases of\ndoing in fact involve removing a barrier. As Jonathan Schaffer (2000)\nhas argued, in many guns, pulling the trigger fires a bullet by\nessentially removing a barrier.  \nThere are four main approaches to such ‘Safety Net’\nCases. \nNon-Unified Accounts may seem attractive because there are safety net\ncases that seem like clear cases of doing harm and others that seem\nvery much like merely allowing harm. For example, \nImpoverished Village: Having given one’s accountant full power\nof attorney one learns that because of a misunderstanding he is\npreparing to sign away 10% of one’s income to save the lives of\npeople in a remote impoverished village. One phones to instruct him\nnot to do it (McMahan 1993,\n 258).[24] \nHospital: A doctor has just plugged one person into a respirator. If\nthe patient is moved or unplugged from the respirator, he will die.\nFive more patients arrive and will die unless plugged into the\nrespirator. The doctor unplugs the first patient into order to save\nthe five (Rickless 2011, 68). \nBurning Building (Enemy): A person trapped atop a high burning\nbuilding leaps off. Seeing this, a firefighter quickly stations a\nself-standing net underneath and then dashes off to assist with other\nwork. The imperilled person’s enemy, however, is also present\nand, seeing his opportunity, swiftly removes the net so the imperilled\nperson hits the ground and dies. (McMahan 1993, 254) \nGallows: A innocent man is standing on a gallows with a noose around\nhis neck. The agent pulls the lever, releasing the trap door. As the\ninnocent man falls through the trap door, the noose tightens around\nhis neck, killing him. (See Vihvelin and Tomkow 2005, 194.) \nImpoverished Village and Hospital seem like clear cases of merely\nallowing harm whereas Burning Building (Enemy) and Gallows seem like\nclear cases of doing harm. The challenge for Unified All Doings\nAccounts is to explain our intuitions in Impoverished Village and\nHospital, either by arguing that our intuition that these cases count\nas allowings is misleading or by showing that these cases have some\nspecial feature which means they should not be seen as standard safety\nnet cases. Unified All Allowings Accounts face an analogous challenge\nwhen it comes to Burning Building (Enemy) and Gallows. Non-Unified\nAccounts and 3rd Category Accounts must give a convincing account of\nthe status of safety net cases which explains—or explains\naway—our intuitions about all such cases.  \nRickless (2011) uses both the above-mentioned tactics to defend the\nUnified All Allowings Account. He argues that our intuitions in cases\nlike Burning Building (Enemy) are distorted by the agent’s\nmalicious intentions. He suggests that if we remove the distorting\nfactor of malicious intentions, we will see the Burning Building case\nas morally equivalent to merely allowing harm (Rickless 2011,\n 71).[25]\n Thus, for example, in McMahan’s original Burning Building Case,\nwhen a firefighter removes a net from beneath one imperilled person in\norder to save five others, he counts as merely allowing harm (McMahan\n1993, 262, Rickless 2011, 72). Rickless argues that this would also be\ntrue of a passerby who moved the net from beneath one to save five\n(Rickless 2011, 73). Instead of arguing that our intuitions are wrong\nabout Gallows, Rickless argues that it differs from other safety net\ncases. In Gallows, there is no pre-existing threatening sequence.\nGallows should be understood as the initiation of a harmful sequence,\nand thus as doing harm.  \nMcMahan (1993) picks out three key factors which he claims affect\nwhether withdrawal of a barrier counts as doing or allowing\n“...whether the person who terminates the aid or protection is\nthe person who has provided it, whether the aid or protection is\nself-sustaining or requires more of the agent, and whether the aid or\nprotection is operative or as yet inoperative” (McMahan 1993,\n262). Withdrawal of a barrier counts as merely allowing harm if and\nonly if the barrier was (a) provided by the agent and the barrier is\neither (b) not self-sustaining or (c) not yet operative. Thus\nMcMahan’s account seems to correctly classify Impoverished\nVillage and Hospital as merely allowing harm and Burning Building\n(Enemy) as doing harm. It may, however, counterintuitively classify\nGallows as merely allowing harm if the trap door belongs to the agent.\nIf the trap door belongs to the agent, the continued use of his\nresources is required to keep the barrier in place, so the barrier may\nnot count as self-sustaining. McMahan also allows that sometimes one\nagent can act on behalf of another, or they can act as a team. This is\nsupposed to explain the intuition that in the Burning Building case\nwhere the net is moved to catch five imperilled persons instead of\none, it doesn’t matter whether it is the original firefighter or\na second firefighter who does the\n moving.[26] \nMatthew Hanser (1999) and Timothy Hall (2008) both argue that safety\nnet cases should not be classified as either doing or merely allowing\nharm. They fall into a third category. Hanser argues that this third\ncategory is ‘preventing people from being saved’ and it is\nconceptually distinct from both doing and allowing harm, but morally\nequivalent to merely allowing harm, other things being equal. Other\nthings are not equal i.e. preventing someone from being saved is worse\nthan merely allowing harm if the resources the victim needs in order\nto survive do not belong to the agent. The moral implications of\nHanser’s account are thus similar to those of McMahan’s\naccount. \nHall argues that safety net cases belong to the category\n‘denials of resources’ which are both conceptually and\nmorally distinct from standard doings and standard allowings. Hall\noffers three main arguments. First, he argues that previous analyses\nhave failed to show that allowing harm by denying resources has\nanything significant in common with allowing harm by failing to act.\nSecond, he argues that the moral status of denials of resources depend\nto a large extent on which person has a right to the resource in\nquestion while the moral status of standard doings and standard\nallowings does not. Third, he argues that constraints against standard\ndoings of harm and permissions for standard allowings of harm are\nrooted in pre-political personal rights but constraints and\npermissions regarding denials of resources are not.  \nRecent work raises another important challenge for defenders of the\nDoctrine of Doing and Allowing (see Persson 2013 and Hanna 2014,\n2015). The challenge is to provide an account of the moral status of\nallowing oneself to do or to have done harm. Consider:  \nPoisoner: Earlier this morning, Agent deposited a dose of lethal\npoison into a teapot from which one person drinks tea at the same time\neach afternoon. Unless Agent warns her potential victim now, he will\ndrink the tea and\n die.[27] \nSpasm: Agent feels the onset of a spasm in her finger. If she does not\nrepress the spasm, her finger will contract around the trigger,\nsetting off a gun, killing Vic (Persson 2013, 96). \nAs Hanna points out, failure to warn the potential poison victim would\nnot be killing, instead Agent would be failing to prevent her past\nbehavior from constituting killing (Hanna 2014, 679). She would be\nallowing herself to have killed. Similarly, failure to repress the\nspasm seems significantly different from normally killing. It is\nperhaps best characterized as letting oneself (non-intentionally) kill\n(Persson 2013, 96). \nBut is either allowing oneself to have done harm or allowing oneself\nto non-intentionally harm morally equivalent to doing harm? Persson\nsuggests that deciding the moral status of allowing oneself to have\ndone harm requires us to choose between a\n“present-self-focus”, which gives primary importance to\nwhat you do now, and a “self-other divide”, based on the\ndifference between your own agency and agency that is external to you\n(Persson 2013, 102–103). He argues that the neither of these is\nsatisfactory. The present-self focus is mysterious: “why should\nwhat we are doing at the present time have this special\nimportance?” (110). The self-other divide has “an air of\nrepulsive moral self-indulgence… why be especially concerned\nabout your own rights violations rather than the rights-violations of\nall people, in proportion to the stringency of the rights\nviolated?”\n (110).[28]\n Persson has similar worries about holding that letting yourself kill\nnow is harder to justify than “merely” letting die, even\nwhen the killing would not be intentional under any description. We\nmust place a lot of weight on whether a natural or non-intentional\ncause of death is external or internal to us. Persson challenges this\nidea: “The fact that a twitch is internal rather than external\nto us cannot make any moral difference” (Persson 2013, 105). \nHanna’s discussion of cases suggests that intuitively allowing\noneself to have done harm is neither morally equivalent to doing harm\nnor morally equivalent to merely allowing harm. Normally, if we face a\nchoice between merely allowing harm to one and merely allowing the\nsame harm to five, we should allow harm to one. However, if Agent\nfaces a choice between warning her potential poison victim and saving\nfive others from drowning, then intuitively, she is morally required\nto save the one potential poison victim. This suggests that allowing\noneself to have done harm is not morally equivalent to merely allowing\nharm (Hanna 2014, 678–9). If we face a choice between doing harm\nto one and doing the same harm to five, we should do harm to the one.\nBut suppose that Agent can give her warning and prevent the poisoning\nonly by driving down a narrow mountain path, which is blocked by the\nbody of an innocent, unconscious person. It seems impermissible for\nher to do so even if there are five people about to drink from the\npoisoned teapot. This suggests that allowing oneself to have done harm\nis not morally equivalent to doing harm (Hanna 2014, 681). This\nexacerbates the challenge for defenders of the Doctrine of Doing and\nAllowing for they must find a justification for treating the fact that\nthe Agent will be allowing herself to have done harm as somewhat\nmorally significant but not as so morally significant that it renders\nher current behaviour morally equivalent to doing\n harm.[29]\n In Persson’s terms, we seem to need to defend both the\nself-other divide and the present-self-focus. \nThe majority of work on the doing/allowing distinction has appealed to\nthe author or reader’s own intuitions about cases. However, some\nrecent work has used experimental data in relation to the\ndoing/allowing distinction. This is part of a wider phenomenon of use\nof empirical data in philosophy known as ‘X-Phi’.  \nThe most widely known use of empirical data in relation to the\ndoing/allowing distinction is Cushman et al’s (2008) study which\nthey claim shows that moral appraisals affect classification of\nbehaviour as doing or allowing. Cushman et al do not see this as\npresenting a special challenge for the doing/allowing distinction.\nThey see these findings as adding to “a growing list of folk\nconcepts influenced by moral appraisal, including causation and\nintentional action” concluding that: “the present finding\nfavors the view that moral appraisal plays a pervasive role in shaping\ndiverse cognitive representations across multiple domains”\n(Cushman et al 2008, 281). In contrast, Sinnott-Armstrong et al (2008)\nargue that their experimental data suggests that whether a bad effect\noccurs before or after an aimed at good effect influences whether\nbehavior is classified as killing, but prior moral judgments do not.\n \nBarry et al (2014) use empirical studies to support the 3rd\ncategory approach to safety net cases. They argue that empirical\nstudies show that removing a barrier to harm (enabling) is treated as\na distinct category, both morally and conceptually distinct from doing\nand allowing. Most philosophical work on the doing/allowing\ndistinction seeks to reflect something that is claimed to be part of\ncommonsense morality while noting that common intuitions about\nparticular cases could be incorrect. Given this, there are interesting\nquestions about how to respond to such empirical studies: does the\nfact that enabling is treated as a distinct category settle whether it\nis a distinct category for the purposes of the defender (or critic) of\nthe doing/allowing distinction?  \nThe early critics of the doing/allowing distinction focus on appealing\nto intuitions to cast doubt on the claim that commonsense morality\nattributes significance to the doing/allowing distinction. Rachels\n(1975) and Tooley (1972) offer contrast cases in which all other\nfactors are held constant and killing and letting die seem morally\nequivalent. Kamm (2007) and Frowe (2007) respond by arguing that we do\nnot treat these cases as morally equivalent, while Kagan (1988) and\nQuinn (1989) challenge the inference from the moral equivalence of the\ncases described to the general equivalence of doing and allowing in\ngeneral. \nThe next wave of critics argues that no account could both provide an\nanalysis of the distinction that matched our intuitive understanding\nof the distinction and was morally relevant (Bennett 1995, Kagan\n1989). Quinn(1989), Woollard (2015) Kamm (1996), amongst many others,\nattempt to respond to this challenge. \nRecent work has produced new challenges about how to account for the\nremoval of barriers (McMahan 1993, Rickless 2011, Hanser 1999, Hall\n2008), past behaviour (Persson 2013, Hanna 2014, 2015) and the\nsignificance of empirical research (Cushman et al 2008, Barry et al\n2014).
