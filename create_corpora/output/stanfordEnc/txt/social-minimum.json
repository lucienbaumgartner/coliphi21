They assert the\nimportance of what is often called the social\nminimum. However, the exact nature of the social minimum, the\nconsiderations that support it, and, indeed, its basic justifiability,\nare all matters of intense philosophical controversy.  The aim here is\nto provide a guide through the terrain of these controversies. This is\ndone in three stages. \n\n Firstly, in section 1, we look more\nclosely at the question, “What is a social minimum?” This\nsection introduces a number of basic distinctions that will serve to\nclarify the discussion. We define a “social minimum” as\nthat bundle of resources which suffices in the circumstances of a\ngiven society to enable someone to lead a minimally decent life. We\ndefine a “social minimum policy regime” as a set of\npolicies and institutions that serve to secure reasonable access to\nthis social minimum for all members of the society. As part of the\ntask of clarification in this section, we review some of the main\nphilosophical issues posed by these definitions. In particular, how\nare we to understand the notion of a “minimally decent\nlife”? \n\n In section 2, we then consider the\nquestion, “Why a social minimum?” Specifically, we outline\na range of influential theories of social justice, and we consider in\neach case whether and how the theory in question might lend support to\nthe enactment of a social minimum (that is, to the establishment of a\nsocial minimum policy regime). The theories considered include\nutilitarianism, libertarianism, left-libertarianism, egalitarian\nliberalism, and what we shall term democratic theories of social\njustice. \n\n In section 3, we then turn\nspecifically to the critics of enactment, posing the question\n“What can be said against enactment of a social minimum?”\nWe consider three sets of objections that appeal respectively to the\nvalues of individual freedom, fairness, and legitimacy. The objections\nare helpful in thinking about the form the social minimum should take\nand about the political procedures surrounding its enactment.  We\ninvestigate whether any of these objections offers a convincing reason\nagainst enactment of a social minimum.  Section 4\noffers a brief conclusion to our discussion.\n\n Our first task, then, is to clarify what a social minimum is. When\nwe speak of a “social minimum” we mean to refer to the\nbundle of resources that a person needs in order to lead a minimally\ndecent life in their society. Now the members of a given society\nmight decide to introduce a set of institutions and policies that\nsecures every member reasonable access to a social minimum in\nthis sense. We shall refer to this set of institutions and policies as\na “social minimum policy regime”. In the discussion that\nfollows we shall often speak of “enacting a social\nminimum”.  Enactment is a somewhat legalistic word, but we\nintend the term to be understood broadly here; “enacting a\nsocial minimum” means putting in place a social minimum policy\nregime. (Strictly speaking, we should perhaps speak of “enacting\na social minimum policy regime”; but “enacting a social\nminimum” is a less clumsy phrase, and these comments should\nsuffice to make clear what we mean by it.) These concepts—of the\nsocial minimum and of a social minimum policy regime—are\nintended to be quite abstract, and they clearly raise further\nquestions. In particular:   We shall now explore question (1) in sections\n1.1–1.3, turning to question (2) in\nsection 1.4.  In contemporary political philosophy there is a lot of discussion\nsurrounding what has come to known as the “Equality of\nwhat?” debate: If we assume that it is desirable for there to be\nequality between individuals, what should we\nbe fundamentally concerned to equalize? Since the positions\ntaken up in this debate have direct relevance to our concern with the\nnature of the social minimum, in this section we shall briefly review\nthese positions before returning explicitly to the question of how we\nmight define and specify the resources a person needs to lead “a\nminimally decent life in their society”.  The first position is known as welfarism.\n“Welfare” here is understood in one of two ways. In\nclassical utilitarian thinking, pioneered by Jeremy Bentham, welfare\nrefers to happiness which, in turn, is understood as the net balance\nof pleasure over pain that the individual experiences (Bentham\n1789). On this view, in assessing how well off someone is in life, we\nshould look at how happy he or she is, that is, at the net balance of\npleasure over pain in her life. In more recent economic writings,\nwelfare is identified with desire-satisfaction; people have more or\nless welfare, and so have better or worse lives in a fundamental\nsense, depending on how far they satisfy their desires.   Welfarism has been subject to compelling criticism in recent\nyears.  While we do not have the space here to review the critique of\nwelfarism in depth, two apparent problems may be noted. One is the\nproblem of adaptive preferences. If people are born into deprived\ncircumstances, then they might adjust their expectations so that they\nare satisfied with their lot. Even though they are poor, they are\nhappy, or don’t suffer from much frustration of desire, because\nthey have adapted to life in which they have few resources at their\ncommand. But, as Amartya Sen asks of a person in this situation, Can we possibly believe that he is doing well\njust because he is happy and satisfied?  Can the living standard of a\nperson be high if the life that he or she leads is full of\ndeprivation? (Sen 1987a: 8) Another problem, according to the critics, is\nthat it is wrong to think that all that has fundamental value in a\nhuman life is how much happiness or desire-satisfaction this life\ncontains. Being happy is a valuable achievement, to be sure; but\ncritics argue that it is hardly the only thing that matters, in a\nfundamental way, for how well our lives are going (Sen 1987b, 1992,\n1999, 2009: chapters 11–14).   These two thoughts have inspired a second position within the\n“Equality of what?” debate. Pioneered by the economist,\nAmartya Sen, this is known as the capability approach. Sen's\nanalysis starts with a definition of a person's well-being as\nconstituted by the “functionings” that he or she\nachieves:   … beings and doings [which]…can vary\nfrom such elementary things as being adequately nourished, being in\ngood health, avoiding escapable morbidity and premature mortality,\netc., to more complex achievements such as being happy, having\nself-respect, taking part in the life of the community, and so\non. (Sen 1992: 39)  Note that “functionings” here include welfarist\nconcerns, such as “being happy”, but are not confined to\nsuch concerns. A person's capability is then defined by Sen\nas his or her power to achieve functionings: “a set of vectors\nof functionings, reflecting the person's freedom to lead one type of\nlife or another” (Sen 1992: 40). On Sen's view, then, we should\nassess how well off a person is by looking at how far he or she\npossesses a range of important capabilities. These might include a\ncapability for welfare in either or both senses defined above, but\nwill not be restricted to this one capability.  The challenge for advocates of the capabilities approach, however,\nis then to explain which functionings and capabilities matter\nin a fundamental way. What capabilities ought to feature on our list\nwhen we come to make assessments of how well off people are relative\nto one another? The worry is that any list we draw up will reflect one\nrather specific, perhaps sectarian understanding of what gives value\nand meaning to life, an understanding that other people might\nreasonably reject. In short, the worry is that the capabilities\napproach will either be too abstract to be of any use, or else will be\ninsufficiently neutral as between different reasonable\nethical conceptions (conceptions, that is, of what gives value and\nmeaning to life).   This concern, combined with the aforementioned concerns about\nwelfarism, motivates the third position in the “Equality of\nwhat?” debate, known as resourcism. Resourcism reflects\nthe concern to try to find an appropriately neutral way of assessing\nthe respective advantage in life enjoyed by different people. The idea\nis that although reasonable people disagree about what gives life\nfundamental value and meaning, they can nevertheless agree that it is\nimportant to hold certain “all-purpose means” for the\npursuit of whatever plans of life they have (see, for example, Rawls\n1993: 187–190).   In the simplest imaginable version of resourcism, we might focus\nsolely on the level of income and/or wealth someone has in making a\njudgment about how well off he or she is, in a fundamental sense,\ncompared to others. However, this position is vulnerable to the\nobvious objection that two people with the same income and wealth can\nin fact have very unequal opportunities in life because of differences\nin their personal capacities. For example, a person with a physical\ndisability (e.g., which limits their mobility) will tend to be able to\ndo and be less, in terms of functionings, with a given amount of\nincome than someone without this disability. Health conditions and\ndisabilities tend to raise living expenses, so that sick and disabled\npeople need more income to achieve a way of life similar to that of\nothers. For this reason, resourcists such as Ronald Dworkin argue that\nwe need to include personal capacities in our account of resources\n(Dworkin 2000: chapters 1–2). According to Dworkin, a disabled\nperson with the same income/wealth as a non-disabled person actually\nhas fewer resources because the disability counts as a kind of\nresource deficit.   However, if the resourcist takes this step, he/she then must\nexplain how we decide what counts as a disability, and how we assess\nthe relative significance of disabilities for the purpose of making\noverall judgments about how well off one person is relative to\nanother. Now our intuitive judgments about what counts as a\ndisability, and of how significant various disabilities are, do seem\nto be guided by views we have about the central importance to a decent\nhuman life of specific functionings and capabilities. For example, why\ndo so many of us consider blindness to be a significant disability? Is\nit not because we have a clear sense of how being blind can impair a\nrange of capabilities that we consider important, such as the\ncapability to engage fully in the political life of the community, to\nengage with artistic endeavors, to keep on top of major cultural\nevents, and so on? The question mark hanging over the resourcist\nposition is whether, at the end of the day, it can really dispense\nwith judgments about the kind of “beings” and\n“doings” that make for a decent human life. If it does\nmake use of such judgments, then it is not as different to the\ncapabilities approach as it appears at first sight.   The problem with resourcism is that it looks\npotentially fetishistic (Sen 1992): it asks us, in its\nsimplest form, to focus on resource\nholdings—income/wealth—without considering what different\npeople can do or be in virtue of these holdings. The problem with the\ncapabilities approach is that it looks potentially sectarian:\nto avoid the problem of resource-fetishism, it asks us to consider\nwhether or not people have certain specific capabilities that are\nallegedly central to the good life, but there is then a danger of\nspecifying a list that some regard as too biased towards one ethical\ndoctrine or societal culture than another. One response to this\napparent dilemma is to try to develop a self-consciously\n“ecumenical” version of the capabilities approach.  Aware\nof the danger of sectarianism, the capabilities theorist seeks to\nidentify capabilities that seem genuinely important to people across a\nwide range of reasonable ethical doctrines and societal cultures; and\nhe/she seeks to find ways to make the application of the approach\nsensitive to ethical and cultural diversity. Such an approach offers\none way of elaborating what we mean by a social minimum: the resources\nnecessary for a person to lead a “minimally decent life in their\nsociety” can be understood as the resources necessary to hold a\nspecified range of ecumenically significant capabilities,\ntaking due account of the society's understanding of how these\ncapabilities are typically realized.   An approach of this kind has been developed in a number of recent\npapers by Martha Nussbaum (see especially Nussbaum 1990, 1992, 1999,\n2000, 2007). Nussbaum believes we can identify a set of vitally\nimportant capabilities by posing the question: What activities characteristically performed by\nhuman beings are so central that they seem constitutive of a life that\nis truly human? (Nussbaum 1999: 39) More concretely: What activities and related\ncapabilities seem important to us when we consider whether someone\nwho has undergone a major change in their capacities is still capable\nof a human life? What activities and related capabilities are\nimportant to people when they differentiate between the human and the\nnon-human (sub-human or superhuman) in, say, constructing stories?\nProceeding inductively through reflection on these questions,\nNussbaum claims to identify a range of “central human\nfunctional capabilities”, capabilities people must have if they\nare to be able to live a truly human life. These include (for more\ndetails, see Nussbaum 1999: 40–41):   Adopting this approach, then, we would elaborate the concept of\nthe social minimum by agreeing on a specific list of capabilities as\nnecessary to a “minimally decent life”, and by working out\nthe kinds and levels of resources that people need, in the context of\ntheir society, to have these capabilities to an adequate extent.  The\nabove list is clearly pitched at a high level of generality, and so it\nwill make sense in applying this approach to consider how the various\ncapabilities are typically manifested in the society in question. At\nthe same time, such a list arguably provides a safeguard against\nexcessive cultural relativism in thinking about the social minimum. If\nwe can see no way in which a given capability on the list is\nadequately satisfied for a given group in a society, then we must\nconclude that the society is denying these people the opportunity to\nlead a “minimally decent life”. The idea of the social\nminimum can in this way have some critical bite in evaluating existing\nsocial arrangements.  One important complicating factor must be noted here. Consider item\n(2) on Nussbaum's list, the capability for bodily health. What does it\nmean for people to have this capability to an adequate\nextent? There is, after all, probably no limit to how far a\nsociety could go in increasing this capability for its members by\ndevoting more and more of its resources to this end. At what point can\nwe say that it is doing enough? This is the problem of\nlimit-setting: the problem of determining in a fair way, and in a way\nthat has legitimacy for those concerned, just what level of coverage\nfor a given capability is satisfactory, given the commitment to ensure\nthat everyone has reasonable access to the resources necessary for a\nminimally decent life. We shall not consider this problem further\nhere, but rather return to it in section 3.3\nbelow; and, as we shall see, it may be that certain ideas developed by\nresourcist philosophers can help us in getting a handle on the\nproblem. (I am thinking in particular here of Ronald Dworkin's\nthought-experiment of the hypothetical insurance market which we shall\ndiscuss below in sections 2.4.2\nand 3.3.) Nussbaum's attempt to define a determinate list of key or basic\ncapabilities like the above is, however, controversial. Critics object\nthat the approach is too rooted in a theorist's specific vision of\nwhat is valuable in a human life, and that it may therefore be not\nsensitive enough to reasonable differences of view (for discussion,\nsee Robeyns 2005, 2006). Similar approaches to Nussbaum's, which\nemploy the notion of “human needs”, have similarly\ncontroversial elements (see especially Doyal and Gough\n1991).[1] But\nsome disagreement of this kind seems unavoidable when we try to\nspecify a standard for judging whether people enjoy a “minimally\ndecent life”. Along with the problem of limit-setting, this\ncreates a potential problem of political legitimacy in the\nspecification and enactment of the social minimum to which we shall\nreturn below (see section 3.3). An important\nchallenge in practice is to steer a course between an overly\nprescriptive listing of desirable capabilities by, say, academic\nphilosophers and an overly subjective listing that might be prone to\nproblems such as adaptive preferences (for helpful discussions, see\nRobeyns 2005, 2006, and Wolff and De-Shalit 2007).  We have said that a social minimum is the bundle of resources\nnecessary for someone to live a minimally decent life in their\nsociety. This raises the question of how far the resources we\nneed to live a minimally decent life are affected by the general level\nof opulence of the society in which we live.  Is the social minimum\nhigher in societies that are wealthier on average than others? This\nquestion is closely related to a question that has long exercised\nstudents of income and wealth distribution: Is poverty a matter of\nabsolute income/wealth, or of relative income/wealth? Many studies of\npoverty assume that poverty has a relative dimension (for example,\nTownsend 1979). So, for example, in the UK estimates of the number of\nhouseholds in poverty often take as the poverty line a level of income\nthat is some fraction (say 50%) of average household income, adjusted\nfor differences in household size (see, for example, Oppenheim\n1997). Thus, if the incomes of the poor at time t2\nare the same as they were at time t1, and in this\ntime average income has increased, then on this approach we would have\nto conclude that the people who were poor at t1\nhave become even poorer at t2even though\ntheir absolute income level has not changed. This clearly makes\nsense only if one thinks that poverty is a matter of how well off\npeople are in income/wealth terms relative to others in their\nsociety. However, this way of thinking about poverty invites the\naccusation that the researcher is confusing poverty with\ninequality. Critics argue that if one group has become worse off in\nincome/wealth terms relative to others then inequality has increased,\nbut this does not mean that poverty has, especially if the group in\nquestion remains just as well off as before in terms of its absolute\nlevel of income and/or wealth.   The ecumenical-capabilities approach outlined above offers\nreasonable support for the claim that the social minimum does vary\nwith a society's average level of income/wealth, and in turn, for the\nclaim that poverty can increase when a group falls further behind the\nrest of society in terms of its relative income.  Following Sen,\ncapabilities theorists argue that even if the capabilities that define\na minimally decent life remain basically the same across societies of\nvarying degrees of wealth, the resources needed to have a given\ncapability will be greater, in the case of some capabilities, the\nricher one's society is. In other words, the resource cost of a given\ncapability will tend to increase with average income. According to\nSen: To lead a life without shame, to be able to visit\nand entertain one's friends, to keep track of what is going on and\nwhat others are talking about…requires a more expensive bundle\nof goods and services in a society that is generally richer, and in\nwhich most people have, say, means of transport, affluent clothing,\nradios or television sets, etc.. (Sen 1987a: 18) For this reason at least, the level and content\nof the social minimum in a given society will to some extent be\nrelative to the productivity of this society; and, accordingly, it\nwill make sense to define the poverty line in relation to (as some\nfraction of) average income.  One idea that plays a particularly important role in discussions\nof this issue is that of self-respect. People have an interest in\n(capability for) self-respect (on which, see Rawls 1971 [1999]:\n386–391). But, so the argument runs, our self-respect depends on\nour being able to maintain a style of life that is sufficiently\nsimilar to that of our fellow citizens. We will perhaps look inferior,\nand start to feel inferior, if we do not wear the sort of clothes that\nour fellow citizens wear, go on the kind of holidays they do, and so\non.  If self-respect depends on relative consumption in this way, and\n“a minimally decent life” is one that includes our being\nable to enjoy self-respect, then the social minimum is properly seen\nas being relative to average income and the levels of consumption that\ncan be sustained on this level of income.  On the other hand, there is almost certainly a lower limit to this\nrelativity. If the average income level in a society is very low\nindeed, then even people with high income in relation to this average\nmight well lack the resources needed to lead a minimally decent\nlife. For example, if people in a given society cannot eat well enough\nto avoid malnutrition on an income that is twice the societal average,\nthen even some people who are relatively rich in this society will\nstill be living below the level of the social minimum.   Let us imagine that we have settled on an acceptable definition of\nwhat is necessary for a person to enjoy a “minimally decent life\nin their society”. We now wish to enact a social minimum to\nensure that all members of our society have reasonable access to the\nresources necessary to lead such a life. A key term here is\n“reasonable access”. What is meant by this term? Why not\nsay simply that society should ensure that its members have the\nresources they need to lead a minimally decent life? Why take this\napparently roundabout way of expressing things by saying that they\nought to have reasonable access to such resources, rather than the\nresources themselves?  We use this formulation so as to keep open at this stage some\nimportant questions as to the terms on which people may/ought to\nreceive these resources.  It is tempting to think of enacting a social\nminimum as introducing institutions and policies that\nwill give people the resources necessary to lead a minimally\ndecent life in their society. However, this is surely too restrictive\nan understanding of what it can mean to enact a social minimum. To see\nwhy, consider the following case. There is an individual, called Alf,\nwho is unemployed and hence unable to buy food and shelter. As things\nstand, Alf lacks the resources necessary to lead a minimally decent\nlife; he is living, as we might say, below the social\nminimum. However, the government responds to his plight by offering\nhim a job with a wage equal to the level of the social minimum. Now,\nprovided that Alf is able to work, and the work in question is not\ndemeaning or punitive, or the terms of employment otherwise unfair, we\ncould reasonably say that if the government does this for all those in\nAlf's position then it has enacted a social minimum.  But clearly it\nhas not given Alf and others like him a social minimum.\nRather, it has intervened in a way that provides Alf and others like\nhim with reasonable access to the social minimum.  Now it might be that in some cases—perhaps, in the majority\nof cases—the most appropriate way to ensure reasonable access to\nthe social minimum is precisely to give people the resources in\nquestion. If, say, Alf is simply unable to work, then offering him the\njob will not provide reasonable access to the social minimum. It will\nbe appropriate just to give him the social minimum. And, as we shall\nsee below (see section 3.2), some philosophers\nargue that the ethically most defensible policy is to give everybody a\nsocial minimum, rather than conditioning the social minimum on work or\nsome other kind of behavior. However, this is just one view of the\nform that the social minimum policy regime should take, and it would\nbe inappropriate to build this very specific view into our very\ndefinition of what a social minimum policy regime is, and thus, of\nwhat it means to enact a social minimum. The substantive ethical\ndebate about the desirability of\n“conditionality”—making resources conditional on\nbehaviour, such as work-related activity—is one we shall return\nto below (see section 3.2).  Hopefully, we have now clarified what a social minimum is and what\nit means to enact a social minimum. These clarificatory concerns met,\nwe can now consider why we might want to enact a social\nminimum. As noted in the introduction, we shall review a number of\ninfluential theories of social justice asking, with respect to each\ntheory, what support (if any) it can give to the case for\nenactment. The five theories to be reviewed are: utilitarianism;\nlibertarianism; left-libertarianism; egalitarian liberalism; and\ndemocratic theories of social justice.  Utilitarianism is the view that actions and institutions should be\njudged on how far they produce welfare (or “utility”) for\npeople (or for all beings capable of experiencing welfare). In its\nclassical form, utilitarianism demands that social institutions be\narranged so as to maximize the sum total of happiness, understood as\npleasure net of pain, while in its more contemporary version it calls\nfor these institutions to maximize the sum total of\ndesire-satisfaction.  In calculating this total, utilitarianism\ninsists on a principle of equality: each person's utility counts\nequally with that of every other person (Mill 1861).  In states such as the UK, utilitarianism has been a major\ninspiration for reformers concerned to establish a welfare state so as\nto enact a social minimum. It is not hard to see why. Imagine a\nsociety that leaves the distribution of income to the market so that\nincomes are distributed very unequally. Let's say we think that there\nis some level of income, Y, which people typically need to lead a\nminimally decent life. The inequality in this society is such that\nsome people have income levels below Y. However, it is possible for\nthe government to introduce tax-transfer schemes that will guarantee\nthat the poorest members of a society have reasonable access to Y. Now\nif the marginal utility of income diminishes as people get more\nincome, then it seems quite likely that the shift from the free-market\neconomic system to the system with the social minimum policy regime\nwill produce a net gain in society's overall utility. Quite simply,\nthe income that the poor gain as a result of the shift to the social\nminimum system is likely to be greater than the utility lost by the\nrich in moving to this system (given the assumption of\nthe diminishing marginal utility of income).  Clearly, given\nthat the utilitarian focus is on welfare as the good in human life, a\nutilitarian conception of the social minimum will be welfarist in\nkind: the social minimum will be seen as the bundle of resources\nnecessary to ensure a life with a minimally acceptable level of\nhappiness or desire-satisfaction.  However, as a matter of policy, a\nutilitarian might readily support enactment of a social minimum\ninspired by some version of the capabilities approach because, for the\nreason given above, he/she judges the social minimum policy package in\nquestion as promoting an increase in aggregate welfare. (For a\ndiscussion of the utilitarian rationale for enactment of a social\nminimum, see Brandt 1981.)  From a utilitarian point of view, however, the foregoing argument\nfor the enactment of some form of social minimum is not\nconclusive. There are arguments that can be made from within the\nutilitarian framework that would tell against enactment of a social\nminimum (whether conceived in capabilities or welfarist terms).   The main utilitarian argument against enactment of a social\nminimum appeals to the idea of incentives. The argument\nbegins with the claim that if we make a shift from a free-market\neconomic system to a system with a social minimum policy regime, we\nwill reduce incentives to work, save and be entrepreneurial.  The rich\nwill allegedly work less hard, save less and be less entrepreneurial,\nbecause they are being more heavily taxed to pay for the social\nminimum policy regime. The poor will allegedly work less hard, save\nless, and so on, because they have a welfare safety-net to fall back\non. As a result of this dampening of incentives, it is possible that\neconomic growth will be slower under the economic system with the\nsocial minimum policy regime than under the free-market system. In the\nlong-run, slower economic growth might well result in lower aggregate\nwelfare in the system with the social minimum policy regime than in\nthe free-market system. If so, then as utilitarians, we\nmust not enact a social minimum. The incentives concern\nexplains why Nineteenth century utilitarian reformers in Britain, such\nas Edwin Chadwick, had grave reservations about enacting a social\nminimum. While conceding the necessity of some kind of safety-net for\nthe very poor, Chadwick proposed that state assistance to the poor be\nset at a very low level and provided on deliberately punitive\nterms. These principles lay behind the New Poor Law of 1834 which\nrequired many recipients of assistance to live and work in\ngender-segregated special workhouses, rather like prisons, in return\nfor a meager subsistence income (see Roberts 1960: 36–45, on\nEdwin Chadwick's role in designing the New Poor Law; and see Hamburger\n1965, for a discussion of Chadwick's intellectual context).   In view of the plausible assumption that there is diminishing\nmarginal utility of income, utilitarianism can be said to offer strong\nsupport for the enactment of some form of a social minimum. However,\nin view of the possible impact of an enacted social minimum on\nincentives, it also can be said only to offer contingent support for\nenactment: in some societies, at some times, maximization of aggregate\nwelfare will demand that we do not enact a social minimum.  If utilitarianism's criterion of justice is aggregate welfare,\nlibertarianism's is individual rights. Individuals are\n“inviolable”: they have rights, and these rights may not\nbe violated even for the sake of increasing aggregate\nwelfare—indeed, even for the sake of preventing the wider\nviolation of rights (Nozick 1974: 28–35).   If we ask exactly what rights the individual has, on the\nlibertarian view, then a large part of the answer is that he or she is\nendowed with the rights of self-ownership. Someone enjoys\nself-ownership, in the relevant sense, when he or she has full private\nownership of his or her own body and abilities; that is, he or she\nhas, in relation to his or her own body and abilities, all those\nrights which a slave-holder has in relation to the body and abilities\nof a slave (Cohen 1995: 68). A corollary of the idea of self-ownership\nis the idea that individuals do not have any non-contractual\nobligations to use their labor for the benefit of others. In\nexercising their rights of self-ownership, people may contract with\nothers to offer them specified services and benefits. But if the state\nforces people to provide such services and benefits without the\nconsent of the individuals concerned, it violates their rights of\nself-ownership.  It would, so the argument runs, treat the individuals\nconcerned as if they are state-owned assets, to be pressed\ninto service for the good of others at the state's discretion. Now, in\norder to enact a social minimum, it seems likely that the state will\nhave to impose a non-contractual obligation on more talented citizens\nto share the fruits of their labors with the less fortunate who are\notherwise at risk of falling below the level of the social\nminimum. But this violates the self-ownership rights of the\ntalented. For this reason, libertarianism looks like an unpromising\nbasis on which to defend enactment of a social minimum. However, things are not quite so clear-cut. Return to the question\nof exactly what rights individuals have on the libertarian view. The\nconcept of self-ownership provides a large part of, but cannot provide\nthe whole, answer to this question. For the world does not only\ncontain people, but a wide variety of external resources, such as\nland. What kind of rights do we have in relation to these other\nresources? If we believe that individuals can come to have private\nproperty rights in these resources, no less inviolable than those they\nhave in relation to their own bodies and abilities, we need to know\nhow the individuals concerned acquire these property rights. Part of\nthe answer is that if we acquire a resource through voluntary exchange\nwith someone who already owns it (legitimately), then we come to own\nthe resource (an aspect of what Nozick calls “justice in\ntransfer”; Nozick 1974: 150–153). But if we trace the\nhistory of such trades back there will be a point at which the\nresource in question did not have an owner; someone, somehow, made an\nunowned resource—a piece of land, say—their private\nproperty. But how can this happen? In Robert Nozick's terms, the\nlibertarian must given an account of “justice in\nacquisition” (Nozick 1974: 151, 174–182).  The nature of justice in acquisition is a source of controversy\namongst libertarians. Assuming that the external resources we have in\nmind are initially unowned, one might argue that specific individuals\ncan appropriate resources as private property by “mixing”\ntheir self-owned powers with the resources concerned. This thought,\nwhich we find in the work of John Locke (Locke 1689: Book 2, chapter\n5), is that individuals annex something they already own (their labor)\nto something initially unowned (say, a piece of land), and, thereby,\ncome to own what they initially did not own. However, some\nlibertarians, such as Nozick, follow Locke in arguing that\nappropriation through the exercise of self-owned powers is\njust only if it does not harm those who, following\nappropriation, lose access to the resource. This condition (often\nreferred to as the Lockean Proviso) can be elaborated in\nvarious ways. In Nozick's influential statement of the libertarian\nview, the condition is apparently elaborated as follows (see Nozick\n1974: 174–182; and, for helpful interpretation, Wolff 1991:\n107–115): an act of appropriation of a previously unowned\nresource is just only if no person is thereby made worse off than he\nor she would be in a world where all external resources remain\nunowned.  In a world in which all external resources remain unowned,\neach person would be able to reach a certain level of welfare by using\nthe resources that lie about unowned. For any given\nindividual, i, let us denote this welfare level simply\nas Wi. A given act of appropriation is just, then,\nprovided that, post-appropriation, each individual remains able to\nreach Wi. (Note that Wi may\ndiffer between particular individuals because of their unequal\nabilities to succeed in the “state of nature” in which all\nexternal resources remain unowned.)  The implication of this account of justice in acquisition is that\nany regime of private property rights is just only provided that every\nperson living under said regime is able to\nachieve Wi—the welfare level that he or she\nwould have been able to achieve in a world in which all external\nresources remain unowned. Many libertarians, including Nozick, express\noptimism that a private property regime will be able to provide people\nwith the opportunity to achieve this welfare level. But it is\nconceivable that in the normal operation of the economy, a private\nproperty regime might at some times, for some people, fail to provide\naccess to this level of welfare. If so, then justice—as the\nlibertarian understands it—demands that the state act to correct\nthe distribution of welfare generated by the spontaneous play of\nmarket forces. Specifically, the state must compensate anyone who, due\nto the existing allocation of private property rights in external\nresources, cannot otherwise achieve Wi. According\nto at least one influential libertarian philosopher, Robert Nozick,\nour basic rights include not only our rights of self-ownership, but\nthis right to welfare as well.  In order to satisfy this right, a libertarian system might have to\nrun some assistance programs for the very poor. To some extent, then,\neven a libertarian state might have some government programs that\nresemble those we associate with a social minimum policy regime. It\nis in this very limited sense that even a libertarian theory of\njustice might lend support to the enactment of at least a partial\nsocial minimum (see also the discussion in Brock 1998a and Sterba\n1998).[2]  That said, it is highly unlikely that this argument can be used to\nsupport the enactment of anything like a full social minimum. This is\nso for at least two reasons. Firstly, for most, if not all,\npeople Wi is likely to be very low, precisely\nbecause it is the welfare level we could get in a world with no\nproperty rights regime to stabilize expectations about the use of\nresources and, therefore, a world without the huge productivity gains\nthat come from stabilizing such expectations. Hence, the level of\nassistance entailed by the libertarian right to welfare is likely in\ngeneral to fall well short of what is needed to ensure people the\ncapabilities for a “minimally decent life” in their\nsociety. Secondly, it is important to recall\nthat Wi will almost certainly vary across people\naccording to the nature of their personal, self-owned capacities.\nThose who are born with a good endowment of productively applicable\ntalents will obviously fare better in the state of nature, in which\nall external resources remain unowned, than, for example, those who\nare born with severe disabilities that make it impossible for them to\nengage in production. In the case of some of the\nlatter, Wi may be close to zero—zero\ndenoting the outcome of starving to death in the state of\nnature. Thus, if these people happen to be unfortunate enough to be\nstarving to death in a real-world private property rights regime, they\nmay well have no claim to assistance under the libertarian right to\nwelfare: this right does not demand that they be prevented from\nstarving if this is what would have happened to them in the baseline\nworld in which all external resources remain unowned.   We may conclude that libertarianism gives only contingent and very\nweak support for the enactment of a social minimum. Indeed, except in\nsome very rare instances, libertarianism implies that enactment of a\nfull social minimum is unjust.  However, not all libertarians—those who endorse the\nprinciple of self-ownership—agree with the theory of acquisition\nthat we find in writers like Nozick.  According to some philosophers,\nsometimes referred to as left-libertarians, the principle of\nself-ownership should be combined with a more egalitarian principle of\ndivision of initially unowned external resources. Thus, if we imagine\na group of people who find themselves transported to a previously\nuninhabited planet, the left-libertarian holds that each of these\npeople has the rights of self-ownership plus a right to an\nequal, per capita share of this planet's initially unowned external\nresources (see, for example, Steiner 1994, and Vallentyne and Steiner\n2000a,b).   There is a lively debate amongst left-libertarians as to which\ngoods count as external resources for purposes of equal division, but\nvirtually all would agree that these resources must include society's\ninheritance of land. Some would argue that the pool of resources for\nequal division should also include the capital stock that one\ngeneration inherits from past generations. More recently, it has been\nsuggested that “job assets” and the value of the genetic\ninformation that we carry as individuals should also be included in\nthe pool for equal division (see, respectively, Van Parijs\n1992, 1995, and\nSteiner, 1994).[3]  Now, for those anxious about the lot of the poor in a market\nsociety, left-libertarianism seems to hold more promise than\nconventional libertarianism. To be sure, a left-libertarian regime\nwill not permit the redistribution of labor incomes by the state as\nthis violates the core libertarian commitment to respect the rights of\nself-ownership. But the parallel commitment to equal division of\ninitially unowned external resources will ensure that every person\nstarts life with at least some external resources, or a monetary\nequivalent. To see how this may transform the prospects of the\nunfortunate, it may help to go back for a moment to the people whom we\njust imagined being transported to a new planet. On arrival, the\npeople find that on the planet there is a single external resource,\nuncultivated land, all units of which are of homogeneous\nquality. Their own population is divided into two groups, a majority\nwho are productively capable and a minority who suffer disabilities\nthat make them unable to engage in production (here we follow Cohen\n1995: chapter 4). Now we saw in our discussion of libertarianism above\nhow, under a Nozick-style regime, members of the minority might well\nhave no justice-based claim to assistance against the productively\ncapable, and, in consequence, could starve. Under a left-libertarian\nregime, however, the government is obliged to give each person an\nequal share of the planet's land. Those unable to engage in productive\nactivity would be able to sell or lease their share to members of the\nproductively capable group, and would derive an income from this\nsource.  They will thus be at less risk of starvation than under the\nNozick-style regime.   In practice, left-libertarians do not propose that we actually\ndivide land and other resources up in this literal way. Instead,\nfollowing the argument of agrarian radicals such as Thomas Spence and\nTom Paine, they argue that the individual should receive a monetary\ngrant reflecting his or her fair share of society's external\nresources, such as land (on Spence and Paine, see Vallentyne and\nSteiner 2000b). The level of this grant will depend on a host of\nfactors, but it is possible that it will be equivalent—or even\nhigher—in value to the bundle of resources needed to enjoy a\nminimally decent life in the society in question. Thus, depending on\nthe circumstances of the society in question, left-libertarian\nprinciples of justice might support a policy that is more or less\nequivalent to the enactment of a full social minimum. Nevertheless, it is clearly important to emphasize the word\n“might” in the previous sentence. There is no reason why\nthe basic grant we have imagined must be of equivalent value\nto a full social minimum. Indeed, if the relevant external assets are\nabundant, so that their market price is low, then the level of the\ngrant might not come anywhere near this level. In such a situation,\nrespect for self-ownership will rule out taking labor incomes to top\nup the grant. It is possible, therefore, that some people will be left\nwith a level of resources below that necessary to lead a minimally\ndecent life (see Cohen 1995: chapter 4, especially\npp. 102–105). Thus, while left-libertarianism offers stronger\nsupport for enactment of a social minimum than conventional\nlibertarianism does, this support is still highly contingent, and in\nmany situations left-libertarianism will probably rule out as unjust\nthe course of action needed to enact a full social minimum (taxation\nof labor incomes).  Moreover, even if the resource grant is high\nenough to provide a full social minimum, some left-libertarians would\nargue that individuals should receive their basic grant as a capital\nlump-sum at the start of their adult life rather than as a periodic\nincome payment and/or as freely available bundle of\nservices.[4]\nThis raises the possibility that some people might “blow”\ntheir grants early in their adult lives and might then lack ready\naccess to a social minimum.  Within contemporary political philosophy, egalitarian liberalism\nseeks to present an alternative both to utilitarianism and to the two\nversions of libertarianism discussed above. Egalitarian liberals agree\nwith libertarians that utilitarianism fails to take seriously the\ninviolability of the person. Unlike libertarians, however, egalitarian\nliberals do not think that respect for the inviolability of the person\ncommits us to the principle of self-ownership (for more on this issue,\nsee section 3.1.2 below). Consequently, they\nfeel much less compunction in advocating tax-transfer schemes, which\nthe libertarian finds objectionable, so as to secure a full social\nminimum. Indeed, they argue that justice demands that we do introduce\nsuch schemes. Let us take a brief look at two particularly influential\negalitarian liberal theories of justice, and their implications for\nthe justifiability of enacting a social minimum.  John Rawls's A Theory of Justice, first published in 1971\n(with a revised edition in 1999) poses an intriguing question: What\nprinciples would you accept to govern your society if you did not know\nyour actual or likely position in this society? In practice, we are\nall aware of the religion we have, we have some sense of the natural\nabilities we have been born with, and the advantages or disadvantages\nwe have gained from our social background. But, for a moment, envisage\nthat we did not know such things and possessed only very general\ninformation about the kind of society we are going to live in. Behind\nthis “veil of ignorance”, not knowing our religion,\nnatural ability, or social background, what principles would we choose\nto govern the institutions that affect the distribution of\n“primary goods” like income and wealth?   Famously, Rawls argues that in an “original position”\nof this kind, people would choose to arrange social and economic\ninequalities so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the\nleast advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all\nunder conditions of fair equality of opportunity. (Rawls 1971 [1999]:\n72) Simplifying somewhat, part (a) of this\nformulation tells us that inequality in goods like income and wealth\nis just only if, as a result of the inequality, the social group that\nis worst-off in terms of these goods is better off than it would\notherwise be; Rawls calls this the difference\nprinciple.[5]  Many critics have found Rawls's argument for the difference\nprinciple unconvincing (see, for example, Kymlicka 2001:\n60–70). They ask why people behind the veil of ignorance would\nnot choose to gamble, selecting an alternative principle that is less\nfavorable to the disadvantaged in society than the difference\nprinciple but which would give higher rewards than this principle\nshould one turn out in fact to belong to one of the more favored\nsocial classes. However, even if this is valid as a criticism of\nRawls's argument for the difference principle, it can be argued that\nRawls's thought experiment nevertheless provides strong intuitive\nsupport for those who believe that justice requires at least the\nenactment of a social minimum. For while most people placed behind the\nveil of ignorance might not be so risk averse as to choose the\ndifference principle to govern their society, it is reasonable to\nsuppose that most would at least be concerned to insure themselves\nagainst the danger of desperate poverty and would hence desire\nprinciples of justice that ensure everyone reasonable access to a\nsocial minimum. Interestingly, efforts by psychologists to model\ndecision-making in situations akin to the original position show that\npeople in practice tend to choose a principle that calls for the\nmaximization of average well-being subject to the constraint that\nnobody falls below a specified floor (see Frolich and Oppenheimer\n1992).   Further support for the enactment of a social minimum from within\nRawls's theory comes from his discussion of the importance of the\n“strains of commitment” in determining what is just (Rawls\n1971 [1999]: 153–160). The parties behind the veil of ignorance\nmust recognize that they are selecting principles of justice that,\nhaving been chosen, they must stick with in social life for\ngood. Thus, before they make their decision, they must honestly ask\nwhether, should they turn out to be the most disadvantaged by a chosen\nset of principles, they could really bear the strains of commitment\nentailed by living under these principles.  Again, it is debatable as\nto whether this consideration points unequivocally to the difference\nprinciple as the appropriate principle to govern the distribution of\nincome and wealth. However, it seems plausible that this consideration\nwould rule out any principles that would not ensure everyone\nreasonable access to the resources needed for a minimally decent\nlife. How could one honestly commit to the strains of living in a\nsociety that did not guarantee you this? This consideration reinforces\nthe argument that the parties behind the veil of ignorance would\nchoose principles of justice that assure everyone of reasonable access\nto a social minimum.   Moreover, it might be argued that even if one rejects the veil of\nignorance thought experiment as a way of exploring what justice\nconsists in, the strains of commitment idea still has force as a\nconsideration favoring the enactment of a social minimum. Even if one\nhas full knowledge of one's own and others’ position in society,\none can put oneself in the place of others and consider the kind of\nstrains of commitment that they are likely to be suffering under the\npresent system. If one does this, can one really give assent to a\nsocial system that, by failing to guarantee reasonable access to a\nsocial minimum for some people, puts some of your fellow citizens\nunder what must be intolerable strains of commitment? Since one would\nsurely find such strains intolerable oneself, how can one reasonably\nexpect others to put up with them? (For more discussion of the strains\nof commitment, see Barry 1995: 61–67, and, with specific\nconnection to case for the social minimum, see Waldron 1993a).   Ronald Dworkin's theory of “equality of resources”\n(see especially Dworkin 1985, 2000) starts from a simple intuition: ideally, no person\nshould have a smaller share of resources than another except as a\nresult of the life-style choices that he or she makes.   As a first step in elaborating this conception of justice, Dworkin\nasks us to imagine a group of people who find themselves shipwrecked\non a previously uninhabited island. The island contains various\nexternal resources—trees, streams, land, and so on. How should\nthese external resources be divided up amongst the newly arrived\nislanders? Here Dworkin introduces the idea of an initial\nauction (Dworkin 2000: 65–71). We imagine that each\nislander is given an equal share of money (“clamshells”\nserve as currency) and is then allowed to bid for the island's\nresources in an auction. The auction ends only when every participant,\npossessed of equal purchasing power, is satisfied with the resources\nthat he or she has bought at the prices offered. Each islander is then\nentitled to the specific bundle of resources that he or she has\npurchased. The resulting distribution does not reflect any inequality\nof endowments because each islander had the same allocation of money\nwith which to buy resources. At the same time, the distribution is\nsensitive to individuals’ life-style choices because the\nspecific resources that people have in their bundles will reflect the\nchoices they have made about how to spend their (equal) endowments of\nmoney. Up to this point, Dworkin's theory is strikingly similar to\nthat of the left-libertarians we discussed above: he is, in effect,\nasserting the right of each person to an equal, marketable share of\nsociety's stock of inherited resources.  However, Dworkin does not stop at this point. People who share\nequally in society's inheritance of external resources can\nnevertheless be very unequal in terms of the productive talents and\n'handicaps' they have. But how are we to determine the appropriate\nlevel of transfers for these kinds of personal disadvantage?  Here\nDworkin introduces the original idea of a hypothetical insurance\nmarket (Dworkin 2000: 76–83, 92–99). In real life,\nmany of us are able to anticipate potential bad luck by taking out\ninsurance against eventualities like theft or damage to our\nproperty. What if we could also take out insurance against having\nlimited marketable talent or a serious health condition or\ndisability?  In practice, of course, we can’t do this. But imagine that\nthe islanders we have been considering do not yet know their\nmarketable talent or health status, though they do know the\ndistribution of earnings power and health conditions and disabilities\nacross the population. In this situation (which embodies something\nakin to Rawls's veil of ignorance), an insurance market would be\nfeasible. Insurance companies could offer the islanders insurance\nagainst low earnings power, for example, and, using their equal\ninitial shares of wealth, the individual islanders could buy the\ninsurance policies they want.  Each will have to decide whether they\nwant to spend a large portion of their initial wealth on an expensive\ninsurance policy that will provide very generous transfers should they\nturn out to have low earning power or a severe health condition, or\nwhether they prefer to risk taking out a cheap insurance policy that\nwill provide minimal transfers in these situations, but which will\nalso leave them with a lot more of their initial wealth to spend on\nother things.  According to Dworkin, the just level of transfers is\nthe level determined by the insurance policy that each of us would\nchoose in an insurance market of this kind. Dworkin acknowledges that,\nin practice, we cannot possibly know exactly what level each\nindividual would choose to insure themselves at. But he claims that we\nshould be able to make a realistic assessment of the insurance package\nthat “the average member of the community [would]\npurchase” (Dworkin 2000: 78–79). He suggests that we then\nuse this as the standard for designing tax-benefit policies that\naddress problems such as low earnings power, unemployment, sickness\nand disability. The average person is likely, Dworkin argues, to\ninsure themselves to a level that will assure them of a reasonable\nstandard of living should they turn out to be in one of these\nsituations.  Thus, to simulate the outcome of this fair, hypothetical\ninsurance market, our own society ought to enact tax-transfer schemes\nthat offer protection against these eventualities.  Now the idea of a social minimum does not play any role as such in\nDworkin's theory (and, as a self-proclaimed “resourcist”\nhe would have objections to the capabilities approach to specifying\nthe social minimum that we explored in\nsection 1). Nevertheless, the\nthought-experiment of the hypothetical insurance market provides us\nwith a strong argument for why we ought to enact something like a\nfull social minimum. The fact that, in the fair circumstances of the\nhypothetical insurance market, we would typically take out insurance\nagainst contingencies such as low earnings power, unemployment,\nsickness and disability, suggests that fairness requires our society\nto enact policies that provide protection against these\ncontingencies; and this set of policies will look very much like a\nsocial minimum policy regime geared to securing key\ncapabilities.[6]  The common thought at work in Rawls's and Dworkin's theories is\nthat in circumstances that appropriately reflect the equal standing of\neach person, people will agree to policies that effectively enact a\nsocial minimum (Dworkin), or to principles that call for such policies\n(Rawls). Thus, both theories seem to offer what we may term principled\nsupport for the enactment of a social minimum. According to\negalitarian liberalism, the enactment of a social minimum is not a\ncontingent, but pretty much an essential, demand of justice.  We use the term democratic here to refer to perspectives in social\nphilosophy that give self-conscious priority to the promotion of\nequality in power and status relations (understood, let us assume, as\na demand of justice; see Anderson 1999). One focus of concern is with\nensuring the fair value and effectiveness of citizens’\npolitical liberties. In a political democracy, all citizens have\nrights to vote, to campaign, and to stand for political office in\ncompetitive elections (Dahl 1998). It seems clear that poverty can\nsignificantly diminish the effectiveness with which individuals can\nexercise these rights. Someone who is wrapped up in the struggle for\nbasic material well-being may simply lack the time and energy needed\nto focus on political issues. In addition, he or she will be less\nable to afford the monetary costs associated with political\nparticipation, e.g., paying party membership fees, making campaign\ncontributions, and so on. This is bad for political democracy. It\nmeans that certain viewpoints and interests are not heard, so that\npolicy becomes unfairly skewed against these viewpoints and\ninterests. Or it may increase the danger that some people vote\nwithout taking the time to be well informed about the issues, which\nwill also reduce the quality of policy decisions. Hence it can be\nargued that it is straightforwardly good for a political democracy to\nenact a social minimum. By relieving the pressure of poverty, an\nenacted social minimum will enable all citizens to participate\neffectively in the democratic process, thereby ensuring that this\nprocess is indeed genuinely\ndemocratic.[7] Power is not only exercised within and through the formal political\nprocess, however, but within and through a wide range of other social\nrelationships. For example, employers can exercise power over their\nemployees. Historically, husbands have often wielded great power over\ntheir wives. These power relations need not be expressly established\nand defined in law. Very often, they arise because of inequalities in\nthe economic positions between the parties (for very helpful\ndiscussions, to which we are here indebted, see Goodin\n1986, 1988; Okin 1989:\nchapter 7). One party—the employer, the husband—may be\nable to do perfectly well economically without the other party. By\ncontrast, the second party—an individual worker, the\nwife—may be economically reliant on the first party.  Were the\nfirst party to exit from the relationship, this party would suffer\nlittle harm, but the second party would suffer a severe, possibly\ncatastrophic, fall in living standards. Precisely because of this\ninequality in the costs of exiting from the relationship, the first\nparty has the power to shape the relationship on their terms. The\nworker/wife is not in a position to argue with the\nemployer's/husband's commands because the employer's/husband's threat\nto leave the relationship unless obedience is forthcoming will be at\nonce credible (since they stand to lose little economically from\nexiting it) and compelling (because the worker/wife stand to lose so\nmuch if the employer/husband do go ahead and exit). Power inequalities\nof this kind are worrying for a number of reasons.  It can be argued\nthat they directly reduce the freedom of the weaker parties (Pettit\n1997). They also put the weaker parties at risk of exploitation and\nabuse by the stronger party (Goodin 1986, 1988; Okin 1989).   One important argument for the enactment of a social minimum is\nthat this can help to reduce the exit costs from such relationships\nfor the parties that are otherwise vulnerable, and so reduce these\nworrying inequalities of power. For example, if a worker knows that\nthe community will guarantee him a decent income even if he quits his\ncurrent job, then this makes it much easier for him to stand up to the\nboss and refuse unreasonable demands. If a wife knows that the\ncommunity will assist her financially if she leaves her husband, then\nthe prospect of leaving him because he abuses her becomes more\nfeasible. This can change the whole dynamic of these\nrelationships. Instead of one side dictating to the other, the\nrelationships become much more about dialogue and negotiation between\nequals—more democratic.  For these reasons, then, democratic perspectives on social justice\noffer strong support for the enactment of a social minimum (see also\nPateman 2005). Indeed, since it is hard to see how any society could\nretain democratic power relations for long in the absence of people\nhaving reasonable access to a social minimum, democratic perspectives\nmight also be said to offer what we referred to above as principled\nsupport for the enactment of a social minimum: a society must enact\nsuch a minimum to remain genuinely democratic, and in this respect,\ntolerably just.   Having reviewed the main arguments for the enactment of a social\nminimum, let us now consider some of the more important objections to\nenactment. We shall here consider three objections appealing\nrespectively to the values of freedom, fairness, and legitimacy.  One important objection to enactment of a social minimum is that\nsuch enactment conflicts with respect for individual freedom. To enact\na social minimum, a government must coercively tax and transfer income\nand, in the view of some thinkers, this coercion is inherently\nobjectionable. We shall consider two versions of this objection\nhere. The first appeals to freedom understood as the absence of\nintentional coercion. The second appeals to the libertarian principle\nof self-ownership that we discussed above (see\nsections 2.2 and 2.3).  According to writers in the so-called “classical\nliberal” tradition such as Friedrich Hayek, freedom consists in\nthe absence of intentional coercion (see Hayek 1960). If the\ngovernment requires one citizen, Betty, to pay taxes that will in turn\nbe used to assist a less fortunate citizen, Alf, as part of the\nprocess of enacting a social minimum, then the government\nintentionally coerces Betty and, therefore, reduces her freedom. This\nis regrettable and, if we regard freedom as the most important\npolitical value, we should perhaps refrain from using governmental\npower to assist people like Alf in this way. The welfare of\npeople like Alf might suffer; but freedom will be\npreserved.   The foregoing paragraph summarizes a common objection to\ngovernment taxation for welfare programs in liberal societies such as\nthe UK and the United States, or what one might call the crude freedom\nobjection to the enactment of a social minimum (see also Plant 1998:\n67). How might a supporter of enacting a social minimum reply to this\nobjection?  One type of reply is to argue that while taxation to establish a\nsocial minimum policy regime might reduce one kind of liberty, it will\npromote another, more valuable kind of liberty. According to this\nview, true or real liberty does not consist in the mere absence of\nintentional coercion, but in the positive capability or power to act\nin pursuit of significant goals, such as self-development. Poverty, so\nthe argument runs, diminishes this true, “positive\nliberty”; by abolishing or alleviating poverty, welfare\nprograms, financed through coercive taxation, increase the true,\npositive liberty of society's more unfortunate members. The loss to\nthe taxpayer in terms of “negative liberty” (liberty\nunderstood as the mere absence of intentional coercion) is, so the\nreply continues, morally outweighed by this gain in terms of\n“positive liberty”. This type of reply to the freedom\nobjection has a long history. It features prominently, for example, in\nlate Nineteenth and early Twentieth century attempts by so-called\n“social liberals” to defend state welfare provision from\ncriticism on liberty-related grounds (for overviews, see Freeden 1978,\nVincent and Plant 1983, Parker \n1998).[8]  Despite its historical pedigree, however, this type of reply can\nbe faulted both as inconclusive and as too concessionary to the\nclassical liberal critic of taxation for welfare programs. It is\ninconclusive because, faced with the reply, the classical liberal\ncritic can always simply counter-assert that “negative\nliberty” (again, liberty understood as the absence of\nintentional coercion) is actually the kind of liberty we should be\nprimarily concerned with. We are then apparently at an impasse with\neach side in the debate asserting the greater value of one kind of\nliberty over another, or else merely trading competing definitions of\nwhat freedom “really” is. The reply is too concessionary\nin that it too readily surrenders the value of “negative\nliberty” to the classical liberal critic of taxation for welfare\nspending. The argument for taxation and welfare spending can in fact\nbe made using the very notion of freedom to which the classical\nliberal critic appeals. This argument is likely to offer a more\ntelling reply to the critic than one that appeals to some other\n(alleged) kind of liberty (on this point, see Cohen 1988: chapter 14:\n291–292).  The essential point here is that poverty usually entails a\nlimitation of the kind of liberty that the classical liberal\nprofesses to be concerned with.  The reason why poverty typically\n“bites” into one's quality of life is that it reduces the\nrange of actions that one can perform without being subject to\nintentional coercion by others (see Waldron 1993b, Cohen\n1997, Swift 2001:\n70–71). Imagine, for example, that you are poor and that (living\nin the UK) you wish to get a train from London to Liverpool. Because\nyou are poor, you cannot buy a ticket for the journey. Because you get\non the train without a ticket, the train guard makes you leave the\ntrain at Slough, long before you reach Liverpool. Your ability to act\nas you wish has here been limited by the intentional coercion of\nothers. Or imagine that you are homeless and unable to afford to rent\na place to sleep. You locate a field in which to sleep. But the field\nbelongs to someone else, and when the landowner discovers your\npresence by means of her closed-circuit television camera system she\ncalls the police who wake you up and drag you off her land. Once\nagain, your ability to act as you wish is quashed by the intentional\ncoercion of others. By the same token, if the government were to\nprovide you with the money to buy a train ticket or to rent a space to\nsleep in, then you would become able to perform these actions without\nbeing subject to the intentional coercion that you are subject to when\nyou lack this money.   Thus, taxation for welfare spending cannot be said simply to\nreduce “liberty”, understood as the absence of intentional\ncoercion, in the name of some other value, such as welfare. Rather, it\nwill tend to produce a different distribution of this\nkind of liberty. It will expose some to intentional coercion that\nthey would otherwise not be exposed to; but, if it genuinely reduces\npoverty, it should also reduce the extent to which some people are\nexposed to intentional coercion. For this reason, it simply will not\ndo to object that the enactment of a social minimum is undesirable\nbecause it will reduce individual liberty. For the\ndecision not to enact a social minimum will also reduce the\nliberty of some individuals. If the freedom objection is to have any\nforce, it must take a subtler form than that we have thus far\nconsidered.   A second, subtler version of the freedom objection comes from\nlibertarian philosophers committed to the principle of\nself-ownership. As we have seen, libertarians do not object to\ntransfers of income and wealth which aim to make sure that each person\nreceives his/her fair share of external resources (or fair\ncompensation for others’ appropriation of their share). However,\nthese transfers might not be enough to ensure that all enjoy a full\nsocial minimum.  This insight has led some political philosophers to\nconclude that commitment to the enactment of a social minimum is\nultimately incompatible with the libertarian commitment to respect the\nself-ownership of persons: we must be prepared to override certain\nclaims of self-ownership, and forcibly transfer a portion of labor\nincomes from higher earners to the disadvantaged, if a social minimum\nis to be enacted. But is this justifiable? After all, on the face of\nit, self-ownership seems like an attractive value, capturing some\nbasic commitments we have to the freedom and inviolability of the\nindividual (see Cohen 1995: chapter 3). Imagine someone, call her Betty, who has very productive\ntalents. In order to ensure that everyone has reasonable access to a\nsocial minimum, the state announces that it will tax 50% of whatever\nincome people like Betty earn from the use of their talents, and use\nthe funds to raise the incomes of those low earnings power. The\nlibertarian, including the left-libertarian, will object that this\nviolates Betty's rights of self-ownership. Should she choose to work,\nhalf of her earnings will be funneled to others, and thus, if she\nchooses to work, she has no choice under this tax regime but to assist\nothers.  In this way, the tax system may be said to\n“harness” her talents and energies for the good of\nothers. This effort-harnessing, alleges the libertarian, is\ninherently wrong; it puts her in a position that is akin to that of a\nslave, forced to work for the good of others (Nozick 1974: 169).   In reply, egalitarian philosophers stress the kinds of freedoms\nthat someone in Betty's position retains under the imagined tax\nregime, freedoms which make it absurd, in the view of these\nphilosophers, to compare her position to that of a slave. The tax\nregime we have described leaves the decision about how much to work to\nBetty; a slave does not have this freedom. It leaves the decision\nabout what kind of job to do to Betty; a slave, again, does not have\nthis freedom. In short, taxation of labor incomes does not necessarily\ndeny the worker who is taxed basic control over whether and how she\ndeploys her talents (see especially Christman 1991); and so surely,\negalitarians argue, there is nothing really objectionable about using\nsuch taxation to enact a social minimum.   This is a forceful reply, but it is important to note its\nlimitations. The reply in effect concedes that taxation of labor\nincomes involves effort-harnessing, but points out that an individual\nworker can be free in certain significant respects even if he/she is\nsubject to effort-harnessing. This seems correct, but if one thinks\nthat effort-harnessing is wrong even if it is compatible with certain\nsignificant freedoms, then the self-ownership objection to the\nenactment of a social minimum stands. At this point, a supporter of\ntaxing labor incomes might reply in one of two ways. Firstly, he or\nshe might simply and straightforwardly reject the claim that there is\nanything inherently wrong with effort-harnessing. In other words, he\nor she might say that there is nothing necessarily objectionable about\nputting the talented in a position such that, if they choose to work,\nthey will have no choice but to assist the less talented.   Secondly, he or she might concede that there is something\ninherently wrong about effort-harnessing, but argue that the threats\nto individual freedom or dignity from poverty are a greater evil\nstill, justifying some degree of effort-harnessing in order to enact a\nsocial minimum. This position might be defended using a theory of\n“rights-based consequentialism” (e.g., of the kind set out\nby Sen 1982). The rights-based consequentialist believes that social\npolicy should be guided by the principle: act so as to minimize the\noverall amount of rights violation in society. In applying this\nprinciple, different rights might be given different weights based on\nan assessment of their relative importance to human well-being. For\nexample, in the case we have been considering, it might be argued that\nthe right to have reasonable access to a social minimum should have\nmore weight than the right to be free of effort-harnessing, and that\nit is therefore justifiable to infringe the latter right in the case\nof more talented workers in order to ensure that the former right is\nenjoyed by all.  A different objection focuses on the alleged risk of unfairness in\nenacting a social minimum. Specifically, the unfairness\nobjection is that public provision of a social minimum might lead\nsome people to make inadequate effort to help themselves and that this\nis unfair to those whose efforts ultimately make the necessary\nresources available. Note that the behavior allegedly caused by social\nminimum programs might also or alternatively be considered a bad thing\nbecause of its effect on the welfare recipient, rather than (just)\nbecause of any unfairness to others. This thought motivates what one\nmight call the dependency objection to enactment of a social\nminimum, in view of the alleged passivity or “dependency”\ninduced by reliance on welfare benefits (see, for example, Tocqueville\n1835, Murray 1984; see also Humboldt 1852). However, a good deal of\nwhat can be said in reply to the fairness objection also applies to\nthis dependency objection, and so we will not lose much by focusing on\nthe fairness objection for present purposes. The extent to which welfare programs do generate behavioral change\nis, of course, a subject of considerable debate amongst scholars of\nsocial policy (for a helpful review of the debate, see Deacon 2002:\nchapters 2–5). But assume, for the sake of argument, that public\nprovision of a social minimum does lead to some behavioral\nchange. What are the implications of this for the justice of enacting\na social minimum?  One response to the unfairness objection is to argue that some\nsort of work condition should be built into the social minimum policy\nregime. People who claim the resources constitutive of the social\nminimum should be willing to work; if they refuse, then they lose\ntheir entitlement to the social minimum in full; exceptions must be\nmade for those who are unable to work. We might call this,\nthe principle of work-conditionality (for apparent\nendorsements of this principle, subject to widely varying degrees of\nqualification, see Anderson 1999: 321; Gutmann and Thompson 1996:\nchapter 8; Kaus 1992; Mead 1986, 1992, 1997; Rawls 2001: 179; White\n2000, 2003, 2005). To be clear, by work-conditionality we mean\nconditions that link elements of the social minimum policy regime to\nsome kind of work-related activity, such as active job search or\nretraining, not necessarily to immediate work. In recent years, the\ndebate over social policy in countries like the UK and the United\nStates has also featured calls for other kinds of behavioral\nconditions, such as proposals to condition welfare benefits on school\nattendance, on staying off drugs, and on avoiding anti-social behavior\n(again, see Deacon 2002, particularly chapter 3, for a helpful\noverview; see also Mead 1997). The focus below is specifically on\nwork-conditionality, though many of the arguments against\nwork-conditionality also apply to proposals such as these.   Should the social minimum be enacted in a way that respects the\nprinciple of work-conditionality? Space permits us here to consider\njust two of the more important arguments against the principle of\nwork-conditionality.  A first important set of arguments against work-conditionality\nappeals to problems of vulnerability and equity in the\napplication of work conditions in a social minimum policy regime.   One possible problem concerns vulnerability in the labor\nmarket. As we saw above in section 2.5, one\nrationale for having a welfare state to enact a social minimum is\nthat, by providing access to urgently needed goods independently of\nthe sale of labor-power, it can reduce the pressure on disadvantaged\nworkers to scramble into poor quality (exploitative or abusive)\njobs. There is a danger that work-conditionality rules undermine this\ndesirable effect. If, for example, the government tells an unemployed\nperson that she must look for a job and take any job offered by an\nemployer on whatever terms this employer states, or else lose all\nwelfare benefits, then this person will be under severe pressure to\nfind and take a job. She will clearly have much less ability to refuse\njobs that she perceives (perhaps correctly) to involve exploitative or\nabusive treatment than if she received her welfare benefits\nunconditionally. According to some radical critics of\nwork-conditionality, this is the whole point of work-conditionality:\nto weaken the bargaining position of labor in the interests of\nbusiness and the property-owning classes (see Piven and Cloward\n1993). A distinct but related objection is that work-conditionality\nmight place a burden of “shameful revelation” on those\nclaiming transfers: to qualify for transfers, they have to show that\nthey have looked for a job, but failed to get one, which is\npotentially damaging to self-respect (Wolff 1998).   A second problem concerns the vulnerability of\ndependents. If someone is denied the full social minimum because\nhe/she chooses not to satisfy a work-conditionality rule then this\nwill not only hurt him/her, but is likely also to hurt his/her\ndependents—for the most part, children. Since these dependents\nare in no way responsible for their parents’ decision to ignore\na work-conditionality rule, this hurt is surely unfair (and, if\nsustained, may undermine other social goals, such as achieving\nequality of opportunity for children from different social\nbackgrounds).   A third problem is that work-conditionality rules may in practice\nlead to inequity between welfare recipients and other\ncitizens.  It is easy to see how a work-condition can be applied\nto citizens who need welfare benefits provided by the state to enjoy\nthe social minimum: the government can make it a condition of getting\nthe benefits that people look for a job or retrain. But what about\nthose who inherit large amounts of wealth? These people can probably\nafford to forego many of the state's welfare benefits, and their\nwealth will enable them to live comfortably without any need to\nwork. What can be done to get these wealthier citizens to meet their\nsupposed responsibility to work? If nothing is done, then there is\napparently a failure to enforce a given social duty equitably:\ncitizens who need welfare benefits will be forced to meet their\nputative duty to work, but citizens who receive large inheritances\nwill not be forced to meet this duty.   All of these points relate to a basic, underlying question of how\njust are the society's background economic structures. If society's\neconomic structures are just in other respects, then it may seem\nreasonable to expect each citizen who is able to work to do so. In a\ncontext of otherwise just social arrangements, then this seems part\nand parcel of fair social cooperation. But what if the background\nstructures of the economy are actually unjust in other respects? For\nexample, perhaps society's educational institutions fail to secure\nsufficient equality of opportunity, unfairly leaving some citizens\nwith limited job opportunities. Or perhaps the reward structure is\nunequal to an unfair extent, leaving some workers with unfairly low\npay for the work they do. In this context, it can be argued that the\nunderlying obligation to work, as an expression of fairness in social\ncooperation, does not in fact hold for those citizens who suffer\nunfair disadvantage (Shelby 2007, develops this argument in a\ndiscussion of the obligations and duties of the ghetto poor in the\nUnited States).  In response, a supporter of work-conditionality might argue that\nthe problems that the critics point to can be effectively addressed\nwithout abandoning the basic principle of work-conditionality. Perhaps\nthese problems are not necessary but contingent products of\nwork-conditionality rules, problems that can be substantially reduced,\npossibly even eliminated, by careful design of work-conditionality\nrules and/or by combining such rules with other policies that address\nthe underlying sources of market vulnerability and inequity in the\nenforcement of putative social duties.  Arguing along these lines, some of those who have endorsed the\nbasic principle of work-conditionality have also cautioned against\napplying the principle in a way that is insensitive to the background\ndistribution of wealth and opportunity in society (see, for example,\nGutmann and Thompson 1996: chapter 8; White 2003, 2005; see also\nDaniels 1981: 160–162). They argue that the principle of\nwork-conditionality should be suspended, or at least moderated, if the\nbackground distribution of wealth and opportunity is not sufficiently\negalitarian.   A further objection to making the social minimum work-conditional\ncomes from philosophers influenced by the left-libertarian tradition\nreviewed above (see section 2.3). As we saw\nabove, left-libertarians believe that, ideally speaking, individuals\nhave a right to an equal share of resources that are an inheritance\nfrom nature or from past generations. Thus, imagine that ten people\narrive on an island and find that it contains a factory containing ten\nmachines. The machines can be used to produce the food, clothing and\nshelter that the islanders need to survive. The left-libertarian will\nargue that in principle each islander should receive one\nmachine—that is, an equal share of the machines in the inherited\nfactory. Now suppose that one of the ten islanders, call him Roger,\ndecides not to work his machine but to rent it out to other islanders\nwho are prepared to work it for a price. Roger does no work, but\nsimply lives off the rent that other islanders pay him for the use of\nthe machine that he has been allocated. Now, depending on how high the\nrent is, Roger could conceivably be receiving an income close to his\nsociety's social minimum, and he will be doing no work in return for\nthis income. But the left-libertarian will argue that this is not\nunjust because Roger is only here making use of his rightful share of\nhis society's inherited goods. As we noted above, it is difficult in\npractice to divide inherited resources up literally in this way. But\nwe can perhaps identify these resources, assess their market value,\nand give everyone a grant of income or wealth equivalent to a per\ncapita share of the market value of these resources. Some people might\nchoose to live off this grant without doing any work (or doing as\nlittle work as possible).  But, according to the left-libertarian,\nthis is no different to Roger deciding to do no work and to live off\nthe rent he can get from charging others to work on his machine: it is\na legitimate use of one's rightful share of society's inherited\nresources. Subject to important nuances and variations, a number of\nphilosophers have employed this type of argument in recent years to\ndefend the payment to each citizen of an unconditional income or a\nuniversal capital grant (see Steiner 1994; Van Parijs\n1992, 1995; Ackerman and\nAlstott 1999; Birnbaum 2012; Widerquist 2013).   There are, however, some difficulties with the argument,\nunderstood as an attempt to defend the enactment of a full social\nminimum without any work condition.   The first difficulty, already flagged up in our discussion of\nleft-libertarianism in section 2.3, is that the\ngrant which represents one's rightful share of society's inherited\nwealth might fall somewhat short of the value of the full social\nminimum.[9] However, a second question is whether people do in fact have a\nright to an equal share of their society's inherited\nresources regardless of work effort. The basic issue is\nwhether it is fair to use an inheritance, as Roger does in the example\nabove, to extract a share of what other citizens produce while\nchoosing not to make a productive contribution of one's own in\nreturn.   It might be said that people like Roger do contribute to\nproduction by supplying their share of inherited resources for others\nto use for productive purposes.  But a distinction can be made between\nthe contribution that the inherited resources putatively credited to\nRoger make to production, and Roger's own contribution.  If Roger were\nnot on the island we imagined, the other islanders could still use the\ninherited resources that we have supposed are otherwise credited to\nhim. They could work just as hard, and produce just as much, as they\ndo when Roger is there and is credited with an equal share of these\nresources. But they would be better off because they would not have to\ngive a portion of this product to Roger in return for using some of\nthe island's inherited wealth.  This, so the argument runs, shows that\nRoger himself is not in any real sense contributing economically to\nthe society. So is it fair for him to get an income without working\n(assuming that he could if he so chooses)? Some argue that Roger has\nmuch right to a share of the machines as anyone else and it is up to\nhim what benefit he gets from this (Van Parijs 1995, Birnbaum\n2012). Others argue that cases like this shows that a just\ndistribution of assets should be more sensitive to individuals' own\ninterest in making direct use of them (see van Donselaar 2009; see\nalso Van der Veen 1998, White 2007).    To conclude, the concern for economic fairness (as reciprocity)\ndoes not offer grounds for rejecting enactment of a social minimum. At\nmost, it supports making elements of a social minimum policy package\nwork-conditional. However, there are strong arguments for limiting\nwork-conditionality. One set of arguments appeals to the ways in which\nwork-conditionality can enhance the vulnerability of citizens to\nexploitation or other forms of injustice and/or generate or exacerbate\nother inequities between citizens. This set of arguments—of\nwhich we have mentioned only a selection here—has additional\nforce in societies where the background economic structures are\notherwise significantly unjust (Shelby 2007). Another kind of argument\nappeals to the idea that citizens have a right to a share of inherited\nassets that is not conditional with respect to willingness to work,\nthough the scope and precise nature of this right remains\ndisputed.  A third objection to the enactment of a social minimum appeals to\nthe value of legitimacy. A law or policy lacks legitimacy when the law\nor policy is arbitrary in the eyes of those bound by the law or\npolicy—that is, they are unable to identify a sufficiently good\nreason to justify their subjection to this law or policy. The absence\nof legitimacy signals a kind of alienation from the law or policy, so\nthat people are quite unable to identify with it as an expression of\nwhat they value and believe. Critics might argue that the\nestablishment of a social minimum policy regime creates distinctive\nproblems of legitimacy for a society; and they might further argue\nthat these problems make it undesirable, all things considered, to\nenact a social minimum. How might enactment of a social minimum\ngenerate problems of legitimacy? How can these problems be tackled? Do\nthe problems really discredit the case for enactment? One potential legitimacy problem is the capability-list\nproblem that we noted above in\nsection 1.2. To say what kind and level\nof resources are necessary for people to be able to lead “a\nminimally decent life in one's society”, we must take a view\nabout the functionings and capabilities that are constitutive of a\ndecent human life, and any such view is bound to be somewhat\ncontroversial. Some people might not accept the capability-list used\nto determine the social minimum as the right list. We shall return\nbriefly to this problem towards the end of this section, but only\nafter first give some consideration to a second potential legitimacy\nproblem which we also briefly noted in\nsection 1.1: the limit-setting\nproblem. To recall the problem, consider once again item (2) on\nNussbaum's list of “central human functional\ncapabilities”, as set out in\nsection 1.2, the capability for bodily\nhealth. What kind and level of access to health-care resources must a\nsociety secure for its members for us to say that this capability is\nsatisfied to an extent that allows everyone to lead “a minimally\ndecent life”? If we hold that society must ensure access to\nwhatever health-care resources have, say, a life-sustaining impact,\nthen we may well be committing ourselves to spending the vast bulk of\nthe society's resources just on health-care. At some point limits must\nbe set, or else the health-care sector will devour the whole social\nproduct (making it impossible, of course, to provide for other key\ncapabilities). But, on the other hand, how can limits be set in a way\nthat is fair and has legitimacy in the eyes of the people who will\nhave to live with the consequences of these limit-setting decisions?\nHow is it possible for communities to decide whether or not a new,\nexpensive health-care treatment is in or out of the social minimum,\nand for this decision to have legitimacy in the eyes of the\ncitizens?  In response to this question, political philosophers have developed\ntwo, complementary responses. A first response is to consider whether\nthe theories of social justice that support enactment of a social\nminimum also provide reasons that we can use to set non-arbitrary\nlimits on the content of the social minimum. One example is Ronald\nDworkin's hypothetical insurance argument for the social minimum (see\nsection 2.4.2 above). Dworkin has himself\nexplained how this approach might be used to inform limit-setting\ndecisions in health-care (see Dworkin 2000: 307–319). We begin\nby imagining that each person holds a fair share of their society's\nwealth (let's say, roughly speaking, a per capita share of this\nwealth). We then imagine that each person is fully knowledgeable of\nthe value, costs and side-effects of available medical\nprocedures. People know the population-wide probabilities of getting\nspecific health conditions, but we imagine that there is a veil of\nignorance such that no person is aware of his or her own individual\nrisk of any condition. We then ask what treatments a typical young\nperson in this hypothetical insurance market would choose to insure\nthemselves for, over their whole life, out of their fair share of\nsociety's wealth. According to Dworkin, while we cannot know what such\na person would choose to insure themselves for with “any\nprecision”, we can make some reasonable guesses as to some of\nthe treatments he would not insure himself for, and we can\nthen use this information to address the problem of limit-setting in\npublicly-financed health-care systems.  Consider, for example, very\nexpensive treatments that marginally extend the lives of terminally\nill old-aged patients. Dworkin claims that most young people on reflection would not think it prudent to buy\ninsurance that could keep them alive, by expensive medical\nintervention, for four or five months at the most if they had already\nlived into old age. They would think it wiser to spend what that\ninsurance would cost on better health care earlier, or on education or\ntraining or investment that would provide greater benefit or more\nimportant security. (Dworkin 2000: 314) Precisely because we would not choose to insure\nourselves for such treatments, in the circumstances of a fair,\nhypothetical insurance market, Dworkin argues that we should not\ninclude them in the package of treatments that citizens are entitled\nto as part of the social minimum.   Nevertheless, since it is impossible to track the choices of a\nprudent youth in the hypothetical insurance market with any precision,\nDworkin's hypothetical insurance approach is likely to leave us with a\ngood deal of reasonable disagreement about what kind of health-care\ntreatments should or should not be included in the health-care package\nprovided by the social minimum policy regime. This large residuum of\nreasonable disagreement leads on to the second response to the\nlimit-setting problem. This response invites us to consider explicitly\nthe political processes through which limit-setting decisions\nare made. It considers what features these processes must have if they\nare to treat all those bound by the decisions fairly, and in a way\nthat all those concerned can regard as legitimate.  In the health-care context, this issue is explored in an important\npaper by Norman Daniels and James Sabin (Daniels and Sabin\n1997). Daniels and Sabin\nargue that for limit-setting decisions in this context to have\nlegitimacy, the decision-making process must satisfy four conditions\n(see Daniels and Sabin 1997: 322–325; also Ham and Robert 2003: 2): The idea is not that the people who are affected by a given\nlimit-setting decision will necessarily agree with this decision if\nthese conditions are met, e.g., agree with a decision to exclude a\nspecific medical treatment from the health-care package provided under\nthe social minimum policy regime. Rather, the idea is that all parties\nwill be able to regard the decision as legitimate, even if they\ndisagree with it and some of them continue to oppose it. The\nconditions of publicity and reasonableness work to ensure that a given\ndecision is grounded in reasons of a kind that affected parties can\nsee at least see as relevant. The contestability condition helps to\nensure that the reasonableness of the decision is robust, that all\nrelevant reasons and evidence have indeed been weighed by the\ndecision-making body in coming to its decision. In these\ncircumstances, even the person who “loses” in such a case\ncan feel assured that her interests and point of view have not been\noverruled arbitrarily. In this sense, she is fairly treated and the\ndecision ought to have, even in her eyes, legitimacy, even if she\ncontinues to think it mistaken and opposes it. Participants in such\nprocedures might be encouraged to use thought-experiments like\nDworkin's so as to help correct biases and so contribute to the\nreasonableness of the decisions made; even if such thought-experiments\ncan't always identify a specific policy as clearly the just one, they\ncan help to keep decision-makers from choosing policies that are\nclearly unreasonable.  The implication of the foregoing analysis is that those who wish\nto enact a social minimum need to give some thought to the\ninstitutional structures through which limit-setting decisions are\nmade, with an eye to seeing that the conditions of publicity,\nreasonableness, and contestability are met. This applies not only in\nrelation to health-care, but in relation to all the programs that\ngovernments must typically have as part of enacting a social minimum,\nsuch as cash transfer programs, educational services, and so\non. Moreover, this concern for appropriate procedure should arguably\ninform not only our response to the limit-setting problem, but to the\ncapability-list problem that we noted above.  In a society where\nthere is broad, but not perfect, consensus in support of a\nNussbaum-style list of “central human functional\ncapabilities”, the legitimacy of the final capability-list used\nto help specify the social minimum can be enhanced by subjecting the\nformulation of the list to a process that has the characteristics of\npublicity, reasonableness, and contestability noted above (see Sen\n1999: 110; Nussbaum 1999: 47–49, for comments along these\nlines).[10] A\nsimilar focus on the importance of fair procedure in the\nspecification of the social minimum policy package can be found in\nNancy Fraser's work on the “politics of need\ninterpretation” (Fraser 1989, 1997), and in Amy Gutmann's and\nDennis Thompson's account of welfare state policy-making in a\n“deliberative democracy” (Gutmann and Thompson 1996). The\nuse of conditionality, discussed in the previous section, is perhaps\na particularly important area in which to make sure that\npolicy-making procedures have these qualities of publicity,\nreasonableness, and contestability. A further and key question for consideration here is whether the\nstandard processes of representative democracy are adequate to meet\nthe demands of publicity, reasonableness, and contestability, or\nwhether, to achieve decisions that have legitimacy, these processes\nneed to be supplemented by other kinds of institutions that are more\ndeliberative and inclusive of the people who stand to be bound by\nlimit-setting and capability-listing decisions. One interesting\ndevelopment in this respect is the recent growth of interest in the\nuse of various kinds of “minipublic” such\nas citizens’ juries and deliberative opinion\npolls to assist with decision-making in health-care and other\npublic services (on which, see Fishkin 1995, Coote and Lenaghan 1998,\nSmith and Wales 2000, Fung 2003, Smith 2009). Another 'democratic\ninnovation' which is important in this respect is participatory\nbudgeting which originated in Brazil in the 1990s and has since been\ntaken up (in various forms) around the world (de Sousa Santos 2007,\nWampler 2007, Baiocchi, Heller and Silva 2011, Fung 2011).  In view of the legitimacy problems discussed in this section,\nthose who support enactment of a social minimum arguably need to give\nmore thought to the role of such institutions in the specification and\noperation of social minimum policy regimes.  Instead of summarizing the arguments of the previous sections\nhere, we close by noting three further points which put our discussion\ninto perspective.   Firstly, we should note that as we move to enact the social\nminimum there are a number of important policy design questions that\narise that our discussion thus far leaves unresolved. We have\nconsidered one design issue: the issue of how far access to the\nsocial minimum should be work-conditional. But there is a huge range\nof other design issues that we have not directly considered. For\nexample, if we accept that the government has a responsibility to its\ncitizens to secure access to certain basic goods and services, to\nwhat extent should the government itself directly produce these goods\nand services, e.g., health-care? If we accept that the government\nmust introduce tax-transfer schemes to enact the social minimum, what\nform should these take? Should the government use\n“means-testing” to target transfers exclusively to the\nmost needy, or should it seek to enact the social minimum through\nso-called “social insurance” programs to which all (or\nvirtually all) citizens contribute, and from which all receive\nbenefits?[11]\nIf the government provides citizens with assistance in meeting a\nspecific need, should it provide assistance in the form of\n“in-kind” benefits or in the form of\ncash?[12]\nThese are all major design questions that arise in thinking about how\nto enact the social minimum. One cannot settle them merely by appeal\nto the basic principle of the social minimum. Although many of the\nideas and considerations discussed here will be relevant in\naddressing these questions, settling them requires further\nphilosophical reflection and, indeed, a lot of empirical\nresearch.   Secondly, it is important to note that throughout the discussion\nour focus has implicitly been on the morality of enacting a social\nminimum within a given country. But this restriction of\nfocus obviously leaves unconsidered what many people rightly consider\nto be an urgent question: What kind of obligations (if any) do we, as\ncitizens of one country, have to secure the enactment of a social\nminimum in other countries? Again, this question demands further\nphilosophical reflection, reflection that would need to draw on the\ngrowing body of literature on cosmopolitan or global\njustice.[13] Thirdly, even when considering economic and social arrangements\nwithin a given country, we need to keep distinct the specific question\nof whether and why a social minimum is justified from the broader\nquestion of what social justice consists in and demands of\nus. Enacting a social minimum may well be a demand of social\njustice. Indeed, it may well be one of the most urgent demands of\nsocial justice. But, challenging as this demand may be, social justice\nmay require even more of us than this.","contact.mail":"stuart.white@jesus.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"jesus.ox.ac.uk"}]
