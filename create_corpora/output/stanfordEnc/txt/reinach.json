Although his\nlife was tragically cut short, and his corpus of writings modest in\nsize, Reinach's essays on general ontology, on the philosophy of\nlaw and on the philosophy of language, are remarkably clear and\noriginal examples of the phenomenological approach to philosophizing.\nHis principal distinction lies in his 1913 monograph “On the\nA Priori Foundations of the Civil Law”, whose analysis\nof the act of promising anticipates several crucial aspects of the\nspeech act theories of Austin and Searle.\n\n\n\nAdolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in Mainz,\nGermany in 1883. He began his university studies in Munich in 1901,\nwhere he studied law, psychology and philosophy. In 1905 he completed\nhis doctorate under the direction of Theodor Lipps with a dissertation\nentitled, “On the Concept of Causality in the Criminal\nCode.” During this time, Reinach joined a circle of philosophers\nwho had studied Husserl's recently published Logical\nInvestigations (1900–01), a circle which included Johannes\nDaubert, Alexander Pfänder, Theodor Conrad, and Moritz Geiger. In\n1909 Reinach moved to Göttingen, where he completed his\nHabilitation under Husserl's sponsorship. \n\nShortly after the declaration of war in 1914 Reinach enlisted in the\nGerman army. While some letters and philosophical sketches from the war\nyears have survived, Reinach never published another manuscript or\ndirected another seminar. He died in battle in Flanders in 1917,\nshortly after becoming baptized into the Protestant Church. \n\nThe historian of phenomenology Herbert Spiegelberg writes: \n\nThe influence of Reinach did however continue to make itself felt\nabove all in Poland through the work of Roman Ingarden and to some\ndegree also of Karol Wojtyła (Pope John Paul II). \n\nLike the other realist phenomenologists, Reinach saw himself as\ndeveloping a distinctive approach to philosophy, inspired by\nHusserl's Logical Investigations, with the goal of being\nfaithful to what is given in different kinds of experience (e.g.,\nlinguistic, religious, moral, or aesthetic experience). \n\nFor realist phenomenologists, the distinction between a\npriori and a posteriori knowledge has to do with the kind\nof object studied and not (as for the later Husserl) with any special\nepistemological technique such as that of epoché or\ntranscendental reduction. Reinach credited the possibility of a\npriori knowledge to certain special features (necessity,\nuniversality, timelessness, intelligibility) of the corresponding\nobjects of knowledge (which are in Reinach's eyes certain kinds\nof states of affairs and associated essences or natures). Thus, Reinach\nwrites \n\nReinach saw these special features of certain essences—such as\nnumbers, promising, and asserting—as straightforward features of\nreality, thereby insisting that calling something a priori\n“does not mean anything dark or mystical” (1913, p. 5). His\nrealist understanding of material and synthetic a priori\nknowledge of essences is further elucidated in the next two\nsections. \n\nAccording to Reinach, material a priori states of affairs\nand essences exist independently of the contingent minds that may\napprehend them and of the individual objects that may instantiate them.\nSuch instantiation will however bring in its wake a series of concrete\nassociations with other entities. Thus in writing about the legal\nentities (such as rights and obligations) that are grounded in the\nessence of promising, Reinach notes that when such legal entities\nexist, they become “intimately interwoven with the rest of the\nnatural world, with all the experiencing of persons who perform acts,\nwith their feelings and wishes, their desires and intentions, their\nexpectations and fears, etc.” (1913, p. 130) \n\nReinach's insistence that the objects of a priori\nknowledge can be considered apart from any realization in the world led\nto Husserl's later accusation that Reinach embraced a Platonism\nthat “distorted the true picture of phenomenology”\n(Spiegelberg, p. 192). Yet Reinach explicitly rejected any notion of\nessences of the sort that would generate any form of third man\nargument. In his article, “The Supreme Rules of Rational\nInference According to Kant” (1911a), he observes that\njudgments such as “the triangle has three sides” or\n“the lion has a tail” have often been said to refer to\ngeneral concepts such as “triangle” or “lion.”\nBut this leads not only to odd ideas (e.g., that a concept has a tail)\nbut also, as Berkeley noted, to impossible ideas (such as a triangle\nthat is at once right-angled, equilateral, and obtuse). Reinach notes\nthat the ontological mistake lies in assuming that essences are\nsubstances or really existing particulars; the logical mistake is\nassuming that judgments about “the triangle” or “the\nlion” refer to concepts at all. Rather, the judgment that\n“the triangle has three sides” is more precisely expressed\nas having the general form “everything that is a triangle has\nthree sides.” It is this general state of affairs that is the\nspecific object of our a priori knowledge. \n\nReinach notes in his Marburg lecture (1914) that, while many\nphilosophers had acknowledged the existence of a priori\ntruths, most had restricted the a priori to a very narrow\nsphere, confining it either to the formal a priori (Hume) or\nto the a priori of Newtonian physics (Kant). For Reinach, in\ncontrast, there are material a priori structures in every\ndomain of reality. If we know that only a free agent can be\nresponsible, then this is because we understand the necessary and\ntimeless natures of freedom and responsibility. In “Concerning\nPhenomenology” Reinach states that “the realm of the a\npriori is incalculably large … [and this] opens up for\ninvestigation an area so large and rich that still today we cannot see\nits boundaries” (1914, pp. 215–216). In defending the existence\nof material a priori truths (also called ‘essential\nlaws’), Reinach and his colleagues thus believed that they had\nestablished a new kind of research agenda for philosophy. And while in\nmany respects this is an agenda which combats reductionism, its\nproponents have at the same time provided us with several examples in\nwhich careful analysis of essences in the spirit of this agenda\nprecisely refutes the existence of certain supposed entities. \n\n“Concerning Phenomenology” stands out not least in that it\nis one of the earliest attempts by a German philosopher to come to\ngrips with Frege's work. Reinach observes that, while the division of\nnumbers into two sorts, the ordinal and the cardinal, is generally\naccepted, it is widely debated which kind of number is more primitive\nor basic. Reinach attempts to resolve this debate, and in the process\nprovides an account of number predications, such as “The\nKaiser's coach is drawn by four horses,” of a sort treated also\nby Frege. He begins by noting that cardinal numbers are properly\nspeaking not predicated of things. Frege, for example, argued that in\nstatements such as “The Kaiser's coach is drawn by four\nhorses” the number four is predicated of a concept, namely,\nhorse that draws the Kaiser's coach. However, Reinach finds\nit to be self-evident that “a concept which subsumes four\nobjects is just as little four as a concept which subsumes material\nobjects is, therefore, itself material” (p. 206). Neither\nnumbers nor categorical elements such as “some” or\n“all” are properties, by this argument, and accordingly\nthey are not really predicated of things. Numbers rather give the\nrange of objects that fall within the scope of a predication. Put\nanother way, numbers do not answer the question “how many”\nbut rather “how many\nAs are B?” \n\nReinach finds that so-called ordinal numbers are nothing but a\nshorthand way of referring to the (cardinal) number of terms a certain\nseries contains up to some given term. In any given series, we have a\nfirst term, a last term, and any number of terms in\nbetween. Naturally, we may wish to denote the position of a term\nwithin an ordered series.  Yet this can quickly become very\ncumbersome. As Reinach notes, if we use letters to denote an ordered\nseries of four terms—a, b, c, and\nd—then already “c” would be called\n“the term following the term following the opening term.”\nIt is much easier simply to adopt a numerical convention according to\nwhich “c” is named in reflection of the fact that\nit is the term up to which the series contains three terms. Yet in no\nway does such designation constitute a new sort of number; in saying\nthe series ‘contains three members up to this point’, we\nare still making use of the cardinal number three. Reinach writes that\nthere is \n\nReinach's view of ordinal numbers may seem radical. However,\nit is not only internally consistent with his philosophy of ideal\nobjects and predication, but it seems consistent also with ordinary\nlanguage. As Reinach observes, the way that we designate the position\nof elements in a series does not always use numerical names: \n\nThroughout his writings, Reinach makes extensive use of the category\nof states of affairs (Sachverhalte). For example, he maintains\nthat a priori knowledge is first and foremost knowledge of\nspecific states of affairs (e.g., the being equal of 2+2 and\n4) rather than of propositions or things. States of affairs may be\nmost accurately described as states of being. This is because\nit is the being (the copula) in a state of affairs that typically bears\nthe special (for example modal) properties attributed to that state of\naffairs. For example, in the being equal of 2+2 and 4 it is\nthe being equal that is necessary, just as in the being\nred of the house it is the being red that is contingent.\nSimilarly, when we assert “that house is not red” we are\nasserting a state of affairs we have apprehended, namely, the not\nbeing red of the house. In this case, the negativity pertains to\nthe copula of the state of affairs, that is, the not being red\nof the house, rather than the being not-red of the house. There are no\nnegative properties, for Reinach. That is to say, negative properties\nhave no existence, and those philosophers who have posited their\nexistence have been misled by language, which frequently says things\nare, e.g., not red. \n\nReinach claims that numerous properties that are standardly viewed\nby philosophers as properties of objects are most properly conceived as\nproperties of states of affairs. \n\nMany of Reinach's fellow realist phenomenologist came to embrace the\nidea that either all states of affairs (Lipps 1928; Pfänder 1921)\nor at least negative states of affairs (Ingarden 1964–65) exist\nonly as intentional objects. Reinach, however, embraced a realist\nposition towards both positive and negative states of affairs. The\nkind of being Reinach attributed to states of affairs was that of\n“obtaining” (Bestehen); they do not really\n“exist” as do things, but neither are they simply mental\nor intentional objects. Reinach believed that negative states of\naffairs obtain precisely as do positive states of affairs; otherwise,\nhe did not see how we could defend objective knowledge of the most\nbasic laws of ontology and logic (specifically, the principle of\ncontradiction and the law of the excluded middle). On the other hand\nhe did not believe that every positive or negative sentence\ncorresponds to some state of affairs which obtains; this applies only\nto those sentences which are true, and thus only to one member of any\ngiven positive and negative pair of putative states of affairs. \n\nIn his essay, “Deliberation: Its Ethical and Legal\nSignificance” (1912/1913), Reinach observes that there are\ncontradictions in how we evaluate the moral significance of\ndeliberation. For example, we consider a crime more reprehensible if it\nis performed after deliberation, yet we also judge harshly one who\nperforms a crime without a second thought. Reinach noted that in the\nGerman law in his day killing without deliberation could mean as little\nas six months in prison where killing after deliberation would mean\ncertain capital punishment. \n\nReinach distinguishes between intellectual and volitional\ndeliberation. The former aims at apprehending what is the case, the\nlatter at apprehending what should be done. For example, upon arriving\nin a concentration camp, an inmate might intellectually deliberate\nabout the odds of successfully escaping. He might decide the odds are\nlow (say 1 in 20) yet still volitionally deliberate about whether he\nought to attempt to escape. Of the two, volitional deliberation is\npsychologically the more complex. Intellectual deliberation tends to\nculminate in conviction once we apprehend what is the case. In\ncontrast, volitional deliberation has no “automatic”\nconclusion because the value of an act is subject to modification when\nit is connected to the real world of consequences. An act that appears\nhighly noble in itself may have such negative consequences that the\nvalue of actually undertaking it is modified to a disvalue. For\nexample, while escaping from a concentration camp may be good in\nitself, it may be a disvalue if escapes are punished through increased\ntorture and killing of remaining inmates. Moreover, even after one\nrightly discerns the value of an action per se and the value\nof undertaking a proposed action, experience shows that value\nperception does not compel either the will or the heart to provide a\nfitting response. That is, one might decide that escaping is\nwrong—all things considered—yet still attempt an escape to\nsave one's own life or sanity. \n\nThese facts about deliberation help us to recognize shortcomings in\nthe significance that the law attaches to deliberation. Reinach claims\nthat our belief that a crime is made worse by deliberation rests on the\nassumption that when an individual undertakes a project that is\ndisvaluable (say killing), the moral situation is worsened by knowledge\nof the relevant disvalue. That is to say, individuals are less culpable\nwhen they act in ignorance of the disvalue of their crime. Reinach\nfinds that deliberation is actually playing a symbolic role when its\nsignificance is interpreted in this fashion: it is taken to signify\nthat the individual had in fact apprehended the disvalue of an act\nprior to choosing to perform it. However, the connection between\ndeliberation and the perception of a disvalue is not a necessary\nconnection: one may apprehend a disvalue without deliberation, and one\nmay deliberate and still fail to apprehend a disvalue. Thus, the law is\nin no position to determine the precise significance of deliberation in\nan a priori fashion. \n\nIn fact, Reinach argues that the common-sense assumption that a\nreprehensible deed is actually worse when done without a second\nthought—an assumption that contradicts the prevailing wisdom of\ncriminal law—more properly reflects the direct moral significance\nof deliberation. It is good for people to consider what they do.\nFailure to deliberate about a crime implies either a fundamental\ndisregard for or an insensitivity to values—and neither seems to\nreduce the culpability of a criminal act. Thus, Reinach concludes that\nthe law is mistaken in attaching more severe punishment to deliberate\nthan to non-deliberate crimes. \n\nReinach's major work, “The A priori Foundations\nof the Civil Law” (1913) begins with the following claim: \n\nReinach here refers specifically to claims and obligations. He\nasserts that they exist just as much as do trees and houses. Clearly,\nthey are not physical entities, but neither are they mental. They do\nindeed presuppose a person as their “bearer”—that is,\nreal claims and obligations always belong to someone. In addition,\npsychological properties may correspond to claims and obligations; for\nexample, one may feel entitled or feel obligated. However, if\nI accept a car loan and contractually agree to pay back the loan over a\n36-month period, my obligation does not cease to exist even if such\nfeelings fade away and even if I forget about the obligation\ncompletely. The very fact that a claim or obligation may last for years\nwithout change speaks against any alleged reduction to something\npsychological, for there is nothing in the psychological (or indeed in\nthe physical) domain that remains static over time. \n\nIn the Logical Investigations, Husserl developed a thesis\nadvanced by his teacher Brentano to the effect that all mental acts are\nintentional, that is, that they are directed towards an object. Husserl\nmaintained that all intentional experiences are in this sense\n‘objectifying acts’. \n\nHusserl's account of meaning builds upon this theory. All uses\nof language are, he says, referential. Accordingly, Husserl viewed acts\nsuch as questions or commands as masked assertions. The command\n“sit down on the chair” he interpreted as a statement to\nthe effect that “your sitting down on the chair is my current\nrequest.” \n\nIt was in critical reaction to such theses that Reinach developed\nhis theory of social acts (Smith 1990), a theory which bears\nstriking similarities to the theory of speech acts later developed by\nAustin and Searle. \n\nBoth promising and communicating one's intention to do\nsomething, according to Reinach, belong to the category of what he\ncalls “spontaneous” acts, i.e. acts which involve a\nsubject's bringing something about within his own psychic sphere,\nas contrasted with passive experiences of, say, feeling a pain or\nhearing an explosion (1913, p. 706, Eng. p. 18). Certain types of\nspontaneous act are such as to require as a matter of necessity a\nlinguistic utterance or some other overt performance of a non-natural\nand rule-governed sort. This does not hold of judging or deciding, nor\neven of forgiving, but it does hold of apologizing, commanding, or\naccusing. We may accordingly divide spontaneous acts into two classes,\nwhich we might call internal and external, according to whether the\nact's being brought to overt expression is a separable or an\ninseparable moment of the relevant complex whole. \n\nActs are divided further into self-directable and\nnon-self-directable. Self-directable acts are such that the subject\ntoward whom they are directed may be identical with the subject of the\nact (as in cases of self-pity, self-hatred, etc.). Non-self-directable\nacts, on the other hand, such as forgiving or praying, demand an alien\nsubject. A peculiarity of certain external and non-self-directable acts\nis that the relevant utterance must of necessity be\nnot only directed toward a certain subject but also registered or\ngrasped by this subject in a further act: a command must be received\nand understood by those to whom it is addressed (something which does\nnot apply, for example, to an act of blessing or cursing). It is part\nof the essential structure of a command that it be an action of a\nsubject which is spontaneous, intentional, non-self-directable and in\nneed of being grasped by the subject towards whom it is addressed. The\nsame holds also of requests, admonishments, questionings, informings,\nanswerings, and many other types of act. (Reinach 1913, p. 707, Eng.\npp. 19f.) Each social act constitutes an inner unity of deliberate\nexecution and deliberate utterance. The experience is here impossible\nin the absence of the utterance. And the utterance for its part is not\nsomething that is added to the experience as an incidental extra; it\nstands in the service of the social act and is necessary in order that\nthe latter should fulfill its announcing function. \n\nReinach mentions many social acts in his treatise on “The\nA Priori Foundations of the Civil Law”\n(1913)—commanding, requesting, warning, questioning and\nanswering, informing, enacting, revoking, transferring, granting, and\nwaiving of claims—but he devotes the most attention to the act\nof promising. Drawing on the theory of essences or intrinsically\nintelligible structures referred to above, Reinach offers the\nfollowing examples of a priori truths about what he sees as\nthe intrinsically intelligible structure instantiated through the\nperformance of a promising act: \n\nReinach maintains that such truths are not merely necessary and\nuniversal, but also informative, thus that they are examples of truths\nthat are both a priori and synthetic. \n\nReinach's views are in this respect opposed to those of Searle\n(1969), who argued that promising is a social institution that can be\nexplained in terms of so-called constitutive rules analogous to the\nrules of chess (Zaibert and Smith 2007). Once one stipulates the\nrules, on this account, then certain necessary truths can be derived.\nReinach, in contrast, held that promising is a sui generis\nphenomenon that is not invented but rather discovered, as is seen in\nthe contrast between promising and those elements of a code of law\nwhich truly are constructed, for example specific rules concerning\nprimogeniture or the discharging of liens. Reinach speculates that an\nindividual who orally contracts to rent a piece of property for three\nyears may be surprised to learn that, in German law, this contract is\nmade for an “indefinite length of time.” In contrast,\nsomeone who waives a claim will hardly be surprised by the fact that\nthe claim is now extinguished. The latter, in Reinach's terms,\nflows from the very essence of a claim and of the act of waiving a\nclaim, and in this it contrasts sharply with the non-intuitive\narbitrariness of the rules of chess. \n\nReinach next surveys Hume, who familiarly provides an account of why\na promise is binding which rests on the idea that there is a certain\nsort of sui generis experience which becomes expressed in a\npromise and which is somehow binding on the subject but which is at the\nsame time analogous to experiences of resolving, wishing, willing in\nthat it can be present also without any accompanying\nexpression. Reinach rejects this account – denying that such an\nexperience could exist – and rejects also a variety of other\npsychologistic and consequentialistic theories because they are, he\nclaims, seeking an explanation of a phenomenon so basic that it cannot\nbe further elucidated in terms of anything more simple. As he himself\nexpresses it: \n\nIn this passage, Reinach summarizes his view not only of promising,\nbut also of phenomenological philosophy itself. The central task of\nphenomenology is to describe faithfully what is given in experience,\npreferring knowledge that is immediate and intuitive to that which is\nknown indirectly through deduction or other means.","contact.mail":"jdubois@wustl.edu","contact.domain":"wustl.edu"},{"date.published":"2008-09-21","date.changed":"2018-08-20","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reinach/","author1":"James DuBois","author1.info":"http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/","entry":"reinach","body.text":"\n\n\n\nAdolf Reinach was a leading representative of the so-called realist\ntradition within phenomenology who has been described as\nHusserl's “first real co-worker in the development of the\nphenomenological movement” (Willard 1969, p. 194).

This is because\nit is the being (the copula) in a state of affairs that typically bears\nthe special (for example modal) properties attributed to that state of\naffairs. For example, in the being equal of 2+2 and 4 it is\nthe being equal that is necessary, just as in the being\nred of the house it is the being red that is contingent.\nSimilarly, when we assert “that house is not red” we are\nasserting a state of affairs we have apprehended, namely, the not\nbeing red of the house. In this case, the negativity pertains to\nthe copula of the state of affairs, that is, the not being red\nof the house, rather than the being not-red of the house. There are no\nnegative properties, for Reinach. That is to say, negative properties\nhave no existence, and those philosophers who have posited their\nexistence have been misled by language, which frequently says things\nare, e.g., not red. \n\nReinach claims that numerous properties that are standardly viewed\nby philosophers as properties of objects are most properly conceived as\nproperties of states of affairs. \n\nMany of Reinach's fellow realist phenomenologist came to embrace the\nidea that either all states of affairs (Lipps 1928; Pfänder 1921)\nor at least negative states of affairs (Ingarden 1964–65) exist\nonly as intentional objects. Reinach, however, embraced a realist\nposition towards both positive and negative states of affairs. The\nkind of being Reinach attributed to states of affairs was that of\n“obtaining” (Bestehen); they do not really\n“exist” as do things, but neither are they simply mental\nor intentional objects. Reinach believed that negative states of\naffairs obtain precisely as do positive states of affairs; otherwise,\nhe did not see how we could defend objective knowledge of the most\nbasic laws of ontology and logic (specifically, the principle of\ncontradiction and the law of the excluded middle). On the other hand\nhe did not believe that every positive or negative sentence\ncorresponds to some state of affairs which obtains; this applies only\nto those sentences which are true, and thus only to one member of any\ngiven positive and negative pair of putative states of affairs. \n\nIn his essay, “Deliberation: Its Ethical and Legal\nSignificance” (1912/1913), Reinach observes that there are\ncontradictions in how we evaluate the moral significance of\ndeliberation. For example, we consider a crime more reprehensible if it\nis performed after deliberation, yet we also judge harshly one who\nperforms a crime without a second thought. Reinach noted that in the\nGerman law in his day killing without deliberation could mean as little\nas six months in prison where killing after deliberation would mean\ncertain capital punishment. \n\nReinach distinguishes between intellectual and volitional\ndeliberation. The former aims at apprehending what is the case, the\nlatter at apprehending what should be done. For example, upon arriving\nin a concentration camp, an inmate might intellectually deliberate\nabout the odds of successfully escaping. He might decide the odds are\nlow (say 1 in 20) yet still volitionally deliberate about whether he\nought to attempt to escape. Of the two, volitional deliberation is\npsychologically the more complex. Intellectual deliberation tends to\nculminate in conviction once we apprehend what is the case. In\ncontrast, volitional deliberation has no “automatic”\nconclusion because the value of an act is subject to modification when\nit is connected to the real world of consequences. An act that appears\nhighly noble in itself may have such negative consequences that the\nvalue of actually undertaking it is modified to a disvalue. For\nexample, while escaping from a concentration camp may be good in\nitself, it may be a disvalue if escapes are punished through increased\ntorture and killing of remaining inmates. Moreover, even after one\nrightly discerns the value of an action per se and the value\nof undertaking a proposed action, experience shows that value\nperception does not compel either the will or the heart to provide a\nfitting response. That is, one might decide that escaping is\nwrong—all things considered—yet still attempt an escape to\nsave one's own life or sanity. \n\nThese facts about deliberation help us to recognize shortcomings in\nthe significance that the law attaches to deliberation. Reinach claims\nthat our belief that a crime is made worse by deliberation rests on the\nassumption that when an individual undertakes a project that is\ndisvaluable (say killing), the moral situation is worsened by knowledge\nof the relevant disvalue. That is to say, individuals are less culpable\nwhen they act in ignorance of the disvalue of their crime. Reinach\nfinds that deliberation is actually playing a symbolic role when its\nsignificance is interpreted in this fashion: it is taken to signify\nthat the individual had in fact apprehended the disvalue of an act\nprior to choosing to perform it. However, the connection between\ndeliberation and the perception of a disvalue is not a necessary\nconnection: one may apprehend a disvalue without deliberation, and one\nmay deliberate and still fail to apprehend a disvalue. Thus, the law is\nin no position to determine the precise significance of deliberation in\nan a priori fashion. \n\nIn fact, Reinach argues that the common-sense assumption that a\nreprehensible deed is actually worse when done without a second\nthought—an assumption that contradicts the prevailing wisdom of\ncriminal law—more properly reflects the direct moral significance\nof deliberation. It is good for people to consider what they do.\nFailure to deliberate about a crime implies either a fundamental\ndisregard for or an insensitivity to values—and neither seems to\nreduce the culpability of a criminal act. Thus, Reinach concludes that\nthe law is mistaken in attaching more severe punishment to deliberate\nthan to non-deliberate crimes. \n\nReinach's major work, “The A priori Foundations\nof the Civil Law” (1913) begins with the following claim: \n\nReinach here refers specifically to claims and obligations. He\nasserts that they exist just as much as do trees and houses. Clearly,\nthey are not physical entities, but neither are they mental. They do\nindeed presuppose a person as their “bearer”—that is,\nreal claims and obligations always belong to someone. In addition,\npsychological properties may correspond to claims and obligations; for\nexample, one may feel entitled or feel obligated. However, if\nI accept a car loan and contractually agree to pay back the loan over a\n36-month period, my obligation does not cease to exist even if such\nfeelings fade away and even if I forget about the obligation\ncompletely. The very fact that a claim or obligation may last for years\nwithout change speaks against any alleged reduction to something\npsychological, for there is nothing in the psychological (or indeed in\nthe physical) domain that remains static over time. \n\nIn the Logical Investigations, Husserl developed a thesis\nadvanced by his teacher Brentano to the effect that all mental acts are\nintentional, that is, that they are directed towards an object. Husserl\nmaintained that all intentional experiences are in this sense\n‘objectifying acts’. \n\nHusserl's account of meaning builds upon this theory. All uses\nof language are, he says, referential. Accordingly, Husserl viewed acts\nsuch as questions or commands as masked assertions. The command\n“sit down on the chair” he interpreted as a statement to\nthe effect that “your sitting down on the chair is my current\nrequest.” \n\nIt was in critical reaction to such theses that Reinach developed\nhis theory of social acts (Smith 1990), a theory which bears\nstriking similarities to the theory of speech acts later developed by\nAustin and Searle. \n\nBoth promising and communicating one's intention to do\nsomething, according to Reinach, belong to the category of what he\ncalls “spontaneous” acts, i.e. acts which involve a\nsubject's bringing something about within his own psychic sphere,\nas contrasted with passive experiences of, say, feeling a pain or\nhearing an explosion (1913, p. 706, Eng. p. 18). Certain types of\nspontaneous act are such as to require as a matter of necessity a\nlinguistic utterance or some other overt performance of a non-natural\nand rule-governed sort. This does not hold of judging or deciding, nor\neven of forgiving, but it does hold of apologizing, commanding, or\naccusing. We may accordingly divide spontaneous acts into two classes,\nwhich we might call internal and external, according to whether the\nact's being brought to overt expression is a separable or an\ninseparable moment of the relevant complex whole. \n\nActs are divided further into self-directable and\nnon-self-directable. Self-directable acts are such that the subject\ntoward whom they are directed may be identical with the subject of the\nact (as in cases of self-pity, self-hatred, etc.). Non-self-directable\nacts, on the other hand, such as forgiving or praying, demand an alien\nsubject. A peculiarity of certain external and non-self-directable acts\nis that the relevant utterance must of necessity be\nnot only directed toward a certain subject but also registered or\ngrasped by this subject in a further act: a command must be received\nand understood by those to whom it is addressed (something which does\nnot apply, for example, to an act of blessing or cursing). It is part\nof the essential structure of a command that it be an action of a\nsubject which is spontaneous, intentional, non-self-directable and in\nneed of being grasped by the subject towards whom it is addressed. The\nsame holds also of requests, admonishments, questionings, informings,\nanswerings, and many other types of act. (Reinach 1913, p. 707, Eng.\npp. 19f.) Each social act constitutes an inner unity of deliberate\nexecution and deliberate utterance. The experience is here impossible\nin the absence of the utterance. And the utterance for its part is not\nsomething that is added to the experience as an incidental extra; it\nstands in the service of the social act and is necessary in order that\nthe latter should fulfill its announcing function. \n\nReinach mentions many social acts in his treatise on “The\nA Priori Foundations of the Civil Law”\n(1913)—commanding, requesting, warning, questioning and\nanswering, informing, enacting, revoking, transferring, granting, and\nwaiving of claims—but he devotes the most attention to the act\nof promising. Drawing on the theory of essences or intrinsically\nintelligible structures referred to above, Reinach offers the\nfollowing examples of a priori truths about what he sees as\nthe intrinsically intelligible structure instantiated through the\nperformance of a promising act: \n\nReinach maintains that such truths are not merely necessary and\nuniversal, but also informative, thus that they are examples of truths\nthat are both a priori and synthetic. \n\nReinach's views are in this respect opposed to those of Searle\n(1969), who argued that promising is a social institution that can be\nexplained in terms of so-called constitutive rules analogous to the\nrules of chess (Zaibert and Smith 2007). Once one stipulates the\nrules, on this account, then certain necessary truths can be derived.\nReinach, in contrast, held that promising is a sui generis\nphenomenon that is not invented but rather discovered, as is seen in\nthe contrast between promising and those elements of a code of law\nwhich truly are constructed, for example specific rules concerning\nprimogeniture or the discharging of liens. Reinach speculates that an\nindividual who orally contracts to rent a piece of property for three\nyears may be surprised to learn that, in German law, this contract is\nmade for an “indefinite length of time.” In contrast,\nsomeone who waives a claim will hardly be surprised by the fact that\nthe claim is now extinguished. The latter, in Reinach's terms,\nflows from the very essence of a claim and of the act of waiving a\nclaim, and in this it contrasts sharply with the non-intuitive\narbitrariness of the rules of chess. \n\nReinach next surveys Hume, who familiarly provides an account of why\na promise is binding which rests on the idea that there is a certain\nsort of sui generis experience which becomes expressed in a\npromise and which is somehow binding on the subject but which is at the\nsame time analogous to experiences of resolving, wishing, willing in\nthat it can be present also without any accompanying\nexpression. Reinach rejects this account – denying that such an\nexperience could exist – and rejects also a variety of other\npsychologistic and consequentialistic theories because they are, he\nclaims, seeking an explanation of a phenomenon so basic that it cannot\nbe further elucidated in terms of anything more simple. As he himself\nexpresses it: \n\nIn this passage, Reinach summarizes his view not only of promising,\nbut also of phenomenological philosophy itself. The central task of\nphenomenology is to describe faithfully what is given in experience,\npreferring knowledge that is immediate and intuitive to that which is\nknown indirectly through deduction or other means.","contact.mail":"phismith@buffalo.edu","contact.domain":"buffalo.edu"}]
