Historical examples of such theories\narguably include Michael Dummett’s semantic antirealism (i.e.,\nthe view that any truth is verifiable), mathematical constructivism\n(i.e., the view that the truth of a mathematical formula depends on\nthe mental constructions mathematicians use to prove those formulas),\nHilary Putnam’s internal realism (i.e., the view that truth is\nwhat we would believe in ideal epistemic circumstances), Charles\nSanders Peirce’s pragmatic theory of truth (i.e., that truth is\nwhat we would agree to at the limit of inquiry), logical positivism\n(i.e., the view that meaning is giving by verification conditions),\nKant’s transcendental idealism (i.e., that all knowledge is\nknowledge of appearances), and George Berkeley’s idealism (i.e.,\nthat to be is to be perceivable). \n\n\nThe operative concept of “knowability” remains elusive but is\nmeant to fall somewhere between equating truth uninformatively with\nwhat God would know and equating truth naively with what humans\nactually know. Equating truth with what God would know does not\nimprove intelligibility, and equating it with what humans actually\nknow fails to appreciate the objectivity and discoverability of truth.\nThe middle way, what we might call moderate antirealism, can\nbe characterized logically somewhere in the ballpark of the\nknowability principle:\n\n\\[\\tag{K Principle}\n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp),\n\\]\n\n\nwhich says, formally, for all propositions \\(p\\), if \\(p\\)\nthen it is possible to know that \\(p\\). \n\n\nThe great problem for the middle way is Fitch’s paradox. It\nis the proof that shows (in a normal modal logic augmented with the\nknowledge operator) that “all truths are knowable” entails “all\ntruths are known”:\n\n\\[\\tag{K Paradox}\n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp) \\vdash \\forall p(p \\rightarrow Kp).\n\\]\n\n\nAs such the proof does the interesting work in collapsing moderate\nanti-realism into naive idealism. \n\n\nWhat’s the paradox? Timothy Williamson (2000b) says the knowability\nparadox is not a paradox; it’s an\n“embarrassment”––an embarrassment to various brands of\nantirealism that have long overlooked a simple counterexample. He\nnotes it’s “an affront” to various philosophical theories, but\nnot to common sense. Others disagree. The paradox isn’t that the\nFitch proof swiftly threatens the middle way. It’s that the\nFitch proof, employing minimal epistemic modal resources, collapses\nthe middle way into the naive way. The paradox, as articulated in\nKvanvig (2006) and Brogaard and Salerno (2008), is that moderate\nantirealism appears not to be expressible as a distinct thesis,\nlogically weaker than naive idealism. That is interesting and\ntroublesome independently of one’s attitude for or against moderate\nantirealism.\n\nThe literature on the knowability paradox emerges in response to a\nproof first published by Frederic Fitch in his 1963 paper, “A\nLogical Analysis of Some Value Concepts.” Theorem 5, as it was\nthere called, threatens to collapse a number of modal and epistemic\ndifferences. Let ignorance be the failure to know some truth. Then\nTheorem 5 collapses a commitment to contingent ignorance into a\ncommitment to necessary ignorance. For it shows that the existence of\ntruths in fact unknown entails the existence of truths necessarily\nunknown. Formally,  \nThe converse of Theorem 5 is trivial (since truth entails\npossibility), so Fitch goes most of the way toward erasing any logical\ndifference between the existence of contingent ignorance and the\nexistence of necessary unknowability.  \nIt is however the contrapositive of Theorem 5 that is usually referred\nto as the paradox:  \nIt tells us that if any truth can be known then it follows that every\ntruth is in fact known.  \nThe earliest version of the proof was conveyed to Fitch by an\nanonymous referee in 1945. In 2005 we discovered that Alonzo Church\nwas that referee (Salerno 2009b). His reports are published in their\nentirety in Church (2009). Fitch apparently did not take the result to\nbe paradoxical. He published the proof in 1963 to avert a kind of\n“conditional fallacy” that threatened his informed-desire\nanalysis of value. The analysis roughly says: \\(x\\) is valuable\nto \\(s\\) just in case there is a truth \\(p\\) such that were\n\\(s\\) to known \\(p\\) then she would desire \\(x\\). The\nexistence of unknowable truths ultimately explains why he restricts\nthe propositional variables to knowable propositions. For an\nunknowable truth provides for an impossible antecedent in Fitch’s\ncounterfactual, and ultimately trivializes the analysis. Since Fitch’s\ntheory of value is not the context in which the paradox is widely\ndiscussed, we will say no more about it here.  \nRediscovered in Hart and McGinn (1976) and Hart (1979), the result was\ntaken to be a refutation of verificationism, the view that all\nmeaningful statements (and so all truths) are verifiable. After all,\nif one accepts the knowability principle,\n\\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp)\\), she is\ncommitted to the absurd claim that all truths are known. Mackie (1980)\nand Routley (1981), among others at the time, point to difficulties\nwith this general position but ultimately agree that Fitch’s result is\na refutation of the claim that all truths are knowable, and that\nvarious forms of verificationism are imperiled for related reasons.\nSince the early eighties, however, there has been considerable effort\nto analyze the proof as paradoxical. Why after all should it be that\nan epistemic theory of truth collapses possible knowledge into actual\nknowledge? Intuitively, that truth is to be understood in terms of the\nepistemic capacities of non-omniscient agents is at least a coherent\nposition—a position distinct from and more plausible than the\nthesis that all truths are known. Moreover, it has been thought\nstrange that sophisticated versions of the epistemic theory of truth\nshould fall prey to such swift deduction. Hence, the Church-Fitch\nproof has come to be known as the paradox of knowability.\n \nThere is no consensus about whether and where the proof goes wrong. We\nuse this entry to lay out the proof and explore a range of proposed\ntreatments. \nFitch’s reasoning involves quantifying into sentence position. Our\npropositional variables \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) will take\ndeclarative statements as substituends. Let \\(K\\) be the\nepistemic operator ‘it is known by someone at some time\nthat.’ Let \\(\\Diamond\\) be the modal operator ‘it is possible\nthat’. \nSuppose the knowability principle (KP)—that all truths are\nknowable by somebody at some time: \nAnd suppose that collectively we are non-omniscient, that there is an\nunknown truth: \nIf this existential claim is true, then so is an instance of it:  \nNow consider the instance of KP substituting line 1 for the variable\n\\(p\\) in KP:  \nIt follows trivially that it is possible to know the conjunction\nexpressed at line 1: \nHowever, it can be shown independently that it is impossible to know\nthis conjunction. Line 3 is false.  \nThe independent result presupposes two very modest epistemic\nprinciples: first, knowing a conjunction entails knowing each of the\nconjuncts. Second, knowledge entails truth. Respectively, \nAlso presupposed are two modest modal principles: first, all theorems\nare necessary. Second, necessarily \\(\\neg p\\) entails that\n\\(p\\) is impossible. Respectively, \nConsider the independent result: \nLine 9 contradicts line 3. So a contradiction follows from KP and\nNonO. The advocate of the view that all truths are knowable must deny\nthat we are non-omniscient:  \nAnd it follows from that that all truths are actually known:  \nThe ally of the view that all truths are knowable (by somebody at some\ntime) is forced absurdly to admit that every truth is known (by\nsomebody at some time).  \nIn this section we inspect the prospects for treating Fitch’s\nreasoning as invalid. Is Fitch’s epistemic reasoning in order? Is the\nlogic of knowability classical logic? More to the point: does the\nknowability principle carry with it special considerations that\nwarrant the revision of classical logic? If so, does this logical\nrevision invalidate Fitch’s reasoning? And if the reasoning is invalid, are\nthere closely related paradoxes that threaten the knowability\nprinciple without violating the relevant logical standards?  \nThe problem with Fitch’s reasoning is not with either of the epistemic\ninferences A or B. Though some have argued that knowing a conjunction\ndoes not entail knowing the conjuncts (Nozick 1981), Williamson (1993)\nand Jago (2010) have shown that versions of the paradox do not require\nthis distributive assumption. And questions about the factivity of\n\\(K\\) may be defused rather quickly, since related paradoxes\nemerge replacing the factive operator “It is known that”\nwith a non-factive operators, such as ‘It is rationally believed\nthat’ (Mackie 1980: 92; Edgington 1985: 558–559; Tennant\n1997: 252–259; Wright 2000: 357).  \nDeep and interesting discussions of the epistemic operators and/or\ntemporal analogs in the context of Fitch’s paradox appear in many\npapers. Burgess (2009) considers the temporal analogs. van Benthem\n(2004; 2009), van Ditmarsh, et al. (2012), Berto et al. (forthcoming)\nand Holliday (2018) explore the problem in dynamic epistemic\nframeworks. Palczewski (2007), Kelp and Pritchard (2009), Chase et al.\n(2018), and Heylen (forthcoming) consider non-factive notions of\nknowledge and knowability. Linsky (2009), Paseau (2008), Jago (2010),\nCarrara et al. (2011), and Rosenblatt (2014) debate the prospects for\ntyping knowledge.  \nWilliamson (1982) argues that Fitch’s proof is not a refutation of\nanti-realism, but rather a reason for the anti-realist to accept\nintuitionistic logic. Owing to a verificationist (or constructivist)\nreading of negation and existential quantification, intuitionistic\nlogic validates neither the elimination of double negation,  \nnor the following quantifier exchange rule:  \nWithout double negation elimination one cannot derive Fitch’s\nconclusion ‘all truths are known’ (at line 11) from\n‘there is not a truth that is unknown’ (line 10). Consider\nline 10,  \nFrom this we may intuitionistically derive  \nBut notice without double negation elimination,  \ndoes not entail  \nSuppose \nand suppose \\(p\\) for conditional introduction. And suppose\n\\(\\neg Kp\\) for reductio. We may conjoin \\(p\\) with\n\\(\\neg Kp\\) to get \nThis contradicts our primary assumption. So, by reductio,\n\\(\\neg \\neg Kp\\). Without double negation elimination, we cannot\nconclude \\(Kp\\), and so, may not introduce the conditional \nThe intuitionist is however committed, by conditional introduction, to\n \nThere is some debate about whether this consequence is sufficiently\ntroublesome, but the intuitionistic anti-realist takes solace in the\nfact that she is not committed to the blatantly absurd claim that all\ntruths are known. Very interesting discussion concerning the hopes and\ndreams of intuitionistic antrealism in this context appears in Murzi\n(2010; 2012), Murzi et al. (2009) and Zardini(2015). \nSince Fitch’s reasoning is intuitionistically valid through line 10, the\nintuitionist anti-realist must accept that no truths are unknown:\n\\(\\neg \\exists p(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). Arguably\nthis is harmful enough, for it appears that the anti-realist cannot\ngive credence to the truism that (individually and collectively) we\nare non-omniscient. Williamson responds that the intuitionist\nanti-realist may naturally express our non-omniscience as “not\nall truths are known”:  \nThis claim is classically, but not intuitionistically, equivalent to\nthe non-omniscience thesis,  \nThat is because in intuitionistic logic the quantifier exchange rule,\n\\(\\neg \\forall x\\P[x] \\vdash \\exists x \\neg\\P[x],\\) is not\nunrestrictedly valid. Importantly the expression of non-omniscience at\nline \\(12, \\neg \\forall p(p \\rightarrow Kp)\\), is only classically,\nand not intuitionistically, inconsistent with line \\(10, \\neg \\exists\np(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). So the intuitionist anti-realist can\nconsistently give expression to the truism that we are non-omniscient\n(with line 12) while accepting the intuitionistic consequence derived\nat line 10. In effect, the anti-realist admits both that no truths are\nunknown and that not all truths are known. The satisfiability of this\nclaim on intuitionistic grounds is demonstrated by Williamson (1988,\n1992).  \nA deeper problem is said to remain for the intuitionist anti-realist.\nFitch’s paradox rests on the assumption that there are unknown truths.\nBut consider the intuitionistically weaker assumption that there are\nundecided statements, that is, some \\(p\\), such that \\(p\\)\nis unknown and \\(\\neg p\\) is unknown. Formally,  \nIf (Und) is true, then so is an instance of it:  \nAnd notice that the intuitionistically acceptable conclusion at line\n\\(10, \\neg \\exists p(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\), is\nintuitionistically equivalent to the universal claim,  \nDeriving \\(\\neg Kp \\rightarrow \\neg p\\) and \\(\\neg K\\neg p \\rightarrow\n\\neg \\neg p\\) from (ii), and applying the conjuncts of (i),\nrespectively, gives us the contradiction \\(\\neg p \\wedge \\neg \\neg\np\\). The intuitionist anti-realist is forced to admit absurdly that\nthere are no undecided statements:  \nThe above argument is given by Percival (1990: 185). Since it is\nintutionistically acceptable, it is meant to show that the\nintuitionist anti-realist is still in trouble.  \nIn reply, the anti-realist again may utilize Williamson’s strategy\njointly to revise logic and reconstruct an expression of the epistemic\ntruism. Embrace only the intuitionistic consequences of KP (in this\ncase, that there are no undecided statements), and give expression to\nthe truism about undecidedness by claiming that not all statements are\ndecided: \nThe reinterpretation of the undecidedness intuition at line (iv) gives\nus a claim that is classically, but not intuitionistically, equivalent\nto Und. And so, it is only classically, and not intuitionistically,\ninconsistent with the inference at line (iii). \nRelated undecidedness paradoxes of knowability are discussed in Wright\n(1987: 311), Williamson (1988: 426) and Brogaard and Salerno (2002:\n146–148). The undecidedness paradoxes give the anti-realist even\nfurther reason to revise classical logic in favor of intuitionistic\nlogic. When accompanied by a reconstrual of our epistemically modest\nintuitions, logical space for anti-realism is reclaimed. \nWhat all this suggests is that intuitionist anti-realism is coherent.\nBut is the approach well motivated? Is either the revision of\nclassical logic or the clever reconstrual of our epistemic intuitions\nad hoc? \nThe anti-realist’s purported right to give up classical logic in favor\nof intuitionistic logic has been defended independently. The argument\nfinds its roots in Dummett (1976, and elsewhere). More recent\ninterpretations of the anti-realist’s argument for logical revision\nappear in Wright (1992: Chp. 2), Tennant (1997: Chp. 7), and Salerno\n(2000). The details and success or failure of the arguments for\nlogical revision is a topic for another time. For now it is enough to\npoint out that the threat of Fitch’s paradox is not the anti-realist’s\nsole motivation for favoring a non-classical logic. \nWhat about the reconstrual of our epistemic intuitions? Is it well\nmotivated? According to Kvanvig (1995) it is not. Why should we grant\nthat the intuitionistic treatments of non-omniscience and\nundecidedness are better than our initial common-sense treatments? And\nhow is the anti-realist to explain away the apparent triviality of\nthese common-sense treatments? These questions have not been\nanswered. \nMoreover, some of the intuitionistic consequences of KP are thought to\nbe bad enough. Even if ‘there are no unknown truths’ or\n‘there are no undecided statements’ are intuitionistically\ntolerable, the following appears not to be: If \\(p\\) is unknown then\n\\(\\neg p\\). Formally, \\(\\neg Kp \\rightarrow \\neg p\\). This claim\nfollows intuitionistically from \\(p \\rightarrow \\neg \\neg Kp\\), which\nwe have already established as an intuitionistic consequence of\nKP. But \\(\\neg Kp \\rightarrow \\neg p\\) appears to be false for\nempirical discourse. Why should the fact that nobody ever knows \\(p\\)\nbe sufficient for the falsity of \\(p\\)? See Percival (1990) and\nWilliamson (1988) for further discussions of this and related problems\nsurrounding the application of intuitionist anti-realism to empirical\ndiscourse.  DeVidi and Solomon (2001) disagree. They argue that the\nintuitionistic consequences are not unacceptable to one interested in\nan epistemic theory of truth—indeed they are central to an\nepistemic theory of truth. \nFor these reasons an appeal to intuitionist logic, by itself, is\ngenerally taken to be unsatisfying in dealing with the paradoxes of\nknowability. Exceptions include Burmüdez (2009), Dummett (2009),\nRasmussen (2009) and Maffezioli, Naibo & Negri (2013). \nAnother challenge to the logic of Fitch’s paradox is mentioned in\nRoutley (1981) and defended by Beall (2000). The thought is that the\ncorrect logic of knowability is paraconsistent. In a paraconsistent\nlogic contradictions do not trivialize a theory, because they do not\n‘explode’. That is, in a paraconsistent logic the\ninference from \\(p \\wedge \\neg p\\) to an arbitrary\nconclusion \\(r\\) is not valid. Owing to this consideration some\ncontradictions are permitted and thought to be possible.  \nBeall contends that (1) Fitch’s proof turns on the assumption that,\nfor all statements \\(p\\), the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is impossible and (2) we have independent evidence\nfor thinking \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for some \\(p\\).\nThe independent evidence lies in the\n paradox of the knower\n (not to be\nmistaken with the paradox of knowability). The relevant version of the\nknower paradox may be demonstrated by considering the following\nself-referential sentence: \nAssume for the sake of argument that \\(k\\) is known. Then,\npresuming that knowledge entails truth, \\(k\\) is true. But\n\\(k\\) says that \\(k\\) is unknown. So \\(k\\) is unknown.\nConsequently, \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. But then our\nassumption (i.e., that \\(k\\) is known) is false, and provably so.\nAnd, granting that a proven falsehood is known to be false, it follows\nthat it is known that \\(k\\) is unknown. That is to say, it is\nknown that \\(k\\). But we have already shown that if it is known\nthat \\(k\\) then \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. So it is\nproven that \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. It is provably the\ncase that the full description of our knowledge includes both\n\\(K(k)\\) and \\(\\neg K(k)\\). That is the\nknower paradox. \nBeall suggests that the knower gives us some independent evidence for\nthinking \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for some \\(p\\), that\nthe full description of human knowledge has the interesting feature of\nbeing inconsistent. With a paraconsistent logic, one may accept this\nwithout triviality. And so it is suggested that one go paraconsistent\nand embrace \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) as a true consequence\nof the knowability principle. Beall concludes that Fitch’s reasoning,\nwithout a proper reply to the knower, is ineffective against the\nknowability principle. For Fitch’s reasoning allegedly turns on the\nassumption that, for all \\(p\\), it is impossible that \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). \nNotice that our presentation of Fitch’s reasoning makes no explicit\nmention of the assumption that \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is\nimpossible. So here we attempt to pinpoint exactly where Fitch’s\nreasoning goes wrong on the above account. It is claimed at line 9 (in\nthe first section of this entry) that \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible. Of course \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) entails the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). And so, if the reasoning is that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible because\ncontradictions are impossible, then Beall would be directly attacking\nthe argument presented herein. But notice the argument here is subtly\ndifferent. It goes like this. \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) entails the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). So, by reductio, \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is false. By necessitation, it follows that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is necessarily false.\nDepending on the paraconsistent logic, the paraconsistist may object\nto use of reductio, or may object to other inferences. The claim that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible (at line\n9) is inferred from this claim that \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is necessarily false. This may trouble the\nparaconsistentist. By the lights of one living with contradiction, it\nmay not follow that an inconsistent statement is impossible even if it\nis necessarily false. After all, on this account a necessarilly false\nstatement may be both false and true at some world, in which case the\nstatement is both necessarily false and possible. If this is right\nthen the inference from \\(\\Box \\neg p\\) to \\(\\neg \\Diamond p\\)\nhas counterexamples and may not be employed to infer\n\\(\\neg \\Diamond K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) from\n\\(\\Box \\neg K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). \nBeall’s insights turn on a number of things: (1) the strength of the\nindependent evidence for true epistemic contradictions, (2) the\nadequacy of the proposed resolutions to the knower paradox, (3) the\nquestion of whether Fitch’s reasoning is ineffective without a\nresolution to the knower and (4) an interpretation for \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) that invalidates the relevant inference (from\n\\(\\Box \\neg p\\) to \\(\\neg \\Diamond p)\\) while remaining true\nto the role played by \\(\\Diamond\\) in the knowability principle. We leave\nthese problems for further debate. But compare with Wansing (2002),\nwhere a paraconsistent constructive relevant modal logic with strong\nnegation is proposed to block the paradox. \nMore recent developments of the paraconsistent approach appear in\nBeall (2009) and Priest (2009). \nThe remainder of proposals are restriction strategies. They\nreinterpret KP by restricting its universal quantifier. In effect, the\nrestriction strategies invalidate Fitch’s reasoning by prohibiting the\nsubstitution-instances of KP that lead to paradox. In this section we\nexamine semantic reasons for restricting the universal quantifer in\nKP. \nEdgington (1985) offers a situation-theoretic diagnosis of Fitch’s\nparadox. She claims that the problem lies with the failure to\ndistinguish between ‘knowing in a situation that\n\\(p\\)’ and ‘knowing that \\(p\\) is the case in a\nsituation’. In the latter case, the situation is (at least in\npart) that which the knowledge is about. In the former case, the\nsituation is that in which the knowledge is had. For instance, I may\nknow in my actual situation that I would be in pain in a\ncounterfactual situation where my tooth is pulled. Importantly, the\nsituation in which the knowledge takes place may be different from the\nsituation that my knowledge is about. In a situation in which my tooth\nis not pulled, I may know things that are about a situation\nin which my tooth is pulled.  \nWhat are situations? The above example seems to suggest that\nsituations are worlds. But situations may be less complete than\nworlds. That is, they need not have truth-values fixed for statements\nthat are irrelevant to the context. Consider an example by\nLinstöm: I may know in a given perceptual situation \\(s\\)\nthat John (one of the participants of a card game) has the best hand\nand that none of the participants knows this. In this case my\nknowledge is of one situation \\(s^*\\), the card game, but my\nknowledge is acquired in a different situation \\(s\\), my\nperceptual situation. Situation \\(s^*\\) is not only determined,\nbut its relevant information is limited, by the context of the card\ngame. And \\(s\\) is fixed and limited by the context of the\nperceptual situation. Edgington prefers talk of situations rather than\nworlds, because knowledge of non-actual situations, unlike knowledge\nof non-actual worlds, does not require knowledge of an infinite amount\nof detail. \nMaking explicit the situation-theoretic distinction between\n‘knowing in’ and ‘knowing about’, we may\nreinterpret the knowability principle: for each statement \\(p\\)\nand situation \\(s\\), if \\(p\\) is true in \\(s\\) then\nthere is a situation \\(s^*\\) in which it is known that \\(p\\)\nis true in \\(s\\). Edgington requires of knowability the less\ngeneral thesis: if \\(p\\) is true in an actual situation\n\\(s\\) then there is a possible situation \\(s^*\\) in which it\nis known that \\(p\\) is true in \\(s\\). Call this\nE-knowability or EKP: \nwhere A is the actuality operator which may be read ‘In some\nactual situation’, and \\(\\Diamond\\) is the possibility operator to be\nread ‘In some possible situation’. \nAs we see, EKP restricts the knowability principle to actual truths,\nby saying \\(p\\) is actually true only if there is a possible\nsituation in which it is known that \\(p\\) is actually true.  \nThe important suggestion is this. Just as there may be actual\nknowledge of what is counterfactually the case, there may be\ncounterfactual knowledge of what is actually the case. In fact, in\nlight of Fitch’s proof, E-knowability requires the existence of such\nnon-actual knowledge. Let us see why. \nActual truths of the form \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) will have\nto be E-knowable. But \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) cannot be\nactually known to be actually the case. The reasoning here is exactly\nanalogous to Fitch’s reasoning.  \nThe lesson is this. Since, for some \\(p, p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is actually the case, E-knowability commits us to\npossible knowledge that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is actually\nthe case. Since this knowledge cannot be actual, E-knowability\nrequires non-actual knowledge of what is actually the case.\nE-knowability then denies the following assumption: given a statement\n\\(p\\), if it is known that \\(p\\) in \\(s\\), then in\n\\(s\\) it is known that \\(p\\). By Edgington’s analysis it is\nexactly this implicit assumption that leads Fitch’s reasoning astray.\nThe paradox is blocked without it. \nSince the actuality operator rigidly designates actual\nsituations, the truth-value of statements of the form \\(\\A p\\) will\nnot vary across possible situations. ‘\\(\\A p\\)’ entails\n‘in every situation \\(\\A p\\)’. Thus, as Edgington is\naware, if \\(\\A p\\) then it is necessary that \\(\\A p\\). This by\nitself poses a problem for EKP. The criticism is that Edgington’s\napproach is not general enough. Anyone who is likely to endorse the\nknowability principle is likely to think that it holds of all truths,\nnot just those necessary truths involving the actuality operator. EKP\nappears to be a very limited thesis failing to specify an epistemic\nconstraint on contingent truth (Williamson 1987a). \nFurther criticisms emerge when we attempt to say something informative\nabout what constitutes non-actual knowledge of what is actually the\ncase. If there is such non-actual knowledge, there is non-actual\nthought about an actual situation. So the non-actual thinker somehow\nhas a concept of an actual situation. But how is it possible for a\nnon-actual thinker to have a concept that is specifically about\nsituations in this the actual world. It will not do for the thinker to\nexpress the thought ‘actually \\(p\\)’, since\n‘actually’ will designate rigidly only situations in her\nown world. Moreover, since there is no causal link between the actual\nworld \\(w_1\\) and the relevant non-actual world\n\\(w_2\\), it is unclear how non-actual thought in\n\\(w_2\\) can be uniquely about \\(w_1\\)\n(Williamson, 1987a: 257–258). Therefore, it is unclear how there\nmight be non-actual knowledge about what is actually the case. \nOf course actual knowledge about the non-actual is no better at\nsingling out worlds. The special problem for the non-actual knower is\nthat the content of her thought must be precisely the content that we\ngrasp when we consider the truth of \\(\\A p\\). Being in the actual\nworld we are able to single out this world uniquely. When we consider\nthe truth of \\(\\A p\\) our context fixes the content of A\nspecifically. So if it really is \\(\\A p\\) that is knowable by a\nnon-actual knower, then it must be \\(\\A p\\) that she\ngrasps—that is, it must be the very same concept that we grasp.\nBut how this is possible is precisely the problem. \nRelated and additional criticisms of Edgington’s proposal appear in\nWright (1987), Williamson (1987b; 2000b) and Percival (1991). Formal\ndevelopments on the proposal, including points that address some of\nthese concerns appear in Rabinowicz and Segerberg (1994),\nLindström (1997), Rückert (2003), Edgington (2010), Fara\n(2010), Proietti and Sandu (2010), and Schlöder (forthcoming). \nKvanvig (1995) accuses Fitch of a modal fallacy. The fallacy is an\nillicit substitution into a modal context. Consider a familiar modal\nfallacy. For all persons \\(x\\), there is a possible world in\nwhich \\(x\\) is not the inventor of bifocals. (Even Ben Franklin,\nthe actual inventor of bifocals, might not have invented them.)\nTherefore, there is a possible world in which the inventor of bifocals\nis not the inventor of bifocals. We can represent the argument\nformally. Let our quantifiers range over persons, and let\n‘\\(i\\)’ be the non-rigid designator ‘the\ninventor of bifocals’. Consider the argument:  \nAlthough anyone might not have been the inventor of bifocals, it does\nnot follow (in fact it is false) that it is possible that the inventor\nof bifocals is not identical to the inventor of bifocals. After all,\nit is necessary that the inventor of bifocals is the inventor of\nbifocals.  \nThe lesson is that we may not substitute unrestrictedly into modal\ncontexts. Substitution into modal contexts, we might say, is permitted\nonly if the substituting terms are rigid designators. In the case of\nFitch’s result, our terms are sentences. The knowability principle,\n\\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp)\\), apparently\nallows us to substitute any sentence whatsoever for \\(p\\). But\nnotice that our quantifier has wide scope relative to \\(\\Diamond\\). We would\nexpect that the lessons of quantified modal logic carry over to\nquantified propositional modal logic. If so, then we may not\nsubstitute for \\(p\\) any statement that does not designate\nrigidly. \nOn Kvanvig’s diagnosis, the problem with Fitch’s reasoning is that\nwhen he substituted the conjunction \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\)\nfor \\(p\\) in KP (at line 2 of the result), he did not stop to\ndetermine whether \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is rigid. Kvanvig\nmaintains that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is not rigid. So\nFitch’s result is fallacious owing to an illicit substitution into a\nmodal context. But we may reconstrue \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\)\nas rigid. And when we do, the paradox evaporates. \nKvanvig proposes that quantified expressions are non-rigid. The reason\nhe gives is that quantifiers designate different objects in different\npossible worlds. “Everyone in Jon’s Logic class must take the\nfinal” is about different students in different possible worlds.\nWere Sussie to have taken the class, the expression would have been\nabout her. But she decided not to take the class, so actually it is\nnot about her. \\(Kp\\) is an abbreviation for ‘it is known\nby somebody at some time that \\(p\\).’ So, \\(Kp\\) is\nimplicitly quantified. Explicitly it reads\n\\(\\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) which says there is\na being \\(x\\) and a time \\(t\\) such that \\(x\\) knows\nthat \\(p\\) at \\(t\\). Accordingly, on this account, the\nquantified expression that \\(Kp\\) abbreviates is non-rigid.\n\\(\\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) is about different\nbeings and times in different modal contexts. For instance, the\nexpression \\(\\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) is about\nactual beings and times. But embedded in a modal context, e.g.,\n\\(\\Diamond \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) the expression\nis about possible beings and times. It says, ‘there is a\npossible world in which there is a being \\(x\\) and time\n\\(t\\) such that \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\) at\n\\(t\\).’ \nNow consider the relevant instance of Fitch’s non-omniscience thesis:\n\\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). Unabbreviated it reads, \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) which\nsays \\(p\\) is true but nobody ever knows that \\(p\\). The\nquantified expression is, on this view, a non-rigid designator.\nUttered in the actual world, it is about actual beings and times. But,\nit is argued, embedded within the scope of a possibility operator the\ndesignation varies to be about possible beings and times. When Fitch\nsubstituted the true conjunction, \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) for \\(p\\)\nin the knowability principle, he substituted for \\(p\\) a\nnon-rigid designator, thereby altering the reference of the\nconjunction and perpetrating a modal fallacy. \nAlternatively, Kvanvig suggests, we may characterize \\(Kp\\)\nrigidly to say, ‘there is an actual being \\(x\\) and actual\ntime \\(t\\) such that it is known by \\(x\\) at \\(t\\) that\n\\(p\\).’ Since this expression designates rigidly (i.e., it\nmakes reference to the actual world regardless of the modal context in\nwhich it appears), it may be substituted for \\(p\\) in the\nknowability principle. The reinterpreted conjunction does not change\nits designation when embedded within the scope of \\(\\Diamond\\). Moreover, on\nthis reading of the conjunction, the paradox dissolves. It is possible\nto know that the reinterpreted conjunction is true. There is no\ncontradiction in supposing that some possible being at some possible\ntime knows that \\(p\\) is true but never known by an actual being\nat an actual time. The paradox dissolves. \nFurther discussion of modal fallacies and non-rigid statements appears\nin Brogaard and Salerno (2008) and Kennedy (2014). \nWilliamson (2000b) defends Fitch’s reasoning against Kvanvig’s charge.\nHe suggests that Kvanvig has no grounds for thinking that Fitch’s\nconjunction \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) does not\ndesignate rigidly. The reason Williamson gives is this. An expression\nis non-rigid if, when uttered in a fixed context, it varies its\nreference with the circumstances under which it is evaluated. But\nKvanvig gives no convincing reason for thinking that Fitch’s\nconjunction, as uttered in a fixed context, varies its reference in\nthis way. At best Kvanvig has shown that the conjunction varies its\nreference when uttered in varying contexts, since his\nargument is that a quantified sentence, when uttered at different\nworlds, will be about different objects. To think that this is\nsufficient for non-rigidity, Williamson complains, is to confuse\nnon-rigidity for indexicality. Importantly, indexicality does not\nimply non-rigidity. For instance, ‘I am tired’ is about\nme, and continues to be about me when I evaluate its truth-value in\ncounterfactual circumstances. The sentence might have been false. Had\nI gotten enough sleep, I would not be tired. Uttered in a fixed\ncontext, ‘I’ rigidly designates, even though it is an\nindexical. That is, even though, had it been uttered in a different\ncontext by somebody else, it would have been about somebody other than\nme. Analogously, even if quantified expressions are indexicals, it\ndoes not follow that they are non-rigid. And so, even if Fitch’s\nconjunction is an indexical expression, we have not been given a\nreason to think that it is non-rigid. If this is correct, then we have\nno grounds for thinking that Fitch has committed the modal fallacy in\nquestion. \nKvanvig (2006) replies and develops other interesting themes in the\nKnowability Paradox, which is the only monograph to date\ndedicated to the topic. \nThe foregoing restriction strategies involved semantic reasons for\nlimiting universal quantification. In those cases, KP was restricted\nin light of considerations about situations, possible worlds, or rigid\ndesignation. Another kind of restriction strategy is syntactic. It\nlimits the scope of universal quantification to those formulas that\nhave a certain logical form or stand in a certain provability\nrelation. Most generally,  \n\\(F\\) should then be a logical property that restricts the\nquantifier in some principled way.  \nTennant (1997) focuses on the property of being Cartesian: A statement\n\\(p\\) is Cartesian if and only if \\(Kp\\) is not provably\ninconsistent. Accordingly, he restricts the principle of knowability\nto Cartesian statements. Call this restricted knowability principle\nT-knowability or TKP:  \nNotice that T-knowability is free of the paradoxes that we have\ndiscussed. It is free of Fitch’s paradox and the related\n undecidedness paradox.\n For both results substitute the problematic Fitch conjunction,\n\\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for the variable in \\(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp\\), giving us \\((p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\n\\rightarrow \\Diamond K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). That is,\nthey require that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) be knowable if\ntrue (line 2 of Fitch’s result). But \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\)\nis not Cartesian, since \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\)\nis provably inconsistent (entailing the contradiction at line 6 of\nFitch’s result). In effect, TKP offers the most tolerant restriction\nneeded to prohibit the bothersome substitution. For it only prohibits\nsubstituting those statements for which it is logically impossible to\nknow.  \nDummett (2001) agrees that the knowability theorist’s error lies in\nproviding a blanket, rather than a restricted, knowability principle.\nAnd he agrees that the restriction should be syntactic. Dummett\nrestricts the principle of knowability to “basic”\nstatements and characterizes truth inductively from there. For\nDummett, \nwhere the logical constant on the right-hand side of each\nbiconditional clause is understood as subject to the laws of\nintuitionistic logic. \nDummett’s knowability principle or DKP, like Tennant’s, is not\nthreatened by the knowability paradoxes, and for the same reason. It\nrestricts the class of statements that are subject to knowability. For\nDummett’s case, the problematic Fitch conjunction, \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), being compound, and so not basic, cannot replace the\nvariable in \\(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp\\). The paradox is\nconsequently averted. \nThe relative merits of these two restrictions are weighed by Tennant\n(2002). Tennant’s restriction is the less demanding of the two, since\nit bars only the substitution of those statements that are logically\nunknowable, and so, only those statements that are responsible for the\nparadoxes. Dummett’s restriction, by comparison, bars not only the\nsubstitution of these propositions, but also the substitution of\nlogically complex proposition that are clearly knowable. Tennant also\npoints out, if the knowability principle is the primary anti-realist\nmotivation for revising classical logic, restricting that principle to basic\nstatements can undermine arguments against a classical treatment of\ncomplex statements.  \nThe main objections to the restriction strategies fall into two camps.\nIn the first camp we find the charge that a given syntactic\nrestriction on the knowability principle is not principled. From the\nsecond camp arise formulations of Fitch-like paradoxes that are not\naverted by the syntactic restrictions on knowable truth. \nFrom the first camp Hand and Kvanvig (1999) protest that TKP has not\nbeen restricted in a principled manner—in effect, that we have\nbeen given no good reason, other than the threat of paradox, to\nrestrict the principle to Cartesian statements. (An analogous claim\nmay be made of Dummett’s DKP.) Tennant (2001b) replies to Hand and\nKvanvig with general discussion about the admissibility of\nrestrictions in the practice of conceptual analysis and philosophical\nclarification. By drawing analogies between his own restriction and\nothers that are clearly admissible, he maintains that the Cartesian\nrestriction is not ad-hoc. He also points out that TKP,\nrather than the unrestricted KP, serves as the more interesting point\nof contention between the semantic realist and anti-realist. The\nrealist believes that it is possible for truth to be unknowable in\nprinciple. Fitch’s reasoning, at best, shows us that there is\nstructural unknowability, that is, unknowability that is a function of\nlogical considerations alone. But is there a more substantial kind of\nunknowability, for instance, unknowability that is a function of the\nrecognition-transcendence of the non-logical subject-matter? A realist\ndecrying the ad hoc nature of TKP (or DKP) fails to engage\nthe knowability theorist at the heart of the realism debate. \nOther complaints that Tennant’s restriction strategy is not principled\nappear in DeVidi and Kenyon (2003) and Hand (2003). Hand offers a way\nof restricting knowability in a principled manner. \nThese concerns may be waived upon noticing versions of the paradox\nthat do not violate the proposed restrictions on the knowability\nprinciple. Williamson (2000a) asks us to consider the following\nparadox. Let \\(p\\) be the decidable sentence ‘There is a\nfragment of Roman pottery at that spot.’ Let \\(n\\) rigidly\ndesignate the number of books actually now on my desk. Let \\(E\\)\nbe the predicate ‘is even.’ Williamson constructs the\nconjunction, \nand contends that it is Cartesian. Knowing it, apparently, does not\nentail a contradiction. If he is right, we can apply to it TKP, giving\n \nAdditionally, if \\(p\\) is true and \\(Kp\\) is false, then\nWilliamson’s conjunction is true. So,  \nLines (1) and (2) yield  \nAccepting the modest epistemic resources found in Fitch’s reasoning,\none can prove the following theorem:  \nHere is why. A conjunction is known only if its conjuncts are known.\nSo, if \\(K(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En))\\), then \\(Kp\\). And only\ntruths can be known. So, if \\(K(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En))\\), then\n\\(Kp \\rightarrow En\\). Of course, \\(Kp\\) and \\(Kp \\rightarrow En\\)\njointly entail \\(En\\). So theorem 4 is valid, if Fitch’s\nepistemic resources are. Now, 4 is a theorem, and so, holds in all\npossible worlds. So its consequent is possible if its antecedent is\npossible: \nFrom lines 3 and 5 we derive  \nSince \\(n\\) designates rigidly, it is not contingent whether\n\\(n\\) is even. It follows then that line 6 yields  \nAn analogous argument replacing ‘odd’ for\n‘even’ gives us  \nBut then we have a contradiction resting on TKP and Fitch’s\nconjunction, \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). The result involves substitutions\nof \\(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En)\\) and \\(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow \\neg\nEn)\\) for \\(p\\) in TKP, but Williamson maintains that neither violate\nthe Cartesian restriction. Paradox regained. \nTennant (2001a) takes issue with Williamson’s claim that \\(p\n\\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En)\\) is Cartesian. In the case where \\(n\\) is\nodd, \\(En\\) expresses a necessary falsehood (for instance, ‘13\nis even’). But then, line 4 tells us that \\(K(p \\wedge(Kp\n\\rightarrow En))\\) implies something that is necessarily false. And if\nthe falsity of ‘13 is even’ is a matter\nof logical necessity, then \\(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En)\\)\ncannot be consistently known and therefore is not Cartesian. Hence,\nwhen \\(n\\) is odd, the first part of Williamson’s proof\n(involving the predicate ‘is even’) does in fact violate\nthe Cartesian restriction. By contrast, Williamson’s conjunction\nis Cartesian when \\(En\\) is true. But, analogously, if the truth of\n\\(En\\) is a matter of logical necessity, then \\(p \\wedge(Kp\n\\rightarrow \\neg En)\\) cannot be consistently known and is therefore\nnot Cartesian. Hence, when \\(n\\) is even, the second part of\nWilliamson’s proof (involving the predicate ‘is\nodd’) violates the Cartesian restriction. Either way, Tennant\nargues, Williamson has not shown that TKP is an inadequate treatment\nof Fitch’s paradox. \nThe debate continues in Williamson (2009) and Tennant (2010). \nBrogaard and Salerno (2002) develop other Fitch-like paradoxes against\nthe restriction strategies. Note that Dummett’s knowability principle\nis a biconditional: \\(p \\leftrightarrow \\Diamond Kp\\), where\n\\(p\\) is basic. Tennant (2002) agrees that the knowability\nprinciple should preserve the factive nature of \\(\\Diamond\\)K. So Brogaard\nand Salerno begin with the following strengthened knowability\nprinciple: \nMoreover, pending further discussion of the logic of \\(K\\), it is\nnot implausible that the intuitionist knowability theorist wishes to\nvalidate the KK-principle:  \nThe principle says, necessarily, if \\(p\\) is known then it is\nknown that \\(p\\) is known. One other resource is used, namely,\nthe closure principle which says that the antecedent of a necessary\nconditional is possible only if the consequent is possible. \nIf these commitments are granted, one can derive Fitch’s result\nwithout violating Tennant’s Cartesian restriction: \nSKP is applied at lines 3 and 6 to \\(p\\) and \\(Kp\\),\nrespectively. And these substituends do not violate the Cartesian\nrestriction. Neither \\(Kp\\), nor \\(KKp\\), is\nself-contradictory. Nonetheless, the anti-realist is forced absurdly\nto admit that no truth is unknown.  \nArguably, this result threatens Dummett’s restricted knowability\nprinciple as well. But that depends on whether we have applied the\nprinciple to basic statements only. \\(p\\) is basic, but Dummett’s\ncharacterization of truth underdetermines the status of \\(Kp\\).\nPerhaps it is basic, since \\(Kp\\) is not truth-functionally\ncomplex. Nonetheless, the issue cannot be resolved without a\ndiscussion of \\(K\\). \nBrogaard and Salerno demonstrate other paradoxes against the\nrestriction strategies. Those further results do not presuppose a\ncommitment to the KK-principle. They hinge ultimately on the\nknowability theorist’s interpretation of \\(\\Diamond\\). When \\(\\Diamond\\) is\nmetaphysical possibility or governed by a logic at least as strong as\nS4, the strong knowability principle (appropriately restricted), and\ntaken as a necessary thesis, entails that there are no unknown truths.\nWhen \\(\\Diamond\\) is epistemic possibility, and the knowability principle is\ntreated as a necessary thesis that is known, the knowability principle\nentails that, necessarily, there are no undecided statements. Unlike\nthe undecidedness paradoxes of Wright (1987), Williamson (1988), and\nPercival (1990), the reasoning provided by Brogaard and Salerno does\nnot violate Tennant’s Cartesian restriction. A response to Brogaard\nand Salerno appears in Rosenkranz (2004). Further discussion of the\nCartesian restriction appears in Brogaard and Salerno (2006, 2008).\nTennant (2009) is a further development and defense of the Cartesian\nstrategy. A defense of the restriction strategy appears in Fischer\n(2013). \nMuch of what has been written on the knowability paradox comes in the\nform of attempts to express the relevant form of anti-realism without\nparadox. Proposals include Chalmers (2012), Dummett (2009), Edgington\n(2010), Fara (2010), Hand (2009, 2010), Jenkins (2005), Kelp and\nPritchard (2009), Linsky (2009), Hudson (2009), Restall (2009),\nTennant (2009), Alexander (2013), Dean & Kurokawa (2010), Proietti\n(2016).  \nChalmers (2002, 2012: chap. 2), for instance, defends the idea that\ngiven enough qualitative information about the world we could in\nprinciple know the truth value of any claim. More specifically, his\nscrutability thesis says, if \\(D\\) is a complete qualitative\ndescription of the world, then for all \\(T\\), it is knowable a priori that\n\\(D\\) (materially) implies \\(T\\). Importantly, the knowability paradox does\nnot threaten the claim that true Fitch-conjunctions are derivable a\npriori from a complete description of the world.  \nDummett takes \\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\neg \\neg Kp)\\) to be the best expression of his brand of\nanti-realism and embraces its intuitionistic consequences with open\narms. Edgington defends her knowability principle (viz., if actually \\(p\\)\nthen it is possible to know that actually \\(p)\\) by making the case for\nsome transworld knowability—specifically, in those cases where\nthe merely possible knower shares the relevant causal history with the\nactual world. Hand defends anti-realism by pointing to the distinction\nbetween a verification-type and its token performances, and argues\nthat the existence of a verification-type doesn’t entail its\nperformability. The lesson there is that the anti-realist should think\nabout truth less in terms of the performability of verification\nprocedures and more in terms of the existence of verification-types.\nAnd Linsky regiments the epistemic principles and reasoning with a\ntheory of types. The debates surrounding the proper characterization\nof semantic anti-realism go far beyond the scope of this entry. As for\nthe knowability proof itself, there continues to be no consensus on\nwhether and where it goes wrong.  \nNiche discussions of the paradox that don’t fit well into any of the\nabove sections include Salerno’s (2018) new paradox of happiness;\nKvanvig’s (2010) argument that the paradox threatens Christianity\nitself owing to its doctrine of the incarnation of Christ; and\nCresto’s (2017) argument that the knowability paradox raises doubts\nabout Reflection Principle as a requirement on rationality.

Historical examples of such theories\narguably include Michael Dummett’s semantic antirealism (i.e.,\nthe view that any truth is verifiable), mathematical constructivism\n(i.e., the view that the truth of a mathematical formula depends on\nthe mental constructions mathematicians use to prove those formulas),\nHilary Putnam’s internal realism (i.e., the view that truth is\nwhat we would believe in ideal epistemic circumstances), Charles\nSanders Peirce’s pragmatic theory of truth (i.e., that truth is\nwhat we would agree to at the limit of inquiry), logical positivism\n(i.e., the view that meaning is giving by verification conditions),\nKant’s transcendental idealism (i.e., that all knowledge is\nknowledge of appearances), and George Berkeley’s idealism (i.e.,\nthat to be is to be perceivable). \n\n\nThe operative concept of “knowability” remains elusive but is\nmeant to fall somewhere between equating truth uninformatively with\nwhat God would know and equating truth naively with what humans\nactually know. Equating truth with what God would know does not\nimprove intelligibility, and equating it with what humans actually\nknow fails to appreciate the objectivity and discoverability of truth.\nThe middle way, what we might call moderate antirealism, can\nbe characterized logically somewhere in the ballpark of the\nknowability principle:\n\n\\[\\tag{K Principle}\n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp),\n\\]\n\n\nwhich says, formally, for all propositions \\(p\\), if \\(p\\)\nthen it is possible to know that \\(p\\). \n\n\nThe great problem for the middle way is Fitch’s paradox. It\nis the proof that shows (in a normal modal logic augmented with the\nknowledge operator) that “all truths are knowable” entails “all\ntruths are known”:\n\n\\[\\tag{K Paradox}\n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp) \\vdash \\forall p(p \\rightarrow Kp).\n\\]\n\n\nAs such the proof does the interesting work in collapsing moderate\nanti-realism into naive idealism. \n\n\nWhat’s the paradox? Timothy Williamson (2000b) says the knowability\nparadox is not a paradox; it’s an\n“embarrassment”––an embarrassment to various brands of\nantirealism that have long overlooked a simple counterexample. He\nnotes it’s “an affront” to various philosophical theories, but\nnot to common sense. Others disagree. The paradox isn’t that the\nFitch proof swiftly threatens the middle way. It’s that the\nFitch proof, employing minimal epistemic modal resources, collapses\nthe middle way into the naive way. The paradox, as articulated in\nKvanvig (2006) and Brogaard and Salerno (2008), is that moderate\nantirealism appears not to be expressible as a distinct thesis,\nlogically weaker than naive idealism. That is interesting and\ntroublesome independently of one’s attitude for or against moderate\nantirealism.\n\nThe literature on the knowability paradox emerges in response to a\nproof first published by Frederic Fitch in his 1963 paper, “A\nLogical Analysis of Some Value Concepts.” Theorem 5, as it was\nthere called, threatens to collapse a number of modal and epistemic\ndifferences. Let ignorance be the failure to know some truth. Then\nTheorem 5 collapses a commitment to contingent ignorance into a\ncommitment to necessary ignorance. For it shows that the existence of\ntruths in fact unknown entails the existence of truths necessarily\nunknown. Formally,  \nThe converse of Theorem 5 is trivial (since truth entails\npossibility), so Fitch goes most of the way toward erasing any logical\ndifference between the existence of contingent ignorance and the\nexistence of necessary unknowability.  \nIt is however the contrapositive of Theorem 5 that is usually referred\nto as the paradox:  \nIt tells us that if any truth can be known then it follows that every\ntruth is in fact known.  \nThe earliest version of the proof was conveyed to Fitch by an\nanonymous referee in 1945. In 2005 we discovered that Alonzo Church\nwas that referee (Salerno 2009b). His reports are published in their\nentirety in Church (2009). Fitch apparently did not take the result to\nbe paradoxical. He published the proof in 1963 to avert a kind of\n“conditional fallacy” that threatened his informed-desire\nanalysis of value. The analysis roughly says: \\(x\\) is valuable\nto \\(s\\) just in case there is a truth \\(p\\) such that were\n\\(s\\) to known \\(p\\) then she would desire \\(x\\). The\nexistence of unknowable truths ultimately explains why he restricts\nthe propositional variables to knowable propositions. For an\nunknowable truth provides for an impossible antecedent in Fitch’s\ncounterfactual, and ultimately trivializes the analysis. Since Fitch’s\ntheory of value is not the context in which the paradox is widely\ndiscussed, we will say no more about it here.  \nRediscovered in Hart and McGinn (1976) and Hart (1979), the result was\ntaken to be a refutation of verificationism, the view that all\nmeaningful statements (and so all truths) are verifiable. After all,\nif one accepts the knowability principle,\n\\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp)\\), she is\ncommitted to the absurd claim that all truths are known. Mackie (1980)\nand Routley (1981), among others at the time, point to difficulties\nwith this general position but ultimately agree that Fitch’s result is\na refutation of the claim that all truths are knowable, and that\nvarious forms of verificationism are imperiled for related reasons.\nSince the early eighties, however, there has been considerable effort\nto analyze the proof as paradoxical. Why after all should it be that\nan epistemic theory of truth collapses possible knowledge into actual\nknowledge? Intuitively, that truth is to be understood in terms of the\nepistemic capacities of non-omniscient agents is at least a coherent\nposition—a position distinct from and more plausible than the\nthesis that all truths are known. Moreover, it has been thought\nstrange that sophisticated versions of the epistemic theory of truth\nshould fall prey to such swift deduction. Hence, the Church-Fitch\nproof has come to be known as the paradox of knowability.\n \nThere is no consensus about whether and where the proof goes wrong. We\nuse this entry to lay out the proof and explore a range of proposed\ntreatments. \nFitch’s reasoning involves quantifying into sentence position. Our\npropositional variables \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) will take\ndeclarative statements as substituends. Let \\(K\\) be the\nepistemic operator ‘it is known by someone at some time\nthat.’ Let \\(\\Diamond\\) be the modal operator ‘it is possible\nthat’. \nSuppose the knowability principle (KP)—that all truths are\nknowable by somebody at some time: \nAnd suppose that collectively we are non-omniscient, that there is an\nunknown truth: \nIf this existential claim is true, then so is an instance of it:  \nNow consider the instance of KP substituting line 1 for the variable\n\\(p\\) in KP:  \nIt follows trivially that it is possible to know the conjunction\nexpressed at line 1: \nHowever, it can be shown independently that it is impossible to know\nthis conjunction. Line 3 is false.  \nThe independent result presupposes two very modest epistemic\nprinciples: first, knowing a conjunction entails knowing each of the\nconjuncts. Second, knowledge entails truth. Respectively, \nAlso presupposed are two modest modal principles: first, all theorems\nare necessary. Second, necessarily \\(\\neg p\\) entails that\n\\(p\\) is impossible. Respectively, \nConsider the independent result: \nLine 9 contradicts line 3. So a contradiction follows from KP and\nNonO. The advocate of the view that all truths are knowable must deny\nthat we are non-omniscient:  \nAnd it follows from that that all truths are actually known:  \nThe ally of the view that all truths are knowable (by somebody at some\ntime) is forced absurdly to admit that every truth is known (by\nsomebody at some time).  \nIn this section we inspect the prospects for treating Fitch’s\nreasoning as invalid. Is Fitch’s epistemic reasoning in order? Is the\nlogic of knowability classical logic? More to the point: does the\nknowability principle carry with it special considerations that\nwarrant the revision of classical logic? If so, does this logical\nrevision invalidate Fitch’s reasoning? And if the reasoning is invalid, are\nthere closely related paradoxes that threaten the knowability\nprinciple without violating the relevant logical standards?  \nThe problem with Fitch’s reasoning is not with either of the epistemic\ninferences A or B. Though some have argued that knowing a conjunction\ndoes not entail knowing the conjuncts (Nozick 1981), Williamson (1993)\nand Jago (2010) have shown that versions of the paradox do not require\nthis distributive assumption. And questions about the factivity of\n\\(K\\) may be defused rather quickly, since related paradoxes\nemerge replacing the factive operator “It is known that”\nwith a non-factive operators, such as ‘It is rationally believed\nthat’ (Mackie 1980: 92; Edgington 1985: 558–559; Tennant\n1997: 252–259; Wright 2000: 357).  \nDeep and interesting discussions of the epistemic operators and/or\ntemporal analogs in the context of Fitch’s paradox appear in many\npapers. Burgess (2009) considers the temporal analogs. van Benthem\n(2004; 2009), van Ditmarsh, et al. (2012), Berto et al. (forthcoming)\nand Holliday (2018) explore the problem in dynamic epistemic\nframeworks. Palczewski (2007), Kelp and Pritchard (2009), Chase et al.\n(2018), and Heylen (forthcoming) consider non-factive notions of\nknowledge and knowability. Linsky (2009), Paseau (2008), Jago (2010),\nCarrara et al. (2011), and Rosenblatt (2014) debate the prospects for\ntyping knowledge.  \nWilliamson (1982) argues that Fitch’s proof is not a refutation of\nanti-realism, but rather a reason for the anti-realist to accept\nintuitionistic logic. Owing to a verificationist (or constructivist)\nreading of negation and existential quantification, intuitionistic\nlogic validates neither the elimination of double negation,  \nnor the following quantifier exchange rule:  \nWithout double negation elimination one cannot derive Fitch’s\nconclusion ‘all truths are known’ (at line 11) from\n‘there is not a truth that is unknown’ (line 10). Consider\nline 10,  \nFrom this we may intuitionistically derive  \nBut notice without double negation elimination,  \ndoes not entail  \nSuppose \nand suppose \\(p\\) for conditional introduction. And suppose\n\\(\\neg Kp\\) for reductio. We may conjoin \\(p\\) with\n\\(\\neg Kp\\) to get \nThis contradicts our primary assumption. So, by reductio,\n\\(\\neg \\neg Kp\\). Without double negation elimination, we cannot\nconclude \\(Kp\\), and so, may not introduce the conditional \nThe intuitionist is however committed, by conditional introduction, to\n \nThere is some debate about whether this consequence is sufficiently\ntroublesome, but the intuitionistic anti-realist takes solace in the\nfact that she is not committed to the blatantly absurd claim that all\ntruths are known. Very interesting discussion concerning the hopes and\ndreams of intuitionistic antrealism in this context appears in Murzi\n(2010; 2012), Murzi et al. (2009) and Zardini(2015). \nSince Fitch’s reasoning is intuitionistically valid through line 10, the\nintuitionist anti-realist must accept that no truths are unknown:\n\\(\\neg \\exists p(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). Arguably\nthis is harmful enough, for it appears that the anti-realist cannot\ngive credence to the truism that (individually and collectively) we\nare non-omniscient. Williamson responds that the intuitionist\nanti-realist may naturally express our non-omniscience as “not\nall truths are known”:  \nThis claim is classically, but not intuitionistically, equivalent to\nthe non-omniscience thesis,  \nThat is because in intuitionistic logic the quantifier exchange rule,\n\\(\\neg \\forall x\\P[x] \\vdash \\exists x \\neg\\P[x],\\) is not\nunrestrictedly valid. Importantly the expression of non-omniscience at\nline \\(12, \\neg \\forall p(p \\rightarrow Kp)\\), is only classically,\nand not intuitionistically, inconsistent with line \\(10, \\neg \\exists\np(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). So the intuitionist anti-realist can\nconsistently give expression to the truism that we are non-omniscient\n(with line 12) while accepting the intuitionistic consequence derived\nat line 10. In effect, the anti-realist admits both that no truths are\nunknown and that not all truths are known. The satisfiability of this\nclaim on intuitionistic grounds is demonstrated by Williamson (1988,\n1992).  \nA deeper problem is said to remain for the intuitionist anti-realist.\nFitch’s paradox rests on the assumption that there are unknown truths.\nBut consider the intuitionistically weaker assumption that there are\nundecided statements, that is, some \\(p\\), such that \\(p\\)\nis unknown and \\(\\neg p\\) is unknown. Formally,  \nIf (Und) is true, then so is an instance of it:  \nAnd notice that the intuitionistically acceptable conclusion at line\n\\(10, \\neg \\exists p(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\), is\nintuitionistically equivalent to the universal claim,  \nDeriving \\(\\neg Kp \\rightarrow \\neg p\\) and \\(\\neg K\\neg p \\rightarrow\n\\neg \\neg p\\) from (ii), and applying the conjuncts of (i),\nrespectively, gives us the contradiction \\(\\neg p \\wedge \\neg \\neg\np\\). The intuitionist anti-realist is forced to admit absurdly that\nthere are no undecided statements:  \nThe above argument is given by Percival (1990: 185). Since it is\nintutionistically acceptable, it is meant to show that the\nintuitionist anti-realist is still in trouble.  \nIn reply, the anti-realist again may utilize Williamson’s strategy\njointly to revise logic and reconstruct an expression of the epistemic\ntruism. Embrace only the intuitionistic consequences of KP (in this\ncase, that there are no undecided statements), and give expression to\nthe truism about undecidedness by claiming that not all statements are\ndecided: \nThe reinterpretation of the undecidedness intuition at line (iv) gives\nus a claim that is classically, but not intuitionistically, equivalent\nto Und. And so, it is only classically, and not intuitionistically,\ninconsistent with the inference at line (iii). \nRelated undecidedness paradoxes of knowability are discussed in Wright\n(1987: 311), Williamson (1988: 426) and Brogaard and Salerno (2002:\n146–148). The undecidedness paradoxes give the anti-realist even\nfurther reason to revise classical logic in favor of intuitionistic\nlogic. When accompanied by a reconstrual of our epistemically modest\nintuitions, logical space for anti-realism is reclaimed. \nWhat all this suggests is that intuitionist anti-realism is coherent.\nBut is the approach well motivated? Is either the revision of\nclassical logic or the clever reconstrual of our epistemic intuitions\nad hoc? \nThe anti-realist’s purported right to give up classical logic in favor\nof intuitionistic logic has been defended independently. The argument\nfinds its roots in Dummett (1976, and elsewhere). More recent\ninterpretations of the anti-realist’s argument for logical revision\nappear in Wright (1992: Chp. 2), Tennant (1997: Chp. 7), and Salerno\n(2000). The details and success or failure of the arguments for\nlogical revision is a topic for another time. For now it is enough to\npoint out that the threat of Fitch’s paradox is not the anti-realist’s\nsole motivation for favoring a non-classical logic. \nWhat about the reconstrual of our epistemic intuitions? Is it well\nmotivated? According to Kvanvig (1995) it is not. Why should we grant\nthat the intuitionistic treatments of non-omniscience and\nundecidedness are better than our initial common-sense treatments? And\nhow is the anti-realist to explain away the apparent triviality of\nthese common-sense treatments? These questions have not been\nanswered. \nMoreover, some of the intuitionistic consequences of KP are thought to\nbe bad enough. Even if ‘there are no unknown truths’ or\n‘there are no undecided statements’ are intuitionistically\ntolerable, the following appears not to be: If \\(p\\) is unknown then\n\\(\\neg p\\). Formally, \\(\\neg Kp \\rightarrow \\neg p\\). This claim\nfollows intuitionistically from \\(p \\rightarrow \\neg \\neg Kp\\), which\nwe have already established as an intuitionistic consequence of\nKP. But \\(\\neg Kp \\rightarrow \\neg p\\) appears to be false for\nempirical discourse. Why should the fact that nobody ever knows \\(p\\)\nbe sufficient for the falsity of \\(p\\)? See Percival (1990) and\nWilliamson (1988) for further discussions of this and related problems\nsurrounding the application of intuitionist anti-realism to empirical\ndiscourse.  DeVidi and Solomon (2001) disagree. They argue that the\nintuitionistic consequences are not unacceptable to one interested in\nan epistemic theory of truth—indeed they are central to an\nepistemic theory of truth. \nFor these reasons an appeal to intuitionist logic, by itself, is\ngenerally taken to be unsatisfying in dealing with the paradoxes of\nknowability. Exceptions include Burmüdez (2009), Dummett (2009),\nRasmussen (2009) and Maffezioli, Naibo & Negri (2013). \nAnother challenge to the logic of Fitch’s paradox is mentioned in\nRoutley (1981) and defended by Beall (2000). The thought is that the\ncorrect logic of knowability is paraconsistent. In a paraconsistent\nlogic contradictions do not trivialize a theory, because they do not\n‘explode’. That is, in a paraconsistent logic the\ninference from \\(p \\wedge \\neg p\\) to an arbitrary\nconclusion \\(r\\) is not valid. Owing to this consideration some\ncontradictions are permitted and thought to be possible.  \nBeall contends that (1) Fitch’s proof turns on the assumption that,\nfor all statements \\(p\\), the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is impossible and (2) we have independent evidence\nfor thinking \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for some \\(p\\).\nThe independent evidence lies in the\n paradox of the knower\n (not to be\nmistaken with the paradox of knowability). The relevant version of the\nknower paradox may be demonstrated by considering the following\nself-referential sentence: \nAssume for the sake of argument that \\(k\\) is known. Then,\npresuming that knowledge entails truth, \\(k\\) is true. But\n\\(k\\) says that \\(k\\) is unknown. So \\(k\\) is unknown.\nConsequently, \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. But then our\nassumption (i.e., that \\(k\\) is known) is false, and provably so.\nAnd, granting that a proven falsehood is known to be false, it follows\nthat it is known that \\(k\\) is unknown. That is to say, it is\nknown that \\(k\\). But we have already shown that if it is known\nthat \\(k\\) then \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. So it is\nproven that \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. It is provably the\ncase that the full description of our knowledge includes both\n\\(K(k)\\) and \\(\\neg K(k)\\). That is the\nknower paradox. \nBeall suggests that the knower gives us some independent evidence for\nthinking \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for some \\(p\\), that\nthe full description of human knowledge has the interesting feature of\nbeing inconsistent. With a paraconsistent logic, one may accept this\nwithout triviality. And so it is suggested that one go paraconsistent\nand embrace \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) as a true consequence\nof the knowability principle. Beall concludes that Fitch’s reasoning,\nwithout a proper reply to the knower, is ineffective against the\nknowability principle. For Fitch’s reasoning allegedly turns on the\nassumption that, for all \\(p\\), it is impossible that \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). \nNotice that our presentation of Fitch’s reasoning makes no explicit\nmention of the assumption that \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is\nimpossible. So here we attempt to pinpoint exactly where Fitch’s\nreasoning goes wrong on the above account. It is claimed at line 9 (in\nthe first section of this entry) that \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible. Of course \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) entails the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). And so, if the reasoning is that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible because\ncontradictions are impossible, then Beall would be directly attacking\nthe argument presented herein. But notice the argument here is subtly\ndifferent. It goes like this. \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) entails the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). So, by reductio, \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is false. By necessitation, it follows that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is necessarily false.\nDepending on the paraconsistent logic, the paraconsistist may object\nto use of reductio, or may object to other inferences. The claim that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible (at line\n9) is inferred from this claim that \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is necessarily false. This may trouble the\nparaconsistentist. By the lights of one living with contradiction, it\nmay not follow that an inconsistent statement is impossible even if it\nis necessarily false. After all, on this account a necessarilly false\nstatement may be both false and true at some world, in which case the\nstatement is both necessarily false and possible. If this is right\nthen the inference from \\(\\Box \\neg p\\) to \\(\\neg \\Diamond p\\)\nhas counterexamples and may not be employed to infer\n\\(\\neg \\Diamond K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) from\n\\(\\Box \\neg K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). \nBeall’s insights turn on a number of things: (1) the strength of the\nindependent evidence for true epistemic contradictions, (2) the\nadequacy of the proposed resolutions to the knower paradox, (3) the\nquestion of whether Fitch’s reasoning is ineffective without a\nresolution to the knower and (4) an interpretation for \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) that invalidates the relevant inference (from\n\\(\\Box \\neg p\\) to \\(\\neg \\Diamond p)\\) while remaining true\nto the role played by \\(\\Diamond\\) in the knowability principle. We leave\nthese problems for further debate. But compare with Wansing (2002),\nwhere a paraconsistent constructive relevant modal logic with strong\nnegation is proposed to block the paradox. \nMore recent developments of the paraconsistent approach appear in\nBeall (2009) and Priest (2009). \nThe remainder of proposals are restriction strategies. They\nreinterpret KP by restricting its universal quantifier. In effect, the\nrestriction strategies invalidate Fitch’s reasoning by prohibiting the\nsubstitution-instances of KP that lead to paradox. In this section we\nexamine semantic reasons for restricting the universal quantifer in\nKP. \nEdgington (1985) offers a situation-theoretic diagnosis of Fitch’s\nparadox. She claims that the problem lies with the failure to\ndistinguish between ‘knowing in a situation that\n\\(p\\)’ and ‘knowing that \\(p\\) is the case in a\nsituation’. In the latter case, the situation is (at least in\npart) that which the knowledge is about. In the former case, the\nsituation is that in which the knowledge is had. For instance, I may\nknow in my actual situation that I would be in pain in a\ncounterfactual situation where my tooth is pulled. Importantly, the\nsituation in which the knowledge takes place may be different from the\nsituation that my knowledge is about. In a situation in which my tooth\nis not pulled, I may know things that are about a situation\nin which my tooth is pulled.  \nWhat are situations? The above example seems to suggest that\nsituations are worlds. But situations may be less complete than\nworlds. That is, they need not have truth-values fixed for statements\nthat are irrelevant to the context. Consider an example by\nLinstöm: I may know in a given perceptual situation \\(s\\)\nthat John (one of the participants of a card game) has the best hand\nand that none of the participants knows this. In this case my\nknowledge is of one situation \\(s^*\\), the card game, but my\nknowledge is acquired in a different situation \\(s\\), my\nperceptual situation. Situation \\(s^*\\) is not only determined,\nbut its relevant information is limited, by the context of the card\ngame. And \\(s\\) is fixed and limited by the context of the\nperceptual situation. Edgington prefers talk of situations rather than\nworlds, because knowledge of non-actual situations, unlike knowledge\nof non-actual worlds, does not require knowledge of an infinite amount\nof detail. \nMaking explicit the situation-theoretic distinction between\n‘knowing in’ and ‘knowing about’, we may\nreinterpret the knowability principle: for each statement \\(p\\)\nand situation \\(s\\), if \\(p\\) is true in \\(s\\) then\nthere is a situation \\(s^*\\) in which it is known that \\(p\\)\nis true in \\(s\\). Edgington requires of knowability the less\ngeneral thesis: if \\(p\\) is true in an actual situation\n\\(s\\) then there is a possible situation \\(s^*\\) in which it\nis known that \\(p\\) is true in \\(s\\). Call this\nE-knowability or EKP: \nwhere A is the actuality operator which may be read ‘In some\nactual situation’, and \\(\\Diamond\\) is the possibility operator to be\nread ‘In some possible situation’. \nAs we see, EKP restricts the knowability principle to actual truths,\nby saying \\(p\\) is actually true only if there is a possible\nsituation in which it is known that \\(p\\) is actually true.  \nThe important suggestion is this. Just as there may be actual\nknowledge of what is counterfactually the case, there may be\ncounterfactual knowledge of what is actually the case. In fact, in\nlight of Fitch’s proof, E-knowability requires the existence of such\nnon-actual knowledge. Let us see why. \nActual truths of the form \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) will have\nto be E-knowable. But \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) cannot be\nactually known to be actually the case. The reasoning here is exactly\nanalogous to Fitch’s reasoning.  \nThe lesson is this. Since, for some \\(p, p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is actually the case, E-knowability commits us to\npossible knowledge that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is actually\nthe case. Since this knowledge cannot be actual, E-knowability\nrequires non-actual knowledge of what is actually the case.\nE-knowability then denies the following assumption: given a statement\n\\(p\\), if it is known that \\(p\\) in \\(s\\), then in\n\\(s\\) it is known that \\(p\\). By Edgington’s analysis it is\nexactly this implicit assumption that leads Fitch’s reasoning astray.\nThe paradox is blocked without it. \nSince the actuality operator rigidly designates actual\nsituations, the truth-value of statements of the form \\(\\A p\\) will\nnot vary across possible situations. ‘\\(\\A p\\)’ entails\n‘in every situation \\(\\A p\\)’. Thus, as Edgington is\naware, if \\(\\A p\\) then it is necessary that \\(\\A p\\). This by\nitself poses a problem for EKP. The criticism is that Edgington’s\napproach is not general enough. Anyone who is likely to endorse the\nknowability principle is likely to think that it holds of all truths,\nnot just those necessary truths involving the actuality operator. EKP\nappears to be a very limited thesis failing to specify an epistemic\nconstraint on contingent truth (Williamson 1987a). \nFurther criticisms emerge when we attempt to say something informative\nabout what constitutes non-actual knowledge of what is actually the\ncase. If there is such non-actual knowledge, there is non-actual\nthought about an actual situation. So the non-actual thinker somehow\nhas a concept of an actual situation. But how is it possible for a\nnon-actual thinker to have a concept that is specifically about\nsituations in this the actual world. It will not do for the thinker to\nexpress the thought ‘actually \\(p\\)’, since\n‘actually’ will designate rigidly only situations in her\nown world. Moreover, since there is no causal link between the actual\nworld \\(w_1\\) and the relevant non-actual world\n\\(w_2\\), it is unclear how non-actual thought in\n\\(w_2\\) can be uniquely about \\(w_1\\)\n(Williamson, 1987a: 257–258). Therefore, it is unclear how there\nmight be non-actual knowledge about what is actually the case. \nOf course actual knowledge about the non-actual is no better at\nsingling out worlds. The special problem for the non-actual knower is\nthat the content of her thought must be precisely the content that we\ngrasp when we consider the truth of \\(\\A p\\). Being in the actual\nworld we are able to single out this world uniquely. When we consider\nthe truth of \\(\\A p\\) our context fixes the content of A\nspecifically. So if it really is \\(\\A p\\) that is knowable by a\nnon-actual knower, then it must be \\(\\A p\\) that she\ngrasps—that is, it must be the very same concept that we grasp.\nBut how this is possible is precisely the problem. \nRelated and additional criticisms of Edgington’s proposal appear in\nWright (1987), Williamson (1987b; 2000b) and Percival (1991). Formal\ndevelopments on the proposal, including points that address some of\nthese concerns appear in Rabinowicz and Segerberg (1994),\nLindström (1997), Rückert (2003), Edgington (2010), Fara\n(2010), Proietti and Sandu (2010), and Schlöder (forthcoming). \nKvanvig (1995) accuses Fitch of a modal fallacy. The fallacy is an\nillicit substitution into a modal context. Consider a familiar modal\nfallacy. For all persons \\(x\\), there is a possible world in\nwhich \\(x\\) is not the inventor of bifocals. (Even Ben Franklin,\nthe actual inventor of bifocals, might not have invented them.)\nTherefore, there is a possible world in which the inventor of bifocals\nis not the inventor of bifocals. We can represent the argument\nformally. Let our quantifiers range over persons, and let\n‘\\(i\\)’ be the non-rigid designator ‘the\ninventor of bifocals’. Consider the argument:  \nAlthough anyone might not have been the inventor of bifocals, it does\nnot follow (in fact it is false) that it is possible that the inventor\nof bifocals is not identical to the inventor of bifocals. After all,\nit is necessary that the inventor of bifocals is the inventor of\nbifocals.  \nThe lesson is that we may not substitute unrestrictedly into modal\ncontexts. Substitution into modal contexts, we might say, is permitted\nonly if the substituting terms are rigid designators. In the case of\nFitch’s result, our terms are sentences. The knowability principle,\n\\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp)\\), apparently\nallows us to substitute any sentence whatsoever for \\(p\\). But\nnotice that our quantifier has wide scope relative to \\(\\Diamond\\). We would\nexpect that the lessons of quantified modal logic carry over to\nquantified propositional modal logic. If so, then we may not\nsubstitute for \\(p\\) any statement that does not designate\nrigidly. \nOn Kvanvig’s diagnosis, the problem with Fitch’s reasoning is that\nwhen he substituted the conjunction \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\)\nfor \\(p\\) in KP (at line 2 of the result), he did not stop to\ndetermine whether \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is rigid. Kvanvig\nmaintains that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is not rigid. So\nFitch’s result is fallacious owing to an illicit substitution into a\nmodal context. But we may reconstrue \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\)\nas rigid. And when we do, the paradox evaporates. \nKvanvig proposes that quantified expressions are non-rigid. The reason\nhe gives is that quantifiers designate different objects in different\npossible worlds. “Everyone in Jon’s Logic class must take the\nfinal” is about different students in different possible worlds.\nWere Sussie to have taken the class, the expression would have been\nabout her. But she decided not to take the class, so actually it is\nnot about her. \\(Kp\\) is an abbreviation for ‘it is known\nby somebody at some time that \\(p\\).’ So, \\(Kp\\) is\nimplicitly quantified. Explicitly it reads\n\\(\\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) which says there is\na being \\(x\\) and a time \\(t\\) such that \\(x\\) knows\nthat \\(p\\) at \\(t\\). Accordingly, on this account, the\nquantified expression that \\(Kp\\) abbreviates is non-rigid.\n\\(\\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) is about different\nbeings and times in different modal contexts. For instance, the\nexpression \\(\\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) is about\nactual beings and times. But embedded in a modal context, e.g.,\n\\(\\Diamond \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) the expression\nis about possible beings and times. It says, ‘there is a\npossible world in which there is a being \\(x\\) and time\n\\(t\\) such that \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\) at\n\\(t\\).’ \nNow consider the relevant instance of Fitch’s non-omniscience thesis:\n\\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). Unabbreviated it reads, \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) which\nsays \\(p\\) is true but nobody ever knows that \\(p\\). The\nquantified expression is, on this view, a non-rigid designator.\nUttered in the actual world, it is about actual beings and times. But,\nit is argued, embedded within the scope of a possibility operator the\ndesignation varies to be about possible beings and times. When Fitch\nsubstituted the true conjunction, \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt),\\) for \\(p\\)\nin the knowability principle, he substituted for \\(p\\) a\nnon-rigid designator, thereby altering the reference of the\nconjunction and perpetrating a modal fallacy. \nAlternatively, Kvanvig suggests, we may characterize \\(Kp\\)\nrigidly to say, ‘there is an actual being \\(x\\) and actual\ntime \\(t\\) such that it is known by \\(x\\) at \\(t\\) that\n\\(p\\).’ Since this expression designates rigidly (i.e., it\nmakes reference to the actual world regardless of the modal context in\nwhich it appears), it may be substituted for \\(p\\) in the\nknowability principle. The reinterpreted conjunction does not change\nits designation when embedded within the scope of \\(\\Diamond\\). Moreover, on\nthis reading of the conjunction, the paradox dissolves. It is possible\nto know that the reinterpreted conjunction is true. There is no\ncontradiction in supposing that some possible being at some possible\ntime knows that \\(p\\) is true but never known by an actual being\nat an actual time. The paradox dissolves. \nFurther discussion of modal fallacies and non-rigid statements appears\nin Brogaard and Salerno (2008) and Kennedy (2014). \nWilliamson (2000b) defends Fitch’s reasoning against Kvanvig’s charge.\nHe suggests that Kvanvig has no grounds for thinking that Fitch’s\nconjunction \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) does not\ndesignate rigidly. The reason Williamson gives is this. An expression\nis non-rigid if, when uttered in a fixed context, it varies its\nreference with the circumstances under which it is evaluated. But\nKvanvig gives no convincing reason for thinking that Fitch’s\nconjunction, as uttered in a fixed context, varies its reference in\nthis way. At best Kvanvig has shown that the conjunction varies its\nreference when uttered in varying contexts, since his\nargument is that a quantified sentence, when uttered at different\nworlds, will be about different objects. To think that this is\nsufficient for non-rigidity, Williamson complains, is to confuse\nnon-rigidity for indexicality. Importantly, indexicality does not\nimply non-rigidity. For instance, ‘I am tired’ is about\nme, and continues to be about me when I evaluate its truth-value in\ncounterfactual circumstances. The sentence might have been false. Had\nI gotten enough sleep, I would not be tired. Uttered in a fixed\ncontext, ‘I’ rigidly designates, even though it is an\nindexical. That is, even though, had it been uttered in a different\ncontext by somebody else, it would have been about somebody other than\nme. Analogously, even if quantified expressions are indexicals, it\ndoes not follow that they are non-rigid. And so, even if Fitch’s\nconjunction is an indexical expression, we have not been given a\nreason to think that it is non-rigid. If this is correct, then we have\nno grounds for thinking that Fitch has committed the modal fallacy in\nquestion. \nKvanvig (2006) replies and develops other interesting themes in the\nKnowability Paradox, which is the only monograph to date\ndedicated to the topic. \nThe foregoing restriction strategies involved semantic reasons for\nlimiting universal quantification. In those cases, KP was restricted\nin light of considerations about situations, possible worlds, or rigid\ndesignation. Another kind of restriction strategy is syntactic. It\nlimits the scope of universal quantification to those formulas that\nhave a certain logical form or stand in a certain provability\nrelation. Most generally,  \n\\(F\\) should then be a logical property that restricts the\nquantifier in some principled way.  \nTennant (1997) focuses on the property of being Cartesian: A statement\n\\(p\\) is Cartesian if and only if \\(Kp\\) is not provably\ninconsistent. Accordingly, he restricts the principle of knowability\nto Cartesian statements. Call this restricted knowability principle\nT-knowability or TKP:  \nNotice that T-knowability is free of the paradoxes that we have\ndiscussed. It is free of Fitch’s paradox and the related\n undecidedness paradox.\n For both results substitute the problematic Fitch conjunction,\n\\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for the variable in \\(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp\\), giving us \\((p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\n\\rightarrow \\Diamond K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\). That is,\nthey require that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) be knowable if\ntrue (line 2 of Fitch’s result). But \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\)\nis not Cartesian, since \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\)\nis provably inconsistent (entailing the contradiction at line 6 of\nFitch’s result). In effect, TKP offers the most tolerant restriction\nneeded to prohibit the bothersome substitution. For it only prohibits\nsubstituting those statements for which it is logically impossible to\nknow.  \nDummett (2001) agrees that the knowability theorist’s error lies in\nproviding a blanket, rather than a restricted, knowability principle.\nAnd he agrees that the restriction should be syntactic. Dummett\nrestricts the principle of knowability to “basic”\nstatements and characterizes truth inductively from there. For\nDummett, \nwhere the logical constant on the right-hand side of each\nbiconditional clause is understood as subject to the laws of\nintuitionistic logic. \nDummett’s knowability principle or DKP, like Tennant’s, is not\nthreatened by the knowability paradoxes, and for the same reason. It\nrestricts the class of statements that are subject to knowability. For\nDummett’s case, the problematic Fitch conjunction, \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), being compound, and so not basic, cannot replace the\nvariable in \\(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp\\). The paradox is\nconsequently averted. \nThe relative merits of these two restrictions are weighed by Tennant\n(2002). Tennant’s restriction is the less demanding of the two, since\nit bars only the substitution of those statements that are logically\nunknowable, and so, only those statements that are responsible for the\nparadoxes. Dummett’s restriction, by comparison, bars not only the\nsubstitution of these propositions, but also the substitution of\nlogically complex proposition that are clearly knowable. Tennant also\npoints out, if the knowability principle is the primary anti-realist\nmotivation for revising classical logic, restricting that principle to basic\nstatements can undermine arguments against a classical treatment of\ncomplex statements.  \nThe main objections to the restriction strategies fall into two camps.\nIn the first camp we find the charge that a given syntactic\nrestriction on the knowability principle is not principled. From the\nsecond camp arise formulations of Fitch-like paradoxes that are not\naverted by the syntactic restrictions on knowable truth. \nFrom the first camp Hand and Kvanvig (1999) protest that TKP has not\nbeen restricted in a principled manner—in effect, that we have\nbeen given no good reason, other than the threat of paradox, to\nrestrict the principle to Cartesian statements. (An analogous claim\nmay be made of Dummett’s DKP.) Tennant (2001b) replies to Hand and\nKvanvig with general discussion about the admissibility of\nrestrictions in the practice of conceptual analysis and philosophical\nclarification. By drawing analogies between his own restriction and\nothers that are clearly admissible, he maintains that the Cartesian\nrestriction is not ad-hoc. He also points out that TKP,\nrather than the unrestricted KP, serves as the more interesting point\nof contention between the semantic realist and anti-realist. The\nrealist believes that it is possible for truth to be unknowable in\nprinciple. Fitch’s reasoning, at best, shows us that there is\nstructural unknowability, that is, unknowability that is a function of\nlogical considerations alone. But is there a more substantial kind of\nunknowability, for instance, unknowability that is a function of the\nrecognition-transcendence of the non-logical subject-matter? A realist\ndecrying the ad hoc nature of TKP (or DKP) fails to engage\nthe knowability theorist at the heart of the realism debate. \nOther complaints that Tennant’s restriction strategy is not principled\nappear in DeVidi and Kenyon (2003) and Hand (2003). Hand offers a way\nof restricting knowability in a principled manner. \nThese concerns may be waived upon noticing versions of the paradox\nthat do not violate the proposed restrictions on the knowability\nprinciple. Williamson (2000a) asks us to consider the following\nparadox. Let \\(p\\) be the decidable sentence ‘There is a\nfragment of Roman pottery at that spot.’ Let \\(n\\) rigidly\ndesignate the number of books actually now on my desk. Let \\(E\\)\nbe the predicate ‘is even.’ Williamson constructs the\nconjunction, \nand contends that it is Cartesian. Knowing it, apparently, does not\nentail a contradiction. If he is right, we can apply to it TKP, giving\n \nAdditionally, if \\(p\\) is true and \\(Kp\\) is false, then\nWilliamson’s conjunction is true. So,  \nLines (1) and (2) yield  \nAccepting the modest epistemic resources found in Fitch’s reasoning,\none can prove the following theorem:  \nHere is why. A conjunction is known only if its conjuncts are known.\nSo, if \\(K(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En))\\), then \\(Kp\\). And only\ntruths can be known. So, if \\(K(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En))\\), then\n\\(Kp \\rightarrow En\\). Of course, \\(Kp\\) and \\(Kp \\rightarrow En\\)\njointly entail \\(En\\). So theorem 4 is valid, if Fitch’s\nepistemic resources are. Now, 4 is a theorem, and so, holds in all\npossible worlds. So its consequent is possible if its antecedent is\npossible: \nFrom lines 3 and 5 we derive  \nSince \\(n\\) designates rigidly, it is not contingent whether\n\\(n\\) is even. It follows then that line 6 yields  \nAn analogous argument replacing ‘odd’ for\n‘even’ gives us  \nBut then we have a contradiction resting on TKP and Fitch’s\nconjunction, \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). The result involves substitutions\nof \\(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En)\\) and \\(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow \\neg\nEn)\\) for \\(p\\) in TKP, but Williamson maintains that neither violate\nthe Cartesian restriction. Paradox regained. \nTennant (2001a) takes issue with Williamson’s claim that \\(p\n\\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En)\\) is Cartesian. In the case where \\(n\\) is\nodd, \\(En\\) expresses a necessary falsehood (for instance, ‘13\nis even’). But then, line 4 tells us that \\(K(p \\wedge(Kp\n\\rightarrow En))\\) implies something that is necessarily false. And if\nthe falsity of ‘13 is even’ is a matter\nof logical necessity, then \\(p \\wedge(Kp \\rightarrow En)\\)\ncannot be consistently known and therefore is not Cartesian. Hence,\nwhen \\(n\\) is odd, the first part of Williamson’s proof\n(involving the predicate ‘is even’) does in fact violate\nthe Cartesian restriction. By contrast, Williamson’s conjunction\nis Cartesian when \\(En\\) is true. But, analogously, if the truth of\n\\(En\\) is a matter of logical necessity, then \\(p \\wedge(Kp\n\\rightarrow \\neg En)\\) cannot be consistently known and is therefore\nnot Cartesian. Hence, when \\(n\\) is even, the second part of\nWilliamson’s proof (involving the predicate ‘is\nodd’) violates the Cartesian restriction. Either way, Tennant\nargues, Williamson has not shown that TKP is an inadequate treatment\nof Fitch’s paradox. \nThe debate continues in Williamson (2009) and Tennant (2010). \nBrogaard and Salerno (2002) develop other Fitch-like paradoxes against\nthe restriction strategies. Note that Dummett’s knowability principle\nis a biconditional: \\(p \\leftrightarrow \\Diamond Kp\\), where\n\\(p\\) is basic. Tennant (2002) agrees that the knowability\nprinciple should preserve the factive nature of \\(\\Diamond\\)K. So Brogaard\nand Salerno begin with the following strengthened knowability\nprinciple: \nMoreover, pending further discussion of the logic of \\(K\\), it is\nnot implausible that the intuitionist knowability theorist wishes to\nvalidate the KK-principle:  \nThe principle says, necessarily, if \\(p\\) is known then it is\nknown that \\(p\\) is known. One other resource is used, namely,\nthe closure principle which says that the antecedent of a necessary\nconditional is possible only if the consequent is possible. \nIf these commitments are granted, one can derive Fitch’s result\nwithout violating Tennant’s Cartesian restriction: \nSKP is applied at lines 3 and 6 to \\(p\\) and \\(Kp\\),\nrespectively. And these substituends do not violate the Cartesian\nrestriction. Neither \\(Kp\\), nor \\(KKp\\), is\nself-contradictory. Nonetheless, the anti-realist is forced absurdly\nto admit that no truth is unknown.  \nArguably, this result threatens Dummett’s restricted knowability\nprinciple as well. But that depends on whether we have applied the\nprinciple to basic statements only. \\(p\\) is basic, but Dummett’s\ncharacterization of truth underdetermines the status of \\(Kp\\).\nPerhaps it is basic, since \\(Kp\\) is not truth-functionally\ncomplex. Nonetheless, the issue cannot be resolved without a\ndiscussion of \\(K\\). \nBrogaard and Salerno demonstrate other paradoxes against the\nrestriction strategies. Those further results do not presuppose a\ncommitment to the KK-principle. They hinge ultimately on the\nknowability theorist’s interpretation of \\(\\Diamond\\). When \\(\\Diamond\\) is\nmetaphysical possibility or governed by a logic at least as strong as\nS4, the strong knowability principle (appropriately restricted), and\ntaken as a necessary thesis, entails that there are no unknown truths.\nWhen \\(\\Diamond\\) is epistemic possibility, and the knowability principle is\ntreated as a necessary thesis that is known, the knowability principle\nentails that, necessarily, there are no undecided statements. Unlike\nthe undecidedness paradoxes of Wright (1987), Williamson (1988), and\nPercival (1990), the reasoning provided by Brogaard and Salerno does\nnot violate Tennant’s Cartesian restriction. A response to Brogaard\nand Salerno appears in Rosenkranz (2004). Further discussion of the\nCartesian restriction appears in Brogaard and Salerno (2006, 2008).\nTennant (2009) is a further development and defense of the Cartesian\nstrategy. A defense of the restriction strategy appears in Fischer\n(2013). \nMuch of what has been written on the knowability paradox comes in the\nform of attempts to express the relevant form of anti-realism without\nparadox. Proposals include Chalmers (2012), Dummett (2009), Edgington\n(2010), Fara (2010), Hand (2009, 2010), Jenkins (2005), Kelp and\nPritchard (2009), Linsky (2009), Hudson (2009), Restall (2009),\nTennant (2009), Alexander (2013), Dean & Kurokawa (2010), Proietti\n(2016).  \nChalmers (2002, 2012: chap. 2), for instance, defends the idea that\ngiven enough qualitative information about the world we could in\nprinciple know the truth value of any claim. More specifically, his\nscrutability thesis says, if \\(D\\) is a complete qualitative\ndescription of the world, then for all \\(T\\), it is knowable a priori that\n\\(D\\) (materially) implies \\(T\\). Importantly, the knowability paradox does\nnot threaten the claim that true Fitch-conjunctions are derivable a\npriori from a complete description of the world.  \nDummett takes \\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\neg \\neg Kp)\\) to be the best expression of his brand of\nanti-realism and embraces its intuitionistic consequences with open\narms. Edgington defends her knowability principle (viz., if actually \\(p\\)\nthen it is possible to know that actually \\(p)\\) by making the case for\nsome transworld knowability—specifically, in those cases where\nthe merely possible knower shares the relevant causal history with the\nactual world. Hand defends anti-realism by pointing to the distinction\nbetween a verification-type and its token performances, and argues\nthat the existence of a verification-type doesn’t entail its\nperformability. The lesson there is that the anti-realist should think\nabout truth less in terms of the performability of verification\nprocedures and more in terms of the existence of verification-types.\nAnd Linsky regiments the epistemic principles and reasoning with a\ntheory of types. The debates surrounding the proper characterization\nof semantic anti-realism go far beyond the scope of this entry. As for\nthe knowability proof itself, there continues to be no consensus on\nwhether and where it goes wrong.  \nNiche discussions of the paradox that don’t fit well into any of the\nabove sections include Salerno’s (2018) new paradox of happiness;\nKvanvig’s (2010) argument that the paradox threatens Christianity\nitself owing to its doctrine of the incarnation of Christ; and\nCresto’s (2017) argument that the knowability paradox raises doubts\nabout Reflection Principle as a requirement on rationality.
