Although not\nas clear and systematic as Thomas Aquinas, and not as brilliantly\nanalytical as John Duns Scotus, Olivi’s ideas are equally\noriginal and provocative, and their philosophical value is nowadays\nrecognized among the specialists in medieval philosophy. He is\nprobably best known for his psychological theories, especially his\nvoluntarist conception of the freedom of the will, but his influence\nextends also to other areas of philosophy, from metaphysics to\npractical philosophy. \n\nOlivi (ca. 1248–1298) was born in Sérignan, in the\nLanguedoc region of southern France. He entered the Franciscan order\nat the age of twelve, studied in Paris from 1267 to about 1272 (during\nthe final years of Bonaventure’s generalate) without becoming a\nmaster of theology, and spent the remainder of his life teaching at\nvarious Franciscan houses of study in southern France, with a stay in\nFlorence from 1287–89. (For biographical details, see Burr 1976\nand 1989, and especially Piron 1998, 1999, 2006a.) Olivi’s\noutspoken originality led him into conflict with religious\nauthorities: his writings were condemned by the Franciscan authorities\nin 1283, and although he was later rehabilitated by the new minister\ngeneral Matthew of Aquasparta, he remained a controversial figure. He\nspent the rest of his life as a lector at Montpellier and Narbonne.\nSoon after his death the Franciscan order renewed the prohibition on\nreading or retaining his works. Although his philosophical views were\ncontroversial, what proved to be fatal was his reputation within the\nso-called “Spiritual” reform movement of the Franciscan\norder. Olivi’s understanding of the Franciscan vow and poverty\nbecame influential among the spiritualists, and after his death he was\nvenerated by fervent laymen in Languedoc. When Church officials took\naction against the spiritual movement, Olivi’s reputation\nsuffered a blow, which obviously limited the influence he would have\non posterity. (See Burr 1989, 1993, 2001.)  \nOlivi produced a large and wide-ranging body of work, much of which\nhas survived. By far the most important philosophical text is his\nSumma of questions on Peter Lombard’s\nSentences, a massive work he began writing soon after leaving\nParis and redacted to its final form in the mid-1290s. This\nmasterpiece of medieval philosophy remains still largely untranslated,\nand edited only in part. Olivi’s views on metaphysics and human\nnature are mostly found in his questions on Bk. II (ed. Jansen,\n1922–26). Material on the virtues is found in Bk. III (ed. Emmen\nand Stadter, 1981). Other philosophically relevant works include his\nQuodlibeta from 1289–95 (ed. Defraia, 2002), a set of\nquestions on logic (ed. Brown, 1986), and the Questions on\nEvangelical Perfection. Many of his biblical commentaries, the\nhistorically significant Commentary on the Apocalypse, and\nvarious texts pertaining to his condemnation have survived and are\navailable in modern editions. (For a recent list of editions, see\nKönig-Pralong et al. 2010.) In this article we will focus on just\na few of Olivi’s interesting philosophical views, concentrating\nespecially on his philosophical psychology.  \nOlivi devotes several extended questions of his Summa to the\ntopic of human freedom, beginning with the question of whether human\nbeings even have free will (liberum arbitrium). Olivi’s\nown argument for the affirmative begins by listing seven pairs of\nattitudes (affectus), each of which testifies to the\nexistence of free will (Q57, p. 317):  \nEach of these attitudes, Olivi claims, is intelligible only given the\nexistence of free will. More specifically, they are “its\ndistinctive products, or its distinctive acts and habits”\n(ibid.). As he runs through the list, explaining how each attitude\nentails free will, it becomes clear that many of these claims are\nfamiliar ones. Zeal, for instance, is an angry reaction to bad deeds,\nmotivated “only against the bad that one judges to have been\ndone voluntarily, and thus which could have been freely avoided”\n(p. 318). Without free will, this attitude is based on an assumption\nthat is “thoroughly false and grounded on a thoroughly false\nobject” (p. 317). As zeal goes, so do the related phenomena of\naccusations, excuses, blame, and guilt. Generally, “a human\nbeing could no more be accused of some vice than he could be accused\nof death, for he could avoid the one as little as the other” (p.\n336). Carefulness and heedlessness, the last pair on the list,\nlikewise become meaningless : “For it is foolish to be careful\nabout things that will occur necessarily” (p. 323). It becomes\npointless to be careful about deliberation, for instance,\n“because the deliberation itself will or will not happen\nnecessarily, and even one’s carefulness will or will not occur\nnecessarily” (p. 323).  \nFor Olivi, these and other data stand as unshakeable evidence for the\nexistence and nature of free will. He makes this clear from the\nbeginning of his reply, when he introduces two premisses that\n“no one of sane mind ought to doubt” (p. 317). First, it\nis impossible for all of the attitudes of one’s rational nature\nto be “thoroughly false and perverse and grounded on a\nthoroughly false and perverse object.” Since Olivi thinks that\nthe attitudes that distinguish us as rational creatures are founded on\nfree will, giving up on free will would be to abandon most of what\nmakes us human. We would cease to be what we properly are, persons,\nand we would become only “intellectual beasts” (p. 338).\nSecond, it is impossible for attitudes to be entirely illusory when\nhuman beings improve and perfect themselves by assuming those\nattitudes (p. 317). If the practices of zeal, deliberation,\nfriendship, love, political power, etc. were all founded on a false\nassumption, then surely these practices would not be so crucial to\nhuman well-being. Thus “no one of sane mind will believe that\nsomething could be the truth which so sharply puts an end to all good\nthings and brings on so many bad things” (p. 338). In the face\nof these implications, we should reject whatever stands in the way of\nfree will, whether that be the authority of Aristotle or some abstruse\nprinciple of metaphysics. “Even if there were no other argument\nestablishing that [the denial of free will] is false, this alone ought\nto be sufficiently persuasive” (p. 338). Moreover, as he\nexplicitly notes, we should be persuaded not just of our own free\nwill, but of the free will of all human beings, since these arguments\nare based not on private experience, but on our relationships with\nothers. \nHaving proved that human beings have free will, Olivi sets out to\nexplain what he means by freedom. His conception obviously belongs\nwithin the libertarian camp in the free will debate, and the central\naspect of it is that in order to be free, the will must be active and\ncapable of reflexively moving itself to action. True, the will’s\nchoices are not necessitated by reason or anything other than by the\nwill itself, but Olivi does not merely conclude that the will is not\nnecessitated; the further conclusion he reaches is that the will,\nuntil it makes a choice, is entirely undetermined one way or another,\nand that it determines itself in the direction it chooses. This is\nsomething “every human being senses with complete certainty\nwithin himself” (p. 327). In arguing that the will determines\nitself, he means that it is a first mover, in need of no efficient\ncause other than itself. “Its free power is the cause of its\nmotion, when it is moved, and the cause of its rest, when it\nrests” (ad 5, pp. 341–42). If the will did not have this\ncapacity for self-movement, then it would have to be determined by\nsomething else, and it would not be making its own choices. But this\nviolates the unshakeable assumptions from which Olivi begins, because\nit would then turn out that the will is not autonomous, not making its\nown choices, hence not a suitable object of one’s zeal or\nfriendship, among other things. \nOlivi is well aware that the lack of autonomy does not entirely\npreclude a sort of pseudo-zeal or pseudo-friendship. One might be\nangry with someone, for instance, not out of the conviction that the\nbad action was that person’s fault, but simply in an effort to\nchange that person’s ways. But this line of thought does\nviolence to our conceptions of ourselves and our fellow human beings.\nWe want people to do the right thing not because they have been\neffectively manipulated, but “solely and purely because of the\nlove of justice” (ad 22, p. 368). Further, when we urge a person\nto do the right thing, “we do not intend simply to move someone\ntoward what is good, but rather to make it that he voluntarily moves\nhimself toward the good” (p. 369). \nMoreover, Olivi argues fervently against the view that the will is a\npower for opposites only with respect to a future instant. In order to\nbe truly free, the will must, in the same instant as it wills\n‘A’, be capable of willing ‘not-A’.\nOlivi’s conception seems to have been the source of John Duns\nScotus’ revolutionary theory of synchronic contingency (Dumont\n1995), and although Scotus is better known as an early proponent of\nlibertarian freedom, his view is heavily indebted to Olivi. Indeed, it\nis arguable that Olivi deserves credit as the founder of this\nconception of freedom of the will. \nWith the rediscovery of Aristotle’s metaphysical and ethical\nworks, thirteenth-century theologians devoted an increasing portion of\ntheir time to interpreting and developing Aristotelian accounts of\nhuman nature. Olivi was very far from a slavish admirer of\nAristotle’s, and his theory of the nature of the soul and its\nrelation to the body differs radically from those medieval\ninterpretations which endeavor to be faithful to the Philosopher.\nNonetheless, he employs the Aristotelian theoretical framework, and\nalthough he often seems to be rather hostile to Aristotle’s\npervasive influence, once remarking that “without reason he is\nbelieved, as the god of this age” (Q58 ad 14, p. 482; see Burr\n1971), the main thrust of his criticism is directed at contemporary\nAverroist interpretations of Aristotle rather than at Aristotle\nhimself (Piron 2006b). The critical, even harsh passages must be\nunderstood in this light. \nNonetheless, he rejects many principles that are crucial for\nAristotle’s account of the soul-body relationship. He argues\nthat it is “not only contrary to reason but also dangerous to\nthe faith” to hold that “the [soul’s] intellective\nand free part is the form of the body per se and considered as\nsuch” (Q51, p. 104). Others had questioned the extent to which\nsoul and body could be analyzed in terms of form and matter, but Olivi\ngoes further because he explicitly denies that one part of the soul,\nthe rational part, can be understood as the form of the body. This\ndenial is ultimately based on his view that the intellectual part of\nthe soul must be spiritual and incorporeal because otherwise it cannot\nbe immortal, intellectual, and free. Yet he does not want to\njeopardize the substantial unity of the soul and the body, and he\nworks towards a theory which incorporates both of these doctrines. \nOlivi’s denial that the soul’s intellectual part is the\nform of the body matches fairly closely with a doctrine that was\ncondemned by the Council of Vienne in 1312, when Pope Clement V\ndeclared in the bull Fidei catholicae fundamento that it is a\nheresy to hold that “the rational or intellective soul is not\nper se and essentially the form of the human body” (Denzinger\n1965, n. 902). However, it is easy to misunderstand what Olivi is\nsaying, and a closer analysis shows that his position is far more\nnuanced than the wording of the condemnation suggests. First, he is\nnot denying that the rational part of the soul is a form, or even that\nit is the form of a human being. To begin with, he follows Bonaventure\nand makes a distinction between two kinds of matter. The human body\nand all material objects are made of corporeal matter, but spiritual\nentities (angels and human souls) also have a material substratum, the\nso-called spiritual matter. Olivi argues that the rational part of the\nsoul, intellect and will, is a form of this spiritual matter. It is\nacceptable to speak of intellect as the form of a human being\nsince the spiritual matter belongs to the human being. But because the\nspiritual matter of the soul is distinct from the corporeal matter of\nthe body, Olivi can maintain that the rational part is not the form of\nthe body. (See e.g. Q51 appendix, p. 138.) \nSecond, Olivi is not denying that the soul is the form of the\nbody. What he denies is that the rational part of the soul\n(“the intellective and free part”) is the form of the\nbody. He resorts to a doctrine of the plurality of substantial forms,\naccording to which complex substances, such as human beings, have\nseveral more or less distinct forms that together make the complete\nhuman being. The intellectual part of the soul is distinct from\nanother part, the sensory part, and only the latter is the form of the\nbody. Because the two parts of the soul are united in the spiritual\nmatter, it is acceptable to say that the whole soul is the form of the\nbody: \nWe should say that the whole soul is the form of the body, in much the\nsame way that we say that a person talks, not a tongue (p. 144). But\nif we direct our attention to the various parts of the soul, then it\nis wrong to say that the rational part, “per se and considered\nas such,” is the form of the body. The soul is the form of the\nbody only with respect to its sensory and nutritive part.  \nDespite his theoretical commitments that are not compatible with\nAristotle’s view, there is a sense in which Olivi might\nplausibly be said to be agreeing with Aristotle, who explicitly leaves\nroom for parts of the soul that “are the actuality of no\nbody” (De an. II.1, 413a7). Presumably, Aristotle is\nthinking of the intellect. But it’s not at all obvious how that\nremark should be interpreted. Aquinas, for instance, holds without\nqualification that “the intellect ... is the form of the human\nbody,” only its acts are not realized in the bodily organs\n(Summa theologiae 1.76.1). So what is it that compels Olivi\nto drop intellect from the hylomorphic scheme? \nOlivi writes that to identify the rational part as the form of the\nbody is “not only contrary to reason but also dangerous to the\nfaith” (as above). More specifically, as he writes in a letter\ndefending his views, he believes that that claim holds “the\ndanger of destroying the soul’s immortality, its liberty, and\nits intellectual nature” (Epistola n. 7). Each of these\nthree consequences is based on one overarching assumption: that to\nmake the soul’s rational part the form of the body is either to\nattribute to the body the distinctive capacities of the rational soul,\nor to deny these capacities to the intellectual soul. Here is how\nOlivi puts that claim: \nIf the intellect is the form of the body, then the body must have the\ncapacities for intellectual thought and free decision. Olivi is of\ncourse going to reject that as absurd. Notice the form of this\nargument. First, Olivi asserts that to be the form of something is to\nimpart actuality to that thing. This seems uncontroversial. Second,\nOlivi argues by analogy. Just as the sensory soul actualizes a body by\ngiving it life and the capacity for sensation, so the intellective\npart—if it is the form of the body—should actualize the\nbody by making it intellective and free. This claim seems plausible as\nwell. If one accepts the first step of the argument, that to be the\nform of something is to impart actuality to that thing, then the\nrational part must be giving something to the body. Olivi\nsays, “every form imparts to its matter some operation, and some\npower for operating” (Q51, p. 109). So, if the rational part\ndoes not render the body immortal and give it the capacity for\nintellective thought and freedom, we have to provide some sort of\naccount of what the rational part does give the body. But what else\ncould the rational part of the soul do for the body, if not endow it\nwith its essential properties and powers?  \nWe might view this argument as posing a dilemma. If the rational part\nis the form of the body, then one must either understand this formal\nrelationship in the ordinary way, in terms of actualizing the body, or\none must concede that the rational part is not the form of the body in\nany ordinary sense. The first horn of the dilemma leads in the\ndirection of materialism, because it forces one to claim that the\npowers of the rational soul are instantiated in the body. The second\nhorn of the dilemma leads one toward retracting the original\nassertion: that the rational part, the intellect, is the form of the\nbody. For it is not at all clear what that means, if the intellect is\nnot in any way actualizing the body. \nGiven Olivi’s argumentation against the formal union between the\nintellectual part of the soul and the body, it may seem that the unity\nof the human being is compromised. Olivi argues, however, that the\nrelation between these two parts is substantial even though it is\nmediated by the sensory part and the spiritual matter of the soul. He\nwrites: \nThe substantial union between the intellectual and sensory parts is\ndue to their being the forms of the same spiritual matter of the soul.\nIn this way, all the metaphysical components constitute a single\nsubstance. A human being is an essentially unified entity even though\nthe intellectual part of the soul is not the actuality of the body or\nany of its parts. \nOne of the most interesting and original aspects of Olivi’s\nphilosophy is his critique of the standard Aristotelian model of\ncognition. The starting point of this critique is the Augustinian\nconception of the ontological superiority of the soul with respect to\nthe body, which leads Olivi to insist that perception and intellectual\nunderstanding cannot be passive reception of external stimuli but must\nbe understood as active processes. On the conventional medieval view,\na cognitive power simply receives impressions from the world, in the\nform of sensible or intelligible species. Olivi argues that such an\naccount leaves out a crucial element, the focusing of the cognitive\npower’s attention on the object to be cognized. \nOlivi gives the kinds of examples that one would expect. The ears of\nsomeone sleeping, for instance, receive the same impressions as the\nears of someone awake, but the sleeper does not sense these\nimpressions. Even when we are awake, we sometimes do not perceive\nobjects right in front of us when we are intently focused on something\nelse (Q73, pp. 89–90).  \nOlivi argues that this kind of cognitive attention requires a\n“virtual extension” toward the object. Though he accepts\nthe traditional theory of species in medio, sensible\nqualities that fill the air between the senses and their objects, he\ndenies that these species are the efficient cause of cognition. One\nstriking consequence of this claim is that the object itself need not\nexert any causal influence, not on the cognitive powers nor even on\nthe physical sense organs. The external object need only be close\nenough to be apprehended by the cognizer’s spiritual attention.\nIn the cases of both perception and understanding, the efficient agent\nis the cognitive power. The external object is merely a kind of final\ncause or, more precisely, a “terminative cause” (Q72, p.\n36; Epistola, n. 12). It is merely by being the object of the\ncognitive power’s attention that the external object plays a\nrole in cognition.  \nOlivi treats virtual attention—or directedness—not as a\nsui generis activity of the mind, but as a general kind of causal\nrelationship that can be applied to physical agents just as much as to\nmental ones. For him, every natural physical agent has a virtual\nattention of this sort that extends as far as its causal force does\n(Q23, pp. 424–25). One authority comments that Olivi’s\nvirtual attention is “in fact equivalent to action at a\ndistance” (Jansen 1921, p. 118), a characterization that seems\njust in the case of physical effects such as the light of the sun that\nilluminates distant objects. \nHowever, the case of cognitive acts is different. Olivi carefully\navoids committing to real extramission of vision, and he argues that\nperceptual acts take place in the powers of the soul, not in the\nperceived object (Q58, p. 482; Silva & Toivanen 2010). The virtual\nextension of the soul’s attention is not real, not even in some\nspecial nonphysical sense. When Olivi explains that the extension is\n‘virtual’, he means to contrast it with\n‘real’. He explicitly denies, for instance, that this\nvirtual extension involves “any real emission of its\nessence” (Q73, p. 61). Elsewhere, considering the claim that\n“our mind is where it fixes its intention,” he says that\n“these words are metaphorical. For we are not there really or\nsubstantially, but only virtually or intentionally.” (Q37 ad 13,\np. 672.) On this basis it is fair to say that the soul does not\nactually perform any action at a distance, although its attention can\nbe directed to distant objects. Olivi’s view is best described\nas an intentional theory of cognition (Perler 2003; Toivanen\n2013a). \nOlivi allows that the object itself, through species in\nmedio, can indirectly act on our spiritual faculties, through\nwhat he calls the via colligantiae (way of connection). A\nflash of lightning will make a physical impression on our eyes, and\nthis physical impression can, through the via colligantiae,\naffect the spiritual sensory powers. But, crucially, this connection\nis not what brings about sensation. We see this flash, as\nopposed to receiving merely a physical impression from it, when we\ndirect our spiritual attention toward it (Quodlibet I.4).\nThis via colligantiae plays an important role across\nOlivi’s philosophical psychology, being his general method of\nexplaining the vexed connection between mind and body (see Q59, pp.\n546–54; Q72, pp. 30–35; Jansen 1921, pp. 76–90). \nOlivi’s direct realism is central to his thinking about\ncognition. If he were willing to say that the object of our spiritual\nattention is not the external object but an internal species of the\nobject, then he could reformulate his theory of cognitive attention in\na more plausible way, as a matter of grasping an internal impression\nfrom the object. But Olivi works very hard to avoid falling into any\nkind of position that might be called representationalist—that\nis, a view on which the immediate objects of cognition are internal.\nThis epistemological commitment to direct realism is one of the most\nimportant philosophical reasons for Olivi to reject the standard\nscholastic account of sensible and intelligible species. On that\nstandard account, species serve as forms that provide the intentional\ncontent of sensation and thought. Although these forms were standardly\ndescribed as merely the means by which we grasp external things, Olivi\nargued that in fact the proponent of species was committed to\nrepresentationalism.  \nOlivi argues against the species theory by advancing through a series\nof ever-more-serious charges. First, the theory is committed to taking\nspecies as the objects of cognition: \nHis argument for this conclusion turns on the first sentence of the\npassage, in which he claims that a species cannot represent an object\nto a cognizer unless the cognizer attends to the species. For Olivi,\nsuch attention to some thing is both a necessary and a sufficient\ncondition for that thing’s being cognized. So if we do have to\nfocus our attention in this way on species, he infers that those\nspecies will be the object of cognition, not merely causal\nintermediaries.  \nNext, Olivi argues that species would have to be the first object of\ncognition. To turn toward a species in the way that we must if that\nspecies is to represent the external world “is the same as to\nattend to it as a first object” (Q74, p. 123). Elsewhere,\n“we would always cognize the species before the thing itself\nthat is the object” (Q58 ad 14, p. 469). The point Olivi wants\nto make is one more often made by denying that the world is seen\ndirectly or immediately. If we see the external\nworld at all, we see it only at second hand, indirectly. \nThe argument goes one final step. Someone who wants to claim that our\ninternal sensations are themselves perceived has to choose whether or\nnot to claim that the external world is also perceived. Olivi takes it\nthat it is not; on the species account, we would not perceive the\nexternal world at all, only images of it: \nThe argument is based on a dilemma. Granting that cognizers must\nattend to species, there either will or will not be a separate and\nfurther attention to the object itself. It would of course be quite\nodd to say that there is such a further attention. This would entail,\nas Olivi goes on to say, that one “considers the object in two\nways—first through a species, second in itself” (Q74, p.\n123). This seems too much at odds with the phenomenal feel of\nperception to be a serious possibility. The obvious way out of the\ndilemma, then, is to say that there will not be any further attention:\none apprehends the external world, if one does at all, in virtue of\nattending to the species themselves. This is what the\nrepresentationalist will likely say. But if this is the case, Olivi\nargues, then we won’t be seeing the things in themselves but\nonly their images. Memorably, he remarks that a species “would\nveil the thing and impede its being attended to in itself as if\npresent, rather than aid in its being attended to” (Q58 ad 14,\np. 469; Pasnau 1997).  \nIn place of the species theory, Olivi offers an interesting\nalternative. Rather than treat mental representations as something\nseparate from an act of cognition, Olivi proposes identifying the two.\nOn his view, an act of cognition in itself represents the object that\nis perceived. There is no need to postulate any further representation\nbeyond the act itself: that inevitably results in the mediation that\nOlivi wants to avoid. This act theory would prove influential on later\nscholastics, most notably William Ockham. And in our own era it has\nbeen reinvented and renamed, as the adverbial theory of thought and\nperception. \nOlivi extends his critique of species to the mental word\n(verbum), which was standardly postulated as the product of\nintellectual thought. His treatment of the verbum raises\ndifferent issues from those associated with species. Here the issue is\nnot direct realism, precisely, but rather the nature of concept\nformation. Near the start of his commentary on the Gospel of John,\nOlivi describes the standard view as follows: “Our mental word\nis something following an act of thought ... and formed by that\nthought. ... After it has been formed ... the [extra-mental] object is\nclearly understood or viewed in that word as if in a mirror”\n(Tractatus de verbo 6.1). This word, moreover, “is that\nwhich is first cognized by intellect and is its first object;”\nthe extra-mental object is cognized secondarily. This description\nclosely matches a characterization Olivi gives in his later\nSentences commentary:  \nThis view has two characteristic features. First, it postulates a\nmental representation—a concept or word—that is the\nproduct of intellectual activity. Second, it supposes that we\nunderstand the world through these representations, in such a way that\nwe get at the world indirectly, or secondarily, “as if in a\nmirror.” Call this an object theory of the verbum.  \nOlivi’s own view is that the verbum should be\nidentified with a particular act of thought: “our mental word is\nour actual thought” (Tractatus 6.2.1). When we engage\nin abstract intellectual cognition, Olivi says, “nothing serving\nas an object is really abstracted or formed that differs from the act\nof consideration already mentioned” (6.2.3). The\nSentences commentary offers a concise characterization: \nThere are, then, acts of intellect, but there are no separate inner\nconcepts that are the objects of those acts. Call this an act theory\nof the verbum.  \nWhy is this act theory superior to an object theory? One line of\nargument holds that the object theory “contains in itself\nobvious absurdities and thus contradicts sound reason”\n(Tractatus 6.2.2). This claim is argued in different ways,\nwith the following dilemma often playing a crucial role: On one hand\nthe verbum is said to be the product of intellectual\ncognition. But on the other hand the verbum is said to be\nrequired for cognition as the “first thing understood.”\nHow can it be both? Olivi thinks his opponents will have to maintain\nthat in some way the verbum is the product of one act of\nintellect and the object of a second. This leads him to argue that his\nopponents are treating the verbum as merely a memory. But\nOlivi is happy to countenance representations of this sort. Thus the\nobject theory collapses into the act theory. \nThe second line of attack holds that the theory lacks support because\n“there is no necessity or utility in postulating such a\nverbum” (6.2.3). Here Olivi considers two parallel\nlines of argument that a proponent of the mental word might make\nagainst this charge of superfluity. \nEach argument appeals to our experience of forming within ourselves\nabstract ideas: in the first case propositional ideas, in the second\nuniversals. Intellect in each case is said to form a verbum.\nOlivi replies that no such inner word is necessary. In each case we\nhave an act of conceptual thought, but no object is formed in\nintellect over and above the act of thinking itself. Indeed, if\nanything, such an object “would be an impediment”\n(6.2.3)—alluding to the epistemological difficulties discussed\nin the previous section.  \nBy eliminating the representations that might intervene between\nintellect and external reality, Olivi gives us what we might be\ntempted to think of as a direct realist theory of intellectual\ncognition. Yet direct realism faces a serious problem at the\nintellectual level, a problem that Olivi’s discussion fails to\nacknowledge. Direct realism is attractive as a theory of sensation\nbecause it seems clear what the objects of sensation are. But what are\nwe directly in touch with when our intellect thinks abstractly or\npropositionally? One answer to this question is Platonism: universals\nand/or propositions have some kind of abstract mode of existence,\nindependently of the human mind. Like almost all the scholastics,\nOlivi firmly rejects this kind of account (Q13). Another kind of\nanswer, sometimes called conceptualism, treats universals and/or\npropositions as mental constructs. Defenders of the object theory can\ntake this approach. They can hold that although there are no\nuniversals or propositions in external things (in re), there\nare universals and propositions in the mind (in mente). The\nverbum, serving as universal or as proposition, will (in some\ncautiously described sense) be the object of thought. \nOlivi’s act theory would seem to rule out this kind of\nconceptualism. But what then will Olivi put in its place? He speaks of\nintellect’s “attending to and considering the real\ncharacter of a common or specific nature” (376–379), as if\nhe has an unproblematic account of intellect’s relationship to\nthe external world. Yet he says nothing to clarify the status of this\nrelationship. He simply does not seem to have recognized the problem\nof abstract knowledge as a fundamental metaphysical motivation for the\nobject theory. In this respect his overall account, although\nconceptually innovative, remains fundamentally incomplete. \nOlivi discusses various types of self-reflexivity fairly extensively\nin his writings. He adopts the traditional idea that the intellect is\ncapable of turning reflexively toward itself, but he also attributes\ncertain types of reflexivity to the sensory powers of the soul and\nargues that the will is a reflexive power. \nThe most rudimentary type of self-reflexivity takes place in the sense\nof touch. Aristotle argues in De anima II.11 that the organ\nof the sense of touch is the heart and that the flesh of the body is\nnothing but the medium that transmits the sensations from an external\nobject to the heart. Olivi rejects the Aristotelian theory. He thinks\nthat the whole body functions as the organ of the sense of touch.\nMoreover, he argues that the body is the primary object of the sense\nof touch, while external objects are perceived secondarily by\nperceiving the harmful and beneficial changes that they cause in the\nbody. This position leads to the obvious problem that the sense of\ntouch seems to be a reflexive power, as it is capable of sensing the\nstate of its own organ. Olivi recognises this problem and gives two\npossible solutions: either the sense of touch which is in one place of\nthe body senses the state of the adjacent part of the body, or the\nsense of touch really is capable of a certain type of reflexivity. In\nthe latter case, Olivi argues, the sense of touch would be capable of\nsensing the state of its own organ but not its own act or itself as a\npsychological power. He does not make up his mind between these two\nexplanations, but he clearly thinks that the sense of touch enables a\ncertain kind of bodily self-perception. Even the simplest animals are\ncapable of perceiving their bodies, because every animal has the sense\nof touch. (Q61, pp. 575–85; Yrjönsuuri 2008a; Toivanen\n2013a.) \nThe sense of touch is not the only sensory power that is capable of\nreflexivity. The so-called common sense—the highest cognitive\npower of the animal soul and the only internal sense Olivi\nacknowledges—is another. Although he does not provide a\nsystematic discussion of the reflexivity of the common sense, he\nsuggests in several places that it is capable of apprehending its own\nactivity by turning toward itself incompletely (semiplene)\n(Q62, p. 595). This ability is obviously related to the Aristotelian\nconception of perception of perception, but Olivi suggests something\nmore than the traditional Aristotelian picture. Following Augustine,\nhe argues that animals are aware of their own bodies and the purpose\nand value of their organs and body parts, since otherwise they would\nnot be able to use their bodies effectively and preserve their\nlives: \nThe common sense enables animals to perceive their own bodies, the\nparts and their functions, and the relative value of the parts for the\nwell-being of the animal as a whole, thus making animals capable of\nself-preservation that goes beyond the ability to avoid pain. (See\nToivanen 2013b.) \nThe difference between intellectual self-reflexivity and the\nreflexivity of the common sense is based on the spiritual nature of\nthe intellectual soul. Unlike the common sense, the intellectual mind\nis spiritual and immaterial and therefore capable of being directly\nand immediately aware of itself. Certain authors (most notably\nAquinas) had argued that this kind of direct awareness is not possible\nbecause considered in itself the intellect is fully potential. It must\nbe actualized by thinking something else before it can be cognized. By\ncontrast, Olivi argues that the soul is directly aware of itself: \nBy separating these two types of knowledge that the soul or mind has\nof itself, Olivi is in a position to explain why we do not have\ncertain knowledge of the nature of the soul. The direct awareness\ntells us only that the soul lives and acts, but in order to know the\nessence of the soul, we must compare this immediate awareness to our\nknowledge of the species and genera of the things in the world, and\nthis process is not infallible. (Putallaz 1991; Brower-Toland\n2013.) \nThe highest level of reflexivity, however, is found in the will,\nbecause only the will is capable of moving itself to action. In order\nto be free, the will has to be able to move itself in such a way that\nit can also refrain from moving itself. It has this ability because it\nis related to itself as a mover to a moved thing: “Insofar as\nthe will is free, it has another kind of reflexivity upon itself which\nthe intellect lacks: for, the will is turned toward itself not only as\nto an object, but also as a mover to a moved thing” (Q51, p.\n115). In fact, the reflexivity of the intellect is based on the\nwill’s ability to direct other powers of the soul. (Q57, pp.\n364–66; Q58, pp. 421–23.) Usually human beings are able to\ncontrol themselves by their will, and this ability is what makes them\npersons. Reflexivity of the will plays a crucial role in the process,\nas we can see from a passage in which Olivi explains how sleep affects\nthe psychological processes of the soul: \nExperience shows that the will can act also when a person is asleep,\nas we often make choices in our dreams. But because the reflexivity of\nthe will is hindered, it does not make these choices freely. In this\nway, the ability to move the will to its acts is the crucial factor\nthat makes us free, and our personhood is dependent on the highest\ntype of reflexivity, which ensures that our choices and actions\noriginate in us.","contact.mail":"pasnau@colorado.edu","contact.domain":"colorado.edu"},{"date.published":"1999-11-02","date.changed":"2017-04-24","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/olivi/","author1":"Robert Pasnau","author2":"Juhana Toivanen","author1.info":"http://spot.colorado.edu/~pasnau/","entry":"olivi","body.text":"\n\n\nPeter John Olivi was one of the most original and interesting\nphilosophers and theologians of the thirteenth century. Although not\nas clear and systematic as Thomas Aquinas, and not as brilliantly\nanalytical as John Duns Scotus, Olivi’s ideas are equally\noriginal and provocative, and their philosophical value is nowadays\nrecognized among the specialists in medieval philosophy. He is\nprobably best known for his psychological theories, especially his\nvoluntarist conception of the freedom of the will, but his influence\nextends also to other areas of philosophy, from metaphysics to\npractical philosophy. \n\nOlivi (ca. 1248–1298) was born in Sérignan, in the\nLanguedoc region of southern France. He entered the Franciscan order\nat the age of twelve, studied in Paris from 1267 to about 1272 (during\nthe final years of Bonaventure’s generalate) without becoming a\nmaster of theology, and spent the remainder of his life teaching at\nvarious Franciscan houses of study in southern France, with a stay in\nFlorence from 1287–89. (For biographical details, see Burr 1976\nand 1989, and especially Piron 1998, 1999, 2006a.) Olivi’s\noutspoken originality led him into conflict with religious\nauthorities: his writings were condemned by the Franciscan authorities\nin 1283, and although he was later rehabilitated by the new minister\ngeneral Matthew of Aquasparta, he remained a controversial figure. He\nspent the rest of his life as a lector at Montpellier and Narbonne.\nSoon after his death the Franciscan order renewed the prohibition on\nreading or retaining his works. Although his philosophical views were\ncontroversial, what proved to be fatal was his reputation within the\nso-called “Spiritual” reform movement of the Franciscan\norder. Olivi’s understanding of the Franciscan vow and poverty\nbecame influential among the spiritualists, and after his death he was\nvenerated by fervent laymen in Languedoc. When Church officials took\naction against the spiritual movement, Olivi’s reputation\nsuffered a blow, which obviously limited the influence he would have\non posterity. (See Burr 1989, 1993, 2001.)  \nOlivi produced a large and wide-ranging body of work, much of which\nhas survived. By far the most important philosophical text is his\nSumma of questions on Peter Lombard’s\nSentences, a massive work he began writing soon after leaving\nParis and redacted to its final form in the mid-1290s. This\nmasterpiece of medieval philosophy remains still largely untranslated,\nand edited only in part. Olivi’s views on metaphysics and human\nnature are mostly found in his questions on Bk. II (ed. Jansen,\n1922–26). Material on the virtues is found in Bk. III (ed. Emmen\nand Stadter, 1981). Other philosophically relevant works include his\nQuodlibeta from 1289–95 (ed. Defraia, 2002), a set of\nquestions on logic (ed. Brown, 1986), and the Questions on\nEvangelical Perfection. Many of his biblical commentaries, the\nhistorically significant Commentary on the Apocalypse, and\nvarious texts pertaining to his condemnation have survived and are\navailable in modern editions. (For a recent list of editions, see\nKönig-Pralong et al. 2010.) In this article we will focus on just\na few of Olivi’s interesting philosophical views, concentrating\nespecially on his philosophical psychology.  \nOlivi devotes several extended questions of his Summa to the\ntopic of human freedom, beginning with the question of whether human\nbeings even have free will (liberum arbitrium). Olivi’s\nown argument for the affirmative begins by listing seven pairs of\nattitudes (affectus), each of which testifies to the\nexistence of free will (Q57, p. 317):  \nEach of these attitudes, Olivi claims, is intelligible only given the\nexistence of free will. More specifically, they are “its\ndistinctive products, or its distinctive acts and habits”\n(ibid.). As he runs through the list, explaining how each attitude\nentails free will, it becomes clear that many of these claims are\nfamiliar ones. Zeal, for instance, is an angry reaction to bad deeds,\nmotivated “only against the bad that one judges to have been\ndone voluntarily, and thus which could have been freely avoided”\n(p. 318). Without free will, this attitude is based on an assumption\nthat is “thoroughly false and grounded on a thoroughly false\nobject” (p. 317). As zeal goes, so do the related phenomena of\naccusations, excuses, blame, and guilt. Generally, “a human\nbeing could no more be accused of some vice than he could be accused\nof death, for he could avoid the one as little as the other” (p.\n336). Carefulness and heedlessness, the last pair on the list,\nlikewise become meaningless : “For it is foolish to be careful\nabout things that will occur necessarily” (p. 323). It becomes\npointless to be careful about deliberation, for instance,\n“because the deliberation itself will or will not happen\nnecessarily, and even one’s carefulness will or will not occur\nnecessarily” (p. 323).  \nFor Olivi, these and other data stand as unshakeable evidence for the\nexistence and nature of free will. He makes this clear from the\nbeginning of his reply, when he introduces two premisses that\n“no one of sane mind ought to doubt” (p. 317). First, it\nis impossible for all of the attitudes of one’s rational nature\nto be “thoroughly false and perverse and grounded on a\nthoroughly false and perverse object.” Since Olivi thinks that\nthe attitudes that distinguish us as rational creatures are founded on\nfree will, giving up on free will would be to abandon most of what\nmakes us human. We would cease to be what we properly are, persons,\nand we would become only “intellectual beasts” (p. 338).\nSecond, it is impossible for attitudes to be entirely illusory when\nhuman beings improve and perfect themselves by assuming those\nattitudes (p. 317). If the practices of zeal, deliberation,\nfriendship, love, political power, etc. were all founded on a false\nassumption, then surely these practices would not be so crucial to\nhuman well-being. Thus “no one of sane mind will believe that\nsomething could be the truth which so sharply puts an end to all good\nthings and brings on so many bad things” (p. 338). In the face\nof these implications, we should reject whatever stands in the way of\nfree will, whether that be the authority of Aristotle or some abstruse\nprinciple of metaphysics. “Even if there were no other argument\nestablishing that [the denial of free will] is false, this alone ought\nto be sufficiently persuasive” (p. 338). Moreover, as he\nexplicitly notes, we should be persuaded not just of our own free\nwill, but of the free will of all human beings, since these arguments\nare based not on private experience, but on our relationships with\nothers. \nHaving proved that human beings have free will, Olivi sets out to\nexplain what he means by freedom. His conception obviously belongs\nwithin the libertarian camp in the free will debate, and the central\naspect of it is that in order to be free, the will must be active and\ncapable of reflexively moving itself to action. True, the will’s\nchoices are not necessitated by reason or anything other than by the\nwill itself, but Olivi does not merely conclude that the will is not\nnecessitated; the further conclusion he reaches is that the will,\nuntil it makes a choice, is entirely undetermined one way or another,\nand that it determines itself in the direction it chooses. This is\nsomething “every human being senses with complete certainty\nwithin himself” (p. 327). In arguing that the will determines\nitself, he means that it is a first mover, in need of no efficient\ncause other than itself. “Its free power is the cause of its\nmotion, when it is moved, and the cause of its rest, when it\nrests” (ad 5, pp. 341–42). If the will did not have this\ncapacity for self-movement, then it would have to be determined by\nsomething else, and it would not be making its own choices. But this\nviolates the unshakeable assumptions from which Olivi begins, because\nit would then turn out that the will is not autonomous, not making its\nown choices, hence not a suitable object of one’s zeal or\nfriendship, among other things. \nOlivi is well aware that the lack of autonomy does not entirely\npreclude a sort of pseudo-zeal or pseudo-friendship. One might be\nangry with someone, for instance, not out of the conviction that the\nbad action was that person’s fault, but simply in an effort to\nchange that person’s ways. But this line of thought does\nviolence to our conceptions of ourselves and our fellow human beings.\nWe want people to do the right thing not because they have been\neffectively manipulated, but “solely and purely because of the\nlove of justice” (ad 22, p. 368). Further, when we urge a person\nto do the right thing, “we do not intend simply to move someone\ntoward what is good, but rather to make it that he voluntarily moves\nhimself toward the good” (p. 369). \nMoreover, Olivi argues fervently against the view that the will is a\npower for opposites only with respect to a future instant. In order to\nbe truly free, the will must, in the same instant as it wills\n‘A’, be capable of willing ‘not-A’.\nOlivi’s conception seems to have been the source of John Duns\nScotus’ revolutionary theory of synchronic contingency (Dumont\n1995), and although Scotus is better known as an early proponent of\nlibertarian freedom, his view is heavily indebted to Olivi. Indeed, it\nis arguable that Olivi deserves credit as the founder of this\nconception of freedom of the will. \nWith the rediscovery of Aristotle’s metaphysical and ethical\nworks, thirteenth-century theologians devoted an increasing portion of\ntheir time to interpreting and developing Aristotelian accounts of\nhuman nature. Olivi was very far from a slavish admirer of\nAristotle’s, and his theory of the nature of the soul and its\nrelation to the body differs radically from those medieval\ninterpretations which endeavor to be faithful to the Philosopher.\nNonetheless, he employs the Aristotelian theoretical framework, and\nalthough he often seems to be rather hostile to Aristotle’s\npervasive influence, once remarking that “without reason he is\nbelieved, as the god of this age” (Q58 ad 14, p. 482; see Burr\n1971), the main thrust of his criticism is directed at contemporary\nAverroist interpretations of Aristotle rather than at Aristotle\nhimself (Piron 2006b). The critical, even harsh passages must be\nunderstood in this light. \nNonetheless, he rejects many principles that are crucial for\nAristotle’s account of the soul-body relationship. He argues\nthat it is “not only contrary to reason but also dangerous to\nthe faith” to hold that “the [soul’s] intellective\nand free part is the form of the body per se and considered as\nsuch” (Q51, p. 104). Others had questioned the extent to which\nsoul and body could be analyzed in terms of form and matter, but Olivi\ngoes further because he explicitly denies that one part of the soul,\nthe rational part, can be understood as the form of the body. This\ndenial is ultimately based on his view that the intellectual part of\nthe soul must be spiritual and incorporeal because otherwise it cannot\nbe immortal, intellectual, and free. Yet he does not want to\njeopardize the substantial unity of the soul and the body, and he\nworks towards a theory which incorporates both of these doctrines. \nOlivi’s denial that the soul’s intellectual part is the\nform of the body matches fairly closely with a doctrine that was\ncondemned by the Council of Vienne in 1312, when Pope Clement V\ndeclared in the bull Fidei catholicae fundamento that it is a\nheresy to hold that “the rational or intellective soul is not\nper se and essentially the form of the human body” (Denzinger\n1965, n. 902). However, it is easy to misunderstand what Olivi is\nsaying, and a closer analysis shows that his position is far more\nnuanced than the wording of the condemnation suggests. First, he is\nnot denying that the rational part of the soul is a form, or even that\nit is the form of a human being. To begin with, he follows Bonaventure\nand makes a distinction between two kinds of matter. The human body\nand all material objects are made of corporeal matter, but spiritual\nentities (angels and human souls) also have a material substratum, the\nso-called spiritual matter. Olivi argues that the rational part of the\nsoul, intellect and will, is a form of this spiritual matter. It is\nacceptable to speak of intellect as the form of a human being\nsince the spiritual matter belongs to the human being. But because the\nspiritual matter of the soul is distinct from the corporeal matter of\nthe body, Olivi can maintain that the rational part is not the form of\nthe body. (See e.g. Q51 appendix, p. 138.) \nSecond, Olivi is not denying that the soul is the form of the\nbody. What he denies is that the rational part of the soul\n(“the intellective and free part”) is the form of the\nbody. He resorts to a doctrine of the plurality of substantial forms,\naccording to which complex substances, such as human beings, have\nseveral more or less distinct forms that together make the complete\nhuman being. The intellectual part of the soul is distinct from\nanother part, the sensory part, and only the latter is the form of the\nbody. Because the two parts of the soul are united in the spiritual\nmatter, it is acceptable to say that the whole soul is the form of the\nbody: \nWe should say that the whole soul is the form of the body, in much the\nsame way that we say that a person talks, not a tongue (p. 144). But\nif we direct our attention to the various parts of the soul, then it\nis wrong to say that the rational part, “per se and considered\nas such,” is the form of the body. The soul is the form of the\nbody only with respect to its sensory and nutritive part.  \nDespite his theoretical commitments that are not compatible with\nAristotle’s view, there is a sense in which Olivi might\nplausibly be said to be agreeing with Aristotle, who explicitly leaves\nroom for parts of the soul that “are the actuality of no\nbody” (De an. II.1, 413a7). Presumably, Aristotle is\nthinking of the intellect. But it’s not at all obvious how that\nremark should be interpreted. Aquinas, for instance, holds without\nqualification that “the intellect ... is the form of the human\nbody,” only its acts are not realized in the bodily organs\n(Summa theologiae 1.76.1). So what is it that compels Olivi\nto drop intellect from the hylomorphic scheme? \nOlivi writes that to identify the rational part as the form of the\nbody is “not only contrary to reason but also dangerous to the\nfaith” (as above). More specifically, as he writes in a letter\ndefending his views, he believes that that claim holds “the\ndanger of destroying the soul’s immortality, its liberty, and\nits intellectual nature” (Epistola n. 7). Each of these\nthree consequences is based on one overarching assumption: that to\nmake the soul’s rational part the form of the body is either to\nattribute to the body the distinctive capacities of the rational soul,\nor to deny these capacities to the intellectual soul. Here is how\nOlivi puts that claim: \nIf the intellect is the form of the body, then the body must have the\ncapacities for intellectual thought and free decision. Olivi is of\ncourse going to reject that as absurd. Notice the form of this\nargument. First, Olivi asserts that to be the form of something is to\nimpart actuality to that thing. This seems uncontroversial. Second,\nOlivi argues by analogy. Just as the sensory soul actualizes a body by\ngiving it life and the capacity for sensation, so the intellective\npart—if it is the form of the body—should actualize the\nbody by making it intellective and free. This claim seems plausible as\nwell. If one accepts the first step of the argument, that to be the\nform of something is to impart actuality to that thing, then the\nrational part must be giving something to the body. Olivi\nsays, “every form imparts to its matter some operation, and some\npower for operating” (Q51, p. 109). So, if the rational part\ndoes not render the body immortal and give it the capacity for\nintellective thought and freedom, we have to provide some sort of\naccount of what the rational part does give the body. But what else\ncould the rational part of the soul do for the body, if not endow it\nwith its essential properties and powers?  \nWe might view this argument as posing a dilemma. If the rational part\nis the form of the body, then one must either understand this formal\nrelationship in the ordinary way, in terms of actualizing the body, or\none must concede that the rational part is not the form of the body in\nany ordinary sense. The first horn of the dilemma leads in the\ndirection of materialism, because it forces one to claim that the\npowers of the rational soul are instantiated in the body. The second\nhorn of the dilemma leads one toward retracting the original\nassertion: that the rational part, the intellect, is the form of the\nbody. For it is not at all clear what that means, if the intellect is\nnot in any way actualizing the body. \nGiven Olivi’s argumentation against the formal union between the\nintellectual part of the soul and the body, it may seem that the unity\nof the human being is compromised. Olivi argues, however, that the\nrelation between these two parts is substantial even though it is\nmediated by the sensory part and the spiritual matter of the soul. He\nwrites: \nThe substantial union between the intellectual and sensory parts is\ndue to their being the forms of the same spiritual matter of the soul.\nIn this way, all the metaphysical components constitute a single\nsubstance. A human being is an essentially unified entity even though\nthe intellectual part of the soul is not the actuality of the body or\nany of its parts. \nOne of the most interesting and original aspects of Olivi’s\nphilosophy is his critique of the standard Aristotelian model of\ncognition. The starting point of this critique is the Augustinian\nconception of the ontological superiority of the soul with respect to\nthe body, which leads Olivi to insist that perception and intellectual\nunderstanding cannot be passive reception of external stimuli but must\nbe understood as active processes. On the conventional medieval view,\na cognitive power simply receives impressions from the world, in the\nform of sensible or intelligible species. Olivi argues that such an\naccount leaves out a crucial element, the focusing of the cognitive\npower’s attention on the object to be cognized. \nOlivi gives the kinds of examples that one would expect. The ears of\nsomeone sleeping, for instance, receive the same impressions as the\nears of someone awake, but the sleeper does not sense these\nimpressions. Even when we are awake, we sometimes do not perceive\nobjects right in front of us when we are intently focused on something\nelse (Q73, pp. 89–90).  \nOlivi argues that this kind of cognitive attention requires a\n“virtual extension” toward the object. Though he accepts\nthe traditional theory of species in medio, sensible\nqualities that fill the air between the senses and their objects, he\ndenies that these species are the efficient cause of cognition. One\nstriking consequence of this claim is that the object itself need not\nexert any causal influence, not on the cognitive powers nor even on\nthe physical sense organs. The external object need only be close\nenough to be apprehended by the cognizer’s spiritual attention.\nIn the cases of both perception and understanding, the efficient agent\nis the cognitive power. The external object is merely a kind of final\ncause or, more precisely, a “terminative cause” (Q72, p.\n36; Epistola, n. 12). It is merely by being the object of the\ncognitive power’s attention that the external object plays a\nrole in cognition.  \nOlivi treats virtual attention—or directedness—not as a\nsui generis activity of the mind, but as a general kind of causal\nrelationship that can be applied to physical agents just as much as to\nmental ones. For him, every natural physical agent has a virtual\nattention of this sort that extends as far as its causal force does\n(Q23, pp. 424–25). One authority comments that Olivi’s\nvirtual attention is “in fact equivalent to action at a\ndistance” (Jansen 1921, p. 118), a characterization that seems\njust in the case of physical effects such as the light of the sun that\nilluminates distant objects. \nHowever, the case of cognitive acts is different. Olivi carefully\navoids committing to real extramission of vision, and he argues that\nperceptual acts take place in the powers of the soul, not in the\nperceived object (Q58, p. 482; Silva & Toivanen 2010). The virtual\nextension of the soul’s attention is not real, not even in some\nspecial nonphysical sense. When Olivi explains that the extension is\n‘virtual’, he means to contrast it with\n‘real’. He explicitly denies, for instance, that this\nvirtual extension involves “any real emission of its\nessence” (Q73, p. 61). Elsewhere, considering the claim that\n“our mind is where it fixes its intention,” he says that\n“these words are metaphorical. For we are not there really or\nsubstantially, but only virtually or intentionally.” (Q37 ad 13,\np. 672.) On this basis it is fair to say that the soul does not\nactually perform any action at a distance, although its attention can\nbe directed to distant objects. Olivi’s view is best described\nas an intentional theory of cognition (Perler 2003; Toivanen\n2013a). \nOlivi allows that the object itself, through species in\nmedio, can indirectly act on our spiritual faculties, through\nwhat he calls the via colligantiae (way of connection). A\nflash of lightning will make a physical impression on our eyes, and\nthis physical impression can, through the via colligantiae,\naffect the spiritual sensory powers. But, crucially, this connection\nis not what brings about sensation. We see this flash, as\nopposed to receiving merely a physical impression from it, when we\ndirect our spiritual attention toward it (Quodlibet I.4).\nThis via colligantiae plays an important role across\nOlivi’s philosophical psychology, being his general method of\nexplaining the vexed connection between mind and body (see Q59, pp.\n546–54; Q72, pp. 30–35; Jansen 1921, pp. 76–90). \nOlivi’s direct realism is central to his thinking about\ncognition. If he were willing to say that the object of our spiritual\nattention is not the external object but an internal species of the\nobject, then he could reformulate his theory of cognitive attention in\na more plausible way, as a matter of grasping an internal impression\nfrom the object. But Olivi works very hard to avoid falling into any\nkind of position that might be called representationalist—that\nis, a view on which the immediate objects of cognition are internal.\nThis epistemological commitment to direct realism is one of the most\nimportant philosophical reasons for Olivi to reject the standard\nscholastic account of sensible and intelligible species. On that\nstandard account, species serve as forms that provide the intentional\ncontent of sensation and thought. Although these forms were standardly\ndescribed as merely the means by which we grasp external things, Olivi\nargued that in fact the proponent of species was committed to\nrepresentationalism.  \nOlivi argues against the species theory by advancing through a series\nof ever-more-serious charges. First, the theory is committed to taking\nspecies as the objects of cognition: \nHis argument for this conclusion turns on the first sentence of the\npassage, in which he claims that a species cannot represent an object\nto a cognizer unless the cognizer attends to the species. For Olivi,\nsuch attention to some thing is both a necessary and a sufficient\ncondition for that thing’s being cognized. So if we do have to\nfocus our attention in this way on species, he infers that those\nspecies will be the object of cognition, not merely causal\nintermediaries.  \nNext, Olivi argues that species would have to be the first object of\ncognition. To turn toward a species in the way that we must if that\nspecies is to represent the external world “is the same as to\nattend to it as a first object” (Q74, p. 123). Elsewhere,\n“we would always cognize the species before the thing itself\nthat is the object” (Q58 ad 14, p. 469). The point Olivi wants\nto make is one more often made by denying that the world is seen\ndirectly or immediately. If we see the external\nworld at all, we see it only at second hand, indirectly. \nThe argument goes one final step. Someone who wants to claim that our\ninternal sensations are themselves perceived has to choose whether or\nnot to claim that the external world is also perceived. Olivi takes it\nthat it is not; on the species account, we would not perceive the\nexternal world at all, only images of it: \nThe argument is based on a dilemma. Granting that cognizers must\nattend to species, there either will or will not be a separate and\nfurther attention to the object itself. It would of course be quite\nodd to say that there is such a further attention. This would entail,\nas Olivi goes on to say, that one “considers the object in two\nways—first through a species, second in itself” (Q74, p.\n123). This seems too much at odds with the phenomenal feel of\nperception to be a serious possibility. The obvious way out of the\ndilemma, then, is to say that there will not be any further attention:\none apprehends the external world, if one does at all, in virtue of\nattending to the species themselves. This is what the\nrepresentationalist will likely say. But if this is the case, Olivi\nargues, then we won’t be seeing the things in themselves but\nonly their images. Memorably, he remarks that a species “would\nveil the thing and impede its being attended to in itself as if\npresent, rather than aid in its being attended to” (Q58 ad 14,\np. 469; Pasnau 1997).  \nIn place of the species theory, Olivi offers an interesting\nalternative. Rather than treat mental representations as something\nseparate from an act of cognition, Olivi proposes identifying the two.\nOn his view, an act of cognition in itself represents the object that\nis perceived. There is no need to postulate any further representation\nbeyond the act itself: that inevitably results in the mediation that\nOlivi wants to avoid. This act theory would prove influential on later\nscholastics, most notably William Ockham. And in our own era it has\nbeen reinvented and renamed, as the adverbial theory of thought and\nperception. \nOlivi extends his critique of species to the mental word\n(verbum), which was standardly postulated as the product of\nintellectual thought. His treatment of the verbum raises\ndifferent issues from those associated with species. Here the issue is\nnot direct realism, precisely, but rather the nature of concept\nformation. Near the start of his commentary on the Gospel of John,\nOlivi describes the standard view as follows: “Our mental word\nis something following an act of thought ... and formed by that\nthought. ... After it has been formed ... the [extra-mental] object is\nclearly understood or viewed in that word as if in a mirror”\n(Tractatus de verbo 6.1). This word, moreover, “is that\nwhich is first cognized by intellect and is its first object;”\nthe extra-mental object is cognized secondarily. This description\nclosely matches a characterization Olivi gives in his later\nSentences commentary:  \nThis view has two characteristic features. First, it postulates a\nmental representation—a concept or word—that is the\nproduct of intellectual activity. Second, it supposes that we\nunderstand the world through these representations, in such a way that\nwe get at the world indirectly, or secondarily, “as if in a\nmirror.” Call this an object theory of the verbum.  \nOlivi’s own view is that the verbum should be\nidentified with a particular act of thought: “our mental word is\nour actual thought” (Tractatus 6.2.1). When we engage\nin abstract intellectual cognition, Olivi says, “nothing serving\nas an object is really abstracted or formed that differs from the act\nof consideration already mentioned” (6.2.3). The\nSentences commentary offers a concise characterization: \nThere are, then, acts of intellect, but there are no separate inner\nconcepts that are the objects of those acts. Call this an act theory\nof the verbum.  \nWhy is this act theory superior to an object theory? One line of\nargument holds that the object theory “contains in itself\nobvious absurdities and thus contradicts sound reason”\n(Tractatus 6.2.2). This claim is argued in different ways,\nwith the following dilemma often playing a crucial role: On one hand\nthe verbum is said to be the product of intellectual\ncognition. But on the other hand the verbum is said to be\nrequired for cognition as the “first thing understood.”\nHow can it be both? Olivi thinks his opponents will have to maintain\nthat in some way the verbum is the product of one act of\nintellect and the object of a second. This leads him to argue that his\nopponents are treating the verbum as merely a memory. But\nOlivi is happy to countenance representations of this sort. Thus the\nobject theory collapses into the act theory. \nThe second line of attack holds that the theory lacks support because\n“there is no necessity or utility in postulating such a\nverbum” (6.2.3). Here Olivi considers two parallel\nlines of argument that a proponent of the mental word might make\nagainst this charge of superfluity. \nEach argument appeals to our experience of forming within ourselves\nabstract ideas: in the first case propositional ideas, in the second\nuniversals. Intellect in each case is said to form a verbum.\nOlivi replies that no such inner word is necessary. In each case we\nhave an act of conceptual thought, but no object is formed in\nintellect over and above the act of thinking itself. Indeed, if\nanything, such an object “would be an impediment”\n(6.2.3)—alluding to the epistemological difficulties discussed\nin the previous section.  \nBy eliminating the representations that might intervene between\nintellect and external reality, Olivi gives us what we might be\ntempted to think of as a direct realist theory of intellectual\ncognition. Yet direct realism faces a serious problem at the\nintellectual level, a problem that Olivi’s discussion fails to\nacknowledge. Direct realism is attractive as a theory of sensation\nbecause it seems clear what the objects of sensation are. But what are\nwe directly in touch with when our intellect thinks abstractly or\npropositionally? One answer to this question is Platonism: universals\nand/or propositions have some kind of abstract mode of existence,\nindependently of the human mind. Like almost all the scholastics,\nOlivi firmly rejects this kind of account (Q13). Another kind of\nanswer, sometimes called conceptualism, treats universals and/or\npropositions as mental constructs. Defenders of the object theory can\ntake this approach. They can hold that although there are no\nuniversals or propositions in external things (in re), there\nare universals and propositions in the mind (in mente). The\nverbum, serving as universal or as proposition, will (in some\ncautiously described sense) be the object of thought. \nOlivi’s act theory would seem to rule out this kind of\nconceptualism. But what then will Olivi put in its place? He speaks of\nintellect’s “attending to and considering the real\ncharacter of a common or specific nature” (376–379), as if\nhe has an unproblematic account of intellect’s relationship to\nthe external world. Yet he says nothing to clarify the status of this\nrelationship. He simply does not seem to have recognized the problem\nof abstract knowledge as a fundamental metaphysical motivation for the\nobject theory. In this respect his overall account, although\nconceptually innovative, remains fundamentally incomplete. \nOlivi discusses various types of self-reflexivity fairly extensively\nin his writings. He adopts the traditional idea that the intellect is\ncapable of turning reflexively toward itself, but he also attributes\ncertain types of reflexivity to the sensory powers of the soul and\nargues that the will is a reflexive power. \nThe most rudimentary type of self-reflexivity takes place in the sense\nof touch. Aristotle argues in De anima II.11 that the organ\nof the sense of touch is the heart and that the flesh of the body is\nnothing but the medium that transmits the sensations from an external\nobject to the heart. Olivi rejects the Aristotelian theory. He thinks\nthat the whole body functions as the organ of the sense of touch.\nMoreover, he argues that the body is the primary object of the sense\nof touch, while external objects are perceived secondarily by\nperceiving the harmful and beneficial changes that they cause in the\nbody. This position leads to the obvious problem that the sense of\ntouch seems to be a reflexive power, as it is capable of sensing the\nstate of its own organ. Olivi recognises this problem and gives two\npossible solutions: either the sense of touch which is in one place of\nthe body senses the state of the adjacent part of the body, or the\nsense of touch really is capable of a certain type of reflexivity. In\nthe latter case, Olivi argues, the sense of touch would be capable of\nsensing the state of its own organ but not its own act or itself as a\npsychological power. He does not make up his mind between these two\nexplanations, but he clearly thinks that the sense of touch enables a\ncertain kind of bodily self-perception. Even the simplest animals are\ncapable of perceiving their bodies, because every animal has the sense\nof touch. (Q61, pp. 575–85; Yrjönsuuri 2008a; Toivanen\n2013a.) \nThe sense of touch is not the only sensory power that is capable of\nreflexivity. The so-called common sense—the highest cognitive\npower of the animal soul and the only internal sense Olivi\nacknowledges—is another. Although he does not provide a\nsystematic discussion of the reflexivity of the common sense, he\nsuggests in several places that it is capable of apprehending its own\nactivity by turning toward itself incompletely (semiplene)\n(Q62, p. 595). This ability is obviously related to the Aristotelian\nconception of perception of perception, but Olivi suggests something\nmore than the traditional Aristotelian picture. Following Augustine,\nhe argues that animals are aware of their own bodies and the purpose\nand value of their organs and body parts, since otherwise they would\nnot be able to use their bodies effectively and preserve their\nlives: \nThe common sense enables animals to perceive their own bodies, the\nparts and their functions, and the relative value of the parts for the\nwell-being of the animal as a whole, thus making animals capable of\nself-preservation that goes beyond the ability to avoid pain. (See\nToivanen 2013b.) \nThe difference between intellectual self-reflexivity and the\nreflexivity of the common sense is based on the spiritual nature of\nthe intellectual soul. Unlike the common sense, the intellectual mind\nis spiritual and immaterial and therefore capable of being directly\nand immediately aware of itself. Certain authors (most notably\nAquinas) had argued that this kind of direct awareness is not possible\nbecause considered in itself the intellect is fully potential. It must\nbe actualized by thinking something else before it can be cognized. By\ncontrast, Olivi argues that the soul is directly aware of itself: \nBy separating these two types of knowledge that the soul or mind has\nof itself, Olivi is in a position to explain why we do not have\ncertain knowledge of the nature of the soul. The direct awareness\ntells us only that the soul lives and acts, but in order to know the\nessence of the soul, we must compare this immediate awareness to our\nknowledge of the species and genera of the things in the world, and\nthis process is not infallible. (Putallaz 1991; Brower-Toland\n2013.) \nThe highest level of reflexivity, however, is found in the will,\nbecause only the will is capable of moving itself to action. In order\nto be free, the will has to be able to move itself in such a way that\nit can also refrain from moving itself. It has this ability because it\nis related to itself as a mover to a moved thing: “Insofar as\nthe will is free, it has another kind of reflexivity upon itself which\nthe intellect lacks: for, the will is turned toward itself not only as\nto an object, but also as a mover to a moved thing” (Q51, p.\n115). In fact, the reflexivity of the intellect is based on the\nwill’s ability to direct other powers of the soul. (Q57, pp.\n364–66; Q58, pp. 421–23.) Usually human beings are able to\ncontrol themselves by their will, and this ability is what makes them\npersons. Reflexivity of the will plays a crucial role in the process,\nas we can see from a passage in which Olivi explains how sleep affects\nthe psychological processes of the soul: \nExperience shows that the will can act also when a person is asleep,\nas we often make choices in our dreams. But because the reflexivity of\nthe will is hindered, it does not make these choices freely. In this\nway, the ability to move the will to its acts is the crucial factor\nthat makes us free, and our personhood is dependent on the highest\ntype of reflexivity, which ensures that our choices and actions\noriginate in us.","contact.mail":"juhana.toivanen@jyu.fi","contact.domain":"jyu.fi"}]
