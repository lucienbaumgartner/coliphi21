He is generally recognized\nto be both the most outstanding philosopher (in terms of originality)\nof the Carolingian era and of the whole period of Latin philosophy\nstretching from Boethius to Anselm. Eriugena is, also, though this\nparallel remains to be explored, more or less a contemporary of the\nArab Neoplatonist Al-Kindi. Since the seventeenth century, it has\nbecome usual to refer to this Irish philosopher as John Scottus (or\n“Scotus”) Eriugena to distinguish him from the\nthirteenth-century\n John Duns Scotus (see entry).\n \n\nEriugena’s uniqueness lies in the fact that, quite remarkably\nfor a scholar in Western Europe in the Carolingian era, he had\nconsiderable familiarity with the Greek language, affording him access\nto the Greek Christian theological tradition, from the Cappadocians to\nGregory of Nyssa, hitherto almost entirely unknown in the Latin West.\nHe also produced a complete, if somewhat imperfect, Latin translation\nof the Corpus Dionysii, the works of the obscure, possibly\nSyrian, Christian Neoplatonist, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a\nfollower of Proclus. In addition, Eriugena translated Gregory of\nNyssa’s De hominis opificio and Maximus\nConfessor’s Ambigua ad Iohannem, and possibly other\nworks, such as Epiphanius’ Anchoratus.\n\n\nEriugena’s thought is best understood as a sustained attempt to\ncreate a consistent, systematic, Christian Neoplatonism from diverse\nbut primarily Christian sources. Eriugena had a unique gift for\nidentifying the underlying intellectual framework, broadly Neoplatonic\nbut also deeply Christian, assumed by the writers of the Christian\nEast. Drawing especially on Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Pseudo-Dionysius\nthe Areopagite, Maximus Confessor, as well as on the more familiar\nauthorities (auctores) of the Latin West (e.g., Cicero, Augustine, Macrobius,\nMartianus Capella, Boethius), he developed a highly\noriginal cosmology, where the highest principle, “the immovable\nself-identical one” (unum et idipsum immobile,\nPeriphyseon, Patrologia Latina 122: 476b), engenders all\nthings and retrieves them back into itself. Contrary to what some\nearlier commentators supposed, it is most unlikely that Eriugena had\ndirect knowledge of the original texts of Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus,\nor other pagan Neoplatonists, but he did have some direct knowledge of\nPlato (a portion of Timaeus in the translation of Calcidius)\nas well as familiarity with the pseudo-Augustinian Categoriae\ndecem.\n\n\nOverall, Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which\nthe infinite, transcendent, and “unknown” God, who is\nbeyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation,\nprocession, or “self-creation”, proceeds from his divine\n“darkness” or “non-being” into the light of\nbeing, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same\ntimeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation.\nThese causes in turn proceed into their Created Effects and as such\nare creatures entirely dependent on, and will ultimately return to,\ntheir sources, which are the Causes or Ideas in God. These Causes,\nconsidered as diverse and infinite in themselves, are actually one\nsingle principle in the divine One. The whole of reality or nature, is\ninvolved in a dynamic process of outgoing (exitus) from and\nreturn (reditus) to the One. God is the One or the Good or\nthe highest principle, which transcends all, and which therefore may\nbe said to be “the non-being that transcends being”. In an\noriginal departure from traditional Neoplatonism, in his dialogue\nPeriphyseon, this first and highest cosmic principle is\ncalled “nature” (natura) and is said to include\nboth God and creation.\n\n\nNature is defined as universitas rerum, the “totality\nof all things”, and includes both the things which are (ea\nquae sunt) as well as those which are not (ea quae non\nsunt). This divine nature may be divided into a set of four\n“species” or “divisions” (divisiones)\nwhich nevertheless retain their unity with their source. These four\ndivisions of nature taken together are to be understood as God,\npresented as the “Beginning, Middle, and End of all\nthings”.\n\n\nApart from having a minor influence in France in the ninth century,\nEriugena’s cosmological speculations appear too conceptually\nadvanced for the philosophers and theologians of his time, and his\nphilosophical system was generally neglected in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies. His main work, Periphyseon, was revived by\ntwelfth-century Neoplatonists, and also circulated in a compendium,\nClavis Physicae (The Key of Nature) of Honorius\nAugustodunensis. The Periphyseon was popular among the\nphilosophers of Chartres and St. Victor (e.g., Hugh of St. Victor\nrefers to it) but was condemned in the thirteenth century, alongside\nthe writings of David of Dinant and Amaury of Bène, for\npromoting the identity of God and creation. In the fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries, Eriugena continued to have a relatively\nclandestine but still important influence on Christian Neoplatonists\nsuch as Meister Eckhart and especially Nicholas of Cusa. The first\nprinted editions of his works appeared in the seventeenth century, but\nit was not until the nineteenth century that interest in him was\nrevived, especially among followers of Hegel who saw Eriugena as a\nforerunner to speculative idealism, as a “Proclus of the\nWest” (Hauréau, 1872) and the “Father of\nSpeculative Philosophy” (Huber, 1861).  The first truly\nscholarly attempt to establish the facts of his life, his works and\ninfluence was by the Belgian scholar Maiul Cappuyns, whose 1933\nwork Jean Scot Erigène: sa vie, son oeuvre, sa\npensée is still reliable. Many valuable twentieth-century\nstudies (e.g., Contreni, 1992; Marenbon, 1981, 2006; Schrimpf, 1982;\nO’Meara, 1969, 1988) have explored Eriugena’s Carolingian\nbackground and continuity with Latin authors. However, systematic\nstudies of his thought (Beierwaltes, 1980, 1987, 1990; Gersh, 1978,\n2006; Moran, 1989, 1999) have also recognized him as a highly original\nmetaphysician and speculative thinker of the first rank whose work\ntranscends the limitations of his age and mode of expression.\n\nNothing is known about Eriugena’s place or date of birth or of\nthe circumstances of his early life, but, on the basis of\ncircumstantial evidence and some surviving testimonia\n(helpfully gathered in Brennan 1986), it is conjectured that he was\nborn in Ireland around 800 or possibly slightly earlier (c. 790). His\nIrish provenance is confirmed by the fact that he self-consciously\nsigned his translation of Pseudo-Dionysius’ works with the\nneologism “Eriugena” (Patrologia Latina,\nhereafter PL, 122: 1236a) meaning “Irish born”, a word\npossibly modelled on the Virgilian “Graiugena”\n(Aeneid 3.550, see Heyworth & Morwood, 2017: 223).\nThe word “Eriugena”\nbecame corrupted to “Erigena” in twelfth century library\nentries (e.g., the Cluny catalogue) and by the seventeenth century it\nbecame common to refer to him as “John Scot(t)us Erigena”\n(e.g., by Bishop Ussher and Thomas Gale). A scattering of Old Irish\nwords used to explain difficult or recondite Latin terms, in his\nBiblical glosses (Glossae; see edition by Contreni &\nÓ Néill, 1997), is further evidence of his Irish origin\nand of the presence of Irish students in his audience (since the time\nof Charlemagne Irish scholars had constituted a considerable presence\nin the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their\nlearning). \nEriugena’s first certain appearance in historical records occurs\naround 850/1 where mention is made, in a letter by Bishop Pardulus of\nLaon, of “a certain Irishman, named Johannes, who is at the\npalace of the king” (“Scotum illum qui est in palatio\nregis, joannem nomine”, Epistola ad ecclesiam\nLugdunensem, in De tribus epistolis, PL 121: 1052a), who\nwas engaged in a theological controversy with Gottschalk of Fulda. It\nis also certain that Johannes had been installed for some time at the\ncourt of Charles the Bald, the West Frankish king, but he was also\nassociated with other ecclesiastical centers, including Rheims, Laon,\nSoissons, and Compigne. There is no direct evidence that he was a monk\nor cleric (he refers to his “frater in Christo”\n[“brother in Christ”], Periphyseon, PL 122:\n1022a, Wulfad, who later became a bishop, but this appellation does\nnot definitively confirm Eriugena’s own church status). \nEriugena had a justified reputation among his contemporaries as a man\nof considerable learning. Florus calls him scholasticus et\neruditus (PL 119: 103a) and Anastasius, the Vatican librarian of\nthe day, marveled at the fact that this “barbarian”\n(vir barbarus) from a remote land knew Greek? (Brennan, 1986)\nTwo partial commentaries (c.\n840–c.850) on De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii\n[The Marriage of Philolology and Mercury], the liberal arts\nhandbook of the late Latin author, Martianus Capella, survive from\nEriugena’s period as royal master, as well as the Biblical\nglosses, Glossae Divinae Historiae, all of which attest to\nhis skill as a grammaticus. Eriugena has a rich and eclectic\nknowledge of the liberal arts tradition, including Isidore,\nCassiodorus, and Cicero. He had a reputation for dialectic, as his\nopponents recognized when they criticized him for bringing his\ndialectical skills to bear on theological discussion. Thus, his critic\nPrudentius remarked: “Your Capella has led you into a labyrinth,\nbecause you have tied yourself more to the meditation of his work than\nto the truth of the Gospel” (PL 115: 1294a). Nevertheless, Eriugena continues the approach of Alcuin to make the arts more\nthan mere instruments but to connect them to wisdom and to point to\nthe unity of knowledge; thus He is both a contributor and a catalyst for the “new wave”\nunleashed by the adoption of Priscian and Martianus Capella (see\nContreni, 1992)  \n\nThe Martianus commentary is most famous for its apparent espousal of a\nnon-Ptolemaic account of the movement of the planets in Book Seven on\nastronomy. Pierre Duhem (1958) thought that Eriugena was offering a\nversion of the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe, and in fact\nEriugena is correctly reporting Martianus’ account which seems\nto be a version of Heraclides of Pontus’ theory. Indeed,\nCopernicus would later single out Martianus for praise for his theory\nthat Mercury and Venus orbit the sun instead of the earth. Eriugena\nwent further than Martianus in placing Mars and Jupiter in orbit\naround the sun also. \nThe influence of Eriugena is difficult to gauge but the echoes are\nunmistakable among his immediate posterity among the Carolingians such\nas Heiric of Auxerre (841–c.880), Almann of Hautvillers (active\nc.865–c.875), and perhaps Hucbald of Saint-Amand (c.\n840/850–930) (see Contreni, 1992). \nEriugena first came to historical notice when he was commissioned by\ntwo French bishops—Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims and Bishop\nPardulus of Laon—to refute a treatise by a Saxon monk,\nGottschalk (806–68), a priest of Orbais in the diocese of\nSoissons, who interpreted St. Augustine as teaching a\n“twofold” or “twin predestination” (gemina\npraedestinatio) of the elect to heaven and of the damned to hell,\nbased on the opinion of St. Isidore, Sententiae II, 6, I (PL\n83: 606a). Gottschalk had already been condemned by a synod at Mainz\nin 848 and another at Quierzy in 849 and had been imprisoned in the\nabbey of Hautvillers (where he remained until his death in 868), but\nPrudentius, the bishop of Troyes, appeared to side with him. Hincmar\nwas worried that Gottschalk’s side was attracting powerful\nsupporters and he engaged Eriugena to write a strong rebuttal.\nEriugena’s response, De divina praedestinatione (On\nDivine Predestination, c. 851, see Madec edition, 1978), a\ntreatise of nineteen chapters, which survives in a single manuscript,\nis a robust rebuttal of Gottschalk. Eriugena rejects any divine\npredestination to evil by an appeal to God’s unity,\ntranscendence, and goodness. While purporting merely to interpret\nAugustinian texts, this early theological treatise is philosophically\nsignificant for its rationalistic, dialectical analysis of key\ntheological concepts and its reliance on argument rather than\nscriptural citation. In this treatise, Eriugena, citing\nAugustine’s De uera religione 5.8, PL 34: 126, claims\n“that true philosophy is true religion and conversely that true\nreligion is true philosophy”. As one gloss in the\nAnnotationes in Marcianum attests: “no one enters\nheaven except through philosophy” (nemo intrat in celum nisi\nper philosophiam, Annotationes 57.15, AM: 64). Eriugena\nthen argues that philosophy has four principal parts—division,\ndefinition, demonstration, and resolution—and the pursuit of\nthis fourfold method of reasoning will lead to truth. This focus on\ndialectic as the path to truth is a constant theme of Eriugena’s\nphilosophy, one recognized by his contemporaries. \nEriugena argues in De divina praedestinatione that God, being\nperfectly good, wants all humans to be saved, and does not predestine\nsouls to damnation. God’s being is His willing and “no\nnecessity binds the will of God”. On the contrary, humans damn\nthemselves through their own free choices: “Sin, death,\nunhappiness are not from God”. Since God is outside time, He\ncannot be said to fore-know or to pre-destine, terms\nthat involve temporal predicates. Furthermore, if God’s being is\nHis wisdom, God can be said to have but a single knowledge and hence a\n“double” predestination cannot be ascribed to Him. Human\nnature, on the other hand, was created rational, and rationality\nrequires freedom. Human nature is therefore essentially free:\n“For God did not create in man a captive will but a free one,\nand that freedom remained after sin”\n(De divina praedestinatione, 4.6).\n \nIn the course of his diatribe against the “ravings” of\nGottschalk, Eriugena locates his opponent’s heresy as midway\nbetween the heresy of Pelagius, which rejects the power of grace, and\nthe opposing heresy, which denies the possibility of human freedom.\nIronically, Eriugena himself would in turn be accused of\n“Origenism” and “Pelagianism” by\nGottschalk’s advocate, Bishop Prudentius of Troyes (see the\nlatter’s De Praedestinatione, PL 115: 1010c), due to\nhis perceived emphasis on human free-will in the salvific process.\nPrudentius, an erstwhile admirer of Scottus, published an opposing\ntreatise, which, while acknowledging his “Irish eloquence”\n(Celtica eloquentia, PL 115: 1194a), dismisses\nEriugena’s reasoning as confused and not based on sound\nknowledge of scripture. Florus too attacked Eriugena. Subsequently,\nOn Divine Predestination was condemned by the bishops in\nFrance at the councils of Valence (855) and Langres (859), in part for\nits over-use of logical method or dialectic (dialectica). The\nphrase “Irish porridge” (pultes scottorum),\nrecalling Jerome’s sneer against Pelagius, is used in these\nofficial denunciations. \nDespite the official ecclesiastical condemnations of On\nPredestination, for reasons that are not known but are presumed\nto be political, Eriugena continued to have the protection and\npatronage of King Charles the Bald, who, around 860, invited him to\ntranslate the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a\nmysterious Christian Neoplatonist who purported to be Dionysius, the\nfirst convert of St. Paul at Athens, but was more likely a late fifth\nor early sixth-century Christian follower of Proclus. The Corpus\nDionysii had been given a gift to Charles the Bald’s\nfather, Louis the Pious, from the Byzantine Emperor Michael the\nStammerer in 827, a gift thought appropriate possibly because of a\nmisidentification of Pseudo-Dionysius with the patron saint of France,\nSt. Denis. Hilduin had attempted an earlier translation in\n832–5, but Eriugena’s version was most successful and\nremained in circulation until the thirteenth century when Jean\nSarrazin’s translation replaced it. Indeed, Eriugena’s\ntranslation was utilized by the Vatican Librarian Anastasius, who\nadded scholia to it. Anastasius decried the word-for-word translation,\nhowever he contributed to it, thereby indicating its importance\n(Harrington, 2004). \nSoon after completing his translation of Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 862), he\nwent on to translate other Greek Christian texts: he translates\nMaximus Confessors’ Ambigua ad Ioannem and then his\nQuaestiones ad Thalassium; Gregory of Nyssa’s De\nhominis opificio, under the title of De imagine and\npossibly Epiphanius’ Anchoratus de Fide. Eriugena also\nwrote a long commentary on Pseudo-Dionysius’ Celestial\nHierarchy (Expositiones in hierarchiam coelestem). It is possible he made\nother translations which have not survived or which cannot be\ndefinitively attributed to him, e.g., Boethius’ De\nmusica. \nEriugena’s major work, the Periphyseon, also titled in\nsome manuscripts, De divisione naturae (On the Division of\nNature), is a long dialogue between a “teacher” (Nutritor) and a “student”\n(Alumnus), was probably begun in the early 860s, just after he had\ncompleted the Pseudo-Dionysius translation, and finished around 867\n(the date Wulfad, to whom the work is dedicated, became bishop, making\nit unlikely that Eriugena would have referred to him as\nfrater, brother, after his consecration as bishop). The first\nprinted edition of this dialogue appeared in 1681 and subsequently an\nedition by Floss appeared in 1853 which is now contained in PL 122.\nInglis Patrick Sheldon-Williams (1908–1973) began a new edition\nof Periphyseon with the publication of his text and\ntranslation of Book One in 1968 in the Scriptores Latini\nHiberniae series of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies,\nfollowed soon after by his edition of Periphyseon Book Two in\n1970, and Book Three, published after Sheldon-Williams’ death,\nin the same series in 1981, seen through the press by the late John J.\nO’Meara. Sheldon-Williams had assembled materials for the\nedition of Books Four and Five and had completed a draft English\ntranslation of these books, which was published separately in one\nvolume edited by John J. O’Meara. O’Meara and\nÉdouard Jeauneau continued the edition of Sheldon-Williams,\nbringing out Book Four in the same series in 1995. Book Five, edited\nby Mark Zier, is scheduled to appear shortly in the Scriptores\nLatini Hiberniae series. However, due to some deficiencies in\nSheldon-Williams’ manner of editing, and his mistaken conception\nof the manuscript tree, Jeauneau has undertaken an entirely new\ncritical edition of the Periphyseon for the Corpus\nChristianorum Continuatio Mediaevalis series. All five books of\nthe Periphyseon have appeared in this series.\nSheldon-Williams was of the opinion that Periphyseon Book One\nhad emerged from an earlier “essay in dialectic”, but\noffered no evidence for this interpretation, which takes an overly\nrestrictive view of the first book of the dialogue. The main weakness\nof Sheldon-Williams’ editing strategy was that it had conflated\nvarious versions of the text drawn from several different manuscripts\ninto a single composite script, in a similar manner to the earlier\neditors, Thomas Gale in 1681 and H.-J. Floss in 1853. Gale and Floss\nhad published editions that combined into a single text both the text\nof the main body of the manuscript and the various marginal\nannotations in different hands. This composite version disguised the\ngradual evolution of the text and Jeauneau is of the opinion that this\nmixed type of edition is inadequate to the needs of scholarship. The\nnew Jeauneau edition is based on six manuscripts, including two\nmanuscripts, Paris Bibl. nat. lat. 12965 and Bamberg Phil. 2/2, not\nused by Sheldon-Williams since they contained only Books Four and\nFive. Jeauneau has suggested that the extant manuscripts of the\nPeriphyseon show four distinct levels of development, that\nis, four early “editions”. One special difficulty in\nediting the Periphyseon is that the earliest manuscripts\npreserve only the first three books whereas the extant manuscripts for\nBooks Four and Five date from the twelfth century. Avranches and\nCambridge, both twelfth century manuscripts, are the sole witnesses\nfor the end of Book Four and the whole of Book Five in Stage Two\nversions, with Avranches noticeably less accurate than Cambridge in\nseveral places. \nA fragmentary Commentary on the Gospel of St. John\n(Commentarius in Evangelium Iohannis) and a sermon\n(Homilia in Johannem) on the Prologue to St. John’s\nGospel were also written probably in the late 860s or 870s. A number\nof interesting poems (Carmina) survive which show the breadth of\nEriugena’s learning; but also portray him as a courtier quite\nwell versed in political affairs. Some poems are written specifically\nin praise of the king, including an important poem, Aulae\nsidereae [Starry Halls] which appears to celebrate the dedication\nof Charles the Bald’s new church in Compigne on 1 May 875. The\npoems show Eriugena’s fascination with Greek and some poems are\nactually written entirely in Greek; and the poems are probably the\nmost Maximean in character through their cosmic Christology. It is\nprobable that Eriugena died sometime around 877. An apocryphal tale,\ndating from the twelfth century, records that Eriugena was stabbed to\ndeath by his students with their pens! \nDespite the claims of some nineteenth-century commentators, it is now\nclear that Eriugena did not have direct knowledge of the writings of\nPlotinus, Porphyry, or Proclus. He had almost no contact with pagan\nNeoplatonism in general (apart possibly from Priscianus Lydus and\nCalcidius’ translation of the Timaeus). His familiarity\nwith Aristotle was also indirect—through the anonymous but\nwidely circulated compilation, Categoriae decem, the\nPseudo-Augustinian paraphrase of Aristotle’s\nCategories. He knew Boethius’ trinitarian tracts\n(Opuscula sacra) and possibly the Consolation of\nPhilosophy, since a set of glosses on this work may be in\nEriugena’s hand (although this is disputed). His chief\nauthorities in the Latin Christian Tradition were the works of the\nFathers, chiefly Augustine (especially his De Genesi ad\nlitteram), Ambrose, Hilary of Poitiers, and Jerome. His\noriginality is largely due to the manner in which he assimilated\n(often translating) the Neoplatonic thought of Eastern Christian\nwriters such as the Cappadocians, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa,\nGregory Nazianzus, as well as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and\nMaximus Confessor. He also was familiar with Rufinus’ Latin\ntranslation of Origen’s On First Principles and was\noften linked with Origen in medieval times. Though he took the view\nthat the authorities of East and West were not in conflict,\nnevertheless he usually expressed a preference for the Eastern Church\nFathers. An especially important authority was Maximus Confessor,\nwhose account of the return of all things Eriugena copiously\nborrowed. \nEriugena’s exceptional learning would be sufficient to\ndistinguish him from contemporary Carolingian scholars, such as Alcuin\nand Sedulius Scottus; but his true and lasting genius lay in his\nability to combine elements from these auctores into a new\ncosmological framework which is rationally argued to the highest\ndegree. Eriugena enthusiastically incorporated many Greek Christian\ntheological concepts: God, the One, creates by self-emanation;\ncreation is a timeless, and hence on-going and always contemporary,\nevent; human nature is originally a Platonic Idea in the mind of God;\nhuman nature is a certain intellectual concept formed eternally in the\nmind of God, Periphyseon, IV.768b). Humans fail to understand\ntheir true nature as image of God in God, because they are distracted\nby created, fleeting temporal “appearances”\n(phantasiai), which entrap the intellect in the clouded\nspatio-temporal realm of sense. However, through intellectual\ncontemplation (theoria, intellectus) and divine illumination\n(which is the receiving of a divine self-manifestation,\ntheophania), humans may achieve unification\n(henosis) with God, and the select few will even undergo\n“deification” (deificatio, theosis) which\nEriugena interprets as complete identity with God. \nIn his discussion of this cosmological saga, Eriugena always appeals\nto dialectic and the order of reasons in order to mediate between the\nvarious sources. For Eriugena, true philosophy is vera ratio\nand indeed, all appeal to authority is nothing other than an appeal to\nright reason (Periphyseon, I.511b). Vera ratio\nunderlies both the cosmos and reason. Eriugena is therefore a strongly\nrationalistic (in the Medieval sense of the word) philosopher,\nattempting to make sense of divine revelation in scripture and nature\nin terms consistent with the evidence of reason based on the rules of\nDialectic. Dialectic, moreover, is not just about the organization of\nwords and thoughts but also describes the structure of reality itself.\nThus, in the Periphyseon IV.781c–d, he makes the bold\nclaim that one need only introduce the “opinions of the holy\nFathers” where  \nthe gravest necessity requires that human reason be supported for the\nsake of those who, being untrained in it, are more amenable to\nauthority than reason. \nThe encounter with the Greek fathers and especially with Maximus\nConfessor has proven crucial for Eriugena’s own thinking but\nalso for the development of intellectual history in Western Europe;\nEriugena was not only a translator or synthesizer but someone who\nappropriates creatively and constructively. The only other comparable\nprecedent is Anicius Boethius’  grand project of translating the\ncorpus of Aristotle and of Plato; the only difference is that Eriugena\nactually carries out his translation project: besides the Corpus\nDionysiacum, he translates Gregory of Nyssa’s De\nOpificio Hominis (which he calls De Imagine) and parts,\nif not the entire, homilies on the Hexaemeron of Basil the\nGreat; above all, Eriugena translates a great part of the Maximian\ncorpus: the entire Questiones ad Thalassium and great parts\nof the Ambigua ad Iohannem. \nThese translations and the ideas about creation and nature,\nanthropology, philosophy and theology encountered in Eriugena’s\nwritings will constitute an important undercurrent which will inform\nand influence many thinkers in Western thought (see below\n Section 4 on Influence). \nDionysius is the formative influence on Eriugena; it is through him\nthat he first drinks from the “sacred nectar of the\nGreeks”. The discovery of Dionysius had a profound effect on\nEriugena’s thinking. He enthusiastically adopted the\nAreopagite’s main ideas (many of which appear to be drawn from\nProclus’ Commentary on the Parmenides),\ne.g., the distinction between\naffirmative (kataphatic) and negative theology (apophatic), according\nto which denials concerning God (e.g., “God is not good [in the\nway we know goodness]”) are “more true”,\n(verior) “better”, “more apt”, than\naffirmations (“God is good”), as well as the analysis of\nthe divine names as applying only metaphorically\n(metaphorice, transferre, per metaphoram)\nand not literally (proprie) to God, who is\n“beyond all that is”. For Pseudo-Dionysius, we do not know\nGod directly but know Him only through his theophaniai, or\ndivine appearances (Pseudo-Dionysius, Divine Names, ch. 7, PG\n3: 869c–d). We could, through affirmative theology, ascribe\nattributes to God, because He is the “cause of all”\n(aitia panton, Mystical Theology, ch. 2, PG 3:\n1000b), but in fact God in His nature is transcendent and\n“unknowable”, he is the “more-than-divine\ndivinity”, which Eriugena renders as superdeus deitas\nin his translation (PL 122: 1121c). Pseudo-Dionysius claims that God\nis the affirmation of all things, the negation of all things, and\nbeyond all affirmation and denial (in Eriugena’s translation:\nGod is omnium positio, omnium ablatio, super omnem positionem et\nablationem inter se invicem, PL 122: 1121c-d). \nEriugena’s view of the cosmos as holy order (hierarchia) where\nmediation (medietas) is realized through theophanies (theophaniai) is mostly derived from Dionysius; by\ncontemplating (theoria) this order, the human being can\nreturn to its divine source through the mediation of these theophanies; Eriugena expands this idea by finding a correlation between theophanies and\nMaximus’ logoi (as the reasons and principles of all created beings) and Augustine’s seminal reasons; he then brings all these aspects together into the framework of cosmic Christology, inspired by Maximus, in which the human being is\nco-participant in the redemption of creation. \nAlthough he has recourse to Maximus Confessor hoping that he might offer some\nclarifications for understanding Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus will offer\nEriugena much more: a trove of ideas, methods, and philosophical\nvocabulary. Thus, Maximus allows him to expand and clarify the\ninsights received from Dionysius and provides him with an eclectic\nphilosophical and theological vocabulary: the Maximian oeuvre offers a\npalimpsest of Neo-Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophical terms and\nconcepts along with a rich theological vocabulary which is mostly a\nsynthesis of terms and concepts derived from Pseudo-Dionysius and the\nCappadocian Fathers (Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Basil\nthe Great). \nThe very method of the Periphyseon, which employs natural\nphilosophy and exegesis of the Bible interchangeably, in order to contemplate and\n“read” the two “books” (creation and\nScripture) in which the divine signs (theophanies) are manifested, can be\ntraced back to Maximus’  notion of knowledge as contemplation of\nnature (theoria physikè). If contemplated and read\nfrom the right perspective, scripture and creation become transparent\nto divine presence. \nEriugena adopts the cosmological framework of Maximus’ \nChristian Neoplatonism: the cosmic movement of exitus becomes\nthe incarnation, the mystery of Christ becoming man; reditus,\nthe return of all beings to their source, coincides with deification,\nhumans ascending to God through deification\n(θέωσις). Eriugena will go\nfurther and correlate these cosmic movements with the two main\noperations of dialectic: division and analysis; this allows him to\nconstruct a deep correspondence between epistemology and ontology.\nThus, Maximus’  cosmic Christology based on the Logos-logoi ontology, offers Eriugena a framework\nwhich allows him to expand the use of dialectic from mere method \nto a cosmic framework which underlies both epistemology and\nontology. \nMaximus’ understanding of the incarnation as a cosmic event\ninforms Eriugena’s ontology and his notion of theophanic\ncreation; although the notion of theophany is first derived from\nDionysius, it is enhanced through Maximus’ understanding of the\nincarnation of Christ as a cosmic mediation and unification of all\naspects and levels of reality. Through the ideas of Pseudo-Dionysius\nand Maximus, Eriugena overcomes the distrust of visible and material\nnature found in Neoplatonism; rather he believes contemplating the theophanies encountered in nature (which has been redeemed through the incarnation of the Logos) is necessary for the return of creation to its divine source. \nEriugena’s anthropology is based on Maximus’ insight that\nthe human being is a synthesis of all aspects of creation, as he says,\nthe “workshop of creation“ (officina omnium) and as such plays\na crucial role in unifying creation through proper knowledge; the\nentire dialogue of the Periphyseon could be seen as a\nspiritual exercise (exercitatio animi) of training through\nthe liberal arts in order to attain the level of intellectual\nknowledge; the goal of exercitatio is to contemplate nature\nin the right way in order to repair the fragmentation of creation by\nachieving a unified vision and thus realize the return of all things\nto their divine source. The human being as officina omnium\nplays a central role in the process of return (reditus) because as a primordial idea in the divine mind,\nit can mediate between the primordial causes and the created effects.\nHowever, only through the incarnation (in which Christ assumes human\nnature in its totality), can the full, cosmic scope of this process of mediation and unification through the human being as officina omnium be realized: through the incarnation of Christ the Logos, the universal human nature and through it the\nrest of creation is unified, redeemed and ultimately divinized. [see\nalso\n section 3.9 Human Nature] \nThe Periphyseon as a grand dialogue on physiology\n(physiologia is Eriugena’s hybrid science of physics-theology-philosophy)\nstands in continuity with the exercitatio animi and the liberal arts tradition of\nAugustine’s early philosophical dialogues. Eriugena appropriates\nand expands on Augustine’s trust that reason (ratio)\ncan be trained by the liberal arts and can thus contemplate creation.\nAugustine’s intellectualism is crucial for Eriugena’s\nphilosophical anthropology although Eriugena seems to be much more\ntrusting than Augustine in the ability of the human to refashion\nitself through paideia. \nInformed by Dionysius notion of theophanic cosmic order, Eriugena is\nmore comfortable with the complexities of Neoplatonic cosmology and\nwith mediation (medietas) and less preoccupied with the issue\nof divine simplicity. Nevertheless, the Augustinian strain is not lost\nin Eriugena: both the human being and the creation have a Trinitarian\nstructure. Along with Basil the Great, it is Augustine (through his great commentary on Genesis, De Genesi ad litteram) who teaches Eriugena to read and interpret the Hexaemeron (the creation account in Genesis 1) in a more literal and realistic manner and thus to counter-balance the more allegorical reading of Gregory of Nyssa;  Augustine constitutes both a foil and a catalyst for\nEriugena’s thinking; his great challenge in the\nPeriphyseon is trying to reconcile the Augustinian perspective with\nthat of the Eastern thinkers. \nAugustine’s concept of the primordial causes (primordiales\ncausae ) along with Maximus’ concept of logoi\nallow Eriugena to forge a realistic ontology based on intelligible\nspecies of visible things which are immanent in created beings (see\nErismann, 2011). \nEriugena cites almost 25% of Gregory of Nyssa’s De\nImagine—as he refers to the De hominis\nopificio—in the Periphyseon. Gregory of Nyssa’s and\nBasil’s accounts of creation provide the missing pieces, and\ncomplements the cosmology Eriugena derives from the partial Latin\ntranslation of the Timaeus. Basil the Great’s\nHomilies on the Hexaemeron provide him with a model for\nreading Genesis literally. \nGregory of Nyssa’s imago dei anthropology provides the\nscaffolding for Maximus’ understanding of the role and status of\nthe human being. Eriugena extrapolates from both Gregory of\nNazianzus’ view that the essence of God is ineffable and\nultimately beyond definition and from Gregory of Nyssa’s\napophatic anthropology; therefore, both the divine and the human are\nultimately unfathomable and ineffable: as the image of God (imago\ndei), the human being in its essence is as incomprehensible and\nundefinable as God. \nThe idea that the human being is uncircumscribed and indefinable is\nderived from Gregory of Nyssa, and Eriugena connects it with\nMaximus’  officina omnium view of the human being and\nwith Augustine’s Trinitarian theology. \nEriugena’s masterpiece is undoubtedly the Periphyseon\n(written c.862–c.867), a long dialogue in five\nbooks—between an anonymous “teacher”\n(Nutritor) and his “student”\n(Alumnus)—that attempts to be a compendium of all\nknowledge presented within a Neoplatonic cosmology of the procession\nand return of all things from the divine One. \nThe Periphyseon, deeply influenced by Eriugena’s\nengagement with Greek Christian authors, is a work of astonishing\nscope, a veritable Christian Neoplatonic summa. At the\nbeginning of Book Four, Eriugena labels his enterprise a\nphysiologia, a “study of nature”, and indeed one\nmanuscript of the Periphyseon in the British Library in\nLondon calls the whole dialogue “Liber Phisiologiae Iohannis\nScottigenae”. The term “physiologia”\nis apt in that the term “nature” for Eriugena spans the\nwhole cosmological domain, including not just created nature but also\nthe Divine Creator, and treats of the essentially dialectical relation\nbetween Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation\nand creation culminates in return to the divine. Nature is to be\nunderstood as what is real in the widest sense, the totality of all\nthings that are and are not. Nature includes both God and creation and\nhas four divisions: nature which creates and is not created (God),\nnature which creates and is created (the Primordial Causes), nature\nwhich is created and does not create (the Created Temporal Effects),\nand nature which is neither created nor creates (Non-Being). The\noriginal intention (expressed at III.619d–620b) was to devote\none book to each of the four divisions; thus Book One deals with the\ndivine nature and the procession or exitus of all things from\nGod, Book Two treats of the Primordial Causes, and Book Three of their\nCreated Effects, including the nature of ex nihilo creation\nand the stages of the creation of the world. The topic of creation\nrequires Eriugena to address issues related to the Biblical\naccount of creation, and thus, in Book Three, he embarks on his own\nversion of a Hexaemeron. The momentous event of the emergence\nof human nature on the Sixth Day of creation requires extended\ntreatment, and Eriugena is forced to devote a fourth book to this\ntopic, thus relegating the return of all things to God to a fifth\nbook. Thus, Eriugena was forced to depart from his original plan of\nfour books and add a fifth. This change of plan is particularly\nimportant in that it helps to identify different stages of composition\nof the text. \nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the Periphyseon is\nEriugena’s ability to bring together into a symphony of ideas\nsuch a variety of thinkers and sources: the liberal arts and the philosophical dialogue traditions, the officina omnium anthropology of Maximus Confessor, the\ntheophanic ontology of Dionysius the Areopagite, Augustine’s Trinitarian\ntheology, Basil the Great’s realistic hermeneutics of the Hexaemeron, and Gregory\nof Nyssa’s imago dei anthropology and his account of creation; however, we may say\nthat the grand tapestry of the Periphyseon is woven from many\nthreads but the fabric is Maximian. Maximus Confessor’s vision\nprovides the impetus that drives the argument of the dialogue and also\nthe framework in which the encounter and conversation among the\nvarious sources takes place. \nBook One opens abruptly with the claim that “nature”\n(natura), “the general term for all things that are and\nall things that are not”, (I.441a), including both God and\ncreation, is divided into four species. Echoing similar divisions in\nAugustine (De civitate Dei Bk. V. 9, PL 41: 151) and Marius\nVictorinus (Ad Candidum), nature’s four\n“divisions” or “species” are: that which\ncreates and is not created (i.e., God); that which creates and is\ncreated (i.e., Primary Causes or Ideas); that which is created and\ndoes not create (i.e., Temporal Effects, created things); that which\nis neither created nor creates (i.e., non-being, nothingness). The\nfirst species of nature is God, “the cause of all things that\nare and that are not” (I.442b). There are several remarkable\naspects of this division. First of all, division is defined by\nEriugena in De praedestinatione as a branch of dialectic.\nSecondly, the four divisions are not strictly a hierarchy in the usual\nNeoplatonic sense where there are higher and lower orders, rather, as\nEriugena will explain, the first and fourth divisions both refer to\nGod as the Beginning and End of all things, and the second and third\ndivisions may also be thought to express the unity of the cause-effect\nrelation. Finally, the division is an attempt to show that nature is a\ndialectical coming together of being and non-being. Creation is\nnormally understood as coming into being from non-being. God as\ncreator is then a kind of transcendent non-being above the being of\ncreation. These themes are rigorously discussed and disentangled\nthroughout the dialogue. \nImmediately following on his abrupt announcement of the four divisions\nof nature, Eriugena proceeds to list “five ways of\ninterpreting” (quinque modi interpretationis) the\nmanner in which things may be said to be or not to be\n(Periphyseon, I.443c–446a). According to the first\nmode, things accessible to the senses and the intellect are said to\nbe, whereas anything which, “through the excellence of its\nnature” (per excellentiam suae naturae), transcends our\nfaculties are said not to be. According to this classification, God,\nbecause of his transcendence is said not to be. He is\n“nothingness through excellence” (nihil per\nexcellentiam). \nThe second mode of being and non-being is seen in the “orders\nand differences of created natures” (I.444a), whereby, if one\nlevel of nature is said to be, those orders above or below it, are\nsaid not to be: \nFor an affirmation concerning the lower (order) is a negation\nconcerning the higher, and so too a negation concerning the lower\n(order) is an affirmation concerning the higher.\n(Periphyseon, I.444a) \nAccording to this mode, the affirmation of man is the negation of\nangel and vice versa (affirmatio enim hominis negatio est angeli,\nnegatio vero hominis affirmatio est angeli, I.444b). This mode\nillustrates Eriugena’s original way of dissolving the\ntraditional Neoplatonic hierarchy of being into a dialectic of\naffirmation and negation: to assert one level is to deny the others.\nIn other words, a particular level may be affirmed to be real by those\non a lower or on the same level, but the one above it is thought not\nto be real in the same way. If humans are thought to exist in a\ncertain way, then angels do not exist in that way. \nThe third mode (I.444c–445b) contrasts the being of\nactual things with the “non-being” of\npotential or possible things still contained, in\nEriugena’s memorable phrase, “in the most secret folds of\nnature” (in secretissimis naturae sinibus). This mode\ncontrasts things which have come into effect with those things which\nare still contained in their causes. According to this mode, actual\nthings, which are the effects of the causes, have being, whereas those\nthings which are still virtual in the Primary Causes (e.g., the souls\nof those as yet unborn) are said not to be. \nThe fourth mode (I.445b–c) offers a roughly Platonic criterion\nfor being: those things contemplated by the intellect alone (ea\nsolummodo quae solo comprehenduntur intellectu) may be considered\nto be, whereas things caught up in generation and corruption, viz.\nmatter, place and time, do not truly exist. The assumption is that\nthings graspable by intellect alone belong to a realm above the\nmaterial, corporeal world and hence are timeless. \nThe fifth mode offered by Eriugena is essentially theological and\napplies solely to humans: those sanctified by grace are said to be,\nwhereas sinners who have renounced the divine image are said not to\nbe. \nOne of the striking features of this complex—and certainly, in\nthis form, original—account is that being and non-being are\ntreated as correlative categories: something may be said to be under\none mode and not to be under another. Attribution of being is subject\nto the dialectic of affirmation and negation. Eriugena returns in Book\nThree to give a very complex discussion of the meaning of\n“ex nihilo” in the concept of creatio ex\nnihilo, which makes use of some of these modes of being and\nnon-being, and, in general, these modes should be borne in mind when\ninterpreting Eriugena’s more overt metaphysical statements. Thus\nwhen Eriugena calls God “nothing”, he means that God\ntranscends all created being, God is nihil per\nexcellentiam (“nothingness on account of excellence”)\nor, as he puts it, nihil per infinitatem (“nothingness\non account of infinity”). Matter, on the other hand, is also\ncalled “nothing” but it is “nothing through\nprivation” (nihil per privationem). Similarly, created\nthings are called “nothing” because they do not contain in\nthemselves their principles of subsistence (Eriugena is here repeating\nSt. Augustine’s view that the creature, considered apart from\nGod, is mere nothing). \nPeriphyseon Book One examines the first division, God\nunderstood as a transcendent One above, and yet cause of, all\ncreation. God transcends everything; He is, following\nPseudo-Dionysius, the “negation of all things”\n(negatio omnium, III.686d). According to Eriugena—who\nin this respect is following a tradition which includes Augustine and\nBoethius as well as Dionysius and other Greek authors—the\nAristotelian categories are considered to describe only the created\nworld and do not properly apply to God (I.463d). God cannot\n“literally” (proprie) be said to be substance or\nessence (ousia, essentia), nor can He be described in terms\nof quantity, quality, relation, place or time. He is\n“superessentialis” (I.459d), a term which, for\nEriugena, belongs more to negative theology than to affirmative. His\n“being” is “beyond being”. Eriugena\nparticularly admires a Dionysian saying from the Celestial\nHierarchy (CH iv 1; PG 3: 177d1–2): to gar einai panton\nestin he hyper to einai theotes (“for the being of all\nthings is the Divinity above being”, III.686d) which he\ntranslates as esse omnium est superesse divinitatis,\n(“the being of all things is the super-being of divinity”,\nIII.686d, I.443b; see also I.516c; III.644b, V.903c). This is perhaps\nEriugena’s favorite phrase from Dionysius. (Indeed, Maximus\nConfessor had also commented on it in I Ambigua xiii, PG 91:\n1225d, a passage well known to Eriugena who translated the\nAmbigua.) Sometimes, instead of invoking the Dionysian\nformula superesse divinitatis, Eriugena speaks of the\n“divine superessentiality” (divina\nsuperessentialitas, III.634b), or—quoting Divine\nNames I 1–2 (PG 3: 588b–cb)—of the\n“superessential and hidden divinity” (superessentialis\net occulta divinitas, I.510b). \nGod is a “nothingness” (nihilum) whose real\nessence is unknown to all created beings, including the angels (447c).\nIndeed, Eriugena argues in a radical manner, following Maximus\nConfessor, that God’s nature is infinite and uncircumscribable,\nsuch that He is unknown even to Himself, since He is the\n“infinity of infinities” and beyond all comprehension and\ncircumscription. In the Periphyseon, Eriugena repeats the\nposition of the De Praedestinatione that God does not know\nevil, and, in a genuine sense, God may be said not to know anything;\nhis ignorance is the highest wisdom. \nEriugena conceives of the act of creation as a kind of\nself-manifestation wherein the hidden transcendent God creates himself\nby manifesting himself in divine outpourings or theophanies (I.446d).\nHe moves from darkness into the light, from self-ignorance into\nself-knowledge. The divine self-creation or self-manifestation\n(I.455b) is, at the same time (or rather timelessly), the expression\nof the Word (Logos) and hence the creation of all other things, since all\nthings are contained in the Word. The Word enfolds in itself the Ideas\nor Primary Causes of all things and in that sense all things are\nalways already in God: \n…the Creative nature permits nothing outside itself because\noutside it nothing can be, yet everything which it has created and\ncreates it contains within itself, but in such a way that it itself is\nother, because it is superessential, than what it creates within\nitself. (Periphyseon, III.675c) \nGod’s transcendent otherness above creatures is precisely that\nwhich allows creatures to be within God and yet other than God.\nEriugena stresses both the divine transcendence above and immanence in\ncreation. The immanence of God in the world is at the same time the\nimmanence of creatures within God. Creatures however, as fallen, do\nnot yet know that they reside in God. In cosmological terms, however,\nGod and the creature are one and the same: \nIt follows that we ought not to understand God and the creature as two\nthings distinct from one another, but as one and the same. For both\nthe creature, by subsisting, is in God; and God, by manifesting\nhimself, in a marvelous and ineffable manner creates himself in the\ncreature…. (Periphyseon, III.678c) \nElsewhere Eriugena’s asserts that God is the “essence of\nall things” (essentia omnium) and the “form of\nall things” (forma omnium). In the thirteenth century,\nexpressions such as these led to the accusation of heresy, i.e., that\nEriugena is collapsing the difference between God and creation. It\nmust be noted, however, that although Eriugena asserts the identity of\nGod and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the\n“genus” or “whole” (totum) of which\nthe creatures are “species” or “parts”. Only\nmetaphorically (metaforice, translative) can it be\nsaid that God is a “genus” or a “whole”.\nAssertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always\nbalanced in Eriugena’s writings by assertions of God’s\ntranscendence above all things. God is both “form of all\nthings” and also is without form, formless. Since God cannot be\nsaid to be anything, God cannot be simply identified with any or every\ncreature either. \nThe main focus of the Second Book of the Periphyseon is an\nanalysis of what Eriugena terms “the Primary Causes”\n(causae primordiales) which are the patterns of all things\nlocated in the mind of God and function as the timeless and unchanging\ncauses of all created things. This doctrine represents an eclectic\ncombination of various earlier doctrines, including the Platonic\ntheory of Forms or ideai, Dionysius’ discussion of the\ndivine names, and Augustine’s revival of the Stoic notion of\neternal reasons (rationes aeternae). \nGod’s mind, understood as the logos or verbum,\ncontains in one undivided Form all the reasons for every individual\nthing. These reasons (rationes, logoi) are\nproductive of the things of which they are the reasons. Their number\nis infinite and none has priority over the other, e.g., Being is not\nprior to Goodness, or vice-versa. Each is a divine theophany, a way in\nwhich the divine nature is manifested. The very nature of these Causes\nis to flow out from themselves, bringing about their Effects. This\n“outflowing”\n(πρόοδος,\nproodos; processio, exitus) creates the\nwhole universe from the highest genus to the lowest species and\n“individuals” (atoma). In his understanding of\nthis causal procession, Eriugena accepts Neoplatonic principles: like\nproduces like; incorporeal causes produce incorporeal effects; an\neternal cause produces an eternal effect. Since the causes are\nimmaterial, intellectual and eternal, so their created effects are\nessentially incorporeal, immaterial, intellectual, and eternal.\nEriugena, however, thinks of cause and effect as mutually dependent,\nrelative terms (Periphyseon, V. 910d–912b): a cause is not a cause unless it\nproduces an effect, an effect is always the effect of a cause. \nWhat is the ontological status of the created effects? By nature, they\nare eternal and incorruptible, but Eriugena also thinks of individual\ncreated things as located spatially and temporally. He seems to think\nthere are two kinds of time: an unchanging time (a reason or\nratio in the divine mind,Periphyseon, V.906a) and a corrupting time.\nPlace and time are definitions in that they situate or locate the\nthings they define, and since definitions are in the mind, then place\nand time are in the mind (Periphyseon, I.485b). Following Gregory of Nyssa,\nEriugena holds that the sensible, corporeal, spatio-temporal\nappearances of things are produced by the qualities or\n“circumstances” of place, time, position, and so on, which\nsurround the incorporeal, eternal essence. The whole spatio-temporal\nworld and our corporeal bodies are a consequence of the Fall, an\nemanation of the mind. Eriugena is somewhat ambiguous about this. His\nconsidered position appears to be that God, foreseeing that man would\nfall, created a body and a corporeal world for him. But this corporeal\nbody is not essential to human nature and in the return of all things\nto God, the body will be absorbed back into the spiritual body\n(spirituale corpus) and the spiritual body back to the mind\n(mens, intellectus, νοῦς). The\ncorporeal world will return to its incorporeal essence, and place\nunderstood as the extension will return back into its cause or reason\nas a definition in the mind (Periphyseon, V.889d). \nBook Three discusses the nature of created effects and the meaning of\n“creation from nothing” (creatio ex nihilo). The\nterm “nothing” has two meanings: it can mean\n“nothing through privation” (nihil per\nprivationem), or “nothing on account of excellence”\n(nihil per excellentiam). The lowest rung in the hierarchy of\nbeing, unformed matter, is “almost nothing” (prope\nnihil), or “nothing through privation”. In contrast,\nGod is non-being through the excellence of His nature which transcends\nall being. Since there is nothing outside God, “creation from\nnothing” cannot mean creation from some principle outside God,\nrather it means: creation out of God’s superabundant\nnothingness. God creates out of himself (a se) and all\ncreation remains within him. \nBooks Four and Five, originally planned as one book, discuss the\nreturn (ἐπιστροφή,\nepistrophe, reditus, reversio) of all\nthings to God. According to the cosmic cycle Eriugena accepts, drawing\nheavily on Maximus Confessor and his interpretation of\nGregory of Nyssa, it is in the nature of things for effects to return\nto their causes. There is a general return of all things to God.\nCorporeal things will return to their incorporeal causes, the temporal\nto the eternal, the finite will be absorbed in the infinite. The human\nmind will achieve reunification with the divine, and then the\ncorporeal, temporal, material world will become essentially\nincorporeal, timeless, and intellectual. Human nature will return to\nits “Idea” or “notio” in the mind of\nGod. According to Eriugena’s interpretation of scripture,\n“paradise” is the scriptural name for this perfect human\nnature in the mind of God. Humans who refuse to let go of the\n“circumstances” remain trapped in their own phantasies,\nand it is to this mental state that the scriptural term\n“hell” applies. Eriugena maintains that the real hell is\ndeprivation of the vision of God: “whoever is without Christ is\nin darkness, for Christ is the inner light”\n(Periphyseon, V.936b–937a). Eriugena continues:\n“Take Christ from me, and no good is left for me, nor is there\nany torment left to terrify me” (Periphyseon, V.989a). Eriugena thinks the\nGreek word for “hell”, ᾅδης, is\nless misleading than the Latin infernus: “But the\nGreeks, displaying as usual a greater intelligence and a subtler\naccuracy, called the nether regions ᾅδης,\nthat is, “sorrow”” (Periphyseon, V.955a).\nThe Latin infernus, in effect suggests an inferior place. On\nthe contrary, the Greek equivalent of infernus, i.e.,\nᾅδης, designates not a place, but a state:\nsorrow or unpleasantness: α\nprivative—ἡδύς. \nAside from the general return of all things to God, Eriugena claims\nthere is a special return whereby the elect achieve\n“deification” (deificatio, theosis,\nθέωσις) whereby they will\nmerge with God completely, as lights blend into the one light, as\nvoices blend in the choir, as a droplet of water merges with the\nstream. God shall be all in all (omnia in omnibus, Periphyseon, V\n935c). \nEriugena’s account of human nature is complex and fascinating\nbecause it is woven of several threads derived from a variety of\nsources: Maximus Confessor, Pseudo-Dionysius, Gregory of Nyssa, and\nlast but not least, Augustine. Books Four and Five contain\nEriugena’s anthropology, explicated as part of his commentary on\nthe six days of creation (the Hexaemeron); this aspect has recently been the focus of much\nphilosophical interest (Stock, Otten, Moran). Eriugena’s account\nranges widely, treating of the creation of human nature, the Fall and\nthe consequent division of the sexes, the meaning of human nature as\nmade in the image and likeness of God (in imaginem et\nsimilitudinem dei), the nature of paradise to which perfected\nhuman nature will return, the nature of evil and how it relates to human will. He\ndraws heavily on Augustine’s commentaries on Genesis, especially\nDe Genesi ad litteram, as well as Ambrose’s De\nParadiso, Basil the Great’s Homilies on the Hexaemeron and extensively on Gregory of Nyssa’s De hominis\nopificio. But Eriugena is never a slavish follower—he\ndeparts from Augustine on several points, including on the question of\nthe purely spiritual nature of paradise: whether Adam’s body was\nanimal or spiritual, and whether humans ante peccatum ever\nactually spent time in paradise. Eriugena adopts Gregory of\nNyssa’s view that sexual difference is a result of the Fall,\nthat the real Fall is the fall from intellect into sense, intellect\ndistracted by the voluptuousness of sense. So, sexual difference\nreally makes no difference for humans, or as Eriugena boldly puts it:\n“Man is better than sex” (homo melior est quam\nsexus, Periphyseon,  II.534a). This, Eriugena believes, agrees with Scripture:\n“in Christ there is neither male nor female” (Periphyseon, IV.795a).\nThus, Eriugena’s radical Scriptural exegesis, in part building\non Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus, supports original philosophical\nclaims about the sexless nature of true, undivided, human nature. \nJust as the transcendent nature of God allows us to legitimately apply\ncontradictory predicates to Him (“Deus est; deus\nnon est”), so too we may apply contradictory predicates to\nhuman nature. Though Book IV of the Periphyseon has the\nappearance of a Biblical commentary, dialectic also plays a privileged\nrole. Eriugena employs dialectic to highlight the contradictions\ninherent in human nature: man is an animal and man is not an animal;\nman is spiritual and not spiritual. For Eriugena, these contradictions\nare really indications of man’s exalted status; his essence\ncannot be circumscribed. \nHuman nature in this respect resembles the divine nature which too is\n“both beyond all things and in all things”\n(Periphyseon, IV.759a–b). \n\n \nNevertheless, humanity is a mirror of all things, and therefore Eriugena can offer\nthe definition of humanity as “a certain intellectual concept\nformed eternally (aeternaliter facta) in the divine\nmind” (Periphyseon, IV.768b). But of course, since everything is an Idea in\nthe divine mind, this definition applies not only to human nature but\nto all other things too. Eriugena believes he has articulated the\nuniversality and comprehensive nature of humanity but not its\nuniqueness in this definition. Following Gregory of Nyssa, Eriugena\ntherefore rejects the traditional account of human nature as a\n“microcosm”, made up of all parts of the world. He uses\nthe Greek term “microcosmos” only once in the\nPeriphyseon, at IV.793c, where he is quoting Gregory of\nNyssa, De imagine Chapter 17 (Cappuyns, 1965: 232) and glosses\nthe word: “id est paruum mundum”: “that is,\na small world”. Gregory says those who try to glorify human\nnature by saying it is a microcosm actually do not glorify human\nnature at all. For all creatures, even a mouse, are made up of the\nfour elements, and will pass away. Gregory continues: \nBut, according to the Church’s reasoning, the greatness of man\nlies not in his likeness to the created world but in the fact that he\nis created according to the image of the Creator of nature.\n(Periphyseon, IV.794a) \nEriugena, however, recognizes the crucial role of human nature in mediating\nbetween the divine and created things. Human nature is the\n“workshop of all things” (officina omnium,\nII.530d; IV.755b). Human nature is a medium between animal\nand angel, a medietas between the earthly and the\nintelligible worlds. Human nature contains not only elements from the\ncorporeal world but also belongs to the intelligible world: \nI declare that man consists of one and the same rational soul\nconjoined to the body in a mysterious manner, and that it is by a\ncertain wonderful and intelligible division that man himself is\ndivided into two parts, in one of which he is created in the image and\nlikeness of the Creator, and participates in no animality …\nwhile in the other he communicates with the animal nature and was\nproduced out of the earth, that is to say, out of the common nature of\nall things, and is included in the universal genus of animals.\n(Periphyseon, IV.754a–b) \nThe highest dignity for human nature is that it uniquely mirrors\ntranscendent divine nature. Only of human nature can it be said that\nit is made in the image and likeness of God. Not even the angels are\naccorded that honor, so in a sense man is greater than the angels.\nHuman nature may even require the application of affirmative and\nnegative propositions: Man is an animal and man is not an animal\n(IV.758b).  Although, for Eriugena, “rational animal”\ndoes not completely define human nature,\nthis mirroring of God in man occurs especially in the cognitive\ndomain. Like Maximus, Eriugena argues that God knows that He is\n(quia est), but not what He is (quid est). God has\nexistential knowledge, but no circumscribing knowledge of His essence,\nsince, as infinite, He is uncircumscribable: \nSo God does not know of Himself what He is because He is not a\n“what”, being in everything incomprehensible both to\nHimself and to every intellect … But He does not recognize\nHimself as being something (Se ipsum autem non cognoscit aliquid\nesse) … For if He were to recognize Himself in something,\nHe would show that He is not in every respect infinite and\nincomprehensible. (Periphyseon, II.589b–c) \nFollowing Maximus Confessor, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine, Eriugena\ntakes the imago dei idea to its ultimate consequence by\nforging an apophatic-negative anthropology: the human being, as the image of God,  knows\nthat it is, but it cannot comprehend or\ncircumscribe its own essence or nature, since, in its deepest core, as imago dei, it too is infinite as God is infinite. All that can be done is to specify the\n“circumstances” (circumstantiae) which surround\nhis essence, e.g., place, time, rest, motion, condition, etc.,\n(Periphyseon, II.586d). The human being in this sense is an\nimage of the infinite and uncircumscribable God, and an image is\nidentical to its archetype in all respects “except in respect of\nsubject” (praeter rationem subiecti,\nPeriphyseon II.598b). Any difference between God and human\nnature is the result not of essence but of “an accident produced\nby sin” (sed ex delicto accidit, II.598b). Human\nself-ignorance mirrors the divine self-ignorance; human\nincomprehensibility mirrors divine incomprehensibility. This makes\nhuman nature share in infinity. \n \nEriugena elaborates on the parallels\nbetween human and divine nature. Perfect human nature would have\npossessed the fullest knowledge of its Creator, of itself, and of\neverything else, had it not sinned (Periphyseon, IV.778c). Man would have ruled the\nwhole of the universe as a king rules his subjects (Periphyseon, IV.782c). Man,\nlike God, is the plenitudo bonorum (Periphyseon, IV.796a). Just as God is\nunbounded by any category and ultimately indefinable, human nature is\nineffable and incomprehensible and open to infinite possibility and\nperfectibility (Periphyseon, V.919c). God’s transcendence and immanence are\nreflected in human transcendence and immanence with regard to its\nworld. Consider the following remarkable passage from Book Four which\nis a typical example of Eriugena’s dialectical thinking and of\nthe close parallelism between human and divine: \nFor just as God is both beyond all things and in all things—for\nHe Who only truly is, is the essence of all things, and while He is\nwhole in all things He does not cease to be whole beyond all things,\nwhole in the world, whole around the world, whole in the sensible\ncreature, whole in the intelligible creature, whole creating the\nuniverse, whole created in the universe, whole in the whole of the\nuniverse and whole in its parts, since He is both the whole and the\npart, just as He is neither the whole nor the part—in the same\nway human nature in its own world (in its own subsistence) in its own\nuniverse and in its invisible and visible parts is whole in itself,\nand whole in its whole, and whole in its parts, and its parts are\nwhole in themselves and whole in the whole. (Periphyseon,\nIV.759a–b) \nEriugena concludes that human nature is  \nwholly in the wholeness of the whole created nature (in\nuniversitate totius conditae naturae tota est), seeing that in it\nevery creature is fashioned, and in it all are linked together (in\nipsa copulata), and into it all shall return, and through it must\nall be saved. (Periphyseon, IV.760a) \nEriugena’s cosmological account has been criticized for\ncollapsing the differences between God and creation, leading to a\nheresy later labeled as pantheism. There is no doubt that\nEriugena’s theological intentions are orthodox, but he is a\nbold, speculative thinker, who believes that philosophy uncovers the\ntrue meaning of faith. Eriugena (as does Nicholas of Cusa) gives a\nunique place to Christ in the outgoing and return of all things. In\nChrist, the hypostatic union of the divine and the created orders is\nrealized. Christ possesses all the perfections of human nature, since\nvir autem perfectus est Christus (Periphyseon,\nIV.743b), and Christ is also one in substance with God. Eriugena\nrecognizes that Christ is unique and that the individual is not\ncollapsed into the universal, even in the return. Humans will always\nbe different from God in that they have been created and God is\nCreator (Periphyseon, IV.796b). However, a case can also be\nmade for saying that Eriugena really intends his perfected human\nnature to possess divine attributes in a genuine way. The argument\nturns on an answer to the following question: To what extent is man\nmade in the image and likeness of God? Eriugena has two answers: an\nimage is not an image unless it is identical to its exemplar in all\nrespects “except number” or “subject”\n(excepta subiecti ratione, Periphyseon, IV.778a).\nFrom this we may conclude that the human being differs from God in\nsubiecto, that is, there is solely a difference in number. But\ndifference in number does not mean that God and man stand apart from\neach other as two identical billiard balls would occupy different\nplaces. Neither God nor man is in space or time; both are incorporeal,\nand hence numerical difference, or difference in subject, can only\nhave the Neoplatonic meaning that the first will always differ from\nwhat comes after the first. God is first, and hence man comes after.\nBut “after” (post) here has no temporal meaning,\nas Eriugena emphasizes (Periphyseon, IV.808a). A second\nanswer he gives is that God is creator and man is created, but since\ncreation is self-manifestation, that amounts to saying no more than\nthat God manifests himself fully in man. Eriugena sometimes qualifies\nthis by saying that man is by grace (per gratiam) what God is\nby nature, quoting Maximus Confessor (e.g., Periphyseon,\nV.879c–880a), but elsewhere, especially in the concept of\ntheophany or divine manifestation, he fuses the notion of nature with\nthat of grace: all natures are theophanies, divine manifestations, so\nGod is the source of both dona (gifts of grace)\nand data (what are given in nature), both are revelations of\nthe divine nature. Indeed, there are many places where Eriugena cites\ntexts (e.g., Maximus) to suggest that God and man mirror each\nother. His translation of Maximus includes the proposition: “For\nthey say that man and God are paradigms of each other”\n(Dicunt enim inter se invicem paradigmata Deum et hominem, PL\n122: 1220a). One is at the heart of the other. Similarly, human nature\nand the angelic nature are mutually mirroring. This notion of the\nintertwining and merging of minds is at the very core of\nEriugena’s mysticism and of his understanding of the relation\nbetween human and divine natures and their coming together in the\nperson of Christ. Christ is actually what all human beings can become\nand that is precisely the promise of salvation for Eriugena. Consider\nthe following passage from Book Two: \nFor if Christ Who understands of all things, (Who) indeed is the\nunderstanding of all things, really unified all that He assumed, who\ndoubts then that what first took place in the Head and principal\nExemplar of the whole of human nature will eventually happen in the\nwhole? (Periphyseon, II.545a) \nEriugena articulates the view that God’s becoming human (His\nincarnation or inhumanisation) is balanced cosmologically by the human being\nbecoming divinized in deification (deificatio, Greek:\ntheosis). The phrase “God was made man so that man\ncould be made God” (Latin: factus est Deus homo, ut homo\nfieret Deus) is a commonplace among the Christian Fathers,\nespecially in the Eastern tradition. It is to be found in Greek in St.\nIrenaeus, in St. Athanasius (298–373) in his treatise De\nincarnatione 54, 3 (PG 25: 192B); and, in Latin, in St.\nAugustine, (e.g., his sermon In natali Domini, VIII, PL 38:\n1009 footnote; and In natali Domini, XII, PL 39: 1997) and\nelsewhere. There are several passages where Eriugena (following St.\nAugustine and Maximus Confessor) balances the humanization/incarnation\nof God with the deification of man (see for instance his\nHomilia XXIII, PL 122: 296a–c; Commentarius in\nEvangelium Iohannis I, xxiv, PL 122: 300a). It is often expressed\nin terms of man becoming “by grace” (per gratiam)\nwhat God is “by nature” (per naturam). Eriugena\nfollows the Greek formulation of the Council of Nicaea (NB: not the\nLatin version) and the Greek Christian tradition (specifically Maximus\nConfessor) in occasionally distinguishing between inhumanatio\n(Greek: enanthropesis)—the relation between the Second\nPerson of the Trinity and human nature)—and incarnatio\n(Greek: ενσάρκωση)—the temporal becoming flesh of the\nVerbum in Jesus (see for instance Periphyseon I.449b; and\nHomilia XIX, PL 122: 294c). Eriugena refers to the\ntheosis or deification of human nature at\nPeriphyseon I.449b (and elsewhere, see Periphyseon,\nIV.743a, IV.760d) and draws extensively on Maximus for the view that\nthere will be a reunification of human nature with the divine (see\nPeriphyseon, II.536d ff). In his Homilia Eriugena\nwrites: “Of deification, however, I say, that man and God are\nunited in the unity of the one substance” (Deificationis\nautem, dico, qua homo et deus in unitatem unius substantiae adunati\nsunt, PL 122: 296c). \nThis clearly implies that humanity as a whole, that is, resurrected\nhuman nature in its perfected state, will be truly illuminated and\nmerged with the divine, for human nature itself in its true essence is\nthe intellectus omnium. Furthermore, the use of the future\ntense here is somewhat misleading, since time itself is a function of\nour fallen state and the perfected state is timeless so there is a\nsense in which perfected human nature already is one with God and\nalways has been one with God. Eriugena, then, has a dialectical\nunderstanding of the relation of God and man which can be viewed as\northodox from one point of view, but which is always transgressing the\nboundaries of orthodoxy in the direction of a view which has God and\nman mutually contemplating themselves and each other, in an endless,\neternal play of theophanies. Thus, a kind of mystical humanism is\ncelebrated in Periphyseon Book Four, a humanism unfolded\nthrough the dialectic of self-knowledge and ignorance. \nIn Eriugena’s conceptions of God, the cosmos and human nature,\nthere is an extraordinarily bold emphasis on infinity. God is infinite\nand manifests Himself infinitely in His theophanies; the causes\nthemselves are infinite; the created cosmos too would be infinite were\nit not for the Fall; finally, human nature is essentially unbounded\nand infinite. The Holy Scriptures too have a kind of infinite\nrichness: Sacrae scripturae interpretatio infinita est,\nII.560a. Employing an original simile, Eriugena claims that the number\nof interpretations of Holy Scripture is like the innumerable colors in\na peacock’s tail (IV.749c). Human understanding and learning are\nalso endless. Eriugena emphasizes the lack of limit and inherent\ntranscendence not just of human nature but also of the whole of\nnature. Nature as a whole is an infinite series of theophanies. This\nconception of God as “more than infinite” and as the\n“infinity of infinities” is Eriugena’s most\nsignificant contribution to philosophy, one that attracted both the\nattention of medieval mystics and later of German Idealists. \nEriugena’s Periphyseon had immediate influence in\nFrance, notably at the schools of Laon, Auxerre, and Corbie. His\ntranslations of Pseudo-Dionysius were widely used from the time of\nAnastasius until they were gradually replaced in the thirteenth\ncentury by those of Johannes Sarracenus. His Homily on the\nPrologue to John (albeit often attributed to Origen) circulated\nwidely through the Middle Ages. The Periphyseon became\nparticularly popular in the twelfth century, especially when\ncirculated in the “edition” of William of Malmsebury or in\nthe paraphrase by Honorius Augustodunensis known as Clavis\nphysicae. Hugh of Saint Victor, Alanus of Lille, and Suger of\nSaint-Denis were among those influenced by Eriugena. In the thirteenth\ncentury, however, the Periphyseon was linked with the\nwritings of David of Dinant and Amaury of Bène, two theologians\nat the University of Paris, and was condemned with them in 1210 and\n1225. According to Thomas Aquinas (ST I.3.8; SCG I.17; I.26), Amaury\nof Bène was condemned for saying that God is the formal principle of\nall things, an accusation of pantheism, which recalled\nEriugena’s statement that God is the “form of all\nthings” (forma omnium). David of Dinant (fl.\n1210), on the other hand, was supposed to have identified God with\nprime matter and proclaimed that God was the materia omnium.\nIt is likely that Eriugena’s discussion of God and matter as\n“nothing”, and as both transcending sense and intellect\naccording to the first mode of being and non-being, contributed to\nthis accusation. \nIn the later Middle Ages both Meister Eckhart of Hochheim\n(c.1260–c.1328) and Nicholas of Cusa (1401–64) were\nsympathetic to Eriugena and familiar with his Periphyseon.\nCusanus owned a copy of the Periphyseon. Interest in Eriugena\nwas revived by Thomas Gale’s first printed edition of 1687.\nHowever, soon afterwards, Thomas Gale’s first printed edition,\nthe Periphyseon, was listed in the first edition of the\nIndex Librorum Prohibitorum, and remained on it, until the\nIndex itself was abolished in the 1960s. In the nineteenth century,\nHegel and his followers, interested in the history of philosophy from\na systematic point of view, read Eriugena rather uncritically as an\nabsolute idealist and as the father of German idealism. The first\ncritical editions of his major works were not produced until the\ntwentieth century (Lutz, Jeauneau, Barbet). A conference organized by\nJohn O’Meara and Ludwig Bieler in the Royal Irish Academy,\nDublin, in 1970 led to the founding of the Society for the Promotion\nof Eriugenian Studies (SPES) which has been active in developing\nEriugena studies at a high scholarly level by hosting international\ncolloquia and publishing the proceedings. The most recent meeting of\nSPES, “Eriugena and Creation” took place at the University\nof Chicago in 2011 (Otten &Allen 2014). \nEriugena is an original philosopher who articulates the relation\nbetween God and creation in a manner which preserves both divine\ntranscendence and omnipresence. His theory of human nature is\nrationalist and intellectualist but also apophatic. His theory of\nplace and time as defining structures of the mind anticipates Kant,\nhis dialectical reasoning prefigures Hegel. But above all, Eriugena is\na mystic who emphasizes the ultimate unity of human nature and through it of the entire creation with God.","contact.mail":"dermot.moran@ucd.ie","contact.domain":"ucd.ie"},{"date.published":"2003-08-28","date.changed":"2019-10-30","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/","author1":"Dermot Moran","author2":"Adrian Guiu","author1.info":"http://www.ucd.ie/research/people/philosophy/professordermotmoran/","entry":"scottus-eriugena","body.text":"\n\n\nJohannes (c.800–c.877), who signed himself as\n“Eriugena” in one manuscript, and who was referred to by\nhis contemporaries as “the Irishman”\n(scottus—in the ninth century Ireland was referred to\nas “Scotia Maior” and its inhabitants as\n“scotti”) is the most significant Irish\nintellectual of the early monastic period. He is generally recognized\nto be both the most outstanding philosopher (in terms of originality)\nof the Carolingian era and of the whole period of Latin philosophy\nstretching from Boethius to Anselm. Eriugena is, also, though this\nparallel remains to be explored, more or less a contemporary of the\nArab Neoplatonist Al-Kindi. Since the seventeenth century, it has\nbecome usual to refer to this Irish philosopher as John Scottus (or\n“Scotus”) Eriugena to distinguish him from the\nthirteenth-century\n John Duns Scotus (see entry).\n \n\nEriugena’s uniqueness lies in the fact that, quite remarkably\nfor a scholar in Western Europe in the Carolingian era, he had\nconsiderable familiarity with the Greek language, affording him access\nto the Greek Christian theological tradition, from the Cappadocians to\nGregory of Nyssa, hitherto almost entirely unknown in the Latin West.\nHe also produced a complete, if somewhat imperfect, Latin translation\nof the Corpus Dionysii, the works of the obscure, possibly\nSyrian, Christian Neoplatonist, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a\nfollower of Proclus. In addition, Eriugena translated Gregory of\nNyssa’s De hominis opificio and Maximus\nConfessor’s Ambigua ad Iohannem, and possibly other\nworks, such as Epiphanius’ Anchoratus.\n\n\nEriugena’s thought is best understood as a sustained attempt to\ncreate a consistent, systematic, Christian Neoplatonism from diverse\nbut primarily Christian sources. Eriugena had a unique gift for\nidentifying the underlying intellectual framework, broadly Neoplatonic\nbut also deeply Christian, assumed by the writers of the Christian\nEast. Drawing especially on Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Pseudo-Dionysius\nthe Areopagite, Maximus Confessor, as well as on the more familiar\nauthorities (auctores) of the Latin West (e.g., Cicero, Augustine, Macrobius,\nMartianus Capella, Boethius), he developed a highly\noriginal cosmology, where the highest principle, “the immovable\nself-identical one” (unum et idipsum immobile,\nPeriphyseon, Patrologia Latina 122: 476b), engenders all\nthings and retrieves them back into itself. Contrary to what some\nearlier commentators supposed, it is most unlikely that Eriugena had\ndirect knowledge of the original texts of Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus,\nor other pagan Neoplatonists, but he did have some direct knowledge of\nPlato (a portion of Timaeus in the translation of Calcidius)\nas well as familiarity with the pseudo-Augustinian Categoriae\ndecem.\n\n\nOverall, Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which\nthe infinite, transcendent, and “unknown” God, who is\nbeyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation,\nprocession, or “self-creation”, proceeds from his divine\n“darkness” or “non-being” into the light of\nbeing, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same\ntimeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation.\nThese causes in turn proceed into their Created Effects and as such\nare creatures entirely dependent on, and will ultimately return to,\ntheir sources, which are the Causes or Ideas in God. These Causes,\nconsidered as diverse and infinite in themselves, are actually one\nsingle principle in the divine One. The whole of reality or nature, is\ninvolved in a dynamic process of outgoing (exitus) from and\nreturn (reditus) to the One. God is the One or the Good or\nthe highest principle, which transcends all, and which therefore may\nbe said to be “the non-being that transcends being”. In an\noriginal departure from traditional Neoplatonism, in his dialogue\nPeriphyseon, this first and highest cosmic principle is\ncalled “nature” (natura) and is said to include\nboth God and creation.\n\n\nNature is defined as universitas rerum, the “totality\nof all things”, and includes both the things which are (ea\nquae sunt) as well as those which are not (ea quae non\nsunt). This divine nature may be divided into a set of four\n“species” or “divisions” (divisiones)\nwhich nevertheless retain their unity with their source. These four\ndivisions of nature taken together are to be understood as God,\npresented as the “Beginning, Middle, and End of all\nthings”.\n\n\nApart from having a minor influence in France in the ninth century,\nEriugena’s cosmological speculations appear too conceptually\nadvanced for the philosophers and theologians of his time, and his\nphilosophical system was generally neglected in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies. His main work, Periphyseon, was revived by\ntwelfth-century Neoplatonists, and also circulated in a compendium,\nClavis Physicae (The Key of Nature) of Honorius\nAugustodunensis. The Periphyseon was popular among the\nphilosophers of Chartres and St. Victor (e.g., Hugh of St. Victor\nrefers to it) but was condemned in the thirteenth century, alongside\nthe writings of David of Dinant and Amaury of Bène, for\npromoting the identity of God and creation. In the fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries, Eriugena continued to have a relatively\nclandestine but still important influence on Christian Neoplatonists\nsuch as Meister Eckhart and especially Nicholas of Cusa. The first\nprinted editions of his works appeared in the seventeenth century, but\nit was not until the nineteenth century that interest in him was\nrevived, especially among followers of Hegel who saw Eriugena as a\nforerunner to speculative idealism, as a “Proclus of the\nWest” (Hauréau, 1872) and the “Father of\nSpeculative Philosophy” (Huber, 1861).  The first truly\nscholarly attempt to establish the facts of his life, his works and\ninfluence was by the Belgian scholar Maiul Cappuyns, whose 1933\nwork Jean Scot Erigène: sa vie, son oeuvre, sa\npensée is still reliable. Many valuable twentieth-century\nstudies (e.g., Contreni, 1992; Marenbon, 1981, 2006; Schrimpf, 1982;\nO’Meara, 1969, 1988) have explored Eriugena’s Carolingian\nbackground and continuity with Latin authors. However, systematic\nstudies of his thought (Beierwaltes, 1980, 1987, 1990; Gersh, 1978,\n2006; Moran, 1989, 1999) have also recognized him as a highly original\nmetaphysician and speculative thinker of the first rank whose work\ntranscends the limitations of his age and mode of expression.\n\nNothing is known about Eriugena’s place or date of birth or of\nthe circumstances of his early life, but, on the basis of\ncircumstantial evidence and some surviving testimonia\n(helpfully gathered in Brennan 1986), it is conjectured that he was\nborn in Ireland around 800 or possibly slightly earlier (c. 790). His\nIrish provenance is confirmed by the fact that he self-consciously\nsigned his translation of Pseudo-Dionysius’ works with the\nneologism “Eriugena” (Patrologia Latina,\nhereafter PL, 122: 1236a) meaning “Irish born”, a word\npossibly modelled on the Virgilian “Graiugena”\n(Aeneid 3.550, see Heyworth & Morwood, 2017: 223).\nThe word “Eriugena”\nbecame corrupted to “Erigena” in twelfth century library\nentries (e.g., the Cluny catalogue) and by the seventeenth century it\nbecame common to refer to him as “John Scot(t)us Erigena”\n(e.g., by Bishop Ussher and Thomas Gale). A scattering of Old Irish\nwords used to explain difficult or recondite Latin terms, in his\nBiblical glosses (Glossae; see edition by Contreni &\nÓ Néill, 1997), is further evidence of his Irish origin\nand of the presence of Irish students in his audience (since the time\nof Charlemagne Irish scholars had constituted a considerable presence\nin the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their\nlearning). \nEriugena’s first certain appearance in historical records occurs\naround 850/1 where mention is made, in a letter by Bishop Pardulus of\nLaon, of “a certain Irishman, named Johannes, who is at the\npalace of the king” (“Scotum illum qui est in palatio\nregis, joannem nomine”, Epistola ad ecclesiam\nLugdunensem, in De tribus epistolis, PL 121: 1052a), who\nwas engaged in a theological controversy with Gottschalk of Fulda. It\nis also certain that Johannes had been installed for some time at the\ncourt of Charles the Bald, the West Frankish king, but he was also\nassociated with other ecclesiastical centers, including Rheims, Laon,\nSoissons, and Compigne. There is no direct evidence that he was a monk\nor cleric (he refers to his “frater in Christo”\n[“brother in Christ”], Periphyseon, PL 122:\n1022a, Wulfad, who later became a bishop, but this appellation does\nnot definitively confirm Eriugena’s own church status). \nEriugena had a justified reputation among his contemporaries as a man\nof considerable learning. Florus calls him scholasticus et\neruditus (PL 119: 103a) and Anastasius, the Vatican librarian of\nthe day, marveled at the fact that this “barbarian”\n(vir barbarus) from a remote land knew Greek? (Brennan, 1986)\nTwo partial commentaries (c.\n840–c.850) on De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii\n[The Marriage of Philolology and Mercury], the liberal arts\nhandbook of the late Latin author, Martianus Capella, survive from\nEriugena’s period as royal master, as well as the Biblical\nglosses, Glossae Divinae Historiae, all of which attest to\nhis skill as a grammaticus. Eriugena has a rich and eclectic\nknowledge of the liberal arts tradition, including Isidore,\nCassiodorus, and Cicero. He had a reputation for dialectic, as his\nopponents recognized when they criticized him for bringing his\ndialectical skills to bear on theological discussion. Thus, his critic\nPrudentius remarked: “Your Capella has led you into a labyrinth,\nbecause you have tied yourself more to the meditation of his work than\nto the truth of the Gospel” (PL 115: 1294a). Nevertheless, Eriugena continues the approach of Alcuin to make the arts more\nthan mere instruments but to connect them to wisdom and to point to\nthe unity of knowledge; thus He is both a contributor and a catalyst for the “new wave”\nunleashed by the adoption of Priscian and Martianus Capella (see\nContreni, 1992)  \n\nThe Martianus commentary is most famous for its apparent espousal of a\nnon-Ptolemaic account of the movement of the planets in Book Seven on\nastronomy. Pierre Duhem (1958) thought that Eriugena was offering a\nversion of the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe, and in fact\nEriugena is correctly reporting Martianus’ account which seems\nto be a version of Heraclides of Pontus’ theory. Indeed,\nCopernicus would later single out Martianus for praise for his theory\nthat Mercury and Venus orbit the sun instead of the earth. Eriugena\nwent further than Martianus in placing Mars and Jupiter in orbit\naround the sun also. \nThe influence of Eriugena is difficult to gauge but the echoes are\nunmistakable among his immediate posterity among the Carolingians such\nas Heiric of Auxerre (841–c.880), Almann of Hautvillers (active\nc.865–c.875), and perhaps Hucbald of Saint-Amand (c.\n840/850–930) (see Contreni, 1992). \nEriugena first came to historical notice when he was commissioned by\ntwo French bishops—Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims and Bishop\nPardulus of Laon—to refute a treatise by a Saxon monk,\nGottschalk (806–68), a priest of Orbais in the diocese of\nSoissons, who interpreted St. Augustine as teaching a\n“twofold” or “twin predestination” (gemina\npraedestinatio) of the elect to heaven and of the damned to hell,\nbased on the opinion of St. Isidore, Sententiae II, 6, I (PL\n83: 606a). Gottschalk had already been condemned by a synod at Mainz\nin 848 and another at Quierzy in 849 and had been imprisoned in the\nabbey of Hautvillers (where he remained until his death in 868), but\nPrudentius, the bishop of Troyes, appeared to side with him. Hincmar\nwas worried that Gottschalk’s side was attracting powerful\nsupporters and he engaged Eriugena to write a strong rebuttal.\nEriugena’s response, De divina praedestinatione (On\nDivine Predestination, c. 851, see Madec edition, 1978), a\ntreatise of nineteen chapters, which survives in a single manuscript,\nis a robust rebuttal of Gottschalk. Eriugena rejects any divine\npredestination to evil by an appeal to God’s unity,\ntranscendence, and goodness. While purporting merely to interpret\nAugustinian texts, this early theological treatise is philosophically\nsignificant for its rationalistic, dialectical analysis of key\ntheological concepts and its reliance on argument rather than\nscriptural citation. In this treatise, Eriugena, citing\nAugustine’s De uera religione 5.8, PL 34: 126, claims\n“that true philosophy is true religion and conversely that true\nreligion is true philosophy”. As one gloss in the\nAnnotationes in Marcianum attests: “no one enters\nheaven except through philosophy” (nemo intrat in celum nisi\nper philosophiam, Annotationes 57.15, AM: 64). Eriugena\nthen argues that philosophy has four principal parts—division,\ndefinition, demonstration, and resolution—and the pursuit of\nthis fourfold method of reasoning will lead to truth. This focus on\ndialectic as the path to truth is a constant theme of Eriugena’s\nphilosophy, one recognized by his contemporaries. \nEriugena argues in De divina praedestinatione that God, being\nperfectly good, wants all humans to be saved, and does not predestine\nsouls to damnation. God’s being is His willing and “no\nnecessity binds the will of God”. On the contrary, humans damn\nthemselves through their own free choices: “Sin, death,\nunhappiness are not from God”. Since God is outside time, He\ncannot be said to fore-know or to pre-destine, terms\nthat involve temporal predicates. Furthermore, if God’s being is\nHis wisdom, God can be said to have but a single knowledge and hence a\n“double” predestination cannot be ascribed to Him. Human\nnature, on the other hand, was created rational, and rationality\nrequires freedom. Human nature is therefore essentially free:\n“For God did not create in man a captive will but a free one,\nand that freedom remained after sin”\n(De divina praedestinatione, 4.6).\n \nIn the course of his diatribe against the “ravings” of\nGottschalk, Eriugena locates his opponent’s heresy as midway\nbetween the heresy of Pelagius, which rejects the power of grace, and\nthe opposing heresy, which denies the possibility of human freedom.\nIronically, Eriugena himself would in turn be accused of\n“Origenism” and “Pelagianism” by\nGottschalk’s advocate, Bishop Prudentius of Troyes (see the\nlatter’s De Praedestinatione, PL 115: 1010c), due to\nhis perceived emphasis on human free-will in the salvific process.\nPrudentius, an erstwhile admirer of Scottus, published an opposing\ntreatise, which, while acknowledging his “Irish eloquence”\n(Celtica eloquentia, PL 115: 1194a), dismisses\nEriugena’s reasoning as confused and not based on sound\nknowledge of scripture. Florus too attacked Eriugena. Subsequently,\nOn Divine Predestination was condemned by the bishops in\nFrance at the councils of Valence (855) and Langres (859), in part for\nits over-use of logical method or dialectic (dialectica). The\nphrase “Irish porridge” (pultes scottorum),\nrecalling Jerome’s sneer against Pelagius, is used in these\nofficial denunciations. \nDespite the official ecclesiastical condemnations of On\nPredestination, for reasons that are not known but are presumed\nto be political, Eriugena continued to have the protection and\npatronage of King Charles the Bald, who, around 860, invited him to\ntranslate the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a\nmysterious Christian Neoplatonist who purported to be Dionysius, the\nfirst convert of St. Paul at Athens, but was more likely a late fifth\nor early sixth-century Christian follower of Proclus. The Corpus\nDionysii had been given a gift to Charles the Bald’s\nfather, Louis the Pious, from the Byzantine Emperor Michael the\nStammerer in 827, a gift thought appropriate possibly because of a\nmisidentification of Pseudo-Dionysius with the patron saint of France,\nSt. Denis. Hilduin had attempted an earlier translation in\n832–5, but Eriugena’s version was most successful and\nremained in circulation until the thirteenth century when Jean\nSarrazin’s translation replaced it. Indeed, Eriugena’s\ntranslation was utilized by the Vatican Librarian Anastasius, who\nadded scholia to it. Anastasius decried the word-for-word translation,\nhowever he contributed to it, thereby indicating its importance\n(Harrington, 2004). \nSoon after completing his translation of Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 862), he\nwent on to translate other Greek Christian texts: he translates\nMaximus Confessors’ Ambigua ad Ioannem and then his\nQuaestiones ad Thalassium; Gregory of Nyssa’s De\nhominis opificio, under the title of De imagine and\npossibly Epiphanius’ Anchoratus de Fide. Eriugena also\nwrote a long commentary on Pseudo-Dionysius’ Celestial\nHierarchy (Expositiones in hierarchiam coelestem). It is possible he made\nother translations which have not survived or which cannot be\ndefinitively attributed to him, e.g., Boethius’ De\nmusica. \nEriugena’s major work, the Periphyseon, also titled in\nsome manuscripts, De divisione naturae (On the Division of\nNature), is a long dialogue between a “teacher” (Nutritor) and a “student”\n(Alumnus), was probably begun in the early 860s, just after he had\ncompleted the Pseudo-Dionysius translation, and finished around 867\n(the date Wulfad, to whom the work is dedicated, became bishop, making\nit unlikely that Eriugena would have referred to him as\nfrater, brother, after his consecration as bishop). The first\nprinted edition of this dialogue appeared in 1681 and subsequently an\nedition by Floss appeared in 1853 which is now contained in PL 122.\nInglis Patrick Sheldon-Williams (1908–1973) began a new edition\nof Periphyseon with the publication of his text and\ntranslation of Book One in 1968 in the Scriptores Latini\nHiberniae series of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies,\nfollowed soon after by his edition of Periphyseon Book Two in\n1970, and Book Three, published after Sheldon-Williams’ death,\nin the same series in 1981, seen through the press by the late John J.\nO’Meara. Sheldon-Williams had assembled materials for the\nedition of Books Four and Five and had completed a draft English\ntranslation of these books, which was published separately in one\nvolume edited by John J. O’Meara. O’Meara and\nÉdouard Jeauneau continued the edition of Sheldon-Williams,\nbringing out Book Four in the same series in 1995. Book Five, edited\nby Mark Zier, is scheduled to appear shortly in the Scriptores\nLatini Hiberniae series. However, due to some deficiencies in\nSheldon-Williams’ manner of editing, and his mistaken conception\nof the manuscript tree, Jeauneau has undertaken an entirely new\ncritical edition of the Periphyseon for the Corpus\nChristianorum Continuatio Mediaevalis series. All five books of\nthe Periphyseon have appeared in this series.\nSheldon-Williams was of the opinion that Periphyseon Book One\nhad emerged from an earlier “essay in dialectic”, but\noffered no evidence for this interpretation, which takes an overly\nrestrictive view of the first book of the dialogue. The main weakness\nof Sheldon-Williams’ editing strategy was that it had conflated\nvarious versions of the text drawn from several different manuscripts\ninto a single composite script, in a similar manner to the earlier\neditors, Thomas Gale in 1681 and H.-J. Floss in 1853. Gale and Floss\nhad published editions that combined into a single text both the text\nof the main body of the manuscript and the various marginal\nannotations in different hands. This composite version disguised the\ngradual evolution of the text and Jeauneau is of the opinion that this\nmixed type of edition is inadequate to the needs of scholarship. The\nnew Jeauneau edition is based on six manuscripts, including two\nmanuscripts, Paris Bibl. nat. lat. 12965 and Bamberg Phil. 2/2, not\nused by Sheldon-Williams since they contained only Books Four and\nFive. Jeauneau has suggested that the extant manuscripts of the\nPeriphyseon show four distinct levels of development, that\nis, four early “editions”. One special difficulty in\nediting the Periphyseon is that the earliest manuscripts\npreserve only the first three books whereas the extant manuscripts for\nBooks Four and Five date from the twelfth century. Avranches and\nCambridge, both twelfth century manuscripts, are the sole witnesses\nfor the end of Book Four and the whole of Book Five in Stage Two\nversions, with Avranches noticeably less accurate than Cambridge in\nseveral places. \nA fragmentary Commentary on the Gospel of St. John\n(Commentarius in Evangelium Iohannis) and a sermon\n(Homilia in Johannem) on the Prologue to St. John’s\nGospel were also written probably in the late 860s or 870s. A number\nof interesting poems (Carmina) survive which show the breadth of\nEriugena’s learning; but also portray him as a courtier quite\nwell versed in political affairs. Some poems are written specifically\nin praise of the king, including an important poem, Aulae\nsidereae [Starry Halls] which appears to celebrate the dedication\nof Charles the Bald’s new church in Compigne on 1 May 875. The\npoems show Eriugena’s fascination with Greek and some poems are\nactually written entirely in Greek; and the poems are probably the\nmost Maximean in character through their cosmic Christology. It is\nprobable that Eriugena died sometime around 877. An apocryphal tale,\ndating from the twelfth century, records that Eriugena was stabbed to\ndeath by his students with their pens! \nDespite the claims of some nineteenth-century commentators, it is now\nclear that Eriugena did not have direct knowledge of the writings of\nPlotinus, Porphyry, or Proclus. He had almost no contact with pagan\nNeoplatonism in general (apart possibly from Priscianus Lydus and\nCalcidius’ translation of the Timaeus). His familiarity\nwith Aristotle was also indirect—through the anonymous but\nwidely circulated compilation, Categoriae decem, the\nPseudo-Augustinian paraphrase of Aristotle’s\nCategories. He knew Boethius’ trinitarian tracts\n(Opuscula sacra) and possibly the Consolation of\nPhilosophy, since a set of glosses on this work may be in\nEriugena’s hand (although this is disputed). His chief\nauthorities in the Latin Christian Tradition were the works of the\nFathers, chiefly Augustine (especially his De Genesi ad\nlitteram), Ambrose, Hilary of Poitiers, and Jerome. His\noriginality is largely due to the manner in which he assimilated\n(often translating) the Neoplatonic thought of Eastern Christian\nwriters such as the Cappadocians, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa,\nGregory Nazianzus, as well as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and\nMaximus Confessor. He also was familiar with Rufinus’ Latin\ntranslation of Origen’s On First Principles and was\noften linked with Origen in medieval times. Though he took the view\nthat the authorities of East and West were not in conflict,\nnevertheless he usually expressed a preference for the Eastern Church\nFathers. An especially important authority was Maximus Confessor,\nwhose account of the return of all things Eriugena copiously\nborrowed. \nEriugena’s exceptional learning would be sufficient to\ndistinguish him from contemporary Carolingian scholars, such as Alcuin\nand Sedulius Scottus; but his true and lasting genius lay in his\nability to combine elements from these auctores into a new\ncosmological framework which is rationally argued to the highest\ndegree. Eriugena enthusiastically incorporated many Greek Christian\ntheological concepts: God, the One, creates by self-emanation;\ncreation is a timeless, and hence on-going and always contemporary,\nevent; human nature is originally a Platonic Idea in the mind of God;\nhuman nature is a certain intellectual concept formed eternally in the\nmind of God, Periphyseon, IV.768b). Humans fail to understand\ntheir true nature as image of God in God, because they are distracted\nby created, fleeting temporal “appearances”\n(phantasiai), which entrap the intellect in the clouded\nspatio-temporal realm of sense. However, through intellectual\ncontemplation (theoria, intellectus) and divine illumination\n(which is the receiving of a divine self-manifestation,\ntheophania), humans may achieve unification\n(henosis) with God, and the select few will even undergo\n“deification” (deificatio, theosis) which\nEriugena interprets as complete identity with God. \nIn his discussion of this cosmological saga, Eriugena always appeals\nto dialectic and the order of reasons in order to mediate between the\nvarious sources. For Eriugena, true philosophy is vera ratio\nand indeed, all appeal to authority is nothing other than an appeal to\nright reason (Periphyseon, I.511b). Vera ratio\nunderlies both the cosmos and reason. Eriugena is therefore a strongly\nrationalistic (in the Medieval sense of the word) philosopher,\nattempting to make sense of divine revelation in scripture and nature\nin terms consistent with the evidence of reason based on the rules of\nDialectic. Dialectic, moreover, is not just about the organization of\nwords and thoughts but also describes the structure of reality itself.\nThus, in the Periphyseon IV.781c–d, he makes the bold\nclaim that one need only introduce the “opinions of the holy\nFathers” where  \nthe gravest necessity requires that human reason be supported for the\nsake of those who, being untrained in it, are more amenable to\nauthority than reason. \nThe encounter with the Greek fathers and especially with Maximus\nConfessor has proven crucial for Eriugena’s own thinking but\nalso for the development of intellectual history in Western Europe;\nEriugena was not only a translator or synthesizer but someone who\nappropriates creatively and constructively. The only other comparable\nprecedent is Anicius Boethius’  grand project of translating the\ncorpus of Aristotle and of Plato; the only difference is that Eriugena\nactually carries out his translation project: besides the Corpus\nDionysiacum, he translates Gregory of Nyssa’s De\nOpificio Hominis (which he calls De Imagine) and parts,\nif not the entire, homilies on the Hexaemeron of Basil the\nGreat; above all, Eriugena translates a great part of the Maximian\ncorpus: the entire Questiones ad Thalassium and great parts\nof the Ambigua ad Iohannem. \nThese translations and the ideas about creation and nature,\nanthropology, philosophy and theology encountered in Eriugena’s\nwritings will constitute an important undercurrent which will inform\nand influence many thinkers in Western thought (see below\n Section 4 on Influence). \nDionysius is the formative influence on Eriugena; it is through him\nthat he first drinks from the “sacred nectar of the\nGreeks”. The discovery of Dionysius had a profound effect on\nEriugena’s thinking. He enthusiastically adopted the\nAreopagite’s main ideas (many of which appear to be drawn from\nProclus’ Commentary on the Parmenides),\ne.g., the distinction between\naffirmative (kataphatic) and negative theology (apophatic), according\nto which denials concerning God (e.g., “God is not good [in the\nway we know goodness]”) are “more true”,\n(verior) “better”, “more apt”, than\naffirmations (“God is good”), as well as the analysis of\nthe divine names as applying only metaphorically\n(metaphorice, transferre, per metaphoram)\nand not literally (proprie) to God, who is\n“beyond all that is”. For Pseudo-Dionysius, we do not know\nGod directly but know Him only through his theophaniai, or\ndivine appearances (Pseudo-Dionysius, Divine Names, ch. 7, PG\n3: 869c–d). We could, through affirmative theology, ascribe\nattributes to God, because He is the “cause of all”\n(aitia panton, Mystical Theology, ch. 2, PG 3:\n1000b), but in fact God in His nature is transcendent and\n“unknowable”, he is the “more-than-divine\ndivinity”, which Eriugena renders as superdeus deitas\nin his translation (PL 122: 1121c). Pseudo-Dionysius claims that God\nis the affirmation of all things, the negation of all things, and\nbeyond all affirmation and denial (in Eriugena’s translation:\nGod is omnium positio, omnium ablatio, super omnem positionem et\nablationem inter se invicem, PL 122: 1121c-d). \nEriugena’s view of the cosmos as holy order (hierarchia) where\nmediation (medietas) is realized through theophanies (theophaniai) is mostly derived from Dionysius; by\ncontemplating (theoria) this order, the human being can\nreturn to its divine source through the mediation of these theophanies; Eriugena expands this idea by finding a correlation between theophanies and\nMaximus’ logoi (as the reasons and principles of all created beings) and Augustine’s seminal reasons; he then brings all these aspects together into the framework of cosmic Christology, inspired by Maximus, in which the human being is\nco-participant in the redemption of creation. \nAlthough he has recourse to Maximus Confessor hoping that he might offer some\nclarifications for understanding Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus will offer\nEriugena much more: a trove of ideas, methods, and philosophical\nvocabulary. Thus, Maximus allows him to expand and clarify the\ninsights received from Dionysius and provides him with an eclectic\nphilosophical and theological vocabulary: the Maximian oeuvre offers a\npalimpsest of Neo-Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophical terms and\nconcepts along with a rich theological vocabulary which is mostly a\nsynthesis of terms and concepts derived from Pseudo-Dionysius and the\nCappadocian Fathers (Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Basil\nthe Great). \nThe very method of the Periphyseon, which employs natural\nphilosophy and exegesis of the Bible interchangeably, in order to contemplate and\n“read” the two “books” (creation and\nScripture) in which the divine signs (theophanies) are manifested, can be\ntraced back to Maximus’  notion of knowledge as contemplation of\nnature (theoria physikè). If contemplated and read\nfrom the right perspective, scripture and creation become transparent\nto divine presence. \nEriugena adopts the cosmological framework of Maximus’ \nChristian Neoplatonism: the cosmic movement of exitus becomes\nthe incarnation, the mystery of Christ becoming man; reditus,\nthe return of all beings to their source, coincides with deification,\nhumans ascending to God through deification\n(θέωσις). Eriugena will go\nfurther and correlate these cosmic movements with the two main\noperations of dialectic: division and analysis; this allows him to\nconstruct a deep correspondence between epistemology and ontology.\nThus, Maximus’  cosmic Christology based on the Logos-logoi ontology, offers Eriugena a framework\nwhich allows him to expand the use of dialectic from mere method \nto a cosmic framework which underlies both epistemology and\nontology. \nMaximus’ understanding of the incarnation as a cosmic event\ninforms Eriugena’s ontology and his notion of theophanic\ncreation; although the notion of theophany is first derived from\nDionysius, it is enhanced through Maximus’ understanding of the\nincarnation of Christ as a cosmic mediation and unification of all\naspects and levels of reality. Through the ideas of Pseudo-Dionysius\nand Maximus, Eriugena overcomes the distrust of visible and material\nnature found in Neoplatonism; rather he believes contemplating the theophanies encountered in nature (which has been redeemed through the incarnation of the Logos) is necessary for the return of creation to its divine source. \nEriugena’s anthropology is based on Maximus’ insight that\nthe human being is a synthesis of all aspects of creation, as he says,\nthe “workshop of creation“ (officina omnium) and as such plays\na crucial role in unifying creation through proper knowledge; the\nentire dialogue of the Periphyseon could be seen as a\nspiritual exercise (exercitatio animi) of training through\nthe liberal arts in order to attain the level of intellectual\nknowledge; the goal of exercitatio is to contemplate nature\nin the right way in order to repair the fragmentation of creation by\nachieving a unified vision and thus realize the return of all things\nto their divine source. The human being as officina omnium\nplays a central role in the process of return (reditus) because as a primordial idea in the divine mind,\nit can mediate between the primordial causes and the created effects.\nHowever, only through the incarnation (in which Christ assumes human\nnature in its totality), can the full, cosmic scope of this process of mediation and unification through the human being as officina omnium be realized: through the incarnation of Christ the Logos, the universal human nature and through it the\nrest of creation is unified, redeemed and ultimately divinized. [see\nalso\n section 3.9 Human Nature] \nThe Periphyseon as a grand dialogue on physiology\n(physiologia is Eriugena’s hybrid science of physics-theology-philosophy)\nstands in continuity with the exercitatio animi and the liberal arts tradition of\nAugustine’s early philosophical dialogues. Eriugena appropriates\nand expands on Augustine’s trust that reason (ratio)\ncan be trained by the liberal arts and can thus contemplate creation.\nAugustine’s intellectualism is crucial for Eriugena’s\nphilosophical anthropology although Eriugena seems to be much more\ntrusting than Augustine in the ability of the human to refashion\nitself through paideia. \nInformed by Dionysius notion of theophanic cosmic order, Eriugena is\nmore comfortable with the complexities of Neoplatonic cosmology and\nwith mediation (medietas) and less preoccupied with the issue\nof divine simplicity. Nevertheless, the Augustinian strain is not lost\nin Eriugena: both the human being and the creation have a Trinitarian\nstructure. Along with Basil the Great, it is Augustine (through his great commentary on Genesis, De Genesi ad litteram) who teaches Eriugena to read and interpret the Hexaemeron (the creation account in Genesis 1) in a more literal and realistic manner and thus to counter-balance the more allegorical reading of Gregory of Nyssa;  Augustine constitutes both a foil and a catalyst for\nEriugena’s thinking; his great challenge in the\nPeriphyseon is trying to reconcile the Augustinian perspective with\nthat of the Eastern thinkers. \nAugustine’s concept of the primordial causes (primordiales\ncausae ) along with Maximus’ concept of logoi\nallow Eriugena to forge a realistic ontology based on intelligible\nspecies of visible things which are immanent in created beings (see\nErismann, 2011). \nEriugena cites almost 25% of Gregory of Nyssa’s De\nImagine—as he refers to the De hominis\nopificio—in the Periphyseon. Gregory of Nyssa’s and\nBasil’s accounts of creation provide the missing pieces, and\ncomplements the cosmology Eriugena derives from the partial Latin\ntranslation of the Timaeus. Basil the Great’s\nHomilies on the Hexaemeron provide him with a model for\nreading Genesis literally. \nGregory of Nyssa’s imago dei anthropology provides the\nscaffolding for Maximus’ understanding of the role and status of\nthe human being. Eriugena extrapolates from both Gregory of\nNazianzus’ view that the essence of God is ineffable and\nultimately beyond definition and from Gregory of Nyssa’s\napophatic anthropology; therefore, both the divine and the human are\nultimately unfathomable and ineffable: as the image of God (imago\ndei), the human being in its essence is as incomprehensible and\nundefinable as God. \nThe idea that the human being is uncircumscribed and indefinable is\nderived from Gregory of Nyssa, and Eriugena connects it with\nMaximus’  officina omnium view of the human being and\nwith Augustine’s Trinitarian theology. \nEriugena’s masterpiece is undoubtedly the Periphyseon\n(written c.862–c.867), a long dialogue in five\nbooks—between an anonymous “teacher”\n(Nutritor) and his “student”\n(Alumnus)—that attempts to be a compendium of all\nknowledge presented within a Neoplatonic cosmology of the procession\nand return of all things from the divine One. \nThe Periphyseon, deeply influenced by Eriugena’s\nengagement with Greek Christian authors, is a work of astonishing\nscope, a veritable Christian Neoplatonic summa. At the\nbeginning of Book Four, Eriugena labels his enterprise a\nphysiologia, a “study of nature”, and indeed one\nmanuscript of the Periphyseon in the British Library in\nLondon calls the whole dialogue “Liber Phisiologiae Iohannis\nScottigenae”. The term “physiologia”\nis apt in that the term “nature” for Eriugena spans the\nwhole cosmological domain, including not just created nature but also\nthe Divine Creator, and treats of the essentially dialectical relation\nbetween Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation\nand creation culminates in return to the divine. Nature is to be\nunderstood as what is real in the widest sense, the totality of all\nthings that are and are not. Nature includes both God and creation and\nhas four divisions: nature which creates and is not created (God),\nnature which creates and is created (the Primordial Causes), nature\nwhich is created and does not create (the Created Temporal Effects),\nand nature which is neither created nor creates (Non-Being). The\noriginal intention (expressed at III.619d–620b) was to devote\none book to each of the four divisions; thus Book One deals with the\ndivine nature and the procession or exitus of all things from\nGod, Book Two treats of the Primordial Causes, and Book Three of their\nCreated Effects, including the nature of ex nihilo creation\nand the stages of the creation of the world. The topic of creation\nrequires Eriugena to address issues related to the Biblical\naccount of creation, and thus, in Book Three, he embarks on his own\nversion of a Hexaemeron. The momentous event of the emergence\nof human nature on the Sixth Day of creation requires extended\ntreatment, and Eriugena is forced to devote a fourth book to this\ntopic, thus relegating the return of all things to God to a fifth\nbook. Thus, Eriugena was forced to depart from his original plan of\nfour books and add a fifth. This change of plan is particularly\nimportant in that it helps to identify different stages of composition\nof the text. \nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the Periphyseon is\nEriugena’s ability to bring together into a symphony of ideas\nsuch a variety of thinkers and sources: the liberal arts and the philosophical dialogue traditions, the officina omnium anthropology of Maximus Confessor, the\ntheophanic ontology of Dionysius the Areopagite, Augustine’s Trinitarian\ntheology, Basil the Great’s realistic hermeneutics of the Hexaemeron, and Gregory\nof Nyssa’s imago dei anthropology and his account of creation; however, we may say\nthat the grand tapestry of the Periphyseon is woven from many\nthreads but the fabric is Maximian. Maximus Confessor’s vision\nprovides the impetus that drives the argument of the dialogue and also\nthe framework in which the encounter and conversation among the\nvarious sources takes place. \nBook One opens abruptly with the claim that “nature”\n(natura), “the general term for all things that are and\nall things that are not”, (I.441a), including both God and\ncreation, is divided into four species. Echoing similar divisions in\nAugustine (De civitate Dei Bk. V. 9, PL 41: 151) and Marius\nVictorinus (Ad Candidum), nature’s four\n“divisions” or “species” are: that which\ncreates and is not created (i.e., God); that which creates and is\ncreated (i.e., Primary Causes or Ideas); that which is created and\ndoes not create (i.e., Temporal Effects, created things); that which\nis neither created nor creates (i.e., non-being, nothingness). The\nfirst species of nature is God, “the cause of all things that\nare and that are not” (I.442b). There are several remarkable\naspects of this division. First of all, division is defined by\nEriugena in De praedestinatione as a branch of dialectic.\nSecondly, the four divisions are not strictly a hierarchy in the usual\nNeoplatonic sense where there are higher and lower orders, rather, as\nEriugena will explain, the first and fourth divisions both refer to\nGod as the Beginning and End of all things, and the second and third\ndivisions may also be thought to express the unity of the cause-effect\nrelation. Finally, the division is an attempt to show that nature is a\ndialectical coming together of being and non-being. Creation is\nnormally understood as coming into being from non-being. God as\ncreator is then a kind of transcendent non-being above the being of\ncreation. These themes are rigorously discussed and disentangled\nthroughout the dialogue. \nImmediately following on his abrupt announcement of the four divisions\nof nature, Eriugena proceeds to list “five ways of\ninterpreting” (quinque modi interpretationis) the\nmanner in which things may be said to be or not to be\n(Periphyseon, I.443c–446a). According to the first\nmode, things accessible to the senses and the intellect are said to\nbe, whereas anything which, “through the excellence of its\nnature” (per excellentiam suae naturae), transcends our\nfaculties are said not to be. According to this classification, God,\nbecause of his transcendence is said not to be. He is\n“nothingness through excellence” (nihil per\nexcellentiam). \nThe second mode of being and non-being is seen in the “orders\nand differences of created natures” (I.444a), whereby, if one\nlevel of nature is said to be, those orders above or below it, are\nsaid not to be: \nFor an affirmation concerning the lower (order) is a negation\nconcerning the higher, and so too a negation concerning the lower\n(order) is an affirmation concerning the higher.\n(Periphyseon, I.444a) \nAccording to this mode, the affirmation of man is the negation of\nangel and vice versa (affirmatio enim hominis negatio est angeli,\nnegatio vero hominis affirmatio est angeli, I.444b). This mode\nillustrates Eriugena’s original way of dissolving the\ntraditional Neoplatonic hierarchy of being into a dialectic of\naffirmation and negation: to assert one level is to deny the others.\nIn other words, a particular level may be affirmed to be real by those\non a lower or on the same level, but the one above it is thought not\nto be real in the same way. If humans are thought to exist in a\ncertain way, then angels do not exist in that way. \nThe third mode (I.444c–445b) contrasts the being of\nactual things with the “non-being” of\npotential or possible things still contained, in\nEriugena’s memorable phrase, “in the most secret folds of\nnature” (in secretissimis naturae sinibus). This mode\ncontrasts things which have come into effect with those things which\nare still contained in their causes. According to this mode, actual\nthings, which are the effects of the causes, have being, whereas those\nthings which are still virtual in the Primary Causes (e.g., the souls\nof those as yet unborn) are said not to be. \nThe fourth mode (I.445b–c) offers a roughly Platonic criterion\nfor being: those things contemplated by the intellect alone (ea\nsolummodo quae solo comprehenduntur intellectu) may be considered\nto be, whereas things caught up in generation and corruption, viz.\nmatter, place and time, do not truly exist. The assumption is that\nthings graspable by intellect alone belong to a realm above the\nmaterial, corporeal world and hence are timeless. \nThe fifth mode offered by Eriugena is essentially theological and\napplies solely to humans: those sanctified by grace are said to be,\nwhereas sinners who have renounced the divine image are said not to\nbe. \nOne of the striking features of this complex—and certainly, in\nthis form, original—account is that being and non-being are\ntreated as correlative categories: something may be said to be under\none mode and not to be under another. Attribution of being is subject\nto the dialectic of affirmation and negation. Eriugena returns in Book\nThree to give a very complex discussion of the meaning of\n“ex nihilo” in the concept of creatio ex\nnihilo, which makes use of some of these modes of being and\nnon-being, and, in general, these modes should be borne in mind when\ninterpreting Eriugena’s more overt metaphysical statements. Thus\nwhen Eriugena calls God “nothing”, he means that God\ntranscends all created being, God is nihil per\nexcellentiam (“nothingness on account of excellence”)\nor, as he puts it, nihil per infinitatem (“nothingness\non account of infinity”). Matter, on the other hand, is also\ncalled “nothing” but it is “nothing through\nprivation” (nihil per privationem). Similarly, created\nthings are called “nothing” because they do not contain in\nthemselves their principles of subsistence (Eriugena is here repeating\nSt. Augustine’s view that the creature, considered apart from\nGod, is mere nothing). \nPeriphyseon Book One examines the first division, God\nunderstood as a transcendent One above, and yet cause of, all\ncreation. God transcends everything; He is, following\nPseudo-Dionysius, the “negation of all things”\n(negatio omnium, III.686d). According to Eriugena—who\nin this respect is following a tradition which includes Augustine and\nBoethius as well as Dionysius and other Greek authors—the\nAristotelian categories are considered to describe only the created\nworld and do not properly apply to God (I.463d). God cannot\n“literally” (proprie) be said to be substance or\nessence (ousia, essentia), nor can He be described in terms\nof quantity, quality, relation, place or time. He is\n“superessentialis” (I.459d), a term which, for\nEriugena, belongs more to negative theology than to affirmative. His\n“being” is “beyond being”. Eriugena\nparticularly admires a Dionysian saying from the Celestial\nHierarchy (CH iv 1; PG 3: 177d1–2): to gar einai panton\nestin he hyper to einai theotes (“for the being of all\nthings is the Divinity above being”, III.686d) which he\ntranslates as esse omnium est superesse divinitatis,\n(“the being of all things is the super-being of divinity”,\nIII.686d, I.443b; see also I.516c; III.644b, V.903c). This is perhaps\nEriugena’s favorite phrase from Dionysius. (Indeed, Maximus\nConfessor had also commented on it in I Ambigua xiii, PG 91:\n1225d, a passage well known to Eriugena who translated the\nAmbigua.) Sometimes, instead of invoking the Dionysian\nformula superesse divinitatis, Eriugena speaks of the\n“divine superessentiality” (divina\nsuperessentialitas, III.634b), or—quoting Divine\nNames I 1–2 (PG 3: 588b–cb)—of the\n“superessential and hidden divinity” (superessentialis\net occulta divinitas, I.510b). \nGod is a “nothingness” (nihilum) whose real\nessence is unknown to all created beings, including the angels (447c).\nIndeed, Eriugena argues in a radical manner, following Maximus\nConfessor, that God’s nature is infinite and uncircumscribable,\nsuch that He is unknown even to Himself, since He is the\n“infinity of infinities” and beyond all comprehension and\ncircumscription. In the Periphyseon, Eriugena repeats the\nposition of the De Praedestinatione that God does not know\nevil, and, in a genuine sense, God may be said not to know anything;\nhis ignorance is the highest wisdom. \nEriugena conceives of the act of creation as a kind of\nself-manifestation wherein the hidden transcendent God creates himself\nby manifesting himself in divine outpourings or theophanies (I.446d).\nHe moves from darkness into the light, from self-ignorance into\nself-knowledge. The divine self-creation or self-manifestation\n(I.455b) is, at the same time (or rather timelessly), the expression\nof the Word (Logos) and hence the creation of all other things, since all\nthings are contained in the Word. The Word enfolds in itself the Ideas\nor Primary Causes of all things and in that sense all things are\nalways already in God: \n…the Creative nature permits nothing outside itself because\noutside it nothing can be, yet everything which it has created and\ncreates it contains within itself, but in such a way that it itself is\nother, because it is superessential, than what it creates within\nitself. (Periphyseon, III.675c) \nGod’s transcendent otherness above creatures is precisely that\nwhich allows creatures to be within God and yet other than God.\nEriugena stresses both the divine transcendence above and immanence in\ncreation. The immanence of God in the world is at the same time the\nimmanence of creatures within God. Creatures however, as fallen, do\nnot yet know that they reside in God. In cosmological terms, however,\nGod and the creature are one and the same: \nIt follows that we ought not to understand God and the creature as two\nthings distinct from one another, but as one and the same. For both\nthe creature, by subsisting, is in God; and God, by manifesting\nhimself, in a marvelous and ineffable manner creates himself in the\ncreature…. (Periphyseon, III.678c) \nElsewhere Eriugena’s asserts that God is the “essence of\nall things” (essentia omnium) and the “form of\nall things” (forma omnium). In the thirteenth century,\nexpressions such as these led to the accusation of heresy, i.e., that\nEriugena is collapsing the difference between God and creation. It\nmust be noted, however, that although Eriugena asserts the identity of\nGod and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the\n“genus” or “whole” (totum) of which\nthe creatures are “species” or “parts”. Only\nmetaphorically (metaforice, translative) can it be\nsaid that God is a “genus” or a “whole”.\nAssertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always\nbalanced in Eriugena’s writings by assertions of God’s\ntranscendence above all things. God is both “form of all\nthings” and also is without form, formless. Since God cannot be\nsaid to be anything, God cannot be simply identified with any or every\ncreature either. \nThe main focus of the Second Book of the Periphyseon is an\nanalysis of what Eriugena terms “the Primary Causes”\n(causae primordiales) which are the patterns of all things\nlocated in the mind of God and function as the timeless and unchanging\ncauses of all created things. This doctrine represents an eclectic\ncombination of various earlier doctrines, including the Platonic\ntheory of Forms or ideai, Dionysius’ discussion of the\ndivine names, and Augustine’s revival of the Stoic notion of\neternal reasons (rationes aeternae). \nGod’s mind, understood as the logos or verbum,\ncontains in one undivided Form all the reasons for every individual\nthing. These reasons (rationes, logoi) are\nproductive of the things of which they are the reasons. Their number\nis infinite and none has priority over the other, e.g., Being is not\nprior to Goodness, or vice-versa. Each is a divine theophany, a way in\nwhich the divine nature is manifested. The very nature of these Causes\nis to flow out from themselves, bringing about their Effects. This\n“outflowing”\n(πρόοδος,\nproodos; processio, exitus) creates the\nwhole universe from the highest genus to the lowest species and\n“individuals” (atoma). In his understanding of\nthis causal procession, Eriugena accepts Neoplatonic principles: like\nproduces like; incorporeal causes produce incorporeal effects; an\neternal cause produces an eternal effect. Since the causes are\nimmaterial, intellectual and eternal, so their created effects are\nessentially incorporeal, immaterial, intellectual, and eternal.\nEriugena, however, thinks of cause and effect as mutually dependent,\nrelative terms (Periphyseon, V. 910d–912b): a cause is not a cause unless it\nproduces an effect, an effect is always the effect of a cause. \nWhat is the ontological status of the created effects? By nature, they\nare eternal and incorruptible, but Eriugena also thinks of individual\ncreated things as located spatially and temporally. He seems to think\nthere are two kinds of time: an unchanging time (a reason or\nratio in the divine mind,Periphyseon, V.906a) and a corrupting time.\nPlace and time are definitions in that they situate or locate the\nthings they define, and since definitions are in the mind, then place\nand time are in the mind (Periphyseon, I.485b). Following Gregory of Nyssa,\nEriugena holds that the sensible, corporeal, spatio-temporal\nappearances of things are produced by the qualities or\n“circumstances” of place, time, position, and so on, which\nsurround the incorporeal, eternal essence. The whole spatio-temporal\nworld and our corporeal bodies are a consequence of the Fall, an\nemanation of the mind. Eriugena is somewhat ambiguous about this. His\nconsidered position appears to be that God, foreseeing that man would\nfall, created a body and a corporeal world for him. But this corporeal\nbody is not essential to human nature and in the return of all things\nto God, the body will be absorbed back into the spiritual body\n(spirituale corpus) and the spiritual body back to the mind\n(mens, intellectus, νοῦς). The\ncorporeal world will return to its incorporeal essence, and place\nunderstood as the extension will return back into its cause or reason\nas a definition in the mind (Periphyseon, V.889d). \nBook Three discusses the nature of created effects and the meaning of\n“creation from nothing” (creatio ex nihilo). The\nterm “nothing” has two meanings: it can mean\n“nothing through privation” (nihil per\nprivationem), or “nothing on account of excellence”\n(nihil per excellentiam). The lowest rung in the hierarchy of\nbeing, unformed matter, is “almost nothing” (prope\nnihil), or “nothing through privation”. In contrast,\nGod is non-being through the excellence of His nature which transcends\nall being. Since there is nothing outside God, “creation from\nnothing” cannot mean creation from some principle outside God,\nrather it means: creation out of God’s superabundant\nnothingness. God creates out of himself (a se) and all\ncreation remains within him. \nBooks Four and Five, originally planned as one book, discuss the\nreturn (ἐπιστροφή,\nepistrophe, reditus, reversio) of all\nthings to God. According to the cosmic cycle Eriugena accepts, drawing\nheavily on Maximus Confessor and his interpretation of\nGregory of Nyssa, it is in the nature of things for effects to return\nto their causes. There is a general return of all things to God.\nCorporeal things will return to their incorporeal causes, the temporal\nto the eternal, the finite will be absorbed in the infinite. The human\nmind will achieve reunification with the divine, and then the\ncorporeal, temporal, material world will become essentially\nincorporeal, timeless, and intellectual. Human nature will return to\nits “Idea” or “notio” in the mind of\nGod. According to Eriugena’s interpretation of scripture,\n“paradise” is the scriptural name for this perfect human\nnature in the mind of God. Humans who refuse to let go of the\n“circumstances” remain trapped in their own phantasies,\nand it is to this mental state that the scriptural term\n“hell” applies. Eriugena maintains that the real hell is\ndeprivation of the vision of God: “whoever is without Christ is\nin darkness, for Christ is the inner light”\n(Periphyseon, V.936b–937a). Eriugena continues:\n“Take Christ from me, and no good is left for me, nor is there\nany torment left to terrify me” (Periphyseon, V.989a). Eriugena thinks the\nGreek word for “hell”, ᾅδης, is\nless misleading than the Latin infernus: “But the\nGreeks, displaying as usual a greater intelligence and a subtler\naccuracy, called the nether regions ᾅδης,\nthat is, “sorrow”” (Periphyseon, V.955a).\nThe Latin infernus, in effect suggests an inferior place. On\nthe contrary, the Greek equivalent of infernus, i.e.,\nᾅδης, designates not a place, but a state:\nsorrow or unpleasantness: α\nprivative—ἡδύς. \nAside from the general return of all things to God, Eriugena claims\nthere is a special return whereby the elect achieve\n“deification” (deificatio, theosis,\nθέωσις) whereby they will\nmerge with God completely, as lights blend into the one light, as\nvoices blend in the choir, as a droplet of water merges with the\nstream. God shall be all in all (omnia in omnibus, Periphyseon, V\n935c). \nEriugena’s account of human nature is complex and fascinating\nbecause it is woven of several threads derived from a variety of\nsources: Maximus Confessor, Pseudo-Dionysius, Gregory of Nyssa, and\nlast but not least, Augustine. Books Four and Five contain\nEriugena’s anthropology, explicated as part of his commentary on\nthe six days of creation (the Hexaemeron); this aspect has recently been the focus of much\nphilosophical interest (Stock, Otten, Moran). Eriugena’s account\nranges widely, treating of the creation of human nature, the Fall and\nthe consequent division of the sexes, the meaning of human nature as\nmade in the image and likeness of God (in imaginem et\nsimilitudinem dei), the nature of paradise to which perfected\nhuman nature will return, the nature of evil and how it relates to human will. He\ndraws heavily on Augustine’s commentaries on Genesis, especially\nDe Genesi ad litteram, as well as Ambrose’s De\nParadiso, Basil the Great’s Homilies on the Hexaemeron and extensively on Gregory of Nyssa’s De hominis\nopificio. But Eriugena is never a slavish follower—he\ndeparts from Augustine on several points, including on the question of\nthe purely spiritual nature of paradise: whether Adam’s body was\nanimal or spiritual, and whether humans ante peccatum ever\nactually spent time in paradise. Eriugena adopts Gregory of\nNyssa’s view that sexual difference is a result of the Fall,\nthat the real Fall is the fall from intellect into sense, intellect\ndistracted by the voluptuousness of sense. So, sexual difference\nreally makes no difference for humans, or as Eriugena boldly puts it:\n“Man is better than sex” (homo melior est quam\nsexus, Periphyseon,  II.534a). This, Eriugena believes, agrees with Scripture:\n“in Christ there is neither male nor female” (Periphyseon, IV.795a).\nThus, Eriugena’s radical Scriptural exegesis, in part building\non Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus, supports original philosophical\nclaims about the sexless nature of true, undivided, human nature. \nJust as the transcendent nature of God allows us to legitimately apply\ncontradictory predicates to Him (“Deus est; deus\nnon est”), so too we may apply contradictory predicates to\nhuman nature. Though Book IV of the Periphyseon has the\nappearance of a Biblical commentary, dialectic also plays a privileged\nrole. Eriugena employs dialectic to highlight the contradictions\ninherent in human nature: man is an animal and man is not an animal;\nman is spiritual and not spiritual. For Eriugena, these contradictions\nare really indications of man’s exalted status; his essence\ncannot be circumscribed. \nHuman nature in this respect resembles the divine nature which too is\n“both beyond all things and in all things”\n(Periphyseon, IV.759a–b). \n\n \nNevertheless, humanity is a mirror of all things, and therefore Eriugena can offer\nthe definition of humanity as “a certain intellectual concept\nformed eternally (aeternaliter facta) in the divine\nmind” (Periphyseon, IV.768b). But of course, since everything is an Idea in\nthe divine mind, this definition applies not only to human nature but\nto all other things too. Eriugena believes he has articulated the\nuniversality and comprehensive nature of humanity but not its\nuniqueness in this definition. Following Gregory of Nyssa, Eriugena\ntherefore rejects the traditional account of human nature as a\n“microcosm”, made up of all parts of the world. He uses\nthe Greek term “microcosmos” only once in the\nPeriphyseon, at IV.793c, where he is quoting Gregory of\nNyssa, De imagine Chapter 17 (Cappuyns, 1965: 232) and glosses\nthe word: “id est paruum mundum”: “that is,\na small world”. Gregory says those who try to glorify human\nnature by saying it is a microcosm actually do not glorify human\nnature at all. For all creatures, even a mouse, are made up of the\nfour elements, and will pass away. Gregory continues: \nBut, according to the Church’s reasoning, the greatness of man\nlies not in his likeness to the created world but in the fact that he\nis created according to the image of the Creator of nature.\n(Periphyseon, IV.794a) \nEriugena, however, recognizes the crucial role of human nature in mediating\nbetween the divine and created things. Human nature is the\n“workshop of all things” (officina omnium,\nII.530d; IV.755b). Human nature is a medium between animal\nand angel, a medietas between the earthly and the\nintelligible worlds. Human nature contains not only elements from the\ncorporeal world but also belongs to the intelligible world: \nI declare that man consists of one and the same rational soul\nconjoined to the body in a mysterious manner, and that it is by a\ncertain wonderful and intelligible division that man himself is\ndivided into two parts, in one of which he is created in the image and\nlikeness of the Creator, and participates in no animality …\nwhile in the other he communicates with the animal nature and was\nproduced out of the earth, that is to say, out of the common nature of\nall things, and is included in the universal genus of animals.\n(Periphyseon, IV.754a–b) \nThe highest dignity for human nature is that it uniquely mirrors\ntranscendent divine nature. Only of human nature can it be said that\nit is made in the image and likeness of God. Not even the angels are\naccorded that honor, so in a sense man is greater than the angels.\nHuman nature may even require the application of affirmative and\nnegative propositions: Man is an animal and man is not an animal\n(IV.758b).  Although, for Eriugena, “rational animal”\ndoes not completely define human nature,\nthis mirroring of God in man occurs especially in the cognitive\ndomain. Like Maximus, Eriugena argues that God knows that He is\n(quia est), but not what He is (quid est). God has\nexistential knowledge, but no circumscribing knowledge of His essence,\nsince, as infinite, He is uncircumscribable: \nSo God does not know of Himself what He is because He is not a\n“what”, being in everything incomprehensible both to\nHimself and to every intellect … But He does not recognize\nHimself as being something (Se ipsum autem non cognoscit aliquid\nesse) … For if He were to recognize Himself in something,\nHe would show that He is not in every respect infinite and\nincomprehensible. (Periphyseon, II.589b–c) \nFollowing Maximus Confessor, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine, Eriugena\ntakes the imago dei idea to its ultimate consequence by\nforging an apophatic-negative anthropology: the human being, as the image of God,  knows\nthat it is, but it cannot comprehend or\ncircumscribe its own essence or nature, since, in its deepest core, as imago dei, it too is infinite as God is infinite. All that can be done is to specify the\n“circumstances” (circumstantiae) which surround\nhis essence, e.g., place, time, rest, motion, condition, etc.,\n(Periphyseon, II.586d). The human being in this sense is an\nimage of the infinite and uncircumscribable God, and an image is\nidentical to its archetype in all respects “except in respect of\nsubject” (praeter rationem subiecti,\nPeriphyseon II.598b). Any difference between God and human\nnature is the result not of essence but of “an accident produced\nby sin” (sed ex delicto accidit, II.598b). Human\nself-ignorance mirrors the divine self-ignorance; human\nincomprehensibility mirrors divine incomprehensibility. This makes\nhuman nature share in infinity. \n \nEriugena elaborates on the parallels\nbetween human and divine nature. Perfect human nature would have\npossessed the fullest knowledge of its Creator, of itself, and of\neverything else, had it not sinned (Periphyseon, IV.778c). Man would have ruled the\nwhole of the universe as a king rules his subjects (Periphyseon, IV.782c). Man,\nlike God, is the plenitudo bonorum (Periphyseon, IV.796a). Just as God is\nunbounded by any category and ultimately indefinable, human nature is\nineffable and incomprehensible and open to infinite possibility and\nperfectibility (Periphyseon, V.919c). God’s transcendence and immanence are\nreflected in human transcendence and immanence with regard to its\nworld. Consider the following remarkable passage from Book Four which\nis a typical example of Eriugena’s dialectical thinking and of\nthe close parallelism between human and divine: \nFor just as God is both beyond all things and in all things—for\nHe Who only truly is, is the essence of all things, and while He is\nwhole in all things He does not cease to be whole beyond all things,\nwhole in the world, whole around the world, whole in the sensible\ncreature, whole in the intelligible creature, whole creating the\nuniverse, whole created in the universe, whole in the whole of the\nuniverse and whole in its parts, since He is both the whole and the\npart, just as He is neither the whole nor the part—in the same\nway human nature in its own world (in its own subsistence) in its own\nuniverse and in its invisible and visible parts is whole in itself,\nand whole in its whole, and whole in its parts, and its parts are\nwhole in themselves and whole in the whole. (Periphyseon,\nIV.759a–b) \nEriugena concludes that human nature is  \nwholly in the wholeness of the whole created nature (in\nuniversitate totius conditae naturae tota est), seeing that in it\nevery creature is fashioned, and in it all are linked together (in\nipsa copulata), and into it all shall return, and through it must\nall be saved. (Periphyseon, IV.760a) \nEriugena’s cosmological account has been criticized for\ncollapsing the differences between God and creation, leading to a\nheresy later labeled as pantheism. There is no doubt that\nEriugena’s theological intentions are orthodox, but he is a\nbold, speculative thinker, who believes that philosophy uncovers the\ntrue meaning of faith. Eriugena (as does Nicholas of Cusa) gives a\nunique place to Christ in the outgoing and return of all things. In\nChrist, the hypostatic union of the divine and the created orders is\nrealized. Christ possesses all the perfections of human nature, since\nvir autem perfectus est Christus (Periphyseon,\nIV.743b), and Christ is also one in substance with God. Eriugena\nrecognizes that Christ is unique and that the individual is not\ncollapsed into the universal, even in the return. Humans will always\nbe different from God in that they have been created and God is\nCreator (Periphyseon, IV.796b). However, a case can also be\nmade for saying that Eriugena really intends his perfected human\nnature to possess divine attributes in a genuine way. The argument\nturns on an answer to the following question: To what extent is man\nmade in the image and likeness of God? Eriugena has two answers: an\nimage is not an image unless it is identical to its exemplar in all\nrespects “except number” or “subject”\n(excepta subiecti ratione, Periphyseon, IV.778a).\nFrom this we may conclude that the human being differs from God in\nsubiecto, that is, there is solely a difference in number. But\ndifference in number does not mean that God and man stand apart from\neach other as two identical billiard balls would occupy different\nplaces. Neither God nor man is in space or time; both are incorporeal,\nand hence numerical difference, or difference in subject, can only\nhave the Neoplatonic meaning that the first will always differ from\nwhat comes after the first. God is first, and hence man comes after.\nBut “after” (post) here has no temporal meaning,\nas Eriugena emphasizes (Periphyseon, IV.808a). A second\nanswer he gives is that God is creator and man is created, but since\ncreation is self-manifestation, that amounts to saying no more than\nthat God manifests himself fully in man. Eriugena sometimes qualifies\nthis by saying that man is by grace (per gratiam) what God is\nby nature, quoting Maximus Confessor (e.g., Periphyseon,\nV.879c–880a), but elsewhere, especially in the concept of\ntheophany or divine manifestation, he fuses the notion of nature with\nthat of grace: all natures are theophanies, divine manifestations, so\nGod is the source of both dona (gifts of grace)\nand data (what are given in nature), both are revelations of\nthe divine nature. Indeed, there are many places where Eriugena cites\ntexts (e.g., Maximus) to suggest that God and man mirror each\nother. His translation of Maximus includes the proposition: “For\nthey say that man and God are paradigms of each other”\n(Dicunt enim inter se invicem paradigmata Deum et hominem, PL\n122: 1220a). One is at the heart of the other. Similarly, human nature\nand the angelic nature are mutually mirroring. This notion of the\nintertwining and merging of minds is at the very core of\nEriugena’s mysticism and of his understanding of the relation\nbetween human and divine natures and their coming together in the\nperson of Christ. Christ is actually what all human beings can become\nand that is precisely the promise of salvation for Eriugena. Consider\nthe following passage from Book Two: \nFor if Christ Who understands of all things, (Who) indeed is the\nunderstanding of all things, really unified all that He assumed, who\ndoubts then that what first took place in the Head and principal\nExemplar of the whole of human nature will eventually happen in the\nwhole? (Periphyseon, II.545a) \nEriugena articulates the view that God’s becoming human (His\nincarnation or inhumanisation) is balanced cosmologically by the human being\nbecoming divinized in deification (deificatio, Greek:\ntheosis). The phrase “God was made man so that man\ncould be made God” (Latin: factus est Deus homo, ut homo\nfieret Deus) is a commonplace among the Christian Fathers,\nespecially in the Eastern tradition. It is to be found in Greek in St.\nIrenaeus, in St. Athanasius (298–373) in his treatise De\nincarnatione 54, 3 (PG 25: 192B); and, in Latin, in St.\nAugustine, (e.g., his sermon In natali Domini, VIII, PL 38:\n1009 footnote; and In natali Domini, XII, PL 39: 1997) and\nelsewhere. There are several passages where Eriugena (following St.\nAugustine and Maximus Confessor) balances the humanization/incarnation\nof God with the deification of man (see for instance his\nHomilia XXIII, PL 122: 296a–c; Commentarius in\nEvangelium Iohannis I, xxiv, PL 122: 300a). It is often expressed\nin terms of man becoming “by grace” (per gratiam)\nwhat God is “by nature” (per naturam). Eriugena\nfollows the Greek formulation of the Council of Nicaea (NB: not the\nLatin version) and the Greek Christian tradition (specifically Maximus\nConfessor) in occasionally distinguishing between inhumanatio\n(Greek: enanthropesis)—the relation between the Second\nPerson of the Trinity and human nature)—and incarnatio\n(Greek: ενσάρκωση)—the temporal becoming flesh of the\nVerbum in Jesus (see for instance Periphyseon I.449b; and\nHomilia XIX, PL 122: 294c). Eriugena refers to the\ntheosis or deification of human nature at\nPeriphyseon I.449b (and elsewhere, see Periphyseon,\nIV.743a, IV.760d) and draws extensively on Maximus for the view that\nthere will be a reunification of human nature with the divine (see\nPeriphyseon, II.536d ff). In his Homilia Eriugena\nwrites: “Of deification, however, I say, that man and God are\nunited in the unity of the one substance” (Deificationis\nautem, dico, qua homo et deus in unitatem unius substantiae adunati\nsunt, PL 122: 296c). \nThis clearly implies that humanity as a whole, that is, resurrected\nhuman nature in its perfected state, will be truly illuminated and\nmerged with the divine, for human nature itself in its true essence is\nthe intellectus omnium. Furthermore, the use of the future\ntense here is somewhat misleading, since time itself is a function of\nour fallen state and the perfected state is timeless so there is a\nsense in which perfected human nature already is one with God and\nalways has been one with God. Eriugena, then, has a dialectical\nunderstanding of the relation of God and man which can be viewed as\northodox from one point of view, but which is always transgressing the\nboundaries of orthodoxy in the direction of a view which has God and\nman mutually contemplating themselves and each other, in an endless,\neternal play of theophanies. Thus, a kind of mystical humanism is\ncelebrated in Periphyseon Book Four, a humanism unfolded\nthrough the dialectic of self-knowledge and ignorance. \nIn Eriugena’s conceptions of God, the cosmos and human nature,\nthere is an extraordinarily bold emphasis on infinity. God is infinite\nand manifests Himself infinitely in His theophanies; the causes\nthemselves are infinite; the created cosmos too would be infinite were\nit not for the Fall; finally, human nature is essentially unbounded\nand infinite. The Holy Scriptures too have a kind of infinite\nrichness: Sacrae scripturae interpretatio infinita est,\nII.560a. Employing an original simile, Eriugena claims that the number\nof interpretations of Holy Scripture is like the innumerable colors in\na peacock’s tail (IV.749c). Human understanding and learning are\nalso endless. Eriugena emphasizes the lack of limit and inherent\ntranscendence not just of human nature but also of the whole of\nnature. Nature as a whole is an infinite series of theophanies. This\nconception of God as “more than infinite” and as the\n“infinity of infinities” is Eriugena’s most\nsignificant contribution to philosophy, one that attracted both the\nattention of medieval mystics and later of German Idealists. \nEriugena’s Periphyseon had immediate influence in\nFrance, notably at the schools of Laon, Auxerre, and Corbie. His\ntranslations of Pseudo-Dionysius were widely used from the time of\nAnastasius until they were gradually replaced in the thirteenth\ncentury by those of Johannes Sarracenus. His Homily on the\nPrologue to John (albeit often attributed to Origen) circulated\nwidely through the Middle Ages. The Periphyseon became\nparticularly popular in the twelfth century, especially when\ncirculated in the “edition” of William of Malmsebury or in\nthe paraphrase by Honorius Augustodunensis known as Clavis\nphysicae. Hugh of Saint Victor, Alanus of Lille, and Suger of\nSaint-Denis were among those influenced by Eriugena. In the thirteenth\ncentury, however, the Periphyseon was linked with the\nwritings of David of Dinant and Amaury of Bène, two theologians\nat the University of Paris, and was condemned with them in 1210 and\n1225. According to Thomas Aquinas (ST I.3.8; SCG I.17; I.26), Amaury\nof Bène was condemned for saying that God is the formal principle of\nall things, an accusation of pantheism, which recalled\nEriugena’s statement that God is the “form of all\nthings” (forma omnium). David of Dinant (fl.\n1210), on the other hand, was supposed to have identified God with\nprime matter and proclaimed that God was the materia omnium.\nIt is likely that Eriugena’s discussion of God and matter as\n“nothing”, and as both transcending sense and intellect\naccording to the first mode of being and non-being, contributed to\nthis accusation. \nIn the later Middle Ages both Meister Eckhart of Hochheim\n(c.1260–c.1328) and Nicholas of Cusa (1401–64) were\nsympathetic to Eriugena and familiar with his Periphyseon.\nCusanus owned a copy of the Periphyseon. Interest in Eriugena\nwas revived by Thomas Gale’s first printed edition of 1687.\nHowever, soon afterwards, Thomas Gale’s first printed edition,\nthe Periphyseon, was listed in the first edition of the\nIndex Librorum Prohibitorum, and remained on it, until the\nIndex itself was abolished in the 1960s. In the nineteenth century,\nHegel and his followers, interested in the history of philosophy from\na systematic point of view, read Eriugena rather uncritically as an\nabsolute idealist and as the father of German idealism. The first\ncritical editions of his major works were not produced until the\ntwentieth century (Lutz, Jeauneau, Barbet). A conference organized by\nJohn O’Meara and Ludwig Bieler in the Royal Irish Academy,\nDublin, in 1970 led to the founding of the Society for the Promotion\nof Eriugenian Studies (SPES) which has been active in developing\nEriugena studies at a high scholarly level by hosting international\ncolloquia and publishing the proceedings. The most recent meeting of\nSPES, “Eriugena and Creation” took place at the University\nof Chicago in 2011 (Otten &Allen 2014). \nEriugena is an original philosopher who articulates the relation\nbetween God and creation in a manner which preserves both divine\ntranscendence and omnipresence. His theory of human nature is\nrationalist and intellectualist but also apophatic. His theory of\nplace and time as defining structures of the mind anticipates Kant,\nhis dialectical reasoning prefigures Hegel. But above all, Eriugena is\na mystic who emphasizes the ultimate unity of human nature and through it of the entire creation with God.","contact.mail":"aguiu1@ccc.edu","contact.domain":"ccc.edu"}]
