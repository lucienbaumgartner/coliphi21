For example, in some sense of “interpretation”,\nthe interpretation of the expression “bank” in the\nfollowing sentence depends on the interpretation of other expressions\n(in particular, “of the river”):\n\n(1) John is\ndown by the bank of the river.\n\nBut no one would say this is an example of anaphora. And as to the\nsecond characterization, though all agree that the following is an\nexample of anaphora (and “he” is an anaphoric pronoun here\non one reading of the sentence), it is not a case of the\nreferent of one expression being supplied by another\nexpression, (since “he” is not a referring expression on\nthe reading in question):\n\n(2) Every male\nlawyer believes he is smart.\n\nHence, rather than attempting to characterize anaphora generally and\nabstractly, we shall begin with some examples. There is generally\nthought to be many types of anaphora, though in some cases there is\ndisagreement as to whether to classify those cases as anaphora or\n not.[2]\n \n\n\n\nPronominal anaphora:\n\n(3) John left.\nHe said he was ill. (The antecedent is “John” and the\nanaphoric expression is “he”.)\n\nVP anaphora (also called VP ellipsis):\n\n(4) Mary Anne\ntook out the garbage. Claudia did too. (The antecedent is “took\nout the garbage” and the anaphoric expression a null VP. See\nPartee and Bach (1984), Prüst et al. (1994).)\n\nPropositional anaphora:\n\n(5) One\nplaintiff was passed over for promotion three times. But the jury\ndidn’t believe this. (The antecedent is the proposition\nexpressed by the first sentence. The anaphoric expression is\n“this”. Example from Asher and Lascarides\n(2003).)\n\nAdjectival anaphora:\n\n(6) A kind\nstranger returned my wallet. Such people are rare. (The antecedent is\n“kind stranger” and the anaphoric expression\n“such”.)\n\nModal anaphora:\n\n(7) John might\ngive a presentation. He would use slides. (The antecedent is the\npossibility described by the first sentence, and the anaphoric\nexpression is the modal “would”. Example from Stone and\nHardt 1999)\n\nTemporal anaphora:\n\n(8) Sheila had\na party last Friday and Sam got drunk. (The time at which Sam got\ndrunk is anaphoric on the time at which Sheila had the party. Example\nfrom Partee 1984.)\n\nKind-level anaphora:\n\n(9) John gave\na presentation. Sarah gave one too. (The antecedent is “a\npresentation”, and the anaphoric expression is\n“one”.)\n\nThe antecedent also does not always have to precede the anaphoric\nexpression; when it doesn’t, these are called cases of\ncataphora or backwards anaphora:\n\n(10) If she\ndoesn’t show up soon, Jane will be disqualified from the\ncompetition.\n\nDespite there being many kinds of anaphora, this article will focus on\npronominal anaphora, since this is the type of anaphora that has\nreceived the most attention in the linguistics and (especially)\nphilosophical literature. Some anaphoric pronouns are referring\nexpressions that inherit their referents from other referring\nexpressions. For example, on the anaphoric reading of\n (3),\n “He” inherits its referent from “John”, which\nis said to be the antecedent of the pronoun. Such anaphora is\nsimple and well understood. In cases such as\n (2)\n above, the anaphoric pronoun has as its antecedent a quantifier\n(“Every male lawyer” in (2)), and essentially functions as\na variable bound by the quantifier. Again, such cases are well\nunderstood. There are some anaphoric pronouns that cannot be\nunderstood as referring expressions that inherit their referents from\nother referring expressions, nor as variables bound by quantified\nantecedents. These cases of anaphora are of interest to philosophers\nand linguists because formulating proper semantic theories for them\nhas proved to be a difficult and interesting task. Many theories of\nthese cases are currently being advocated.\n\n\n\nThe simplest sorts of anaphoric pronouns are those that “pick\nup” a reference from a previous referring expression whether in\nthe same sentence or another. Consider for example: \non the readings of these sentences on which “he” and\n“his” co-refer with “John”. In such cases, the\npronouns are anaphoric, and the expression “John” is\ncalled the antecedent of the anaphoric expression. The\nsemantics of such anaphoric pronouns is very simple: the referent of\nthe anaphoric pronoun is the referent of its antecedent. \nAs indicated above, there are also anaphoric pronouns with quantifier\n(rather than referring expression) antecedents. Examples include\n (2)\n above and: \nAgain, on the readings of these sentences on which “he”\nand “his” “look back” to their antecedents for\ninterpretation rather than being assigned independent reference (e.g.,\nby pointing to Chris when uttering “his” in (12)). It is\nwidely held that in such cases, the pronouns function semantically as\nvariables bound by their quantifier antecedents. Thus, their semantic\nfunction is just like that of bound variables of first order logic.\n [3]\n The insight that some pronouns with quantifier antecedents function\nlike bound variables in first order logic goes back at least to Quine\n(1960, see chapter IV section 28). Historically, these cases have been\nof more interest to linguists than philosophers. For example, one\nthing that needs to be explained is that in a sentence like\n“Sarah likes her”, “Sarah” and\n“her” cannot co-refer (in order to get a co-reference\nreading, we must say “Sarah likes herself”), though we can\nget the co-reference reading (or not) in a sentence like “Sarah\nlikes her sister”. Accounting for these types of patterns of\nsentence-internal anaphora is the central concern of the area of\nlinguistics called binding theory (see May 1980; Higginbotham\nand May 1981; Chomsky 1981; Reinhardt 1983a,b; Büring 2005).\nThough these insights are all important, if examples like\n (3),\n (11), and\n (12)\n were the only kinds of pronominal anaphora, they currently would not\nbe of much interest to so many philosophers and linguists.  \nSignificant interest in anaphoric pronouns grew out of the realization\nthat there are anaphoric pronouns that cannot be understood as having\ntheir references fixed by their antecedents (as in\n (3)\n and\n (11)\n above) nor as being variables bound by their quantifier antecedents\n(as in\n (2)\n and\n (12)\n above). The three sorts of examples of this discussed here have\nfigured prominently in the literature on anaphora. \nFirst, there is discourse anaphora: cases in which an\nanaphoric pronoun has an antecedent in another sentence, where that\nantecedent at least appears to be a\n quantifier.[4]\n Examples include: \nThere are at least two reasons for thinking that the pronouns in (13)\nand (14) are not variables bound by their quantifier antecedents. Both\nreasons are discussed by Evans (1977). The first is that such a\ntreatment clearly yields the wrong truth conditions for examples like\n(14). If “they” is a bound variable in (14), the two\nsentences should be equivalent to \n(Or, more colloquially, “Few professors are such that they both\ncame to the party and had a good time.”) This is clearly\nincorrect, since the sentences of (14) entail that few professors\nattended the party (i.e., the first sentence entails this), whereas\n(14a) could be true if many professors\n attended.[5] \nThe second reason for thinking pronouns in cases of discourse anaphora\naren’t bound variables is that it seems committed to the claim\nthat the following anomalous sentences aren’t anomalous: \nIf the (apparent) quantifiers in\n (13)\n and\n (14)\n can bind variables in sentences after those in which they occur, why\ncan’t the quantifiers in (15) and (16)? If this could happen,\n(15) and (16) should be fine and should together be equivalent to,\nrespectively: \nBut they are not. Thus, pronouns in discourse anaphora are not\nvariables (syntactically) bound by their quantifier\n antecedents.[6] \nFurthermore, there are cases of (plural) anaphora in which the\ndenotation of “they” is derived in a more indirect way\nfrom the antecedent, as in (17), an example of complement\nanaphora: \nUnlike in (14), where “they” picks out the professors who\ncame to the party, in (17), “they” picks out the students\nwho didn’t come to the party. (For more about\ncomplement anaphora, see Nouwen (2003), for complement anaphora in the\npsycholinguistics literature, see Sanford & Moxey (1993).) \nNor are these like example\n (3),\n in which the pronoun simply refers to the same thing as the\nantecedent. Indefinite descriptions like “an\nanthropologist” are commonly thought to be quantifiers, and\nexpressions like “few professors” are certainly\nquantifiers, not referring expressions. On most theories of indefinite\ndescriptions, the first sentence of\n (13)\n is true just in case there is at least one anthropologist who\ndiscovered the skeleton called “Lucy”; its truth does not\ndepend on any particular anthropologist. Thus there is no referential\nantecedent in the first sentence for the pronoun in the second\nsentence to be co-referential with. \nA further problem with thinking of these pronouns as referential can\nbe seen by considering a slightly more complex example: \nThe crucial point is that the second sentence has a reading on which\nit attributes to Scott a general belief instead of a belief about a\nparticular person. This reading would be true, for example, if Scott\nbelieved that some man broke into Sarah’s apartment by coming in\nthe window, but had no idea about who might have broken in. This is\n(prima facie) evidence that the pronoun in the second\nsentence is not a referring expression, because if it were, the second\nsentence of (18) would only have a reading on which it attributes to\nScott a belief about the particular person the pronoun refers to. But\nthis is\n incorrect.[7]\n (On the other hand, for a treatment of such de dicto\nreadings while maintaining that the pronoun is a referring expression,\nsee Elbourne 2005: 99–106.) \nThus, with pronouns in discourse anaphora, we have examples of\npronouns that can neither be understood as picking up their referents\nfrom their antecedents nor as being variables bound by their\nantecedents. Discourse anaphora provides further interesting examples\nto philosophers and linguists when the antecedents are under the scope\nof quantifiers, modals, or negation. For example, the pronouns in\n(19), (20), and (22) are infelicitous, but those in (21) and (23) are\nfelicitous. This is something further that an account of discourse\nanaphora needs to\n explain.[8] \nA second sort of anaphoric pronoun that cannot be understood as a\nreferring expression or as a bound variable is in fact a special case\nof discourse anaphora. However, it deserves separate mention because\nit has generated so much interest. Consider the following discourse,\nwhich we shall call a Geach Discourse, adapted from the\nanalogous conjunction in Geach 1967: \nThere is a reading of this discourse on which both sentences in it are\ntrue even if there are no witches, so that “a witch” in\nthe first sentence must take narrow scope with respect to “Hob\nthinks”. But then the scope of “a witch” cannot\nextend to the second sentence to bind the pronoun “she”,\nsince the “scope” of “Hob thinks”\ndoesn’t extend to the second sentence. Hence on the reading in\nquestion, which we shall call the Geach Reading, the pronoun\n“she” is not a bound variable. Further, since there are no\nwitches, and “she” is anaphoric on “a witch”,\n“she” in the second sentence must in some sense being used\nto “talk about” a non-existent witch. Thus, it apparently\ncannot be a referring term either, since its alleged referent\ndoesn’t exist. So here again we have an anaphoric pronoun that\ncannot be understood as a referring expression nor as a bound\nvariable. Examples of this sort are sometimes referred to\n(misleadingly, in our view) as instances of intentional\nidentity. \nThe third sort of case in which an anaphoric pronoun cannot be\nunderstood as a referring expression nor as a bound variable is that\nof “donkey\n anaphora”.[9]\n Here there are two varieties, which are called conditional\nand relative clause donkey sentences, respectively: \nOn the readings we are concerned with, neither (25) nor (26) is\ntalking about any particular donkey, and so the pronoun\n“it” cannot be a term referring to a particular donkey.\nFurther, in the case of (25), all independent evidence available\nsuggests that a quantifier can’t take wide scope over a\nconditional and bind variables in its consequent (*“If John owns\nevery donkeyi, he beats iti”). This\nsuggests that the (apparent) quantifier “a donkey” in (25)\ncannot bind the pronoun in the consequent. In addition, even if\n“a donkey” could magically do this in (25), assuming it is\nan existential quantifier, we still wouldn’t get the intuitive\ntruth conditions of (25), which require that Sarah beats\nevery donkey she owns. Similarly, the independent evidence\navailable suggests that quantifiers can’t scope out of relative\nclauses (*“A man who owns every donkeyi beats\niti”), and so again the pronoun in (26) is not within\nthe scope of its quantifier antecedent and so is not bound by it.\nThus, the pronouns in both conditional and relative clause donkey\nsentences can be neither understood as referring expressions nor as\nbound variables. \nSo now we have three cases of anaphoric pronouns that cannot be\nunderstood as referring expressions nor as bound variables: 1)\npronouns in discourse anaphora; 2) pronouns in Geach discourses and 3)\npronouns in (conditional and relative clause) donkey sentences.\nLet’s call these cases of problematic anaphora. The\nrecent interest in anaphora is largely an interest in finding a\nsemantic theory for problematic anaphora. In the next section, we\noutline the main theories that have arisen to fill this void. \nBefore discussing recent theories of problematic anaphora, a few\ncaveats are in order. First, our discussion will not be exhaustive. We\ncover what we take to be the best known and most promising theories.\nSecond, because each theory is a formal, sophisticated semantic\ntheory, to describe a single theory in detail would itself be a paper\nlength project. Thus, we try instead to give a simple, informal sketch\nof the main features of each theory. The notes and references point\nthe interested reader to places where he/she can get more detail.\nThird, we shall confine ourselves to briefly describing how each\ntheory handles simple discourse anaphora of the sort exhibited by\n (13)\n above, in which a pronoun in one sentence is anaphoric on an\nindefinite noun phrase in a previous sentence, and donkey anaphora\nlike\n (25)\n and\n (26).\n Readers interested in more details on how these theories deal with\nembedding under quantifiers, negation, or modals should consult the\nreadings cited both in the previous section and in the sections below.\nReaders interested in Geach discourses or “intentional\nidentity” should begin by consulting Asher (1987), Edelberg\n(1986), Geach (1967), Kamp (1990), King (1994), Braun (2012), and the\nworks mentioned therein. \nThe first two of the theories discussed below, discourse\nrepresentation theory and dynamic semantics, represent departures from\ntraditional semantics, departures which were largely motivated at the\nbeginning by the problematic anaphora cases. The second two theories\ndiscussed below, d-type theories and the CDQ theory, represent ways in\nwhich the problematic anaphora data is dealt with within a traditional\nsemantic framework. \nIn the early 1980s, Irene Heim (1982) and Hans Kamp (1981)\nindependently formulated very similar semantic theories that were in\npart designed to handle problematic anaphora, particularly donkey and\ndiscourse anaphora. The theories developed by Heim and Kamp have come\nto be known as Discourse Representation Theory or DRT (see entry on\n Discourse Representation Theory).[10]\n We shall not attempt to describe differences between the formulations\nof Heim and Kamp. Indeed, in our exposition we shall combine elements\nof the two theories. Readers interested in the differences between the\ntwo accounts should consult Heim (1982) and Kamp (1981) directly. \nWe believe it is fair to say that it was the development of DRT that\nmade the semantics of anaphora a central issue in philosophy of\nlanguage. One reason for this was the following bold statement by Kamp\n(1981): \nA theory of this form differs fundamentally from those familiar from\nthe truth-theoretical and model-theoretical literature, and thus a\nsubstantial argument will be wanted that such a radical departure from\nexisting frameworks is really necessary. The particular analysis\ncarried out in the main part of this paper should be seen as a first\nattempt to provide such an argument. The analysis deals with only a\nsmall number of linguistic problems, but careful reflection upon just\nthose problems already reveals, I suggest, that a major revision of\nsemantic theory is called for. (Kamp 1981: 278)  \nThe problems that Kamp goes on to address are the treatment of donkey\nanaphora and simple discourse anaphora. Hence Kamp appears to be\nsaying that these problems cannot be handled within more traditional\nframeworks and thus that a DRT approach is necessary. Obviously, the\nclaim that the semantics of anaphora requires a radical revision in\nsemantic theory got the attention of philosophers of language. Thus,\nthe study of problematic anaphora blossomed during the 1980s and\n1990s. \nThe first way in which DRT departs from more traditional approaches is\nthat it claims that indefinite noun phrases such as “an\nanthropologist” or “a donkey” are essentially\npredicates with free variables rather than existential quantifiers.\nThus, the above indefinites might as well look as follows at the level\nof “logical form”: \nanthropologist(x)\n\ndonkey(x) \nIn effect, an indefinite introduces a “novel” variable,\n(i.e., in DRT’s terminology, establishes a discourse\nreferent) and a pronoun anaphoric on an indefinite is interpreted\nas the same variable as was introduced by its indefinite antecedent.\nHence a simple discourse such as: \nin effect can be represented\n as[11] \nIn addition to this, DRT builds in to the assignment of truth\nconditions default existential quantification over free variables.\nThus, (27a) is true iff there is some assignment to the variable\n“x” that is in the extension of “man”,\n“loves Annie” and “rich”, that is, iff\nsomething is a man who loves Annie and is rich. Thus, that indefinites\nappear to have the force of existential quantifiers in cases like (27)\nis not because they are existential quantifiers but because of the\ndefault existential quantification of free variables. \nLet us turn now to the DRT treatment of donkey anaphora. First, note\nthat both relative clause and conditional donkey anaphora appear to\nhave a sort of “universal force”: the truth of\n (25)\n and\n (26)\n above, repeated here, require that Sarah beats every donkey she owns\nand that every donkey owning woman beats every donkey she\n owns.[12] \nThus, the indefinite here mysteriously has universal force and\nexpresses something about every donkey owned by someone. Recall that\naccording to DRT, an indefinite is effectively a one-place predicate\nwith a free variable. The central idea of DRT in the case of both\nconditional and relative clause donkey sentences is that the universal\nforce of the indefinite results from the variable in it being bound by\nan operator with genuine universal force. In the case of (25), the\n“conditional operator” has universal force, since it in\neffect says that in every case (assignment to free variables) in which\nthe antecedent is true, the consequent is true. So (25) claims that\nevery assignment to “x” that makes “Sarah\nowns x” and “x is a donkey” true, also\nmakes “Sarah beats x” true. So (25) is true iff\nSarah beats every donkey she owns. In (26), by contrast, the universal\nquantifier (determiner) “every” not only binds the\nvariables associated with the predicative material “woman who\nowns a donkey” (for example, presumably there is such a variable\nin the subject argument place of “beats”), but it also\nbinds the variable introduced by the predicate-with-free-variable\n“a donkey”. So it is as though (26) has the “logical\n form”.[13] \nNote that this account requires allowing quantificational determiners\n(“every”) to bind multiple variables. This, again, is a\ndeparture from more classical\n approaches.[14] \nNow since the DRT approach claims that indefinites get their apparent\nquantificational force from other elements that bind the variables in\nthem, it predicts that when different determiners are involved in\nrelative clause donkey sentences, as in \nthe indefinite should appear to have the quantificational force of the\nnew determiner (“Most”). So (16) should be true if most\npairs of women and donkeys they own are such that the women beat the\ndonkeys. Similar remarks apply to conditionals containing\n“non-universal” quantifiers such as “usually”,\nas in \nThis should be true if most pairs of women and donkeys they own are\nsuch that the women beat the donkeys. But this prediction,\nparticularly in the case of (28), seems clearly false. If there are\nexactly ten donkey owning women and one woman owns ten donkeys and\nbeats them all, while the nine other women own a donkey each and\ndon’t beat them, (28) intuitively seems false: most donkey\nowning women fail to beat the donkeys they own. However, the DRT\naccount as formulated claims (28) is true in this situation. This\ndifficulty is one of the main criticisms of classical DRT in the\nliterature and is often called the proportion problem (Heim\n(1990) claims that Nirit Kadmon so dubbed it). The criticism is\ndamaging, because it appears to refute what was claimed to be a\ncentral insight of DRT: that the apparent quantificational force of\nindefinites comes from other elements that bind the variables in\nthem. \nA second difficulty with classical DRT as formulated here involves\ncases such as\n (18)\n above, repeated here: \nAs mentioned above, (18) has a reading on which the second sentence of\nthe discourse attributes a general belief to Scott (something like the\nbelief that a man who broke into Sarah’s apartment came in\nthrough the window). But as formulated, DRT doesn’t get this\nreading. For the default existential quantification of free variables\nacts in effect like a wide scope existential quantifier over the\nentire discourse. Thus, it is as if (18) were as follows: \n(∃x)(x is a man & x broke into\nSarah’s apartment & Scott believes x came in the\nwindow). \nBut this attributes a belief about a specific person to Scott. Hence\nit can’t capture the reading mentioned. Similarly, consider the\nfollowing sentences: \nThese sentences also appear to have readings on which they attribute\ngeneral or de dicto beliefs to the women in question. That\nis, they have readings on which they attribute to the women in\nquestion general beliefs to the effect that they are being\nstalked by secret admirers. This is why these sentences can be true\neven though the women in question don’t know who their secret\nadmirers are, and so have no beliefs about particular persons\nstalking them. For reasons exactly similar to those given for the case\nof the analogous reading of the second sentence of\n (18),\n these readings can’t be captured by DRT as formulated here. We\nshall see below that dynamic approaches have exactly similar problems.\nAsher (1987) and Kamp (1990) attempt to remedy this problem (among\nothers). For further elaboration of the DRT framework, see also Kamp\nand Reyle (1993) and van Eijck and Kamp (1997). For expansions of the\nDRT framework, e.g., SDRT (segmented discourse representation theory),\nsee Asher and Lascarides (2003), for compositional versions of DRT,\nsee Muskens (1996) and Brasoveanu (2006, 2007, 2008). \nAs its name suggests, Discourse Representation Theory was designed to\ncapture the way in which certain features of a discourse, particularly\ninter-sentential relations such as inter-sentential anaphora, affect\nthe interpretation of sentences in the discourse. At the same time,\nDiscourse Representation Theory as originally formulated in Kamp\n(1981) failed to be compositional, at least in the sense of that term\nfamiliar from Montagovian\n approaches.[15] \nThe initial motivation for a dynamic semantic (see entry on\n dynamic semantics)\n approach to discourse and donkey anaphora was on the one hand to\npreserve the “dynamic” elements of DRT, that is the view\nthat what an expression means is given by the way in which the\naddition of the expression to a discourse changes the information\navailable to a hearer of the discourse, (“meaning as potential\nfor changing the state of information”). On the other hand,\ndynamic semantic approaches wanted to adhere to compositionality. This\nis made very clear in the introduction of the classic statement of the\ndynamic semantic approach to discourse and donkey anaphora, namely\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1991). We shall here discuss their treatment\nof discourse and donkey anaphora, Dynamic Predicate Logic\n(henceforth DPL), and gesture at other treatments in the dynamic\nsemantic tradition. Of the theories discussed in this entry, this is\nthe most difficult to explain informally. We shall keep the discussion\nas informal as possible, and urge interested readers to consult the\nworks cited directly for more detail. \nTo begin with, let’s look at how simple discourse anaphora is\nhandled on DPL. So consider again: \nNow in DPL, indefinites such as “a man” are treated as\nexistential quantifiers. Further, DPL treats consecutive sentences in\ndiscourses as being conjoined. So we can think of (27) as follows: \nHere we have rendered the anaphoric pronoun “He” as the\nvariable “x”, the same variable that is the\nvariable of its quantifier antecedent. This represents the anaphoric\nconnection. The important point to notice is that the anaphoric\npronoun/variable in (27b) is not within the syntactic scope of its\nquantifier antecedent. This corresponds to the fact that in DPL, the\nsyntactic scopes of quantifiers are confined to the sentences in which\nthey occur, as current syntactic theory tells us they should be. \nThe key to understanding the DPL account of discourse anaphora lies in\nunderstanding its semantics of the existential quantifier and\nconjunction. Let’s begin with existential quantification. The\nbasic idea here it that when we interpret an existential quantifier,\nthe output of that interpretation may affect the interpretation of\nsubsequent expressions. In standard predicate logic, the\ninterpretation of an existential quantifier is a set of assignment\nfunctions. In DPL, it is a set of ordered pairs of input and\noutput assignment functions. The output assignment functions act as\nthe input to subsequent formulas. Take for example the simple formula\n“\\((\\exists x)(\\mbox{man } x)\\)”. In DPL, such a formula\ntakes all the input functions g, and for each one outputs all\nthe possible assignment functions h such that they differ from\ng at most in that they assign x to an object in the\ninterpretation of “man” (i.e., they assign x to a\nman). More generally, accounting for possibly more complex formulas in\nthe scope of the existential (including another quantifier), a pair of\nsequences \\(\\langle g, h\\rangle\\) is in the interpretation of an\nexistential formula “\\((\\exists x)\\Phi\\)” just in case\nthere is an assignment function k differing from g at\nmost on x such that \\(\\langle k,h\\rangle\\); is in the\ninterpretation of “\\(\\Phi\\)”.[16]\n So note how interpreting the existential quantifier results in\nshifting from the input function g to k, where k\nis now the input to “\\(\\Phi\\)”. This makes the existential\nquantifier internally dynamic, capable of affecting the\ninterpretation of expressions within its syntactic scope. Further, the\nfact that the output assignment functions of interpreting the whole\nexistentially quantified sentence are allowed to be different from the\ninput to the interpretation means that the processing of the\nexistentially quantified formula may affect the interpretation of\nexpressions after the existentially quantified formula, and\nhence outside the scope of the existential quantifier. This\nis to say that the existential quantifier is externally\ndynamic, capable of affecting the interpretation of expressions\noutside its syntactic scope. As we will see, an expression\ncan be internally dynamic and externally static (as well as internally\nand externally static). At any rate, putting things very roughly, the\nidea here is that once the existential quantifier “resets”\nthe value of “x” so that it satisfies the formula\nthe quantifier embeds, that value stays reset (unless there is a\nsubsequent existential quantifier attached to the same variable) and\ncan affect the interpretation of subsequent formulas. \nTurning now to conjunction, the idea here is similar. Again, the\nfundamental idea is that the interpretation of the left conjunct can\naffect the interpretation of the right conjunct. A bit more formally,\na pair of assignment functions \\(\\langle g,h\\rangle\\); is in the\ninterpretation of a conjunction just in case there is an assignment\nfunction k such that \\(\\langle g,k\\rangle\\); is in the\ninterpretation of the left conjunct and \\(\\langle k,h\\rangle\\); the\nright\n conjunct.[17]\n So note how interpreting the left conjunct changes the input sequence\nfor the interpretation of the right conjunct. Again, this means that\nconjunction is internally dynamic, possibly affecting the\ninterpretation of expressions in its scope. And again, that the output\nof interpreting a conjunction, here h, can differ from the\ninput, here g, means that a conjunction is capable of affecting\nthings outside of it and hence outside of the scope of that\nconjunction sign. Again, this is to say that conjunction is externally\ndynamic. \nTo go through an example, we also need to understand the semantics of\nan atomic formula like “man x”. Atomic formulas act\nlike a test on the input assignments, allowing those assignments that\nsatisfy the condition to pass through and act as input to subsequent\nassignments and rejecting the rest. However, atomic formulas do not\nchange assignment functions. More specifically, an input\noutput pair \\(\\langle g,h\\rangle\\) is in the interpretation of an\natomic formula “\\(Rt_1 \\ldots t_n\\)” just in case \\(h=g\\)\nand h assigns “\\(t_1\\)”…\n“\\(t_n\\)” to something in the interpretation of\nR. \nPutting these elements all together, we are now in a position to see\nhow DPL accounts for (27b). Informally speaking, the first sentence of\n(27b) takes all the input assignment functions g and outputs\nall those assignments h in that they differ at most from\ng in assigning “x” to a man who loves Annie.\nThus the output of the first sentence is all (and only) the possible\nassignments of “x” (given the model) to men who\nlove Annie. The output of the first sentence is the input to the\nsecond. The second sentence tests these assignments, allowing only\nthose through which also assign “x” to something in\nthe interpretation of “rich”. The output of the second\nsentence includes all and only the assignments of\n“x” to rich men who love Annie. As long as the\nmodel includes at least one rich man who loves Annie, there will be at\nleast one such output assignment. Hence the discourse is true iff\nthere is at least one rich man who loves Annie. Since conjunction is\nexternally dynamic, we can keep adding sentences with anaphoric\npronouns to similar effect. Thus in a discourse such as \nthe discourse is all true iff some rich famous man loves Annie. \nThus the dynamic semantic treatment yields a truth conditional\nequivalence between \n\n\\[\n(\\exists x)(\\Phi) \\mathbin{\\&} \\Psi \n\\]\n\n and \n\n\\[\n(\\exists x)(\\Phi \\mathbin{\\&} \\Psi) \n\\]\n\n even when\n“\\(\\Psi\\)” contains free occurrences of\n“x”. Hence it is often said that in DPL quantifiers\nsemantically bind free variables outside their syntactic\nscope. This doesn’t encounter the same problems as the syntactic\nbinding treatment rejected in\n section 2,\n since it allows quantifiers to provide values for subsequent\nanaphoric pronouns without actually binding them in a way that falsely\npredicts, e.g., that “Exactly one man loves Annie. He is\nrich” is truth-conditionally equivalent to\n\\(\\mbox{“}(\\exists !x)(\\mbox{man } x \\mathbin{\\&} x \\mbox{\nloves Annie} \\mathbin{\\&} x \\mbox{ is rich})\\mbox{”}\\). \nBecause the treatment of donkey anaphora is a bit more complicated\ntechnically, and because some of the main ideas of DPL are now on the\ntable, we will be more suggestive here. Again, we urge the interested\nreader to consult Groenendijk and Stokhof (1991) directly. \nFirst, consider conditional donkey anaphora: \n(32) gets regimented in DPL as follows: \nThere are three crucial points to the DPL treatment here. (1) The\nexistential quantifier is externally dynamic and hence may affect the\ninterpretation of variables outside its scope, and in particular\n“x” in the consequent of (32a). (2)\n“\\(\\rightarrow\\)” is internally dynamic and allows the\ninterpretation of its antecedent to affect the interpretation of its\nconsequent (just as is conjunction). 1 and 2 together mean that the\nquantifier in the antecedent of (32)/(32a) can semantically bind the\nvariable in the consequent, even though it is not in the syntactic\nscope of the quantifier. But without doing anything further, we would\nbe left with (32a) having the truth conditions of \nwhere “\\(\\rightarrow\\)” is the standard material\nconditional. This doesn’t give the intuitive truth conditions of\n(32) on the reading that concerns us, i.e., that every donkey-owning\nfarmer beats every donkey he owns. The third and final element we need\nto get the truth conditions to come out right is to say that a pair of\nassignments \\(\\langle h,h\\rangle\\) is in the interpretation of a\nconditional iff for all k such that \\(\\langle h,k\\rangle\\)\nsatisfies the antecedent, there is a j such that \\(\\langle\nk,j\\rangle\\) satisfies the\n consequent.[18]\n This says, roughly, that for any output assignment k of a pair\nof assignments satisfying the antecedent of the conditional\n(assignment of a donkey-owning farmer to x and a donkey owned\nby x to y in the case of (32)/(32a)), k is the\ninput of a pair \\(\\langle k,j\\rangle\\) that satisfies the consequent,\nfor some j. Since the consequent of the conditional in\n(32)/(32a) is an atomic formula, j=k. So the account\nclaims that any output of a pair of sequences that satisfies the\nexistentially quantified antecedent also satisfies “x\nbeats y”, and so also assigns to “x”\nand “y” to something that stands in the beating\nrelation. That is, the truth of (32)/(32a) requires every\ndonkey-owning farmer to beat every donkey he owns. \nTurning now to our relative clause donkey sentence, (repeated\nhere) \nwe shall be even more schematic. This gets regimented in DPL as\nfollows, (giving the predicate letters here the obvious meanings): \nNote in particular that the “y” in\n“Bxy” is not in the scope of the existential\nquantifier. Now given a quite straightforward treatment of the\nuniversal quantifier, on which it allows dynamic effects in its\n scope,[19]\n in all essentials, the example works like (32)/(32a). For stripping\nthe universal quantifier away, we have: \nAnd overlooking the free variables left by stripping away the\nuniversal quantifier (which anyway were in its scope and bound by it),\nwe simply have another conditional with an existential quantifier in\nits antecedent and a formula in the consequent containing an\noccurrence of the variable of that existential quantifier. So the\ntreatment goes essentially as it did for (32)/(32a) itself, with the\nexternally dynamic existential quantifier, internally dynamic\nconditional, and universal quantification over assignments in the\nsemantics of the conditional all working their magic so that\n(26)’s truth requires every donkey owning woman to beat every\ndonkey she owns. \nThough DPL cannot handle relative clause donkey sentences such as: \nsince it is working within the framework of a first order logic\nwithout generalized quantifiers, this is only a limitation of this\nparticular formulation and not of dynamic approaches generally. Others\nhave formulated systems of dynamic semantics with generalized\nquantifiers that are capable of dealing with examples like\n (33).[20] \nOn the other hand, DPL and dynamic approaches generally do face a\nproblem. Put crudely, DPL (and dynamic approaches generally) solve the\nproblems of discourse and donkey anaphora by formulating semantics for\nquantifiers that allows quantifiers to semantically bind variables\nthat aren’t in their syntactic scopes. In this they\n(self-consciously) resemble DRT. But then they face a problem similar\nto one faced by DRT and mentioned above. Consider again our discourse\n (18), repeated here \nAs mentioned above, (18) has a reading on which the second sentence of\nthe discourse attributes a general belief to Scott (something like the\nbelief that a man who broke into Sarah’s apartment came in\nthrough the window). On a dynamic approach to (18), the quantifier in\nthe first sentence semantically binds the variable in the second\nsentence. But then this semantically amounts to quantification into\nthe verb of attitude, and so will not result in a reading of the\nsecond sentence on which it attributes a general belief to Scott.\nHence, dynamic approaches need to invoke some other mechanism to get\nthe reading of the second sentence in\n question.[21] \nSimilarly, again consider the following sentences discussed in\nconnection with DRT above : \nAs mentioned there, these sentences also appear to have readings on\nwhich they attribute general or de dicto beliefs to the women\nin question. That is, they have readings on which they attribute to\nthe women in question general beliefs to the effect that they\nare being stalked by secret admirers. This is why these sentences can\nbe true even though the women in question don’t know who their\nsecret admirers are, and so have no beliefs about particular\npersons stalking them. For reasons exactly similar to those given for\nthe case of the analogous reading of the second sentence of (18),\nthese readings can’t be captured by DPL or dynamic approaches\ngenerally. \nPaul Elbourne (2005) reviews three other serious problems for dynamic\napproaches. The first is the problem of disjunctive antecedents\n(discussed in detail in Stone 1992). The problem is with sentences\nlike the following: \nThis is problematic because the pronouns cannot co-refer with the\nantecedent (since it is disjunctive), but the antecedent also does not\nintroduce any suitable variables or quantifiers to provide values for\nthe pronouns, since they are definites (names) and not indefinites or\nother quantificational expressions. \nThe other two problems involve anaphoric pronouns that don’t\nhave a proper linguistic antecedent. The following example, originally\nfrom Jacobson (2000), is one in which there is no linguistic\nantecedent for the pronoun “it”, though the pronoun has a\ncovarying interpretation with the quantifier “most faculty\nmembers”: \nThe second kind of example involves what is commonly called a\npaycheck pronoun: \nThe problematic (salient) reading is the one is which everybody else\nput their own paychecks in the bank. The first sentence only\nintroduces John’s paycheck, hence “it”\ndoesn’t have a proper antecedent. Dynamic accounts simply\ndon’t have the machinery for dealing with pronouns without the\nproper linguistic antecedent, since it is the antecedent’s\neffect on the context that accounts for the anaphoric pronoun’s\n interpretation.[22] \nThere have been many accounts of the semantics of anaphora according\nto which anaphoric pronouns in some sense function like definite\ndescriptions. Though there are important differences between such\ntheories, examples of theories of this sort include Evans (1977),\nParsons (1978, Other Internet Resources), Davies (1981), Neale (1990),\nHeim (1990) and Elbourne (2005). Theories of this sort are often\ncalled E-Type or\nD-type approaches. Though it is beyond the scope of this\narticle to compare all the different accounts, some of the main\ndifferences in types of accounts are as follows. E-type accounts are\nusually distinguished as ones in which a definite description fixes\nthe referent of an anaphoric pronoun. By contrast, D-type accounts are\nones in which the pronoun itself has the semantics of a definite\ndescription. These are further sub-divided into those that treat\npronouns as definite descriptions merely at the level of semantics and\nthose that also treat them as descriptions at the level of syntax.\nFinally, accounts differ in how the descriptive material is recovered.\nSome accounts hold that the descriptive material has to be recovered\nlinguistically, from prior discourse. Others hold that it can be any\ncontextually salient description. \nWe will discuss two of the best known versions of the view, Neale\n(1990) and Elbourne (2005). We should add that though Neale developed\nthe view in question in greater detail, Davies (1981) had earlier\ndefended essentially the same view in all crucial\n respects.[23]\n Thus, the view we go on to describe should probably be called the\nDavies-Neale view. But since we shall focus on Neale’s\npresentation of the view, we shall talk of Neale’s view. \nOn Neale’s view, in all instances of problematic anaphora,\nanaphoric pronouns “go proxy for” definite descriptions\nunderstood as quantifiers along roughly Russellian lines. First,\nconsider discourse anaphora. Neale’s view is that in a discourse\nsuch as: \nthe pronoun “it” “goes proxy for” the definite\ndescription “the donkey John bought.” Hence the second\nsentence of such a discourse is equivalent to the sentence\n“Harry vaccinated the donkey John bought” with the\ndescription understood in the standard Russellian fashion. Within a\ngeneralized quantifier type framework, where “the” is\ntreated as a determiner that, like other determiners, combines with a\nset term to form a quantified NP, the evaluation clause for sentences\ncontaining a singular description (with wide scope) can be given as\nfollows \nSo the second sentence of (37) is true iff Harry vaccinated the unique\ndonkey John bought. Thus far, then, the view is that pronouns\nanaphoric on singular indefinites are interpreted as Russellian\ndefinite descriptions. \nThere is, however, a further complication in Neale’s theory that\nis invoked in the explanation of donkey anaphora. In particular, Neale\nintroduces what he calls a “numberless description”: a\ndescription that, unlike semantically singular descriptions, puts no\ncardinality constraint on the denotation of the set term that combines\nwith the determiner to form the quantified NP (other than that it must\nbe nonempty—note above how in the singular case \\(|\\mathbf{F}|\\)\nis constrained to equal one.) Following Neale, let “whe”\nbe the determiner (corresponding to “the”) used to form\n“numberless descriptions.” Then the evaluation clause for\nsentences containing numberless descriptions, analogous to (38) above,\nwould be \nThus numberless descriptions are in effect universal quantifiers. \nIn addition to going proxy for Russellian singular descriptions in the\nway we have seen, Neale claims that anaphoric pronouns sometimes go\nproxy for numberless descriptions. In particular, Neale holds that\npronouns anaphoric on singular existential quantifiers (but outside of\ntheir scope) can be interpreted either as standard Russellian\ndescriptions or as numberless descriptions. Now if the\npronouns in our conditional and relative clause donkey sentences\n(repeated here) \nare interpreted as a numberless description, (25) asserts that if\nSarah owns a donkey, she beats all the donkeys she owns and (26)\nasserts that every donkey owning woman beats every donkey she owns.\nThus, Neale’s account of donkey anaphora requires the pronouns\nhere to be interpreted as numberless descriptions. \nHaving seen how Neale’s theory handles discourse anaphora and\ndonkey anaphora, we turn to difficulties with the account. An obvious\nquestion concerning an account like this that allows pronouns\nanaphoric on singular existential quantifiers to go proxy for both\nRussellian and numberless descriptions is: what determines\nwhether such a pronoun is going proxy for a Russellian, as opposed to\na numberless, description? This question is pressing for Neale’s\naccount, since there will be a substantial difference in the truth\nconditions of a pronoun-containing sentence depending on whether the\npronoun receives a numberless or Russellian interpretation. In his\nmost explicit statement about the matter (1990: 237) Neale makes clear\nthat it is primarily whether the utterer had a particular individual\nin mind in uttering the indefinite description that determines whether\na pronoun anaphoric on it receives a Russellian or a numberless\n interpretation.[24] \nIf this is correct, then discourses of the form \ngenerally ought to display both readings (in the suitable contexts),\ndepending on whether the utterer of the discourse had a particular\nindividual in mind in uttering “A(n) F”. So the\nsecond sentences of discourses of the form of (40) ought to have\nreadings on which they mean the unique F that is G is\nH (Russellian) and on which they mean every F\nthat is G is H (numberless). But this does not seem to\nbe the case. In particular, such discourses do not have readings\ncorresponding to the numberless interpretation of the pronoun.\nConsider the discourse anaphora analogue of the donkey conditional\n(25): \nIt seems clear that this discourse has no reading on which the second\nsentence means that Sarah beats every donkey she owns, even if we\nimagine that the utterer of the discourse had no particular donkey in\nmind when she uttered the first sentence. Suppose, for example, that\nthe Homeland Security and Donkey Care Bureau comes to town and wants\ninformation about local donkey ownership and beating. The speaker\ntells them that she really don’t know how many donkeys anybody\nowns, and has never seen or had any other contact with particular\nlocal donkeys. But she tells them that she has received some\ninformation from reliable sources and it has been deemed\n“credible”. Asked what she has heard, she responds:\n“Sarah owns a donkey and she beats it”. \nEven though she has no particular donkey in mind in uttering these\nsentences, we simply don’t get a numberless reading here. If\nSarah beats some donkey she owns, the speaker has spoken truly even if\nshe owns others she fails to beat. Or again, suppose we are debating\nwhether anybody has an eight track tape player anymore, and one of us\nsays “I’ll bet the following is true: some guy with a\n‘68 Camaro owns an eight track player and he still uses\nit.” Again, there is no numberless reading for the pronoun in\nthe second sentence, even though the speaker clearly has no particular\neight-track player in mind. If some ‘68 Camaro driving guy owns\nand uses an eight-track player, the sentence is true even if he owns\nother eight track players that aren’t\n used.[25] \nSo it appears that Neale’s account has no explanation of why the\npronouns in discourses like (25a) never have numberless readings.\nNeale’s account has similar problems with sentences like: \nHere again, Neale’s theory predicts that this sentence has a\nreading on which its truth requires that some woman beats every donkey\nshe owns. And again, even if we imagine the sentence being uttered\nwithout any particular woman or donkey in mind, we don’t get\nthis reading of the sentence predicted by Neale’s theory, (say\nwe are discussing women’s tendencies towards animals they own,\nand one of us utters (41) simply thinking it is statistically likely\nto be true). So Neale’s account has no explanation as to why the\nsecond sentence of discourse (25a) and sentence (41) lack the relevant\nreadings assigned to those sentences by his theory. \nElbourne (2005) proposes a different D-type theory. The main thesis of\nthe book is that pronouns of all types, proper names, and definite\ndescriptions have a unified syntax and semantics: they are all of type\n\\(\\langle s, e\\rangle\\) (functions from situations to individuals) and\nare syntactically comprised of a definite determiner that takes two\narguments: an index and an NP (noun phrase).  \nHis theory of unbound pronouns is NP-deletion theory.\nNP-deletion is when an NP at the level of syntax is (felicitously)\nunpronounced at the surface level as in: \nOn Elbourne’s theory, pronouns undergo obligatory\nNP-deletion. That is, a sentence like\n (25),\n at the level of syntax is actually (25b): \nFollowing Elbourne, we’ll suppress mention of the index, since\nit doesn’t do any work here (anaphoric pronouns have a null\nindex on his view, though he does provide arguments for why this null\nindex is present—see Elbourne (2005: 118–126)). Pronouns\nhave the same semantics as the determiner “the”\n(abstracting away from the phi-features of pronouns) so that (25b) has\nthe same semantics as (25c): \nThis is motivated by the insight that pronouns pattern with\nminimal definite descriptions rather than long ones, as other\nD-type theories have it. For example, a theory like Neale’s\npredicts that (43a) has the semantics of (43b): \nBut this is problematic, because (43a) clearly has a salient, true\nreading, whereas (43b) does not. However, Elbourne observes that (43c)\nhas the same salient true reading as (43a): \nTreating pronouns as determiners is motivated more generally by Postal\n(1966)’s arguments\nthat they at least sometimes have the same semantics as determiners\nbased on examples such as: \nFinally, positing an NP-deletion theory provides an elegant solution\nto the problem of the formal link, which is that any good account of\nanaphora has to explain why (45a) is felicitous but (46b) is not: \nSince NP-deletion generally requires a linguistic antecedent, if\npronouns are determiners that have undergone NP-deletion, this\nexplains the contrast.  \nAs mentioned above, pronouns have the semantics of determiners.\nSpecifically, Elbourne proposes a situation semantics\n (situations in natural language semantics),\n where the semantics of pronouns (and determiners) are treated in a\nFregean way, as follows: \nThat is to say, pronouns come with presuppositions that there is a\nunique individual in each situation that satisfies the predicate, and\n(when that presupposition is satisfied), they refer to that individual\n(in that situation). Conditional donkey anaphora works as follows. A\nsentence like (47) has the structure at LF of (48): \nThe semantics of “always” is crucial to getting the truth\nconditions right: \n\\([[\\mbox{always}]]^g = \\lambda p_{\\langle s,t\\rangle}. \\lambda\nq_{\\langle s,t\\rangle}. \\lambda s\\). for every minimal situation\n\\(s'\\) such that \\(s' \\le s\\) and \\(p(s') = 1\\), there is a situation\n\\(s''\\) such that \\(s'' \\le s\\) and \\(s''\\) is a minimal situation\nsuch that \\(s' \\le s''\\) and \\(q(s'') = 1\\)  \nBasically, “always” takes two sentences, and returns true\niff every minimal situation that satisfies the first sentence has a\nminimal extension that satisfies the second sentence. A minimal\nsituation is one that contains one or more thin\nparticulars—an individual abstracted away from its\nproperties—and one or more properties or relations that the thin\nparticular(s) instantiate(s). An extension of a minimal situation\nincludes all those same particulars and properties and relations, with\n(possibly) some more particulars, properties, or relations in\naddition. On Elbourne’s account “if” doesn’t\nplay any role in contributing to the truth conditions of a donkey\nconditional; it is semantically vacuous. It is the (sometimes silent)\nadverb of quantification along with the semantics of the antecedent\nand consequent that do the work in yielding the truth conditions. The\nfollowing are the truth conditions for (47) on Elbourne’s\naccount. (We won’t go through the derivation for relative clause\ndonkey anaphora, but it works similarly. See Elbourne 2005: 53.) \nThus on Elbourne’s account (47) is true iff each donkey-owning\nman beats every donkey he owns. \nElbourne surprisingly never goes through a derivation of a case of\ncross-sentential anaphora as in: \nHis view is that this has the same semantics as (49a): \nBut he doesn’t provide an account of how this works, neither in\ndescription nor detailed derivation. One worry about this is that in\nthe conditional and relative clause donkey sentences, the fact that\nthe pronoun(s) co-varies with its antecedent is accounted for by\n“always” and “every”. These expressions\nquantify over situations in a way that guarantees that the man who\nbeats the donkey is the same man who owns that same donkey,\neffectively acting as (semantic) binding. But there is no such\nmechanism in place to guarantee that “the woman” in (the\nsituation in) the second sentence of (49) in any sense co-varies with\nthe woman (in the situation) in the first. It is not clear how\nElbourne’s view can accomplish this without employing either a\ndynamic notion of binding or a more traditional d-type account with\ncomplete descriptions (Though for why even more typical d-type\naccounts face a similar problem, see Lewis 2013). \nHowever, Elbourne’s account doesn’t encounter the same\nproblem as Neale’s in predicting numberless readings where there\nare none, as he doesn’t posit a numberless interpretation of the\npronoun at all. This highlights a difference between the way that\nNeale’s theory approaches the truth conditions of conditional\ndonkey sentences and the way DRT, dynamic semantics, the CDQ theory\n(discussed in the next section) and other D-type theories like\nElbourne’s and Heim (1990)’s do (Heim 1990 also employs a\nsituation semantics to account for conditional donkey anaphora). In\nthese other theories, the requirement that all the donkey-owning men\nbeat all the donkeys they own for (47) to be true arises due to the\ninteraction of the semantic of indefinites, the semantics of anaphoric\npronouns and the semantics of\n conditionals.[27]\n Indeed, it is the latter that is primarily implicated in (47)’s\ntruth requiring that all donkeys owned by donkey-owning men\nbe beaten (since the theories posit some sort of universal\nquantification in the semantics of conditionals). By contrast, on\nNeale’s view, the requirement that the men beat all the donkeys\nthey own for (47) to be true (on one of its readings) essentially\nfalls out of the semantics of the anaphoric pronoun alone, since on\none of its readings, it expresses universal quantification over\ndonkeys Sarah owns (the numberless description reading). \nOne problem that all D-type theories must address is the problem of\nindistinguishable participants. Since on D-type theories,\npronouns in one way or another have the semantics of definite\ndescriptions, they come with uniqueness presuppositions. When it comes\nto conditional donkey anaphora, the way to meet these uniqueness\npresuppositions is by employing minimal situations—the definite\ndescription then picks out the unique object satisfying the\ndescription in the minimal situation. (With the exception of\nNeale’s theory: since he employs numberless pronouns, the\npronouns have no uniqueness presupposition.) Thus uniqueness is\nsatisfied within the situation, even if it can’t be satisfied in\nthe larger world. But in examples of indistinguishable participants,\nuniqueness cannot even be satisfied within a minimal situation.\nConsider the typical example, (50): \nIn the minimal situation that satisfies the antecedent, there are\ntwo bishops that have the same property (meeting another\nbishop). Thus descriptions like “the bishop” or\n“the bishop who meets a bishop” do not denote uniquely.\nDRT and dynamic theories don’t have any problem at all with\nthese examples because pronouns are treated as dynamically bound\nvariables, not definite descriptions, and each instance of “a\nbishop” in the antecedent of (50) is associated with a different\nvariable, which prescribe the anaphoric links to the two pronouns in\nthe consequent. For D-type solutions to this puzzle see Heim(1990),\nLudlow (1994), Elbourne (2005). \nFinally, it should be mentioned that there are some who propose\nmixed approaches, wherein some pronouns are treated as\ndynamically bound variables whereas others are treated as D-type (see\nChierchia 1995; Kurafuji 1998, 1999). On these views, some pronouns\nare ambiguous between the two readings, while others have only the\ndynamically bound variable or D-type reading. This type of theory\navoids many of the problems raised for each type of account, since\nthey use dynamic semantics for the examples most amenable to a dynamic\nexplanation and d-type pronouns for example most amenable to that sort\nof explanation. However, the theory comes at a considerable\ntheoretical cost in that it predicts a systematic ambiguity in\npronouns that is (arguably) not explicitly marked in any language.\n(See Elbourne 2005 for further criticisms of these views.) \nThe Context Dependent Quantifier, or CDQ, account of anaphora was\nsuggested in Wilson (1984) and subsequently developed in King (1987,\n1991,\n 1994).[28]\n The idea underlying the application of CDQ to discourse anaphora is\nthat these expressions look like quantifier-like expressions of\ngenerality, where the precise nature of the generality they express is\ndetermined by features of the linguistic context in which they occur.\nOn the CDQ account, anaphoric pronouns with quantifier antecedents in\ndiscourse anaphora are contextually sensitive devices of\nquantification. That is, these anaphoric pronouns express\nquantifications; and which quantifications they\nexpress is partly a function of the linguistic environments\nin which they are embedded. Consider the following discourses: \nLooking at (51), suppose that in fact at least one Swede has soloed\nMt. Everest without oxygen. Then it would seem that the sentences of\n(51) are true. If this is correct, then it appears that the second\nsentence of (51) expresses a (existentially) general claim.\nCDQ claims that the pronoun “He” in the second sentence is\nitself a (existential) quantifier, and this explains why the second\nsentence expresses a general claim: the generality is a result of the\npresence of this quantifier in the sentence. Similar remarks apply to\n(52), (except that “They” expresses a universal\nquantifier). Further, consider the following example, which is similar\nto our example (18) above: \nThe second sentence of this discourse appears to have two different\nreadings. On one reading, it asserts that concerning the man who\nkilled Alan last night, Michelle believes of that very man\nthat he used a knife. This would be the case if, for example, Michelle\nknew the man who killed Alan, believed that he killed Alan and based\non his well-known fondness of knives, believed he used this sort of\nweapon. But the second sentence has another reading on which it\nascribes to Michelle the general belief to the effect that a man\nkilled Alan with a knife last night. On this reading the sentence\nwould be true if e.g., on the basis of conversations with personnel at\nthe hospital and having no particular person in mind, Michelle\nbelieved that a man fatally stabbed Alan last night. \nAgain, CDQ claims these facts are to be explained by holding that the\npronoun in the second sentence is a quantifier. For then we should\nexpect that, like other quantifiers, it could take wide or narrow\nscope relative to “Michelle believes”. On the wide scope\nreading of the pronoun/quantifier, the second sentence attributes to\nMichelle a belief regarding a particular person. On the narrow scope\nreading, it attributes to Michelle a general belief. \nOccurrences of “ordinary quantifiers”, such as\n“every man” have what we might call a force, in\nthis case universal; what we might call a restriction, in\nthis case the set of men; and scope relative to other\noccurrences of quantifiers, verbs of propositional attitude, and so\non. CDQ claims that the anaphoric pronouns in question also have\nforces (universal, existential, etc.), restrictions\n(“domains over which they quantify”) and scopes\nrelative to each other, verbs of propositional attitude, etc. However,\nunlike “ordinary” quantifiers, these anaphoric pronouns\nqua quantifiers have their forces, restrictions and relative scopes\ndetermined by features of their linguistic environments. King (1994)\nlays out how the forces, restrictions and relative scopes of these\nanaphoric pronouns are determined, and we shall not describe those\ndetails here. \nAs to donkey anaphora, without going through the details, let me just\nsay that CDQ assigns to a relative clause donkey sentence such as\n (26)\n above (repeated here) \ntruth conditions according to which (26) is true iff every woman who\nowns a donkey beats some donkey she owns (see King 2004 for details\nand discussion). Some think that the truth of (26) requires every\nwoman who owns a donkey to beat every donkey she owns, and as\nwe saw, DRT, DPL, and the D-type theories discussed assign these truth\nconditions to (26) (though this is not an essential feature of DRT or\ndynamic semantic approaches more generally). The truth conditions CDQ\nassigns to (26) correspond to what is often called the weak\nreading of donkey sentences (Chierchia (1995) calls this the\n\\(\\exists\\)-reading) and the truth conditions the accounts discussed thus far\ncorrespond to the strong reading of donkey sentences\n(Chierchia calls this the \\(\\forall\\)-reading). There actually has been a debate\nin the literature as to which truth conditions sentences like (26)\nhave. There are sentences that are exactly like (26) except for the\ndescriptive material in them that clearly seem to have (only) the weak\nreading. An example is: \nIt seems clear that the truth of this sentence does not require every\nperson with a credit card to pay his bill with each credit card he\nhas. We will discuss these matters further in\n section 4,\n but for now let us simply note that CDQ differs from the other\naccounts discussed on what truth conditions should be assigned to\nsentences like (26) and (54) and that it is simply unclear which truth\nconditions are the correct ones. \nAs for conditional donkey anaphora, the CDQ account is rather\ncomplicated and we are only able to provide the briefest outline of\nthe account here (interested readers should consult King 2004). As we\nsaw above, a conditional donkey sentence such as\n (25)\n  \nis true iff Sarah beats every donkey she owns. Thus, “a\ndonkey” somehow seems to have ended up with universal force. The\nCDQ account holds that this illusion of universal force for the\nindefinite is really the result of the interaction of the semantics of\nthe conditional, the indefinite, understood as an existential\nquantifier, and the CDQ “she”, understood as a\ncontext dependent quantifier with existential force ranging over\ndonkeys Sarah owns. Roughly, the account goes as follows. The\nantecedent of (25) is equivalent to \nGiven the CDQ “it” and its context in (25), the consequent\nof (25) is equivalent to \nThe semantics of the conditional involves universal quantification\nover minimal situations. In particular, a conditional claims that for\nevery minimal situation \\(s_1\\) in which its antecedent is true, there\nis a situation \\(s_2\\) that \\(s_1\\) is part of in which its consequent\nis true. In the case of (25), a minimal situation in which the\nantecedent is true consists of Sarah and a single donkey she owns. The\nfinal element here is that the definiteness and/or anaphoricness of\nthe CDQ “it” in the consequent of (25) makes a difference\nto its truth conditions. The definiteness and anaphoricness of\n“it” in (25) induces a sort of “familiarity\n effect”.[29]\n In particular, for any (minimal) \\(s_1\\) in which the antecedent is\ntrue, there must be an \\(s_2\\) that \\(s_1\\) is part of in which the\nconsequent (understood as expressing the claim that Sarah beats a\ndonkey she owns) is true. But in addition, because of the\n“familiarity” condition induced by the anaphoric definite\n“it”, there must be a donkey in \\(s_2\\) that is also in\n\\(s_1\\) and that makes the consequent true. In other words,\nfamiliarity requires that a donkey that makes the CDQ-containing\nconsequent true in \\(s_2\\) also be present in \\(s_1\\). In this sense,\nthe donkey is “familiar”, having been introduced by the\nantecedent and the situation \\(s_1\\) in which it is true. To see what\nthis means, consider a situation \\(s_1\\) that is a minimal situation\nin which the antecedent is true. \\(s_1\\) consists of Sarah owning a\nsingle donkey. If e.g., Sarah owns ten donkeys, there are ten such\nminimal situations. For (25) to be true, each such \\(s_1\\) must be\npart of a situation \\(s_2\\) such that \\(s_2\\) is a situation in which\nSarah beats a donkey that she owns and that is in \\(s_1\\). Now the\nonly way that every minimal \\(s_1\\) in which Sarah owns a donkey can\nbe part of an \\(s_2\\) in which Sarah beats a donkey she owns in\n\\(s_1\\) is if Sarah beats every donkey she owns. Thus, the CDQ account\nclaims that (25) is true iff Sarah beats every donkey she owns. \nTurning now to difficulties with CDQ, a main difficulty is that it\nisn’t clear whether the use of the notion of\nfamiliarity in the account of conditional donkey sentences\ncan be ultimately upheld. Recall that the idea was that because\n“it” is a definite NP, and because definite NPs generally\nare thought to involve some sort of familiarity, the pronoun in the\ndonkey conditional induces a sort of familiarity effect. There are\nreally two distinct problems here. One is that though the pronoun\n“it” is “syntactically” definite in that the\npronoun “it” is thought to be a definite NP, according to\nCDQ it is “semantically” indefinite in (25), since it\nexpresses an existential quantification (over donkeys owned by Sarah).\nBut then if “it” really is semantically indefinite in\n(25), why should it induce familiarity effects at all? (Jason Stanley\n(p.c.) raised this difficulty). One might reply that it is the fact\nthat “it” is “syntactically” definite that\ntriggers the familiarity effects CDQ posits. But familiarity probably\nis not well enough understood to allow us to assess this response. A\nsecond, and perhaps more pressing, difficulty is this. Generally,\nfamiliarity has something to do with whether what an expression is\nbeing used to talk about is familiar or salient to the audience being\naddressed. This is vague, of course, but the idea is that if one says\n“The dog is hungry” to an audience who isn’t even\naware of any dog that is around or relevant to the conversation, the\nremark is somewhat infelicitous. That is because the definite NP\n“The dog” was used to talk about something not familiar to\nthe audience. Now the question is: is it plausible to claim that this\nand related phenomena are related to the rather complex effect CDQ\nclaims is induced by the anaphoricness/definiteness of\n“it” in donkey conditionals? In the latter case, CDQ\nclaims the effect of familiarity is to make the CDQ “it”\nin the consequent of donkey conditionals quantify over donkeys in the\nminimal situations introduced by the antecedents of the conditionals\n(in the case of (25), situations consisting of Sarah and a single\ndonkey she owns). The CDQ can only quantify over\n“familiar” donkeys—those introduced by the\nantecedent. One may well wonder whether the effect CDQ posits here can\nreally be seen to be a manifestation of phenomena that have\ntraditionally been explained in terms of familiarity. \nWe have already mentioned that there is some disagreement regarding\nthe truth conditions of sentences like \nSome think that the truth of (26) requires every woman who owns a\ndonkey to beat every donkey she owns. As mentioned above,\nthis is called the strong reading of a donkey sentence.\nOthers think that the truth of (26) requires that every donkey owning\nwoman beats some donkey she owns. As above, this is the\nweak reading of (26). As we mentioned above, there are\nsentences that are exactly like (26) except for the descriptive\nmaterial in them that clearly seem to have (only) the weak reading.\nThe example we gave was: \nIt seems clear that the truth of this sentence does not require every\nperson with a credit card to pay his bill with each credit card he\nhas, but merely with some credit card he has. Our comments to this\npoint have suggested that the debate with respect to (26)/(54) and\nweak vs. strong readings is over which one of the two sets of truth\nconditions (26)/(54) have. Each of the theories discussed in this\nentry only assign one of the existential or universal truth\nconditions to relative clause donkey sentences (though this may be\nmore of an artifact of the specific implementations of the theories\nthan the theories themselves). \nBut some think that (at least some) donkey sentences have\nboth weak and strong readings. Chierchia (1994) and Kanazawa\n(1994b) are examples. In their favor, for a given determiner, one can\nfind pairs of relative clause donkey sentences fronted by that\ndeterminer such that one has the existential truth conditions (on its\nmost natural interpretation) and the other has the universal truth\nconditions (on its most natural reading). For example, consider the\nfollowing pairs: \nElbourne, for example, explicitly addresses this issue, since his\nsemantics captures only the strong reading. He claims that while this\nmay present a problem for his semantics, it is not a problem for\nNP-deletion theory more generally, since replacing the pronoun in a\ntypical weak reading example with a minimal definite description also\nyields a weak reading, e.g.: \nHowever, he doesn’t present an account of how this reading might\nbe captured. \nThese examples and others suggest that whether a given relative clause\ndonkey sentence appears to favor the strong reading or weak reading is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including the monotonicity\nproperties of the determiner on the wide scope quantifier, the lexical\nsemantics of the predicates occurring in the sentence, and general\nbackground assumptions concerning the situations in which we are to\nconsider the truth or falsity of the sentences. However, it is very\nhard to find significant generalizations regarding under what\nconditions a given reading is\n favored.[30]\n Further, it is very hard to find sentences that clearly allow both a\nstrong and a weak reading. This makes the view that the sentences\nactually possess both readings as a matter of their semantics at least\nsomewhat suspect. If they really do possess both readings, why is it\nso hard to find sentences that clearly allow both readings? And\nfinally, relative clause donkey sentences fronted by the determiner\n“some” seem always to only have the existential truth\nconditions: \nObviously, the facts here are quite complicated. \nBrasoveanu (2006, 2007, 2008) points out that there are also\nmixed readings of donkey sentences, such as: \nSentence (59) intuitively is true iff for every book that a\ncredit-card owner buys on amazon.com, there is some credit\ncard or other that she uses to pay for the book. Hence the mixed\nstrong and weak reading. Brasoveanu accounts for these readings, along\nwith the weak/strong ambiguity in general, within his system of Plural\nCompositional Discourse Representation Theory (PCDRT) by positing an\nambiguity at the level of indefinites. In his account, indefinites are\nunderspecified as to the presence of a maximization operator (which is\npresent in the strong indefinite but not the weak); the decision of\nwhich indefinite to use in a specific case is a “context-driven\nonline process”. \nTheories that assign both sets of truth conditions to relative clause\ndonkey sentences generally do so by positing some sort of ambiguity,\neither in the quantifiers, the pronouns, or the\n indefinites.[31]\n Though the matter isn’t entirely clear, it seems plausible that\nthe theories discussed in this entry also may be able to assign both\nthe universal and the existential truth conditions to relative clause\ndonkey sentences by positing some sort of ambiguity. These matters\nrequire further\n investigation.[32] \nAnother recent development in the study of anaphora comes from a\nseries of papers by Philippe Schlenker on anaphora in sign language,\nparticularly ASL (American Sign Language) and LSF (French Sign\nLanguage) (2010, 2011, 2012a,b, 2013a,b, 2014, 2015). In sign\nlanguage, an antecedent is associated with a particular position in\nsigning space called a locus, and an anaphoric link to the\nantecedent is obtained by pointing at that same locus. Unlike spoken\nlanguages, which have a limited number of lexically encoded pronouns,\nin sign language there seems to be no upper bound on how many loci can\nsimultaneously be used, aside from limitations of performance (since\nsigners have to remember what the loci are assigned to, and be able to\ndistinguish one from another). Schlenker (2015) gives an example of a\nshort discourse that involves 7 distinct loci. Given their unbounded\nnumber and their overt connection to antecedents, Schlenker (as well\nas others) posits that they are the overt realization of formal\nindices, i.e., the variables that mark anaphoric connections in\ntheories like DRT and dynamic semantics. Despite their differences,\nsign language and spoken language pronouns have enough in common that\na uniform theory is desirable, and Schlenker argues that sign language\nprovides evidence applicable to at least two debates in the anaphora\nliterature. First, there is good evidence that in sign language, there\nis a single system of anaphora using loci for denoting individuals,\ntimes, and worlds. This provides evidence in favor of those who think\nthat there are temporal and modal variables and pronouns in spoken\nlanguage. Second, Schlenker argues that the use of loci, which look\nlike an overt use of indices, very much resembles the dynamic semantic\naccount of pronominal anaphora since antecedents introduce variables\n(loci) and anaphoric connections are made by repeating the same\nvariables (loci). Just as in spoken language, this occurs even when\nthe anaphoric pronouns are outside the syntactic scope of their\nantecedents. Furthermore, according to Schlenker one of the most\ndecisive examples is the bishop example\n (50),\n repeated here: \nIn sign language, the only way to obtain the intended reading of the\nsentence is for the pronouns to index different antecedents. This\nshows that a theory need not only get the truth conditions right (as\nsome D-type theories can), but must account for the formal link\nbetween each antecedent and pronoun. For criticism of the thesis that\nloci are overt variables see Kuhn (forthcoming).  \nThe second major conclusion from Schlenker’s research is that\nsign language pronouns have an iconic element. For example,\nthe verb “ask” is signed near the chin/neck area of a\nlocus. If the locus denotes a person standing on a branch,\n“ask” is signed at a fairly high spot in the locus. If the\nlocus denotes a person hanging upside-down from a branch,\n“ask” is signed lower in the locus. This and many other\nexamples of iconicity in pronouns provides evidence that there needs\nto be an account of iconicity integrated into the formal\nsemantics.","contact.mail":"jcking310@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2004-02-24","date.changed":"2016-05-06","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaphora/","author1":"Jeffrey C.

For example, in some sense of “interpretation”,\nthe interpretation of the expression “bank” in the\nfollowing sentence depends on the interpretation of other expressions\n(in particular, “of the river”):\n\n(1) John is\ndown by the bank of the river.\n\nBut no one would say this is an example of anaphora. And as to the\nsecond characterization, though all agree that the following is an\nexample of anaphora (and “he” is an anaphoric pronoun here\non one reading of the sentence), it is not a case of the\nreferent of one expression being supplied by another\nexpression, (since “he” is not a referring expression on\nthe reading in question):\n\n(2) Every male\nlawyer believes he is smart.\n\nHence, rather than attempting to characterize anaphora generally and\nabstractly, we shall begin with some examples. There is generally\nthought to be many types of anaphora, though in some cases there is\ndisagreement as to whether to classify those cases as anaphora or\n not.[2]\n \n\n\n\nPronominal anaphora:\n\n(3) John left.\nHe said he was ill. (The antecedent is “John” and the\nanaphoric expression is “he”.)\n\nVP anaphora (also called VP ellipsis):\n\n(4) Mary Anne\ntook out the garbage. Claudia did too. (The antecedent is “took\nout the garbage” and the anaphoric expression a null VP. See\nPartee and Bach (1984), Prüst et al. (1994).)\n\nPropositional anaphora:\n\n(5) One\nplaintiff was passed over for promotion three times. But the jury\ndidn’t believe this. (The antecedent is the proposition\nexpressed by the first sentence. The anaphoric expression is\n“this”. Example from Asher and Lascarides\n(2003).)\n\nAdjectival anaphora:\n\n(6) A kind\nstranger returned my wallet. Such people are rare. (The antecedent is\n“kind stranger” and the anaphoric expression\n“such”.)\n\nModal anaphora:\n\n(7) John might\ngive a presentation. He would use slides. (The antecedent is the\npossibility described by the first sentence, and the anaphoric\nexpression is the modal “would”. Example from Stone and\nHardt 1999)\n\nTemporal anaphora:\n\n(8) Sheila had\na party last Friday and Sam got drunk. (The time at which Sam got\ndrunk is anaphoric on the time at which Sheila had the party. Example\nfrom Partee 1984.)\n\nKind-level anaphora:\n\n(9) John gave\na presentation. Sarah gave one too. (The antecedent is “a\npresentation”, and the anaphoric expression is\n“one”.)\n\nThe antecedent also does not always have to precede the anaphoric\nexpression; when it doesn’t, these are called cases of\ncataphora or backwards anaphora:\n\n(10) If she\ndoesn’t show up soon, Jane will be disqualified from the\ncompetition.\n\nDespite there being many kinds of anaphora, this article will focus on\npronominal anaphora, since this is the type of anaphora that has\nreceived the most attention in the linguistics and (especially)\nphilosophical literature. Some anaphoric pronouns are referring\nexpressions that inherit their referents from other referring\nexpressions. For example, on the anaphoric reading of\n (3),\n “He” inherits its referent from “John”, which\nis said to be the antecedent of the pronoun. Such anaphora is\nsimple and well understood. In cases such as\n (2)\n above, the anaphoric pronoun has as its antecedent a quantifier\n(“Every male lawyer” in (2)), and essentially functions as\na variable bound by the quantifier. Again, such cases are well\nunderstood. There are some anaphoric pronouns that cannot be\nunderstood as referring expressions that inherit their referents from\nother referring expressions, nor as variables bound by quantified\nantecedents. These cases of anaphora are of interest to philosophers\nand linguists because formulating proper semantic theories for them\nhas proved to be a difficult and interesting task. Many theories of\nthese cases are currently being advocated.\n\n\n\nThe simplest sorts of anaphoric pronouns are those that “pick\nup” a reference from a previous referring expression whether in\nthe same sentence or another. Consider for example: \non the readings of these sentences on which “he” and\n“his” co-refer with “John”. In such cases, the\npronouns are anaphoric, and the expression “John” is\ncalled the antecedent of the anaphoric expression. The\nsemantics of such anaphoric pronouns is very simple: the referent of\nthe anaphoric pronoun is the referent of its antecedent. \nAs indicated above, there are also anaphoric pronouns with quantifier\n(rather than referring expression) antecedents. Examples include\n (2)\n above and: \nAgain, on the readings of these sentences on which “he”\nand “his” “look back” to their antecedents for\ninterpretation rather than being assigned independent reference (e.g.,\nby pointing to Chris when uttering “his” in (12)). It is\nwidely held that in such cases, the pronouns function semantically as\nvariables bound by their quantifier antecedents. Thus, their semantic\nfunction is just like that of bound variables of first order logic.\n [3]\n The insight that some pronouns with quantifier antecedents function\nlike bound variables in first order logic goes back at least to Quine\n(1960, see chapter IV section 28). Historically, these cases have been\nof more interest to linguists than philosophers. For example, one\nthing that needs to be explained is that in a sentence like\n“Sarah likes her”, “Sarah” and\n“her” cannot co-refer (in order to get a co-reference\nreading, we must say “Sarah likes herself”), though we can\nget the co-reference reading (or not) in a sentence like “Sarah\nlikes her sister”. Accounting for these types of patterns of\nsentence-internal anaphora is the central concern of the area of\nlinguistics called binding theory (see May 1980; Higginbotham\nand May 1981; Chomsky 1981; Reinhardt 1983a,b; Büring 2005).\nThough these insights are all important, if examples like\n (3),\n (11), and\n (12)\n were the only kinds of pronominal anaphora, they currently would not\nbe of much interest to so many philosophers and linguists.  \nSignificant interest in anaphoric pronouns grew out of the realization\nthat there are anaphoric pronouns that cannot be understood as having\ntheir references fixed by their antecedents (as in\n (3)\n and\n (11)\n above) nor as being variables bound by their quantifier antecedents\n(as in\n (2)\n and\n (12)\n above). The three sorts of examples of this discussed here have\nfigured prominently in the literature on anaphora. \nFirst, there is discourse anaphora: cases in which an\nanaphoric pronoun has an antecedent in another sentence, where that\nantecedent at least appears to be a\n quantifier.[4]\n Examples include: \nThere are at least two reasons for thinking that the pronouns in (13)\nand (14) are not variables bound by their quantifier antecedents. Both\nreasons are discussed by Evans (1977). The first is that such a\ntreatment clearly yields the wrong truth conditions for examples like\n(14). If “they” is a bound variable in (14), the two\nsentences should be equivalent to \n(Or, more colloquially, “Few professors are such that they both\ncame to the party and had a good time.”) This is clearly\nincorrect, since the sentences of (14) entail that few professors\nattended the party (i.e., the first sentence entails this), whereas\n(14a) could be true if many professors\n attended.[5] \nThe second reason for thinking pronouns in cases of discourse anaphora\naren’t bound variables is that it seems committed to the claim\nthat the following anomalous sentences aren’t anomalous: \nIf the (apparent) quantifiers in\n (13)\n and\n (14)\n can bind variables in sentences after those in which they occur, why\ncan’t the quantifiers in (15) and (16)? If this could happen,\n(15) and (16) should be fine and should together be equivalent to,\nrespectively: \nBut they are not. Thus, pronouns in discourse anaphora are not\nvariables (syntactically) bound by their quantifier\n antecedents.[6] \nFurthermore, there are cases of (plural) anaphora in which the\ndenotation of “they” is derived in a more indirect way\nfrom the antecedent, as in (17), an example of complement\nanaphora: \nUnlike in (14), where “they” picks out the professors who\ncame to the party, in (17), “they” picks out the students\nwho didn’t come to the party. (For more about\ncomplement anaphora, see Nouwen (2003), for complement anaphora in the\npsycholinguistics literature, see Sanford & Moxey (1993).) \nNor are these like example\n (3),\n in which the pronoun simply refers to the same thing as the\nantecedent. Indefinite descriptions like “an\nanthropologist” are commonly thought to be quantifiers, and\nexpressions like “few professors” are certainly\nquantifiers, not referring expressions. On most theories of indefinite\ndescriptions, the first sentence of\n (13)\n is true just in case there is at least one anthropologist who\ndiscovered the skeleton called “Lucy”; its truth does not\ndepend on any particular anthropologist. Thus there is no referential\nantecedent in the first sentence for the pronoun in the second\nsentence to be co-referential with. \nA further problem with thinking of these pronouns as referential can\nbe seen by considering a slightly more complex example: \nThe crucial point is that the second sentence has a reading on which\nit attributes to Scott a general belief instead of a belief about a\nparticular person. This reading would be true, for example, if Scott\nbelieved that some man broke into Sarah’s apartment by coming in\nthe window, but had no idea about who might have broken in. This is\n(prima facie) evidence that the pronoun in the second\nsentence is not a referring expression, because if it were, the second\nsentence of (18) would only have a reading on which it attributes to\nScott a belief about the particular person the pronoun refers to. But\nthis is\n incorrect.[7]\n (On the other hand, for a treatment of such de dicto\nreadings while maintaining that the pronoun is a referring expression,\nsee Elbourne 2005: 99–106.) \nThus, with pronouns in discourse anaphora, we have examples of\npronouns that can neither be understood as picking up their referents\nfrom their antecedents nor as being variables bound by their\nantecedents. Discourse anaphora provides further interesting examples\nto philosophers and linguists when the antecedents are under the scope\nof quantifiers, modals, or negation. For example, the pronouns in\n(19), (20), and (22) are infelicitous, but those in (21) and (23) are\nfelicitous. This is something further that an account of discourse\nanaphora needs to\n explain.[8] \nA second sort of anaphoric pronoun that cannot be understood as a\nreferring expression or as a bound variable is in fact a special case\nof discourse anaphora. However, it deserves separate mention because\nit has generated so much interest. Consider the following discourse,\nwhich we shall call a Geach Discourse, adapted from the\nanalogous conjunction in Geach 1967: \nThere is a reading of this discourse on which both sentences in it are\ntrue even if there are no witches, so that “a witch” in\nthe first sentence must take narrow scope with respect to “Hob\nthinks”. But then the scope of “a witch” cannot\nextend to the second sentence to bind the pronoun “she”,\nsince the “scope” of “Hob thinks”\ndoesn’t extend to the second sentence. Hence on the reading in\nquestion, which we shall call the Geach Reading, the pronoun\n“she” is not a bound variable. Further, since there are no\nwitches, and “she” is anaphoric on “a witch”,\n“she” in the second sentence must in some sense being used\nto “talk about” a non-existent witch. Thus, it apparently\ncannot be a referring term either, since its alleged referent\ndoesn’t exist. So here again we have an anaphoric pronoun that\ncannot be understood as a referring expression nor as a bound\nvariable. Examples of this sort are sometimes referred to\n(misleadingly, in our view) as instances of intentional\nidentity. \nThe third sort of case in which an anaphoric pronoun cannot be\nunderstood as a referring expression nor as a bound variable is that\nof “donkey\n anaphora”.[9]\n Here there are two varieties, which are called conditional\nand relative clause donkey sentences, respectively: \nOn the readings we are concerned with, neither (25) nor (26) is\ntalking about any particular donkey, and so the pronoun\n“it” cannot be a term referring to a particular donkey.\nFurther, in the case of (25), all independent evidence available\nsuggests that a quantifier can’t take wide scope over a\nconditional and bind variables in its consequent (*“If John owns\nevery donkeyi, he beats iti”). This\nsuggests that the (apparent) quantifier “a donkey” in (25)\ncannot bind the pronoun in the consequent. In addition, even if\n“a donkey” could magically do this in (25), assuming it is\nan existential quantifier, we still wouldn’t get the intuitive\ntruth conditions of (25), which require that Sarah beats\nevery donkey she owns. Similarly, the independent evidence\navailable suggests that quantifiers can’t scope out of relative\nclauses (*“A man who owns every donkeyi beats\niti”), and so again the pronoun in (26) is not within\nthe scope of its quantifier antecedent and so is not bound by it.\nThus, the pronouns in both conditional and relative clause donkey\nsentences can be neither understood as referring expressions nor as\nbound variables. \nSo now we have three cases of anaphoric pronouns that cannot be\nunderstood as referring expressions nor as bound variables: 1)\npronouns in discourse anaphora; 2) pronouns in Geach discourses and 3)\npronouns in (conditional and relative clause) donkey sentences.\nLet’s call these cases of problematic anaphora. The\nrecent interest in anaphora is largely an interest in finding a\nsemantic theory for problematic anaphora. In the next section, we\noutline the main theories that have arisen to fill this void. \nBefore discussing recent theories of problematic anaphora, a few\ncaveats are in order. First, our discussion will not be exhaustive. We\ncover what we take to be the best known and most promising theories.\nSecond, because each theory is a formal, sophisticated semantic\ntheory, to describe a single theory in detail would itself be a paper\nlength project. Thus, we try instead to give a simple, informal sketch\nof the main features of each theory. The notes and references point\nthe interested reader to places where he/she can get more detail.\nThird, we shall confine ourselves to briefly describing how each\ntheory handles simple discourse anaphora of the sort exhibited by\n (13)\n above, in which a pronoun in one sentence is anaphoric on an\nindefinite noun phrase in a previous sentence, and donkey anaphora\nlike\n (25)\n and\n (26).\n Readers interested in more details on how these theories deal with\nembedding under quantifiers, negation, or modals should consult the\nreadings cited both in the previous section and in the sections below.\nReaders interested in Geach discourses or “intentional\nidentity” should begin by consulting Asher (1987), Edelberg\n(1986), Geach (1967), Kamp (1990), King (1994), Braun (2012), and the\nworks mentioned therein. \nThe first two of the theories discussed below, discourse\nrepresentation theory and dynamic semantics, represent departures from\ntraditional semantics, departures which were largely motivated at the\nbeginning by the problematic anaphora cases. The second two theories\ndiscussed below, d-type theories and the CDQ theory, represent ways in\nwhich the problematic anaphora data is dealt with within a traditional\nsemantic framework. \nIn the early 1980s, Irene Heim (1982) and Hans Kamp (1981)\nindependently formulated very similar semantic theories that were in\npart designed to handle problematic anaphora, particularly donkey and\ndiscourse anaphora. The theories developed by Heim and Kamp have come\nto be known as Discourse Representation Theory or DRT (see entry on\n Discourse Representation Theory).[10]\n We shall not attempt to describe differences between the formulations\nof Heim and Kamp. Indeed, in our exposition we shall combine elements\nof the two theories. Readers interested in the differences between the\ntwo accounts should consult Heim (1982) and Kamp (1981) directly. \nWe believe it is fair to say that it was the development of DRT that\nmade the semantics of anaphora a central issue in philosophy of\nlanguage. One reason for this was the following bold statement by Kamp\n(1981): \nA theory of this form differs fundamentally from those familiar from\nthe truth-theoretical and model-theoretical literature, and thus a\nsubstantial argument will be wanted that such a radical departure from\nexisting frameworks is really necessary. The particular analysis\ncarried out in the main part of this paper should be seen as a first\nattempt to provide such an argument. The analysis deals with only a\nsmall number of linguistic problems, but careful reflection upon just\nthose problems already reveals, I suggest, that a major revision of\nsemantic theory is called for. (Kamp 1981: 278)  \nThe problems that Kamp goes on to address are the treatment of donkey\nanaphora and simple discourse anaphora. Hence Kamp appears to be\nsaying that these problems cannot be handled within more traditional\nframeworks and thus that a DRT approach is necessary. Obviously, the\nclaim that the semantics of anaphora requires a radical revision in\nsemantic theory got the attention of philosophers of language. Thus,\nthe study of problematic anaphora blossomed during the 1980s and\n1990s. \nThe first way in which DRT departs from more traditional approaches is\nthat it claims that indefinite noun phrases such as “an\nanthropologist” or “a donkey” are essentially\npredicates with free variables rather than existential quantifiers.\nThus, the above indefinites might as well look as follows at the level\nof “logical form”: \nanthropologist(x)\n\ndonkey(x) \nIn effect, an indefinite introduces a “novel” variable,\n(i.e., in DRT’s terminology, establishes a discourse\nreferent) and a pronoun anaphoric on an indefinite is interpreted\nas the same variable as was introduced by its indefinite antecedent.\nHence a simple discourse such as: \nin effect can be represented\n as[11] \nIn addition to this, DRT builds in to the assignment of truth\nconditions default existential quantification over free variables.\nThus, (27a) is true iff there is some assignment to the variable\n“x” that is in the extension of “man”,\n“loves Annie” and “rich”, that is, iff\nsomething is a man who loves Annie and is rich. Thus, that indefinites\nappear to have the force of existential quantifiers in cases like (27)\nis not because they are existential quantifiers but because of the\ndefault existential quantification of free variables. \nLet us turn now to the DRT treatment of donkey anaphora. First, note\nthat both relative clause and conditional donkey anaphora appear to\nhave a sort of “universal force”: the truth of\n (25)\n and\n (26)\n above, repeated here, require that Sarah beats every donkey she owns\nand that every donkey owning woman beats every donkey she\n owns.[12] \nThus, the indefinite here mysteriously has universal force and\nexpresses something about every donkey owned by someone. Recall that\naccording to DRT, an indefinite is effectively a one-place predicate\nwith a free variable. The central idea of DRT in the case of both\nconditional and relative clause donkey sentences is that the universal\nforce of the indefinite results from the variable in it being bound by\nan operator with genuine universal force. In the case of (25), the\n“conditional operator” has universal force, since it in\neffect says that in every case (assignment to free variables) in which\nthe antecedent is true, the consequent is true. So (25) claims that\nevery assignment to “x” that makes “Sarah\nowns x” and “x is a donkey” true, also\nmakes “Sarah beats x” true. So (25) is true iff\nSarah beats every donkey she owns. In (26), by contrast, the universal\nquantifier (determiner) “every” not only binds the\nvariables associated with the predicative material “woman who\nowns a donkey” (for example, presumably there is such a variable\nin the subject argument place of “beats”), but it also\nbinds the variable introduced by the predicate-with-free-variable\n“a donkey”. So it is as though (26) has the “logical\n form”.[13] \nNote that this account requires allowing quantificational determiners\n(“every”) to bind multiple variables. This, again, is a\ndeparture from more classical\n approaches.[14] \nNow since the DRT approach claims that indefinites get their apparent\nquantificational force from other elements that bind the variables in\nthem, it predicts that when different determiners are involved in\nrelative clause donkey sentences, as in \nthe indefinite should appear to have the quantificational force of the\nnew determiner (“Most”). So (16) should be true if most\npairs of women and donkeys they own are such that the women beat the\ndonkeys. Similar remarks apply to conditionals containing\n“non-universal” quantifiers such as “usually”,\nas in \nThis should be true if most pairs of women and donkeys they own are\nsuch that the women beat the donkeys. But this prediction,\nparticularly in the case of (28), seems clearly false. If there are\nexactly ten donkey owning women and one woman owns ten donkeys and\nbeats them all, while the nine other women own a donkey each and\ndon’t beat them, (28) intuitively seems false: most donkey\nowning women fail to beat the donkeys they own. However, the DRT\naccount as formulated claims (28) is true in this situation. This\ndifficulty is one of the main criticisms of classical DRT in the\nliterature and is often called the proportion problem (Heim\n(1990) claims that Nirit Kadmon so dubbed it). The criticism is\ndamaging, because it appears to refute what was claimed to be a\ncentral insight of DRT: that the apparent quantificational force of\nindefinites comes from other elements that bind the variables in\nthem. \nA second difficulty with classical DRT as formulated here involves\ncases such as\n (18)\n above, repeated here: \nAs mentioned above, (18) has a reading on which the second sentence of\nthe discourse attributes a general belief to Scott (something like the\nbelief that a man who broke into Sarah’s apartment came in\nthrough the window). But as formulated, DRT doesn’t get this\nreading. For the default existential quantification of free variables\nacts in effect like a wide scope existential quantifier over the\nentire discourse. Thus, it is as if (18) were as follows: \n(∃x)(x is a man & x broke into\nSarah’s apartment & Scott believes x came in the\nwindow). \nBut this attributes a belief about a specific person to Scott. Hence\nit can’t capture the reading mentioned. Similarly, consider the\nfollowing sentences: \nThese sentences also appear to have readings on which they attribute\ngeneral or de dicto beliefs to the women in question. That\nis, they have readings on which they attribute to the women in\nquestion general beliefs to the effect that they are being\nstalked by secret admirers. This is why these sentences can be true\neven though the women in question don’t know who their secret\nadmirers are, and so have no beliefs about particular persons\nstalking them. For reasons exactly similar to those given for the case\nof the analogous reading of the second sentence of\n (18),\n these readings can’t be captured by DRT as formulated here. We\nshall see below that dynamic approaches have exactly similar problems.\nAsher (1987) and Kamp (1990) attempt to remedy this problem (among\nothers). For further elaboration of the DRT framework, see also Kamp\nand Reyle (1993) and van Eijck and Kamp (1997). For expansions of the\nDRT framework, e.g., SDRT (segmented discourse representation theory),\nsee Asher and Lascarides (2003), for compositional versions of DRT,\nsee Muskens (1996) and Brasoveanu (2006, 2007, 2008). \nAs its name suggests, Discourse Representation Theory was designed to\ncapture the way in which certain features of a discourse, particularly\ninter-sentential relations such as inter-sentential anaphora, affect\nthe interpretation of sentences in the discourse. At the same time,\nDiscourse Representation Theory as originally formulated in Kamp\n(1981) failed to be compositional, at least in the sense of that term\nfamiliar from Montagovian\n approaches.[15] \nThe initial motivation for a dynamic semantic (see entry on\n dynamic semantics)\n approach to discourse and donkey anaphora was on the one hand to\npreserve the “dynamic” elements of DRT, that is the view\nthat what an expression means is given by the way in which the\naddition of the expression to a discourse changes the information\navailable to a hearer of the discourse, (“meaning as potential\nfor changing the state of information”). On the other hand,\ndynamic semantic approaches wanted to adhere to compositionality. This\nis made very clear in the introduction of the classic statement of the\ndynamic semantic approach to discourse and donkey anaphora, namely\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1991). We shall here discuss their treatment\nof discourse and donkey anaphora, Dynamic Predicate Logic\n(henceforth DPL), and gesture at other treatments in the dynamic\nsemantic tradition. Of the theories discussed in this entry, this is\nthe most difficult to explain informally. We shall keep the discussion\nas informal as possible, and urge interested readers to consult the\nworks cited directly for more detail. \nTo begin with, let’s look at how simple discourse anaphora is\nhandled on DPL. So consider again: \nNow in DPL, indefinites such as “a man” are treated as\nexistential quantifiers. Further, DPL treats consecutive sentences in\ndiscourses as being conjoined. So we can think of (27) as follows: \nHere we have rendered the anaphoric pronoun “He” as the\nvariable “x”, the same variable that is the\nvariable of its quantifier antecedent. This represents the anaphoric\nconnection. The important point to notice is that the anaphoric\npronoun/variable in (27b) is not within the syntactic scope of its\nquantifier antecedent. This corresponds to the fact that in DPL, the\nsyntactic scopes of quantifiers are confined to the sentences in which\nthey occur, as current syntactic theory tells us they should be. \nThe key to understanding the DPL account of discourse anaphora lies in\nunderstanding its semantics of the existential quantifier and\nconjunction. Let’s begin with existential quantification. The\nbasic idea here it that when we interpret an existential quantifier,\nthe output of that interpretation may affect the interpretation of\nsubsequent expressions. In standard predicate logic, the\ninterpretation of an existential quantifier is a set of assignment\nfunctions. In DPL, it is a set of ordered pairs of input and\noutput assignment functions. The output assignment functions act as\nthe input to subsequent formulas. Take for example the simple formula\n“\\((\\exists x)(\\mbox{man } x)\\)”. In DPL, such a formula\ntakes all the input functions g, and for each one outputs all\nthe possible assignment functions h such that they differ from\ng at most in that they assign x to an object in the\ninterpretation of “man” (i.e., they assign x to a\nman). More generally, accounting for possibly more complex formulas in\nthe scope of the existential (including another quantifier), a pair of\nsequences \\(\\langle g, h\\rangle\\) is in the interpretation of an\nexistential formula “\\((\\exists x)\\Phi\\)” just in case\nthere is an assignment function k differing from g at\nmost on x such that \\(\\langle k,h\\rangle\\); is in the\ninterpretation of “\\(\\Phi\\)”.[16]\n So note how interpreting the existential quantifier results in\nshifting from the input function g to k, where k\nis now the input to “\\(\\Phi\\)”. This makes the existential\nquantifier internally dynamic, capable of affecting the\ninterpretation of expressions within its syntactic scope. Further, the\nfact that the output assignment functions of interpreting the whole\nexistentially quantified sentence are allowed to be different from the\ninput to the interpretation means that the processing of the\nexistentially quantified formula may affect the interpretation of\nexpressions after the existentially quantified formula, and\nhence outside the scope of the existential quantifier. This\nis to say that the existential quantifier is externally\ndynamic, capable of affecting the interpretation of expressions\noutside its syntactic scope. As we will see, an expression\ncan be internally dynamic and externally static (as well as internally\nand externally static). At any rate, putting things very roughly, the\nidea here is that once the existential quantifier “resets”\nthe value of “x” so that it satisfies the formula\nthe quantifier embeds, that value stays reset (unless there is a\nsubsequent existential quantifier attached to the same variable) and\ncan affect the interpretation of subsequent formulas. \nTurning now to conjunction, the idea here is similar. Again, the\nfundamental idea is that the interpretation of the left conjunct can\naffect the interpretation of the right conjunct. A bit more formally,\na pair of assignment functions \\(\\langle g,h\\rangle\\); is in the\ninterpretation of a conjunction just in case there is an assignment\nfunction k such that \\(\\langle g,k\\rangle\\); is in the\ninterpretation of the left conjunct and \\(\\langle k,h\\rangle\\); the\nright\n conjunct.[17]\n So note how interpreting the left conjunct changes the input sequence\nfor the interpretation of the right conjunct. Again, this means that\nconjunction is internally dynamic, possibly affecting the\ninterpretation of expressions in its scope. And again, that the output\nof interpreting a conjunction, here h, can differ from the\ninput, here g, means that a conjunction is capable of affecting\nthings outside of it and hence outside of the scope of that\nconjunction sign. Again, this is to say that conjunction is externally\ndynamic. \nTo go through an example, we also need to understand the semantics of\nan atomic formula like “man x”. Atomic formulas act\nlike a test on the input assignments, allowing those assignments that\nsatisfy the condition to pass through and act as input to subsequent\nassignments and rejecting the rest. However, atomic formulas do not\nchange assignment functions. More specifically, an input\noutput pair \\(\\langle g,h\\rangle\\) is in the interpretation of an\natomic formula “\\(Rt_1 \\ldots t_n\\)” just in case \\(h=g\\)\nand h assigns “\\(t_1\\)”…\n“\\(t_n\\)” to something in the interpretation of\nR. \nPutting these elements all together, we are now in a position to see\nhow DPL accounts for (27b). Informally speaking, the first sentence of\n(27b) takes all the input assignment functions g and outputs\nall those assignments h in that they differ at most from\ng in assigning “x” to a man who loves Annie.\nThus the output of the first sentence is all (and only) the possible\nassignments of “x” (given the model) to men who\nlove Annie. The output of the first sentence is the input to the\nsecond. The second sentence tests these assignments, allowing only\nthose through which also assign “x” to something in\nthe interpretation of “rich”. The output of the second\nsentence includes all and only the assignments of\n“x” to rich men who love Annie. As long as the\nmodel includes at least one rich man who loves Annie, there will be at\nleast one such output assignment. Hence the discourse is true iff\nthere is at least one rich man who loves Annie. Since conjunction is\nexternally dynamic, we can keep adding sentences with anaphoric\npronouns to similar effect. Thus in a discourse such as \nthe discourse is all true iff some rich famous man loves Annie. \nThus the dynamic semantic treatment yields a truth conditional\nequivalence between \n\n\\[\n(\\exists x)(\\Phi) \\mathbin{\\&} \\Psi \n\\]\n\n and \n\n\\[\n(\\exists x)(\\Phi \\mathbin{\\&} \\Psi) \n\\]\n\n even when\n“\\(\\Psi\\)” contains free occurrences of\n“x”. Hence it is often said that in DPL quantifiers\nsemantically bind free variables outside their syntactic\nscope. This doesn’t encounter the same problems as the syntactic\nbinding treatment rejected in\n section 2,\n since it allows quantifiers to provide values for subsequent\nanaphoric pronouns without actually binding them in a way that falsely\npredicts, e.g., that “Exactly one man loves Annie. He is\nrich” is truth-conditionally equivalent to\n\\(\\mbox{“}(\\exists !x)(\\mbox{man } x \\mathbin{\\&} x \\mbox{\nloves Annie} \\mathbin{\\&} x \\mbox{ is rich})\\mbox{”}\\). \nBecause the treatment of donkey anaphora is a bit more complicated\ntechnically, and because some of the main ideas of DPL are now on the\ntable, we will be more suggestive here. Again, we urge the interested\nreader to consult Groenendijk and Stokhof (1991) directly. \nFirst, consider conditional donkey anaphora: \n(32) gets regimented in DPL as follows: \nThere are three crucial points to the DPL treatment here. (1) The\nexistential quantifier is externally dynamic and hence may affect the\ninterpretation of variables outside its scope, and in particular\n“x” in the consequent of (32a). (2)\n“\\(\\rightarrow\\)” is internally dynamic and allows the\ninterpretation of its antecedent to affect the interpretation of its\nconsequent (just as is conjunction). 1 and 2 together mean that the\nquantifier in the antecedent of (32)/(32a) can semantically bind the\nvariable in the consequent, even though it is not in the syntactic\nscope of the quantifier. But without doing anything further, we would\nbe left with (32a) having the truth conditions of \nwhere “\\(\\rightarrow\\)” is the standard material\nconditional. This doesn’t give the intuitive truth conditions of\n(32) on the reading that concerns us, i.e., that every donkey-owning\nfarmer beats every donkey he owns. The third and final element we need\nto get the truth conditions to come out right is to say that a pair of\nassignments \\(\\langle h,h\\rangle\\) is in the interpretation of a\nconditional iff for all k such that \\(\\langle h,k\\rangle\\)\nsatisfies the antecedent, there is a j such that \\(\\langle\nk,j\\rangle\\) satisfies the\n consequent.[18]\n This says, roughly, that for any output assignment k of a pair\nof assignments satisfying the antecedent of the conditional\n(assignment of a donkey-owning farmer to x and a donkey owned\nby x to y in the case of (32)/(32a)), k is the\ninput of a pair \\(\\langle k,j\\rangle\\) that satisfies the consequent,\nfor some j. Since the consequent of the conditional in\n(32)/(32a) is an atomic formula, j=k. So the account\nclaims that any output of a pair of sequences that satisfies the\nexistentially quantified antecedent also satisfies “x\nbeats y”, and so also assigns to “x”\nand “y” to something that stands in the beating\nrelation. That is, the truth of (32)/(32a) requires every\ndonkey-owning farmer to beat every donkey he owns. \nTurning now to our relative clause donkey sentence, (repeated\nhere) \nwe shall be even more schematic. This gets regimented in DPL as\nfollows, (giving the predicate letters here the obvious meanings): \nNote in particular that the “y” in\n“Bxy” is not in the scope of the existential\nquantifier. Now given a quite straightforward treatment of the\nuniversal quantifier, on which it allows dynamic effects in its\n scope,[19]\n in all essentials, the example works like (32)/(32a). For stripping\nthe universal quantifier away, we have: \nAnd overlooking the free variables left by stripping away the\nuniversal quantifier (which anyway were in its scope and bound by it),\nwe simply have another conditional with an existential quantifier in\nits antecedent and a formula in the consequent containing an\noccurrence of the variable of that existential quantifier. So the\ntreatment goes essentially as it did for (32)/(32a) itself, with the\nexternally dynamic existential quantifier, internally dynamic\nconditional, and universal quantification over assignments in the\nsemantics of the conditional all working their magic so that\n(26)’s truth requires every donkey owning woman to beat every\ndonkey she owns. \nThough DPL cannot handle relative clause donkey sentences such as: \nsince it is working within the framework of a first order logic\nwithout generalized quantifiers, this is only a limitation of this\nparticular formulation and not of dynamic approaches generally. Others\nhave formulated systems of dynamic semantics with generalized\nquantifiers that are capable of dealing with examples like\n (33).[20] \nOn the other hand, DPL and dynamic approaches generally do face a\nproblem. Put crudely, DPL (and dynamic approaches generally) solve the\nproblems of discourse and donkey anaphora by formulating semantics for\nquantifiers that allows quantifiers to semantically bind variables\nthat aren’t in their syntactic scopes. In this they\n(self-consciously) resemble DRT. But then they face a problem similar\nto one faced by DRT and mentioned above. Consider again our discourse\n (18), repeated here \nAs mentioned above, (18) has a reading on which the second sentence of\nthe discourse attributes a general belief to Scott (something like the\nbelief that a man who broke into Sarah’s apartment came in\nthrough the window). On a dynamic approach to (18), the quantifier in\nthe first sentence semantically binds the variable in the second\nsentence. But then this semantically amounts to quantification into\nthe verb of attitude, and so will not result in a reading of the\nsecond sentence on which it attributes a general belief to Scott.\nHence, dynamic approaches need to invoke some other mechanism to get\nthe reading of the second sentence in\n question.[21] \nSimilarly, again consider the following sentences discussed in\nconnection with DRT above : \nAs mentioned there, these sentences also appear to have readings on\nwhich they attribute general or de dicto beliefs to the women\nin question. That is, they have readings on which they attribute to\nthe women in question general beliefs to the effect that they\nare being stalked by secret admirers. This is why these sentences can\nbe true even though the women in question don’t know who their\nsecret admirers are, and so have no beliefs about particular\npersons stalking them. For reasons exactly similar to those given for\nthe case of the analogous reading of the second sentence of (18),\nthese readings can’t be captured by DPL or dynamic approaches\ngenerally. \nPaul Elbourne (2005) reviews three other serious problems for dynamic\napproaches. The first is the problem of disjunctive antecedents\n(discussed in detail in Stone 1992). The problem is with sentences\nlike the following: \nThis is problematic because the pronouns cannot co-refer with the\nantecedent (since it is disjunctive), but the antecedent also does not\nintroduce any suitable variables or quantifiers to provide values for\nthe pronouns, since they are definites (names) and not indefinites or\nother quantificational expressions. \nThe other two problems involve anaphoric pronouns that don’t\nhave a proper linguistic antecedent. The following example, originally\nfrom Jacobson (2000), is one in which there is no linguistic\nantecedent for the pronoun “it”, though the pronoun has a\ncovarying interpretation with the quantifier “most faculty\nmembers”: \nThe second kind of example involves what is commonly called a\npaycheck pronoun: \nThe problematic (salient) reading is the one is which everybody else\nput their own paychecks in the bank. The first sentence only\nintroduces John’s paycheck, hence “it”\ndoesn’t have a proper antecedent. Dynamic accounts simply\ndon’t have the machinery for dealing with pronouns without the\nproper linguistic antecedent, since it is the antecedent’s\neffect on the context that accounts for the anaphoric pronoun’s\n interpretation.[22] \nThere have been many accounts of the semantics of anaphora according\nto which anaphoric pronouns in some sense function like definite\ndescriptions. Though there are important differences between such\ntheories, examples of theories of this sort include Evans (1977),\nParsons (1978, Other Internet Resources), Davies (1981), Neale (1990),\nHeim (1990) and Elbourne (2005). Theories of this sort are often\ncalled E-Type or\nD-type approaches. Though it is beyond the scope of this\narticle to compare all the different accounts, some of the main\ndifferences in types of accounts are as follows. E-type accounts are\nusually distinguished as ones in which a definite description fixes\nthe referent of an anaphoric pronoun. By contrast, D-type accounts are\nones in which the pronoun itself has the semantics of a definite\ndescription. These are further sub-divided into those that treat\npronouns as definite descriptions merely at the level of semantics and\nthose that also treat them as descriptions at the level of syntax.\nFinally, accounts differ in how the descriptive material is recovered.\nSome accounts hold that the descriptive material has to be recovered\nlinguistically, from prior discourse. Others hold that it can be any\ncontextually salient description. \nWe will discuss two of the best known versions of the view, Neale\n(1990) and Elbourne (2005). We should add that though Neale developed\nthe view in question in greater detail, Davies (1981) had earlier\ndefended essentially the same view in all crucial\n respects.[23]\n Thus, the view we go on to describe should probably be called the\nDavies-Neale view. But since we shall focus on Neale’s\npresentation of the view, we shall talk of Neale’s view. \nOn Neale’s view, in all instances of problematic anaphora,\nanaphoric pronouns “go proxy for” definite descriptions\nunderstood as quantifiers along roughly Russellian lines. First,\nconsider discourse anaphora. Neale’s view is that in a discourse\nsuch as: \nthe pronoun “it” “goes proxy for” the definite\ndescription “the donkey John bought.” Hence the second\nsentence of such a discourse is equivalent to the sentence\n“Harry vaccinated the donkey John bought” with the\ndescription understood in the standard Russellian fashion. Within a\ngeneralized quantifier type framework, where “the” is\ntreated as a determiner that, like other determiners, combines with a\nset term to form a quantified NP, the evaluation clause for sentences\ncontaining a singular description (with wide scope) can be given as\nfollows \nSo the second sentence of (37) is true iff Harry vaccinated the unique\ndonkey John bought. Thus far, then, the view is that pronouns\nanaphoric on singular indefinites are interpreted as Russellian\ndefinite descriptions. \nThere is, however, a further complication in Neale’s theory that\nis invoked in the explanation of donkey anaphora. In particular, Neale\nintroduces what he calls a “numberless description”: a\ndescription that, unlike semantically singular descriptions, puts no\ncardinality constraint on the denotation of the set term that combines\nwith the determiner to form the quantified NP (other than that it must\nbe nonempty—note above how in the singular case \\(|\\mathbf{F}|\\)\nis constrained to equal one.) Following Neale, let “whe”\nbe the determiner (corresponding to “the”) used to form\n“numberless descriptions.” Then the evaluation clause for\nsentences containing numberless descriptions, analogous to (38) above,\nwould be \nThus numberless descriptions are in effect universal quantifiers. \nIn addition to going proxy for Russellian singular descriptions in the\nway we have seen, Neale claims that anaphoric pronouns sometimes go\nproxy for numberless descriptions. In particular, Neale holds that\npronouns anaphoric on singular existential quantifiers (but outside of\ntheir scope) can be interpreted either as standard Russellian\ndescriptions or as numberless descriptions. Now if the\npronouns in our conditional and relative clause donkey sentences\n(repeated here) \nare interpreted as a numberless description, (25) asserts that if\nSarah owns a donkey, she beats all the donkeys she owns and (26)\nasserts that every donkey owning woman beats every donkey she owns.\nThus, Neale’s account of donkey anaphora requires the pronouns\nhere to be interpreted as numberless descriptions. \nHaving seen how Neale’s theory handles discourse anaphora and\ndonkey anaphora, we turn to difficulties with the account. An obvious\nquestion concerning an account like this that allows pronouns\nanaphoric on singular existential quantifiers to go proxy for both\nRussellian and numberless descriptions is: what determines\nwhether such a pronoun is going proxy for a Russellian, as opposed to\na numberless, description? This question is pressing for Neale’s\naccount, since there will be a substantial difference in the truth\nconditions of a pronoun-containing sentence depending on whether the\npronoun receives a numberless or Russellian interpretation. In his\nmost explicit statement about the matter (1990: 237) Neale makes clear\nthat it is primarily whether the utterer had a particular individual\nin mind in uttering the indefinite description that determines whether\na pronoun anaphoric on it receives a Russellian or a numberless\n interpretation.[24] \nIf this is correct, then discourses of the form \ngenerally ought to display both readings (in the suitable contexts),\ndepending on whether the utterer of the discourse had a particular\nindividual in mind in uttering “A(n) F”. So the\nsecond sentences of discourses of the form of (40) ought to have\nreadings on which they mean the unique F that is G is\nH (Russellian) and on which they mean every F\nthat is G is H (numberless). But this does not seem to\nbe the case. In particular, such discourses do not have readings\ncorresponding to the numberless interpretation of the pronoun.\nConsider the discourse anaphora analogue of the donkey conditional\n(25): \nIt seems clear that this discourse has no reading on which the second\nsentence means that Sarah beats every donkey she owns, even if we\nimagine that the utterer of the discourse had no particular donkey in\nmind when she uttered the first sentence. Suppose, for example, that\nthe Homeland Security and Donkey Care Bureau comes to town and wants\ninformation about local donkey ownership and beating. The speaker\ntells them that she really don’t know how many donkeys anybody\nowns, and has never seen or had any other contact with particular\nlocal donkeys. But she tells them that she has received some\ninformation from reliable sources and it has been deemed\n“credible”. Asked what she has heard, she responds:\n“Sarah owns a donkey and she beats it”. \nEven though she has no particular donkey in mind in uttering these\nsentences, we simply don’t get a numberless reading here. If\nSarah beats some donkey she owns, the speaker has spoken truly even if\nshe owns others she fails to beat. Or again, suppose we are debating\nwhether anybody has an eight track tape player anymore, and one of us\nsays “I’ll bet the following is true: some guy with a\n‘68 Camaro owns an eight track player and he still uses\nit.” Again, there is no numberless reading for the pronoun in\nthe second sentence, even though the speaker clearly has no particular\neight-track player in mind. If some ‘68 Camaro driving guy owns\nand uses an eight-track player, the sentence is true even if he owns\nother eight track players that aren’t\n used.[25] \nSo it appears that Neale’s account has no explanation of why the\npronouns in discourses like (25a) never have numberless readings.\nNeale’s account has similar problems with sentences like: \nHere again, Neale’s theory predicts that this sentence has a\nreading on which its truth requires that some woman beats every donkey\nshe owns. And again, even if we imagine the sentence being uttered\nwithout any particular woman or donkey in mind, we don’t get\nthis reading of the sentence predicted by Neale’s theory, (say\nwe are discussing women’s tendencies towards animals they own,\nand one of us utters (41) simply thinking it is statistically likely\nto be true). So Neale’s account has no explanation as to why the\nsecond sentence of discourse (25a) and sentence (41) lack the relevant\nreadings assigned to those sentences by his theory. \nElbourne (2005) proposes a different D-type theory. The main thesis of\nthe book is that pronouns of all types, proper names, and definite\ndescriptions have a unified syntax and semantics: they are all of type\n\\(\\langle s, e\\rangle\\) (functions from situations to individuals) and\nare syntactically comprised of a definite determiner that takes two\narguments: an index and an NP (noun phrase).  \nHis theory of unbound pronouns is NP-deletion theory.\nNP-deletion is when an NP at the level of syntax is (felicitously)\nunpronounced at the surface level as in: \nOn Elbourne’s theory, pronouns undergo obligatory\nNP-deletion. That is, a sentence like\n (25),\n at the level of syntax is actually (25b): \nFollowing Elbourne, we’ll suppress mention of the index, since\nit doesn’t do any work here (anaphoric pronouns have a null\nindex on his view, though he does provide arguments for why this null\nindex is present—see Elbourne (2005: 118–126)). Pronouns\nhave the same semantics as the determiner “the”\n(abstracting away from the phi-features of pronouns) so that (25b) has\nthe same semantics as (25c): \nThis is motivated by the insight that pronouns pattern with\nminimal definite descriptions rather than long ones, as other\nD-type theories have it. For example, a theory like Neale’s\npredicts that (43a) has the semantics of (43b): \nBut this is problematic, because (43a) clearly has a salient, true\nreading, whereas (43b) does not. However, Elbourne observes that (43c)\nhas the same salient true reading as (43a): \nTreating pronouns as determiners is motivated more generally by Postal\n(1966)’s arguments\nthat they at least sometimes have the same semantics as determiners\nbased on examples such as: \nFinally, positing an NP-deletion theory provides an elegant solution\nto the problem of the formal link, which is that any good account of\nanaphora has to explain why (45a) is felicitous but (46b) is not: \nSince NP-deletion generally requires a linguistic antecedent, if\npronouns are determiners that have undergone NP-deletion, this\nexplains the contrast.  \nAs mentioned above, pronouns have the semantics of determiners.\nSpecifically, Elbourne proposes a situation semantics\n (situations in natural language semantics),\n where the semantics of pronouns (and determiners) are treated in a\nFregean way, as follows: \nThat is to say, pronouns come with presuppositions that there is a\nunique individual in each situation that satisfies the predicate, and\n(when that presupposition is satisfied), they refer to that individual\n(in that situation). Conditional donkey anaphora works as follows. A\nsentence like (47) has the structure at LF of (48): \nThe semantics of “always” is crucial to getting the truth\nconditions right: \n\\([[\\mbox{always}]]^g = \\lambda p_{\\langle s,t\\rangle}. \\lambda\nq_{\\langle s,t\\rangle}. \\lambda s\\). for every minimal situation\n\\(s'\\) such that \\(s' \\le s\\) and \\(p(s') = 1\\), there is a situation\n\\(s''\\) such that \\(s'' \\le s\\) and \\(s''\\) is a minimal situation\nsuch that \\(s' \\le s''\\) and \\(q(s'') = 1\\)  \nBasically, “always” takes two sentences, and returns true\niff every minimal situation that satisfies the first sentence has a\nminimal extension that satisfies the second sentence. A minimal\nsituation is one that contains one or more thin\nparticulars—an individual abstracted away from its\nproperties—and one or more properties or relations that the thin\nparticular(s) instantiate(s). An extension of a minimal situation\nincludes all those same particulars and properties and relations, with\n(possibly) some more particulars, properties, or relations in\naddition. On Elbourne’s account “if” doesn’t\nplay any role in contributing to the truth conditions of a donkey\nconditional; it is semantically vacuous. It is the (sometimes silent)\nadverb of quantification along with the semantics of the antecedent\nand consequent that do the work in yielding the truth conditions. The\nfollowing are the truth conditions for (47) on Elbourne’s\naccount. (We won’t go through the derivation for relative clause\ndonkey anaphora, but it works similarly. See Elbourne 2005: 53.) \nThus on Elbourne’s account (47) is true iff each donkey-owning\nman beats every donkey he owns. \nElbourne surprisingly never goes through a derivation of a case of\ncross-sentential anaphora as in: \nHis view is that this has the same semantics as (49a): \nBut he doesn’t provide an account of how this works, neither in\ndescription nor detailed derivation. One worry about this is that in\nthe conditional and relative clause donkey sentences, the fact that\nthe pronoun(s) co-varies with its antecedent is accounted for by\n“always” and “every”. These expressions\nquantify over situations in a way that guarantees that the man who\nbeats the donkey is the same man who owns that same donkey,\neffectively acting as (semantic) binding. But there is no such\nmechanism in place to guarantee that “the woman” in (the\nsituation in) the second sentence of (49) in any sense co-varies with\nthe woman (in the situation) in the first. It is not clear how\nElbourne’s view can accomplish this without employing either a\ndynamic notion of binding or a more traditional d-type account with\ncomplete descriptions (Though for why even more typical d-type\naccounts face a similar problem, see Lewis 2013). \nHowever, Elbourne’s account doesn’t encounter the same\nproblem as Neale’s in predicting numberless readings where there\nare none, as he doesn’t posit a numberless interpretation of the\npronoun at all. This highlights a difference between the way that\nNeale’s theory approaches the truth conditions of conditional\ndonkey sentences and the way DRT, dynamic semantics, the CDQ theory\n(discussed in the next section) and other D-type theories like\nElbourne’s and Heim (1990)’s do (Heim 1990 also employs a\nsituation semantics to account for conditional donkey anaphora). In\nthese other theories, the requirement that all the donkey-owning men\nbeat all the donkeys they own for (47) to be true arises due to the\ninteraction of the semantic of indefinites, the semantics of anaphoric\npronouns and the semantics of\n conditionals.[27]\n Indeed, it is the latter that is primarily implicated in (47)’s\ntruth requiring that all donkeys owned by donkey-owning men\nbe beaten (since the theories posit some sort of universal\nquantification in the semantics of conditionals). By contrast, on\nNeale’s view, the requirement that the men beat all the donkeys\nthey own for (47) to be true (on one of its readings) essentially\nfalls out of the semantics of the anaphoric pronoun alone, since on\none of its readings, it expresses universal quantification over\ndonkeys Sarah owns (the numberless description reading). \nOne problem that all D-type theories must address is the problem of\nindistinguishable participants. Since on D-type theories,\npronouns in one way or another have the semantics of definite\ndescriptions, they come with uniqueness presuppositions. When it comes\nto conditional donkey anaphora, the way to meet these uniqueness\npresuppositions is by employing minimal situations—the definite\ndescription then picks out the unique object satisfying the\ndescription in the minimal situation. (With the exception of\nNeale’s theory: since he employs numberless pronouns, the\npronouns have no uniqueness presupposition.) Thus uniqueness is\nsatisfied within the situation, even if it can’t be satisfied in\nthe larger world. But in examples of indistinguishable participants,\nuniqueness cannot even be satisfied within a minimal situation.\nConsider the typical example, (50): \nIn the minimal situation that satisfies the antecedent, there are\ntwo bishops that have the same property (meeting another\nbishop). Thus descriptions like “the bishop” or\n“the bishop who meets a bishop” do not denote uniquely.\nDRT and dynamic theories don’t have any problem at all with\nthese examples because pronouns are treated as dynamically bound\nvariables, not definite descriptions, and each instance of “a\nbishop” in the antecedent of (50) is associated with a different\nvariable, which prescribe the anaphoric links to the two pronouns in\nthe consequent. For D-type solutions to this puzzle see Heim(1990),\nLudlow (1994), Elbourne (2005). \nFinally, it should be mentioned that there are some who propose\nmixed approaches, wherein some pronouns are treated as\ndynamically bound variables whereas others are treated as D-type (see\nChierchia 1995; Kurafuji 1998, 1999). On these views, some pronouns\nare ambiguous between the two readings, while others have only the\ndynamically bound variable or D-type reading. This type of theory\navoids many of the problems raised for each type of account, since\nthey use dynamic semantics for the examples most amenable to a dynamic\nexplanation and d-type pronouns for example most amenable to that sort\nof explanation. However, the theory comes at a considerable\ntheoretical cost in that it predicts a systematic ambiguity in\npronouns that is (arguably) not explicitly marked in any language.\n(See Elbourne 2005 for further criticisms of these views.) \nThe Context Dependent Quantifier, or CDQ, account of anaphora was\nsuggested in Wilson (1984) and subsequently developed in King (1987,\n1991,\n 1994).[28]\n The idea underlying the application of CDQ to discourse anaphora is\nthat these expressions look like quantifier-like expressions of\ngenerality, where the precise nature of the generality they express is\ndetermined by features of the linguistic context in which they occur.\nOn the CDQ account, anaphoric pronouns with quantifier antecedents in\ndiscourse anaphora are contextually sensitive devices of\nquantification. That is, these anaphoric pronouns express\nquantifications; and which quantifications they\nexpress is partly a function of the linguistic environments\nin which they are embedded. Consider the following discourses: \nLooking at (51), suppose that in fact at least one Swede has soloed\nMt. Everest without oxygen. Then it would seem that the sentences of\n(51) are true. If this is correct, then it appears that the second\nsentence of (51) expresses a (existentially) general claim.\nCDQ claims that the pronoun “He” in the second sentence is\nitself a (existential) quantifier, and this explains why the second\nsentence expresses a general claim: the generality is a result of the\npresence of this quantifier in the sentence. Similar remarks apply to\n(52), (except that “They” expresses a universal\nquantifier). Further, consider the following example, which is similar\nto our example (18) above: \nThe second sentence of this discourse appears to have two different\nreadings. On one reading, it asserts that concerning the man who\nkilled Alan last night, Michelle believes of that very man\nthat he used a knife. This would be the case if, for example, Michelle\nknew the man who killed Alan, believed that he killed Alan and based\non his well-known fondness of knives, believed he used this sort of\nweapon. But the second sentence has another reading on which it\nascribes to Michelle the general belief to the effect that a man\nkilled Alan with a knife last night. On this reading the sentence\nwould be true if e.g., on the basis of conversations with personnel at\nthe hospital and having no particular person in mind, Michelle\nbelieved that a man fatally stabbed Alan last night. \nAgain, CDQ claims these facts are to be explained by holding that the\npronoun in the second sentence is a quantifier. For then we should\nexpect that, like other quantifiers, it could take wide or narrow\nscope relative to “Michelle believes”. On the wide scope\nreading of the pronoun/quantifier, the second sentence attributes to\nMichelle a belief regarding a particular person. On the narrow scope\nreading, it attributes to Michelle a general belief. \nOccurrences of “ordinary quantifiers”, such as\n“every man” have what we might call a force, in\nthis case universal; what we might call a restriction, in\nthis case the set of men; and scope relative to other\noccurrences of quantifiers, verbs of propositional attitude, and so\non. CDQ claims that the anaphoric pronouns in question also have\nforces (universal, existential, etc.), restrictions\n(“domains over which they quantify”) and scopes\nrelative to each other, verbs of propositional attitude, etc. However,\nunlike “ordinary” quantifiers, these anaphoric pronouns\nqua quantifiers have their forces, restrictions and relative scopes\ndetermined by features of their linguistic environments. King (1994)\nlays out how the forces, restrictions and relative scopes of these\nanaphoric pronouns are determined, and we shall not describe those\ndetails here. \nAs to donkey anaphora, without going through the details, let me just\nsay that CDQ assigns to a relative clause donkey sentence such as\n (26)\n above (repeated here) \ntruth conditions according to which (26) is true iff every woman who\nowns a donkey beats some donkey she owns (see King 2004 for details\nand discussion). Some think that the truth of (26) requires every\nwoman who owns a donkey to beat every donkey she owns, and as\nwe saw, DRT, DPL, and the D-type theories discussed assign these truth\nconditions to (26) (though this is not an essential feature of DRT or\ndynamic semantic approaches more generally). The truth conditions CDQ\nassigns to (26) correspond to what is often called the weak\nreading of donkey sentences (Chierchia (1995) calls this the\n\\(\\exists\\)-reading) and the truth conditions the accounts discussed thus far\ncorrespond to the strong reading of donkey sentences\n(Chierchia calls this the \\(\\forall\\)-reading). There actually has been a debate\nin the literature as to which truth conditions sentences like (26)\nhave. There are sentences that are exactly like (26) except for the\ndescriptive material in them that clearly seem to have (only) the weak\nreading. An example is: \nIt seems clear that the truth of this sentence does not require every\nperson with a credit card to pay his bill with each credit card he\nhas. We will discuss these matters further in\n section 4,\n but for now let us simply note that CDQ differs from the other\naccounts discussed on what truth conditions should be assigned to\nsentences like (26) and (54) and that it is simply unclear which truth\nconditions are the correct ones. \nAs for conditional donkey anaphora, the CDQ account is rather\ncomplicated and we are only able to provide the briefest outline of\nthe account here (interested readers should consult King 2004). As we\nsaw above, a conditional donkey sentence such as\n (25)\n  \nis true iff Sarah beats every donkey she owns. Thus, “a\ndonkey” somehow seems to have ended up with universal force. The\nCDQ account holds that this illusion of universal force for the\nindefinite is really the result of the interaction of the semantics of\nthe conditional, the indefinite, understood as an existential\nquantifier, and the CDQ “she”, understood as a\ncontext dependent quantifier with existential force ranging over\ndonkeys Sarah owns. Roughly, the account goes as follows. The\nantecedent of (25) is equivalent to \nGiven the CDQ “it” and its context in (25), the consequent\nof (25) is equivalent to \nThe semantics of the conditional involves universal quantification\nover minimal situations. In particular, a conditional claims that for\nevery minimal situation \\(s_1\\) in which its antecedent is true, there\nis a situation \\(s_2\\) that \\(s_1\\) is part of in which its consequent\nis true. In the case of (25), a minimal situation in which the\nantecedent is true consists of Sarah and a single donkey she owns. The\nfinal element here is that the definiteness and/or anaphoricness of\nthe CDQ “it” in the consequent of (25) makes a difference\nto its truth conditions. The definiteness and anaphoricness of\n“it” in (25) induces a sort of “familiarity\n effect”.[29]\n In particular, for any (minimal) \\(s_1\\) in which the antecedent is\ntrue, there must be an \\(s_2\\) that \\(s_1\\) is part of in which the\nconsequent (understood as expressing the claim that Sarah beats a\ndonkey she owns) is true. But in addition, because of the\n“familiarity” condition induced by the anaphoric definite\n“it”, there must be a donkey in \\(s_2\\) that is also in\n\\(s_1\\) and that makes the consequent true. In other words,\nfamiliarity requires that a donkey that makes the CDQ-containing\nconsequent true in \\(s_2\\) also be present in \\(s_1\\). In this sense,\nthe donkey is “familiar”, having been introduced by the\nantecedent and the situation \\(s_1\\) in which it is true. To see what\nthis means, consider a situation \\(s_1\\) that is a minimal situation\nin which the antecedent is true. \\(s_1\\) consists of Sarah owning a\nsingle donkey. If e.g., Sarah owns ten donkeys, there are ten such\nminimal situations. For (25) to be true, each such \\(s_1\\) must be\npart of a situation \\(s_2\\) such that \\(s_2\\) is a situation in which\nSarah beats a donkey that she owns and that is in \\(s_1\\). Now the\nonly way that every minimal \\(s_1\\) in which Sarah owns a donkey can\nbe part of an \\(s_2\\) in which Sarah beats a donkey she owns in\n\\(s_1\\) is if Sarah beats every donkey she owns. Thus, the CDQ account\nclaims that (25) is true iff Sarah beats every donkey she owns. \nTurning now to difficulties with CDQ, a main difficulty is that it\nisn’t clear whether the use of the notion of\nfamiliarity in the account of conditional donkey sentences\ncan be ultimately upheld. Recall that the idea was that because\n“it” is a definite NP, and because definite NPs generally\nare thought to involve some sort of familiarity, the pronoun in the\ndonkey conditional induces a sort of familiarity effect. There are\nreally two distinct problems here. One is that though the pronoun\n“it” is “syntactically” definite in that the\npronoun “it” is thought to be a definite NP, according to\nCDQ it is “semantically” indefinite in (25), since it\nexpresses an existential quantification (over donkeys owned by Sarah).\nBut then if “it” really is semantically indefinite in\n(25), why should it induce familiarity effects at all? (Jason Stanley\n(p.c.) raised this difficulty). One might reply that it is the fact\nthat “it” is “syntactically” definite that\ntriggers the familiarity effects CDQ posits. But familiarity probably\nis not well enough understood to allow us to assess this response. A\nsecond, and perhaps more pressing, difficulty is this. Generally,\nfamiliarity has something to do with whether what an expression is\nbeing used to talk about is familiar or salient to the audience being\naddressed. This is vague, of course, but the idea is that if one says\n“The dog is hungry” to an audience who isn’t even\naware of any dog that is around or relevant to the conversation, the\nremark is somewhat infelicitous. That is because the definite NP\n“The dog” was used to talk about something not familiar to\nthe audience. Now the question is: is it plausible to claim that this\nand related phenomena are related to the rather complex effect CDQ\nclaims is induced by the anaphoricness/definiteness of\n“it” in donkey conditionals? In the latter case, CDQ\nclaims the effect of familiarity is to make the CDQ “it”\nin the consequent of donkey conditionals quantify over donkeys in the\nminimal situations introduced by the antecedents of the conditionals\n(in the case of (25), situations consisting of Sarah and a single\ndonkey she owns). The CDQ can only quantify over\n“familiar” donkeys—those introduced by the\nantecedent. One may well wonder whether the effect CDQ posits here can\nreally be seen to be a manifestation of phenomena that have\ntraditionally been explained in terms of familiarity. \nWe have already mentioned that there is some disagreement regarding\nthe truth conditions of sentences like \nSome think that the truth of (26) requires every woman who owns a\ndonkey to beat every donkey she owns. As mentioned above,\nthis is called the strong reading of a donkey sentence.\nOthers think that the truth of (26) requires that every donkey owning\nwoman beats some donkey she owns. As above, this is the\nweak reading of (26). As we mentioned above, there are\nsentences that are exactly like (26) except for the descriptive\nmaterial in them that clearly seem to have (only) the weak reading.\nThe example we gave was: \nIt seems clear that the truth of this sentence does not require every\nperson with a credit card to pay his bill with each credit card he\nhas, but merely with some credit card he has. Our comments to this\npoint have suggested that the debate with respect to (26)/(54) and\nweak vs. strong readings is over which one of the two sets of truth\nconditions (26)/(54) have. Each of the theories discussed in this\nentry only assign one of the existential or universal truth\nconditions to relative clause donkey sentences (though this may be\nmore of an artifact of the specific implementations of the theories\nthan the theories themselves). \nBut some think that (at least some) donkey sentences have\nboth weak and strong readings. Chierchia (1994) and Kanazawa\n(1994b) are examples. In their favor, for a given determiner, one can\nfind pairs of relative clause donkey sentences fronted by that\ndeterminer such that one has the existential truth conditions (on its\nmost natural interpretation) and the other has the universal truth\nconditions (on its most natural reading). For example, consider the\nfollowing pairs: \nElbourne, for example, explicitly addresses this issue, since his\nsemantics captures only the strong reading. He claims that while this\nmay present a problem for his semantics, it is not a problem for\nNP-deletion theory more generally, since replacing the pronoun in a\ntypical weak reading example with a minimal definite description also\nyields a weak reading, e.g.: \nHowever, he doesn’t present an account of how this reading might\nbe captured. \nThese examples and others suggest that whether a given relative clause\ndonkey sentence appears to favor the strong reading or weak reading is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including the monotonicity\nproperties of the determiner on the wide scope quantifier, the lexical\nsemantics of the predicates occurring in the sentence, and general\nbackground assumptions concerning the situations in which we are to\nconsider the truth or falsity of the sentences. However, it is very\nhard to find significant generalizations regarding under what\nconditions a given reading is\n favored.[30]\n Further, it is very hard to find sentences that clearly allow both a\nstrong and a weak reading. This makes the view that the sentences\nactually possess both readings as a matter of their semantics at least\nsomewhat suspect. If they really do possess both readings, why is it\nso hard to find sentences that clearly allow both readings? And\nfinally, relative clause donkey sentences fronted by the determiner\n“some” seem always to only have the existential truth\nconditions: \nObviously, the facts here are quite complicated. \nBrasoveanu (2006, 2007, 2008) points out that there are also\nmixed readings of donkey sentences, such as: \nSentence (59) intuitively is true iff for every book that a\ncredit-card owner buys on amazon.com, there is some credit\ncard or other that she uses to pay for the book. Hence the mixed\nstrong and weak reading. Brasoveanu accounts for these readings, along\nwith the weak/strong ambiguity in general, within his system of Plural\nCompositional Discourse Representation Theory (PCDRT) by positing an\nambiguity at the level of indefinites. In his account, indefinites are\nunderspecified as to the presence of a maximization operator (which is\npresent in the strong indefinite but not the weak); the decision of\nwhich indefinite to use in a specific case is a “context-driven\nonline process”. \nTheories that assign both sets of truth conditions to relative clause\ndonkey sentences generally do so by positing some sort of ambiguity,\neither in the quantifiers, the pronouns, or the\n indefinites.[31]\n Though the matter isn’t entirely clear, it seems plausible that\nthe theories discussed in this entry also may be able to assign both\nthe universal and the existential truth conditions to relative clause\ndonkey sentences by positing some sort of ambiguity. These matters\nrequire further\n investigation.[32] \nAnother recent development in the study of anaphora comes from a\nseries of papers by Philippe Schlenker on anaphora in sign language,\nparticularly ASL (American Sign Language) and LSF (French Sign\nLanguage) (2010, 2011, 2012a,b, 2013a,b, 2014, 2015). In sign\nlanguage, an antecedent is associated with a particular position in\nsigning space called a locus, and an anaphoric link to the\nantecedent is obtained by pointing at that same locus. Unlike spoken\nlanguages, which have a limited number of lexically encoded pronouns,\nin sign language there seems to be no upper bound on how many loci can\nsimultaneously be used, aside from limitations of performance (since\nsigners have to remember what the loci are assigned to, and be able to\ndistinguish one from another). Schlenker (2015) gives an example of a\nshort discourse that involves 7 distinct loci. Given their unbounded\nnumber and their overt connection to antecedents, Schlenker (as well\nas others) posits that they are the overt realization of formal\nindices, i.e., the variables that mark anaphoric connections in\ntheories like DRT and dynamic semantics. Despite their differences,\nsign language and spoken language pronouns have enough in common that\na uniform theory is desirable, and Schlenker argues that sign language\nprovides evidence applicable to at least two debates in the anaphora\nliterature. First, there is good evidence that in sign language, there\nis a single system of anaphora using loci for denoting individuals,\ntimes, and worlds. This provides evidence in favor of those who think\nthat there are temporal and modal variables and pronouns in spoken\nlanguage. Second, Schlenker argues that the use of loci, which look\nlike an overt use of indices, very much resembles the dynamic semantic\naccount of pronominal anaphora since antecedents introduce variables\n(loci) and anaphoric connections are made by repeating the same\nvariables (loci). Just as in spoken language, this occurs even when\nthe anaphoric pronouns are outside the syntactic scope of their\nantecedents. Furthermore, according to Schlenker one of the most\ndecisive examples is the bishop example\n (50),\n repeated here: \nIn sign language, the only way to obtain the intended reading of the\nsentence is for the pronouns to index different antecedents. This\nshows that a theory need not only get the truth conditions right (as\nsome D-type theories can), but must account for the formal link\nbetween each antecedent and pronoun. For criticism of the thesis that\nloci are overt variables see Kuhn (forthcoming).  \nThe second major conclusion from Schlenker’s research is that\nsign language pronouns have an iconic element. For example,\nthe verb “ask” is signed near the chin/neck area of a\nlocus. If the locus denotes a person standing on a branch,\n“ask” is signed at a fairly high spot in the locus. If the\nlocus denotes a person hanging upside-down from a branch,\n“ask” is signed lower in the locus. This and many other\nexamples of iconicity in pronouns provides evidence that there needs\nto be an account of iconicity integrated into the formal\nsemantics.","contact.mail":"klewis@barnard.edu","contact.domain":"barnard.edu"}]
