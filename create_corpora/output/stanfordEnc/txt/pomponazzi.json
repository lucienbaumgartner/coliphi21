Teaching primarily at the universities at Padua and\nBologna, he developed innovative approaches to Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy and psychology. He gained particular fame, and notoriety,\nfor his philosophical investigations into the mortality of the soul\nand for his naturalistic explanations of seemingly miraculous\nphenomena and of the development of religions. Pomponazzi was notable\nfor his philosophical challenges to religious doctrine as well as for\nhis use of Alexander of Aphrodisias’s writings and Stoic ideas\nto forge what he considered to be a purer or more accurate\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s natural philosophy and\npsychology.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Mantua, Pomponazzi studied at Padua, obtaining his degree in\narts in 1487. He then taught there, first as extraordinary and then\nordinary professor from 1488–1496 (Nardi 1965: 54–55). His\nteacher and fellow professor at Padua Nicoletto Vernia as well as his\ncolleague Alessandro Achillini openly endorsed Averroes’ view of\nthe unicity of the material intellect, a view that Bishop Pietro\nBarrozzi condemned with the threat of excommunication in 1489, leading\nthem to revise or hide their teachings (Hasse 2016: 184–214).\nPomponazzi questioned and ultimately rejected Averroes’ unicity\nposition. Perhaps influenced by his other teachers Pietro Trapolino\nand Francesco Securo da Nardò, respected Thomas Aquinas’s\nviews even if he found them to use theological premises that he\nbelieved were unwelcome to natural philosophy and contrary to\nAristotle’s philosophy. Despite rejecting Averroes’ view\non the material intellect, throughout his career, Pomponazzi’s\nlectures relied on Averroes’ commentaries; for example among\nPomponazzi’s writings are quaestiones based on\nAverroes’ De substantia orbis (On the Substance of\nthe Orbs). Around 1496, he\nobtained a doctorate in medicine (Oliva 1926: 179), a common step for\nthose who wished to rise in the universities of northern Italy, where\nphilosophy was often taught as preparation to the study of medicine\n(see Kristeller 1993: vol. 3, 436–38; Kraye 2010: 93). Although\nPomponazzi never taught medicine he was consulted for his medical\nexpertise (see Park 2006: 175–76) and frequently considered\nmedical teachings in his writings on wondrous phenomena,\nAristotle’s zoological writings, and Meteorologica IV\n(see Perfetti 2004: xliii–xlv; Martin 2002). During this first\nstint at Padua, he wrote Quaestio de maximo et minimo\n(Question on the Maximum and the Minimum), attacking William\nHeytesbury and the calculatory tradition (see Biard 2009). Beginning\nin the 1330s, Heytesbury and others at Merton College at Oxford\napplied mathematical and logical analysis on a range topics, including\nnatural philosophical questions regarding kinetics. Pomponazzi\nremained hostile to the calculatory and terminist traditions\nthroughout his life because he considered their interpretations of\nAristotle’s texts as veering too far from a strict exegesis of\nAristotle. In 1496, Pomponazzi left Padua, after disputing with\nAgostino Nifo, and tutored Prince Alberto Pio da Carpi, who was in\nexile at Ferrara. He then taught at the university at Ferrara for a\nyear, before returning to Padua. Alberto Pio remained for years a\nsupporter of Aristotelian thought, commissioning translations of\nAverroes and Aristotle; Pomponazzi dedicated his 1514 De\nintensione et remissione formarum (On the Intension and\nRemission of Forms) to him (see Schmitt 1984). \nAfter returning to Padua in 1499, he taught natural philosophy there\nuntil 1509, when the university closed due to the War of the League of\nCambrai. He returned briefly to Ferrara and then to his native Mantua,\nbefore moving to the university of Bologna in 1511, where he remained\nfor the rest of his life, teaching natural and moral philosophy (Oliva\n1926: 265). His years at Bologna were both productive and filled with\ncontroversy. All his works printed during the sixteenth century stem\nfrom his tenure at Bologna (Lohr 1988: 347–62). In 1514 he\ncompleted a disputation on the intension and remission of forms; and\nin 1515 he published the question De reactione (On\nReaction). A year later he published Tractatus de\nimmortalitate animae (Treatise on the Immortality of the\nSoul). The work defends a materialist reading of Aristotle in\nwhich the human soul depends on and perishes with the body. The\ntreatise came out three years after the Fifth Lateran Council issued\nthe bull Apostolici regiminis. The bull demanded that\nphilosophers refrain from teaching that the soul is one in number, is\nmortal, and that the universe eternal. It also demanded that\nphilosophers defend Christian doctrine to the best of their ability.\nAs Pomponazzi’s teaching appeared to many to run against the\nbull, he was attacked, but also defended, by a number of scholars and\necclesiastical authorities. Although he was charged with heresy, he\nwas not tried, being under the protection of the powerful Venetian\nCardinal Pietro Bembo (see Pine 1986: 124–28). \nDespite these controversies, Pomponazzi maintained his position at\nBologna and continued to teach and write, pursuing many of the themes\nof his psychological writings. In 1520, he completed De naturalium\neffectuum admirandorum causis sive de incantationibus (On the\nCauses of Marvelous Natural Effects or On Incantations). The work\ncirculated in manuscript widely before being printed first in 1556 and\nagain in 1567 (Regnicoli 2010). In the same year he finished De\nfato, de libero arbitrio, de praedestinatione (On Fate, Free\nWill, On Predestination), which was not printed until 1567. In\n1521, he published De nutritione et augmentatione (On\nNutrition and Growth). Given greater freedom to choose the\nsubject of his lectures as the result of contract negotiations,\nPomponazzi lectured on a number of Aristotle’s writings that\nwere not part of the typical duties of an ordinary professor. These\ntopics include Aristotle’s De generatione et\ncorruptione and his zoological and meteorological writings. His\nDubitationes in quartum Meteorologicorum librum (Doubts on\nMeteorologica IV) were printed in 1563. Pomponazzi, after several\nyears of illness, died from kidney disease in 1525 (Nardi 1965:\n205–6). \nThere are numerous challenges to interpreting the writings of\nPomponazzi. In addition to his writings printed during the sixteenth\ncentury, many reportationes (transcripts) made by listeners\nof his lectures are extant. Due to the nature of their creation, they\npotentially contain errors or are incomplete. At times, they appear to\npresent conflicting views. Filled with witticisms and ironic\nstatements, they reveal insights into Pomponazzi’s popularity as\na lecturer. Adding to the difficulty of interpretation, are\nPomponazzi’s repeated statements of not having a solution to\nphilosophical questions and promoting the idea that philosophy teaches\nthe practice of doubting (Perfetti 1999). Accordingly, he questioned\nat times both ecclesiastical authority and the prevailing\nphilosophical environment of Padua and Bologna that was characterized\nby Averroism. \nAn additional impediment in interpreting Pomponazzi stems from his\narguments that is characterized as in naturalibus (based on\nnature). Similarly, he at times described himself as following the\nvia peripatetica (the Peripatetic path), which meant\ninvestigating according to Aristotelian principles without influence\nfrom other fields, most prominently theology. Restricting arguments to\nthose that are in naturalibus or following the via\nperipatetica entailed at times determining Aristotle’s\nview, regardless of its truth. Pomponazzi justified this approach on\nthe grounds that natural philosophy possesses different principles\nthan theology and therefore those fields should not use the principles\nof other fields. Consequently, at times he maintained that as a lay\nperson he was unable to pronounce on theological questions.\nFurthermore, his duties as professor of philosophy, as in essence a\nprofessional Aristotelian, required him to expound the views of\nAristotle, regardless of their conformity with theological truth.\nThus, he included provisos in On the Immortality of the Soul\nand On Incantations that stated that his conclusions were\nmerely according to philosophy and that he accepted the determinations\nof the Catholic Church as having a greater degree of authority than\nphilosophy. Some of his contemporaries and later scholars have seen\nthe inclusion of these provisos as being disingenuous, merely a means\nto protect himself from prosecution (Renan 1852: 286]; Pine\n1986: 123). But, other scholars have argued for the philosophical\ncoherence of his employment of probable arguments and deference to\nfaith (see Perrone Compagni 1999: lxxxv–xcvi). In the thirteenth\ncentury, Albertus Magnus had distinguished between investigations of\nnature and the divine, contending that the fields have distinct\nmethods and that revelation disagrees at times with arguments based on\nreason and experience (Martin 2014: 16–18). Although at times\nAlbertus’s position was controversial, a number of medieval\nphilosophers endorsed his view. Thus even if Pomponazzi included these\nprovisos as a protective measure, he nevertheless simultaneously\nendorsed a long medieval tradition that held that natural philosophy\nwas separate from theology and that theological truths prevailed over\nphilosophical ones. \nPomponazzi used the methods and language typical of the medieval\nscholastic tradition (Kraye 2010), primarily relying on reason and\nexperience as the key tools for investigation. The former refers to\nthe logical and philosophical principles of Aristotelianism, the\nlatter refers to both quotidian experience and the experiences found\nin the writings of authorities, witnessed in testimonies of\ncontemporaries, and taken from his own personal history. He had a\ncritical attitude toward humanist writers, for example, judging\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola’s attack on astrology to be\nignorant of the workings of the field. And while his Latin prose did\nnot match they polished elegance of Renaissance humanists, in other\nways his writings, through its extensive consideration of ancient\nsources, reflects developments of humanism. Despite never learning\nGreek, as many of his fellow philosophers did, including his rival\nAgostino Nifo, Pomponazzi relied on recent translations of Greek\ncommentators on Aristotle, most significantly Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(Kessler 2011). Furthermore, his later writings, especially On\nIncantations, take evidence from a broad range of Greek, Roman,\nand Renaissance poets and historians, interspersed among citations of\nthe typical authorities of the scholastic traditions. In that work, he\nalso discussed the possible natural causes of the Delphic oracle (see\nOssa-Richardson 2010). \nPomponazzi’s most complete discussion of the human soul was\npublished in his 1516 On the Immortality of the Soul. The\nwork builds on earlier discussions found in quaestiones\ndelivered in 1503 and 1504 (Poppi 1970: 27–92; Kristeller 1944)\nand in lectures on the De anima given in 1514–15\n(Bakker 2007). In On the Immortality of the Soul, he sought\nto establish whether the human intellect is separable and immortal\nusing a methodology that did not exceed “natural limits”,\nthat is, without supposing “something from faith or\nrevelation” and to determine what is “in conformity with\nthe words of Aristotle” (ch. 8). He cautioned that he did not\naffirm anything contrary to Thomas Aquinas’s views but his\ncritiques advance “in the way of doubt and not of\nassertion” (ch. 8). Moreover, he tempered his considerations by\ndeclaring his preference for scripture over “human reasoning and\nexperience” (ch. 8). \nIn what manner the human intellect is separable was a frequently\ndebated question in Renaissance discussions of the soul. Many of\nPomponazzi’s contemporaries adopted Averroes’ solution\nthat the possible or material intellect must be one in number and thus\nshared by all humans. Pomponazzi rejected Averroes’ view,\ndeeming it “most false, unintelligible, monstrous, and quite\nforeign to Aristotle” (ch. 4). After rejecting Averroes’\nunicity thesis, Pomponazzi maintained that the most probable arguments\naccording to natural philosophy and Aristotle’s view are\ncontrary to Thomas’s position that the individual human\nintellect is immortal, separable, and unqualifiedly immaterial. \nA central premise for Pomponazzi’s psychology is that the entire\nhuman soul falls under the study of natural philosophy. The human soul\nhas three powers—vegetative, sensitive, rational—but is\nunified; these powers do not have distinct substantial forms (see\nCasini 2007). Pomponazzi generally referred not to the intellect but\nrather to the intellective soul, meaning the rational power of the\nhuman soul (Sellars 2016). This intellective soul, or rational soul,\nrests midway between the eternal and perishable (ch. 1; see Bakker\n2007: 165–67). Accordingly, he emphasized the relation between\nthe intellectual soul and the sensitive soul, citing Aristotle’s\nstatement that “the soul does not know at all without some\nphantasm (phantasma)” (De anima 3.7\n431a16–17). The intellectual soul’s dependence on these\nphantasms—images that the imagination creates based on what has\nbeen sensed—is confirmed for Pomponazzi not just by\nAristotle’s authority but also by our own experience and by\nexperiences with those who have suffered injuries to the relevant\norgans. Since the sensitive soul resides within a material organ and\nsensation occurs in time, it is dependent on matter both with respect\nto subject (i.e., the sense organ) and object (i.e., the sensible).\nThe human intellectual or rational soul, however, is dependent on\nmatter for its object (i.e., the phantasms) but only immaterial with\nrespect to its subject (i.e., cognition) (see Brenet 2009). \nBecause the human intellectual soul depends on the operations of the\nsensitive soul, which are part of a material perishable body, it\ncannot function after the body has been destroyed. Accordingly, in\nPomponazzi’s view, the human intellectual soul is immortal only\nin a relative or qualified sense. Because the act of understanding\ndoes not require a material organ as subject, the human intellectual\nsoul is more immortal than the sensitive soul or the souls of animals.\nThe human soul partakes in the immortal through its limited knowledge\nof the forms of species, without being immortal in itself. Yet because\nit cannot function without the sensitive soul, it is lower than\nGod’s intelligence and than the intelligences that move the\nspheres, which are separated substances. Moreover, the human soul\ndiffers from these separated intelligences in that it is the\nactualization of a body while the intelligences merely actuate, that\nis, set in motion, the celestial spheres without receiving anything\nfrom the matter of the orb. The human’s soul dependency on\nmatter means that human cognition is less abstracted than that of the\nintelligences, which know through intuition not sensation. Accordingly\nthe human soul cannot know universals unqualifiedly but only in\nrelation to singulars. Thereby, the human rational soul, with its\nfunctioning tied to material objects, sits midway between the material\nand the immaterial and between the eternal and the perishable; and\nhuman knowledge, while partaking in the knowledge of universals,\npossesses it in limited manner (ch. 8). \nWhile most scholarship has emphasized Pomponazzi’s argument\nrelated to the connection between the intellectual and sensitive soul,\nhe put forth several other arguments based on Aristotelian principles\nagainst the immortality of individual human souls. He argued that if\nthe human soul survives the death of the body at that point it must be\nan individual indivisible substance that is either in some place or\nnowhere. If it is somewhere, it must have arrived there through\nlocomotion, yet Aristotle denies that indivisibles can move in space.\nIf it is nowhere, then Aristotle could have posited intelligences that\ndo not move the spheres and potentially there could exist an infinite\nnumber of intelligences, which in turn is prohibited by\nAristotle’s arguments against the realization of an infinite\nmultitude. Similarly, he argued that if human souls are immortal and\nindividual, given that the world and its species are eternal according\nto Aristotle, the number of human souls must be infinite or souls must\ntransmigrate, both propositions that Aristotle rejected. Additionally,\nPomponazzi dismissed Thomas’s view that God creates each human\nsoul placed within the body as being an explanation unacceptable to\nnatural philosophy because Aristotle held that according to natural\nphilosophy the soul is not created but rather generated “by the\nsun and man” (Physics 2.2. 194b13) and everything that\nis generated perishes (ch. 8). \nGiven the importance of the immortality of the soul to Catholic\ndoctrine, Pomponazzi considered the ramifications of the soul’s\nmortality to ethics and the possibility of human happiness and\nblessedness (see Cuttini 2012). He countered the argument that\nimmortality of the soul is necessary for a happy end achieved by\nperfecting the intellect by contending that achieving such\nintellectual perfection is only possible for someone with superior\nintellectual ability, of sound health, who has withdrawn from worldly\naffairs. Yet, such individuals are extremely rare—“even in\nlong centuries, barely one is found”—and the human race\nand its societies do not permit all humans to devote themselves to\nphilosophy (ch. 13). To the potential objection that belief in the\nmortality of the soul encourages immoral acts because otherwise some\npersons would choose to commit crimes because there would be no\npunishment or rewards after death, Pomponazzi responded that their are\nsufficient motivations for virtue without considerations of the\nafterlife. In his view, the essential reward of virtue is virtue\nitself, which is humankind’s greatest good and brings security\nand peace of mind. Accordingly, the religious teachings of immortality\nare not true according to the principles of natural philosophy but\nwere introduced in order to persuade those incapable of understanding\nphilosophy to behave in a moral fashion, thereby allowing society to\nfunction (ch. 14). \nPomponazzi, keeping with his earlier statements that his arguments\nwere probable and according to natural principles, concluded that the\nquestion of the immortality of the soul is a neutral problem, meaning\nthat there are no arguments based only on nature that prove either\nimmortality or mortality. His application of the term “neutral\nproblem” was not novel. John Duns Scotus had come to the same\nconclusion about the immortality of the soul; and Thomas Aquinas\nregarded the question of the eternity of the world as a neutral\nproblem. Consequently, faith is the ultimate arbiter of the question,\nand Pomponazzi maintained that Christians must follow the doctrine of\nimmortality that has been established by the Church fathers and Pope\nGregory I, who were the greatest experts in divine matters (ch.\n15). \nOn the Immortality of the Soul provoked numerous polemics, in\nwhich Pomponazzi defended his views. In 1518, he published\nApologia (Apology) in response to the 1517 attack by\nhis former student Gaspare Contarini. In 1519, Pomponazzi published\nthe Defensorium (Defense) in reply to Agostino\nNifo’s attacks. The Defense was printed together with\nGiovanni Crisostomo Javelli’s work that bolstered Pomponazzi.\nThe theologians Ambrogio Flandino and Bartolomeo Spina also published\nattacks on Pomponazzi’s treatment of the soul (see Blum 2007:\n223–28). \nIn 1520, Pomponazzi finished On Incantations, a work that\nexpanded many of the themes of his psychological works. The book\nundermines the use of demonic and supernatural explanations for\nsublunary phenomena. The work is presented as a response to the\nquestion: How would Aristotelians explain what “seems to be\nbeyond the order of nature”, (praeter naturae ordinem)\nor, in other words, seems preternatural? The category of preternatual,\nwhich included a large range of strange and seemingly irregular\nphenomena, formed the subject matter of numerous early modern\nphilosophical inquiries (see Daston 2000). With respect to On\nIncantations, Pomponazzi’s friend, Ludovico Paniza, asked\nhim to explain the extraordinary recoveries of three boys from a skin\ndisease, burns, and a sword that physicians cannot remove\n(Praefatio.1). The actions of demons can explain these\nrecoveries. Pomponazzi stated that these demonic acts are justified in\naccordance with ecclesiastical law (ex decreto Ecclesiae) and\nare capable of “saving many experiences”. Yet, Pomponazzi\ncontended that Aristotelians would not use demons to explain these\nwondrous events. In Pomponazzi’s view even if demons exist, a\npremise that Aristotle did not admit according to Pomponazzi’s\ninterpretation of Metaphysics Lambda, they would not be able\nto affect the sublunary world because they would not have adequate\nknowledge of its particulars. Demons’ knowledge of sublunary\nparticulars must derive either through essences or from sensation and\nphantasmata (i.e., mental images). Knowledge through\nessences, however, does not provide knowledge of singulars but only\nuniversals and species. Moreover, knowledge from sensation and\nphantasmata entails generation, corruption, and corporeality,\nproperties which cannot belong to demons (1.1). \nDemons’ lack of knowledge of natural particulars is merely one\nreason they cannot be the cause of wondrous sublunary events. Citing\nAugustine, Pomponazzi contended that all theologians hold that while\ndemons can directly move bodies from one place to another they cannot\nalter them directly but must do so through natural bodies. Yet,\nPomponazzi rejected the likelihood that demons affect change by\napplying active powers to passives, just like humans imperfectly do\nwhen they apply healing medicines. For Pomponazzi, this understanding\nof demonic action is untenable because it requires demons to use\nsensible material substances, which would be detectable. Presumably\ndemons must carry these substances in pillboxes and bags, all of which\nis contrary to experience. Finally, he concluded that it is\nsuperfluous to suppose demonic influence “because we can save\nthese kinds of experiences through natural causes” (1.2).\nAccordingly, the first half of On Incantations posits\nhypothetical natural causes of preternatural experiences in an attempt\nto show the inadequacy and superfluity of demonic explanation\n(1.3). \nEmploying doctrines key to natural magic, Pomponazzi put forth three\npotential ways that natural causes could explain wondrous effects:\ndirectly through manifest causes, such as heat and cold; through\noccult qualities or powers; or indirectly through vapors and spirits\nthat had been altered by such powers (3.1–3). In support of\nthese explanations, citing Albertus Magnus, Marsilio Ficino, Pliny,\nand unnamed botanists, he maintained that herbs, stones, minerals, and\nanimal extracts possess nearly countless occult powers and that if we\nknew them it would be possible to reduce those effects that the\nunlearned attribute to demons and angels to the actions of these\noccult powers. In support of the existence of these occult powers\nPomponazzi described experiences with herbal medicines, magnets,\nelectric rays (torpedines), and remoras—fish that\nallegedly could halt ships with the power of their\nmouths—experiences, all verified as most true by respected\nauthorities (3.2–3). \nAdditionally, Pomponazzi contended that similar powers reside in\nhumans, either through the temperament, the sensitive soul, or the\nintellectual soul. He based this contention on the fact that human\ntemperaments were widely recognized to affect and determine human\nhabits, inclinations, and physiognomy (3.4). Following\nAristotle’s De motu animalium and Ficino’s\nPlatonic Theology, he\nargued that the actions of the soul are not only spiritual but also\nreal and cause alterations in the body, as is manifest in the physical\naffects of emotions, such as tremors and blushing (3.6). Finally, he\nmaintained that it is possible that the human mind can produce what it\nthinks through real bodily means, such as spirit and blood, in an\nanalogous way to the intelligences that produce the sublunary world\nthrough corporal intermediaries, namely the celestial bodies\n(3.6). \nApplying these causes, Pomponazzi explained that many of those accused\nof necromancy, like the medieval physicians and astrologers Pietro\nd’Abano and Cecco d’Ascoli, were merely very knowledgeable\nand capable of applying actives to passives (4.1). Moreover, it is\npossible that some humans have extraordinary occult powers that allow\nthem to affect cures through touch, like the kings of France, or to\nperform other marvelous feats such as charming snakes and opening\ndoors without touching them (4.2). Additionally, Pomponazzi argued\nthat the powers of imagination can produce real effects. For example,\nhe cited the widespread belief that women’s thoughts at the time\nof conception will produce a fetus that is similar to those thoughts.\nTherefore, the power of fascination and imaginative powers transmitted\nthrough vapors might explain unexpected cures and diseases just as\nthey are supposedly responsible for the spread of leprosy and plague\n(4.3). While Pomponazzi admitted that some supposedly magical works\nare acts of deception—such as contemporary examples of\nfraudulent magicians conjuring through sieves—he allowed that it\nmight be possible that some men to possess individual natural occult\npowers that allow them to move a sieve or transmit vapors through\nprayers so that they form images on mirrors (4.4). Pomponazzi used\nthis analysis to respond to the possible objection that these three\nkinds of natural causes eliminate the acceptance of miracles. He\nconceded that many of the deeds reported in the bible can be\n“superficially reduced to a natural causes”, but that many\ncannot, such as the resurrection of Lazarus, the eclipse during the\ncrucifixion of Jesus, and the satisfaction of the hunger of thousand\npeople with five loaves of bread and two fish (7.7). Furthermore,\nwhile he conceded that there is a remote possibility that the cross\nfound in Saint Catherine’s heart and Saint Francis’s\nstigmata arose from natural causes, he nonetheless stated it is more\nlikely and more pious to understand them as miracles (7.8). \nPerhaps the most controversial portions of On Incantations\nsurround his explanation of why both pagan and monotheistic societies\ngive credence to the works of demons. His answer derives from his\nlargely Aristotelian and Averroistic conception of the ordering of the\nuniverse (see Perrone Compagni 2011: xxxiii–lxxi). For\nPomponazzi, God is both the final and efficient cause of the universe,\na view he put forth in his earlier quaestiones on\nAverroes’ De substantia orbis (Pomponazzi Corsi inediti:\n1:299–304) God,\npossessing knowledge of the essences of all species of beings,\narranges the universe through the celestial intelligences (10.1). In\nturn, the celestial intelligences through the powers of the stars\ncause the eternal cycles of change in the universe. Accordingly, the\nentire arrangement of the world, including human society and religion,\nreflects and derives from God’s power. Thus, the pronouncements\nin favor of the existence of demonic works from serious and important\nauthorities, both religious lawmakers and philosophers including\nPlato, are the result not of their truth but of their usefulness for\ncreating a virtuous populace. Since a large portion of humanity is\nincapable of understanding philosophical truths, lawmakers have\ncreated and employed myths or fables to inculcate virtue. The\nlegislator is like the physician who deceives a patient for the\npatient’s own good, in composing such fables because they\ncontribute to his larger purpose; these fables should not be judged as\nphilosophical doctrines—they contain neither falsity or\ntruthfulness per se but have an allegorical or poetic\nmeaning. For Pomponazzi, these myths are not cynical and used merely\nto gain political power but are harmonious with the universe’s\nnature and order, as arranged by God and the celestial intelligences.\nPolitical authority and obedience are necessary for ensuring the\npersistence of political structures that are ordained for humanity,\nfor which nature has given leaders and organization just as it has for\nflock animals, like bees and quail (10.2). Consequently the growth and\ndecline of religions are in accordance with the cyclical workings of\nnature. \nPomponazzi’s judgment that the bulk of humanity is incapable of\nunderstanding philosophical truths corresponds to his statements in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul about the differences between\ndivine and human souls and the infrequency of humans who develop into\nphilosophers with comprehensive and accurate knowledge of nature and\nthe universe. The inability of nearly all of humanity to understand\ntrue causes has led to further misunderstandings of prodigies, omens,\ndivination, and oracles. Pomponazzi held that, instead of being direct\nmessages from God, they are reflections of a purposeful and\nwell-ordered universe. \nHaving dismissed Pico della Mirandola’s polemic against\nastrology, Pomponazzi contended that fields such as astrology and\nphysiognomy read signs that are causally connected, through celestial\ninfluences or physiological links. Celestial prodigies, omens, and\napparitions in the sky both signal and cause future events by\naffecting vapors and spirits that in turn influence the outcomes of\nhuman activity. Some apparitions, such as the recent image of Saint\nCelestine that appeared in the sky above Aquila while its residents\nprayed for protection from excessive rain, result from the collective\nimagination affecting vapors, exhalations, and clouds (see Giglioni\n2010). Moreover, Pomponazzi argued that the fact that the prodigies\nare indicative explains their purpose and final cause that is linked\nto nature, which is interdependent, well ordered, and under\nGod’s providence. The possibility of using prodigies to predict\nthe future is analogous to physicians’ ability to give prognoses\nfor diseases using symptoms that seemingly are not directly connected\nto the maladies. Similarly ignorant people have mistakenly understood\nthe prognostications of sibyls and other seers as being caused by\ndemons when in fact they possess either extraordinary occult natural\npowers or are caused by the powers of stars. \nInvoking celestial powers, occult virtues, the force of the\nimagination, and the intermediary actions of vapors and spirits,\nPomponazzi contended that by using only Aristotelian natural\nprinciples it was possible to save or explain seemingly miraculous and\npreternatural phenomena. Pomponazzi accepted the veracity of nearly\nall this phenomena, trusting in the accounts of contemporaries and\nancient histories (12.9). The work is a critique of demonic\nexplanations but not of the reports of these alleged events. \nIn the closing of On Incantations, Pomponazzi stated that\nwhile he believed that what the Peripatetics would have probably\n(verisimiliter) believed is in agreement with Christianity,\nhe would nevertheless revoke the entire work and submit himself to the\nCatholic Church in the event that this writing opposed Catholic\ndoctrine (Peroratio.1). A number of interpreters have found\nthis conclusion to be disingenuous; the Holy Office placed the work on\nthe Index of Prohibited books by the 1570s. A censor wrote that while\nPomponazzi put forth arguments that seem to undermine the existence of\nmiracles he did make strong ones in their favor (Baldini & Spruit\n2009: vol. 1, tome 3, 2279). \nSeveral months after Pomponazzi completed On Incantations in\n1520, he finished De fato, de libero arbitrio, et de\npraestinatione, (On Fate, Free Will, and Predestination)\na work that addressed Alexander of Aphrodisias’s De\nfato,\nwhich had been printed in Girolamo Bagolino’s Latin translation\nin 1516. In this work, Alexander criticized Stoic deterministic\nunderstandings of causation because they deny the possibility of\nchance, contingency, and human choice. In On Fate, Pomponazzi\nlargely sided not with Alexander but in favor of his Stoic\nopposition. \nThe premise of Pomponazzi’s arguments coincides with his\nunderstanding of causation presented in On Incantations. The\nwork also reaffirms the limitations placed on the human intellect in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul. In On Fate,\nPomponazzi argued that God, as efficient cause of the world, acts on\nthe sublunary world using the celestial bodies. God is the principal\ncause and the celestial bodies are the instrumental cause of\naccidental effects in the sublunary world, which Alexander and Thomas\nAquinas viewed as contingent and without a cause (1.7.II/15). The\ncelestial bodies’ motion, contiguous to the lower world, drives\nand determines alterations on earth. Therefore, accidental effects,\nultimately resulting from God acting as an efficient cause, occur by\nnecessity (1.7.II/16). Pomponazzi maintained that they are mistakenly\ncalled contingent as a result of human ignorance of causes and future\nevents but not from any irregularity in matter, natural powers, or\ncelestial influences. Rather, all accidental effects and what appears\nto result from luck or chance can be traced back to fixed causes\n(1.7.II/23–26). \nApplying this deterministic framework, Pomponazzi rejected\nAlexander’s understanding of free will as the ability to choose\nbetween alternatives. Pomponazzi maintained that human will functions\njust like the rest of nature. It depends on an external mover, namely\nGod’s will and the celestial motions, which are eternal\n(1.9.2.10). Just as for other natural beings, if there is a\npotentiality and no impediment, by necessity the potentiality will be\nrealized. Thus, the human will reacts to external factors according to\nits powers and the absence of impediments (1.9.2.12). Consequently,\nthe human will depends on higher, universal causes. The apparent\nability of humans to deliberate between choices using reason, however,\nis an illusion because every actor is in fact directed toward one of\nthe choices by external causes (1.9.3.2–4). \nThe rejection of the existence of free will presented difficult\nramifications for Christian ethics and theology, which depend on the\nfreedom to choose a virtuous life. In resolving these difficulties,\nPomponazzi chose fate over freedom because he thought that it better\npreserved God’s complete power and providence. If God had\ngranted freedom to humans, the lack, or extreme rarity, of truly\nvirtuous humans on earth demonstrates the absence of a truly\nprovidential plan in which humans freedom to choose a completely moral\ngood life is realized. Similarly, if humans have the ability of free\nchoice, God must not know these future decisions and humans are\nthereby limited with respect to his knowledge and power. As a\nconsequence, Pomponazzi opted for fate and determinism, rejecting what\nhe considered to be a denial of God’s providence, omnipotence,\nand omniscience. The world’s order and the cosmic laws that\ngovern the eternal motions of the universe include the existence of\ngood and evil as part of the necessary cycles of change. \nAt the beginning of the third book, Pomponazzi maintained that his\nnaturalistic arguments (argumentationes naturales) of the\nfirst two books were by no means certain and were to be rejected if\nthey contradicted the teachings of the Catholic Church (3.1.1). He\nthen proposed to find solutions to the questions of fate and divine\nprovidence that preserve free will. Accordingly, Pomponazzi, seemingly\nin opposition to the arguments outlined in the first two books, opened\nthe door for the possibility of freedom of choice that potentially\ncould be in line with Christian theology by identifying the human will\nwith the intellect. He argued that God limited his omnipotence and\nforeknowledge, thereby allowing for the possibility of future\ncontingents. This divine self-limitation allows for the possibility\nthat the human intellect, through the power of deliberation, is\ncapable of suspending predetermined acts of volition that go against\nthe moral interests of the actor, thereby being able to choose to sin\nor not sin. Human liberty is defined in negative terms, a privation\nand a suspension, since the will does not produce action in these\ninstances but only impedes it (3.8). While some commentators have seen\nthis line of argumentation as a potential “line of defense for\nthe opinio christiana”, (Poppi 1988: 659) it was\nspecifically condemned in 1576 by a censor who placed the work on the\nindex of prohibited books (Baldini & Spruit 2009: 1,3:\n2279–80). \nThe fifth and final book of On Fate continues the theological\ndiscussions of the previous two books, turning to an examination of\npredestination., a concept that according to Pomponazzi is not\nmentioned by philosophers but is key to Christian theology, being tied\nto doctrines on fate and God’s providence. In this book, he put\nforward two distinct, incompatible accounts of predestination. The\nfirst account argues that God does not act in an indeterminate or\ncontingent manner and therefore, has determined everything for\neternity, eliminating the importance or even possibility of human\nchoice (5.2). The second account argues that God has created the\nuniverse perfect with respect to all its parts, including humans who\nhave the capacity to choose, or refrain from, sin. God, however, has\nnot made all humans equal with respect to their ability to obtain\nperfection, and only some have been granted grace or are\n“elected”. This election, or grace is not certain, as\nthose that have been chosen still have the possibility to choose to\nsin and thereby forfeit the grace that had been conceded to them. The\nchosen, however, who follow God’s will can be certain to obtain\nthe glory that God has conditionally promised (5.7). The epilogue\nreiterates his conviction that the Stoic conception of the universe is\npreferable. He maintained that if the universe is like an animal, the\nsublunary world represents excrements, while the heavenly spheres are\nperfect, free of evil. Finally, he confessed that he has never\nunderstood how Christian theologians preserve divine providence and\nhuman free will, describing it as an illusion and a trick\n(5.epilogus.7–10). \nThat the first two books of On Fate at times seem to be in\ndisagreement with the latter three presents difficulties for\ninterpreting it, having led some scholars to assume Pomponazzi’s\ntrue position, which corresponds to arguments in On\nIncantations, are found in the first books (see Poppi 1988).\nOthers have seen the last three books as an attempt to undermine\nChristianity by demonstrating the weakness or incompatibility of the\nChristian doctrines of predestination and God’s omnipotence and\nomniscience (see Di Napoli 1970). Alternatively, scholars have seen\nthe latter books to be a genuine attempt to critique and reform\nThomistic theology (see Perrone Compagni 2004: cix–clviii) that\noffers innovative solutions to outstanding theological problems (see\nRamberti 2007: 109–50). \nPomponazzi elaborated on many themes found in On Fate, On\nIncantations, and On the Immortality of the Soul in the\nfinal years of his life while he lectured on Aristotle’s\nParva naturalia, De generatione et corruptione,\nDe partibus animalium, and the Meteorologica. The\nonly new work printed these years was a On Growth and\nNutrition (1521), which discussed a central topic of De\ngeneratione et corruptione. The work is explicitly naturalistic\nin outlook and provides potential natural explanations for what some\nconsidered miracles—that St. Paul’s tongue spoke after his\nhead was severed from his body—in addition to asserting that the\nhuman intellect requires a bodily organ (1.11, 1.23; see Ramberti\n2010). \nHis lectures on De partibus animalium display his skepticism\ntoward complete human knowledge of the natural world (see Perfetti\n1999). This skepticism displayed in the biological works also appears\nin his lectures on Aristotle’s Meteorologica, in which\nhe puts forward doubts about knowledge of the final causes of\ndisasters and the certainty of a number of meteorological explanations\n(see Martin 2011: 30–33, 44–50). Yet, in these lectures he\nfollowed several teachings of On Incantations, affirming the\nplace of prodigies in the ordering of the universe and the role of the\nstars in causing sublunary change (see Graiff 1976). \nGiven the controversial nature of many of his writings and the\ndifficulty in interpreting his works, Pomponazzi’s influence was\nvaried. Opponents accused him of undermining organized religion,\nabetting Lutheranism, and contributing to the development of atheism.\nAlternatively, he has been praised for promoting intellectual freedom,\nimproving methods for interpreting Aristotle, and preparing the way\nfor the materialism and positivism of modern science. \nAlthough,his writings do not appear to follow the demand of\nApostolici regiminis that philosophers defend Catholic dogma\nto the best of their ability, ecclesiastical authorities did little to\nenforce the Fifth Lateran Council. While never convicted of heresy,\nnevertheless the last years of his life as well as the immediate\naftermath were filled with accusations of heterodoxy, including the\nburning of his books at Venice. Some adversaries, such as Ambrogio\nFlandino, associated On Fate with Martin Luther’s and\nHus’s denials of free will, an association that continued\nthroughout the sixteenth century (Del Soldato 2010). That Guglielmo\nGratarolo, a Calvinist exiled from Bergamo living in Basel, printed\nOn Incantations and On Fate, potentially confirmed\nperceived links to heterodoxy (Maclean 2005). As the Counter\nReformation more clearly defined Catholic orthodoxy in the second half\nof the sixteenth century, many Catholic theologians and philosophers,\nespecially Jesuits, saw his teachings as noxious and a potential\nsource of heresy. During the seventeenth century, concerns over\nPomponazzi grew in part due to the convicted and executed heretic\nGiulio Cesare Vanini (d. 1619), who appropriated a number of\nPomponazzi’s arguments. Subsequently, many scholars, including\nFrançois Garasse, Marin Mersenne, and Tommaso Campanella,\nlinked him to atheism and to Niccolò Machiavelli’s\npromotion of religious imposture as a political tool. Yet he still had\nhis defenders. The erudite Frenchman Gabriel Naudé praised\nPomponazzi both for his wit and for his historically accurate\ninterpretation of Aristotle. As a result, Pomponazzi became linked to\nseventeenth-century libertinism (Martin 2014: 94–95,\n124–44). \nDespite numerous negative assessments, some sixteenth-century\nphilosophers pursued Pomponazzi’s approach. For example, Simone\nPorzio, a professor of philosophy at Pisa, followed his mortalist and\nAlexandrian take on the human intellect (Del Soldato 2010). Even\nthough, many condemned his view that the soul dies with the body\nthroughout the seventeenth century, Pierre Bayle absolved Pomponazzi\nof impiety, found him to an example of freedom of thought, and praised\nhim for his ethical teachings that spurned the inducements of the\nafterlife (Bayle 1740: vol. 3, 777–83). In the nineteenth\ncentury, he was championed by positivists such as Ernest Renan and\nRoberto Ardigò, who upheld Pomponazzi as a model for the\nscientific spirit that opposed religious oppression (Ardigò\n1869; Renan 1852: 284–88). During the twentieth century,\na number of scholars endorsed the views of seventeenth-century\nlibertines, interpreting Pomponazzi as insincere, a promoter of\nreligious imposture, or as a determined enemy of Christianity (see\nBusson 1957: 44–69; Charbonnel 1919: 220–74,\n389–438). Accordingly, he gained among some the epithet\n“Radical Philosopher” (see Pine 1986). Other scholars,\nfollowing the leads of Bruno Nardi and Paul Oskar Kristeller, placed\nhim in the context of the secular tradition of medieval philosophy\nthat separated theology from philosophy. Under that interpretation,\nPomponazzi was not necessarily an instigator, or harbinger, of the\nconflicts between church and science of the modern period but rather\nbetter understood as participating in a continuation of scholastic\nphilosophy’s practices, which included open inquiry, that began\nin the thirteenth century.","contact.mail":"craigedwin.martin@unive.it","contact.domain":"unive.it"}]
