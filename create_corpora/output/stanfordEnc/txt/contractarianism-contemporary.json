In its\nrecognizably modern form, however, the idea is revived by Thomas\nHobbes; it was developed in different ways by John Locke, Jean-Jacques\nRousseau, and Immanuel Kant. After Kant, the idea largely fell into\ndisrepute until it was resurrected by John Rawls. It is now at the\nheart of the work of a number of moral and political\nphilosophers. \n\n\nThe basic idea seems simple: in some way, the agreement of all\nindividuals subject to collectively enforced social arrangements shows\nthat those arrangements have some normative property (they are\nlegitimate, just, obligating, etc.). Even this basic idea, though, is\nanything but simple, and even this abstract rendering is objectionable\nin many ways. \n\n\nTo explicate the idea of the social contract we analyze contractual\napproaches into five elements: (1) the role of the social contract (2)\nthe parties (3) agreement (4) the object of agreement (5) what the\nagreement is supposed to show. \n\nThe aim of a social contract theory is to show that members of some\nsociety have reason to endorse and comply with the fundamental social\nrules, laws, institutions, and/or principles of that society. Put\nsimply, it is concerned with public justification, i.e., “of\ndetermining whether or not a given regime is legitimate and therefore\nworthy of loyalty” (D’Agostino 1996, 23). The ultimate\ngoal of state-focused social contract theories is to show that some\npolitical system can meet the challenge Alexander Hamilton raised in\nFederalist no. 1 of whether “men are really capable or\nnot of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or\nwhether they are forever destined to depend for their political\nconstitutions on accident and force” (Hamilton 1788). Going\nfurther, David Gauthier argues that any system of moral constraints\nmust be justified to those to whom it is meant to apply. “What\ntheory of morals,” Gauthier asks, “can ever serve any\nuseful purpose, unless it can show that all the duties it recommends\nare truly endorsed in each individual’s reason?” (1986,\n1).  \nThe ultimate goal, then, of social contract theories is to show, in\nthe most general sense, that social (moral, political, legal, etc.)\nrules can be rationally justified. This does not, however, distinguish\nthe social contract from other approaches in moral and political\nphilosophy, all of which attempt to show that moral and political\nrules are rationally justifiable in some sense. The true\ndistinctiveness of the social contract approach is that justification\ndoes not rely on some exogenous reason or truth. Justification is\ngenerated by rational agreement (or lack of rejection in T. M.\nScanlon’s version), not by the reasons that generate agreement.\nThat is, the fact that everyone in a society, given their individual\nreasoning, would agree to a certain rule or principle is the critical\njustification for that rule, rather than certain correct or sound\nreasons that sufficiently rational individuals would appreciate and,\nif appreciated, would lead to agreement.  \nAlthough contractarians differ in their account of the reasons of\nindividuals, with some being attracted to more objectivist accounts\n(Scanlon 2013), most follow Hobbes in modeling individual reasons as\nsubjective, motivationally internal, or at least agent-relative. This\nmay be because of skepticism about moral reasons generally (Gauthier\n1986, Binmore 1998), a conviction about the overwhelming importance of\nself-interest to the social order (Hobbes 1651, Buchanan 2000 [1975],\nBrennan and Buchanan 1985), a concern to take seriously the\ndisagreement of individual view in modern society, and this includes\ndifferences about objectivity (Gaus 2016, 2011a; Muldoon 2017; Moehler\n2014, 2015, forthcoming) or because this approach is consistent with\nthe most well-developed theories of rational choice in the social\nsciences (Binmore 2005, Buchanan 2000 [1975]). In any case, the\nreasons individuals have for agreeing to some rules or principles are\nimportantly their own reasons, not “good reasons” from the\nimpartial perspective. Of course, those same individuals may care\nabout what they perceive to be the impartial good or some other\nnon-individualistic notion—they need not be egoists—but\nwhat they care about, and so their reasons will differ from one\nanother. This point, as Rawls highlights in his later work, is crucial\nto understanding political justification in a diverse society where\nmembers of a society cannot reasonably be expected to have similar\nconceptions of the good (Rawls 1996). Recent contractarian accounts\nput even greater weight on heterogeneity (Southwood 2010, Gaus 2016,\nMuldoon 2017, Moehler forthcoming, Thrasher 2014b, Thrasher and\nVallier 2015, Thrasher 2015).  \nGiven these features, we can think of social contract theories as\nhaving a general schematic form. Social contract theories are a model\nof justification that have several general parameters that are set\ndifferently in different theories. What distinguishes contractarian\ntheories is how they specify these general parameters. The goal of the\nmodel is to represent our reasons for endorsing and complying with\nsome set of social rules, principles or institutions. This is done by\nshowing that some model representatives choosers who would agree to\nthese rules in some specified choice situation. Critically, there are\ntwo sets of relevant individuals (I and I*). The\nfirst set is the model choosers (I) constructed in the\n“device of representation” such as the original position.\nThe second set is composed of real individuals (I*) whose\nterms of interaction are to be guided by the contract. If the\ndeliberations of the contractors (I) are to be relevant to\nthe actual participants (I*), the reasoning of the former\nmust, in some way, be shared by the latter. Another variable is the\ndeliberative setting (M) in which the model choosers\n(I) endorse some principles or rules, principles, or\ninstitutions (R). Given all of this, we can identify a\ngeneral model of social contract theories: \nGeneral Model of the Social Contract: I\nchooses R in M and this gives I* reason to\nendorse and comply with R in the real world insofar as the\nreasons I has for choosing R in M are (or\ncan be) shared by I*\n \nThe social contract, then, is a model of rational\njustification translating the problem of justification (what reasons\nindividuals have) into a problem of deliberation (what rules they will\nagree to). As Rawls argues: \nAt the simplest level, models take something complex and make it\nsimpler. Along these lines, both the economist Ariel Rubinstein (2012)\nand the philosopher Nancy Cartwright (1991) compare models to fables.\nFables are stories that communicate some important lesson in a simple,\neasy to understand fashion. Fables, like models, communicate important\ngeneral rules through particular, though fictional, cases.  \nModels involve abstraction and idealization, but they do more than\nthat: they help us see what our key assumptions are, identify the\nfactors that we see as relevant (Gaus 2016, xv-xvii). Michael Weisberg\nconcurs that models, as techniques of idealization, do more than\nabstract (2007a, 2013). Consider the periodic table of the elements.\nIt is an abstraction, but not a model according to Weisberg. He calls\nabstractions like the periodic table abstract direct\nrepresentations to distinguish them from models (2007b). Modeling\nseeks to isolate the important features of the target phenomena,\nallowing the modeler to understand and manipulate important elements\nof the phenomena in simulations. John Rawls’s representatives to\nthe original position, for instance, are not only abstractions of real\npersons. They are idealizations that isolate particular aspects of\npersons that are relevant to justification as a choice, specifically\ntheir thin theory of rationality, and their values (in the form of\nprimary goods). Isolating these features is important for modeling the\nagreement procedure in Rawls’s theory.  \nThe social contract models our reasons for endorsing and complying\nwith some set of social rules or institutions. How the theory does\nthis depends on the assumptions made and the specification of the\nparameters.  \nHow the contract theorist models the parties to the agreement is\ndetermined by our (actual) justificatory problem, and what is\nrelevant to solving it. A major divide among contemporary social\ncontract theories thus involves defining the justificatory problem. A\ndistinction is often drawn between the Hobbesian\n(“contractarian”) and Kantian\n(“contractualist”) interpretations of the justificatory\nproblem. These categories are imprecise, and there is often as much\ndifference within these two approaches as between them, yet,\nnevertheless, the distinction is useful in isolating some key disputes\nin contemporary social contract theory. Among those\n“contractarians” who—very roughly—can\nbe called followers of Hobbes, the crucial justificatory task is, as\nGauthier (1991, 16) puts it, to resolve the “foundational\ncrisis” of morality: \nIf our justificatory problem is not simply to understand what morality\nrequires, but whether morality ought to be paid attention to, or\ninstead dismissed as a superstition based on outmoded metaphysical\ntheories, then obviously the parties to the agreement must not employ\nmoral judgments in their reasoning. Another version of this concern is\nGregory Kavka’s (1984) description of the project to reconcile\nmorality with prudence. On both these accounts, the aim of the\ncontract is to show that commitment to morality is an effective way to\nfurther one’s non-moral aims and interests. Here the justificatory\nproblem is satisfactorily answering the question “why be\nmoral?” This “contractarian” project is reductionist\nin a pretty straightforward sense: it derives moral reasons from\nnon-moral ones. Or, to use Rawls’s terminology, it attempts to\ngenerate the reasonable out of the rational (1996, 53).  \nThis approach is appealing for several reasons. First, insofar as we\ndoubt that moral reasons are genuine or motivationally effective, such\na reductionist strategy promises to ground morality—or at least\na very basic version of it—on the prosaic requirements of\ninstrumentalist practical rationality (Moehler forthcoming). The\njustificatory question “why be moral?” is transformed into\nthe less troubling question “why be rational?” Second,\neven if we recognize that moral reasons are, in some sense, genuine,\ncontractarians like Kavka also want to show that prudent individuals,\nnot independently motivated by morality would have reason to\nreflectively endorse morality. Furthermore, if we have reason to\nsuspect that some segment of the population is, in fact, knavish then\nwe have good defensive reasons based on stability to build our social\ninstitutions and morality so as to restrain those who are only\nmotivated by prudence, even if we suspect that most persons are not so\nmotivated. Geoffrey Brennan and James Buchanan argue that a version of\nGresham’s law holds in political and social institutions that\n“bad behavior drives out good and that all persons will be led\nthemselves by even the presence of a few self-seekers to adopt\nself-interested behavior” (2008 [1985], 68). We need not think\npeople are mostly self-seeking to think that social institutions and\nmorality should be justified to and restrain those who are.  \nOn the other hand, “contractualists,” such as Rawls, John\nHarsanyi (1977), Thomas Scanlon (1998), Stephen Darwall (2006),\nNicholas Southwood (2010) and Gerald Gaus (2011) attribute ethical or\npolitical values to the deliberative parties, as well as a much more\nsubstantive, non-instrumentalist form of practical reasoning. The\nkinds of surrogates that model the justificatory problem of ‘you\nand me’ are already so situated that their deliberations will be\nframed by ethico-political considerations. The agents’ deliberations\nare not, as with the Hobbesian theorists, carried out in purely\nprudential or instrumentalist terms, but they are subject to the\n‘veil of ignorance’ or other substantive conditions. Here\nthe core justificatory problem is not whether the very idea of moral\nand political constraints makes sense, but what sorts of moral or\npolitical principles meet certain basic moral demands, such as\ntreating all as free and equal moral persons, or not subjecting any\nperson to the will or judgment of another (Reiman 1990, chap. 1). This\napproach, then, is non-reductionist in the sense that not all of\nmorality is derived from the non-moral.  \nA benefit of the non-reductive approach is that the choosers in the\ncontractual procedure (I) share many of the normative\nconcerns of their actual counterparts (I*). This should\nensure a closer normative link between the two parties and allow for\nthe contract to generate a thicker, more substantive morality,\npresumably closer to that already held by I*. Whether this is\nso, however, depends on how closely the non-reductionist model of\nrationality is to the reasoning of actual individuals.  \nAt this point, the debate seems to be centered on two positions, which\nwe might call the robustness and sensitivity\npositions. According to the proponents of robustness, whatever else\nmoral agents may disagree about, we can safely assume that they would\nall be committed to basic standards of rationality (Moehler 2017,\n2013). We should thus suppose this same basic, shared conception of\nrationality and agency: when people fall short of more moralistic\nideals and virtue, the contract will still function. It will be\nrobust. According to this view, we are better off following Hume\n(1741) in assuming every person to be an instrumental knave, even\nthough that maxim is false in fact. The sensitivity position rejects\nthis, holding that, if in fact individuals in I* are not\nresolutely self-interested, the problems of I, resolutely\nself-interested individuals, and their contractual solutions, will be\ninappropriate to I*. Perhaps whereas I* can count on\nsocial trust, the self-interested contractors will find it elusive and\narrive at second-best alternatives that trusting folks would find\nsilly and inefficient. Indeed, the sensitivity theorist may insist\nthat even if the self-interested agents can talk themselves into\nacting as moral agents they do they do so for the wrong sort of\nreasons (Gaus 2011, 185ff). \nThe core idea of social contract theories, we have been stressing, is\nthat the deliberation of the parties is supposed to model the\njustificatory problem of “you and me.” Now this pulls\nsocial contract theories in two opposing directions. On the one hand,\nif the deliberations of the hypothetical parties are to model\nour problem and their conclusions are to be of relevance to\nus, the parties must be similar to us. The closer the parties are to\n“you and me” the better their deliberations will model you\nand me, and be of relevance to us. On the other hand, the point of\ncontract theories is to make headway on our justificatory problem by\nconstructing parties that are idealizations of you and me, suggesting\nthat some idealization is necessary and salutary. To recognize that\nsome forms of idealization are problematic does not imply that we\nshould embrace what Gaus has called “justificatory\npopulism” that every person in a society must actually assent to\nthe social and moral institutions in question (Gaus 1996, 130–131).\nSuch a standard would take us back to the older social contract\ntradition based on direct consent. But, as we argue in §3, modern\ncontract theories are concerned with appeals to our reason, not our\nself-binding power of consent.  \nDespite possible problems, there are two important motivations behind\nidealization of the deliberative parties. First, you and I,\nas we now are, may be confused about what considerations are relevant\nto our justificatory problem. We have biases and false beliefs; to\nmake progress on solving our problem of justification we wish, as far\nas possible, to see what the result would be if we only reasoned\ncorrectly from sound and relevant premises. So in constructing the\nhypothetical parties we wish to idealize them in this way. Ideal\ndeliberation theorists like Jürgen Habermas (1985) and Southwood\n(2010), in their different ways, are deeply concerned with this reason\nfor idealization. On the face of it, such idealization does not seem\nespecially troublesome, since our ultimate concern is with what is\njustified, and so we want the deliberations of the parties to track\ngood reasons. But if we idealize too far from individuals and citizens\nas they presently are (e.g., suppose we posit that they are fully\nrational in the sense that they know all the implications of all their\nbeliefs and have perfect information) their deliberations may not help\nmuch in solving our justificatory problems. We will not be able to\nidentify with their solutions. For example, suppose that\nhyper-rational and perfectly informed parties would have no religious\nbeliefs, so they would not be concerned with freedom of religion or\nthe role of religion of political decision making. But our problem is\nthat among tolerably reasonable but far from perfectly rational\ncitizens, pluralism of religious belief is inescapable. Consequently,\nto gain insight into the justificatory problem among citizens of\nlimited rationality, the parties must model our imperfect rationality.\n \nSecondly, social contract theories are pulled towards some\nrepresentations of the parties in order to render the choice situation\ndeterminate. This goal of determinacy, however, can have the effect of\neliminating the pluralism of the parties that was the original impetus\nfor contracting in the first place. In his Lectures on the History\nof Political Philosophy Rawls tells us that “a\nnormalization of interests attributed to the parties” is\n“common to social contract doctrines” and it is necessary\nto unify the perspectives of the different parties so as to construct\na “shared point of view” (2007, 226). Here Rawls seems to\nbe suggesting that to achieve determinacy in the contract procedure it\nis necessary to “normalize” the perspectives of the\nparties.  \nThe problem is this. Suppose that the parties to the contract closely\nmodel you and me, and so they have diverse bases for their\ndeliberations—religious, secular, perfectionist, and so on. In\nthis case, it is hard to see how the contract theorist can get a\ndeterminate result. Just as you and I disagree, so will the parties.\nRawls (1999, 121) acknowledges that his restrictions on particular\ninformation in the original position are necessary to achieve a\ndeterminate result. If we exclude “knowledge of those\ncontingencies which set men at odds …. ” then since\n“everyone is equally rational and similarly situated, each is\nconvinced by the same arguments”(Rawls 1999, 17, 120). Gaus\n(2011a, 36–47) has argued that a determinative result can only be\ngenerated by an implausibly high degree of abstraction, in which the\nbasic pluralism of evaluative standards—the core of our\njustificatory problem—is abstracted away. Thus, on Gaus’s view,\nmodelings of the parties that make them anything approaching\nrepresentations of you and me will only be able to generate a\nnon-singleton set of eligible social contracts. The parties might\nagree that some social contracts are better than none, but they will\ndisagree on their ordering of possible social contracts. This\nconclusion, refined and developed in (Gaus 2011a, Part Two) connects\nthe traditional problem of indeterminacy in the contract procedure\n(see also Hardin 2003) with the contemporary, technical problem of\nequilibrium selection in games (see Vanderschraaf 2005, Thrasher\n2014a). A topic we will explore more in §3 below.  \nIt is possible, however, that determinacy may actually require\ndiversity in the perspective of the deliberative parties in a way that\nRawls and others like Harsanyi didn’t expect. The reason for this is\nsimple, though the proof is somewhat complex. Normalizing the\nperspectives of the parties assumes that there is one stable point of\nview that has all of the relevant information necessary for generating\na stable and determinate set of social rules. There is no reason,\nantecedently, to think that such a perspective can be found, however.\nInstead, if we recognize that there are epistemic gains to be had from\na “division of cognitive labor” there is good reason to\nprefer a diverse rather than normalized idealization of the parties to\nthe contract (see: Weisberg and Muldoon 2009, Gaus 2016, Muldoon 2017,\nMuldoon forthcoming). There is reason to conclude that if we wish to\ndiscover social contracts that best achieve a set of interrelated\nnormative desiderata (e.g., liberty, equality, welfare, etc.), a\ndeliberative process that draws on a diversity of perspectives will\noutperform one based on a strict normalization of perspectives (Gaus\n2011b, 2016).  \nAny representation of the reasoning of the parties will have two\nelements that need to be specified: 1) doxastic and 2) evaluative.\nThese elements, when combined, create a complete model that will\nspecify how and why representatives in the contractual model choose or\nagree to some set of social rules. The first (doxastic) is the\nspecification of everything the representatives in the original\nposition know or at least believe. Choice in the contractual model in\nthe broadest sense, is an attempt by the parties to choose a set of\nrules that they expect will be better than in some baseline condition,\nsuch as “generalized egoism” (Rawls, 1999: 127) a\n“state of nature” (Hobbes 1651) or the rules that they\ncurrently have (Binmore, 2005; Buchanan 2000 [1975]). To do this, they\nneed representations of the baseline and of state of the world under\ncandidate set of rules). Without either of these doxastic\nrepresentations, the choice problem would be indeterminate. Rawls\nfamously imposes severe doxastic constraints on his parties to the\nsocial contract by imposing a thick veil of ignorance that eliminates\ninformation about the specific details of each individual and the\nworld they live in. James Buchanan imposes a similar, but less\nrestrictive “veil of uncertainty” on his representative\nchoosers (Buchanan and Tullock 1965 [1962]; Buchanan 1975; see also\nRawls, 1958).  \nIn addition to specifying what the representatives believe to be the\ncase about the world and the results of their agreement, there must\nalso be some standard by which the representative parties can evaluate\ndifferent contractual possibilities. They must be able to rank the\noptions on the basis of their values, whatever those may be. Rawls\nmodels parties to the contractual situation as, at least initially,\nhaving only one metric of value: primary goods. They choose the\nconception of justice they do insofar as they believe it will likely\ngenerate the most primary goods for them and their descendants. This\nspecification of the evaluative parameter is uniform across choosers\nand therefore, choice in the original position can be modeled as the\nchoice of one individual. Insofar as there is evaluative diversity\nbetween the representatives, more complex models of agreement will be\nneeded (see §3).  \nIf we think in terms of decision theory, the doxastic specification\nindividuates the initial state of affairs and the outcomes of the\ncontractual model, while the specification of the evaluative elements\ngives each representative party a ranking of the outcomes expected to\nresult from the choice of any given set of rules. Once these elements\nare specified, we have a model of the parties to the contract. We\nstill need to model how they actually come to an agreement to\nunderstand the ultimate reasons we have for finding the contractual\nmodel to be normatively compelling.  \nSocial contract theories fundamentally differ in whether the parties\nreason differently or the same. As we have seen (§2.3) in Rawls’s\ncontract everyone reasons the same: the collective choice problem is\nreduced to the choice of one individual. Any one person’s decision is\na proxy for everyone else. In social contracts of this sort, the\ndescription of the parties (their motivation, the conditions under\nwhich they choose) does all the work: once we have fully specified the\nreasoning of one party, the contract has been identified.  \nThe alternative view is that, even after we have specified the parties\n(including their rationality, values and information), they continue\nto disagree in their rankings of possible social contracts. On this\nview, the contract only has a determinate result if there is some way\nto commensurate the different rankings of each individual to yield an\nagreement (D’Agostino 2003). We can distinguish four basic agreement\nmechanisms.  \nThe traditional social contract views of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau\ncrucially relied on the idea of consent. For Locke only “consent\nof Free-men” could make them members of government (Locke 1689,\n§117). In the hands of these theorists—and in much ordinary\ndiscourse—the idea of “consent” implies a normative\npower to bind oneself. When one reaches “the age of\nconsent” one is empowered to make certain sorts of binding\nagreements—contracts. By putting consent at the center of their\ncontracts these early modern contract theorists (1) were clearly\nsupposing that individuals had basic normative powers over themselves\n(e.g. self-ownership) before they entered into the social contract (a\npoint that Hume (1748) stressed), and (2) brought the question of\npolitical obligation to the fore. If the parties have the power to\nbind themselves by exercising this normative power, then the upshot of\nthe social contract was obligation. As Hobbes (1651, 81 [chap\nxiv,¶7) insisted, covenants bind; that is why they are\n“artificial chains” (1651, 138 [chap. xxi, ¶5).  \nBoth of these considerations have come under attack in contemporary\nsocial contract theories, especially the second. According to\nBuchanan, the key development of recent social contract theory has\nbeen to distinguish the question of what generates political\nobligation (the key concern of the consent tradition in\nsocial contract thought) from the question of what constitutional\norders or social institutions are mutually beneficial and stable over\ntime (1965). The nature of a person’s duty to abide by the\nlaw or social rules is a matter of a morality as it pertains to\nindividuals (Rawls 1999, 293ff), while the design and justification of\npolitical and social institutions is a question of public or social\nmorality. Thus, on Buchanan’s view, a crucial feature of more recent\ncontractual thought has been to refocus political philosophy on public\nor social morality rather than individual obligation.  \nAlthough contemporary social contract theorists still sometimes employ\nthe language of consent, the core idea of contemporary social contract\ntheory is agreement. “Social contract views work from\nthe intuitive idea of agreement” (Freeman 2007a, 17). Now one\ncan endorse or agree to a principle without that act of endorsement in\nany way binding one to obey. Social contract theorists as diverse as\nSamuel Freeman and Jan Narveson (1988, 148) see the act of agreement\nas indicating what reasons we have. Agreement is a “test”\nor a heuristic (see §5). The “role of unanimous collective\nagreement” is in showing “what we have reasons to do in\nour social and political relations” (Freeman 2007, 19). Thus\nunderstood the agreement is not itself a binding act—it is not a\nperformative that somehow creates obligation—but is\nreason-revealing (Lessnoff 1986). If individuals are rational, what\nthey agree to reflects the reasons they have. In contemporary contract\ntheories such as Rawls’s, the problem of justification takes center\nstage. Rawls’s revival of social contract theory in A Theory of\nJustice thus did not base obligations on consent, though the\napparatus of an “original agreement” persisted. Recall\nthat for Rawls (1999, 16) the aim is to settle “the question of\njustification … by working out a problem of\ndeliberation.”  \nGiven that the problem of justification has taken center stage, the\nsecond aspect of contemporary social contract thinking appears to fall\ninto place: its reliance on models of hypothetical agreement. The aim\nis to model the reasons of citizens, and so we ask what they would\nagree to under conditions in which their agreements would be expected\nto track their reasons. Contemporary contract theory is,\ncharacteristically, doubly hypothetical. Certainly, no\nprominent theorist thinks that questions of justification are settled\nby an actual survey of attitudes towards existing social arrangements,\nand are not settled until such a survey has been carried out. The\nquestion, then, is not “Are these arrangements\npresently the object of an actual agreement among citizens?” (If\nthis were the question, the answer would typically be\n“No”.) The question, rather, is “Would\nthese arrangements be the object of an agreement if citizens were\nsurveyed?” Although both of the questions are, in some sense,\nsusceptible to an empirical reading, only the latter is in play in\npresent-day theorizing. The contract nowadays is always hypothetical\nin at least this first sense.  \nThere is a reading of the (first-order) hypothetical question\n“Would the arrangements be the object of agreement if___”\nwhich, as indicated, is still resolutely empirical in some sense. This\nis the reading where what is required of the theorist is that she try\nto determine what an actual survey of actual citizens would reveal\nabout their actual attitudes towards their system of social\narrangements. (This is seldom done, of course; the theorist does it in\nher imagination. See, though, Klosko 2000). But there is another\ninterpretation that is more widely accepted in the contemporary\ncontext. On this reading, the question is no longer a hypothetical\nquestion about actual reactions; it is, rather, a\nhypothetical question about hypothetical reactions—it\nis, as we have said, doubly hypothetical. Framing\nthe question is the first hypothetical element: “Would it be the\nobject of agreement if they were surveyed?” Framed by\nthis question is the second hypothetical element, one which involves\nthe citizens, who are no longer treated empirically, i.e. taken as\ngiven, but are, instead, themselves considered from a hypothetical\npoint of view—as they would be if (typically) they were better\ninformed or more impartial, etc. The question for most contemporary\ncontract theorists, then, is, roughly: “If we surveyed the\nidealized surrogates of the actual citizens in this polity, what\nsocial arrangements would be the object of an agreement among\nthem?”  \nFamously, Ronald Dworkin has objected that a (doubly) hypothetical\nagreement cannot bind any actual person. For the hypothetical analysis\nto make sense, it must be shown that hypothetical persons in the\ncontract can agree to be bound by some principle regulating social\narrangements. Suppose that it could be shown that your surrogate (a\nbetter informed, more impartial version of you) would agree to a\nprinciple. What has that to do with you? Where this second-stage\nhypothetical analysis is employed, it seems to be proposed that\nyou can be bound by agreements that others,\ndifferent from you, would have made. While it might (though it\nneedn’t) be reasonable to suppose that you can be bound by\nagreements that you would yourself have entered into if given the\nopportunity, it seems crazy to think that you can be bound by\nagreements that, demonstrably, you wouldn’t have made even if\nyou had been asked. This criticism is decisive, however, only if the\nhypothetical social contract is supposed to invoke your normative\npower to self-bind via consent. That your surrogate employs her power\nto self-bind would not mean that you had employed your power. Again,\nthough, the power to obligate oneself is not typically invoked in the\ncontemporary social contract: the problem of deliberation is supposed\nto help us make headway on the problem of justification. So the\nquestion for contemporary hypothetical contract theories is whether\nthe hypothetical agreement of your surrogate tracks your reasons to\naccept social arrangements, a very different issue.  \nIt is almost a commonplace today that contemporary social contract\ntheory relies on hypothetical, not actual, agreement. As we have seen,\nin one sense this is certainly the case. However, in many ways the\n“hypothetical/actual” divide is artificial: the\nhypothetical agreement is meant to model, and provide the basis for,\nactual agreement. Understanding contemporary social contract theory is\nbest achieved, not through insisting on the distinction between actual\nand hypothetical contracts, but by grasping the interplay of the\nhypothetical and the actual.  \nThe key here is Rawls’s (1996, 28) distinction among the perspectives\nof: \nThe agreement of the parties in the deliberative model is certainly\nhypothetical in the two-fold sense we have analyzed: a hypothetical\nagreement among hypothetical parties. But the point of the\ndeliberative model is to help us (i.e., “you and me”)\nsolve our justificatory problem—what social\narrangements we can all accept as “free persons who have no\nauthority over one another” (Rawls 1958, 33). The parties’\ndeliberations and the conditions under which they deliberate, then,\nmodel our actual convictions about justice and justification. As Rawls\nsays (1999, 514), the reasoning of the hypothetical parties matters to\nus because “the conditions embodied in the description of this\nsituation are ones that we do in fact accept.” Unless the\nhypothetical models the actual, the upshot of the hypothetical could\nnot provide us with reasons. Gaus describes something like\nthis process as a “testing conception” of the social\ncontract (2011a, 425). We use the hypothetical deliberative device of\nthe contract to “test” our social institutions. In this\nway, the contemporary social contract is meant to be a model of the\njustificatory situation that all individuals face. The hypothetical\nand abstracted (see §2) nature of the contract is needed to\nhighlight the relevant features of the parties to show what reasons\nthey have.  \nSamuel Freeman has recently stressed the way in which focusing on the\nthird perspective—of citizens in a well-ordered\nsociety—shows the importance of actual agreement in Rawls’s\ncontract theory. On Freeman’s interpretation, the social contract must\nmeet the condition of publicity. He (2007b:15) writes: \nA justified contract must meet the full publicity condition: its\ncomplete justification must be capable of being actually accepted by\nmembers of a well-ordered society. The hypothetical agreement itself\nprovides only what Rawls (1996, 386) calls a “pro\ntanto” or “so far as it goes” justification of\nthe principles of justice. “Full justification” is\nachieved only when actual “people endorse and will liberal\njustice for the particular (and often conflicting) reasons implicit in\nthe reasonable comprehensive doctrines they hold” (Freeman\n2007b, 19). Thus understood, Rawls’s concern with the stability of\njustice as fairness, which motivated the move to political liberalism,\nis itself a question of justification (Weithman, 2010). Only if the\nprinciples of justice are stable in this way are they fully justified.\nRawls’s concern with stability and publicity is not, however,\nidiosyncratic and is shared by all contemporary contract theorists. It\nis significant that even theorists such as Buchanan (2000 [1975],\n26–27), Gauthier (1986, 348), and Binmore (2005, 5–7)—who are so\ndifferent from Rawls in other respects—share his concern with\nstability.  \nIt is perhaps no surprise that the renaissance in contemporary contact\ntheory occurred at the same time as game-theoretic tools and\nespecially bargaining theory began to be applied to philosophical\nproblems. Bargaining theory, as it was developed by John Nash (1950)\nand John Harsanyi (1977) is a rigorous approach to modeling how\nrational individuals would agree to divide some good or surplus. In\nits most general form, the bargaining model of agreement specifies\nsome set of individuals who have individual utility functions that can\nbe represented in relation to one other without requiring\ninterpersonal comparisons of utility directly. Some good or goods for\ndivision is specified and if the individuals involved can agree on how\nto divide the good in question, they will get that division. If,\nhowever, they cannot agree they will instead get their disagreement\nresult. This may be what they brought to the table or it could be some\nother specified amount. One example is a simple demand game where two\npeople must write down how much of given pot of money they want. If\nthe two “bids” amount to equal or less than the pot, each\nwill get what he or she wrote down, otherwise each will get nothing.\n \nAs Rawls recognized in his 1958 essay “Justice as\nFairness” one way for parties to resolve their disagreements is\nto employ bargaining solutions, such as that proposed by R.B.\nBraithwaite (1955). Rawls himself rejected bargaining solutions to the\nsocial contract since, in his opinion, such solutions rely on threat\nadvantage and “to each according to his threat advantage is\nhardly a principle of fairness” (Rawls 1958, 58n). Gauthier,\nhowever, famously pursued this approach, building his Morals by\nAgreement on the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (see also Gaus\n1990, Ch. IX). Binmore (2005) has recently advanced a version of\nsocial contract theory that relies on the Nash bargaining solution, as\ndoes Ryan Muldoon (2017) while Moehler (forthcoming) relies on a\n“stabilized” Nash bargaining solution. Gauthier has since\nadopted a less formal approach to bargaining that is, nevertheless,\nstill closer to his original solution than to the Nash Solution\n(2013). In addition to Rawls’s concern about threat advantage, a\ndrawback of all such approaches is the multiplicity of bargaining\nsolutions, which can significantly differ. Although the Nash solution\nis most favored today, it can have counter-intuitive implications.\nFurthermore, there are many who argue that bargaining solutions are\ninherently indeterminate and so the only way to achieve determinacy is\nto introduce unrealistic or controversial assumptions (Sugden, 1990,\n1991). Similar problems also exist for equilibrium selection in games\n(see Vanderschraaf 2005 and Harsanyi and Selten 1988).  \nMany of the recent developments in bargaining theory and the social\ncontract have adopted dynamic (Muldoon 2017, Vanderschraaf\nforthcoming) or even evolutionary approaches to modeling bargaining\n(Alexander and Skyrms 1999, Skyrms 2014). This highlights a general\ndivide in bargaining models between what we can call axiomatic and\nprocess models. The traditional, axiomatic, approach to the bargaining\nproblem going back to John Nash, codified by John Harsanyi, and\npopularized by R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957). Out of this\ntradition has come several core bargaining solutions. Each uses a\nslightly different set of axioms to generate a unique and generally\napplicable way to divide a surplus. These include, most notably, the\negalitarian (Raiffa 1953), the Nash (1950), the stabilized Nash\n(Moehler 2010), the Kalai-Smorodinsky (1975), and Gauthier’s\nminimax relative concession (1986). The main point of contention among\nthese theories is whether to employ Nash’s independence axiom or\nto use a monotonicity axiom (as the egalitarian, Kalai-Smorodinsky,\nand minimax relative concession do), although, to one degree or\nanother all of the axioms have been contested.  \nFor instance, one key axiom that all bargaining theories employ is a\nsymmetry axiom. This axiom states that bargainers in the situation\nwill reason the same, that is, I will not be willing to give or take\nmore than you in the same situation. This axiom seems reasonable, but\nit does not follow that the denial of symmetry is somehow a denial of\nreason. Indeed, Thomas Schelling (1959) was an early critic of the\nsymmetry assumption in bargaining theory and more recently, John\nThrasher (2014) has argued that the symmetry assumption is\ninconsistent with the traditional model of the social contract.\nSymmetry is necessary to generate a unique solution to the bargaining\nproblem, however. A rejection of symmetry will likely entail a\nrejection of uniqueness, at least in axiomatic bargaining theory.  \nThe other approach to bargaining models of agreement is what we can\ncall a process model. Instead of using various axioms to generate a\nuniquely rational solution, these theorists rely on some procedure\nthat will generate a determinate, though not always unique result.\nProcess approaches use some mechanism to generate agreement. An\nexample is an auction. There are many types of auctions (e.g.,\nEnglish, Dutch, Vickrey, etc.), each has a way of generating bids on\nsome good and then deciding on a price. Posted price selling, like one\noften sees in consumer markets, are also a kind of bargain, though an\nextremely asymmetric one where the the seller has offered a\n“take or leave it” ask. Double-auctions are more\nsymmetrical and have a clearer link to the initial bargaining model.\nAlthough auctions are not typically used to solve pure division\nproblems, there are some examples of auction mechanisms being used to\nsolve public goods problems in interesting ways that guarantee\nunanimity (Smith 1977). Dworkin also uses a kind of auction mechanism\nin his work on equality, though he doesn’t develop his approach\nfor more general application (Dworkin 1981, Heath 2004) Despite its\npromise, however, auction theory and its potential application to\nsocial contract theory has largely gone unexploited.  \nThe main process approach to bargaining derives from the influential\nwork of Rubinstein (1982) and his proof that it is possible to show\nthat an alternating offer bargaining process will generate the same\nresult as Nash’s axiomatic solution in certain cases. This\nresult added life to Nash’s (1950) early observation that\nbargaining and the rules of bargaining must be the result of some\nnon-cooperative game with the idea being that it might be possible to\nunify bargaining theory and game theory. This approach, called the\nNash Program, is championed most notably by Binmore (1998), whose\nevolutionary approach to the social contract relies on biological\nevolution (the game of life) to generate the background conditions of\nbargaining (the game of morals). Both can be modeled as\nnon-cooperative games and the later can be modeled as a bargaining\nproblem. By using this approach, Binmore (1998, 2005) claims to be\nable to show, in a robust and non-question-begging way, that something\nvery much like Rawls’s “justice as fairness” will be\nthe result of this evolutionary bargaining process.  \nA more empirically minded approach follows Schelling’s (1960)\nearly work on bargaining and game theory by looking at the way actual\npeople bargain and reach agreement. The pioneers of experimental\neconomics used laboratory experiments to look at how subjects behaved\nin division problems (Hoffman et. al. 2000, Smith 2003). Some of the\nmost interesting results came, perhaps surprisingly, from asymmetric\nbargaining games like the ultimatum game (Smith 1982). Since these\nearly experiments, considerable experimental work has been done on\nbargaining problems and cooperative agreement in economics. Much of\nthe most philosophically relevant work involves the importance of\nsocial norms and conventions in determining the result (Bicchieri\n2016, Vanderschraaf forthcoming).  \nAlthough appealing to a bargaining solution can give determinacy to a\nsocial contract, it does so at the cost of appealing to a\ncontroversial commensuration mechanism in the case of axiomatic\nbargaining or of moving to process approaches that must ultimately\nrely on the empirically contingent outcome of social and biological\nevolution. Although the importance of bargaining in the social\ncontract has been moribund for some time, recent work is changing that\n(see Alexander 2007, Thrasher 2014a, Thoma 2015, Muldoon 2017, Moehler\nforthcoming, Vanderschraaf forthcoming).  \nWe might distinguish bargaining from aggregation solutions. Rather\nthan seeking an outcome that (as, roughly, the Kalai-Smorodinsky\nsolution does) splits the difference between various claims, we might\nseek to aggregate the individual rankings into an overall social\nchoice. Arrow’s theorem and related problems with social choice rules\ncasts doubt on any claim that one specific way of aggregating is\nuniquely rational: all have their shortcomings (Gaus 2008, chap. 5).\nHarsanyi (1977, chaps. 1 and 2; 1982) develops a contractual theory\nmuch like Rawls’s. Reasoning behind a veil of ignorance in which\npeople do not know their post-contract identities, he supposes that\nrational contractors will assume it is equally probable that they will\nbe any specific person. Moreover, he argues that contractors can agree\non interpersonal utility comparisons, and so they will opt for a\ncontract that aggregates utility at the highest average (see also\nMueller 2003, chap. 26). This, of course, depends on the supposition\nthat there is a non-controversial metric that allows us to aggregate\nthe parties’ utility functions. Binmore (2005) follows Harsanyi and\nAmartya Sen (2009, Chap. 13) in arguing that interpersonal comparisons\ncan be made for the purposes of aggregation, at least some of the\ntime. One of the problems with this approach, however, is that if the\ninterpersonal comparisons are incomplete they will not be able to\nproduce a complete social ordering. As Sen points out, this will lead\nto a maximal set of alternatives where no alternative is dominated by\nany other within the set but also where no particular alternative is\noptimal (Sen, 1997). Instead of solving the aggregation problem, then,\ninterpersonal comparisons may only be able to reduce the set of\nalternatives without being able to complete the ordering of\nalternatives.  \nThere is a long tradition of thinking of the social contract as a kind\nof equilibrium. Within this tradition, however, the tendency is to see\nthe social contract as some kind of equilibrium solution to a\nprisoner’s dilemma type situation (see Gauthier, 1986 and Buchanan,\n2000 [1975]). Brian Skyrms (1996, 2004) suggests a different approach.\nSuppose that we have a contractual negotiation in which there are two\nparties, ordering four possible “social contracts”: \nLet 3 be the best outcome, and let 1 be the worst in each person’s\nranking (Alf’s ranking is first in each pair). We thus get Figure\n1 Figure 1: A Stag Hunt \nThe Stag Hunt, Skyrms argues, “should be a focal point for\nsocial contract theory” (2004, 4). The issue in the Stag Hunt is\nnot whether we fight or not, but whether we cooperate and gain, or\neach go our separate ways. There are two Nash equilibria in this game:\nboth hunting stag and both hunting hare. Alf and Betty, should they\nfind themselves at one of these equilibria, will stick to it if each\nconsults only his or her own ranking of options. In a Nash\nequilibrium, no individual has a reason to defect. Of course the\ncontract in which they both hunt stag is a better contract: it is\nPareto superior to that in which they both hunt hare. The Hare\nequilibrium is, however, risk superior in that it is a safer bet.\nSkyrms argues that the theory of iterated games can show not simply\nthat our parties will arrive at a social contract, but how they can\ncome to arrive at the cooperative, mutually beneficial contract. If we\nhave a chance to play repeated games, Skyrms holds, we can learn from\nHume about the “shadow of the future”: “I learn to\ndo a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness;\nbecause I foresee, that he will return my service, in expectation of\nanother of the same kind, and in order to maintain the same\ncorrespondence of good offices with me and with others” (Skyrms\n2004, 5). Sugden, along different lines, also suggests that repeated\ninteractions, what he calls “experience” is essential to\nthe determination of which norms of social interaction actually hold\nover time (1986).  \nThe problem with equilibrium solutions is that, as in the stag hunt\ngame, many games have multiple equilibria. The problem then becomes\nhow to select one unique equilibrium from a set of possible ones. The\nproblem is compounded by the controversies over equilibrium refinement\nconcepts (see Harsanyi and Selten 1988). Many refinements have been\nsuggested but, as in bargaining theory, all are controversial to one\ndegree or another. One of the interesting developments in social\ncontract theory spurred by game theorists such as Skyrms and Binmore\nis the appeal to evolutionary game theory as a way to solve the\ncommensuration and equilibrium selection problem (Vanderschraaf 2005).\nWhat cannot be solved by appeal to reason (because there simply is no\ndeterminate solution) may be solved by repeated interactions among\nrational parties. The work of theorists such as Skyrms and Binmore\nalso blurs the line between justification and explanation. Their\nanalyses shed light both on the justificatory problem—what are\nthe characteristics of a cooperative social order that people freely\nfollow?—while also explaining how such orders may come\nabout. \nThe use of evolutionary game theory and evolutionary techniques is a\nburgeoning and exciting area of contract theory. One of the many\nquestions that arise, however, is that of why, and if so under what\ncircumstances, we should endorse the output of evolutionary\nprocedures. Should one equilibrium be preferred to another merely\nbecause it was the output of an evolutionary procedure? Surely we\nwould want reasons independent of history for reflectively endorsing\nsome equilibrium. This problem highlights the concern that social\ncontracts that are the product of evolutionary procedures will not\nmeet the publicity condition in the right kind of way. If the\npublicity condition seems harder to meet, the evolutionary approach\nprovides a powerful and dynamic way to understand stability. Following\nMaynard Smith, we can see stability as being an evolutionarily stable\nstrategy equilibrium or an ESS (1982).  Basically this is the idea\nthat an equilibrium in an evolutionary game where successful\nstrategies replicate at higher rates is stable if the equilibrium\ncomposition of the population in terms of strategies is not\nsusceptible to invasion by a mutant strategy. An ESS is an application\nof the Nash equilibrium concept to populations. A population is\nevolutionarily stable when a mutant strategy is not a better response\nto the population than the current mix of strategies in the\npopulation. This gives a formal interpretation of Rawls’s conception\nof “inherent stability” and to Buchanan’s notion that\nsocial contracts should be able to withstand subversion by a\nsub-population of knaves. This new conception of stability combined\nwith the dynamic nature of evolutionary games provides interesting new\nways for the social contract theorist to model the output of the\ncontract. \nSocial contract theories differ about the object of the contract. In\nthe traditional contract theories of Hobbes and Locke, the contract\nwas about the terms of political association. In particular, the\nproblem was the grounds and limits of citizen’s obligation to obey the\nstate. In his early formulation, Rawls’s parties deliberated about\n“common practices” (1958). In his later statement of his\nview, Rawls took the object of agreement to be principles of justice\nto regulate “the basic structure:” \nFor Rawls, as for most contemporary contract theorists, the object of\nagreement is not, at least directly, the grounds of political\nobligation, but the principles of justice that regulate the basic\ninstitutions of society. Freeman (2007a: 23), perhaps the preeminent\nstudent of Rawls, focuses on “the social role of norms in public\nlife.” Buchanan is concerned with justifying constitutional\norders of social and political institutions (2000 [1975]). Gauthier\n(1986), Scanlon (1998), Darwall (2006), Southwood (2010), and Gaus\n(2011a) employ the contract device to justify social moral claims. \nThe level at which the object of the contract is described is apt to\naffect the outcome of the agreement. “A striking feature of\nHobbes’ view,” Russell Hardin points out, “is that it is a\nrelative assessment of whole states of affairs. Life under one form of\ngovernment versus life under anarchy” (2003, 43). Hobbes could\nplausibly argue that everyone would agree to the social contract\nbecause “life under government” is, from the perspective\nof everyone, better than “life under anarchy” (the\nbaseline condition). However, if a Hobbesian sought to divide the\ncontract up into, say, more fine-grained agreements about the various\nfunctions of government, she is apt to find that agreement would not\nbe forthcoming on many functions. As we “zoom in” (Lister,\n2010) on more fine-grained functions of government, the contract is\napt to become more limited. If the parties are simply considering\nwhether government is better than anarchy, they will opt for just\nabout any government (including, say, one that funds the arts); if\nthey are considering whether to have a government that funds the arts\nor one that doesn’t, it is easy to see how they may not agree on the\nformer. In a similar way, if the parties are deliberating about entire\nmoral codes, there may be wide agreement that all the moral codes,\noverall, are in everyone’s interests; if we “zoom in” in\nspecific rights and duties, we are apt to get a very different answer.\n \nIn multi-level contract theories such as Buchanan’s (2000 [1975]\nand Michael Moehler’s (forthcoming), each stage has its own\nunique object. In Buchanan’s theory, the object of the\nconstitutional stage is a system of constraints that will allow\nindividuals to peacefully co-exist, what Buchanan calls the\n“protective state” (2000 [1975]). On his view, the state\nof nature is characterized by both predation and defense. One’s\nability to engage in productive enterprises is decreased because of\nthe need to defend the fruits of those enterprises against those who\nwould rely on predation rather than production. We all have reason to\ncontract, according to Buchanan, in order to increase the overall\nability of everyone to produce by limiting the need for defense by\nconstraining the ability to engage in predation. Once the solution to\nthe predation-production conflict has been solved by the\nconstitutional contract, members of society also realize that if all\ncontributed to the production of various public goods, the productive\npossibility of society would be similarly increased. This second,\npost-constitutional stage, involves what Buchanan calls the\n“productive state.” Each stage is logically distinct\nthough there are causal relationships between changes made at one\nstage and the efficacy and stability of the solution at the later\nstage. The distinction between the two stages is analogous to the\ntraditional distinction between commutative and distributive justice.\nAlthough these two are often bound up together in contemporary\ncontract theory, one of Buchanan’s novel contributions is to suggest\nthat there are theoretical gains to separating these distinct objects\nof agreement.  \nMoehler’s (2017) “multi-level” contract has several\naspects. First, drawing on their pluralistic moral commitments\nindividuals seek to agree on social-moral rules that all can endorse\nas a common morality. This object of this agreement is similar to that\nof Darwall’s, Gaus’s and Southwood’s models. The\nsecond-level agreement is appropriate to circumstances in which\npluralism is so deep and wide no common morality can be forged. Rather\nthan moral agents, the parties are reconceived as instrumentally\nrational prudential agents: the object of this second level is rules\nof cooperation that advance the interests of all when a deeper moral\nbasis cannot be uncovered.  \nSuppose, then, that we have arrived at some social contract. Depending\non the initial justificatory problem, it will yield an outcome\nR (principles, rules, etc. that have some normative property\nN—such as justice, morality, authority, obligation,\nlegitimacy, mutual benefit, and so on. But, supposing that the\ncontract has generated a principle, rule, etc. with the relevant\nnormative property, precisely what is shown by the fact that this\nprinciple or rule was generated through the contractual device?  \nThroughout we have been distinguishing the justificatory problem from\nthe deliberative model. Now the strongest that could be claimed for a\ncontractual argument is that the outcome of the deliberative model is\nconstitutive of both the correct solution of the\njustificatory problem and the conclusion that “R has\nN.” On this “constructivist” reading of the\noutcome of the deliberative model, there is no independent and\ndeterminate external justification that R has N,\nwhich the contractual device is intended to approximate, but, rather,\nthat R is the outcome of the deliberative model is the\ntruth-maker for “R has N”.  \nRawls, along with Gauthier and Buchanan, was sometimes attracted to\nsuch a reading. Rawls (1999, 104) describes the argument from the\noriginal position as invoking “pure procedural\njustice”—the deliberative situation is so set up that\nwhatever principles it generates are, by the fact of their\ngeneration, just. But, his considered position is that the outcome of\nthe deliberative model is indicative (not constitutive) of\nthe correct solution to “the question of justification”\n(1999, 16).  \nWe might say that the deliberative model is evidence of the\nproper answer to the question of justification. However, this is still\nconsistent with Rawls’s “constructivism” because the\nanswer to the justificatory problem is constitutive of\nR’s having N. So we might say that Rawls’s two\nprinciples are just—simply because they are in reflective\nequilibrium with the considered judgments of you and me and that they\nwould be chosen in the original position is indicative of this.  \nThe weakest interpretation of the contract is that the contractual\nresult is simply indicative of the correct answer to the\njustificatory problem, which itself is simply indicative of the fact\nthat R has N. One could be a “realist,”\nmaintaining that whether R has N is a fact that\nholds whether or not the contract device generates R has\nN, and independently of whether the correct answer to our\njustificatory problem (i.e., what we can justify to each other) is\nthat R has N. There is still logical space for a\ntype of contractualism here, but an indicative contractualism of this\nsort would not be a form of “constructivism.” Some, for\nexample, have argued that Scanlon’s theory is actually based on a sort\nof natural rights theory, where these rights are prior to the contract\n(Mack 2007). Even if this is correct, Scanlon can be a sort of social\ncontract theorist. The diversity of possible approaches within social\ncontract theory indicates the variety of different uses to which\nsocial contract theory can be applied.  \nThe social contract theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau all\nstressed that the justification of the state depends on showing that\neveryone would, in some way, consent to it. By relying on consent,\nsocial contract theory seemed to suppose a voluntarist conception of\npolitical justice and obligation: what counts as \"justice\" of\n\"obligation\" depends on what people agree to—whatever that might\nbe. Only in Kant (1797) does it become clear that consent is not\nfundamental to a social contract view: we have a duty to agree to act\naccording to the idea of the “original contract.” Rawls’s\nrevival of social contract theory in A Theory of Justice did\nnot base obligations on consent, though the apparatus of an\n“original agreement” persisted as a way to help solve the\nproblem of justification. As the question of public justification\ntakes center stage, it becomes clear that posing the problem of\njustification in terms of a deliberative or a bargaining problem is a\nheuristic: the real issue is “the problem of\njustification”—what principles can be justified to all\nreasonable citizens or persons.
