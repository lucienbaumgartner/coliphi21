More recently non-state actors such as the Aborigines of\nAustralia, the Maori of New Zealand, and the Native Americans of North\nAmerica are demanding the return of their tribal lands from Europeans\nas reparation; Eastern Europeans dispossessed by socialist governments\nare demanding the return of their property as reparation; and African\nAmericans are demanding reparation for the injuries of slavery and its\naftermath. The last of these demands is our subject.\n\nOddly Thomas Jefferson was probably the first to imply that America\nought to make reparation to its slaves. He did not say that\nit did, and his proposal to send them off to “such place as\ncircumstances of the time should render most proper”, and to\n“declare them a free and independent people”, was mainly\nmotivated by a desire to rid the country of them, but it also suggests\nthat they were a people and that the U.S. was under some obligation to\nset them up as a people (Jefferson 1954 [1785a]: 138). Some years\nafter Jefferson’s proposal American slaveholders founded (1816)\nthe American Colonization Society whose ostensible object, made\nplausible by the presence of some Quakers among its founders, was to\nhelp African Americans to go to Liberia and get a fresh start in a\ncountry free of racial discrimination. But the real object of the\nSociety, or at least that of the slaveholders who founded it, was to\nrid the country of free blacks who they feared endangered their\npeculiar institution. Their stratagem was therefore dealt a deadly\nblow when Martin Delany who agreed with Jefferson that African\nAmericans were a people and needed a territory on which to become a\nstate, declared that Liberia was\n \nnot an independent nation at all; but a poor miserable\nmockery—a burlesque on a government—a\npitiful dependency on the American Colonizationists\n and its “principal man, called President,\nin Liberia” was a “mere parrot” of these individuals\n(Delany 1852 [2004]: 185, emphasis in original). Demands for compensation related to slavery frequently came up\nduring the Civil War, but not in the way present day Americans would\nexpect. The demands were not to compensate the slaves for the injuries\nof slavery, but to compensate the slaveholders for the anticipated\nloss of their slaves. These demands were voiced in the South when they\nfaced the prospect of having to free their slaves, but also voiced in\nthe North, and from the highest sources. President Abraham Lincoln for\nexample repeatedly urged compensated emancipation, which meant paying\nthe slaveholders for the loss of their slaves who would then be\ndeported from America. Indeed at one time he appeared to be ready to\npropose paying the South $400,000,000, for the loss of their\nslaves. As W.E.B. Du Bois observed dryly\n  Lincoln was impressed by the loss of capital\ninvested in slaves, but curiously never seemed seriously to consider\nthe correlative loss of wage and opportunity of slave workers, the\ntangible results of whose exploitation had gone into the\nplanters’ pockets for two centuries.  (Du Bois 1992 [1935]:\n150)\n And Lincoln did not even sugar coat his\ndeportation proposal with the suggestion that the freedmen were a\nnation and therefore needed a separate territory on which to govern\nthemselves. Thaddeus Stevens, congressman from Pennsylvania argued that it was\nnot enough to free the slaves and give them the right of suffrage; but\nthat in addition they should be given land confiscated from the\nrebels. Charles Summer, senator from Massachusetts eventually came to\nagree with him, but surprisingly the radical ex-slave Frederick\nDouglass did not. In an excellent discussion Peter C. Myers speculates\nthat Douglass’s “moderation” at this point was a\nreflection of “what was politically possible”, and of his\nconcern that benevolent missions organized by whites might encourage\ndependence in the freedmen and prevent them from developing and\nexercising the virtues of a free people. Douglass’ proposed\ninstead a federal corporation that would purchase tracts of land and\nthen resell or lease them on favorable terms to the freedmen, urging\nthat this arrangement was “more fully consistent with the\nprinciple of self-reliance” and give “greater societal\nrecognition of the freed people’s virtue in providing for\nthemselves”. Meyers suggests that Douglass was following\nJefferson in emphasizing the corrupting effects of dependence. But\nwhile Jefferson had indeed identified dependence as a crucial\ncorrupter, it “begets subservience and venality, suffocates\nvirtue, and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition”\n(Jefferson 1954 [1785a]: 165) he declared, he was equally clear that\nlegislators must protect the independence of the small yeoman farmer\n“the most precious part of the state” from the usurpation\nof the powerful (Jefferson 2006 [1785b]: 154). In other words Stevens\nhad proposed his scheme for the freed people for exactly the reasons\nJefferson proposed legislation for protecting the white yeomen. Years\nlater Douglass evidently saw the error of his moderation. Myers cites\nhis comment in 1882 that had the counsels of Thaddeus Stevens, Charles\nSumner, and ‘leading stalwart Republicans’ prevailed,\n“the terrible evils from which we now suffer would have been\naverted”, and “the Negro to-day”, would be\n“tilling his soil in comparative independence” (Myers\n2008: 239, quoting Douglass 1882, Appendix A, 440–441). The\ntheme continues to the present day. Perhaps the most noteworthy demand for Black Reparations after the\nCivil War occurred in 1969 when James Foreman a member of the Student\nNonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), read his “Black\nManifesto” at the National Black Economic Development\nConference, in Detroit, and later on in Riverside Church. The\n“Manifesto” demanded $500,000,000, in reparations from\nChristian white churches and Jewish synagogues, or as the\n“Manifesto” put it, “15 dollars per\nnigger”. This demand for reparation the Manifesto argued was\njustified because over three and a half centuries, whites with the\nassistance and collaboration of their churches and synagogues had\nunjustly, through slavery and discrimination, wrested enormous\neconomic advantages from blacks. Although this argument relied on\nwidely accepted moral intuitions, the Manifesto received little\npopular support. It did however provoke discussion in newspapers and\nnews magazines as well as some scholarly discussion. Boris Bittker\nincluded it as an appendix in his book The Case for Black\nReparations (1973); Hugo Bedau provided and extended analysis in\nhis “Compensatory Justice and the Black Manifesto” (1972);\nMichael Harrington and Arnold Kaufman debated its merits in\n“Black Reparations—Two Views” (1969); and a number\nof philosophers wrote essays inspired by its argument. Although interest in the topic remained high among African American\nphilosophers, the wider community of political philosophers\npreoccupied with Rawlsian ideal theory generally ignored it. But broad\nand vigorous interest has been rekindled. Perhaps the causes lie\noutside of academia; in 1988 Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act\nwhich authorized payment of reparations to Japanese American citizens\nwho had been imprisoned during World War II; John Conyers has in each\nsession of Congress since 1989 introduced a bill to create a\ncommission to study reparations for slavery and segregation; in 2000\nRandall Robinson published his book The Debt: What America Owes to\nBlacks; in 2003 David Horowitz published his Uncivil\nWars; and in 2014 Ta-Nehisi Coates’s widely discussed essay\n“The Case for Reparations”, appeared in The\nAtlantic.  John Locke provided an early and very clear argument for the\nreparation owed a lawful conqueror, and many arguments for black\nreparations follow the outlines of his argument. For Locke people have\nnatural rights they get directly from Natural Law and rights they have\nacquired in accordance with Natural law. To restrain violations of\nrights he proposed punishment; punishment must be administered\n  with so much Severity as will suffice to make it\nan ill bargain to the Offender, give him cause to repent, and terrifie\nothers from doing the like. (Locke 1689: sec 8)\n And to repair the damage that crime “commonly” causes\n“some person or other” Locke proposed reparation. As he\nput it reparation must give the “satisfaction due to any private\nMan, for the damage he has received” (Locke 1689: sec\n11). According to Locke reparation was a right stemming from the right\nof self-preservation. But he insisted that the right can be pressed\nonly against the “goods or service of the Offender” (Locke\n1689: sec 11). More precisely while the person damaged can seek help\nfrom anyone, she, the victim, has a right to reparation only against\nthe one who wrongly caused her damage. But Locke does not say that she\nmust be the immediate victim of the “Offender”. His claim\nthat crime commonly damages “some person or other”\nsuggests that she may be anyone damaged as a result of the\noffender’s violation of right. For example she may be damaged\nbecause someone murdered her father and thus caused her to live in\nstraitened conditions. On Locke’s account she may be entitled to\npress her right to reparation against the murderer for the damage he\ncaused her to suffer. On the other hand Locke’s claim that crime\n“commonly” damages someone suggests that crime or\nviolations of rights do not always cause damage and\nconsequently do not always generate rights to reparation, though it\ndoes not suggest that such violations of right do not deserve to be\npunished. But even when the violation of right does not cause material\nlosses it may cause damages to its victim’s self-respect and\nmoral standing, and in such cases the satisfaction due to her may\ninclude an admission of wrong doing from the wrongdoer, a plea for her\nforgiveness, and an apology. If such admission, plea, and apology\nrequire that the wrongdoer repent, reparation may seem to require that\nthe wrongdoer be punished, given Locke’s view that repentance is\namong the objects of punishment (Locke 1689: sec 8). But Locke’s\nseems clear that the right to reparation and the right to punish are\ndifferent rights. On his view we give up the right to punish to the\nstate, but retain the right to reparation. The\n“Magistrate” he says “may remit deserved punishment\nwhere the “publick good demands not the execution of the\nLaw”, but he cannot “remit the satisfaction due to any\nprivate Man, for the damage he has received” (Locke 1689: sec\n11). Arguably then the apology the wrongdoer must give to his victim\nin order to give her the satisfaction she has a right to does not\nrequire that he repent and perhaps therefore does not require that his\napology be sincere. It is also worth noting that although unjust\nenrichment from crime should not be tolerated, it has little if\nanything to do with reparation. Reparation focuses on getting\nsatisfaction for the injured victim of crime and the criminal need not\nunjustly enrich himself as a result of the crime to have wrongfully\ninjured her. He owes her reparation even if he impoverished himself in\nthe process of injuring her. Finally given Locke’s separation of\nthe right to punish from the right of reparation, and his claim that\nthe right of reparation is about making satisfaction to the victim of\nwrongdoing, Locke would seem committed to holding that when an act of\nwrong doing is excused though it causes harm, that the victim has a\nright to reparation although the magistrate may well decide that the\npublic good does not require that the state exercise its right to\npunish the wrongdoer.  In its primary sense restitution is “restoration of something\nlost or stolen to its proper owner” (The New Oxford American\nDictionary 2001?). Clearly then reparation and restitution clearly\nboth presuppose the separation of something from its proper owner. But\nequally clearly reparation is not restitution. Reparation can only\noccur after some losses or damage due to a prior wrongdoing. But\nthough restitution can only occur after some loss or damage, that loss\nor damage need not be due to a prior wrongdoing. If A loses his\nwallet and B finds it and returns it to A, restitution\nhas been made although no wrongdoing was committed. Further while\nreparation is a right, though the right can be outweighed, restitution\nis not always a right. If B leaves A’s wallet\nwhere it is, restitution has not been made, but it is not clear that a\nright was violated. I doubt that a person who loses things has a right\nthat others find it for him. If B keeps the wallet then again\nrestitution has not been made, and A has a right that B\nreturn it. But in that case A has a right that B return\nit because he has a right to reparation and restitution can sometimes\nbe part of reparation. Some authors seem to think that B ought\nto return the wallet because otherwise he will have unjustly enriched\nhimself at A’s expense. But it is not clear to me why his\nunjust enrichment is a necessary condition for his obligation to\nreturn the wallet to A. Even if the wallet is worthless\nand B is not unjustly enriched by keeping it, he has no\nbusiness holding on to it since it is not his property.  Restitution is neither necessary nor sufficient for reparation even\nwhen the thing to be restored to its proper owner was\nstolen. If A steals a bicycle from B, B has a\nright to reparation and consequently to restitution if A has\nthe bicycle; reparation must give satisfaction, and A’s\nsatisfaction may depend on her getting back the very thing that was\nstolen from her. But she may have lost more that the bicycle as a\ndirect result of its theft and her right to reparation requires\nsatisfaction for that further loss. Consequently restitution is not\nalways sufficient for reparation. On the other hand the bicycle may\nhave been destroyed or loss after its theft, making restitution but\nnot reparation impossible. Consequently restitution is not necessary\nfor reparation. Compensation is related to reparation and restitution but is not\nthe same thing as either. It is not reparation because it simply makes\nup for damage, harm or loss or lack whether or not it was caused by\nwrongdoing. Robert Nozick’s famous definition of compensation\nmakes this sufficiently clear. It goes as follows:\n  Something fully compensates a person for a loss\nif and only if it makes him no worse off than he would otherwise have\nbeen; it compensates person X for\nperson’s Y’s action A if X is no\nworse off receiving it, if Y had not done A.  (Nozick\n1974: 57)\n Note that Nozick (correctly) does not say that\nthe loss or the action A must be wrongful. Thus a person may be\ncompensated for a loss though he does not have a right to\nreparation. If a person deserves a loss he has no right to reparation\nfor it, but he may be compensated for it, probably unjustifiably. Even\nif he has a right to compensation, he may still have no right\nto reparation. For example he may have a right to be compensated for a\nloss if he is insured against it, but his right is a right to\ncompensation not a right to reparation if no wrongdoing caused his\nloss. Similarly if a government is obligated to compensate its\ncitizens for damages caused by certain accidents or “acts of\nGod”, then they may have rights for compensation against their\ngovernment for losses caused by a hurricane though the government did\nnot wrongfully harm them. Of course, as in the case of Hurricane\nKatrina and New Orleans in 2005 people who suffer losses caused by a\nhurricane may have rights to reparation against their government if it\nwas obligated to build sea walls to protect them from hurricanes but\nnegligently failed to do so. But in that case their right to\nreparation would not be based simply on their losses but also on the\nfact that they resulted from the wrongdoing of the government\n(Goldberg 2006: 83–95). But if a person has a right to reparation he will also often have a\nright to compensation. This is because his right to reparation is a\nright to satisfaction for the damages he suffered and such\nsatisfaction often requires that he be made no worse off than he would\nhave been had he not suffered the loss. This does not make a right to\ncompensation the same thing as a right to reparation since a right to\nreparation can only be generated by damages caused by wrongdoing. Since a right to reparation is always generated by a wrongful harm,\nsuch rights are part of corrective justice or to use Rawls’s\nterm, “partial compliance theory” (Rawls 1971: 8, 9). But\nRawls must allow that there can be rights to compensation in full\ncompliance theory. This follows since people can suffer damages that\nresult from no one’s wrongdoing, and may have insured themselves\nagainst such damages. Consider too Rawls’s “principle of\nredress”. This is a principle of compensation for full\ncompliance theory. It may be objected that it cannot be such a\nprinciple, but must be instead a principle of non-ideal justice, since\naccording to Rawls himself it requires that “undeserved\ninequalities”, such as the “inequalities of birth and\nnatural endowment” be “somehow compensated\nfor” (Rawls 1971: 100). But Rawls’s use of\n“undeserved” at this point is not meant to imply that he\nis referring to inequalities that are the result of injustice. It only\nmeans that those with the inequalities in question did nothing to\ndeserve them. People with the “inequalities of birth and natural\nendowment” did nothing to deserve these inequalities. Neither\nare these inequalities necessarily the result of any injustice, though\nof course they could be. No one’s wrongful act need\nhave caused a baby to be born with autism or Down’s syndrome,\nthough again it could have.  As we have suggested reparation can require different things\ndepending on the nature of the wrongful harm that it addresses. As we\nsaw earlier it can require that territory wrongfully taken from a\ncountry be returned to that country. Or as Thaddeus Stevens urged it\ncould require that freed slaves be given forty acres and a mule to\nenable them to become independent yeomen farmers. Conceivably\nreparation for blacks today could require that they be according\npreferential treatment in the competition for jobs and places at\nuniversities or colleges. That possibility has been challenged on\ngrounds reminiscent of Douglass’s alleged opposition to\nStevens’s scheme, namely, that preferential treatment would\nundermine the self-reliance of its beneficiaries. Jefferson’s\nproposal cited earlier that legislators should make laws to enable the\npoor to become yeomen meets this challenge as effectively. Legislators\nencourage rather than undermine the self-reliance of the poor when\nthey make laws that protect them from the powerful or enable them to\nprotect themselves from the powerful. Sycophancy not self-reliance is\nencouraged by being always at the mercy of the powerful. A different\nchallenge has had more lasting effects and has thoroughly changed the\nface of affirmative action. Suppose to take a straightforward case\nthat a firm wronged and harmed a black person by denying her on\naccount of her race a well paying position for which she was the most\nqualified candidate. Plausibly the firm could satisfy her claim to\nreparation by hiring her in preference over better qualified\ncandidates for the same position if it became available. In fact when\naffirmative action was introduced some years ago its fiercest and most\neffective critics usually claimed that they would support it if it\ninvolved reparation of the sort just described. The problem as they\nsaw it was that most of affirmative action’s beneficiaries were\nyoung well qualified men and women who were entering the job market\nfor the first time. The defenders of affirmative action tried to meet\nthis objections by pointing out that if the youngsters’ parents\nand grandparents had suffered from unjust racial discrimination, then\nthe youngsters too had probably suffered from such discrimination even\nif indirectly and even if they were entering the job market for the\nfirst time. But the critics had anticipated this reply by insisting\nthat the parents and grandparents would have to prove in court that\nthey had suffered from unjust racial discrimination which was of\ncourse usually almost impossible for them to do. The defenders of\naffirmative action tried more complicated replies, but their attempts\nto justify affirmative action as reparation came to an end when the\nSupreme Court offered a far easier and ostensibly less divisive way to\njustify affirmative action. In the Bakke decision of 1978 the Court\nrejected the argument that affirmative action for blacks could be\njustified as compensation for disadvantages caused by past unjust\nracial discrimination, but allowed that such affirmative action could\nbe justified to secure “diversity”. Clearly with a\nsuitably flexible definition of “diversity” this new\nargument could justify affirmative action for a very wide variety of\ngroups. Probably it would fail to do so only for young able bodied\nmiddle and upper class white males. Although or perhaps because\nit’s main beneficiaries are now no longer African Americans it\nhas proved to be far more popular than the older arguments that tried\nto justify affirmative action as reparation. But this essay is about\nreparation and not specifically about affirmative action so I will not\nattempt to examine the flaws of the new diversity based argument for\naffirmative action. This entry focuses on making a case for reparations for\ncontemporary blacks for the enslavement of their ancestors, partly\nbecause slavery was the most horrific experience that blacks have\nendured in America, and the one for which the immediate victims of the\nexperience most clearly deserve reparation; and partly because making\nthe case in question nevertheless presents peculiar, difficult, and\ninteresting philosophical problems. As we will see much of that case\nwill depend on the argument that the injustices blacks endured after\nemancipation have caused some of the injuries of the slaves to persist\ninto the present. But there is no reason to suppose that these\ninjustices did not themselves cause damages to their victims, quite\napart from causing the damages of slavery to persist, and that these\ndamages may also deserve reparation. In fact there is good reason to\nsuppose that arguments to that effect may be more important\npolitically that slave based arguments for black reparations. Andrew\nValls and Jonathan Kaplan have published a stimulating essay that\nfocuses less on slavery and more on Jim Crow segregation and\nsystematic housing discrimination as a basis for contemporary black\nreparation claims. The issues they raise deserve more attention, but I\nwill persist in this entry on the issue of black reparations for\nslavery because as I hope we will agree it retains its fascination\ndespite its age.  Thaddeus Stevens’s argument for slave reparations was simply\nthat the slave holders had committed serious harmful transgressions\nagainst the slaves, who consequently had rights for reparation against\ntheir masters that could plausibly be satisfied by some of their\nmasters’ land. Today few would challenge that argument, at least\npublicly. The argument that many challenge today is that present day\nAfrican Americans have rights to reparation from the American people\nor the American government because three hundred years ago the\nAmerican government permitted the American people to enslave their\nancestors. That argument seems to get no support from the undeniable\nfact that their ancestors had rights to reparations from their\nmasters. People do not have rights to reparation for the wrongful\nharms others suffer. Two arguments which I have called the\nharm argument and the inheritance argument attempt to circumvent that\ndifficulty. The harm argument relies on the idea that the transgressions of\nslavery initiated an unbroken chain of harms linked as cause and\neffect that began with the slaves and continues among African\nAmericans to the present day. Therefore since the transgressions of\nslavery harm present day African Americans they have rights to\nreparation against those who committed those transgressions. It\ndiffers crucially from the inheritance argument because it assumes\nthat slavery’s transgressions against the slaves have harmed\npresent day African Americans but the inheritance argument does\nnot. The inheritance argument relies on the idea that present day\nAfrican Americans have inherited the rights to reparation that was\nowed their enslaved ancestors and was never paid.  Three main objections have been urged against the harm\nargument. First, that although the transgressions of slavery harmed\nthe slaves, and present day African Americans do suffer from many\ndisadvantages, these disadvantages may not be the result of the\ntransgressions of slavery; they could easily be the result of vast\neconomic and political changes that have occurred since slavery ended\none hundred and fifty years ago. As George Sher put it the present\nharms may not be the “automatic effects of slavery” (Sher\n1981: 7). Second, that even if present day African Americans have been\nharmed by the slaveholders’ transgressions against their\nancestors, and have rights to reparation against these slaveholders,\nsuch rights can only be pressed against the slaveholders who are now\nall dead. Third that if present day African Americans demand\nreparation for the harms that the transgressions of slavery caused\nthem, then since reparation implies compensation they demand to be\nmade no worse off than they would have been had the transgressions of\nslavery never occurred. But if these transgressions had never occurred\npresent day African Americans would not exist. Consequently the harm\nargument is incoherent (Morris 1984, Levin 1980). Fullinwider has reformulated the harm argument so that it avoids\nthe first two objections. His reformulated argument goes as follows:\nthe government after 1865 failed “to vindicate the rights to\nfull and equal citizenship the Civil War Amendments extended to\nblacks;” but, had that government “vigorously”\nprotected those rights, “the legacy of slavery would have faded\nconsiderably if not wholly by now through the industry of blacks\nthemselves”. Consequently if present day African Americans do\nsuffer from various aspects of the legacy of slavery, the real cause\nof those harms is not slavery, but the governments after 1865, for if\nthose governments had vigorously protected the rights of the freed\npeople and their descendants, the legacy of slavery would have faded\nand present day African Americans would not be disadvantaged by it\n(Fullinwider 2004). Boris Bittker made a similar suggestion. His main argument is that\nhad the goals of Reconstruction not been foiled by the\n“political settlement of 1877” and the network of Jim Crow\nlaws not been introduced and finally fully authorized by Plessy\nv. Ferguson in 1896 the “only identifiable residue of\nslavery today would have been cultural”, and the descendants of\nslaves and the descendants of slaveholders would lead the same lives\n(Bittker 2003: 12, 13). In other words though Bittker seems to go a\nlittle further than Fullinwider, suggesting that the legacy of slavery\nwould have disappeared completely if the nation had protected the\nrights of the freedpeople and their descendants, he too concludes that\nany responsibility for the legacy of slavery that persists today must\nbe attributed to post Civil War governments.  The arguments of Fullinwider and Bittker are a clear improvement on\nthe original harm argument. But they seem to assume that post Civil\nwar governments committed only one transgression against their black\npopulations, namely those governments failed to protect the civil\nrights of the members of those populations. In fact these governments\ncommitted another and quite distinct transgression against their black\npopulations; they failed to make reparation to those\npopulations. These two transgressions are not the same thing. The duty\nof government to protect its citizens’ civil and political\nrights is one thing; its duty to make reparation to them if it has\nwrongly injured them is another thing. Fullinwider seems aware that protecting civil and political rights\nis not the same as making reparation. He seems clear that the\nU.S. government did not fulfill all of its obligations to the Japanese\nit interred during World War ll just because it released them after\nthe war and protected their civil and political rights after that. But\nhe writes as if he believes that the post Civil war governments would\nhave fulfilled all of their obligations to their black citizens if\nonly they had protected those citizens’ civil and political\nrights (Fullinwider 2004: 148). Bittker’s oversights on this point are\nstrange. He writes on page 12 of his book that compensation\nin 1865 to the slaves for their forced or unpaid might have been\n“strong”, and on page 28 that “compensation in 1865\nfor blacks’ forced labor would certainly have been\nappropriate;” But having conceded that monetary compensation\nwould have been in order in 1865, he then drops the point without\ncomment. Interestingly too he seems to think that unpaid labor is the\nonly harm the transgressions of slavery caused the slaves or that\nmerits any mention. This is very strange in a book titled The Case\nfor Black Reparations for of course unpaid labor was perhaps the\nleast of the harms that the transgressions of slavery visited on the\nslaves. What about reparation for the theft of their liberty? But Fullinwider’s claim that  Had the federal government done nothing after\n1865 except vigorously protect the civil and voting rights of blacks,\nthe legacy of slavery would have faded considerably if not wholly by\nnow through the industry of blacks themselves\n suggests that only the governments’ failure to protect the\ncivil and political rights of the freed people and their descendants\ncaused any problem (Fullinwider 2004: 148). An obvious difficulty with\nthis view is that large economic inequalities make it difficult for\nthe government to protect the rights of the poor. That problem aside,\nFullinwider and Bittker give no argument to support their view that\nthe freed peoples’ descendants would have recovered from the\nharms of slavery without the help of reparation if only government had\nprotected their civil and political rights.  Fullinwider’s\nconfidence seems to rest on the “immigrant model”, by\nwhich he means the path to success taken by the European immigrants\nwho came to America after the Civil War, and with “little to\noffer but their physical labor”, and “by dint of hard\nwork” eventually “blended into the larger American\nfabric”. The implication is that the freed people were\nsufficiently like these immigrants to justify the inference that had\ngovernment vigorously protected their civil and voting rights then\nthey too by would have blended into the larger American fabric. But the freed people and their descendants were not very\nmuch like the white immigrants arriving from Europe. To say the\nobvious, slavery is very bad for people. It prevents them from\ndeveloping the useful dispositions and skills that people tend to\ndevelop in freedom. Although the immigrants had had a rough time in\nEurope—that is why they flocked to America—they were\nbetter prepared to take advantage of the opportunities available than\nthe slaves. Consequently they would likely have kept well ahead of the\nfreed people and their descendants even if the civil and political\nrights of each group were equally protected. The issue is debatable of\ncourse. Some black writers, Frederick Douglass, for example, seem to\nthink that human beings are resilient, equipped as they are with an\nalmost ineradicable love of liberty, and consequently the slaves would\nrecover readily from the rigors of slavery if only they were given\njustice. He liked to say that all he asked for the Negro was\n“simply justice”, though the contexts always left it\nunclear how much he included in justice, whether it would involve\nreparation, and whether he was simply denying that he was not asking\nfor “benevolence” or “pity” for the Negro\n(Douglass 1865: 283). Alexander Crummell on the other hand seemed to\nworry about the enduring effects of slavery especially because of the\ntendency of its victims to remember its horrors, though interestingly\nDouglass thought that these memories could be bracing (Crummell 1891:\n18, 19). The issue of the effects of the memory of enslavement and\ndomination on recovery from the effects of these evils deserves\nfurther study. Whatever the results of that study however it does not\nfollow straightaway that the wrongly injured are not owed reparation\njust because they are resilient enough to recover from the effects of\ntheir injuries without it. The economist Glenn Loury makes the further point that advancement\ndepends on informal contacts that involve the sharing and transfer of\ngenuinely useful information and skills among people who enjoy what\nused to be called “social equality”. But social equality\ncannot be secured by even the most rigorous protection of the civil\nand political rights of the freed people; on the contrary such\nprotection can help social inequality to persist since it entitles\nindividuals to choose their friends and associates even if their\nchoice is determined by color prejudice. Since color prejudice\nremained strong after the Civil war the white immigrants would more\nreadily associate with well placed and well educated locals and learn\nuseful information and skills from them. Finally since social equals\ntend to marry each other rather than their inferiors, and since\nimmigrant whites were more likely than the freed people and their\ndescendants to become the social equals of prosperous native whites,\nthey were also more likely to marry such individuals and thus to gain\naccess to their wealth, much of it incidentally inherited from the\nspoils of slavery.  Bittker seems aware that the official enforcement of civil and\npolitical rights might not nullify the effects of personal\nprejudice. Thus he asks whether “personal” prejudice\nwithout official segregation would have produced segregation,\n“first in the home, then in Mrs Murphy’s boardinghouse,\nand then in business and politics”. This issue is of decisive\nimportance for his implied contention that even without reparation\nblacks would have made themselves equal to whites if there had been no\nJim Crow legislation. He rejects William Graham Sumner’s maxim\n“law-ways cannot alter folkways” which implies that\nsegregation and prejudice could have persisted without the help of Jim\nCrow laws, but so far as I can see without given any argument to show\nthat the maxim was mistaken. He says simply that he takes it as a\n“working hypothesis” that\n  statutes, ordinances, and other official actions\nhave been the predominant source of the racial discrimination that\nhas blighted our public and private life,\n given that we have no science\n  capable of producing a model of the United States\nas it would have been if blacks had come here as voluntary immigrants\nrather than as slaves, or if emancipation had been followed by\n an integrated society (Bittner 2003: 26). The many and various considerations just canvassed suggest that\nFullinwider and Bittker are far too optimistic in supposing that the\ndescendants of the freed people, without reparation, would have\nachieved parity with the descendants of the immigrants if only their\ncivil and political rights had been protected. In any case the issue\nthey raise is a distraction from the central question whether African\nAmericans are owed reparation. Achieving parity with the descendants\nof immigrants is not the same thing as receiving the reparation one is\nowed. The point of reparation is not to make people equal to others;\nreparation is not defined as making the wrongly harmed equal\nto others. In fact, equality has little to do with reparation. People\ndeserve reparation when they have been harmed by transgression but a\nperson may be harmed as a result of transgression and may therefore\nhave a right to reparation and yet be better off than\nothers. Similarly a person may be worse off than others without having\nsuffered from any harm or disadvantage for which he deserves\nreparation. If reparation necessarily requires compensation it\nrequires that people be put as far as possible in the condition they\nwould have been in had they not been wrongly injured. This may make\nthem equal to others, but it may not. It can leave them worse off than\nothers and it can also make them better off than others. Some\nphilosophers may protest that we should not allow claims for\nreparation to get in the way of an ideal egalitarian society, but of\ncourse their position is as bad as the utilitarian arguments they\ndisparage that rights may and should be violated in order to maximize\nutility.  But it is now time to consider the third main objection to the harm\nargument. This objection let us recall is that making reparation to\nthe present black population for the harms that slavery caused it is\nimpossible because if slavery had never occurred the present black\npopulation would not exist. This problem is now known as the\nnon-identity problem. This difficulty might seem to reappear in the\nrevised harm argument I have just described. For although this\nargument does not call for compensating the present black population\nfor the harms that slavery caused it, it may seem to call for\ncompensating the present black population for the harms it suffers\nbecause of policies enacted and enforced before it was\nconceived. Given that these policies would have affected who was\nconceived in succeeding black populations, had they not occurred the\npresent black population would not exist.  The following discussion shows how this difficulty can be\navoided. Imagine two slaves, Tom and Beulah released from\nslavery. They were released from slavery but the government continued\nto wrong them in at least two ways: First, by preventing them from\nexercising rights guaranteed to every citizen; second, by violating\ntheir rights to be compensated for the harms that it had caused them\nby supporting their enslavement. And both these wrongs probably harmed\nthem. Obviously preventing them from voting or going to school\nprobably harmed them; and the harm that often results when one’s\nright to be compensated is violated is an additional harm, on top of\nthe harm caused by the first violation of right. If you owe me a\nhundred dollars to compensate me for wrongly breaking my arm, you\nwrong me again by refusing to give me what you owe me, and you might\nowe me another thousand dollars for the harms that second wrong might\ncause me, for example going around for a month with the pain and\ninconvenience of an unfixed broken arm. Now the government wronged Tom\nand Beulah in the two ways mentioned as soon as it caused them to be\nreleased from slavery and before Beulah conceived any child; but it\nalso continued to wrong them in these ways after the conception of\ntheir daughter, Eulah. These wrongs to Tom and Beulah almost certainly\nharmed them by forcing them to remain longer in the poverty and\nignorance that slavery had put them in. But it is more germane to the\npresent argument that the wrongs also almost certainly harmed their\ndaughter Eulah. They harmed her by keeping her parents in poverty and\nignorance and by therefore also keeping her in ignorance and\npoverty. They also harmed her by causing her to be raised by parents\nwith the various disabilities that the experience of slavery normally\ncauses its victims. And if she acquired these disabilities from her\nparents by imitation and necessity, and if these disabilities harmed\nher, the government’s wrongs caused those harms too. If\nwrongdoers must make reparation for the damages their wrongdoing\ncauses other people then the government must make reparation to Eulah.\n The argument is not that Eulah has a claim to the compensation her\nparents Tom and Beulah’s were owed and never paid. If that were\nthe argument we would have an inheritance argument, not a\ncounterfactual argument. Eulah’s claim for compensation is for\nharms she herself suffered. And she can rightly press that claim\nagainst the government. It is not as though her parents could have\ndone better by her but chose not to. The government’s wrongs\nprevented them from doing better by her. They had no choice but to\nraise her in poverty and ignorance. The government could have given\nthem a choice if it had compensated for their wrongfully caused harms,\nor allowed to recover from them. But it did not. Second the amount of\nthe compensation she is owed does not depend on the amount of\ncompensation they were owed. It depends on the harms she\nsuffered. Though she suffered those harms because they were harmed and\nnot compensated, compensating her for her harms may be much more, (or\nmuch less), than compensating them.  Third, she may have an inheritance based claim to their\ncompensation. The fact that she was harmed because they were not\ncompensated and can claim compensation for that harm does not mean\nthat they lose their claim to be compensated for their harms. If they\nwere never compensated she may therefore inherit a right to their\ncompensation. The counterfactual argument is compatible with the\ninheritance based argument. Fourth, her claim for compensation is not confounded by the\nargument that she would not exist had the wrongs that caused her harms\nnot occurred. Those wrongs are not the wrongs of slavery, which\noccurred before she was conceived, and indeed were among the causes of\nher being conceived. And they are not the wrongs that government\ncommitted against her parents after it released them from slavery and\nbefore she was conceived. They are the wrongs that were all committed\nafter her conception. They are the wrongs of not protecting her\nparents’ rights and failing to compensate them for the wrongs\nalready committed against them. Had those wrongs not been committed,\nshe would have lived in less straitened conditions, and would have\nbeen less constrained to imitate and duplicate her parents slavery\ninduced qualities and habits. Nahshon Perez has mounted a rebuttal of the argument to avoid the\nnon-identity problem that I have just presented. He calls that\nargument the “timing argument”. Perez argues that the\ntiming argument fails to distinguish two different arguments, one for\nrestitution and one for compensation. He does not challenge the\nrestitution argument, but claims that the compensation argument\nfails. This is because, he argues, a person owes compensation for the\ndamage done to the victim/descendant from an earlier wrong for which\nhe is culpable, but\n  by hypothesis the original wrong is over, all the\noriginal wrongdoers have passed away; current persons have not wronged\ndescendants of victims of the distant original injustice. (Perez 2014:\n212) But in my version of the timing argument although the crime of\nslavery has ended and its main wrongdoers are all dead, new\nwrongdoers have taken their place, committing new crimes that ensure\nthat the damages caused by the earlier crime of slavery persist, and\nit is these new wrongdoers who are required to compensate the\ndescendants of the slaves. As I noted immediately after slavery ended\nthese new wrongdoers were the former slaveholders now in the guise of\nexploiting capitalists, and committing new crimes that prevented the\nex-slaves from recovering from their ordeal in slavery; for example\nby refusing to compensate their former slaves and preventing them\nfrom exercising the rights guaranteed to all citizens. Of course some\nof these crimes were committed before their ex-slaves had conceived\nany children, and consequently might have helped determine who the\nchildren they conceived were. But the crimes in question continued\nafter their slaves conceived their children, in particular Eulah in\nmy example, and could therefore not have helped determine that Eulah\nwas conceived.  And Eulah is claiming compensation only for the\ndamages caused by the crimes that were committed after she was\nconceived. Had those crimes not been committed she would still have\nbeen conceived, and consequently her claim for compensation for the\ndamages they caused her is not incoherent.  But suppose that a tenacious skeptic raises the following\nobjection: the timing argument relies on the two crimes that I called\nthe “later” crimes; but one of these two later crimes, the\ncrime of refusing to compensate Tom and Beulah for their enslavement,\nseems impossible to commit unless the first crime of slavery was\nalready committed. A person cannot commit the crime of refusing to\ncompensate his former slaves unless he had former slaves and\nconsequently had already committed the crime of slavery. Consequently\nif Eulah is claiming compensation for the harms she suffered because\nTom and Beulah were not compensated for being enslaved, she is\nclaiming that Tom and Beulah should be compensated for the harms they\nsuffered as a result of being enslaved. That is, assuming that Tom and\nBeulah would not have been enslaved if there had been no slavery, she\nis claiming they should be brought to the condition they would enjoy\nif there had been no slavery. But if there had been so slavery, Tom\nand Beulah would never have existed. And if Tom and Beulah had never\nexisted, then Eulah would never exist. Consequently the non-identity\nproblem persists.  This attempt to revive the non-identity problem does not affect the\nsecond of the former slaveholders “later” crimes, namely,\ntheir preventing their former slaves from exercising the rights\nguaranteed to all citizens; the former slaveholders could have\ncommitted that crime without having first committed the crime of\nslavery. But it seems to affect the first of the former\nslaveholders’ later crimes, namely, failing to compensate Eulah\nfor the harmful consequences she suffered because the slaveholders\nrefused to compensate her parents for the damages they suffered as a\nresult of being enslaved. Certainly the slaveholders could not\npossibly have committed that crime if they had not already committed\nthe crime of enslaving Eulah’s parents. But this attempt to\nrevive the non-identity problem ignores the difference between\nclaiming compensation for the descendants of slaves for the evil\nconsequences they suffered because of the enslavement of their parents\nand ancestors; and compensating slaves for the evil consequences they\nsuffer because of their own enslavement. The first sort of\ncompensation may run afoul of the non-identity problem, but the second\ndoes not. Compensating slaves for the harms resulting from their own\nenslavement involves compensating them for the pain, exploitation, and\nloss of liberty that comes with being a slave. It does not involve any\nattempt to compensate slaves for the harms they suffered because their\nparents were enslaved and not compensated. Such an attempt would raise\nthe non-identity problem. But the timing argument for Eulah’s\nright to compensation does not claim that Tom and Beulah’s\nformer masters should compensate Tom and Beulah for the harms they\nsuffered because their parents were enslaved. It claims only that Tom\nand Beulah’s former masters should compensate them for the harms\nthey suffered because they, Tom and Beulah, were enslaved. And\nalthough they wronged and harmed Tom and Beulah by never compensating\nthem, my argument for Eulah’s right to compensation relies only\non the harms they suffered after Eulah’s conception. That\nargument therefore raises no non-identity problems.  The case for Eulah’s compensation can be repeated for her\nchildren. The government did not compensate their mother; this\ninjustice impoverished her mother, and although this began to harm her\nbefore her children were conceived, they began to harm her children\ntoo as soon as they were conceived; and they therefore have a claim\nfor compensation against the government for the harm its injustice of\nfailing to compensate their mother after they were conceived caused\nthem. Their claim for compensation is not a claim to inherit the\ncompensation she was owed for her harms, but a claim for compensation\nfor their own harms. The amount of their compensation does not depend\non the amount of her compensation, but on how much the failure to\ncompensate her harmed them. I suspect that it will be greater than her\ncompensation, given that there are many of them and one of her. In\naddition to their claim for compensation for their injuries, they may\nalso have an inheritance based claim for the compensation she was owed\nbut never paid. Their claims for compensation are for harms they\nthemselves suffered from, but some of these harms would have their\norigin in slavery since they suffered them because their mother lived\nin straitened conditions, and she lived in straitened conditions\nbecause her parents, Tom and Beulah were harmed by slavery, prevented\nfrom recovering from these harms and never compensated. And again,\nthere is no danger that their grandchildren would fail to exist had\nthe injustice that caused their harms not occurred, for that injustice\nwas not slavery or the failure to compensate their grand parents which\noccurred long before they were conceived and were probably among the\nconditions for their conception, but the failure to compensate their\nmother, which we can suppose occurred after they were conceived. No\ninnocent is asked to make compensation since every new generation of\nwhites did its part in holding down every new generation of blacks at\nor near the level to which their slave ancestors had been\nreduced. Proceeding in this way we can arrive at the present\ngeneration of African Americans. They are entitled to seek reparation\nfrom the government for the harms it caused them by failing to\ncompensate their parents. The inheritance argument for black reparation says that the freed\npeople had rights to reparation for their injuries; that they held\nthese rights against the slave holders and also against the state and\nfederal government for failing in its duty to protect them from the\nslave holders; that these rights were never honored; and finally that\nthey passed by the right of inheritance to present day African\nAmericans who are their descendants and heirs. This argument avoids the objection that the present black\npopulation would not exist if their ancestors had never been\nenslaved. As Thompson puts it\n  The claims of descendants depend on them being\nthe heirs of their forebears—not on their being the particular\nindividuals they are. The fact that they might not have existed if\nthat injustice had not been done does not undermine their\nclaim. (Thompson 2002: 108)\n And each premise seems plausible. When people\ndie their rights to their property are normally passed on to their\nheirs (Boxill 1972: 113–122; Kershnar 1999: 95–101). The\nreparation owed to the freed people was their property; it was never\nin their physical possession of course, but obviously something need\nnot be in your possession to be your property. Neither did the freed\npeople abandon their inheritance. Laws and guns very forcefully kept\nit from them. Consequently it should pass, by right of inheritance,\nto their descendants, the present black population.  Two important objections against the inheritance argument are:\nfirst that it relies on the counterfactual claim that the freed people\nand their descendants would have held on to their reparation had they\nreceived it; and second that it demands that people make reparation\nfor the injuries of a crime that they could not have committed. Let us\nbegin with the second. Locke’s discussion of a lawful conqueror’s rights to\nreparation suggests how to solve it. “The right of\nConquest”, Locke claims,\n  extends only to the Lives of those who\njoyn’d in the War, not to their Estates, but only in order to\nmake reparation for the damages received, and the Charges of the War,\nand that too with reservation of the right of the innocent Wife and\nChildren. (Locke 1689: sec. 180)\n Locke’s claim is that the lawful conqueror\nhas rights to reparation from the estates of those who unjustly waged\nwar against him, though some part of these estates should be reserved\nfor their wives and children. The clear implication is that the wives\nand children would have gotten a larger part of the estates in\nquestion had their husbands and fathers not harmfully transgressed\nagainst the lawful conqueror; but Locke would be guilty of\nself-contradiction if he had meant that the wives and children were\nbeing forced to make reparation for the harms their fathers’\nand husbands’ the crimes caused. His view was that when people\nunjustly harm others, a portion of their estates may be used to make\nreparation to the people they harmed, and as a necessary result their\nchildren cannot inherit that portion of their estates. The following argument parallels Locke’s argument: the slave\nholders harmed the slaves. Consequently the slaves had rights to\nreparation against the estates of the slave holders; these rights\nreduced the extent of the estates that the slave holders’\nchildren would otherwise have inherited from them; the slaves were\nforcibly prevented from exercising those rights; but it is absurd to\nsuppose that people lose rights just because they are forcibly\nprevented from exercising those rights; consequently the slaves\nretained their rights against the estates of the slave holders;\npresent day African Americans are their heirs; consequently present\nday African Americans have rights against the estates of the slave\nholders. This argument does not prove much. Even if many descendants\nof the slave holders can be identified, proving that they inherited\ntheir property from their slave holding ancestors seems hopeless. But\nthe argument can be improved. The first step is to see that the slaves\ndid not have rights to reparation only against the slave holders. This\nstep may seem to follow easily from Locke’s famous theory that\nresidence in a state is tacit consent to it (Locke 1689: sec\n119). This theory applied to the case of the lawful conqueror might\nseem to commit Locke to the view that the lawful conqueror had rights\nto reparation against all members of the state that waged the unjust\nwar against him. But in fact Locke explicitly denied that it\ndid. “The people” he said gave\n  to their governors no power to do an unjust\nthing, such as is to make an unjust War, (for they never had such\npower in themselves:) They ought not to be charged as guilty of the\nViolence and Injustice that is committed in an Unjust war, any\nfurther than they actually abet it. (Locke 1689: sec 179)\n And he identified those who “actually\nabet” and unjust war as those who “assisted, concurred,\nor consented”, to that war (Locke 1689: sec 179). It may seem\nthat Locke is guilty of self-contradiction here at least if we\nsuppose that to consent to something, even tacitly, is to give the\n“power”, that is, the right to do it. But Locke evidently\ndid not suppose that to consent to another’s action is to give\nthe other the right to do it; and no one else supposes that it does,\nexcept perhaps confused philosophers. For such a supposition implies\nthat one could not consent to another’s unjust action since of\ncourse one cannot give another a right to act unjustly, but of course\npeople can and do often consent to another’s unjust action. To\nconsent to another’s action is “to make oneself a partner\nin the other’s action and to accept a share in the\nresponsibility for it” (Boxill 1993: 96–99). This\nsuggestion may seem to leave us with the conclusion that if residence\nin a state is tacit consent to it, as Locke’s theory says, then\nall the residents of a state must have accepted responsibility for\nthe state’s actions, including its unjust wars, and\nconsequently that the just conqueror must have rights to reparation\nagainst all residents of the state. But as we have seen Locke denies\nthat the lawful conqueror has such rights. The solution to this\npuzzle lies in a peculiarity of most signs of tacit consent. The\npeculiarity is that signs of tacit consent are normally conditions\npeople have good reason to be in other than to give their\nconsent. Thus residence in a state is a sign of tacit consent to it\nbecause most residents of a state have good reason to reside in the\nstate other than to give consent to it. Since a sign of consent would\nbe coerced, and consequently not a sign of consent if not making it\nis impossible or very costly, it follows that every sign of tacit\nconsent, like residence in a state, must be such as to allow people\nto make the sign, while withdrawing their consent by making some\ncheap and easily performed sign of dissent. This reasoning suggests\nhow Locke can say both that residence in a state is tacit consent to\nits actions and that the lawful conqueror has rights to reparation\nfrom only those who “assisted, concurred, or consented”,\nto their state’s unjust wars against him. All residents of a\nstate have tacitly consented to its actions but only those who fail\nto make some sign of dissent to its unjust wars, have consented to\nits waging these wars, at least if there are signs of dissent that\nare relatively easy to make and are not too costly. Returning to the question of reparations for slavery, Americans\nprior to the Civil war knew that their government permitted and\nsupported slavery and also knew that slavery was a crime. The slave\nholding states certainly tried to conceal the full horrors of their\n“peculiar institution” but the evidence suggests that\ntheir efforts were not successful. Consequently, since few white\nAmericans expressed dissent from their government’s complicity\nin the crime of slavery, although it did not punish such dissent, it\nseems fair to conclude that most white Americans consented to their\ngovernment’s complicity in the crime. In Locke’s language\nthey “assisted, concurred, or consented” to the\ngovernment’s injustice against the slaves. Therefore still\nfollowing Locke, it follows that the slaves had rights to reparation\nagainst the entire white population of the United States for the\ndamages that their enslavement caused them. This argument is perhaps\nopen to the objection that there was in the period of slavery more\nthan a little dissent to the government’s complicity in the\ncrime of slavery; certainly the abolitionists strongly expressed their\ndissent.  Or alternatively it could be objected that dissenting from\nthe government’s complicity in slavery in the Deep South did\ncarry considerable costs including costs not necessarily imposed by\nthe government. Finally the argument also requires a fuller account of\nwhat residents of a state must do in order to make appropriate signs\nof dissent from the injustice of their government, and consequently to\navoid being accused of consenting to that injustice.  Presumably\nconfiding to a few friends that one was opposed to slavery would not\nbe enough. But if these problems can be satisfactorily settled, then\nsince the slaves had titles to reparation against the estates of those\nwho assisted, concurred or consented to their enslavement, they would\nhave titles to reparation against practically the entire white\npopulation, not just against the estates of the slave\nholders. This reparation was never paid. Instead each white\ngeneration specified that only whites of the succeeding generation\nwere permitted to own, or compete for, or be educated by, the assets\nit was leaving behind.  Since the slaves had titles to reparation\nagainst these assets, and the present generation of African Americans\nis the slaves’ heir, the present generation of African Americans\nhas inherited titles to a portion of the assets held by the present\nwhite population. This includes the white immigrants who arrived in\nthe U.S. after the abolition of slavery to take advantage of\nopportunities, funded by assets the slaves had titles to, or for the\neducation the slaves and descendants were prevented from getting, or\nto take natural assets including land that the slaves also had titles\nto. The fact that they competed for these opportunities and worked\nhard misses the point since many of these “so called”\nopportunities had already been inherited by and were the property of,\nthe slaves’ heirs. Locke put a limit on the right to reparation. In the case he\ndiscussed the lawful conqueror’s right to reparation was limited\nby reservations made for the rights of the wife and children of those\nengaged in or consented to the unjust war against him. As Locke put it\n  The Conqueror has a Title to Reparations for\nDamages received, and the Children have a Title to their\nFather’s Estate for their Subsistence…What must be done\nin the case? I answer; The Fundamental Law of Nature being, that all,\nas much as may be, should be preserved, it follows, that if there be\nnot enough fully to satisfy both, viz, for the Conqueror’s\nLosses, and the Children’s Maintenance, he that hath, and to\nspare, must remit something of his full Satisfaction, and give way to\nthe pressing and preferable Title of those, who are in danger to\nperish without it. (Locke 1689: sec.183)\n Thus Locke appeals to the Fundamental Law of\nNature which requires that all or as much as may be should be\npreserved in order to argue that that the lawful conqueror’s\nright to reparation must give way if it comes into conflict with the\nrights to subsistence and maintenance of the children of those who\nowe him reparation. But Locke does not say that the lawful\nconqueror’s right to reparation is trumped by the\nchildren’s right to inheritance; on his account, it is\nthe right to subsistence that trumps the right to reparation when the\ntwo rights conflict. When Locke limits the conqueror’s right to\nreparation he does so in order to accommodate the rights to\nsubsistence of innocent children. He is concerned that such children\nwill die if he presses the right to reparation too hard, not that\nthey will inherit very little. Do these reasonable limitations on the right of inheritance have\nany relevance to whether African Americans have a right to inherit the\nreparation owed their slave ancestors? Here it is important to note\nthese limitations do not abolish or cancel the right to\ninheritance. They do not imply, that is, that there is no right to\ninherit at all. They allow that there is such a right, and that it\nholds in normal circumstances, but that it fails to hold or is\noutweighed when allowing it to hold would make innocent people\ndestitute, or create large inequalities that are likely to lead to\nexploitation and domination. In other words we cannot set aside the\ninheritance argument just because it depends on the right of\ninheritance. We can set aside the inheritance argument aside only if\nimplementing it would make innocent people destitute or create large\ninequalities that are likely to lead to their exploitation and\ndomination. But would implementing the inheritance argument have these\nresults? It would not. The slaves were horribly harmed by slavery, but\nmaking reparation to them would not have required turning over a\ncontinent to them. It would have called for no horrendous uprooting of\npopulations, or driven anyone into poverty, or created morally\noutlandish inequalities. The slaves would not suddenly have become the\nmasters and the whites their subordinates. The nation could have made\nreparation and suffered mild discomfort at worst. As for the right of\ninheritance of their heirs, we must remember that it is not limited by\nthe mere length of time between benefactor and heir. The right of\ninheritance is limited by the dangerous and morally repugnant\ninequalities that would result from honoring it. These could appear\nafter one generation, or fail to appear after ten generations. We are\ncertainly not speaking here of a statute of limitations. It would be\nwrong for someone’s immediate heir to insist on his right to\ninherit his father’s goods if this would cause undue hardship to\nothers, or put him in a position to oppress them. But it would be\nright for someone’s distant heir to insist on her right to\ninherit his goods if this could save her from hardship or oppression\nat the hands of her debtors. But is not this latter case exactly\nsimilar to that of African Americans in the U.S.? Would they not save\nthemselves from hardship and oppression at the hands of their debtors\nif they insisted on their right to inherit the reparation that was\nowed their slave ancestors and never paid? Jeremy Waldron has objected to arguments for reparation for\n“historic” injustices specifically Europeans’ theft\nof Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S. from their original\nowners the Aborigines, Maori, and Native Americans (Waldron 1992:\n4–28). His objection is that the historic wrongs of the\nancestors of the Europeans now in the territories have been\n“superseded” (Waldron 1992: 24). Possibly the objection\ncan be raised against the inheritance argument for black\nreparation. Waldron uses the following example to illustrate what he means by\nan historic wrong being superseded. Suppose he says that there are\nplenty of water holes on the savanna and two groups P\nand Q each have a waterhole, but\n  motivated purely by greed, members of\ngroup Q descend on the water hole possessed by group P\nand insist on sharing that with them. (What’s more they do not\nallow reciprocity; they do not allow members of P to share any\nwater hole that was legitimately in the possession of Q.) That\nis an injustice. But then circumstances change, and all the water\nholes of the territory dry up except the one that originally belonged\nto P. The members of group Q are already sharing that\nwater hole on the basis of their earlier incursion. But now that\ncircumstances have changed, they are entitled to share the water hole;\nso that their doing so no longer counts as an injustice. It is in fact\npart of what justice requires. The initial injustice of Q\nagainst P has been superseded by circumstances. (Waldron 1992:\n25) What does Waldron mean when he says that circumstances have changed\nso that the initial injustice “has been superseded?” The\nmeaning his example suggests is that although the members of Q\nacted unjustly when they first shared P’s water hole,\nthey do not act unjustly now when they share P’s water\nhole; and this is because circumstances have changed. In the changed\ncircumstances the members of P and Q are now joint owners of the\nwaterhole. Waldron indicates that this follows from one of the\nconditions Locke laid down as necessary for taking something as\nproperty, the Lockean proviso, as Nozick famously put it (Nozick 1974:\n175; Locke 1689: sec 27). According to the proviso the water hole used\nto be P’s waterhole when circumstances were such that it\nwas permissible for P to make it is property. But circumstances\nhave changed so that it is no longer permissible for P to make\nthe waterhole his exclusive property. The present circumstances make\nthe waterhole the joint property of P and Q. This argument seems persuasive if we suppose that the only\nalternative to making the waterhole the joint property of P\nand Q is for P to prevent Q from using its water\nsince it that case Q would die very painfully. But there are\nother alternatives. Members of P (Ps) can generously\nallow the members of Q (Qs) to use the water; or they\ncan sell the water to the members of Q; or they can\nrent Q a piece of land next to the waterhole. These\nalternatives may be ruled out by Locke’s apparent opposition to\narrangements that put some people in a position of extraordinary\ndependence on others. For example he argued that a beggar has a\n“right” to a portion of a rich man’s surplus when\nshe must have it in order to survive. If so the Qs must have\nrights to an adequate supply of the water in P’s\nwaterhole. Otherwise if the Ps with ostensible generosity\nallowed Qs to drink they could also have demanded demeaning\nbehavior from the Qs in exchange; or if they sold water to\nthe Qs they could raise its price as much as they liked; and so\non. But in any case there are alternatives to the joint ownership of\nthe waterhole by the Ps and Qs that do not turn\nthe Qs into P’s dependents. We could for example\ndivide the waterhole so that the Qs get an adequate supply of\nwater and are not dependent on the Ps. In that case the entire case for supersession would seem to rest on\nthe Lockean proviso and its alleged prohibition of claiming unowned\nstuff as property when there is not enough and as good left over for\nothers. I say “alleged prohibition” for it is not at all\nclear that Locke’s words amount to such a prohibition. However I\nwill not dispute the issue because the supersession thesis fails even\nif we allow the prohibition. To see this let us agree that\nthe Ps and Qs are now joint owners of the waterhole and\nthat the Ps cannot demand that the Qs depart leaving\nthem the waterhole’s sole owners. Our agreement does not imply\nthat we also agree that the Ps cannot demand reparation from\nthe Qs for the damages that the Qs earlier wrongly\ncaused them. That would be absurd because it implies that\nthe Ps and the Qs had always been joint owners of the\nwaterhole, but by assumption the Ps and Qs were not\nalways joint owners of the waterhole. In particular, by assumption,\nthe Ps were once the sole owners of the waterhole when\nthe Qs attacked them and stole their water. This foregoing\nsketch is meant to parallel the case of the Europeans and native\npeoples in New Zealand, Australia, and the Americas. For convenience\nlet us speak of the Europeans and the Maoris in New Zealand. We\nconcede that these two people are now the joint owners of the land\nmass of New Zealand. The Maoris cannot demand that land mass back as\nreparation because they are no longer its sole owners. They used to be\nits sole owners, but circumstances have changed and now they are only\nits joint owners. No one can demand that anyone leave. But that\nconcession does not make the injustice of the European conquest two\nhundred years ago disappear into thin air. New Zealand may not now\nbelong exclusively to the Maori, but it once did, and when it did, the\nEuropeans did then injure them unjustly. If those injuries persist in\nthe Maoris’ descendants because the European conquerors and\ntheir descendants did not make reparation to the original Maoris,\ntheir descendants have rights to reparation against the\nEuropeans’ descendants for their injuries, even if they do not\nhave rights that the Europeans’ descendants leave New Zealand to\nthem. To put the point in a different way, the fact that restitution\nis no longer possible and morally mandatory does not imply that\nreparation is not still possible and morally mandatory. Restitution,\nthe return of a stolen item to its rightful owner, is often a part of\nmaking reparation to the victim of the theft, but as I stressed\nearlier it is neither necessary nor sufficient for such reparation. It\nis not sufficient because if I steal your bicycle and then return it\nto you, though I have made restitution I have not made reparation\nsince the damages you suffer as a result of my theft may be more that\nthe loss of the bicycle; and restitution the return of your bicycle\nmay not cancel, undo or erase the damages you suffered as a result of\nmy theft. And restitution is not necessary for reparation because\nwhile the loss or destruction of a stolen item may make its\nrestitution impossible, it does not make reparation for the loss of\nthe item impossible or obligatory. If the bicycle I stole from you is\nlost restitution is impossible. But it does not follow that reparation\nis impossible. I can still make reparation to you by providing you\nwith the money to buy another one. The distinction between restitution and reparation resolves another\ncase that Waldron presents us with evidently in order to weaken\nsympathies for reparation for historic injustices. The case involves\nthe theft of a car that ends up years later the treasured possession\nof the thief’s daughter who has no idea that it was stolen. In\nthe meantime the car’s original owner has eventually outgrown\nhis attachment to it and gotten many other cars. The inference that we\nare invited to draw is that it would be wrong for him to compel the\nthief’s daughter to return the car to him, given that she has\ninvested so much of her life in it and he has lost interest in\nit. Perhaps; but just because it would be wrong of him to demand\nrestitution, it does not follow that it would be wrong of him to\ndemand reparation; that his rights to reparation are somehow\n“superseded”. This is an entirely different question. The\nowner may act wrongly in insisting on restitution; maybe he should\nallow the thief daughter to keep the car. But it does not follow that\nhe cannot demand reparation from the thief for the losses he suffered\nas a result of the theft of his car. These results should make it obvious that the supersession argument\ncannot nullify claims for reparation for historic injustices. To\nconsider the example of New Zealand, perhaps restitution of the land\nmass of New Zealand to the Maori is out of the question. Perhaps\njustice cannot demand that Europeans leave New Zealand to the\nMaori. But it does not follow that justice does not demand that the\nEuropeans make reparation to the Maori for violating their rights and\ninjuring them when New Zealand belonged to them. Theft injures the\nvictim by depriving him of the thing that was stolen from him; but it\nalso injures him by depriving him of the benefits that he was going to\nearn and enjoy because of his possession of that thing. For the\nreasons we have surveyed he may lose his rights to restitution; the\nthing for example may be lost or destroyed. But it does not follow\nthat he therefore also loses his rights to reparation. Arguments for\nthose rights have to deal with the various objections to historic\nreparations reviewed in this entry, but they are not undone by the\nsupersession argument.","contact.mail":"brboxill@email.unc.edu","contact.domain":"email.unc.edu"}]
