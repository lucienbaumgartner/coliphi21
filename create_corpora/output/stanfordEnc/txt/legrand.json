He was born\nin Douai, (at the time under rule by the Spanish Hapsburgs), and early\nin life was associated with an English community of Franciscans who had\na college there. Le Grand became a Franciscan Recollect friar prior to\nleaving for England as a missionary in 1656. In England, he taught\nphilosophy and theology, advocating Catholicism and eventually\nCartesianism, the latter being as unpopular as the former was perilous.\nIt is not clear how Le Grand came to Cartesianism, but the first\nevidence of his adoption of the new philosophy was in his\nInstitutio Philosophiae, published in London in 1672. His\nearly works show affinities to the philosophies of Seneca and\nEpicurus.  He is noted for his polemical exchanges with Samuel Parker\nand John Sergeant, and for having given Descartes’s work a\nScholastic form to further its acceptance in the schools. \n\n\n\nLe Grand lived in London for many years before retiring to Oxfordshire\ntowards the close of his life in 1695. He was generally well-received\nat the University of Cambridge, perhaps owing to the influence of some\nleading Neo-Platonists at Cambridge such as John Smith, Henry More, and\nRalph Cudworth, who were at least initially sympathetic to Descartes’s\nideas. John Smith, author of Select Discourses (1660), and the\nearliest recorded partisan of the Cartesian philosophy in England, was\nthe first to introduce the study of Descartes to Cambridge. Henry More\ncorresponded with Descartes, and was sympathetic until about 1665, when\nhe launched the most vigorous attack on Cartesianism in the age, in his\nEnchiridion Metaphysicum (1671). Cudworth, like More although\nwith less venom, objected to Descartes’s mechanistic account of the\nmaterial world in his The True Intellectual System of the\nUniverse (1678). It was Le Grand who debated and defended\nDescartes’s philosophy to these English critics.  \n\nAccording to Anthony Wood, a contemporary of Le Grand’s and an\nhistorian at Oxford, Le Grand’s Institutio Philosophiae,\nsecundum principia Domini Renati Descartes (1672), was a\n“must read” at Cambridge. (Wood, 1691, p. 620) Further\nattesting to the attention it attracted, Jean Robert Armogathe has\ndetailed how the 1678 edition of this work came to be placed on the\nIndex in 1709 because of its anti-scholastic arguments.(Armogathe,\n2003) Le Grand also published an edition of Jacques\nRohault’s Traité de physique (1671), an\nenormously popular physics text, using Bonnet’s 1672 Latin\ntranslation with added commentary, Jacobi Rohaulti tractatus\nphysicus (1682). In 1692, Samuel Clarke published his own Latin\nedition of the text, which incorporates his and Le Grand’s\ncommentary in the form of footnotes. Clarke, an adherent of\nNewton’s physics, thought he could best propagate the new\ndoctrine by publishing Rohault’s text with suggestive notes\ndirected at the necessity of modifying Cartesian theory. According to\nthe biographical preface to Clarke’s Works, at the time\nof his entrance to Cambridge in 1691,\nRohault’s Traité was the standard modern\nscientific text, and Newton’s Principia (1687), had not\nyet been accepted: “The philosophy of Des Cartes was then the\nEstablished philosophy of that university, and the system of nature\nhardly allowed to be explained any otherwise than his principles\n… . The Great Sir Isaac Newton had indeed then published his\nPrincipia. But this book was but for the few.” Eventually\nClarke’s translation of the\nTraité, which underwent four editions, became the new\npreferred Cambridge textbook, as the Cartesian physics gave way to that\nof Newton early in the eighteenth century. \n\nAntoine Le Grand’s most substantial work, An Entire Body of\nPhilosophy According to the Principles Of the Famous Renate des\nCartes (1694), is a Cartesian tract from beginning to\nend. Richard Blome translated the works into English, which includes\nalterations and additions by Le Grand himself. It is divided into\nthree books, based on three Latin texts, Institutio\n(1672), Historia naturae (1673), and Dissertatio de\ncarentia sensus et cogitationis in brutis (1675). The first\nbook, The Institution, is intended as a treatment of the\ngeneral nature of things according to Descartes’s principles; book\ntwo, The History of Nature, illustrates, by means of a great\nvariety of reported experiments and examples, the operation of these\nfirst principles in nature. In this book, Le Grand applied the general\nCartesian principles to his study of particular bodies and their\nqualities, showing how such principles can explain all natural\nphenomena. His extensive discussion includes bodies as various as the\nloadstone, plants, and insects. And finally, in the third book, A\nDissertation of the Want of Sense and Knowledge in Brute Animals,\nhe argued against the supposed link of life and sense from Plato\nonwards, and after offering a brief survey of various hypotheses on\nthe nature of soul by Aristotle, Gassendi, Fabri, and Descartes, he\nadopted Descartes’s view. In the Preface, Le Grand wrote that, “\n… this whole work contains nothing else, but his [Descartes’s]\nopinions, or what may clearly and distinctly be deduced from\nthem.” \n\nAt Oxford, Le Grand received a hostile reception. Samuel Parker\naligned Hobbes’s mechanism with that of Descartes, charging both with\natheism. Parker’s condemnations led to the banning of Descartes’s\nphilosophy at Oxford, quashing its public entrance at the University.\nLe Grand responded to Parker’s charges of atheism in his Apologia\nde Descartes (1679), challenging Parker’s criticisms with various\nproofs of God’s existence. Another long-time, Oxford critic of Le Grand\nwas the English secular priest and Aristotelian, John Sergeant.\nSergeant, best known for his criticisms of Locke’s philosophy, was also\nhighly critical of the Cartesian philosophy. Le Grand responded to\nSergeant’s criticisms of the Cartesian criterion of truth in his\nDissertatio de ratione cognoscendi … in 1679. A second\nmajor controversy occurred between the two authors late in Le Grand’s\nlife, this time over the nature of ideas. This dispute led Le Grand to\nwrite a series of short pieces, published later as Several Smaller\nPieces Against M. J. Sergeant (1698). In response, Sergeant\nattacked the Cartesian idea of extension, to which the aging Le Grand\nnever publicly responded. Le Grand died at the home of a wealthy farmer\nin Oxfordshire, where he had served as a tutor until his death in\n1699. \n\nLe Grand defended the first principles of Descartes’s philosophy\nwith great fidelity. He held to Descartes’s views that the\nessence of matter is extension; that the essence of mind is thought;\nthat material substance and mental substance are essentially, and\nreally distinct; that mind and body interact; that while humans have\nsouls, brutes and other living things are mere machines; and that\nmaterial things operate by means of moving parts according to the laws\nof motion. Le Grand did not make any substantial revisions to\nCartesian metaphysics. However, he did make two important\ncontributions: first, he attempted to clarify Descartes’s\naccount of motion which had direct consequences for the Cartesian\naccount of matter, causation, and mind-body interaction; secondly, he\nextended the scope of Cartesian physics, treating such subjects as\nmetals, plants, insects, animals, and the human body in detail. Both\ncontributions represented important developments of the Cartesian\nscience, away from scholastic Aristoteian science. \n\nLe Grand’s contribution to the Cartesian account of motion may either\nbe seen as an extension or a revision of Descartes’s, sometimes\nambiguous, treatment. Le Grand took seriously the claim that God is\nthe total and efficient cause of motion in the universe, and that\nmatter is entirely passive, and hence bodies are incapable of\nself-movement, or of moving other bodies. In his Entire Body of\nPhilosophy, he argued that since a body may be in motion or at\nrest, motion must be a mode non-essential to matter. Moreover, given\nthat matter itself is inert, it cannot be the source of the order and\ndirection of motion. To provide order and direction, God laid down the\nlaws of motion. Thus, motion itself as well as the orderly movement of\nbodies derive from God who acts as the effective principle. While the\nspecific position, constitution, and configuration of the parts of a\nparticular body determine how certain local motions are transferred,\nthe source and ultimate direction of the motion itself is God. What\nthis means for body-body interaction is that bodies function as\nsecondary causes, directing local motions in virtue of the specific\nconfigurations of their parts. Bodies do not possess any causal power\nto produce or cease movement. Kenneth Clatterbaugh argues that Le\nGrand’s position on body-body causation amounts to\noccasionalism. Clatterbaugh identifies four positions that commit Le\nGrand to the doctrine articulated by Malebranche: 1) that there are no\naccidents; 2) that motion is identical to the will of God; 3) that\nconservation and creation are the same such that God creates bodies\nand their motions continuously; and 4) that the Divine Will and\nIntellect are one. (Clatterbaugh, 1999) However, Le Grand’s references\nto secondary causes and his commitment to the created nature of laws\nand eternal truths make the occasionalist ascription a complicated\none. \n\nLe Grand’s account of body-body interaction clears the way to\nexplain mind-body interaction. In the same way as finite bodies, God\nfunctions as the effective principle of finite minds, providing the\nultimate source of change: “… there is nothing, besides motion,\nwhich can strike the organs of the senses, or affect the mind itself.”\n(1694, p. 284) Although mind and matter are substances sharing no\ncommon properties, it is in virtue of God acting as the effective\nprinciple that mind and body interact. This kind of interaction is no\nmore or no less problematic than the interaction of two physical\nbodies. There was no real problem of interaction for Le Grand, since he\nbelieved that it was not the substances per se that acted on one\nanother but in all cases God alone provided the motive force in the\nuniverse. Although things by their nature respond to this motive force\nin an orderly way, i.e., according to the laws of nature, the fact that\nthey exist as they do and that they interact is a fact completely\ndependent on God’s will. God’s power is expressed as local motions in\nbodies and as passions/thoughts in minds. In short, it is in virtue of\nGod, their effective principle, that a mind and body, or a body and\nbody, or even a mind and mind, are said to interact. \n\nLe Grand described the mind-body union in terms directly borrowed\nfrom Descartes. However, Le Grand attempted to explicate further than\ndid Descartes the nature of the mind-body union. According to Le Grand,\nthere are three kinds of union, each possessing its own principle which\neffects that union: the first is that of two minds whose principle of\nunion is love; the second is that of two physical bodies whose\nprinciple of union is local presence; and the third is that of the mind\nand body whose principle of union is actual dependence. Just as two\nphysical bodies are joined by physical contact, and as two minds are\njoined by love, the mind and body are joined by a mutually dependent\nactivity. So long as the body actually receives  its specific\nmotions dependently on the soul, and the soul actually receives its\nlocal motions (passions) dependently on the body, the spirit and the\nbody are joined. Although there can be no mode common to mind and\nmatter, there is this mutual action. While there is no mode shared by\ntwo different substances, there is a similitude and relation that\nexists between mind and body: “This similitude and relation we have\nformerly affirmed to consist in action and passion” (1694, p. 325). In\nother words, just as the body is capable of receiving and transmitting\nlocal motions since motion is a mode of matter, the mind is capable of\nvarying passions since passions are a mode of the mind. It is by the\nmutual commerce of such motions and passions that the mind and body are\nsaid to be united. The mutual activity said to occur between the mind\nand the body is a property which follows only from the union of mind\nand body and cannot proceed from either alone, “And the truth is, since\nneither body can think, nor mind be capable of dimension, there can be\nno mode common to mind and body, except a mutual acting of each upon\neach, from which alone the properties of both can follow” (1694, p.\n325). \n\nLe Grand’s extensions to Descartes’s physics included\nphenomena now classified as metallurgy, entomology, botany, biology,\nphysiology, medicine, psychology, and psychiatry. Part II of\nthe Entire Body of Philosophy, entitled The History of\nNature, catalogues and critically discusses the latest\nexperiments of his time, as well as the theories of the ancients and\nmoderns. Prominent in his discussions is the importance of secondary\ncauses in nature (both exemplary and secondary efficient causes), and\nthe need for experiments, not just as tools of confirmation, but also\nas a means of discovering the true nature of things. This was due to\nhis application of mechanism to explain not only the behavior of\nmaterial bodies but also the entire institution of nature. Le Grand\nbelieved that God laid down the laws of nature and the principles of\nbeing by acting as the primary efficient cause, and that the operation\nof these laws and principles manifested themselves in nature in the\nform of secondary causes and effects.  Although the laws and their\nspecific mechanisms of operation are not visible, secondary causes and\ntheir effects are. These causes and effects then are known by\nexperience and are the starting point of all science, which is\ncharacterized by reasoning from effects (observed in nature) to causes\n(first principles discerned by reason). Part III of the Entire\nBody of Philosophy, entitled A Dissertation of the Want of\nSense and Knowledge in Brute Animals, extends Descartes’s\ntreatment of the mechanization of the soul. Le Grand provides detailed\naccounts of sensory and motor mechanisms to explain animal movement as\nthe foundation of Cartesian psychology (Hatfield, 2013) \n\nLe Grand’s account of sensations and ideas is orthodox Cartesianism.\nSensory impressions are what mediate the external object and our mind’s\nidea of it, and they consist in nothing more than the immediate motions\nof the sensory organs in the body. Such motions are produced by a\nnatural necessity and they share no similarity or affinity with the\nparticular objects that cause them. Like Descartes, Le Grand used the\nexample of the sword wounding the body to illustrate the\nnon-resemblance or dissimilitude of the relations between external\nobjects and sensations, and sensations and ideas. (1694, p. 327) \nThe sword that produces pain in us is nothing like our sensation or\nidea of pain, nor is our idea of pain anything like our sensation of\npain. Yet, we maintain that there is a causal and representational\nrelation between the sword and the idea it produces. In addition,\nLegrand like Descartes made a clear distinction between sensory\nimpressions, which are particular, quantifiable motions, and ideas,\nwhich are representational or propositional in character. Given that\nsensations are non-resembling and non-representational (they are mere\npatterns of local motions) it follows that ideas, which are essentially\nrepresentational, could not be derived from them.  \n\nFrom the lack of any form of similitude or affinity between\nobject/sensation, and sensation/idea, it follows that there is no such\nrelation which holds between an idea and an external (material) object.\nFrom this lack of similitude, Le Grand concluded that adventitious\nideas (coming from material objects outside us) must be innate or\ninbred in the mind. For, if the external object is not like the idea we\nform of it, then the only explanation remaining is that the mind is\nresponsible for it. Likewise, fictitious ideas, like sirens and\nchimeras, have no exemplar outside the mind and so must be formed\naccording to forms natural to the human mind. And finally, common\nnotions such as substance, truth, goodness, equity, and God, as well as\naxioms such as the same thing cannot be and not be, are innate, that\nis, they proceed from the mind alone, since all corporeal motions are\nparticular but these notions are universal. The sense in which they are\ninnate differs from adventitious and fictitious ideas; innate ideas do\nnot proceed from the senses or the imagination but “are congenite and\ninbred with the said mind, from their original” (1694, p. 328). By this\nLe Grand meant that the mind or thought itself, not any of its\nfaculties such as sense or intellection, is the principle or original\nof such ideas. These ideas are formed in the mind by the mind and from\nthe mind. \n\nThus as Descartes held, there are three kinds of ideas\n(adventitious, fictitious, and innate), which are distinguished by\ntheir differing sources as well as the way in which they are inbred in\nthe mind. Adventitious ideas proceed from the senses, fictitious ideas\nproceed from the imagination and the intellect, and innate ideas\nproceed from thought itself, which acts as their ground or original.\nNonetheless, all ideas, regardless of their source or origin, depend on\nthe mind in some essential way for their form. But this gives rise to\nthe problem of explaining how ideas can be said to represent, if they\nin no way resemble their objects. This problem is especially acute for\nCartesians who held that there is a modal difference between what is\nfound at the level of sensory perception and intellection, such that\nimpressions cannot contain any of the properties found at the level of\nideas. What arrives at our faculty of thinking from the senses is not\nideas such as we form them in our thought, as the scholastic\nempiricists held, but rather only various particular motions emitted by\nexternal objects. (1694, p. 328) \n\nLe Grand’s solution to the problem of how ideas represent their\nobjects employed the notion of substitution or ‘supplying a\nstead’—wherein the cause (the object) contains all the\nproperties found in the effect (the idea) not actually but in virtue of\nits ability to supply the substitute properties or proxies. And a\nrelation, according to Le Grand, “…is nothing else but a mode of\nour understanding, comparing one thing with others, because of some\nproperties or acts that are found in them” (1694, p. 17). Descartes\nhimself never cashed out the notion of representation in terms of\nsubstitution, although he came close to suggesting it in the French\nversion of the Third Meditation, in which he claimed that such things\nas extension, shape, position and movement may be contained in him\neminently, “…and as it were the garments under which corporeal\nsubstance appears to us” (1985–91b, fn.1, p. 31). One could conceivably\ninterpret this to mean that the garments of corporeal substance, namely\nextension, shape, position and movement are the garments supplied by\nthe mind as the forms or the conceptions under which the mind grasps\nmaterial things. Although the mind itself is not extended, shaped,\nlocally positioned or moved, it dresses material substance in these\nproperties in order to perceive particular material things. But there\nis no suggestion in Descartes regarding how the dressing is related to\nthe material object grasped. Le Grand’s notion of substitution was\nintended as an explication of this relation, and is his contribution to\nthe Cartesian dialectic on ideas. \n\nLe Grand was one of the few Cartesians to defend Descartes’s\ndoctrine of the creation of essences and eternal truths. The thesis is\nthat God is the efficient cause of all things, both actual and\npossible, including all the truths we call eternal, “In like manner as\na king is the maker of all laws in his kingdom. For all these truths\nare inborn in us from him; as a king also would have them so in his\nsubjects, if he had power enough to write his laws in their hearts.”\n(1694, p. 63)  The main worry that critics, like Malebranche, had\nof this doctrine was that it would remove any necessary foundation for\nthe propositions of science and theology, making them contingent and\nuncertain. To answer this worry, Le Grand added that there is one\nimportant difference between kings and God in the way they set down\ntheir laws, “A king can change his laws because his will is changeable,\nbut God’s will is unchangeable, for it is His perfection to be\ninvariable in manner” (1694, p. 63). In this way, Le Grand attempted to\naccount for the dependence of all things on God’s will, while at the\nsame time accounting for the immutable foundation of the truths of\nnatural philosophy. \n\nWhereas the creation of true and immutable natures was the work of\nGod’s freewill (not dictated according to his Wisdom, as Malebranche\nand other critics held), once created, they were necessary. In order to\ntie this necessity to the immutability of God’s will without limiting\nGod in any way, Le Grand drew on a Scholastic distinction between\nantecedent and consequent necessity. He argued that true and immutable\nnatures, such as mathematical truths, only possessed a consequent\nnecessity. God did not will that 6+4=10 because he saw it could not be\notherwise, but in virtue of his free will, 6+4 [necessarily] = 10;\ntherefore it could not be otherwise. As Descartes put this same point,\n“And even if God has willed that some truths should be necessary, this\ndoes not mean that he willed them necessarily; for it is one thing to\nwill that they be necessary, and quite another to will this\nnecessarily, or to be necessitated to will it.” [1985–91c, p. 235]. For\nnothing outside of God, not even the eternal truths or immutable\nessences, necessitate that God act in one way or another, but rather,\nthey are themselves eternal and immutable in virtue of the fact that\nGod, whose existence is necessary and immutable, willed them in their\nessence and existence. Eternal truths and immutable essences are\nnecessary only in that they presuppose and are consequent to the act of\nGod who caused them. (Easton, 2009) \n\nEchoing Descartes in part VI of the Discourse on Method, Le\nGrand held that God implanted certain simple, true, and immutable ideas\nin our minds so that we could have a science of nature; yet, He also\ncreated a nature whose power is so ample and vast that only observation\ncan close the gap between the two. Thus, while Le Grand remains\nessentially a rationalist in his claim that knowledge of immutable\nessences, laws and truths remains the autonomous domain of reason,\nwhich is independent of the appearances of the senses, it is a\nrationalism tempered by his view that truths and laws are dependent on\nthe will of God, and hence, are in some sense contingent. This\ndependence means that truth must be sought after in the effects of\nnature, and not in something independent of those effects, and that\nsecondary causes, although dependent both on God’s will and on the\nprimary truths of nature, have a genuine role in causal explanation. In\nother words, our search for truth is in the specific operations of\nthings, and even though our understanding of these truths is\nimportantly independent of these specific operations, our discovery of\nthem is not. \n\nLe Grand’s early ethical and political writings are not Cartesian. In\nLe Sage des Stoïques, ou l’Homme sans Passions, Selon les\nSentiments de Sénèque (1662), later translated and\npublished as Man Without Passions (1675), he expounds the\nStoical doctrines of Seneca, for which the goal of the moral person is\nto expunge the passions. He later rejected this view of the passions\nand argued the Cartesian view that the passions ought to be trained\n(not expunged) in the moral life. Le Grand also wrote a curious\npolitical treatise, Scydromedia (1669), which is a\nsemi-fictional, utopian work describing his vision of the ideal state.  \n\nThere is nothing innovative in Le Grand’s moral theory, yet his\ndiscussions are rich with references to ancient and contemporary\ntheories. He borrows from the ancient Atomists, the Stoics, the\nScholastics, and the “Moralists” of his time, and frames it, where\npossible, in Cartesian terms. Le Grand acknowledges that Descartes\nhimself wrote little on ethics, but he argues that Descartes’s\ntreatment of the soul and the passions provides a solid foundation for\nthe treatment of moral matters. According to Le Grand, the object of\nethics is right reason, its end is the perfection of man, and it is an\nactive not a speculative science. An example of his reconciling project\ncan be seen in Book I, Part X of his Entire Body of Philosophy\n(1694), where Le Grand attempted to reconcile the doctrines of Seneca\nand Epicurus on the role of pleasure in the virtuous life, by drawing\non Descartes’s theory of the passions. (1694, p. 347)  He argues\nthat pleasure has a role to play in the moral life, since virtue\ndepends on freewill (as the Stoics held) and pleasure derives from the\nsatisfaction of the mind in possessing the good (as Epicurus held).\nWhat Descartes’s theory provided was an explanation of how pleasure (a\npassion) could aid the will in choosing the right course of action,\nwhile maintaining the voluntary nature of the will and virtue. \n\nLe Grand, although not an innovator, is worthy of study for his\ncontribution to the development of Cartesianism in the latter half of\nthe seventeenth century. No less important is the fact that he spent\nmost of his life in England, where his contact with members of the\nRoyal Society and the universities of Cambridge and Oxford had a\nlasting impact on the reception of Descartes’s ideas in England,\nGermany, and France.","contact.mail":"patricia.easton@cgu.edu","contact.domain":"cgu.edu"}]
